<h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="first">British-born and educated at Berlin and Oxford,
Ernest Favenc (1845-1908; the name is of Huguenot origin) arrived
in Australia aged 19, and while working on cattle and sheep
stations in Queensland wrote occasional stories for the
<i>Queenslander</i>. In 1877 the newspaper sponsored an
expedition to discover a viable railway route from Adelaide to
Darwin, which was led by Favenc. He later undertook further
explorations, and then moved to Sydney.</p>

<p>He wrote some novels and poems and a great many short stories,
reputedly 300 or so. Three volumes of his stories were published
in his lifetime:</p>

<p><i>The Last of Six, Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1893</p>

<p><i>Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1894</p>

<p><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</p>
<br>

<p>His short stories range from bush humor to horror,
supernatural to strange, and to the privations of late 19th
century exploration in Australia's unforgiving inland. His first
two short story books (consolidated into one volume, as there is
considerable overlap), are available free as an ebook from
Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>01. --  THE UNHOLY EXPERIMENT OF MARTIN SHENWICK,<br>
AND WHAT CAME OF IT</h2>

<h3><i>The Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney, 17 Dec 1898</h3>

<p class="first">I KNEW that Shenwick had been studying the
occult for a long time, but being a hardened sceptic, I was not
prepared to accept the wonderful progress and results that, he
said, had so far rewarded him. All the experiments he essayed for
my conversion had turned out failures. Therefore, when he came to
me and stated that he had discovered how to resuscitate the dead,
provided they were not too long deceased, I frankly told him that
I did not believe him.</p>

<p>He was used to my blunt way of speaking, and did not resent
it, but proceeded to explain how, after death, the soul hovered
about the body for some time, and if you could induce the soul to
re-enter the body, the late departed would be given a fresh lease
of life.</p>

<p>Several difficulties suggested themselves to me, which
Shenwick would not listen to. What, for instance, I said, if a
man were blown into fragments by a dynamite explosion, how will
you find and unite the pieces? If he were hanged, and his neck
dislocated, how would you fix his spine up again? If he had his
head chopped off&mdash;</p>

<p>Here Shenwick interrupted me to state that he meant only cases
of natural death, the decay of the vital forces, not mangling and
mutilation. He explained that the emancipation of the spirit for
a short period inspired it with fresh vigor, and it came back
rejuvenated and strong.</p>

<p>"How are you going to try your experiment?" I asked. "Corpses
are not knocking about everywhere."</p>

<p>"I admit that is a stumbling block," he said, "but it may be
got over. Would you object to putting a temporary end to your
existence in the cause of science?"</p>

<p>I told him in language more forcible than polite that I would
put an end, final, not temporary, to his existence first.</p>

<p>He accepted this seriously, and informed me that that would
not avail, as I would not be competent to conduct the
experiments.</p>

<p>We parted for the time, and I believe he spent most of his
time searching for a fresh corpse. I know he applied at the
hospital, and was ejected with scorn and derision. He also
visited the morgue, but as most of the bodies that came there
were "demn'd damp, moist, unpleasant bodies," they were no use to
him.</p>

<p>"I've got him," he said, one day, stealing into my room on
tiptoe as though he thought that the corpse upon whom he had
designs would hear him.</p>

<p>"Got whom?" I asked, "the corpse you have been looking
for?"</p>

<p>"No, he's not a corpse yet; I'm not going to make him one.
Don't stare like that. He's dying, and I have agreed to keep him
in comfort till he dies. He's got a churchyard cough, and drinks
colonial beer by the gallon. Will you come and see him this
evening?"</p>

<p>I said I would, and went on with my work, as he closed the
door, softly and mysteriously, for what reason I know not. I went
to Shenwick's that evening. He occupied three residential
chambers in a large building, and found that he had given up his
bedroom to the subject, who was established in comfort and
luxury. As a subject, the man was probably as good as any other,
but he was by no means prepossessing, and the language he used to
Shenwick was painful to listen to.</p>

<p>"It's unfortunate, you know," said my poor deluded friend,
"but since he has been taken care of and doctored, I am afraid
he's getting better. Now, he would have been dead by this time if
he had been left in the Domain. There was a drenching rain last
night that would have finished him off out of hand."</p>

<p>A voice was heard from the next room, demanding beer,
adjective beer, in a husky whisper.</p>

<p>"This is my only hope," said Shenwick, as he filled a pint pot
from a keg. "The doctor says he is not to have it, but I take the
liberty of differing from the doctor."</p>

<p>He took the beer in to his subject, and got cursed for his
pains.</p>

<p>"He was quite resigned to death when I picked him up," said
Shenwick sadly, when he came back; "but since he has been made
comfortable he wants to live."</p>

<p>"Small wonder," I returned, laughing.</p>

<p>"It's no joke; by my agreement for his body I am bound to keep
him as long as he lives."</p>

<p>"Well, we must try to upset that, if he does live. I have not
seen your agreement; but, speaking as a lawyer, I should say it
was not legal."</p>

<p>About three weeks after this Shenwick opened my office door,
put his head inside, uttered the mysterious words, "Be prepared
for a message this evening," and disappeared. I concluded that
the subject had caved in after all, and was on the brink of the
grave.</p>

<p>The message duly arrived before I left my office, and after
dinner I went to see Shenwick. True enough the subject had
departed this life, and his mortal, and very ugly, frame was in
the possession of my friend, together with a doctor's
certificate. He was now at liberty to conduct his experiments and
prove the truth of his theory. He asked me to remain, and witness
the result, to which I consented, and as he informed me that the
small hours of the morning were most favourable, I took the
opportunity of having a sleep on a sofa in the outer room, while
Shenwick watched his beloved subject.</p>

<p>Shenwick woke me at about two o'clock. I got up stiff and
cross, as a man generally is after sleeping in his clothes on a
sofa.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said, in that mysterious whisper he had affected of
late. "I am now sure of success. I tried some passes just now,
and I am confident that a spark of animation followed."</p>

<p>I muttered a tired swear word, and followed him into the
bedroom. Shenwick lowered the light, and commenced his mesmeric
or hypnotic hocus pocus over the dead subject. In the dim light
it was a most uncanny exhibition, and the more excited Shenwick
grew the more antics he cut with his hands, waving and passing
and muttering.</p>

<p>Now what happened is almost incredible, had I not seen it
myself; but that grim and ghastly corpse on the bed rose up in a
sitting position, gasped and choked once or twice, and then broke
out into the vigorous cry of a healthy, lusty infant. For an
instant the most cowardly terror assailed me, and I confess that
I had it in my mind to cut and run for it, when I noticed
Shenwick, after swaying to and from, pitched headlong on the
floor in a dead faint. That restored me to my proper senses, and
I went and picked him up and tried to restore him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hideous thing on the bed still kept blubbering
and crying. If you shut your eyes you would swear that here was a
baby of forty-lung power in the room.</p>

<p>Shenwick at last recovered. "It was a success," he gasped.</p>

<p>"If you call that row a success, it was," I answered.</p>

<p>He listened intently, and a pained look came into his face. He
was evidently greatly puzzled. "Let me go into him by myself," he
said at last. I cordially agreed, and he went into the bedroom,
and I solaced my nerves with a good strong nip of whiskey.
Gradually the crying stopped, and Shenwick came tiptoeing out and
told me that the subject had fallen into a nice, quiet sleep.</p>

<p>"It's awkward, very," he said; "but at any rate the experiment
succeeded."</p>

<p>"What's awkward?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I left it too long. I told you that the spirit rejuvenated,
grow young, after its release from the body. This spirit has
grown too young&mdash;it's gone back to infancy."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to rear it as an infant; but you won't find
anyone to look after it in its present state."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not; I'll have to bring it up by hand myself. It's
hungry now, poor thing. Isn't there a chemist who keeps open all
night?" I directed him to one, and he asked me if I would mind
looking after it while he went out and bought a feeding-bottle
and some food. "If it cries, try and amuse it," he said, as he
left the room; and I heard his footsteps go down the stairs,
rousing strange echoes in the great empty building. I called
myself all the fools I could think of for having anything to do
with Shenwick and his confounded experiments, and settled down to
my dreary watch.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the horrid thing woke up, and commenced to cry
again. Not being a family man, I had not the remotest idea how
infants were to be soothed and beguiled to rest and silence. I
had an inane notion that you said, "Goo, goo," or "Cluck, cluck,"
to them, and snapped your fingers and made faces at them. I tried
all these in succession, but the more I goo goo-ed and cluck
cluck-ed and made faces, each one more hideous than the last, the
more that thing cried and sobbed.</p>

<p>At last, when daylight came, there was a loud knocking at the
outer door. I went and opened it, and there stood the caretaker
and his wife, the last much excited.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Shenrock?" she demanded. "What's he doing of with
a baby in the room, and ill-treating it, too?"</p>

<p>"There's no baby," I said; "it's a sick man."</p>

<p>"No baby, when I can hear it crying its dear little heart out!
You've been smacking and beating of it." She pushed past me and
went to the bedroom, saying, "Hush now, my pet; mother will be
here directly."</p>

<p>She got as far as the door; then, at the sight of the
black-muzzled ruffian sitting up in bed bellowing, she fell down
in kicking hysterics. Her husband went to her assistance, but he,
too, was struck speechless, with his mouth wide open. In the
midst of it, Shenwick came back with a feeding-bottle, patent
food, and some milk, having been lucky enough to stick up an
early milk-cart. We recovered the woman and Shenwick told her
that the patient had just had brain fever, and now imagine
himself a baby, and the doctor said he was to be humoured. The
woman was only too glad to get away. She had had what she termed
a turn, and was not desirous of stopping any longer near this
unnatural infant.</p>

<p>It was horribly grotesque to see the man-baby seize hold of
the nozzle of the feeding bottle and suck its contents down. When
it was satisfied, peace reigned, and the thing slept.</p>

<p>"Shenwick," I said, "you see what comes of interfering with
Nature's laws. You will now have to adopt and rear that object in
the next room. You were thinking of getting married, I know; but
will your wife consent to your bringing home a baby 50 years old!
No, she will not&mdash;you can consider that settled."</p>

<p>Shenwick groaned, "You needn't rub it in so," he answered.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, for that little innocent darling asleep in the
next room will be a constant reminder."</p>

<p>"Can't you give me some advice on the subject? Although you
cannot deny the success of the experiment; yet between ourselves
it is of no avail for any purpose. I thought and hoped that the
spirit would come back charged with knowledge of the great
hereafter. As it has unfortunately turned out, a baby has come
back who will grow up with as little knowledge of the past as any
other baby does." A long hungry wail came from the other room,
emphasizing his statement, and proclaiming that the infant
desired further nourishment. Shenwick went and filled the bottle
up again.</p>

<p>"There's one chance you have," I said, when he came back.
"This aged baby will, most likely, have to go through all the
many ills that babies have to endure. I should take care that he
died of croup, or scarlet fever, or whooping cough or something
or other of that sort."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'taking care?'" said Shenwick, looking
aghast.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all but what anyone but a fool would understand. I
mean, take care of him if he is ill. Now, goodbye, I'm tired." I
went home for a bath and breakfast, fully determined to have no
more to do with Shenwick, and his dark experiments.</p>

<p>A fortnight afterwards, he came to the office. "I have got rid
of him," he said, dropping on to the chair, as though wearied
out.</p>

<p>"Buried him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I called to the doctor who certified his death, and I
told him that he had revived, but had come imbecile, imagining
that he was an infant. So, after studying the case for some days,
he called in another doctor, and he has been removed to an
asylum."</p>

<p>"Do you pay for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a small sum weekly."</p>

<p>"Well, he will be a pensioner on you all your life, for,
according to you, he has another span of years to live. Have you
told Miss Colthrope about it?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! no; what would be the good?"</p>

<p>"Best to be open in these matters, however, I won't tell
anyone; provided you swear never to have anything to do with this
foolery any more."</p>

<p>"That I'll readily do," he said, and he did.</p>

<p>Shenwick married, and years passed, and he had a growing
family, when he received a communication from the asylum, stating
that the patient had improved so much that they thought he ought
to be removed. The fact being that he had grown up into a boy and
became more sensible.</p>

<p>Shenwick came to me in despair. "Just fancy, he has the soul
of a boy, reared amongst lunatics in an asylum. Of course, he has
not been taught anything; what on earth shall I do with him? Will
you come out with me and see him? His appearance may suggest
something."</p>

<p>I went out with him; ten years had passed since the fatal
night of the experiment, and the body containing the boy's soul
was that of an old man of sixty-six, looking older on account of
the exposure and hardships the body had suffered. It was a
regular puzzle. It was evident that he could not take the patient
home. And it was pitiful, too. The soul, or spirit, whatever you
like to call it, was full of life and vigor, which the palsied,
doddering old body could not second. I could think of nothing but
a benevolent asylum, and Shenwick agreed to it. The subject never
reached it, however. There was a railway accident, and he was
badly injured. We went to see him at the hospital. He was
unconscious at the time, but death was very near, and he came to
his senses just before we left. He recognised Shenwick, and
growled out in the husky voice of old, "Hang you, are you never
going to fetch that adjective beer?" Then he expired.</p>

<p>Shenwick told me that the last words he uttered at the period
of his first death was an order to him, in flowery language, to
go and get some beer.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>02. -- THE GHOSTLY BULLOCK-BELL</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 26 Aug 1893</h3>

<p class="first">
"LET'S go on to the next water," said Dick impatiently.</p>

<p>"Why, it's seven miles and one of our horses is quite lame.
No, this place is good enough for me," I returned.</p>

<p>Dick grumbled; but as there was reason on my side he had to
give in, and we were soon unsaddled. Usually a very even-tempered
fellow my companion seemed strangely put out about something. I
did not take much notice&mdash;men often get "cranky" in the
bush. He smoked long after our blankets were down, and then I
dropped off to sleep and left him staring moodily into the
fire.</p>

<p>"I was only a boy!"</p>

<p>I awoke with the words ringing in my ears. The moon had risen,
but it was a late moon, and seemed only to make the dark shadows
darker, and add to the general loneliness around us.</p>

<p>Dick was standing near the dead fire with his hand stretched
out as though keeping something at bay. The sickly light of the
dying moon did not reveal his face, but his whole attitude
expressed supreme horror.</p>

<p>"What on earth is it?" I asked, getting up with a thumping
heart.</p>

<p>He laughed strangely and said, "Listen! Can't you hear
them?"</p>

<p>I listened. Some curlews were wailing dismally, and that was
all; as I told him, curlews always begin to ring out when the
moon rises.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said, "not that; listen again." I did so. Now,
whether it was mere fancy stimulated by my companion's strange
manner and my sudden waking, I don't know, but it seemed that I
distinctly heard a deep-toned bullock-bell toll slowly and
monotonously, as when a belled bullock licks himself.</p>

<p>"Pah!" I said, "it's a lost worker."</p>

<p>"Is it?" he answered with a repetition of his queer laugh. "Go
to sleep again, old man, it's nothing to do with you."</p>

<p>The bell, if it was a bell, had ceased, and as I still felt
drowsy, I drew my blankets over my shoulders and soon dozed off.
When I awoke again it was broad daylight.</p>

<p>Dick was very silent all that day (we were on our way back to
the station after delivering some fat cattle at
L&mdash;&mdash;).</p>

<p>"Do you believe in warnings?" he asked, when we were camped
again that night.</p>

<p>"Presentiments?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it. Because I've got one, I shan't see this trip
out."</p>

<p>"O, bosh," I naturally replied.</p>

<p>"It was at that last camp I killed my young brother."</p>

<p>I thought Dick had gone mad, for he was one of the best
natured of men, but he proceeded, as if he had to tell his
story:</p>

<p>"I was only sixteen, and he was a little chap of twelve, but
quite different from the rest of us. Very willing and
sweet-tempered, but shy, and read every book he could get hold
of. Well, at that time dad was doing a bit of carrying, and as he
was laid up with rheumatism he sent me on a trip with the team,
for I was a dandy bull-puncher even then. He told me to take Ben
along and try and make a man of him. You know what cruel brutes
boys are. I soon found out that Ben was frightened of going away
from the camp in the dark and made up my mind to cure him, and so
bullied and chivvied him that the poor little beggar became as
nervous as a girl.</p>

<p>"Now, there's a yarn hanging to that place where we camped
last night&mdash;something as to murder done by the blacks in the
old times. Ben knew every story there was about the country and
could tell them well, too. Of course, he had heard this tale. Now
the place was haunted by the ghost of a woman who was always
searching for her child who had been killed by the natives.</p>

<p>"I made up my mind to cure Ben once and for all. In the middle
of the night I woke him and told him that we wanted to start
early, so he must go and bring the bullocks up close to the camp.
'There they are,' I said, 'you can hear the bell.'</p>

<p>"The poor little cove looked at me with great big eyes and
shivered, for the bullock just then began to lick himself and his
bell tolled out like a clock&mdash;one, two, three, up to twelve,
and stopped. He begged and prayed me to wait until daylight, but
I hunted him off with the bullock-whip and followed him up for a
bit to make sure he went.</p>

<p>"It was all quiet for a while, but just about the time he
would have reached them I heard that bell again toll out
solemnly. Then came such a shriek! I heard it distinctly, though
he must have been some way off. I tell you I did feel sorry and
ran as hard as I could shouting to him. Half-way I met the
bullocks coming up to the camp like mad, but the bell was not
amongst them. I had great trouble in finding Ben, for he was on
the grass in a dead faint, and the moonlight was not strong. I
carried him up to camp and he was an awful sight. His arm was
stretched out quite stiff, as if to keep something off, and the
poor boy's face was all drawn up with fright and his eyes wide
open and staring.</p>

<p>"It was a long time before I brought him round, and when I did
he was quite silly, and he never got right again, but died soon
afterwards."</p>

<p>Dick was silent and so was I.</p>

<p>"Did you find the bullock-bell?" I asked at last.</p>

<p>"No, and I should like to know who rang that bell&mdash;and
who rang it last night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You heard it, too! The yarn about the niggers goes," he went
on after another pause, "that they sneaked up to the hut ringing
a bullock-bell that they had found so that if the people heard
any noise they would fancy it was some stray workers."</p>

<p><br>
DICK did not see the end of that trip. We stopped next night
at a wayside pub, and he drowned his remorse in rum. Worse still,
he fell in maudlin love with a girl there, and Peter, the
bush-missionary, turning up&mdash;he got married.</p>

<p>She is a perfect devil, and when last I saw Dick he was thin
as a rake. Better for him had the presentiment been fulfilled in
the orthodox way.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>03. -- THE SPELL OF THE MAS-HANTOO</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 20 Dec 1890</h3>

<p class="first">
PONTINIAK, at the mouth of the Kapoeas River, is not a place
much visited by Europeans, but one can obtain an exceptional
experience there.</p>

<p>Pontianak is the headquarters of the Dutch in Borneo, and the
Resident-General has a small joke of his own, which he plays off
on the unsuspecting new-chum. As is customary in those torrid
settlements, business is generally transacted during the
comparatively cool hours immediately succeeding daylight. As you
discuss it with the courteous old Resident, he inveigles you into
a stroll up and down the verandah, and after a little of this
exercise, he informs you that the equatorial line passes right
through the centre of his bungalow, and that during the morning
walk you have crossed and re-crossed the equator several
times.</p>

<p>I have other cause to remember Pontianak. It was my
starting-point on an expedition destined to be a very memorable
one. I had long contemplated a trip into the interior of Borneo,
allured partly by the reports of the half-worked diamond mines,
and partly by natural curiosity to see a place so little known. I
had accidentally met with a young travelling Englishman, an
enthusiastic sportsman, who eagerly jumped at the notion, and the
result was that we soon found ourselves at Pontianak, where,
after the necessary official permission had been obtained, we
made our arrangements for departure.</p>

<p>Travelling there is far more luxurious than in the Australian
backblocks. Our destination was the Sintang district, and our
highway the river Kapoeas. A large roofed-in native boat, known
as a gobang, a native crew under a mandor, or headman, and a good
outfit of stores were obtained, and we started for the land of
the Dyaks.</p>

<p>For days our journey was most auspicious. The dense jungle on
either hand afforded a good supply of game for my sporting
companion, and the native tribes we met were friendly and
interesting.</p>

<p>As time went on we found ourselves amongst Dyaks, permission
to pass through whose country cost some diplomacy, but patience
and a friendly demeanour overcame all objections, and we soon got
well into the mountainous districts on the upper reaches of the
river. As yet I had not met the object of my search&mdash;the
abandoned diamond mines, legends of which were often repeated by
the coastal Malays. Once or twice I was shown places where
gold-mining on a most primitive fashion had undoubtedly been
pursued in some long-forgotten age. Circular holes had been sunk
in three places in the form of a triangle, and drives had then
been made from one to another, but by whom it had been done the
Dyaks could not tell. Certainly not by their forefathers. Some
told me that it was the work of slaves long ago, when the sultans
from India had swept down on the archipelago and enthroned
themselves in Java and Sumatra, thence enforcing tribute over
Borneo, Celebes, and the smaller islands.</p>

<p>No ruins or inscriptions were to be found indicating that the
country had ever been permanently settled by the men of that
time. Sometimes I heard mysterious reports of a wild race whose
descent was more ancient than that of the Dyaks: they were known
as the Orangpooenan, or forest men, and were marked with a white
spot in the middle of the forehead, an indication, at any rate,
of their Hindu origin.</p>

<p>One afternoon about four o'clock the mandor came to me and
pointed to a rope of twisted rattan stretched across the
river&mdash;a sign that we were to go no further. Some Dyaks were
assembled on the bank, and we went ashore to parley with
them.</p>

<p>They were apparently as friendly as usual, and accepted small
presents of tobacco, but declined to give us any reason for
refusing the required permission to proceed. We visited the
village and partook of fruit there, and after dark returned to
our boat. Morton was very hurt at our sudden detention, and
wished to go on in spite of the natives. I pointed out to him the
folly of such a course, and he consented to take things quietly
and wait for a day or two. During those two days I made every
effort to conciliate our neighbours, and with perfect success
excepting in the one direction. We were not to go up the river. I
could obtain no reason for this refusal, and concluded that we
must perforce return.</p>

<p>My enquiries as to the ancient gold and diamond mines seemed
to amuse the old men mightily. One of them told me that I had
seen the Kambing-Mas. This is a golden sheep which appears to
certain doomed men. So infatuated does the victim become at sight
of it, that he follows it on through jungles and mountains day
after day until he dies of fatigue.</p>

<p>Of legends and traditions I got my fill, but permission to go
ahead was not to be had. My old friend who told me of the
Kambing-Mas asked me if I desired to try for the great diamond
which was supposed to be in a lake at the head of a river. This
star-like gem, described as of enormous size and unspeakable
lustre, can be plainly seen at the bottom, but woe to the rash
man who dives down after it! The infuriated spirit-guardians
seize and strangle him, and his dead body floats on the surface
as a warning to others.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," went on my loquacious host, "you would go to the
land of the Mashantoo, the spirit-gold?" This district, rich in
the precious metal, was cursed by a sultan of old, on account of
the death of his son, and although you may go there and fill your
pockets with gold-dust and nuggets, they all turn to sand and
pebbles when you cross the boundary on your return.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Morton chafed greatly at our delay, and I had to
exercise much tact to pacify him. The third evening I saw him in
close talk with the mandor; he then left the boat and went to the
village, returning about dark with the information that we now
had permission to proceed.</p>

<p>It seemed strange to me that I had heard nothing about it, but
at the time I had no suspicions. It was a bright moonlight night.
Taking the mandor's kris, Morton went ashore and severed the
rattan rope where it was tied round the butt of a tree. The men
took their places and the boat was once more under way.</p>

<p>I dropped off to sleep about ten o'clock. I awoke amidst the
crash of boughs and branches, bringing ruin and destruction on us
and our craft. Although half-stunned, I managed to struggle from
beneath the crushed-in roof, and, as the boat sank, struck out
feebly for the shore, which I had no sooner reached than I
fainted.</p>

<p>What had happened to us was the result of Morton's rashness.
Poor fellow, he paid for it with his life. The villagers had not
given him permission to go on, but he had bribed the mandor to do
so nevertheless. Along the bank of the river the Dyaks had
selected certain leaning trees under which we would pass. These
had been cut through to breaking point, and temporarily secured
from falling outright by twisted rattans. As we passed, these
guys were cut, and we were swamped by the falling trees. Morton
was killed instantly, but I strangely escaped, and most of the
crew were more or less hurt. All this I learned afterwards.</p>

<p>When I came to my senses I was lying by a fire in a small
clearing in the jungle, with two or three Dyaks sleeping around.
One man was awake, apparently watching. When he saw me looking
about he came over to me and brought me a drink. He was very
light-coloured, dressed in the ordinary <i>chawat</i> or apron
with a jacket, called a "<i>bagu</i>," on his body. He smiled
pleasantly, and, addressing me in the native dialect, said, "Saki
(a name they had given me at the village), you were ill advised
to seek the Tampat-Mas (gold-mine) here. Why did you not watch
the flight of the fish-hawk first?" I asked after Morton, and he
told me of his death.</p>

<p>I was well treated, and the fate of Morton, whom they knew to
be guilty of the offence, had apparently atoned for our
trespass.</p>

<p>On the second day I was much recovered, and Abiasi, the Dyak
who had just spoken to me, was sitting by my side showing me how
to use the blow-pipe, when a strange old man came from the jungle
and advanced in the clearing.</p>

<p>He was tall, white-haired and white-bearded, and on his
forehead was a round mark made with a white pigment of some sort.
Abiasi rose and said something to him of which I could only catch
the word "Saghie," another name for the forest men. Presently the
old man, who had only a ragged <i>chawat</i> on, came over and
regarded me earnestly, then he and Abiasi renewed their
conversation.</p>

<p>"Saki," said the latter at last, addressing me directly, "if
you still wish to see the Tampat-Mas where the Mas-Hantoo is,
this old saghie will take you there." He then further told me
that the old saghie, or Orangpooenan, lived in the mountains
where there were many old mines, but it was all spirit-gold, that
turned into sand and gravel after it was taken away. The saghie
thought that the presence of a white man might break the charm. I
eagerly agreed to go, and Abiasi gave me many instructions as to
my return, lent me a parang, or heavy knife, and bade me
farewell.</p>

<p>It was evening when we started, and the old man led me through
the jungle by a well-beaten path. Although the moon was bright,
the shadows were dense where it did not penetrate, and I confess
to having felt very nervous as we pushed on in silence, starting
at intervals some sleeping bird or a troop of monkeys.</p>

<p>Presently we came to a small opening and halted in front of a
low-thatched hut. In answer to his call a young woman, evidently
just aroused from sleep, came out; she brought some living embers
and made a fire. Like the old man, she was very fair in colour,
good-looking, with well-shaped limbs, which, as her only attire
was the <i>chawat</i>, or apron, were fully displayed. After
eating some rice and fruit, I lay down by the fire and slept for
the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>I was not sorry to see a fine large fish cooking on the coals
for breakfast, as my returning health brought with it a good
appetite. When we had finished the meal the old man and the girl,
whom I guessed to be his granddaughter, took a large rush-woven
basket between them and started along a narrow path leading
through the forest, motioning me to follow.</p>

<p>In about two miles we reached an open space, and before us
rose the rugged side of a hill. We followed the base of this
round for some time until the face of the hill grew steep and
precipitous, and I noticed we were amongst some ancient
workings.</p>

<p>At the mouth of what seemed a drive in the cliff the old
saghie stopped, and they set down the basket. He then spoke
rapidly to the girl, whom he called Suara, and she collected dry
wood and built a fire, the old man lighting some tinder with a
flint and steel. Suara then broke down the branches of a resinous
kind of pine common to the hilly country, and with the assistance
of my parang dressed them into rude torches. I now understood
what these preparations meant, and when we had lit the torches
the two picked up the basket and led the way into the tunnel or
drive.</p>

<p>As seen by the dim, flaring light, it presented far more
finished work than any of the ancient workings I had yet seen. We
must have gone at least a hundred yards before the old man
stopped, and I then saw that somebody had recently been at work,
for there was loose dirt lying about, and some native tools.</p>

<p>The old saghie put down the basket, and motioned to me to come
and fill it with the shovel. I did so, and naturally took the
opportunity of examining the dirt. I sifted some in my hands, and
blew part of the finer dirt away, and am satisfied, even now,
that there was a large quantity of coarse gold through it and
several specimens, as they are generally called by diggers. Of
this I am quite sure, despite what afterwards occurred.</p>

<p>The old saghie was peering over my shoulder while I blew the
dust away, and grinned hideously as he saw the gold exposed here
and there. I remember wondering at the time what possible
ambition could be his for the yellow dross. Perhaps he thought
the same of me.</p>

<p>Anyhow, we were both satisfied with our inspection, and I went
on filling up the bag until it could hold no more. The old man
and the girl picked it up and carried it out of the tunnel.
Instead of taking the homeward track as I anticipated, they
turned down another one, and in a short time we were beside a
small stream which descended from the range. Here there were rude
appliances for washing, and I selected, as the most convenient, a
shallow baked-clay dish, and commenced washing out a
prospect.</p>

<p>Not a speck, not a trace of gold was there. I did not look at
my two companions, for it struck me that possibly the dirt at the
top of the basket was different from what I had examined in the
tunnel. I therefore took another prospect from the very bottom
and proceeded to wash it.</p>

<p>It was a strange scene. The narrow path leading down to the
small stream, just cutting a thin gap in the dense forest. The
shrill chattering and screaming of parrots overhead, and the
noises made by the troops of monkeys, which swung from bough to
bough, and from one long hanging vine to another. Behind me, as I
squatted by the water's edge, the two yellow, semi-nude figures
of the old man and the girl, bending over my shoulders in rapt
attention.</p>

<p>The dirt was rapidly reduced as I swirled the water round in
the dish, and when I tilted it to and fro, there, at either end
of the grit and gravel, appeared the yellow sheen of gold. I
heard the two behind me heave a sigh of satisfaction as this
sight appeared. Surely the spell of the Mashantoo was broken at
last?</p>

<p>Suddenly, without a sound of warning, a glistening, flashing
object dropped from overhead and struck me and the girl into the
water. Blinded and frightened, I staggered to my feet, for the
stream was but shallow, and in an instant saw what had happened.
A huge boa had dropped from one of the trees above, where it is
their custom to hang, watching the paths by which the deer go to
water, and snatched its victim from our midst. The old man was
crushed against the trunk by three or four folds of the creature,
whose tail was still in the branches above, and he was already in
the pangs of death.</p>

<p>Suara, who, like myself, had been knocked forward by a blow
from a coil of the reptile as it dropped on its prey, was
standing near me gazing with horror-stricken eyes on the
death-scene. The crunching of the unhappy man's bones was quite
audible, but his collapsed body showed that life was over.</p>

<p>The dish had floated on the surface, and was held from going
down the stream by a tussock of reeds. Suara picked it up and
handed it to me with a look of despair. Instinctively, despite
the near presence of the monster, now gloating over its meal. I
finished washing the prospect. The spell of the Mas-Hantoo held
good. Nothing but gravel and sand was in the earthen dish, which
I dashed to pieces on a rock.</p>

<p>Together, Suara and I left the spot and made our way to the
hut, which we reached that evening and there rested for the
night. Next morning she conducted me through jungle paths to
within sight of the village where Abiasi lived.</p>

<p>Here she stopped and pointed in another direction, nor would
she accompany me a step towards the village; and so, neither able
to say farewell to the other in language both could understand,
we parted. Abiasi told me afterwards that more of her people
lived in the direction in which she had pointed.</p>

<p>Most of our goods had been recovered, and the crew were now
nearly all well. A fresh <i>gobang</i> was provided, and I parted
from the Dyak villagers with strangely mixed feelings, although
it was with some sense of satisfaction that I saw mile after mile
increase the distance between me and the mines of the
Mas-Hantoo.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>04. -- THE SACRIFICE OF NORMAN GRAINGER</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 14-18 Jan 1896</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
From the mid-1890s to 1902 an appalling drought affected
the entire eastern half of Australia. That is the background of
this novelette.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE man was singing blithely as he came slowly along the
lonely bridle-track. To look at him, one would have thought that
he had not much cause for cheerfulness. He was walking, and
leading his horse.</p>

<p>Such a horse! The poor wretch, a mere frame of prominent
bones, shambled along after its master with downcast head and
drooping ears. As regarded flesh, the man was not much better off
than the beast The latter carried an old riding saddle, now used
to pack the owner's dilapidated 'swag,' a roll of a weather-worn
tent and two ancient blankets. The stirrup leathers had been
taken out of the spring bars and passed underneath the flaps, and
buckled round the swag.</p>

<p>All around the country was bare, burnt, and dusty&mdash;a
scene of desolation; but the traveller, old and thin, as he
looked, hobbled, stoutly on, singing a love-sick ditty about his
lost Nellie, occasionally moistening his throat with a mouthful
of water from the canvas bag he carried in one hand. As the sun
sank behind the upper boughs of the monotonous forest he was
travelling through, more tracks began to join in with the one he
was following, and man and horse soon emerged on to the open
space surrounding a waterhole, about half full of muddy
water.</p>

<p>The ground, around was totally destitute of grass of any
description, and the ashes of fires and stumps of trees told that
it was an old and well-used camping-place, and not far away the
white trail of the road was visible, while deeply indented
wheel-tracks led to and fro. Without unstrapping his swag from
the saddle, the traveller simply undid the girth and lifted the
whole lot&mdash;it was light enough&mdash;from the back of the
old horse.</p>

<p>Selecting a spot at the brink of the water which seemed fairly
sound, he led his steed there, and let him drink his fill. Then,
with a small billycan that had been strapped on the swag, he
carefully washed the old fellow nearly all over. This equine
toilet completed, he re-ascended the bank with his tin can full
of water, set it down, and tied the old horse to a tree.</p>

<p>'We must go out back directly and hunt up a patch of grass,
old man,' he said, affectionately patting the sorry animal on the
shoulder; as he did so the crack of a whip and the creaking of
wagon wheels gave notice of the approach of a couple of
teams.</p>

<p>The solitary traveller just glanced in the direction, then
busied himself in making a fire and putting his small tin billy
on to boil. The two teams drew up at one of the old camping
sites, and the busy work of unharnessing commenced.</p>

<p>One after the other the strong, lusty draught horses were
relieved of their trappings, and, after a preliminary roll in the
dust and a vigorous shake, they ran down to the water and slaked
their thirst. Then they assembled on the bank, and a little
gamesome kicking and squealing ensued&mdash;veritable
horse-play&mdash;the while the nosebags were being prepared with
their rations of chaff and corn, the more favored ones getting an
empty candle-box.</p>

<p>The old horse looked round longingly, as though he recognised
the proceedings, and only wished that he would be invited to join
in them. His master put a tiny pinch of tea in the now boiling
water, and, taking a piece of dry damper out of his swag, he
divided it in half. Breaking one portion into small pieces he
gave it to the old horse in the hollow of his hand, who
gratefully whinnied in return.</p>

<p>Presently one of the teamsters, refreshed with a wash, came
striding over. He was a splendid specimen of the first generation
of bush-born Australians, a class now almost as extinct as the
Dodo.</p>

<p>'Pretty dry, old fellow,' he remarked cheerfully. He was a
burly giant, with a hearty smile, rife with good temper. 'Did you
come along the road?'</p>

<p>'No,' was the reply; 'I came by the bridle-track from Fairview
Vale.'</p>

<p>'Then you can't tell us how the water is in Cameron's
Creek?'</p>

<p>The traveller shook his head. The carrier glanced at the old
horse.</p>

<p>'Your prad looks as though he wanted his ribs stretched' a
bit,' he said, in a good-humored tone, devoid of all offence.</p>

<p>'Yes, he does so. There's been no grass in the paddocks at the
Vale for months, nor at the Crater either.'</p>

<p>'Been at work at the sheds? Have they cut out yet?'</p>

<p>The traveller replied in the affirmative to both questions.
The carrier picked up a blazing stick from the old man's fire,
and proceeded in a slow and deliberate manner to light his pipe.
When he had got it in good going order, he remarked, with a
scarcely perceptible glance at the meagre fare.</p>

<p>'You'd better come over and tucker with as to-night, and have
a pitch?'</p>

<p>The traveller accepted the frank invitation as frankly as it
was offered.</p>

<p>'Billy!' roared the teamster, 'bring over one of them there
spare nose-bags, and a jolly good feed in it.'</p>

<p>A long, sunburnt lath of a boy, just then employed in cutting
up a piece of pumpkin, soon came over, bringing the desired
article. Taking it from his hand, the burly teamster himself
slipped the bridle over the ancient's head, and suspended the bag
in its place. The old boy greeted the change with a rapturous and
well-satisfied whinny.</p>

<p>'Many's the good feed you've had in your time,' said the
carrier, and he fell back a step, and gazed with pitying
admiration, at the wreck of a well-ribbed horse. 'Been a rare
good 'un in his day,' he said.</p>

<p>The traveller nodded an eager assent; the ample act of manly
kindness to his dumb friend had warmed his heart to the doer of
it.</p>

<p>'Game as a bulldog ant still, I'll bet,' went on the other,
and he gave the ancient a playful smack and pinch in the flank,
which made that noble animal lay back his ears and a fan an
ineffectual cow-kick at the world in general.</p>

<p>'Better stroll back with me to our camp, said the friendly
giant. 'Billy, here, will be taking the horses out to a patch of
dry grass directly, and the old moke can go out with them.'</p>

<p>In those days the hospitality of the bush carrier was
proverbial and unbounded; moreover, it was a point of honor with
him always to have a plentiful spread. The traveller was soon
seated on an empty box enjoying his share of a meal, which, if
not quite so fastidiously cooked as a French dinner, was more
satisfactory to a hungry man.</p>

<p>Eating over, Big Harry and his mate, a tall, taciturn man from
the Hawkesbury, known in contradistinction to Big Harry as Long
Tom Bevor, lay back and lazily smoked the boy, had slipped away
after his return from taking the horses out to the patch of dry
grass, and wailing and discordant sounds began to arise from the
hindmost wagon.</p>

<p>'There's that young imp at it again,' grumbled Big Harry.
'Ever since he bought that there concertina at the last township,
it's been like a crowd of niggers round the camp, mixed up with a
flock of curlews and a pack of dingoes.'</p>

<p>'Is it a new one?' asked the guest.</p>

<p>'Well, Billy has been a grinding at it for the last week, but
I suppose he hasn't damaged its bellows yet.'</p>

<p>'I'll give you a tune, if you like,' said the old, man.</p>

<p>'Here,' Billy!' roared Harry in a voice that would have
dominated a gale, 'just bring that 'constant screamer' over here;
here's a man as understands it.'</p>

<p>Billy came over and handed the instrument of torture to the
traveler, who touched a note, and suddenly burst into song.</p>

<p>They were old-fashioned songs, old plantation ditties, once
popular, but his voice was still strong and vigorous, and he
manipulated what Harry, in his clumsy bush humor, called, the
'constant screamer' with the hand of a master. The two teamsters
and the boy listened entranced, and the camp by the bare, muddy
waterhole became a haunt of memories to them in the future. When
the stranger ceased Big Harry knocked the ashes out of his pipe,
and remarked:</p>

<p>'Look here, old man, if you're on the hunt for a job, just
come with us as off-sider, and well make it worth your
while.'</p>

<p>The traveller laughed, and shook his head. 'Many thanks; but I
have a job waiting for me ahead.' He touched a note, and started
a well-known marching song, with a rollicking chorus that they
all joined in, Big Harry's voice making the tree tops quiver.
Soon afterwards the camp was silent, save for the distant
rhythmical pulsations of the heavy horse-bells.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE old traveller plodded along contentedly enough the next
morning, though the road was dustier and more disagreeable than
the bush track he had been travelling on before. His heart was
lighter for the kindly companionship of the night before, and,
though the old horse's burden was some pounds heavier, that
gallant animal did not murmur at it, for he had two unexpected
and satisfactory feeds to work upon.</p>

<p>With characteristic open handedness the carriers had insisted
upon the old man replenishing his ration bags before leaving.
There was no pretence at charity in this, no humiliation in
accepting it; it was just the 'give and take' of the bush of
those days, when unions had not stirred up the strife of classes,
and the lazy, blatant, loud-voiced political agitator, who lived
on the game, was unknown. The youth of the country took to bush
life of their own accord, and did not, as now, prefer the scanty
earnings and cheap pleasures of an overcrowded city to a running
fire of stockwhips and a fiery run of hoofs.</p>

<p>Along the dusty road, through the grassless country, the old
man and old horse kept sturdily and steadily on their way for
many weary days. Then the country through which their steps led
showed signs of closer settlement, and the road was fenced on
both sides, and the ancient picked up a precarious living on
township commons and travelling stock reserves.</p>

<p>At length a day came when man and beast seemed to carry
themselves in a jauntier fashion. Early in the morning they left
the main road, and took a smaller and little used one leading
through a gate towards a range about six or seven miles distant.
Once more taking a bridle track that branched from this road,
they followed it through another gate, until it crossed a little
running creek coming down from the range.</p>

<p>Biped and quadruped had a grateful drink, the latter giving a
satisfied sigh, as if to say, 'Ah! this is the right tap at
last.'</p>

<p>On the bank of the creek was a good, substantial three-railed
fence, enclosing a little patch of grazing land, and beyond could
be seen the foliage of fruit trees, surrounding a dwelling.
Either this little spot had been favored with later rain or the
drainage from the range at the back kept the ground moister, for
the effects of the long-continued drought were not nearly so
apparent as on the country left behind.</p>

<p>Opening the gate, the man took the path leading to the house,
the pair walking briskly on, as though the late arduous journey
had been a joke. The 'ancient,' indeed, put on all the swagger of
a landowner sauntering over his own property. As they neared the
homestead a bright-eyed girl of 16 came dancing down the track to
meet them. She hugged the old man round the neck, addressing him
as 'Dad,' in endearing tones of welcome. Then she turned her
attention to patting and fondling the ancient one, who appeared
highly gratified.</p>

<p>As the three approached the house, the girl with her arm
passed through her father's, it was seen to be a neatly kept
little cottage, with a ruder, rougher building at the back of it;
a well-furnished garden surrounded the whole, and the little
permanent mountain rivulet could be heard gurgling past. Two or
three cows and calves and a few sheep were grazing in the small
paddock they had passed through.</p>

<p>A hard, but kindly-featured woman of more than middle-age
greeted him respectfully as 'Mr. Grainger,' and a tough,
wiry-looking old fellow, who was just finishing his mid-day meal,
rose up and did the same. Then he went out to look after the
horse, but the girl had anticipated him; she had already unpacked
and unsaddled the ancient one, and was leading him off to the
stable, and laughingly told the man to go back.</p>

<p>'Everything all well?' asked Grainger, sitting down on a
bench.</p>

<p>'All well thank the Lord!' replied the woman; 'but I hear
they're suffering terribly for the want of rain hereabouts.
Rotta-rotta has lost ten thousand sheep already, so Jock
says.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' said Jock, who just then entered. 'Ten thousand, and
more to follow. They were dying in the shed,' he added, with a
sort of chuckle, as though, for some reason, the intelligence was
of a satisfactory nature.</p>

<p>'You ought to take shame of yourself, Jock,' said the woman,
'to rejoice over the misfortunes of others.'</p>

<p>Jock only rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>'How's Carlingford getting on?' asked Grainger.</p>

<p>'There's a lad with sense,' cried Jock. 'Sold a lot of store
sheep and cattle, sent away all the fats he could and moved a big
lot of sheep to some country he's taken up out west. He'll get
through right enough; but the others, with their greed,
overstocked their paddocks, so that before the drought had fairly
commenced, you could have flogged a flea through them.'</p>

<p>'Well, you change your things, Mr. Grainger,' asked the woman,
who did not appear to relish her husband's rejoicing over a
fallen enemy. 'The missy has put them out for you, and Jock will
take a tub of water in the room.'</p>

<p>'Now, Dad,' said the girl, flourishing a comb and a large pair
of scissors, 'come round to the back and be trimmed first.'</p>

<p>Grainger rose, and went round to the back of the ramshackle
old building, and the cutting and clipping was finished amid much
chatter and gossip. When it was over he retired to a room, and
after some time reappeared, looking about fifteen years younger.
He wore town clothes of good fit and make, his linen was
exquisitely got up, and his boots and hat matched the rest of his
things. With his beard trimmed to a point and his hair cut short,
he looked the picture of a thorough gentleman, well born and
educated.</p>

<p>Big Harry and his mate would have thought they were dreaming
dreams or seeing visions had they seen him. The transformation,
however, was not noticed by the others, to whom it was seemingly
a matter of course.</p>

<p>The girl had changed the common dress she had been wearing and
removed her sun bonnet. With her father she crossed to the
cottage, and together they stepped onto the verandah and entered
a passage which divided the cottage in half. The girl opened one
of the doors, and they went into a room comfortably, almost
luxuriously furnished.</p>

<p>A woman was reclining on a lounge, an invalid evidently, and
something more. The eyes she turned towards her husband wore a
vacant expression, and as the door opened she could have been
heard talking softly to herself. Grainger advanced, embraced her
kindly, and sat down by her.</p>

<p>'Have you had a pleasant holiday, Norman?'</p>

<p>'Oh, extremely so,' he said. 'Will you be able to come out to
lunch? We will chat about it then.'</p>

<p>'I think I will try. Was Miss Raymond down there? Her girls
must be quite young women, now.'</p>

<p>Grainger answered gravely that he had seen them, and that they
were quite grown up, which, as they were the daughters of a
girlhood friend of Mrs. Grainger, and three middle-age old maids
by this time, he could say with safety. After many more questions
in the same strain, the girl, who had been listening with a
perfectly serious face to this farce, left the room, and
presently returned to tell them that luncheon was ready.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grainger arose, and, with her husband's assistance, went
into the next room, where her daughter had a chair prepared for
her. The meal was good, and well laid cut with glass, linen, and
flowers. The conversation still continued in the strain adapted
to the hallucination the poor woman labored under. After she had
retired, and resumed her old position on the couch in her own
room, Grainger followed by his daughter, went into another room,
barely furnished with an old table and two ancient chairs.</p>

<p>'Well, Dad, what luck?' asked the girl.</p>

<p>Grainger smiled. 'I got work at three sheds altogether, but I
had to go out back a long, long way, and the country is in a
terrible state.'</p>

<p>'So I should think, Dad, by the appearance of you and
Chevalier.'</p>

<p>Grainger produced three cheques of extremely modest
dimensions, but the girl did not look disappointed at the
amounts.</p>

<p>'That will carry us on nicely,' she said.</p>

<p>A knock at the door brought in Jock, and the girl perched
herself on the table, and helped, in the conversation that
followed on the doings on the little selection dining the owner's
absence.</p>

<p>Grainger had been a wealthy man. He had once owned the
principal share in the large station of Rotta-rotta. Bad season
after bad season brought him down, mortgage followed, a
swindling, absconding partner completed the ruin, and then the
firm who held the mortgage stepped in and took everything. During
the season of prosperity he had, on the passing of the Act,
selected the small area of ground on which he now lived, and
settled it on his wife, in whose name he had taken it up; and
built the cottage, planted the fruit trees, fenced and otherwise
improved it.</p>

<p>This was all he had left, and this did not hold out much hope
of a livelihood to a man well past the prime of life. But he had
worse to put up with. His wife was stricken down with paralysis.
She recovered partly, but her intellect was clouded. She still
imagined that she was Mrs. Grainger, of Rotta-rotta station, and
the doctor assured Grainger that if her changed circumstances
were forced upon her, an attack of acute mania, might take the
place of the harmless hallucination she labored under. How was it
to be kept from her? The selection had originally been taken up
as a sort of summer retreat; it was an exceptionally fertile
little spot, with a perennial spring running through it and had
been christened the Oasis. The mortgagees had allowed him much of
his private property, including some furniture, etc., and his
favorite horse, Chevalier. The furniture sufficed to furnish two
rooms of the cottage in a manner Mrs. Grainger had been used to,
and there she lived in ignorance of their fallen fortunes.</p>

<p>Jock and his wife, two old servants, insisted on sharing their
master's adversity, and Jock looked after the little property,
Grainger's absence in search of work being ascribed to visits of
business and pleasure.</p>

<p>For this was the masquerade of the good clothes kept up; for
this was all the money gained by toilsome journeys, by the
severest economy, and by every shift and contrivance used; and
amongst such surroundings had Winifred Grainger grown up to the
verge of womanhood. Her father, a highly-educated man, had
taught her whenever he was at home, and from Mrs. Jock she had
learned practical housewifery; perhaps, after all, it was not bad
training for the girl to grow up in such an atmosphere of
unselfishness and self-denial.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
POOR Grainger, he did everything for a living. It was not
possible for him, on account of his wife, to accept some
subordinate situation either in town or country, so he roamed the
land for work. He had walked his painful way to the outside
stations at shearing time; he had tuned pianos, and played on
them for township balls, for he was an excellent amateur
musician. He had even joined a strolling company of Ethiopian
serenaders, and rattled the bones as corner man; and by one means
and another kept the Oasis afloat, so to say.</p>

<p>But even this was envied him. The firm, who had foreclosed
sold the station to a self-made man of shady antecedents. This
individual coveted the Oasis after the Scriptural fashion, and
when Grainger refused all offers to sell it, became the fly in
his honey pot.</p>

<p>A series petty persecutions were commenced. Blacklock, the new
man, denied Grainger right of way through one of his paddocks to
the main road, knowing well that, although, he was quite in the
wrong, Grainger could not afford to follow him through the courts
in appeal after appeal.</p>

<p>Blacklock, however, roused up a friend of much influence on
behalf of Grainger. Tom Rossiter of Carlingford, who had
succeeded to the station on the untimely death of his father, had
from boyhood always, as he expressed it, 'liked old Grainger,'
and he played a trump card on his behalf, and also one which
promised to be a paying one in time. He selected land on either
side of the Oasis, and insisted on the right of way to and from
his selections, which would accord it also to Grainger. When
Blacklock found that, instead of having a broken old man to
oppose him, he had a young and very energetic one, with a big
balance at the bank, and a determination to fight him tooth and
nail to the very door of the Privy Council if necessary, he cried
craven, and the matter dropped.</p>

<p>Rossiter was Winnie's especial favorite and hero. Had he not
given her a pony when she was a little girl, and when that
diminutive steed met with an accident which unfortunately
necessitated his being shot, had not another one mysteriously
taken its place in the paddock; one night? Moreover, were not
Rossiter's mother and two sisters always glad for her to come
over to Carlingford and stay with them?</p>

<p>About two days after Grainger's return Rossiter, who had heard
of it, came over to see him. He was, of course, well acquainted
with all the surrounding circumstances of Grainger's ruin, and,
like the good-natured fellow that he was, visited Mrs. Grainger,
presented his mother's and sisters' compliments and best wishes,
and humored the good lady to the top of her bent; then he
adjourned with Grainger to the den of an office.</p>

<p>'I've got something to tell you,' said Rossiter. 'It came to
me through a man who, if he gets drunk, will retail the
information everywhere, and that is what I want to avoid. For a
time, at any rate. You know Jim Dee, the fencer who has taken the
contract for fencing that selection I took?'</p>

<p>Grainger nodded.</p>

<p>'He is am old miner, you know; has been knocking about all
over the world. In sinking a post hole on the south boundary,
only a few panels from where it joins yours, he came upon this,'
and Rossiter unfolded a paper parcel, and put some dark, rugged
lumps of stone on the table. Grainger examined it curiously.</p>

<p>'Silver ore,' he said at last.</p>

<p>'Exactly,' returned Rossiter. 'The lode runs through the
corner of my selection, and, by its direction, goes right across
the middle of yours, and into my western selection. Now, I am
going to send this down for assay, and apply for a mineral lease
to the south. Meantime the difficulty is in keeping Dee's mouth
shut; since he starts drinking it's all over the place.'</p>

<p>'Does he know that it is silver?'</p>

<p>'No; I think not. He may be foxing, but he pretends that he
thinks that it may be some sort of mineral.'</p>

<p>'Of course, we'll give him a show if it turns but all
right?'</p>

<p>'Of course we will, and it could be worked at a small cost. We
have a permanent water supply, here, and the range is covered
with firewood. If the assay turns out well we must select all we
can of the range.'</p>

<p>Grainger looked with admiration at his young companion, and
admired his business foresight; but Rossiter was still
thinking.</p>

<p>'Anyhow, we must secure the source of the spring,' he went on,
'and secure ourselves from that being diverted. I wonder
Blacklock has not done that before to annoy you. Anyway, I'll
make sure of it by putting in an application to-morrow. By Jove,
I'll put it in Winn's name. How old is she?'</p>

<p>'Seventeen in about three months.'</p>

<p>'That's good enough then. We'll make a rich woman of her.'</p>

<p>Grainger smiled somewhat sadly. He had not the sanguine
feelings of his young friend.</p>

<p>'What do you say to going out this afternoon, and getting the
lay of the place? Can you give me a shakedown, and I'll go on to
the township tomorrow.'</p>

<p>'Of course, we can. As soon as I have written a couple of
letters, we'll go.'</p>

<p>In about half an hour the two men, with, of course, the
attendant Winnifred, were strolling up the gully, along the bed
of which the little stream rippled. Even now, during the
excessive dry weather, the gully was cool and shady; the moisture
oozing mostly from one spot about a mile from the boundary fence
of the selections; above, all was much drier, and it was evident
that they had reached the source. The three stood there silent
for some time.</p>

<p>What did they think of? Grainger, the man of the past, may
have seen the picture of a quiet old age amongst congenial
pursuits, free from the harassing toil that was killing him.
Rossiter, the man of the present, heard the busy whirr of
machinery, and saw the poppet heads of the shafts, and the rising
and descending cages. And Winnie, on the threshold of girldom,
what did she see, but the glorious dreams of the unknown world
beyond the quiet bounds of the Oasis.</p>

<p>Rossiter first broke the silence.</p>

<p>'We'll run the boundaries while we are here. You stop here,
old man. Winn, you come and put in corner pegs, and I'll pace
it.</p>

<p>Rossiter started with a measured stride, and Winn followed
dutifully behind. Their forms were soon hid in the forest slope,
and Grainger lit his pipe for a quiet smoke.</p>

<p>The tread of a horse aroused him from a pleasant daydream.</p>

<p>'Good day, Mr. Grainger,' said a voice, as the rider
approached and pulled up alongside of him. Grainger looked up,
and saw his enemy, Blacklock. A rubicund man, nearly of his own
age, with a fringe of white whisker like a baboon's ruff.</p>

<p>Grainger nodded.</p>

<p>Looking over your little property, eh?' went on the other, in
a satirical, manner.</p>

<p>'I scarcely know whether that is any business of yours or
not,' returned Grainger. 'I imagined that we were no longer on
speaking terms, but you seem to have forgotten the fact.'</p>

<p>Blacklock flushed, and tapped his boot with the crop which, in
his role as squatter, he now carried.</p>

<p>'I didn't come here to bandy words,' he said. 'To-morrow I'm
going to mark out a selection here, and I just wanted, to tell
you to keep off of here an future.'</p>

<p>'Indeed! Extremely kind,' returned Grainger, keeping his
temper. 'It is Crown land at any rate at present, so I shall
finish my pipe at my leisure.'</p>

<p>At this minute there were hasty footsteps, and Winnie,
appeared on the scene, and stood by her father's side. Winnie had
obediently followed Rossiter to the first corner, and remained
there at his bidding, while he marched onward, at right angles,
counting his strides as he went. He soon disappeared in a dump of
thicker timber, and Winn turned round and looked towards the
place where they had left her father standing. She saw the horse
and rider, and with the instinct of a bush-bred girl, recognised
them, and, without a thought but that of a true woman's in
standing by the side of those she loved, hastened back to take
after place with her father.</p>

<p>Blacklock looked at the girl and ironically lifted his hat a
little; and said, 'Good evening, miss Grainger. I was just
warning your father against trespassing on this land in future,
and I am afraid that I have to give you the same caution.'</p>

<p>'I was not aware that you knew my daughter,' fired up
Grainger. 'Excepting, perhaps, by sight. Kindly don't presume on
that slight knowledge, or it will be the worse for you.'</p>

<p>Blacklock glared in astonishment at him. Winnie tapped her
foot impatiently. For the first time in her life she was cross
with Rossiter. Why had he not come back? He must have missed her,
and could see where she was. In truth, Rossiter had done both,
and was then quietly approaching from an unexpected angle, and
none of the group saw him.</p>

<p>'Do you know who you are speaking to?' exclaimed Blacklock, in
sudden anger. 'Don't you know I could buy and sell you over and
over again?'</p>

<p>'So far as ill-gotten money is concerned, you might,' returned
Grainger; 'But, old as I am, I'll teach you a lesson, if you like
to teach you a lesson, if you'll get off that horse.'</p>

<p>'The devil, you will! You think that because that young fool
Rossiter&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Here he is,' said a voice, the owner of which was almost
close beside him. 'What have you got to say about him?'</p>

<p>Mr. Blacklock, who had been sitting half-turned in his saddle,
started round. Winnie gave a slight hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>'Oh! It's you, Rossiter, is it?' said Blacklock.</p>

<p>'Mr. Rossiter, if you please. We are not quite on terms of
familiarity, specially after just calling me a young fool.'</p>

<p>'Look here, sir,' said Blacklock, mustering up a bluster, 'I
wish my sons were here to hear you.'</p>

<p>'I wish they were,' retorted Rossiter hotly. 'I'd make a
football of one of them up and down this gully.'</p>

<p>'You might find that they could play football better than
you,' said Blacklock savagely.</p>

<p>'They haven't got that reputation, at any rate. When Melbourne
or Sydney is too hot for them they come up here and masquerade as
bushmen. Bushmen, indeed!'</p>

<p>'That'll do, Mr. Rossiter. You will repent those words as long
as you live,' and Blacklock, who was intensely, proud of the two
cubs he called sons, rode away fuming.</p>

<p>Rossiter laughed.</p>

<p>'What's he been talking about?' he asked.</p>

<p>'A good joke,' returned Grainger. 'He is about to select this
place, and warned Winn and myself against trespassing here for
the future.'</p>

<p>'The pompous old fool! He has clean given himself away. But
Dee is at the bottom of this, I'll be bound. He must have been
talking.'</p>

<p>Rossiter thought for a moment, then he went on. 'I'll go in to
the township to-night and have the application in the Lands
Office the minute it opens. If Blacklock is only going to run the
boundaries to-morrow, why, we shall be at least twelve hours
ahead of him. What an ass the fellow must be. Come on, Winnie,
we'll finish our survey.'</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">
ROSSITER rode in to the township that night, and the next
morning the application was duly lodged, and the time recorded.
He was riding homeward that afternoon along the dusty road,
bounded by the parched and barren paddocks, when he saw two
horsemen approaching. He was not long in recognising the
Blacklock brothers.</p>

<p>'Too late, too late,' chuckled Rossiter, who guessed that they
were on their way to the lands office. They piffled up surlily
when they met, the eldest, a pasty-faced young man of
three-and-twenty, being nearest to him.</p>

<p>'Morning, Rossiter. What's all this about making footballs of
us, eh?'</p>

<p>'Depends upon your behavior, or misbehavior, rather. Your
father politely referred to me as a young fool, and expressed a
wish that you were present&mdash;to take his part. I
presume.'</p>

<p>'Well, you began it,' grumbled young Blacklock. 'We might have
been all good friends but for your taking old blackamoor
Grainger's part.'</p>

<p>'Speak civilly,' said Rossiter, angrily.</p>

<p>'Why, what's in that? Nearly everyone knows that he once
blacked his face and sang with some nigger minstrels. I took care
to spread the yarn.'</p>

<p>Rossiter's eyes blazed. A touch of the near spur, and his
horse shouldered up against the other one. He caught the young
whelp by the collar, and shook him soundly.</p>

<p>'Here! Hi! stop it! Pull him off, Reggie,' cried the assaulted
one, but Reggie showed no desire to interfere. 'He has worked
hard, like an honest, honorable man,' said Rossiter, letting him
go; 'and that's something you'll never be.'</p>

<p>'Confound you!' grumbled the other, as he fumbled at his
loosened collar. 'You've lost my diamond stud.'</p>

<p>'Ah! oh!' laughed Rossiter. 'A bushman who wears diamond
studs!' and he rode off, remarking as he did so, 'Tell your
respected parent from me that, if I am a young fool, there's a
proverb that he'll learn to know the truth of: 'that there's no
fool like an old fool,' and he rode off, leaving the brothers
wrangling.</p>

<p>Their mutual recriminations grew so rancorous that when they
reached the headquarters of settlement in that district they
selected different hotels whereat to pass the night.</p>

<p>Reggie, who had declined to come to his elder brother's
assistance, was by far the better of the two. The other had
inherited all his father's defects, with a few original vices of
his own thrown in. The mother kept herself in the background; she
had never risen with the family rise, and report said that her
reading and writing were after the traditional manner of
Shakespeare's knowledge of Latin and Greek. There were no
daughters, and the poor woman lived a solitary, friendless life,
regretting the old days of struggling and striving.</p>

<p>Reggie had a budding passion for Bella Rossiter, the younger
of the two Rossiter girls, and he thought it politic to keep
clear, if possible, of any complications with her brother, whose
strong, masterful character he somewhat admired. He was not a bad
young fellow at heart, and it was possible that, freed from the
influence of his elder brother and away from his unwholesome
surroundings, he yet might develop into something worthwhile.</p>

<p>Bella was some eighteen months older than Winnifred, and the
girls were great companions. Winnie, indeed, had to thank Mrs.
Rossiter and her daughter for all the social training she had
received. When her father was away she had necessarily to remain
tied to the Oasis and her mother's side; but when her father was
at home she was enabled to spend many long, happy days at
Carlingford.</p>

<p>Soon after the meeting between Rossiter and the Blacklocks the
two girls were roaming over the range on their active ponies.
They were both fond of such rambles, Bella especially having an
adventurous strain in her blood; as the daughter of on old
pioneer should have. The range, in spite of being called by such
an imposing name, was of no great height, but it was lonely,
rugged, and had the repute of having been once the haunt of a
bushranger; in all probability a vulgar horse-stealer whose
exploits had grown with the years that had passed since his
legendary existence.</p>

<p>Bella's great ambition was to discover the cave said to have
been the retreat of this worthy, and the recesses of which
popular fancy had credited with concealing much stolen plunder!
Bella was in great hopes of discovering this spot. She had found
an old, almost worn-out track which apparently led somewhere, but
had an awkward knack of running out, and leaving the investigator
stranded. She had vainly tried to induce her brother to offer his
services in the quest, but Rossiter had, in the first place,
doubted the existence of the bushranger; and, in the next,
asserted that if ever there had been a bushranger he would not
have been such a fool as to use the same track until it was so
plainly defined that it would lead anyone to his retreat.</p>

<p>Bella, however, firmly believed in the bushranger, the cave,
and the hidden plunder, and was moreover persuaded that the faint
pad she had discovered would eventually lead her to success. On
this day she was following it with the patience and determination
of a black tracker. She had, indeed, got on further than at any
other time; walking ahead with her pony's bridle over her arm,
Winnie following until they were at last brought up by a flat
expanse of rock. Following the direction of the trail she
advanced resolutely, Winnie, who had also dismounted, close
behind, while the hoof strokes of the ponies rang out
metallically.</p>

<p>Bella stopped in the middle and looked around.</p>

<p>'I am quite, quite sure,' said, the confident young leader,
'that I am right. Look, Winn, what a splendid view you have all
over the country.'</p>

<p>True, there was a complete panorama spread before them. They
stood on the cap of a projecting knob of one of the main spurs,
and, as Bella said, it was a perfect look-out from which any body
of horsemen coining across the lower country could have been seen
approaching from nearly three cardinal points of the compass.</p>

<p>The girls stood and enjoyed the wide view, picking out
particular places they knew, when suddenly Winnie's sharp ears
caught sounds like advancing footsteps.</p>

<p>'Oh, Bell, there's someone coming &mdash;perhaps it's the
bushranger!'</p>

<p>'I hope he's nice if it is,' answered the undaunted Bella.
'I'm just dying to meet a bushranger; I've read such a lot about
them in English novels.'</p>

<p>The girls listened. Heavy, clumsy footsteps were undoubtedly
coming down the slope that abutted on the flat rock behind them.
Bell glanced round them, then led the way to a good-sized
boulder.</p>

<p>'Boot and saddle,' she said, and stepped on to the stone, and
seated herself on her sturdy little steed. Winn was soon mounted,
too, and, confident in their game little animals and their own
horsewomanship, they waited for the advance of the enemy man.</p>

<p>It was not a formidable figure who finally approached them. A
shambling old fellow, roughly dressed in the usual bush rig-out.
Truth to tell, he looked somewhat disappointed when he came in
full view of them. He came on, however, and made a clumsy
salute.</p>

<p>'Good day, young ladies. I thought I heard voices, and being
short of tobacco, I thought as there was somebody here as might
have some.'</p>

<p>'Do you live here, then?' asked Bell, gazing curiously at this
Rip Van Winkle of the range.</p>

<p>'I'm staying up here now on a kind of holiday, having a spell
like. There's a good spring back here, and I've pitched, my tent
there for a bit. May I ask if you young ladies belong about
here?'</p>

<p>'Belonged here all my life,' laughed Bell. 'Ah! Then your name
might be&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Rossiter.'</p>

<p>'Surely now. You must be little Bell; she was the freckled
one.'</p>

<p>The two girls laughed merrily. Bell was not touchy on the
subject of her sun-kisses, nor had she need to be.</p>

<p>'Many's the year's work I did for your father in the old time.
Surely you must remember: I am the Hatter?'</p>

<p>'Of course, I've often heard of you, but don't remember you
personally. What brings you up here, Dan?'</p>

<p>'Just what I said&mdash;a spell. When fences came in, I gave
the monkeys best, and went up north to the new diggings. I made a
bit of a rise up there, and thought I'd like to have a look at
the old place, but there&mdash;I couldn't stand the township, so
I came up here, where it's quiet and homelike. Always a hatter,
you see, Miss Bell.'</p>

<p>'Well, Dan,' said Bell, who, on the strength of former
acquaintanceship, although forgotten by her, had at once
established herself on terms of intimacy with the old fellow, 'is
your camp far from here? We should like to see it.'</p>

<p>'Surely, Miss Bell. But who is the other young lady? She's not
a Rossiter?'</p>

<p>'This is my friend, Miss Grainger.'</p>

<p>'Of Rotta-rotta. Must have seen you when you were a baby, I
expect; but you've grown since then. Sorry to hear your father
lost the old place.'</p>

<p>Winnie bent down, and shook hands with the old hatter, then he
led the way across the rock in a different direction to the way
he had come.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="first">
THE old fellow's camp was on the head of the next gully; there
was the tiny spring he had mentioned, which he had cleared out.
An old sheep dog was chained to the tent pole, and he rose up and
barked indignantly at them&mdash;evidently, he, too, was a
hatter. Bell slid down from her horse, and went up fearlessly and
patted his head, and he fawned upon her in return.</p>

<p>Everything about the place was neat, and methodically tidy.
Dam invited his guests to have some tea, and, on their assenting,
made the fire up and put the billy on to boil.</p>

<p>'Dan,' said Bella, 'do you remember the story about the
bushranger who used to live up here?'</p>

<p>'I remember a yam of some sort about</p>

<p>'And about his cave?'</p>

<p>'Aye! and his cave, where the folks said he had planted a lot
of watches and things.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' cried Bell, eagerly. 'Winnie and I have been
looking days and days for that cave. I've found an old track that
I believe leads to it, Now, I'll tell you what we'll do. I'll
show you the track; and while you're up here you can puzzle it
out, and when you find it&mdash;which, of course, you
will&mdash;we'll go halves in the plunder.'</p>

<p>Dan laughed. 'Of course, I will help, Miss Bella. On one
condition.'</p>

<p>'What's that?'</p>

<p>'That you let me have first pick out of the watches. Specially
if there's any ladies' watches among 'em. There's a young woman.
I know as I should like to make a present to.'</p>

<p>'Certainly you shall, Dam; although I'm quite shocked at an
old hatter like you knowing a young woman.'</p>

<p>The girls had a merry tea, drinking it out of the
cleanly-polished pannikins which Dan produced. Then they prepared
to return.</p>

<p>'Now, Dan, as my share towards finding the cave,' said Bell,
'I'm going to provision this camp. Tomorrow I'll get my brother
Dick to come up with me. You remember my brother Dick?'</p>

<p>The old fellow went off into a hoarse chuckle.</p>

<p>'Remember him! Don't I call to mind one day when I was in at
the station, and he mounted a colt, a bit of an outlaw, and the
colt shucked him clean over the cap of the stock-yard and he fell
right on top of his head. Lord! Your father said when he picked
him up, "that boy's head and neck must be made of wrought
iron!"'</p>

<p>And Dan laughed again, as though at an exquisite joke.</p>

<p>'Well, Dick will come with me tomorrow. But mind, he's not to
know a word of this. He always laughs at me for believing in the
bushranger. You come a bit of the way with us, and I'll show you
where the track runs out.'</p>

<p>Followed by Dan, the two girls retraced their steps to the
other side of the flat rock, then, with a very unconventional
handshake they parted, and the two rode home talking gaily over
their adventure.</p>

<p>Next morning, Bella and Winnie, followed by Rossiter leading a
pack-horse&mdash;as he called it, 'doing blackboy'&mdash;climbed
the range and arrived at the hatter's camp. There was a cordial
greeting between him and his father's old servant, whom, of
course, he had been old enough to remember well.</p>

<p>The stores were unpacked, and stored away, then Dan beckoned
Bell mysteriously on one side.</p>

<p>'I poked about after you'd gone,' he said, 'and again this
morning. And I found the continuation of that track. T'aint a
wallaby pad, either. Will you come and see it?'</p>

<p>Bell eagerly assented, and waving a gay adieu to Winnifred she
followed in Dan's wake. Rossiter had been stooping over the old
dog; raising his head he noticed Winnie standing a little
distance off. In her riding habit she looked older than she
really was, and as he looked at her standing there enjoying the
fresh air and some happy-day dream, it suddenly struck Rossiter
that his old playmate had all at once shot up into a woman, and a
very pretty woman at that.</p>

<p>Presently the two cave-hunters came back and a hearty meal
followed, Dan proudly doing the honors. Then with the pack horse,
with the now empty saddle, trotting on ahead of them they
descended the track, leaving Dan to follow up the task a bonnie
young girl with a slightly freckled face had set him to do.</p>

<p>He washed up the pannikins and plates and tidied up the camp,
peopling it once more with the memory of the bright friendly
faces that had lately been there, one in particular; Bell had
evidently made a conquest.</p>

<p>His domestic duty finished, he took his old double-barrel,
stuck his tomahawk in his belt and after patting the old dog went
off again to the track. Slowly and patiently he followed it for
nearly a mile, then he came to an insurmountable block. The faint
worn-out clue stopped at the foot of a precipitous cliff which
formed the cap of the range.</p>

<p>Dan looked to right and left, but could see no means of
ascent. He went back a short distance and looked upward. The
cliff was about fifty feet in height, and about half-way up it
was broken by a projecting ledge. The wall at the back of this
ledge he could not see for the projection of the ledge itself,
and if he stepped back still further the foliage of the trees
shut out his view. A conviction began to grow on him that there
was a cave, and that the entrance was on that seemingly
inaccessible ledge.</p>

<p>The ledge on either hand merged, after a time, into the smooth
face of the cliff. If there was a cave there the means of access
was either from the top or the bottom, and one way looked as
impossible as the other. He was active for his age, and selecting
the tallest tree opposite to where he supposed the entrance to
exist he took his tomahawk, and cutting a few steps, blackfellow
fashion, in the trunk was soon up amongst the branches.</p>

<p>The foliage, however, still obstructed his view, and it was
not until he had chopped down one or two boughs that he had a
clear opening. He was now not far off the level of the ledge he
had been looking at, and able to see almost to the base of the
cliff that rose from it and there was a cleft, a fissure or
aperture of some kind.</p>

<p>But how had the mythical marauder reached his eyrie? By a rope
either from the top to the cave, or from the cave to the ground?
Hardly. In either case the rope would have to be left suspended
there, and it would be rank folly to have a trail leading to a
cliff on which hung a rope pointing' out the whereabouts of the
cavern.</p>

<p>Dan, perched in the highest fork of the tree, pondered over
all the possibilities of the case; he was a shrewd old bushman,
and not easily thrown off a scent. He descended and followed the
trail to where it died out within a short distance of the cliff,
then he looked back at the tree he had ascended, and it struck
him that the entrance he had seen was a considerable distance to
the right of where he then stood.</p>

<p>Determined to solve the riddle, he made a plain mark on the
rock immediately opposite the termination of the track, and then
re-ascended the tree. The cave was nearly fifty or sixty feet to
the right of the mark. This was conclusive. The ascent and
descent had certainly not been made by means of a rope, otherwise
the pad would have stopped immediately beneath the cave.</p>

<p>He went back once more and looked around. Close to his feet he
at last noticed the stump of an old tree burnt to the ground. He
traced it up in imagination. If it leaned towards the cliff at
all in the former days of its life, it would have afforded a
means of access to the ledge, thence along the ledge to the cave.
But this would have been as palpable a hint as a dangling rope.
Dan examined the stump once more. It was a ring only; the ring of
the shell of an old, old tree. He had got it, he firmly
believed.</p>

<p>The tree had been a shell when the outcast had used it as a
stairway. It had been broken off short by wind or lightning, and
the top did not reach nearly to the height of the ledge; the
distance between the top of the riven trunk and the ledge could
be bridged by a short ladder. When the occupant descended he
would drop the ladder into the hollow shell during his absence;
when he re-ascended he would carry it with him to the cave. Why,
it was as easy as shelling peas. If anybody climbed the shell it
was too close to the ledge for him to see the cave, and not close
enough to get on to the ledge without assistance. Dan went home
to his camp well satisfied.</p>

<p>'The little missy,' he reflected, 'would never have found it
out by herself. She'd never have thought of the tree, and if she
had she couldn't have climbed it.'</p>

<p>Dan's next move was obviously to go in and get a rope and
lower himself from the top on to the ledge. He had no intention
of anticipating Bell in her examination of the mysterious cave,
but be must see that it was all safe for her to go there first;
but he did not carry out this plan for a day or two, he had some
preparations to make first.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p class="first">
NO break in the iron drought, no sign of bountiful,
rain-giving clouds mustering up to shed their team over the
parched land. Bush fires were ravaging the country whereon any
grass was left, and horses were kept saddled at the principal
stations ready for men to mount and ride and protect a threatened
paddock or line of fencing. Still the Oasis kept a little verdure
about it, and old Chevalier was beginning to pick up in flesh and
put on frisky airs of colthood which should have been long since
forgotten.</p>

<p>In spite of the surrounding desolation, of perishing stock,
fast sinking dams and tanks and a general shadow of impending
bankruptcy, it was a halcyon time for Winnie. Her father was home
for a long spell, and the vitality of youth and its enjoyment of
the present was strong within her. Bell was plunged in mystery;
that was the only drawback. Instead of confiding to Winn all her
hopes and aspirations regarding the great discovery of the
outlaw's cave, Dan the Hatter was now her confidant, and he made
several journeys to the station, and took away various tools used
in bush carpentering jobs. Winn was put off with the assurance
that a marvellous surprise was in store for her, and one that
would completely take the scepticism out of brother Dick.</p>

<p>Reggie Blacklock was at feud with his relatives. A sitting of
the Land Board had been held, and the selection applied for by
both Rossiter and Blacklock of course granted to the prior
application of the former. This led to a sharp passage of arms
between the two, Blacklock accusing Rossiter of selecting over
his head, to which Rossiter in strong language informed him that
he was actually engaged in pacing the boundaries when Blacklock
came up. There was still further confusion in the Blacklock camp
when Reggie stood up for the villain Rossiter. The land, he said,
was open to anybody who applied first for it To which the old
man, who, with his acquisition of station property, had adopted
rabid conservatism, roared in reply, 'What does he mean by going
against his own order, and standing by that old pauper
Grainger?'</p>

<p>To this his undutiful son returned that Grainger was of
Rossiter's order, and that the Blacklock family were only raw
recruits. The old man nearly disinherited him on the spot, but
the storm passed for a time. The drought threatened to ruin
Blacklock, directly and indirectly. It was too late to save his
stock by travelling, and he had nowhere to send them to, even if
they could have staggered off the run.</p>

<p>Indirectly, the trade of the whole colony was affected, and
other investments, in which he was largely interested, were
tottering to their fall. Moreover, bills incurred by his two
sons, particularly the elder one, began to come by every mail
with alarming frequency from Sydney and Melbourne. No wonder his
wraith was aroused at Reggie's defection to the enemy. Lee had
proved but a leaky vessel. Blacklock had got hold of him, and
found out about the supposed silver lode. In his own name and
those of his sons he took up mineral leases on the presumed run
of the lodes, outside of the boundary of the selection he had
vainly made an attempt to secure.</p>

<p>Others followed him, for mining is the national Australian
craze; parties were started out prospecting, and the quietness of
the gully above the head of the Oasis was broken with the noise
of pick and shovel, and disfigured with unsightly mounds of
earth!</p>

<p>Rossiter held his hand. The samples he had sent down had not
resulted as well as was expected, and the assay only showed a
return that would barely cover working expenses. Silver, too, was
steadily falling.</p>

<p>'Let them do the prospecting, and&mdash;pay the expense of
it,' he said to Grainger, with a chuckle. 'Whichever way it turns
up, we must profit by it If the true lode is struck worth
working, we have it on our ground; if it all turns out a duffer,
why, the selection is worth the money spent.'</p>

<p>Grainger assented pleasantly. Work and worry were beginning to
tell upon him, and he was glad of the quiet rest and the support
of his energetic young friend. Although by no means a man who
wore his heart upon his sleeve, Rossiter had long ago offered to
assist him; but Grainger had planned has own life, and while he
did not mind the coarsest of fare and roughest of company, his
fastidious nature shrank from the burden of an unpayable monetary
debt of gratitude, even as delicately offered as Rossiter managed
to convey it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dry weather continued, and old Dan had nearly
completed his preparations for the grand exploration of the cave.
By the aid of a rope, he had lowered himself from the top of the
cliff, easily accessible by another route, on to the ledge, and
thence to the entrance of the cave. As a man of many and varied
experiences, ne knew a little about most outside things, and the
exploration of underground passages amongst others. At the
entrance he lit two candles, and, holding one in each hand,
advanced a step or two into the narrow entrance.</p>

<p>He jumped back with a real start of alarm. On either hand
grim, fantastic figures seemed to grin and mock at him, and a
moment afterward there was a sweeping flutter of wings, low and
subdued, and myriads of forms circled and danced before him, and
brushed his face with soft, repulsive, unnatural wings. He
stepped back hastily, almost forgetting the ledge, and a fall of
twenty-five feet from it. Then he recovered, himself.</p>

<p>'Bats you old fool,' he muttered, 'and niggers' drawings.'</p>

<p>He advanced boldly, the ghostly-winged inhabitants, disturbed
by his light, flitting round and round, afraid to venture into
the strong sunlight. Holding the candle up, he saw that he was in
a good-sized cavern, the walls embellished with the pigment
figurings of the now vanished aboriginals, priceless to an
ethnologist. Dan had seen many of them in his travels, and, as
works of art, regarded them with contempt. Save for the nauseous
odor of the bats, the air was fresh and good. Dan retreated.</p>

<p>With the rough chivalry of an untutored nature whose life had
been spent in a long, solitary commune with Nature in her
glorious primeval moods, he had decided that to Bell belonged the
honor of being the first to explore this, as yet, unknown
retreat. It was only for him to make a safe and easy means of
ascent for her. It was impossible to ask a young lady of her
years to 'shin down a rope,' as he, an old sailor could do. It
was necessary to make a safe stairway to the spot. So, for this
reason, he got the necessary tools from Carlingford, and in
course of time had a rough but perfectly secure ladder, with a
hand-rail, constructed and fixed at an easy angle to the ledge.
Meanwhile, it was terrible work for Bell to keep her curiosity in
check.</p>

<p>At last the day arrived, and Bell rode away early, full of
importance. Dan was awaiting her, and, the girls riding and Dan
walking, they were soon at the foot of the cliff. Leaving Dan to
fasten her pony to a tree, she was about to make the ascent, when
he loudly called to her to stop. Remembering the start the bats
had given him, and fearing that she might step back over the
ledge, he insisted on her waiting until he was ready to follow
close behind her; then the start commenced.</p>

<p>Standing at the entrance of the cave, they lit their candles
and advanced. Once more the noiseless inhabitants welcomed them,
but Bell had been warned and did not feel alarmed. The grotesque
tracings on the rocky sides were duly examined, and then
commenced the serious and important search for any trace of the
legendary occupant.</p>

<p>At first they were unsuccessful, and, as the cavern extended
back some considerable distance, the work took time. What they at
last found was not of much value, an old stirrup iron and an
equally old pistol, made for percussion caps. This was not much,
but Bell was very proud of it, as it proved the truth of her long
and fondly cherished belief; henceforth Dick the sceptic would
not be able to hold his head up for shame.</p>

<p>They went back to the opening and looked forth. There had been
a splendid view from the flat rock where they had first met Don,
and it was far more extended where they then stood; but it was
haze and smoke everywhere. The earth seemed like a smouldering
fire beneath them. Bell and Dan sat down and ate some
refreshments they had brought with them. The old hatter was as
delighted as the young girl with their success.</p>

<p>The meal finished, they resumed their explorations, and peered
into every nook and cranny, but were not rewarded for their
trouble. Then they returned to Dan's camp, and, very dirty and
happy, Bell started home, with the precious pistol and
stirrup-iron safely tied to the 'D' of her saddle.</p>

<p>Halfway across one of the paddocks she saw a horseman
approaching, and, to her surprise, recognised Reggie Blacklock.
She greeted him somewhat haughtily, conscious that she was rather
soiled and untidy; but the youth seemed so anxious to propitiate
her, and spoke so nicely of her brother (Dick was the idol of his
family) that she relented a little, and graciously shook hands
with him when they separated. Then she cantered home to,
metaphorically, bring Dick to his knees.</p>

<p>Reggie's errand to Rossiter had been a delicate one. No less
than to solicit a billet on his western station, where he would
really have a chance of learning something about station
management. Reggie was tired of the home bickering and wrangling;
he was tired of the Sydney and Melbourne racketing. He felt some
more worthy ambition stirring within him, and felt that if he
ever wanted to stand well in Bell's bright eyes he must change
his mode of life.</p>

<p>Approaching Rossiter on the present footing of the two
families was a difficult task, but Reggie managed it somehow, and
once the ice was broken; he explained, fairly lucidly, what he
desired.</p>

<p>Rossiter was puzzled. He did not dislike the young fellow, and
would gladly have helped him; but it looked like taking sides in
a private family quarrel, and he was the last man to do that. He
told Reggie that if he would ride over in a couple of days he
would give him an answer, meaning in the interim to take
Grainger's advice on the matter. The western station was managed
by a cousin of his, a thoroughly competent, practical man, and he
felt that a year or two under such tuition would probably be the
making of the young man.</p>

<p>Reggie rode homewards in good spirits. He had made his peace
with Rossiter, Bell had condescended to smile on him, and he
would see her again perhaps in a couple of days. The successful
explorer had a complete triumph, although Dick made a villainous
pretence of believing that old Dan procured the pistol and
stirrup-iron and planted them there to please her&mdash;a
suggestion which nearly reduced her to tears of indignation.</p>

<p>Everybody in turn visited the bushranger's cave, and the news
of its discovery spread to the neighbouring township, much to
Dan's disgust, whose solitude was invaded and his jealousy
aroused, for he looked on the cave as Bell's properly, and
resented the intrusion of visitors as trespassers, and had
serious thoughts of destroying the ladder.</p>

<p>He had, however, one great satisfaction. Whenever a party had
visited the cave, and, according to the custom of the vulgar
Anglo-Saxon all over the world, had inscribed their obscure names
or initials on some prominent part, he carefully erased them
again; and when some more ambitious youth attempted to put his
name on a conspicuous place on the cliff and fell down and broke
three ribs and his collar-bone Dan rejoiced with unholy joy,
although he bandaged the sufferer up and helped him home.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p class="first">
WHEN Reggie reached the paternal station be found Lee there,
and his father and brother in a high state of elation. The lode
had been struck, and Old Blacklock was announcing his intentional
of proceeding to Melbourne forthwith, and floating a company. His
affability had returned with a prospect of deliverance from his
financial troubles, and he greeted his son as though difference
was forgotten, and on his side, forgiven. In imagination, he was
already trampling on the vanquished form of Rossiter.</p>

<p>Some of the richest specimens were obtained, and the old man
started for Melbourne, snuffing the battle of company promoting,
for the game was familiar to him, and he had formerly made more
or less dishonest money at it Before Blacklock started Reggie
obtained permission to go on an extended trip to the west to gain
experience. So the other son, Vernon, was left in charge of
Rotta-rotta and its dying flocks, and he duly celebrated the
occasion.</p>

<p>Bell was much more gracious the next time Reggie called.
Rossiter had consented to the arrangement, and when Bell found
that her brother asked him to stay to lunch, and was going to
assist him to get on independently, she affected to take some
interest in his conversation.</p>

<p>'But he's not nearly so nice nor entertaining as old Dan,' she
owned afterwards.</p>

<p>Reports of Blacklock's progress were duly wired to the
township and published in the local newspaper, and the
inhabitants began to put fancy prices on their allotments.
Presently an expert arrived, who was rumored to be the most
scientific metallurgist on the continent, and who was certainly
an accomplished whisky-drinker.</p>

<p>So clever was he that the most superficial examination
sufficed, and he returned to the township and wrote out a
marvellous report extolling the value and surpassing richness of
the find in language of Oriental fervor. The promoters were
joyous, and some capitalists were prepared to invest largely on
condition that an expert of their own sending reported on the
property. This was agreed to, and expert No. 2 went up. He was a
silent man, and remained some days on the workings. Then he sent
down a report which simply blew the whole concern kite-high. The
lode was of no size, and unreliable; the geological surroundings
were not favorable; the yield would not pay half the
expenses.</p>

<p>Blacklock was utterly ruined. The shares he held in other
speculations were unsalable; his creditors, who had been holding
back during the booming of the lode, now closed in on him, and
his fall was complete and headlong. He wrote to his son Vernon to
hand over the station to whoever was sent up by the mortgagees,
and then come down with his mother. Then he set himself down to
see if he could not rescue something from the wreck.</p>

<p>Vernon had been drinking heavily. When his father's letter
arrived he was on the verge of <i>delirium tremens</i>, and the
message of ruin unseated his reason. He got up early one morning,
prepared to carry out a scheme of vengeance that through many
sleepless nights tortured with hideous visions had been maturing
in his crazed brain.</p>

<p>The morning was breaking sultry and sullen when he mounted and
rode away, laughing to himself in a mad, mirthless manner. A hot
wind commenced to blow; it was the very day for his purpose; the
mortgagees might take delivery of lines of ruined fences and a
scorched area of charred ground. He was methodical in his
insanity, and marked out the line of destruction he intended to
start. True, the paddocks were comparatively grassless, but with
the fallen leaves and bark and a strong hot wind the fire would
travel and accomplish his purpose of destroying the remaining
stock and the fences.</p>

<p>The men on Rotta-rotta, on Carlingford, and the dwellers at
the Oasis saw a black cloud of smoke rising and coming angrily
towards them. All possible precaution against the invasion had
long since been taken, and would have sufficed against an
ordinary fire, but this approaching conflagration was of such
formidable extent and backed up by a fierce rising wind that it
threatened to overleap all obstacles and consume everything
before it.</p>

<p>The forest was ablaze; the foliage, dried by months of sun and
hot winds, shrivelled, scorched, and crackled, then took fire as
the advancing flames passed beneath them; all hollow and pipey
trees caught at once, and the fire roared up aloft through their
trunks, and spouted redly from every hollow limb above. The
madman had done his work well.</p>

<p>On Rotta-rotta the men soon gave up all hopes of doing
anything but saving the homestead itself, and this they barely
succeeded in doing by dint of exhausting labor. The Oasis
escaped; the long stretch of bare and cleared country around it
turned the fire, and it went on, leaping up the range, raging and
rioting amongst the dried ferns and bushes and the more
inflammable trees.</p>

<p>Then Grainger mounted Chevalier, and rode over the smoking
ground to see how Carlingford had fared. There ample precautions
had been taken, but it required all the incessant labor of
Rossiter and every man and boy on the place to hold the enemy at
bay; in fact, much precious grass had to be offered up, a burnt
offering, to make a gap to prevent the assailing flames from
gaining foothold.</p>

<p>'Angie!' called out Rossiter to has eldest sister, who, with
the women, was carrying water to the perspiring and hard worked
men. 'Why does not Bell come and help? Send Winnie, too, if she's
there.'</p>

<p>He spoke somewhat irritably, for he was heated with his
exertions.</p>

<p>'Bell and Winnie went up the range early this morning,'
replied his sister.</p>

<p>'Good God! What folly.' He glanced towards the range, and saw
the fire commencing to ascend the base.</p>

<p>'Dan will look after them,' he said; 'he's too old a hand to
be caught.'</p>

<p>'Dan passed here, going into the township early this morning,'
replied Angie.</p>

<p>Rossiter struck his thigh with his fist. He was on horseback,
having just returned from a threatened outpost. He looked around.
The fire had been turned, and was now well nigh past them. His
overseer could see to it. Giving some short instructions to his
sister to convey to him, he started to race the fire up the
range.</p>

<p>The divergence caused by the Carlingford paddocks had divided
the fire into two bodies. They were again travelling towards each
other, and if he could get through the gap before the two fires
met he would be in time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he was well mounted on a strong horse, and as he
raced and scrambled on, up and up his hopes began to rise; the
fires were travelling fast, but he was outpacing them. It was a
neck and neck race. There was but little room between him and the
threatening enemy closing in on each side when he shot out and
let his horse break into a trot and get his wind after the
desperate up-hill burst. He first made for Dan's camp, but it was
quite untenanted. The girls had taken the old dog with them for a
ramble.</p>

<p>The bushranger's cave was his next goal, and he set off along
the now plainly marked track, the fire, roaring in his ear.
Half-way there he espied the girls ahead. Evidently they had been
frightened; and were hiding to the cave for refuge.</p>

<p>He shouted to them, and increased his pace. They turned, and
as they did so his horse blundered on a rock, and fell heavily,
coming on his rider's leg. As Bell and Winnie raced up to fright,
the horse, a spirited animal, regained its feet, and with, a
snort of alarm galloped madly homeward right in the direction of
the advancing fire. Rossiter attempted to get up, but fell back
with a groan. His leg was broken below the knee. The affrighted
girls slipped from their saddles and bent over him, and the
roaring and crackling of the flames drew ominously closer.</p>

<p>'Go to the cave quick,' cried Rossiter.</p>

<p>'What! And leave yon here?' said Winnie; 'Never.'</p>

<p>'Try and help me up, them.' They stooped on each side of him,
and passing an arm around their young shoulders he got on to his
feet or rather one foot 'Bell, we must make a chair, with our
hands and carry Mm. We are strong enough.'</p>

<p>With a hand and wrist grasp they mode a seat in the well-known
manner, and with their heavy burden managed to stumble slowly and
painfully towards the cliff, with the dread pursuer at their
heels. Fortunately the wind lulled a little, and it was with a
heartfelt sigh of relief that the exhausted girls put their heavy
patient down at the foot of the steps. Now was the difficulty of
mounting before them, but Rossiter solved that.</p>

<p>'Put me up with my back against the rungs,' he said. 'Now, you
two run up and get Dan's rope, and lower it down to me, then both
of you must hang on to it like grim death, as far back from the
edge as you can get, for if I pull hard I might pull one of you
over the edge. Hurry, now, or we shall be roasted yet.'</p>

<p>Slowly, rung by rung, with the aid of his sound leg and the
help of the rope held in the willing but cramped and strained
hands of the girls, he reached the ledge, and was hauled into the
cave just as the fire swept up to the cliff and died down.</p>

<p>Still the smoke was dense, and they were in danger of
suffocating, but it passed and a friendly change of wind gave
them some relief. The ponies had trotted away towards one end of
the cliff, and doubtless would eventually find their way home.
Rossiter lay back with his head on his sister's lap. He was
feverish, and getting thirsty.</p>

<p>'As soon as it clears a bit I will go down to Dan's camp and
get some water for you,' said Bell. 'Wasn't it lucky, Winn, we
let the dear old dog go.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Winnie, 'But I'll go for the water, Bell; you
stop and look after your brother.'</p>

<p>'Don't trouble,' said Rossiter. 'Some of the men will be here
directly; they are sure to have got horses and followed me.'</p>

<p>But Winn was already at the mouth of the cave. The ladder was
intact, for it had been put on a flat patch of rock. Winnie went
down, and along the track to the camp.</p>

<p>'Look out for falling trees!' had been the last caution
Rossiter had shouted to her, so she went carefully avoiding any
she saw still on fire. She was close to the camp when she was
startled by a dismal wail proceeding from it. A long, melancholy
howl. Dan's old dog must have dodged the fire among the rocks and
returned to the deserted camp, but she had never heard him howl
like that before. The camp had been swept bare by the fire; on
the edge of where it had been, lay two forms, a man and horse,
struck down by the falling limb of a tree; beside sat the old dog
with upraised head, giving tongue to a mournful dirge.</p>

<p>Winn hastily approached, and as she stooped in horror, the dog
licked her hand and howled once more. Death had been, mercifully
instantaneous. The man's face was calm and peaceful. It was her
father and old Chevalier. His life of abnegation was ended.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p class="first">
ROSSITER and Bell waited patiently in the cave for Winn's
return. Time passed, and Rossiter grew anxious.</p>

<p>'We ought not to have let her go,' he said, fretfully. Almost
immediately a man's shout was heard below. Bell went to the
entrance and answered it. The man, who was Carter, the overseer,
rode up.</p>

<p>'Seen anything of your brother, Miss Bell?' he cried out,
hastily dismounting, and running up the steps.</p>

<p>'Yes, he is here, but he has broken his leg.'</p>

<p>Carter came in and spoke to Rossiter.</p>

<p>'There's been a bad accident,' he said. 'Mr. Grainger and his
horse, killed by a limb on Dan's camp.'</p>

<p>'And his daughter? Have you seen her?'</p>

<p>'Yes; we found her in a faint beside him, with the old dog
licking her face and howling.'</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Grainger reached Carlingford he found the work of defence
ended, and the fire under command. He was talking to Angela
Rossiter, who was about to tell him of her brother's guest, when
a cry of alarm came from some of the men.</p>

<p>A riderless horse cleared the fence, and came racing up
snorting with terror. It was Rossiter's horse. Its knees were cut
and bleeding, its mane singed, and its nostrils black with ashes.
The reins were broken and one stirrup-leather gone. Angela burnt
out crying, and the men started down the home paddock to bring up
what horses were in.</p>

<p>'The horse may have got away from him,' said Grainger
soothingly to Angela; 'don't say anything to your mother just
now.'</p>

<p>'Where did he go to?' he said to Carter, who stood by him with
a bridle in his hand.</p>

<p>'After the young ladies. They went up the range this morning,
and he went up when it was on fire, to look after them.'</p>

<p>'Come after me as soon as ever you can,' said Grainger, and
mounting Chevalier he rode quickly away to Dan's camp, then to
the cave. That was the way Rossiter would have taken, and he
might be lying in agony under a burning log unable to move.</p>

<p>Chevalier breasted the range gaily, and the bare spot around
Dam's camp was soon in sight. The fire had cleared the place, and
he was close to it when there was a loud crack overhead.
Chevalier gave a startled jump forward, right underneath the
falling limb, and man and horse died together. Carter soon
assembled the searchers; litters were made, and Rossiter and the
dead body of Grainger carried to their respective homes. The next
day steady rain set in, and in a fortnight the grass was
springing green on the mound that covered Grainger.</p>

<p><br>
POOR Winnifred had a hard lot laid on her young shoulders.
Grainger's death had to be kept from the sick woman for the news
might bring on another stroke; so she had to hide her grief, and
appear as usual when with her mother.</p>

<p>The future looked black enough. The slender and intermittent
income earned by her father's weary toil had just sufficed to
keep them; and the prospect ahead was now a poor one. She felt
sick at heart; and grew pale and thin.</p>

<p>Bell, too, was changed. Both girls blamed themselves for what
had happened, for if they had taken heed of the fire approaching
they could have been home long before it reached the foot of the
range.</p>

<p>But Winnie had now another trouble to meet Her mother seemed
to get brighter in her intellect, and demanded to see her
husband. No excuses would suffice; if away, he must be sent for,
and at once. The truth, or part of it, had to be broken to
her.</p>

<p>At first it did not affect her as badly as they expected. She
asked to see his grave, round which, by Rossiter's orders, a
light iron rail had been placed and a stone put at the head. She
was assisted to it, and gazed on the spot with tearless eyes.</p>

<p>Next morning, when Winnie visited her at daylight, she was
dead, and they buried her beside her husband.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Rossiter came over, and insisted on the lonely girl
coming to Carlingford to stop with them.</p>

<p><br>
TIME worked its cure, and Bella and she regained something of
their old spirits. Rossiter's break healed up well and sound, and
life went on as usual. Vernon Blacklock had been found a hopeless
lunatic, and removed to an asylum; but of his brother favorable
reports came in.</p>

<p>An important festival was approaching&mdash;nothing less than
Bella's birthday. Old Dan, who had restored his demolished camp,
came in on the morning of the auspicious day.</p>

<p>'Miss Bell,' he said, drawing her on one side, 'you remember
my telling you I wanted to have the pick of the watches to make a
present to a young woman I knew?'</p>

<p>'I do, Dan. And I've felt very curious to see her.'</p>

<p>'Well, Miss Bell, here's the watch, and&mdash;here's the young
woman.'</p>

<p>Drawing forth a veritable old 'turnip,' be gravely presented
it to her.</p>

<p>'Oh, Dan!' cried Bell, 'Did this really and truly come from
the cave?'</p>

<p>'It did, and I found it there, luckily before all them
jackeroos come poking around. I would have given it to you
before, but, you see, it was that very day that all the trouble
happened that I took it in to the township to be cleaned and
fixed up. So I've scarcely had the heart to look at it since, for
if I'd a been here, Mr. Rossiter would have trusted to me, and
not have come looking after you; and Mr. Grainger he wouldn't
have come after him.'</p>

<p>'Well, Dan,' said Bell, after a minute's sad silence over 'he
might have been.'</p>

<p>'I shall prize this watch more than any present I shall get I
won't promise to wear it always, because, you see, it's rather
large for a lady; but I'll keep it wound up, and whenever I look
at the time by it I shall think of you.'</p>

<p>'The man said that they were splendid works still,' assured
Dan.</p>

<p>'And Dan,' went on Bell, as they shook hands, 'I can assure
you I am very proud of being that young woman. I was getting
quite jealous of the creature.'</p>

<p>The gratified old fellow went off chuckling.</p>

<p><br>
THE Oasis is still an oasis, and is neatly kept as ever, but
Mr. and Mrs. Jock are about to move into the cottage, for Winnie
will soon leave it to become Mrs. Rossiter.</p>

<p>Big Harry and his mate long kept a lookout for the queer old
traveller who made their camp so gay one night; but they never
met him, needless to say.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>05. -- ON THE ISLAND OF SHADOWS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 7 Nov 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
THIS is the story told by Eugene Tripot, convict from New
Caledonia, of what happened to him during the boat voyage when he
had succeeded in making his escape.</p>

<p>He died in the hospital at Hong-Kong, insane, having lost his
reason through the suffering and privation he went through on
that occasion.</p>

<p>He had lucid intervals, during which he repeatedly told this
story, and insisted on its truth.</p>

<p>He was rescued from a sandy islet on the outer edge of the
Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Northern Queensland, by a
China steamer taking the outside passage. He had been cast away
there for some weeks, living on trepang and shell-fish.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen to in any way bear out this story.</p>

<p><br>
"THREE of us alone between sea and sky&mdash;three men with a
wolf inside each, wolves that looked at each other out of our
eyes. Gronard crouched in the bottom of the boat, gnawing at a
piece of wood; Pelrine sat at the stern, with his sheath-knife in
his hand, digging savagely at the thwart; I was sitting in the
bow.</p>

<p>"The sail flapped idly at every little swing and roll of the
boat, just as it had flapped during the last fortnight, never
once bellying out.</p>

<p>"Beside us three there was the sun&mdash;the sun that hated us
so. Hot and eager it rose in the morning&mdash;hot and eager to
drink our blood. With anger that we should be still alive, it set
in the evening. Gronard cursed the sun, Pelrine cursed the sun,
and I cursed the sun.</p>

<p>"That was all we did from morning to night. It was all we had
to do. It is bad for men to sit silent all day, only speaking to
curse the sun, for then the wolf rages and breaks out.</p>

<p>"It broke forth in Pelrine, sitting digging his knife in the
thwart, and suddenly he sprang upon Gronard. He would have sprung
upon me, just the same, if I had happened to be next to him, for
it was the wolf that sprung, not Pelrine, for Pelrine was always
a good-hearted man.</p>

<p>"Gronard was taken at a disadvantage, but he was the strongest
of us three, and grappled with Pelrine, and in the struggle the
boat lurched, and both fell over the side. I saw them go down,
down, in the clear water, turning and twisting, and all I thought
was, 'They do not feel the sun down there.'</p>

<p>"They never rose, for I saw what looked like long flashes of
white light dart at them, and I knew that the sharks that had
kept us company so long had them for their sport at last.</p>

<p>"When I raised my head there was a ripple coming fast across
the water. If Pelrine's wolf had not broken out just then both he
and Gronard would be alive now. I went to the tiller and the sail
filled, and the boat moved for the first time for two weeks.</p>

<p>"West was our course&mdash;anywhere west, to the great
continent that reached for two thousand miles north and south.
Merrily blew the wind, and in the evening there were clouds
ahead, and a black thunderstorm flashed and muttered in the
distance. All through the night there was the pleasant rip and
gurgle of water.</p>

<p>"But the wolf gnawed still.</p>

<p>"Morning! and ahead of me I saw white water, but no land. It
mattered little whether I died by the wolf or the wave, and I
kept straight on. As I got closer to the breakers I saw there was
a low, sandy mound visible, with some low bushes growing on it,
and to this I steered.</p>

<p>"The northern side looked to be the smoothest, and I
endeavoured to make that side; for though there was no sea, the
wind having been but light, the sweep and rush of the Pacific
rollers was tremendous, and when they broke upon this submerged
wall of coral and recoiled broken and shattered, the very air
seemed to tremble.</p>

<p>"At the northernmost point of the islet the turmoil seemed
less, though the rollers were as big; but the passage was deep
enough to let them pass through and expend their fury in a sullen
swirl over the flats beyond.</p>

<p>"As I approached I was caught in one of the rollers and swept
on with it, with great force and fury. We mounted on the crest of
it, and then fell with a rush that made me feel sick. Next moment
the boat was dashed on the beach, and I was flung unhurt beside
it.</p>

<p>"Then the roller swept back and left us, the broken boat and
myself, on the sand.</p>

<p>"It was a miserable little patch of dry land indeed, and when
I had rested a little I commenced to examine it, first directing
my steps to the low bushes on the highest part. I found it to be
a ring of scrub surrounding a depression filled with water. I
crashed through the bushes and stooped to drink, scarcely daring
to hope that it would be fresh. It was, or at least fairly so,
for the spray from the breakers drifted over into it.</p>

<p>"I drank, and the wolf was quiet for a bit, while I lay on the
sand and looked around. A line of tossing white ran north and
south&mdash;the line I had passed through&mdash;but to the west
was a still sea, broken here and there in patches of shining
foam, but mostly still, and of light, transparent green colour.
The tide was falling, and by midday there were bare spots of
coral showing.</p>

<p>"I went down and searched for shell-fish, or anything left by
the tide. I found what was better than all&mdash;plenty of the
sea-slugs known as trepang. I soon had a quantity collected, and
having the means of making a fire, I spent the rest of the day in
cooking and eating; and again the wolf crouched for a time.</p>

<p>"That night I slept soundly after the cramped space of the
boat, and when the wolf clamoured at daylight I arose. It was a
strange thing to be standing there alone on that patch of sand,
with the wall of tireless breakers on one side, that looked far
above me, as though when they fell they would overwhelm my
refuge.</p>

<p>"I fed on trepang, and passed the day idly resting, for now I
had tamed the wolf within me. I longed for my companions, but
they were in the bellies of the sharks.</p>

<p>"When darkness came I lay down and slept, but awoke in the
middle of the night, dreaming that I heard strange sounds, I
listened, and at first heard nothing but the boom and crash of
the breakers; but presently I heard low voices and the crunching
tread of feet on the coral sand. I leapt to my feet, but could
see nothing. I called, but got no answer; and still, distinctly,
I heard the sound of voices and the tread of feet.</p>

<p>"I hastily traversed the island, but saw nothing, only at
times I heard the voices talking, and though I called and called
again, none answered me. Then there was silence, and plainly I
heard the click and grind of steel meeting steel, the tramp, and
quickened breathing of two combatants; and still I saw
nothing.</p>

<p>"Suddenly the clashing came quicker and sharper, as though
there was a hotly-contested rally, and following it came a fall
on the sand, and then a cry in a woman's voice, and a peal of
musical laughter. There was low whispering, and the steps died
away, heavy and slow, as though they carried a burden, and then
there was no sound but the thunder of the tireless billows.</p>

<p>"I scarcely felt frightened&mdash;I had been living far too
long hand in hand with death. I felt curious, and if terrified at
all it was more at the idea that it had been a fancy of my
brain&mdash;that it was my wits were failing me, for I knew well
that loneliness serves some men thus.</p>

<p>"All was quiet for the remainder of the night, and in the
morning there were no signs nor tracks of any person but
myself.</p>

<p>"Now, although I heard the voices, the tongue that they spoke
in was strange to me, but I thought it was Spanish, from the way
that I had heard old comrades of mine talk together who were
Spaniards.</p>

<p>"Next night the ghosts were there again, and once more the
duel, as I took it, was fought on that solitary speck of sand in
the great ocean, to the music of the surf.</p>

<p>"That was a strange, unreal life&mdash;by day to pace the
sandy shore and listen to the waves, and talk to myself, or
gather and cook the trepang that supported me; by night to hear
the crunch of the sand under unseen feet, and the quick clash of
the blades. But stranger still was to come.</p>

<p>"I bethought me, from what information I had gathered, that
this reef was the great reef that lay off the coast of
Queensland, and that inside, between it and the mainland, ships
and steamers were constantly passing up and down.</p>

<p>"My boat was too shattered to admit of my trusting myself in
it to the ocean, but could I not patch it up sufficiently to
carry me in the still-water channels of the reef? I would only
have to keep due west to come out somewhere on the edge of the
frequented passage.</p>

<p>"To this end I took to exploring the reef westward as far as I
could go during low tide. The second day I came across a
submerged object lying on the edge of a deep channel&mdash;the
wreck of a ship. At low water it was partly uncovered, and the
gaunt ribs showed above the surface for some height. It was an
ancient hulk, encrusted with marine growth and barnacles. Only
the heart of the timber remained; but that was as hard as
flint.</p>

<p>"They built stout ships in the days when she left her bones
there. She was firmly wedged on the ledge of a reef, and must
have been carried to where she lay in some tempest of
extraordinary fury. How many years had she been there, and of
what nation she was, I had no means of judging just then.</p>

<p>"But day after day I visited her, and in time found that out;
I mustered courage to dive down and examine her below the
water-mark of low tide. It was not the depth that required
courage, but strange things had found their home amidst the
waving growth around her. The banded yellow and black sea-snakes
of those parts swam in and out, hideous shell-fish with staring
eyes and long feelers hid amongst the beams, and, for aught I
knew, some loathsome octopus might be lurking in his lair
there.</p>

<p>"I pushed on farther and farther by degrees, until I found
many casks still preserving their shape and outline, having
something within that was of great weight. I burst one open, and
inside was tarnished metal so covered with growth and slime that
it was impossible to say what it was. After many efforts I broke
off a portion of it to examine at my leisure. It was a lump of
silver dollars, welded together by marine growth, and discoloured
by long submergence.</p>

<p>"I sat aghast at the thought of all those casks there being
filled with coin&mdash;silver coin&mdash;ay, and why not some of
them gold? I stood ankle deep in the salt water and looked
around. A sea of light and shadow, calm and glassy, of
ever-changing colour. Beyond, the restless tossing wall of white
froth and foam.</p>

<p>"I had wealth&mdash;all I desired of it&mdash;in my grasp; and
this was my domain.</p>

<p>"Was ever man so situated? When my turn came to die, should I
join those ghosts on the isle, who must have been the men who
sailed on this treasure-ship. There was blood on these coins,
else why were they here, why was that nightly duel fought, what
brought this ship so far south of her course?</p>

<p>"I returned to the island and cleaned the coins I held,
scrubbed them with sand, and picked them apart with the knife
that Pelrine had dropped when he went overboard. They were
Spanish dollars, dated 1624 and a few years later.</p>

<p>"In successive journeys I examined some more of the casks, and
found that one smaller one was full of gold, and doubtless there
were more. It was better they should remain where they were,
safer in every way, until I found a way out of my present
position. Such a position in every way. With untold riches lying
beneath a few feet of salt water of no more value than the
leagues of coral north and south of me.</p>

<p>"And if I escaped and gained my fellow men, of what avail
would be my treasure to an escaped convict, who might at any
moment be seized and returned to the living death I had fled
from. My wealth alone would draw notice to me if I sought to
enjoy it. At any rate, I determined to try and escape. I could
decide afterwards about the treasure. Perhaps I should be able to
purchase my freedom with some of it.</p>

<p>"I determined to wait till the moon was full (it being then
half), as it would enable me to make use of the low tide at all
hours, and it would also allow me time to patch up my boat, which
I commenced to overhaul that day.</p>

<p>"I slept soundly the first part of the night, and awoke as
usual at the tread of the ghosts. The moon hung low in the west,
and I saw&mdash;yes, saw that night the apparitions that haunted
that tiny isle.</p>

<p>"The night was clear, save for some angry-looking clouds in
the cast, and the setting moon shone with spectral light over the
still, shallow waters of the reef. The tide was low, and the
passage I had passed through practicable for a well-manned boat
with a skilful steersman.</p>

<p>"But was it the ghosts I saw? Half a mile out, or less, lay a
ship with lights both in her rigging and streaming through her
ports. A boat lay off the edge of the island, and I thought I
heard another rowing in from the ship.</p>

<p>"I had no fear, and approached the group gathered on the sand.
They were talking seriously, and, though the language was the
same as I had always heard, I could now understand every word as
though it was my own.</p>

<p>"They took no notice of me as I came near; I spoke to them,
but received no answer; I laid my hand on one's arm, and I did
not feel him. My sense of touch was dead, my voice was inaudible,
my presence invisible. For the time being we had changed places,
and the ghosts were the substantial beings and I the impalpable
shape.</p>

<p>"There were five of them, all richly dressed in the fashion of
two hundred years ago. One was an elderly man of dignified
appearance, and the other, who seemed his opponent, was a very
handsome young gallant.</p>

<p>"'Before we meet, Don Herrera, and I send your soul to keep
company with those of all the traitors since Judas hung himself,'
said the elder man in a voice of deep hate, 'I would say
something that these gentlemen may remember concerning you.</p>

<p>"'You, a trusted officer of his Majesty, have tampered with
the marines of my ship. You tempted them to mutiny, but your vile
plot was discovered, and your dupes hung on the yardarm, where
you, too, would be hung, King's officer though you be, and noble
to boot, but that I reserved you for my own hand.</p>

<p>"'You, who came on my ship as an honoured guest, honoured on
account of your standing as my Master's officer, although I knew
you for a ruined profligate.</p>

<p>"'You, in your greed for the gold and silver in yon ship,
conspired against me, led weak men on to their death, and, above
all, sought to dishonour me in a way that only death will wipe
out. I would not slay you on my own deck, for death by my hand
only would suffice, but I vowed that the first dry land we saw
should witness the death of one of us. This spot will serve, and
we need not wait for daylight.</p>

<p>"'I call upon you all to hear that this man is a perjured
traitor, whom I greatly honour by descending to cross swords with
him.'</p>

<p>"The young man answered not, only by an insolent smile, then
tossed his hat down, and drew his sword.</p>

<p>"During the time the captain was speaking the other boat
arrived at the beach, and two people left and came to us, a
priest and a woman. They stopped close to where I was standing,
and I saw the most exquisite face illumined by the level moon
that I ever saw in my life.</p>

<p>"The priest was dressed in the soutane and broad-brimmed hat
of his profession, and looked ill at ease, but his companion
flashed a bold glance from her dark eyes at the younger combatant
that at once told me the guilty secret, and why the captain had
not hung him at the yardarm, but brought him to this patch of
sand to kill him himself.</p>

<p>"The fight commenced, warily and cautiously at first, but the
two men soon warmed to their work, and then I saw the murderous
trick of the young man. He was forcing the old man round, so that
he should face the deceitful glare of the setting moon. Bit by
bit he accomplished his object; then there was a quick, sharp
interchange, and the captain fell, pierced through the body.</p>

<p>"'Bravo!' cried the woman standing by me, and she laughed
merrily.</p>

<p>"I shuddered, and the priest darted from her side and knelt
beside the dying man. He, too, had heard that devilish laugh, and
lifted his head and gazed at his destroyer. He spoke, and his
voice was clear and distinct.</p>

<p>"'Behold the judgment of the wicked is close at hand. The gold
you plotted for shall never be yours; the beauty you lusted for
shall be food for fishes. You shall not linger long behind
me.'</p>

<p>"He fell back, as the edge of the ghostly yellow moon kissed
the water's edge, its dying rays lighting up the scene of horror,
the silent men, the recumbent figure, the dark-robed kneeling
priest, holding on high the crucifix; the white sand gleaming out
from that great waste of water.</p>

<p>"Suddenly a flash of lightning, accompanied by a peal of
thunder, made everyone start. The clouds had banked up in masses
to the east, and were covering the face of the heavens. The party
hurried off to the boats, taking the captain's body with them,
the white breakers were already leaping high, and they quickly
pushed off.</p>

<p>"I watched them as they pulled to the passage, and saw the
rollers rushing towards them. Then the darkness fell, but out of
that darkness rung out cries of despair, and high above all a
woman's shriek, the death-shriek of the woman who had laughed at
her dying husband. Next instant the tempest burst, and caught the
doomed ship. I saw her lights coming closer; saw them, then lost
them; then saw them again, and then I knew that she was in the
breakers.</p>

<p>"They beat her with successive blows, and hurled her into the
passage, a dismasted wreck; hurried her on with the rushing water
as the tempest burst in the blackness and fury inconceivable,
hiding all things from my view.</p>

<p>"I opened my eyes to a soft, balmy morning, and found myself
lying in my usual place on the sand. No sign of the recent storm
was visible, my clothes were dry, the sea calm, and the surf
lower than usual. Bewildered, I looked around, scarcely believing
my eyes. I looked again at the sea, noting how impossible it was
for that to have gone down in an hour or two, and as I looked I
saw a steamer.</p>

<p>"Instantly the uncontrollable longing to see my fellow-men
seized me.</p>

<p>"I made my fire up with a mad haste, piled on it planks torn
from my boat, and branches torn hastily from the bushes. A
straight column of smoke ascended, and I was seen at once. The
steamer stood in, and a boat was lowered. I rushed into the water
to meet it. Fear, such as I had never felt in silent, lonely
nights, overcame me.</p>

<p>"'Take me from the ghosts!' I cried, as I scrambled in the
boat, and fell insensible."</p>

<p><br>
"THIS IS a hospital, and they think me mad but the wreck of
the Spanish ship is there."</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>06. -- MALCHOOK'S DOOM</h2>

<h3>A STORY OF THE NICHOLSON RIVER</h3>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 23 Jan 1892</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was Malchook who told the beginning of this story, and
Malchook was supposed to be the biggest liar in the Gulf of
Carpentaria, which is equivalent to saying that he was the
biggest liar in the world. However, it was on record that he told
the truth sometimes&mdash;when he was in a blue funk, for
instance&mdash;and on this occasion his state of funk was a
dazzling purple&mdash;blue was no name for it.</p>

<p>We were camped on the Nicholson for the wet season. The cattle
had been turned out and we had pretty hard work to keep them
together, for, after the rain set in and the country got boggy,
the niggers commenced playing up and we had to keep going. It was
raining cats and dogs that night and we were all huddled together
round the fire under a bit of a bark lean-to which we had put up.
Malchook was away&mdash;his horses were absent that morning and
he had been away all day after them. It was about eight o'clock
when we heard him coming; he had found his horses and was driving
them right up to the camp. Then, instead of hobbling them, he got
a bridle and a halter, caught them and tied them up to a
tree.</p>

<p>Some of the fellows sang out to him to know what he was doing,
but he took no notice, and, after turning out the horse he had
been riding, came up to the fire and told Reeve (the boss) that
he wanted a word with him. Reeve got up, and the two went over to
his tent. Presently Malchook emerged, went over to where his duds
were under the tarpaulin that had been rigged up over the
rations, and commenced to roll them up. Reeve came back to the
fire.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Thomas, Reeve's cousin.</p>

<p>"Only that fellow wants to leave to-night straight away, so I
gave him his cheque and told him to slide as soon as he liked;
he's no great loss anyway."</p>

<p>"What does he want to leave for?"</p>

<p>"Says the camp is 'doomed,' and he is going to put as many
miles as possible between himself and us before our fate
overtakes us."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh, and just then Malchook came out
with his swag and commenced to saddle up in the pouring rain.
There was a good moon, nearly full, although of course it was not
visible.</p>

<p>The fellows commenced chaffing him, for he was not a
favourite; too all-round a liar. He stood it without a word until
he was ready to mount then he got on his horse and, turning
round, said "Laugh away; this time to-morrow I'll have the laugh
of you; this camp is doomed!" He stuck the spurs in his horse and
disappeared&mdash;<i>swish, swish, swish</i>, through the bog
down the bank of the river, and we heard him swearing at his
pack-horse as he crossed the sand.</p>

<p>There was much laughter and wonderment at what had sent
Malchook "off his chump," but eccentricity was common in those
days, from various causes, and presently we all turned in.</p>

<p>I was sleeping under the tarpaulin where the rations were
stored, and about two o'clock in the morning I suddenly awoke. It
was brilliant moonlight, the wind had changed and the rain
ceased, only a little scud was flitting across the sky, giving
the moon that strange appearance that everybody must occasionally
have noticed&mdash;as though she was travelling at express rate
through an archipelago of cloudlets. Some impulse made me get out
from under the mosquito-net and go to the opening at the end of
the tarpaulin and look out.</p>

<p>Everything was very still and quiet; all the horses were
camped, for not a bell could be heard, and I stood for some time
aimlessly listening and looking at the glistening pools of water
lying on the flat between our camp and the bank when suddenly I
distinctly heard a human voice in the bed of the river. I waited
for a moment to make sure, then I got my Martini and a couple of
cartridges and sneaked towards the river. Last full-moon the
niggers had nearly clubbed the cook in his mosquito-nets when he
was sleeping outside the tent one night; this time, I thought, it
would be a case of the bitten bit.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards from the camp I stopped and listened;
the voice was much nearer, it was a white man's, it was
Malchook's, and he was kicking his knocked-up horse along and
dragging the pack-horse after him. I waited behind a tree until
he was close up, and then I stepped out. I was only in my shirt,
with the carbine in my hand.</p>

<p>"Great God!" he cried, with a kind of choke, "he's here
again!"</p>

<p>"What the devil is up with you?" I said; "why didn't you stop
away when you went? Got bushed, I suppose, and the horses brought
you back?"</p>

<p>He sat on his horse and panted for a few minutes without
speaking; then he said: "That infernal old nigger wouldn't let me
go. He hunted me back. I've got to share your fate, so let's get
it over."</p>

<p>He jabbed his heels in his horse's ribs, but I stopped him.
"Don't wake the camp up," I said. "What nigger do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The nigger that Jacky the Span and I roasted in the spinifex.
He's headed me back every road I've tried, and I give it up. Let
me turn the horses out, and try and get a wink of sleep."</p>

<p>Jacky the Span was an old blackguard of a Mexican who had been
knocked on the head about six months before. Everybody said he
richly deserved it, and everybody was right.</p>

<p>"When were you up here with Jacky Span?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About two years ago; the time Bratten was killed; but let me
turn out the horses and I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>We went quietly back to camp, let the tired horses go, and
then Malchook laid down on his blankets alongside of me. The
tarpaulin was rigged some distance from the other tents, and the
boys were done-up and sleeping sound, so nobody awoke. This is
what Malchook told me:</p>

<p>Two years before, he and the old Mexican had come up to join
Bratten in mustering some horses that had got away from the lower
part of the river and were supposed to be knocking about below
the first gorge. Like most half-breeds, Jacky the Span (short for
Spaniard) was a most inhuman brute towards the natives whenever
he got a chance, and Malchook, being a blowhard and a bully, was
naturally of the same cowardly disposition&mdash;most liars are.
One day they spotted an old man and a young gin at the foot of a
spinifex ridge that runs in on the Upper Nicholson. I knew the
place&mdash;real old man spinifex that would go through a leather
legging. They rounded the old black up on the top of the ridge,
but missed the gin, and Jacky Span said he would make the man
find her or he should suffer, and Malchook, in order to keep up
his reputation as a flash man and a real old Gulf hand, aided and
abetted him.</p>

<p>I suppose the poor devil was too frightened to understand what
they really wanted, but, anyhow, all the half-caste devilry,
which is the worst devilry in the world, was roused in the
Mexican, and Malchook followed suit.</p>

<p>They selected a bank of old man spinifex, and rolled the naked
nigger in it for sport. Now, spinifex is beastly poisonous stuff;
get your shins well pricked, and it is worse than any amount of
mosquito-bites for irritating you and making you itch. Horses
will not face it after a day or two in really bad country, and if
you run your hand down their shins you will soon see the reason
why. Every little prick festers, and their legs are covered with
tiny boils and ulcers after a few days in bad spinifex. The
niggers always burn it ahead of them before they travel through
it. Out in the real Never-Never they have regular tracks that
they keep burnt down.</p>

<p>By the time they had rolled this nigger in the spinifex for
some minutes, he must have been in a raging hell of torment; and
he knew no more what they wanted with him than he did at the
start. Then, according to Malchook, Jacky rolled him into a big
bank of dry stuff&mdash;they had tied his feet together&mdash;and
set fire to it. Spinifex is rare stuff to burn, it is full of
turpentine, and burns with a fierce heat and a black smoke, so
the old nigger was well roasted and when it burnt out they rolled
him into another and set that alight. A gust of wind sprung up
and started the whole ridge ablaze, and the gin, who had been
hidden close by, watching them, sprang out and ran for it, and
Jacky Span picked up the old man's club and took after her. He
was away about half-an-hour; meantime the old fellow died,
groaning awfully, and Malchook began to feel as if he had better
have let things alone.</p>

<p>Presently, Jacky Span came back with the club in his
hand&mdash;big two-handed clubs they use out on the
Nicholson&mdash;and showed Malchook some blood and hair on it,
and laughed like a devil. No need to repeat here all he said.</p>

<p>Now, if Malchook had there and then blown a government road
through the brute, there might have been some chance of
repentance left for him, but he didn't. He sniggered and let
Jacky Span tell him all about it, and camped with him for weeks
afterwards. Jacky Span was killed, as I said before, and Malchook
assured me, in a sweating blue funk when he spoke, that just at
dark he had met his horses coming back, with the old roasted
nigger behind driving them. He went on to say that this thing had
followed him right up to the river and shrieked at him that he
would die in the camp. Then he went on to tell that when he tried
to get away from the camp that night the old nigger had met him
at every point of the compass, so at last he gave it up and came
back.</p>

<p>Now, I knew that there had been an importation of brandy
lately into the Gulf country, generally known as the "possum
brand," each bottle of which was calculated to make a man see
more devils than any six bottles of any other brand. It was very
popular, for it would eat holes in a saddle-cloth, so I concluded
that Malchook had got hold of some of it, for one of the fellows
had returned from Burketown that day. This would account for the
ghost of the blackfellow, but the rest of the yarn about Jacky
Span I knew to be true, so I told Malchook to clear out and sleep
somewhere else&mdash;I wouldn't have him under the same tarpaulin
with me. He begged and prayed to be allowed to remain, but I told
him I would wake the camp and tell everything if he didn't go, so
he went, sobbing bitterly. I explained to him that the best thing
he could do was to shoot himself; that a man who could follow the
lead of a miserable half-caste out of pure flashness was too
contemptible to live, but he didn't appreciate my kindness, and
slouched away to a bit of a sand-hump about 150 yards from the
camp, and I saw him throw his blankets down and then lie down on
them. I got into my bunk again and went fast asleep in two
minutes.</p>

<p>Reeve woke me up. It was broad daylight. "The niggers were
here last night," he said. "Did you hear anything?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "but Malchook came back; I saw him."</p>

<p>"Yes. They knocked him on the head&mdash;bashed his skull in.
He was sleeping out under that tree. I suppose he was ashamed to
wake us up."</p>

<p>"Nobody hear anything?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not a sound. There are the traces of about six niggers coming
out of the river towards the camp, and they must have stumbled
right on top of Malchook. Poor devil! Polished him off and
cleared out. The camp was doomed for him, after all."</p>

<p>I concluded to say nothing, beyond having seen Malchook come
back and speaking to him. Sometimes I wonder whether I was not
responsible for his death by hunting him away from the camp, but
I always console myself with the reflection that he only got what
he deserved.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>07. -- THE RED LAGOON</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 23 April, 1892</h3>

<p class="first">
'WHERE are you going to camp to-night?' asked Mac, the
bullocky, as I stopped to have a yarn for a few minutes, on my
road down from the tableland.</p>

<p>'I was going to push on to the Red Lagoon; there's good feed
there, I hear.'</p>

<p>'Hanged if I'd camp there by myself for any money.'</p>

<p>'Why? Are the blacks bad?'</p>

<p>'No fear, it's the safest place in the North. No nigger will
come within ten miles of it.'</p>

<p>'What's up then; devil-devil?'</p>

<p>'So they say, perhaps you'll see if you camp there tonight. I
had a mate nearly frightened into the horrors there once. It took
nearly a case of whisky to get him straight again. Well, I must
be moving. So long!'</p>

<p>Mac straightened his bullocks up, and I resumed my
journey.</p>

<p>It was sundown when I got to the Red Lagoon&mdash;so called
from a small reddish weed that covered its surface. There was
beautiful feed there, and I felt that all the spooks in the world
should not prevent me turning out for the night and giving my
horses a good show. It was dark before I finished tea, for the
twilights are short in tropical Queensland; I had made up a
comfortable bed of grass and having fixed up everything snug, lay
down for a good smoke. It was a moonless night, and quite calm.
Only for the clink of the hobble chains, the tinkle of the bell,
and an occasional snort from my horses, there was not a sound to
be heard. One has to camp out alone night after night in the bush
to thoroughly appreciate the companionship of a horse. As it grew
a little chilly I poked up the fire, made myself comfortable
under the blankets, and went off into the sleep of the just.</p>

<p>I must have dreamt that I was fighting alligators at the mouth
of the Albert River, and that a fearful splashing was going on;
at least, that was the impression under which I drowsily came to
my senses.</p>

<p>The splashing still continued, however, and came from the
lagoon.</p>

<p>'One of the horses has got in and can't get out,' was my first
thought, and I jumped up and went in the direction of the sound.
All was still when I reached the bank, and by the light of the
stars the surface appeared placid and unruffled. Then, for the
first time, a superstitious thrill went through me, but I soon
shook it off, and, after listening a little longer, I returned to
my camp, renewed the fire, and went to see if my horses were all
right. The tinkle of the bell in the distance guided me to them;
and I found them feeding greedily and contentedly. I remained
with them during the time I smoked the heel of a pipe just to get
myself into a proper 'daylight' frame of mind, then went back to
my blankets.</p>

<p>It was a little while 'ere I went off to sleep, for an owl
gave me a start by suddenly commencing to bark right over my
head. However, I did drop off and dreamt a very strange dream, I
call it a dream, but to me it seemed real enough at the time.</p>

<p>I was awakened, so I thought, once more by the splashing, but
this time I had somehow no inclination to inquire into the cause
of it. Presently it ceased, and I heard something come stumbling
towards my camp. Still I felt neither fear nor any desire to
move. The object came into the circle of light and squatted by
the fire.</p>

<p>It was an elderly white man, with a remarkably long, grey
beard. He was bare-headed, and his shirt and trousers were wet
through and clung to him. But that was not all. His head and
beard were covered with blood, one eye had been smashed in, and
spear-wounds were visible in his cheeks and neck. As to his body,
one could not tell, but his shirt was blood-soaked, and the blood
dripped from his wrists as he held his hands towards the fire. It
was not until I had fully taken in all those details and the
hideously gashed face, with its one eye, looked at me across the
fire, that terror&mdash;unreasoning terror&mdash;over-mastered
me. Then I felt an impulse to yell and jump up, but I was dumb
and powerless. The thing arose, and glaring at me with its single
eye, suddenly rang a furious peal on a horse-bell.</p>

<p>This broke the charm. I started up; it was broad daylight, the
horses had fed back close to camp, and the one with the bell on
was just giving himself a vigorous shake.</p>

<p><br>
'WHAT'S the yarn about the Red Lagoon?' I asked Jack Sullivan,
the super of the station, where I camped next night.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, 'there is a yarn about it, and a very stupid
one, too. Why do you ask, you camped there last night. See
anything?'</p>

<p>I told him I had been awakened by some mysterious splashing in
the lagoon.</p>

<p>'Fish. Lots of big ones there; always jump on dark nights.
This is the yarn, some of it, of course, is true&mdash;it's a
matter of history: You know, this country was settled early in
the sixties, and afterwards abandoned; all the stations thrown up
and the district deserted. This run was one of them, although the
old homestead was in a different place. There was a deuce of a
lot of 'dispersing,' and cattle-killing going on, and the then
manager and some others caught a lot of blacks&mdash;all sorts
and sexes&mdash;at the Red Lagoon, and made short work of the
crowd. The blacks, of course, took to the water and were most of
them shot in it. Now comes in the embroidery. The lagoon was said
to have been quite clear then and has since become covered with
the red weed that gives it its name. A natural process I have
often witnessed where no one has been killed.</p>

<p>'The super, an elderly man, was afterwards killed by the
blacks when camped at the same place. Some of them have since
confessed that he took to the water and that they hunted him from
side to side until he died. Anyhow, it's true that he was found
half in the water, with his head and face frightfully battered,
and spear wounds all over. From what I know of them I should say
that he was knocked on the head when asleep, and that they then
chopped him about and threw his body in the lagoon.'</p>

<p>'Do the blacks ever camp there now?'</p>

<p>'No. But that is not singular. They nearly always shun a place
where they have murdered a white man. I know of many
instances.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>08. -- THE LAST MESSAGE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Sydney, 16 Dec 1899</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE late owner of Dorimount Downs looked sadly over the
somewhat spacious landscape visible from the homestead verandah.
The brand of the drought was over it all, and dead stock, dry
waterholes, and ruin seemed to be written across the face of it.
It was not an inviting outlook, but still he loved it for the
many years of struggle and toil he had spent there trying vainly
to fight an unequal fight against nature.</p>

<p>Now the end had come, the manager for the bank was on his way
up to take over charge, and Dunstan would clear out with a couple
of horses, and a few, very few, pounds in his pocket to start
life again.</p>

<p>Five years work since the day the station had been first
formed, and the few thousands he had invested in it, all
represented by as much personal belongings as a wandering shearer
would possess when looking for a job. He turned inside to his
solitary meal with anything but a hearty appetite.</p>

<p>He had scarcely poured himself out some tea and cut himself a
piece of exceedingly dry, salt beef when a step sounded on the
verandah, and the voice of Brown the stockman called him by
name.</p>

<p>'Mr. Dunstan! Just step out and look at this queer customer
coming along.'</p>

<p>Dunstan come out and inspected the new arrival. In Brown's
eyes he certainly looked a very queer customer; but Dunstan had
seen men like him before; His get-up was outrageously tropical, a
huge solar topee, puggaree, veil, and goggles, white shirt and
trousers, with what used to be called the sign of the Barcoo
aristocracy, namely, a red silk sash around his waist. In this
sash was stuck a formidable sheath knife. His pack-horse was a
bad leader, and as the rider approached the cluster of buildings,
the animal hung back still more and nearly pulled the horseman
backwards over his saddle.</p>

<p>'Go and take his horse from him, Brown,' said Dunstan; 'he'll
got pulled off directly.'</p>

<p>'It ain't the new bank man, surely,' said Brown, who stepped
down and went forward to carry out the suggestion.</p>

<p>The visitor gladly resigned tho pack-horse to Brown and
dismounted.</p>

<p>'I would see Mr. Dunstan,' he said with a strong German
accent.</p>

<p>'That's him on the verandy,' replied Brown.</p>

<p>'Then I will to him go,' said the stranger.</p>

<p>Dunstan stepped forward to meet him, and was greeted with a
most ceremonious bow, and the visitor drew a letter from a breast
pocket in his shirt.</p>

<p>'My name is Spitzbauer; Professor Spitzbauer, and this letter
from your old well-beloved friend, Mister Zinglair will explain
my business.'</p>

<p>'Glad to hear of Sinclair, and to meet a friend of his,' said
Dunstan. 'Come inside; I'm just at tea. Brown will look after
your horses, and put them in the paddock, though there's precious
little grass there.'</p>

<p>While his unexpected guest was washing his hands, Dunstan read
his friend's letter of introduction.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
Spitzbauer, (ran the passage, referring to the German
professor) represents some learned society in the Fatherland,
and has come out here in search of a hairless race of natives,
supposed&mdash;although on whose authority I cannot say&mdash;to
exist somewhere in Australia, in the interior for preference.
Spitzbauer will tell you that the finding of this hairless race,
and the establishment of the fact of their existence, will place
beyond a doubt the origin of the Australian natives, or something
of the sort, I have forgotten. Anyhow, he has formed an opinion
that the hairless race exists somewhere in the west of Queensland
or in the Northern Territory beyond. As I know you have settled
very far west, indeed, I promised him an introduction to you; he
is as green as possible; but as plucky an a bull-dog ant, and I
know that you will see that he is not imposed on or made fun of.
He has stacks of money behind him, but there in a French savant
out after this hairless race as well, and Spitzbauer is in a
deadly fright lest he should find them first.</p>

<p><br>
THE letter then went off into other matters, and presently the
German reappeared, and they sat down to the delayed meal.</p>

<p>'Had much trouble in getting along this far?' asked
Dunstan.</p>

<p>'Drouble, yes, de goach was quite good; but when it sdop, I
had to buy horses, and dey was all bad, dey buck and dumble down,
and kick and drow my pack off; but a good friend at last got me
der quiet ones, and here I am, dired and sore, but safe mit the
friend of my good friend Zinglair. And you will show me these
vild men vidout hair on their heads? Is it not so?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid it is not so, for I have never heard of them.'</p>

<p>'Ah, but they are there. If we can only find them. Now, there
is Grigolet; he is out here on he same quest, but his deductions
are absurd; he says, "Polynesia," and he look north. The
Australian is no more Polynesian than Grigolet himself. He is of
India, of Egypt, and hairless men did live in dose gountries one
time. Do you see, my friend? Is not Grigolet a fool?'</p>

<p>'I've never studied the subject,' returned Dunstan. 'I've had
too much to do fighting bad seasons, and keeping my overdraft
down. Will you come outside, and have a smoke?'</p>

<p>'Zinglair said that you could help me, but I impose be did not
know your business at present.'</p>

<p>'I can help you with my advice as to getting an outfit
together, and perhaps find a good man or two to go with you, but
I expect to leave this place for good In a day or two.'</p>

<p>'Is not the place your own?'</p>

<p>'It was, but now it belongs to the bank, and as soon as their
man comes up I go.'</p>

<p>The professor nodded his bead; his inquisition had been
conducted in a kindly tone that no one did take offence at.</p>

<p>'And you go&mdash;where?' He went on.</p>

<p>'Can't say at present.'</p>

<p>'You say, do you not, that one' man's poison is another man's
meat?'</p>

<p>'Something like that, not quite.'</p>

<p>'It is what I mean, however. My friend, I am zentimental,
though you may not think so. I judge a man by his face, by his
voice, I have the instinct, and I make no mistake. I believe in
you, although we are strangers. That you have lost your station
is your poison, it shall be my meat. Come with me. There is glory
in it, and perhaps much fortune, who knows? Anyhow, my Society is
rich, and I pay you well, for to me you are of great value. You
are expert bushman. It is no favor; it is between man and man.
Will you come and find the hairless men?'</p>

<p>Dunstan looked at the good-natured little fellow, and his
heart went out to him. Certainly he could be of great use to the
professor, he knew; and fortune, or the reverse, is always
waiting for a man in new country in Australia. His mind was made
up&mdash;be would go.</p>

<p>'I will come with you, and do my best; if we do not find the
hairless men don't blame me.'</p>

<p>'I am very glad, my friend. To-morrow we will settle all
affairs; now I am tired and sore, and will get you to show me my
bed. I am satisfied, and will sleep.'</p>

<p>Dunstan, this hospitable duty performed, strolled out on the
verandah for another smoke, and to think over the strange way
fate seemed shaping things. He was still young, and full of
adventurous longings, and out in the still unsettled west there
might be yet rewards for the fortunate, or a grave; but that was
always the alternative. He turned in, and slept better than he
had done for some time.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
'HOW far have you been west, Brown?' asked Dunstan of the
lean, swarthy stockman the next, morning, as they leaned on the
paddock fence smoking an early pipe and watching the blackboy
drive the paddock horses up.</p>

<p>'Out as far as Barton's place, about fifty miles this side o'
the border.'</p>

<p>'How far's that from here? About eighty miles, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'About that. Is that little forriner who came last night going
out there, Mr. Dunstan?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps, and I'm going with him.'</p>

<p>Brown whistled, the whistle of surprise. 'You've got a
contrack, and no mistake. What are you going after, sir?'</p>

<p>'Niggers without any hair on them.'</p>

<p>'Well, all I saw out that way had got hair enough for two.
But, look here, Mr. Dunstan, are you a pulling my leg or not?
What's the good of niggers without hair, anyway? You can get some
here and cut their hair off if it makes them valuable.'</p>

<p>Dunstan explained to Brown enough of the quest of the German
professor to make him comprehend the nature of it, and Brown's
interest in the matter grew. When Dunstan finished, he said,
eagerly: 'I should like to go too; you'll want another whiter-man
with you to help look after that professor; now you and I and a
blackboy, or a couple of boys, would be the very thing. Count me
in, Mr. Dunstan?'</p>

<p>'How about leaving here; it won't be fair to the new man to
leave him with strange men only?'</p>

<p>'That's his troubles, not mine,' returned Brown cheerfully.
'Anyhow, I don't suppose as I'd have stopped; these new men
always want to cut down wages.'</p>

<p>'Well, I wouldn't wish for a better man, and we know each
other,' and Dunstan turned to the house to breakfast, and told
the delighted professor that he had secured a first-class man for
the trip.</p>

<p>'What, the good Brown who took my horses last night when I was
so tired? I will go and welcome him as a brave fellow-traveller,'
and only for Dunstan he would have rushed out and embraced Brown
forthwith. As it was, he always insisted on calling him the good
Brown for ever afterwards as long as destiny permitted their
steps to walk together.</p>

<p>The bank man turned up in a day or two, and as he turned out
to be the type beloved neither by gods nor men, Dunstan got away
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The thunderstorms now began to show up with some regularity,
and Dunstan and Brown, after a week or two, decided that it would
be safe to start west. They had got a good outfit together, and
the professor was in high spirits, for no argument would shake
his belief in the existence of the hairless tribe of natives. As
for Dunstan, he reckoned on something turning up, while Brown's
soul was satisfied with the change and the prospect of adventure.
They had got two good blackboys, so things were pretty easy.</p>

<p>The night they stopped at Barton's, the owner of the place
said to Dunstan, whom he knew pretty well: 'Strikes me, there's
an epidemic of lunacy about. Didn't you say that you were after
hairless niggers; or, at least, that the little chap was, and you
were nursing him?'</p>

<p>'That's so, old man; but I'm not shook on hairless niggers
myself. I might pick up a bit of country.'</p>

<p>'Well, a party has gone by MacEwan's place, that's forty miles
north of hero, on Just the same errand. At least, that's the yarn
MacEwan told me when I was over there the other day.'</p>

<p>'The deuce! Wonder whether it was the Frenchman that
Spitzbauer was talking of?'</p>

<p>'Yes; MacEwan did say it was a Frenchman. That's what
astonished me so when you rode up with a German, and said you
were going out on the same errand. You'll be having
Franco-Prussian war there if you meet.'</p>

<p>'You're right, but like a good fellow don't let anybody know
about this. It will upset the little fellow altogether if he
hears of it, and he's a rattling good sort. Do you know who it is
that's gone with the Frenchman?'</p>

<p>'Nobody from about here. Not up to much, MacEwan said.'</p>

<p>They got away from the station without Spitzbauer finding out
that his rival had for some unknown reason changed his mind and
gone west instead of north. Dunstan told Brown, and bound him
over to keep silence, and the professor rode gaily and innocently
along.</p>

<p>The country had bad a fair visitation of thunderstorms, and
their path was made easy for them thereby, but search as they
would, interview as many myalls as they could get within cooee of
and round up, they could hear nothing of the hairless blacks. Nor
did they come across tracks of the other party who, apparently,
were still to tho northward of them, on the same line as they had
started; until they had been away from civilisation for over two
months, and then in a ghastly and tragic fashion.</p>

<p>They bad been for some time amongst poor, desert country,
where small parties of blacks&mdash;a couple of families only,
for instance&mdash;were dispersed about hunting, sustaining
themselves on tiny soaks and sundry drainage holes. Although all
these aborigines were well furnished by nature with heads of
hair, the professor never despaired. Whenever a fresh smoke was
seen in the distance or a fresh track found he would exclaim,
'Now, my friend, and my good Brown, you shall see. This time I
feel confident&mdash;I have a presentiment&mdash;that we catch
tho hairless man!'</p>

<p>But the hairless man still refused to be caught, and one day
Dunstan, who was in tho lead, suddenly rode out of the forest
they had been amongst so long on to a wide stretch of swelling,
rolling, downs country; and he pulled up in thankfulness and
looked over it, for it was good to look upon. A bountiful
thunderstorm had fallen on it lately, and the grass and herbage
was green and beautiful. In the mid-distance a line of coolibah
trees denoted a creek, and even where they were they could see
the white corellas fluttering and flying about, showing that the
water was there.</p>

<p>'As pretty a bit of country as I ever saw,' said Brown, as he
pulled up alongside him. Dunstan nodded in acquiescence.</p>

<p>'No smokes,' said Spitzbauer, for the presence of blacks was
all be cared about.</p>

<p>But all was quiet and lifeless save for the distant hovering
birds, and heading for the creek the little party rode on. When
they struck the creek Dunstan turned and ran alongside it for a
short distance, looking for a suitable camping place. Suddenly he
pulled up his horse with an exclamation and dismounted.</p>

<p>Lying alongside the butt of a coolibah tree, half hidden by a
clump of polygonum, lay the body of a man. They gathered round
and examined it in pity. Scorched by sun and hot wind, scarred by
beak and tooth, bedewed with pitiful tears by the rain that came
too late to save, the dead man lay. He had staggered to the
water-hole when the plain was cracked and smitten dry with
drought, and the polygonum withered and sapless, and found there
nothing but dry mud, baked to the consistency of a brick; and
under the scanty shade of the coolibah tree he had lain down to
die.</p>

<p>Probably that night the black clouds had assembled in anger,
and 'midst the gleam of the levin and the crash of thunder, the
tropic rain had drenched an unresponsive corpse. Bright,
beautiful, and clear had broken the morn. All around arose the
grateful smell of the wet earth, drops of moisture fell unheeded
on the face from tree and bush, and splashed into the pool of
water that, as if in very mockery, the storm had left almost
lapping the lips, but the dead has no need of the fair sweet
water that but a few hours before it craved so desperately.</p>

<p>'He has been dead some weeks,' said Dunstan, looking round on
the green pasture, the full water-hole, and the chattering,
screaming parrots. 'Died here just before the heavy storm came
that filled this creek. Where did he come from?'</p>

<p>As he spoke his eyes met those of Brown, and he saw the answer
written there&mdash;one of the party they had heard about. He
stooped down and opened the pouch that, cracked and shrivelled,
still clung to the belt. A pipe and knife, and a letter in an
envelope doubled across, were inside. On the outside was written
in English:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
Please give the bearer all the assistance you can to come back
to my rescue, and forward the enclosed to the president of the
Academy of Science, Paris.</p>

<p><br>
Dunstan opened tho envelope, and saw that the enclosure was in
French. 'You read French,' he said to the professor, and handed
it to him.</p>

<p>Spitzbauer took it and read It, his eyes dilating as be read.
Then, as he finished, he lifted both his hands to heaven, and
began to bewail his fate in the most guttural German, amongst
which only the name of Grigolet could be distinguished.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
BROWN and Dunstan looked at the professor in blank
astonishment. Then at last the latter sharply demanded what the
trouble was about.</p>

<p>'Oh, my friend, it is despair, despair, that speaks.
Grigolet&mdash;Grigolet has been before us, and he has found the
object of our research. Grigolet has been the first to find the
hairless man. Oh, cannot you sympathise with me&mdash;me, the
unfortunate Spitzbauer, robbed of just triumph. Oh, traitor! to
come here after saying you were going north.'</p>

<p>'This poor fellow is not Grigolet?' said Dunstan.</p>

<p>'No, no; he is a messenger of his. Wait, I will translate.</p>

<p>The translation, not exactly in Spitzbauer's words, ran as
follows:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
'We have met with misfortune, and have little or no rations.
The natives attacked us, killed the blackboy, and wounded one of
my men, besides spearing and driving away most of our horses. But
before the misfortune overtook us I had found a beautiful
specimen of the hairless aboriginal of Australia. It is but a
skull, with the shrivelled-up scalp and some skin adhering, but
it proves the existence of the race, and I&mdash;I, Isidore
Grigolet, am the discoverer. John Williams, the unwounded man, is
going to take the two best horses, and make in to the nearest
station to bring succor, and I stay with the wounded man. As the
help may not come in time, I send with John Williams the skull
which I beg the man who receives this to have forwarded to the
president of the Academy of Science, Paris, with my letter, which
will prove my claim to be the rightful discoverer should I die
before help returns.'</p>

<br>

<p>Then followed scientific details of the skull and a
description of tho finding of it, which Dunstan would not wait to
hear about, much to Spitzbauer's disgust.</p>

<p>'We have no time,' he said. 'There are two men waiting all
this while, and we have not a minute to lose. We must bury this
poor fellow, and start on in the direction we think ho came. I am
afraid that the storm has put out his tracks.'</p>

<p>The professor, brought to reason by this, willingly gave his
aid, and the remains of the faithful bearer of tho message wore
soon underground. It was still two or three hours off sundown, so
they filled the water-bags and started west on speculation.</p>

<p>When about five miles from the creek one of the black boys
hailed and pointed to where some crows had risen about a quarter
of a mile off their track. On going over to the spot the remains
of a horse were found; it was the one ridden by the ill-fated
messenger, and a little further away lay the pack horse. The
horses had died where they had fallen, and the wretched man had
left there to stagger on on foot.</p>

<p>The remains of the pack had not been much pulled about, and
there amongst other things was the skull wrapped up in bark. The
professor took charge of it, and then without more waste of time
the party pushed on until late, there fortunately being a good
moon. When they camped the professor refused his tea, and sat
gloomily by the fire regarding the skull in a melancholy and
dismal manner.</p>

<p>Dunstan and Brown, who wore intent on finding the two men,
took little notice of him until they had eaten their meal and
filled their pipes; then they had leisure to speak to him, and
ask to look at the skull.</p>

<p>It was not a remarkably pretty object, the dried and wrinkled
skin that still stuck to the bone had a mummified look about it,
but it was certainly hairless, and Spitzbauer alternately
regarded it with loving fondness, and then, remembering that he
was not the discoverer, with intense loathing.</p>

<p>Dunstan looked at it, and passed it on to Brown, who made the
fire blaze up, and examined it with some curiosity. Something
evidently attracted his attention, for he called the two boys
over, and they talked in a low tone, both boys motioning towards
the fire.</p>

<p>'Is this one of the hairless niggers, professor?' asked Brown
at last.</p>

<p>'Yes, my good Brown, yes. There are more, doubtless; but that
is nothing. It is to be the first, and Grigolet has been the
first.'</p>

<p>'I can find you scores like that fellow,' went on Brown.</p>

<p>'Of what avail?' said the professor. 'This is the first, and I
did not find it.'</p>

<p>'This fellow had plenty of hair when he was alive, anyhow. How
did this Grigolet come by him? Did he kill him?'</p>

<p>'No; but that would be quite lawful to do for science. If I
found such a man alive, and I was the first to find him, and he
refused to accompany me, I should certainly kill him and take his
head. It would be only right. But Grigolet found this man dead,
and dried up. He did not kill him&mdash;there was not
occasion.'</p>

<p>'You see this fellow died in the open somewhere,' went on
Brown, disregarding the professor's bloodthirsty sentiments. 'How
he was killed don't matter; but a big bush fire comes along after
he'd laid there a bit, and dries him up and frizzles all his hair
off. That's all.'</p>

<p>Spitzbauer jumped up like a maniac.</p>

<p>'Is that so?' he almost screamed.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' said Brown; 'here's the marks of fire all about
his cobbra. Ask the boys.'</p>

<p>'Light! Light!' screamed the excited man. 'Candles! Plenty of
them!' He rushed to his pack and got out his microscope. They put
up the tent as a breakwind for him, and lit two or three candles.
Meanwhile the professor cut off a piece of skin and cleaned and
scraped it; then he retired to the tent and adjusted it under the
lens of the microscope. In about a minute there was a yell of
delight, and he came rushing out, and before Brown could get out
of his way he had embraced him.</p>

<p>'My good Brown! My over-good Brown! Once more are you my
saviour. You restore my self-respect. I meet Grigolet. I say,
behold your hairless man! That, for him!' And he snapped his
fingers defiantly. 'The microscope reveal the hair roots
throughout the scalp. See for yourself!'</p>

<p>And he folded his arms and struck an attitude.</p>

<p>'Here,' remarked Dunstan, 'stow your heroics. We've got to be
away before daylight to-morrow, and have a long day before us.
All hands had better turn in. Professor, you'll have a fit
directly.'</p>

<p>Next morning the discoverers were on their way again before
the stars had died out of the sky. They were lucky, for here and
there they came across trees which told them that the direction
they were taking was the right one. But they did not expect to
reach the locality where these men were until the next day.</p>

<p>That night they had to camp without water, and Dunstan looked
grave, for, for nearly forty miles they had not crossed the track
of a thunderstorm, and the country was parched and dry. It was
getting risky for themselves if they did not come across water,
and the chance was doubtful.</p>

<p>The next morning they went slowly and carefully, and when the
middle of the day arrived and still the same dreary outlook lay
before them, Brown and Dunstan looked at each other, and then at
the horses, in a very grave manner.</p>

<p>'We've overdone it, I'm afraid,' said Dunstan. 'We shall never
get all the horses back to that creek even if we turn back at
once.'</p>

<p>'It will be a case with those poor fellows if we do. We must
have got off the track somehow. Perhaps we are past the
place.'</p>

<p>'We must be nearly abreast of it. That man's horse could not
have come from much farther.'</p>

<p>'No. What do you say If we spread out a bit for a last look,
and if we find no traces by one o'clock we'll turn back.'</p>

<p>'I'm agreeable.'</p>

<p>And leaving the professor and one boy with the horses, the
three spread out on either side. Presently the boy whistled, and
held up his band. He had found the tracks of the dead man's
horses; they were coming down a slight ridge from the south.</p>

<p>'If the water where they were left has dried up since, we are
done for too,' said Dunstan, as they gathered the tired horses
together and followed the boy, who was now following the tracks
slowly.</p>

<p>Brown nodded, and they went on in silence; even the
professor's excitement did not show Itself. At the top of the
ridge they looked down, and saw below them the timber of a small
watercourse; then almost together they noticed a thin column of
smoke rising up.</p>

<p>Somebody was alive down there! Somebody was alive!</p>

<p>A tall, gaunt man, with a black beard, painfully emaciated and
worn, rose up as they rode up, and gazed almost listlessly at
them, although it was life they were bringing him.</p>

<p>'Grigolet!' cried the German.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">
GRIGOLET staggered forward a few steps to meet them, and then
recognised Spitzbauer. Dunstan could not help but admire the
pluck of the man as he suddenly drew himself up in an almost
theatrically nonchalant attitude, so as to appear self-contained
and at his ease before his scientific rival.</p>

<p>'See how the water is, Brown,' said Dunstan.</p>

<p>Brown nodded, and rode on. Dunstan and the professor
dismounted, and while the latter approached the Frenchman and
greeted him ceremoniously as if they were meeting in the streets
of one of their respective capitals, Dunstan opened his saddle
pouch and took from it a flask with part of their little store of
brandy in it, which he had carried in readiness, and undid his
water-bag. Mixing some in a pannikin, he approached and offered
it to the starving man.</p>

<p>'Drink this,' he said. 'We will get you some food
directly.'</p>

<p>M. Grigolet took it in a shaking hand, and swallowed it down.
Then a rush of feeling seemed to overcome him, and he burst out
crying, and swayed where he stood. The two men caught him, and
lowered him gently on the ground, and Spitzbauer mingling his
tears with his fellow-savant's, sat down and took his head on his
lap.</p>

<p>Dunstan was relieved when Brown called out to him that there
was plenty of water, and he had an excuse for going away with the
two horses. When he came back Spitzbauer had propped the starving
man's head up with his blankets, and came to meet him.</p>

<p>'Ach!' he said. 'He is so weak, so weak. Think of it. The day
after the man left with the message the blacks came again, and
drove the horses off, and next day the wounded man died, and he
has been alone here for four weeks. Fancy that! Alone and
starving for four weeks! My poor Grigolet! I lofe him now, and I
am afraid he is too far gone to save.'</p>

<p>'Don't say anything about the skull?'</p>

<p>'Of what do you think me gabable? If he live, and he get
strong and well, then I tell him. If he die, he die habby in the
thought that he is discoverer of the hairless man. Now, to make
him some Liebig, of which we have some. It is good for him.'</p>

<p>The water in the creek was fed by a strong soakage, and the
supply was ample for their wants. So they sat down, and tried to
nurse the feeble life back in the rescued man; but, as the
professor had truly said, he was too far gone to save. The long
tension on the nerves of the weakened body had proved too great,
and he faded slowly out of life. But he was not unhappy. He had
the professor by him always to talk to of his great discovery,
and dictated his last paper to him to be read before the Academy
of Science.</p>

<p>And so, after some days, the poor, plucky Grigolet died, and
they buried him reverently under the largest tree in the
neighborhood, and carved his name upon it. Then they were at
liberty to return, for Spitzbauer at last confessed that the
search for the hairless tribe was hopeless.</p>

<p>Slowly they journeyed homeward, and at last reached Barton's
outside station, and were gladly welcomed.</p>

<p>'Look here,' said the owner to Dunstan. 'If your man is still
keen on a hairless nigger I have got the very thing for him. He's
an old man, and has been bald ever since we've been up here, and
he's got no hair on his face. He's a freak, of course, but he
ought to do. He died last night.'</p>

<p>Dunstan consulted the professor, who consented to see the dead
nigger, but did not betray any of his wonted enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'Can I have his head?' he asked, after seeing him.</p>

<p>'Of course you can,' said Barton.</p>

<p>'Then I will take it instead of the one I have and pickle
it.'</p>

<p>'You see it is only a freak,' he explained to Dunstan; 'but I
must have the reputation of my dear Grigolet. If I take the first
head to Paris, they examine it, and say, "Grigolet was mistaken;
this blackfellow had hair when alive." Now, I take this old man,
whose hair-roots are not to be seen, and the learned men say,
'The great Grigolet was right; this was a hairless aboriginal;'
and the memory of my belofed friend is safe. It Is wrong, very
wrong, to tell lies to a great academy, but this is a French
academy, and I must save Grigolet's reputation.'</p>

<p>A year or two after that there was a thriving station formed
on the creek where the messenger had died, and the owner was one
Dunstan. A flourishing gold field had broken out in the
neighborhood, and things were booming in that part of
Australia.</p>

<p><br>
ONE day Dunstan received a parcel with many German stamps on
it, and a bulky letter from the professor.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
My dear friend and brave brother traveller [it commenced],
accompanying this is my dead Grigolet's paper on the hairless
tribes of Central Australia. Alas! as we know, it is all lies;
but beautiful lies; and my artifice was successful, and
Grigolet's name is the name of a great scientist, and he has had
much honor. Most honorably have they, too, acknowledged me for my
share in preserving and bringing home the valuable papers and the
fraudulent specimen. Also the thanks of the academy will be sent
to you and the good Brown. The paper has been translated into
English and German, and I send you the English translation. There
is some talk of sending out for his body and bringing it home for
burial; but if I know the world, my beloved friend will rest
where we buried him, till the Angel Gabriel sounds the last
trumpet.</p>

<p class="letter">
I am glad to hear from you that you are prospering, and that
the good Brown remains with you always. Some day I may again
visit your shores.</p>

<p><br>
NEEDLESS to say that the French academy has not yet sent out
for Grigolet's body; but Dunstan has himself had the remains of
the three members of the ill-fated party brought in to the head
station, and there buried, with a fitting memorial over them.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>09. -- MCWHIRTER'S WRAITH</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 14 Jan 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
I HAD been hard at work all day. The cook had made an effort
and cooked a decent dinner. I had finished my smoke, and was just
going to take a nip of whisky&mdash;a special case that an uncle
of mine had sent out from Scotland&mdash;when I was conscious of
a figure in the room.</p>

<p>I was alone in the house, so far as I knew. I could hear the
cook and the two men arguing loudly in the kitchen verandah. The
black-boys had permission to go and join a corroboree at the
blacks' camp. Who, then, was this stranger?</p>

<p>The figure, first shadowy and vague, grew more distinct, and
soon became clearly defined as a tall gaunt man, with a vivid
auburn beard and hair, and light-blue eyes. He looked inquiringly
at me, and, when I rather plainly requested to know what he was
doing in my room, he replied, in a strong Scotch accent:</p>

<p>"I'm McWhirter!"</p>

<p>"The devil you are," I said. "You're the original McWhirter, I
suppose, who took up this is station and stocked it fifty years
ago?"</p>

<p>"I'm the man," he said.</p>

<p>"What brings you here?" I naturally asked. "I thought you died
thirty years ago."</p>

<p>"So I did; but, mon, you called me."</p>

<p>Now just before coming in from the verandah I had looked
around at the neat and well-kept surroundings of my home, plainly
visible under a full moon, and I remember saying aloud, "If old
McWhirter could see this place now!" and apparently McWhirter had
heard the invitation and accepted it.</p>

<p>I may as well mention that old McWhirter was a sort of
tradition in the place. The legend ran that he was a tall
raw-boned Scotchman, who lived on nothing, and made his men do
the same, and worked like a cart-horse. The shade before me
seemed to about fill the bill, and I began to think that the
ghost of McWhirter actually stood before me.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" I said.</p>

<p>"It's just as weel," replied the shadowy thing.</p>

<p>"Have some whisky?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Mon, it would be guid. I can smell it, but canna taste it. Ye
ken I'm but a shadow."</p>

<p>"Is there not something you can do?" I asked. "What the spook
people called materialising. I knew a ghost in Sydney that
materialised himself into a wig, a mask, and a pair of lazy tongs
any time."</p>

<p>"Mon, you're clacking aboot those fechtless bodies called
mediums. I'm a genuine ghost. But there may be something in it. A
wee drap of whusky would no' be amiss."</p>

<p>"It came to me straight from Dundee." He looked at it
longingly. "There's a doctor chiel in Karma that knows a lot," he
said. "I'll go ask him," and in an instant he was gone.</p>

<p>I waited patiently, and presently the visitor from Karma
returned. At least there he was in the room again, but solid and
human; no more shadowy and illusive.</p>

<p>"It is done," he said. "Now, mon, rax us the whusky." He
filled out a stiff nip, and a beatific look came over his rugged
face. He put his glass down with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Why dinna they keep that brew in Karma?" he remarked; "it
would be no so bad then." He sat down, and I handed him a pipe
and tobacco, and he commenced to cut up and fill.</p>

<p>"What do you do in Karma?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We just contemplate," he replied, as though somewhat
weary.</p>

<p>"Don't you form clubs, get up any whist parties, or cricket,
or golf, or anything?"</p>

<p>He looked at me in dumb anger for a time.</p>

<p>"We just contemplate," he repeated; then he reached across for
the bottle and helped himself liberally.</p>

<p>"What were you wishing to see McWhirter for?"</p>

<p>"Well, to see the improvements in the place since he took it
up."</p>

<p>"Improvement!" he repeated, and the sneer he threw into it was
intense. "Losh, mon, I see no improvement!"</p>

<p>"That's because you don't understand modern things," I
replied, hotly.</p>

<p>"Deed, and I don't," he said, calmly. "It's all sinfu' waste
and wicked extravagance the way you manage things these
times."</p>

<p>"There was not much show of management on this place when I
bought it."</p>

<p>"No. There was no' a garden, for one thing," he said, with the
utmost contempt. "A guid feed of pigweed was eneuch for a man in
those days."</p>

<p>"And you got scurvy and barcoo-rot and every other kind of
abomination. And you paid more for curing yourselves than I do
for growing a few pumpkins and sweet potatoes."</p>

<p>"Rax me the whusky," said the ghost, and when he had helped
himself again he went on: "Noo, the way you use leather on a
station is heart-breaking. I would na geeve a bit of green-hide
for the leather that was ever made. Oh, but green-hide is good,
and bonnie, and mind you, mon, it costs nothing."</p>

<p>"The way you fellows used to live was disgusting," I said.</p>

<p>"Hoot, mon, there's na pleasing you. You maun keep men doon,
and no' feed them o'er weel."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, it's just as easy to live well as badly up the
bush. You used to eat nothing but weevily flour, just to make out
that you were economical."</p>

<p>"And is it economical you are talking? Oh, the sin o't! To
talk of throwing away guid flour just because o' a wheen weevils
in it! You're awfu' shy with that bottle, mon! Rax us ma
whusky."</p>

<p>That's what it had come to. It was his whisky now, and I
suppose his station and everything. I began to question the
sanity of my materialising suggestion. McWhirter, unaccustomed to
liquor for so long, was getting quarrelsome in his cups, and
inclined to think that he was on earth again for good.</p>

<p>He finished the whisky and went to sleep with his head on the
table, after calling me all sorts of names, amongst which he
mentioned that he had his "doots" whether I wasn't a "besom," by
which I understood him to mean that I was an old woman.</p>

<p>The morning star was bright when I turned in, but it seemed
only five minutes before it was broad daylight and the wall-eyed
cook was shaking me.</p>

<p>"There's a man asleep in the next room, and he's been at the
whisky, sir. The stink of spirits is something awful there," he
said, reproachfully.</p>

<p>At once it flashed across me that the ghost of McWhirter had
not vanished at daylight, and was now on my hands all day. "It's
a man came late last night," I said. "I know him. I'll see to
him. Bring in breakfast for two, and make some porridge."</p>

<p>"He looks like a man who eats porridge," said the cook,
spitefully.</p>

<p>I guessed that there was not a dram left in the bottle. I got
rid of him and woke McWhirter up. He blinked like an owl at
first, but gradually came to himself.</p>

<p>"It's awkward," he admitted. "The loon will buke me, and I'll
e'en get fined a year or two. They are machty stricht up there;
but there, lad, I'll stop with you all day, and gie you a lesson
in station management."</p>

<p>I thanked him, and, after freshening up a bit, we sat down to
breakfast.</p>

<p>"D'ye no have a 'morning'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I expect you want one," I said, and opened a fresh bottle. He
had a nip, and then sat down to his "parritch," as he called
it.</p>

<p>'"Mon!" he said with a shriek, "you are no putting sugar with
the parritch? You are but making a pudding of it!"</p>

<p>"Mr. McWhirter," I said, "if I like to make a pudding of my
porridge, I suppose this is my own station, and I can do it if I
like."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's your fash, not mine. But leetle did I think that I'd
a sat at my own table and seen a callant eat his parritch with
sugar." He put half the salt-cellar on his plate, and
groaned.</p>

<p>I groaned too. Fancy having the Scotch host of a pioneer
squatter of the old days, with a turn for economy in his
disposition, and a disposition to lecture and find fault, on your
hands all day. There were six bottles of Dundee whisky left, and
I felt all inward conviction amounting to a dead certainty that I
would not get rid of him until they were all finished. After he
had made a hearty breakfast&mdash;I may mention that I had broken
my cook in to grill a steak very well, and the McWhirter growled
because his steak was not fried&mdash;we walked round the place,
and I showed him all the improvements that had been made, and he
sneered at every one. The only time he smiled was when we came
across a gate that some fellow had pegged with a bit of dry
wood&mdash;a broken branch, in fact.</p>

<p>"Eh! that looks like old times," he said.</p>

<p>"Does it?" I remarked, for I am rather particular. "It will
look like new times directly;" and I went up, gave the man who
did it "beans," and sent him down to make a proper peg to put in.
We had to go in the store for a tomahawk, and McWhirter followed
us in and leaned against a case and looked round.</p>

<p>"I suppose you keep count of the tobacco by stick, when giving
out a pound," he said.</p>

<p>"No; we weigh it now."</p>

<p>"Guid sakes! you lose on every pun' you sell. Twenty sticks to
the pun', wet or dry that's fair measure."</p>

<p>"Oh! we don't trouble about those little makes nowadays."</p>

<p>"Little makes ma conscience! Noo there's floor; I suppose you
weigh that too?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"A tinnie went to the pun' with me. I've a mighty big thoome,
and I always stickit it weel doon in the tinnie when I was
measuring. That thoome has stood me in weel;" and he held out the
member in question&mdash;a great, broad, splay sort of
affair.</p>

<p>With lectures like this and some Dundee whisky, I managed to
get through the day. In the evening who should come up but a
distant neighbour of mine, an elderly Scotchman of the name of
McPhairson. I introduced him to McWhirter, and mentioned that he
was a nephew of the original McWhirter, which was the only thing
I could think of, for it had suddenly occurred to me that
McPhairson must have seen McWhirter when he was a youngster.</p>

<p>"I remember your uncle weel," said McPhairson, with the
garrulity of age. "You ha' no the bones o' him, and you're no so
tall, but you're like&mdash;you're like."</p>

<p>This was a good beginning, and I wondered how the ghost liked
being told that he wasn't like himself. But that was nothing to
what was coming.</p>

<p>"Ah! he was a hard old carle," went on McPhairson. "Folks
about here said the de'il got his own when he died. But I always
said, and held, that your uncle was too hard a bargain for the
de'il to touch with his hoof."</p>

<p>I hurried the two inside, talking rapidly and incoherently,
while I broached another bottle of whisky. McPhairson drank his,
and asked what ailed me that I was blitherin' at that gate. I
couldn't well tell him that he was talking to the ghost of the
original McWhirter, but I had a certain sort of gloomy
satisfaction when McPhairson, under the influence of Dundee,
settled down to a real old tirade against the hapless defunct. He
left off when he had satisfactorily proved to the supposed nephew
that his uncle had been a confirmed cattle and horse stealer and
a more than suspected murderer; and by that time the bottle was
three parts empty, and the cook poked his head into the door and
said that tea was ready, and a singit sheep's-head the dish. I
had no sheep, and it seems McPhairson had brought it over with
him in the buggy. As he went into tea the ghost whispered to me,
"I forgie him, and I'll go back to Karma content. A singit
sheep's head and Dundee whusky is too guid."</p>

<p>Tea passed quietly, and we adjourned for a smoke; then trouble
ensued. McPhairson again got reflecting on the character of
McWhirter's supposed uncle, and I'm afraid he raked up some nasty
home truths, which the latter remembered too well. Anyhow it was
growing late, and I had nearly dozed in my chair, when I was
roused by hot words.</p>

<p>"I will kill you," said McPhairson, getting up. McWhirter
laughed, and took the biggest nip of whisky I ever saw a man take
at one drink. Then he addressed me. "You will come and see this
mon kill me?" he asked.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was dead already, I had no objection. "He's
going to kill me, ye ken. And I wull gie the McPhairson the
biggest freet ever a McPhairson got, and they ha' gotten plenty
o' freets."</p>

<p>"It's a lee!" shouted McPhairson.</p>

<p>Peace was now impossible, so we adjourned out in the moonlight
to settle matters. Probably, if I had not had to keep pace with a
ghost at whisky-drinking, my brain would have been clearer, but
as it was I was desperate. The men were fortunately all asleep,
and we went round to the side of the house opposite to the
kitchen. I was convulsed at the idea of McPhairson fighting the
ghost, but he took it very seriously.</p>

<p>"You will kill me?" said McWhirter, in whom I noticed a
curious change. "Well, begin."</p>

<p>The opponents closed, and then a cry of dismay arose. The
McPhairson's fist had gone right through the now ghostly
McWhirter. He looked at him for one second of palsied horror, and
then took to his heels and fled. McWhirter took after him,
calling on him to stop; but McPhairson, after one turn round the
house, rushed into his room and barricaded the door&mdash;a very
useless sort of proceeding against a ghost. McWhirter came to
me.</p>

<p>"You ha' treated me weel," he said. "You're a wee bit
conceited, but ye will grow out o' it. I must move for some
reforms in Karma&mdash;the taste of that singit sheep's-head and
the Dundee whusky will abide by me. Good-bye, laddie, and dinna
believe what that cock-sparrow of a McPhairson tells ye."</p>

<p>Of course, now that he was going, I was quite sorry to part
with him, but we bade each other farewell, and he faded away, and
I went to bed.</p>

<p>It took an awful job to get McPhairson out of his room in the
morning. Only that he wanted a drink very bad, he would never
have consented to unbarricade his door. But he's very proud of
the adventure now, and tells on every available opportunity how
he chased "auld Hornie" twenty-five times round the house.</p>

<p>'That's a tidy sum. Is this a joke or reality?'</p>

<p>'True as we're sitting here. Lambert Dunaston, whom I suppose
you know well enough by name, owes me that figure.'</p>

<p>'How did he come to owe you that figure?'</p>

<p>'He bought his life at that price.'</p>

<p>'Didn't know you were, or had been, a bandit.'</p>

<p>'No, it was not that way. I'll tell you how it was. It's a
long story, and you'd better know it, and keep it secret to the
end, for there's no end to it yet Dunaston and I went West when
the first big rush was on. I had no practice then, and I thought
of setting up out there. By Jove! when we got there it seemed
that every hard-up M.D. in Victoria and New South Wales had been
struck with the same idea, and preceded me. Seeing how things
stood, Dunaston persuaded me to invest what little money we had
left between us in the purchase of the necessary outfit to join a
couple of men, whom he knew, who were going out prospecting. It
was the best thing to do under the circumstances, and I agreed.
We clubbed our money and bought camels, and the four of us made a
start.</p>

<p>'You've heard of the famous Yellow Spindrift Mine?'</p>

<p>'Who hasn't?'</p>

<p>'That mine was found that trip. The other two men were
Winkelson and Martow. Did you ever hear of their names or mine in
connection with it?'</p>

<p>'Never. Dunaston is the only one who is known with regard to
the Yellow Spindrift.'</p>

<p>'Exactly. Winkelson and Martow are dead&mdash;murdered, in
point of fact. Dunaston, from the sale and what was taken from
the mine, cleared £800,000. Half of that belongs to me. I don't
claim any of what he has made since. A majority of the men in the
world have two natures. The hidden nature shows out differently
in different men. In some, drink brings it to the surface. I
suppose you have often noticed how intoxication completely
reverses the natures of certain men. Circumstances perform the
same thing for others. The man who in town is a mild, pleasant
gentleman, becomes a coarse blackguard when out in the bush
beyond the restraints of civilisation. Dunaston was one of these
men. Once we got fairly into the wilderness, he seemed to change
into the primal savage which every man is under his veneer. He
was viciously cruel, and laid no restraint on his temper until
Martow took him in hand and gave him a good thrashing one night.
Then he vented his spite on the beasts; particularly the camel he
rode, a good camel, too, called Crookshanks from a malformation
of his legs.</p>

<p>'"You'd better go slow, beating that camel," said Martow to
him one evening. "A camel, like a parrot, never forgets; some day
old Crookshanks will get hold of you when you are not expecting
it, and then, God help you!"</p>

<p>'They were two decent fellows, rest their souls! and if we had
not had that devil with us it would not have been so bad, in
spite of the wretched desert we were travelling through. As it
was, we had a deuce of a nard time of it until luck Changed, and
we found the Spindrift. What a wonderful find that was! The mine
is played out now, but that is since Dunaston sold it. I often
dream of it still. What an irresistible influence the sight of
gold has upon men! and what a lovely thing it is to find. Clean
and heavy. Not like gems that have to be cut before their beauty
is apparent. But bright and beautiful from the start; like a
pearl, that needs no artificial aid.'</p>

<p>The doctor paused, and stared hard at the fire. Jenkins did
the same.</p>

<p>'It does me good now to think of those days when we had
nothing to do but gaze at the gold and conjecture how deep it
would go, and what we were each worth. We were in luck. Nobody
had followed our tracks, and we tested the reef, and found it to
exceed even our expectations. It was decided that Dunaston and
Winkelson should go in to Wonderranup, the nearest mining centre,
and obtain fresh supplies, and apply for the prospectors' claim
and reward. There was a rock hole close at hand that would
suffice for the wants of the two of us who remained, and there
was a salt marsh about five miles off that would supply water for
condensing when that was gone, so they took all the camels with
them. It was no good keeping things quiet, for the country
swarmed with prospectors, and it was better to announce the find
and go straight ahead working it.</p>

<p>'You would have thought it rather lonely for two men by
themselves in that gaunt desert country, but, strange to say,
Martow and I did not find it so; that gold reef was the most
pleasant and interesting companion men ever had, better than all
the books and journals in the world. The choicest wines, the most
charming women, the most witty comrades, I tell you, were nothing
to a reef full of veins of yellow metal.</p>

<p>'In coming to what is now called the Spindrift township, we
had naturally come a very roundabout course, but straight across
through the bush it was much shorter, though the track would
probably be without water. However, it was not too far to go with
camels, unless the country proved very scrubby. Ten days had
passed, and we were hourly expecting our two mates back, that
being about the time we had calculated on; but they came not. The
water in the rock hole was getting low, and we began to feel
anxious; gold would not satisfy hunger or thirst.</p>

<p>'From the top of the ridge, on the side of which was the reef,
away to the westward we could see the crest of a granite hill
peeping above the black scrub. As most of these bare granite
mounds had rock holes at the base, I proposed that we should, go
over one day and see if there were not more water there. Martow,
however, would not consent to our both leaving the mine, so it
was settled that I should go alone, and, as it was a full moon, I
decided to go that night. After our evening meal I started. In
rather over an hour I reached the rock hill, for it was sandy
country and heavy walking. I found several rock holes at the foot
of it, but I had gone nearly round it before I came on one much
larger than the one where we were camped, and with a good supply
of water in it. While at the back of the hill&mdash;that is to
say, the side furthest, removed from our camp&mdash;I thought I
heard a faint sound like a distant shot. I listened, but heard
nothing more, and concluded it was fancy. Having found the water,
I thought I would ascend the mound out of curiosity.. From the
top there was an extensive view, but by no means a cheerful
one&mdash;black and gloomy looked the sea of dark scrub around. I
had been looking away from our camp. When I turned towards it I
saw, to my astonishment, a glow of fire in that direction. It
seemed to me to be beyond the ridge where the reef was, and I
could not understand it, for there was no grass to burn in that
region. Hastily descending, I made back for the camp.</p>

<p>'One way and another I had been about four hours absent by the
time I reached the camp again; and what was my horror to hear
cries of pain and, sounds of scuffling as I approached. Coming
out of the scrub into the open I saw distinctly, for the moon was
directly overhead and it was bright as noonday. I heard, as I
said, groans and cries of anguish, and I saw a camel worrying a
man. Instinct told me it was Crookshanks having his revenge on
Dunaston. He was literally wiping the ground with him. No wonder
the poor wretch shrieked, for of all bites that of a camel is the
most painful, more so than a horse's.</p>

<p>I was in time to save his life for Crookshanks was about to
make an end of him by dropping on him with his chest and crushing
him. I rushed up and blazed my revolver off close before the
camel's eyes. I only wanted to frighten him off his victim, for
in my heart I rather sympathised with the animal. With shouting
and firing another shot, I got Dunaston away, and he was a
pitiable sight.</p>

<p>'I was completely bewildered. How did Dunaston come to be
there? Where was Martow? However, the only thing to do was to
look to the groaning man. I carried him to the camp, put him on
the blankets, got a light, and proceeded to examine him. He had
had a terrible time of it; no bones were broken, but he was so
bruised that I doubted if in that climate he would recover. I
once had to do my best for a man who was dying from being mauled
by an entire horse. Dunaston was not so bad as him, and that was
all I could say. I had brought a small medicine chest with me,
and I bandaged him up, and gave him a quietening draught to take
the strain off his nerves, then I made up the fire and looked
about the camp, but could find no sign of Martow, living or dead.
I had to wait until Dunaston was able to speak. He came to
himself when the effects of the soothing draught I had given him
had worn off.</p>

<p>'"When did you come back?" I asked.</p>

<p>'"About half an hour ago," he answered.</p>

<p>'"Where is Martow?"</p>

<p>'"I don't know. I have not seen a soul. I was looking about
when that devil attacked me. I'll cut the soul out of him when I
am able to get up."</p>

<p>'"You may never get up," I said shortly.</p>

<p>He tried to sit up, but gave a yell of, pain, and lay staring
at me. "What do you mean? Am I fatally hurt?"</p>

<p>'"No. But you are bruised and bitten all over, and only
constant attention and care will save you in this climate. For at
least two days somebody must be in attendance to change and renew
the bandages and keep them moistened with the antiseptic I have
put on. Now, satisfy my curiosity. What have you been doing, and
why are you alone?"</p>

<p>'"We went into Wonderranup and fixed everything up, and
Winkelson will be here in a day or two with the camels. The
warden is coming out with him. I was anxious about you fellows,
and pushed on before them. Where is Martow?"</p>

<p>'"That's what I must find out. I left him here at dusk, while
I went over to a hill three miles away to see if there was any
water. I just came back in time to save you from having all the
life squeezed out of you."</p>

<p>'"What do you think can have become of Martow?"</p>

<p>'"I cannot possibly imagine. I am going to have a cruise
round."</p>

<p>'"Don't go far. For heaven's sake, don't go out of
hearing."</p>

<p>'"Don't excite yourself; it's the worst thing you can do. I am
not going to leave you just yet."</p>

<p>'I made him comfortable, and, taking a rifle, went out on what
I felt was a hopeless quest.'</p>

<p>The doctor paused, drank off his whisky-and-water, and then
resumed.</p>

<p>'Somehow, I felt certain Martow was dead. I went up the ridge
to the reef; looked all about where we had been working; fired a
shot or two, and waited. No answering shot came. The interior of
Western Australia at night is a land without sound; in the dead
stillness the slightest noise could be heard; but I heard none.
Martow was dead, but who had killed him? Dunaston said he came
only half an hour before I returned. Then I suddenly recalled the
sound of a shot that I had fancied I heard when at the granite
hill. Dunaston was a liar, and I began to believe a murderer as
well. I returned to the camp, for there was nothing else to do
till morning.</p>

<p>'I sat down gloomily, scarcely speaking to the wounded man. I
began to think that old Crookshanks, the camel, had saved my
life. I was safe at present, for the man was helpless. I attended
to his bandages during the remaining hours of darkness, and
meditated on the position.</p>

<p>'At daybreak I got some food ready, and told Dunaston that I
was going to make a thorough search for Martow.</p>

<p>'"And leave me to die,' he cried."</p>

<p>'"You must chance that,' I answered. 'You should have thought
of that before you murdered Martow.'</p>

<p>"For a minute the man was speechless; then he said in a husky
voice: "Why on earth should I murder Martow?"</p>

<p>'"Because there would be one less in the reef. You would have
done the same by me, but for Crookshanks having a grudge against
you."</p>

<p>'"God! What put such villainous thoughts in your head?"</p>

<p>'"Facts. What has become of Martow? I left him here, alive and
well. When I come back I find you here, and he has disappeared.
While I was away I thought I heard a shot. When the warden comes
with Winkelson there will be a strict search made, if I have not
found him before then."</p>

<p>'A curious expression passed over the man's face. He made an
effort to move, and groaned in agony.</p>

<p>'"You said yourself that I shall die if not looked after; how
can yon talk of leaving me?"</p>

<p>'"You will die probably; I don't like the look of those
bruises at all this morning. I might be able to save you, but
duty calls me elsewhere. Martow might be lying wounded in the
scrub."</p>

<p>'"Stay with me, doctor. O, for mercy's sake, don't let me die
just when I am going to be rich."</p>

<p>'"You'll die easy. Mortification will set in, but just before
it comes you'll suffer torture."</p>

<p>'"How can you be such a brute? You're a murderer if you leave
me here."</p>

<p>'"I firmly believe you are one, or I shouldn't talk to you
like this. But I must go. I will get you some breakfast, leave
everything handy for you, and then spend the day searching for
Martow."</p>

<p>'"Don't go! Don't leave me to die alone, like a dog. You can
save my life if you stay with me. Martow can take care of
himself. Don't leave me, doctor, don't let me die!"</p>

<p>'So the man pleaded in his agony and fear of death. I went
outside and made up the fire. Looking about, I saw Crookshanks,
the camel, who had been caught by his nose rope in the scrub. I
went down to him, and, as he seemed to be in a good temper, I led
him up to camp, unsaddled him, gave him a drink, and put him on
some feed. Then I went back, and gave Dunaston some breakfast,
and had some myself.</p>

<p>'"Doctor," he pleaded faintly, when I was making ready to
start, "listen! If Martow does not turn up, there will be his
share to divide between us two?"</p>

<p>'"Between us three," I reminded him.</p>

<p>'"Yes. Now, I will give you half my own share in addition to
yours, if you will stay with me and attend to me until I am out
of danger."</p>

<p>'That was my mistake. I had been gloating over that gold too
long, and now I hungered for it. Instead of leaving him at once,
to live or die, as Fate thought fit, I lingered.</p>

<p>'"Half my share! Why, man, no doctor in the world ever got
such a fee before."</p>

<p>'I hesitated; then I asked when he expected the others up. Not
less than a day or two, he said.</p>

<p>'"I will stay with you two days on those terms. By then you
will either be dead or out of danger."</p>

<p>'He was not able to hold a pen, but I wrote it down and he
touched the pen while I signed for him. Then I fought with death
for forty-eight hours, and I won.</p>

<p>'On the third day Winkelson and the others had not arrived. I
told Dunaston that he was safe, and that I would take Crookshanks
and go and meet them, and direct them to the other rock hole, as
the one where we were camped was getting very low.</p>

<p>'He agreed, for he could now crawl about, and I started,
taking, by his directions, the track by which he and Winkelson
had gone in. The first day I met no one. The second day I met no
one. The third day I came upon a host of tracks making towards
the Spindrift on a slightly different line. Much puzzled, I kept
on, and met a camel team. We stopped to talk, and they informed
me they were pushing out for the new rush, "Dunaston's Find."</p>

<p>'I asked if Winkelson was ahead with the warden. They did not
know the name. They were in Wonderranup when Dunaston came in,
and they were certain that he came in alone.</p>

<p>'Their words turned me cold, although the day was hot enough.
Had there been two murders? I found I was only twenty miles from
Wonderranup, so I went on there, and learnt the full extent of
his villainy. He had come in alone, and the Spindrift was taken
up solely in his name. Winkelson must have been treacherously put
out of the way on the road down. This was cold-blooded work for
you! I joined in with some others going to the new rush, and
returned. The place was changed entirely, even in those few days,
and was now a busy scene of life. I sought out Dunaston at once;
he saw me coming, and managed to get rid of the men he was
talking to.</p>

<p>'"Well," I said, hotly, as I came up, "you had better say your
prayers, you murdering villain! for I have found out everything,
and this crowd will think nothing of lynching you when they know
what you have done, although it does not often happen in
Australia."</p>

<p>'Dunaston looked at me with provoking coolness. "If they lynch
anybody, or anybody deserves hanging, it's you. You left with two
mates, you turn up alone with a cock-and-bull story about their
having mysteriously disappeared, and I suppose you claim the
discovery of this mine."</p>

<p>'I couldn't speak. The man's astounding audacity and
wickedness staggered me.'</p>

<p>'"You see the situation, and I need scarcely say will accept
it&mdash;will have to accept it. I know nothing of you or of the
men who went with you. As things go in the constant change and
excitement going on now, the disappearance of our friends will
not be noticed; but let me draw attention to it, doctor, and
you'll find yourself hi an awkward position."</p>

<p>'"Then you mean to deny everything, you diabolical villain! My
saving your life from the camel, your bond to me for your
life?"</p>

<p>'"Everything," he calmly replied. "We were fellow-passengers
on board the steamer; since then we have not seen each other.
Remember, the people who were in Wonderranup when we started are
now dispersed all over the gold fields, and were too busy with
their own affairs to notice us."</p>

<p>'The wretch was right. He could easily throw all suspicion on
me, and I would have a small chance for life. I simply had my
hands tied, and was utterly in his power. He owned the reef; the
paper which I held was in my own handwriting; I had not a single
proof of any stability to bring forward. Would you believe it? It
was not the horror and atrocity of the man's crimes that
overwhelmed me at the moment, but the contemplation of what a
besotted fool I had been to let this villain get the best of me
when I held the game in my own hands.</p>

<p>'"I would to God you were in old Crookshanks' clutches again,
and I looking on," I said.</p>

<p>'"You would let him crush me. That is exactly what you ought
to have done, doctor, and precisely what I should have done in
your place. However, we can't put the clock back, and you are a
man of sense, and thoroughly understand the position."</p>

<p>'I did understand the position, and my blood boils and nearly
maddens me when I think of it The man is a double-dyed murderer
and robber, and I am a struggling physician, but he has the
money. Still, I believe that I shall hold trumps one day, and
then God help Lambert Dunaston. I'll avenge the deaths of the two
men he murdered.'</p>

<p>'You found no trace of the lost men?'</p>

<p>'No. I own I did not stay there much longer.'</p>

<h3>PART 2. -- HOW THE DEBT WAS PAID</h3>

<p class="first">
LAMBERT DUNASTON and his bride were passengers on the China
steamer <i>Emperor</i>, en route for the pleasant and interesting
land of Japan. It had been rather a shock to him to find that old
West Australian mate, Dr. Hunt, was taking a holiday by filling
the place of the regular ship's doctor that trip, but it was too
late to draw back, and as Hunt met him on the standing of a
stranger, he concluded that it was simply one of those
unfortunate coincidences that happen during a man's lifetime.</p>

<p>Under shelter of the Great Barrier Reef, along the coast of
Northern Queensland, the voyage was through summer seas, and but
for the haunting presence of his former friend, Dunaston's
honeymoon trip would have been an ideal one. Summer seas however,
are proverbially treacherous, and once past Thursday Island the
<i>Emperor</i> got into a storm belt, and received some buffeting
about. It was a tempestuous night, and the few passengers had
retired early.</p>

<p>In the dimly-lighted saloon the doctor groped his way through
the bodies of the sleeping Chinese cabin boys, and went on deck
and ascended the bridge. The sea was high, and the wind seemed
increasing. The captain was looking at the barometer in the chart
room.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid we'll be caught, doctor,' he said, as the other
entered.</p>

<p>'How's that? Barometer falling?'</p>

<p>'Falling! I should think so; going to have a typhoon I am
afraid.'</p>

<p>'She's making heavy weather of it now.'</p>

<p>'Yes, and I don't want to get into a big blow with her; she's
a bad sea boat.'</p>

<p>The two men remained silent, holding on during the big rolls
the steamer was making. The doctor's thoughts were busy with his
schemes against his enemy, and the rhythmical noise of the
engines seemed to ring in chorus; 'The time is near.'</p>

<p>He had no set plan, but he was determined that he would not
part with his man again, except on fresh terms. The whole thing
had been quite accidental;' he wanted change, and had taken the
opportunity offered by the ship's doctor wishing to remain on
shore to exchange for the trip.</p>

<p>He was as much astonished to see Dunaston on board as Dunaston
was to see him, but he was infinitely better pleased. Now seemed
the very time to avenge the two murders. Dunaston just married to
a beautiful young girl, to whom he appeared passionately
attached. Surely the stars in their courses were fighting for
him; the man was vulnerable now. Their interviews had been
limited, Hunt avoiding the man as much as it was possible to do
on board ship, and no one suspected that they had met before.</p>

<p>The captain's foreboding was right. By morning a full-sized
typhoon was howling and shrieking behind them, and the
<i>Emperor</i> had to turn tail and run right before it.</p>

<p>The storm had reached its height about noon, and the steamer
was laboring heavily, and shipping a good deal of water. Two or
three seas had found their way into the saloon, and everything
was drenched and miserable. Mrs. Dunaston kept her cabin with her
husband. The wind began to die down afternoon, and one or two had
struggled to the table, when a sudden jar and the cessation of
the engines told of some catastrophe.</p>

<p>Hunt climbed on deck, and looked around at the wild tumult of
sea, in which the now helpless steamer was tossing and pitching;
occasionally heeling far over when a greater wave than usual
surged upon her. The worst had happened. The constant racing of
the screw in the heavy sea had injured the shaft, and the
<i>Emperor</i> had hopelessly broken down, and was at the mercy
of the tremendous seas almost without steering way. A couple of
staysails were all the sail that could be made on the apologies
for masts, and the colored crew managed at last to get them
spread.</p>

<p>It was a dismal outlook, the rolling of the ship was so
violent that even the most practised and active could not keep
their feet. The night closed in black and gloomy, and the
<i>Emperor</i> was dashed about and banged and lifted seemingly
half-way up to the heavens. In the morning she had developed an
alarming list, some of the cargo had shifted, and things looked
black, indeed, for she was now reported to be making water fast.
They had been driven out of their course by the typhoon, and not
a ship was in sight; but the sea was going down, none too
soon.</p>

<p>Two boats had been smashed; but the three that remained were
large enough to carry all on board comfortably, and they were got
out in readiness, for it was now obvious that the steamer would
have to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The time had come, and Dunaston was in his cabin putting some
matters of importance in his pockets, when the steamer gave a
more than usually heavy lurch throwing him against the bunk, and
at the same time his cabin door was slammed and the key turned.
He had been locked in to go down with the ship. The boats were on
the other side, and in the creaking and groaning of timber that
was going on his cries and shouts were unheard. And if there
occurred the least confusion he would not be missed. His wife and
the one other lady passenger were to go in the first boat in
charge of the chief officer. They were in hopes of making Timor
in three days.</p>

<p>Hunt, of course, had locked him in, out of revenge, and would
take care that he would not be missed. The portholes had been
screwed tight during the typhoon, and he could not open the one
in his cabin. He was trapped to die a horrible slow death. If the
vessel sank it would not be one quick rush and over; but it would
creep in slowly, and he would be hours dying.</p>

<p>He beat on the door, and called, and the only sound that
answered him was the creaking of the straining timbers. Hour
after hour of agony followed, and then it began to grow dusk, and
he felt himself doomed, indeed&mdash;doomed to die in darkness
and loneliness; and he recalled with horror the ghastly rumors
that were once spread of men having been accidentally shut up in
the water-tight compartments of the <i>Victoria</i>, and going
down with her to die a lingering death at the bottom of the
Mediterranean.'</p>

<p>So passed the long night, in frantic desperation and sullen
apathy; several times he thought of suicide, but he had no speedy
weapon with which to do the deed. Still the steamer floated and
the sea was fast going down, and a dawn he had never expected to
see stole in at the porthole at last.</p>

<p>Dunaston had been sitting on the edge of his bunk, when he
started to his feet with a wild shout of hope. He had heard a
footstep on the deck overhead. Somebody was on the ship beside
himself, or one of the boats had come back, seeing the vessel
still floated. No answer came to his hail, but he distinctly
heard the footstep pass up and down.</p>

<p>After about an hour some one came into the saloon. The motion
of the ship was now only a long roll, but the list had become
very perceptible. Whoever it was came straight to his cabin,
unlocked the door and threw it open.</p>

<p>Hunt stood there revolver in hand, and ordered him on deck. He
was obliged to comply, for the look in the doctor's eyes did not
admit of any questioning. On deck he ordered him to sit down, and
before he anticipated it he was shackled to a ringbolt by his
ankles.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Dr. Hunt, 'we can talk comfortably.'</p>

<p>The sky was clear, every trace of the storm had vanished from
above, and a fierce equatorial sun was beginning to make Its
presence felt.</p>

<p>'The steamer's going to float, after all, and we shall have a
pleasant little jaunt together. Pity those two fellows, dead in
Western Australia, are not here; even old Crookshanks would smile
if he saw you.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you want money; your share of the reef, in fact.
Well, you won't get it,' and Dunaston tried to look defiant, but
failed.</p>

<p>'I want a full confession. The money can wait, and so can
I.'</p>

<p>Hunt lit a cigar, and took a turn or two up and down the deck.
The boat now only wallowed with a long, sluggish roll; she was
very deep, but seemed likely to keep afloat as long as the
weather kept fine.</p>

<p>Having finished his cigar, Hunt went into the saloon, and came
out with some eatables and a bottle of claret, which, he
proceeded to discuss in sight of his prisoner.</p>

<p>'You will be happy to hear that the boats got well away, and
Mrs. Dunaston will soon be in safety in Timor. I managed it very
neatly so that we were not missed.'</p>

<p>'Are you going to starve me?'</p>

<p>'I'm not going to give you anything to eat or drink until you
write down that confession.'</p>

<p>'The boats may come back?'</p>

<p>'I shinned up the mast this morning as high as I could, and
they were not in sight. Besides you'll never go alive into one of
them; I'll take care of that.'</p>

<p>'What do you want me to confess?'</p>

<p>'The murders of Winkelson and Martow; then we'll go into the
money question.'</p>

<p>Dunaston was silent, and Hunt said nothing more.</p>

<p>The sun mounted higher and higher; a dead calm reigned, and
the blazing heat struck with fierce rays on the man fastened to
the ringbolt. Still he held out, but in the afternoon was, forced
to beg for water.</p>

<p>Hunt took no notice of the request. And darkness closed in,
and throughout the long hours of the night the derelict was
silent, save for a groan of helpless agony and despair wrung at
intervals from the sufferer.</p>

<p>It was 10 o'clock the next day before he gave in. Hunt brought
out paper and pen end ink, then gave his prisoner a little wine
and water and some food. Dunaston wrote. In substance it amounted
to what Hunt had guessed.</p>

<p>Winkelson had been disposed of on the way down. Dunaston,
pushing ahead, had found Martow alone, dispatched him
treacherously, put his body on the camel, and taken it some
distance away, and built a huge fire over it, the one Hunt had
seen from the granite mound. He then was going to wait Hunt's
return, when the attack made on him by the camel frustrated his
plans, and saved the doctor's life.</p>

<p>This confession he wrote out and signed, and then Hunt fed him
again, and the game commenced once more.</p>

<p>This time the stake was high, but the cards were all in one
hand, and Dunaston had to make a will, and make over a large
amount of property, and sign a fat cheque, all in return for
value received, the value being half a pint of tepid water, or,
perhaps, a pint, and a little food.</p>

<p>'I shall repudiate all these documents,' he said, when the
last was signed.</p>

<p>'I suppose you will if you get the chance. I anticipate being
picked up soon, and I shall at once give you in charge for the
confessed murder of your mate; now that you have given the clue,
proof will soon be forthcoming.'</p>

<p>'Don't you intend to release me?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not. But I will keep you alive; we're sure to be
fallen across soon.'</p>

<p>Another day, and another, and Dunaston began to feel the
effects of the sun.</p>

<p>'I must let him out for a bit to-morrow,' thought Hunt, 'or
he'll go cranky on my hands.'</p>

<p>It was another day of unruffled calm, and Hunt bad been
amusing himself, and maddening his prisoner by dilating on the
future stretching before him, and comparing their respective lots
when rescued.</p>

<p>'By the way, it will be a pity to separate the money. After
you're hanged, perhaps Mrs. Dunaston would not be inconsolable,
and I always had a weakness for widows&mdash;young widows.'</p>

<p>Hunt was looking away at the horizon as he spoke, and did not
notice the murderous hand steal up to an iron belaying pin in the
side. It was loose, and Dunaston had noiselessly taken it out,
and the next minute launched it with unerring and mad strength at
his enemy. Hunt got the blow an the temple, and fell dead on the
deck.</p>

<p>Dunaston slipped down against the bulwark, and began to laugh
shrilly and vacantly. He suddenly realised what he had done, and
lost his reason. Hunt had the key of the handcuffs in his pocket,
and the body lay beyond his reach. The blood from the wound began
to trickle towards him along the sloping deck, and the madman
greeted it with shouts of terror, and, anon peals of maniac
laughter. When it reached him he dipped his fingers in it, and
wrote meaningless gibberish on the deck.</p>

<p><br>
A BOAT from the Dutch gunboat boarded the derelict, and found
the madman still alive, and babbling deliriously, talking to the
dead man who lay just beyond his reach, with life and freedom in
his pocket. He lingered but a few days.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>11. -- THE BOUNDARY RIDER'S STORY</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 14 Dec 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
THE storm that had been brewing all the afternoon, gathered,
towards nightfall, in great black clouds, cleft every now and
then by jagged streaks of vivid lightning. Just after dark it
burst in a fierce rush of rain and boom and rage of thunder.
Blinding as the lightning was, it as only by its assistance that
a belated traveller could keep his horse on the bridle-track he
was following; for when darkness fell between the flashes, it
seemed as though a black pall had been dropped over
everything.</p>

<p>With heads bent down, the sodden man and horse plodded on
until the rider found himself on a main road into which the track
debouched.</p>

<p>"Another mile;" he muttered to himself; "and I'll come to old
Mac's." He touched his horse slightly with the spur and glanced
nervously round. The travelling now improved, and ere long a dim
light proclaimed his approach to some kind of habitation; soon
afterwards he pulled up at the verandah of a small bush inn.</p>

<p>"Are you in Mac?" he roared with a voice that outdid the
thunder, as he splashed down from his horse into a pool of water,
and hastily proceeded to ungirth.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" returned a voice, and the owner of it came out
and peered into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Smithson! Lend us a pair of hobbles."</p>

<p>"Jupiter! what are you doing out here such a night as this?"
asked Mac as he handed him the hobbles.</p>

<p>"'Cos I'm a fool, that's why," said Smithson as he stooped
down and buckled the straps. "Can't go wrong for feed, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Right up to the back door. Come in and get a change."</p>

<p>Hanging his saddle and bridle on a peg riven into the slab,
the late traveller followed his host into the bar. Mac put his
head out of the back door and roared to somebody to bring in some
tea; then reached down a bottle and placed it, with a glass,
before his visitor. Smithson filled out a stiff drink, tossed it
off neat, and gave a sigh of satisfaction. Having got a dry shirt
and trousers, the traveller proceeded to simultaneously enjoy a
good meal and his host's curiosity.</p>

<p>"It's that cursed Chinaman hunted me. The one who cut his
throat."</p>

<p>"Did you see him?" asked Mac in an awed voice.</p>

<p>"I did, indeed, with the bandages round his neck just as they
found him. I meant to go in to the station and tell the boss he
must send out somebody else. When I remembered that you were
nearer and came over for a bit of company. Now, don't laugh at a
fellow&mdash;just you go and stop in my hut for a night or
two."</p>

<p>"No fear," returned Mac emphatically.</p>

<p>"Well I thought I didn't care for anything," said the
boundary-rider, "but this caps all. You should see&mdash;cripes!
what's that!" For a long, lugubrious howl sounded outside,
followed by the rattling of a chain. Both men forced a very
artificial laugh.</p>

<p>"It's Boxer," said Smithson, Suddenly illumined. "I left him
tied up, but he's got his chain loose and followed me."</p>

<p>A very wet and woe-begone dog came in at his call. Smithson
detached the chain from his collar and they sat down again.</p>

<p>"Boxer didn't fancy being left alone," remarked Mac.</p>

<p>"Seems not. It gave me quite a turn when he howled like that.
What do you say?" Taking the hint, Mac arose and the two went
into the bar.</p>

<p>"All alone to-night?" asked Smithson.</p>

<p>"Yes, the missus is in town; there's only deaf Ben in the
kitchen."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope that d&mdash;d Chinaman won't follow the
dog."</p>

<p>"Don't get talking like that. How did he come to cut his
throat? It was before my time."</p>

<p>"The fellow who had the contract for the paddock-fence lived
in the hut with two men, and the Chinaman was cooking for them;
he was there for over six months. Chris, the contractor, he paid
off the other men; and he and the Chinaman stopped for a week
longer to finish up some odd jobs. One morning Chris came in to
the station as hard as he could split&mdash;the Chow had cut his
throat the night before. Chris said he wasn't quite dead, and
that he had tied up the wound as well as he could. The super and
another man went back with him, but when they arrived the Chinkie
was as dead as a door-nail. Now, the strange thing was that the
stuff Chris had tied round his throat was quite clean; but when
they moved the body, with Chris holding the shoulders, the blood
commenced to soak through, and turned them all quite faint. All
Chris knew about it was that when he awoke in the morning the
Chinaman was lying outside with a sheath-knife in his hand and
his throat cut."</p>

<p>"And did you see nothing until to-night?"</p>

<p>"No. Just after dark I heard someone calling, and I went to
the door and looked out. I can tell you I just did get a fright,
for there by the lightning I saw the Chinaman standing, with
bloody rags round his neck, and the knife in his hand."</p>

<p>Mac shuddered and passed the bottle.</p>

<p>"Now," said Smithson, "comes the strange part of it. That
shout, or coo-ee, I heard, came from some way off, and that there
ghost I saw was not looking at me, but listening for that shout,
and smiling like a man who was expecting a friend coming."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I slammed the door to, picked up my saddle and bridle and got
out of the back window. I knew my old moke was not far off, but I
was that scared I left his hobbles where I took them off. I heard
Boxer howling as I rode away."</p>

<p><br>
IT was a beautiful morning after the storm as Smithson rode in
to the head station. So bright and cheerful was it that the
boundary-rider felt rather ashamed of the yarn he was going to
tell and half-inclined to turn back. However, he went on and had
an interview with the superintendent. Naturally, he was laughed
at, and this, of course, made him stubborn.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," said Morrison, the super, at
last. "I'll go back with you this afternoon and stop the night
with you, and we'll see if we can't quiet the Chinaman."</p>

<p>Smithson agreed, remarking that perhaps it was only on one
particular night he walked, as he had never seen him before.</p>

<p>Morrison turned up an old diary and glanced through it. "Oh,
that's nothing," he said, pushing it away.</p>

<p><br>
THE two men rode up to the lonely hut, Morrison slightly
ahead. "There's something queer there," he said, pulling up.
Smithson stared eagerly; while Boxer, who was with them, sat down
on the road and howled dismally.</p>

<p>Recovering themselves, the two rode on. A man was lying in
front of the door stretched out in death. Dismounting, they
approached and examined him.</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Smithson, "don't touch him&mdash;we mustn't
till the police come."</p>

<p>With an impatient gesture Morrison stooped down and turned the
dead face up. In the throat was a rude wound, and in the open
eyes a terror more than human.</p>

<p>"It's Christy," said the superintendent in a quiet voice.</p>

<p>"The man who employed the Chinaman?" asked Smithson in an
unsteady tone.</p>

<p>"Yes. How, in the name of God, did he come here? Tell me
exactly what you saw and heard."</p>

<p>"I was in the doorway, as I told you," said the boundary-rider
excitedly, "standing just there, and by the flash of lightning I
saw the Chinaman here"&mdash;and he indicated the spot.</p>

<p>"He was standing like this"&mdash;and he bent forward like a
man watching and listening&mdash;looking in the direction the cry
came from over there.</p>

<p>"And you saw a knife in his hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he was smiling as though expecting somebody he
wanted to see badly."</p>

<p>Morrison put his hand on the other's shoulder and pointed to
the knife in the hand of the corpse. "Was it that knife?"</p>

<p>"It looks like it," chattered Smithson.</p>

<p>The superintendent glanced about and shook his head. "No
tracks to tell tales," he said.</p>

<p>"No, all the storm was on afterwards."</p>

<p>Morrison mused a bit. "Get a sheet of bark," he said, "or one
of those sheets of iron there. We must put him inside, and then
I'll give you a letter to take in to the police. You can get back
with the sergeant by to-morrow morning, and we'll bury him."</p>

<p>"You're not going to stop here?" said Smithson.</p>

<p>"No," returned Morrison. "I'll get over to Mac's."</p>

<p>They lifted the dead man on to the sheet of iron and carried
him into his old dwelling-place, Smithson evidently much averse
to the job. Morrison tried to close the staring eyes before they
put one of Smithson's blankets over the corpse; but the lids were
rigid. "Evidently he didn't like the look of where he's gone to,"
he muttered. The two set out&mdash;one to the little township,
the other to Mac's pub.</p>

<p>The night was as calm and fine as though thunder were unknown.
Morrison mused deeply over the tragic occurrence, trying to
recall all he knew of the past and put a common-sense
construction on it, but he failed, and only made himself
nervous.</p>

<p>"There's one very strange thing about the affair," he said to
Mac, when they were discussing it that evening. "When I paid
Chris for the contract&mdash;over which he lost, by the
way&mdash;I gave him separate cheques to pay off his men,
including one for the Chinaman of about $30. That cheque was not
found, and, moreover, it has never been presented to this
day."</p>

<p>"What sort of a fellow was Chris?"</p>

<p>"A good fencer, but a stupid fellow, not fit to take
contracts. I often wonder if he took the cheque off the body
before he came in."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't he present it?"</p>

<p>"That was his idea, no doubt, at first. But I tell you he
could scarcely read or write and I suppose after he heard me tell
the sergeant that I would give the bank notice and instruct them
to watch for the cheque, he got frightened."</p>

<p>"Before that he imagined that one cheque was the same as
another, and that you could not trace a particular one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just about what he would think."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he killed the Chinaman?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he did," returned Morrison, after a long and
thoughtful pause.</p>

<p>By sunrise Morrison and Mac were at the boundary-rider's hut,
and soon afterwards the sergeant and Smithson arrived. The
examination did not take long, and they prepared to dig a
grave.</p>

<p>"Better not bury him alongside the other," said the
sergeant.</p>

<p>"No," replied Morrison. "Let's see, we buried him over against
that tree; didn't we, sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and not very deep either. It was dry weather, the ground
was hard, and we came upon a big root."</p>

<p>The obsequies were not prolonged. Sewn up in the blanket, the
dead man was soon laid in a damp grave. While the others were
filling it up, Morrison, still thinking of Mac's remark, strolled
over to the spot where the Chinaman slept, not expecting to see
any mark of the place left. He started and turned pale.</p>

<p>"Here! Quick! Come here!" he cried.</p>

<p>The men came hastily, the tools still in their hands. The
earth over the old grave had been loosened and disturbed.</p>

<p>"My God! he's got up!" murmured Smithson. "I've heard they
can't rest out of their own country."</p>

<p>"Give me a shovel," cried Morrison; and commenced to carefully
scrape the earth away. The sergeant assisted him, and they soon
came to the skeleton, for nearly everything but the bones was
gone.</p>

<p>"What, do you expect to find?" asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>Morrison was carefully brushing the loose dirt off the thing
with a bough.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said.</p>

<p>Clasped in the fleshless hand was the missing cheque</p>

<p>"It wasn't buried with him, I'll swear," said the
sergeant.</p>

<p>"And if it had been, it would have decayed long since,"
answered Morrison.</p>

<p>"He got up and took it from Chris last night. He was bound to
get his cheque back," said Mac.</p>

<p>"Well I'm going to pack up my traps," remarked Smithson.</p>

<p>"I'll send down and have this hut shifted," said Morrison.
"Although now he's got what he wanted, I don't suppose, he'll get
up again."</p>

<p>"By gum, I won't trust him," said the boundary-rider.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>12. -- BLOOD FOR BLOOD</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 17 Dec 1892</h3>

<p class="first">
SILENCE everywhere, the spell of heat on everything. Kites,
which had been soaring on strong pinions away back in the dry
country, swooping down on the grasshoppers, have had to come in
to this lonely waterhole tired out and worried; and now sit
dozing on the branches of the motionless coolibah. One who had
left it too long has had only sufficient strength to reach the
water and flounder in, and stands with bedraggled feathers moping
at the edge of the muddy pool. There is no animal nor human life
to be seen&mdash;just a round clay hole, a few withered polygonum
bushes, and some gnarled and warped coolibah trees. Around lies a
bare plain with a bewildering heat-mist hovering over it.</p>

<p>The slow, hot hours creep on. The sodden kite standing near
the water suddenly topples over and falls dead; at times one of
the others flops heavily down from its perch, takes a few sips
and flies back again. These are the only sounds, the only living
movements that break the stagnant monotony.</p>

<p>There is neither track of man nor beast to be seen, but for
all that what was once a man is lying there beneath one of the
shadeless trees. It has been lying there for over six months, so
there is nothing very repulsive about the poor corpse but its
shrivelled likeness to humanity. When it staggered in there alive
the hole was dry, and it sank down and died. Since then a quick
and angry thunderstorm has passed and partly filled the hole, too
late. But no prowling dog has found the body, not even the
venturesome crow has been to inspect it; the desert has protected
it from white tooth and black beak, and it lies there dry and
withered, but the form of a man&mdash;and a white man, still.</p>

<p>This is the story of that unburied, unwept, untended corpse.
It is a story of thirst, of treachery, of revenge.</p>

<p><br>
YEARS ago, when stations were valuable and all things pastoral
looked bright ahead, three men pushed out beyond the bounds of
settlement in search of new country. Two of them were fast
friends, although there was a considerable difference in their
ages. The third was simply on the footing of ordinary friendship
and of about the same age as the elder of the other two. The
party was completed by a black boy.</p>

<p>Far beyond the lonely water-hole where the weary kites sit
watching the silent dead, they came on to good
country&mdash;fair, rolling downs and deep permanent holes. At
one of these they fixed a camp and inspected the country on all
sides with a view of dividing the runs fairly. One day the
younger of the two friends and the third man went out together.
They took a long excursion northward and finding no water, made,
the next day, for a small hole they had passed on their way out.
Fatal mistake&mdash;the hole was dry, with the body of a misled
dingo rotting at the bottom, and with thirsty, tired horses, and
nearly empty bags, they were now fifty miles from their camp, the
nearest water.</p>

<p>They turned out for a short spell and lay down to catch a few
moments of slumber. The young man slept soundly, dreaming of
long, cool swims in a river; of watching it sparkling and leaping
amongst the rocks; then he awoke suddenly to find himself
companionless in the desert. He raised himself on his elbow and
looked around. The clear starlight showed him nothing; he was
actually alone; his mate and all the horses were gone. He went to
where they had hung the water-bags on a tree. They were gone,
too. He comprehended it all. His treacherous friend had taken the
two freshest horses and the remnant of the water, and started for
the camp, trusting that one would get there where two could not.
The other two horses had probably followed of their own accord,
to die in their tracks.</p>

<p>He had no hope that his companion meant to come back with
succour. A man who could do such a deed would never suffer his
victim to bear witness against him. He had the choice of two
deaths&mdash;a lingering one where he was, or a quicker one in a
desperate attempt to gain the camp. He chose the latter. He had
no expectation that his own old friend would come to his relief,
for he guessed he would be deceived by some specious lie.</p>

<p>When the end came, as it soon did, and he fell for the last
time, he prayed with his dying breath that the man who had
wrought his death might die as he did.</p>

<p><br>
LATE that night the survivor, with one remaining horse,
reached the camp, and told the anxious occupant how his friend
had died of thirst; how he had helped him on to the last, and
only left his body when aid was useless and his own life in
jeopardy.</p>

<p>"I must start at daylight and bring his body in if possible,"
was the answer at last. Then one lay down to sleep the sleep of
exhaustion, the other to watch and mourn.</p>

<p>Over-tired men seldom sleep soundly. Some rambling words from
the haunted sleeper roused the watcher's attention. He listened,
as the dreamer restlessly babbled out his secret. He understood
it all, and for an instant his hand was on his revolver; but no.
He would have proof, then&mdash;</p>

<p>Next morning, with the black boy, he was on his way before the
stars were paling. Proof was easily forthcoming by the tracks.
The body of his young friend lay by itself on the plain; no
horse-tracks led to it, none from it. He had died by himself, and
the story of staying with him to the last was false. What use in
following the trail back further? He returned to the camp with
vengeance in his heart.</p>

<p>It was easily done. The other suspected nothing. One morning
the two rode out together for a last look to the southward before
returning. Twenty miles from the camp they stopped at a scanty
belt of timber; beyond was nothing but a boundless plain.</p>

<p>"Get up one of the trees," said the avenger, "you may be able
to see a little better from that elevation."</p>

<p>The other dismounted and complied. He stood on the highest
limb, no great height, and looked all around; nothing visible but
the blue mirage. He looked below. His companion was a hundred
yards, or more, away leading his horse. He stopped for an instant
and turned in his saddle, and the words smote on the listener's
ear hotter than the blazing sun-beams:</p>

<p>"As you served that poor murdered boy, so I serve you. If by
any miracle you survive and I hear of you again amongst men I
will take your life wherever I find you."</p>

<p>Then he turned and rode away, deaf to calls and
entreaties.</p>

<p>Stumbling over the plain, now cursing in impotent rage, now
begging and praying for mercy, the guilty man followed the silent
figure leading the horse. Followed it until his sweat-blinded
eyes could see no longer, and the poor, abandoned wretch felt the
lonely horror of the desert encircle him, for he knew he should
never see the face of his fellow man again.</p>

<p>He reached the camp during the night. It was deserted. The
threat was carried out to the letter. Aye, more, for a ghost sat
there by the dead embers, that he only could see, but it drove
him forth into the night, and with desperate, hopeless purpose he
made for the haunts of men. Who knows what he suffered before his
dying footsteps led him to the dry hole, and he crawled under the
nearest shade to pant his life out?</p>

<p><br>
NEXT morning the recruited birds take wing for the
drought-smitten plains once more, leaving the body of their
comrade to keep company with that of the murderer.</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>13. -- A STRANGE OCCURRENCE ON HUCKEY'S CREEK</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 11 Dec 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
THE heat haze hung like a mist over the plain. Everything seen
through it appeared to palpitate and quiver, although not a
breath of air was stirring. The three men, sitting under the
iron-roofed verandah of the little roadside inn, at which they
had halted and turned out their horses for a mid-day spell, were
drenched with perspiration and tormented to the verge of insanity
by flies. The horses, finding it too hot to keep up even the
pretence of eating, had sought what shade they could find, and
stood there in pairs, head to tail.</p>

<p>"Blessed if there isn't a loony of some kind coming across the
plain," said one of the men suddenly.</p>

<p>The others looked, and could make out an object that was
coming along the road that led across the open, but the quivering
of the atmosphere prevented them distinguishing the figure
properly until within half-a-mile of the place.</p>

<p>"Hanged if I don't believe it's a woman!" said the man who had
first spoken, whose name was Tom Devlin.</p>

<p>"It is so," said the other two, after a pause.</p>

<p>Devlin walked to where the water-bags had been hung to cool,
and, taking one down, went out into the glaring sunshine to meet
the approaching figure.</p>

<p>It was a woman. Weary, worn-out, and holding in her hand a dry
and empty water-bag. Although only middle-aged, she had that
tanned and weather-beaten appearance that all women get, sooner
or later, in North Queensland.</p>

<p>With a sigh of gratitude she took the water-bag from Tom's
hand and put the bottle-mouth to her lips, bush fashion. There is
no more satisfactory drink in the world for a thirsty person than
that to be obtained straight from the nozzle of a water-bag.</p>

<p>Tom regarded the woman pityingly. She was dressed in common
print and a coarse straw hat, and looked like the wife of a
teamster.</p>

<p>"Where have you come from, missus, and what brought you
here?"</p>

<p>"We were camped on Huckey's Creek, and my husband died last
night. I couldn't find the horses this morning, so I started back
here."</p>

<p>"Fifteen miles from here," said Devlin. "We are going to camp
there tonight, and will see after it. You come in and rest."</p>

<p>He took her back to the little inn, where she could get
something to eat and a room to lie down in. Then they caught
their horses and started, promising to look up the strayed
animals and attend to everything, according to the directions the
woman gave them.</p>

<p>The three men arrived at Huckey's Creek about an hour before
sundown. They examined the place thoroughly, but neither dray,
horses, nor anything else was visible. The marks of a camp and
the tracks bore out the woman's story, but that was all.</p>

<p>"Deuced strange!" said Devlin. "Somebody must have come along
and shook the things, but what did they do with the man's body?
They wouldn't hawk that about with them."</p>

<p>"Here's the mailman coming," said one of the others, as a man
coming towards them with a pack-horse hove in sight.</p>

<p>They awaited his approach, standing dismounted on the bank of
the creek. The mailman's thirsty horses plunged their noses deep
in the water and drank greedily.</p>

<p>"I say, you fellows," he called out, "you didn't see a woman
on foot about anywhere, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tom, "she is back at the shanty."</p>

<p>"Wait till I come up," said the mailman. When his horses had
finished he rode the bank to the others.</p>

<p>"Such a queer go," he said. "About five or six miles from here
I met a tilted dray with horses, driven by a man who looked
downright awful. He pulled up, and so did I. Then he said,
staring straight before him, and not looking at me, 'You didn't
meet a woman on foot, mate, did you?'</p>

<p>"I told him no, and asked him where he was going. 'Oh,' he
said, just in the same queer way, 'I'm going on until I overtake
her.'</p>

<p>"'You'd best turn back,' I said. 'It's twenty-five miles to
the next water; and I tell you I'd have been bound to see her.'
He shook his head and drove on, and you say the woman's back at
the shanty?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's about the rummiest start I ever come across. The
woman turned up at Britten's today, about 1 o'clock, on foot, and
said that her husband died during the night; that she could not
find the horses, and had come in on foot for help."</p>

<p>"I suppose he wasn't dead, after all, and when the horses came
in for water he harnessed up and went ahead, looking for his
wife, in a dazed, stupid sort of a way."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is it," said Devlin. "Are you going on to
Britten's tonight?" he asked the mailman.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You might tell the woman that her husband has come-to, and
started on with the dray. After we have had a spell, we'll go
after him. He can't be far."</p>

<p>"No," replied the mailman, as he prepared to ride off. "He
looked like a death's-head when I saw him. So-long."</p>

<p>The men turned their horses out and had a meal and a smoke; by
this time they were talking about starting when the noise of an
approaching dray attracted their attention.</p>

<p>"He's coming back himself," said Tom.</p>

<p>The dray crossed the creek and made for the old camp, where
the driver pulled-up and got out. The full moon and risen, and it
was fairly light.</p>

<p>"Don't speak," said Devlin; "let us see what he is going to
do."</p>

<p>The figure unharnessed the horses with much groaning, and
hobbled them; then it took its blankets out of the dray and
spread them underneath and lay down.</p>

<p>"Let's see if we can do anything for him," said Devlin, and
they approached.</p>

<p>"Can we help you, mate?" he asked.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>He spoke again. Still silence.</p>

<p>"Strike a match, Bill," he said; "it's all shadow under the
dray." Bill did as desired, and Devlin peered in. He started
back.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he cried, "the man <i>did</i> die when the woman said.
He's been dead forty-eight hours!"</p>

<h3><i>The Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney, 29 Apr 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
JIM TURNER sat in the verandah of his modest homestead reading
a letter. The mailman had just left the bag, and amongst the
miscellaneous contents was a letter from an old friend, one Dick
Beveridge, and in the contents was an item of information which
made him feel rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"You perhaps have not heard that Charley Moore is dead, and
how he died. His horse fell on him and crippled him. He lay there
for four and twenty hours before he was found, and then he had
been only dead for about one hour. The ants were swarming over
him. Fancy what he must have suffered! So now that he is gone,
you and I are the last of the five."</p>

<p>Five of them. Yes, he remembered it well&mdash;five of them,
eager, young, and hopeful, who came into the untrodden district
just sixteen years ago. They found good country, and each took up
a run. Now there was only Beveridge and himself alive, and the
other three had all died violent deaths. How distinctly he
recalled the occurrence, which had given rise to the looming fate
that seemed to be overhanging them.</p>

<p>They were camped one afternoon on the bank of the river; the
same river he could now see from the verandah, bordered by
luxuriant-foliaged tea-trees, with flocks of white cockatoos
screaming and frolicking amongst the bushes, varied by flights of
the Blue Mountain parrots crowding and chattering round the white
flowers.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Moore, "there are some niggers coming." Across
the wide stretch of sand on the opposite bank some wandering
blacks from the back country had just put in an appearance.
Tired, thirsty, and burdened with their children and their camp
furniture, they trooped down the bank to the water, and drank at
the grateful pool in the river bed.</p>

<p>"What a start it would give them to drop a bullet in amongst
them," said Daveney; "I'm blessed if I don't do it."</p>

<p>"Take care you don't hit one; there are a lot of gins and
children amongst them," said Moore.</p>

<p>Daveney took up his carbine and fired. There was a start of
dismay amongst the natives, and they bolted up the bank. One
stopped behind a black patch prostrate on the sand.</p>

<p>"By heavens, you've hit one, you clumsy fool," said Beveridge,
and the whole party went across the sand to the water. Not only
one, but two, had been hit. The Martini bullet had gone clean
through a gin's body and killed the baby she had been nursing.
The gin was still alive. She looked at the white faces still
gazing down at her, and commenced to talk. What she said of
course none of them could understand, but that it was a wild
tirade of vengeance against the murderers of her child and
herself they could pretty well understand. Death cut her speech
short, and almost at the same time there was a wild yell from the
bank above, and a shower of spears fell amongst the run-hunters.
Only one man was hit badly, and that was Daveney, the man who
fired the fatal shot. The blacks had retreated after throwing
their spears, and the whites helped their wounded comrade across
to camp. Pursuit was impossible; the evening was well on, and by
the time the horses could be got together the blacks would be
beyond reach.</p>

<p>Then Turner's memory recalled Daveney's death in raging
delirium, when the tropic sun had inflamed his wound, and fever
had set in.</p>

<p>"Keep that gin away, can't you? Why do you let her stop there
talking, talking, talking? What is she saying? You will all die,
die violent deaths. Ha! Ha! Ha! Funny a myall blackgin can talk
such good English, but that's what she says, 'You will die
violent deaths!' Keep her away, you fellows, can't you? There's
no sense in letting her stand talking there!"</p>

<p>He died, and was buried in a lovely valley, where never a
white man has been near since.</p>

<p>Then Strathdon was drowned in the wreck of the
<i>Gothenburg</i>, and now Moore had met a horrible fate.</p>

<p>Turner got up with a shudder. Who would go next, he or
Beveridge? He had no wish to die just then. He had but lately
married, and in a few years the station would be clear of all
back debt. He took up the letter, and read it through. At the end
Beveridge said, "I am coming your way, and will see you in a few
days."</p>

<p>Turner banished all memories of the past, and went in and ate
a hearty dinner and his fair young wife congratulated him on his
good appetite.</p>

<p>Beveridge came in due time. Like Turner, he had seemingly
banished dull care, and had chosen to ignore the doom that
strangely enough seemed hanging over him. Nay, he even declined
to talk of it with his host, and resolutely declared it was "all
bosh."</p>

<p>It was a sultry, thunderous evening, and Turner and his wife,
with their precious first baby, had driven their guest out to a
point of interest in the neighborhood, and were returning, when
the thunderstorm suddenly burst over their heads. Turner kept his
horses going, but the rain overtook them some five miles from the
homestead, and pelted them in their faces.</p>

<p>Then came a flash, and darkness, as though the electric fluid
had struck their eyeballs blind. With the flash came a roar, as
though the world was splitting in twain, and then the horses,
which had bolted off the road, went headlong into a wire fence,
instead of pulling up at the sliprails.</p>

<p>"It's as dark as pitch," said Turner, getting on his legs
unhurt. "Where are you all?" There was no answer, and he
commenced groping about, and came on the struggling horses.
"Whoa! Beveridge, man, where are you? It can't be night, but it's
all dark. Didn't you see that cursed old gin standing in the road
and startling the horses? Beveridge!"</p>

<p>One of the men fortunately came along and found Turner,
stricken blind, crouching against a tree. One of the horses was
dead, with a broken neck; the other was much cut about with the
wire. The baby was uninjured, and Mrs. Turner was unconscious;
while Beveridge's head had been smashed in by the hoof of one of
the struggling horses; he was dead.</p>

<p>Mrs. Turner recovered, but her unfortunate husband never did,
and to the day when a merciful death took him away from the blind
earth, whose beauty he would see no more, he asserted that the
last thing he saw was the form of a black gin, with a child in
her arms, standing in front of the sliprails and blocking the
horses.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>15. -- A DOOMED MAN</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney, 3 Nov 1900<br>
Illustration by Percy Spence, 1868-1933</h3>

<p class="first">
THE Great Reef was just awash, pools of water lying here and
there, between the stretches of bare reef where the coral was
visible in many fantastic forms. To the eastward the distant
coast of Queensland, one red headland standing out in to the sea,
and behind it the hazy blue range. Between the two the reef and
the coast, a stretch of calm, blue sunlit water.</p>

<p>The little schooner lay idly on a sandy islet at the edge of
the reef, on which had been erected some rude frames for drying
and curing the <i>bêche-de-mer</i>. Some of the natives from the
main land were engaged in the work of collecting the slugs and
keeping the fires going to smoke them, after they had been split
open and kept distended by means of the insertion of a short
piece of stick.</p>

<p>The skipper of the little craft and his mate were lounging on
the deck, talking and smoking, when their attention was attracted
by the approach of two canoes from the mainland, both of them
perilously full of occupants.</p>

<p>"What have the beggars come off for?" said the captain.</p>

<p>"To see their friends," replied the mate. "I wish they'd stay
away."</p>

<p>"They're coming here. Don't let them come on board," said the
captain.</p>

<p>One canoe approached, with the apparent intention of paying
the schooner a visit; but when the mate motioned them off they
stopped paddling, and one tall fellow stood up and made signs
that he wanted to speak to them; meantime the other canoe was
paddling to the <i>bêche-de mer</i> camp.</p>

<p>"He's holding a shell up," said the mate, referring to the
blackfellow standing up in the canoe. "Shall we let them come
alongside and see what they want?"</p>

<p>"Yes; may as well."</p>

<p>The natives were beckoned to approach, and when they reached
the side the man handed up the shell he had been showing, and
some others. It was good pearl shell, and the captain and his
mate studied it critically.</p>

<p>"Now, where on earth did he get this?" said the mate.</p>

<p>"Stole it off one of the luggers probably," returned the
captain. He inquired of the natives, by signs where the shell
came from, and in return the black pointed towards the north, and
indicated the action of diving, nearly capsizing the canoe in so
doing.</p>

<p>"Wonder whether there's any truth in it? Nebsworth got on a
good bank that the Binghis told him of&mdash;do you remember?"
said the skipper.</p>

<p>"If any wind comes up we could go and see; the <i>bêche-de
mer</i> will be fit for bagging to morrow."</p>

<p>The captain explained to the nigger that he should go with
them to-morrow and point out the place where he got the shell. He
gave them some biscuit and tobacco, and they went off, apparently
satisfied.</p>

<p>Next morning the <i>bêche-de-mer</i> was stowed on board
bright and early, and with a steady breeze from the south-east
the schooner set off on her quest, having on board the tall
blackfellow, who had volunteered, to show them where the shell
was obtained. The canoes left for the mainland, taking with them
the Binghis, or natives, who had been engaged smoking the
<i>bêche-de-mer</i>, and the little sandy inlet was left
tenantless.</p>

<p>About fifteen miles further up the coast than their former
position, they came to a small inlet or cove&mdash;a
semi-circular little bay, where the mountain range approached
close to the sea. The dense jungle from the spurs of the range
descended to the beach and mingled with the mangroves on all the
landward side of the little bay. Although the afternoon was
bright and sunny the place had a. gloomy look and a depressing
effect upon the spirits of the men. The schooner was run up in
the wind, and anchored, for this was the place where the
blackfellow said that he had got the pearl shell.</p>

<p>The boat was lowered, and the captain, with two of the colored
crew, pulled to the exact spot which the blackfellow indicated.
The mate, watching them from the deck of the schooner, saw the
native who had accompanied them, dive from the boat into the
water. He came up again with a shell in his hands; and then the
mate saw the captain peer over the side of the boat and look
intently into the water. Presently the men commenced to pull back
to the schooner.</p>

<p>"Find the bank?" said the mate, as the boat camp
alongside.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the captain; "that is, we found where he got
the shell from. There is a sunken lugger lying there; she had the
shell on board. Come and see her."</p>

<p>The mate dropped into the boat, and they pulled back to the
place. The bright sunlight made the water clear to see through,
and down below them was a lugger, mastless, and lying over on her
side. One of the kanakas now went down several times. He reported
that she had been full of shell when she sank, and that it could
be easily salvaged. On his second dive he brought up a ghastly
relic&mdash;a human skull, showing a deep cut in the temple.</p>

<p>"Is that a white man's or a blackfellows?" said the mate.</p>

<p>"I can't tell; but the poor fellow was certainly not
drowned."</p>

<p>"Seems to have been foul play of some sort. Shall we get the
shell up?"</p>

<p>"May as well," said the captain; "It won't take us long, and
it will pay us well."</p>

<p>As he spoke the sun dropped behind the range, and its gloomy
shadow was cast over the place where the boat lay motionless. The
water at once lost its transparency, and the wreck disapppeared
from view. The boat put back to the schooner, and as the night
closed in the two white men speculated on the owner of the lugger
and the probable fate of the crew. The mate put it down to the
colored crew, who had murdered the Malay diver and escaped
ashore. The captain, on the other hand, ascribed it to an attack
by natives, when the lugger had anchored for shelter in a
storm.</p>

<p>"Where's that Binghi, by the way?" he asked.</p>

<p>Wherever he was, he was not on board, and they concluded he
must have quietly slipped overboard and swam ashore.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't like this place, and I don't like his leaving us like
that. If there was any wind at all I'd stand-off for the night
and come in to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>There was no wind, however a beautiful full moon rose in a
calm and cloudless sky, and soon everything was bathed in white
light, save only the dark and shadowy places in the black scrub
that was so close around them.</p>

<p>"We'll keep watch and watch to-night," went on the captain.
"No good trusting kanakas to watch."</p>

<p>About midnight the captain came up to relieve the mate.</p>

<p>"All quiet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's fireflies knocking about, but there's what
looks like firesticks been cruising about all round in the scrub.
See them, there?"'</p>

<p>"Fireflies," said the captain; "see how they wink&mdash;a
firestick would be steady. Go and turn in. I'll call you at
daybreak, and we'll start getting that shell up and get out of
this. I don't like the place a bit."</p>

<p>Hour after hour of the captain's watch, however, passed
without any disturbance, and he began to look seaward to see if
the stars near the horizon were paling before the coming
dawn.</p>

<p>Gradually a white light grew in the east, and the minor stars
vanished, leaving only the brighter constellations burning to
defy the coming day. As the white was changing to pink, the
captain took a belaying pin, and beat loudly on the deck with it.
The echoes from the ranges round about hammered back in sympathy.
The birds in the scrub began chattering, and as the mate and the
crew came on desk the captain gave a sigh of relief that the
night and all its gloomy fancies had passed away.</p>

<p>"If we can't recover all the shell to-day, I am going to stand
out to sea to-night, and come back for it. I don't know what's
the matter, with me; but I would not pass another night here for
anything."</p>

<p>The tide was running out, and it was easy to let the schooner
drift down until she was over the wreck, which they had buoyed
the night before.</p>

<p>As there was a diving suit on board, and one of the crew was a
bit of a diver, for the schooner had been prospecting for shell
as well as <i>bêche-de-mer</i>, preparations were made to get the
shell up quickly, as recovering it by swimming diving would be a
very long and profitless process.</p>

<p>"I feel a trifle tired," said the captain to his mate. "I'll
lie down for an hour or two till you're ready."</p>

<p>"Do," returned the mate; "you look a bit off."</p>

<p>The mate was busy at work, and all things were ready for the
diver to make his first descent, when the captain appeared on
deck again. The look on his face made the mate go up to him and
ask him if he were ill. The skipper put his face down upon his
hands, and shuddered.</p>

<p>"Not ill," he said; "but, oh! I had such an awful dream. I
can't tell you now&mdash;I will when we get away. Dick, we must
get out of this place by daylight, or I never shall leave
it."</p>

<p>"Take a stiff nip of rum, old man; you're all unnerved. Now
we'll go to work, and you'll for get your dream."</p>

<p>The captain followed the mate's advice, and gradually the
morbid feeling wore off; and, engaged in the bustle of getting
the shell on board, he partially forgot it.</p>

<p>It was some two hours afterwards that he was leaning against
the tiller smoking and watching operations, when glancing
for'ard, he saw a sight that for the moment paralysed him.
Climbing over the bows was a crowd of armed natives. The whole
attention of the crew being engaged on one side of the schooner,
the blacks had sneaked up on the other without being noticed.
Levelling his revolver on the leader, as he shouted to the crew,
the captain fired, and the treacherous black who had lured them
there fell dead.</p>

<p>The crew, attacked by overpowering numbers, fought hard, the
mate fortunately having his revolver on him, which he used to
some purpose. Things were looking desperate, however, when
suddenly the diver came to the surface, mounting the short ladder
hung over the side.</p>

<p>At the appearance of the strange helmeted monster above the
low rail of the schooner, the blacks, with a yell of
consternation, gave way, and jumped overboard, the crew following
them up, until the deck was cleared of all but the dead and
dying.</p>

<p>"By Jove, that was a close shave!" said the mate, as he fired
a parting shot wherever he saw a head above water. Then he looked
round, and gave a cry of dismay. Across the tiller, which still
held him in a partially upright position, was the body of the
captain, with a spear through his heart.</p>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>16. -- THE GHOST'S VICTORY</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 19 Dec 1891</h3>

<p class="first">
"THIS is a tough contract," murmured the ghost, as it gazed
out of the window of the haunted chamber and looked up and down
the almost deserted street. Needless to say it was Christmas Eve,
and the clocks had just struck twelve.</p>

<p>It was not at all an awe-inspiring ghost. If one had not known
for certain that it was a spectre it might have been taken for a
shabby old debt-collector or a hanged bailiff; but it was a
genuine goblin, and anybody infringing the trade-mark will be
prosecuted.</p>

<p>The house it haunted was an old stone affair, situated on a
good-sized allotment in one of the principal streets of Sydney.
Most people have passed the place and wondered why it was so dull
and murky and desolate, and why a tattered bill always announced
that the upper part was "to let." It was owned by an absentee
landlord, and there was a law-suit on it, and three mortgages.
Around it was a solemn, melancholy waste, tenanted by old
jam-tins and goats. The ground-floor was supposed to be occupied
as offices, whilst the upper portion was left to
solitude&mdash;and the ghost.</p>

<p>This was the spectre's grievance. Thirty years before it had
cut its throat there, and since entering into the land of spirits
it had not had a single opportunity of frightening anybody and
achieving a reputation. It had made just one public appearance,
and then it fell flat. It was an orthodox apparition, and as
such, was strictly obliged to appear only between mid-night and
cockcrow; but nobody lived in the house, nobody knew it was
haunted, nobody cared whether it was haunted or not. So there it
had remained, a poor, forlorn, neglected ghost, living alone in
the dark and damp, all forgotten.</p>

<p>"Christmas again," it muttered in spectral grammar, "and I am
still unknown. O! if I were only one of those modern young ghosts
who go round visiting friends and relations and scaring the wits
out of them; but, no! I am old-fashioned and must abide by the
rules of the game. Why, I might have heaps of hidden money here
to show people for aught the public know." Then it fell to musing
over the one chance that had fallen its way.</p>

<p>It had been gazing sadly out of the window as usual at about
one o'clock in the morning, when there came the sound of unsteady
steps down the street. Presently, a stout old gentleman in
evening dress, with his hat on one side and an overcoat on his
arm, stopped suddenly in front of the gate and gazed curiously at
the building. Would he come in? The ghost's heart beat fast with
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Astonishing!" said the old gentleman. "How on earth did I get
home so quick? Don't remember the tram&mdash;don't remember the
train. My house, though, right enough." He opened the crazy gate
and lurched in.</p>

<p>"At last, at last!" cried the apparition, restraining itself
by a might effort from appearing on the verandah and prematurely
flushing its game.</p>

<p>The old gentleman tried to put a latch-key in the door, but as
there was no keyhole he failed. Then he kicked, and knocked, and
swore. Finally he coiled himself up on the verandah, and after a
grunt or two went fast asleep.</p>

<p>Then the exultant spectre passed through the crack underneath
the door, and stood contemplating its unconscious victim. But all
the old gentleman did was to turn over and say pettishly, as he
dragged his coat over his shoulders, "Don't Maria!"</p>

<p>This put the ghost on its mettle. It laid an ice-cold hand on
the sleeper, and, in a thrilling whisper, said, "Awake!"</p>

<p>The old gentleman sat up and blinked at the vision of the
dead, and the vision regarded the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Right, old boy!" said the latter. "I'll wake up in time,
never fear. Bring me a stiff brandy-and-soda at it. Good night.
Go'bless you!" and he laid down again and snored.</p>

<p>This was maddening. A ghost to be mistaken for a waiter and
told to bring a brandy-and-soda in the morning! It fled through
the top window to the haunted chamber and sat down on the
bloodstain and cried.</p>

<p>Time passed, but no other mortal visited the haunted house
between midnight and daylight. Other ghosts came. Ghosts who were
allowed out at nights; and they used to tell the old deceased
inhabitant what joyous times they had; but that only made things
worse. Sometimes it thought that a burglar might break in during
the small hours and give it a chance; but, then, the occupants of
the two alleged offices hadn't enough between them to allure any
respectable burglar; and the burglars knew it.</p>

<p>Sorrowfully the poor old apparition mused, and if it could
only have repeated the operation of cutting its throat, it would
have done so out of sheer desperation and ennui.</p>

<p>At that moment the sound of approaching footsteps broke the
stillness.</p>

<p>Two men, in earnest conversation, halted opposite the gate,
and, by the light of the street lamp, the ghost saw that one of
them was the occupant of the offices. He was some sort of
agent&mdash;general commission&mdash;and, as the ghost knew, his
principal occupation was hiding behind some old tanks in the back
yard when his creditors called, which they did constantly. The
old ghost, in its invisible state, used to do a good deal of
wandering about in the day-time.</p>

<p>After a few minutes more talk the two men came in, and the
agent proceeded to unlock the door.</p>

<p>The ghost nearly shrieked with joy. How should it make the
most startling appearance? It decided to await them in the
passage and shake its gaunt arms in the shadows.</p>

<p>The agent struck a match, opened the door of his office, and
was about entering, followed by his companion, when by the
expiring light of the match, the latter caught a glimpse of the
apparition standing at the end of the passage.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Somebody living here?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," said the agent, who had lit another match, and was
searching for a candle.</p>

<p>"Thought I saw something at the end of the passage."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Cats, I suppose. This is a regular meeting place of
theirs;" and the agent picked up an empty stone ink-bottle and,
going to the door, hurled it down the passage, crying, "Shoo! get
out!" Then he shut the office-door.</p>

<p>The ink-bottle went clean through the ghost, but the insult
hurt it worse. First, to be taken for a waiter, then to be
"shoo'ed" at for a cat. It approached the office vowing
vengeance, and tramping frantically with the spectres of its old
shadow feet on the floor. It was about to pass through the door,
and, with a blood-curdling shriek appear before them with its
gashed and bleeding throat, but a few words it heard arrested it.
The ghost stopped and listened.</p>

<p>"Come, Tom, hurry up and get me those papers I left with you;
I must go on board, we start at five sharp," said the younger man
to the agent.</p>

<p>Tom sat on the edge of the rickety deal table, swinging one
leg moodily to and fro, but made no attempt to move.</p>

<p>"You know how frightfully hard up we've been?" he said at
last.</p>

<p>"Of course I do; has not my sister told me all about it
to-day, and, as you know, I gave her all the money I could to
keep you going for a bit. I can do no more. Give me the
papers."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the agent, getting up, desperately and
defiantly, "I haven't got them."</p>

<p>"Not got them!" repeated the other. "God Almighty, man! what
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Mean what I say."</p>

<p>"What have you done with them?" cried the younger,
fiercely.</p>

<p>"The bank has them as security."</p>

<p>The agent's brother-in-law gazed at him in silence. "Do you
know," he said at last, quite quickly, "that you have ruined
me?"</p>

<p>"I can redeem them and send them to you overland," muttered
the other, with white lips.</p>

<p>"Bah! you redeem them; how?" and he glanced round the
poverty-stricken room. "Even if you had the money, or could get
it, how could you redeem them before Monday? This is Friday, and
before you could forward them we should have left Brisbane.
You've ruined yourself, and now you've ruined me."</p>

<p>The agent said nothing, and his companion walked impatiently
up and down the room.</p>

<p>"How much did you get advanced on them?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"And what became of it?"</p>

<p>"Speculated with it. That was the temptation. I knew of such a
safe thing."</p>

<p>"Such a safe thing!" said the other, mockingly.</p>

<p>There was silence for a time. The younger man continued his
wild-beast walk, and the agent leant against the table with
folded arms and eyes cast down.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, but the ghost was not impatient; after
thirty years of loneliness, this little tragedy was interesting.
Besides, it had cut its throat for doing almost the same thing
the agent had done. Would the agent cut his throat? In that case
he would also become a ghost.</p>

<p>"I dare not go back without those deeds," said the young man
at last. "How do you propose to get them back?"</p>

<p>"I think I can borrow the money."</p>

<p>"If that is all I have to rely on, why, they are gone. Well,
if it comes to the worst, I must go to the bank and demand their
restitution as stolen property. I don't know how the law stands,
but I believe they will give them up and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Prosecute me," said the agent.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I will do my duty, even though it puts you in
gaol."</p>

<p>"You will put me in gaol, will you?" snarled the agent,
walking up to his companion with an ugly look on his face.</p>

<p>The ghost executed a double shuffle in his joy, and pressed
about in the passage. There was going to be a murder, and he
would have another ghost to bear him company.</p>

<p>The young man confronted his brother-in-law, and said quietly,
"If every other means fails, I must inform the bank, and after
that I cannot interfere."</p>

<p>Tom fell back, and said, after a pause, "You had better leave
me. I must try and think of some way out of this."</p>

<p>The other seemed in no hurry to stay, and walked to the door
merely remarking, "I will see you this afternoon." Then the front
door slammed behind him, and the house was left to the agent and
the ghost.</p>

<p>Was the agent going to cut his throat? The ghost looked
anxiously in; such an opportunity was worth waiting thirty years
for.</p>

<p>Was he going to cut his throat? Nothing of the sort. The agent
looked quite relieved, as though an unpleasant task had at last
been got over. He lit another candle and turned towards the
old-fashioned fireplace on one side of the room. The ghost
watched him curiously. It was a hearth for burning wood; and the
agent prised up one of the side stones, and from a whole
underneath took out a large cash-box; put it on the table, and
opened it. The spirit rushed through the wall unseen, and looked
over his shoulder. The box was full of sovereigns. The agent
counted them over with a sigh of relief, replaced the box in its
hiding place, and made ready to go.</p>

<p>The apparition had passed through the wall again into the dark
passage. It would never do to scare the agent now; he was coming
back for that box, and then&mdash;the ghost hugged itself in
anticipation. The agent closed and locked his door; slammed the
front door after him and departed. The ghost stopped behind and
chuckled. It was all plain as the proverbial pikestaff, and to be
summed up in one word, "bolt." The five hundred pounds had not
gone in speculation; they were in the cash-box, besides other
little pickings. The spectre reckoned it all up on its shadowy
fingers; holiday time, crowds travelling about, best chance in
the world to get away; he's off, with whatever he can lay his
hands on, leaves his wife and children to do the best they can,
robs his brother-in-law, and ruins the people who own those
deeds; now, how can I circumvent him?</p>

<p>The ghost fell into a brown study. "If I could only
materialise myself like some of those new fangled spirits say
they can, I might collar that money and tell the young fellow all
about it, but I can't. If I appear before him I shall scare him,
and then&mdash;he might not come back here. I'll best that fellow
though if I...."&mdash;die for it, the ghost was about to say,
but as he had done that already he changed the expression. Just
then the daylight lightened the eastern sky, and it vanished, but
its face wore a look of satisfaction that was not on it before;
evidently the apparition had an idea.</p>

<p>Christmas day passed in the usual manner, so far as the ghost
was concerned; that is to say, nobody came near the place, and it
either sat on the blood-spot or looked out of the window.
Midnight struck, and the ghost was happy. It had six hours of
visibility before it, and in a shadowy sort of way it cleared the
desk for action.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve the agent made his appearance carrying a
small portmanteau.</p>

<p>He struck a match before closing the front door, and dropped
it immediately with a yell. Somebody was leaning against the door
of his room, a strange, mouldy-looking little man who smelt
exactly like a damp umbrella. Resisting the impulse to turn and
fly, he waited and listened. There was no sound but the violent
thumping of his own heart. He looked round into the street behind
him to reassure himself, mustered up his nerve, and struck
another match. This time the passage was empty. He wiped the
beads of perspiration from his forehead, and laughed with
considerable difficulty. Then he unlocked his own door, but he
left the front door open. Nobody in his room so far as he could
see with a match, so he lit the candle and&mdash;it was no fancy.
An old man with a ghastly white face and a horrible blood-stain
on his white beard and shirt front was sitting loose in the air
about three feet above the floor. He might have stood his ground
even then, but the thing started to walk through the air towards
him, and, smitten with unreasoning panic, he turned and ran
through the open door, and the triumphant ghost heard his flying
footsteps die away in the distance.</p>

<p>"Now for the other man," muttered the ghost.</p>

<p>One o'clock struck, and in a few minutes the ghost heard
someone entering the house. Both doors were still open and the
candle still burning, so the newcomer walked straight in. He
stopped short inside the room. Seated at the table where he
expected to find his relative was a seedy old gentleman who, in
spite of the heat, had his coat buttoned right to the neck and
his collar turned up. The visitor was silent with astonishment,
but the spectre grinned at him in an amiable manner and he
faltered at last:</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"So glad you spoke," said the apparition, blandly. "You see
I'm a ghost, and, of course, I can't speak first. Not allowed by
the regulations. Now, don't be frightened and run away, because I
want to do you a good turn. How do you feel? Quite well?"</p>

<p>"You're a ghost? But I don't believe in them. It's a
joke."</p>

<p>"Don't be sceptical, young man. Shall I walk through the table
or do any little absurdity of that sort? But, no! you've more
sense than that. Listen: Your brother-in-law is a thief, you
know, but he is worse than you think. He did not lose the money
the bank advanced him. He has it all in a cash box under that
stone. Lift it up and see. He was going to bolt. There is his
portmanteau."</p>

<p>As in a dream, the live man advanced and did as the dead man
directed him. Sure enough he lifted out a weighty cash-box.</p>

<p>"If I were you," said the ghost, "I would go straight to his
house with that, and make him open it in front of your sister.
His wife, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Poor woman! Well, good morning, my boy. Wish you luck."</p>

<p>The young man halted at the door. "Is there any little thing I
can do, sir, to show my gratitude?"</p>

<p>"There is. Now and again, say at intervals of a few months,
persuade someone to come here between midnight and daylight. A
sceptic, if possible. I won't give them much of a fright."</p>

<p>"Rely on me. I have half-a-dozen in my mind's eye already;"
and he backed rather rapidly out into the street.</p>

<p>"A nice young man," said the ghost. "Now, I wonder if that
other fellow is coming back. If he wants to clear out before
daylight he'll face anything to get that money."</p>

<p>Sure enough, in about an hour's time, the agent came back. He
had been somewhere in quest of Dutch courage, and was
pot-valiant. The candle had gone out, but he lit another, and
glared about the room.</p>

<p>"Now, where are you?" he cried. "Come out and frighten me
again if you can. I've got something here for you." Looking
through the wall the ghost saw he was flourishing a revolver.</p>

<p>Cursing himself for a fool for running away before, he put the
weapon down and went to the hearth. The cry he gave when he
discovered his loss was tremendous. He sprang to his feet, and
there, glaring at him across the table, was the old man with the
gashed throat. Then three shots were fired in quick succession.
Two of them went through the spectre. The third went through the
agent.</p>

<p>There are two ghosts in that old house now. One occupies the
upper, the one the lower portion&mdash;but they are not on
speaking terms.</p>

<h3><i>The Bulletin,</i> Sydney, 17 Dec 1892</h3>

<p class="first">
"STEADY now, old man; do you feel better? Here! Hold hard!
<i>I'm</i> not a nigger."</p>

<p>The wounded man had struggled desperately as though still
struggling with his foes.</p>

<p>One dead white man, speared through the body; one with his
head cut open, whom the speaker was trying to revive, and four
dead blacks, lying on their faces with outstretched
arms&mdash;the posture in which niggers usually die who meet with
a violent death. The sun had set, and darkness was rapidly
closing in. Presently the wounded man regained his senses
somewhat.</p>

<p>"How's Joe?" he asked</p>

<p>"If Joe is your mate, I'm afraid it's all up with him, as it
would have been with you if I had not come. Not but what you had
done pretty well before I came. I can only account for one," and
he motioned towards the dead.</p>

<p>"Yes; I remember. Joe was speared at the start. He was picking
wood for the fire. How did you come here?"</p>

<p>"I've been after horses all day, and was on my way home when I
heard the row. I got here just as you had this crack on the head;
and the niggers cleared. I suppose you fellows were bound for the
Cloncurry?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Poor old Joe! Are you quite sure he is dead?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. Now, what's the best thing to do about you? I
suppose you can't rise?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head wearily.</p>

<p>"It's fifteen miles to the station. The boss has got a buggy
in there, and we'll bring it out for you if you are game to stop
here alone while I go. I'll be back by daylight. There's no fear
of the blacks turning up again, I know the run of these
fellows."</p>

<p>"I'm game," said the wounded man faintly.</p>

<p>"Right. I'll load your revolver up for you, and be back as
soon as I can. Keep your pecker up, you're safe enough here."</p>

<p>With this rough but kindly consolation the stockman departed,
and the survivor of the two men who had been suddenly attacked by
the natives when camping, was left alone. Not a pleasant
position, but nerves are not supposed to be known in the outside
country.</p>

<p>There was a first-quarter moon, and the shadows soon got
darker and darker beneath its feeble light. The man with the
broken head had quite recovered his consciousness but he still
felt dizzy and weak. It was an awful time to wait until daylight.
Supposing the niggers came back again after all! Then he recalled
all the stories he had heard of the blacks mutilating the dead
bodies of their enemies. If they came back at all it would be for
that. Supposing he was unconscious when they came and they
commenced on him! He must watch all night to prevent that. Poor
Joe, his mate, he wouldn't like him to be cut up by the
darkies.</p>

<p>Surely, he thought, one of the bodies had moved. The moon gave
such a sickly half-light now it was sinking that it was
impossible to make certain. Yes, it was a dark figure creeping up
to Joe's body, not one of the dead ones, for he could still count
them&mdash;one, two, three, four. A live nigger crawling up to
hack Joe about. He took aim and fired. That dropped him, he could
see him writhing in the streak of light that broke through a rift
in the trees. Go and finish him, to save another shot. On his
hands and knees he crawled over, picking up a dropped club on the
way. Then the silence of the night was broken by fierce and heavy
blows, and he crawled back to his tree and fainted.</p>

<p>The moon had set when he opened his eyes again, but, by the
pale light of the stars, he saw, to his horror, another black
shadow approaching the dead body of his mate. Another successful
shot and, full of rage, he again crept over and used the
formidable club. But the savages were not to be deterred; one
after another the dark forms came creeping up, to fall beneath
revolver and club, until at last the man's senses left him.</p>

<p><br>
THE DAY had broken, but the sun was not yet up, when the
stockman and another man drove up in the buggy. They jumped out,
and hastened to the apparent sleeper, but he was dead.</p>

<p>"Have the niggers been back and killed him?"</p>

<p>The stockman shook his head. "I can't make it out&mdash;look
at this club in his hand covered with blood and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two stood up and gazed curiously about. One, two, three,
four black bodies and one red heap.</p>

<p>"He wasn't like that when I left him," said the stockman,
hastily; "he was speared clean."</p>

<p>The head was pounded out of recognition, the body and limbs
smashed by maniacal blows; the corpse of the wretched Joe was
beaten out of all semblance of humanity.</p>

<p>"There have been no blacks here since I left."</p>

<p>"What can be the meaning of that club in his hand?" was the
reply.</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>18. -- AN UNQUIET SPIRIT</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 3 Nov 1894</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
I HOLD my father's memory in the greatest respect. I have
every reason for doing so.</p>

<p>Although his motives of life and mine were diametrically
opposed, this was never made a bone of contention between us. I
fell into step and marched dutifully with his views until his
death, at a ripe age, left me free to live in a manner more
congenial to my disposition.</p>

<p>My father was a squatter&mdash;a fine healthy fellow of the
old school, that is to say, a man who believed in the work of his
own hands, and was never happy when away from the station. He was
devoted to cattle and horse-breeding, and, although the chances
had many times been presented to him of leasing a huge area, and
stocking it with sheep by the aid of a friendly bank, he had
always steadily refused. Thanks to this, he died fairly well
off.</p>

<p>Many years before his death, I am happy to think, he had
succeeded to the height of his ambition. His compact, if small,
run was as skillfully divided that it could almost work itself.
His cattle were bred to that pitch of perfection that the DAV
brand was known throughout Australia. His horses were sought for
eagerly as hacks or stock horses. To keep everything up to this
standard became the old man's one idea. Method and order were his
fetish, and when he died he left me instructions to bury him in
his working clothes beside the stockyard. The familiar sound of
the trampling hoofs would, he thought, soothe him in the long,
last slumber. I am afraid this idea was not a pronounced
success.</p>

<p>I was twenty-five when my father died. He had been a widower
for twenty years, and soon after I laid him in the grave, in
strict accordance with his wishes, I commenced to look out for a
manager for Braganall Station. Although I had successfully
concealed it during my father's lifetime, I hated bush life as
much as he loved it. He died, happy in the thought that his son
would be a worthy successor in the management of the station he
had created, little dreaming that that son yearned to become a
barrister.</p>

<p>I soon found a competent manager named Dodson, took up my
abode in Sydney, and began reading for the Bar. I had many
advantages; an independent income, a good education, and a
first-rate physical training. I worked hard for nearly a year,
then, feeling the need of a little relaxation, I ran up to
Braganall to spend a few weeks. Everything seemed to be in good
working order, although I could not help noticing a falling off
in little things from the severe discipline of my father's time,
but then I knew he had been a martinet, and laid small stress
upon this.</p>

<p>One evening, as the dusk was closing in, Dodson and I sat
smoking on the verandah in that meditative silence bushmen enjoy
so much. Two of the men, returning to their quarters, passed
within earshot.</p>

<p>"Bill," I heard one of them say in the calm stillness of the
hour, "did yer put them slip-rails on one side?"</p>

<p>"No, I forgot," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Better go back and do it, or Old Danvers will be around after
you!"</p>

<p>Without a word the man turned and went back, and the other
walked on.</p>

<p>What on earth did it mean?</p>

<p>"Old Danvers" was my father.</p>

<p>Dodson must have heard the remark as well. The men, evidently,
had not noticed us, as we were well within the shadow of the
verandah; therefore they had not lowered their voices.</p>

<p>"What does that mean about 'Old Danvers'?" I said.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know," replied Dodson.</p>

<p>This I felt was an untruth. "Mr. Dodson," I remarked in a
severe tone; "I am sure you do know, therefore I expect a plain
answer to my question. What did that man mean by saying that my
father would be around after him?"</p>

<p>Dodson hesitated, then he blurted out: "The men have some
foolish yarn that Mr. Danvers, your father, walks."</p>

<p>"Walks!" I repeated. "His ghost appears?"</p>

<p>"Something of the sort. If anything is left neglected the man
who did it can't rest&mdash;he dreams of your father until he has
to get up and go and do what he left undone, even if it's in the
middle of the night."</p>

<p>I could not help laughing. "The ghost must be a good
overseer," I said; "I suppose your men are always leaving, with
this notion going about?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. They are not a bit afraid&mdash;they say he
always speaks quite kindly to them."</p>

<p>"More in sorrow than in anger," I quoted.</p>

<p>"Precisely so. I saw him once myself. He looked in at my
bedroom window; stared at me until I had to get up. Then I found
that I had left the garden gate open, and one of the milkers had
got in."</p>

<p>I scarcely knew what to think of this communication. Bushmen,
as a rule, are not in the least superstitious&mdash;they have too
much night-work to fancy that the dark hours have uncanny
denizens peculiar to themselves. Although I practiced
cross-examination on Dodson I could get no more out of him, and,
of course, it was useless asking the men. I remained on the
station for another fortnight, but heard nothing more about the
shade of my departed parent.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
TWO months after my visit to Braganall, I was sitting in my
chambers in Sydney, intent on my work, when, happening to raise
my eyes, I saw my father in the room. He was dressed just as he
was buried; he advanced to the table, and, without speaking,
commenced to put the things on it straight. This was an old habit
of his, as I at once recognised. Anything on the table not in its
exact place always annoyed him. When everything was neat and
square he sank into a chair and smiled kindly at me. Now I felt
not the least surprise, strange to say. It seemed the most
natural thing in the world for my father to pay me a visit,
although I was fully aware that he was buried near the stockyard
on Braganall.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," he said, "I don't think you have acted quite fair to
me."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, governor?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why did you not let me know you preferred this sort of
thing?" and he indicated the papers on the table. "I thought you
meant to look after the place yourself."</p>

<p>"Honestly, I should have told you," I replied, "but I thought
you would be more contented if you did not know."</p>

<p>My father shook his head. "I have nothing to say against
Dodson," he went on; "he is a very well-meaning young man, but he
is going to make a great mistake, and I want you to write and
stop him."</p>

<p>I nodded, but kept silence.</p>

<p>My father then went into a detail of station-management with
which I need not trouble the reader. I could see (for was I not
my father's pupil?) that it was just the kind of mistake that a
young and enthusiastic manager like Dodson would fall into. I at
once wrote the letter, and enclosed it in an envelope, my father
watched complacently. When I had finished he said:</p>

<p>"I don't want to annoy you, Jim, but you see it's this way.
I'm in Kama at present."</p>

<p>"Kama?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kama Loka. I am on my way to Devachan, but these little
worries rather delay me, for you see Kama is only an astral
counterpart of our physical existence, and until I am quite
satisfied that I need not bother any more about Braganall my
entity will not be properly established in Devachan."</p>

<p>"I understand," I said, but, of course, I didn't.</p>

<p>My father beamed on me with his old kindly look, and left.</p>

<p>He came to see me on little matters, once or twice after that.
Several people came in and saw him there, but they only took him
for a queer sort of client. Medicine and the law are privileged
that way.</p>

<p>Once, however, he put me out a little, and forced me into the
meanest action of my life. It was at a garden party, and a swell
affair at that, when I suddenly became aware that all eyes were
turned my way, and that my father, in his bush dress, was
standing by me.</p>

<p>"Jim," he said in an undertone, "I can't help it, I've had no
rest for a fortnight. There's the gate-post of the drafting yard
been pushed out of place, the gate doesn't hang plumb, and Dodson
doesn't get it straightened up."</p>

<p>"I'll send him a telegram about it at once," I answered,
hastily.</p>

<p>"You will?" queried the old man. "You know I'll never get to
Devachan at this rate."</p>

<p>"I will," I affirmed, and then, for everyone was looking at
us, I put my hand in my pocket, then into his hand, as though I
was giving alms to a persistent beggar, and he went away
satisfied.</p>

<p>Now, to pass off the shade of one's father as an intrusive
loafer who had to be got rid of at any price, is, I think, the
greatest piece of moral cowardice a man can be guilty of. I have
never fully recovered my self-respect since.</p>

<p>These constant visits, however, made trouble upon the station.
Dodson felt aggrieved that I should be always writing or wiring
up about petty little things that might well be left to him, and,
moreover, concluded that I must have a spy on the place who
supplied me with the information. This led to his resignation,
and put me in such a fix that, in desperation, I decided to sell
the station.</p>

<p>Our neighbour on Braganall was an old friend of my father's,
and a man after his own heart. His two sons, unlike me, were
squatters to the backbone; so I wrote to him and put the place
under offer. Somewhat to my relief, my father or his astral
counterpart, did not object to this. He seemed to think that,
failing me, the sons of his old friend would do justice to
Braganall. Negotiations were, therefore, soon concluded, and
Manxton became the owner of the well-known DAV herd.</p>

<p>I had now some peace from the constant visitations of my
father, and about that time I fell deeply in love. Contrary to
proverbial wisdom, the course of our true love ran smoothly
throughout, and our wedding day was approaching when I received a
letter from young Manxton which somewhat unsettled me. We were
old friends from boyhood's time, therefore he addressed me
without any ceremony. "Look here, old fellow," his letter ran,
"when the old man bought this place I don't think he took
delivery of any ghosts; at least, they were not mentioned in the
agreement. I wish you could induce your ancestral spook to let me
manage the station my own way." Young Manxton had a blunt way of
putting it, but under the circumstances, I felt I could pardon
him.</p>

<p>I saw fresh trouble ahead, but could do nothing but write back
and treat his letter as a joke.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
IT wanted but a week to our wedding day, and Laura and I were
deep in confidential conversation one evening when the astral
figure of my father appeared. Laura gave a big jump and a little
shriek at his sudden appearance, then sat quiet, whilst my father
said:</p>

<p>"Jim, you must do something for me. I know you can't properly
interfere, but young Manxton is going to sell Silverside and go
in for breeding trotters."</p>

<p>At this moment Laura sprang up with a loud cry. "Jim! Jim!"
she half shrieked, "it's your father, I know him from the
likeness you showed me. Oh! oh! it's his ghost!"&mdash;and she
went off into a faint, and I caught her and put her on the sofa.
I looked reproachfully at the old man and he went out without
opening the door, which was contrary to his usual habit. Then
Laura's mother came in and wanted to know what the matter was and
who the stranger was she met in the hall. I said weakly I did not
know, but would go after him if she would look after Laura, for I
was anxious to get away before she came to.</p>

<p>I passed a restless night, and the next morning the post
brought me a letter of farewell from my sweetheart. She pointed
out clearly that there were but two conclusions to arrive at.
Either my father was not dead and had committed some criminal
action which necessitated his disappearance, or it was his ghost.
Now, in either case our marriage was an impossibility&mdash;she
could not marry a man whose father had served a term in gaol; nor
could she become the wife of one who had a ghostly progenitor
popping up at convenient and inconvenient times. To this there
was no answer, at least I had none to offer; and it was not until
I had worried my brains for hours that I saw a ray of hope
ahead.</p>

<p>I wrote to Laura and her mother saying that I would offer them
a satisfactory and ample explanation. Then I wrote to Manxton and
asked him to delay the sale of Silverside (one of the sires of
the Braganall stud) until he heard further from me. Then I sat
and waited.</p>

<p>I was not disappointed; my father, looking very penitent, made
his appearance. "I'm awfully sorry, Jim, but I was so upset when
I found out that Manxton was going to sell Silverside that I came
in without thinking."</p>

<p>"It's been my own fault as well," I returned, for I could not
bear to see the old chap so miserable. "However, I think I have
found out a way to put things straight again. In the first place,
I am going to buy Braganall back."</p>

<p>My father shook his head; his business shrewdness was
evidently a portion of the astral counterpart of his physical
existence. "He'll make you pay through the nose when he finds you
want it. I know Manxton."</p>

<p>"But I think you can assist me to get it back at my own
figure," I returned, and showed him young Manxton's letter.</p>

<p>"Now, can't you make things so ghostly uncomfortable up there
that he'll be glad to almost give me the place back?"</p>

<p>My father became perfectly luminous with delight. "Bless you,
boy!" he said, and was about to vanish, when I recalled him.</p>

<p>"There's more to be done yet. I have to make it right with
Laura. I am going to manage Braganall myself, now that I am about
to be married, but, for all that, some little slips may occur
which might worry you and delay you on your passage
to&mdash;where is it?"</p>

<p>"Devachan," said my father.</p>

<p>"Devachan, yes. Do you think you could materialise a letter
when you have anything to say? I shall probably keep a room
somewhere in Sydney where you could write."</p>

<p>"Certainly I could. Why did I not think of it before?"</p>

<p>"Now, will you be here to-morrow at eleven o'clock, and,
before Laura and her mother, give me your word that you will in
future confine yourself to letter-writing when anything goes
wrong. You see it's this way, Dad. I enjoy seeing you immensely,
but the women, you know, are prejudiced."</p>

<p>"I quite understand it," replied the shade, and departed.</p>

<p>I called on Mrs. Lyntott, Laura's mother, who is a remarkably
strong-minded woman, and laid the whole case before her. She
reconciled me to Laura, and they agreed to meet my father at my
rooms in the morning.</p>

<p>The inconsistency of womankind! Before that meeting concluded
they had taken such a liking to that astral being that they both
regretted deeply the compact that had been entered into. "I
should have been very glad to see you occasionally, Mr. Danvers,"
said my prospective mother-in-law, and Laura uttered a like wish.
However, the thing was done. A ghost must keep its word, once
passed; and we parted with mutual feelings of regret.</p>

<p>Before leaving, my father whispered to me: "I gave young
Manxton such a night of it last night I expect you'll hear from
him to-day."</p>

<p>It is now many years since this happened, and as I have never
received a materialised letter, I presume that earthly matters
have ceased to trouble the good old gentleman, and my management
of Braganall has been satisfactory. His conscious unit has, I
hope, passed from Kama Loka to the higher spiritual plane of
Devachan.</p>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 23 Apr 1892</h3>

<p class="first">
"WHAT'S the matter with you; why the deuce can't you
sleep?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Alf; "got a touch of insomnia
to-night. If I do go to sleep I have the most awful dreams all
about men I used to know, men who are dead now."</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake don't start such talk at this time of
night. Sit by the fire and smoke your pipe quietly," I answered,
wearily, as I turned my back to the blaze and drew my blanket
around me.</p>

<p>"Right you are, old man," he replied, good-naturedly, and I
dropped off into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>I awoke with a start. The fire was out, or nearly so, and the
camp was silent. Just above the horizon the spectral last quarter
of the moon was hanging, throwing ghostly, dim, long shadows
around. It was the hour before dawn, the uncanny hour when all
the vital forces are at the lowest ebb. Some great general is
reported to have said, that the only courage worth a hang was
three o'clock in the morning courage. Whether anyone ever did
make the remark or not, there is a deal of truth in it.</p>

<p>I roused myself a little and looked around. Alf was sleeping
on the other side of the fire, and where he had set his bed down
was now in deep shadow, and I could make nothing out. I tried to
go to sleep again, but it was useless. Perhaps a smoke might send
me off; so, seeing a spark still smouldering, I arose, and
blowing the end of a still glowing firestick into a blaze, I lit
my pipe, and then, holding the lighted stick up, looked over to
where my companion should have been sleeping.</p>

<p>His blankets were tenantless.</p>

<p>May I never experience again such an uncomfortable thrill as
went through me when I made this discovery! I put my hand on the
blankets where they had been thrown aside. They were cold and the
dew had gathered on them; he must have been gone some hours. I
listened long and intently, but the night was silent. For a man
to wander away from camp in the middle of the night, out in the
Never-Never spinifex country, and remain away for hours, is a
most uncanny thing. If he had heard the horses making off he
would have called me ere leaving; if&mdash;but I exhausted all
conjectures before daylight dawned. I could do nothing until
then.</p>

<p>The light came very slowly, or so it appeared to me. We were
camped at the foot of a spinifex rise, on a narrow flat bordering
a creek. When the light was strong I could see the horses feeding
quietly some short distance away, and picking up my bridle I soon
had one caught and saddled, and firing off my rifle two or three
times without eliciting an answering shot, I started to look for
my missing mate. After some trouble I picked up his track leading
straight up the ridge, which, near the crest, was sandy, and the
prints of his footsteps were clearly defined. The spinifex was
scantier here, and as I gazed intently down I saw something that
made me pull up and hastily dismount to scan the tracks closer.
Alf, was not alone, somebody was walking ahead of him.</p>

<p>Step by step I followed leading my horse, but I could make
nothing of the foremost track, for Alf's almost covered it every
time. At last they diverged, and the two ran side by side. It was
a bright morning, the sun just glinting under the stunted trees;
what little live nature there was in that lonely spot was awake
and joyously greeting the day; but I rose up from my examination
of that awful foot-mark with the dew of superstitious terror on
my forehead. No living man had made that track.</p>

<p>I had to follow on scarce knowing what to think or expect. I
tried to persuade myself that the foot-print was that of some
attenuated old gin, lean and shrunken as a mummy, but that was
against reason. The track was that of the skeleton of a man; and
Alf was not following it, but following whatever was making
it.</p>

<p>With varying fortune, now finding, now losing the trail I kept
on for about two hours; then, halfway down a slight incline, I
came upon the object of my search. He was sitting on the ground
talking to himself, I thought at first, but when I got closer I
saw he was addressing some object on his lap. He was nursing the
head and shoulders of the remains of a human being. He lay at
full length amidst a patch of rank green grass fertilised by the
decayed body, a skeleton with fragments of rotten clothing still
clinging to it. Alf had his arm under the skull as one would
support a sick man, and was murmuring words of affection. He
raised his head as I approached but evinced no surprise.</p>

<p>"This is my brother Jack;" he said. "Fancy his coming to the
camp last night to show me where he was. We must take him into
the nearest station and bury him, for he can't rest here, it's
too lonely."</p>

<p>I could not answer. Alf's mind had evidently given way and I
could not reason with him. He carried the body back to our camp
and I commenced a ghastly ride to the nearest station over
seventy miles away, with a madman and a corpse for companions.
The third day after starting we arrived at Ulmalong, then the
outside station, and here I learnt the story of Alf's twin
brother.</p>

<p>He had been a stockman on the place when it was first settled,
and had ridden out on his rounds one day and never returned.
There was little doubt that the skeleton we brought in was his,
but what led the living twin to its resting place? I held my
tongue about the track for they would only think I was as mad as
poor Alf.</p>

<p>After we buried the remains Alf relapsed into almost constant
silence. He was quite harmless and they found him some light work
to do about the place, but he died, prematurely aged, in about a
year's time. He was buried with his brother.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>20. -- A GEOLOGICAL NIGHTMARE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 8 May 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
'I WONDER what they mean by the yarn?' said Brereton, as he
slowly cut a pipeful of tobacco. 'I can't make out at all, for
they describe things that they cannot possibly have seen,'
returned his companion.</p>

<p>The two were discussing a curious statement they had pieced
out from the natives of a strange country to the southward, where
there was always water and green trees; but none of the blacks
dared venture in, so fearful were the huge animals that Inhabited
it.</p>

<p>The two men were on an outside station in the far north-west
of Australia. Below them, to the southward, was the tract of sand
hill country that as yet had been little traversed, and was the
only area of land left in Australia that might hide any possible
secrets. This floating rumor had come to them often, but it was
only by time and patience they had succeeded in getting crude
details. Both men were accustomed to natives, and knew all about
their mendacity; but in this case the blacks from all parts
agreed so exactly in their descriptions that they both began to
think there was something in it. None of the natives round about
had been there. The tale had come from the wild Myalls of the
desert, and all allowance had to be made for it coming from such
a source.</p>

<p>Still, they had described beasts that had the appearance of
elephants, of which they could never have heard; flying animals
that seemed like the visions of a nightmare, or something quite
beyond the imagination of a native to construct. The idea that
there was something of truth underlying these statements had
taken firm hold of both men, and as camels were available in the
district, they determined to make a trip in search of this
strange place. They took natives on with them from one tribe to
another, until at last they reached the tribe who were said to be
acquainted with this mysterious land.</p>

<p>The party consisted of Brereton and Soames, with a white man
named Gordon and a black boy. Having effected an amicable
understanding with the tribe, and through the black who had
accompanied them managed to explain what they desired, they were
met with looks of fright and denial. Evidently the blacks had no
love for the place. At last the offer of tomahawks had the
desired effect, and an old man volunteered to undertake the
task.</p>

<p>In the morning they started, and their guide led them on until
they reached a broad flat covered with a sort of sage-brush, and
bordered on each side by spinifex-covered sand hills. Down this
he turned, and when they had proceeded some distance he made
signs to them to follow the flat down and they would reach the
place, and he would go back. When they tried to induce him to
accompany them he took them over to a dried clay-pan in the
centre of the flat, and pointed to some tracks in it, made when
the mud was soft.</p>

<p>'I should say it was a crocodile tracks,' said Soames; 'if it
was not impossible that one could be out here.'</p>

<p>'A crocodile four times as big as any on the coast of
Australia, then,' replied Brereton. In truth, it was a most
formidable track, and they excused the native from proceeding
further, and gave him the promised tomahawks, and he departed, a
millionaire.</p>

<p>Following the flat down, they came to another clay-pan,
through which at some recent time the monster had also
floundered. Not far from this was a hole with fresh water in it,
and as the day was getting spent, and there was feed for their
camels, they determined to halt for the night, taking the
precaution to fix their camp half-way up the sand-ridge.</p>

<p>It was a calm, still night, and they were all lying down
resting, when suddenly a noise like the roar of the siren of an
ocean steamer arose in the distance. They all sprang up and
listened until it died down to silence. It was not a cheerful
sound to hear, particularly as it came from the direction in
which they intended proceeding.</p>

<p>'It seems to me,' said Brereton, 'that that old nigger had got
any amount' of sense.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Soames; 'that noise was not made by a
mosquito.'</p>

<p>They remained listening, but although they thought that they
heard other confused roars and howls, they did not hear the one
that had aroused them until later on in the night.</p>

<p>In the morning they started early, and followed the flat,
which ran a straight course, and was evidently descending in
altitude. The morning was exceptionally hot, and the air, strange
to say, had a damp, oppressive feeling, as though they were
riding through steam.</p>

<p>Suddenly they emerged on a broad, open plain, and the sand
hills on either side died down to the level of the plain. Before
them lay a huge hollow, enveloped in mist. From out of this
strange mist sounds were heard, as of the noise of animals, but
the cloud was a long distance below them, and they could hear but
indistinctly.</p>

<p>As they, halted and watched the heat of the sun began to
dispel the mist. It floated upward in fleecy clouds, which
changed and melted in all the colors of the rainbow. A wonderful
scene was disclosed.</p>

<p>They were looking over a vast jungle lying at the bottom of an
enormous circular hollow. This dense forest seemed composed of
gigantic trees, unlike any common to Australia. They could see
other flats like the one they had followed stretching out from
the forest as from the centre of a star. This singular place lay
below them so far that over the dense cluster of tree-tops they
could see an island of clear ground in the middle of it, but they
were too far away to distinguish anything plainly.</p>

<p>'I suppose that's where, the gentleman lives who was trying
his voice last night,' said Brereton.</p>

<p>'And his friend who made those delicate tracks,' added
Soames.</p>

<p>They proceeded slowly down the incline, finding the ground
coated with a short, green turf. The air was more dense and
oppressive than ever, and when nearing the forest the ground
became too boggy for their camels to progress any further. They
could now see that this abnormal growth sprang from a morass and
through the rank vegetation giant beasts of a bygone age crushed
their way, fought and browsed.</p>

<p>'We've found a bit of primeval Australia, with a vengeance, it
strikes me,'. said Soames, after they had watched the spectacle
for some time. 'We've got back to the Pliocene age, I think.
Here, Soames, you see that joker tearing down that
bough&mdash;isn't that a <i>diprotodon</i>? You're a bit of a
geologist.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I suppose that's what the niggers described, and we took
for an elephant.</p>

<p>As he spoke there was a noise overhead, and looking aloft the
men saw to their consternation a ferocious being, with huge
bat-like wings and long, snake-like neck, hovering over them as
though about to make a swoop on the party. On the impulse of the
moment Brereton raised his rifle, and fired at it. The creature
smarted, then with a blood-curdling scream flew back to the
forest with one leg trailing and broken.</p>

<p>They saw it try to alight on one of the lofty tree tops, fail,
and fall straggling down. Immediately there was a rash of beasts
from all sides, and with howls and roars the thing was torn, in
tatters.</p>

<p>'I vote we make back for a bit, and decide what's best to be
done,' said Brereton, as he reloaded his rifle.</p>

<p>Acting on the advice, they retreated up the incline to the
termination of the island ridge, intending to proceed with great
caution. They fixed a camp, and discussed the best method of
conducting, the campaign; it was evident that the first, thing
was to circumnavigate the morass, or the 'Pliocene survival,' as
Soames had christened it, and find out if it was the same on all
sides. This they carried into execution, they started in the
afternoon, but had not got half-way round by dark.</p>

<p>However, there was abundance of water in all the flats that
ran in, like the spokes of a wheel, and there was, no difficulty
in finding a good camp. In fact, the whole of the incline to the
morass seemed charged with water, increasing as the level got
lower.</p>

<p>'Can you explain this thing at all?' asked Brereton of his
companion, as they were lying on their blankets smoking.</p>

<p>'Only by supposing that we are a long way below the level of
the sea, and there is a vast drainage of subterranean water into
this hollow. This and the moist heat created by the sun in this
enclosed space has caused that growth of forest, and the survival
of these old-time creatures.'</p>

<p>'Think there are any inhabitants on that island?'</p>

<p>'No; these things lived long before men appeared, unless
Australia was peopled before the rest of the world, which it
probably was, from there being so much cussedness about its
formation and its productions.</p>

<p>Next morning they proceeded on their round, and presently came
to where the uniformity of the country was broken by a rocky
range of no great elevation. This ran out in a point towards the
swamp. They could not see the end of it, but it appeared to stop
abruptly, and not penetrate the actual morass. They left the
camels with the black boy to mind them, and the three whites went
on foot over the boulder-strewn ridge to the end of it. It was a
long and toilsome tramp, and what with the heat of the sun and
the steamy atmosphere, they were glad when they came to the
termination.</p>

<p>It ended abruptly in a precipitous descent that partly
encroached beyond the edge of the swamp. From this elevation they
were able to obtain a good view of the strange world beneath
them.</p>

<p>But another object claimed their attention: The crest of the
ridge on which they stood was continued by a flying bridge rudely
but strongly constructed, and depending for support on the huge
trees whose tops towered above the ridge. The bridge, or
causeway, apparently, led to the island, and must have been a
work of tremendous labor and time. It was constructed of solid
beams, and went from tree to tree, and either the time it had
been built was so long or the growth in that region was so quick;
that the forks of the trees in which the ends of the beams were
placed had overgrown the latter.</p>

<p>This aerial causeway was slippery from the moist atmosphere;
but on its slimy surface were no fresh tracks, as though the
builders of it had ceased from using this connection between the
island and the mainland. No view of the island could be obtained,
as the bridge wound about in a zig-zag fashion.</p>

<p>'They weren't afraid of a job, whoever built this,' said
Brereton.</p>

<p>Soames had taken a tomahawk, and was chipping at one of the
logs.</p>

<p>'They're petrified,' he said. 'God knows when this was
built.'</p>

<p>'Shall we go across?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but let us take it easy. In the first place these logs
are mighty slippery, and I don't want to tumble down there for
one.'</p>

<p>'What shall we do?'</p>

<p>'Go back, fix the camp up in as safe a place as we can find,
and come prepared in the morning with our pack ropes. Meanwhile,
we'll finish the circuit this afternoon.'</p>

<p>They were lucky in finding an overhanging shelving rock which
would serve admirably to protect their packs, and be a shelter
from any attacks by the winged creatures, of which they all had a
great dread. They followed the morass round to where they had
first struck it, but found nothing out of the usual run.</p>

<p>They scarcely slept that night in anticipation of what they
might meet with on the island, and early morning found them at
the point of the rocky promontory laden with all the things that
they thought would aid them in the passage. It was a most
difficult and dangerous crossing, for the growth, of the trees
had made the footway uneven, and without the ropes they would
never have passed over in safety.</p>

<p>In the middle they stopped and gazed at the strange animals in
the depth below them. Giants they most of them were. Soames
recognised the <i>nototherium</i>, the gigantic wombat as large
as a bear; the <i>thylacoleo</i>, a huge and ferocious beast;
beside the <i>diprodoton</i>, and many others of whom he took
rough sketches for after identification. They saw some of the
terrible flying horrors with turtle backs and darting necks, but
they did not attempt to molest them. Enormous alligators, too,
crawled over the slime and reeds, and a constant snarl and roar
arose from the fights that were continually going on. At last
they turned the bend that brought them in sight of the island,
and gazing eagerly forward caught sight of some tall moving
objects.</p>

<p>'Men!' they exclaimed, but, on looking steadily at them, they
saw they were gigantic kangaroos.</p>

<p>The causeway led them straight on to where an ancient road met
it, and by the nature of the rocks they saw it was an elevation
of the ridge they had left. Before them was a structure of solid
stone, evidently one of the habitations or the builders of the
causeway. But no sign of life was visible.</p>

<p>The building was of one lofty ground floor, massively put
together of unhewn stone. The door was of great height, and was
placed at an elevation of eight or ten feet above the ground; and
they were not long in finding out the reason. A group of large
grey objects were seen in pursuit of one of the giant kangaroos,
the <i>thrylacini</i>, the ancestors of the wolves.</p>

<p>Their quarry turned and stood at bay after the manner of one
of his degenerate descendants worried by dingoes, but he was
pulled down by numbers&mdash;fighting fiercely to the last.</p>

<p>'It strikes me that they made their doors so high to prevent a
night visit from these gentlemen,' said Brereton. 'Well, as there
seems no one at home, shall we go in?' he continued.</p>

<p>His companions agreed, and by means of some steps cut in the
wall they ascended and entered the building. The room they found
themselves in was well-lighted; and in one corner was a stone
couch, on which lay the ossified remains of a human being. They
approached it silently. It was a man of more than heroic stature;
well-proportioned, and with a goodly shaped head. He bore no
resemblance to the present aborigines, and had evidently died
quietly in his bed, and been preserved by the ossifying nature of
the atmosphere; though, naturally, shrunk and withered, in life
he would have been a giant such as are not known now.</p>

<p>While still gazing at this noble looking object, they heard
without a snuffing and whimpering. Looking over the door sill
they saw below the lolling tongues, glistening teeth, and fiery
eyes of the <i>thrylacini</i> pack, who had scented them out.</p>

<p>'We'll make short work of you,' said Brereton. 'Take good
aim.'</p>

<p>They had an ample supply of cartridges, and, firing leisurely
from their vantage point, they never wasted a shot. As they
dropped one by one the others fell upon and devoured them. At
last there were only a few survivors left, who loped off in,
disgust. The men examined the hut, and found a monstrous bow,
with stone-headed arrows, a club, stone knife, and axe; all fit
for a giant race to wield.</p>

<p>Other buildings were in sight, and they were about to descend
and examine them when Brereton pulled Soames back. Snuffing about
among the remains of the dead <i>thrylacini</i> were two
hyena-looking animals, the <i>sarcophilis</i>, who still exist as
the Tasmanian devil. Two shots made them bite the dust; then the
party descended, and made their way to the next habitation.</p>

<p>In it they found the remains of a man and a woman, to all
appearance younger than the one they had seen first. The woman
lay on the couch, the Than was half way to the door, and his body
rested on one knee, and the point of his outstretched hand. So
lifelike was the posture that the men started when they saw it.
These two were of giant stature, and in all the houses they
visited they found the same grim memorials of the past. Old and
young, babies, children and youths and girls. Some, poisonous
exhalation from the surrounding swamp had smitten them all down
one fatal night; that was the only explanation they could think
of.</p>

<p>'But why did it not kill off the animals as well?' asked
Brereton when Soames propounded the theory. The other shrugged
his shoulders; something deadly had evidently struck down these
inhabitants of the marsh girt isle at one and the same time; but
why it bad not served all the animal creation alike they could
not conjecture.</p>

<p><br>
IT was growing late before they had finished their
examination, and they hastily made for the causeway, remembering
the perilous crossing that lay before them.</p>

<p>On their way back they saw the <i>dromornis</i>, the gigantic
emu of Pliocene Australia. When in the middle of the aerial
causeway a well nigh fatal accident happened; one portion was
particularly uneven, from some trees having grown and others
subsided. On ascending one of these divisions with a dangerous
slope, Brereton, who came last, felt the logs slip, and begin to
slide. He sprang forward, and was seized by his two companions
just in time. The logs of the division he had just quitted fell
headlong into the morass beneath, crushing two or three of the
beasts beneath with their ponderous weight. A gulf yawned between
them and the island, cutting off their return until they could
find some means of replacing it.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it's just as well,' said Soames, when discussing the
incident in camp. 'We are not prepared for a lengthened
examination, and above all we must get a camera. We will go
straight home, and come back fully equipped for everything. The
place won't run away after all these thousands of years; and if
anyone comes here during our absence that gap will block them
from going on to the island.'</p>

<p><br>
FULL of their discovery they went back, but the rains
descended in a fashion never before seen by white men in
Northwest Australia. A wet season of unparalleled rainfall
delayed their return for months, and when at last they arrived at
the mouth of the flat they had first followed down, the two
looked at each other in incredulous amazement.</p>

<p>The Pliocene survival, the mammoth forest, the island, the
monstrous animals, and the village of the dead giants had
disappeared, and over all rolled the muddy waters of a lake,
rapidly turning into one of the saline bogs common to that
region. All had vanished beneath same convulsion of Nature that
had buried everything in a muddy deluge. At their feet lay a
skeleton, the remains of one of the hideous winged creatures
which had escaped the inundation only to die of starvation.</p>

<p>'Jolly lucky we kept so quiet about it,' remarked Brereton,
'else what gorgeous liars they would all swear we were.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>21. -- JERRY BOAKE'S CONFESSION</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 8 Mar 1890</h3>

<p class="first">
PERHAPS one of the most popular fellows on the then
newly-opened H&mdash;&mdash;Goldfield, in Far North Queensland,
was Jack Walters. Everybody knew him, and everybody liked him,
and there was great chaff and much popping of corks 'ere he
started down to C&mdash;&mdash; with the avowed intention of
getting married. Walters had shares in one or two good mines, and
had a tidy sum of money with him when he left the field amidst
the congratulations of 'the boys' on his approaching nuptials.
Jack was a friend of mine; when he was temporarily crippled by a
blasting accident I used to write his love-letters for him.</p>

<p>Three days after he left, Inspector Frost and his black
troopers, who all knew Walters, rode into the township.
Naturally, the first question asked was, had they met Jack, and
how far he'd got on the road?</p>

<p>"Never saw or heard of him," was the unexpected reply,
"perhaps he was off the road."</p>

<p>"No, he said he was going down easy and expected to meet
you."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said the inspector, "I'm going back to-morrow, and I'll
keep a sharp look-out for him."</p>

<p>Fifty miles from H&mdash;&mdash;was a creek with permanent
water and a good feed, a favourite camping-place. Frost, who had
told the troopers to watch for signs of Jack, had almost
forgotten the matter, to which, after all, he did not attach much
importance, when a shrill whistle from one of his boys a short
distance off the road to the right attracted his attention. The
boy had dismounted, and was standing gazing at something on the
ground. Frost rode up, and had almost anticipated what it was
before he reached the spot. Screened by a few bushes from any
chance traveller lay the body of a dead man&mdash;Jack Walters.
His head was pillowed on his riding-saddle, his blanket was
thrown over the lower part of his body, and his pack-saddle and
bags were close by, where they had evidently been put overnight.
He had been shot through the temple, and in his hand he still
held a revolver. To all appearances it was one of those
motiveless cases of suicide that now and again puzzle
everybody.</p>

<p>A careful examination was made, but nothing seemed to have
been disturbed; no money save some loose silver was found. Frost
collected all the camp paraphernalia, took careful notes of the
position of the body and all the surroundings; then, leaving one
trooper to guard the remains, despatched a boy back to
H&mdash;&mdash;with the news, and instruction to the police there
to come out and take the body&mdash;he himself had to proceed on
his journey. Casting one more glance around, he noticed a
newspaper lying some distance away. Such things were commonly
found on old camping grounds, but he walked over and picked it
up. It was the H&mdash;&mdash; <i>Express</i>, the journal of the
mining township he had left. He looked at it idly for some time,
thinking more of the sight he had just witnessed than of the
paper in his hand, when he instinctively noticed the date, which
suggested a train of thought. Walters had left the field three
days before Frost's arrival there. The Inspector remembered that
fact well, because there had been some debate as to the spot
where they should have passed each other. Three days would make
it Monday, and this paper was issued on Tuesday. How had it come
into the dead man's camp?</p>

<p>Frost went back and looked at the corpse before the troopers
had covered it up with boughs. The revolver taken from the
stiffened fingers, he remembered, was but loosely held&mdash;it
was not in the iron grasp of a dead man's hand, clutched hard at
the moment of death. No doubt remained that the case was not one
of suicide, but cowardly, cold-blooded murder. Somebody had left
the diggings the next morning, had ridden hard and overtaken
Walters at the creek, had shared the hospitality of his camp, and
had shot him for the sake of the money he had with him. Where was
the murderer now?</p>

<p>Frost, who had gold to take down to the port, did not tarry
long between the scene of the murder and C&mdash;&mdash;. The
second day saw him closeted with the police magistrate, who had
just received a telegram from H&mdash;&mdash;, informing him of
the arrival of the native police with the news of Frost's
discovery. Hardly had Frost told his tale before another telegram
arrived&mdash;"Jerry Boake left here after Walters. See if he is
in C&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Jerry was a pretty notorious character, and, strange to say,
Walters was one of the few men who had befriended him when
everybody else had thrown him over.</p>

<p>A very short inquiry elicited the fact that Jerry was in town;
also that Jerry was in funds, and had given the barmaid at the
'Rise and Shine' a gold watch and chain. Interviewed, the barmaid
produced the gold watch and chain, which were at once recognised
as the property of Walters, who had bought them as a present for
his fiance. Jerry was straight-way arrested; and, absurd as the
statement may seem, was actually wearing a ring well-known to
belong to Walters. He denied his guilt stoutly, stated that
Walters had given him the ring and the watch and chain to bring
down, and that when he was drunk he gave it to the barmaid. Jerry
was remanded to H&mdash;&mdash;, and Frost himself started up in
charge of him.</p>

<p>The dusk was setting in when they reached the bank of the
creek where the dead body had been found. The party from
H&mdash;&mdash;had been there and removed it. Frost pulled up,
and looked round. The prisoner, manacled to a trooper, was close
to him.</p>

<p>"You're not going to camp here, are you?" stammered Jerry
Boake, with pallid lips.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Frost, sternly, "you know nothing about this
place, do you?" And without another word he rode straight to the
scene of the murder, and got off his horse.</p>

<p>"Turn out," he said briefly.</p>

<p>The troopers dismounted, and began unpacking and unsaddling.
Frost undid the handcuff from the trooper's wrist, and refastened
it on the prisoner's.</p>

<p>There is only one way in the bush of securing a criminal
charged with such a crime as Jerry's, and who would stick at
nothing to escape. A light trace-chain is used, and the prisoner
tethered securely to a tree. Without a word, Frost, chain in
hand, walked to the tree beneath which the body had been found,
and beckoned to the troopers to bring the prisoner. Jerry
approached; he had summoned up all his hardihood, and called up a
look of defiance on his face, but he couldn't control the
trembling of his now pallid lips. Frost secured him, and the
black trooper brought him his blankets, and sat down a short
distance off to watch him.</p>

<p>Darkness closed in, the camp fires blazed up, food and tea
were given to the prisoner, and with an air of bravado he
pretended to eat; but though the food passed his lips not a bite
could he swallow. The tea he drank greedily, and asked for more.
The day's journey had been a long one, and the tired men soon
dropped off to sleep one after another&mdash;but for one man
there was no sleep that night. For all that the camp was so
quiet, he had an idea that he was being watched, and it gave him
a miserable kind of moral support to think that there was someone
else awake as well as himself. It would be an awful thing to be
the only waking man in that camp.</p>

<p>He had got to the full length of the trace-chain, and must
have lost consciousness for a few moments, for, while his heart
beat until it nearly choked him, he saw a black shadow under the
tree&mdash;a dark shadow that was not there before. With an
effort he stilled his trembling nerves, and forced himself to
gaze at the object. Pah! The moon had risen higher and changed
the position of the shadows, that was all. But supposing a man
with a bloody smear on his forehead and half-closed dull eyes
were really to come and lie down on that spot, while he himself
was chained there not able to get away, what an awful thing it
would be!</p>

<p>Would morning never come? He thought. Why must he think,
think, think, and all about the one thing; his own incredible
folly? A few pounds in gold, a few days of drunken 'shouting,'
and now&mdash;it must be a nightmare, surely&mdash;he could not
have been led away to do such a madly insane deed. He disliked
the man mostly because he owed him many kindnesses, but that was
not why he killed him for. No, it was for the few miserable
pounds he was carrying.</p>

<p>That horrible black shadow seemed to stop there, although the
moon's position had changed. Why did it stop there? Perhaps there
was a stain of blood on the ground; he would force himself to go
over and see. No, he couldn't do that, he would stop where he was
and try to think of other things; but he couldn't. Always the
same thought, the same hideous picture&mdash;a man asleep with
his head on a saddle, and another standing over him with a
levelled pistol. And then&mdash;well, then, a sight that would
never leave him; the moon was young and sickly then, but its
light was strong enough to show the dead body of the murdered
man, with the bloody smear on his face. Would morning never come?
Presently the moon would set, and then the darkness would be
horrible. Who knows what hideous thing might not creep on him
unawares. The air seemed thick with an awful corpse-like smell;
had they buried the body there, where it was found? But this
thought was too maddening&mdash;he would go frantic if he
entertained it. Why did not the bleak shadow shift; the moon was
getting low now?</p>

<p><br>
JUST before daylight Frost was awakened by one of the boys at
the door of his tent. "Marmee, that fellow Jerry sing out along
of you!" Frost got up and went over to the place. The moon had
set, and the night was dark; he told the boys to make the
fire.</p>

<p>"My God! Mr. Frost," said a piteous voice, "take me away from
here, and I'll tell you everything." Frost undid the chain, and
led him to the fire. He afterwards said that the look on the
wretch's face haunted him for months. Jerry Boake made a full
confession&mdash;and was hanged a few weeks afterwards.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>22. -- A DESERT MYSTERY</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney, 27 Mar 1907</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
"WHEN things are at their worst, they are bound to mend."</p>

<p>"Very trite and rather ambiguous; but the question is, when
are things at their worst?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose the present is about as bad as things could
be, until the last smash comes. Camels done up; water nearly
finished; and the abomination of desolation all around."</p>

<p>"Sounds as if we had touched bottom, and could hot get any
further, so it is about time for the mending to come in."</p>

<p>The speakers were sitting under the alleged shade of a
miserable tree, in an outlying arm of the great sandy desert of
North-West Australia. An extremely typical arm, that extended
towards the straggling gold camps of the De Grey district. Around
them the country was covered with the cheerful spinifex, and in
the immediate foreground was the dry, shimmering surface of a
salt lake, whose deceptive presence had lured the two prospectors
on to follow the straggling indications of a dead little
watercourse, to its end; in this blank disappointment.</p>

<p>"Well, what shall we do? Turn back or go on, and chance
dropping across a well?"</p>

<p>"The camels are too played out to get back; no water, and not
a bite of food since we started; they can't stand it any longer,
I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"All right, the sun's getting lower; so wake up, Master
Curley, and let's make a start. Hanged if a black boy wouldn't
sleep on the edge of the Pit."</p>

<p>The blackfellow having been aroused, and the camels repacked,
and got into line, the two prepared to make, what they thought,
promised to be, their last start. Before mounting, they both cast
the usual lingering glance around, and almost at the same moment
their attention was attracted by an approaching sound. In the
desert, where a dead silence reigns as a rule, tho least noise
immediately draws attention to itself.</p>

<p>Both men turned, and were startled to see a
dilapidated-looking aboriginal stagger towards them. He was in
the last stage of collapse, and had seemingly fallen, and been
lying amongst the spinifex, until their coming had aroused him to
such life as he had left. He was too far gone to feel terror
either at sight of them or their camels; but limped towards them,
dragging a piece of chain fastened to one ankle. His dry lips
could only utter the one feeble cry of "Nappa," the one magic
word of that region, the cry for water.</p>

<p>The whites looked at each other, and then one of them
disengaged the sadly-attenuated water-bag, and gave the famishing
wretch a little. Curley approached to speak to the wanderer, and
one man said to the other:</p>

<p>"This looks like the worst, when this fellow, who knows the
run of the place, gets so used up, what chance do we stand?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he knew of some soak that he was making for, and
broke down on the way; he a evidently given some white man leg
bail. Well, Curley, you yabba that felleh."</p>

<p>"No," replied the half-civilised boy, with great disdain. "He
only common blackfelleh, inna way, mine tink it."</p>

<p>The poor, despised, native-born son of the soil looked
appealingly at his fellow-countryman, with his sun-blinded eyes,
pointed a shaking finger at his lips, and motioned to the
water-bag.</p>

<p>After some hesitation they gave him a little drop of their
scanty store, and then waited for his further recovery.</p>

<p>"I don't think we shall get anything out of him, after all,"
said one; "he's either got away from the police, or a white
party, who had him chained up to lead them to water."</p>

<p>"We must not give him any more water, or we shall get nothing
out of him; he'll only go to any water he knows of to save his
own hide."</p>

<p>"I don't know how he got loose, for the chain's quite free. He
must have been fastened to the tree by a rank new chum. It's
secured with a split link round his ankle; but the fool must have
tied him up with a piece of rope, and expected a nigger to stop
like that."</p>

<p>They waited with admirable patience until their guest had
recovered somewhat, and then broached the delicate subject of
finding a further supply of water; and, after vainly trying to
got another drink from them, the blackfellow saw that it was
useless, and went ahead, securely tethered, however; for darkness
was closing round, and things had grown too critical to wait and
lose time. The dry salt lake, however, was evidently a known
landmark of the native's, and urged on by his own devouring
thirst, he was not long before he led them to a native well,
which they soon emptied in assuaging the thirst of their camels.
Seemingly this was the place he was making for when his strength
gave way, and exhaustion overcame him.</p>

<p>It was nearly daylight when they had finished watering the
camels, and then they laid themselves down for a much deserved
sleep. In the morning, when the burning sun and sand awakened
them from their slumber of exhaustion, their late guest had, of
course, disappeared without the courtesy of leaving a P.P.C.
card.</p>

<p>"He served our turn, and worked the mending business very
well, at any rate," said one.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'd have given him a feed if he had stopped," replied
his mate.</p>

<p>Far away over the regular and monotonous sand ridges the
limping myall was speeding as fast as he could, eager only to put
many a desert mile between himself and his late experience,
which, even to his savage mind, was one of exceptional
horror.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE well, which proved their salvation, would hardly have been
discovered without a guide, for it was one of those strange
little soakages that occur at rare intervals in the sandy
Northwest, and have no indications to betray them to the white
wanderer, and yet have an ample supply of water, their
whereabouts being jealously guarded by the natives. Under
ordinary circumstances the runaway would never have guided them;
but the circumstances were not of an ordinary kind, as the two
prospectors were fated to find out.</p>

<p>There was some rough feed for their hungry camels, and they
stopped several days and recruited both themselves and the
beasts. Satisfied that there was no country worth prospecting,
they determined to make a push for home.</p>

<p>It was the fourth day of a dry stage, and they were wearily
plodding on, when the blackfellow suddenly exclaimed that he saw
a horse track.</p>

<p>They all examined it, but in the sand it was impossible to
make sure of its identity; but another indication put the matter
beyond doubt. Still, they were approaching the confines of the
waterless country, and it was quite possible that men with horses
only could venture so far. While still talking of the incident,
the leading camel suddenly came, without any sign or warning, on
an old deserted camp.</p>

<p>A camp wherein the saddles and gear had been tossed and
tumbled and dragged about, and chewed and bitten by the lurking
dingoes or the natives; a camp which the horses had left and
sought for kinder quarters, a camp without water, a camp of
death.</p>

<p>Two dead bodies lay in the camp, and when the startled men got
off their camels and turned over the mummified remains, the
faces, though burnt and dried up by the fierce sun, wore still
recognisable&mdash;a middle-aged man and a young man, the last
apparently little more than a smooth-faced boy. And the boy had a
pistol in his hand, and in his face a hideous mark where a
revolver-bullet had smashed in and let his life out.</p>

<p>Both men were old bushmen, and went about the work of
examination carefully and methodically. The elder man proved to
have been likewise shot through the body, but there was no
writing or any journal or diary left to afford a clue to the
tragedy.</p>

<p>The belongings and camp dunnage had been so mauled about by
dogs that nothing connected was left to tell how long the men had
boon camped there. The men and blackboy searched long and
earnestly and the only inexplicable thing was noticed by the boy.
The trunk of a small gnarled tree was chafed and rubbed smooth,
the bark worn, and the limbs torn down and broken. The sand, too,
was ploughed around in deep furrows, as though two men had been
furiously wrestling, or one man had had a series of fits just
there. They gazed curiously at these indications, and then the
black oracle spoke.</p>

<p>"That feller runaway; he bin tied here, alonga tree."</p>

<p>The proofs were plain; the men had chained the unfortunate
black up, to prevent his absconding during the night, and death
had come while the captive was still fast. But what killed the
men?</p>

<p>They were standing by the elder man's body, and pondering over
the riddle.</p>

<p>"Poor wretch! How he must have struggled for his life, chained
up here with two dead men, until he chafed the rope through! No
wonder he was close up done when he came across us."</p>

<p>"What's that? A piece of gold, close by your foot."</p>

<p>The other stooped, and picked up a sovereign.. Like a flash
the mystery was revealed to him, and he spoke.</p>

<p>"They were dying of thirst, and tied the nigger up in a last
hope that ho would lead them to water. In the morning their
horses were gone, and they funked on the slow death that was over
them, and took the easiest way. They tossed this sovereign up to
see who should be the executioner, and the boy lost. Then he lost
his nerve, when he had shot his mate, and shot himself quickly to
got the awful deed over, for he had murder on his soul. He never
thought, in his bewildered horror, of the nigger still tied up;
and round and round and round that tree, and up and down it, the
unhappy brute must have fought and struggled, for days,
perhaps."</p>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>23. -- FARRAR'S MISSION</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 5 Dec 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'SOME folks have peculiar notions concerning their last
resting place,' remarked Jim, as he handed me my matches
back.</p>

<p>'I once knew a man who made more fuss about his grave that was
to be than he did about the house he lived in. His name was
Farrar&mdash;Joseph Farrar&mdash;and he had a nice bit of
property of his own. Suddenly he took the idea into his head that
he was about to die shortly, and it would be most advisable to
see about getting his grave ready. He bought a plot of ground in
the local cemetery, had a very large grave dug, and proceeded to
lay it out in a most artistic manner, or in what he considered an
artistic manner. His main idea was to provide comfort in his
grave. He remarked to me: "You know you have to live in a house
only a comparatively short time, a few years in fact, whereas in
a grave you settle down to stay."</p>

<p>'I replied that there was this difference&mdash;that you could
appreciate the comfort of your house when alive, while you were
not in a position to judge of the comfort of your grave when you
were dead.'</p>

<p>'"I'm not so sure about that, Jim," he said. "It's mostly
carelessness on the part of the survivors. A poor devil when he's
dead and uncomfortable can't get up and have things put straight
for obvious reasons. Now, I am not going to trust to anybody, but
I'll just see to it myself."</p>

<p>'He started to work, and had his grave neatly bricked with
fancy bricks and the floor tiled. It really looked, quite nice
and cool, and he was so delighted that he used to spend some
hours there nearly every day, and once asked me down to admire
it. The parson and trustees of the cemetery remonstrated, but he
squared them, for he didn't mind expense; but when he took to
having a few friends down to partake of what he called "light
refreshments," consisting of whisky and tobacco, they objected
very strongly, but could do nothing. They overhauled all the
by-laws, but there was nothing amongst them to meet the case, and
if they passed a fresh one it would not affect Farrar because he
held his ground under their own old regulations.</p>

<p>'He decided to grow pumpkins and melons above his future long,
last home, and gradually made it quite a fashionable resort in
hot weather. Everybody was anxious to belong to the Reformed Tomb
Club, and the thing became a public scandal. The trustees
threatened to obtain an injunction to stop his using the grave
during his life time, until the law decided the point, but Farrar
euchred them again. There was a mortgage on the cemetery, as
there is on most cemeteries, and Farrar bought the mortgagee out,
and threatened to foreclose and shut the burying place up
altogether if they didn't desist, and they had to. But Farrar
acted square. He insisted on order and decency at his reunions;
no loud nor loose talk, and no boisterous laughter; everything
was well conducted. He explained that he had a great moral
purpose in view&mdash;he was educating the people up to the
beauty of comfortable graves, teaching them to disabuse their
minds of the popular horror of the tomb as a loathsome and
frightful place, to be shunned; whereas the charnel house could
be made into a flower garden of delight. He got quite puffed up
with the idea that he was a social reformer, and began to talk of
standing for the Assembly and advocating granting licences for
graveyards and making them popular places of resort.</p>

<p>'Now, as long as there were free whisky and tobacco to be got
in the grave, you may be sure that he had a strong party behind,
him, but the end came to what might have developed into a great
national question that would have beaten federation hollow.</p>

<p>'The end, of course, came in the shape of a woman. It's
generally a woman who stands in the path of progress. Her name
was Smiley&mdash;Sarah Smiley&mdash;and she had long fixed her
hard, blue eye upon Farrar. When it came to the money, which she
persuaded herself was to be rightfully hers, being, spent in
graves and free entertainments, she began to take active
measures.</p>

<p>'She professed great sympathy with Farrar's idea, said that it
took from her mind all terror of death, and, in fact, made her
rather anxious to expire. Farrar invited her to see the grave,
and she consented to go provided the pipes and tobacco were
cleared away. That was done, and Miss Smiley visited the spot,
and gave her opinion that it was a heavenly place, and that she
was certain Joseph Farrar was not such a wicked man as people
said he was. She so praised the grave and Farrar that in a weak
moment he proposed that she should share the grave with him when
the time arrived. Naturally, she jumped at this as a genuine
offer of marriage and accepted him straight out, but poor Farrar
explained in vain that it was only a general and platonic kind of
invitation to her as a new convert; a sort of encouragement But
she had nailed him, and he couldn't draw back under a breach of
promise case. Needless to say, his friends felt it deeply, for
they foresaw the end of their diversions. The marriage came off,
and was anything but a joyous ceremony.</p>

<p>'When a man marries under threat of a breach of promise action
he doesn't feel over and above cheerful, and Farrar looked about
fit to occupy his grave permanently forthwith. Her first step was
to insist upon the grave being covered in and the meetings
stopped. Farrar held out a long time, but at last she nagged him
into it, and he consented on condition that he might hold a
farewell meeting. The boys solemnly rolled up at the appointed
time, but there was not much joy about it, and it was the most
appropriate meeting to their surroundings they had yet held. When
it was over Farrar bade them all an affecting farewell, and said
that he would like to remain there and smoke a last pipe by
himself, so they climbed up the ladder and left him there.</p>

<p>'Farrar did not come home, and when night came Sarah became
anxious and started for the grave with a man with a lantern. No
one answered them. The ladder was there still, and the man went
down. There were the remains of the late meeting, but no Farrar,
nor sign of him. Nor was there any sign of him anywhere for many
weeks, although the country, side was searched by energetic
parties high and low. The bride was inconsolable, the more so as
particularly nasty remarks were made by her neighbors, and duly
retailed to her by her dearest friends. These were to the effect
that she had hunted the poor man to death, and it was no wonder
that the unhappy Farrar had fled and committed suicide, rather
than remain tied to a woman who had threatened him with a breach
of promise action into marrying her. Mrs. Farrar had anything but
a pleasant time of it.</p>

<p>'Meanwhile all sorts of rumors came in about the missing
Farrar. He had been seen on a bike 200 miles west of Bourke, He
had shaved off his beard and moustache, and was a barmaid at
Coolgardie. He had joined the Salvation Army, and had been seen
selling "War Cries" in Sydney. At last, after being vainly
advertised for, the lawyers in the neighboring township produced
his will, made soon after his marriage.</p>

<p>'The contents seemed to show that the missing man evidently
contemplated his disappearance. He left all his property in trust
to his two brothers, with the exception of an allowance of
thirty shillings a week to his widow and a salary for the
management of his properties to his two brothers. His grave was
not to be closed until his body was laid in it, no matter how
long it was kept open. When he was properly buried his property
was to be divided amongst his relatives, who were to continue the
allowance to his widow as long as she remained single.</p>

<p>'It was a regular Tom Fool of a will, and nearly broke Mrs.
Farrar's heart. She tried to upset it on the ground of insanity,
and claimed a third share. But Farrar was a good, sensible
man&mdash;barring the exception of having his grave made
comfortable and then dying where he could not be put in it. If he
was dead the lawyers told her she would have no case, and she had
to meekly subsist on her one pound ten; for the court decided
that the will should hold good for a certain number of years, or
until either Farrar returned or his corpse was found.</p>

<p>'Every few months the advertisement for the missing Joseph
Farrar duly appeared, and a reward was offered for information
concerning his whereabouts or proof of his death, but nothing
came of it and the grave, from being left open, began to cave in
at the sides and generally fall into decay. A year or two had
passed, and Sarah Farrar began to cast sheep's eyes at a certain
wealthy old fellow who was a neighbor of hers. He was only known
to spend money in one way, and that was going to law. That was
the one joy of his existence. He never paid anybody until they
summoned him. He had just had a long and interesting case decided
against him; a case that had lasted two years or more, and had
been a most exquisite pleasure to him, so that he felt quite
lonely, and miserable when it was decided. Although he had lost,
the verdict did not carry costs of both sides; so the other man,
although he won, was ruined, and old Daniels&mdash;that was his
name&mdash;was just as pleased as if he had won it.</p>

<p>'He cast about for another source of amusement, and thought
that Farrar's will was the very thing. Farrar was dead right
enough, of that he was convinced. If he married Sarah he would
fight the will, and claim her full share as widow; so they agreed
to get married, but it broke his heart at the idea of
relinquishing the thirty shillings a week. But it had to be done.
The Farrar brothers were smart men, and not likely to give up an
inch of their legal rights. So he married the widow and the law
suit.</p>

<p>'The brothers were not at all happy, for the will, though
clear enough in intention, was loosely worded, and it seemed that
the necessity of finding the corpse of Joseph and closing up the
grave properly was the main thing. As long as there was any doubt
of his death and the grave, which was In a frightful state now,
was open, old Daniels nearly plagued them to death with
injunctions and interdictions, and other law missiles to stop
their meddling with the property, that it seemed very soon that
there would be nothing left to fight over.</p>

<p>'The brothers tried all sorts of dodges to get a reasonable
and likely corpse to pass for Joseph. They were accused of
putting away half a dozen swagmen, and carting their remains
underground to ripen to the proper age. Dead cows' bones and
horses' skeletons were selected, but none of them answered the
purpose, and the grave remained open.</p>

<p>'Daniels lost case after case, and every time he paid a
lawyer's bill he cut down the household expenses, until at last
there was nothing left to cut, and poor Sarah was well nigh
starved, and regretted her thirty bob a week, which at least was
enough to get something to eat.</p>

<p>'It was a bright moonlight night, and one of the brothers was
coming home from the township past the cemetery, when he heard
somebody cursing and swearing a good 'un. He was not a
superstitious man, and he hung his horse on the fence and went
quietly in on foot to see who it was. It was near the grave that
had made all the fuss, and when he got close he saw a figure like
his missing brother's, damning and cursing everything an inch
high and an hour old, at the state the grave was in. He made out
for certain that it was his brother in flesh and blood, no ghost
could have indulged in such talented blasphemy, so he went boldly
up and accosted him. Joseph turned on him and gave him an
almighty dressing down for the way the grave had been
neglected&mdash;said he had come home on purpose to die in it,
and now it was not in a state to receive the corpse of a dead
blackfellow who had died of paralysis.</p>

<p>'They had a long confab&mdash;Joseph told his brother how he
had felt so mad at Sarah yarding him up with a breach-of-promise
action that he had determined to give her a lesson, and had
cleared out. He had gone to West Australia and been very lucky,
but got typhoid fever bad; and thought he'd come home and die
quietly, and be buried in his own special grave; and found it
full of old bricks&mdash;it was too bad.</p>

<p>'They made it up, and Joseph was informed of how the land lay.
When he heard that his widow had married old miser Daniels he was
overjoyed when he thought what bad times Sarah must be getting,
and wanted to go away again at once and leave her to it; but his
brother managed to persuade him otherwise, and they concocted a
plot between them and parted. Tom Farrar announced the next
morning that it was a disgrace to the family, the dilapidation
that Joseph's grave had fallen into, and he was going to have it
restored. It was a crying shame that when one member of a family
had made a nice cosy grave for himself the others did not try to
keep it in order, but let it go to rack and ruin. Perhaps the
poor fellow was laid in some cold, wet place, where even a ghost
would get influenza. He wouldn't be a bit surprised if the ghost
of Joseph came back to see about it.</p>

<p>'As soon as the news of the restoration reached old Daniels he
proceeded at once to take out an injunction to stay proceedings,
but it was so long before the matter came on that the grave had
been finished before then, and he couldn't well pull it all down
again! Meantime Sarah was very ill&mdash;what with the worry of
the law suits, to which she was not accustomed, and the
semi-starvation that old miser Daniels indulged in, she took sick
and began to think of her coming end.</p>

<p>'She recognised that if she hadn't commenced by bally-ragging
Farrar she would have been decently comfortable, and would have
had a nice respectable grave to go to, instead of being married
for a lawsuit and half starved to death. But she said it was a
judgment on her as she had married Farrar by a threat of going to
law. Just before she died she sent for Tom Farrar and begged to
be buried in the grave which had been freshly done up. Now, if
old Daniels had known that she wanted to be buried there, and Tom
had consented, he would have planted her body anywhere to have
stopped it; but he didn't know, and, out of sheer, thoroughgoing
cussedness, he demanded, as a right that she should be buried
there, and when Tom pretended to reluctantly consent he went,
about with his head up, boasting how he had made those Farrars
knuckle down at last.</p>

<p>'When Joseph, who was lying sick, for he had never shaken off
the typhoid, and was keeping quiet in the town about fifty miles
away, heard of Sarah's death and her desire to be buried in the
grave he had made, he was greatly pleased at her showing such
reformation before death. And the idea of his work not being
thrown away was nearly too much too much for him in his weak
state, but he recovered; and was anxious to attend the funeral,
but Tom persuaded him not to, because old Daniels would be there,
and it would look very remarkable to see two husbands attending
the funeral of one and the same wife. Joseph consented to lie
quiet a little longer, but he was much disappointed, for he
wanted to make a speech on the occasion and point out the
success, of his principles of burial.</p>

<p>'Sarah had a great funeral, for everybody was anxious to see
the first body put in the grave that had occasioned so much fuss,
and after it was over Tom informed the people that he had heard
of his brother, who was alive, and had been to Coolgardie and
made money there; but was not very strong, and that the name on
the stone would be Sarah Farrar, and not Daniels; that she had a
perfect right to be buried in that grave, and it was not done
because old Daniels had insisted on it. This was a great blow to
the old man, and he went home very unhappy; but the next day,
when the news of Joseph being alive had got about, he began to
have all the lawyers' bills coming in, for, of course; as Sarah
had never been his wife, he had no moral right to her law suits,'
and the Farrars threatened him with a number of complicated
actions for suing them when he had nothing to do with it; and
Joseph promised to go for him for starving his wife to death, so
Daniels had more law than he could tackle at one and the same
time.</p>

<p>'But the old man was plucky: he shaped up to them all, and
fought them from one court to another, until he had not a penny
left, and then the spiteful old man went and cut his throat right
over the nice clean new headstone erected to the late Sarah
Farrar.</p>

<p>'Joseph did not linger long. The intricate and various law
suits that had been occasioned by his eccentric conduct were
talked of all over the colonies and gave him great satisfaction.
His portrait appeared in some of the papers as the founder of the
"Comfortable Grave Reform Society," and they stated that his
first convert was his beloved wife, and that Daniels had
committed suicide because he had been refused burial in the model
tomb. All this was very pleasant to Joseph, and he spent the last
weeks of his life designing an elaborate tombstone for himself,
with a glass frame let in, so that the newspaper portrait could
be placed there. He died very happy at what he considered the
success of his mission.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>24. -- A POET'S MISTAKE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 28 Aug 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
CHARLES AUGUSTUS was a rising young poet, and Belinda was his
sweetheart, and they both loved wisely and well. There was no
possible reason why they should not. There was no one had the
slightest objection to their loving as much as they liked. And
they accordingly did so. When I say Charles Augustus was a poet,
I do not mean a professional poet, for there are not many of
those gifted and lucky beings in the world. But he was of a
poetic nature, a dreamer of dreams, and out of the many effusions
he had indulged in he had lately had two of them printed, so he
considered himself a rising poet.</p>

<p>Not that there was any pay connected with the matter, but
still they had a chance of being read; which was fame at any
rate. Belinda was romantic, too, and had the highest opinion of
Augustus's abilities, poetical and otherwise. Augustus had a
moderately good clerical position, and Belinda's father was a
tradesman, so that there seemed no reason why the course of true
love should not run smooth for once in a way.</p>

<p>But it did not, and all through Augustus's poetry.</p>

<p>He had been showing the printed pieces with becoming modesty
to his possible father-in-law, and that gentleman, whose name was
Rawlins, remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>'And how much did they pay you for them?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' replied Augustus, 'I believe it is not usual to pay
for poetical contributions.'</p>

<p>'Oh it ain't, ain't it? Well, I'd see that it was. If you like
I'll go round to that newspaper and give them rats.'</p>

<p>Augustus pleaded with Mr. Rawlins, and at last succeeded in
moderating his wrath, but the worthy tradesman still felt very
virtuously indignant. Suddenly an idea occurred to him. Turning
to Augustus he remarked, would you use to write poetry for
somebody who would pay you, and have it printed, too?'</p>

<p>Augustus replied that it was the dearest dream of his life,
and the hope of his youth.</p>

<p>'Well, then, I'll settle it for you. I don't say that the pay
will be staggering, but you will be paid for it, and it will be
printed.'</p>

<p>Augustus confided the proposal to Belinda, and they both
rejoiced over it, and the worthy father and prospective
father-in-law. In the course of time Rawlins said that he had a
job for Augustus.</p>

<p>'It is only a little one, but you must give my friend a
specimen of your style first. It's 5 shillings for five
verses.'</p>

<p>The sum was not startling, but Augustus accepted at once, in
view of future favors.</p>

<p>'I've got a friend who's an ironmonger, and he's crazy on
those here rhyming advertisements, and he wants one on a new kind
of camp-oven he's got. Five verses, and he wants the word
camp-oven brought in at the end of the line as often as
possible.' Augustus nearly fainted. The great offer was only a
rhyming advertisement for 5 shillings. And he was required to
find a rhyme for camp-oven, he who always was a bad hand at
finding rhymes.</p>

<p>Rawlins saw the dismay on his face, and said, 'Well, what's
the matter with it. I said it should be paid for and printed, and
isn't that so?'</p>

<p>Augustus admitted that it was so, and seeing that it was
Belinda's father he was talking to, promised to do his best to
earn the munificent payment. Belinda's romantic temperament was
deeply hurt when she heard of this downfall of their hopes, for
they had believed that it was some magazine of art and culture
that was in view. However, there was nothing for it but to slave
at the task, and his leisure hours were consumed in finding
rhymes for camp-oven. He got as far as 'sloven' and 'McGoven,'
and then he had to fall back on such words as 'shoving' and
'loving,' that by mispronunciation could be got to pass
muster.</p>

<p>However, the ironmonger was not particular, and paid up the 5
shillings, and the wretched stuff was duly printed. When they
appeared in type Augustus thought they were not half bad; but
Belinda was horrified. From that date commenced the little rift
within the lute.</p>

<p>Augustus grew infatuated with his new avenue to literature,
and Belinda proportionately disgusted. The more outrageous were
the rhymes the more he admired the work when it was finished and
printed; until he was game to rhyme anything in the ironmonger's
shop. If occasionally his former verses, mostly written to
Belinda, were re-read, they struck him as mawkish and sentimental
beside the boldness and originality of his latter flights.</p>

<p>Poor Belinda did not think so, however, and sighed over his
relapse from the higher flights. She remonstrated with her father
for having brought the matter about, but he laughed. Why, he was
getting nothing for that flimsy stuff he used to write, and now
he's adding about a pound a week to his income.</p>

<p>One day after Belinda had been more than usually snappish
about the shortcomings of his poetry; they parted in a tiff.
Augustus, to soothe his wounded feelings, went for a steamer
trip. It was Saturday afternoon, and there were many people on
board, and Augustus met a young damsel of his acquaintance, who
was gracious to him.</p>

<p>'O, Mr. Augustus, someone told me that you wrote those verses
in the papers for Jackson, the ironmonger; and others. How do you
do it?'</p>

<p>Here was sympathy and balm for his wounded feelings.</p>

<p>'Do you like them?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Like them! O, so much. Sometimes I have to laugh, and
sometimes cry over them. There was one about a gridiron and a
corkscrew that I thought so clever. How is it done?'</p>

<p>Augustus smiled, and for the rest of the trip the young people
were mutually agreeable. Before their return he promised to
introduce the young lady's name, Amelia Mirls, into one. He only
said he wished it was more difficult, just to show what he could
do in the poetic line.</p>

<p>'Why what rhymes with it? I can think of nothing,' she
said.</p>

<p>'O, heaps of things. Twirls, and swirls and girls and
curls.'</p>

<p>'Fancy! I never thought of all that. I've got a
brother-in-law, his name's Corkerley. Can you bring that in.'</p>

<p>'I'll try, said Augustus, rather staggered, but courageous.
They parted, and Augustus on the next opportunity tomahawked out
a ballad, in which Amelia Mirls was made to rhyme very prettily
with the other rhymes he had suggested, but when it came to
Corkerley he felt himself floored. At last, in desperation, he
coined the word 'talkerly,' and wound up by saying that her
sister met a man who came and looked so talkerly, she married him
without ado, and changed her name to Corkerley.'</p>

<p>This is a specimen of Augustus's muse.</p>

<p>Belinda had ceased to read the advertising effusions, but on
this occasion she did, and the whole depth of her lover's
duplicity was revealed to her. She knew Amelia Mirls and her
disposition to flirt, and she guessed how it all came about.
There was a short and sharp interview between her and her
recreant Augustus, and he was told to go to his Amelia Mirls, and
see Belinda no more; and he went.</p>

<p>Now it happened unfortunately for Augustus that the Corkerly
brother had a reputation for talking on every possible occasion,
and he also had a brother, who was engaged to the volatile
Amelia. The indignation, therefore, of the Corkerly family knew
no bounds. Amelia, on being taxed, like a true woman, denied any
knowledge of the writer, and it was deemed that he must be some
obscure unknown enemy of the family, and the Corkerly brother was
deputed to interview him on discovery.</p>

<p>Augustus was discovered, and the interview took place,
resulting in mutual high words and threats, but nothing more,
excepting that as the paper publishing the advertisements was
threatened with an action for libel, Augustus lost the small
additional income he had been making. But he fortunately did not
lose Belinda, for, making a virtue of necessity, he vowed that he
had given up writing poetical advertisements for her sake, and
they were reconciled.</p>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney, 20 Dec 1890</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was the hottest day the Gulf had seen for years. Burning,
scorching and blistering heat, beating down directly from the
vertical sun, in the open, radiating from the iron roof which
provided what was mistakenly called shade. In the whole township
there was not a corner to be found where a man could escape the
suffocating sense of being in the stoke-hole of a steamer.</p>

<p>The surroundings were not of a nature to be grateful to eyes
wearied with the monotony of plain and forest. The few stunted
trees that had been spared appeared to be sadly regretting that
they had not shared the fate of their comrades, and the barren
ironstone ridge on which the township was built gave back all the
sun's heat it had previously absorbed with interest.</p>

<p>Two men who had just come in from the country swore that where
they crossed the Flinders the alligators came out and begged for
a cold drink from their water-bags; and the most confirmed
sceptic admitted the existence of a material hell. Naturally
there was little or no business doing and, just as naturally,
everybody whose inclination pointed that way went "on the
spree."</p>

<p>Amongst those who had not adopted this mode of killing old
father Time were two men in the verandah of the Royal Hotel.
(When Australia becomes republican it is to be presumed that a
'Royal' will cease to be the distinguishing feature of every
township.)</p>

<p>The two men in question were seated on canvas chairs in the
verandah, both lightly attired in shirt and trousers only, busily
engaged in mopping the perspiration from their streaming faces,
and swearing at the flies.</p>

<p>"Deuced sight hotter lounging about here than travelling,"
said Davis, the elder of the two; "I vote we make a start."</p>

<p>"I'm agreeable," replied his companion; "the horses must be
starving out in the paddock. We shall have a job to get Delaine
away, though; he's bent on seeing his cheque through."</p>

<p>"That won't take long at the rate he's going. He's got every
loafer in the town hanging about after him."</p>

<p>"Hullo! what's that?" said the other, as the shrill whistle of
a steam launch was heard. "Oh! of course, the steamer arrived at
the mouth of the river last night; that's the launch coming up.
Shall we go down and see who is on board?"</p>

<p>The two men got up and joined the stragglers who were wending
their way across the bare flat to the bank of the river. The
passengers were few in number, but they included some strangers
to the place; one of whom, a young-looking man with white hair
and beard, immediately attracted Davis' attention.</p>

<p>"See that chap, Bennett?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick, who is he?"</p>

<p>"Some years ago he was with me roving for a trip; when we
started he was as young-looking as you, and his hair as dark.
It's a true bill about a man's hair going white in one night. His
did."</p>

<p>"What from? Fright?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We buried him alive by mistake."</p>

<p>"The deuce you did!"</p>

<p>"He had a cataleptic fit when he was on watch one night. The
other man&mdash;we were double-banking the watch at the
time&mdash;found him as stiff as a poker, and we all thought he
was dead, there was no sign of life in him. It was hot
weather&mdash;as bad as this&mdash;and we couldn't keep him, so
we dug a grave, and started to bury him at sundown. He came to
when we were filling in the grave; yelled blue murder, and
frightened the life out of us. His hair that night turned as you
see it now, although he vows that it was not the fright of being
buried alive that did it."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Something that happened when he was in the fit, or trance. He
has never told anybody anything more than that he was quite
conscious all the time, and had a very strange experience."</p>

<p>"Ever ask him anything?"</p>

<p>"No; he didn't like talking about it. Wonder what he's doing
up here?"</p>

<p>By this time the river bank was deserted; Davis and Bennett
strolled up after the others and when they arrived at the Royal,
they found the hero of the yarn there before them.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Maxwell," said Davis, "what's brought you up this
way?"</p>

<p>Maxwell started slightly when he saw his quondam sexton; but
he met him frankly enough although at first he disregarded the
question that had been asked.</p>

<p>In the course of the conversation that followed Maxwell stated
that he was on his way out to the Nicholson River, but with what
object did not transpire.</p>

<p>"Bennett and I were just talking of making a start to-morrow,
or the next day. Our cattle are spelling on some country just
this side of the Nicholson. We can't travel until the wet season
comes and goes. You had better come with us."</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad," replied the other, and the thing was
settled.</p>

<p>Bennett had been looking curiously at this man who had had
such a narrow escape of immortality, but beyond the strange
whiteness of his hair, which contrasted oddly with the swarthy
hue of his sunburnt face, and a nervous look in his eyes, he did
not show any trace of his strange experience. On the contrary, he
promised, on nearer acquaintance, to be a pleasant travelling
companion.</p>

<p>The summer day drew to a close, the red sun sank in the heated
haze that hovered immediately above the horizon, and a calm,
sultry night, still and oppressive, succeeded the fierce blaze of
the day-time. The active and industrious mosquito commenced his
rounds and men tossed and moaned and perspired under nets made of
coarse cheese-cloth.</p>

<p>The next morning broke hot and sullen as before. Davis had
risen early to send a man out to the paddock after the horses,
and was in the bar talking to the pyjama-attired landlord.</p>

<p>"You'll have to knock off his grog or there'll be trouble," he
said; "he was up all last night wandering about with his belt and
revolver on, muttering to himself, and when a fellow does that
he's got 'em pretty bad."</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can, but if he doesn't get drink here he will
somewhere else," replied the other reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Then I'll see the P.M. and get him to prohibit his being
served. It's the only way to get him straight."</p>

<p>At this moment the subject of their remarks entered the
bar&mdash;a young fellow about five or six and twenty. He was
fully dressed, it being evident that he had not gone to bed all
night. The whites of his eyes were not blood-shot, but blood-red
throughout, and the pupils so dilated that they imparted a look
of unnatural horror to his face.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Davis," he shouted; "glad to see a white man at last.
That old nigger with the white hair has been after me all night.
The old buck who was potted in the head. He comes around every
night now with his flour-bag cobra all over blood. Can't get a
wink of sleep for him. Have a drink?"</p>

<p>His speech was quite distinct, he was past the stage when
strong waters thicken the voice; his walk was steady, and but for
the wild eyes, he might have passed for a man who was simply
tired out with a night's riding or watching.</p>

<p>The landlord glanced enquiringly at Davis, as if to put the
responsibility of serving the liquor on him.</p>

<p>"Too early, Delaine, and too hot already; besides, I'm going
to start to-day and mustn't get tight before breakfast," said the
latter soothingly.</p>

<p>"O be hanged! Here, give us something," and the young fellow
turned towards the bar, and as he did so caught sight of Maxwell
who had just come to the door and was looking in.</p>

<p>The effect of the dark face and snow-white hair on his excited
brain was awful to witness. His eyes, blazing before, seemed now
simply coals of fire. Davis and the landlord turned to see what
the madman was looking at, and that moment was nearly fatal to
the newcomer. Muttering: "By&mdash;he's taken to following me by
daylight as well, has he? But I'll soon stop him;" he drew his
revolver and, but that Davis turned his head again and was just
in time to knock his hand up, Maxwell would have been past
praying for. The landlord ran round the bar, and with some
trouble the three men got the pistol from the maniac, who raved,
bit, and fought, like a wild beast. The doctor, who slept in the
house, was called, and, not particularly sober himself, injected
some morphia into the patient's arm, which soon sent him into a
stupor.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Davis, you saved my life," said Maxwell; "that
blessed lunatic would have potted me sure enough only for you.
Whom did he take me for?"</p>

<p>"He's in the horrors, his name is Delaine, and he's out on a
station on the tableland. They had some trouble with the blacks
up there lately, and, I suppose, it was the first
dispersing-match he had ever seen. There was one white-haired old
man got a bullet through his head, and he says he felt as though
his own father had been shot when he saw it done. He's a
clergyman's son; of course he drinks like a fish and is
superstitious as well."</p>

<p>"I trust they'll lock him up until I get out of the town; but
I'll remember your share of this. Wait until we get away and I
will tell you what brought me up here, but don't ask me any
questions now. Is your friend Bennett to be trusted?"</p>

<p>"In what way? Wine, women or gold? I don't know about the
first two, but the last I can answer for."</p>

<p>"It's a secret. Possibly connected with the last."</p>

<p>"I hope so, I want some bad enough. I think I know where to
put you on to a couple of good horses, and then we'll make a
start."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>THE stove-like township is three days journey away; four men,
Davis, Bennett, Maxwell, and a blackfellow are camped for the
night by the side of a small lagoon covered with the broad leaves
of the purple water-lily. In the distance the cheery sound of the
horse-bells can be heard, and round the fire the travellers are
grouped listening to Maxwell who is telling the tale he has never
yet told.</p>

<p>"When I fell down on watch that night and became to all
appearance a corpse, I never, for one instant, lost either
consciousness or memory. My soul, spirit, or whatever you like to
call it, parted company with my body, but I retained all former
powers of observation. I gazed at myself lying there motionless,
waited until my fellow-watcher came around and awakened the
sleeping camp with the tidings of my death, then, without any
impulse of my own, I left the spot and found myself in a shadowy
realm where all was vague and confused. Strange, indistinct
shapes flitted constantly before me; I heard voices and sounds
like sobbing and weeping.</p>

<p>"Now, before I go on any further, let me tell you that I have
never been subject to these fits. I never studied any occult
arts, nor troubled myself about what I called 'such rubbish.' Why
this experience should have happened to me I cannot tell. I found
I was travelling along pretty swiftly, carried on by some unknown
motive power, or, rather, drifting on with a current of misty
forms in which all seemed confusion.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, to my surprise, I found myself on the earth once
more, in a place quite unknown to me.</p>

<p>"I was in Australia&mdash;that much I recognised at a
glance&mdash;but where abouts?</p>

<p>"I was standing on the bank of a river&mdash;a northern river,
evidently, for I could see the foliage of the drooping ti-trees
and Leichhardt trees further down its course. The surrounding
country was open, but barren; immediately in front of me was a
rugged range through which the river found its way by means of an
apparently impenetrable gorge. The black rocks rose abruptly on
either side of a deep pool of water, and all progress was barred
except by swimming. The ranges on either hand were precipitous,
cleft by deep ravines; all the growth to be seen was spinifex,
save a few stunted bloodwood trees.</p>

<p>"What struck me most forcibly was that in the centre of the
waterhole, at the entrance of the gorge, as it were, there arose
two rocks, like pillars, some twelve or fifteen feet in height
above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>"Below the gorge the river-bed was sandy, and the usual timber
grew on either bank. At first I thought I was alone, but, on
looking around, I found that a man was standing a short distance
away from me. Apparently he was a European, but so tanned and
burnt by the sun as to be almost copper-coloured. He was
partially clothed in skins, and held some hunting weapons in his
hand. He was gazing absently into the gorge when I first noticed
him, but presently turned, and, without evincing any surprise or
curiosity, beckoned to me. Immediately, in obedience to some
unknown impulse, I found myself threading the gloomy gorge with
him, although, apparently, we exercised no motion. It was more as
though we stood still and the rocks glided past us and the water
beneath us. We soon reached a small open space or pocket; here
there was a rude hut, and here we halted.</p>

<p>"My strange companion looked around and without speaking, drew
my attention to a huge boulder close to the hut and on which
letters and figures were carved. I made out the principal
inscription. <i>'Hendrick Heermans, hier vangecommen, 1670.'</i>
There were also an anchor, a ship and a heart, all neatly cut. I
turned from these records to the man. He beckoned me again, and I
followed him across the small open space and up a ravine. The man
pointed to a reef cropping out and crossing the gully. I looked
at it and saw that the cap had been broken and that gold was
showing freely in the stone. The man waved his hand up the gully
as though intimating that there were more reefs there.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, sweeping up the gorge came a gust of ice-cold wind,
and with it a dash of mist or spray. Looming out of this I saw
for a moment a young girl's face looking earnestly at me. Her
lips moved. 'Go back. Go back!' she seemed to whisper.</p>

<p>"When I heard this I felt an irresistible longing to return to
my discarded body and in an instant gorge, mountains and all my
surroundings disappeared, and I found myself in the twilight
space battling despairingly on, for I felt that I had lost my way
and should never find it again.</p>

<p>"How was I to reach my forsaken body through such a vague,
misty and indeterminate land? Impalpable forms threw themselves
in my path. Strange cries and wailings led me astray, and all the
while there was a smell like death in my nostrils, and I knew
that I must return or die.</p>

<p>"O, the unutterable anguish of that time! Ages seem to pass
during which I was fighting with shadows, until at last I saw a
sinking sun, an open grave, and men whose faces I knew,
commencing to shovel earth on a senseless body.</p>

<p>"Mine!</p>

<p>"I had felt no pain when my soul left, but the re-entrance of
it into its tenement was such infinite agony, that it forced from
me terrible cries that caused my rescue from suffocation."</p>

<p>Maxwell paused, and the other two were silent.</p>

<p>"You will wonder," he resumed, "what all this has to do with
my present journey. I will tell you. You remember Milford, a
surveyor up here, at one time he was running the boundary-line
between Queensland and South Australia for the Queensland
Government. A year ago I met him, and we were talking about the
country up this way. In running the line he had to follow the
Nicholson up a good way, until finally he was completely blocked.
He described to me the place where he had to turn back. It was
the waterhole in the gorge with the two rock-like pillars rising
out of the water."</p>

<p>Again there was silence for a while, then Davis said
musingly.</p>

<p>"It's impossible to pronounce any opinion at present; the
coincidence of Milford's report is certainly startling. But why
should this sign have been vouchsafed to you? Apparently this
being you saw was the ghost of some old Dutch sailor wrecked or
marooned here in the days of the early discovery of Australia.
Had you any ancestors among those gentry?"</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of," returned Maxwell, "but if we find
the place we shall certainly make some interesting discovery,
apart from any gold."</p>

<p>"And the girl's face?" enquired Bennett.</p>

<p>Maxwell did not answer for a minute or two.</p>

<p>"I may as well tell you all," he said then; "I was in
Melbourne, after I saw Milford, and I met a girl with that same
face, in the street. Strange, too, we could not help looking at
each other as though we knew we had met before. That meeting
decided me on taking the trip up here. Now, that is really all.
Are you ready for the adventure?"</p>

<p>"I should think so," said Davis; "we have fresh horses at the
camp, and nothing to do with ourselves for three months or more.
Please God, on Christmas Day we'll be on Tom Tiddler's ground
picking up gold in chunks."</p>

<p>"One question more," put in Bennett. "Have you ever had any
return of these trances or cataleptic fits?"</p>

<p>"Never since, not the slightest sign of one."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THERE was no doubt about the strange proof or coincidence,
whichever it should turn out to be. The three men stood on the
bank of the Nicholson River gazing at the gorge and the
waterhole, from the bosom of which rose the two upright pillars
of rock. Two weeks had elapsed since they were camped at the
lagoon.</p>

<p>"It is the same place," muttered Maxwell, and, as the
overwhelming horror of his fight through shadowland came back to
him, he leant on his horse's shoulder and bowed his head down on
the mane.</p>

<p>Bennett made a sign to Davis and both men were silent for a
while, then Davis spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, old man, as we are not possessed of the supernatural
power you had when you were last here, we'll have to get over
that range somehow."</p>

<p>Maxwell lifted his head. "We shall have to tackle the range,
but I expect we shall have a job to get the horses over. How
about leaving them here in hobbles and going up on foot?"</p>

<p>"Not to be thought of," replied Davis; "why, the niggers'
tracks just back there in the bed of the river, are as thick as
sheep-tracks. The horses would be speared before we got five
miles away. I know these beggars."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Bennett.</p>

<p>Davis eyed the range curiously for some time. "There's a spur
there that we can work our way up, I think," he said at last,
indicating with his hand the spot he meant. The other two, after
a short inspection, agreed with him. It was then nearly noon, so
the horses were turned out for a couple of hours' spell, a fire
lit and the billy boiled.</p>

<p>"What could have led your Dutch sailor up this way?" said
Davis as, the meal over, they were enjoying an after-dinner
pipe.</p>

<p>"That is what has puzzled me. I have read up everything I
could get hold of on the subject of Dutch discovery and can find
no record of any ship visiting the Gulf about that date," replied
Maxwell.</p>

<p>"There may have been plenty of ships here, of which neither
captain nor crew wanted a record kept. Those were the days of the
buccaneers," said Bennett.</p>

<p>"Yes, but with the exception of the ship Dampier was on board
of, they did not come out of their way to New Holland," returned
Maxwell.</p>

<p>"The <i>Bachelor's Delight</i> and the <i>Cygnet</i> were on
the west coast, as you say; why not others who had not the luck
to be associated with the immortal Dampier?"</p>

<p>"True; but the Dutch were not noted as buccaneers. However,
plenty of ships may have been lost in the Gulf of which all
record has disappeared. The question is, what brought the man up
into this region?" said Davis.</p>

<p>"I firmly believe we shall find the clue to that secret, when
we find the ravine. It seems incredible that a shipwrecked or
marooned man should have left the sea-coast, whereon was his only
hope of salvation and have made south into an unknown land,
through such a range as this."</p>

<p>"Well, boys, we'll make a start for it," said Davis, jumping
up; and the party were soon in their saddles.</p>

<p>The range proved pretty stiff climbing, and they were so often
baulked, and forced to retrace their steps, that it was sundown
before they reached the top.</p>

<p><br>
IT was a desolate outlook for a camp. A rough tableland of
spinifex&mdash;evidently extending too far for them to attempt to
go on and descend the other side before darkness set in&mdash;lay
before them.</p>

<p>"Nothing for it but to go on and tie the horses up all night,"
said Bennett. Fortune, however, favoured them; in about a mile
they came on a small patch of grass, sufficient for the horses,
and as their water-bags were full, they gladly turned out.</p>

<p>For a time the conversation turned on their expectations for
the morrow, but gradually it dropped, as the fire died down. One
by one the stars in their courses looked down through the
openings of the tree-tops on the wanderers sleeping below, and
silence, save for the occasional clink of a hobble, reigned
supreme until the first flush of dawn.</p>

<p>"Well, Maxwell," said Davis, as they were discussing
breakfast, "hear anything from your old Dutch navigator last
night?"</p>

<p>"No, but I had some confused sort of dream again about this
place; I thought I heard that voice once more telling me to 'go
back'. But that, of course, is only natural."</p>

<p>"I think we are close to the spot," remarked Bennett. "When I
was after the horses this morning I could see down into the
river, and there appeared to be an open pocket there."</p>

<p>Bennett proved right. In half-an-hour's time they were
scrambling down the range, and soon stood in an open space that
Maxwell at once identified.</p>

<p>Naturally everybody was slightly excited. Although at first
inclined to put the story down to hallucination, the subsequent
events had certainly shaken this belief in the minds of the two
friends. Maxwell silently pointed to the boulder; there was
something carved on it, but it was worn and indistinct. Two
centuries of weather had almost obliterated whatever marks had
been there.</p>

<p>"They were fresh and distinct when I saw them," said Maxwell,
in an awed voice.</p>

<p>By diligent scrutiny they made out the inscription that he had
repeated, but had they not known it the task would have been most
difficult. The words had not been very deeply marked, and the
face of the boulder fronting north-west, the full force of the
wet seasons had been experienced by the inscription.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful thing," said Davis. "There can be no
doubt as to the age of that."</p>

<p>"Let's go up the ravine and look for the reef and then get
back as soon as possible. I don't like this place. I wish I had
not come," returned Maxwell.</p>

<p>They left the packhorses feeding about and rode up the gully,
taking with them the pick and shovel they had brought. "It was
here, I think," said Maxwell, looking around; "but the place
seems altered."</p>

<p>"Very likely the creek would change its course slightly in a
couple of hundred years, but not much. That looks like an outcrop
there."</p>

<p>"This is the place," said Maxwell, eagerly, "I know it now,
but it is a little changed."</p>

<p>The three dismounted, and Davis, taking the pick, struck the
cap of the reef with the head of it, knocking off some lumps of
stone. As he did so a wild "Holloa!" rang up the gully. All
started and looked at each other with faces suddenly white and
hearts quickly beating. There was something uncanny in such a cry
rising out of the surrounding solitude.</p>

<p>"Blacks?" said Bennett, doubtfully. Davis shook his head. Once
more the loud shout was raised, apparently coming from the
direction of the inscribed rock.</p>

<p>"Let's go and see what it is, anyway," said Davis&mdash;and
they mounted and rode down the gully again, Bennett, who had
picked up a bit of the quartz, putting it into his saddle-pouch
as they rode along.</p>

<p>Maxwell had not spoken since the cry had been heard, his face
was pale and occasionally he muttered to himself, "Go back, go
back!" The packhorses were quietly cropping what scanty grass
there was; all seemed peaceful and quiet.</p>

<p>"I believe it was a bird after all; there's a kind of toucan
makes a devil of a row&mdash;have a look round old man," said
Davis to Bennett, and they both rode up and down the bank of the
river, leaving Maxwell standing near the rock where he had
dismounted. Nothing could be seen, and the two returned and
proposed going up the gully again.</p>

<p>"You fellows go and come back again, I want to get out of
this&mdash;I'm upset," said Maxwell, speaking for the first time
in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>Davis glanced at his friend. "Right you are, old man, no
wonder you don't feel well; we'll just make sure of the reef and
come back. If you want us, fire your pistol; we shan't be far
off."</p>

<p>The two rode back to their disturbed work and hastily
commenced their examination of the stone. There was no doubt
about the richness of the find, and the reef could be traced a
good distance without much trouble. They had collected a small
heap of specimens to take back, when suddenly the loud "Holloa!"
once more came pealing up the gully followed instantly by a
fainter cry and two revolver-shots.</p>

<p>Hastily mounting, the two galloped back.</p>

<p>The packhorses, as if startled, were walking along their
tracks towards home, followed by Maxwell's horse with the bridle
trailing; its rider was stretched on the ground; nothing else was
visible.</p>

<p>Jumping from their horses they approached the prostrate man.
Both started and stared at each other with terror-stricken eyes.
Before them lay a skeleton clad in Maxwell's clothes.</p>

<p>"Are we mad?" cried Davis, aghast with horror.</p>

<p>The fierce sun was above them, the bare mountains around, they
could hear the horses clattering up the range as if anxious to
leave the accursed place, and before them lay a skeleton with the
shrunken skin still adhering to it in places, a corpse that had
been rotting for years; that had relapsed into the state it would
have been had the former trance been death. Blind terror seized
them both, and they mounted to follow the horses when an awful
voice came from the fleshless lips: "Stay with me, stop! I may
come back; I may&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bennett could hear no more, he stuck the spurs in his horse
and galloped off. Davis would have followed but he was transfixed
with terror at what he saw. The awful object was moving, the
outcast spirit was striving desperately to reanimate the body
that had suddenly fallen into decay. The watcher was chained to
the spot. Once it seemed that the horrible thing was really going
to rise, but the struggle was unavailing, with a loud moan of
keenest agony and despair that thrilled the listener's brain with
terror it fell back silent and motionless. Davis remembered
nothing more till he found himself urging his horse up the range.
The place has never been revisited.</p>

<p><br>
IN an asylum for the insane in a southern town there is a
patient named Bennett, who is always talking of the wonderful
reef he has up North. He has a specimen of quartz, very rich,
which he never parts with day or night. He is often visited by a
man named Davis, who nursed him through a severe attack of fever
out on the Nicholson. The doctors think he may yet recover.</p>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>26. -- THE STORY OF LAFONT</h2>

<h3>A GLIMPSE OF ANCIENT AUSTRALIA</h3>

<h3><i>Evening News</i> Sydney, 18, 25 Sep, 2 Oct 1897</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE cry came from the direction in which Falke had gone, and
it was immediately followed by a revolver shot. Evidently Falke
had come across something, and I at once turned and made for the
place when the sound had come.</p>

<p>Lafont had been missing for nearly a week and I, after days of
searching, had only found his tracks the day before. We had
temporarily lost them, and parted to cast round and pick them up.
Falke was off his horse bending over some thing lying on the
ground when I caught sight of him. I could easily guess what it
was, and I rode hastily up and dismounted.</p>

<p>The body of the man we were in search of lay there, but its
appearance and surroundings made us stare in wonderment at each
other. It was naked, the clothes being neatly folded and laid
underneath the head. The eyes were closed, the limbs decently
composed, and a roughly-woven grass mat flung over a portion of
the body. The face was calm and placid, and no sign of
decomposition having set it was visible.</p>

<p>'Is he dead?' I could not help asking, for the man appeared to
be in a quiet slumber.</p>

<p>'Dead, yes,' returned Falke, 'but what killed him?'</p>

<p>We examined the body, and found a scalp wound on the head,
which had been washed and some dressing applied to It, but it was
by no means serious, and could not have caused death. Around were
scattered numerous calabashes and the large wooden vessels known
as 'coolamons' that the blacks carry water in; some of these
still held a quantity of water. Beyond that, and the tracks of
the natives, there was no sign how the unfortunate man met his
fate.</p>

<p>Lafont was a relation of Falke's, and had only been on the
station a few months. He had a craze for botany, and had started
out intending to visit a salt lake that was situated beyond where
we then were. He had not reached there, for we had been out there
looking tor him, and now it was evident that he had not carried
out his original intention; and in some way had come to grief. We
were in a part of our newly taken-up run in Central Australia, of
which we knew but little. To the north of the low rocky ridge on
which we were standing, the low rises forming the western
extremity of the range group known as the Macdonnell Ranges were
visible. Towering above them was a solitary peak, known as
Condon's Bluff, although none of us had actually been to the foot
of it.</p>

<p>'What do you make of this?' said Falke at last. 'Who dressed
that wound on his head and arranged the body? And, if he was
dead, what did they want to dress the wound for?'</p>

<p>'The blacks have been here,' I began, when he interrupted me
in a fretful manner, for which Just then I forgave him, knowing
he had a great liking for his young cousin.</p>

<p>'Of course the blacks have been here, but they were not likely
to do this. If so, they are a very different kind of blacks to
any I ever heard of in Australia.' His words recalled to my mind
something an old friend said to me once. He was one who had
studied the aboriginals thoroughly, not in one local tribe, but
all over the continent, and knew them as well as any man
living.</p>

<p>'Believe me,' he had said, 'if anything of the long past
history of Australia ever comes to light, it will be in Central
Australia. There are clues to be found there, but I fear that it
is too late to follow them up.'</p>

<p>Had we found any such clue? Once more I knelt beside the body,
and, taking my watch from my pouch, opened the glass face and
held it over the silent lips; just as I did so we heard the sound
of voices approaching. We both rose hastily, and I am not sure to
this day whether the watch glass was dulled or not.</p>

<p>'The blacks are coming back, Sherwin,' said Falke.</p>

<p>I noticed a little boulder-strewn knoll a short distance from
where we were standing that would form a capital post of
observation where we could conceal ourselves.</p>

<p>'Let us go up there and watch them,' I said.</p>

<p>'They will see our tracks,' returned Falke.</p>

<p>'Yes, but they will think that we have gone back to the
station.'</p>

<p>He nodded assent, and we rode to the back of the little rise,
and found a good place to tie our horses up in a handy clump of
mulga. Then we ensconced ourselves in a good post of vantage and
waited.</p>

<p>The delay was not long. Soon about a dozen figures appeared
making for the spot we had just vacated. Two old blackfellows,
white-bearded and white-haired, came in advance, leading be tween
them another figure, which, to our astonishment, was clothed to a
long sleeveless robe. This person was a woman, dark brown in hue,
with straight hair falling to her shoulders. Her features were of
a peculiarly straight and somewhat angular cast; like the facial
contour of no living race; but it reminded me at once of some of
the sculptured images of the prehistoric times, whose origin we
cannot trace. The face was by no means beautiful, but it was
somewhat stern and inexpressibly mournful.</p>

<p>And we now saw at once that It was a blind face. This
sightless being was carefully guided by the two old men; but as
she came nearer we could see that there appeared no defect
outwardly visible in her eyes. The remainder of the party were
men of the ordinary aboriginal type, and besides their weapons
they carried a rude litter.</p>

<p>Our tracks, of course, at once attracted their attention, but
after some debate they seemed satisfied that we were gone, and
proceeded to the body. The robed woman knelt beside it, put her
hands on the shoulders, and stooped down until her face touched
the face of the seeming corpse. She stopped in this attitude for
some time, then lifted her head and threw it back a little, as
though drawing breath.</p>

<p>Twice more she repeated this performance, the two old men
standing gravely by, and the other blacks gathered in a knot, a
little distance apart, silently watching. Then she rose to her
feet, and at a sign from her the rude litter was brought forward,
the body placed on it, the calabashes and coolamons gathered up,
and the whole party moved off, carrying the body of Lafont with
them, going back the way they had come, apparently straight for
Condon's Bluff.</p>

<p>'We must follow them,' said Falke.</p>

<p>'But not now,' I returned. 'They evidently mean no harm to
Lafont. If he is, as I suspect, still alive, we can easily track
a large party like that. Let us go back to the station and get
fresh horses and rations, for there's no knowing how long we
might have to be away.'</p>

<p>Falke agreed with me, and we hastened home. By daylight next
morning we were off, well supplied for a week. The track led
straight in the direction of the Bluff, ana the country grew very
rugged and broken as we drew nearer to it, and it was with some
difficulty we managed to stick to the trail. Finally we lost the
tracks, and of Lafont himself we saw no more, until six months
afterwards, when he returned to tell his strange story himself.
Of the matter of his discovery and experiences it is best to let
his personal narrative speak for itself.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
'THIS is the truth about what occurred to me while I was under
the rocky dome of Condon's Bluff. How I got there I cannot now
remember, because owing to my horse falling I became came
insensible from a wound on the head. I can only tell of my
experiences after I came back to consciousness.</p>

<p>'It was black dark all around line&mdash;terrible darkness,
that seemed like a blow, smiting you, on the face. And I awoke
also to a sound of wailing and crying.</p>

<p>'Then, suddenly, came light. I found that I was lying on a
hard stone couch of some sort, covered only with a mat of woven
grass. The whole thing was so startling and surprising, that the
superstitions of my youth came back to me at once, and I presumed
that I was dead, and in the nether world.</p>

<p>'In fact, it was a realisation of all that has been pictured
and imagined by the world's religious, and for the moment I
thought I was in the fabled hell of torture.</p>

<p>'As I uprose from the place whereon I was reclining, two
figures came to my side, both evidently aboriginals, white-headed
and white bearded. This brought my wits together. I was still on
earth, but on what part of earth?</p>

<p>'The blacks apparently had no animosity against me; they
simply seemed to be obeying seme superior power, and assisted me
to rise and walk, leading me forward.</p>

<p>'The light in this place where I found myself was now intense,
and every detail was visible; but it sprang from clefts in the
rocky walls of the great cavern I was in, and they were not lit
by human hands. The internal fires of the earth were illuminating
the scene. Then the two old nun helped me to my feet, and led me
to a figure who was advancing to meet me. It was a woman, but of
a countenance that I could only describe by saying, that it was a
face you might see carved in stone, but never in our modern
life.</p>

<p>'The woman met me, and came forward. Like myself, she was led
by the hands of two old aboriginals, and then I saw she was
blind.</p>

<p>'My two conductors and the others met, and she lifted her
hand, apparently guided by some instinct unknown, and said, "Is
this the white man? The man of the race who did not exist when
our fathers did?"</p>

<p>'Then the old men spoke. "This is the man." And the woman
said, "I am going to tell him of a strange race who live here in
darkness. The story of those who became blind through the sins of
their fathers."</p>

<p>'I naturally stood waiting to hear what was the result of this
strange promised revelation, which, owing to the singular
surroundings, and the effects of my fall, impressed me more than
if I were in a normal state to hear it.</p>

<p>'"Man, I cannot see you, and I never knew your race, but you
are living; while we are dead&mdash;dead as a nation. We belong
to a past that you never knew of, and I, one of the of the Royal
race, am able to tell you about them, because you are the nation
which carries on a story such as ours."</p>

<p>'I could only stand and listen, supported by my two old men.
Then the woman began in a loud voice: "I am blind!" and
immediately a chorus arose from the surrounding space, "We are
blind!"</p>

<p>'By this time I began to comprehend what had happened to me,
and that I was there to listen to a tale that man had not heard
before. I therefore stood and quietly noted what the people about
me were doing. The four blackfellows were the usual type of our
own aboriginals. But the dim forms that I saw crowding
around&mdash;I could not tell of what nation or country they
were.</p>

<p>'The stern-faced woman seemed to be chosen as speaker, and she
commenced as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>'"White man!&mdash;for those who have helped me to bring you
here tell me that that's what you are called&mdash;I have to
relate to you the history of the people who dwell here in
darkness and blindness, and the great sin that led 'to our
punishment. Our kings are dead and gone, our story is unknown,
but at one time&mdash;so long ago as I can scarcely tell
you&mdash;we were the race that formed the glorious nation that
held the southern seas in subjection."</p>

<p>'I must say here that I fully understood what she was
speaking, though not what language it was.</p>

<p>'"I have said that we were the race that owned the southern
seas. Our fleets went to a great continent across the ocean to
take tribute from them; people who worshipped the sun; people
who held human sacrifices that we never held. We swept their
coast; and made their proudest kings pay homage to us, and yet we
were only a nation living in a few lonely islets, while they were
great in a land of towering mountains.</p>

<p>'"Then came the time when we got islands and lands nearer
home, and made those who lived thereon serfs and slaves, and the
fleets of our people ravaged greater lands. So came our fall, and
vengeance came upon us. Now we are blind."</p>

<p>'Came the answer from the shadows, "We are blind!"</p>

<p><br>
'"OUR story," continued the woman, "has been handed down to
us in a direct line, and I am the last to receive it, and now
there will be no one else, for I am also the last of the Royal
race entitled to hear and repeat it. This is why, O white man!
you have been brought here to listen to it; that the name and
glory of our nation should not disappear from the world for ever.
For we are blind, and cannot write it down."</p>

<p>'Again came the answer from the shadows, "Yes; we are
blind!"</p>

<p>'"Listen, then," continued the ancient woman of the unknown
past. "Our people possessed strange arts and sciences unknown to
you of the present&mdash;arts that I still know enough of to have
been able to bring you back to life, and cause you to understand
what I say. Sciences that enabled us to raise palaces of mighty
stones by means you little dream of, to build our waterways far
out amongst the coral, and overcome the nations of the
surrounding lands with ease.</p>

<p>'"Power and cruelty were what ruined us&mdash;not either gold
or lust of riches.</p>

<p>'"I told you that I still possess some of the arts that once
made us so powerful, and thus I know some of the countries of
which I shall speak, although I sit, blind, in the darkness of an
underground cavern.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
(<i>I may here say that in repeating the history that I then
heard, I have put into the woman's mouth the modern names of the
countries she refers to, in order to make her tale intelligible,
although, of course, she did not actually use the terms.
&mdash;Note by Lafont.)</i></p>

<p><br>
'"IN the beginning of our glory we dwelt on islands; beautiful
islands, whereon always burned the great earth fires. One,
whereon our great King dwelt, was called Acithema (Tahiti), where
was a beautiful circular valley on the crest of a mountain. Here
his palace was built, and to Acithema, at certain times of the
year, came his chiefs in their ships from the lesser islands
whereon they dwelt.</p>

<p>'"One time the chiefs came, and the face of the country was
changed, and over all the land was blackness and desolation. The
beautiful valley wherein the King's palace was built was a
burning, steaming lake of lava; all had gone save a few wandering
inhabitants, who had escaped the earth fires. Then the chiefs
held council, and swore that they would unite and follow round
the earth fires, conquering as they went, and at every place
where they came to they would cast their prisoners into the
craters of the volcanoes, to follow the great King.</p>

<p>'"Then, aided by the secret arts I told you of, they pursued
their path of cruelty from island to island, conquering as they
went, and taking toll of prisoners to follow the great King to a
fiery death. At last their fleets reached a great land, called by
the people Aliquipacho (New Guinea).</p>

<p>'"Here they were first foiled, for though the volcanoes were
there, the land was a desert. They searched its coast, but found
no one, and they had to sail away with their tale of vengeance
unslaked. Then they came to a land called Moata (Java), and here
they found a rich and powerful race, who fought desperately, and
it was long before they could subdue them. But they did
eventually, and then some of the chiefs said, 'We have wandered
enough; here we will sit down and settle, and when a hundred
years have passed our grandchildren's children can carry on the
war of vengeance and the sacrifice to the volcanic fires.' So
they agreed to this, and lived in the cities of the conquered
people, and made them slaves.</p>

<p>'"So a hundred years went on, and then terrible outbreaks of
fire occurred, and many cities were destroyed by them; and the
descendants of those who had been such great conquerors decided
that it was a warning to them to depart on another mission of
terror; so they manned their ships and left. First they sailed
north, and on a large island called Oktabar (Borneo) they looked
in vain for any people or cities, nor was there any sign of
volcanic outbreak. So they went north again, and came to some
islands, Laguasson (The Philippines), and there the fires were
rending the earth but there also there were no people, save some
black dwarfs. Many of these they caught and sacrificed.</p>

<p>'They sailed south, and passing through many dangerous
straits, reached this great land on which we now are. They found
here a race of people of a light color, who had walled towns and
fought amongst themselves. Therefore, they were good warriors,
and my people could not, with all their arts, conquer them. They,
therefore, held a parley, and, if they went in peace, these
people said they would allow them to pass to the south, where
they would find the great fires they seemed in search of. So they
left their ships, and journeyed south, and found the volcanic
fires raging, and settled down and built towns, and overran the
country in time. Then, when they were strong enough, after
hundreds of years had passed, they turned on the people of the
land, with whom they had lived in friendship, and killed and
enslaved them, casting them again into the craters of the
volcanoes.</p>

<p>'"This, oh! white man! was the great sin that brought down on
us the punishment the poor remnant of us have suffered from
since.</p>

<p>'"For, though years passed, and we had subjected all the
native people, and had glorious cities, now under the sea, and
ships that sailed far away, our punishment was only awaiting
us...</p>

<p>'"It came at last when, in our arrogance and pride, my
ancestors doomed hundreds of the unfortunate slaves to go to the
great fires that then burnt nearly everywhere. That night there
were signs and tokens that something was about to happen.
Something strange and awful.</p>

<p>'"The tremor of the earthquake ran through the land. The seas
moaned and sobbed as though in pain. The volcanoes lighted up the
night with their fires; and in all the cities the people waited
and watched.</p>

<p>'"And at last came blackness and darkness that even the sun
could not penetrate or pierce. The earth rocked throughout and
the cities fell in ruins on the terrified inhabitants. Then came
the fain of fire and ashes from heaven and completed the
destruction, and the sea rose in anger and overwhelmed nearly
half this great land. For days there was thick darkness, and when
it lifted all our great nation had vanished save only a few
trembling survivors. Our cities were buried either deep beneath
the fire-dust, or where the sea had made fresh bays and gulfs and
covered them.</p>

<p>'"Thus perished for ever the glory of the great nation of the
south; for not only was the destruction of our towns complete,
but the awful wrath of the powers that punished us prevented the
poor survivors ever taking heart again. They took to living in
caves and caverns in darkness underground, and wherever, they
felt safe from the destroying fires they had so often fed with
the bodies of their victims. Even when the earth became quiet,
and the mountains ceased to flash and thunder, they only stole
out fearfully to get what scanty food they could.</p>

<p>'"Amongst those who survived were some of the Royal race, who
retained their knowledge of some of those arts now lost to the
world. This they determined to transmit to their descendants,
together with the history of our people's greatness, their crimes
and punishments, in the hope that at some future time we should
arise again.</p>

<p>'"But that time has never come, and now it never can, for from
our life, led in darkness and beneath the earth, we are now all
blind, and few indeed are left.</p>

<p>'"Before the final punishment of blindness smote us, another
race sprang lip on the new land that replaced the old one we had
inhabited&mdash;a poor race of black-skinned people, well-nigh as
miserable as ourselves. But they were kind to us in their way,
and as we gradually grew blind they fed and looked after us. And
now that we have dwindled down to this scanty handful here in
this great cavity in the earth, they keep the secret of our
existence from the white race who have usurped the land. But we
are dying fast, and before my time came I wanted to tell one of
the race the wonderful history of our grandeur and war
disappearance.</p>

<p>'"Now, white man, I will show you something more. She ceased,
and one of the blacks, taking my hand, led me forward. The gleams
of fire that illumined the place had died down, and only a dull
glow remained.</p>

<p>'"Look! Look! and you shall see the great city that once stood
close to this place." Thus the woman spoke, and I looked, and a
wonderful vision appeared. I saw a plain, smiling and covered
with verdure, and a beautiful and lofty gateway leading through a
massive wall. Beyond rose domes and pinnacled roofs, and at the
gate stood tall men, armed, like soldiers on guard. I looked in
astonishment and admiration, the vision, or whatever it was,
faded and vanished.</p>

<p>'"Look again, white man."</p>

<p>'Another picture came into view. It was evidently inside the
city, and showed a wide street, and on either side lofty and well
built houses with flat roofs. Chariot-like carriages were in the
street moving without visible traction power. The street was
busy, all the people being tall, dark, and dignified in
appearance. To the left some building was in course of
progression. The blocks were huge, and the workmen, who were
evidently the light-colored race the woman had spoken of, seemed
only preparing the stone. When it had to be put in position one
of their dark masters approached. He had but to lift his hand
above the stone, and the block followed his movements wherever
he wished. No wonder it took the volcanic fires of mother earth
to destroy these people, possessed with such terrible knowledge.
The picture faded out, and once more the voice told me to
look.</p>

<p>This time a lovely and exquisite palace came in sight, built
on row after row of steps, flanked our either hand by colossal
figures. I cannot describe the architecture, but it was such as I
have never seen before. This, too, faded in the darkness, and I
spoke for the first time, wondering if I should be
understood.</p>

<p>'"Did you say that this city stood at the place where I was
found?"'</p>

<p>'"Yes," said the woman; "and it is there still, but buried far
beneath the earth."</p>

<p>It was dark now, and I only heard the distant wailing, and the
sound of falling water somewhere.</p>

<p>'"It is time to go,' said the woman's voice. 'Those from the
upper world must not tarry long with, the blind moles of the
under-earth. You will take with you the remembrance of our
history. Same day, though not in the same way, it may be the fate
of your own proud nation."</p>

<p>The lights glimmered again; two old blacks took me by the
hands and led me through dark passages until we emerged into the
glory of noonday.</p>

<p>I determined to make my way home on foot, as I felt strong
enough to do so, and thought I should probably meet someone on
the road tracking me up.</p>

<p>Strange, I found when I started that I was naked, and sunburnt
all over, and that my feet were horny, and it did not hurt me at
all to walk barefooted. The blacks went with me part of the way,
and then they left me; and I went on alone, making straight for
the station. I must have gone some five miles when I heard a
shout, and saw my cousin Falke galloping madly towards me. He
threw himself off his horse, and seemed to go nearly mad with
joy.</p>

<p>'How did you get away from them?' he kept asking me.</p>

<p>'Get away from whom?'</p>

<p>'The blacks. We gave you up for dead. Surely you must have
been with the blacks all this time?'</p>

<p>'All this time?' I repeated.</p>

<p>'Six months, at any rate.'</p>

<p>I looked at my cousin, and mechanically put my hand up in
astonishment.</p>

<p>'Six months! About forty-eight hours.'</p>

<p>'I see you got a harder crack then we thought. However, we'll
set you right now. Jump on my horse, and I'll walk.'</p>

<p>I did so almost mechanically, and afterwards, when we had
reached the station, and I had rested, I told my story.</p>

<p>'We certainly saw some such woman as you describe, but we
might have been mistaken. One can easily be when the blacks are
in question. However, you have assuredly been doing Rip Van
Winkle for six months, old man.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Sherwin; 'you must have got a harder knock than we
thought; but thank God it's all right.'</p>

<p>Perhaps it was; but was I wandering crazy with the blacks for
six months, or did I really hear about prehistoric Australia and
the forgotten nation which once ruled the Pacific?</p>

<p class="first">
THE races were on at Bungleton, and the town was full of
undesirable and desirable strangers. The desirable ones came to
spend money, the undesirable ones came to try to make some, and,
as they were not particular in their methods, they were not
enthusiastically welcomed by the residents. Amongst them was Mr.
Conway Delawbon, who by his name should have been included
amongst the desirable ones, but of whom the landlord of the inn
he patronised felt doubtful.</p>

<p>In the first place if Mr. Conway Delawbon was the swell he
represented himself to be, why did lie not stay at the swell
hotel, and if he was a spieler, why did he not stop amongst that
fraternity? His own house was only frequented by bushies, amongst
whom a detected spieler would have stood little chance, and they
consequently gave it a wide berth. Mr. Delawbon, however, did not
attempt any little tricks, but made himself rather popular with
the stockmen, boundary riders, and drovers who patronised the
Golden Harp.</p>

<p>The second day of the races saw everybody out on the course,
and the township was a town of dead marines. The sport, was
exciting, and when the ladies race was won by the barmaid of the
Golden Harp, the public-house mentioned above, the joy of the
patrons of that hostelry was loud and deep. Mr. Delawbon, who had
made himself very agreeable to pretty Maggie, was as excited as
anybody, and shouted as enthusiastically as anybody. Then he
slipped quietly and quickly away, and cut across the bush to the
township.</p>

<p>Another man was before him, and they met in the yard of the
hotel.</p>

<p>'It's our horse right enough,' said Conway; 'but when the
devil he got up here I can't make put.'</p>

<p>'Who owns him, or claims to own him now?'</p>

<p>'Deeling, who has the station just across the river. I've
sounded all the fellows at the hotel, but they know nothing
beyond the fact that Deeling has him in charge for some young
fellow or other.'</p>

<p>'And they only entered him for that ladies' race; they are
either a lot of chumps or they know all about him.'</p>

<p>'Looks like it, but there must be some amongst them who know
all about him. That girl could scarcely hold him. If she hadn't
been a first-class rider, they would have noticed how she pulled
him.'</p>

<p>'Bet you two to one she knows. She's our mark. You'll to have
to make the running there.'</p>

<p>'I'll try, but Miss Maggie knows a thing or two, and just now
she can pick and choose.'</p>

<p>'Here are the jolterheads coming back again; well we must
settle something. Pity we can't bluff Deeling with a
warrant.'</p>

<p>'No chance; what have we got to show in the matter? It's all
that confounded brother of mine. I should like to get hold of him
for five minutes, the young wretch to go back on us like
that.'</p>

<p>'Well, we have not come this far to go back empty-handed, if
we have to steal him again.'</p>

<p>The two men parted without more words, and Delawbon, as he
called himself, went back to the house.</p>

<p><br>
THAT evening when Maggie was off for an hour or two she
slipped out and went to the small hospital standing on the
outskirts of the town. She went up to the ward wherein were but
two inmates, an old man and a young one. The youngster had
evidently broken his leg by the way the bedclothes were arranged
over it on a cradle.</p>

<p>Maggie went up and greeted him.</p>

<p>'Did you win?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Of course, but he nearly bolted with me.'</p>

<p>'It was risky of Deeling to run him, but I couldn't tell him
the real reason I didn't want him run.'</p>

<p>'It's my fault, said the girl; 'I persuaded him. I wanted to
win the race. But I think there's someone after the house.
There's a fellow stopping at our place whom we can't make out at
all. He calls himself Delawbon, but that's not his same. He's not
a 'tec, and I can't put a name to him.'</p>

<p>'What makes you think he's after the horse?'</p>

<p>'The way he looked at him when I came in, and he took the
opportunity of coming up and speaking to me when I was going to
start, and I'm certain he knew the horse.'</p>

<p>'Good heaven! It's not my brother?'</p>

<p>'Is your brother like you?'</p>

<p>'No, not a bit. He'd kill me if he found me.'</p>

<p>'Well, Jimmy, there's only one thing to do. I must find out
all about this man, and if he is your brother, after you and the
horse, I must clear out and meet you somewhere else.'</p>

<p>'But you'd be followed and known anywhere.'</p>

<p>'Not I. It won't be the first time I've ridden in boy's
clothes, and, as for Darkie, I'd take him us a pack-horse,
looking like a regular old moke.'</p>

<p>'Confound this broken, leg. If it wasn't for that I'd have
been out of this long ago.'</p>

<p>'Well, good-bye. I must be back at once,' said Maggie, as she
departed.</p>

<p><br>
SIX months before the young fellow had come there, looking for
work, and obtained it on Deeling's station. A month afterwards,
hearing that the Golden Harp wanted a barmaid, he had told the
landlord that his sister wanted a billet, had written to her, and
she had come up and taken the place.</p>

<p>The young fellow, who called himself O'Reilly, had two horses
with him when he arrived, one of them the horse that had that day
won the little race. While laid up with his broken leg, his
ostensible sister had persuaded Deeling to lend her Darkie for
the race, and, seeing that he thought it was her brother's home,
he did not like to refuse.</p>

<p>That evening Maggie was in the bar, when she overheard a
conversation between the man she suspected and one of the men
working on Deeling's station. They were talking of the
horse.</p>

<p>'So, he belongs to this young O'Reilly. Where is he?'</p>

<p>'In the hospital, with a broken leg.'</p>

<p>'What's he like; perhaps I know him?'</p>

<p>The man described him tolerably well, and Maggie saw the scowl
on the other's face, which he could not repress. It was the
brother evidently, and Jimmy had often told her of his dread of
this brother ever finding him. She knew some of the rights of the
case, but not all; she knew, however, that the horse in question
was a valuable stolen racer, but that was enough.</p>

<p>Maggie's morality was nowhere, but her loyalty was great, she
must act at once, to-morrow would be too late. She knew the
matron at the hospital, and could manage to get to see her
alleged brother that night, and get him to give her an order to
Deeling to take his horses and clothes. For the rest, she could
manage herself.</p>

<p>When Maggie did not turn up the next morning there was
consternation, and, when it was found that she had gone, the
usual expression of opinion was, whom had she gone with? She had
gone over to Deeling's late at night, had obtained her brother's
horses and things, and vanished. Opinion veered to the conclusion
that Maggie had played very low down on her brother, and cleared
oft with somebody, and his horses, while he was down on his back.
But, although the girl would not have felt at all shocked at
these aspersions on her character, they were not true, and she
had carried out the programme she had hastily sketched out
alone.</p>

<p>The effect on Delawbon was crushing, and he could do nothing,
except by moving in the matter he would probably get five years'
penal servitude. He could not follow Maggie, for, born and bred
in the bush, she had kept off the road. She knew as well as any
man how to strap down a wire fence and get a horse over it, and
she left no sign as to which way she lad departed. His only
course was to keep an eye on his brother, who, as he guessed, had
a place appointed to meet Maggie. He could not, unfortunately, as
he thought, go into the hospital and half kill him.</p>

<p><br>
TWO years before a valuable racing colt had been stolen from a
station, in New South Wales, and its body was found afterwards
with the brands cut out of the side, and otherwise disfigured.
That is to say, some people swore it was the colt, some swore it
was not. It was not, the colt being then in the possession of the
three men who had stolen the horse.</p>

<p>Then the younger brother stole it from his brother and mate,
and they had vainly looked far him since, until, at the race
meeting at Bungleton, they had come on the horse, only to lose it
again.</p>

<p><br>
IT was some two months afterwards, and Maggie, who had managed
her escape with the cleverness of an old hand, had taken service
at a rather thriving roadside pub, and the horses were safely in
a neighboring paddock, when she received a letter from Jim,
informing her that he would join her the next week. On the day
appointed two men arrived, and road up to the house, and Maggie's
heart leaped as she recognised in one the brother whom Jim so
dreaded, riding amicably with him. She felt somehow that her
recreant lover had betrayed her to save his own skin.</p>

<p>And so it had proved. Jim had thrown all the blame on her,
and, under threats, had confessed the place where she was in
hiding with the horses. Maggie took it quietly enough, the horses
were run up from the paddock, and put in the yard. She did not
utter a word of reproach to the young cur for whom she had worked
so loyally, but simply said:</p>

<p>'I want to go down by myself and say good-bye to Darkie. I
have got very fond of him since we have been so long
together.'</p>

<p>She went into the bar, and took something out of the drawer,
then went out to the yard. The two men did not follow her, but
sat down to the meal they had ordered. They were in the middle of
it, when they were startled by a shot outside. Hastening out to
see what was the matter, they met Maggie walking back to the
house, a revolver in her hand. In the yard lay poor Darkie, the
capital of the two thieves, bow worth nothing. Maggie had shot
him fair and square through the brain.</p>

<p>'You daren't do anything,' she said, coolly, 'or you will get
into quod. Besides, so far as I know, he was my horse. I have
kept that order you gave me for Deeling; I gave him a receipt for
it.'</p>

<p>Maggie is now the mistress of the thriving roadside pub, the
owner, a widower, having lately married her.</p>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>28. -- SUNDERED PATHS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 9 July 1898</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was a remote and somewhat lonely, suburb on the outskirts
of Sydney. At one time there had evidently been a short-lived
land boom in the locality, and the signs thereof still remained
in the shape of surveyors' pegs and trenches, indicating where
streets intersected, the said streets, as a rule, ending abruptly
nowhere, after a brief career of a hundred yards. A few houses
had been built here and there, but the boom tide had apparently
not been taken at the flood, or the locality not been popular,
for the habitations were few and far between, and the majority of
the choice building sites' were covered with the low scrub and
heathery bushes common in the neighborhood of Sydney. The roads
and pathways were unmade, neglected and unlighted at night. Some
telegraph wires certainly stretched along what presumed to be the
main street, connecting other and more favored localities, but
telegraph posts do not add greatly to the cheerful outlook of any
landscape, and on a grey day, when a blustering wind is blowing,
their wires sing a melancholy song of their own which is not
inspiriting.</p>

<p>Traffic here was small. A few tradesmen's carts and the
suburban postman were about the only wayfarers; the latter, in
his semi-military uniform, looking like a mounted rifleman on
vedette duty, who had mislaid his offensive weapon. What houses
there were, were not built in neighborly vicinity, but scattered
abroad, and separated by empty areas of bush. The houses were
fairly good cottage residences, evidently not inhabited by a very
poor class of people. One, standing well back from the quiet
road, was distinguished by a well kept lawn and a garden gay with
flowers, and by its bright aspect seemed to enter a protest
against the monotony of its surroundings. It was tenanted by a
lady with a little boy about nine years of age; a middle-aged,
childless couple, who had the appearance of country people,
forming her domestic staff.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was not curious, nor very social, and calling
was a conventional custom more honored in the breach than the
observance, so that few but the tradespeople and the postman knew
that her name was Rutledge, and none could have told you whether
she was a widow or no. She seldom went out, had no visitors, and
had lived there nearly three years, a quiet retired life.</p>

<p><br>
ONE morning, about 11 o'clock, a gentleman above middle-age,
walked down the road leading to Mrs. Rutledge's house, looking
about him in an inquiring manner. The semi-military postman, with
the cavalry hat, met him, and in answer to a question indicated
the house referred to. The gentleman took his way there, entered
the gate and walked across the little lawn. His footsteps had not
been very audible, but his approach must have been noticed, for
the mistress of the house stepped through the French light on to
the verandah to meet him. They greeted each other like old
friends, by their Christian names, and each looked curiously at
the other, as though they had not met for some time and were
seeking alterations in each other's appearance.</p>

<p>'You are looking extremely well, Frances,' he said, when
seated inside.</p>

<p>'And you have not altered.'</p>

<p>'As well preserved as ever, you should say,' he interrupted,
with a smile. 'But I don't know how long I should remain so in
the calm stagnation of this locality. It suits you,
evidently.'</p>

<p>'Yes, just at present it does; but I must move soon, for
Herbert is growing fast, and must attend another school than his
mother's.'</p>

<p>'Don't keep him too long at home, or it will be harder for the
boy when he has to go.'</p>

<p>'I won't make a milksop of him, but you will see him directly
yourself. Meantime, where have you been these years?'</p>

<p>'Doing the Wandering Jew business, as usual, you know, I can't
rest.'</p>

<p>'Have you seen Ralph at all?' she asked in a quiet, even tone
although she was speaking of her long absent husband.</p>

<p>'Yes. Do you correspond?'</p>

<p>'Not now. He took offence at some remarks of mine; intended
for his good.'</p>

<p>'Doubtless!' interrupted her visitor, softly, with a
smile.</p>

<p>'And replied that he would rather not hear from me, than be
lectured on a subject on which we could never agree.'</p>

<p>'Well, that was reasonable enough; could you not write to each
other without touching on the forbidden subject?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge was a handsome, refined-looking woman, of thirty
years or so, with a still girlish appearance and figure, but her
mouth tightened, I and her eyes turned hard as she replied.</p>

<p>'No. I know what is my duty, and I will perform it; no matter
what I suffer in the performance.'</p>

<p>'Or make others suffer. Really, Frances, I came out
here&mdash;and you know my selfish disposition, which, as a rule,
refrains from meddling with other people's troubles&mdash;hoping
that I would find you in another mood; it seems perfect insanity
that two people should have their lives ruined for a sentimental
idea.'</p>

<p>'No, Herbert; I am still the same. I love Ralph still, as well
as ever, but my duty is plain and straightforward. Why did he let
me remain in ignorance of the iniquitous trade he was engaged in?
Why did he ever marry me without telling me that he was a
slave-dealer?'</p>

<p>Herbert Rutledge got up from his chair in irritation, but his
voice was quiet when he spoke.</p>

<p>'Knowing, as you do, my personal sentiments on the subject of
marriage, I agree with you that it would have been for the
happiness of both of you if my brother had told you that he owned
some vessels engaged in the island trade, but I know that your
remarks are inspired by that old humbug&mdash;excuse me&mdash;who
first caused the trouble. But this mad exaggeration is too bad!
My brother's vessels were engaged in a properly supervised and
legitimate labor trade; and to speak of him as though he was
running slavers to Cuba, as in the old times, from West Africa,
shows how much your mind has been warped.'</p>

<p>'My mind is not warped, and Mr. Stammers was quite right, and
doing his plain duty when he informed me of the horrors of that
awful traffic in human souls and bodies; and lent me books
containing accounts of the atrocities perpetrated by these
engaged in that sinful calling. Then I learnt for the first time
that my husband, with whom I had been so happy, was one of those
monsters. Do you wonder that I insisted on a separation until he
led a new life?'</p>

<p>'And do you wonder that a man of my brother's disposition
should refuse to listen to such folly and feel indignant that his
wife should allow a canting old hypocrite to come between them
with a tissue of sensational trash.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Stammers was my father's old and dear friend, and you
know he does not deserve the epithet you have just bestowed on
him. He is a good man, and you know it.'</p>

<p>'I don't know it. Good men, really good men, don't destroy the
happiness of others. Professing good men do very often. But I
came out here to see you and my nephew, not to quarrel. Is the
boy in?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I will go for him; but I do not expect that he will
remember you at once; memory is not long lived at his age.'</p>

<p>She left the room, and her brother-in-law stood contemplating
the surroundings with a frown on his generally good-natured face.
Suddenly it cleared, and he emitted a slight chuckle, which he
stifled as the door opened, and his nephew, a bright,
healthy-looking lad, came in. He soon recalled himself to the
boy's memory, and when they parted after lunch they were firm
friends.</p>

<p>'When do you go away?' Mrs. Rutledge asked.</p>

<p>'Almost immediately; but I will come out and say good-bye. I
am going down to the islands to see Ralph&mdash;better let me
take Herbert with me for a holiday; I'll bring him back myself.'
The woman started, and looked at him with a changing face.</p>

<p>'His father has a right to see him,' he continued; 'and he has
no vessels engaged in the recruiting business now; so you will
not be departing from your principles.'</p>

<p>'Has he seen the right, then?' she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>'Not as you mean; but there is business that pays better.
Shall I take the boy for a trip?'</p>

<p>'I don't know; I can't answer you suddenly. I will consider. I
will strive to do my duty. Goodbye.'</p>

<p>'How on earth are you to convince a woman of her disposition?'
mused Rutledge as he strolled towards the railway station.
'Brought up in a narrow-minded school, she suddenly finds that
some of her husband's vessels have been chartered to recruit
South Sea labor, under the supervision of the Queensland
Government. An interfering old fool, a friend of her sainted
parents, gives her a. whole lot of sensational newspaper cuttings
to read, and she rounds on her husband, one of the best and
kindest-hearted fellows going, and accuses him of being a
murderous slave-dealer, won't listen to reason; and insists upon
a separation as long as his hands are red with the blood of the
slave! He's too hot-tempered to stand it, and hence all the
trouble. I'm glad it struck me to suggest the boy taking a
trip&mdash;it will patch things up, perhaps. I thank my lucky
stars that I am a bachelor!'</p>

<p>Herbert Rutledge wound up his reflections on the little
station platform, and sat down to await the train with a good
conscience.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
IN her now very lonely cottage home sat Mrs. Rutledge some
weeks after the visit of her brother-in-law. Acting always, as
she persuaded herself, under a strong sense of duty, she had
consented to her son accompanying his uncle to the islands, to
see the father who was almost a stranger to him. The fact that
parting with the boy had been a severe pang to her was, in her
mind, a proof that it was the right thing to have done. But how
weary had been the time ever since. Somehow, in her great
loneliness, the past bore a different aspect. After ail had she
been right to refuse to listen to argument or reason? To trust
only the words of those who were prejudiced, and practically
ignorant? She recalled to mind a peculiarly murderous piece of
literature that her father's friend had recommended to her
notice&mdash;an account of the massacres that had taken place on
the notorious '<i>Carl</i>.' Could her husband possibly be one of
those blood-stained fiends? No; her heart cried out against the
idea. There were bad brutal men in all occupations, but that did
not brand them all as her venerable friend inferred. She
remembered, and with her strict training the idea was horrible to
her mind, that there were bad clergymen who had been cast out of
the Church, but this did not contaminate the rest of the clergy.
In her brooding loneliness, these trite and childish kind of
arguments appealed to her, and she wondered she had not thought
of them before.</p>

<p>For the first time the words of the esteemed Mr. Stammers
seemed weak and commonplace. What a simple woman she must have
been to have received them as unassailable facts!</p>

<p>The click of the latch of the garden gate aroused her from her
moody musings. She went to the door and took the morning paper
from the boy. Since her son's departure she always turned to the
shipping news first. There was nothing there of the
<i>Vesuvius</i>, the steamer in which the voyagers had departed,
but a wire from Auckland presently caught her eye.</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
The <i>Clansman</i> reports that when she left Suva, news of a
hurricane had just been received from Levuka. No details were to
hand, but the island trader Vesuvius was overdue.</p>

<br>

<p>That was all; but it was enough to excite all a mother's
fears. She sent the man in to Sydney at once to scan the notices
on the Post Office boards, and to await the issue of the evening
papers. But he came back with no fresh news. Only the same
paragraph repeated, with an addition that the mail steamer due in
Auckland in two days would probably bring fuller tidings.</p>

<p>Two days. Two long, weary days. How would she ever live
through them? But they crept on somehow, and she opened the paper
one morning and read her fate. It was plain enough; for, like
most tidings of wreck and disaster, it was headed with large
cross headings.</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">GREAT STORM IN THE ISLANDS, NUMEROUS WRECKS</p>

<p class="headline">THE 'VESUVIUS' DRIVEN ASHORE ON OVALAU</p>

<p class="headline">LOSS OF LIFE</p>

<p><br>
Then followed the names of others, trading schooners. But her
dry eyes passed them over till they came to the details. The
<i>Vesuvius</i> had gone ashore when making Levuka. By great and
heroic exertions of those ashore communication had been
established; but many had been drowned in the surf. A full list
of those saved was not obtainable, but most people would learn
with regret that, amongst the rescuers, Mr. R. Rutledge, the
well-known island merchant, while attempting to rescue a boy from
the surf, had received fatal injuries. The steamer
<i>Glamorgan</i> was expected to call in a few days, and would
probably bring the survivors on to Sydney direct.</p>

<p>So, the blow had fallen. No chance now to forget and forgive.
Even if she had sent a message by Herbert it would not have
reached her husband. He was dead; and, perhaps, it was his own
boy whom he was unknowingly striving to rescue when he met with
his death. And the boy!</p>

<p>The miserable paper could not say whether the boy had been
saved or not. She did not even know for certain whether she was a
childless widow or not; and at the picture fancy conjured up, of
the childish figure beaten on the black rocks by the wild surf,
she sank, down and lost consciousness for a time. She was aroused
by a voice speaking to her; and opening her eyes saw her father's
old friend, Mr. Stammers, standing before her.</p>

<p>Sitting down, the well-meaning but foolish old man commenced
the usual orthodox string of consolatory platitudes. Mrs.
Rutledge listened in silence till the good man, having exhausted
his stock of conventional sayings, unwisely remarked that if his
advice had been followed Herbert would not have been allowed to
visit the islands, and she would not now be bewailing his
loss.</p>

<p>Never had the complacent Mr. Stammers roused a wild cat with
his utterances before. Mrs. Rutledge arose in her wrath,
wild-eyed and terrible in her indignation.</p>

<p>'Your advice! Your advice! Only for your advice I should now
have husband and son both, and should never have been parted from
them. Only for your advice he would not have died far away from
me, with never a good-bye between us. Only for your advice I
should now be a happy wife, instead of a wretched widow. Leave
me, old man, before I say more; for my eyes have been opened by
misfortune. Go, and never during your remaining years seek to
part husband and wife.'</p>

<p>He was gone, without a word, conscience-struck and astonished,
but the storm of aroused passion had done her good, and given her
back her self-control. She had nothing to do but await the
arrival of the <i>Glamorgan</i>.'</p>

<p>Another day and another, and it was growing dusk and dark,
when she lit the gas, and called to the man who had been in
Sydney, watching for the <i>Glamorgan</i> to be signalled. He had
no news, and she sat down and ate her sad and solitary meal.
After dinner she tried to read, but her eyes would wander; and
she saw only the drowned faces of her husband and her boy. The
door opened, and with a start she aroused herself, and saw
Herbert, her brother-in-law, enter.</p>

<p>'You have come back!' she said, as she sprang up. 'And alone!
You have come back to me without my child.'</p>

<p>'Herbert is safe. He has not quite recovered, and I left him
in Sydney, rather than fatigue him further to-night by bringing
him on here.'</p>

<p>'O, I must go to him at once; I believed him dead.'</p>

<p>'Stay!' said Herbert, with a ring of sternness in his tones.
'Have you no more questions to ask?'</p>

<p>She clasped her hands, and looked beseechingly at him; but he
made her ask the question.</p>

<p>'My husband?' she said, at last, with trembling lips.</p>

<p>'Saved the boy's life when Herbert and I were washed off the
line in the surf. There was some brave work done that day by both
whites and blacks, but his was the bravest.'</p>

<p>'Dead,' she whispered, 'and he will never know how I longed
for him. Were you with him when he died?'</p>

<p>'He was not dead when I left the island.'</p>

<p>'And you left him to die alone&mdash;the brother you so
upheld? I must go directly, if I have to charter a steamer; I may
not yet be too late. Let me pass, Herbert. Why do you stand
before the door?'</p>

<p>'You need not go so far to find him. I did not leave him. He
was badly hurt, it is true, but I brought him with me. He has
heard from your own lips what he wanted to hear, and what you can
now tell him.'</p>

<p>Herbert opened the half-closed door, and as he passed out the
listener at the door passed in.</p>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 3, 10 and 24 Jun 1899</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
'TAKE me out and bury me deep,' said Newton as he dropped an
open letter on the table and assumed a look of despair.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' asked Mullins, a jackeroo of nearly
eighteen months experience, looking up from his letters; for the
mailman had just left the bag at Cramby Downs cattle station.</p>

<p>'Matter!' returned the afflicted manager. 'Only old Bonwick is
coming up here to stop a month, and is bringing his two daughters
up with him.'</p>

<p>Mullins, who considered himself a full-fledged bushman on
account of the eighteen months' experience, stroked his budding
moustache and simpered as he answered, 'Rather a pleasant break,
old man?'</p>

<p>'Rather a pleasant break!' echoed Newton in a rage. 'We
haven't an unbroken chair to sit down on, thanks to you and the
Behemoth, skylarking all through the muster, the table is
rickety, there's nothing in the store but tea, sugar, and flour,
the kerosene is done, and we'll have to make fat lamps, and, to
wind up, I've told Ah Foy to clear at the end of the month, so we
won't even have a cook unless you turn to. Pleasant break,
indeed!' and Newton snorted wrath at the Jackeroo, who sat
appalled, with his mouth open.</p>

<p>'Don't sit there catching flies,' went on Newton; 'think of
something, can't you. They'll be here in a fortnight. They're on
the sea now.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps they'll be wrecked,' muttered the wretched Mullins,
for the verbal assault had knocked all sense out of him.</p>

<p>'I'll wreck you, you thundering ass, in a moment Somebody will
have to go down to Portshore with the buggy to meet them at once.
Who is to go? I can't trust you, and I can't go myself.'</p>

<p>'Bring up some rations in the buggy,' suggested Mullins,
feebly.</p>

<p>'Your intellect's rapidly failing. I shall have to send you
down in handcuffs if you don't look out. How much rations do you
imagine one could bring up in that crazy old buggy with four
people in it. Old Bonwick's a load in himself, and you bet the
girls are bouncers.'</p>

<p>'Walker!' suddenly exclaimed Mullins. Now instead of Newton
flaring out on hearing this apparently flippant remark, a look of
relief stole over his face.</p>

<p>'Right you are, the Behemoth will help us.'</p>

<p>'And so will Mrs. Walker,' said Mullins, much encouraged.
'I'll go over at once. Tell Paddy to get a horse up,' and glad of
the idea of putting his troubles on the back of a friend, Newton
turned to the rest of his correspondence.</p>

<p>Bonwick was the owner of the station&mdash;not that he had
ever seen it or knew anything about cattle. He was a city man,
who dabbled in station property, and being remarkably shrewd and
businesslike, generally did well. Cramby Downs came into his
hands cheap, and had paid pretty well, for those were the days
before the devastating tick marched through Queensland. But his
daughters wanted to travel, and a journey up to Queensland, and
to the station during the pleasant tropical winter, was a
desirable trip they had been told. Therefore it was that Newton
was so upset and had gone over to visit his near neighbor,
Walker, alias the 'Behemoth,' who owned the neighboring run, and
whose station was but ten miles away.</p>

<p>Walker was at home, and he and Mrs. Walker, a pretty young
woman who had not yet lost her complexion in the Queensland
climate, welcomed, him warmly.</p>

<p>'I'm in a heap of trouble, and you must give me a hand,' he
said, when he had had a drink and got into a chair. 'Old Bonwick
is coining up on a visit, bringing his two daughters with him,
and I've nothing in the store, and the place is not presentable,
we've only two rooms and a skillion; and your husband and Mullins
smashed what little furniture we have during muster time. The
girls are bound to be bouncers, and old Bonwick will worry the
soul out of me with his ignorance of station matters, and wanting
to interfere and advise and what with one thing and another, I
think I'm about tired.'</p>

<p>This was poured out in one long string to Mrs. Walker.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walker smiled sympathetically.</p>

<p>'What's a bouncer, Mr. Newton?' she asked, ignoring the rest
of the tirade.</p>

<p>'O, a great big fat girl, who'll give every horse on the place
a sore back.'</p>

<p>'I can relieve your mind on one score. I have met one of the
Miss Bonwicks, and she is not by my means a bouncer, according to
your definition at that term. She is a very pretty
girl&mdash;'</p>

<p>Here Newton groaned.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>'That fool Mullins will be getting spooney on her, and I shall
never get a bit of good out of him.'</p>

<p>'You must chance that. I don't think the girl I met will
encourage Mr. Mullins. She is remarkably clever and quiet.'</p>

<p>'A bluestocking. Does she wear specs?'</p>

<p>'No, she does not. Kindly don't interrupt me any more. Now how
can we help you? We'll do all we can.'</p>

<p>'In reality I don't know how you can help me. I came over for
suggestions; some proposal to save me from utter disgrace and
humiliation.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Walker laughed.</p>

<p>'Not quite so bad as that,' and the Behemoth grunted, 'Nothing
wrong; station in first rate order, couldn't find a fault. Only
awfully mean of you to say I smashed your old furniture; never
knew you had any before.'</p>

<p>'You know you did; you kept betting that donkey Mullins that
he couldn't lift you up sitting on a chair, and every time he
tried a leg was smashed. Now they're all bound up with green
hide, and a pretty sight they look for a drawing room.'</p>

<p>'Now, listen,' said Mrs. Walker. 'George will drive me over
to-morrow morning, and I will see what the capabilities of the
material are which we have got to deal with. You stop to dinner
and then ride back by moonlight, and meanwhile talk it over.'</p>

<p>'I must go back, Mrs. Walker. Mullins will be doing some
absurd thing under pretence of getting ready, which will
assuredly bring my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. I
shouldn't wonder if he was not now painting an emu and kangaroo
on my best roll of canvas with "Welcome" written between.'</p>

<p>'Ah Foy's a good, cook, that's one thing,' said Walter.</p>

<p>'But I've sacked Ah Foy at the end of this month, and where to
get another I don't know.'</p>

<p>'What did you sack Ah Foy for?' asked Mrs. Walker.</p>

<p>'Cheek,' returned Newton.</p>

<p>'That's all right, I'll make him apologise to you, and you can
take him back.'</p>

<p>Husband and wife here exchanged an amused smile. Restored to
hope and confidence, Newton ate a. hearty dinner, and, after a
smoke with the Behemoth, so called on account of his massive
size, was about to start home, when Mrs. Walker called him inside
the house, from the verandah. She showed him a photo&mdash;the
likeness of a girl not only pretty&mdash;but with, an unusually
frank and intelligent appearance. The girl did not appear to be.
sitting for her portrait, but as though it was a natural
attitude, and she had been caught unawares by the camera.</p>

<p>'That's the Miss Bonwick whom I met,' said Mrs. Walker. Newton
looked at the laughing eyes and the speaking mouth, and laid it
down with a sigh.</p>

<p>'And I called this girl a bouncer,' he said. 'Good night, Mrs.
Walker; I'm awfully obliged to you, and shall be delighted to see
you to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Newton rode home at peace with himself at having secured the
help and guidance of his friends, but down at heart at having
called the original of the photo, a bouncer.</p>

<p>Next morning early Mr. and Mrs. Walker drove up to the station
and the first thing Mrs. Walker did was to ask Newton if he had
missed anything of late.</p>

<p>'I haven't got much to lose,' he said, 'but the only thing
valuable I possess&mdash;a gold watch&mdash;has certainly
disappeared.'</p>

<p>'Send Ah Foy to me, and leave us alone for five minutes,'
returned Mrs. Walker.</p>

<p>Ah Foy came in, looking most abominably frightened, and
hastily letting his pigtail down.</p>

<p>'So you cannot resist watches even now?' said Mrs. Walker.
'Put, that one of Mr. Newton's back at once, and go and apologise
to him, quick, and ask him to take you back. Mr. Walker let you
off before, when you stole my watch, but only on condition that
you behaved in future. Now go.'</p>

<p>Ah Foy went, a very frightened Chinaman. He had hoped to be
well away with the stolen watch before Mr. or Mrs. Walker heard
of it; that was the reason he had checked Newton in order to get
the sack.</p>

<p>'Newton,' said Walker, taking his arm, and leading him up to
the stockyard while this scene was going on, 'I'll lend you my
big waggonette, and help you make up a team of four horses if you
go down and meet the old man and the girls. Meanwhile the wife
will straighten things up here. Mustering's over; there's nothing
to do, and you can start 'Blasphemous Ben' down with the dray for
some loading. That will get him out of the road, for you can hear
him swearing half-way to our place, and you can't cure him. Our
store is full, and I can lend you what you want until he comes
back.'</p>

<p>'By George! Behemoth, you are a good fellow, and I shall pull
through all right, but it's not fair to rush a couple of town
girls on a man without warning.'</p>

<p>So things were decided, and on returning they found that Mrs.
Walker had also decided favorably with regard to the house,
namely, that if Newton and Mullins rigged up bunks in the store
for themselves, and left the house to Bonwick and Co., everything
could be managed.</p>

<p>After lunch, the benefactors departed, promising to come over
the next day.</p>

<p>'Isn't she a brick?' said Mullins to Newton.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't call her a brick exactly,' returned Newton,
absently. 'She seems to me more of a dream picture than a
reality.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Mullins, 'I should never have thought of calling
Mrs. Walker a dream picture, and I am thankful to say, under
present circumstances, that she is very much of a reality, and a
very nice reality, too.'</p>

<p>'Oh! it was Mrs. Walker you meant?'</p>

<p>'Now, who else could it have been?'</p>

<p>But Newton did not answer.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
IN Walker's roomy waggonette, with Paddy the black boy
trotting behind, driving two spare horses, Newton felt tolerably
happy as he travelled down to Portshore. If a man's spirits are
not roused by holding the reins of two free, fresh horses, on a
Queensland winter morn, along a fairly good road, just bushy
enough to make you attend to your driving, then that man has no
spirits to rouse. Newton's spirits, at any rate, were high. The
honor of Cramby Downs would be saved, thanks to the energy and
knowledge of Mrs. Walker, and the friendliness of the
Behemoth.</p>

<p>Ah Foy had come humbly and repentantly to beg forgiveness, and
ask to be taken on again. It may be mentioned here that watches
are a source of temptation to which even the strongest minded
pagan is liable to succumb. He may be poor in pocket, but if he
is the proud possessor of three or four watches, he is, by
reputation, a rich man. Hence Ah Foy's fall.</p>

<p>'Blasphemous Ben,' who could go on for an hour, and never use
the same oath twice, would be out of the way, and the
incorrigible old ruffian, who was the best horse-driver in the
country, would not get back until the visitors had gone.</p>

<p>So Newton drove on gaily in the fresh morning air, and thought
but little of the two hundred and fifty miles that separated him
from Portshore. The country was fairly well settled, and most of
the stations were comfortably fixed up as regarded homesteads, so
the hardships of camping out were not to be apprehended for his
charges.</p>

<p>He arrived in Portshore the day before the steamer was due,
and secured rooms for the expected guests at the principal hotel.
The steamer duly arrived, and Newton took his place at the end of
the long jetty, the pride and glory of Portshore, to be ready to
board her at once. He knew Bonwick by sight, having met him once
in Sydney; but the prospect of meeting the original of the
photograph was far more interesting than the idea of rotund Mr.
Bonwick.</p>

<p>Slowly the steamer was warped up to the wharf, and when the
gangway was in position, Newton was one of the first on board. He
soon recognised and accosted the proprietor of the station, and
while talking to him two young damsels standing near attracted
his attention.</p>

<p>'Bouncers,' he said to himself, and they certainly were of the
type he designated by that term, and the thing was exaggerated by
their resemblance in height, features, and dress. He was casting
his eyes around in search of the 'dream picture,' when Bonwick
said, 'Oh, I must make you known to any daughters.'</p>

<p>Turning round to the two young ladies, he presented Newton to
them, saying:</p>

<p>'Girls, this is Mr. Newton, the manager of Cramby Downs.'</p>

<p>The two girls, who had good-tempered faces greeted Newton with
becoming warmth, while he, sick at heart, tried to conceal his
disappointment. What on earth did Mrs. Walker mean? Was it all a
cruel joke? He recovered himself as well as he could, and before
they got to the end of the jetty, he found himself chatting
freely and pally with the girls who, if they were bouncers, were
very kindly and unaffected ones. Bonwick had stayed behind them,
on the steamer, to transact some business, and when they reached
the end of the jetty, Newton looked round, and saw him following
with a lady.</p>

<p>'O, papa forgot to tell you,' said the eldest Miss Bonwick, as
she noticed the direction of his glance, 'our cousin came up with
us. It was only decided just at the last moment. She has not been
very well lately, and the doctor thought the trip would do her
good. I am afraid we shall put you out terribly, Mr. Newton.'</p>

<p>Newton made the necessary polite disclaimer, with a beating
heart, for something told him that this cousin would prove to be
the lady of the photograph, and it was; but she greeted Newton
with far less interest than her cousins had done, which was,
perhaps, but natural. The party proceeded to the hotel, and a
start was arranged for the following morning. In the course of
the evening, Newton did not manage to make much progress in his
acquaintanceship with the young lady of the photograph, who
appeared to be somewhat pensive and absent-minded. She was also a
Miss Bonwick, which accounted for Mrs. Walker's mistake. Her
Christian name was Jane, reduced to Jennie by her cousins, which
Newton thought was nothing less than desecration. The eldest of
the two bouncers, a name that Newton felt secretly ashamed of for
calling them, in his heart, was plain Mary; and her sister, a
year younger, was Grace. Thanks to these two, however, the
evening passed pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>Newton was up by daylight the next morning, and plunged once
more in the depths of despair. The accommodation of Walker's
wagonnette, stretched to its utmost extent, could not contain
with anything like comfort the three young ladies, Bonwick,
himself, and the luggage. He could certainly borrow a horse and
ride, but who then was to drive the four horses. Bonwick, he
knew, could not, and the four horses would have to go in. He was
dejectedly seeking comfort from the groom of the hotel on the
subject, when, to his intense astonishment. Miss Grace Bonwick,
the youngest bouncer, appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Mr. Newton. Horses are my hobby; and I came
down, early to see what sort of a team you have for the
trip.'</p>

<p>Fortunately, the team was a good one, and elicited Grace's
approval.</p>

<p>'I like driving four-in-hand,' she remarked; 'particularly
free horses.'</p>

<p>Newton was just going to exclaim, 'drive up to the station,'
when the young lady took the unspoken words out of his mouth, by
remarking, 'I am going to drive up, now I have seen, the
horses.'</p>

<p>'I will take you into my confidence, Miss Grace,' said Newton.
'I am in a bit of a fix how to settle things. With all the
luggage, none of which can be left behind&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Certainly not,' interrupted Grace.</p>

<p>'Well, with all that and ourselves, we shall be one too many
for comfort. If I thought it was quite safe, I would ride, and
let you drive.'</p>

<p>'Tell the groom to put the horses in, quick. Help him, Mr.
Newton; I'll show you whether I can drive, or not,' and the
youngest of the bouncers looked fierce enough to drive a team of
wild zebras.</p>

<p>The horses were soon put in, and the groom stood at their
heads, while Grace Bonwick took the driving seat, and Newton
handed her the reins, and got up beside her. Newton at once saw
by the workmanlike way she settled down that her boast was no
idle one. The main street of the town was nearly empty at that
time of the morning, and the horses went at a rapid trot alone
the comparatively good stretch of road.</p>

<p>'They'll do,' said Grace. 'Do you think I can manage them
now?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I'll borrow a horse, and ride up; and that will make
plenty of room,' he replied. 'Mr. Newton; I've got something
important to tell you, and this is a fine opportunity. Don't be
shocked; Mary and I tossed up last night who should do it, and
she won. It's about my cousin.'</p>

<p>Newton started, 'She has got into an entanglement with a man
altogether beneath her, in fact, quite impossible. It's a case of
infatuation, and we hoped the change up here, and absence, and
all that, would put things straight.'</p>

<p>Here Grace paused, and seemed to consider her words, while
Newton waited, feeling rather confused, and the rhythmic tread of
the horses alone broke an uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>'You wonder, of course, why I tell you this about my cousin;
but it is better that you should know, because the man came up in
the same steamer that we did, following her, you see. He kept
himself pretty well concealed in the steerage, but Mary and I
detected him. Now, why I have told you about it is this, having
come this far, he will follow us up, to the station, and all our
care and trouble will be thrown away.'</p>

<p>'What's the man like?' asked Newton, after a pause. The
horses' head had been turned, and they were on the way back.</p>

<p>'What is he like?' repeated Grace. 'He is swarthy rather, and
good looking. Says his family comes from southern Italy. He's an
adventurer, and that's not the worst of it, though that's bad
enough.'</p>

<p>The girl paused, and Newton never thought that her
good-natured face could wear such a look of disdain and contempt.
'Once you'll see him, you'll see for yourself. What is the worst
of it, he calls himself De Luna. If I was a man, I should call
him a d&mdash;&mdash;d nigger.'</p>

<p>Newton felt as though he had got a blow in the face. The girl
used the forcible adjective more as the utmost expression of
contempt she could think of, and it did not seem at all out of
place at the moment. But the shock to Newton came from the fact
that the girl with the beautiful face which he had half fallen in
love with should be mixed up in such an entanglement.</p>

<p>'A nigger!' he repeated, in amazement.</p>

<p>'Well, not a full-blooded one, but a gentleman of color all
the same, with a decided dash of the tar brush. There, I have
told you all. Perhaps he'll come up to the station, and you might
get an excuse to stockwhip him, that possibly would disillusion
her. It makes us very miserable for we are very fond of cousin
Jennie. Now do what you can, but don't talk about it. There's
papa looking out for us, he must think we've eloped.'</p>

<p>Newton got the loan of a fresh horse, and the party were soon
on the road for Cramby Downs, which they finally reached after
what the two bouncers termed a very jolly trip. Mrs. Walker and
the Behemoth were there to welcome them, and the first spark of
animation Newton had seen on the cousin's face was when she
returned Mrs. Walker's greeting.</p>

<p>Newton was much troubled in mind. Here he had not only the
responsibility of entertaining his visitors, but the additional
trouble of having to keep watch and ward for a half-caste
adventurer pursuing an infatuated love-sick girl. He had heard
and read of such cases in both sexes, but be had no desire to
have one so immediately under his notice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walker had everything in apple-pie order, and had even
imported furniture and linen from her own place. Mary Bonwick was
of a domestic disposition, and assumed the reins of government.
Mullins made himself the devoted slave of all and everybody, and
old Bonwick proved himself a very amiable companion, and did not
want to interfere in anything. Everything was going on well-oiled
springs, excepting the confirmed pensiveness of Jane Bonwick and
the lurking suspicion that the objectionable suitor was hanging
about somewhere waiting for a chance to open communication with
the girl.</p>

<p>One day, when an opportunity offered, Newton suggested to
Grace that it might be better to take Mr. and Mrs. Walker into
their confidence. It would be an additional protection, and both
of them were thoroughly friendly and true.</p>

<p>'Possibly Jennie has already told Mrs. Walker her version of
the matter. But I'll consult Mary.'</p>

<p>Mary agreed that there would be no harm in confiding in the
Walkers, and Newton made an excuse for riding over the next day.
He found, as Grace had expected, that Mrs. Walker had already a
very fair inkling of the affair, but she had no idea that it was
as bad as it really was. As for the Behemoth, it would have fared
ill with the man if he had shown up anywhere in the neighborhood
of his place just then.</p>

<p>Newton stayed for dinner, and left with an assurance from Mrs.
Walker that she would do all she could to bring the foolish girl
to her senses, short of reasoning with her, which she assured
Newton would only confirm her in her obstinacy.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant moonlight night, and when about half way on
his way home Newton saw a horseman standing in the road as if
awaiting him. It struck Mm at once that this was the man who
called himself De Luna, seeking an interview with him. He rode
on, and, as he expected, the fellow accosted him by name, and
asked permission to ride with him a short distance, as he wished
to have a few words with him.</p>

<p>Now moonlight has the effect of making dark appear darker. An
ordinarily sun-tanned man in the moonlight looks like a black
fellow, and the moon had this effect on the swarthy visage of the
man who had accosted Newton, so that that gentleman felt very
nettled, and his answer was not put in very courteous
language.</p>

<p>At the station Grace was being called to order by her sister
for restlessly going in and out of the verandah.</p>

<p>'I can't imagine what makes Mr. Newton so late,' she said in
reply.</p>

<p>'Not very late,' her father said; 'only ten o'clock.'</p>

<p>Time passed on, and at eleven Bonwick announced his intention
of going to bed, and went, like the respectable father of a
family should. Grace was still restless, and asked her sister to
sit up with her a little longer, to which Mary grudgingly
consented. Half an hour passed, when both girls were startled by
tie shrill neigh of a horse at the paddock slip rails.</p>

<p>'I knew! I knew something had happened!' cried Grace; 'Here's
Mr. Newton's horse come back alone. Go and knock Mullins up at
the store.'</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer Grace sped off the verandah down
the track to the sliprails at an astonishing pace. The horse was
standing with his head over the top rail, and when he saw Grace,
he whinnied in greeting. Grace got through the fence, and caught
the horse. It was one she had ridden several times. She knew how
to manage on a man's saddle, and fixed the stirrups up and threw
the off one over to the near side. Then with the aid of the fence
she mounted.</p>

<p>When Mullins and a man came along the road and reached about
half-way to Walker's place, they found Grace Bonwick seated on
the grass, with Newton's head in her lap.</p>

<p>'He's lost a lot of blood, but I've managed to stop the
bleeding,' she said quietly. 'Did you think of bringing some
spirits with you?'</p>

<p>Mullins looked at the dark stain on the ground, and on Grace's
dress and hands, as he took a bottle from his saddle pouch. 'Is
it murder?' he asked unsteadily.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
NEWTON replied to the man who had accosted him that if he had
anything to say to him he had better look sharp, as he was in a
hurry to get home.</p>

<p>'I am a traveller, bound for Bangston, a township some short
distance to the westward. My packhorse has got away, and I wished
to ask the favor of your hospitality for the night. I believe I
am speaking the manager of Cramby Downs?'</p>

<p>This was pretty cool, and then it suddenly flashed across
Newton's mind that it was only a clumsy pretext to get to the
station at night, when there was nobody likely to be about to
recognise him. Evidently the dark gentleman had no suspicion that
Newton knew anything about him. Bush hospitality is proverbial,
and the speaker had evidently no thought of being refused.</p>

<p>'I do not wish to appear inhospitable,' said Newton; 'but
there are certain circumstances connected with yourself, Mr. De
Luna, which leaves me no choice but to refuse your request.'</p>

<p>The man was evidently put out, but he mastered his surprise,
and replied quietly, 'You seem to know my name, and from your
allusion, I imagine, that you have been told that I entertain a
deep and respectful admiration for a certain young lady, and that
her relatives have represented me in an entirely false
light.'</p>

<p>'I think not,' replied Newton, 'and I have the pleasure of
bidding you good night.'</p>

<p>'I presume the road is as free for me as for you,' said De
Luna.</p>

<p>'Certainly it is; but remember that the station is not. By the
way, if you are in want of a night's camp, there is a blacks'
camp close to the station.'</p>

<p>'What the devil do you mean, sir?'</p>

<p>'Only that they are compatriots of yours, if somewhat
darker.'</p>

<p>'So that Grace girl has been telling you some of her
lies.'</p>

<p>For answer Newton raised the crop he was carrying, and laid it
vigorously over the other's shoulders. With a perfect scream of
rage, De Luna leaned towards him, drew his sheath knife, and the
next moment Newton felt a keen stab under his collarbone. His
assailant pulled the knife out.</p>

<p>Newton dimly remembered hearing him calling himself a fool for
giving way to his temper, and then he rode away. Newton felt
himself growing sick and faint, and with a last effort he got off
his horse, staggered to the side of the road, and fell down. The
horse waited a short time; then finding itself free, started off
for home.</p>

<p><br>
MULLINS rode hastily on to summon Walker, who was known to
have some knowledge of surgery. The man went back in hot haste
for the buggy, and Grace resolutely maintained her lonely watch
by the unconscious man. The buggy and Walker arrived almost at
the same time. The burly Behemoth examined the wound,
complimented Grace upon her pluck and skill in binding it up,
then lifted Newton up as though he had been a baby, and put him
in the buggy.</p>

<p>On arriving at the station Grace went in to change her dress,
and Walker took Newton and put him In his bed in the store, then
proceeded to bandage him up in a scientific manner. Newton
recovered consciousness, and recognising his friend bending over
him, said feebly, 'I say, old man, it was really my fault. I
struck him first.'</p>

<p>'All serene, old boy, I guess who you mean; but you must lie
still without talking. You've lost a tidy lot of blood.'</p>

<p>Grace found her father and Mary waiting on the verandah. She
told them what had happened in a few words. They went to the room
occupied by the three girls. To her surprise her cousin was there
fully dressed, and she cried out in alarm at seeing the state
Grace was in.</p>

<p>'Whatever is the matter?'</p>

<p>'Matter enough! Thanks to your folly Mr. Newton has been,
probably murdered!'</p>

<p>'Murdered?'</p>

<p>'Well, he's not dead yet; but he might die. He met that darky
lover of yours,' went on Grace, who was not in a mood to show any
mercy; 'and they had a quarrel, and he stabbed Mr. Newton.'</p>

<p>Her cousin put her hands up before her face.</p>

<p>'I suppose Mr. Newton provoked him,' she said through her
fingers.</p>

<p>'Very likely he did; but it's only half-castes who use
knives.'</p>

<p>Her cousin took her hands down, and the worm turned.</p>

<p>'One would think, Grace, that you were in love with Mr. Newton
by the way you are going on?'</p>

<p>'And if I was,' said Grace, turning on her in wrath, and
struggling into a fresh dress at the same time; 'I should be in
love with a white man, at any rate. Why are you dressed? You went
to bed hours ago.'</p>

<p>Jennie said nothing, and Grace, after regarding her for some
time, went up and said something in a low voice, to which her
cousin did not reply. Grace finished her toilet, and hastened out
on the verandah. She took her sister on one side.</p>

<p>'Keep your eye on Jennie,' she said. 'She meant to bolt
to-night.'</p>

<p>Then she went on to the store to inquire after the patient. He
was well, although still weak; but Walker assured her, beyond the
loss of a good deal more blood than was conducive to health,
there was no harm done but what rest and time would cure. The
knife had not gone downwards, otherwise there might have been
another tale to tell.</p>

<p>Grace went back, and, feeling naturally tired out, soon fell
into a sound slumber. In the morning Walker reported his patient
as progressing in, the most satisfactory manner, and after
breakfast took Bonwick aside, and asked him what they should do
in the matter?</p>

<p>'I have been posted up in part of the affair,' he said, 'and
suppose that unless things turn out badly with Newton, you want
no steps taken in the matter. He himself wants things kept quiet.
He says that he was the aggressor, as he struck the man across
the shoulders with his crop.'</p>

<p>'You are quite right, Mr. Walker,' returned Bonwick. 'I do not
want any steps to be taken, provided Newton is all right. It is a
most unhappy affair, and has been a source of great trouble to
us.'</p>

<p>'The girl has money, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes, she has. She is the orphan daughter of my brother, and I
am her guardian, but as she comes of age in about three months, I
cannot see why the fellow was so desperate, unless he is
absolutely penniless.'</p>

<p>'Who is he at all?' 'An adventurer of some sort. You know how.
ready people are in our cities to take a man on his own showing
if he says that he is descended from a titled family. That's the
way my niece met him. Some snobbish friend introduced him to
her.'</p>

<p>'Is he a half-caste?'</p>

<p>'Well, Grace, vows that he is; but I must tell you that she
has a constitutional dislike to colored people. About two or
three months before her birth her mother was frightened by a
colored man. As Grace grew up I have noticed that she was always
prejudiced against anyone dark or swarthy.'</p>

<p>'I think it is a good job in this particular instance that
Miss Grace is so constituted. But for her telling Newton, and
this little trouble occurring, your niece would have been off
last night with this adventurer, to her eternal misery. Miss
Grace told me she was waiting fully dressed. If Newton had not
known the truth and guessed at once who the man was, he would
have allowed him to camp here, and the next morning the birds
would have been flown. Truly, Miss Grace deserves all the credit
of the checkmate; but her cousin owes her world-long thanks, as
she will know when she has got her senses back again.'</p>

<p>There, seemed nothing more to do but await Newton's recovery,
and it was after he had been permitted to talk freely that Grace
asked him for a full account of what passed between him and
DeLuna. Newton related it until he came to the part when the
insolent language used by DeLuna caused Newton to strike him.
This he slurred over somewhat, and Grace was dissatisfied.</p>

<p>'There was nothing in what you have told me to lead to blows,'
she persisted, 'Now just tell me the truth.'</p>

<p>Newton had no help for it, and told all that passed.</p>

<p>'Thank you, Mr. Newton,' she said, holding out her hand. 'I
hope that you hit pretty hard.'</p>

<p>'As hard as I could,' he answered. Grace save him a bright
smile as she left that set Newton thinking how it was he could
have thought the cousin pretty when Grace was by.</p>

<p>The taint of colored blood, unfortunately for the possessor,
carries with it many dangerous tendencies, revenge being a
prominent one. Against Newton DeLuna did not feel much spite. He
considered the knife thrust was quits between them. He had
learned at the township of Bangston that Newton was alive, and
that no steps had been taken to trace his assailant. He shrewdly
guessed the reason, and also that no steps would be taken.</p>

<p>It was against Grace that he vowed vengeance. Time was
slipping away, and he knew well enough that the temporary
infatuation he had inspired the girl with could not last much
longer.</p>

<p>Bonwick was quite right. Not only want of money had inspired
him to follow the party up to Queensland, but also the
overshadowing presence of a persecuting creditor, who had
advanced the money for him to carry on the campaign with. This
creditor was getting, anxious and importunate, and insisted on
accompanying DeLuna to Queensland to see how he got on. Naturally
after the stabbing of Newton, this man did not think very highly
of his chance of getting the debt paid, with the big interest
owing.</p>

<p>'Look here, Dan,' he remarked to the aristocratic DeLuna.
'This game is played out. I can see it if you can't. You've got
plenty of letters of the girls. Sell them, man; they will bring
you in enough to pay me and leave a good balance for yourself.
Bonwick will buy them and pay well for them. It's your only
chance now.'</p>

<p>'And mine, too,' he added to himself.</p>

<p>De Luna reflected over this advice, He recognised that his
game was nearly played out, and marriage with the heiress getting
improbable; it was surely better to take what he could get. And
then the thought of a possible revenge on Grace came into his
headland, like Will Carey, he 'licked has wicked lips.'</p>

<p>The consequence was that Grace received a letter which, when
she read the signature, she touched as she would a black snake.
The epistle stated that the writer, a friend of DeLuna's, who,
for certain reasons, could not appear in the matter, would be
willing to meet Miss Grace Bonwick at any place she would like to
appoint, provided it was five miles from the station, and there
deliver into Miss Grace Bonwick's hands whatever letters Mr.
DeLuna possessed written to him by Miss Jane Bonwick, and give a
written assurance by Mr. DeLuna that he absolved Miss Jane
Bonwick of all pledges and promises, that had passed, and would
molest her no more, for and in consideration of a sum
mentioned&mdash;a pretty tall one, by the way.</p>

<p>Grace duly considered; then she carried the letter to her
father. Bonwick agreed to the terms, and told Grace he would
accompany her; the letter and the recovered letters would be
enough to convince his niece of DeLuna's true character. But his
offer did not suit Grace.</p>

<p>'I will get an escort,' she said; 'only give me the
cheque.'</p>

<p>Bonwick, a very obedient father, gave her the cheque, and
Grace sent off a letter ordered Mullins to saddle a horse for her
and one for himself to escort her over to Walker's station, and
started. The appointed day and time arrived, and Grace rode out
to the rendezvous she had appointed.</p>

<p>She was not a bit astonished at seeing DeLuna himself there
instead of his pretended friend, and haughtily acknowledged his
presence.</p>

<p>'I, of course, guessed you would be here,' she said. 'You are
a very trumpery liar; a white man would have had more sense. Now
be kind enough to give me tine letters and written promise, and I
will hand you the cheque.'</p>

<p>DeLuna bit his lip, but held his tongue; he felt that he could
not hold own against a woman in a war of words.</p>

<p>'For your cousin's sake you might be civil,' he said. 'Here
are the letters and promise.'</p>

<p>Grace took them, looked over them, and read the premise.</p>

<p>'Of course, I have no means of knowing whether they are all
here or not&mdash;I most take your paltry word for it. Here is
the cheque.'</p>

<p>The man was standing close to her horse on the off side, as
she passed him the cheque; he glanced at it, and pushed it into
his pocket.</p>

<p>'Now to settle our account,' he said; and, catching the bridle
with one hand, and throwing his left arm round her waist, sought
to pull her from the saddle. In an instant Grace changed the whip
into her left hand, where she had more play, and rained down
several vicious cuts on him.</p>

<p>Then DeLuna felt himself in the grasp of a pair of hands the
like of which Hue had never experienced. The Behemoth could walk
as softly as a cat on occasions, and he had accompanied Grace,
and been on watch as agreed upon. De Luna was a child, a babe in
his hands. Walker did not strike him; he liberally swept the bush
track with him. Then with the man's mouth full of dirt, his head
full of dust, and his face bleeding, he made him kneel down and
beg Grace's pardon in the most abject manner.</p>

<p>'Turn him inside out,' said Grace, 'and see if there are any
more letters left.'</p>

<p>Nothing loth, the Behemoth did so, and found two more small
packets in his pocket.</p>

<p>'Is that the lot?' he asked. 'If I find any more I will towel
you up and down the road again.'</p>

<p>'It is all,' pleaded the culprit.</p>

<p>'Then go!' said Walker.</p>

<p>'What's that lying there?' asked Grace, pointing to a white
piece of paper on the road.</p>

<p>Walker picked it up.</p>

<p>'It's the cheque you gave him. Shall I tear it up?'</p>

<p>'No; leave it lying there; it was, a bargain, and we have the
letters.'</p>

<p>Walker looked at her as they rode home; then, under some
pretence, rode ahead while she had a little hysterical cry now
that it was all over.</p>

<p>'I have a bone to pick with you,' said Grace to Newton one
day, after there had been a very satisfactory explanation between
them. 'What made you tell Mrs. Walker that I'd turn out a bouncer
and give all the horses I rode sore backs?'</p>

<p>'Good heavens! Did Mrs. Walter give me away?'</p>

<p>'Of course she did; isn't she a woman?'</p>

<p>Presumably DeLuna picked up the cheque and left, as nothing,
beyond the fact that the cheque was duly presented, was ever
heard of him; and the dream-face cousin married a very prosaic
stock and station agent, and is now stouter than the present Mrs.
Newton.</p>

<h2><a id="ch30"></a>30. -- THE LEGEND DRAMEEDAH TOLD</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 28 May 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
I HAVE translated Drameedah's tale into ordinary English. As
he could talk pretty fluently, and I understood some of his
dialect, and so could always help him out with a leading
question, I got the yarn pretty well in its entirety.</p>

<p>Drameedah was an ancient black fellow; he set up to be a bit
of a doctor and a rainmaker, consequently he was a trifle above
his fellows in mental acquirements. I can't say much for his
rainmaking, but it produced about as much effect as a civilised
'day of humiliation' does. His method was to wait till a good
threatening thunderstorm was approaching, and then to retire to a
cave and there remain knocking two stones together, and
performing other incantations, until the rain came down.</p>

<p>This was his version of what he did, but as he would never
show the cave or allow anybody to accompany him, I am of opinion
that he went and planted in a bit of a scrub and went to sleep.
If the rain came, he went back to camp, and received the credit.
If not, why he had always some fine excuse ready.</p>

<p>As to his doctoring, it consisted mostly of the application of
ashes in surgical operations, or putting hot stones into water,
and pouring the water over the wound. As his patients were
generally pretty healthy, and rather liked to have a big scar
left, he may be said to have been happier at healing than rain
making.</p>

<p>He was an old man, with one good eye and one with a white
speck on the pupil, owing to haying received a firestick in it
when a youngster. His beard was scanty and grey, and he had no
legs worth calling so. Anyhow, he was the man who told me this
story, about his father&mdash;or he said it was about his
father&mdash;and both he and his father were natives of North
Queensland.</p>

<p>When his father was a boy, they had heard of the whites
through the stories of them travelling from one tribe to another
from the fringe of settlement. But their idea of them was very
vague, and as the descriptions they received generally mixed up
the men and horse they had not conceived a very correct idea of
this new being.</p>

<p>One day Drameedah's father, then a boy of about fifteen, saw a
strange track, which he followed, and came to a dead horse. There
were many other tracks about where the horse was, and presently
he saw a very strange-shaped foot, without toes, going in the
direction the horse had been going. On this, Drameedah's father
made for his father, and acquainted him with the
circumstance.</p>

<p>Some more blacks assembled, and they followed the tracks up,
and finally found a white man in a state of collapse from thirst.
It was his boots that had puzzled Drameedah's father. Fortunately
for the man, the blacks were shifting camp, so some of the gins
had coolamons of water with them. Thus the man's life was saved,
and the blacks took the stranger to camp with them. He recovered,
and stayed with them some time, and from what Drameedah could
make out from his father he was one of a party of whites who had
somehow got parted from them and lost. At that time there was no
enmity between the blacks and whites, for the blacks had had no
experience of the strangers; so the white was not injured, and
the blacks got very fond of him. He must have been with them some
years, for, according to the yarn, he had grown a long beard and
learned to talk their language and use their weapons.</p>

<p>One day, when they were a good distance from the spot where he
had been found, they came upon other traces of whites, and at
night time went and looked at their camp, which was a large one.
At daylight the white man said that he would go back to them, as
they were sure to be friends. The blacks didn't want him to go,
but at sunrise he stepped out from the scrub, where the natives
were hidden, and called to the whites in their own language.
There was a great bustle in the camp, and they all came crowding
around the rescued man. There was a lot of noise, and presently
to the surprise of the natives there was a struggle, and they
heard their white man calling to them for help.</p>

<p>There were a great many natives there, all armed, and they'
rushed on the camp, although the others fired guns at them. The
strange whites had big knives, and their white man had got one of
these from them, and was fighting with it. In spite of the guns
and knives the blacks got the best of it, killed about half the
whites, and wounded the others. Their own white man had been
hurt, too, but not badly. Then he told them that these were not
friends of his at all as he had thought, but bad white men, and
they must keep those they had wounded, and not let them get away.
So the dead were buried, and all the knives and guns, and the
clothes of the dead men, were taken away, and also the guns and
knives of the live ones.</p>

<p>The blacks were camped on the bank of a large river, just
above where the salt water came up, and had a large camp, for it
was a good time for fish, and many natives had come from all
about, that part, both to corroboree and see the white man. Now,
amongst the six white men taken alive was one that at once
excited the curiosity of Drameedah's father&mdash;a youth with
bright black eyes and curly black hair, the same as some of the
blacks have.</p>

<p>All the men were black-haired, while Congaloo, as they called
the white man whom they had first found, was fair, nor could he
speak or understand the others very well. The gins told
Drameedah's father that this was a white woman, and Congaloo had
a bough hut made for her, so that she could live by herself.
There was another man amongst them, a very big man, with a big
black beard. He had been badly hurt on the head, and Congaloo and
the woman looked after him while he was sick. After the camp was
fixed, and there were now so many blacks that the new whites
could not get away, Congaloo and several blacks, all good strong
men, got some canoes, and went down the salt water, for Congaloo
said that these men had come in a big canoe, and not on horses,
like he had come.</p>

<p>Drameedah's father begged to be allowed to go and Congaloo
took him with him. They went down until they came to the big
water which is the end of all land, and there they saw a big
canoe, like those that come up now, stuck fast on an island. The
blacks did not like to follow Congaloo on board, but, when they
saw him going about for some time they mustered up courage.
Drameedah's father was one of the first, and he ran up to
Congaloo when he got on deck, and took hold of his hand, and hid
his face, for he was frightened, for there were white men lying
dead about the deck, and the sun had scorched and dried them, and
the blood and the stench was awful. The dead men had died
fighting, and when they went into the cabin, it was all broken
and knocked about.</p>

<p>Congaloo made the blacks help him to throw the dead men
overboard, and wash the decks down. There was a little canoe on
board; and that was put into the water, and after Congaloo had
put some things into it, he took it round to a safe place, out of
sight of the big canoe.</p>

<p>There were some, blacks living on the island, and they told
them that the big canoe had come there one dark night, and that
afterwards they heard noises on board that frightened them, and
saw flashes of fire. So they hid away. Congaloo showed them where
he had put the little canoe, and told them to look after it till
he came again. Then they went back to the camp.</p>

<p>After that Congaloo, who wore clothes he had found on board,
and cut his beard short, became quite a different man. He did not
always go hunting as he did before, but he and the woman, whose
name was Marca, so Drameedah's father told him, soon learnt to
understand each other, and were always talking together. The big
man and the others got well, but they, too, were always talking
together, and the blacks did not like them.</p>

<p>One day the old blacks came to Congaloo, and told him that
they had decided to kill the new white men, as they were
frightened of them. Congaloo told them not to kill them, but he
would send them away, in a little canoe. Then he and Marca talked
together, and she was pleased, and clapped her hands, and she
went and talked with the big black-bearded man. He got in a
great rage, and lifted his hand up to strike her, but Congaloo
interfered, and there was a great noise, all the others crying
out, and talking fast. She blacks all got round with their
weapons, and only for Congaloo they would have killed the new
white men.</p>

<p>Then they got quiet, and it was settled that all the new men
should go down to the big water, and make a new canoe, and go
away. All except Marca, who did not want to go with them, but to
stop with Congaloo. The black-bearded man was very sulky, but the
others persuaded him, as they were frightened of the blacks.</p>

<p>Then Congaloo told Drameedah's father that he was frightened
that the black-bearded man would try to hurt Marca before he
went, so Drameedah's father was to go away with her that night,
to another place, and stop with her there, and keep a good
lookout till the men were gone. When it was night, my father and
another, young man waited outside the camp, and presently
Congaloo and Marca came and joined them. Congaloo went with them
a little way, and then he talked some time with Marca, and they
kissed each other, although my father knew nothing of kissing at
that time, and then Congaloo went back to camp, and the two young
men and Marca went away to the hills, so that my father did not
see what happened at the camp for some days, but only knew what
he was told.</p>

<p>The white men started in the morning for the canoe. The big
man was very angry when he found Marca was gone. Congaloo had
sent some blacks down before them, to tell the other blacks who
lived there that the whites were coming, and they were to watch
them, and see them go away, and then come up and tell us. They
were also to get the small canoe, and hide it in a safer place.
So they went away, the black-bearded man raging and shaking his
fist at Congaloo, up to the last. Then Congaloo went out to where
Marca and Drameedah's father were, and remained with them until
word came that the white men had made a little canoe, and gone
away. Then they all went back to camp, and there was a big
corroboree, because they were glad that the whites had gone.</p>

<p>Congaloo and Marca and the two young men went down one day to
see the canoe on the island. A lot of it was broken up by the men
when they were making the boat, but they had not taken very much.
Then Drameedah's father saw a very strange thing. Congaloo and
Marca were talking together. She was laughing, as she always was
now, since the whites had gone, and she and Congaloo were all
alone. The two young men were looking at the strange things
scattered about, when suddenly Drameedah's father saw a head poke
up out of a hole in the deck and glare at the two talking and
laughing together, and then, catching sight of the youth, it
disappeared again. But Drameedah's father called out, for it was
the black-bearded man whom he had seen. When he had told
Congaloo, Marca looked very frightened, but Congaloo called the
ether blacks, and they watched all round while we searched all
over the big canoe, but found nobody.</p>

<p>Suddenly Marca said something to Congaloo, at which he seemed
delighted, and she clapped her hands. All the blacks were got
together, and they were told to watch all around, some in canoes,
while some of them burnt the big canoe. Congaloo showed then how
to pour blacks' stuff over the wood, and presently they had the
canoe all of a blaze. They watched her burn all night, but nobody
came out, and in the morning they could find no trace of anybody
having been burned. But Congaloo would not leave for a long time,
but searched everywhere.</p>

<p>Now some of the blacks thought that Drameedah's father had
made a mistake, and had not seen the black-bearded man; but two
days after the canoe had been burnt the island blacks found that
the little canoe that they had hidden had been found and taken
away, so he must have been there, and managed to escape
somehow.</p>

<p>Congaloo and Marca, however, seemed not to care, and they went
back to the camp, quite happy. For a week or two they were quite
quiet. Marca could sing, although she had never done so before,
and the blacks would listen to her as long as they could. One
night Drameedah's father heard a noise in the hut where Congaloo
and Marca lived, and being half asleep, and seeing nothing, he
went off to sleep again, but in the morning there lay Congaloo
with a deep cut in his forehead, and Marca was gone.</p>

<p>The blacks attended to Congaloo, who was not dead, and when he
came to his senses, and found that he was too weak to stand, he
was nearly mad. He begged them to go after the man, who must have
taken Marca, and when they told him they had followed the tracks
down to the water, where he must have had the small canoe, he
begged them to help him down to the canoes, which, luckily, the
man had not seen, or he would have destroyed them. They got him
down, and a number, of them went, but they were too late. When
they got to where the black beams of the big canoe lay, there
was poor Marca tied to one of the upright ones.</p>

<p>She was not quite dead, but had been stabbed all over the face
and body. She could not see, but when she felt Congaloo's arms
round her, heard his voice, she seemed quite happy, and smiled,
and lay there in his arms till she died. Congaloo sat there
crying over her, and all, blacks cried and wailed, and the gins
belonging to the island cried, and cut their breasts with sharp
stones. Then one of the men told him that they had seen the man
go away in the little canoe on to the great water that has no
end. That they were watching him when they came, and did not see
what he had done to Marca.</p>

<p>When Congaloo seemed to understand that the man had gone away,
he got quite quiet, and they dug a grave for Marca under a big
tree. There they buried her, and Congaloo, after he had kissed
her dead face, all marked as it was with the knife gashes, would
let no one put the earth tip her but himself. Then he brought
great stones, and built them over her grave, and when he had
finished all the light had gone out of his eyes, and he went and
sat on the beach and looked out at the great water without an
end, where the man had gone.</p>

<p>'Now this,' said Drameedah, 'I know myself, for when I was a
boy I went to that island with my father to catch turtle, and he
showed me the big stones, and perhaps they are there still.'</p>

<p>That night the rains came&mdash;the great wind that comes
every year with thunder and lightning. It blew for two days, and
all through it Congaloo sat there, or walked about the beach, and
when Drameedah's father took him food and spoke to him he said,
'I am waiting for him to come back.'</p>

<p>In the morning it was bright, and beautiful and the blacks
came running to Congaloo, and told him that the little canoe had
come back. Then they searched and found the black-bearded man
asleep, and they brought him to Congaloo, and he laughed.</p>

<p>Not a word did he say, but whenever the main spoke to him he
smiled, and then told the blacks to give the man food and drink.
He was hungry and thirsty and ate and drank; Congaloo still
smiled.</p>

<p>Now between the island and the great land you could get across
without a canoe when the big water went down. Half-way was a
clump, of mangroves, and one very big tree amongst them with
stout roots. Here Congaloo had the man taken, and he tied him to
the roots so that his head would be out of the water when the big
water came. All about there were crocodiles and sharks when the
big water came in, and the blacks never went that way if they
could get a canoe.</p>

<p>Congaloo sat up in that tree and watched that man die. He was
three days dying, for he was given drink and food. The crabs
walked over him and ate off his lips and his eyelids and his ears
and nose, and the red sun glared at him from the east, and he
couldn't close his eyes. When the alligators and sharks came
near, Congaloo would frighten them away with his gun, for he did
not want the man killed. The salt water would come around his
neck, and when he would shriek and call out with pain Congaloo
would laugh. And so he died, and by and by the crabs ate his body
up.</p>

<p>Then Congaloo came back to the camp and told the blacks that
he was going away to try and find his own people, and there was
great crying about it. Congaloo went, but before he left he said
that he would tell his people that he had been well treated by
the blacks, so that when they came there would be peace between
them.</p>

<p>Drameedah's father had grown to be a man, and had often seen
the whites who had begun to come out with cattle and horses, when
one day he went back with his tribe to the old camp at the river.
They had not been there long before a black fellow from the
island came up, and said 'Congaloo has come back.' They went down
to the island to see him, and there he lay dead, on Marca's
grave.</p>

<p>His beard was long and white, and his hair was white, and he
was gaunt and worn. But he had died with a smile on his face, and
the blacks buried him there with great crying, for they had loved
him.</p>

<h2><a id="ch31"></a>31. -- BROWN'S RANGE</h2>

<h3><i>Argus</i>, Melbourne,  20 and 27 March 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
THE black water reflected the brilliant Southern
constellations burning in the clear sky overhead. These mimic
stars wavered up and down and spread into long bands of light as
the dip of the oars rippled the calm surface of the river. On
either hand the dense, gloomy mangrove swamp was alive with
flitting fireflies, and rife with the smell of the ooze left bare
by the receding tide. At times the boat glided beneath trees
laden with flying foxes chattering amongst the branches, adding
their unsavoury odour to the pestilential stench of the flats.
The tide was running out, and the boat, manned by three men, was
making good progress towards the sea.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes skinned, Jim," said one of the men who were
rowing, to the one who was steering; "don't go astray in a branch
creek or run us on a mud-bank."</p>

<p>"Let Frenchy come and steer now," returned the man addressed.
"We are past nearly all the blind creeks, but one can't tell the
difference between wet mud and water by this light. Frenchy's the
man most interested in our not getting stuck."</p>

<p>"Do you hear, Frenchy," said the man who had first spoken.
"Jim will take a spell at rowing."</p>

<p>"Right," said the third occupant. "I have eyes like the cat."
He shipped his oar and Jim and he changed places, the boat
meanwhile drifting down with the tide.</p>

<p>Nearly half-an-hour passed, when suddenly the boat ran
smoothly on to a mud bank and stopped.</p>

<p>"So much for your cats' eyes," said Jim, as he thrust his oar
into the soft mud and found no bottom. The Frenchman muttered a
curse in his own tongue.</p>

<p>"What to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing but wait for the tide to turn and float us off."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"A couple of hours. It's still running out, but not far off
the turn."</p>

<p>Once more the Frenchman cursed. The two men, Jim and his mate
Sam, made some fruitless efforts to get the boat off, but the
slimy mud offered no purchase strong enough, and they gave it
up.</p>

<p>"Here come the mosquitoes," said Sam, as the first flight of
the voracious myriads settled on them; "a lively two hours we
shall have."</p>

<p>They lit their pipes, the Frenchman rolled a cigarette, and
sullenly waited through two hours of torment, listening to the
mysterious noises of that dreary region.</p>

<p>"We only want an alligator to come aboard to make it quite
cheerful and social," grumbled Jim.</p>

<p>"We'll be afloat again soon," said Sam, who was of a more
equable temper; "the tide is making fast now."</p>

<p>"What is that!" quickly exclaimed the Frenchman.</p>

<p>They all listened intently. Far away in the distance carne
faintly a rhythmic beat, gradually growing louder.</p>

<p>The three recognised it at once. "The steam launch after us,"
said Sam.</p>

<p>"He is on board," muttered the Frenchman; "but we don't both
go back alive."</p>

<p>"How long before they arrive?" he asked aloud.</p>

<p>"Some time," answered Sam.</p>

<p>"They have a big bend to come round and are going half speed.
Beside the tide is against them."</p>

<p>"How long before we float off this cursed mud?"</p>

<p>Sam put his hand over the side. "Very shortly."</p>

<p>"We shall be off before they can get here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, easily. But they will overhaul us long before we can put
you on board the schooner."</p>

<p>"Will you resist? Fight?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Jim. "Why should we get ourselves into a row
with the police, for I bet that is their launch? We've agreed to
put you on board the schooner, and we intend to try to do it. It
will be bad enough to lose the passage money without getting into
quod besides."</p>

<p>"Look at the odds, too," said Sam. "There's an engineer, a
stoker, and I suppose a couple of traps, beside the man you seem
to expect, five men, and the police men armed. No; when they tell
us to stop in the Queen's name we must do it. Hark they are full
speed now."</p>

<p>The Frenchman cursed them for cowards in his own language.</p>

<p>"I will double the pay."</p>

<p>"Not worth it; but we'll dodge them if we can."</p>

<p>Sam and Jim held a hurried conversation.</p>

<p>"How long will the schooner wait for you?" asked the
former.</p>

<p>"Not beyond the day after to-morrow," said the Frenchman,
after short consideration.</p>

<p>"The best thing to do, then, is to slip up an anabranch there
is just below here. I remember this mud bank now. The branch is
narrow, and runs into the sea a mile or two above the mouth of
the river. We will lie quiet all day, and put you on board
to-morrow night."</p>

<p>The noise of the approaching pursuers was now ominously
near.</p>

<p>"We shall just manage it." said Sam. "Got a handkerchief round
your neck, Jim? If so, muffle your oar in the rowlocks with it,
and paddle quiet."</p>

<p>The boat was now afloat, and the men in a few strokes cleared
the bank just as the light of the launch hove in sight round the
bend. Keeping under the bank, where the tide was slack, they
strove silently to gain the opening of the anabranch wherein lay
temporary safety. Suddenly the noise behind them ceased. They
heard a sharp order, and the churning of the reversed screw.</p>

<p>"Glory!" chuckled Jim, "we're safe enough. They've gone full
split on to that mud-bank. It will be half an hour before its
deep enough to float them."</p>

<p>The Frenchman turned and shook his fist triumphantly at the
now stationary light. Soon they made out the opening of the
anabranch and turned into it.</p>

<p>The rowers now took it easy, keeping close to one bank of the
creek. The branch ran at no great angle to the river, and in the
silence of the night they could still hear the voices of the men
on the launch. Presently Jim said something to Sam, and they
stopped rowing, close to a little marine plain, dimly visible in
the blackness of the mangroves. The water was deeper, and a sandy
bank enabled them to lie alongside and land if they wished to,
but they remained in the boat as yet.</p>

<p>"There is a splendid hiding place just below," said Jim in a
low tone. "I found a black fellow's canoe planted there once; the
mangroves grow right across the mouth of a little inlet. I'm
doubtful if I can find it in the dark, so we had better keep
still here and find out what the launch does. If she turns down
here we can make dart for a creek there is nearly opposite and
turn up there until they pass."</p>

<p>Their passenger grunted assent, and they all sat still,
patiently awaiting the departure of the launch. It was not long
before the beat of the screw was heard again, then came a minute
of anxious suspense, and they all drew a breath of satisfaction.
The launch kept on down the main river.</p>

<p>"We have the pull over her," said Jim, "We can hear her
coming, but they can't hear us."</p>

<p>Feeling now comparatively secure, they landed on the little
plain, first, by Sam's advice, taking off their boots.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "Those dunderheaded police don't know
the difference between a black's truck and a white man's, so long
as its a naked foot."</p>

<p>Here they could wait more at ease for the advent of daylight,
but not much conversation went on and the mosquitoes entirely
precluded all thoughts of sleep. At last the white mist preceding
the dawn began to rise, and the wearied men looked longingly for
the coming of the sun, for their spirits were naturally affected
by the dismal nature of their surroundings. The morn came, and
they made a fire of driftwood, black fellow fashion, that is,
putting the sticks in a circle with their ends together after the
manner of the spokes of a wheel. This was Sam's notion, for the
further confounding of the police in case they should land and
look for tracks. A meal was soon prepared from some rations they
had, and a breaker of fresh water in the boat.</p>

<p>"Now," said Sam, when the hasty meal was finished, "let's get
the boat planted snug, for that launch may come puffing around
the corner at any moment."</p>

<p>The fire was put out with a few handfuls of mud and entering
the boat they paddled a short way down until Jim said, "Ship your
oar."</p>

<p>Pulling the boat along by the branches of the young mangroves,
which completely masked the entrance, they found themselves in a
tiny ditch with a bend in it, quite concealed from the view of
anyone passing up the river. They had nothing to do but lie still
and watch the young alligators crawling about amongst the muddy
roots when the tide was out, and the armies of crabs marching to
and fro, and occasionally disappearing leaving nothing but
bubbles behind them in the liquid mud. They could not smoke, lest
the smell should betray them in the event of the launch
passing.</p>

<p>At 11 o'clock or thereabouts, they heard the little steamer
coming up the anabranch from seaward. It came steadily on, but a
bare twenty yards of mangrove scrub separated the hunted from the
hunters. The two men for whom the earth was not big enough for
both to live on.</p>

<p>Was it some instinctive feeling of their neighbourhood made
the civilian on board the launch say something to the senior
constable? The launch stopped, and with the way on her ran into
the sandbank bordering the little plain. Two men landed, they
walked up and down and saw the tracks, but Sam's manoeuvre was
successful; they put it down to a wandering party of natives on a
fishing excursion.</p>

<p>The steam launch backed out from the bank. The men in hiding
heard her go up to the junction; then the sound indicated that
she was on her way up the river again.</p>

<p>"Gone home again!" cried Sam; "didn't I slew them nicely about
those tracks."</p>

<p>"Gone home be hanged," growled Jim. "Gone back for coal and
water. They've seen the schooner, and know of course that she
would not be there still if we had put Frenchy on hoard. No fear,
they'll soon be back."</p>

<p>The passenger took his hand out of his coat pocket, where it
had been tightly clutching the handle of a revolver, and asked
quietly:</p>

<p>"And after?"</p>

<p>"What are we going to do now?" said Sam as the two men, by
aid of the branches, overhauled the boat back in the stream.
"Why, put you on board as soon as ever we can. We are just as
anxious to get rid of you as you are to see the last of us."</p>

<p>The men pulled with a will, and in a few minutes they emerged
from the mangroves into the open sea, and at once sighted the
schooner lying some distance out. The mast was stepped, the sail
set, and, with a light breeze blowing they were soon dancing over
the blue wavelets.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," said the skipper, as the Frenchman climbed
on board followed by the two men. The anchor had been weighed at
first sight of the boat, the sails were now being shaken out, and
every preparation made for immediate departure.</p>

<p>"There was a launch poking about all the early morning," went
on the captain "Once she started to come out to us, but turned
back for some reason."</p>

<p>"Found their coal and water wouldn't carry them home if they
came on," chuckled Sam.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, whispered to the captain, and then took the men
apart.</p>

<p>"You have done your duty like men," he said. "Accept my thanks
and the double pay I mentioned. Your way was better than
mine."</p>

<p>The men acknowledged his words and the money somewhat
clumsily, wished him good luck, and after a hasty word or two
with the skipper and a short adjournment to the little cabin,
clambered into their boat, each carrying a bottle of rum. The
wind was freshening, and the schooner went off with a fair
breeze.</p>

<p>Standing at the stern, the Frenchman lifted his hat ironically
and bowed towards the shore.</p>

<p>"Foiled my dear friend, foiled," he said, half aloud, in
French. "But what a long bill you will have to pay in the future!
My disgrace, conviction! The hell of New Caledonia! That boat
voyage here, and&mdash;" he ground his teeth savagely as he
thought of the last indignity&mdash;"to have run from you like a
dog and be called 'Frenchy' by two fishers of trepang."</p>

<p>Jim and Sam meanwhile were beating back to their little
fishing station, behind a sheltered point, when the pertinacious
launch once more shot out from the mangroves and made to cut them
off.</p>

<p>When hailed the men ran their boat up in the wind and waited,
with the sail flapping. The launch ran up alongside them, manned,
as Sam had predicted.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Sam Ford," said the senior constable, who had two
stripes on his arm.</p>

<p>"What took you out to that schooner?"</p>

<p>Sam nodded. "I don't know that it's any business of yours, Tom
Dawson, but, as you're not a bad fellow, I'll tell you. We went
off to get this," and he held up one of the bottles.</p>

<p>"Who did you put on board?" continued the constable, not
noticing Sam's equivocation. "And what schooner is it?"</p>

<p>"How do you know that we put anyone on board? As for the
schooner, she's a trade schooner going up to the pearlers."</p>

<p>"Oi'd arrest them on suspicion," said the other policeman, who
was a raw Irishman.</p>

<p>"Shut up you ass," muttered his superior.</p>

<p>"And fwhut for didn't you arrest them musqueteers fwhat
peppered ye's last night?" returned Jim, who had had a suck at
the bottle, mimicking his brogue. The engineer and stoker
laughed, for the policeman's face was covered with a rush of
pimples.</p>

<p>"Well, Sam," went on the other policeman, "if you put the man
we want on board that schooner, which I know very well you did,
you have helped one of the biggest villains to escape who was
ever lagged to New Caledonia. You've also lost your share of five
hundred pounds, which is the price on his head for he killed two
warders in escaping. A French detective is here with a warrant
for him, and this gentleman has come up from the south to
identify him."</p>

<p>"This gentleman," who had not yet spoken, was a fair bearded
man with cold grey eyes. He now put in a word.</p>

<p>"And every morning when I awake I shall expect to find my
throat cut."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about putting anyone on board," returned Sam
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Go ahead!" said the policeman.</p>

<p>The launch sped buck, and the boat shaped her original
course.</p>

<p><br>
IT was an evil hour for Bertin when he met Masterton and made
a friend of him. Bertin was well off, was fond of England, and
spent a good deal of his time there. Masterton had a scheme.
Bertin had money and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Masterton had a glib tongue and an insinuating manner. His
scheme was to found a colony on co-operative principles, where,
in course of time, the down-trodden and oppressed of the earth
would take refuge and build up a model community. He asserted
that he had large areas of land ceded to him by native chiefs in
a group of islands in the Pacific. He proposed to Bertin to join
him in this great work, and the idea at once took possession of
Bertin's somewhat romantic nature. Bertin found the cash to start
the scheme going, and entered into it with implicit and simple
confidence. It was agreed that an effort should he made to build
the foundation on a French basis, and for this purpose Bertin
undertook to work amongst the country people of Southern France.
Should the natural disinclination of the French peasant to leave
his native soil prove too strong they would fall back on
Italy.</p>

<p>Elaborately got up pamphlets were issued, containing glowing
descriptions of the agricultural capabilities of the soil and the
salubrity of the climate in these far-away islands. As for the
natives, they were so friendly and gentle that they were only too
glad to welcome the whites and work for them for next to nothing.
Photographs of rich tropical scenery were distributed through the
work, and a paradise was depicted only waiting for the advent of
civilised inhabitants. Bertin worked hard, and his success was
beyond his anticipations. As the deposits were paid in by the
intending settlers they were at once forwarded to Masterton in
London, who, it was understood, was superintending the fitting
out of a large steamer.</p>

<p>Suddenly a well-known newspaper, which sustained its
popularity by exposing bogus schemes, dropped on this one.</p>

<p>With bitter denunciation it pointed out that the only two
places mentioned in the pamphlet which had any tangible existence
were barren, people-less atolls; that some of the photographs had
been recognised as having been taken in Fiji and Samoa: that in
one word the whole affair was a bare-faced swindle.</p>

<p>It burst upon Bertin like a bomb. He made no attempt at
flight, he was too stunned at finding himself an accomplice in
such a cruel swindle. Instead of being a philanthropist on a
large scale, he was a common thief. Masterton disappeared, and so
did the money. No steamer was in preparation, the whole thing was
bogus from beginning to end, and so well had Masterton succeeded
in keeping his name in the background that he was hardly known in
the matter save, perchance as a victim.</p>

<p>On Bertin descended the whole of the popular fury. His
friends, who knew and believed in him, fought hard on his behalf,
but in vain. The wall of New Ireland and the name of the Marquis
de Rays was not forgotten, and the innocent and unfortunate man,
the last of an honoured family, left the shores of his native
land to serve a long sentence in New Caledonia. He left behind
him, too, a broken-hearted mother, who devoted herself to
striving to obtain a remission of his sentence.</p>

<p><br>
TWO years passed, years of brooding that almost obliterated
every thought from his heart but the one hungry craving for
revenge on the man who had robbed him of everything and consigned
him to a convict's doom.</p>

<p>About this time a distinguished officer visited Noumea. He had
been a friend of Bertin's father, and although his visit was
ostensibly official he had a deeper purpose in view. He firmly
believed in Bertin's innocence, and made use of his influence to
obtain a private interview with him. He could hold out no hope to
the prisoner of a speedy remission of his sentence, but he did
something more, for he was a man who felt strongly when injustice
had been perpetrated.</p>

<p>He gave the son of his old friend a sum of money and obtained
for him some concessions which allowed him more liberty. He did
not say in plain words "Escape at the first chance," but he told
Bertin that as he returned to France he would lodge a sum of
money in one of the banks in a Queensland town in an assumed
name, and furnish him with the necessary credentials to claim
it.</p>

<p>Bertin understood him. Not long after his friend left an
opportunity occurred, but here again his bad luck dogged him. By
an accident he was forced to consent to take another convict with
him who had discovered his plans and threatened to report them to
the authorities. This man was a brute of the lowest type, and
through his stupidity they were forced into a scuffle with two of
the warders, one of whom was fatally stabbed by Bertin's
companion.</p>

<p>Then followed an awful voyage in an open boat with scant
rations and water, to the north Queensland coast. When at last
they landed Bertin lost no time in separating from his abominable
companion. This man worked his way down to Brisbane in a few
months' time, and was there recognised by a French detective who
was on the lookout for escapees. He at once betrayed Bertin, and
laid the death of the warder on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Masterton had come to Brisbane, and his ill gotten gains had
thriven. He had had marvellous success in some mining
speculations, and was now a rich man.</p>

<p>One day he read in the newspaper of Bertin's escape, which
made a little stir at the time. From that moment he became a prey
to abject fear. The French detective who had arrested Bertin's
companion in flight, had reason to believe that Masterton was one
of the victims of the colonisation scheme, and appealed to him
for an accurate description of Bertin. He believed he had traced
and located him in a northern town, had obtained an extradition
warrant and was about to proceed up there. Masterton, in nervous
anxiety to settle the matter, consented to go with him and
identity his man.</p>

<p>Bertin meanwhile had been living quietly, maturing his plan of
escape. He did not dare risk proceeding by any of the regular
mail steamers, the chance of recognition was too great, but he
had entered into negotiations with the master of a schooner
running up to the Torres Straits pearling grounds to take him on
board and land him on Thursday Island, where he might pick up a
China bound steamer without exciting any suspicion.</p>

<p>Sam and Jim, the two trepang-fishers kept watch at their
station for the coming of the schooner, and the same evening that
Masterton and the detective arrived over land, the two men had
come up to warn Bertin of the schooner's arrival and take him
down to her.</p>

<p>The start was to have been made the next morning, but from his
window that evening he caught sight of his hated enemy, and one
whom he immediately recognised as a French detective.</p>

<p>Their errand was patent to him at once. As soon as it was dark
he slipped out to where he knew the trepang-fishers were to be
found, and induced them to make an immediate start.</p>

<p>When the police, whose assistance had been invoked by the
Frenchman, went to arrest him, the bird had flown. Immediate
pursuit was essential, but the detective was sickening with
malarial fever and dared not tackle the night air in the
mangrove-lined river so Masterton, much against the grain and
with a sinking heart had to accompany them to identify Bertin.
But the capture did not take place, as we have seen.</p>

<p>A ray of good fortune for once befriended Bertin. In those
days the telegraph line had not yet been extended to Thursday
Island, and long before information of his flight could be sent
to the police there he had taken passage to Singapore and
disappeared in the motley population of that seaport. He reached
England in safety and was there joined by his mother, who lived
to see her son once more&mdash;not free truly, only an escaped
convict in hiding.</p>

<p>She slowly faded and died, and Bertin was left to pursue the
craving desire for vengeance that occupied every thought. He had
money, for his mother had quietly realised all her property in
France and left it in an available form for him. He dared not
show amongst his former set for fear of recognition; he could not
go to France nor anywhere on the Continent, lest some of the
ubiquitous tourists might know him, and, by some foolish remark,
betray his whereabouts to the French authorities. He was an
outcast, and Europe knew him no more.</p>

<p>Masterton meanwhile throve and was met with success at every
turn. He passed many months of nervous fear, always expecting the
coming of the avenger, but at last time worked the usual change,
and although he still woke at intervals from some deadly
nightmare with a beating heart, he began to enjoy life once
more.</p>

<p>He married and realised what had been his desire ever since he
knew of Bertin's escape. He had a steam yacht built and spent
most of his time at sea. There alone he felt safe.</p>

<p><br>
BROWN'S RANGE is not a range in the usual acceptation of
the term. It consists neither of hills nor mountains. Brown's
Range is the title of a series of small islands, ranged in an
ellipse or rude circle, in the heart of a network of coral
reefs&mdash;the centre of a maze.</p>

<p>Brown's Range lies north of the equator, somewhere about
latitude fourteen, and was one of the uninhabited atolls selected
to give an air of reality to the colonisation pamphlet, wherein
it was represented as an isle of Men.</p>

<p>Three miles from these narrow banks of sand lies the outer
reef of encircling coral, and to the windward, on the eastern
side, for nine months of the year, breaks, roars, and thunders
the never ceasing surf, night and day a fury of foam and spume.
On the leeward side to the west there is a fitful peace, and a
boat can succeed in slowly working through the parallel lines of
reef and reach the islets which surround the wide bosom of a
still lagoon.</p>

<p>On these islands are but four things&mdash;sand, coconut
palms, pandanus, and nuku trees. The coconuts form the outer
fringe and incline stubbornly seaward. The nuku and pandanus
trees stand erect, the singular twisted stems of the latter,
which have gained them the name of screw palms, held firmly in
the ground by their long, tenacious, fibrous roots. There is
nothing else. Nothing but this calm lagoon encircled by these
lonely islets, and the wide barrier of coral and broken water,
with the brilliant sky of that region overhead.</p>

<p>Masterton, in his yacht the <i>Stingray</i>, had been cruising
amongst the Caroline Islands. Looking over the chart one day he
found that they were no great distance from the spot the name of
which he had once selected at haphazard from the Admiralty chart
to further his swindle, and a desire to actually see the place
sprang up in his breast. His wife and baby son were on board, and
the weather was not fine. The Captain received orders to go
there.</p>

<p>It was a perfect morning when they sighted Brown's Range.
Although but a light breeze was blowing, the "brave white horses"
still reared their tossing crests on the eastern reef. The
steamer worked round to leeward, and Masterton, bidding adieu to
his young wife, and promising to attend to her laughing request
to bring back green cocoa nuts for the boy, got into the boat,
accompanied by three men, and started to pick their way through
the intricate reefs to the islands.</p>

<p>When at last they arrived Masterton and two men landed. His
men proceeded to get the coconuts, and Masterton wandered across
to the lagoon and stood there musing for some time, trying to put
away the disagreeable thoughts that were forced on him by his
situation.</p>

<p>Had he any to bestow on his one time friend? Any remorse for
the untoward fate of the man he had dragged from prosperity down
to a living death? Not one; his only prayer was that their paths
might never cross.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour he strolled back, and found the men
waiting with the coconuts. The boat keeper had been fishing and
had caught some tempting looking fish. They had made a fire, and
some were cooking on the coals. Masterton threw himself in the
shade on the sand. "Take the coconuts on board," he said, "and
then come back for me. Bring Mrs. Masterton if she wants a run
ashore."</p>

<p>The men looked longingly at the fresh fish on the coals, but
Masterton had no feeling for others. They sulkily manned the boat
until they were far enough away to express a vigorous and
unqualified opinion of the moral and physical nature of the owner
of the <i>Stingray</i>. Fat was serving them a good turn, as they
had to acknowledge afterwards.</p>

<p>The fish had been turned once, and were now nicely cooked
Masterton was an epicure, but he took great care of himself, and
was rewarded with good health and a fine appetite. Fresh caught
fish, broiled in the open air on a wood fire, is a dish to tempt
a dyspeptic. The sailors had brought up the steward's basket,
which had been put in the boat, and spread the contents on the
sand. Masterton sniffed the odour, then helped himself to one. It
was so good that he tried another. He had just finished when a
shout from seaward attracted his attention. The boat had not yet
cleared the reefs, but the halloa had been to draw his attention
to a vessel that was coming round from the windward side of the
island. A schooner, and she hove to much nearer the reel than the
steamer did.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Bertin changed his name and disappeared he took refuge in
the wandering life of a south sea trader. His love of romance and
adventure that had led him astray in the toils of Masterton
burned within him once more, and at times he found himself
forgetting his sufferings and his wrongs. But he never forgot
Masterton. In the position that the latter was he could not
change his name, but he always hugged the thought that Bertin
would not dare return to the Pacific, but, in all probability had
fled to America.</p>

<p>Bertin, under his assumed name, had gained much popularity
amongst the inlands&mdash;always of a generous nature, suffering
had ripened him. Everyone was his friend, and a hundred
unconscious spies kept him posted up in Masterton's movements
when he was cruising in the island. On the other hand, Masterton
had not improved by years. Save by toadies and spongers, who
would fawn on any rich man, he was disliked. Bertin dogged the
<i>Stingray</i> from place to place awaiting his chance.</p>

<p>When he first escaped from New Caledonia his one idea had been
to get Masterton by the throat and never let go his grip until he
had choked the life out of him. Now he had something better in
view. Somehow, whenever chance presented the opportunity he would
get Masterton in his power, and compel him to write a confession
of his guilt and sign it before trustworthy witnesses. For this
reason the schooner was always more than full handed.</p>

<p>The <i>Stingray</i> was on a pleasure cruise, time was no
object, and they were economising coal, it was therefore easy for
the schooner to follow her on to Brown's Range. Bertin felt that
the time had come. If all else failed he would board the yacht
and carry his enemy off by force.</p>

<p>A boat left the schooner containing the trader the skipper,
and two coloured men. At the edge of the reef they met and hailed
the boat returning to the yacht.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the men innocently, "Mr. Masterton was on
ashore alone."</p>

<p>Bertin felt that life had dealt him a hand full of trumps.</p>

<p>Masterton, meanwhile, watched, with little interest, the
approach of the strange boat, which made a better passage through
the reef than did the yacht's boat. A strange kind of apathy had
attacked him, and he felt every now and then a strong and painful
muscular twitching.</p>

<p>The boat ran up on to the beach. Bertin, the captain, and one
of the native boys got out. Masterton felt a thrill of fear go
through even his numbed faculties. Bertin was sun blackened and
bearded, but those eyes! They had haunted him too often in his
dreams for him ever to forget them.</p>

<p>He tried to stretch out his hand to his gun, but his arm shot
out without him being able to control its movements, and his
clutching fingers grabbed a handful of hot sand. He turned his
face, distorted by a hideous grin, towards the approaching men,
while his feet and legs jumped and jerked uncontrollably.</p>

<p>"My God!" cried the captain, as he grasped Bertin by the arm,
"the man is poisoned. I have seen men wounded by poisoned arrows
like that. But there are no natives here."</p>

<p>The boy, who had been looking round, drew the skipper's
attention to the fish and the preparations for a meal.</p>

<p>"He has eaten of the fish of this reef. He must die," said the
boy, in his own tongue.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the captain.</p>

<p>"Only when the rains come can one eat the fish here and live.
He must die, tied up in a knot."</p>

<p>The captain told Bertin.</p>

<p>The paroxysm was now passing. Masterton was awaking to
consciousness&mdash;and terror.</p>

<p>Bertin regarded him grimly. The sight of his enemy had
banished every softer feeling; from the jaws of the grave would
he wrench a confession from the man.</p>

<p>"Masterton, you are a dead man," he said. "Justice has at last
overtaken you. Do me justice before you die?"</p>

<p>Masterton's tongue bud now regained its use. "O for the
&mdash;&mdash; do something tor me. Save me from this agony, and
I will do anything, make every restitution."</p>

<p>The captain whispered to Bertin, "Leighton knows something
about medicine, send off for him, and some morphia."</p>

<p>Bertin nodded. "Have you a doctor on the yacht?" he asked. The
dying man shook his head.</p>

<p>The skipper said a few words to the native, who went back to
the boat.</p>

<p>"Have you strength left to write and sign a confession,
declaring me completely innocent? Otherwise, I recall the
boat."</p>

<p>Masterton groaned an assent. Bertin, who never went without
writing materials lest fortune should at any time deliver his
enemy into has hand, as had happened, produced them. With
faltering hand Masterton wrote out a short confession, which he
signed and the captain witnessed.</p>

<p>They were but just in time; a second paroxysm now attacked the
wretched sufferer with added violence. His frame was racked with
cramp, and his face drawn with twitching, while his hands and
feet beat themselves convulsively on the ground.</p>

<p>"Here's the yacht's boat returning," said the captain, "and
two women in it."</p>

<p>They did what they could to ease the man's torments, which was
but little.</p>

<p>Berlin went to meet the woman as they landed. As he guessed,
it was Masterton's wife, baby son, and nurse.</p>

<p>"Madame," said the trader, raising his hat, "I regret that I
have the worst news for you. Your husband is seriously ill. He
has eaten some poisonous fish."</p>

<p>Mrs. Masterton glanced at him in a frightened, suspicious way,
then hastened to her husband, followed by the nursemaid.</p>

<p>The three sailors in the boat who had overheard the
conversation glanced at one another but said nothing just
then.</p>

<p>Mrs. Masterton was kneeling beside her husband, who was
returning to consciousness.</p>

<p>"We have sent to the schooner for our second mate, who has
studied medicine," said the captain, "he may be able to give him
ease."</p>

<p>"Madame," went on Bertin, from whose breast all pity seemed to
have died, "your husband has written here his last wishes, in
case of the worst happening." He produced the signed confession.
"Will you witness his signature?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Masterton looked at her husband, whose features were
still wrung with agony.</p>

<p>He looked up at Bertin, who bent down to him.</p>

<p>"She need never know," he whispered. "Is the doctor
coming?"</p>

<p>Bertin satisfied him on both questions, and Masterton motioned
to his wife to sign the document, which she did.</p>

<p>"Your maid, too," suggested Bertin. "It is an old business
between your husband and myself of importance. I have followed
him far for his signature."</p>

<p>The girl signed, and the captain of the schooner notified that
their boat was coming back. The boys rowed well, and, knowing the
reefs, made a quick trip. A young man came up to the group just
as the first throes of the paroxysm fastened once more on their
victim. He took a case containing a hypodermic syringe from his
pocket, and without waste of time in words injected a strong dose
of morphia into the sufferer's arm. Although the convulsive
seizures did not at once cease, it was evident that the pain was
deadened.</p>

<p>"Will he die?" sobbed the wife, appealing to him after the
manner of women, as though he held the thread of life in his
hand. Leighton, who had heard all about the case from the kanaka
boy, shook his head. "I can help him to die painlessly, that is
all."</p>

<p>"Have you anyone else on board? Any other passengers?" asked
the captain of the frightened maid. She answered in the
negative.</p>

<p>Bertin and the skipper exchanged a few words</p>

<p>"Madame," said the latter, "I must return on board. Captain
Seacombe and Mr. Leighton will remain to render you all
assistance in their power. I need not say that anything we have
on board the schooner is at your disposal."</p>

<p>He lifted his hat, and went down the beach to his boat, where
the black crew and the white crew were discussing the fish
question.</p>

<p>At sundown, when the western sky was a blaze of red and gold,
of blue set, blue sky, and all the splendour of a tropic eve,
Masterton died.</p>

<p>"I don't want that experience again," said Seacombe, as he
stepped on the deck of the schooner.</p>

<p>Bertin looked inquiringly at him.</p>

<p>"Leighton's morphia seemed to lose its power at the end, and
lockjaw set in. His groans were awful, and he was bent, doubled
up nearly. As Tonga Joe said, he died tied up in a knot."</p>

<p>"And his wife, does she take the body on the yacht?"</p>

<p>"No! Leighton said he must not remain above ground an hour
later than can be helped, or it won't be pleasant to bury him. I
am just going to pick myself up with a nip and a bite, and go
ashore again to read the service over him. The men have gone to
the yacht for tools."</p>

FEW men ever visit Brown's Range. Those who have may have seen
a sight uncommon in an uninhabited atoll of the Pacific&mdash;a
marble tomb, setting forth the virtues of Robert Masterton,
guarded by an elaborate iron railing. His disconsolate widow
revisited the place on purpose to see it erected, and vowed a
yearly pilgrimage to the spot.</p>

<p>Before the end of the year she had married again&mdash;and now
the sand drift has buried half the marble stone, and the iron
railing is rusty and tottering.</p>
