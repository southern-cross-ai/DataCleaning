<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In this work I have endeavoured to portray a phase of life in a
far-away land, a land concerning which we have only too little
knowledge at the present time, though it is one of our Empire's
greatest colonies. I am aware that to make a book composed largely
of real happenings&mdash;especially when one writes for the youth
of the nation&mdash;is a somewhat unusual thing to do. In <i>The
Lost Explorers</i> I have given a tale of gold-digging and of
exploration&mdash;a tale, for the most part, of events that have
actually happened. My characters are all drawn&mdash;however
crudely&mdash;from life; my descriptions are those of one who has
seen and felt in a similar environment. My boys in the story were
real boys, and they dared and suffered and accomplished together.
As for Mackay, he is still a power in the land, ready and willing
always, as he said to his young companions, "to shed the light of
his great knowledge abroad for the benefit of mankind in
general".</p>

<p>The last few chapters of the book are based on an explorer's
natural deductions. We all, who have forced a painful path over
Central Australia's arid sands, hope&mdash;ay, believe&mdash;in the
existence of a wonderful region in the vague mists of the Never
Never Land. Perhaps the very strenuousness of the wish brings about
the belief. Who can say? My descriptions of the strange aborigines
beyond the mystic mountains are not altogether fanciful. In my own
wanderings I have encountered more than one tribe whose mental
development was far in advance of that usually credited to the
untutored savage of the great Island Continent. What I have
written, I have written faithfully, and to the best of my ability.
If <i>The Lost Explorers</i> gives pleasure to my readers, I shall
indeed be more than content.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch1"></a>Chapter 1. A Momentous Decision</h2>

<p>"I'm full up of this ceaseless grind, Jack," suddenly broke out
Robert Wentworth, a tall, slenderly built young man of about
eighteen years of age, throwing down the paper he had been reading
with unnecessary energy.</p>

<p>Jack Armstrong aroused himself from a reverie, and looked up
with an amused gleam in his grey eyes. He was a medium-sized,
squarely built youth about two years the junior of the first
speaker.</p>

<p>"I believe I have heard you say that before, Bob," he said; "but
all the same you echo my sentiments exactly. Still, what can we do?
Our munificent salaries do little more than pay for our board in
these digs"&mdash;he waved his hand comprehensively around the
little room which they shared together&mdash;"and consequently we
haven't saved enough to buy our steam yacht yet!" He laughed with
affected cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Wentworth's strong, studious-looking face clouded
momentarily.</p>

<p>"That's all very well, Jack," he answered severely; "but you
know that there is little chance of our present positions improving
to any extent. Engineering is good enough for the few; but I can
plainly see that life is too short for us to make a fortune at the
game. The fact is," he added, in a more moderate tone, "this
country is too crowded for us, and too old. Everything is
standardized so accurately that we are little more than machines;
and we must exist on our paltry pittances, seeing nothing but grime
and smoke and rain and fogs, until we become old and brain-sodden,
with never a hope beyond the morrow. No, I am tired of
it&mdash;absolutely full up of it." He picked up the discarded
paper once more, and directed Armstrong's attention to a paragraph
under the heading of General News, and this was what the younger
man read&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. James Mackay, who was the only survivor of the ill-fated
Bentley Exploring Expedition in Central Australia, arrived in the
city last night, and is staying at the Central Hotel. It will be
remembered that Mr. Bentley's party was massacred by the blacks
some months ago, the only man escaping being Mr. Mackay, chief
bushman to the expedition, who, fortunately, was not with the
others when they were attacked. It is generally supposed that the
unknown tracks in Western and Central Australia hold vast treasure
of gold and gems in their keeping, and they provide the incentive
which sends the explorer across these trackless wastes."</p>

<p>"So that's the country you would like to go to, Bob," he said
quizzically, "where explorers get killed by the natives?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Wentworth; "but it attracts me all the
same. My only uncle went out to Australia about ten years ago, and
we never heard of him again; I suppose that has given me an
interest in the country, for I remember him well as one of the
finest men one could wish to meet. Anyhow, there can be no gain
without risk, Jack, and I have often thought of trying my luck at
the goldfields in Australia, though I don't suppose there can be
much danger from the natives where they are."</p>

<p>"But there is time enough yet," ventured Armstrong. "We are not
so very old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All the more reason," returned his companion, quickly, "that we
should decide on our future while our brains are fresh. If we
continue on in the same groove here, we'll get so accustomed to it
that we won't want to leave it. No, Jack, I am in earnest. I have
decided to get out of it."</p>

<p>"You can't get out of it without me, Bob," said Armstrong,
quietly. "You know I go with you. We haven't been chums these two
years for nothing. And," he added proudly, "I am as strong as most
men, and able to take care of myself in any part of the world."</p>

<p>Wentworth laughed grimly. "We'll face it together, Jack," said
he.</p>

<p>"And we'll carve our way in it successfully, too," cried the
boy, enthusiastically, now completely won over. "Hurrah for
Australia, the land of gold!"</p>

<p>They arose and clasped hands, Wentworth's face expressing
determined resolve, Armstrong's shining with the light of eagerness
and hope.</p>

<p>Robert Wentworth and Jack Armstrong were chums in the truest
sense of the word. They had been attracted to each other from their
first day of meeting, when Armstrong, whose father had just died
leaving him an orphan, homeless and well-nigh penniless, arrived at
the Clyde Engineering Works, to take up the post secured for him by
a thoughtful friend who understood the boy's independent spirit.
Wentworth had by this time served a year at his profession, but had
made few friends, being too reserved and distant by nature to
please the other apprentices; indeed, these unthinking, though
well-meaning, individuals had grown inclined to misconstrue his
quiet demeanour, until they got a rude awakening. A few of the
rowdier spirits had surrounded Armstrong during the luncheon hour
of his first day among them, and were endeavouring to get as much
fun as they could at the new-comer's expense; and he, poor fellow,
fresh from his sad bereavement, was in no mood to appreciate their
witticisms.</p>

<p>"Can't you let the youngster alone?" said Wentworth, approaching
the group.</p>

<p>They turned in amazement at his interruption; and one of them, a
thick-set, pugnacious lad, inquired contemptuously, if
irrelevantly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, and what could you do, anyhow, Mr. Philosopher? I didn't
think you would care to risk a fight."</p>

<p>"Didn't you?" came the cool response, as the young engineer
calmly doffed his coat. "You will think differently in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>And when he had polished off his antagonist in a scientific
manner that delighted the hearts of the beholders, even the
defeated champion could not forbear his tribute.</p>

<p>"You are too much for me, Wentworth," he said feelingly, when he
had recovered himself. "But I think it was mighty mean of you
deceiving us so long."</p>

<p>After that Wentworth and Armstrong were always together; a bond
of sympathy had sprung up between them, and before long they were
sharing the same room, and were known as David and Jonathan by
their engineering associates. Wentworth's history was none of the
brightest. His father had been a sea captain, and though ten years
had elapsed since he and his ship had gone to the bottom in the
China seas, Bob's memory easily carried him back to their last
parting; and he recalled how, childlike, he had volunteered to take
care of his mother until the captain came back&mdash;and he never
came back. The widowed mother, left with her two
children&mdash;Bob, and his sister Lucy, two years younger than
himself&mdash;knowing how the roaming nature of the father had been
repeated in the son, sought a home as far away from the sea as
possible, and did her utmost on the scanty income left her to give
them both the best of education. But Bob, old beyond his years,
knew more of his mother's struggle than she guessed, and at
fourteen he quietly seized an opportunity that offered, and
apprenticed himself to the well-known firm of engineers already
mentioned&mdash;and told his mother afterwards. And the discontent
which he felt with his somewhat grimy surroundings, though hidden
from his mother and sister, was often and often poured into the
ears of his companion, whose sympathy was ever ready and sincere,
and found culmination in the expression which opens this
chapter.</p>

<p>And now that they had decided on a definite plan of action, they
lost no time in carrying it into effect. So, a few days later,
having called on their employer and explained their reasons for
leaving his service, they directed their steps towards a general
shipping office in order to procure full information concerning the
vessels and routes of sailing to Australia.</p>

<p>When they entered the doorway there were no intending voyagers
engaging the attention of the clerk; but while Wentworth was making
inquiries, some one entered and stood a little way behind the pair,
and beguiled his time while he waited by whistling, most horribly
out of tune, that familiar ballad, "Home, Sweet Home!"</p>

<p>"You can go to Australia by P. and O. or Orient Line, <i>via</i>
the Suez Canal," the clerk reeled off glibly. "Or you may avoid the
heat of the Red Sea by travelling round the Cape in a Shaw Savill,
or New Zealand Shipping Company's boat. To what port do you wish to
sail?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Bob, after a hurried consultation with
Armstrong, "I think the port nearest the goldfields."</p>

<p>"That will be Melbourne," said the spruce shipping clerk, after
some consideration. "Melbourne is the port for Ballarat."</p>

<p>"Go awa' and bile your held or study geography," came a gruff
voice from behind. "You're an old fossil, you are, or you would ken
that the laddies mean Western Australia. Ballarat has seen its day,
but the West is still a land o' promise."</p>

<p>The two boys turned abruptly, while the clerk endeavoured to
cough down his discomfiture. They saw beside them a burly
middle-aged man with a deeply bronzed face, over which the shadow
of a smile was stealing. Even at that moment, as they admitted
afterwards, they both thought they had never seen a more kindly
countenance, in spite of the grim lines around the mouth, which
were only half concealed by a spiky red moustache. But immediately
the interrupter saw the elder lad's face he started back as if
shot, and a tremor seemed to run through his stalwart frame. "As
like as twa peas," he muttered hoarsely, and only Armstrong, who
was close beside him, heard the words.</p>

<p>"And have ye decided to go out to Australia, my lads?" he
inquired kindly, after a moment's pause. "Now, dinna get your backs
up," he reproved mildly, as Wentworth seemed about to resent his
interference, "I like you the better for your independence, but
Australia's a place that is no very weel kent even at this period
o' civilization, and maist certainly ye'll get nae reliable
information from that wooden-heided mummy&mdash;ye'll pardon the
gentle inseenuation," he said, with elaborate politeness, nodding
to his victim behind the desk. "Now, I should ken Australia better
than maist men," he continued, "an' it's my weakness that I should
wish to shed my information abroad for the benefit o' mankind in
general, but mair particularly"&mdash;here he laid a hand on each
of the young men's shoulders&mdash;"would I like to assist young
laddies like yoursel's wha are aboot to venture on so long a
journey."</p>

<p>"We are obliged to you, sir," said Wentworth, gravely and
distantly. "We certainly should like to know something of
Australia."</p>

<p>"We would, indeed," supplemented Armstrong, impulsively holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>The brawny Scot returned the grip; then, addressing himself more
directly to Wentworth, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can see, my lad, that your head's screwed on the richt way,
and I admire you for it; but you're a vera bad judge o' character,
I'm thinkin', if ye canna distinguish between the spontaneous flow
o' the milk o' human kindness, and the fause remarks o' an
interested indiveedual. My name is Mackay," he concluded with
dignity, "Big Mackay they call me in Australia." He paused, and
gazed searchingly at Wentworth. "Now," he added, and strangely
enough there was no trace of the Doric in his language, "you may
come and lunch with me at the Central if you wish, and I'll tell
you about Australia, and if you prefer otherwise, why, there's no
harm done."</p>

<p>He wheeled quickly and strode to the door, but the boys were by
a common impulse at his side before he was half a dozen yards down
the street.</p>

<p>"I am sorry if I appeared to doubt your good intentions, Mr.
Mackay," said Wentworth, "but we are ignorant of the bigger world
which you know so well, and kindnesses from strangers have not
often come our way. But we have heard of you, sir; why, I believe
it was through reading of you in the <i>Herald</i> some days ago
that we decided to go to Australia."</p>

<p>The big man laughed good-naturedly. "You were quite right, my
boy," said he, "but you may ken me better in future. It's no' so
long since I was young mysel'," he concluded with a sigh.</p>

<p>By this time they were entering the hotel, and the boys were
much impressed to observe the many tributes of respect which
greeted their guide. Evidently his strange personality had become
well known during his brief sojourn in the land of his fathers.
Soon they were seated in the dining-room at a table conveniently
remote from the others, and before the meal was finished Mackay was
in possession of the lads' brief histories, and had been informed
of their uncontrollable longing to get away to a new country.</p>

<p>"And your uncle went oot to Australia ten years ago?" he
repeated musingly, when Wentworth told him his story. "Well, well,
Australia is a big country, and it's no likely ye'll meet him
there. Why canna ye content yersel's where ye are?" he demanded
brusquely.</p>

<p>"We can never hope for much if we remain here," argued
Wentworth. "And we should like to have a chance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so," gravely said Mackay, "just so, my young shavers.
Well, I can tell ye this, some folk can do well in any part o' this
wee planet, and others&mdash;and they are in the majority&mdash;are
never much good. Energy and enterprise are what is wanted, and nae
whining after hame&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought," interjected Armstrong, slyly, "that I heard you
whistling 'Home, Sweet Home!' in the shipping office?"</p>

<p>Mackay beamed. "It's very kind of ye to say so," he replied.
"Maist o' my acquaintances asseverate that my whustle is like a
deein' dug's lament, an' no fit to be translated into any tune
whatsoever. But, all the same, Jack, my man, that's a tune I can
only whustle when I am at hame; it makes me think things are no' as
meeserable as they seem. Why, you young scamps, a man should be at
hame anywhere. As for me I'm maist at hame when I'm awa' from hame,
which is what I call a paradoxical statement o' fact for ye to
moralize on. Many years ago," he went on, "I sailed oot o' the
Clyde as chief engineer on one o' the finest boats that was ever
launched, but when I got to Australia and fell in touch wi'
Bentley's exploring expedition, my good resolutions for a quiet
ordinar' existence squelched oot o' me like the wind frae a
punctured bicycle tyre. 'I want ye, Mac,' said Bentley, 'to cross
the Never Never wi' me.' He had another rusty-heided Scotsman in
his company, an auld friend o' mine, an' I said, 'Well, if it's
only to keep that gorilla-faced Pharisee oot o' mischief, I'll
come.' An'&mdash;an' I went, an' I've been living like an
aboriginal ever since; an' now that I've come back to look at my
ain country, I feel like a pelican in the wilderness. I came awa'
to try and forget aboot things an'&mdash;an' it's no'
possible."</p>

<p>Mackay ceased; his eyes seemed to gaze into the distance, and
his good-humoured countenance for the moment became drawn and
haggard. His eager listeners too, felt the spell of his sadness,
and for some minutes there was a sympathetic silence; then
Armstrong spoke. "Will you tell us about it, Mr. Mackay," he asked
gently, and without a word of introduction the big man began his
story&mdash;</p>

<p>"We were three months oot on our exploring journey into Central
Australia, and had come through the usual amount o'
hardships&mdash;suffering from want o' water, occasional skirmishes
wi' the niggers, and other similar trifles, and at this time the
Chief was considerin' that we had a good chance o' cuttin' through
a maist promisin' lookin' tract o' country which had never before
been reached. As it was, we were further into the heart o'
Australia than any explorer had ever penetrated, and every one o'
us was fu' o' enthusiasm aboot our prospects, and dreamed o'
findin' a new Eldorado in this far back country we were enterin'
upon. But one morning, when we were east o' the 125th longitude,
one of the pack camels grew obstreperous, and broke away into the
bush to the nor'-east. We couldn't afford to lose the cantankerous
animal; besides, he carried a fair amount o' our stores on his
back. To make a long story short, I volunteered to track him up and
fetch him back. 'Don't go too far, Mac,' said Bentley to me as I
was starting out, 'I'm none too sure of this district, there may be
natives about.'</p>

<p>"But what did I care about a wheen niggers? 'Ye needna wait for
me,' I shouted back, 'I'll fetch the beastie a' richt, and cut your
trail afore you've travelled a dozen miles.'" Mackay stopped and
sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"And what happened?" asked Wentworth and Armstrong almost with
one breath.</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows, my lads. I never saw any of the party again.
I tracked up Misery&mdash;that was the camel's name&mdash;but he
took me a gey long travel, and it was late at night when I started
to go back, but though I pushed hard to the south'ard until well
into the next day, I couldna pick up a sign o' a track. A camel's
pad is no easily missed, and though the ground was more broken and
hilly than usual, I felt sure I couldna have crossed their route o'
march. Back I went again, examining the ground maist carefully,
then a' at once I got a sair shock. I came on a soft patch o' sand,
and every bit o' it was marked wi' natives' footprints. I could see
the marks o' their big, flat feet everywhere round aboot, and they
telt me as plainly as if I had seen the niggers themselves that
they had come in from the east, and had gone back over their ain
tracks within the last half-dozen hours. I needna tell ye what I
feared then. Though I hadna had a drink o' water nor a bite to eat
since I left the camp, a' thought o' hunger or thirst left me, as I
traced the nigger tracks backwards to the west. They took me
straight to our old camp where Misery had broken away, and what do
you think I saw there?"</p>

<p>The boys shook their heads wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Only bones; bones, in the middle o' a lot o' ashes which were
still warm, and the smell o' burnin' was like the stench o' a
nigger corroboree. I turned again on their tracks. I must have been
mad, for one man could do little against a tribe that had wiped out
one of the finest expeditions that ever ventured into the Never
Never Land, but I was desperate, and I tracked the skunks like a
bloodhound. My throat was parched, my tongue was too big for my
jaws, but I felt that I would gang under wi' pleasure if I could
only get my rifle sights on the brutes first. But I couldna get
even that satisfaction. Before I had gone far I was stopped by a
mountain that seemed to rise like a wall straight from the flats. I
hadn't seen it before, so I may have followed further than I
thought, or maybe the sand haze had hidden it from our view. No one
has ever believed that a mountain like it exists in that country,
and I'm the only white man that knows it to be there. I was too
weak to climb it, and after three or four tries I sat at the bottom
and just raved.</p>

<p>"How I returned beats me yet to understand. The water-bag on
Misery's back was empty, and our last spring charted was fifty
miles to westward, wi' five hundred miles beyond that again to a
mining camp. I'm no navigator, only a bushman, but somehow I got
back, the only survivor of the party, and I felt like a murderer
comin' in alone. I was the Chief's righthand man for ten years, my
lads, and a straighter or better-hearted leader never lived. Then
there was my old comrade Stewart wi' the red hair, wha I used to
misca' so sairly; Pioneer Bill the bushman, and young Morris the
geologist&mdash;they're a' gone, and I'm the puir unfortunate
that's left...I came home here wi' the intention o' stoppin' if I
could; but the bush draws me back and I must go."</p>

<p>"I am very, very sorry," said Wentworth, breaking the pause that
followed; "I can appreciate your feelings most deeply. It must be a
vast country, that Never Never Land."</p>

<p>"It has claimed many a victim, my boy," answered Mackay. "But
Western Australia is not all the same," he hastened to add
cheerfully. "Around Kalgoorlie and north into Pilbarra the richest
gold mines in the world have been found, and it's the thought that
there's a treasure-house o' gold and gems in the far-back land that
makes explorers risk their lives in that awful desert. It's the
chance o' striking Eldorado that sends us wanderers into such out
o' way corners o' the world. But I didna ask ye here to tell ye my
experiences. If you have really made up your minds to go to
Australia, an' I honestly believe it's the best country for any
young man, I'll no' only advise you, but I'll accompany you, and I
can say this, that what I dinna know about gold mining is no' worth
knowing. I have never made a fortune at the game, but there's no
denyin' that fortunes have been made. I've taken a fancy to you, my
laddies, and I'll see that you come to no harm. If ye're short o'
lucre," he continued, "I'll advance ye anything ye need."</p>

<p>Even Wentworth's reserve utterly broke down after this
speech.</p>

<p>"How can we thank you for your goodness?" he said gratefully. "I
for one shall be glad to go with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I feel that I could follow you anywhere, Mr. Mackay," broke
in Armstrong, eagerly.</p>

<p>The elder man smiled grimly. "Maybe ye'll think more seriously
o' these words some day," he replied enigmatically. "Meanwhile, get
awa' hame and make your arrangements without any unnecessary delay,
for we must catch the P. and O. <i>Mongolia</i> at London next
Friday. Like enough," he concluded, with a laugh, "we'll hae mutual
cause for congratulation over our partnership." He shook hands
heartily with each of the lads, and accompanying them downstairs,
watched them disappear into the street.</p>

<p>"Poor young fellows," he said musingly, as he turned away, "I
was just the same mysel' at that age, discontented, ambitious...But
the likeness canna be doubted. Ah, well, I've just done what the
Chief himsel' would have done had he been here."</p>

<p>"Well, Jack, what do you think of him?" asked Wentworth, as he
and his companion walked homewards.</p>

<p>"I think he is the kindest-hearted man I have ever met," was
Armstrong's enthusiastic response.</p>

<p>"I like him, too," admitted Wentworth, "and I expect to like him
more when I know him better. What a strong man he must be; why, his
chest measurement must be nearly fifty!"</p>

<p>"Only a strong man could have endured what he has suffered,
Bob," said Armstrong, "and," with boyish delight, "he must be a
real beauty in a scrimmage. His wrists seemed like bars of
steel."</p>

<p>"He just bears out my opinion," spoke Wentworth, thoughtfully,
"that travel broadens the mind more than is generally allowed, and
destroys all trace of parochialism in a man's nature. I don't
think, for instance," he declared, "that that man would care two
straws whether we were Scotch, English, or Irish; it's humanity
that counts with him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't wander me with philosophical reasoning just now,
Bob," pleaded Armstrong. "All I can say is, that I liked the man
immediately I saw him, and I think we were very lucky in meeting
him."</p>

<p>Never for a moment did these two think of drawing back from the
projected journey. It was characteristic of them to accept their
first decision as final, and the nearness of the day for sailing,
as fixed by Mackay, in no wise appalled them. Neither of them was
given to noisy exuberance.</p>

<p>"Environment has done it, Jack," said Wentworth, sagely. "You
see we have been so much together, and have had so little time for
amusement; then my temperament was always a bit studious, and,
consequently, you have suffered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, Bob," interjected Armstrong; "you talk like an old man,
and you are not nineteen yet. When we get under the sunny skies of
Australia, we'll view things differently, and, who knows, we may
come back with a fortune in a year or two."</p>

<p>"Who knows, indeed?" repeated Wentworth, absently gripping the
boy's arm, and in this way they proceeded until they arrived at
their little room on the top flat of No. 590, Great Southern
Road.</p>

<p>That evening they broke the news of their early departure to
their amiable landlady, Mrs. Campbell, much to that worthy woman's
dismay.</p>

<p>"Eh, but, laddies, ye canna mean it!" she exclaimed. "Ye would
gang to that awfu' country whaur the black bodies
live&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they are not all black, Mrs. Campbell," said Wentworth,
soothingly. "In fact, the aborigines are becoming an extinct
race."</p>

<p>"I dinna care what sort o' race they are becoming," moaned she,
beginning to apply her apron to her eyes. "An' forbye, what dae ye
want to gang oot there for? Ye baith are daein' sae weel in the
engineerin' office, and in time ye micht be managers."</p>

<p>"That's a period too far distant for us to calculate on, Mrs.
Campbell," said Armstrong, cheerily, though he was much distressed
by the good woman's genuine emotion. "And our ambitions are giving
us a shove along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ambitions, ambitions," wailed poor Mrs. Campbell. "And what
should ye want wi' ambitions, at your age? They are nae guid to ye;
in fact it's doonricht wrang for ye to hae them; they've never
brocht happiness to ony man yet!" And she rushed from the room much
affected.</p>

<p>"She's a real good sort," said Wentworth, "but very
unreasonable," with which mature reflection he reached down a copy
of "Raper's Navigation" from a shelf, and began to read
assiduously, while Armstrong, with a whistle of relief, started to
overhaul his wardrobe in preparation for their ocean trip.</p>

<p>The following day was a very busy one for the boys. After
packing their most necessary belongings, they called on Mr. Mackay
to receive his advice as to the outfit required. That gentleman met
them, genial as ever.</p>

<p>"Ocean travel is no the same as it used to be," said he; "an' a'
you'll need is twa or three light suits for the tropics. It's no'
as if you were to be months at sea," he explained, "an' you may
leave your West Australian wardrobe to take care o' itself&mdash;it
will no be much o' a consideration."</p>

<p>But he was not satisfied, nevertheless, until he went round the
shops with them, and saw them fitted out with all that was
needful.</p>

<p>"And now, my lad," he said, when they had finished, addressing
himself to Wentworth, "if you'll tak' my advice, you'll gang hame
and break the news as gently as ye can to your mother, for I can
see ye havena telt her o' yer new plans yet. I'm a great believer
in young fellows shouldering their ain responsibilities as early as
possible, but ye can never get a truer friend than yer mother, an'
I hope ye'll no forget that. I'm a rough hand at preaching, being
mair used wi' other sort o' language, and, and&mdash;&mdash;" Here
Mackay's usually eloquent verbiage failed him, and he floundered
hopelessly. "Be back in good time to leave wi' me for London on
Thursday morning," he finished, recovering himself quickly, and
they turned to go. But Mackay suddenly seemed to remember
something, and he called them back.</p>

<p>"I was thinkin' o' buyin' you some books to read on the ship,"
said he, "and I was wondering how your tastes might lie. I don't
mean novels," he hastened to add, "but books that might serve as a
study."</p>

<p>"We'll leave the choice to you, Mr. Mackay," said Wentworth,
with a smile; and again they departed, yet once more they were
called back. Mackay was evidently ill at ease, for he hesitated in
his speech, and, if possible, his bronzed cheeks became a shade
deeper in colour.</p>

<p>"I've arranged aboot the tickets," he said at length; "so you'll
hae no need to trouble in that direction."</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply he wheeled suddenly, and strode down
the street, leaving the boys rooted to the spot wholly overcome by
the generous speech.</p>

<p>"He must have guessed our one great difficulty," said Wentworth,
flushing deeply. "Well, Jack, our obligations to Mr. Mackay will
take some wiping out."</p>

<p>Later on in the evening, when the boys were talking over the
events of the day in their little room, the landlady entered with a
heavy parcel of books.</p>

<p>"A messenger has just brocht these," said she, "wi' Mr. Mackay's
compliments."</p>

<p>"He is a gem," spoke Jack, emphatically, as he cut the string of
the package, whereupon half a dozen handsome volumes were
disclosed, three for Bob, and three for himself. They seized their
possessions with avidity.</p>

<p>"'Leckie's Navigation,' 'Nautical Almanac,' and 'Burns's
Poems,'" announced Wentworth, gleefully, gazing at his treasures.
"Now, how could he have known that I wanted these so much?"</p>

<p>"'Mining Engineer's Handbook,' 'Metallurgy of Gold,' and
'Shakespeare,'" read out Jack, handling the volumes reverently.
"Now, how could he have guessed our pet studies?"</p>

<p>"It beats me," said Bob. "I won't be surprised at anything
Mackay knows after this. He is a conundrum."</p>

<p>"He is the decentest sort we have ever met," cried Jack,
warmly.</p>

<p>"We agree on that," concurred Bob, gravely.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch2"></a>Chapter 2. Outward Bound</h2>

<p>The few days preceding the sailing of the <i>Mongolia</i> passed
very quickly; Wentworth, accompanied by Armstrong, spent most of
the time at Mrs. Wentworth's home in Lincolnshire. Strangely
enough, Bob's mother did not, in any way, try to dissuade them from
their journey.</p>

<p>"You have the roving instinct of your father, Robert," she said,
with pensive calmness. "I have expected this, and can only pray
that you may be kept safe in the guiding care of the All Wise
Providence which watches over the wanderer on land as on sea."</p>

<p>But his sister had not the same restraint, and it made
Armstrong's tender heart sore to witness the grief of the girl.</p>

<p>"You may be killed&mdash;you may both be killed," she
sobbed.</p>

<p>"There is no fear of that, Lucy," laughed Bob.</p>

<p>"I'll take care of him, Miss Lucy," said Jack, hesitatingly,
almost equally affected.</p>

<p>"Why, you are just a boy," she exclaimed, smiling at him through
her tears.</p>

<p>"I'm only a year younger than Bob," he protested stoutly,
drawing himself up to his full height of five feet seven and a half
inches, and looking at her reproachfully; at which, to Jack's
dismay, she gave way again to her emotion, her beautiful brown hair
falling over her face like a glorious mantle.</p>

<p>"It's for you, too," she murmured brokenly. "Oh, Jack, you are
Bob's chum, and I shall miss you too." Whereupon the usually
light-hearted boy seemed to become a man at once.</p>

<p>"I have no other friends," he said quietly; then he stammered,
"I did not think any one could miss me," he concluded, with just a
trace of pathos in his voice. And at that moment his friendship for
Bob seemed to be riveted afresh, so keenly did the kindly word of
sympathy from the girl appeal to his generous nature.</p>

<p>Prompt to the advertised hour, the P. and O. <i>Mongolia</i>
cast off her moorings and steamed out of Tilbury Docks, and on the
upper deck of the splendid vessel, among the assembled crowd of
passengers, stood Mackay and the two youthful adventurers. They had
arrived in London the night before, and had spent a very pleasant
evening listening to a classic concert in the Queen's Hall which
Mackay had insisted on them hearing. Bob thought their patron and
friend was once more sacrificing himself to what he imagined was
their particular taste; but, to his surprise, that worthy
individual had taken a strong interest in the entire programme, and
especially applauded the young soprano who sang so magnificently a
very difficult Italian aria.</p>

<p>"It's no because I'm a singer mysel'," he explained
apologetically, "and I dinna understan' a word o' the song, but I'm
a wonderfu' lover o' guid music all the same. I think it's sort o'
soothing to my mental faculties."</p>

<p>Jack grinned and looked incredulous, but at that moment the
young lady reappeared in answer to the vociferous demand for an
encore, and soon the haunting strains of "Home, Sweet Home!" filled
the vast hall. Again the doubting youngster looked at his stalwart
neighbour, and lo! the eyes of the ex-bushman were wet.</p>

<p>Now all three watched the receding shores of England with
somewhat sad eyes, and when at last night had fallen, and the
vessel was cautiously feeling her way towards the Bay of Biscay
through a murky fog, they descended to their cabin and began to
arrange their baggage and make preparations for dinner. The next
three days were uneventful, though Jack insisted that his
sufferings in the dreaded Bay were severe enough to warrant mention
in the ship's log. He only of the trio was affected by the rolling
and pitching of the ship, though he had goodly company among the
rest of the passengers. As for Bob and Mackay, they walked the deck
through it all. But even sea-sickness comes to an end, and before
the <i>Mongolia</i> reached Gibraltar Jack was feeling himself
again, and his boisterous spirits did much to infuse a sympathetic
cheerfulness among the rest of the passengers, whose reserve was
beginning to break away as they entered the sunny waters of the
blue Mediterranean. Bob had found endless interest in watching the
various headlands sighted on the Portuguese and Spanish coasts, and
when the frowning Rock of Gibraltar was in sight, his eagerness
became intense. To him history became almost a living thing when he
gazed at the grim monuments of a glorious past. And Mackay was ever
near to instruct and to interest by the narration of more or less
personal experiences of his own in the various ports visited.
Indeed, Mackay's knowledge was little short of marvellous, and the
boys saw many phases of his character during their first week at
sea. The general passengers too soon became interesting to them.
The <i>Mongolia</i> had on board a very representative community.
Some were going to India, not a few to China and Japan, while the
remainder comprised principally Australians from the different
states of the Commonwealth returning home after a visit to the Old
Country. Before Aden had been reached, owing to the genial
influence of the captain, a feeling of good fellowship pervaded the
ship, and the entire company became as one huge family. Deck sports
were a daily occurrence, and concerts and dances took place every
other evening. The sea was calm as glass, flying fish rose in
scattering clouds from the surging wavelets created by the ship's
bows, and porpoises played merrily around the vessel as it dashed
on its unerring course. But on the upper deck the double awning
scarcely obscured the penetrating rays of the scorching sun, and
the close sweltering heat in the cabins below was almost
unbearable. At Aden all the India bound passengers disembarked and
changed into an awaiting vessel which connected with Bombay, and
the time allowed before the <i>Mongolia</i> resumed her course was
amply sufficient to permit of Mackay and his
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> going ashore.</p>

<p>There is not much to attract at this port. It is simply a
military barracks and coaling-station, with an enormous importance,
of course, as a British naval base. Mackay explained this at length
to Jack, who was always eager for information.</p>

<p>"It's the key o' the Red Sea," he announced, "just in the same
degree as Gib. is the key o' the Mediterranean."</p>

<p>"But the Red Sea is not of very much interest to Britain, is
it?" said Bob, questioningly.</p>

<p>"Maybe no, though I canna allow that any part o' His Majesty's
ocean is without its due importance; but, ye see, Aden protects
India by watching the ships that come through the Red Sea, and
forby there's no vessel o' war belonging to another nation could
steam past withoot comin' in for coal&mdash;&mdash;" This in a
burst of patriotic fervour. "Why, when the German Emperor's brother
went oot to China, a year or so back, in his big gunboat, he
touched at nothing but British ports all the way." Mackay chuckled
with amusement at the recollection. "There used to be a tree
growing at Aden," he said again, when they recovered themselves,
"but some one that doesn't believe in oddities has evidently cut it
down."</p>

<p>Nothing but sand and bare rocks could be seen all around, so his
surmise was probably quite accurate.</p>

<p>"Aren't there some huge tanks near here?" asked Bob. "I heard
that they were the only sight worth seeing in Aden."</p>

<p>"You're quite richt; they're no exactly in Aden, being about
five miles back in the hills. But we have just time to visit
them."</p>

<p>He called a waiting garry at once, and directing the Somali
driver, they set out to view the giant reservoirs which date their
origin away back in the mists of antiquity. Bob and Jack looked
very different individuals from what they were a few weeks before.
Dressed in whites, and wearing sun-helmets, they seemed already to
be quite accustomed to the heat; the old tired look had vanished
from their faces, and the light of awakening interest was in their
eyes. As for Mackay, under his big, umbrella-shaped head-covering,
the same kindly face was visible, perhaps a little redder than it
was before, but, as he said himself, it was regaining its natural
tan.</p>

<p>"I believe in harmony o' colour," he gravely said, "and there
should be nae contrast between my moustache and its surrounding
beauties."</p>

<p>When they reached the tanks, which in appearance were as huge
caverns graven out of the solid rock, the engineering training of
the boys was at once evident by their remarks.</p>

<p>"What a mighty work it must have been," mused Bob.</p>

<p>"King Solomon's Tanks," announced Mackay, taking upon himself
the onus of dispensing knowledge, "were built, or rather excavated,
about three thousand years ago. You will observe that they are so
situated as to catch the natural drainage o' the surrounding
country, and when rain fell, which was seldom, the tanks got
filled, and&mdash;and when it didna fall&mdash;of course, they
remained empty!"</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed they both, promptly.</p>

<p>Mackay looked pained.</p>

<p>"Ye shouldna concur wi' my statements so sudden like," said he.
Then he endeavoured to get on to the rails again. "They got silted
up wi' the sand after long disuse," he continued, "and they were
only discovered and re-excavated some years back; but they are of
service to show what an old civilization could do, and to prove
that the climate was different then, for now ye could hardly droon
a mosquito in a' the water they collect." He ceased, then murmured
blandly, "This country is too hot for me to wax eloquent wi' ony
modicum o' pleasure, or I wad go into geo-logical details
concerning it."</p>

<p>"Is there anything you don't know, Mr. Mackay?" inquired Bob,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"No' a thing. I'm a walkin' Encyclopaedia&mdash;just burstin'
wi' knowledge. No, I'm wrang; there's ane or twa metapheesical
matters that beat me. I'll own to that frankly."</p>

<p>Then they returned to the ship, and amused themselves watching
the dusky patriarchal vendors of ostrich feathers who had come on
board, endeavouring to sell their wares. It particularly interested
them to notice how cheerfully these dealers accepted finally less
than a half of their first demands. The Somali diving boys with the
strange yellow hair and the glistening teeth also attracted their
attention. These youngsters, some of them maimed in horrible
fashion, appealed to the sympathy of the passengers by singing in
raucous chorus an aged and once popular London song. The
authorities by this time had forbidden their wonted occupation
owing to the multitudes of sharks infesting the exposed harbour.
Early in the evening the <i>Mongolia</i> once more got under way,
and, with her reduced passenger-list, headed for Colombo, the port
of the spicy Isle of Ceylon.</p>

<p>Among the passengers bound for Australia was a middle-aged,
wiry-looking personage named Carew, whose deeply browned face bore
the unmistakable evidence of long years' sojourn in the tropics.
Mackay had recognized him on the day of embarkation, but had
studiously avoided him ever since.</p>

<p>"He's a famous New Guinea explorer," he informed Bob and Jack,
"but he's a terrible talker, and I'm no vera willin' to be
afflicted wi' his remarks."</p>

<p>Several times, nevertheless, the boys noticed that Carew always
gazed doubtfully at Mackay when they chanced to meet on deck, and
on each occasion that individual would reply with a stare of
studied nonchalance. However, after leaving Aden, the passengers
were so much reduced that they were all thrown into daily contact
with each other, and occasionally Mackay found himself on the same
side as Carew in the course of a cricket-match. But it was after
they had left the Island of Socotra two days astern that any
definite conversation passed between them. A match had just been
concluded between the "Weary Wayfarers" and "The New Chums," two
delightfully named opposing teams made up from the greatest
travellers on board and the more or less untravelled community, and
the "Weary Wayfarers" had been summarily defeated. Bob and Jack
were shining lights at such contests, and Bob's bowling had on this
occasion been mainly responsible for the downfall of the Wayfarers,
while Jack on his part had made the top score of his side. Carew
and Mackay were making a straight course for the smoke-room when
the former gentleman broke out abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been trying a long time to remember, Mackay, where I met
you before, and now I've got it. There couldn't be another phiz
like yours in the whole of this wretched planet."</p>

<p>"I ken my personal adornments are a rare gift," placidly
returned the Scot, "and, to return the compliment, I may say I've
never been surprised at your many marvellous escapes from the New
Guinean cannibals."</p>

<p>"And why so?" queried Carew, much pleased.</p>

<p>"Because a sicht o' your figure-head would destroy any nigger's
appetite, an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I give you best, Mackay; I give you best," hastily interposed
the other. "But weren't you with Bentley's Expedition in New Guinea
four years ago? Oh, I'm sure of you now. Where did you leave
Bentley?"</p>

<p>By this time they were snugly ensconced in a corner of the
smoke-room. Mackay solemnly rang the bell.</p>

<p>"He went under on the last expedition in the West," he said
grimly, when the steward had attended to their requests,&mdash;"I
was the only one that escaped."</p>

<p>Carew gave a cry of genuine pain. "Poor Bentley," he muttered
brokenly, "another one gone in that accursed country, and I never
knew. We pioneers don't get much of an obituary notice,
Mackay."</p>

<p>Mackay silently agreed. "Don't speak about it before these
youngsters of mine," he said. "They're going out to the West with
me, and I don't want them to be discouraged."</p>

<p>He rose to go, but just then Bob appeared. "There's a small
island on the port bow, Mackay," he announced. "Can you tell me
anything about it? I can't find it on the chart."</p>

<p>"It's the coral isle called Minacoy," volunteered Carew, looking
out. "It's the most southerly atoll of the Laccadive group of
islands, and when the sea is rough it is almost invisible."</p>

<p>They all went out to have a look. The <i>Mongolia</i> passed
quite close to the coral beach, and though the sea was calm the
roar of the surge beating on the shallows was plainly heard. A tall
lighthouse with a background of palms was observable, and a
solitary watcher came out while they gazed and waved a friendly
greeting.</p>

<p>"What a lonely life the lighthouse keeper's must be!" said Jack,
and he expressed the sentiments of all.</p>

<p>arrived at Colombo, and here the boys saw much to interest them.
The spacious harbour with its huge artificial breakwater was in
itself a great attraction, and they watched the clouds of spray
that dashed full fifty feet into the air all along the guarding
barrier with keen delight. But on shore the rickshaw rides
surpassed all other forms of amusement. They visited the far-famed
Cinnamon gardens in these strange vehicles, they tried races along
the Galle Face road, and lastly rickshawed with Mackay to Mount
Lavinia some five miles distant from the town. The Cingalese gem
merchants who swarmed everywhere were a source of wonder to them.
They marvelled how so many seemingly needy individuals possessed
such stores of rubies, diamonds, sapphires, and pearls, and which,
according to their demands, were worth a prince's ransom. Mackay
only laughed when Jack mentioned his surprise at their apparent
affluence.</p>

<p>"You want to develop your powers o' observation, my laddie,"
said he, enigmatically; and Jack, not quite understanding the
rebuke, was in no wise edified. Bob, too, was rather impressed by
the courtesy of the same fraternity.</p>

<p>"Master," an odd-looking personage in flowing garb and with
plaited hair would say, "Master, you buy goodie ruby from me?" and
at once a string of somewhat similarly attired merchants would
gather round and watch the expected process of bargaining silently.
But they were not quite as innocent and free from guile as they
looked.</p>

<p>"What do you think of this, Bob?" cried Jack, holding up a huge
crystal, which a smiling Cingalee with a strange little basket for
a cap had proffered him for sale. They were sitting under the
revolving fans in the Hotel Bristol, watching the gay panorama of
colour that constantly flitted before them. Mackay had left them to
their own devices for an hour or so, and they were now awaiting his
return.</p>

<p>Bob examined the gaudy crystal with pretended keenness.</p>

<p>"No good; it's only glass," he said shortly, never dreaming that
his idle statement was correct.</p>

<p>"No glass! no glass!" earnestly asserted the Cingalee. "White
sapphire, goodie stone. You try," he added, as a final proof of his
honesty; "you tramp so." He placed the stone under his slippered
foot, and pressed ever so lightly. "You try," he implored, handing
the stone to Bob, whom he now regarded as the one obstacle to the
sale of his treasure. "If glass it break."</p>

<p>"The poor beggar seems honest," said Jack, feeling quite sorry
for the man. "How much?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Five pounds, master."</p>

<p>"I don't want the stone," said Jack, "and anyhow I haven't got
five pounds in my pocket. I'll give you one pound for it," he
concluded jokingly. Before he had fully realized it the gem was
his, and the late owner was exhorting him to secrecy concerning the
sacrificial price it had commanded. "Other men no like me selling
so cheap," he explained, then vanished hurriedly as Mackay
entered.</p>

<p>"And so you've bought a sapphire," he said with a chuckle, when
Jack proudly displayed his purchase. "How much did ye gie for it?
Sixpence?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it genuine?" asked Bob. "I said it was glass; but he
asked me to stamp on it."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, that's an old trick; he chanced ye no' takin' him at
his word." He placed the doubtful stone beneath the toe of his
shoe, and in an instant nothing remained but powdered glass. Jack's
dismay was great, and noting it, Mackay patted the boy cheerily on
the back. "It's a grand thing to have faith in human nature," he
said kindly. "And I'd rather see you mak' a mistake that way than
the other way. A' the same when you go oot into the world it's
surprising how much deceit you see."</p>

<p>After a stay of a day and a half the <i>Mongolia</i> entered
upon the longest phase of her journey across the equator and down
by the north-western coast of Australia to Fremantle. Several more
passengers had been left at Colombo including those bound for the
farther East, who continued their journey by connecting boat, so
that the ship's party was now very small indeed. To the boys'
surprise the heat experienced when crossing the line was nothing
compared with that already felt in the Red Sea; but Mackay was not
wanting with his explanation.</p>

<p>"The desert sands on both sides o' the Red Sea absorb the heat
and intensify it," explained he, "so that the winds that blow from
either east or west are like blasts oot o' a furnace, while here
the winds are tempered by passing over hundreds o' miles o'
sea."</p>

<p>"In any case," added Carew, who was standing near, "there are no
sandy stretches in this part of the world, and the prevailing
breezes blow in from the sweet-scented islands of Java and New
Guinea."</p>

<p>"I was o' the opinion," began Mackay, after some thought,
severely eyeing the last speaker, "that this information bureau was
my funeral. I was aboot to send oot twa or three chunks o'
knowledge when you interrupted, and noo my inspiration's
vanished."</p>

<p>Carew laughed good-naturedly. "Never mind, Mackay," said he; "I
will relieve you for a bit, and entertain Wentworth and Armstrong
by spinning them a true yarn. Get your deck-chairs all, and prepare
for something thrilling."</p>

<p>By the time Carew was ready to start nearly every passenger on
board was clustered round him in eager expectation.</p>

<p>"Two years ago," he began, in reminiscent tones, "I was camped
on a tributary of the Fly River in New Guinea, which was a most
unhealthy district to camp in, owing to the fact that two rival
cannibal tribes had their quarters close handy. However, I wanted
to prospect for gold and gems in the surrounding country, and so
decided to take all risks. But in order to minimize these risks as
much as possible, I paid a visit to the chief or Mamoose of what I
imagined to be the more powerful of the two tribes, and presented
him with the only article in my camp I had no use for&mdash;an
alarm clock. The old boy was quite delighted with it, and promptly
insisted on wearing it hung from a chain around his neck; not only
that, but when I showed him how to wind it up and ring the alarm,
he immediately informed his warriors that it was a charm which
would ensure success in all battles. Indeed, he wanted to start
right then and march against the Tugeris, his warlike neighbours,
but while I was arguing the point with him&mdash;I didn't want any
circus in the vicinity at that time&mdash;the 'Che-ep! Che-ep!' of
these wretched Tugeris sounded through the trees. They had
evidently anticipated attack at this period and so were taking time
by the forelock. On they came, shouting that peculiar battle-cry of
theirs which gets on one's nerves so quickly. The old Mamoose, with
the clock anchored firmly round his neck, sailed in to meet them at
the head of his warriors, and I made lightning tracks in the
opposite direction. All next day I waited down the river with my
canoe in readiness. If the clock Mamoose won, I was safe as a
house; if he didn't I was as good as cold meat if I didn't get out
lively. I was getting mighty nervous, and couldn't quite see how I
was to know which side won, when, all of a sudden, a huge crocodile
hove out of the water close beside me, and at that instant the
noise of an alarm clock going off sounded out of his gaping mouth
like a piano prelude through a gramophone trumpet. That fixed it,
gentlemen. I won't go into my theories as to how the clock got
there. They were strong enough for me, and I scooted, and a good
job too, for when I was at Port Moresby some weeks later I was told
that the Tugeris had fairly swept the country."</p>

<p>"Ye certainly had a maist providential warning," spoke Mackay,
dryly, breaking the dubious silence that followed.</p>

<p>"Come on, Mackay," said Carew, leading the way to the
smoke-room.</p>

<p>"Right you are," retorted the other; and they departed arm in
arm, much to the amusement of the assembly.</p>

<p>Three days later they sighted the Cocos group of islands on the
horizon, and in a very short time were passing quite close to the
largest of them. Nothing but a forest of palms could be seen at
first, then a slight indentation on the coast line revealed a
schooner and several smaller craft lying at anchor in front of a
row of native dwellings.</p>

<p>"The first king of these islands," Mackay informed the lads,
"was a Glasgow Scotsman. Old King Ross did a wonderful amount o'
pioneering work in these seas, and hoisted the British flag here
without the assistance of a gunboat. He was a strange man, and knew
well how to handle the natives."</p>

<p>"But what do they do?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"They grow cocoanuts and make copra, my lad; they find a good
market for it in Colombo and Singapore."</p>

<p>"Are all the islands in this part of the Indian Ocean of coral
formation?" asked Bob, looking at the white low-lying shores with
interest.</p>

<p>"Oh no," laughed Mackay, "there's Christmas Island, for
instance, about five hundred odd miles east of these, and it is
nothing short of a mountain, and its shores go down into the water
almost as steep as the side of a house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, Mackay," interrupted Carew, petulantly, "how do you know
anything about Christmas Island? It's the most ungetatable place on
the face of the earth, and I've heard that very few white men have
ever been there."</p>

<p>"I'm one of the few," imperturbably answered Mackay. "I sailed
there from North Australia in a pearling lugger," he condescended
to explain.</p>

<p>"And do they grow copra there too?" inquired an interested
bystander.</p>

<p>"Oh no; it's a guano island and belongs to the Christmas Island
syndicate. A very fine paying concern it is too, though the island
is not more than twenty miles or so in circumference."</p>

<p>"I didn't think guano islands were much good to any one,"
hazarded Bob.</p>

<p>"Didn't you? Well, that's no' surprisin', seein' that we don't
hear much about them; but I know a man who has a steam yacht, and
he keeps constantly explorin' the ocean for guano islands. It's a
good payin' business right enough, though I wouldna care much aboot
diggin' phosphates mysel', gold bein' more my attraction."</p>

<p>To the boys the idea of unknown islands in these latitudes was
distinctly pleasing. The world to them was taking on a less crowded
aspect. The smiling sea still held her unknown Crusoe islands. The
romance had not all gone from the earth. The days were passing very
quickly now, soon Fremantle would be reached, and then&mdash;who
knew what good fortune might speedily be theirs? Bob and Jack
looked into the future with unhesitating eyes. Theirs had been no
boyish whim, and as they neared Australia's coast their pulses
quickened, the sense of freedom was in their blood, the spirit of
conquest surged through their hearts; and Mackay, noting their
steady courage, felt strangely cheered. On the evening before the
<i>Mongolia</i> was expected to reach Fremantle a concert was held
in the saloon, in order to bring together for the last time the
entire assembly, for quite a number were disembarking at Fremantle;
and Bob and Jack were singled out for special adulation by the
chairman&mdash;none other than Mr. Carew&mdash;who warmly wished
them Godspeed in the new country they were entering upon.</p>

<p>"They, like us all," he said in his laudatory address, "seek
their Eldorado. To them it is something real, tangible; to us who
have chased the elusive phantom it has somewhat lost its zest. But
youth and courage shall conquer where the weary wanderer must fail,
and I fully expect our boys to attain their ambition by sheer manly
grit before they have time to grow weary of the pioneer's life.
They are especially fortunate," he continued, looking towards
Mackay, "in having the guiding care of an old and experienced
traveller&mdash;one whose deeds always speak louder than his words,
but whose speech when occasion demands is forcible and conclusive.
Only an explorer can fully appreciate a brother explorer's work; I
take off my hat to you, Mackay&mdash;&mdash;" his hat was already
off, but that didn't matter&mdash;"and when we meet again, I trust
it may be in some cheerful spot in this little planet and not in
the wilds of an unknown land."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch3"></a>Chapter 3. Golden Flat</h2>

<p>The small settlement of Golden Flat was situated away out on the
desert's fringe beyond Kalgoorlie, and beyond the reach of any
civilizing railway. It was essentially a pioneer's field, for no
deep lodes had yet been discovered; indeed, at this time the
history of Golden Flat was but a few days old. Nuggety Dick, a
roving prospector and miner, had been lucky enough to find rich
specimens of the coveted metal on the surface of the flat during
one of his perambulating journeys through the silent bush, and
instead of wildly rushing back to Kalgoorlie to proclaim his
"strike," he had quietly taken a note of the place and gone his way
to inform his old associates, who were toiling with but little
success on a worked-out alluvial patch near Coolgardie.</p>

<p>Such is the spirit of the bush; comradeship comes before all,
and happy-go-lucky Dick had never once thought of applying for the
standing reward which a shrewd Government had promised for
discoveries of gold in such remote districts. Had he claimed it, a
rush would have been the immediate consequence, and the chances of
Dick's companions securing a favourable claim would have been
reduced to a minimum; so he set out on his high-backed camel and
rounded up the "boys," as he affectionately called them, and
steered them back to the ironshot plain among the mulga scrub,
which he had euphoniously, if ambitiously, termed "Golden Flat."
And now, within a week after their arrival, the Flat presented
every appearance of industrious energy. Further nuggets had been
found all along the line of a scarcely perceptible depression in
the land surface, which, nevertheless, most evidently marked the
course of a very ancient waterway, long since silted up.</p>

<p>"It'll be an alluvial wash, boys," remarked Dick, with happy
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It certainly looks mighty promising," agreed a lanky and lean
individual, who rejoiced in the cognomen of the Shadow. The Shadow,
so called because of his rather fine outline, was the youngest of
the party; indeed, he was little more than a boy in years, yet his
reputation as a skilled bushman and rough rider was great, and the
strength concealed in his spare figure was marvellous.</p>

<p>"I say, mates," broke out another typical bushman, Never Never
Dave by name, popping his head out of a shaft near by, "I do
believe I've struck the stuff on the ten-foot level."</p>

<p>He clambered out of his excavation and approached the party, who
were at this moment assembled for the purpose of preparing lunch,
displaying in his hand a white sugary-looking substance which he
had evidently broken from the supposed wash. The Shadow gave a
whoop of delight, but was immediately checked by an old miner
beside him, whose keen eyes and heavily furrowed face bespoke the
hardy pioneer.</p>

<p>"Don't yell out so soon, young 'un," he reproved sternly. "Gold
is a most deceitful phantom, and it's when you're sartin you've got
it, that it ain't there."</p>

<p>"Eight O!" sang out the irrepressible one, rushing to get a pan
of water from the soak near by. "Eight O, Dead Broke."</p>

<p>"When he reappeared he found them all examining the sample wash
with critical interest; and as it was handed round for inspection,
not a word was spoken; not a trace of joy or emotion showed in the
rugged features of the men who depended so much on the result, and
even the Shadow, when he handled the specimen, felt constrained to
copy the tactics of his neighbours. The conglomerate stone was
literally studded with gold; it required neither the pan test nor
the magnifying glass to prove that.</p>

<p>"It's too good to last, boys," commented Nuggety Dick, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>That broke the spell.</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything like it," grunted Dead Broke Dan,
blinking furiously.</p>

<p>"Hoorah for Golden Flat!" broke out the Shadow, tossing his
tattered hat into the air. "Hip, hip, hip, hoorah!"</p>

<p>And, taking his lead, the silent group of a few minutes before
broke into a lusty cheer that echoed and re-echoed over the plains.
But it had scarcely died away when Emu Bill, a somewhat silent
member of the party, astonished his associates by giving vent to a
groan of deep disgust.</p>

<p>"Look what's coming, boys," said he, nodding his head toward the
west. "Hang me if it isn't the beginning of a regular rush!"</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="i053" id="i053"></a><img src=
"2300241h-images/i053.jpg" alt="LOOK WHAT'S COMING, BOYS">
</p>

<p class="caption">"Look what's coming, boys!"</p>

<p>All looked in the direction indicated, and sure enough there
appeared to be ample reason for annoyance. Cresting a slight
eminence surrounding the Flat, three figures hove into sight,
pacing slowly alongside a heavily laden camel, and that they were
coming to Golden Flat camp there could be no room for doubt.</p>

<p>"After me bein' so careful, too," complained Dick, sorrowfully.
"Now I suppose we'll have all Kalgoorlie sprinting up before
sundown."</p>

<p>"Look to your boundary-pegs, mates," warned Dead Broke Dan, "an'
stick up your miners' rights on the corner posts. They may be
bush-lawyers for all we know."</p>

<p>In an instant the camp awoke to action, axes and spades were
seized, measuring tapes were run along the boundary lines of their
holdings, new pegs were driven into position, and miners' rights
flaunted in the sunshine, marking a fluttering course of six
hundred yards along the auriferous bed. In the midst of the
confusion the three travellers arrived, and one of them, a strongly
built individual, whose entire wardrobe consisted only of an
open-necked shirt, and nether garments held in position by a
well-filled cartridge belt, leaving his companions by the camel,
stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Hullo, boys," he grunted affably, addressing every one in
general who was disposed to hear. "I said 'Hallo,'" he repeated
sternly, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>The rebuke was too much for Emu Bill, who had been calmly and
leisurely engaged cutting his initials in his corner boundary-peg.
He came forward quickly.</p>

<p>"Hallo, mate," he said, eyeing the new-comer keenly. "Mebbe
ye'll excoose the boys for attendin' to Government regulations
afore rushin' to say how mighty glad they are to see
ye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye insignificant son o' a gun," came the prompt interruption,
"if ye dinna modify your insinuations, I'll&mdash;I'll, swipe the
head off ye, an' it would hurt me sair to destroy ane o' my old
comrades in cauld blood."</p>

<p>Bill, at the dire threat against his person, had languidly begun
to prepare for mortal combat, but on hearing the last part of the
aggressive speech, he gazed at the stranger in incredulous
amazement.</p>

<p>"By the Great Howling Billy it's Mackay!" he yelled, seizing his
erstwhile enemy's hand and shaking it vigorously. "I thought you
had gone home to the old country, you tough old rooster."</p>

<p>"I did have a trip home," said Mackay, for it was he, smiling
grimly. "But I discovered that civilization didna agree wi' me, so
I came back."</p>

<p>By this time the rest of the miners had hastened up, and Emu
Bill addressed them excitedly.</p>

<p>"Boys, it's Mackay!" he cried.</p>

<p>Nuggety Dick and his satellites hesitated a moment, then rushed
forward with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"What have you done with your whiskers, Mac?" they cried almost
in unison.</p>

<p>"That's it," roared Emu Bill, looking questioningly into the now
welcome visitor's face, "and it nearly caused a funeral. Hang it
all, why didn't ye say who ye was? We thought you was the beginning
of a rush, we did. Fetch your mates along and let us have lunch at
once. After that you may stake out where you like."</p>

<p>"Beggin' your pardon, Emu," broke in Nuggety Dick, "I has a
double-barrelled-nineteen-carat-pleasant dooty to perform." He
turned to Mackay, and with grave dignity proceeded. "As discoverer
o' this here Golden Flat, an' representin' the interests o' every
scarecrow present, I say we welcome you and your mates wi' tearful
emotion. Am I right, boys?" he demanded confidently, looking at his
companions.</p>

<p>"Hoo-rah!" came the unanimous response.</p>

<p>Mackay smiled just a trifle strangely, and beckoned to Bob and
Jack, who had been watching the trend of events with somewhat
anxious eyes.</p>

<p>It would have been hard to recognize in the two who now came
forward the same young men who had inveighed so strongly against
their restricted lot in the Old Country. Dressed in the negligent
attire of the bush, with broad brimmed hats shading their eyes from
the scorching sun, they looked like young Colonials fresh and fit
for any effort that might be required of them. Their journey from
the coast to Kalgoorlie had interested them exceedingly; the wide
tracts of lonely bush land which stretched to north and south of
the single line, gave them an impression of boundless scope which
was dear to their hearts. Here surely was a country where no man
need jostle his neighbour. Coming as they did from a tightly packed
centre of commerce, it was little wonder that a sense of freedom
entered their beings. And when they arrived at the strange hustling
gold-mining city of the plains, their enthusiasm was great. Mackay
had been wonderfully reticent as to his immediate plans. "Even here
nothing stands still," said he, "and there may have been new gold
discoveries since I left." But his inquiries in Kalgoorlie seemed
to please him greatly. "It's all right, my lads," he announced to
them with great good humour when he returned to the Exchange Hotel
where they were staying pending his investigations.</p>

<p>"The fact is," he whispered mysteriously, drawing the boys
aside, "I found gold on one o' our last expeditions before we
tackled the Never Never, a good bit to the east o' this, and though
we never said a word aboot it to any one when we got back, I was
afraid some sandgroping fossicker had bumped across the place while
I was awa'. Hooever, I've made judicious inquiry, and find there's
been nary a rush in that direction, so we'll outfit at once and get
a move on. I've been lucky enough to buy back my old camel, Misery,
for the journey."</p>

<p>So they arrived at Golden Flat, Mackay never once hesitating in
his course, though there were no landmarks to guide. The bushman's
instinct was strong, unerringly it lead them to their goal; and now
that they had reached the scene they had been picturing in their
minds, the unexpected meeting with earlier arrivals disconcerted
them not a little. They advanced at Mackay's call somewhat sharply;
they had not quite understood the wordy discourses of the miners,
and they were aggressively prepared to stand by their friend should
occasion arise.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Mackay, addressing the odd assembly, "allow me to
introduce two young friends of mine from old England&mdash;Robert
Wentworth and Jack Armstrong, Bob and Jack for short&mdash;they've
come out here to make their fortune, and by the Lord Harry! they'll
do it or I'm a Dutchman."</p>

<p>With honest welcome beaming in their eyes, the rugged miners
advanced one by one to greet their visitors, but Nuggety Dick must
needs call them to order.</p>

<p>"Can't ye wait fur me to interdooce ye in civilized manner, ye
howlin' galoots," he admonished severely. "I hiv to blush fur yer
ignorance, I has." Then he hitched up his nether garments, ejected
a quid of tobacco from his mouth, coughed discreetly, and
began&mdash;</p>

<p>"As discoverer o' this 'ere Golden Flat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You stop right there, Nuggety," interjected Mackay. "If ye'll
take the trouble to look at the side o' that tree ahint your tent
you'll observe that my autograph is carved thereon, together with
the date of discovery. Now, while you go and satisfy yoursel', I'll
dae the introducin'. Emu Bill"&mdash;the tall bushman stepped
forward and shook hands with the lads&mdash;"is a very decent sort
o' indiveedual. A bit cantankerous, saving wi' his speech, and I
would hae some hope for him if he wasna sae perneeciously given to
makin' poetry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get out, Mac&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dead Broke Dan!" The veteran of the camp strode forward. "A
guid solid and straight man who has done his best to mak' every
man's fortune but his ain. Never Never Dave"&mdash;that individual
with the Shadow had already anticipated the formal introduction,
and was listening with delight for his qualifications&mdash;"is a
weary wanderer, like mysel', only withoot my unquestionable
abilities. And the Shadow"&mdash;that guileful youth suddenly
became engaged in earnest conversation with Bob&mdash;"the Shadow,
I say, is a youth wha's greatest misfortune is his extraordinar'
habit o' neglectin' the commandment which says, youngsters should
be seen but never heard. For a' that he's a guid
laddie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, boss," ejaculated the victim, smilingly, "if ye'll write
that down I'll send it to my Sunday-school teacher in
Melbourne."</p>

<p>"You were quite right, Mackay," said he. "Is there any other
place in the whole country you hasn't struck your name on?"</p>

<p>Mackay's face relaxed into a broad smile.</p>

<p>"We'll divide the honours, Nuggety, my man," he answered
magnanimously; and with one accord they all made their way to the
tree behind Nuggety's tent to gaze at the symbol which justified
Mackay's claim. There it was, cut deeply into the hard wood, and
almost obliterated with enclustering moss, "J. M. 1898."</p>

<p>Bob examined the letters with something akin to awe. Jack
laughed gleefully; the others crowding round seemed ill at ease.
Mackay guessed their thoughts intuitively.</p>

<p>"My claim has lapsed, boys," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Not by a single peg," protested Nuggety Dick. "We don't need no
Government to tell us what to do. We know the ground is yours by
the all-fired right o' discovery, a right which touches us right
down on our most tender feelings."</p>

<p>"We've just struck it rich, but we'll git all the same," said
Never Never Dave; and a sympathetic murmur of approval greeted his
words. The bushman's code of honour is Spartan in its
simplicity.</p>

<p>Again Mackay smiled, and all trace of hardness had gone out of
his voice when he made answer.</p>

<p>"Boys, ye have spoken as I knew ye would speak, and it does my
heart good to look at you all again, and feel that the same old
sympathies are with us still. But the true discoverer of Golden
Flat was the leader of the expedition who piloted his party so well
until the end, and I ken he wouldna have me turn you away. No,
boys, there's room enough for us all; my mates an' me will peg out
claims at the end o' the lead; the chances o' strikin' the wash are
a' equal." He paused, and gazed sadly at the half-obliterated
inscription on the tree, unheedful of the deep appreciation with
which his words were received. "If it's my good fortune to make a
rise on Golden Flat," he continued, with grave solemnity, "I mean
to devote it a' on an expedition into the Never Never. I want to
see again that mountain which kept me back. I want to have a word
with the tribe that lives behind it...."</p>

<p>"I'll be with you, Mac," quietly spoke Emu Bill.</p>

<p>"And me, fur a dead cert!" said Nuggety Dick.</p>

<p>"Put Never Never Dave's name on the programme," grunted that
worthy.</p>

<p>"And mine," echoed Dead Broke Dan.</p>

<p>"You can bet your shirt I'll be with you," cried the Shadow.</p>

<p>"There's only you and me left, Jack," said Bob. "But we'll be
there too."</p>

<p>"And now let us have lunch, boys," suggested Nuggety Dick,
breaking the odd silence that ensued; and they walked away, leaving
Mackay still gazing at the fateful tree with unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor old Mac," muttered the Shadow, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Did you know him before?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"I should say I did. Why, he put me on to the only paying gold
show I ever worked. That was two years back. He was one o' the
Coolgardie pioneers too, and, of course, every one who was there
knows him."</p>

<p>"Ah, that was a great old time," mused Emu Bill, entering into
the conversation. "Mackay made a bit o' a rise then, and he might
have been a rich man now if he hadn't taken the Never Never
fever."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, boys," said Nuggety Dick, hastily adding a
handful of tea to the boiling billy, "Mackay is the straightest man
that ever chased nuggets, and this here camp will see that he
doesn't tackle that miserable desert again without us skirmishin'
alongside."</p>

<p>"Let us drink good luck to Golden Flat, boys," cried the
individual in question cheerily, coming up from behind, and seizing
a pannikin of tea.</p>

<p>"Good luck to Golden Flat&mdash;and to its discoverer!" replied
they all, standing up and drinking the toast heartily.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the three new-comers set off to peg out their
claims on the golden channel, and erect their tent. The others
would have accompanied them in a body to assist in the work, but
Mackay, while thanking them, firmly refused their services.</p>

<p>"I want to initiate my partners into the rules o' the business,"
he explained, "an' the best way to teach them is by showing the way
and watching them do it. No, no, boys, you had better go and burrow
in your shafts, we'll engineer our own funeral."</p>

<p>The slight depression which indicated the presence of the golden
channel below, ran in a north and southerly direction, and could be
traced without difficulty for fully five hundred yards, after which
it merged into the open plain, but the line of workings did not
extend much more than halfway down this length.</p>

<p>"These old water-courses," said Bob, who had been thinking
deeply, "must have belonged to a very ancient period, when the
whole aspect of the country was different."</p>

<p>"Because," returned Bob, hesitatingly, "there are no mountains
here now, no water-sheds at all, and the gold must have been
carried by a flow of water from somewhere. The whole country must
have been sunk under the sea, then, after a long time, upheaved
again higher than it was before. The volcanic disturbances must
have destroyed all its original features."</p>

<p>"Do you ken, Bob, my lad," said Mackay, earnestly, "I like to
hear you speak like that. It shows ye've got some pro-fundity o'
thought, an' I quite agree wi' your argument."</p>

<p>A cry of delight from Jack broke in on their geological
discussion. That very eager youth had unconsciously adopted the
tactics of the experienced prospector by eyeing the ground closely
as he walked, and his keenness had not gone unrewarded, for he now
displayed a dull yellow specimen between his finger and thumb.</p>

<p>"Ay, it's gold, sure enough," was Mackay's verdict, when he had
glanced at it, "and it weighs fully an ounce if I'm any judge.
Jack, my boy, ye'll beat us a' at this game yet. That's five pounds
ye've made in the time it would take to blink an eye. You'll mak' a
grand prospector, Jack. Put that bit in your pocket, and keep it
aye as a memento; you'll think a lot o' it afterwards."</p>

<p>"But it's really yours," said the lad, refusing to take it back.
"I'm not going to take everything of yours and keep all I get
too."</p>

<p>Poor Jack was embarrassed. His was one of those generous natures
which can never forget a kindness, and Mackay had behaved more like
a brother than a mere friend.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, laddies," grunted Mackay, "we're goin' to be partners
wi' equal shares&mdash;and from what I can see already I think I'm
vera fortunate in having you wi' me&mdash;but first specimens
should be ootside the arrangement altogether. Take the bittie gold,
Jack, and I hope I'll live to see it in your ain home years after
this."</p>

<p>They had by this time reached the end of the channel, at least
so far as surface indications were concerned, and Bob once more
propounded a theory.</p>

<p>"Is it not right to assume," said he, "that though we cannot
trace the water-course any further on the surface, it must be there
all the same?"</p>

<p>"Quite correct," answered Mackay; "but it may have changed its
direction, an' it may have divided into smaller channels."</p>

<p>"But just here where it apparently disappears," persisted Bob,
"may not some obstacle have deflected the current, or made the sand
pile up and so raised the true bed upwards, making the original
sides of the gully shallower at this point, and accounting for its
being filled up level with the surrounding country before the
deeper parts got wholly silted up?"</p>

<p>"Go on, my lad," prompted Mackay, patting the young man's
shoulder, "allowin' what ye say to be right; what sort o' deduction
do you arrive at?"</p>

<p>"I should think," said Bob, with growing eagerness, "that the
gold would stick on the rise more than on the level, and that if we
sank our shaft just over the apparent break of the channel we would
most likely strike it rich."</p>

<p>"It seems good sound logic, Bob," commented Mackay, in
reflective mood, "but as I'm a practical man and no' much o' a
theorist, I'll no' venture to say whether ye are richt or wrang.
One matter, however, must be determined afore I can completely side
wi' ye, and that is in what direction was the creek flowing?"</p>

<p>Bob was for the moment nonplussed, and observing his hesitation,
the man of practice seemed to be suddenly amused.</p>

<p>"That appears to be a tough proposition, doesn't it?" said
he.</p>

<p>"It does," agreed Bob, still pondering over a solution to the
question.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't, my lad. The creek just flowed as you first
allowed, in orthodox manner, from north to south. I'm vera pleased
to notice how quickly you have got a grip o' things, an' I only
asked the question so as to direct your attention to what must be
the base o' your theory, for if the flow had been in the opposite
direction the bottom would have been completely knocked oot o' your
argument."</p>

<p>"But how can you tell how it was flowing?" asked Bob, still
somewhat mystified.</p>

<p>"Easily enough; I had a look at Never Never Dave's shaft and
paid particular attention to the nature o' the gold wash below.
Every pebble o' the conglomerate stuff was water worn and mair or
less wedge-shaped wi' the blunt ends facing in this direction. Now
do you savvy? Observation is a grand virtue, Bob&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have been laughing at me," spoke the young man,
gravely.</p>

<p>"I'll prove to you that I havena," came the quick response.
"Jack, come here and do your geometry lesson."</p>

<p>Jack had been industriously searching for further treasure, but
he hastened up at once.</p>

<p>"Now," said his mentor, "I want you to mark out a rectangle five
feet six inches by two feet six inches just on the break o' that
meeserable apology for a creek. We'll start sinkin' our shaft there
in the mornin'."</p>

<p>So it came about that Bob planned the position of their first
shaft, with Jack assisting; and Mackay walking a little way apart
surveyed the pair with deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I can see," he soliloquized, "that my young friend, Bob, is
goin' to be a vera useful acquisition, and if Jack develops along
the lines in which his tastes lie, I have much need to congratulate
mysel'. Who would have thought it?..."</p>

<p>Next after the lining out of the projected shaft came the
pegging of the claims. For this four stout posts were required,
thick enough when faced with an axe to present a surface at least
four inches square. These were soon forthcoming, the mulga shrubs
growing around being just of sufficient girth to meet with official
requirements.</p>

<p>"And now, my lads," said Mackay, in sprightly tones, "we're
going to mark out three men's ground, a hundred feet by a hundred
is the allowance per man, so that means we can take a hundred yards
along the creek and one hundred feet across." He began to pace off
the ground as he spoke. "We can check it with a tape after," said
he, "but I have done this so often that I'm no' likely to be faur
oot in my calculations."</p>

<p>Soon the four pegs were sunk into position by Jack and Mackay,
Bob at the same time scooping out with pick and shovel short
rectangular trenches at each corner to indicate plainly to any
subsequent observer the position of the outlying boundaries. This
done they gazed at their handiwork with serene contentment. The
mercurial Mackay was once more in the clutches of the gold fever,
and his companions were no whit less affected.</p>

<p>"Let us call it Mackay's Reward," cried Jack, at length.</p>

<p>That gentleman shook his head. "This claim shall henceforth be
known as The Golden Promise," he said.</p>

<p>Next on the afternoon's programme was the erection of the tent,
and Jack at once volunteered to search the scrub for the two forked
upright posts required to support the ridge or roof pole of the
calico structure, Mackay and Bob meanwhile arranging the various
stores and mining implements which they had unloaded from the
camel. That wiry animal itself was not far off assiduously chewing
clumps of saltbush and spinifex grass, varying this somewhat
monotonous fare by occasional mouthfuls of the mulga twigs within
its reach. Five minutes, ten minutes passed, and no Jack
reappeared, nor was the sound of his axe heard in the near
distance. Mackay became uneasy.</p>

<p>"I do hope the laddie hasna gone far," he muttered, throwing
down the pick handle he was fitting to the steel and looking around
anxiously.</p>

<p>"But he'll know how to get back," reassured Bob.</p>

<p>Mackay grunted unbelievingly. "That's aye the way wi' new chums
in the bush," he declared. "They never remember that everything is
alike in this country, an' that only the sun can be taken as a
guide." Seizing his rifle he set off in the direction Jack had
taken, Bob hastening at his heels; but they had not gone far before
they were gazing at a most extraordinary spectacle. There was the
delinquent indulging in fierce chase after a great yellow ungainly
creature which scrambled around in a narrow circle, turning at
intervals to snap savagely at its tormentor, who was aiming
numerous but ineffective blows at his quarry with the axe he
carried. Round and round they went, and Jack's energy seemed all
but spent when Mackay's hearty laugh attracted his attention.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho!" he chuckled, walking leisurely forward and
interrupting the performance. Bob at the moment could not see any
reason for this display of humour, and certainly Jack did not.</p>

<p>"It attacked me when I was cutting a tree," explained the
baffled warrior, "and every time I stopped chasing it, it turned
and chased me. I suppose the brute's tired now, or it would be at
me again." He wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and eyed
his enemy malevolently. The object of his wrath was a peculiar
crocodile-like creature with an enormously long tail, short
thick-set legs, and a narrow venomous-looking head. It must have
measured fully five feet in length, and was certainly ugly enough
to disconcert any one who did not know the nature of the beast. Now
it rested calmly by the foot of a tree, its head swaying gently and
its abnormally elongated tongue shooting out and in with lightning
rapidity.</p>

<p>"It's only a poor wee iguana, Jack," consoled Mackay. "It would
dae you no harm, though I will admit it doesna look as peaceably
inclined as it might; but watch me whistle to it." He strode
forward, and kneeling beside the huge iguana&mdash;but as the boys
noticed, beyond the reach of its sturdy claws&mdash;whistled
unmelodiously a selection from a popular opera, and lo! ere the
first two bars had been negotiated, Jack's recent enemy's head
began to nod rhythmically with the music! and its whole body took
on an attitude of satisfied repose.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm jiggered!" was all that Jack could say, while Bob
exploded into uncontrollable mirth. Then the musician ceased his
labours.</p>

<p>"I'm no sayin' that anybody could charm the beastie like me," he
admitted with exceeding modesty. "My whustle's got a wonderfu'
movin' element in it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It has," agreed the pair, with unanimous promptitude,
shuddering with painful emotion. The big man laughed.</p>

<p>"I was sure ye would coincide wi' my statement," he blandly
said. "And now let us get the happy home fixed afore sundown. The
darkness will be on in two shakes o' a kangaroo's tail."</p>

<p>On returning with the necessary saplings to the clearing they
had prepared as a site for their future dwelling, they found the
Shadow awaiting them somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>"I was wondering where ye had got to," he remarked, apparently
much relieved, "I saw some nigs in the district a couple o' days
ago, and I was afraid they had scooped ye in."</p>

<p>"Niggers, here?" cried Mackay.</p>

<p>"They were both out watching me try to kill an iguana," said
Jack, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"But you shouldn't kill iguanas," reproved the Shadow. "They
never mean no harm, and they does wonderful good around a camp,
killing snakes and centipedes and other crawlers."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll remember next time," assured Jack; "I'll remember to
run like smoke when I see one like the brute I tackled to-day. An
ugly wobbly monster over five feet long, harmless!" It was clear
that Jack was by no means convinced.</p>

<p>That evening the entire population of Golden Flat gathered
around the new-comers' camp fire, and did much to entertain the
boys with their various anecdotes and reminiscences. Desperate
encounters with natives, thrilling tales of the early Coolgardie
days, and narratives of prospecting journeys through the waterless
bush regions followed each other in quick succession. The intense
heat of the day had now given place to an extraordinarily chill
atmosphere, which was the more noticeable because of the sudden
change, and all huddled closely to the glowing logs. But it soon
became apparent that the cheerful warmth of the fire was attracting
other and by no means welcome visitors, and though no one seemed to
be in any way concerned, Jack viewed the innumerable pests and
crawling creatures that kept forcing their way into the flames with
some apprehension. The conversation had narrowed down to a wordy
discussion on the possibilities of gold being found in the far
interior.</p>

<p>"Every bushman believes that there's bound to be gold in the
Never Never," reiterated Emu Bill, assisting a large-sized
centipede into the fire with a <i>sang froid</i> that aroused
Jack's horror. But he was yet to be more surprised.</p>

<p>"Don't move, Jack," said the Shadow's voice from somewhere
behind him. "There's a black snake trying to snuggle into your
trousers pocket. I'll spifflicate him in a jiff;" and he promptly
gripped the intruding reptile by the tail, swung it once round his
head, then cracked it as one might the lash of a whip, breaking its
back in an instant.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'll get accustomed to it," said Jack, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"I'll show you how to slaughter them yourself to-morrow,"
comforted the Shadow.</p>

<p>"I say, Mackay," said Nuggety Dick, from his distant corner, "ye
haven't told us about your trip to the old country yet! How did ye
take to it after your ten years' Australian experience?"</p>

<p>But Mackay would only commit himself to one statement. "It's a
grand country, Nuggety," said he, with impressive earnestness; "but
it belongs to too few folk." Which enigmatical reflection seemed to
give his hearers some food for thought.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch4"></a>Chapter 4. The Treasure of the Mine</h2>

<p>During the week that followed, the work at Golden Flat proceeded
apace. Sinking operations were being conducted all along the line
of the auriferous wash from Never Never Dave's shaft down to the
Golden Promise Claim, and red-coloured flags were almost daily
making their appearance on the various windlass heads, indicating
that the fortunate owners of the claims had bottomed on gold. Never
Never Dave's excavation, as has been already mentioned, struck the
pay gravel at the ten-foot level, and that easy-going individual
was leisurely engaged scooping out the rich conglomerate-looking
cement while his neighbours were yet industriously seeking for the
golden channel. Nuggety Dick was the next to reach it; his ground
was directly adjacent to Dave's, yet his shaft was down fifteen
feet before the welcome red symbol showed at his workings, thus
indicating the gradual dip of the ancient waterway. Before the week
was out, however, every shaft had bottomed on the golden gravel
excepting that which Mackay, Bob, and Jack were sinking. But this
delay in reaching the longed-for stratum in no way disconcerted
Mackay.</p>

<p>"The chances are," said he, "that, when we do strike it at the
lower level, the wash itself will be deeper and wider."</p>

<p>This thought was a wonderful incentive to them all, for the
gold-carrying gravel laid bare in the other workings was scarcely
two feet in thickness, and, though its richness was unquestionable,
its limited nature was only too apparent. Bob and Jack took their
turns in the shaft with great good humour and enthusiasm, and
though at first their efforts to penetrate the flinty formations
encountered were almost unavailing, they quickly acquired the
science of the work under the constant guidance of Mackay, who also
taught them how to temper their tools for the different kinds of
strata, how to drill holes for the gelignite charges so as to
obtain the most efficient results. Their early training especially
fitted them for this kind of tuition, and they proved very apt
pupils. Mackay, though such a strong man himself, was no advocate
of the supremacy of muscle even in shaft-sinking.</p>

<p>"Science beats it every time," said he. "Of course, I'm no
denyin' that, where baith strength and science are combined there's
a wonderfu' advantage, but it doesna often happen that a strong man
physically is blessed wi' a superabundity o' mental
gifts&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jack, of course, could not resist the interruption. "We can't
allow that from you, sir," in his most sedate tones.</p>

<p>Mackay smiled. "I'm vera pleased to have your implied
testimonial, Jack," he returned, with twinkling eyes; "but then I
was aboot to remark that an exception was needed to prove any rule,
an' I was to assume mysel' to be the exception in this case. No,
no, mind conquers matter, and that is why you two are just as
fitted to pit doon a shaft as the strongest navvy in the country."
All of which the boys found to be quite in accordance with facts
when they got accustomed to wielding the pick, hammer, and
drill.</p>

<p>"Observe any cracks in the formation," their kindly instructor
would call down to them; "attack everything in the lines o' least
resistance." And by following his advice to the letter they quickly
discovered that gold-mining was by no means as difficult as they
had imagined.</p>

<p>Now, just when the first week of their labours had concluded,
the shaft was sunk twenty feet; a few more feet would decide
whether or not Bob's theory would prove correct.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, mates," said Nuggety Dick that evening, "you
were just a bit venturesome in sinking so far from the main
workings."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," returned Bob, confidently. "We'll get there
all right, Nuggety. Another five feet should do it." And another
five feet did do it. Two days later Mackay's pick broke through the
covering layer of diorite in the bottom of the shaft, and with a
grunt of satisfaction he called on Jack, who was at the windlass,
to lower the bucket.</p>

<p>"I'm sending up some specimens," he cried.</p>

<p>Jack gave a howl of delight; hearing which, Bob, who had been
reading in the tent, rushed out, and with eyes gleaming with
suppressed excitement, hurried to the shaft mouth. He was just in
time to assist in the raising of the heavily laden bucket. Nearer
and nearer it came to the surface. Would the wash be gold-bearing
or would it be barren? The boys' agitation was intense. Their limbs
trembled and their hands could scarcely retain their grip on the
windlass arms. Down below stood Mackay, perspiring with his arduous
toil, watching the bucket ascend with somewhat anxious eyes. The
glare of the sun across the shaft's mouth made everything apparent
to him, while he himself was obscured from view in the shadows. The
bucket had almost reached the top; already Bob had stretched out
his hand to grasp it, when a stentorian shout from below arrested
the movement, and, for a space, the fateful harbinger of good or
evil tidings hung motionless.</p>

<p>"Keep a good grip o' your nerves&mdash;an' the windlass, lads.
Heave away!"</p>

<p>The caution came in time. It suddenly flashed upon them both
that a single slip on their part, a momentary hesitation, might
prove disastrous to their friend below. Again Bob stretched out his
hand, his eyes caught the glisten of gold, but his grip was sure.
Next instant he and Jack were gazing at a whitish mass, through
which shone myriad dazzling particles of the yellow metal. A few
minutes later Mackay was jerked to the surface; there was no
hesitancy in the movement of the windlass now; the moment of
extreme tension had come and gone. Together they sat down on the
sand and examined the specimens one by one without speaking. Then
Mackay rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"The theory was right, Bob," he said calmly. "This is the
richest stuff on the lead. I don't know how much there is of it
yet, but there's enough to make you glad you came out to Australia,
anyhow. Run up the flag, Jack," he directed, turning to that youth,
who was still joyously examining his treasures. "Let Golden Flat
know that we three are right here every time." He spoke jovially,
yet so quietly, that his words exercised a kind of restraint over
his hearers, which he was quick to notice.</p>

<p>"Never mind me, my lads," he said. "You've got every reason to
rejoice, but you must remember that I'm an old hand at gold
digging, an' the yellow dirt doesna mak' me enthuse like it aince
did." Truly enough, to this strange Scot of many moods, the
excitement and risk attending discovery was everything; he viewed
the rich reward likely to be his with almost stoical indifference.
Indeed, he was engaged in a deep philosophical argument with Bob
concerning the uses and abuses of gold as a factor in the world's
history, when the population of Golden Flat arrived in a body to
tender their congratulations.</p>

<p>"But in these days," Bob was saying, "not to have gold is held
to be almost a proof of one's inferiority. The world does not judge
from an intellectual standpoint. It demands wealth. No matter what
brains a young man may have at home, the chances are against his
ever coming to the front unaided. Gold&mdash;&mdash;" Bob stopped
suddenly, having become aware of a growing audience behind him.</p>

<p>From the group old battered Dead Broke made grave utterance.</p>

<p>"I believe your ideas are kerect, Bob; but from what I sees here
you can thank your lucky stars that the gold has come to you early
in life. Look at me an' Nuggety&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' me," broke in the youthful Shadow, with affected
mournfulness.</p>

<p>At this stage Jack came forward with a handful of fine gold
slugs and coarse dust.</p>

<p>"I've just dollied a few samples," said he, handing his treasure
to Mackay. "That should go about twenty ounces to the ton,
shouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"We're jolly glad to know you've struck it, boys," said Nuggety
Dick, earnestly. "And we hopes it will be a thicker patch than
ours, for, from what I sees, we can work out our claims in less
than a month."</p>

<p>"Well, we sunk here on the spec. o' striking it bigger on the
rise," said Mackay. "But whether or no we've been successful I
canna say just yet."</p>

<p>"I'm going to sink for a deeper patch," growled Emu Bill. "I
believe we've only got a floater in our claims, an' the true bottom
should be further down."</p>

<p>"I'd advise you to work out all the shallow ground first," said
Mackay. "You never know when a rush may come sailin' along. Keep
stackin' the stuff until we get a battery up; don't trouble
dollyin' it&mdash;it's only wasting time."</p>

<p>His advice was sound, and was greeted with murmurs of assent.
The water supply at the camp was daily becoming less and less; no
doubt more could be tapped by sinking a deep shaft, but this would
involve considerable delay, and the citizens of Golden Flat were by
no means anxious to leave their congenial occupation at so early a
period. By roughly grinding the cement-like wash, and rinsing off
the lighter sands, fairly accurate assays could be obtained from
sample specimens; but to continue such a work on a large scale
would drain the soak within a week. The only feasible plan was to
excavate as much of the gravel as possible in anticipation of a
crushing battery arriving on the ground, which would surely be
there immediately news of the Flat's richness spread abroad. And so
the days passed, and the sun beat down fiercely on the toiling band
who strove with grim Nature for her treasure. Ever and anon the
dull roar of exploding gelignite indicated how man was using the
utmost help civilization could give in order to shatter the many
refractory obstacles in his path.</p>

<p>At the Golden Promise Mine sinking operations were going on very
successfully; three feet of the golden conglomerate had been
penetrated, and still there were no signs of the dreaded barren
pipe-clay formation appearing. Bob's theory had already been proved
to be correct. Tons upon tons of rich stone had been raised to the
surface. The actual width of the channel was but eight feet; but
the amount of cubic contents held in the claim was bound to be
several hundred of tons at least, even supposing the drift went no
deeper than the already known three feet.</p>

<p>Covered with dust and grime, and blackened by powder smoke, Bob
and Jack were working together one morning in the large chamber
they had made in the lower workings, and Mackay stood patiently by
the windlass awaiting the call to raise the boys from the danger
below, for they were firing a difficult charge. They had grown
quite accustomed to the use of gelignite by this time, and, as
Mackay proudly informed Emu Bill, they never once had had a
misfire.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, some delay had occurred owing to the
fuse which Mackay had sent down becoming detached from the cap. He
always arranged the charges on the surface, calculating the number
of plugs required, and the length of fuse necessary, when he
finished drilling the holes below, leaving the boys to insert the
charges and see them properly fired. At last came the warning from
Jack&mdash;"All ready!"&mdash;as he slipped his foot in the loop of
the wire rope which was hanging in readiness. In a few seconds he
was on the surface, while the rope was again rapidly lowered for
Bob, who was even then lighting a match to apply to the fuse. The
two on top heard the match scratch on the box, and immediately
thereafter the familiar sputtering of the fuse echoed to their
ears, but still no sound from Bob! Yet the faint, insidious odour
of the burning fuse crept up to their nostrils, and they knew that
something had happened. Mackay's face grew livid.</p>

<p>"It's only a sixty seconds' fuse," he muttered hoarsely. "Stand
by the windlass, Jack. I'll slide down the rope."</p>

<p>Jack seemed to awake from a stupor. "I'm lightest," he cried;
and threw himself at the rope without waiting for Mackay to brake
the windlass barrel.</p>

<p>The iron arms of the windlass spun round, a few more loose coils
only remained on the barrel. The brawny Scot hesitated not an
instant. He rushed at the gyrating bar, and received the shock of
the descending steel on his bared chest. The windlass rope held
firm. Another revolution, and it would have run off the barrel and
dashed the boy who clung to its strands to a certain death beside
his companion. It was all over in a few seconds. Not knowing how
his impetuous action had nearly caused certain disaster, Jack slid
down the rope with lightning speed, and almost immediately his
steady call&mdash;"Heave away!"&mdash;was heard. And now came the
trial of strength where all the science in the world could not
assist; only twenty seconds' grace, a double load on the windlass,
and twelve plugs of one of the most powerful explosives known
beneath! But Mackay was equal to the task. The windlass arm spun
round once again, and on the fifteenth second Jack swung into view,
his foot resting in the loop, one lacerated hand grasping tightly
at the rope, and supporting in his right arm the blood-dripping
form of Bob, his comrade. Mackay reached out his strong arm, and
drew them both to safety just as a thunderous explosion occurred
which hurled tons of massive rocks to the shaft mouth and
beyond.</p>

<p>Five minutes later all three were seated in the tent repairing
their bruises, and making sundry comments on the occurrence. Bob's
face was almost deathly pallid, and the blood still trickled from a
deep gash in the back of his head; it appeared that just after he
had applied the match to the fuse a portion of the iron roof of the
excavation had given way, hurling him unconscious to the
ground.</p>

<p>"I remembered no more," said he, "until I found myself in the
tent here."</p>

<p>"It was a vera close shave, my lad," said Mackay, with
suppressed emotion. "I'm no goin' to expatiate on Jack's quick
action in the matter, but he maist certainly saved your life. It
needed some nerve to gang doon on top o' a burnin' charge o'
dynamite."</p>

<p>Bob smiled affectionately at his companion, and reached out his
hand; and Jack, flushing almost guiltily, was forced to show his
cruelly torn fingers.</p>

<p>"And, Bob," said he, almost tearfully, "it was
Mackay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You stop, right there, youngster," interrupted that gentleman,
"I'll tak' nane o' the credit from you. You deserve it a', my lad.
I'm proud o' you, I am. Now, I think you'd both be the better o' a
rest. I'll go up and see how the other boys are getting on. I hope
none o' the grinning hyenas noticed anything."</p>

<p>But the "grinning hyenas" had noticed, and Mackay met them in a
body immediately he went out of the tent. There was the Shadow,
Nuggety, Emu Bill, and company hastening forward, dismay showing
plainly on their features.</p>

<p>"What's happened, Mac? Any one killed?" they shouted.</p>

<p>"Calm yoursel's, boys, calm yoursel's," adjured Mackay, "there's
been no serious damage done. But I'll need to timber the roof o'
the drive before we do any more work below; a bit o' it fell and
gave young Bob a nasty crack on the cranium just as he fired a
heavy charge. Jack got him out a' richt, but it vera nearly was a
funeral."</p>

<p>Very sincere were the sympathetic expressions of the group. The
unassuming attitude of Mackay's mates, as the boys were called,
their happy temperament, had endeared them to the dwellers on
Golden Flat, and now they trooped into the tent, and, in their
rough kindly way, congratulated the pair on their escape, much to
Jack's confusion. No truer-hearted men could be found than those
battered pioneers of the desert land. Their life amid Nature's grim
solitudes is one filled with unceasing cares, unseen dangers lurk
for ever in their lonely path, their stern, set faces are but the
result of bush environment which insidiously yet surely marks its
victims with her stamp of immobility.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right in a day or so, Bob," spoke Nuggety Dick,
cheerily, after examining the wound.</p>

<p>"If ye'll let me, I'll take your shift until ye're better," said
the Shadow, hesitatingly; "I can't do much in my own shaft now
without a mate, it's too deep for me to work alone."</p>

<p>Bob thanked him gratefully. "I hate to keep things back," said
he, "and if Mackay has no objections&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that, Bob," broke in Mackay; "I'll mak' use
o' the Shadow until ye are well again, unless he misbehaves vera
badly."</p>

<p>That same afternoon a new discovery was made by Emu Bill, which
had the effect of raising the excitement of the camp to fever heat.
Having continued his shaft down through the supposed bottom of the
golden wash in his claim, he suddenly came upon a strange soapy
grey deposit, not unlike putty in appearance.</p>

<p>"That proves we hasn't struck bottom yet," was his verdict, as
he examined the odd formation keenly; "there's no pipeclay about
that, there isn't." Then his eyes blinked and stared and blinked
again. "Howlin' blazes," he murmured gently to himself, "this will
give the boys a shock, it will." He had carelessly broken a piece
of the clayey mass between his finger and thumb, and behold, the
line of fracture showed golden yellow, and in the dim candle-light
innumerable dazzling pin-points of colour gleamed throughout the
entire specimen. In a few moments he was on the surface, bearing
the cherished find in his hand. "I have got something, Nuggety,"
said he, addressing his partner, "that shid make ye gasp."</p>

<p>Nuggety gasped in anticipation, then uttered a yell of delight
as his eyes beheld the glittering specimen.</p>

<p>"Is it a new level, Emu?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Emu Bill nodded. "Round up the boys," said he. "It'll give them
mighty encouragement to hiv' a look at this here bonanza." Nuggety
rushed away at once, and Bill ventured another gaze at his
treasure. But somehow he did not seem to derive as much
satisfaction from this observation. "Hang it," he growled, closing
his hands tightly over the specimen, "I could ha' sworn I saw more
gold than that in it at first."</p>

<p>In a few short minutes he was surrounded by an enthusiastic
throng.</p>

<p>"Nuggety says you've struck a new level, Bill," they cried
almost with one voice.</p>

<p>"I hiv' that," said Bill, with calm satisfaction, "an' from what
I can see, there'll be thousands o' tons o' the stuff in our
grounds, an' it's just crammed wi' gold."</p>

<p>He cautiously unclosed his hand, and proffered the wonderful
stone to Never Never Dave, who examined it keenly, then passed it
on to his next neighbour without a word, eyeing Emu Bill
reproachfully the while. Strangely enough, no one seemed to
appreciate Emu's find but himself; but he smiled and chuckled
enough for them all. The last man to examine the specimen was
Mackay; he was the latest arrival, having been down below,
timbering the tunnel in the shaft which had given way so
inopportunely, when the great news reached him.</p>

<p>"An' what's this ye've got, Bill?" he said, receiving the
fateful fragment from old Dead Broke Dan, who sighed deeply as he
handed it over. "What is it you're playin' at?" he demanded, after
a first cursory glance.</p>

<p>"It's all straight, Mac," broke in Bill, eagerly. "It's a fair
sample, an' there' lots more o' it, too."</p>

<p>Mackay eyed the speaker with fast-rising disgust. "Dae you ken,
Emu," said he, slowly, "if it werena for the fact that I got a' the
wind squelched oot o' me the day, I would lay violent hands on ye
for puttin' up such a meeserable joke on your friends."</p>

<p>Poor Emu Bill looked dazed. "Why, what's wrong wi' the gold?" he
asked feebly. "Surely you ain't goin' to tell me I doesn't know
gold from iron pyrites&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor old Emu must ha' got a touch o' the sun to-day," grunted
Never Never, sympathetically.</p>

<p>With a snort of indignation, Bill clutched back his specimen
from Mackay, gave one glance at it, then subsided in the sand.</p>

<p>"You're right, boys," he announced from his lowly position in
weary dejected tones; "I'm as mad as a hatter."</p>

<p>Not a trace of the yellow metal showed in the stone he now held
in his hand.</p>

<p>"I would ha' sworn I saw gold in that stuff," he continued
pathetically. "No, no, Emu Bill's finished. Crack me on the head,
boys, for Heaven's sake, an' bury me quick."</p>

<p>"An' me too," groaned Nuggety. "I saw the gold, as I'm a livin'
sinner, I did."</p>

<p>A glint of joy flashed into Bill's eyes at the words, and he
struggled to his feet.</p>

<p>"Come down into the shaft, Mackay, and have a look for
yourself," he said. "I do believe the curious stuff is so delicate
it can't stand the light."</p>

<p>Still somewhat dubious about Emu Bill's professed honesty of
purpose, Mackay was not slow to avail himself of the opportunity of
judging for himself whether or not the new formation really did
carry visible gold. Then, noting the truly distressed countenance
of his old acquaintance, he relented.</p>

<p>"I believe ye did think ye saw gold, Emu," said he, before
placing his foot in the sling preparatory to descending the shaft,
"an' though I dinna expect to see any glittering bonanza down below
here, I'm sort o' convinced <i>you</i> saw it right enough. It's
the sun, Emu, my man; that's what it is."</p>

<p>Bill shook his head feebly; it was all beyond his
comprehension.</p>

<p>"I'll come down after you, Mac," he said. "It's a mighty funny
stuff, and you need to break it before it shows colour."</p>

<p>By this time every man in the camp was around the windlass; even
Bob, with his bandaged head, had put in appearance, and Jack and
the Shadow were also there. Quickly the windlass ran out, and
deposited Mackay at the new level exposed, and while the rope went
up again for Bill he lit a candle and peered cautiously around. He
was looking for snakes, the bite of a certain variety of which
induces strange hallucinations. Observing nothing in the shape he
dreaded, he heaved a sigh of relief, and turned his attention to
the soapy-like stratum from which Bill had broken his wonderful
specimen. Only a dull grey muddy deposit was visible. With a jerk
and a rattle the haulage rope came down again, and Emu Bill arrived
at his side.</p>

<p>"I see nothing, Bill, my man," grunted Mackay.</p>

<p>Bill said not a word, but, taking his pick, smote furiously at
the deceiving substance, and as it became disintegrated great
gleaming streaks and sheets and scintillating points of gold seemed
to show all over it.</p>

<p>"Can ye see anything, Mac?" inquired the wielder of the pick,
pausing in his labours, and glancing eagerly at his companion.</p>

<p>"I'm simply flabbergasted," came the slow response. "There seems
to be enough gold there to stock a second Bank o' England."</p>

<p>He picked up a piece of the strange formation which showed
dazzling yellow lines across its newly broken face, and examined it
closely and intently; he rubbed it with his finger, and the
brilliance vanished.</p>

<p>"We'd better take up some o' the best-looking bits," he
suggested.</p>

<p>Bill laughed. "Why, the hanged stuff won't show a colour on
top," he said.</p>

<p>But they decided to chance it all the same, and accordingly
Mackay arrived on the surface bearing the result of his
investigations tightly wrapped in an old handkerchief, and when the
package was opened up a cry of admiration broke from all beholders,
so beautiful, indeed, did the specimens appear.</p>

<p>A hoarse call from the underground interrupted their
scrutiny.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, boys, put a chain on that there mirage,
until I get a look at it."</p>

<p>And while two men went to the windlass and began to haul Bill to
the surface, a gradual change began to take place in the nature of
the specimens. The yellow sheen grew darker and darker until it
shone like bronze, and in this state Bill viewed them on his
arrival. Slowly yet surely the bronze shades merged into a
strangely variegated purple hue, and, while the onlookers stared
aghast, this gradually evolved into the original clayey aspect of
the formation surrounding it.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be jiggered!" ejaculated the Shadow.</p>

<p>"It's just a mirage," said Bill, grimly.</p>

<p>The rest of the miners did not care to place on record the state
of their feelings, their usually fluent enough speech failed them
on this trying occasion. Mackay broke the silence.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt aboot the gold being there, boys," said
he, "an' in sufficient quantities to make a' oor fortunes&mdash;if
we could only catch it before it vanished." He stopped, absolutely
nonplussed.</p>

<p>Bob, who had not yet spoken, advanced and scrutinized the now
wholly dulled ore fragments with alert eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can help you," he said quietly, "but I
should like to try. Anyhow, it's more in my line than yours, for
I've studied chemistry a bit."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Bob?" asked Mackay, quickly.</p>

<p>The reply came promptly from the lips of the thoughtful
student.</p>

<p>"The formation contains gold in an unstable state, but more so
gold in solution, both of which oxidize on contact with the
air."</p>

<p>To say that Bob's words created extreme interest would be a very
mild statement of fact. His audience was comprised of gold-miners
of very varied experience and knowledge, yet none of them had ever
heard of such a tantalizing deposit as that they had now
encountered.</p>

<p>"I may be wrong," continued Bob, "but I don't think there was
any mistaking the colours on the stones before they regained their
normal aspect. I've seen the same thing often in the laboratory. It
was simply Purple of Cassius, and you'll get the same result by
dissolving a small piece of gold in nitric and hydrochloric
acids."</p>

<p>"But what about the real gold which was there at first?"
inquired Emu Bill. "It was yellow enough, or I'm colour blind."</p>

<p>Bob looked a trifle puzzled. "I should say it was an unstable
chloride or sulphide of the metal," he ventured at length. "A
combination which very seldom occurs in Nature."</p>

<p>"I'm o' the opinion that Bob's right," spoke Mackay. "This
country's full o' odd formations and no one has ever bothered
studying them yet."</p>

<p>"If you can save this stuff afore it melts, Bob," grunted
Nuggety Dick, "there's bound to be a fortune waiting for you right
here; for the clay most likely covers the whole flat."</p>

<p>"I'll take these specimens with me now," decided Bob, "and try
some experiments with them;" and he gathered up the deceptive
samples and made his way back to the tent, leaving the wondering
assembly still in a maze of doubt.</p>

<p>"I do believe he can do it," grunted Emu Bill.</p>

<p>"He's got the finest balanced brain-box I've seen since I struck
this howling wilderness," commented Never Never Dave.</p>

<p>"Bob can do anything with chemistry," said Jack, proudly. Then
they went their several ways, all pondering deeply.</p>

<p>No more work was done that day: it would have seemed like
tempting Providence to continue further operations after two such
thrilling happenings had taken place. Bob quietly set about his
task of analyzing the troublesome specimens, then quickly
discovered that he required a stock of various acids and alkalis to
aid him in his efforts.</p>

<p>"We're a' running short of stores anyhow," said Mackay. "We'd
better send some one into the township with the camels, and you
could get the chemicals required at the same time."</p>

<p>He straightway went and broached the matter to Nuggety Dick and
his satellites, and it was promptly arranged that old Dead Broke
Dan should be despatched with the team at once. It was by this time
near the hour of sundown, and the various camel bells of the party
could be heard faintly tinkling in the eastward distance.</p>

<p>"I'll round them up in a jiff," volunteered the Shadow, starting
off at a jog trot.</p>

<p>"I'm coming too, Shad!" shouted Jack, and together they entered
the scrub, and were soon lost to sight. They had not gone far,
however, before the Shadow stopped and listened with something like
dismay showing in his face. The bells seemed to be receding into
the distance rather than coming nearer.</p>

<p>"I've never heard o' them brutes travelling so fast," he said
discontentedly, and they increased their pace to a determined run,
which they kept up for fully ten minutes. The bells sounded
distinctly nearer now, but that the camels were on the march was
plainly evident to the Shadow, whose ear was acutely trained to
judging distances by sound.</p>

<p>"I reckon I know what's wrong, Jack," said he. "Some wretched
niggers have got them in tow. It's very lucky we came out
to-night."</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked Jack, doubtfully.</p>

<p>The Shadow laughed joyously. "We'll have a grand circus on our
own to-night, if there ain't too many of them."</p>

<p>"But," said Jack, "we haven't even a rifle with us, and they'll
have their spears and boomerangs, won't they?"</p>

<p>"I've got something that will skeer the beggars quicker than any
shooting-iron," replied the Shadow. "See, look at
this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He extracted from some secret recess in his meagre wardrobe a
small curiously shaped piece of wood, about six inches long and two
inches or so broad, tapering to a fine edge all round.</p>

<p>"That's a ghingi, Jack; I just hitch a bit o' string on to the
end, and whizz it round in the air, an' it howls like a dyin'
dingo."</p>

<p>"But what good does that do?" Jack persisted, by no means
enlightened.</p>

<p>"What good does it do?" echoed the Shadow. "Why, when they hear
the screech o' the ghingi-ghingi, they'll either vanish right away
or come to hear what it says. The ghingi is their devil, you know,
but only the sorcerers o' the tribes can make it speak. I made this
here ghingi myself, and, by thunder! it can yell like a good 'un,
it can."</p>

<p>The Shadow was evidently quite delighted at the prospect of
making use of his handiwork, and as they strode along he managed to
infuse Jack with a considerable amount of his enthusiasm. It was
now as dark as an Australian night could be, but the steadfast
radiance of the myriad stars somewhat neutralized the gloom of the
shadows and reflected an eerie sort of half light over the
motionless tips of the mulga scrub. At last they were almost up on
the clanging bells, and if there had been any doubt in Jack's mind
concerning the accuracy of his companion's surmise as to their
unusual clangour it disappeared utterly when he heard the droning
chant of the aborigines mingle with the rhythmic peals. They had
reached a small clearing in the scrub which permitted an
uninterrupted line of vision for nearly half a mile, but before
leaving the sheltering timber they hesitated, and peered anxiously
across the intervening sand plain, and there in the midst of it,
darkly discernible, moved the ghostly camel train.</p>

<p>"Now for it," muttered the Shadow, getting the ghingi ready for
action. "We must round up them camels afore they get into the bush
country again."</p>

<p>He whirled his device quickly around his head, and at once a
strange moaning broke upon the air. Faster and faster he spun it
round, and the moaning increased to a weird wailing shriek which
penetrated across the plain with shivering intensity. At once the
bells ceased their clamour and vague cries of alarm echoed back to
the boys.</p>

<p>"Let us chase 'em up with it," exclaimed the Shadow, throwing
all caution aside. "When they hear the ghingi comin' nearer they
won't wait to argue long."</p>

<p>Together they made a wild burst over the ironshot flat, the
ghingi sending forth varying notes of wailing terror as they ran.
In their excitement they had not calculated on the nearness of the
natives, the silence of the bells perhaps somewhat confused them,
but they halted when they found themselves almost on the tail of
the last camel, a huge animal which the Shadow had no difficulty in
recognizing by its unusual size. All this time the harsh unmusical
cries of the disquieted aborigines rent their ears, but apparently
the dusky band had not yet decided to give up their stolen
charges.</p>

<p>"Judging from the volume o' music let loose there must be 'bout
half a dozen o' the beggars," whispered the Shadow. "Here, Jack,
take this blooming ghingi, and let her rip. My arms are about
busted. I'll do a bit o' a yell myself and see what happens."</p>

<p>Jack seized the string of the syren and whirled with a will, and
from the lips of the Shadow there issued a most lugubrious groan,
which seemed to combine in it all the horrors that any demon of
darkness could have conjured up. That seemed to decide matters;
with screams of terror seven or eight stalwart blacks broke away
from a point where they had been huddled ahead of the camels; their
dark forms were just visible as they fled, and they made a somewhat
ghost-like spectacle. Jack gave a low chuckle of delight.</p>

<p>"Your voice fetched them, Shadow," said he.</p>

<p>"Keep the ghingi whizzing, Jack, keep it whizzing!" came the
agonized reply. "I couldn't do it again for all the gold in
Australia. My throat's burst, it is."</p>

<p>Their concerted action was now prompt and effective. In a trice
the Shadow had a grip of the nose-rope of the leading camel, and
had turned the unwieldly train on a backward course. Once more the
bells rang out their noisy clamour, yet still the ghingi sounded
loud and shrill, and still the jarring cries of the stricken
warriors echoed in reply from a not too remote distance. The
adventuresome pair were not yet out of all danger. Indeed it soon
became evident to them that the mystified aborigines were not
altogether willing to accept the warning call of the ghingi as a
reason for the total abdication of their plunder. Their discordant
cries were just a bit too close to be pleasant.</p>

<p>"If they rush us, Jack," the Shadow hoarsely whispered, as he
tugged at Misery's nose-rope, "we'll have to make a bolt for
it."</p>

<p>Jack grunted a sympathetic affirmative. "I can't swing this
wretched old ghingi much longer," he said.</p>

<p>Even while he spoke the savages seemed to decide on a definite
course of action; their yells suddenly grew louder and nearer. It
was very probable they had observed the boys through the gloom, and
were thus awakened to a knowledge of the ruse by which they had
been deceived. Anyhow there could be no doubt as to their
intentions; they meant to recapture the camels, and that right
speedily, and yet the Shadow was loth to leave his charges.</p>

<p>"They'll get us when we enter the scrub," said he, with dismal
resignation. "The beggars won't tackle us in the open. I reckon
we'll have to do a scoot, Jack."</p>

<p>Jack had already arrived at that conclusion; but now, as he
rested from his labours for an instant, a bright idea seized him.
They were scarcely a hundred yards from the edge of the timber;
whatever was to be done must be done quickly. Without a word he
rushed back to the rearmost camel, and hastily secured the tongue
of the bell encircling its neck by passing it through a loop in the
leathern thong which hung loose for that purpose. Moving hurriedly
on he silenced each of the jangling bells in the same way, and for
a short space the cumbrous train proceeded in absolute quiet.</p>

<p>"They'll think we've stopped, and it may keep them back for a
bit," Jack whispered.</p>

<p>The Shadow nodded comprehensively. It had come as a shock to him
that this new chum companion of his should have thought of the
simple plan first, and he felt somewhat aggrieved in consequence.
Surely enough the yells of the natives seemed to recede into the
distance; the silence of the bells had certainly confused them.</p>

<p>"They'll be with us in a jiff," calmly said the Shadow, as they
entered the scrub, in which prognostication he was quite
correct.</p>

<p>A chorus of fiercer yells than before suddenly broke upon the
still air, then came the angry beating of spears upon shields, and
the pat-pat of many feet on the sand. But now came another
unexpected diversion. Away in the distance a heavy report boomed
out; again and again the thunderous echoes of exploding cordite
crashed through the night.</p>

<p>The Shadow chuckled long and joyously. "That's Mackay's new
rifle," he said. "I would know the crack of it anywhere."</p>

<p>Other and varying discharges quickly followed, making it plain
that the entire community at Golden Flat had grown alarmed at the
prolonged absence of the boys, and were signalling in order to
guide their return in the darkness. The yelling horde at the first
ominous sound had ceased their clamour, but soon they broke out
afresh and with renewed energy. They meant to make one more effort
to recover their prize before it was hopelessly beyond their reach.
With appalling shouts they quickly drew near.</p>

<p>"It's hard luck to be forced to clear out now," complained Jack,
marvelling much at his companion's unsubdued joy.</p>

<p>That wily youth quietly unhitched the bells from the necks of
the three leading camels.</p>

<p>"I think we'll best the niggers after all, Jack," he said. "I
wasn't exactly willing to let you risk it before; but you can steer
by the gunshots, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Jack, clutching at the nose-rope of Misery
which the Shadow had relinquished.</p>

<p>"Well, you take the team into camp, and I'll run the niggers a
bit o' a circus dance." He was gone at once, but not an instant too
soon; the blacks were already within a hundred yards of them.</p>

<p>Jack continued his course guided by the reports which now rang
out at regular intervals, and he smiled quietly to himself when a
confused jangle of bells sounded away to the southward, and his
smile developed into a hearty laugh when, with howls presumably of
delight, the warrior band stampeded in that direction.</p>

<p>"I think the Shadow knows how to take care of himself," he
reflected contentedly, as he continued his course in peace.</p>

<p>The Shadow's trick was certainly effective. It was also risky,
but that feature seemed rather enjoyable than otherwise to the
impetuous young Australian. Far to the south he sped, jangling the
bells at intervals to draw his pursuers on, and when their noisy
yelling sounded too close for his liking, he silenced the tell-tale
alarms and veered off in a different direction, always taking care
to work in towards the camp. A veritable will-o'-the-wisp he was,
and the baffled natives soon tired of their hopeless chase, no
doubt marvelling much at the extraordinary activity shown by the
fleeing camel train!</p>

<p>At the camp considerable consternation was felt over the
non-return of the camel hunters. They had been gone over two hours,
before Mackay ventured to express his fears for their safety.</p>

<p>"The Shadow must have got twisted in his bearings," he said.
"The bells were within a couple o' miles off when they started, and
they seem to have gone further away instead o' comin' nearer."</p>

<p>"Mebbe the cantankerous brutes bolted," suggested Nuggety Dick.
"The Shadow couldn't bush hissel' in creation wi' the old Cross
showin' in the sky."</p>

<p>So, indeed, they all thought, but each of them felt strangely
anxious nevertheless, and when Mackay fetched his rifle from his
tent and began to blaze away methodically, they were not long in
following his lead. The bells had been some time out of range when
the first shot was fired, but suddenly their harsh jangling burst
afresh on their ears, and to their surprise and dismay they seemed
to be heading towards the south.</p>

<p>"Keep your popguns going," said Mackay. "The Shadow must have
lost his nerve and got slewed."</p>

<p>So was the young bushman condemned and abused while he pursued
his erratic course, and Jack came in for more sympathy than he
would have appreciated had he been within hearing.</p>

<p>"What in thunder can the howlin' idiot mean by zig-zagging like
that?" exclaimed Never Never Dave, listening to the intermittent
peals of the bells with deep concern. Then faintly over the mulga
scrub came the yells of the discomfited blacks, and at once Golden
Flat camp was aroused to strenuous action; scarcely a word was
spoken, each man gripped his rifle, and almost as one body, they
made a wild burst in the direction from which the alarming sounds
had come. And Bob, though almost in a high fever from the effects
of the wound in his head, entirely forgot his weakness, and kept
pace with Mackay.</p>

<p>Silent and grim, like a raging Nemesis, the small company
hurried on their vengeful way; but they had not gone far when they
became aware of a slight commotion in the bush directly in their
path, and almost before they could realize it, the great hulking
forms of the camels loomed out through the darkness, with Jack at
their head.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be kicked! And why isn't ye slaughtered, young
feller?" demanded Nuggety Dick, in helpless amazement. "We never
dreamt o' seein' ye alive again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where's the Shadow, Jack?" interrupted Mackay.</p>

<p>Jack laughed. "He's acting decoy for the blacks," he said.</p>

<p>The big man seemed to tremble with suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>"And I was blaming him for getting bushed!" he said, in a tone
of deep self-reproach.</p>

<p>A harsh jangle of bells close at hand interrupted further
speech, and a cheery voice spoke from the gloom.</p>

<p>"Say, boss, ye needn't ever be skeerd 'bout me gettin' bushed;
but them camel bells are mighty heavy, an' I'm just about blown out
waltzing them around."</p>

<p>The Shadow approached, gave the bells a final shake, then flung
them with a clatter to the ground. A few words served to explain
matters, and it was with a feeling of devout thankfulness that the
party returned slowly to camp.</p>

<p>"You must never run risks like that again, my laddies," Mackay
admonished quietly, in the midst of the general rejoicings over the
plucky rescue of the camel train.</p>

<p>"Jack and me didn't take no risks," came the gay reply. "We
always knew by their howling when the beggars were coming too
close. It's been a grand picnic for us both, hasn't it, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have missed it for anything," answered Jack, with a
chuckle of keen delight.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch5"></a>Chapter 5. The Rush at Golden Flat</h2>

<p>Dead Broke Dan had been gone a week from Golden Flat on his
errand for stores, and in this time the extent of the "pay gravel"
in the different mines had been fairly accurately estimated.
Developments all along the line proved the existence of a rich but
limited layer of the gold-carrying wash from end to end of the
workings. At the Golden Promise mine the auriferous deposit, as had
been anticipated, had occurred in a considerably deeper drift than
in any of the others, the reason of course, being in accordance
with Bob's theory that the sudden uprise of the old channel would
cause an accumulation of the wash directly on the incline, and so
it had happened; the thickness of the stratum was here nearly four
feet, or almost twice that in all the other claims. Beyond this,
however, no direct trace of the ancient waterway could be
discovered; a broad lagoon-like mass of the tantalizing clay which
had so mystified Emu Bill intervened, sparkling and gleaming in its
deceptive beauty until raised to the surface when it unfailingly
relapsed into its muddy, sordid state, to the disgust of all
beholders. This odd formation was found to underlie the genuine
gold-carrying cement in all the shafts, and its presence provided a
topic for much vituperative language.</p>

<p>Until the various chemicals arrived Bob was unable to make any
analysis of the much-abused deposit, but he was never tired of
examining samples of it, powdering them up and applying the fire
test in the hope that whatever refractory gas or element was
present, and binding the gold in an invisible state, might be
driven off. He never cared to say much concerning the results of
these experiments, but that he received undoubted satisfaction from
his labours was very evident. He was engaged roasting some of the
fine grains of the clay in a crucible when Mackay entered the tent
on this morning in search of a pick-handle he had mislaid.</p>

<p>"Well, Bob," said he, "an' are ye gettin' any nearer a solution
to that mystery of Nature?"</p>

<p>Bob silently pointed to the crucible on the small Primus stove
from which dense yellow fumes were issuing.</p>

<p>"Smell that," he said.</p>

<p>Mackay sniffed right heartily, and nearly choked in
consequence.</p>

<p>"An' what sort o' a perfume do ye call that?" he demanded, when
he had regained his composure.</p>

<p>"Chlorine," smilingly returned the chemist. "The clay is soaked
in it, and any text-book will tell you that chlorine has a great
affinity for gold."</p>

<p>Mackay became interested at once. "Let me hear your line o'
argument, Bob," he grunted. "This is a matter o' vera considerable
importance, an' I'll be the last to discourage ye in your
efforts."</p>

<p>Bob smiled just a trifle sadly. "I haven't been able to work in
the shaft for a week," he began.</p>

<p>"An' ye'll no work in the shaft until that head o' yours is
richt better," interrupted Mackay. "I'm no' so sure," he continued,
"whether I should alloo ye to worry as you're doin' aboot that
wretched stuff."</p>

<p>The young man looked gratefully at the speaker, then turned his
gaze once more to the smoking crucible.</p>

<p>"I think I have discovered how to treat it," he said slowly.
"The chlorine must be brought into contact with another gas
offering a greater affinity than gold: on their combination the
gold will be set free in a metallic state, and can be saved in the
ordinary way. All we have to do is to pump hydrogen gas into a vat
containing a solution of the clayey mixture, keep emptying off the
slimes, and in time the residue must be a highly concentrated gold
wash. It's not very difficult, is it? I only need those acids to
prove the practical working of the scheme."</p>

<p>Mackay remained silent for a moment, apparently deep in
thought.</p>

<p>"You'll do it, Bob," he broke out eagerly. "Dead Broke should be
back wi' the acids any time now, an' you'll be able to finish your
tests; but I hae no doubt ye'll accomplish what we all wish, an'
ye'll deserve your reward, my laddie."</p>

<p>About noon of the same day Dead Broke Dan was sighted in the
distance, returning with the camel team, much to the relief of all
in camp, for he was already a full day overdue.</p>

<p>"I was a bit skeert that ole Dead Broke had anchored himself in
the township," growled Nuggety Dick, as they all congregated at his
shaft to watch the lumbering train approach.</p>

<p>"If he drove the animals like that all the way," hazarded Never
Never Dave, "he could hiv been here two days ago. Why, the old
heathen <i>is</i> forcing the pace."</p>

<p>The camels were certainly travelling at an unusually rapid rate;
heavily laden as they were, they were actually ambling over the
sand, and old Dead Broke Dan was running energetically alongside,
plying his long whip with a will.</p>

<p>"I can't make it out," said Mackay. "Dead Broke knows well
enough that it's dangerous to rush those brutes in that fashion.
There must be something wrong."</p>

<p>Something apparently was wrong, for when the great hulking
beasts staggered into camp, their flanks were heaving convulsively,
and their mouths were flecked with foam. Their driver, too, seemed
in the last stage of collapse.</p>

<p>"There's a rush comin', mates," he panted. "Macguire's gang
followed me out from Kalgoorlie. I tried to shake them off an'
doubled back on my own tracks, but they've got horses and buggies,
an' I couldn't lose them, no matter how I dodged. They camped
less'n a mile from me last night; but I didn't unload the camels,
an' scooted about one o'clock in the morning so as to get in ahead
to tell you."</p>

<p>"We couldn't have kept it quiet much longer anyhow, boys," said
Nuggety Dick. "An' I don't think we'd have minded a decent crowd
comin' to the flat, but Macguire's a holy terror, and his gang are
a tough party to handle."</p>

<p>"There's one howlin' satisfaction, mates," laughed Emu Bill.
"They'll get nothin' but that miserable miradgy clay outside our
pegs. I kin just fancy I hear Macguire's words when he sees his
gold vanish." He grinned delightedly at the thought.</p>

<p>Mackay did not say much, he knew that a rush was inevitable, but
Macguire was not exactly the kind of man he would care to have as a
near neighbour. He was a noted bully, card-sharper, and
mine-jumper, though he ostensibly kept an hotel in the township
where men of a similar fraternity were wont to congregate.</p>

<p>"How many are in the crowd, Dead Broke?" he asked.</p>

<p>"'Bout a dozen, I calc'late."</p>

<p>"And we are only eight," mused Mackay.</p>

<p>"You don't think the sneakin' thief will try to jump this here
circus?" ejaculated Nuggety Dick.</p>

<p>"You may just bet your boots the same individual'll no work
himsel' if he can find it already done for him," came the answer.
"I shouldna wonder a bit if we have some trouble. What are you
grinning at, you young baboon?" he demanded, turning to the Shadow,
who appeared to find much cause for merriment in the doubtful state
of things.</p>

<p>The Shadow subsided at once. "Man boss," he complained
reproachfully, "does ye think we is a gentle little Sunday-school
party, just waiting to be swallowed?"</p>

<p>Mackay snorted in disgust. "If it werena for these laddies," he
said to himself, "I would dearly enjoy a scrimmage; but I seem to
have become mair cautious since they've been wi' me. It's no richt
that they should see the wickedness o' human nature in its worst
aspect a' at aince."</p>

<p>"I see them coming!" cried Bob, who was scanning the horizon
closely, and a dim sand cloud in the far eastward distance was sure
enough evidence that the rush would ere long be in their midst.
Soon the various outlines of horsemen and buggies could be traced
amid the enveloping dust; quickly the frenzied gold-seekers drew
near, and wild halloos mingled with the cracking of whips, and the
laboured plunging of horses' hoofs on the ironshot sand plain.
Ahead of the main party, mounted on a powerful bay horse, which he
was cruelly spurring on to its last effort, rode Macguire, a tall,
awkward brute of a man, whose heavy countenance as he came near,
bore the exulting leer of the professional braggart and bully. At a
mad gallop he forced his jaded beast right up to Nuggety Dick's
shaft, then halted with a vicious jerk on the curb rein, and
surveyed the awaiting group with a triumphant grin.</p>

<p>"So you thought you were goin' to run this show yourselves," he
sneered from his position in the saddle.</p>

<p>"I guess you've struck it plumb first shot," calmly returned Emu
Bill, rolling his quid in his mouth with evident relish, and
ejecting a streak of tobacco juice which came dangerously near to
finding a resting-place on the new-comer's boots.</p>

<p>Macguire snarled, and looked round to see if his satellites were
near at hand, and, noting their close proximity, he jumped from his
horse, threw the reins carelessly over a mulga sapling, and
examined the stacked wash on the surface with unconcealed joy.</p>

<p>"An' who was the discoverer o' this bonanza?" he demanded,
aggressively, addressing every one in general.</p>

<p>Nuggety Dick gave a snort of annoyance. "For a mean impertinent
swab ye beat anything I've ever met," said he, in his politest
tones. "An' if ye doesn't take yer miserable carcase clear o' my
pegs instanter, ye'll find what ye're lookin' for in about two
shakes o' a muskittie's eyelid."</p>

<p>At that moment the rest of Macguire's Rush appeared on the
scene, and with boisterous laughter hurried to range themselves by
their chief's side. They were a motley crew, comprising the very
worst product of the goldfields, and they glared at the owners of
Golden Flat with uncontrolled malevolence. Macguire eyed his choice
associates with satisfaction, before responding to Nuggety Dick's
peremptory request, then he turned the flood-gates of his wrath
loose on that amiable gentleman, who listened with dangerous
<i>sang froid</i>. War was certainly imminent, but before the
actual outbreak had occurred, Mackay left his position beside Jack,
and stepped forward.</p>

<p>"This is my quarrel, Nuggety," said he. "The gentleman was
looking for the discoverer o' the flat, an' I should be sorry if he
went away before makin' my acquaintance."</p>

<p>The tone was quiet almost to mildness, and Jack and Bob
marvelled much thereat; but the Shadow laughed softly to
himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was you, was it?" blustered Macguire. "An' why in
thunder didn't ye report to me? We might have come peaceably at
first, but now we mean to boost ye out of it. I know ye hasn't
registered yer find, for I has watched the Warden's office ever
since you an' them youngsters passed through the township, an'
there's been no notices posted. Now I calc'late we'll just begin
where you leave off, an' we are obliged to ye for doin' so much
work for us. Ain't that right, boys?"</p>

<p>A yell of approbation greeted his words.</p>

<p>"You've made a vera serious error," said Mackay, with unruffled
serenity. "You've neglected to consider that we keep guns in camp,
an' there's twa or three o' them lookin' at ye now. Furthermore, we
were just dyin' for a scrimmage when you popped your ugly head
along, an', though ye beat us by two in numbers, I dinna just feel
tremblin' wi' anxiety over the finish o' the circus. No, no,
Macguire, ye canna bluff this crowd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does ye know who I am?" howled Macguire. "I'm the champion
bruiser o' the fields, I is."</p>

<p>"And ye look it every time," retorted Mackay. "But before we
gang in for wholesale bloodshed, we'd better settle our personal
differences. I hae objected strongly to your unmannerly
inceevility&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho!" roared the bruiser, rolling up his shirt-sleeves
with professional exactitude. "Now, boys, the funeral is off until
I knock this rooster out."</p>

<p>"Right O!" came the ready response from the hired ruffians, who
never doubted for a moment the all-conquering prowess of their
chief.</p>

<p>Nuggety Dick, Emu Bill, Jack, the Shadow, and Bob, quietly
ranged themselves on one side, their hands gripping the butts of
the revolvers in their belts. In the near distance, beyond the
windlass, with rifles resting on the timber for greater steadiness,
Never Never Dave and Dead Broke Dan kept the deadly tubes gazing at
Macguire's band, much to these warriors' disquietude. It had been
Mackay's idea to have them thus prepared; the wisdom of it was
already clearly evidenced.</p>

<p>And now Bob and Jack trembled for the safety of their friend.
Macguire was both taller and broader than Mackay, and his short
bull neck and bloated features gave him a decidedly repulsive
appearance. But to their astonishment Mackay's face betrayed not
the slightest trace of concern, though his eyes shone with a
strange light. He had taken upon himself the battle of the entire
camp, and he knew it.</p>

<p>With a yell Macguire rushed to the attack, and his right hand
lunged ponderously forward, only to find itself warded lightly
aside. Wildly he attempted to guard with his left; but Mackay's
blow came like a lightning stroke, straight from the shoulder, and
was not to be denied. Macguire staggered under the shock of the
concussion, but recovered himself, and with savage rage struck
blindly again and again at his antagonist's head, only to find his
great fists beat the empty air. Mackay simply warded off the vain
strokes, and stood his ground, a grim smile beginning to dawn on
his features. He had discovered the weakness of his opponent;
Macguire's strength was his whole support&mdash;one of his terrible
blows would have proved fatal to most men&mdash;and so had his
reputation grown! But Mackay's anger burned fierce within him, and
he waited his chance; it soon came. Macguire, aroused to an
extraordinary pitch of ferocity, made again a desperate swinging
stroke at his enemy's head with the usual futile result; but ere he
could recover from the impetus of his foolish action Mackay's great
fists caught him full in the face, one after the other, with a
force that hurled the bully over in the sand. But all was not over
yet; the bruiser had evidently no lack of animal courage. He picked
himself up slowly, peered through his fast closing eyes to locate
his enemy, and leaped like a demoniacal savage once more to the
fray. Disdaining to strike the half-blind wretch, Mackay stood
unmoved, and so gave the cunning trickster the chance he desired.
The long, octopus arms of Macguire gripped him tight, and his
breath spurted forth in fierce gasps. A groan of dismay broke from
Jack, and a yell of delight from Macguire's supporters greeted this
action. Now, indeed, it was to be a trial of strength. Backwards
and forwards they swayed, bending, twisting, writhing, stumbling,
but through it all the Shadow noticed with joy how gradually, yet
surely, Mackay's brawny arms were tightening over the great bulk of
his antagonist. For a moment there was a lull, the crucial point
had come, and the combatants stood immovable; the muscles of
Mackay's arms strained out like whipcords. Crack! crack! something
seemed to have given way. Mackay relaxed his hold, and with a groan
and a shiver the towering form of Macguire subsided in the sand and
lay inert. Both sides had watched the last struggle of the giants
with breathless interest; and the final collapse of Macguire
aroused from his supporters only a hushed exclamation of awe. The
victor stepped forward to them at once.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," he said pleasantly, "if you like, we'll begin the
circus. Your leader has got a couple or so ribs broken, so you'd
better not count on him much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! no!" they shouted in unison; and one of them, constituting
himself spokesman for the party, gave vent to their
impressions.</p>

<p>"After that," he said weakly, "we don't want no more fight. Let
us peg alongside somewheres. We promise to act straight with
you."</p>

<p>A shuddering murmur of approval followed his words. Mackay had
indeed done battle for the entire camp that day.</p>

<p>Then the Shadow broke out. "Didn't I tell you, Jack?" cried he,
prancing around gleefully.</p>

<p>"By the Great Howlin' Billy, I've never seen a fight like
that&mdash;no, never," impressively spoke Never Never, coming
forward.</p>

<p>Neither Bob nor Jack said a word, their hearts seemed too full
for speech; but Mackay guessed their thoughts.</p>

<p>"It had to be done, my laddies," said he, kindly. "I thought my
fighting days were over; but it wasna to be&mdash;it wasna to
be."</p>

<p>After that order reigned. Some of Macguire's gang sullenly went
off to peg out claims beyond the Golden Promise Mine; others busied
themselves erecting a huge tent into which their fallen chief was
carried, groaning and cursing by turns. Then the holders of Golden
Flat returned to their labours with buoyant energy, and continued
excavating the golden wash as if nothing untoward had happened to
mar the even tenor of their way. Bob having received the acids he
had so eagerly awaited, was soon lost in the mazes of calculative
experiments beside his crucibles and test-tubes. The Shadow and
Jack slogged away with steady persistency at the bottom of the
shaft. Mackay calmly smoked the pipe of peace at the windlass head,
now and again breaking out into unmelodious song to the great
discomfort of all within hearing distance. Indeed, since his
desperate encounter he seemed to have become unusually cheerful;
and Bob, hearing the distracting strains, laughed softly to himself
and pondered deeply on this further illustration of a many-sided
nature. That evening, however, he was destined to be further
surprised, for Mackay, having finished his tea, went quietly to a
small mysterious-looking box which he kept under his bunk, and
which neither of the boys had ever seen him open before, and from a
recess within the lid he extracted&mdash;a flute.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" feebly murmured the Shadow, who was present, glaring
at the instrument with exaggerated horror.</p>

<p>Jack laughed outright, but checked himself suddenly when the big
man began to play. Never had he heard sweeter music; the mellow
notes rang out with exceeding softness as the great and somewhat
battered fingers of the musician strayed over the keys. No paltry
tune was this, no music-hall ditty; it was the "Miserere" from Il
Trovatore he played, and with such haunting sweetness that Bob
rubbed his eyes and looked at him in amazement. It was no joke,
then, this strange man's professed love of music, and his thoughts
went back to the evening they had spent in London. The last
long-drawn-out note trembled to a finish; and Mackay's voice broke
in on his reverie.</p>

<p>"What do you think o' that, Bob?"</p>

<p>"It was beautiful," said Bob, soberly.</p>

<p>"Ah, my ain whustle canna compare wi' the flute," sighed Mackay,
dolorously, applying his mouth once more to his treasure. Then he
hesitated. "I think I'll play ye that bonnie tune we heard at the
Queen's Hall," said he, reflectively. "D'ye mind what it was,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," responded that youth, with alacrity. "It was
'Home, Sweet Home!'"</p>

<p>The questioner looked grieved. "That sang doesna come into my
<i>repertoire</i> when I'm oot in the bush," he reproved
sternly.</p>

<p>"You meant, 'Lo, hear the gentle lark,'" said Bob.</p>

<p>The flautist nodded. "One, two, three, and off she goes," said
he; and at once the liquid strains of Bishop's wonderful music
echoed through the tent, with its trills and cadenzas, and with, it
must be confessed, many variations from the original melody. Ere he
had finished nearly all the camp were clustered at the door; even
Macguire's party was represented. Then the spell was broken.
Evidently the volume of sound created by the flute did not quite
satisfy the player's desire for a fuller burden of song. He laid
down the flute. "Watch me catch that top note," said he, and, with
grim desperation, he opened his mouth and began, "'Lo! hear the
gentle la-a-a-a-ark&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>A yell of horror from the doorway, and a sudden trampling of
feet intimated that the bulk of his audience had taken flight. The
Shadow squirmed in agony, Jack shuddered, and Bob looked
pained.</p>

<p>"Ah, weel," grunted the singer apologetically, pausing in his
valiant effort, "I couldna expect ye to appreciate such vera
high-class music, but haud on a bit an' I'll gie ye a verse o' my
ain construction, set to music o' my vera ain composition; it is
called 'The Muskittie's Lament.'"</p>

<p>Straightway he started, and bellowed out this touching little
story, in a voice so raucous that even the parrots fluttering in
the scrub around screamed out noisily in protest.[*] When he had
finished, the Shadow and Jack had vanished, and Bob alone was left
to thank him as best he could.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "THE MUSKITTIE'S LAMENT.<br>
<br>
"A bright wee muskittie sat on a tree,<br>
An' O, it was hungry as hungry could be,<br>
An' the tears drappit doon frae its bonnie blue ee,<br>
As it sighed and looked sad for Australia."]</p>

<p>But he was happily spared this call on his prevaricative powers,
for the vocalist did not give him an opportunity of expressing his
opinion.</p>

<p>"Ye dinna look exactly overjoyed wi' my singin'," said he,
quizzically, "but ye must admit it's vera effective."</p>

<p>Bob laughed, but did not venture to disagree.</p>

<p>"Ay," continued Mackay, with a chuckle, "my voice has wonderfu'
movin' powers, though, like my whustle, it's mebbe a wee bit trying
at close quarters." He proceeded to the box once more, and, to
Bob's surprise, extricated a sextant from its depths. He gazed at
it tenderly for a few moments, then handed it to his companion, who
seized it eagerly, and examined it with deep interest. It was an
instrument which had, apparently, seen considerable service, for
the handle was grooved by much fingering, and the lacquer on the
framework was blistered by the sun's rays, and altogether bare in
places. But the silvered arc itself was in perfect condition, and
the thin coating of vaseline over it showed that its present owner
knew how to take care of the delicate fabric. Mackay gazed
curiously on during the young man's work of inspection. It was
almost dark now in the tent, the last glimmering rays of the
setting sun alighted on the reflecting glasses of the sextant and
danced thereon joyously for a moment, then the heavy gloom of night
fell, and still Bob clutched the symbol of his unuttered desire,
while Mackay seemed wrapt in silent meditation. At length the elder
man spoke.</p>

<p>"That was the chief's sextant, Bob," said he, gravely. "It was
the only thing I found near the camp where he and his expedition
were murdered."</p>

<p>"I almost guessed that," answered Bob; then he hesitated. "I
wish you would let me try an observation with it," he concluded
with earnestness.</p>

<p>"Let you?" cried Mackay. "I want you to do it. Do ye remember,"
he continued musingly, "o' me sending you a book on navigation;
well, that was because I wanted to influence your studies in that
direction. I canna say whether I have succeeded or
no'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bob laughed grimly. "My father was a sailor," said he. "His
brother was a navigator; and I&mdash;I would dearly like to be able
to steer a course as well."</p>

<p>"My lad," said Mackay, "you'll maybe get your wish sooner than
you expect. I brought out the sextant just to sound you, for nae
man can say that Mackay persuaded him against his will; but I see
that the same blood runs in the family. Take the sextant, Bob; I
give it to you, though it is my dearest possession. Handle it
carefully; it has proved true on mony a long weary journey. But
mind, I may ask ye to use it in earnest soon."</p>

<p>Without another word he arose and walked from the tent, leaving
Bob alone in the darkness, his mind filled with rushing thoughts.
When Jack came in, about half an hour later, and lit a candle, he
found him in the same place. Truly the touch of the mystic emblem
had aroused in him the uncontrollable indefinite longing which is
the sure birthright of the wanderer. The call of the bush seemed to
echo through his brain, the boundless horizon beckoned him.</p>

<p>Jack's entry helped to throw off the spell which had gripped
him. He arose and placed the sextant carefully back in its case
beside the flute.</p>

<p>"What on earth is that, Bob?" asked Jack, anxiously. "Not
another musical instrument, surely."</p>

<p>"We'll have a look at it to-morrow, Jack," answered Bob. "It's a
sextant which Mackay has given me."</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" ejaculated the irrepressible youth, "can he use a
sextant too?"</p>

<p>Bob smiled. "I don't know," said he, "but I wouldn't be too
sure."</p>

<p>"He is a regular daisy," commented Jack, enthusiastically. "Why,
up at Nuggety's camp, he's explaining to them the theories of
music, and I'm hanged if he hasn't got them half convinced that it
is their uncultivated ear that is at fault when they don't
appreciate his singing."</p>

<p>A commotion from without the tent interrupted them, and the
Shadow's voice shouted loudly on Jack.</p>

<p>"I've just rounded up a real beauty o' a snake at my camp," said
he, when they appeared. "Come along, an' I'll show ye how to crack
him like a whip." And the three departed.</p>

<p>On the following morning Macguire's followers considered it
advisable that their damaged leader should be taken, without
further delay, to the township hospital, and shortly after daybreak
a buggy and a couple of horses were waiting in readiness for the
journey. This sudden decision on the matter was by no means
agreeable to Mackay, and he hastily called a meeting of the
claim-holders in order to state his fears.</p>

<p>"You know, boys," said he, "we've never registered these mines
at the Warden's office, as that bully Macguire seems to know, an'
our miners' rights are only good enough so long as we are the
strongest party."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't need to try and keep the Flat a secret now,"
growled Emu Bill. "We're bound to have half Kalgoorlie alongside us
in a day or so."</p>

<p>"Ye don't seem to catch on to our difficulty, boys," continued
Mackay. "If Macguire gets into the Warden's office first, he can
simply register these mines in his own ugly name, along wi' his
partners, of course, an' then, all they've got to do is swear
<i>we</i> jumped them, an' we'll get fired out o' our own claims
wi' a squad o' mounted police!"</p>

<p>"By Jupiter! I believe you're right," cried old Dead Broke
Dan.</p>

<p>"But what in thunder is we to do?" complained Nuggety Dick. "If
we had a horse we could beat him; but the camels are too mighty
slow."</p>

<p>"Ah, now you've struck it," agreed Mackay. "But ye must remember
it's a seventy-mile dry stretch from here to Kalgoorlie, an' their
horses are pretty well knocked up now. It should take them a good
two days to do it, even if they force for all they're worth."</p>

<p>At this stage the Shadow pushed his way forward. "I knows what
Mackay is thinking," said he; "but I'm the man for the job, an' I'm
goin' to do it too."</p>

<p>"Do ye think ye could manage, Shad?" asked Mackay, earnestly.
"I'm no goin' to mak' a single remark aboot your bushmanship, for
you've well proved your abilities in that direction, but, my lad,
it's a job for a strong man, an' I meant to tak' it on mysel'."</p>

<p>"Ye doesn't know how powerful I is on the trot," said the lithe
young bushman; "an' if it comes to strength, I reckon I is no
chicken, either."</p>

<p>He bared his right arm proudly, and showed the swelling muscles
which his tattered shirt-sleeve covered.</p>

<p>"Why, what does ye mean to do?" demanded Nuggety, like his near
neighbours, somewhat bewildered. "Does ye mean to walk?"</p>

<p>"Give me a water-bag in my fist, and I'll pretty soon show you,"
came the quick retort. "I'll bet a tug at old Dead Broke's whiskers
that I'm in before the buggy all right."</p>

<p>It seemed a hopeless plan, yet, owing to the arid and sandy
nature of the country to be traversed, it was not as hopeless as it
looked.</p>

<p>"If we let them get away first," said Mackay, "they won't think
there's any need to hurry. Go an' swallow as much water as you can,
an' get your water-bag primed up to the muzzle. Jack, you'd better
make enough sandwiches from that damper of yours to carry the
Shadow a couple o' days."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I go too, Shad?" said Jack, anxiously.</p>

<p>"You're a bit too fresh yet, Jack; you'd want too much water,"
was the sententious reply.</p>

<p>Jack turned away without a word to prepare the sandwiches.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the buggy containing Macguire and one of his
chosen associates drove up, and stopped opposite the party, so that
the departing bully might get rid of some of his vituperative
eloquence. When he saw Mackay, his raging madness was painful to
witness. Clearly his enmity, instead of dissolving, had been
magnified tenfold by his humiliation.</p>

<p>"I'll get even with you for this," he yelled, shaking his fist
at the object of his fury; "an' ye won't live long before ye knows
it too."</p>

<p>Mackay stepped menacingly towards the buggy. "I ought to have
killed ye, ye meeserable thief," he said; but the man holding the
reins was too terrified to wait longer. With a wild slash of the
whip he set the horses plunging madly across the sand on the back
track to the township, and Macguire, leaning back with livid face,
hurled his last shot.</p>

<p>Mackay smiled a hard smile. "Then I reckon ye'd better get out
of it while you're healthy," he murmured, as he turned to rejoin
his companions.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch6"></a>Chapter 6. The Shadow's Great Effort</h2>

<p>The grinding rush of the wheels in the sand had scarcely died
away when the Shadow appeared ready for his journey. He carried a
water-bag in his hand, and his meagre commissariat outfit was tied
up in a glazed cloth slung over his shoulder. He was not impeded by
a superabundance of garments; a torn shirt flung open at the neck,
a much frayed soft hat turned down all around the brim to keep the
scorching sun from his eyes, and a light pair of much-worn khaki
pants, held in position by a narrow belt, completed his sartorial
glory. His sockless feet were thrust loosely into shoes that had,
by their appearance, seen considerable service; he had chosen them
because of their once heavy soles being ground down to comparative
lightness. He waited impatiently while Mackay drew out a rough
sketch of the mines and their position, which was to give the
Warden the necessary information for registration.</p>

<p>"And mind, Shadow," said Mackay, handing him the paper amid an
impressive silence, "ye must steer in by the south; it will mean a
longer journey, but if you don't go wide o' Macguire to the extent
o' five miles or so, he's bound to see you, and you could never
hope to get in afore him then."</p>

<p>The Shadow tucked the note carefully away in a lurking corner of
his flowing shirt.</p>

<p>"You leave the circus to me, an' don't worry," he said, with a
grin. "Ta, ta, boys, I'm off. How's this for the Flying Dutchman?"
He set his face to the west and dashed away into the desert at an
odd uneven trot.</p>

<p>"He can't keep that up, surely?" said Bob, watching the runner
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I'll bet he jig-jogs like that all day," said Emu Bill. "He's
got the real bushman's style o' gettin' over ground, he has."</p>

<p>Mackay watched the fleeing figure doubtfully for a time, then a
satisfied look lit up his face as he noted the unerring course the
Shadow was making.</p>

<p>"He'll hit the township straight as a die," said he. "That ugly
sinner, Macguire, was heading too far to north'ard or I'm very much
mistaken."</p>

<p>Macguire's associates at the end of the Flat were now observed
to be in a state of considerable confusion. They could not fail to
realize that the mission had been dispatched for one purpose, and
they glared after the disappearing messenger with anger and dismay
on their hardened countenances.</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on them, boys," warned Mackay. "We'll soon know
whether we were richt in our ideas."</p>

<p>He walked back to the tent with Bob, and when they arrived there
two of the suspected gang approached apparently in deep sorrow.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you give your message to Hawkins?" said one. "Though
he's driving Macguire, he'd have done anything you wanted in the
township. We doesn't bear no grudge, we don't."</p>

<p>"The fact is, we don't trust you worth a cent," answered Mackay,
shortly.</p>

<p>At this stage Emu Bill hurried up in a state of some
perturbation. Wholly ignoring the presence of the innocent twain,
he burst out&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's wan o' them cusses just dodged into the bush carrying a
saddle an' bridle!"</p>

<p>At this the protesting pair seemed to realize that their cunning
ruse was up.</p>

<p>"An' ye can bet," cried the one who had not yet spoken, "that
Harkins'll catch up on the boss afore sundown, an' they'll be in
Kalgoorlie by mornin'. He's goin' to ride Macguire's Furious, he
is," he snarled triumphantly.</p>

<p>He hopped out of the way just in time to avoid being gripped in
the clutches of the man he so wholesomely dreaded; but his
neighbour was not quite so alert, and, as he turned to run, a
well-directed kick lent impetus to his flight.</p>

<p>"I suppose the skunks'll beat us, after all," said Mackay,
grimly, "Their horse bells are sounding quite close. Where's
Jack?"</p>

<p>Emu Bill grinned. "I think the young'un anticipated you, Mac,"
said he. "He vanished into the bush when he noticed the cuss
walking off wi' the saddle."</p>

<p>"If he can unhitch the bells and drive the horses north a bit,
it'll take friend Harkins a day to find them," grunted Mackay, in
great good humour.</p>

<p>"You can rely on Jack," said Bob, decisively; and just then a
confused jangling of the horse bells rang out, followed by an
absolute stillness.</p>

<p>A few moments later the crackling of the bush in the far
distance, and the thudding of many hoofs in the sand, intimated
that Jack knew his work to the letter.</p>

<p>"By thunder!" roared Emu Bill, excitedly. "The youngster has
taken off their hobbles."</p>

<p>So it turned out. Jack had grasped the situation at once when he
saw the man slink off with saddle and bridle in the direction of
the horses. His intuitive powers were wonderfully bright, and his
actions followed quickly on his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I've got to get there first," he muttered to himself, as he
dashed impetuously through the bush.</p>

<p>He found the horses clustered together under the shade of a
coolibah tree. Poor animals, their owners had hobbled their
forefeet very tightly in order to keep them from straying far, and
after vainly trying to find some edible substance amid the
inhospitable sands, they huddled together in a piteous group, and
bit nervously at the parched eucalyptus twigs over their heads. It
was a country for camels only&mdash;these wiry brutes can eat
anything; but for horses it was a barren wilderness. Jack had no
difficulty in approaching them, and he quickly undid their bell
straps and flung the noisy tell-tales on the ground, but when he
attempted to drive the tired creatures they simply would not move,
their hobble straps were too closely fixed to allow of them even
making much of an effort. There was little time for delay, already
the confident whistle of Harkins sounded perilously near. Jack
would have no half measures, unhesitatingly he undid the binding
thongs, and at once the entire mob with wild neighs galloped
off.</p>

<p>"As Mackay would say, it won't be judicious for me to wait here
long," the wily youth soliloquized. "Let me see, the sun was on my
right hand when I left camp; that means I've got to keep it on my
left now." And he vanished speedily, missing Harkins, the horse
hunter, by but a few yards. His welcome when he returned was hearty
in the extreme.</p>

<p>Nuggety Dick laughed uproariously. "Why, look at the brutes,"
said he, pointing westward across the plain where the still
galloping horses were visible. "They're right off home, they are.
Blow me tight, Jack, I'll give you one of my best nuggets for that
when the battery comes along."</p>

<p>Mackay's tribute was characteristic. "Your power o' observation
is developing real well, my laddie," he said, "an' your calculative
propensities are grand. It's a great thing to hae the gift o'
initiative, Jack. You see, if you had waited to tell me about your
plan, it would hae been too late to act on it. I'll gie ye a tootle
on the flute for that the nicht, I will." And Jack felt more than
amply repaid for his adventure.</p>

<p>Ere long the weary Harkins returned to his associates, still
carrying the saddle and bridle, and feeling very wroth indeed. The
disgust and chagrin of the checkmated crew was full and deep, and
they sulked in their tent all day, nor once again ventured to
approach their smiling neighbours.</p>

<p>And all this time the happy-go-lucky Shadow was plugging along
over the thirsty desert sands, looking neither to the right nor
left, yet instinctively steering a straight course for his goal
beyond the distant horizon. Mile after mile he traversed with
dogged determination, nor did he once falter in his peculiar
ambling gait. And the sun rose high in the heavens, and the burning
rays smote fiercely on the crown of the Shadow's dilapidated hat,
while the roasting sands scorched through his flimsy shoes. Yet
still he never halted.</p>

<p>"I'll show them what I kin do," he repeated to himself as he
ran, with savage joy. "I'll show them that the knockabout, hard-up,
down-on-his-uppers Shadow can keep his end up wi' any one." Then
the finer trait would show itself in his musings. "It's Mackay's
last rise. I knows he is all broke up since Bentley went under, an'
he's been good to me. Hang it! I must get in before that
cross-eyed, lop-eared bully," and his lithe body would spring
forward with renewed energy. A long pull at the water-bag, and a
hasty bite at the unpalatable damper he carried in his little
wallet, delayed him scarce five minutes. But when, crossing a dry
gully, a long sand snake wriggled across his path, he could not
resist the temptation of slaying it. "There's two things I never
sees use for in this world," he ruminated, as he set down to work
again, "an' these is snakes an' muskitties. I wonder what old Noah
meant by putting them in the ark...I must have covered 'bout thirty
miles by now. I wonder if I kin keep it up all night, an'&mdash;an'
I wonder if my boots'll hold out."</p>

<p>At sundown he halted to fix his bearings afresh. "I'm afraid I
is gettin' too far north," said he, "an' Mackay warned me to keep
to south'ard. I'd better wait till the Cross gets up. I feel sort
o' bushed without the sun, an' them hanged little stars never seem
to be in the same place. No, I'd be safer to sit tight an' wait for
the Cross." He had another drink from the water-bag, and munched
contentedly at his hard damper for a while; then his head began to
nod drowsily, and in a few moments the Shadow was fast asleep in
the sand, his face upturned to the myriad stars which now began to
twinkle in the sky.</p>

<p>How long he slept he knew not, but he awoke with a start,
vaguely conscious of some disturbing element in the air. The
Southern Cross shone radiantly far over the horizon, and the
constellation of Orion glittered placidly in the eastern sky. "I
ought to be kicked," said the Shadow, in intense disgust with
himself. "I calc'late it must be after midnight now, an' I has lost
four hours; bother my sleepy old hide." He arose wearily, and
gripped the precious water-bag, but he was no sooner on his feet
than he dropped again with alacrity, and lay flat on the sand, the
muffled sound of hoof-beats had reached his ear, and coming in his
direction.</p>

<p>"I'm a gone coon if they see me," he murmured. "Why in blazes
didn't I keep further to the south?" The Shadow did not doubt for a
moment that it was Macguire and his buggy which was approaching.
"The miserable sweep must have camped to give the horses a spell,"
he reasoned with sinking heart. Nearer and nearer came the
ghost-like echoes, then suddenly they stopped, and a plaintive
whinny rang out through the night. It was answered by another, and
yet another, but no sound of voices came to the eager listener's
ears. "That is mighty strange," thought he. "Macguire should be
cursing like a bullock-driver by now. I wonder what's happened?" He
raised himself cautiously on hands and knees and peered into the
eerie gloom, and as he gazed, half a dozen or so riderless horses
came forward at a gentle trot. "Brumbies!" grunted the Shadow.
"Wo-ah, my beauties!" To his surprise they halted, and whinnied
feebly, and the Shadow continued addressing endearing words to them
while he cautiously struggled to his feet. They were not brumbies,
that was certain, or they would have shied off in affright at once;
but the weary youth was not long in discovering what they were, and
a chuckle of huge delight issued from his lips as he at last got
his hand on the mane of one of his midnight visitors, and patted
its trembling nostrils. Indeed he could scarcely contain himself,
so deep was the joy he felt; he wanted to roll over in the sand and
howl in his ecstasy, but he could not very well do that and still
keep a grip of his charger's mane, so he contented himself by
indulging in a running commentary on his extraordinary luck while
he quickly unslipped the thin belt from his waist and deftly
insinuated the same into the wondering animal's mouth. "I wonder
how they managed to break their hobbles," said he. Then a light
seemed to dawn on him. "I'll swear Mackay had something to do wi'
it. Or Jack&mdash;Jack's got some savvy, he has. The animals was
goin' straight home, they was. Well, I reckon Macguire's Furious
will carry the poor weary blown-out Shadow, whether he wants to or
no."</p>

<p>To his annoyance his improvised bridle proved too short to join
over the high arched neck of the commandeered steed, and with a
rueful sigh the resourceful lad proceeded to rip off the sleeves of
his shirt and cut them into ribbons. This operation was conducted
under great difficulties, for Furious now seemed to regret his
former weakness, and was making strenuous efforts to justify its
name. He plunged and reared and kicked viciously, with the result
that he startled the other horses into flight. Then ensued a tug of
war; in vain the frantic horse strove to follow its neighbours; the
Shadow's grip on the leathern thongs was vice-like in its tenacity.
Round and round they struggled, but the odd bridle held fast, and
at length the fiery steed was brought to a standstill. In a trice a
thick stranded cord of shirt ribbons was added to the novel reins,
then with a whoop of triumph the daring youngster leaped to
Furious's back and clutched like a limpet.</p>

<p>To ride an intractable horse, bareback, is at no time a very
easy matter, and to ride a noted buckjumper like Furious with a
makeshift bridle and no saddle was a feat which few of the finest
horsemen in Australia would have cared to attempt. But lightly
recked the Shadow of disaster. Born and brought up on a far back
station in Victoria, he had been accustomed to horses since his
childhood, and no more daring rider could be found throughout the
length and breadth of the land. Down went Furious's head between
his knees, and his high back curved convulsively, as he strove by
all his fiery tactics to rid himself of his encumbrance. But the
Shadow rocked easily in his perch throughout it all; then, suddenly
asserting the mastery, he took his battered hat from his head, and
with it smote the beast lightly across the ears. For a moment the
infuriated animal stood stock still, trembling in every fibre,
then, with a snort of rage, he stretched out his long neck and,
like an arrow from the bow, darted off across the desert, taking
the interposing gullies at a leap, and crashing through narrow
timber belts like a thing possessed. The Shadow did not once
attempt to break its headlong pace, he knew the weakness of his
bridle too well for that; gently, insidiously, he tightened the
pressure on the off rein and brought his charger round on to the
course he wished to go.</p>

<p>"Now I reckon I'm on the rails all right," he said at length,
when the Southern Cross shone brightly on his left, and slightly
behind; "but blow me for a cross-eyed jackass if I haven't
forgotten the water-bag!"</p>

<p>His annoyance at this neglect was keen, though he did not seem
to consider that he could not have carried it with him in any case,
both of his hands having been very much occupied at the start in
controlling his unwilling mount. They had cleared the softer desert
country now, and had entered upon the hard-baked, ironshot plains
which frequently intervene in these latitudes, and now Furious
showed signs of failing in his stride, his unshod hoofs were ill
able to bear the pressing contact of the rounded diorite pebbles.
Then for the first time the Shadow tested the strength of the
doubtful reins, and pulled steadily and strongly. They held firm,
and the weary steed slowed down to an easy canter, and finally to a
walk.</p>

<p>"Whew!" ejaculated the reckless rider, mopping his damp brow. "I
reckon this one-man circus is a bit trying on the nerves. If the
hanged brute had tripped on a stump, or dived into a snag hole, it
would have been 'Good-bye, Shadow, and the crows will weep for ye
in the morning.' But it's a jolly long sight better'n walkin'.
Hillo, hillo! what has we struck now? Wo-ah, my pet lamb,
wo-ah."</p>

<p>Out of the darkness, almost straight ahead, the red glow of hot
ashes had become visible. While he watched the gentle night breezes
fanned the dying embers into feeble momentary flame, and there,
silhouetted against the blackness, was the buggy which had left
Golden Flat immediately in advance of the Shadow. The two horses
were dimly observable standing motionless and asleep among the
sparse scrub some little way off, while, wrapped in their blankets
beside the fire lay the huddled figures of Macguire and Hawkins
evidently also in deep slumber. The watcher whistled softly to
himself.</p>

<p>"By smoke," he murmured, "them beggars must have covered fifty
miles yesterday. The howlin' sneak has been skeert o' some one
comin' after. Gee whiz! What a be-eautiful shock he'll
get&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His reflections were arrested by a sudden movement of one of the
reclining men, and the harsh voice of Macguire reached his ears as
he strove to awaken his associate.</p>

<p>"Get up, ye dreamin' idiot, an' see if the horses are keepin'
handy. I want to get in when the Warden's office opens in the
mornin'."</p>

<p>A drowsy protesting murmur was all the Shadow could hear of the
reply. Then Macguire's unmusical accents were raised in angry
abuse.</p>

<p>"Ye doesn't think we can do it?" he snarled. "But I say we
shall, though the horses drop dead when we get there. I'll show
that infernal Scotsman what it means to run up agin Macguire. We'll
get a move on by sunrise, that'll give us three hours to get in by
nine o'clock."</p>

<p>He arose painfully to throw some brushwood on the fire, while
Hawkins, grumbling heartily, went in search of the horses. Silently
the Shadow swung Furious's head round, and made a wide detour.</p>

<p>"I reckon ye'll get left this time, ye yelping baboons," he
muttered, when he considered himself well out of range of the now
spreading firelight. "Ye'll move out by sunrise, will ye? I wonder
what time it is now." He surveyed the heavens intently; then his
gaze rested on a star of exceeding brilliance which had made its
appearance just over the horizon. "I calc'late that there shiner is
the star Mackay called Canopus," he said, "an' that means I've just
an hour afore the old sun pops his head up. Now, old thunder and
lightning, ye bold bad quadruped, ye hustled along fur yer own
pleasure, I reckon ye can do a bit of a spurt for mine." He leaned
forward and dug his heels into Furious's flanks; with a bound the
noble animal started forward, and once again the twain proceeded on
their headlong course.</p>

<p>The stars one by one vanished from the sky, and a wonderful rosy
glow gradually enveloped the silent bushland; it heralded the
approach of dawn. And now far in the western sky the watchful rider
began to perceive the smoke of the ever active smelters near the
township, and soon the white-roofed houses of the settlement were
plainly visible. Sure enough the Shadow had steered an unerring
course. He slowed down to a walk, and looked cautiously all round.
Nothing in the shape of man or beast was observable in the near
distance, but far off in the township the little street was crowded
with miners coming from and going to their work in the shafts.</p>

<p>"Shadow," murmured the contemplative youth, "I reckon ye'd
better get off an' walk if ye doesn't want to get collared for
horse stealing."</p>

<p>He prepared to slide down from his perch, but just then Furious,
having recognized his own stable so comparatively close at hand,
felt imbued with fresh energy. He pricked up his ears, gathered his
feet together for one ferocious buck, and was off like the wind.
The Shadow sat in the sand where he had been unceremoniously
deposited, still gripping fast the broken ribbons of the bridle
which had served him so well, and gazed reproachfully at the
departing steed.</p>

<p>"Ye're a mean, ungrateful hoss," he cried after it, severely.
"After me takin' ye back to your own stable, too, an'&mdash;an' I
didn't think there was a kick left in you." Words failed him, and
he gathered himself up, and weary and sore and stiff walked slowly
into the township.</p>

<p>It was about eight o'clock when he entered the main street which
was still an hour before the Warden's office opened; but the Shadow
had no intention of delaying his mission an instant longer than he
could help. A lively memory of Macguire's emphatically spoken
resolve to arrive at nine compelled him to adopt unusual tactics.
Heedless of the strange glances cast at him by the ultra
respectable gold-mining fraternity, he made his way to the Exchange
Hotel, where, as every one knew, the Warden was in the habit of
breakfasting, and hesitating not an instant, he entered the doorway
and turned into the fashionable room reserved for the cream of the
goldfields' aristocracy.</p>

<p>But his dilapidated attire and general aspect was too much for
the proprietor of the establishment, for it must be remembered that
the Shadow's shirt had already been largely used in the manufacture
of bridle reins. His toes, too, were peeping from sundry crevices
in his boots, and from head to foot he was covered with the grime
and dust of his long desert journey.</p>

<p>"What do ye want in here, ye young scarecrow?" demanded that
important personage, laying an unfriendly grasp on his visitor's
shoulder.</p>

<p>The Shadow sidled round, leaving another part of his unfortunate
garment in the hands of the spoiler.</p>

<p>"I want to see the Warden," he cried loudly, his temper
considerably ruffled, "an' I'll flatten ye out if ye try to stop
me...It's a matter o' life an' death," he added impressively.</p>

<p>"I am the Warden, my lad," spoke a kindly voice from the end of
the room, "but I'm not a doctor. Let the boy come up,
Jackson"&mdash;this to the proprietor. "Good honest sand won't hurt
any one, and you know water is scarce in this drought-stricken
country. Why, the man's hurt!" The kindly official was gazing at a
nasty gash on his visitor's bare arm from which the blood was
slowly trickling.</p>

<p>The Shadow looked and noticed his wound for the first time.</p>

<p>"It must have been that buster I got that did it," he reflected
quickly; "but I can't very well bring the horse into this here
conversation." Aloud he said, "Oh, that's nothin'; I tripped on a
stump in the dark, that's all."</p>

<p>The Warden examined the rent again closely and smiled
incredulously.</p>

<p>"All right, young man," said he; "now fire along with your
story, for I must be over at the office in half an hour."</p>

<p>There was no one else in the room at the moment, so pulling
Mackay's sketch plan of the mines from its hiding-place and putting
it on the table before the Warden, he reeled off the story of the
finding of Golden Flat and the attempted jumping of the mines by
Macguire and his party. The Warden listened patiently through it
all, nor did he once interrupt the narrator.</p>

<p>"So that's where the redoubtable Macguire went the other day,"
he commented, when the Shadow had finished. "And Mackay dished him
at his own game, did he? I tell you what, young fellow, I'd have
given a fiver to see that fight, I would."</p>

<p>"An' it would hiv been worth it," agreed the Shadow,
complacently. "But say, is ye goin' to make the claims right for
the boys at Golden Flat? Macguire'll be along in a
minute&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop right there, my lad. You've done your mates a great
service by getting in first, for if Macguire had seen me before you
I would have had no option but to make out the leases in his name.
But when you come to me from men like Mackay, Emu Bill, and Nuggety
Dick, pioneers every one, and tell me the story you have done, I
feel that my language won't be full enough to express my feelings
when I see that scoundrelly trickster, Macguire. But come, tell me
how you managed to get in ahead of him. You know I can scarcely
swallow that yarn about walking all the way. Why, it must be close
on an eighty-mile trail!"</p>

<p>Then the Shadow unburdened himself. "I was a bit skeert o' bein'
boosted up for horse stealin'," he explained finally, "so I climbed
off the savage critter 'bout half a mile back, an' blow me, if he
didn't do a buck at the last minute an' landed me on my back
instead o' my feet. I reckon that's how I got this here
scratch."</p>

<p>The Warden rang a small handbell on the table, and in due course
the landlord appeared.</p>

<p>"Jackson, let this young man have breakfast. He's come a long
way, and I guess he needs it." Then, when the man departed, "How
were you to know they weren't brumbies?" said he, quizzically.</p>

<p>A noisy demonstration in the street now attracted their
attention, and looking out through the window, behold, there was
Macguire's buggy proceeding past at a walk, though the lather of
foam on the horses' heaving flanks showed at what pace they had
been driven. Round the slowly moving conveyance several men were
clustered, and to them Macguire was talking eagerly, and apparently
much to their satisfaction, for at intervals they broke into lusty
cheers.</p>

<p>"These are some more of the loafers and deadbeats of the place,"
said the Warden. "Macguire will be telling them of his new
discovery. Well, it's nearly nine o'clock, I must be off. Just sign
your name across this plan of yours; yes, that's right. Now I'll
just scribble a line underneath." He took a blue pencil from his
pocket and wrote hastily, "Handed to me, the Warden of the Eastern
Goldfields District, duly certified, at 8 a.m., August &mdash;th,
1899." This he signed. "Now, I guess that's all right," he said
cheerily, reaching for his hat, "and I don't suppose I need tell
you, young man, that some one may be thirsting for your gore before
long."</p>

<p>The Shadow grinned. "Let him thirst," said he. "I reckon I kin
bounce any man o' the crowd exceptin' the boss bruiser hissel', and
I calc'late Mackay's fixed him safe enough for a day or so."</p>

<p>The Warden departed, and the light-hearted youth attacked the
breakfast which was brought to him with the ardour borne of a long
fast and an extremely hearty appetite.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, his erstwhile enemy, in the shape of
Jackson the hotel proprietor, came in and sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"I say, young 'un," he began in amiable tones, "did I hear you
say you were one of Mackay's party?"</p>

<p>"You didn't, unless you were listening at the door," came the
quick response.</p>

<p>Jackson's brows contracted; but he laughed not unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"There's no call for you to be so mighty slick wi' your speech,"
he said. "I was in the passage way, and heard you mention the name
of an old friend of mine, but I was not listening at the door. Why,
Mackay stayed with me a night when he passed through about a month
or so ago. He and I were mates in the good old roaring days."</p>

<p>The Shadow's face assumed an expression of grave concern.</p>

<p>"I climbs down, boss," said he, contritely. "I thought you might
have been trying to pump me for Macguire's benefit."</p>

<p>Jackson uttered an expression of deep disgust. "Why, that skunk!
I wouldn't be seen dead alongside o' him. He's the meanest,
rottenest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Shadow bolted the final portion of his breakfast in a hurry,
and held out a grimy paw. "Shake, boss," he said laconically. They
shook; and the now refreshed youth went once more into the history
of Golden Flat, retailing with gusto the wonderful encounter
between Macguire and Mackay. "His silly old bones cracked like pipe
shanks," he concluded, with reminiscent accurateness.</p>

<p>"By thunder!" ejaculated the appreciative listener, aroused to a
sudden sense of duty. "That broken-ribbed bruiser will have your
life if he sees you now. How do you mean to get back?"</p>

<p>"Walk," answered the Shadow, shortly.</p>

<p>"Walk be hanged. I'll lend you a horse; but you must look slippy
an' get away. I will come out myself an' see if I can get a decent
claim before the whole population rushes you; I can fetch the horse
back when I come." He arose hurriedly, evidently intent on seeking
out a steed right away, but at the door he stopped and looked back.
"What was that life-and-death racquet you worked on my tender
feelings?" he asked sternly.</p>

<p>"Dead sure thing," returned the Shadow, unabashed. "If Macguire
had got ahead o' me, Mackay would have squelched the life outen him
first chance. See?"</p>

<p>Jackson evidently saw, for he departed on his quest, laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>Left to himself the Shadow carelessly walked out into the
street, and as luck would have it blundered right into the trouble
his friends had been so anxious for him to avoid. Returning from
the Warden's office came Macguire and his aide-de-camp driving
furiously, and the roar of pent-up anger which burst from the
bully's lips on seeing the imperturbable Shadow step forth from the
hotel would have done credit to a full-grown grizzly bear that had
just been cheated of its supper. The buggy stopped with a jerk, and
as if by magic a motley throng crowded round.</p>

<p>"That's him! that's the young demon!" howled the discomfited man
in a perfect paroxysm of rage. "He stole my horse,
he&mdash;he&mdash;get out and kill the young cub, Hawkins. Get out
I say!"</p>

<p>"If I were you I reckon I'd sit tight," advised the Shadow,
serenely. "I could pretty well squash you in one act, I could."</p>

<p>And Hawkins was evidently of the same opinion, for he absolutely
refused to make any movement. With a baleful glitter in his
bloodshot eyes, Macguire himself stepped down; had the great
hulking brute but known it, he was at that moment no match for his
lithe and muscular adversary, who, in his conscious strength, stood
his ground unafraid. But there came a sudden interruption from the
outside of the interested crowd.</p>

<p>"None of that, Macguire, or I'll be forced to explain some
things you won't like."</p>

<p>It was a sharp authoritative warning, and it issued from the
Warden who now pushed his way to the front.</p>

<p>"He stole my horse," began the baulked ruffian in a voice hoarse
with suppressed passion.</p>

<p>"That's too thin, sir. From what I have heard, all your horses
returned home of their own accord this morning. In any case, if you
have a complaint to make, the public street is not a court
house."</p>

<p>A suppressed cheer broke from some of the bystanders, who had no
cause to love Macguire. He scowled fiercely at them as he climbed
back to his seat.</p>

<p>"I'll get even with you, you young thief, when there are no
interferin' Wardens about," he cried as he drove away, glaring with
impotent rage at the object of his exceeding wrath.</p>

<p>The Shadow smilingly waved him a polite adieu.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch7"></a>Chapter 7. Bob's Triumph</h2>

<p>It was three days after the Shadow's departure. The sun was
shining fiercely on Golden Flat, and its scintillating rays
reflected from the white mullock heaps at the various workings
caused the eyes of the miners when they came to the surface to
quiver and close painfully. The air was filled with dancing sand
particles, and they shimmered kaleidoscope-like in the intense heat
haze which rose and fell on the surface of the land like the waters
of a boundless ethereal sea. The regular thud, thud of picks
resounded loudly from the end of the lead where Nuggety Dick and
his brawny compatriots were doggedly digging out the golden gravel,
and away at the other end of the field Macguire's satellites made
noisy din as they busied themselves sinking several shafts over the
supposed trend of the mysterious channel.</p>

<p>The weather had been excessively hot since the Shadow left, and
this fact had done much to restore the spirits of the gang, for,
judging from their own feelings, they considered that the energy of
Mackay's messenger would be spent long before he could hope to
reach the township. At the Golden Promise the windlass was
deserted, and the red symbol hung limp overhead. But it was not
lack of energy that had occasioned this apparent lapse of duty.
Mackay and Jack had been in the tent all morning watching Bob's
final experiments with the refractory clay formation which were to
decide whether or no the great bulk of the Flat's treasure could be
saved to them. Bob's head was now quite better, but prolonged study
in a clime which is not adapted for acute mental effort had made
his young face appear drawn and haggard, yet his eyes shone with
the light of enthusiasm as he busied himself with his rather crude
appliances and set them in order for a last conclusive test. Mackay
had hastily constructed a small vat for him, made from the hardest
wood to be found in the bush, with an overflow tap some halfway up
its height. This the young chemist now quarter filled with the
crushed compound to be tested, and made up the level with water, to
which he afterwards added some salt.</p>

<p>"It will ensure its conductivity," he explained; but neither
Mackay nor Jack were much enlightened, so they held their peace.
Next a rubber tube, with an oddly-conceived wooden shield on its
exposed extremity was thrust into the receptacle, then a small
bottle containing some liquid which bubbled and effervesced
alarmingly, was brought forward, and its loose nozzle connected to
the free end of the tube.</p>

<p>"A simple method of generating hydrogen," said Bob dreamily,
"just iron pebbles and very dilute sulphuric acid." Mackay ventured
a non-committal grunt, but Jack's face now showed keen
appreciation. Lastly the two wires of a very small electric
battery&mdash;Bob's own manufacture&mdash;were connected to
corresponding metallic sheets lining the opposing ends of the vat.
"That is merely as an added assistance to help the decomposing of
the stuff into its elements," muttered Bob; then he fixed the
nozzle of the hydrogen generator tightly and stepped back.</p>

<p>At once a gurgling boiling sound arose from the vat, and its
contents swelled up in bubbling circles of slime and soapy ooze.
Mackay, obeying a motion from Bob, hastily pulled out the overflow
tap, and so caused the more solid matter within to subside. Again
Bob loaded the vat, and again Mackay allowed the foaming mass to
overflow, and never a word was spoken. The operation was repeated
until fully a hundredweight of the refractory substance had been
utilized, and by this time the floor of the tent was aswim with the
dense oily scum let loose.</p>

<p>"That should be enough to calculate on," said Bob. "And now
comes the crucial point." He undid all connections and handed the
muddy box to Mackay, who took it silently, and emptied the coarse
sandy residue into an awaiting gold-pan.</p>

<p>"It's lost its puggy nature, anyway," he commented, pouring on
it some water from a kerosene tin. He gave the pan a rapid swirl,
then an oblique turn, and gasped. The bottom of the basin was
literally covered with a thin film of the finest imaginable golden
grains, which blazed and sparkled in the penetrating sunlight!</p>

<p>Bob looked and heaved a sigh of profound thankfulness. Jack
looked, and celebrated his joy by whooping like a red Indian.
Mackay looked and looked, indeed, he did not once take his eyes off
the dazzling spectacle. Bob guessed his fears, and at once
dispersed them.</p>

<p>"It's the genuine article this time," he said with assurance.
"If it was going to melt away it would have done so in the acid
solution; but the fact is it has just been set free from the
solution, and so is now as stable and tangible as the sands of the
desert."</p>

<p>The rough, horny handed pioneer set the pan down on the floor,
and wiped the beaded perspiration from his forehead, then he
reached out his great fist and took Bob's hand in a fervent
grasp.</p>

<p>"It's no' often I have to acknowledge a better man than mysel',"
he said grimly; "but I must admit you've knocked the wind clean out
o' me wi' this grand process o' yours. Why, my laddie, it means
fortune for you in the years to come, an ever growin' fortune, for
ye can charge what ye like for your discovery. An' you little mair
than a youngster, too! Man, Bob, you've got a held that any
professor might well envy."</p>

<p>Bob laughed right heartily as he returned the elder man's grip.
The tension on his nerves had gone, and he felt almost constrained,
like Jack, to shout in his gladness.</p>

<p>"If it means fortune, I shall refuse to take more than my third
of it," he said, with grave emphasis. "This is a partnership
affair. I'd rather break the whole concern up now than make a
halfpenny that you two didn't share." Then he gave utterance to a
firm, fixed belief, which had done much to sustain him during his
intricate studies of the deceptive formation. "As for my youth," he
continued, with a smile, and addressing himself more directly to
Mackay, "I won't allow that that should entitle me to any credit,
for the same brain is with us always, and, surely, when it is
young, and fully developed, it should be able to grasp and evolve
theories which, when older, it would hesitate to accept. The beaten
track is so hard to forsake when one grows old in text-book
experience. If the ordinary science professor came along here now
and examined my theories concerning this stuff and its treatment,
without being shown their proof in practice, he would call them
absurd and irrational. And why? Because I have gone wide of all
precedent and text-book knowledge, and treated the compound for
gold in an unstable state, and in that unstable state it is not
supposed to exist." The young man spoke clearly and logically, yet
with an unusual twinkle in his keen blue eyes.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Mackay ventured a word of admonition.</p>

<p>"Too much study when the brain is young, Bob," said he, "is vera
dangerous indeed, though I quite agree wi' you in your line o'
argument. Young genius, hooever, blossoms an' dees like the flowers
of the spring&mdash;they never reach their summer; so the auld
fossilized, follow-my-leader blockheads exist and flourish an' are
aye wi' us. But I'll see that ye dinna work oot any more scientific
problems for a bit. It'll be a grand relaxation after this for you
to study the beauties o' Nature as shown in the Never Never country
back here." He laughed sardonically, and waved his hand towards the
unknown east.</p>

<p>"I'll be with you whenever you are ready," answered Bob,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"And I'll bet you won't shake me out of it," spoke up Jack; and
Mackay was comforted.</p>

<p>The sound of approaching footsteps was now heard outside the
tent. Mackay hastily seized the gold pan, and placed it out of
sight.</p>

<p>"Not a word aboot the discovery," he advised. "It will keep for
a bit, until we hear what Macguire's tactics are."</p>

<p>A second more, and Emu Bill popped his head inside. "Hang ye,
Mac," said he, "I've nearly burst myself hollerin' down that shaft
o' yours. I didn't think you'd be loafin' round at this time o'
day, I didn't."</p>

<p>"What's that you've got in your fist?" asked Mackay, evading all
explanations, and glancing at a huge, greyish fragment which Emu
Bill was carrying abstractedly about.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;that? That's another specimen I wanted to show ye. The
gold in it fairly howled at me down the shaft; but there ain't
enough in it now to fill a muskittie's eye. All my wash has made
into the humbuggin' stuff now. I'll have to give it best, boys, I
will."</p>

<p>The resigned melancholy of his voice worked strangely on the
feelings of Bob and Jack, and they gazed questioningly at Mackay,
who nodded.</p>

<p>"Ay, show it to him, Bob," said he. "I think the Emu kens well
enough hoo to haud his tongue."</p>

<p>"My goodness, mates," faltered Bill, in an awed whisper, when he
saw the pan, "that is an almighty fine prospect. I reckon it must
be twenty-ounce stuff. Where in thunder did ye get it?"</p>

<p>"It came from your shaft, Emu," said Bob. "It's the same
deceiving miradgy humbugging material as that you've got in your
hand. I've just found out how to bring back the gold after it fades
away."</p>

<p>Emu Bill stared in amazement. "Will somebody kindly kick me?" he
murmured feebly. "Is my sight goin' back on me again, or is it a
real honest fact that hits me on the optic nerve?"</p>

<p>But he was soon led to understand that the gold in the pan was
no delusion of the senses&mdash;that it was indeed a solid,
substantial quantity.</p>

<p>"I takes off my hat to you, Bob," he said, with a little catch
in his usually strong voice; and he suited the action to the word.
"This'll mean new life to the whole Flat; an' I hope it'll spell
fortune to you, my lad. What a pity Macguire's crowd got hitched on
alongside the Golden Promise. They'll hit it every time, most
likely; an', hang me! if they deserve it."</p>

<p>"We'll keep quiet aboot this discovery until we see how the bold
Macguire tackles on to the mirage," said Mackay. "The meeserable
thief may have jumped our ground in the Warden's office, for a' we
know."</p>

<p>Emu Bill grasped the situation at once. "I'm a thick-head," said
he. "Of course that bounder doesn't know; an' he won't know from me
nuther. Mums the word, it is; an' what a howlin' joy it will be to
see Macguire clutch on to the mirage. But I'll bet my boots, Mac,
that the Shadow has busted up his claim-jumping game. I knows the
young beggar, I does."</p>

<p>"An' so do I," said Mackay. "But I'll no blame him all the same
if he canna accomplish the impossible."</p>

<p>It was now well after midday, and Emu Bill departed to prepare
his lunch.</p>

<p>"I guess it's about time we had something to eat too," said
Jack, who had been of that opinion for over an hour, and the three
sallied out.</p>

<p>Jack was an expert at boiling the billy and making tea, and
Mackay had a wonderful knowledge of the art of bush cookery, so
that between them they always contrived to make a fairly palatable
repast, notwithstanding the unvaried nature of their stores. Bob
generally carried the water, or unearthed from their hiding-place
the few enamelled cups and plates necessary; but, as he said
himself, his assistance in matters culinary would never have been
missed. On this occasion he amused himself taking altitudes of the
sun with his cherished sextant, while his companions attended to
the more practical affairs. In one direction&mdash;slightly north
of west from the camp&mdash;the open desert could be traced without
interruption in the shape of scrub or hillocks, until it merged
into the distant horizon. Bob had discovered this two days before,
when he first endeavoured to make use of Mackay's gift, and he knew
that it was just about one o'clock in the afternoon that the
sextant reflectors would bring the sun down to this level line, and
so give a true declination without the use of an artificial
horizon. He ogled away in this direction now, keeping time by
Mackay's old but trusty chronometer which lay on the sand before
him, until Jack's call of "tucker"&mdash;which is the bush synonym
for all sorts and conditions of meals&mdash;caused him to seek his
wonted place at the open-air table.</p>

<p>"There is a dot or speck on the sky-line which I can't make
out," he said, placing the sextant down carefully at his side. "I
don't remember of it being there yesterday."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's a tree grown up like Jonah's gourd," laughed Jack.
"Have some more tea, Bob; and you'll see two trees next time you
look!"</p>

<p>A little later Mackay lolled back in lazy satisfaction. "I
believe," he said with a chuckle, "that I'm just in the mood to gie
ye another verse o' 'The Muskittie's Lament.' I see Jack's no
feenished, so I'll be sure o' him listening to my masterpiece this
time." He lifted up his voice and sent forth a doleful wail as a
preliminary; then, noting the grieved countenances of his audience,
he relented. "I'll get my flute an' play ye a bit frae the
'Bohemian Girl' instead. I'm no' so sure that I could tackle that
high note in 'The Muskittie's Lament' on a fu' stomach."</p>

<p>He arose and walked to the tent, returning almost immediately
with his instrument. But before he sat down his eye happened to
glance over the unbroken track towards the west, and a frown
settled over his features.</p>

<p>"Your obstruction on the sky-line was a man on horseback, Bob,"
said he; "I hope he's no' another professional fighter, wha wants
me to chastise him into a humbler spirit."</p>

<p>Since the arrival of Macguire's party a further influx from the
outside world had been daily expected, for news of gold "strikes"
travels quickly, and the sudden exodus of nearly a dozen men from a
comparatively small centre could only be construed in one way.
Therefore, little more than passing interest was paid to the
approaching horseman, who was yet a considerable way off, and
Mackay, squatting down on the sand, blew at his flute right
merrily, and promptly forgot all about him. The boys, too, quickly
became enthralled with his melody, though with them there was
always the shivering dread that the flautist would burst into song,
and so break the spell that bound them. Many and various were the
airs he played, but at last he sought solace in the old Scotch
song, "Ye Banks and Braes o' Bonnie Doon," and the feeling which he
managed to infuse into the instrument was simply wonderful.</p>

<p>"Ay, my lads," said Mackay, when he had finished, "there's
naething like the auld Scots sangs for awakenin' kindly memories o'
the land we're aye so glad to get away from. I'm no so sure, mind
you, that it isna good fur us whiles to have a wholesome, tender
sentiment gruppin' at the strings o' oor cauld hearts, an' playing
strange music thereon; it straightens oor backs, an' gies us a
grander sympathy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ceased his flow of eloquence, and assumed a listening
attitude of intense eagerness. Faintly over the plains had come the
sound of a voice raised in cheerful song.</p>

<p>"Our visitor seems in a happy mood," said Bob, turning to
look.</p>

<p>Mackay grunted, Jack laughed outright, for distinctly through
the still air came the staccato refrain&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"A&mdash;bright&mdash;wee&mdash;muskittie&mdash;sat&mdash;on&mdash;a&mdash;tree."</p>

<p>The horseman was coming forward at an easy trot, jerking out the
plaintive strains of Mackay's pet ditty to the novel time of his
steed's clattering hoof-beats. As yet he was too far distant to be
plainly distinguishable, but the song was enough for Mackay.</p>

<p>"It's that confounded Shadow wha's murderin' that bonnie verse,"
said he; "but how in the name o' goodness can he be back already?
An' he's got a horse, too. A good hundred and fifty miles in three
days. Well, well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this stage, Nuggety Dick, Emu Bill, Dead Broke Dan, and Never
Never Dave made their hasty appearance, all in a state of extreme
excitement.</p>

<p>"I do believe it's the Shadow!" cried Nuggety.</p>

<p>"It's the Shad, right enough," grinned Jack; "don't you hear
him?"</p>

<p class="poem">"A bright wee muskittie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confound that pestilential muskittie!" roared Mackay, in high
dudgeon, amid the laughter of his companions. "My poetic
inspiration will be fair destroyed after hearin' my gem o' beauty
abused in such a manner."</p>

<p>But his wrath simmered down speedily as the redoubtable Shadow
rode up, travel-stained and weary, his sole upper vestment still
further torn and bedraggled, so that it clung to him only in shreds
and patches.</p>

<p>"I reckon I has had a daisy time," he said lightly, slipping
from the saddle. But the effort of his long journey had told on his
numbed limbs, and he staggered and would have fallen had not
Mackay's ready grip supported him.</p>

<p>"Come and have something to eat, you young rascal," said the
aggrieved composer. "You can tell us your news afterwards."</p>

<p>Jack even now had tea ready for the wayfarer, but the wiry youth
refused to be pampered.</p>

<p>"Well, boss," said he, "I'm only a bit stiff, that's all.
Everything's all right. I got in ahead o' Macguire by an hour, an'
fixed up with the Warden like a streak. I has had a great
time&mdash;&mdash;" And he would have begun a narration of his
experiences right then, had not Jack insisted on his having his tea
while it was warm.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to express the satisfaction that was felt
over the Shadow's successful journey, and when the lad had finished
his meal, and told of his numerous adventures on the route and in
the township, not one among them but felt that the young bushman
had proved his worth in no uncertain degree. But it was Mackay's
hearty "Well done, my laddie," that seemed to give him greatest
pleasure, and he cast about him for some means of showing his
gladness.</p>

<p>"I was practisin' your song as I came along," he announced
brightly. "It's a rattlin' fine song, it is. I like it best where
the muskittie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He opened his mouth for a preparatory howl, then, noting the
stern glance cast at him by the man he desired to propitiate, he
subsided in dismay.</p>

<p>"Ye dinna need to intensify your original offence, young man,"
quoth the aggrieved one, solemnly. "I heard ye slaughterin' that
puir wee muskittie about a mile off. There's an auld and true
proverb which says: 'Fools rush in whaur angels fear to pit doon
their feet.' Are ye no aware that that song is set for an angelic
tenor voice like mine, an' no at a' suited for that bark o' yours,
which is like the laboured croak o' a burst bassoon? Never mind,"
he continued magnanimously, "I'll forgie ye, an' I'll mak' ye up a
touching wee song for yersel' some o' these days."</p>

<p>The culprit shuddered at the terrible threat, then hastily
departed with Bob and Jack to talk of subjects more pleasing to
their common fancy.</p>

<p>All this time Macguire's motley crew had been eyeing the group
from the vantage-point of one of their shafts, and that their
feelings were anything but pleasurable was very plainly evident.
They could not understand the early return of the messenger, but
they guessed correctly enough that he must in some way have baulked
their chief's plans, and their disappointment was keen.</p>

<p>Events in the history of Golden Flat happened quickly now. Early
next morning, Jackson, of the Exchange Hotel, weighed in with
several horses and a buggy. He was accompanied by three well-known
prospectors, whom Mackay and his companions welcomed heartily.</p>

<p>"We need a few decent miners here badly," said he to them. "Just
peg out at the end o' the lead; your chances are pretty good there
yet." To Jackson he whispered a word of advice. "I've an idea,"
said he, mysteriously, "that the ground next the Golden Promise
will be abandoned in a day or so. I should like to do ye a good
turn, if only because o' your kindness to the Shadow, so I'm givin'
ye the hint."</p>

<p>A suggestion on such an important matter connected with a new
field was as good as a law unto Jackson.</p>

<p>"I'll wait about then, Mac," said he, "and if I can do anything
in your interest afterwards, you can bet your shirt it shall be
done."</p>

<p>Another day brought a fresh number of excited gold-seekers to
the Flat, and then they came so regularly that a plainly marked
track quickly connected the camp with Kalgoorlie. Before the week
was out, the population of Golden Flat had increased to a hundred,
and still gaunt, bearded miners came trooping in, and spread
themselves promiscuously throughout the surrounding country in the
hope of being able to catch on to the invisible channel. Some
arrived on foot, many having merely the uppers of their boots left
to them, on reaching their destination; and to see these men
marching stubbornly onward over the burning desert, carrying their
entire paraphernalia on their backs, and their eyes agleam with
hungry desire, affected Bob strangely. His extremely sensitive
nature quailed at the thought of such indomitable energy being
rewarded only by bitter disappointment, for he knew well that only
a small proportion of their number could hope to benefit. Buggies,
bicycles, and horses all rolled up; and then came a great heavy
waggon, drawn by a tugging, straining camel team. It stopped
opposite the Golden Promise mine, and one of the twain who
accompanied it, a lean and lanky corrugated-faced individual,
stepped forward and interviewed Mackay.</p>

<p>"Any use stickin' up a battery here, mate?"</p>

<p>"Well, I calculate between us we can give you nearly a thousand
tons o' wash, but I couldn't promise what more."</p>

<p>"That's good enough for us," responded the sprightly battery
owner, and he turned to his awaiting companion. "Up she goes, Jim,"
said he.</p>

<p>They sought a suitable site some little way off, where the
chances of striking water at no great depth promised favourably,
and before the day was done Golden Flat battery was almost ready to
begin work.</p>

<p>"They'll get a bit o' a shock when they tackle the miradgy
clayey stuff," Mackay murmured, as he watched the enterprising
builders, "but I don't suppose they'd believe me if I told them
about it. Anyhow, we can realize now on what we've got on the
surface. For the rest, we must trust to Bob's discovery."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine the metamorphosis the quiet
Flat underwent in that short week. Tents scattered everywhere, and
the air was never free from the shattering roar of exploding
gelignite, which indicated how earnestly the new-comers were
endeavouring to bottom on their claims.</p>

<p>During this strenuous period in the life of the Flat, work at
the Golden Promise mine proceeded surely and steadily, and the
wash-dirt was accumulating in great piles at the shaft head. In
view of the watchful eyes of a section of the community given to
legitimate claim jumping, the Shadow had gone back to his own
workings, where, by the occasional assistance of Emu Bill, he
succeeded in excavating his ground to excellent purpose. Bob now
took his old place in the subterranean chamber of the mine, though
Mackay was loth indeed to permit it.</p>

<p>"I would rather see ye riggin' up the process on a big scale,"
he said. "Still, it's maybe just as well to keep it quiet for a
bit, until we see what happens when the loafing gang next us
bottoms on the mirage."</p>

<p>Bob thought so too. His sympathies were all indeed with the
hard-working miners who were battling away so persistently at the
remote ends of the Flat; but to confer a benefit on the men who
would so meanly have stolen his own and companions' holdings! It
was scarcely natural that he should view such an idea with any
favour, especially when there were many honest toilers around who
might have a chance to secure a portion of the ground held by the
gang should they decide to abandon it, for their pegs confined a
nine-man allotment, an area which, with the claims of their own
party, practically covered the known auriferous ground of the
Flat.</p>

<p>"If the beggars once bottomed on that deceptive compound," said
he, grimly, to himself, "I don't think they would wait much longer.
The gold that vanisheth would be too much for them."</p>

<p>But Macguire's satellites in no way hurried the sinking of their
many shafts, indeed, it soon became apparent that they were rather
retarding operations for a purpose. Jack was one of the first to
notice this odd dilatoriness.</p>

<p>"They've had three misfires in the shaft next to us to-day,"
said he, as Mackay and Bob emerged from their labours one evening.
Jack had been on windlass duty, and so from his high post could not
fail to observe the progress made during the day on the mines in
his near vicinity.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they are up to?" remarked Bob, thoughtfully.
"They ought to have bottomed some days ago, judging by the level
and trend of the drift in the Golden Promise."</p>

<p>But their scheme was simple enough, as it turned out. Jackson
unconsciously explained it away that same night while he was
talking to Bob by the camp-fire.</p>

<p>"Your neighbours have offered to sell me one of their claims for
&pound;1000," said he. "They haven't struck the wash yet, but they
say, judgin' from your ore on the surface, theirs must be as good,
if not better, when they hit it."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's their idea, is it?" commented Mackay, who had been
listening. "I'm no' denyin' that it's a good plan in some cases for
both sides, an' I believe they are perfectly honest accordin' to
their calculations, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you think is the matter?" asked Jackson. "Haven't
they a good chance of striking the channel?"</p>

<p>Mackay laughed. "They'll hit the channel plumb enough," said he;
then he hesitated. "You haven't been down our shaft yet?" he added.
"But I'll take you below in the morning, and show ye something
that'll surprise you. You're no' half a bad sort, Jackson, and you
and me have worked together before, otherwise I wouldna say a
single word aboot the concern, though I admit freely I have no
goodwill towards the meeserable crowd next to us."</p>

<p>The tactics of the objectionable party were, after all, but the
tactics of the non-mining element on all goldfields, who invariably
prefer to sell a chance rather than take even remote risk of
disaster. The true gold-miner is built differently; to him his
chance is everything, the whole glamour of his life lies in its
tantalizing uncertainty, and poor and needy though he may be, he
must pursue Nature's elusive treasure to the end, be it bitter or
sweet.</p>

<p>A fortnight had elapsed since the Shadow's return, and Golden
Flat thrived and grew apace. The crashing rattle of the ever-active
stamping-battery made day and night alike hideous. A saw-mill, too,
had appeared on the scene, and its characteristic din was added to
the prevailing discords. Deep wells had been sunk, tapping only
strongly brackish water, but a condensing plant was almost
immediately established to purify this sufficiently for culinary
purposes, and the far-seeing proprietor was reaping a goodly
harvest from the sale of the warm fluid, sparingly dispensed at a
shilling a gallon.</p>

<p>From the Golden Promise mine, nearly two hundred tons of the
valuable wash had been raised to the surface and this was being
regularly conveyed to the greedy battery, which consumed it at the
rate of twenty tons a day, and rendered the resultant bullion to
the happy owners of the mine. But the partners of the Golden
Promise knew well that their claim would yield little more of the
same material; another fifty tons at the utmost was Mackay's
computation, and then&mdash;then the deceptive under-stratum would
have to be considered. Meanwhile, the news of the Golden Promise's
richness spread like wildfire throughout the Flat; the battery
returns on the first day of treatment gave the exceptionally high
result of one hundred and twenty ounces of gold from the twenty
tons of ore crushed.</p>

<p>"That means, wi' gold at &pound;4 an ounce, &pound;480 between
the three o' us, my lads," said Mackay, when he heard the news.
"An' we can calculate on twelve times that amount afore we're on to
the mirage stuff."</p>

<p>"How does that compare with our home earnings, Jack?" laughed
Bob.</p>

<p>"I think the steam yacht is coming a bit nearer," admitted that
youth, lightly. "But," and his voice grew sorrowful, "isn't it a
pity that we haven't two or three thousand tons&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, now, young 'un," Mackay interrupted sternly, "you must
never give way to useless reflections. What is, is, and let us be
thankful. The future is before ye, my lad, look to it for your
Eldorado."</p>

<p>"After all," reasoned Bob, "we are never really contented. Our
ideas of happiness seem to change so much; we are always seeking
what we imagine to be a definite object, and when we reach it,
another and apparently far greater incentive beckons us on&mdash;on
to what?"</p>

<p>"There you go," grumbled Jack, "preaching a first-class sermon
when we ought to be slogging away down in the shaft."</p>

<p>Bob started to his feet at once. "I clean forgot, Jack," said
he; "your mention of the steam yacht which we used to talk about in
the old days set me thinking."</p>

<p>They disappeared together, engaged in earnest conversation. A
rough ladder-way had been fixed in the shaft by this time, so that
it was not necessary for the windlass to be called into requisition
every time an ascent or descent was made. Mackay, who had just been
returning from his labours below when he received the information
about the battery results, sat musing on the edge of his bunk for
some minutes after the boys had departed. Bob's words had aroused
in him a strange feeling of restlessness and discontent, which, try
as he might, he could not shake off.</p>

<p>"It's the call of the Never Never gripping me again," he
muttered hoarsely. "I wonder what great secret that terrible
country holds as a recompense for all the lives it has taken. Is it
only a shadow that attracts, after all?"</p>

<p>He arose wearily, and went back to the shaft he had so recently
vacated, and, notwithstanding the protests of his young associates,
took up his pick and worked with fierce energy.</p>

<p>"It's a wee bit o' mental depression that's dropped on me
sudden-like," explained he; "an' there's nothing like hard graft
for bringing the balance true quickly."</p>

<p>The time passed, and still he smote away with untiring
persistency. Then Jack seized the pick from his hand.</p>

<p>"It's time to go aloft and have supper," said he, "then I want
to hear you play the flute for a bit. I'm just dying to hear some
decent music."</p>

<p>Mackay smiled kindly at the boy. "You've hit me on my tender
spot," he made reply. "Do you think you could appreciate 'The
Muskittie's Lament' the nicht?"</p>

<p>"Even 'The Muskittie's Lament,'" Jack added valorously.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch8"></a>Chapter 8. Macguire's Threat</h2>

<p>It was about this time that Macguire thought it necessary to
return to the scene of his discomfiture, and view for himself the
progress made by his worthy confr&egrave;res. His arrangement with
his men was the not uncommon one of "grubstaking" for half the
profits; that is, he kept them in food, and supplied them with all
necessary tools in return for a half interest in the wealth of the
mines so worked. It is a sufficiently equitable understanding when
made between an honestly intentioned capitalist and a
down-on-his-luck miner over the development of a wholly
questionable prospect; but it is rarely successful on a proved
mineral area, and when it is attempted in such a case, it
invariably leaks out that those so employed are strongly in the
clutches of the "grubstaker," who is usually the local publican.
There was a curious rude kind of honour among these men. They
respected their chief principally because of his great bodily
strength, and if there was an element of fear mixed with this
respect, who could blame them? But they admired his sharpness, too;
few men could get the better of Macguire; and so these wretched
creatures chuckled at the fact that their patron was a power in the
land, and could do much to influence their several careers when he
wished. Nevertheless, their leanings towards hard manual labour
were not of the strongest; their usual routine in the past had been
"jumping" mines when the bulk of the work thereon had been done,
but on this occasion their amiable intentions in that direction had
received a rude check, and base toil must now be their portion,
unless some purchaser for their claims could be found. So it
happened that their excavations progressed with exceeding slowness,
and Macguire, growing wroth at their failure to strike the wash in
a reasonable time, and having now recovered his wonted energy,
determined to proceed again to the Flat and direct operations in
person. He arrived at a very early hour in the morning, riding
Furious. Few of the camp were about, but the ubiquitous Shadow was
of course in evidence, seated at his solitary breakfast outside his
tent door.</p>

<p>"Blow me," murmured that gentle youth, "if it ain't
Macguire."</p>

<p>The recognition was mutual.</p>

<p>"So you got back, you young ruffian?" came the new-comer's
greeting, and the Shadow's ire was aroused at once.</p>

<p>"I hope the Warden didn't say nothin' unkind to you when you
called on him that morning," said he, with exaggerated solicitude.
"I should just hate to think yer feelin's had been hurt."</p>

<p>The horseman's eyes blazed angrily; then, all of a sudden, he
threw himself from the saddle and made a rush at his enemy, who
agilely dodged at the last moment, with the result that Macguire's
great bulk hurled itself against the tent.</p>

<p>"I reckon that's as good as house-breakin', it is," protested
the Shadow, in injured tones.</p>

<p>With rage in his heart, Macguire made another wild dash at the
mocking youngster, who took refuge behind the windlass on his
shaft, and eyed his panting aggressor cheerfully. In this position
of antagonism, Emu Bill, who had been awakened from his slumbers by
the strange sounds without, found them. He took in the scene at a
glance, but his set bronzed face did not move a muscle.</p>

<p>"I reckon you has just about met your match this time,
Macguire," said he, calmly. "A boy is about your size every time,
he is."</p>

<p>Without a word Macguire got back on his horse. "I'll settle you
too," he hissed. "You won't know what's struck you when I'm done
with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bit o' rock, most likely, if you are about," retorted Emu
Bill, with grave contempt.</p>

<p>Macguire galloped off.</p>

<p>"Despite his faults, the man's a born hustler," Mackay remarked
that same day to his two companions.</p>

<p>They were engaged on the surface, levelling off their ore dump
from the shaft mouth, and could scarcely fail to note the unwonted
activity shown on the adjoining claim.</p>

<p>"He certainly does make them shift around," agreed Bob. "I
suppose long experience has taught him how to handle his type of
followers."</p>

<p>Very shortly afterwards it became evident that some unusual
excitement prevailed at Number 2 shaft, which adjoined the Golden
Promise towards the south. The official numbers of the various
claims ran consecutively north and south of the Golden Promise,
which was known as the Discovery shaft, though, indeed, Nuggety
Dick's excavation, which was now called Number 4 above Discovery,
should have claimed that honour.</p>

<p>This Number 2 was the main hope of Macguire's party, for by it
alone could they hope to trace the direction of the golden leader.
Now it seemed as if they had at last broken through to the golden
stratum, men rushed hither and thither carrying gold-pans and
dollying-hammers, some clustered around the shaft mouth, then
Macguire himself was seen to descend the workings. A hushed air of
expectation spread over the whole Flat, and for a brief space all
work was suspended. A few minutes passed in anxious silence, then a
bellow of joy from Macguire reached the surface; at once one of his
waiting aides-de-camp extracted a red flag of huge proportions from
a convenient niche near the windlass, where it had been lying in
readiness, and its dropping folds soon flaunted in the sunshine,
proclaiming to all whom it might concern that Number 2 had bottomed
on gold. Almost immediately Macguire ascended to the surface,
carrying a large-sized specimen in his hand, the sight of which
caused Jack to be convulsed with inward laughter, for its greyish
colour proclaimed it at once to be of the same deceptive material
which had first been discovered in Emu Bill's claim.</p>

<p>"I'm half inclined to be sorry for the man," spoke Mackay, with
some feeling.</p>

<p>Bob had been experiencing a pang or two himself. "It does seem
hard lines," he said.</p>

<p>Yet even while they were considering on a magnanimous course of
action, the object of their sympathy turned his leering eyes upon
them.</p>

<p>"I'll best ye yet!" he cried triumphantly, holding his treasure
at arm's length that all might look. "I've got as much of this
stuff as'll keep the battery going for six months. I'll see that
Roxton closes down on your wash to-night, I will. I'll starve you
out o' the Flat like rats, quick an' lively too."</p>

<p>Now Roxton, the battery owner, was like many other humbler men,
heavily in debt to the publican, who along with his other duties
acted the part of money-lender in the township. It was quite
possible therefore that Macguire could make good his threat about
the closing down of the battery, though had he known it, that would
at this time scarcely have affected the partners of the Golden
Promise to any extent, the bulk of their visible wash having been
already treated. Still, the brutal malignancy of the man's
intentions was unmistakable, and a shudder of disgust seized Bob,
nipping effectually the finer sentiments he had harboured but a
moment before. Mackay eyed the jeering man with a look in which a
just anger and a wholesome contempt were struggling for
mastery.</p>

<p>"You're nothing but a sneaking thief, Macguire," he said, with
forced calmness. "An' for twa pins I'd come doon an' burst in a few
mair o' your ribs. I'll certainly hae to settle you when I am
forced to tackle you again. But what are ye makin' a' the fuss
aboot, anyhow? You're clutching to a bit o' clay as if it were a
golden nugget. Your battery wouldna thrive vera weel on that sort
o' stuff, I'm thinkin'."</p>

<p>Macguire was on the point of launching out into further
invective, when his eye happened to glance at his treasure. He
hesitated, stammered, and his rotund face grew livid.</p>

<p>"Put the water you have ready on your heid instead o' into the
gold-pan," advised Mackay, kindly, "it'll maybe keep ye from
gettin' apoplexy."</p>

<p>An inarticulate yell of mingled dismay and fury broke from the
lips of the too-previous exulter. Hurling the stone from him, he
turned and rushed blindly into his tent. Eagerly his followers
picked up the rejected specimen; it was dull and dead clay, showing
no trace of the precious metal. Muttering maledictions, they fled
after their leader.</p>

<p>It quickly became whispered about that all was not as had been
hoped at Number 2 shaft, and despite the reticence of those
principally concerned, strange rumours were soon current regarding
the extraordinary phantom gold formation which had just been
struck. Then Macguire raved more wildly than ever, for his chances
of disposing of the mine on a sight valuation to some innocent
buyer were now hopelessly ruined. He railed savagely against
Nature, and all mankind in general; even his own alike suffering
and yet sympathetic followers were not spared the flood of his
abuse. A trial parcel of the ore was sent to the battery in the
hope that whatever free gold contained in the substance might be
saved by the mercury, but only further disappointment resulted. Its
cohesive nature was such that the stamps merely flattened it like
putty, and the whole went over the sluice-box in a dense mass of
coagulated slimes, leaving not a trace of gold behind in the
riffles.</p>

<p>When Mackay heard this he was filled with misgivings; he had
never doubted the efficacy of the stamps as a crushing agency, and
he feared for the working of Bob's process on a large scale when
hand manipulation would</p>

<p>"Crushing is unnecessary with the process," said he. "The ore
will dissolve in the vat; indeed, it would reduce itself to slime
in ordinary water if puddled occasionally, or it would disintegrate
very rapidly on exposure to the sun, though that plan would be
rather risky, owing to the excessive oxidization which might take
place. But in every case the slimes would remain unaffected by
battery treatment, and for this one reason which was the basis of
all my experiments&mdash;the clayey material is a chemical
compound, and not a mechanical mixture like ordinary alluvial wash,
consequently it will only answer to chemical treatment."</p>

<p>"But," interjected Jack, "there is most likely free gold in the
stuff as well as the&mdash;the other kind."</p>

<p>"Probably enough, but, as you see, even that cannot be saved by
ordinary methods; the soapy nature of the composition, I imagine,
is the cause. Oily globules will form around the gold particles and
insulate them, so that the mercury on the plates never really gets
a chance to exert its power."</p>

<p>Apparently Bob's studies had been complete and exhaustive; his
knowledge of his subject impressed Mackay deeply.</p>

<p>"I can follow your reasoning there, Bob," said he, "for the
overflow even of the small vat in the tent was more like
engine-grease than anything else, an' I can testify that the
residue I washed in the pan was a pure and free sand."</p>

<p>The Shadow here broke in on their conversation; he had been away
at the other end of the Flat on a tour of investigation, for it was
known that several shafts were nearing the dreaded bottom.</p>

<p>"The whole circus is goin' to break up," he announced
sorrowfully. "There's nothin' but Emu Bill's miradgy stuff down
there, an' the miners are thinkin' o' giving it best."</p>

<p>The Shadow was not aware that Bob's experiment had proved
successful; Emu Bill alone of the original group had been informed,
and he certainly had not spoken of it.</p>

<p>"I'll go down and advise them to hang on for a bit," said
Mackay, after some deliberation. "An' Bob, you can tell the Shadow
anything you like, provided he promises to keep his mouth
shut."</p>

<p>"Say boss, does I deserve that?" complained the injured youth,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>Jack hastened to assuage his grief. "No one knows yet," said he,
"but Emu Bill and ourselves; we didn't want Macguire's crowd to
hear that Bob could tackle the mirage."</p>

<p>"An' did ye think that I would give it away?" murmured the
Shadow, with emotion, and for a long time he refused to be
comforted.</p>

<p>That day six shafts penetrated into the refractory formation,
and loud were the lamentations that arose throughout the camp.
Surely never was a more scurvy trick played by Dame Fortune upon
her toiling votaries. Macguire laughed heartily at the misfortunes
of his neighbours; it was as balm to his soul that others should
experience the pangs of disappointment as he did, and in the
evening he gave the lead to the others by dismantling his
windlasses and preparing for departure, having done not a stroke of
work on his claims since the eventful day of his own bitter
chagrin. On the following morning he and his associates took their
leave of the Flat, and almost as soon as they were out of sight,
the abandoned claims were being taken up afresh by a number of
hard-working miners, who had before been sinking vain shafts well
without the auriferous belt. Jackson had quietly annexed Number 2
shaft, though he was somewhat dubious about it proving of any
service to him, and fully a dozen honest toilers swarmed over the
remainder of the ground vacated. There was no need to keep the
secret longer, and before noon all the Flat had been made aware of
Bob's discovery, and excitement was again raised to fever heat. A
deputation from among the miners was formed at once to make inquiry
into the matter, for news of a scheme of such far-reaching
importance could not be received lightly.</p>

<p>They approached the Golden Promise mine shortly after midday,
followed <i>en masse</i> by the entire population of the camp.</p>

<p>"We wants to see the inventor o' the process," said the
spokesman, addressing Mackay, who was at the windlass, "we wants to
ask him if it are a fact that he can save the gold in this stuff."
He displayed a piece of the refractory ore in his hand.</p>

<p>Mackay gazed at the speaker kindly, then at the sea of upturned
faces in the background.</p>

<p>"I reckon you've come to the right street for your information,
boys," he replied, and he shouted down to his companion in the
depths below: "Bob, there's a few gentlemen wi' some interest in
the welfare o' Golden Flat wanting to speak to you."</p>

<p>A minute later and Bob arrived on the surface, and at his
appearance a faint cheer swept over the awaiting crowd. The young
man started in amazement; he could not understand this
demonstration, but he quickly recovered himself, and then the
speaker of the deputation began his oration afresh, ending with the
earnest words: "We are miners every one o' us, with not much to
spare in the way o' cash; but if you can help us, and ain't
unwilling to help us, you may ask what you like from the returns o'
the mines, an' we won't refuse."</p>

<p>Bob was touched, and for the first time a surging feeling of his
power came over him, yet when he spoke his voice was calm and even.
Briefly he recounted his experiments with the tantalizing material,
concluding with the results of the last and final test; then,
suddenly, he entered upon a keen technical description of the ore
and its peculiarities, dealing with its scientific aspect at
critical length. Jack nudged Mackay, who coughed loudly, and Bob,
interrupted, lost the theme of his argument, and incidentally
remembered that he was not addressing a class of trained
mineralogists. He hesitated, and turned to Mackay.</p>

<p>"You can make them understand better," he said.</p>

<p>"I can that," responded that individual, promptly; and he
disappeared into the tent, issuing forth immediately with the
gold-pan, which still contained the results of the important
experiment. He thrust the pan with its gleaming treasure into the
hands of one of the deputation. "I saw that go through mysel',"
said he. "There's no much o' a phantom aboot that, is there?"</p>

<p>The crowd behind caught a glitter of the gold as the pan was
passed round, and now there was no mistake about the energy of
their cheer&mdash;a hundred throats echoed it forth. When it had
subsided, Mackay again made felicitous utterance.</p>

<p>"We'll have a ten-ton vat rigged up within a couple o' days," he
announced, in stentorian tones. "An' Bob, here, wishes me to say
that the charges for treatment will no' be in any way
extravagant."</p>

<p>A yell of approval rewarded his effort, yet still the assembly
showed no signs of departing.</p>

<p>"I think you should sing the 'Muskittie' to them," suggested
Jack, "then you'd see them run."</p>

<p>He had to run himself after that, and when he returned, the
conclusion of the meeting was near. The leader of the deputation
was making strenuous endeavour to justify his position. He
harangued the congregated miners with forceful eloquence, pointing
out what an inestimable service the young inventor would confer
upon the country and themselves.</p>

<p>"And now, boys," he concluded, "let her go again. Three cheers
for the discoverer of the process. Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" And the
Flat thundered with their hearty applause.</p>

<p>When they had gone, Mackay heaved a hearty sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"You're far too open-hearted for this pairt o' the world, Bob,"
he said dryly. "If there had been one among that crowd wha kent
anything aboot chemistry, he would have got as big a knowledge o'
your process as you have yourself."</p>

<p>Bob flushed. "I forgot," said he, "that there was any reason for
keeping it secret."</p>

<p>The elder man laughed grimly. "My laddie," he began, with grave
earnestness, "are ye no' aware that there should be a fortune in
this for you. There may be tens o' thousands o' tons o' the stuff
in this Flat, and allowin' ye made a charge of, say, &pound;2 a
ton&mdash;which is little more than battery price&mdash;don't you
see what a tremendous profit would be made? You canna patent a
discovery, Bob; and your only safety is in keeping it secret. The
great danger lies in the simplicity o' the process. We must be vera
careful, my lad, vera careful indeed."</p>

<p>"But did I really tell them everything?" said Bob, abashed; for
in truth he had forgotten the presence of his audience, so wrapped
up had he been in the interest of his subject.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you telt them richt enough; but you clothed your
observations in such elegant scientific language that I'm sure not
a man among them kent what ye were talkin' aboot."</p>

<p>"You did give them a pretty bad time," grinned Jack. "It was a
treat to see them wrestling with hydrocarbonaceous compounds, and
electrolytical principles; but didn't they howl when they saw the
gold!"</p>

<p>"I reckon that talks every time," said Mackay.</p>

<p>No time was now lost in erecting the vat and other appliances
necessary for the bulk treatment of the strange deposit. Wood was
obtained from the saw mill, and Mackay, assisted by Jack and the
Shadow, started to build the giant trough for the retention of the
ore. Only half-sawn, rounded timber was used, for that alone could
support the strain that must finally be put upon the structure; a
movable bottom was also fixed to allow of the ultimate residue
being drawn off easily, and the whole was mounted on a stout
standard of logs raised about five feet from the ground.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, a constant stream of visitors came to view
the peculiar erection before it was nearly half completed; but when
Bob's important chemical and electrical arrangements were ready to
be fitted, Mackay, much to the disgust of the beholders, screened
the entire plant from their gaze by building a tall canvas wall
around it. By the end of the week everything was in readiness for
the trial, which was given out to take place in the evening, and a
vast assembly gathered to witness the inauguration of what was now
known as the "Hope of Golden Flat." So speedily had the news
travelled concerning it, and so vastly interested had even the
outside world become in the problematical future of the Flat's odd
formation, that by Saturday morning quite a number of men from
Kalgoorlie and far outlying townships made their appearance, and a
steady stream of buggies and horsemen poured in along the track all
day. Indeed, it seemed as if a fresh rush had set in, so keen was
the excitement.</p>

<p>But Mackay was ill at ease. Among the throng of new-comers he
had recognized several of the cleverest mining engineers in the
State, and none of them had reputations for being
over-scrupulous.</p>

<p>"There'll be a careful eye kept on us to-night, Bob," said he.
"An' I'm just a wee bit dubious o' the intentions o' some o' our
visitors."</p>

<p>Bob looked thoughtful. "I'll fix up a dummy battery and an extra
generator for their special benefit," he suggested.</p>

<p>"A good idea, my lad, and I'll see that Emu Bill and the boys
are close handy in case o' accident. Jack can stand by an' help
you. I'll attend to the dumping o' the ore, and the overflow
arrangements, an' flatten out any man wha's troubled wi' an excess
o' inquisitiveness."</p>

<p>"An' I," spoke the Shadow, "I reckons I'll keep my blinkers open
for any suspicious-lookin' cusses, an'&mdash;&mdash; Howlin'
centipedes! there's one now! Blow me if it ain't that pestiferous
son o' a gun back again."</p>

<p>They looked and saw Macguire in close conversation with a short,
nattily dressed man of about middle age. Then the crowd closed up
again, and hid the plotters&mdash;for such they undoubtedly
were&mdash;from view.</p>

<p>The trial had been arranged to take place at seven o'clock in
the evening, chiefly because the great heat of the sun at an
earlier period would have been most trying for the spectators and
experimentalists alike, but Mackay had also the idea that at such a
time the working arrangements would be less visible to the
onlookers, and though he did not then think that any danger was
likely to arise in this respect, he now congratulated himself on
his cautionary scruples. Indeed, if the three partners could have
foreseen that so many outsiders were to be present, no public
exhibition of the process would have been promised. But it was too
late now to alter their plans; the test must go on, come what may;
and though Bob was confident of success, his mind was somewhat
troubled by the appearance on the scene of so many strangers, and
the arrival of Macguire added much to his apprehensions. An hour
before the stated time all was in readiness for the ordeal. The gas
generators and batteries were placed behind the vat and loosely
covered by some old ore-bags, then the enclosing canvas screen was
pulled away. A number of oil lamps hung around gave ample light,
while at the same time their reflectors were so arranged as to cast
a deep shadow over the lowly placed chemical plant. Every safeguard
against prying eyes had been employed before the curtain was taken
down, and now the interested spectators gazed curiously on the huge
wooden structure which revealed itself to them. Ten tons of the ore
to be treated rested on a platform built at the top of the vat; it
was all neatly arranged in bags, each of ten claims having provided
a ton, while an extra half-dozen tons taken from the Golden Promise
lay conveniently near at hand.</p>

<p>Bob stepped with apparent carelessness to the concealed
batteries and made the connections secure; Mackay mounted the
platform to tip in the ore, and Jack casually stood guard in front
of the hidden plant. Then Macguire's harsh voice cackled out in
protest&mdash;</p>

<p>"We want to see the inside o' the concern before you start; you
may have salted it for all we knows."</p>

<p>Bob's lips compressed tightly at the words. "I am not a
professional conjurer," he said with dignity, "and I have nothing
to gain one way or another from any of you. If you represent the
feelings of the miners here, I shall go no further."</p>

<p>A cry of dissent at once arose, and Macguire's safety seemed for
the moment imperilled; but in the midst of the uproar, Bob calmly
unscrewed the bottom from the vat and pulled it forth for
inspection, and he noted that those who came forward at his request
were without exception the men whose good intentions Mackay had so
much doubted. The interruption did not delay matters for more than
a minute or so, then Mackay began to load the vat, and in a short
space the onlookers were listening to its turbulent outbursts in
amazed silence. At this stage, Macguire, accompanied by the man he
had been seen with earlier in the evening, pushed his way forward
until he was almost touching the foaming caldron. But they did not
escape the lynx eyes of Emu Bill and the Shadow, whose stern grips
were on their shoulders at once.</p>

<p>"Let them stay, Bill, if they want," said Bob, quietly.</p>

<p>"I should just reckon we would, young feller," rasped Macguire,
though even as he spoke his companion was whisked abruptly to the
rear by the inflexible Shadow.</p>

<p>Bob smiled, and nodded to Mackay, who at once opened the
overflow tap, and a spouting rush of oily slimes descended on the
bully's head, saturating him in an odoriferous flood. The
bystanders roared with glee, and made way hurriedly to allow the
dripping man an open passage for his now frenzied retreat. The
suddenness of the deluge had utterly taken away his power of
speech, and the smarting pain of the saline fluid in his eyes made
him howl like a dingo. However, he recovered himself somewhat when
he got clear of the jeering crowd. "I'll pay ye back for this!" he
snarled; "I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;" Then his more fortunate
companion took him by the arm and led him away.</p>

<p>The drastic lesson had considerable effect on several other
over-inquisitive individuals, and their haste to retire whenever
they saw Mackay's hand reach towards the tap was ludicrous in its
earnestness.</p>

<p>Again and again the overflow belched out, until it seemed as if
nothing solid could have remained. And all this time the assembled
miners looked on in silent wonder. At last Bob intimated that the
operation was completed.</p>

<p>"The vat was built to hold ten tons," he said, "but it could
treat fifty tons in a day easily enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?" interrupted a mining engineer close
at hand.</p>

<p>"Why, all you have to do is to keep filling up the vat as the
overflow exhausts it. The gold will always be found at the
bottom."</p>

<p>Mackay and Jack now busied themselves unscrewing the movable
bottom, and the crowd surged round in breathless expectation.
Quickly the screws relaxed, a stream of yellow ooze gurgled out,
but the only solid matter retained was that which lay encompassed
within the flanged edges of the detached wood. It was not inspiring
to look upon, merely a layer about two inches deep of a dull
gravelly sediment.</p>

<p>Then Bob spoke again. "If the process were kept going long
enough," said he, "there would be scarcely any residue other than
the gold itself."</p>

<p>"An' does ye think thar's any gold there, mate?" asked a
stalwart miner, anxiously.</p>

<p>Bob nodded with easy confidence, "You'll very soon see," he
replied.</p>

<p>Mackay was already engaged in the work of demonstration. Raising
the shallow receptacle until it lay at a easy incline, he next
gently tilted the contents of a kerosene tin full of water over the
slope, and behold the muddy casing dissolved away, revealing a rich
spangling yellow underneath. A roar of fierce joy burst from nigh
on two hundred throats, and for about a minute pandemonium reigned.
Hats were tossed into the air, and huzzahs long and loud echoed
over the plains. The success of the process had been established
beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>One of the first to congratulate the young discoverer was
Nuggety Dick, but Never Never Dave and old Dead Broke were at his
heels.</p>

<p>"You've saved the Flat, Bob!" cried Nuggety.</p>

<p>"An' you've saved us too," murmured Dead Broke, with
emotion.</p>

<p>"What I want to know, young man, is by what means do you bring
about the expulsion of the oily matter in the compound?"</p>

<p>The voice was patronizing in the extreme: the speaker was the
erstwhile associate of Macguire.</p>

<p>Then Mackay's pent-up rage broke forth. "An' are ye sure that is
all ye would like to know?" he stormed. "You mean, snivelling
sneak, do ye think I don't know who ye are an' what ye're here for?
Get out o' my sight, afore I do you damage."</p>

<p>To Bob's surprise, the man fled at once. Emu Bill laughed.</p>

<p>"I'd have liked a word with the skunk myself," said he. "He's
one of the measliest rats in the West, he is."</p>

<p>Then Jack added his testimony. "He's been dodging around trying
to get a look at the battery all evening."</p>

<p>The sound of a strenuous scuffle from behind the vat at this
moment drew their attention. With a bound Mackay rushed to
investigate, and there he beheld the Shadow engaged in silent
conflict with the man they had just been discussing. The crowd had
by this time drawn away from the scene of operations, and were
talking excitedly among themselves over their now rosy future
prospects.</p>

<p>Mackay snorted savagely. "Let me get a crack at him, Shadow," he
said, hastening to the fray. But the struggling man, already safe
in the Shadow's sinewy grip, on hearing the new-comer's voice, made
a desperate effort to free himself, and literally tore himself from
his enemy's grasp, and sped off into the night.</p>

<p>The Shadow gazed ruefully after the vanishing figure. "It was
your fault," he said reproachfully to Mackay. "When you chased him
away 'bout a minute ago I was watching him, an' saw him do a slide
round by the back, so I just sat tight an' waited for the dodger.
He was pulling the cover from that there fizzing concern when I
gripped him by the neck."</p>

<p>"But who is he, anyhow?" asked Bob, who, with the others, had
come to inquire the cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>"He's a most dangerous man, Bob," answered Mackay, grimly. "His
name is Wynberg, an' he's the chief chemist and assayer o' one o'
the crookest mining companies in Australia, a clever man in his
way, no doubt, but his cleverness seems aye to develop in the wrong
direction, as the shareholders o' the company he represents should
well ken by this time. He came here wi' that thief Macguire on
purpose to steal your brains, Bob&mdash;for nothing else."</p>

<p>"Well, I scarcely think he has succeeded," laughed Bob.</p>

<p>The crowd was by this time beginning to disperse, and a number
of the miners came up to say good night.</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Jack, "we haven't weighed the gold yet!" And
neither they had; so keen had been the excitement at seeing the
welcome metal that no one had given a thought to estimating its
quantity.</p>

<p>"We'll soon make that right," said Mackay, seizing the pair of
gold-scales, that had been lying in readiness beside the generator.
He quickly emptied the gleaming dust on to a sheet of calico, which
Jack hastily drew forward, and commenced weighing it carefully in
ounces.</p>

<p>"I reckon," said one of the men, who had sent a ton for
treatment, "I reckon if it goes an ounce we should be mighty well
pleased."</p>

<p>"In that case there should be ten ounces saved, then," said Bob,
"allowing for no loss."</p>

<p>"There's three times that here," said Mackay, "or my judgment is
very far oot." And, indeed, so it proved. Mackay filled the tiny
scales exactly thirty-one times, and yet there were some grains
over. "Thirty-one ounces," said he, "an' belted out o' the
deceivin' stuff inside an hour." A murmur of astonishment ran
through the group. This result surpassed even their wildest
hopes.</p>

<p>"That means that each man who sent along a ton is entitled to
three odd ounces," reflected Bob. "Better weigh it off and let them
have it now."</p>

<p>The ten men concerned held a hurried consultation, then one of
their number advanced, and laid his hand kindly on Bob's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"There's nary one o' us will take an ounce o' the stuff," said
he. "Keep the gold, my boy; you're heartily welcome to it. It's the
first return o' the discovery, an' it's yours by right. We only
hopes you'll get oceans more o' it afore very long."</p>

<p>A babel of concurring voices answered for his comrades, and
before Bob could reply the men had gone. Mackay gravely handed a
well-filled gold-bag to the hesitating youth.</p>

<p>"They're quite right, Bob," he commented quietly. "The gold is
yours by right&mdash;by right o' discovery. Keep it, my
laddie&mdash;keep it and treasure it, as Jack treasures the first
nugget he found. In after years, if you're spared, ye'll maybe
remember this night as a vera wonderful experience."</p>

<p>Bob was silent; somehow his companion's words affected him
deeply. There was a note of foreboding in them, as if the speaker
saw into the future clearly, and was saddened by what he saw.
Together they joined the camp-fire circle, where the rest of their
acquaintances were gathered; then Mackay appeared to remember
something, and hastened back to the vat, and when Jack and the
Shadow went in search of him, they found him quietly refixing the
canvas wall around the whole structure.</p>

<p>That night Bob and Mackay slept deeply; the strain of the
evening and of the preceding days had told upon them. Jack, on the
other hand, tossed about restlessly; his active brain refused to be
still, and the events of the last crowded epoch in his life flitted
before his unseeing gaze. He awoke from a troubled sleep shortly
after midnight, and a vague uneasiness seemed to take possession of
him. The moon had just risen, and her pale eerie light penetrated
into the tent and illumined it with a ghostly radiance; it shone on
the faces of the two recumbent figures near, and Jack for the
moment became interested in watching the different expressions of
the sleepers. Bob slept deep and peacefully, a restful smile on his
clear-cut features, but Mackay's rugged visage looked grim and
careworn, and ever and anon a faint groan broke from his lips,
while his breath came in quick, laboured gasps. Jack was amazed. To
him the brawny bushman was still somewhat of an enigma, and each
new phase of his startled, even while it interested him. "He'll be
back in the Never Never again," thought he, pityingly. Then all at
once his heart gave a violent bound. A shadow had suddenly fallen
aslant the tent; some moving body had intervened to shut out the
rising rays of the moon. He glanced around with an almost
imperceptible movement through his half-closed eyelids, and there
at the door stood a bulky figure gazing in on them intently. For
fully a minute he stood thus, then he turned silently, and the moon
shone on his face, revealing the hateful features of Macguire; it
shone also on something which glittered brightly in his upraised
hand: it was a revolver.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant Jack became conscious of another
intruder being near; his sensitive ear caught the sound of light
shuffling footsteps in the sand, and a dark form loomed up briefly
by the side of the tent; the image reflected plainly through the
thin calico wall, then quickly disappeared. Immediately afterwards
there came a sharp rasping tear from the near vicinity, followed by
a muttered curse. A cold sweat broke out on the boy's forehead;
some one had cut the canvas screen enclosing the vat and batteries!
At the disturbing sound the watcher at the door started slightly,
then his demoniacal face peered again into the tent, and the
shining barrel of his weapon was levelled straight at Mackay's
heaving chest; but apparently satisfied that the man whom he so
much dreaded was still asleep, he hastened to join his marauding
companion.</p>

<p>Jack's action was prompt and impulsive; he leaped up, seized his
Winchester repeater, which was lying on the ground at his side, and
without a moment's hesitation rushed after Macguire. As in a dream
he saw two dark figures lifting something out from the torn curtain
surrounding the secret process; at his approach they dropped their
encumbrance, there came a loud report, and Jack felt a ball graze
his temple; then his own rifle spoke, and a yell of pain answered
its heavy discharge. A perfect fusillade of revolver-shots now
echoed through the night, and Jack felt the leaden messengers
whistle about his ears. With a just rage in his heart he dashed
right at the ruffianly pair; almost before he knew, he was on top
of them, and his clubbed rifle whirled through the air, descending
with a crash on Macguire's head. So severe was the stroke that the
stock of his weapon shivered into fragments; but Macguire's skull
was like iron; though the blow felled him like a stricken ox, he
struggled to his feet at once and staggered off into the night,
just as Mackay and Bob appeared on the scene. It had all happened
in a few moments, and when his comrades arrived, the boy was
standing with the shattered rifle still in his hands, gazing with
dazed eyes all around.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="i179" id="i179"></a><img src=

"JACK FELT A BALL GRAZE HIS TEMPLE; THEN HIS OWN RIFLE SPOKE">
</p>

<p class="caption">"Jack felt a ball graze his temple; then his own
rifle spoke"</p>

<p>"Well done, Jack!" said Mackay, heartily, guessing at once what
had happened.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but where's the other one?" faltered Jack. "There
were two of them a minute ago. Look for the battery, Bob;
look&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's gone," said Bob, quietly.</p>

<p>And so it was. Macguire's villainous associate had disappeared,
and with him the battery. He had left his hard-headed partner to
bear the brunt of Jack's vengeful blow, probably by a preconceived
arrangement, and, as Macguire most likely reasoned, a crack on the
head with a rifle was better for him than the bullet which he would
assuredly have received had he ventured flight at the same moment.
They had trusted to the boy's unwillingness to shoot&mdash;after
emptying their own firearms with deadly intent. They had pitted
their murderous cunning against the lad's humane judgment, and they
had succeeded in their nefarious plan.</p>

<p>"I ought to have fired; I ought to have killed them," muttered
Jack, despairingly. "I knew their revolvers were empty at the last,
only I didn't&mdash;like&mdash;to&mdash;shoot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did well, my lad," spoke Mackay, encouragingly. "I wouldna
have cared for the blood o' even twa such scoundrels to be on your
young heid, though had they killed you, I would have chased them up
an' choked the breath oot o' them baith afore morning."</p>

<p>Very few of the tent dwellers around appeared to have been
disturbed by the heavy firing. Only the Shadow and Emu Bill made
their appearance to investigate the cause, and when they learned
what had taken place, their language was full and eloquent.</p>

<p>"I'll twist that dandy chemist's neck in the morning," quoth the
Shadow, with earnestness.</p>

<p>Mackay laughed mirthlessly. "They'll both probably stay in
hiding for a bit," he said, "and the first thing we'll know is
another process being stuck up on the Flat. They'll crowd us out,
right enough, and we'll get nothing but what's in our own claims to
put through."</p>

<p>"But won't the miners stand by us?" suggested Jack,
hopefully.</p>

<p>"The miners, my laddie! The miners, especially on a new field
such as this is, are like sheep. They'll gang the way o' least
resistance, an' we canna afford to run a philanthropic concern for
their benefit altogether. It's Bob I'm sorry for&mdash;Bob whose
brain has done the work&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll let that go," said Bob, gently. "As you said last night,
I'll have at least a vivid experience to remember."</p>

<p>Next morning news of the theft of Bob's secret appliances spread
rapidly over the Flat. Mackay considered it advisable to let the
affair be known ere some "new" discovery became heralded abroad by
the perpetrators of the outrage.</p>

<p>"It will at least ensure the laddie's name as that o' the true
inventor o' the process," he reasoned, and so the report became
noised about.</p>

<p>At first the miners were indignant, and aggressively disposed
towards the two men who had so meanly defrauded a mere boy, yet
soon they calmed down.</p>

<p>"If there's more than one plant on the field we'll get the work
done cheaper," argued some one, and of course this placed the
matter in a new light as far as they were concerned.</p>

<p>There was no doubt as to the personality of the thieves. Early
that same morning, Macguire and Wynberg, the chemist, had been seen
driving off towards Kalgoorlie, and it had been observed also that
the publican's head was swathed in bandages, while his companion's
left arm was secured in a sling. Jack had certainly given them more
than they bargained for, and the knowledge was a source of much joy
to that youth, whose keen regret now was that he had not done them
greater hurt.</p>

<p>The days slipped by, and the incident was almost forgotten
before a week had passed; but the owners of the Golden Promise mine
knew well what to expect. They continued their work in the shaft,
digging out the refractory ore which now alone was left to them,
and regularly each evening Bob kept pace with results by treating
in the vat the entire amount raised in the day, and the
exploitation of the mine proceeded; a little more than another week
would suffice to exhaust the stratum within their boundary pegs,
and then&mdash;Bob wondered vaguely whether, after all, the process
had baffled the discerning powers of the chemist, and so would
allow them to profit by the discovery on a larger scale.</p>

<p>"You need scarcely hope for that, Bob," said Mackay, "as I said
before, the danger o' the discovery lay in its simplicity, and
Wynberg is a man wha has had a' the qualifications his university
in Germany could give him. They're vera smart mineralogists, those
Germans, Bob, and nothing much will pass them. A' the same, when I
get a grip o' the man I'll alter the state o' his health for a week
or so. I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mackay's anger overcame him, and he turned away abruptly to hide
his annoyance.</p>

<p>Events soon proved how clearly he had foreseen the plans of the
conspirators. That very night, Rockson, the battery proprietor,
came over to the Golden Promise evidently much perturbed.</p>

<p>"I've got a letter from Macguire, boys," he said hesitatingly.
"An' he gives me instructions to fit up a twenty-ton vat close to
my stamping-mill. He says Wynberg will be out in a day or so to see
it completed. I feel inclined to throw up the sponge, boys, I do; I
know it is your discovery he means to work. If the blackguard
didn't own so much o' the battery, I'd have nothing more to do with
him; but I'm in his power,</p>

<p>"Don't worry about my feelings, Rockson," replied Bob, with an
effort, for indeed the news had hurt him deeply. "I know you have
been straight with us from the first, and if I have to lose the
process I'd sooner see you work it than any one else on the
Flat."</p>

<p>"But say the word, an' I'll fix the thing up for you," Rockson
exclaimed eagerly, "there'll be next to nothing for the mill to do
after this, and I might as well have it out with Macguire now as
afterwards. You know the secret, and there's room for two plants on
Golden Flat."</p>

<p>Bob pondered for a moment, then slowly shook his head. "I'll
share my rights with no man unwillingly," he said firmly. "Macguire
can set up my process, but I, the inventor of it, will not compete
against him. I'm not commercial enough to beat him in the struggle
for popular favour. Besides, he owns a hotel, and I don't. Why, he
would get all the trade if only because of that. No, I won't strive
with him for what should surely be my own, but I'll make every man
on the field his rival. I'll give the secret away so that each
individual may work it for himself. Put up the vat, Rockson; it may
hurt me, but I'll see that it doesn't help him."</p>

<p>A quiet chuckle broke from the lips of Mackay, who had been
listening in silence. He had never seen Bob thoroughly angry
before, and the lad's display of temper on this occasion met with
his full approval.</p>

<p>"You have spoken well, Bob," he said; "we didna come out to
Australia to run a cut-price establishment alongside a
gorilla-faced purveyor o' bad whisky an' a thievin' German Jew. The
country is wide, Rockson, and there are more Golden Flats than one
in it. Anyhow, a golden mountain will serve us just as well, and we
may even be contented wi' diamonds an' rubies for a change."</p>

<p>He spoke lightly, but Rockson thought he saw something other
than mere banter in his words, and he departed wondering much what
new scheme Mackay had in view.</p>

<p>Bob and Jack too were rather surprised at their comrade's
strange remark, and noting their look of interrogation, Mackay gave
a rather reluctant explanation.</p>

<p>"I was thinking o' the Never Never land," he admitted, with a
far-away expression in his eyes. "You know every kind of wealth is
supposed to be hidden out there."</p>

<p>"Then why shouldn't we go?" asked Bob, promptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, why not?" Jack supplemented with ill-concealed
eagerness.</p>

<p>The big man gazed into the burning logs of the camp-fire, around
which they were seated, for several minutes before he made
answer.</p>

<p>"I've thought o' it often," said he, at length, "and Bob kens
that it is my dearest wish to go back on the old track...back to
the mountain ... and beyond. But there's danger in it, laddies;
many a strong man has gone under wi' thirst while crossin' the
great desert. Then there's the natives, savage and bloodthirsty,
an' filled wi' the awfullest cunning. It's a' vera well for me to
go. My interest in life was crushed clean oot o' me when I had to
come back alone last year, an' I havena much to lose
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't dissuade me by picturing the dangers of the trail,"
interrupted Bob, quietly. "I know you want to go, you've said as
much to me many times; and I tell you frankly I'm going with you.
What did you give me the sextant for?"</p>

<p>"I'm to blame, Bob; vera much to blame. I forgot whiles that
Jack an' you were young, wi' a' the world before ye, but the
reaction when I saw that I was infusing into you only my ain
restless spirit was cruel, cruel."</p>

<p>Mackay's emotion overcame him, and he buried his face in his
hands. Bob spoke again with forced calmness, "A restless spirit was
my birthright, and I am thankful for it. Why," he continued
passionately, "without it I might never have known you. I might
never have seen this great country where out of your goodness Jack
and I have made as much money in a few months as we could hope to
make in a lifetime at home. Let dangers come, you will find us at
your side ready and eager to meet them. No, we simply won't let you
go without us."</p>

<p>"Bob speaks for me every time," added Jack, promptly.</p>

<p>Mackay arose, straightened out his stalwart figure, and eyed the
boys with an expression of mingled gravity and happy
appreciation.</p>

<p>"So be it," he said, and there was an inflection of finality in
his tones. Then his voice became cheerful, almost joyous. "The fact
is, my lads," he added, "I have aye unconsciously been considering
your vera tender youth, an' feelin' that I was like the bold bad
giant in the story-books wha enticed wee bairns awa' to their doom
in the desert. No, Jack, I canna exactly say what book it was, my
memory is gettin' a bit defective, I'm thinkin'. However, Bob has
shown that he is a man every inch o' him, baith in brain and muscle
development, while you, Jack, you've got savvy enough for anything,
and did ye no' nearly kill twa o' the maist desperate men in the
country the other night, single handed? I'll no' say another word
against you goin' into the Never Never wi' me. I have wished it
from the first, an' though I tried no' to influence ye, there were
times when I couldna help mysel', when the spirit o' the lonely
desert sent her uncanny cry ringin' through my brain&mdash;that cry
which I ken so well by this time, 'Mackay come back to your
comrades; they wait for you by the mountain....' Ay, they wait for
me, their bleaching bones wait for me to hide them from the carrion
crows. But Mackay comes&mdash;he comes...Get me the flute, Jack,
an' let me play something cheery. I think I'll gie ye a selection
from the 'Geisha' for a change."</p>

<p>"And I reckon I'll sing 'The Muskittie's Lament,' or burst,"
said the Shadow, who just then approached. "I reckon my voice has
stretched a bit taller since I tackled it last."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the residenters of Golden Flat had cause to
marvel at the unwonted music, and succeeding outbursts of hilarity
which emanated from the head of the field.</p>

<p>A few days later Rockson's vat was completed, and that evening
Wynberg arrived by the mail coach, which now connected with
Kalgoorlie twice weekly, to arrange the final fixtures. He was
accompanied by three of Macguire's satellites, a most truculent
trio indeed they were, whose presence no doubt was for the purpose
of safeguarding Wynberg from being roughly handled by the men he
had wronged, but the dapper little German seemed nevertheless very
ill at ease. He alighted from the conveyance, which stopped just
beside Nuggety Dick's claim, and gazed around him anxiously, then
suddenly catching a glimpse of Mackay in the near distance, he made
a wild break for Rockson's camp, and never stopped until he was
safe in the manager's assay office, which was the only wooden
structure in the district that boasted a lock and key. His three
followers, grinning broadly, proceeded after him at a much more
leisurely pace. After that nothing was seen of the chemist for two
full days, in which time a heavily logged hut was erected beside
the huge vat, presumably for the purpose of containing the secret
appliances; assuredly Macguire and Wynberg intended to run no risks
of having the stolen process in turn stolen from them.</p>

<p>Then when he observed that the partners of the Golden Promise
were paying little attention towards his movements a feeling of
extreme bravery swelled in the little German's heart, and he boldly
made his appearance in the open, and swaggered about most manfully
when he noticed that Mackay was not in sight. His hearty fear of
the one man made him forget that there were others who bore him no
good will, and this oversight soon brought about the calamity which
he had daily dreaded. It happened late in the afternoon when Bob
and Jack were busy on the surface preparing the battery and gas
generator for their final effort, for the Golden Promise Mine had
at last cut out, and only ten tons of ore now remained to be
treated. Mackay was on the platform above the vat, shovelling in
the clayey mixture with great gusto, and whistling merrily to
himself the while. Indeed, from the happy countenances of the three
partners, it might have been judged that they had only at this
period struck the auriferous wash instead of having exhausted
it.</p>

<p>The Shadow, looking somewhat melancholy, stood a little way off,
his hands deep in his pockets, and his eyes fixed on the distant
horizon. He knew very well that Mackay's plans for journeying
across into the Never Never land would soon be put into action, and
yet the matter had not been mentioned to him. The Shadow felt
forlorn and miserable at the prospect of being left alone. "It's
all owing to that wretched German thief," he muttered savagely,
"Macguire was too fat-headed to do anything on his own."
Unconsciously, he turned his gaze in the direction of the newly
erected process, and a gleam of unholy joy lit up his features.
Wynberg stood there alone fondly surveying a legend which had just
been painted on the huge wooden tank. So large was the lettering
that the Shadow could read it without difficulty, "Wynberg's
Discovery."</p>

<p>"I don't see any o' his policemen around, I reckon I'll risk
it," he murmured, and he strolled carelessly over as if it were his
intention to view the inscription at closer range.</p>

<p>The unsuspecting man turned as he approached; at that moment his
pride and delight in himself left no room for other emotions. "Ha,
ha!" he cried; "so you have come over to pay your respects to the
discovery, have you? Well, well, you are quite right. Honour
brains, young fellow, honour brains," he tapped his little bald
cranium significantly, and struck an attitude as dignified as his
rotund carcase would permit. Then he began again, "There ees none
other process like mine; that young man&mdash;what's his
name?&mdash;could never do what I, Carl Wynberg, of the
Heidelbrughen University, have accomplished. I&mdash;&mdash; Ah!
Ough! Murder! Police! Thieves!"</p>

<p>The Shadow had suddenly gripped him by the back of the neck, and
lending impetus to his forward movement by a hearty application of
his heavily booted pedal extremities, he impelled him forward at a
run in the direction of the Golden Promise Mine. "I reckon you
ain't far out when you yell thieves," commented the Shadow, "for
you are about the worst thief in the country, you are; you wanted
me to pay my respects to the discovery, did you? Well, I reckon you
is now on the road to pay your respects to the discoverer."</p>

<p>In vain the German shrieked and expostulated; his captor's grip
was as a vice, and an honest indignation lent added strength to his
long sinewy arms. The din let loose drew the attention of Rockson,
who was in his assay office, and he bounded out.</p>

<p>"Come and pull this savage man away! Come at once, Rockson!"
cried Wynberg, twisting his head round appealingly.</p>

<p>"Not much, I don't," came the quick response; "you fight your
own quarrels," and he turned calmly and went back to his work. But
now Macguire's policemen came speeding up from the bottom of the
Flat, and as they came nearer and saw that the Shadow only was to
be pitted against them, their warlike threats against that young
man's person filled the air, and Wynberg, hearing their coming,
struggled and kicked and raved the more. But the Shadow did not
once relax his hold; he had by this time got his prisoner halfway
towards the camp, and he knew that prompt assistance from that
quarter would soon reach him.</p>

<p>Nor was he mistaken. Bob and Jack had been watching the affray
with keen amusement, and Mackay, who had observed the whole scene
from his elevated position, laughed so heartily that he had
difficulty in keeping his footing, but immediately Macguire's
followers hove in sight he checked his merriment, and made as if to
go to the Shadow's assistance. He thought better of it, however; "I
might brak' the mannie's back if I grippit him ower hard," said he.
"You go, Bob, and help the Shadow to bring him in."</p>

<p>Bob was off on that mission before the words were spoken, and
Jack too; but Mackay called the latter back before he had gone far.
"Two's enough, Jack," he said. "I want the beggar brought to me
hale, no' in scattered bits, an' Bob has a right to the job."</p>

<p>In a brief space the raging Teuton was dragged alongside the
vat, while the three fire-eaters, whose duty it was to protect him
from such ungentle treatment, contented themselves by hurling
defiance at Mackay and his companions from a conveniently remote
distance. But their wordy vapourings fell on deaf ears. The chief
object of their wrath seemed wholly unconscious of their
presence.</p>

<p>"An' so you've come to see the working arrangements of the
process again," he said to his unwilling visitor with a grim smile;
but there was a steely glitter in his eyes which alarmed Wynberg
amazingly.</p>

<p>"I'll have you put in prison for this!" he yelled. "To prison
you shall go!"</p>

<p>His enemy was unimpressed. "Humph!" he snorted. "Hoch der
Kaiser! Ease him up an' let me get a nice canny grip o' him
somewhere, my lads. Ay, that's near enough. Up she goes!" He
swooped down his great paw, seized the unfortunate man by the slack
of his wide riding-breeches, and, with scarcely an effort, hoisted
him up struggling like a sportive fish on a hook, and yelling loud
enough to waken the seven sleepers, over the ore platform, then he
calmly dumped him into the vat amid the bubbling slimes.</p>

<p>"You'll be in a position to observe a' the working arrangements
now," he bellowed. "Mak' the maist o' yer chance, you yelpin'
hyena."</p>

<p>The shrieks of Wynberg had by this time caused a large number of
miners to hasten up. "Great centipedes! ye ain't murderin' any one,
are ye, Mackay?" cried the foremost of them.</p>

<p>Mackay smiled blandly, and descended from his perch, leaving the
dripping specimen of humanity to crawl out from his unpleasant
environment as best he could. "I'm merely givin' the discoverer o'
Wynberg's Process an inside knowledge o' the work, an' he's howlin'
wi' joy an' gratitude, that's a'."</p>

<p>Then a great roar of laughter broke forth as a bedraggled figure
scrambled over the edge of the vat, shaking the clinging ooze from
his head like a water dog, and sputtering out mouthfuls of saline
fluid. Seeing the crowd assembled, and feeling safe from further
molestation, he gathered courage, and sitting down on the platform
he shrilled forth his denunciation of Mackay in the choicest
vituperative phrases of two languages. When sheer lack of breath
had pulled him up, Bob began to address the miners in even
dispassionate tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Men, you know that I am the discoverer of the original process,
and you also know that my batteries and generator were stolen on
the night of the public trial by two men. Jack surprised them while
they were carrying them away, and they tried their best to murder
him. I say this man," and he pointed contemptuously at Wynberg,
"was one of the thieves."</p>

<p>"It's a lie! It's a lie!" screamed the German.</p>

<p>"Get the beggar to roll up his sleeves," spoke Jack. "I guess
he's got the mark of my rifle bullet somewhere on his left
arm."</p>

<p>"Yes, roll them up, Wynberg," came the stern chorus from the
crowd.</p>

<p>But this the muddy little man absolutely refused to do. "I'm not
on my trial," he sneered insolently.</p>

<p>"I reckon that's just where you is wrong," growled the deep
voice of Never Never Dave. "This here is a regular roll up, an' in
the absence o' official representatives from the township, we, the
miners o' Golden Flat, stand for the law every time. When we says
hitch up your sleeves, then by the howlin' wilderness you've got to
do it, quick an' lively too!"</p>

<p>Yet still the request of the multitude remained unobeyed. Then
Mackay reached forth his hand and grasped the dangling legs of the
"Discoverer of Wynberg's Process," and hauled him ingloriously to
the earth. In a trice the slime-covered sleeve was pulled back, and
there slantwise across the forearm was the long red graze mark of a
bullet. The wound, though slight, was unmistakable.</p>

<p>Only a smothered expression of disgust showed the feelings of
the mining tribunal; they had never doubted Wynberg's complicity in
the theft, and by this time had almost forgotten about the affair
which indeed they had partly condoned as being a probable
development in their favour.</p>

<p>That matter settled, Bob continued his remarks: "The erecting of
Wynberg's Process, which of course is just my process, will
certainly serve the purpose intended in one sense. It destroys our
chance of making more than just a trace over cost price for
treating your ores, though I know well you would not have grudged
paying a small tribute extra for the inventor&mdash;&mdash;" A
unanimous shout of assent here greeted the speaker. "All the same,
I cannot blame you for welcoming another plant on the ground, but I
do blame the methods of the men who stole the idea, although I do
not feel nearly as bitter towards this man as I do towards the one
who prompted the action, and who has schemed against us from the
first. And now, after considering the matter over with my
companions, I have decided to give up my right to the discovery in
your interest; for the welfare of the country generally, and in the
cause of justice, I cannot allow Wynberg's Process to remain alone
on the field to make wealth for Macguire and Wynberg. No, I will
defeat their ends in a way they least expect. I will make the
secret public property!"</p>

<p>There was absolute silence for an instant, then came a roaring
tumult of applause. The miners could scarce realize for the moment
the magnitude of what had been promised; it staggered them, and
aroused their better feelings, but as the full meaning of what had
been said dawned on them, cheer upon cheer rent the air, in the
midst of which clamour Wynberg slunk off unobserved.</p>

<p>"By Jove! young man," cried one burly miner, "you've planted
your name on this here Flat for all time, for blow me if there's
any other title than Wentworth's Process'll get leave to live here.
You may not make wealth o' your discovery, but I reckon you'll have
a name in the gold-mining history o' Australia that wealth couldn't
buy."</p>

<p>That the speaker represented the feelings of the multitude was
evidenced by the rousing appreciation with which the speech was
received.</p>

<p>"Let's go and wipe out Wynberg's Process," cried some one, and
at once there was a rush in the direction of the flaunting
sign.</p>

<p>But Mackay restrained them. "Leave the miserable man's property
alone, boys," he said. "You have promised a' that I wished, an'
I'll hold you to your promise that the young laddie will aye get
the credit o' his own discovery. We're goin' away vera soon on a
new trail, an' may never see any o' ye again, but Wentworth's
Process will be wi' ye in oor absence to make you remember how much
you owe to a laddie's energy an' brains."</p>

<p>Then the crowd broke up amid noisy protestations of everlasting
good will, and the original group who held Golden Flat were left
alone. It was apparent that Emu Bill, Nuggety Dick, and their boon
comrades, Never Never Dave and Dead Broke Dan, were considerably
exercised over Mackay's statement about going away in the near
future.</p>

<p>"I reckon you hasn't given us too much notice," complained old
Dead Broke, reproachfully; "it'll take us a bit o' time to clean up
yet."</p>

<p>"But I don't want you to come with me, boys," remonstrated
Mackay. "I didna expect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I calc'late you made a mistake if you thought you were to
leave me," hastily interjected Emu Bill.</p>

<p>"An' me! an' me!" came the cry. The Shadow alone made no remark.
He knew that all present could not go, and he naturally reasoned
that he, as the youngest next to Jack, would be left.</p>

<p>Mackay, after a pause, appealed to them in logical language.
"You can't all leave your claims for the sake o' comin' wi' me on
what may be only a wild-goose chase," he said, "an' besides, six in
the party is quite enough. I think Nuggety there, who is the maist
capable gold-miner o' the lot o' us; an' Dead Broke, who has the
chance o' doin' vera well wi' his mine,&mdash;I think they should
both wait an' look after things while we are away. It would never
do to leave your mines half worked out. They would be jumped before
we got out o' sight."</p>

<p>"I believe that is just right," agreed Emu Bill. "Nuggety can
hang on to my interest for me; he's my partner, anyway."</p>

<p>"An' Dead Broke can do the same for me," cried Never Never Dave.
"The workings are shallow, and one man can easily get along on his
own, an' nary galoot can jump them neither, for the wash is pretty
well scraped out already, an' one man's pegs would hold what's
left."</p>

<p>In vain Nuggety and his approved companion protested against
this apportionment of their duties; innumerable reasons were
advanced to show how essential it was that they should remain, and
ultimately they agreed to the inevitable. Mackay had spoken truly
when he said that Nuggety Dick was a most accomplished miner; he
had been stricken with the gold fever in his early youth, and had
never recovered. It was almost a mania with him to discover new
fields; his aptitude for locating the powerful talisman was nothing
short of marvellous. But Emu Bill, though he chased up the golden
gleam with hopeful persistency, really, like all restless natures,
found his pleasure in the seeking rather than in the finding. He
was a bushman every inch of him, and no more valuable associate for
a risky journey into the heart of Australia could be found, as
Mackay well knew. As for Never Never Dave, his name had been earned
for him by his wide perambulations over the untrodden tracts; his
worth as a bushman was known throughout the land.</p>

<p>"But what about me?" pleaded the Shadow. "I has no one to look
after my claim, for I hasn't had no mate, but I reckon the old mine
has done pretty well by me, an' I won't kick about leaving it."</p>

<p>"How much o' the stuff do ye think is left in your shaft?"
demanded Mackay.</p>

<p>"About thirty tons, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Why, we'll go and help you to dig that out," cried Jack.</p>

<p>"And I'll run it through the vat in a couple of days," added
Bob.</p>

<p>"You see, Shadow," said Mackay, quizzically, "we canna vera weel
do without you."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be the sixth man?" cried the youth, delighted beyond
measure.</p>

<p>"You will that if ye promise never to sing 'The Muskittie's
Lament' without givin' due warning. You'd mak' us think the niggers
were comin' for us every time ye tackled that high note."</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll get an accordion&mdash;&mdash;" But the Shadow
got no further.</p>

<p>Wrathfully came the rebuke, "If ye dare purpose desecratin' oor
peaceful evenings wi' such an unceevilized device, I'll mak' a
present o' ye to the first hungry cannibal we meet, I will." Then,
when peace was restored, Mackay summed up the respective
responsibilities of the projected expedition's members. "You, Jack,
and the Shadow, have shown that you can handle camels in a
circumspect way, therefore you will have charge o' the team. Emu
Bill and Never Never Dave will assist when they are no' too busy
lookin' for water or fightin' niggers. Bob will be navigator; and
as for me&mdash;I'll be the pilot o' the craft, and will do my best
to guide you to the hidden treasure o' the Never Never, to the land
o' rubies, an' diamonds, and gold, which lies beyond the
mountain."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch9"></a>Chapter 9. Into the Unknown</h2>

<p>A full week was occupied in settling up affairs and making final
preparations for the journey across the wilderness. The question of
transport was speedily arranged. Three camels were necessary to
carry stores and sundry mining appliances, and a fourth would be
advisable to bear the heavy water-bags of the expedition, as it was
not wise policy to burden the animals unduly. Mackay's wiry
"Misery" was selected at once as the leader of the team, and two
other great leathery hided creatures belonging to Emu Bill and
Never Never Dave, named respectively "Repentance" and "Remorse,"
were called into requisition as being well fitted for the stern
work before them. A strong young beast was secured by Mackay from
an Afghan trader who called around opportunely, to make up the
quartet. This last addition to the outfit, which Jack promptly
dubbed "Fireworks," was inclined to be rather vicious in
temperament, and after seeing him buck two pack saddles off as a
preliminary, Mackay mentally resolved to trust the carriage of the
precious water-bags to the more patient "Remorse," and allow
"Fireworks" to cool down under more solid freight.</p>

<p>The stores of the expedition were not difficult to obtain; by
this time agencies of the large mercantile houses in Kalgoorlie had
been established on the Flat, and they were well able to provide
all necessary supplies. But the commissariat department of the
Australian explorer is never famed for his lavishness; in it
luxuries find no part, for here the ship of the desert is the
mainstay of the traveller, and on its cumbrous back only room can
be found for the bare essentials of life. Flour and tea, tinned
beef and various "extracts," these are the sum total of the
wanderer's requirements in the Australian wilderness, and with
these he would usually be more than content if water could be found
to quench his thirst. But this is too often denied, the arid wastes
of the great Austral land contain few oases. The scanty rains
collected in reluctant drops in some deep rock hole, perhaps for
years, are his only hope. Yet these grim forbidding tracts allure
the roving spirit if only because of their very grimness. Across
their scintillating sands what wonderful haven may be hid? Surely
it is not all desert, something must lie beyond the far horizon.
Nature's compensating law must hold some reward for the weary
pioneer who gropes so desperately onward and ever onward into the
rising sun. Such is the hope, the belief, of those who venture
forth into the Never Never. With Mackay, who had already followed
the beckoning phantom far back into an unknown mountain, the belief
had become almost reality. The spirit of the bush enthralled him,
its spell was ever over him. His young companions too were
influenced by the air of mystery surrounding their distant goal.
The unknown has ever exercised a powerful fascination over the
Anglo-Saxon youth, and the two boys revelled in the thought of
penetrating untrodden tracts, and rejoiced in their quest of El
Dorado.</p>

<p>When all was ready for a start Mackay called them together for
earnest consultation.</p>

<p>"I don't want to shout much about the dangers o' the trail, my
lads," said he. "But it is as well to understand that the risks are
there a' the same, an' it would only be richt for you both to mak'
a sort o' statement, an' leave it wi' the Warden.
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," said Bob, smiling; "you want us to make
our wills&mdash;in case of accident."</p>

<p>Mackay looked relieved. "It would be better," he admitted
quietly, "or send your money home. Don't think I want to force my
advice on you, but I think&mdash;I think that would be the better
plan."</p>

<p>"I've done that ever since we started to get returns from the
battery," answered Bob. "I only have kept what I thought I would
owe you for my share of the expedition."</p>

<p>"Mine has been sent home too," murmured Jack, diffidently; "but
I've kept two hundred pounds for the expedition."</p>

<p>"An' mine has gone home too," added Mackay, slowly. "But the
expedition is my consideration, and I must bear the expense alone.
It's a duty, my dear young lads, it's a duty."</p>

<p>No amount of persuasion would shake his decision in this
respect.</p>

<p>"It's a journey that's lain on my conscience for some time," he
argued. "I have a mission to fulfil which I hope may be outside the
other object o' the expedition altogether, though it's possible we
may achieve the one while in pursuit o' the other." He chuckled
dryly at the thought, then well pleased that his young friends had
disposed of their worldly goods to his liking, he went off to give
some instructions to Emu Bill about the loading of the camels.</p>

<p>The process had been left in charge of Nuggety Dick, who had
received full information from Bob concerning its proper working.
It had been open for public inspection all the week, and already
many similar vats were being erected on the field; and Wynberg's
discovery lay idle&mdash;its owner had vanished back whence he
came.</p>

<p>The unfortunately placed Rockson, however, was soon given a
position more to his liking than the control of a useless stamping
mill. Jackson, whose time was required in Kalgoorlie, at Mackay's
request, offered him the management of his mine, which was now
turning out large quantities of the refractory ore, and this he
gladly accepted under the generous arrangement of a fair salary and
a considerable interest in the profits. It was Mackay's strange
weakness that he could not allow another man undeservedly to
suffer, even indirectly, through any action of his or his partners,
and hence the exceptional terms offered by Jackson for his
services; he had only been too willing to oblige Mackay in the
matter as a slight return for the great favour he had received.</p>

<p>Bob and Jack were amazed when, after the Golden Promise had
closed down, they counted up the amount with which the Bank at
Kalgoorlie had credited them for their share in the gold sent in.
They found that they had each realized over a thousand pounds for
their few months' labour; the last two weeks' results had swelled
up their profits wonderfully, to Bob's deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad," he said to Jack, "that Mackay will benefit a
little by the process; it means that we have made some slight
return for his goodness to us, though money can never pay for all
that he has done."</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem to value money as some people do," observed
Jack. "I don't understand him yet, I don't."</p>

<p>It was after this that Mackay had ventured to express his views
to them on private concerns, and when he went away he left the boys
no little moved by his well-meant advice; the solemn note of
warning in his tones, even when he touched so lightly on the
dangers of the desert, had not escaped them.</p>

<p>"I do hope," said Bob, fervently, "that he may never have to
take the sextant from me. I&mdash;I get nervous when I think of the
responsibility he has given me. I wish too," he continued gravely,
"that I had some news from home before we start. I haven't heard a
word since we left. Of course they couldn't write until they knew
where we were, but I think there is time for an answer to my first
letter by now."</p>

<p>Jack calculated it up hurriedly. "It would come in by to-night's
mail," he said sadly, "and Mackay said we were to start after
lunch. I think we should tell him, and ask him to wait."</p>

<p>But this Bob would not hear of for a moment. "Certainly not," he
cried. "He treats us as men, not children, and I am not going to
worry him with home affairs. All the same," he reflected calmly,
"if I had thought of it before I would have mentioned it to him;
but now that everything is in readiness for the start&mdash;no, I
cannot."</p>

<p>"All aboard, boys; all aboard for the Never Never!"</p>

<p>It was the Shadow's voice, and they rushed out at once, turning
to cast one look at the dismantled tent which had been their home
during these eventful months. No tent or shelter of any kind was
being carried by the expedition. The starry heavens must now be
their sole roof at night.</p>

<p>They found the camel team waiting the signal to move ahead, and
Jack at once stepped to his position alongside Misery, the Shadow
having for the time taken charge of Fireworks, who was promising to
give trouble.</p>

<p>Mackay stood a little way off, and surveyed the team
critically.</p>

<p>"Tighten up Fireworks' girth, Emu," he cried. "He'll slip his
saddle in a minute."</p>

<p>Emu Bill proceeded deftly to obey the instruction, annoyed with
himself because of having overlooked the defect.</p>

<p>"I'll swear the cunning brute has shrunk hissel' on purpose," he
growled. "I pulled him in as tight as a windlass barrel just a
second ago. Woah, Fireworks, woah! ye cantankerous son o' a
gun."</p>

<p>But Fireworks was intent on creating a diversion. For some time
he had been allowed to roam the desert at his own sweet will, and
probably his memory of pack-saddles and such like encumbrances had
faded into happy oblivion, but now that he felt the old galling
weight on his back his vicious temper was aroused to fury, and he
stood waving his weird-looking head about in savage sweeps, and
ever and again essayed to roll over, pack-saddle and all. When Emu
Bill approached him now, the recalcitrant animal suddenly began a
series of frisky antics, pulling wildly at the nose rope which the
Shadow clutched firmly, and twisting its huge bulk into all sorts
of contortions.</p>

<p>In reply Fireworks snorted defiance, then bent himself almost
double; a sharp crack sounded out as the girths burst, and in a
moment the sand was strewn with his load.</p>

<p>"So that was your little trick, was it? ye measly old
quadrooped!" cried Emu Bill, in disgust. "Well, I reckon you kin
try it over again."</p>

<p>He gathered up the saddle for another effort, but Mackay
intervened.</p>

<p>"It won't do, Bill," he said. "We'll just have the circus
repeated. We'd better postpone the start until the morning, an'
meanwhile we'll put Fireworks through his paces. I didna think the
beastie would be so obstreperous."</p>

<p>And, indeed, to look at the animal now, no one would have
thought that such a fiery temper lurked in that cumbrous body.
Fireworks, after his unruly performance, stood gazing meekly at the
wreckage he had created, the very picture of innocence. Yet it was
a wise policy to break him in to a more fitting tolerance with his
burden before venturing into the great desert, where mishaps would
cause more vexatious delays, and probably occasion damage which
could not then be easily rectified.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the whole team was unloaded, and the remainder
of the day spent in coaxing the one refractory camel into a more
tractable spirit, a result which Emu Bill and his companion bushman
seemed to have thoroughly accomplished before sundown, and high
hopes were entertained of making an early departure next
morning.</p>

<p>The mail arrived somewhat earlier than usual that night, a fact
which did not surprise any one when they saw Macguire sitting on
the box-seat beside the driver. Mackay sighed wearily when he
observed his old enemy.</p>

<p>"I had hoped I had seen the last o' him," he said to Bob; "but I
suppose the misguided man is looking for trouble, as usual." To his
astonishment, however, Macguire purposely evaded him, and
disappeared rapidly down the workings to where some of his old gang
were still employed on none too lucrative holdings.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's got tired of running up against us," said Bob. "I
don't think the game has paid him too well, and he may be turning
over the proverbial new leaf now."</p>

<p>"Umph!" Mackay's monosyllabic utterance was non-committal, but
it was plain that his faith in that new leaf in the present
instance was none of the strongest.</p>

<p>The mail brought a letter for each of the boys and one for
Mackay, and on glancing at the handwriting on his envelope Bob was
satisfied; the expected news from home had reached him, after all.
Hurriedly he tore it open, and read the closely written sheets
which a fond mother had penned. He smiled brightly at the anxious
opening phrases, which inquired so minutely about his health and
general welfare. "I have heard," she wrote, "that fever often
breaks out in a gold-mining camp&mdash;malaria or gold fever, I
think&mdash;and I am sending you a small bottle of quinine, which I
want you to promise to take regularly&mdash;&mdash;" Bob thought
that rather good, and read the sentence aloud to Mackay, who had
mastered the contents of his epistle at a hasty glance. That
gentleman was gravely amused. "She's richt about the gold fever,"
said he, with, a short laugh, "an' it's a terribly rampagin'
disease in its way, though I dinna think quinine would affect it
much. Prussic acid or some such deadly poison would be the only
cure, for once a man gets the gold fever it remains in his blood a'
his life, ready to be stirred up to violent action at the sight o'
a nugget. Ay, it's a bad fever, Bob, an' we've a' got it in some
degree. However, your guid mother needna fear aboot the other
plague&mdash;malaria&mdash;for neither it nor any other disease o'
the kind can live in Western Australia. You must just write a note
an' tell her that. The air o' this country is too dry an' clear for
any microbe to fancy."</p>

<p>Bob continued his silent perusal of the letter, and as he got
towards the end a puzzled expression came into his features; it was
clear that the letter from home contained something of more
striking import than the warning against pernicious fevers. The
intelligence which disturbed him was conveyed on the last two
sheets, and this was how it ran:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know you will be grieved to hear that your uncle Dick is
dead. Since your father was drowned I have never had a line from
him; he was the first to bring the sad news to me, and his own
sorrow seemed greater than he could bear. Your father and he had
been inseparable companions in their youth, and many times before
the <i>Sea King</i> sailed on her last cruise I used to hear them
planning out their great schemes for the future, for your uncle had
ever been a wanderer, and was filled with strange ideas about the
riches of some parts of the world he had visited. He went off to
Australia after arranging your poor father's affairs, and nothing
was ever heard of him again. All along I fancied that it was his
money which provided the little income left to us, for you father's
savings could not have been much; sailors are so poorly paid. The
solicitors always put me off when I inquired about it, but now I
know that it was his great kindly heart which went out to the widow
and the fatherless, and caused provision to be made for them out of
his own scanty means. On the morning after you left I received a
letter from a gentleman who had just returned from Australia, and
who had been with him when he died, enclosing a draft for two
hundred pounds, and saying that that was the sum realized by the
sale of your uncle's effects, and that he had been entrusted to
send it to me. No other information was given, and no address was
on the letter. When I showed it to my solicitors they told me the
truth of what I had guessed from the first. My boy, you were always
uncle Dick's favourite, and you have every cause to remember him
gratefully. If you can find out where he died, erect a little cross
over his resting-place for me. I would so much like to have it
done."</p>

<p>Bob read and re-read the strange story which brought back the
past so vividly to his mind, and his eyes grew moist in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>"No bad news, I hope, lad," spoke Mackay, kindly.</p>

<p>Bob struggled with his emotion for a moment without success,
then handed the pages to his interrogator in silence. Mackay read
them over carefully, with a face showing keen concern; indeed, he
seemed even more moved than Bob when he had finished. "Ay, ay," he
said huskily, "he was a good man, an' there's too few o' his sort
in the world. But you'll dae what your mother bids you. You will
put up that cross afore you leave Australia. I'll&mdash;I'll help
you to find the place." Then he turned abruptly to Jack, who had
read his letter, and was now gazing at the envelope with profound
content.</p>

<p>"You've been gloatin' over your billy doo for some time, Jack,"
he said lightly. "I don't suppose your news has affected your
appetite."</p>

<p>Jack flushed, and made haste to secrete his precious missive;
but in his hurry the envelope fell to the floor, and it was
observed that it bore the same peculiar postmark as Bob's. The boy
grabbed it up in confusion, while the big man laughed. Whereupon
Jack waxed indignant.</p>

<p>"What about your own billet-doux?" he asked mischievously. "I
think I noticed you got a letter too."</p>

<p>"Here it is, young Lochinvar, here it is," and Mackay flung an
open sheet at the youth. "Read it, read it; don't mind me. I'm sort
o' pleased to mak' it known that somebody thinks o' me."</p>

<p>Obeying his request, Jack cleared his throat and read aloud the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mr. Mackay.&mdash;<br>
<br>
"I have just heard that you are about to start out on a journey
into the interior, and I thought I would remind you of a little
account I have against you for several items you sent for last
week. The amount is &pound;10 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I'll let you
off the odd sixpence, but please send your cheque for the remainder
before you start. The Never Never is such an uncertain
country&mdash;to get out of. Best wishes.<br>
<br>
"Yours sincerely,<br>
"J. Rannigan."</p>

<p>"Now, that is what I call a thoughtful letter," commented Jack,
when he had finished.</p>

<p>Then they set about preparing tea, and while they were thus
engaged the Shadow made his appearance, evidently in great good
humour. He carried something concealed in his hand which he gazed
at tenderly as he entered, then consigned it to some secret recess
in his scanty wardrobe.</p>

<p>"I reckon," said he, "that I want an invite to your banquet
to-night. I hasn't even an inch o' damper left in my tent. I broke
up the happy home too soon, I calc'late."</p>

<p>Mackay laughed. "I ken you're a grand cook, Shadow," said he,
"an', providin' ye behave, we'll be glad to have your company.
Ye'll get flour in that bag at your feet, an' water in the
kerosene-tin beside ye. Now ye can take my place an' mak' wi' these
ingredients something nice an' tasty. I'll even gie ye a tootle on
the flute to inspire ye in yer efforts."</p>

<p>The lad's countenance fell. "I see I has come along too soon,"
he grumbled. Then he fished about in the folds of his shirt and
drew forth the treasure he had secreted. In the quickly fading
light it was not easily observable what he held in his hand; but
when the wondering trio saw him convey the same to his mouth their
worst fears were realized. Before they could protest, the wailing
of a mouth-organ filled the tent. The Shadow blew with might and
main, an ecstatic joy illuminating his features, his foot keeping
time to the music he perpetrated, and sending up clouds of dust
from the sandy floor. That he anticipated a sudden closure was very
apparent by the fierce energy he displayed, yet, strangely enough,
he was allowed to finish the first tune without mishap; it was only
when he adroitly essayed to glide off into a fresh outburst that
Mackay intervened.</p>

<p>"Ye should play that first spasm mair pianissimo," he ventured
mildly, while Jack sprinkled water about to allay the dust. "Now,
put that orchestra in your pocket, an' keep it there until we get
far oot into the bush. Then ye can kill the crows wi' it if ye
like."</p>

<p>"Right O!" responded the Shadow, seemingly delighted to have
escaped so easily. "Now, I reckon I'll bake a real bowser brownie
for tea, an' we'll have a real ole blow out, we will."</p>

<p>"Let us eat, drink, and be merry," remarked Bob, thoughtfully,
"for to-morrow we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Start for the Never Never," prompted Jack.</p>

<p>Shortly after sunrise the camel team was once more loaded up,
and now Fireworks' demeanour was beyond reproach; he submitted to
his burden with philosophic calm, and only once showed his playful
disposition by tearing the sleeve from Emu Bill's shirt while that
gentleman was standing too conveniently near his head. By eight
o'clock all was ready for the start, the last breakfast in camp had
been partaken of, and the various members of the expedition were
standing at their posts awaiting the signal for advance. The
population of Golden Flat had turned out <i>en masse</i> to witness
the departure. It was not every day that an expedition left for the
distant Never Never. Nuggety Dick and Dead Broke Dan were there
looking anything but happy; one word from Mackay even now would
have made them join the party but the leader of the expedition
sternly refused to meet their appealing eyes. Once more he glanced
over the team critically, as if mentally weighing up the amount of
endurance contained in the four powerful animals. His scrutiny
seemed to give him much satisfaction, and he smiled grimly as he
turned his face to the east.</p>

<p>"All ready, boys?" he cried.</p>

<p>"All ready!" came the unanimous reply.</p>

<p>Then, just as he was about to signal "Right away," the crowd
parted, and Macguire struggled to the front.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, boys!" he shouted. "I want a word with
Mackay."</p>

<p>As for Mackay, he viewed the interrupter with considerable
disfavour.</p>

<p>"If you had any differences to settle, you might have come along
last night," he said. "What's the trouble wi' you?"</p>

<p>"Why, man, I just want to say that I bear no ill feeling, an'
that I hope you'll be successful, that's all. What course are ye
making?"</p>

<p>Mackay gazed at the questioner in puzzled wonderment. "I'm glad
to have your good wishes, Macguire," he said slowly. "Our course is
east by north to a place that's a bit harder to find than Golden
Flat. Let her go, boys!"</p>

<p>The long whips cracked, Misery's bell began to chime; the crowd
stepped back to give the ponderous team free passage, uniting as
they did so in a stentorian Coo-ee, that strange call of the bush
which combines in its notes the acme of feeling and good
fellowship. Bob and Jack coo-eed lustily in return, Mackay waved a
cheery goodbye, Emu Bill and Never Never Dave chaffed their
sorrowing acquaintances with tender affection as they passed along
the line, and the Shadow, pulling at Fireworks' nose-rope with one
hand contrived to unearth his mouth-organ with the other. Strongly
he blew, and stepped forth jauntily to the stirring time of "The
Girl I left Behind Me," but his charge steadfastly refused to
accelerate his gait in such undignified fashion, and the Shadow had
perforce to seek around in his <i>r&eacute;pertoire</i> for a more
suitable march, which he soon found in "There is a Happy Land," and
he kept up his melancholy dirge until he heard Never Never's voice
raised in dire threat against his person. Then there was silence,
broken only by the tinkling bell of the leading camel, and the
vague echoes of Golden Flat's farewells.</p>

<p>Thus they headed out towards the desert, into the land of the
Never Never.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch10"></a>Chapter 10. An Awkward Predicament</h2>

<p>The first halt was made at noon when little more than eight
miles had been traversed. The country encountered from the start
had been a soft powdery sand formation, with occasional belts of
dwarfed eucalypti, which intervened from the north. Progress was
necessarily slow at this early stage of the journey, for it was
advisable to allow the camels to harden to their work
gradually.</p>

<p>Mackay had so far led the march, steering an approximate course
by the sun, but immediately they stopped, he called Bob aside for a
conference.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "when we went out before we started from a
more northerly latitude, an' I calculate we should hit our old
track in another hundred and eighty miles if we keep angling in a
wee bit north o' east. I've got a copy o' the log up to pretty near
the&mdash;the finish, an' here's where I think we ought to join on
to Bentley's route." He unfolded a long track chart which he
carried in his hand; it was made up of several sheets of ordinary
note-paper, gummed laterally together, and on its much faded
surface several inky hieroglyphics stood out bravely. He pointed to
a besmeared cross nearly halfway over the chart, and Bob, looking
closely, read the printed lettering beside it: "Fortunate Spring,
lat. 28&deg; 17&acute; 5&acute;&acute;, long. 125&deg; 19&acute;
6&acute;&acute;."</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="i215" id="i215"></a><img src=
"2300241h-images/i215.jpg" alt=
"HE UNFOLDED A LONG TRACK CHART WHICH HE CARRIED IN HIS HAND">
</p>

<p class="caption">"He unfolded a long track chart which he carried
in his hand"</p>

<p>"We are somewhere under the twenty-fifth parallel just now,"
reflected Bob. "That means we are about 120 miles south of your old
track. I'd better draw out our present position on my own chart and
mark a compass course for Fortunate Spring."</p>

<p>Mackay looked relieved. "Be vera exact wi' your calculations, my
lad," he said earnestly, as he walked away.</p>

<p>Bob took the sun's altitude three times while a hasty lunch was
being prepared, and laboriously checked each result to five places
of decimals, then he carefully marked their temporary camp's
position on his still bare chart, and drew a dotted line thence to
the location of Fortunate Spring.</p>

<p>"We'll have to travel nor'-east half north to make it," said
he.</p>

<p>Mackay nodded cheerfully. "I hope we are lucky in strikin'
water," he observed. "About ten days is our stretch without it, for
the camels can't stand more, and they can't stand that often
either."</p>

<p>"We'll hit it right enough," commented Emu Bill, hopefully.</p>

<p>"If it's in the country, you kin bet I'll smell it," grunted
Never Never. "I'm strong at nosin' out water, I am."</p>

<p>"Oh, after that one hundred and eighty miles, I'll know where we
are," said Mackay; "but there's always some little uncertainty as
we understood from the first, an' it won't be outside o' our
calculations if we do go thirsty a bit."</p>

<p>"Not a blessed fraction!" cried the Shadow, decanting the
boiling tea from the billy into the enamelled cups. "Who says
sugar? You, Emu? Well, there ain't none; have a try at saccharine,
an' be happy." He gulped down his own portion hurriedly, then ran
off to round up Fireworks, which was beginning to stray too far
from his neighbours, and ten minutes later the expedition was once
more on the move.</p>

<p>The next several days passed uneventfully; the same uninspiring
desert sands prevailed, and the intense heat haze radiating from
its shimmering surface affected the eyes of the travellers, causing
them to quiver and blink painfully, while overhead the sun stared
down from a cloudless sky. Not a trace of moisture was visible
anywhere, certainly no water could exist amid these barren wastes,
and all hoped most anxiously that a change in the monotonous
landscape might soon take place.</p>

<p>"It's a pretty thirsty lookin' start we've made," said Mackay,
when a week had elapsed, and they still struggled along ankle deep
in the burning sands. Bob was walking by his side keeping an eager
eye on what appeared to be a light cloud-patch on the far horizon.
He had noticed it for some time, but was unwilling to mention his
hopes in case they might be doomed to early disappointment. Now,
however, he felt pretty sure that his eyes had not deceived
him.</p>

<p>"There's a belt of timber straight ahead," he announced quietly,
after Mackay had spoken. The elder man shifted his gaze somewhat,
and with puckered eyes surveyed the slight break on the horizon's
even curve.</p>

<p>"You're quite richt, Bob," he remarked, with a sigh of relief.
"I've been steerin' by the shadow o' the sun across the camels, an'
I've almost mesmerized mysel', I think, or I should have seen those
trees earlier. It's a hard course for a bushman, Bob, that
fractional nor'-easter you gave me."</p>

<p>Emu Bill and Never Never Dave had by this time found it
necessary to assist in pulling the camels through the sand. Jack,
leading Misery, had not much difficulty with his charge, for that
wiry animal plodded steadily onward with ponderous movement despite
all obstacles, but Fireworks was by no means as energetic as he
once was, and the Shadow anathematized him roundly as he, with bent
shoulders, strained at the nose-rope of the reluctant beast, a
proceeding which the two bushmen had soon to emulate. Now, when
these weary individuals heard of the impending change in the land
surface, they gave vent to their joy in sundry whoops of
delight.</p>

<p>"It looks likely country for water, Mac," cried Never Never, as
they drew nearer, and could plainly distinguish the feathery scrub
in their course. The sand too as they advanced, hardened
considerably, and here and there great dioritic blows reared their
heads above the plain.</p>

<p>"You're right there, Dave," responded Mackay, after a while, "if
there's been any rain in the district for the last year or two we
ought to find a rock hole&mdash;Hillo! Easy boys, and get your
rifles ready. I see a wheen niggers dodgin' aboot among the
scrub."</p>

<p>"Nigs!" echoed Emu Bill and Never Never almost with one voice.
There was an inflection of decided pleasure in the exclamation, as
if these two had longed for a skirmish to ease the routine of their
journey. Mackay himself seemed in no way displeased, yet he took
care to impress caution on his impetuous associates. "A spear or
boomerang can kill as well's a bullet," he warned, while each man
examined his rifle. "Now, Jack, don't be so anxious to get forrit,
an' keep on the lee side o' Misery an' no' at his head when we get
near."</p>

<p>As yet Bob was unable to distinguish any aborigines among the
sparse scrub, but as they continued their wary advance he soon
perceived several dusky forms crouching amid the timber, and his
heart gave a bound when the savage creatures suddenly stood up and
united in a shrill yell of defiance. He had never dreamt that these
wild denizens of the bush could be so hideous; they seemed more ape
than man, their faces were covered by long tangling hair black as
jet, and only white gleaming eyes were visible; their bodies were
repulsively scarred and painted. This much Bob had time to notice,
then a hail of spears rustled out from the scrub, fell short, and
buried their barbed tips in the sand at their feet. And now the
bush seemed alive with blacks; uncouth forms sprang from the side
of each tiny sapling where they had been standing motionless, and
harsh guttural screams filled the air.</p>

<p>"They're a bit more numerous than I thought," muttered Mackay,
calling a halt, "an' I've an idea that if we dinna rush them pretty
quick, they'll rush us. Now, Jack, swing Misery round an' let him
stand, then grab your rifle." Jack obeyed promptly, and at that
moment another shower of spears hurtled overhead.</p>

<p>"By gum!" growled Never Never, "they'll get our range next
try."</p>

<p>"They're comin' for us now, I reckon!" cried the Shadow, and of
that there could be no doubt; the shrieking horde had evidently
decided to exterminate the invaders of their domain without further
delay. On they came, brandishing their waddies and boomerangs, a
compact mass of blood-thirsty black fury.</p>

<p>"Now, boys!" roared Mackay, "Aim low and stop them." A
thunderous discharge followed his words, and six rifles spat out
their leaden challenge to the foe. The wonderful din created by the
exploding cordite apparently stupefied the blacks for a moment;
they ceased their wild rush, and gazed with astonishment at those
of their number who had fallen. Despite Mackay's oft-repeated
animosity towards the aborigines in general, he could not
countenance wholesale slaughter. "They're a poor lot, boys," said
he; yet even while he commiserated with them the savages joined in
another determined rush. There must have been over twenty of them,
and so impetuously did they come that they were within twenty yards
of the white defenders before a second volley made them hesitate,
and even now they did not all stop; a few stalwart warriors kept on
their mad course, and hurled themselves almost upon the reeking
rifle muzzles. If the attack had been made in full force things
would have gone hard with the expedition. As it was, however, the
little group had no difficulty in beating back the frenzied band.
The Shadow and Jack were in their element; they little recked of
danger when plying their heated weapons, though the vengeful club
of one of the natives had missed Jack's head by little more than a
hair's breadth, and the Shadow's face had been severely gashed by a
flying boomerang. Bob could not fail to observe how serious matters
would have been had the natives made their onrush in skirmishing
order; their close blocked formation made it impossible for even
the most random shots to miss their billet, and now as the savage
and discomfited creatures sullenly withdrew, they dragged with them
many maimed and wounded comrades.</p>

<p>"I can't understand why the beggars are so stupid," said Bob,
watching the last of them disappear in the distance.</p>

<p>"Ye may learn more o' their tactics before our journey is
finished," Mackay observed quietly; "at the same time, there is a
wonderful difference among the tribes, an' that is where the
explorer's danger lies. He may judge from a nomadic spiritless lot
which he may chance to meet that a' natives are the same, and he
may gie his life for the mistake later on."</p>

<p>By this time the team was again on the move, and within a few
minutes a halt was made in the densest part of the scrub, while
Never Never and Emu Bill searched around for water. But the search
was vain, no welcome spring or rock-hole could be found, and a
heavy gloom began to affect the spirits of the party whose hopes
had been raised so high only to be thus rudely dashed. Even Mackay,
usually most cheerful in times of stress and danger, looked grave
as he reflected upon their somewhat unenviable position. He knew
what the others had not calculated upon. He knew that the camels
were already at their last extremity of endurance; accustomed as
they had been while at Golden Flat to drink every few days, they
had not absorbed their full supply before starting. Misery alone,
hardened veteran of many desert journeys that he was, had drunk his
fill, and now his great reserve of strength showed plainly over the
other beasts.</p>

<p>"I reckon them nigs had a mighty cheek to make such a howlin'
fight for nothin'," complained the Shadow. "One would have thought
they was protectin' a lake o' cool crystal water&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Slow up on that, Shad, or I'll squelch ye wi' an empty
water-bag," warned Emu Bill, who could not stand reference to such
an unlimited supply of the precious fluid at this moment.</p>

<p>"There must be water about, all the same," said Bob. "These
natives, I suppose, get thirsty, like other people. I'm off to have
a look round myself," and he sped away.</p>

<p>"Be vera careful, Bob, be careful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Bob was already out of earshot, pursuing a dogged course
eastward in the wake of the retreating blacks. In his hand he
grasped a heavy Colt revolver, which he had extricated from the
holster on his belt. A wild idea had seized him; he meant, if
possible, to capture one of the blacks and make him disclose the
treasure they had guarded so fiercely. It was a foolhardy plan
which had so hastily formulated in his brain, and in his calmer
moments Bob would have been quick to realize what a desperate
venture was that which he had now so lightly undertaken. But the
urgent necessity of finding water was powerfully impressed upon
him, and caution for the time being was thrown to the winds.
Eagerly he rushed along, and in a few minutes had passed out of
sight of his companions; then suddenly two ebony-skinned warriors
barred his path; he had blundered right on to them by the merest
accident. At a glance he saw that they were armed with waddies and
boomerangs only, their spears having probably been discharged in
the fray from which they had fled. Yet a waddie at close quarters
is no mean weapon, and Bob pulled himself up promptly, and with a
stern smile levelled his revolver. His astonishment was great when,
with a curious gurgle of mingled surprise and fear, the dusky twain
dropped their weapons and incontinently fled before him. And now
Bob's heart was filled with wrath because of the cowardice of the
pair. Had they only waited and surrendered quietly to his
request&mdash;though how he could have made them understand his
wishes he did not stop to think&mdash;all might have been well.
With scarce a pause he gave chase, covering the ground in long
impetuous strides, but it soon became evident that unless something
unforeseen occurred to check the flight of the fugitives, he could
never hope to overtake them. On they sped, clearing the sand in
great bounds, even stopping at intervals to gaze back at their
pursuer. Bob's chagrin was deep, and he sent one or two revolver
bullets crashing after the disappearing couple which had the effect
of making them run the faster, while far in the rear the excited
cries of his anxious comrades showed that they were now concerning
themselves over his prolonged absence.</p>

<p>Yet the ardour of the pursuit had taken possession of Bob; with
a mighty effort he managed to quicken his pace so that he actually
drew up considerably on the fleet-footed pair&mdash;scarce fifty
yards divided them. "Another spurt and I've got them," thought Bob,
and he clenched his teeth and strove boldly in the attempt. Now
thirty yards only separated them, now twenty, now ten. Bob chuckled
grimly to himself at the prospect of after all being successful in
the chase, and stretched out his hand, then in an instant the
hitherto level course came to an abrupt stop, a layer of branches
and spinifex grass spread right across the track. The blacks had
cleared it at a leap, but before Bob had time to prepare for a
spring he had staggered into the midst of the cut brushwood, and at
once felt himself sinking down into space. It all occurred in a
second or so. He clutched wildly at the pigmy branches as he
descended through them, but they broke in his hands, and with a
rush and a plunge he fell downwards into an unknown depth.</p>

<p>When he recovered himself, about a minute later, he became aware
that he was standing, considerably shaken and bruised, waist deep
in some semi-solid fluid at the bottom of a natural shaft, which he
mentally calculated to be at least twenty feet deep. He had found
water for a surety, and now would have given much to get out of its
slimy embrace, but the steep dioritic walls were quite unscalable.
Bob was hopelessly a prisoner. Then did he blame himself most
bitterly for his mistaken ardour and lack of perception. The wily
natives had but pretended to be overcome at the last wild rush so
as to lead him directly over the subterranean trap.</p>

<p>"Mackay was certainly right," he muttered. "Their cunning is
nothing short of devilish; and after being told of that, here I go
like a fool and prove it for myself."</p>

<p>He had little time, however, for unprofitable moralizings, and
he peered up and around his strange prison-house with anxious eyes,
yet his surroundings were of so murky a nature that he could only
vaguely guess the description of the trap into which he had fallen.
His gaze was instinctively directed toward the gaping hole in the
brushwood through which he had fallen, though what he expected to
see there he did not very well know. But he now realized the nature
of the blacks too fully to believe for a moment that they intended
to leave him to his fate without further molestation.</p>

<p>"Why, the water is bad enough as it is," he said, with a forced
attempt at pleasantry. "They'll certainly come to fish me out
before long."</p>

<p>He had not been in his awkward predicament many minutes when a
black grinning face stared down at him. Bob shuddered and crouched
closer to the damp rocks; he was half prepared for a stone to be
thrown or a spear to be poked tantalizingly in his direction, but
no such proceedings were taken. The demoniacally leering face
continued to look down at him without movement for several seconds,
when it was joined by another equally hideous; they belonged to the
two savages who had led him such an unfortunate chase. They had now
returned to view their victim after having probably given the alarm
to their fellows. Bob groaned in dismay, but returned their gaze
with stoical complacency, having not yet fully comprehended his
true position.</p>

<p>At length, however, his strange gaolers, with many guttural
exclamations, began to cover up the tell-tale gap in the layer of
furze; then their prisoner's senses returned to him with a rush,
and his emotions almost overwhelmed him. The blacks surely meant to
cover up the hole so that his companions might not find him, and
when they would depart after vain searchings, he would be left to
the tender mercies of the "stupid" natives he had so commiserated!
In truth Bob's cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>But he decided, nevertheless, to do his best to prevent the
success of their scheme. His revolver was still dry, for he had by
some odd instinct clung to it tenaciously despite his demoralizing
downfall, and now he became aware for the first time that he held
it in his hand. He fired two shots upwards in rapid succession.
Operations ceased on the instant, and Bob felt comforted. He knew
that Mackay would soon seek him out if any clue as to his
whereabouts was left. His rejoicings, however, were premature, and
very speedily checked. As he gazed at the sky through the gap which
gave him light, he noticed the aperture slowly yet surely grow
narrower and narrower. The blacks were pushing the superfluous
brush over the opening by the aid of long sticks! Bob shouted with
the full force of his lungs and discharged the remaining shots in
his revolver upwards, but only a hoarse cackle of satisfaction from
the natives answered his attempts at communication with the outside
world, and soon&mdash;as the last glimpse of sky was shut
out&mdash;he was enveloped in absolute darkness.</p>

<p>"Well, I assuredly could not have landed myself in a worse fix
if I had tried," he soliloquized with wonderful calm. "Here I am,
shut up in a twenty-feet water-hole in the middle of the Australian
desert and surrounded by hostile savages. That's pretty good for a
start&mdash;and, I'm afraid, for a finish too." He continued his
unpleasant musings, while he carefully reloaded his revolver. Then
he wondered what his companions would do when he failed to appear,
and a ray of hope flashed across his sorely tried brain. Mackay and
Emu Bill were expert bushmen, and indeed so was Never Never Dave.
He had often heard them speak of tracking up clues of even the very
flimsiest nature; might they not, after all, be able to follow the
slight impressions left by his footsteps on the sandy gravel?...
What a cruel irony of Fate to plunge him headlong into what he most
desired to find&mdash;water. Had he been caught in a sand-hole he
would not have felt so much aggrieved; but water, of all things!
While thinking in this strain, he remembered that, though he had
been extremely thirsty all day, he had not yet tasted of his find.
But his thirst had effectually gone from him, and he abhorred the
slimy touch of the fluid which encircled his limbs. Suddenly he
felt some huge creature brush against his knee, and then climb up
against him with many a wriggle and splutter. What new horror was
this? Bob was anything but timid in temperament, yet he shivered at
the sinuous contact of this unknown thing, and endeavoured
frantically to shake it off, but it only clung the tighter.</p>

<p>Some little time now elapsed, to Bob it seemed like half an
hour, for the moments dragged like ages, though five minutes would
have been a nearer estimate. Then a subdued muttering was heard
above, and he expected every instant to see more hideous faces
grinning at him through the bushy covering. He guessed that the
whole tribe had now arrived to witness his plight; and he was not
far wrong, for nearly all the warriors whose powers of locomotion
had not been interfered with earlier in the day had assembled
overhead. The weary sojourner in the depths kept his gaze fixed on
the roof of the shaft where one or two gleams of light filtered
through the last unevenly laid scrub; his eyes had by this time
grown accustomed to the gloom of his environment, and while he
watched he carefully cocked his revolver, and adjusted it to fire
on the hair trigger, so that his aim might not be disturbed at a
critical juncture. Soon a gaunt black hand drew aside the branches;
Bob's haste was his own undoing. Had he waited long enough the
oily-skinned savage might have let in the light more fully, but as
it was he fired, and a howl of pain told him he had not fired in
vain; but the brushwood fell back into position, and his prison was
left as dark as ever. He now made an effort to climb up the walls
of the dank and evil-smelling pit in which he was immured; but the
flinty formations exposed were dripping with moisture, and
slippery, and offered no place for foothold. Bob would have given
much then for a match, there were a few in the pockets of his
nether garments, but they were well submerged beneath the level of
the water, and consequently useless. The floundering animal that
had climbed against his legs next aroused his curiosity; he could
not imagine what sort of creature it might be, and his courage was
not sufficient to prompt his making a practical investigation as to
its form or temper with his hand, which, as it afterwards turned
out, was just as well for the hand. Another lull ensued, and he
began to be alarmed at the silence of his dusky gaolers. Were they
premeditating some sudden and novel doom for himself, or had they
indeed abandoned him to die in this horrible water-trap? And where
were his companions all the time? To relieve the monotony he fired
two more shots upwards at random and was rejoiced to hear another
yell of pain from outside, but a retaliation in the shape of a
fusillade of stones came crashing down, missing him by a few inches
only. Again he fired, and again. Bob had grown desperate, he did
not much care what form the reply of the natives would take, but
now he heard an answering shot in the distance, while near at hand
the Shadow's well-known voice hilloed out lustily. There now
appeared to be considerable agitation among the blacks above; their
feet pattered on the sand confusedly, and then a shrill yell
intimated to Bob clearly enough that his tormentors had taken
flight.</p>

<p>He was about to congratulate himself heartily on escaping so
opportunely from a distinctly awkward predicament, when he heard
the sand crunch under hurrying footsteps, and the Shadow, now close
above, commenced to shout his name. He was evidently bent on
following the retreating natives, for he halted not a moment, but
kept up his mad rush forward. Before the horrified prisoner below
could raise an alarm, he had jumped impetuously into the snare
which had already done its work so well, and a moment later he
tumbled down heavily head over heels by Bob's side. The spray he
threw up almost blinded Bob, and the fetid odours that were thus
again let loose, caused him to gasp wildly. His comrade in
misfortune struggled to his feet with eloquent maledictions, and
his amazement when he recognized Bob&mdash;the light was now
streaming down through the gap he had made&mdash;was very genuine
indeed.</p>

<p>"What in thunder is you doing here?" he cried.</p>

<p>Bob considered the question rather superfluous under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I'm fishing!" he replied laconically.</p>

<p>The Shadow ceased his flow of language for a moment, and
examined the walls of his gloomy habitation with interest. It did
not take him long to grasp the situation.</p>

<p>"Hang it, that was a tidy trick to play on a peaceable sort o'
cuss like me. They've bagged the pair of us, an' if we'd had the
savvy o' a mosquito, we didn't oughter be here," he snorted in
extreme disgust.</p>

<p>"It is a bit humiliating," admitted Bob, not at all displeased
that the wonderfully acute Shadow had blundered into the trap as
easily as himself. It tended to soothe his wounded feelings in no
little degree. "But all the same," he added brightly, "we've found
water, and that's worth some inconvenience, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The Shadow grunted something unintelligible and began to
prospect in the almost viscous fluid with both hands.</p>

<p>"There's some slimy crawler shoved up against me," he growled,
"an' I reckon I'm goin' to break his little back, so that he won't
have no appetite to feed on us afterwards." He groped around
viciously.</p>

<p>"I have had a good half hour of its company, whatever it is,"
remarked Bob. "But the splash you made frightened him off for a
bit. But hold hard! Shadow, hold hard, man! Don't you see what it
is?"</p>

<p>Bob's eyes, more accustomed to the dull environment than his
companion's, had now detected an unusually large-sized iguana
struggling in the water; it had apparently fallen in from above, as
they had done, and its snapping jaws looked decidedly dangerous.
The Shadow ceased his investigations with remarkable celerity, then
lifted up his voice in fluent condemnation of all sorts and
conditions of crawling creatures. When he had exhausted his store
of expletives, he made a vain effort to climb the oozy walls of the
cavern, and succeeded only in getting a fresh douche for his
pains.</p>

<p>"I wonder who'll come first," he murmured feebly, "Mackay or
them savages? I reckon we shid know pretty sudden."</p>

<p>They were not left much longer in doubt. The report of Mackay's
powerful rifle broke the silence, they recognized it by the heavy
charge of powder it fired and the series of shrill yells which
answered it showed that the natives were still in the vicinity.
Anon the anxious pair heard the scrub break before the advance of
some hurrying person, and the crunch, crunch of feet in the
sand.</p>

<p>"Go back and mind the camels, Jack," they heard Mackay's
decisive voice ring out. "I'll find Bob, if he's above ground, an'
that reckless young rascal o' a Shadow too."</p>

<p>"But we ain't above ground!" roared the last-named youth,
forgetting that his voice would be absorbed in the echoes of the
shaft before it reached the surface. On came the stalwart bushman,
and the fierce invective against the blacks in general, and these
savages in particular, which issued from his lips as he ran, came
as a revelation to Bob, who had never heard his friend so
moved.</p>

<p>In a few moments he had reached the vicinity of the pit wherein
the adventurous pair were entombed, and Bob made ready to signal
once more with his revolver, but such action was unnecessary. The
experienced eye of Mackay had quickly noticed the cut brushwood,
and he bore down towards it without hesitation. Then, thrusting his
head through the opening in the bushy covering, he surveyed the
captives below with a grim smile of amusement. "So this is where
you are, my lads," said he. His relief was so evident that Bob and
the Shadow felt even more ashamed because of the trouble they had
caused than there was any need for. Then Bob found his speech.</p>

<p>"There's water here," he cried.</p>

<p>"Water!" Mackay's ruddy features positively glowed with
pleasure. "Well, well, I shouldna wonder but what you've taken the
only means o' finding it, an' though it was a novel sort o' method,
an' just a trifle dangerous, we canna be too thankful that it has
succeeded. Now, you'll hae to content yoursel's a bit longer while
I see aboot gettin' a rope to pu' ye up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't go away, boss!" howled the Shadow. "Them yelpin'
baboons'll be back in two shakes if ye does." But Mackay had no
intention of going away; he proceeded to signal with his rifle, and
soon the entire camp, camels and all, arrived in answer to his
call. Great was the hilarity of Jack and the two bushmen when they
learned of the strange position in which Bob and the Shadow had
been found; but their joy was real indeed that water had been
discovered, after all, and when they raised their dripping comrades
to the surface they embarrassed them more by their expressions of
gratitude than by their display of what under the circumstances
would surely have been but a pardonable levity.</p>

<p>Now came the tedious process of drawing water for the camels to
drink, and also for refilling the almost dry canvas bags which
Remorse carried. For the latter purpose the thick sand-impregnated
fluid was laboriously filtered through a sheet of calico, so that a
fair amount of its solid matter was eliminated. But it was not the
sediment that was the most objectionable feature of the liquid; it
simply stank with vile odours, so that Emu Bill and Never Never
Dave, who had undertaken the duty of hauling up the buckets, had
anything but a pleasant time while they were so engaged. The boys
marvelled at the extraordinary capacity of the camels for the
uninviting solution; between them they managed to absorb well over
a hundred gallons, and when at length they were satisfied, very
little save mud remained at the bottom of the shaft.</p>

<p>"I would never have believed these natives capable of such a
smart trick as that they played on me," said Bob, who had been
unusually silent since his rescue. "Imagine the forethought of the
beggars in covering up that confounded hole, and then luring me
directly on to it!"</p>

<p>"They're no' so deficient in gumption as you at first
considered, Bob, my lad," answered Mackay, with a twinkle in his
eye. "However, I don't think they covered up the shaft exactly for
your benefit. Just look&mdash;&mdash;" He kicked a few of the
branches aside and drew Bob's attention to their wholly sapless
nature. "These same bits o' twigs have done duty for many a long
day. The natives cover the water principally to prevent evaporation
as much as possible, but also to keep all sorts o' animals an'
reptiles from fallin' into it an' so spoilin' the flavour. The
water has vera likely lain in that rock-hole for years, an' only
such judicious economy on their part has left us enough for our
needs."</p>

<p>"I reckon they'll have to shift their lodgings pretty soon,"
laughed the Shadow, "for they'll have a pretty hard job gettin' a
drink when we leave, an' the next man that does a dive into the
reservoir as Bob an' me did, shid strike something hard at the
bottom."</p>

<p>The afternoon was already far advanced, but when Never Never
Dave suggested that they should camp where they were until morning,
Mackay would not hear of such a proceeding.</p>

<p>"We'll find trouble soon enough without lookin' for it, Dave,"
said he, "an' if there's one thing I dislike it's camping near a
crowd o' niggers in the night time. They would try to swipe us out
before morning, for the miserable vermin get vera brave after
sundown. No, boys, we'll head out right now for Fortunate Spring.
Fetch out the compass, Jack, an' let me have a look at that course
again. The sun has shifted a bit since I worked out the correct
shadow to steer by."</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards Misery's bell began to chime, and the
camel team moved on its weary way.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch11"></a>Chapter 11. The Finding of Fortunate Spring</h2>

<p>For several days after leaving the scene of Bob's adventure the
travellers struggled over a most disheartening tract of country.
The timber belt amid which they had discovered water proved to be
but a narrow strip, extending down from the north-west; it
evidently marked the course of an ancient river-bed, for
immediately beyond its scope the sullen desert appeared bare of all
vegetation, save for occasional clumps of saltbush and tufts of
spinifex grass. Over this barren waste they forced their dogged
course, starting at sunrise and halting towards noon, when the heat
became too terribly oppressive both for man and beast; then in the
evening they would continue the journey, sometimes marching late
into the night. It was well for them that water had been found so
opportunely, for assuredly none promised in the arid sands they
were now encountering. The fifth day, however, brought with it the
hope of better things. Away to the east the landscape took on a
much more broken aspect, a feature which gradually extended right
across the line of travel. Great dry gullies, starting from
apparent nothingness, tore up the plain in all directions, and
giant boulders of desert sandstone outcropped in prodigal
profusion. And this drastic change in the land surface cheered the
wanderers mightily, for though in itself it offered greater
obstacles to progress than the weary sand-flats, it relieved the
eyes, which had become so weary of gazing at the seemingly
everlasting monotonous desert, and uplifted their hearts
strangely.</p>

<p>Another day, and several mouldering ridges surrounded them; mere
hillocks of sand they were, yet, rising as they did abruptly from
an even expanse, they appeared in the distance as precipitous
mountain steeps, and it was hard to believe that their grandeur
would fade away at a closer view. Within these guarding barriers, a
beautiful white tableland lay spread, so white and pure that it
glittered like marble in the sun's rays. The sight was a dazzlingly
splendid one, and Jack, who had been the first to climb the gentle
elevation hiding the valley from the south, had exclaimed in
delight&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a huge lake we are coming to; it looks like a great
frosted Christmas card!"</p>

<p>"Lake!" Mackay had answered, almost sorrowfully. "Ay, it's a
lake that will give us a maist desperate thirst, instead o'
quenching what we've got."</p>

<p>And soon the truth of this remark was borne painfully on them
all, for the lake was a mass of crusted and crystallized salt, that
crushed like tinder beneath their feet and showered over the heads
of the voyagers in sparkling clouds of finest dust. It filled their
ears and eyes and nostrils; they inhaled the minute grains with
every breath; it covered their tattered clothing in a gauzy film of
white.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blest!" ejaculated Emu Bill, "if this ain't the
cruellest joke to play on a thirsty sinner, an' nary a drink within
hundreds o' miles!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Bill, an' ye won't swallow so much of it," retorted
Never Never Dave, unsympathetically. Then he was moved to further
speech. "Bless yer soul! It's a whole brewery we'll want afore we
gets through this, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"I had an idea," observed Mackay, blandly, "that you two had
joined the temperance party a week or so before we left, so as to
get accustomed to a bit o' a drought."</p>

<p>"Temperance party!" stormed the unusually loquacious Never
Never, "I reckon this here circus would break up any anti-thirst
campaign in less'n five minutes."</p>

<p>He would have continued, but his companion sternly rebuked him
by casting at him the words with which he had himself been
silenced. After that not a word was spoken for fully ten minutes,
and the camel team staggered blindly on, floundering through
intervening salt wreaths like ships in a heavy sea. The lake
appeared to be nearly six miles in length, which meant that at
least two hours would be spent in the crossing, for their rate of
travel seldom exceeded three miles an hour, and was more often
considerably less. In that time, if each man satisfied his craving
for water from their very limited store, there would be but little
left, and by Bob's calculations they were yet about thirty miles
from the location of Fortunate Spring. But though each of the
little party suffered severely, not one of them made other than
jocular mention of his longing, and Mackay felt proud of the
fortitude and reserve they displayed. He was especially concerned
for Bob and Jack, for they, not having been hardened to such
experiences, must have felt the influence of their salt bath most
keenly; but if they were in any way incommoded they showed no sign.
Bob walked by Mackay's side, talking at intervals concerning the
probable geological history of interior Australia&mdash;a subject
of endless interest to him. Jack and the Shadow strode at Misery's
head, for now Fireworks needed no guiding hand at his nose-rope,
but followed submissively in the rear of Repentance, and from
snatches of their conversation, which floated to Mackay's ears, he
gathered that Jack was giving his Australian comrade a description
of the snows and frosts of the old country as a set-off to the
blazing heat they were now experiencing.</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon I'll go home with you," the Shadow was saying.
"It must be a grand country, wi' no snakes nor centipedes nor other
crawlers, an' nary muskittie to nibble you in your sleep."</p>

<p>Bob laughed. "I'm afraid the confined spaces at home would
hardly suit him after this," he said. "I don't think I could stand
the nature of things on the other side myself now."</p>

<p>"Because you're a born wanderer, Bob," smiled Mackay; "an' the
world itself will soon be too small for you."</p>

<p>At last the end of the salt lake was reached, and cheerfully a
path was forced over the encircling ridges, for all had high hopes
of what might lie beyond. But disappointment again was their
portion: the grim, unbroken desert stretched before them in all its
hideous dreariness; the land of beau desire had not yet come.</p>

<p>"I remember well," said Mackay, "that Fortunate Spring was in a
pretty bare sort o' country, but it certainly wasna as bad as this,
although we had a hard tussle before we came to it."</p>

<p>On, on, they struggled; but, if anything, their course became
more difficult as they proceeded. On the following morning a gentle
wavy outline against the sky in the northerly distance warned them
of some impending change, but by this time the members of the
expedition had become spied to their comfortless lot, and scarce
dared hope for an improvement until they neared the portals of
their goal, their shadowy land of El Dorado.</p>

<p>Gradually the sinuous curves on the horizon loomed up plainer to
the view, and lo! as they crested an intervening sand hillock, a
strange sight met their gaze. As far as the eye could reach west or
north, a sea of undulating sand ridges appeared, rolling down like
gigantic breakers from the dim north-west, the mighty valleys
between each swelling sand-wave being over a hundred yards apart
and fully thirty feet deep. Capping these wonderful billows regular
rows of saltbush and spinifex, so regularly spread, indeed, that in
the rosy morning light the whole scene was like some Brobdingnagian
field, with furrows bearing luxurious vegetation.</p>

<p>"I reckon we has struck the land o' Goschen at last," said the
Shadow, joyously.</p>

<p>"It does look pretty," Jack allowed hesitatingly, as they stood
to take in the view, and waited for the others to come up. Indeed,
so unaccustomed had they grown to seeing such close array of even
the wiry desert growths that for the moment all imagined they
looked upon a wildering forest. The saltbush was by the fantasy of
mirage exalted to lordly proportions, and the spiky spinifex
patches drooped in the sun's rays like the spreading fronds of the
stately palm.</p>

<p>Mackay dispelled the illusion; he of all the party seemed ill at
ease.</p>

<p>"I didna think the sand-waves extended so far back," he
muttered, half to himself. Then he added, aloud, "It's no' a land
o' promise you're lookin' at, boys; it's a deceiving land o' misery
an' dispair, where many a good man has lost his life."</p>

<p>"But what about the beautiful trees and shrubs?" asked Bob, in
wonderment. "They seem to stretch back for miles and miles."</p>

<p>"It's only another case where distance lends enchantment, as the
poet says, my lad. Your trees are only saltbush, and instead o'
growin' closely, there's over fifty yards between each o' them;
it's those behind that fill in the gaps. The eye can never
understand the perspective o' this country, the air is so clear
that distant objects almost blend wi' what is close at hand."</p>

<p>He spoke truly. When they forced their way at a difficult angle
across the vast undulations, they discovered to their sorrow that
only the sparsest of vegetation found root on the hill crests,
while the long interstices were absolutely barren. Not only this,
but the sand on the inclines and declivities was so loosely packed
that the camels sank to the knees in their strenuous efforts to
scale them, and had to be pulled over the barring obstacles by
sheer force.</p>

<p>"A day of this will just about finish Remorse," said Mackay,
noting how that meek yet willing animal was labouring under its
load. "I think, Bob, we'd better keep in the trough o' these
confounded waves until we run oot o' them, I ken we must be near
the edge as it is, for I mind that Fortunate Spring was a good
day's travel past their eastern limit. That was why the chief
called it by that name. We were vera nearly lost on those same
ridges; we didna find a drop o' water for over a hundred miles, and
we were just about dead beat when we came upon it."</p>

<p>"How far do they run towards the north?" questioned Bob.</p>

<p>"Well, Carnegie, who was one o' the finest explorers that ever
handled a sextant, calculated they covered nearly three hundred
miles o' West Australia. What their area is God only knows, yet it
must be over fifty thousand square miles."</p>

<p>"I should think this would be nearly as bad as the Sahara," said
Jack, as he tugged at Misery's rope. "I haven't seen a drop of
water since we started, unless that which Bob fell into."</p>

<p>"The Sahara?" echoed Mackay. "Why, we wouldn't ca' it a desert
at all. It's only because it's so near the old country that it is
considered to be anything extraordinary. This country, Jack,
wouldna be an explorer's preserve if it contained as much water as
the Sahara. It would be overrun in every direction by
gold-miners."</p>

<p>Then Jack was silent, marvelling greatly that in his earlier
youth at school he had learned so little concerning the vast sandy
wastes of Australia. Soon, as they kept on their altered course,
the retarding undulations began to grow less and less high, and by
late afternoon they had merged into the monotonous plains, now
welcome indeed to the travellers after their encounter with the
formidable sand-ridges. But their progress that day had barely
totalled ten miles, and the camels were well-nigh exhausted after
their extreme exertions. The poor brutes had had a severe
experience from the beginning, and the rough usage was telling
heavily upon their strength. That night they could scarcely muster
up sufficient spirit to chew their usual meal of saltbush tips,
and, after a few weak efforts, Remorse and Repentance lay down in
the sand, while Misery and Fireworks gazed at the little group
around the camp-fire with mute, appealing eyes.</p>

<p>"I hope we don't have any trouble finding that spring," said
Mackay, anxiously, and instinctively they all turned to Bob with a
questioning look. The young navigator winced as he took out his
notebook and hurriedly checked his previous calculations.</p>

<p>"We were in latitude 28&deg; 24&acute; 7&acute;&acute; at noon
to-day," he said quietly; "that should make us about seven miles
only from the location of Fortunate Spring, allowing we made five
miles since lunch."</p>

<p>"But the longitude, Bob?" asked Mackay. "How do we stand for
that?"</p>

<p>Bob again examined his log-book. "I have it marked at 125&deg;
11&acute; 17&acute;&acute;," he answered, "but we came a good bit
easterly since that. I'll try it again in the morning, though I
think we're almost on the correct line now, and should hit the
Spring by going due north."</p>

<p>He handed the book to Mackay, who glanced at the figures and
mentally checked the simpler calculations, but he did not ask for
Bob's table of logarithms, and the young man felt satisfied. Bob,
indeed, was sure of his positions; they had been worked out with
painful exactitude, but he could not help feeling anxious about the
morrow. The country in the vicinity seemed so utterly arid and
barren. Could the original figures he received be correct? Might
not possibly some mistake have crept into Bentley's estimates? He
shuddered at the thought, then was immediately sorry for the
passing doubt. Who was he who dared question the accuracy of an old
and tried explorer's chart? Yet Bob went to sleep that night
feeling vaguely uneasy, and by early sunrise he was up taking
altitudes, Jack and the Shadow attending him to mark the time of
his observations. It was nearly nine o'clock before they were ready
to move out that morning; the camels had for a long time refused to
be loaded, and when loaded they could not be prevailed upon to
arise to their feet, until forced to do so by the necessarily cruel
expedient of lighting fires under their noses.</p>

<p>"That's nothing, Jack," Mackay said with a laugh, for he had
noticed the look of pain on the boy's face. "They get up long
before they're hurt; their hide is like leather, you know, and
camels are vera often stubborn and annoying when there's really no
occasion for it."</p>

<p>But he knew well that the poor animals were not refractory
without reason on this morning, though he endeavoured to make light
of the fact. Wearily the heavily laden beasts trudged along, and
when the first hour passed, and the sand showed signs of hardening,
the Shadow made a valiant effort to infuse life into their hulking
movements by blowing at his long-unused mouth-organ vociferously,
and making the air resound with discordant notes, for his cracked
lips could ill glide along the reeds with any degree of certainty.
Bob, who was striding along well in advance, smiled as he heard the
concert thus let loose, and he smiled the more when the dismal
voices of Emu Bill and Never Never Dave were added to the chorus;
and, looking back, he observed these two worthies prancing on with
martial steps, though certainly not with martial grace, for their
bodies were bent as they pulled their reluctant charges onwards,
and their feet, notwithstanding their jaunty uplifting, went down
almost in the same place. And Mackay, looking back at the
perspiring musician, nodded encouragingly, much to that alert
youth's amazement, for he had expected but a rude check as a reward
for his labours. Not only did he thus ostensibly appreciate the
lively music, but he joined in with his comrades lustily in their
vocal exercises; and in this way the labouring train progressed,
and almost unnoticeably a thin, straggling array of mallee and
mulga shrubs began to dot the hardening sand surface, a slight dip
in the land had obscured them from earlier view. By eleven o'clock
the sand had merged into the longed-for iron-pebble strewn plains,
and now the scrub was comparatively abundant all around, and the
tough, wiry grasses which the camels loved appeared in greater
profusion. Yet no signs of Fortunate Spring.</p>

<p>"It can't be far off now," said Bob, hopefully. "I'd better fix
our position again before we go further, in case we might pass
it."</p>

<p>"And that would be easily done, my lad," spoke Mackay. "I
remember well that the water was in a mallee flat, just scrubby
country like this, but there was no kind o' landmark except a
fair-sized lime tree which grew beside it, an' I canna see any lime
trees about here."</p>

<p>"I'll have another shot at the sun," decided Bob, and at once
the team came to a halt, while Jack hastily unstrapped the sextant
and chronometer from Misery's back.</p>

<p>A few minutes more and Bob had worked out the necessary
calculation.</p>

<p>"Try again, Bob; try again," urged Mackay.</p>

<p>With sinking heart Bob once more levelled his sextant; the
horizon was easily discernible through the scraggy bush, and the
flat itself was level as could be.</p>

<p>"I find the latitude reading correct," he repeated, with
bloodless lips; "and the longitude," he added, after a pause, "is
the same as it was this morning, the same as is marked on my chart
over the location of the Spring."</p>

<p>"We'll soon find it, if it is near abouts," cried Emu Bill,
cheerily. "Don't fret, Bob, them springs have a habit of getting
lost at times. Come on, Never Never, come an' help me to smell it
out wi' that tender nose o' yours."</p>

<p>And they rushed off into the bush towards the west. The Shadow
and Jack started to follow, but Mackay recalled them.</p>

<p>"You two had better look around due north," he said, "and I'll
tackle the east myself. Now don't go further than a mile, an'
signal wi' a revolver-shot if ye find anything."</p>

<p>Without a word they departed on their quest, and Mackay and Bob
were left alone. Calmly the elder man interrogated the lad, who was
standing in an attitude of deepest dejection, the sextant hanging
loosely in his hand.</p>

<p>"And is there no room for a mistake in any o' your figures,
Bob?"</p>

<p>"None, none, that I can imagine. I have been particularly
careful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bob could not finish his sentence, a flood of emotion swept over
him, and he sat down in the sand and covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p>"Why, my laddie, ye mustn't blame yoursel' for no error o'
yours," spoke Mackay, kindly, gazing at the despondent youth with a
strange light in his keen grey eyes. "Brace yoursel' up, Bob; we'll
likely find the spring at no great distance, an' if we don't,
well&mdash;we'll look for another one if the camels stand by
us."</p>

<p>He hurried away into the eastward scrub. Bob arose and gazed
after him with quivering eyelids.</p>

<p>"Yes," he murmured brokenly, "I have brought you all to your
death, and I can do nothing now to save...I know the error is not
mine, but I cannot and will not blame a dead man...I wonder what
can possibly be wrong."</p>

<p>He shook his head in utter hopelessness, then he glanced at the
sextant, lying as he had left it, half buried in the sand. He took
it up and brushed the silvered arc carefully with the ragged sleeve
of his shirt, and was preparing to place it in its case when a new
idea seemed to strike him. He grasped the instrument with a firmer
grip and stood erect, a new light, a light of gladness shining in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"It's strange I never thought of it before," he said aloud; "a
minute or two either way would make all the difference." He picked
up the chronometer, which lay idly at his feet, and examined it
critically. "It's just possible," he muttered, "the jolting of the
camel may have made it go a bit fast; I wonder if I can check it. I
am going to try."</p>

<p>Long and eagerly he gazed at the sun through the powerful
telescope of the sextant, and every now and then he would note down
his observations, and consult the Nautical Almanac which lay open
before him. In the midst of these proceedings, Emu Bill and Never
Never Dave returned, after a fruitless search, and while they stood
watching him, Jack and the Shadow also made their appearance, and
lined up beside the other two in solemn silence. There was no need
to ask them if they had been successful, their faces plainly
indicated disappointment, though they both strove hard to hide
their feelings. As for the first arrivals, their rugged
countenances betrayed not the slightest trace of emotion. Bill
calmly chewed a quid of tobacco, and Dave reflectively pulled at
his pipe. To them it did not seem to be a matter of much moment
whether they found the spring or not. At length Bob threw down the
sextant with a weary sigh.</p>

<p>"The chronometer is right," said he, sadly; then, as his
comrades looked at him questioningly, he faltered: "I've done my
best, boys...the fault may not be altogether mine, but...I am
responsible to you.... What can you think of me&mdash;&mdash;?" He
gave way completely.</p>

<p>Then out spoke Emu Bill, and his voice rang firm and
true&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shoot me fur a dingo if I'll listen to you miscallin' yourself,
Bob. You has shown us afore what ye were made o', an' hang me for a
cross-eyed Chinese if I'll believe you've made the mistake."</p>

<p>"I'm right with ye thar, Bill," grunted Never Never.</p>

<p>Bob looked at them in silent gratitude that was more potent than
words.</p>

<p>"Blow me!" blurted out the Shadow, "this ain't no funeral
circus." He strode aside and examined the canvas bags overlapping
Remorse's tough hide; they were flat and empty, the last drop had
gone. He rejoined the little circle quietly, and held out his hand
to Bob, who was gazing with unseeing eyes into the horizon. "I
knows it ain't your fault," he said simply.</p>

<p>Jack alone had not spoken, but Bob knew his comrade's thoughts;
he knew the loyal courage and devotion of the boy's heart.</p>

<p>And all this time Mackay had not come back, nor had any welcome
signal been heard. Bob commenced to fear that he would not come
back unless he had something to report.</p>

<p>"What did ye mean by sayin' the chronometer was right, Bob?"
asked Emu Bill, suddenly.</p>

<p>"If it had gone fast or slow, my longitude, which I calculated
by it, would have been out accordingly," replied Bob, listlessly.
"I thought the jolting might have affected it."</p>

<p>"Why then," returned Bill, "ain't it more likely that Bentley's
time was wrong? If he came in from the west across the whole darned
stretch o' sand-ridges, I reckon he would bust things up a
bit."</p>

<p>Bob was startled into fresh energy. "Of course, you're right,
Bill!" he cried excitedly. "I've been so anxiously looking for a
possible error in my own instrument, I never thought of it
occurring with Bentley's. I believe you've hit the solution of the
whole difficulty. We'll find Fortunate Spring due east of us in
that case, for his latitude would be sure to be right."</p>

<p>"We'll get under way at oncet then," grunted Never Never Dave.
"We're bound to meet Mackay comin' back."</p>

<p>At once Jack rushed to Misery's head, and the others hastened to
their posts. Bob picked up the sextant and chronometer, and with a
surging hope in his heart led the way in the direction that Mackay
had taken. Slowly, slowly, they broke through the scrub, Misery's
bell sending out its melancholy note, and shattering the oppressive
stillness which had prevailed but a few minutes before. Onward they
went and onward, and yet no sign of Mackay, and no sign of a spring
to gladden their weary eyes. About two miles had been traversed,
and the spirits of the forlorn party were drooping fast, when from
the bush but a few hundred yards ahead a revolver shot boomed out
loudly. With one accord the camels stopped dead. They seemed to
realize that something was about to happen. Again came the sonorous
echoes of an exploding cartridge, and a hoarse cheer burst from the
eagerly listening quartet.</p>

<p>"Mackay has found it! Hurrah! Hurrah!" roared the Shadow, and
with renewed effort a path was forced on towards the origin of the
welcome sound. Five minutes more and they broke into a rough
clearing in the bush in the centre of which a tall lime tree reared
high above its dwarfed surroundings; and seated by the tree gazing
at some rude markings that showed faintly on the gaunt white trunk,
was Mackay. At his feet, sunk among the spreading roots, and half
hidden by enclustering grassy growths, gleamed the water of the
spring. Bob gave a gasp of relief and thankfulness. Emu Bill and
Never Never Dave calmly began to unload the camels, the Shadow
after vainly trying to find his speech, mechanically pulled out his
musical instrument, and sought to indicate his joy thereon.</p>

<p>Then Mackay arose to his feet, "Dinna desecrate the place,
Shadow," said he, in gentle reproach. "Remember this is a monument
to the dead."</p>

<p>He motioned Bob and Jack to come forward and view the mossy
inscription on the tree, and silently they obeyed his summons. Deep
graven in the wood was the legend: "Fortunate Spring, 1898.
Bentley's Expedition. Lat. 28&deg; 17&acute; 5&acute;&acute;, long.
125&deg; 19&acute; 6&acute;&acute; (Dead Reck.) Course E." Then
followed a list of the initials of the party headed by those of
Mackay: "J. M."</p>

<p>By this time Emu Bill, Never Never Dave, and the Shadow had also
gathered round to view the symbols left by Mackay's old leader, and
as each man traced out the lettering for himself, he doffed his
tattered hat reverently.</p>

<p>"Ay, boys," spoke Mackay, breaking the solemn hush that reigned,
"it was a fortunate spring for us then, and it's a fortunate spring
for this expedition now. But how did you manage to come straight
for it, Bob? It took me a good time zig-zagging through the bush
before I sighted the tree."</p>

<p>In a few words the young navigator explained the cause of their
coming, then he pointed to the inscription "Dead Reck." "That shows
that Bentley did not think his readings altogether accurate," he
said gravely, "and he meant it as a warning to others, though why
he didn't put it on his chart is strange to me."</p>

<p>Mackay looked at the speaker with a troubled countenance.</p>

<p>"It's been my fault, Bob. When I copied the figures into my own
book I didna think it necessary to put the qualification down."</p>

<p>"I wants to say here," interjected Emu Bill, "that in my humble
opinion Bob can steer a course wi' any man, an' my ole carcase is
here to prove it. A hundred an' eighty miles he's took us across
the miserablest country on God's earth, an' nary time has I heard
him grumble."</p>

<p>"I goes nap on Bob every time," concurred Never Never.</p>

<p>A light of real happiness overspread Mackay's bronzed
features.</p>

<p>"What more can you ask, Bob?" he said earnestly, "than the
testimony o' the pioneer, wha' lends his life to your
guidance."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Fortunate Spring!" shouted Jack, unable to contain
himself longer.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" roared the answering chorus.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch12"></a>Chapter 12. A Night Attack</h2>

<p>They lingered for two days by Fortunate Spring in order to give
the camels a much-needed rest, then they proceeded on their march,
now steering due east, and it was strange indeed how this altered
course affected the spirits of the party. They seemed to feel that
they were at last on the straight track towards the mystic land of
their desire. Mackay even more than the others showed the change in
his feelings; he whistled joyously in the exuberance of his heart,
and cheered on the labouring team with hearty words of praise. And
Bob, relieved considerably of his own vague doubts in himself, had
changed apparently into a new being. The vagaries of the Shadow
called forth his amusement, and the dry wordy dialogues of the two
bushmen never failed to make him laugh with keenest appreciation, a
fact which endeared him much to that valiant couple. The freedom of
the mighty desert held him in thrall, its dangers were forgotten,
the call of the wild was in his ears, the secret of the Never Never
beckoned him.</p>

<p>"I told you the sunny skies would alter your temperament," said
Jack, whose boisterous good nature had never once deserted him. "I
don't think a man gets a fair show in the constantly cloudy weather
at home."</p>

<p>"And yet we always get back to the old country somehow,"
answered Bob, thoughtfully. "I suppose its grand history attracts
us when the greater world has palled. I believe I could almost live
in history, Jack, wandering about among the castles and cathedrals
that have seen the centuries pass. What wonderful records the grim
old walls hold. Why, each stone would seem alive to me."</p>

<p>"It would be pleasant to have a big holiday at home," admitted
Jack, wistfully; "but our time&mdash;and means, for travelling
about was pretty limited when we were there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that will never be again," cried Bob, gaily; "just consider
what we have already got in this country, and who knows what may
await us out where we are going?"</p>

<p>Who knew indeed? Who ever knows what lies in the dim distance of
untrodden tracts? The days passed quickly, though the country
continued to be barren and cheerless in aspect, the difficulties of
travel were not nearly what they had been on the first long weary
stretch. More than once a soak was discovered to replenish the
water-bags before they had yet gone dry, and within a week two new
wells had been charted. They were little more than the muddy
residues of a long previous rainfall, still, the dignity of a
Central Australian well as a rule lies wholly in its title, a fact
which is well enough known to all explorers.</p>

<p>So successful were they in their journeying that after ten days
had elapsed, and they were a hundred and forty miles east of
Fortunate Spring, Mackay considered that a brief deviation to the
north might be ventured upon on the off chance of evading a long
dry stretch which at this stage intervened on Bentley's route, the
next and final spring charted by that explorer being over seventy
miles distant.</p>

<p>"We had a terribly hard time on that journey," said he, as he
gazed across the wavy expanse of shifting sands which spread before
them, "an' it's just possible the country to the north'ard a bit
may be better. It canna be much worse."</p>

<p>For a long time, however, the varied route showed little
prospect of improvement; sand, sand, everlasting sand spread
everywhere before them, and progress became dangerously slow. The
camels struggled in vain to make headway; they sank and floundered
and stumbled in the wreathing masses. In five days the distance
covered totalled only forty miles. No wonder Mackay looked grave as
he noticed the water-bags' woefully flat appearance.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, boys," burst out Emu Bill, during their
noonday halt, "it's mighty sartain we has struck a snag this time.
This is the miserablest patch&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off abruptly
and fell to abusing the flies besieging his face with remarkable
eloquence. No one seemed disposed to question Bill's statement in
any way, and shortly afterwards the march was renewed, Bill, Never
Never, and the Shadow alternately lauding the striving camels for
their patient endurance, and bestowing maledictions upon them for
their ponderously slow onward movement.</p>

<p>Hour after hour the melancholy procession laboured along. So
soon had the grimmer influence of the country exerted its baleful
spell that for a long time each man feared to speak lest he might
betray the growing depression at his heart. Then, just as the
evening shadows were beginning to close in, a welcome break in the
monotonous landscape appeared to gladden their straining eyes. In
the faint distance a feathery line of scrub stretched across their
path, indicating a decided change in the sand surface, and the
sight added vigour to their failing steps. Eagerly they strove to
reach the inviting mallee coppice before the thick blackness of
night came down to envelop them. But it was not to be; the
stumbling gait of the camels could not be hastened, though Emu Bill
and his compatriots implored and beseeched the hardy animals with
an eloquence that was touching to hear.</p>

<p>"One more try, boys," cried Mackay. "There's bound to be water
somewhere among the timber, and we may save ourselves another night
of misery by finding it now." He went to Jack's assistance, and
together they tugged at the leading camel's nose-rope until the
poor brute was literally being dragged through the yielding sands.
This method of progression not proving very satisfactory, he next
made laudable endeavour to enliven the march by singing raucously a
few bars from that old song, "The Campbells are Coming."</p>

<p>"I just reckon they are comin'," Never Never Dave groaned,
somewhat confusing the reference; "but they need a jolly lot of
persuasion, they do. Get up, Repentance, you cross-eyed streak o'
misery. Didn't I give ye a drink last week?"</p>

<p>At length Mackay saw that they must be content to halt in the
open for one night more.</p>

<p>"We can't do it, boys," he said, "so let us look for a decent
camping-space in the sand; we'll find water if there's any about in
the morning."</p>

<p>They had barely time to gather a few twigs from the sparse brush
now in evidence, and start a feeble fire, before an impenetrable
darkness descended over the desert. Then they busied themselves
unloading the camels and preparing their frugal meal, the latter an
operation which rarely occupied much time, for obvious reasons.
They were indeed in a very deplorable plight at this period; the
water-bags had given up much of their store by evaporation, and
they now contained but a very meagre supply of the valuable liquid,
and the camels were well-nigh dying on their feet from sheer
exhaustion.</p>

<p>The hour was quite late, and they were about to roll themselves
in their blankets, when suddenly a bright light flamed up luridly
among the trees in their course, and harshly through the still air
rose the strains of a native chant.</p>

<p>"By the Great Howlin' Billy!" growled Never Never Dave, "there's
a corroborree on to-night. It's mighty lucky we didn't reach the
timber, after all."</p>

<p>"If there's any nigs about there's bound to be water," asserted
the Shadow, with a chuckle of delight, and certainly his reasoning
was sound.</p>

<p>Higher and higher blazed the warning beacon, and louder and
louder sounded the warriors' dismal wailings, and through the
leafless branches of the eucalypti a wildly dancing band of
ape-like figures could be distinguished. The little group gazed at
the ominous spectacle in silence and with mingled feelings. The
presence of a native tribe in the neighbourhood was conclusive
proof that an ample water supply was not far off; indeed the
aborigines of the Interior almost invariably hold their corroborree
ceremonials around the principal spring of the district, for
according to their belief a mighty spirit has its abode in every
desert pool or soak, and from the slimy depths thereof watches over
the welfare of his people. But when ought displeases this dread
"Wangul"&mdash;the great Dweller in the Waters&mdash;he visits his
wrath upon the land by drying up the springs and betaking himself
elsewhere. It is a wonderfully convenient idea, for it explains
away all droughts and following pestilences, and it appeals to the
simple heathen instinct as no finer teachings could. To propitiate
this god of theirs many ordinances are performed and numerous
sacrifices offered, and should any wandering members of an alien
tribe happen to be near on such occasions, they are promptly seized
upon to occupy the unenviable position of "Corroborree mourners," a
post which entails death, preceded by much horrible suffering.</p>

<p>Mackay was mentally recalling his various experiences with the
natives in different parts of the country, and with little sense of
comfort, when Emu Bill disturbed his musings by saying
suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wonder what the howling celebration means to-night,
anyway?"</p>

<p>The others had by this time gone to sleep, having been utterly
worn out by their trying day's encounter with the desert, and these
two sat alone by the dying fire.</p>

<p>"I'm just a wee bit afraid, Bill," answered Mackay, dubiously,
"that it has some bearing on our arrival. I never did like to be
near the murderous pests in the nighttime."</p>

<p>Bill stirred about uneasily, and it was clear that he shared
Mackay's fears.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right," he said, after a moment's pause. "The
skunks must have seen us a long way off."</p>

<p>He relapsed into a gloomy silence, and began to draw with great
care sundry diagrams in the sand with the improvised camp
poker.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the whirling figures in the wood continued their mad
career, and the flames from the great fire in their midst spouted
high above the motionless mallee tips. The myriad stars twinkled
merrily in an unclouded sky, and the Southern Cross constellation
shone out brilliantly almost directly overhead. A slender crescent
moon just above the horizon lent its feeble halo to the scene, so
that a vague, eerie half light seemed to float on the surface of
the land. Faster and still faster the maddened Wangul worshippers
rushed, and the night was filled with their harsh, unmusical
ravings.</p>

<p>Mackay watched the progress of events with quickening interest,
while Emu Bill with many a muttered malediction examined the
charges in his revolver, and smoked reflectively. Mackay was very
unwilling to awake the sleepers unless it were absolutely
necessary; they needed all the rest they could get. But Emu Bill
recalled him to a sense of duty.</p>

<p>"I've been watching the circus," he said quietly, "an' I can see
nary mourner in the crowd. For a dead cert they'll be comin' fur us
when they've worked up enough enthusiasm. They'll imagine us to be
asleep by now."</p>

<p>Mackay got up without a word, and shook Bob and Jack back to
consciousness. Never Never Dave was alert on the instant, but the
Shadow slumbered deeply and refused to be awakened, whereupon Emu
Bill aroused him by rolling him rudely out of his blanket, a
proceeding which almost created a civil war on the spot.</p>

<p>"You has no right to dislocate my sweet dreams in such a dingo
fashion," the bellicose Shadow protested grumpily; but when he
understood the seriousness of the position his wrath dissolved
speedily. "At the same time I reckon you is a bit too much skeert
about the antics o' them muskitties," he remarked chidingly. "I was
having a daisy dream, I was; flooded rivers an' gold an' di'monds,
an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut it off, Shad," unsympathetically interrupted the object of
his disapproval. "They're on our track now. Look!"</p>

<p>The corroborree fire continued to blaze up vividly, and the
watchers could see numerous naked savages piling on the logs and
dancing amid the showering sparks like denizens of the nether
world. The circling mass of grotesquely garbed warriors had broken
up in apparent confusion, but quickly they again came into view and
re-formed on the edge of the zone of illumination, then spreading
fan-like to north and south, they came slowly yet steadily towards
the supposed sleeping camp. A moment more and they were hidden from
view in the intervening shadows.</p>

<p>"Things are beginning to look lively," said Bob, adjusting his
cartridge-belt.</p>

<p>Jack ranged himself quietly by his comrade's side, his rifle
gripped in readiness.</p>

<p>"I don't know how this is going to turn out, Bob," he said
slowly; "but I mean to shoot straight, to-night."</p>

<p>"It's a case o' self preservation, my lad," warned Mackay; and
he closed the breech of his powerful weapon with a vicious snap.
"You needna think o' usin' the stock o' your gun in this scrimmage.
I am just afraid it's goin' to be more serious than I thought."</p>

<p>There could be little doubt as to the meaning of the wily
natives' tactics. Assuredly they intended to surround the little
camp, which they considered to be safely asleep, and spear the
party at their leisure.</p>

<p>"We are to be their sacrificial offerings, apparently," remarked
Bob, with forced calm.</p>

<p>Mackay was aroused to a sudden burst of fury at the words; his
long-smouldering anger against the natives effervesced to an
alarming pitch.</p>

<p>"I'll give them sacrifices," he grated, peering into the
darkness with eyes that seemed like glowing coals of fire over the
gleaming barrel of his rifle. "I'll make them think an earthquake
has broken loose in their midst. I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Indignation choked his fiery utterance, and he said no more, but
toyed lingeringly with the trigger of his gun.</p>

<p>A minute elapsed, it seemed an eternity, but no signs of the
enemy could yet be traced. Instinctively Bob's eyes returned to the
recent centre of affairs where the impish fire feeders were heaping
on the logs with frantic glee, and he shuddered involuntarily. The
suspense was rapidly becoming unbearable, and the little band
expected every moment to be overwhelmed with flying spears from
some unlooked-for corner. Each pigmy bush around to their
overstrained vision took on the appearance of a crouching warrior,
and it was with the exercise of great restraint that Mackay and his
comrades refrained from firing at random into the night. Slowly the
seconds dragged their weary course, then all at once a weird
unearthly chorus reached the ears of the anxiously waiting group;
it seemed to come from everywhere around, and they turned about in
dismay. The attacking horde were closing in on them from all points
of the compass. Only when the ring had been completed had they
begun their deadly advance. Neither Mackay nor any of them had
expected this.</p>

<p>"I reckon we is bested, mates," groaned Emu Bill, helplessly;
and it certainly did seem as if he spoke truly.</p>

<p>Another minute elapsed, then they grounded their arms in
impotent rage; the swelling chant from an unknown number of throats
was drawing insidiously nearer, and they could only roughly guess
the various origins of sound. Mackay turned to Jack to give a last
word of encouragement, and he was surprised to find the boy
standing by Bob's side in an attitude of acute attention&mdash;his
head was bent forward, and he shielded his ear with his hand as if
he were listening intently.</p>

<p>"I've got them," he whispered eagerly. "Unless there's a dummy
musician in their ranks, there's a fifty yards' blank in the circle
straight out by the camel packs."</p>

<p>"How many do you make altogether, Jack?" inquired Mackay.</p>

<p>The boy replied promptly, "They seem to be about thirty yards or
so apart. They are nearly two hundred yards off now, and coming
very slowly. There must be nearly fifty of the beasts."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Jack," murmured Mackay, heartily, a tribute of
praise which even at that moment Emu Bill and the Shadow echoed
with characteristic vehemence.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost, the fateful ring was closing every
instant; so, gripping his rifle tightly, the leader of the
expedition made a course out in the direction as indicated by Jack,
his comrades following after in Indian file. And as they passed out
by the camels, each man breathed a prayer for their safety; then,
with the hideous voices of the approaching warriors ringing in
their ears, they made their way stealthily out through the saving
gap into the freedom beyond.</p>

<p>Surely never before had a course been steered by such odd
reckoning, yet the droning cries on either side of the escaping
party as they neared the edge of the invisible circle guided them
as well as glaring beacons would have done, and they
man&oelig;uvred cautiously through the midst of the fervently
singing band, luckily escaping all observation.</p>

<p>"It was like navigatin' through the Heads of Sydney Harbour,"
exclaimed Emu Bill, flinging himself down on the sand immediately
they had cleared the dangerous line.</p>

<p>"We've got to thank our stars the beggars have the good sense to
say grace before supper," said Jack, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"We are no' just altogether out o' the difficulty yet," warned
Mackay. "They'll be back with a rush when they find out their
mistake."</p>

<p>"But you ain't goin' to let them run the whole circus, surely?"
complained Emu Bill. "Let's pepper the howlin' dervishes now."</p>

<p>Mackay seemed to hesitate for a moment, the odds in numbers were
greatly against them.</p>

<p>"Train your guns on the old camp, boys," he said quietly.
"You'll see their black bodies against the glow o' the ashes when
they get nearer." He had scarcely spoken these words when the
dismal chant of the over-sanguine natives ceased, and with blood
curdling yells the savage horde swept on to their supposed work of
extermination. The onlookers saw a perfect hail of spears strike
and quiver amid the smouldering ashes; then a fantastical array of
fiend-like forms swarmed before their eyes, and prolonged shrieks
of baffled rage rent the air. Now was their opportunity. "Fire,
boys!" cried Mackay, himself setting the example; and the
death-dealing weapons thundered out their grim challenge to the
foe. When they looked again only a fiercely struggling mass of
black humanity was visible, and the scattering sparks showed where
the shots had taken effect. Once more a well-directed volley was
poured into the surging crowd; but this time the flash of the
rifles betrayed their presence, and immediately about a dozen gaunt
apparitions charged down on the little party with vengeful shouts.
It looked as if nothing could stand against that maddened rush. In
vain the rifles spoke, the members of the attacking band seemed in
no wise to diminish, their figures could only be vaguely traced in
the gloom.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"It looked as if nothing could stand against
that maddened rush"</p>

<p>"Keep easy, lads; keep easy," said Mackay, encouragingly. "Load
up your magazines, an' reserve every bullet until they are close on
to us. We can't miss them then, and it's our only hope of stopping
them."</p>

<p>Bob, plying his almost red-hot rifle, checked himself at the
words, and calmly obeyed the instructions given; Jack, panting
furiously with his extreme exertions, grounded his loaded weapon
and waited with something like a gnawing despair at his heart. The
Shadow grumbled incoherently to himself, Emu Bill and Never Never
Dave said not a word, but stood erect, calm, and motionless beside
Mackay, awaiting the shock. Then a strange thing happened; while
the demoralized natives around the vacated camp kept up their
frenzied rushing hither and thither, seeking aimlessly their hidden
enemy, the four camels of the expedition, aroused by the unusual
sounds prevailing, stalked slowly forward into the thick of the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, and there they stood, their long necks swaying
curiously, like fearsome spectres from an unknown world. A howl of
terror burst from the group who had located the position of the
defenders, they ceased their onward course, hesitated for a moment,
then turned and fled precipitately, an example which the rest of
their stricken brethren speedily thought fit to copy; and before
Mackay or any of his companions could realize what had happened,
the entire assembly were in full retreat, leaving the bulk of their
spears and boomerangs littered on the sand.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Misery!" applauded Jack, running forward, and the
leader of the team, hearing the well-known voice, staggered to meet
him and knelt at his feet.</p>

<p>"I reckon we owes them animiles the price o' our carcases," said
Never Never Dave, sententiously, as they walked quietly back to the
deserted camp-fire. They found their blankets lying as they had
left them, but transfixed with numberless spears, and after
carefully extracting these crude yet deadly missiles they
replenished the fire with them, and lay down to rest beside the
ruddy glow, for it was now early morning, and the air had become
unpleasantly chill. The corroborree beacon had been deserted, only
occasional scattering sparks showing where the strange ceremonial
had taken place, and away in the distance the vague crackling of
branches indicated that the would-be annihilators of the camp were
already far from reach.</p>

<p>"Great Centipedes! That was a close shave," growled Emu Bill,
before he dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>"But we have the advantage of knowing," returned Bob, with his
usual calm philosophy, "that we shall find water near where the
beggars held their odd orgy, and that should recompense for much."
Then his eyes closed in slumber, and he entered a realm of
phantasies where hostile aborigines and dreary salt plains were
alike unknown. The weary strain of the night was over.</p>

<p>They found water after daybreak as they had anticipated. It was
contained in a deep sunken rock-hole with an almost unfathomable
bottom, wherein one might well fancy some dread monster to exist.
They refilled the empty water-bags with thankful hearts, and,
fearing another attack in force that night, renewed their march
early in the afternoon. It was soon apparent that a better country
had now been reached; dry it was certainly, yet the soil showed a
considerable improvement over that already traversed, and the scrub
became almost continuous instead of in sparse and far-divided belts
as formerly. But though all promised well for an unusually
favourable journey that day and for many days to come, the presence
of hostile bands of aborigines all along the route of travel was
too evident a feature of the landscape to be overlooked, and the
team had perforce to move onwards warily.</p>

<p>"I do hope," said Mackay, as the evening approached, "that the
blacks will give us a rest to-night. There's more risk in these
scrimmages at close quarters than is healthy."</p>

<p>Bob had arrived at that conclusion some time before. "We're not
more than fifty miles from the location you gave me of Bentley's
last camp," he observed gravely. "If I shift the course slightly to
the south to-morrow we ought to be up at it in three days."</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed Mackay's face. "Ay, my lad, we'll need
to be extra cautious now," he said meaningly. "We mustna allow
oursel's to be wiped out before we come to the mountain. I've got a
bit of a score to settle in that quarter."</p>

<p>The sun was now but a few points above the western horizon, and
his fiery radiance bathed the great silent bushland in golden
splendour. The motionless mulga and mallee shrubs seemed ablaze
with ruddy light, and the wastes of sand shone as a sea of
burnished bronze. Not a sound was heard save the harsh cries of the
gaily plumaged parrots that flitted eerily from tree to tree, and
the occasional dismal monotone of the mopoke. Then suddenly from
the shadow of a thicker clump of timber than usual a series of
yells rang out, and at the same time a shower of spears whizzed
overhead, and perilously close. Each member of the little group
realized in an instant what had happened, and seized his rifle.</p>

<p>"Get the camels under cover, boys!" cried Mackay, from his
position well ahead of the main party.</p>

<p>"There's nary bit o' cover!" roared back Emu Bill, who had
diplomatically stretched himself flat on the ground at the first
alarm. Whiz! splash! Even as he spoke a long quivering missile
rushed through the shadeless branches and penetrated the great
water-bag overlapping Remorse's flank. The stout canvas resisted
the shock sufficiently to save the animal from injury, but the
precious and dearly-hoarded contents gushed from the rent created
in a copious flood. A cry of horror broke from Bob, Jack uttered a
wail of anguish, and an expression of much fervour issued from
Never Never Dave's mouth. With a bound Mackay rushed forward in
vain attempt to save the few remaining drops, but it was not to be;
before they had time to realize the seriousness of their loss the
gurgling stream had ceased; the canvas skin had given up its
store.</p>

<p>"I'll pulverize the hyena that did it!" howled the Shadow,
dashing forward through the scrub.</p>

<p>"I'm with you," cried Jack, following closely at his heels.</p>

<p>It all happened so quickly that Mackay had no time to give any
directions or restrain the indignant pair. Several further flights
of spears skimmed well overhead, and one or two barbed darts more
surely aimed, whistled dangerously near to Mackay's head.</p>

<p>"This is gettin' mighty monotonous," growled Emu Bill, looking
around impotently, for as yet not a single savage was to be
seen.</p>

<p>"There must be water in the district," said Bob, coolly,
examining his revolver. "I suppose we've got to go on the hunt
again." Without further remark he turned and rushed after his
companions, whose vehement shouts as they charged along were
mingled with the shrill cries of the dusky warriors. "Try and catch
one, Shadow," he loudly shouted as he ran.</p>

<p>Fearful that disaster might overtake the entire party, Mackay
gripped his rifle and hurried after them, leaving Emu Bill and
Never Never Dave in charge of the team, a position which they
condemned bitterly at such a time. The shadows of night were fast
closing in, and between the trees of the pigmy forest a heavy gloom
had settled providing excellent cover for the blacks should they
have decided to renew the attack; but these strange creatures,
having discharged their weapons, were now beating a retreat,
yelling most hideously the while.</p>

<p>Scarcely fifty yards before him Mackay could dimly descry Jack,
the Shadow, and Bob leaping on after the fugitives, and he
quickened his pace in order to come up with them.</p>

<p>"We'll catch a specimen," cried Bob, eagerly, "if we have to
chase them all night."</p>

<p>On they raced, while the crackling branches a little way ahead
betokened the nearness of their quarry, whose shrieks alone would
have been an unerring guide. Evidently the fleeing warriors were
just as tired as their pursuers, for they were gradually losing
ground. Suddenly one of their number screeched out some sort of
signal which had the effect of making the runners scatter in all
directions. Bob could just see their shaggy heads above the bushes
as they diverged on various tacks; then the new order of things
confused them all, and one by one the gorilla-like figures vanished
from their view. Yet still they kept up the race, loth to return
without some satisfaction. The night was rapidly darkening,
obscuring the scrub and intervening sand wastes in a common pall,
so that progress was made only with great difficulty, and wearily
the aimless search was continued.</p>

<p>"We'll have to turn, boys," said Mackay, at length, when the
stars commenced to glimmer in the heavens. "We must go back to the
camels. To-morrow we'll have a look round for water. And to think
that we had any amount of it this morning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A hearty exclamation from the Shadow interrupted him. They were
passing under an unusually large lime tree, and that youthful
individual had halted with an unrestrained roar of mingled
merriment and relief. Looking up against the stars Mackay could see
an awkward figure scrambling frantically among the higher
branches.</p>

<p>"Treed! By Jove!" cried Bob, gazing upwards also.</p>

<p>"I reckoned I smelt nigger," said the Shadow, when he had
recovered his equanimity; "but if his long legs hadn't banged me on
the cocoa-nut, I'd never ha' thought o' lookin' in the tree for the
skunk."</p>

<p>"And now comes the job o' gettin' him down," said Mackay. "An'
it won't be an easy contract either, judgin' by the way he hangs on
to the branches."</p>

<p>"The Shadow and I will soon attend to him," said Jack, with a
laugh; and without further ado he commenced to swarm up the small
round trunk of the tree.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Jack," warned Mackay. "He may smash your head
before you reach him."</p>

<p>"Will he, though?" growled the active climber, already half-way
up.</p>

<p>"Strategy's the word, Jack," councilled the Shadow, as he
prepared to ascend to his companion's assistance. The lithe tree
swayed under its load, then bent until its lower limbs reached the
ground.</p>

<p>"We'd better see that our prisoner doesn't make his escape by
jumping for it," remarked Bob, and he and Mackay therefore stood at
opposite sides of the tree, watching the huddled form with alert
eyes. Nearer and nearer Jack writhed his way to the top, and slowly
the terrified aboriginal retreated to the farthest limit of the
branch on which he rested, until it cracked ominously.</p>

<p>"I guess I've got you now," muttered Jack. "You just wait till I
come to you."</p>

<p>But the shivering savage had no such intention; and as Jack
approached he began to scream horribly, more after the manner of a
wild beast than a human being. Then he broke off bits of the lesser
branches and twigs, and showered them down on his implacable
enemy.</p>

<p>"Just shake him off the branch an' I'll catch him," advised the
Shadow, worming his sinewy form along the limb directly underneath
his prey.</p>

<p>In vain Jack endeavoured to grasp his prospective prisoner, the
oily native eluded him every time, and sorely tried the persistent
besieger's temper by keeping up a vicious fusillade of wood
fragments. He had, however, completely overlooked the presence of
the Shadow directly below, and when in the midst of a furious
assault, his foot slipped slightly, it was instantly seized by that
watchful gentleman, and held in a ruthless grip.</p>

<p>"Now, I reckon you've got to come," said he, evading the free
limb's onslaught with much dexterity. "Now! Stand from under,
boys!"</p>

<p>Crash! They came down all three together, the top branch having
broken with the strain, but the height was not very great, and the
sand below was loosely packed.</p>

<p>"It's a jolly good thing," quoth the Shadow, "that the black
beggar was so nice and soft; it was just like bouncing on top o' a
cushion, it was."</p>

<p>Jack did not appear to be particularly grateful for anything as
he picked himself up, but he very promptly took an arm of the
captive along with the Shadow.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right; take care of your prisoner now that you've
got him," said Mackay, turning to lead the way back to the spot
where the camel team had been left. "We'll have to mak' the most o'
his knowledge."</p>

<p>Then he addressed the sullen aboriginal, and by a constant
repetition of the word "Babba" (water), sought to make him
understand their needs. But it was all to no purpose. The captive
made no sign, and only groaned horribly when the question was
pressed with a show of anger.</p>

<p>"All the same," sternly spoke Bob, "he'll have to tell us what
he knows before morning."</p>

<p>In a short time they had reached the camels, where Emu Bill and
Never Never Dave awaited them with ill-concealed impatience. But
their joy on observing the aboriginal was great indeed.</p>

<p>"I reckon he'll get water for us all right," said Emu Bill, as
they unloaded the camel. "I just reckon he will."</p>

<p>The Shadow now proceeded to build a fire, and soon the roaring
flames leapt up cheerily. Having no water, they could not make tea,
so they contented themselves with munching some pieces of damper,
for which, however, they had little appetite.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the prisoner showed signs of interest
in the proceedings, and Jack thereupon proffered him a substantial
bunch of the dry fare, which he seized and ate with avidity.</p>

<p>But still Mackay's repeated interrogations seemed to have no
effect on the savage, who kept glancing over to where the Shadow
was gingerly slicing up some tinned conglomeration which is served
out to explorers under a variety of names, and he opened his
cavernous orifice expectantly.</p>

<p>"The poor beggar is hungry," said Bob. "Let him have a piece of
that unknown substance, Shadow; if it does not kill him it may
arouse some sense of gratitude."</p>

<p>"He'd reduce our stores mighty quick," grumbled the Shadow,
noting with dismay how rapidly his hospitable offerings
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Just hold on a jiff," murmured Emu Bill, thoughtfully. "I
reckon I has struck a daisy idea." He hastened over to the many
sacks lying on the ground where the camels had been unloaded, and
came back with a handful of salt. "When you are as old as I is,
Shad," said he, graciously, "you will know how to handle blacks, I
calc'late. Does ye savvy?"</p>

<p>The Shadow took the salt with humble deference, and without a
word proceeded to mix it lavishly with the contents of a small tin
of the afore-mentioned compound, which he then handed to the hungry
native.</p>

<p>"Eat every bit o' it, ye howlin' baboon," said he, kindly, "an'
if ye isn't as thirsty as a camel after it, I reckon there must be
something wrong wi' your construction."</p>

<p>Mackay and Bob listened to the schemers with amusement, then, as
they saw the ravenous heathen bolt the salt-laden meat with great
gusto, they forgot for a moment their own thirsty condition and
indulged in a paroxysm of laughter.</p>

<p>"For a certainty our dusky friend will want water badly soon,"
said Bob; and they all sat around the camp fire and calmly awaited
developments. If their prisoner knew of the presence of water in
the vicinity he must surely endeavour to find it&mdash;half a pound
of the strongest salt in his interior might enlighten him as to the
meaning of 'Babba Babba,' which Mackay had repeated to him so
persistently. And they were not mistaken. Half an hour later he
began to show unmistakable signs of uneasiness, and his lips moved
like the gills of a fish out of water. Then he strained at the rope
which bound him to a mulga sapling behind, and rolled his eyes
beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Better give him a full hour yet," said Mackay. "We can thirst
just as comfortably as he can now, I think."</p>

<p>Emu Bill chuckled dryly.</p>

<p>"I is a grand instructor o' furrin' languages," he said. "I just
reckon that that there nigger knows what water means now."</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight, and the slow minutes dragged like ages
as they sat around the fire anxiously watching the antics of the
salt-gorged aboriginal. For a long time no one spoke, but their
basilisk-like glare evidently disconcerted the sufferer in no
little degree, and he commenced to moan in an exceedingly
melancholy manner, and endeavoured to evade their gaze by every
artifice in his power.</p>

<p>"He thinks we mean to eat him, and have been feeding him to make
him nice and plump!" hazarded Bob at length, and he had truly
guessed the captive's thoughts. However, the tortures of thirst
were surely having due effect on the poor savage, and his cries
soon became most distracting to the listeners' ears. Suddenly he
broke into a wailing chorus which echoed dismally through the still
air, and caused even the long-suffering camels to raise their heads
in protest.</p>

<p>"B-bab-ba-bab-ba!" he cried, tugging strenuously at the binding
cords.</p>

<p>"Patience ain't so bad a virtue, after all," soliloquized Emu
Bill, calmly slackening the rope from the tree, and gripping the
free end of it tightly. With a bound the native headed out into the
densest part of the scrub, almost pulling Bill over the sand in his
frantic haste; the rest of the party followed at their best speed.
Their now tractable guide did not lead them any distance. He
stopped in a small hollow not far from the scene of his capture,
and with feverish hands scraped away some covering twigs and
branches, revealing to the onlookers' eager eyes a glittering pool
of clearest water.</p>

<p>With a deep gurgle of relief he buried his tangled visage in the
spring, and drank so deeply that the Shadow felt compelled to jerk
him backwards out of sheer regard for his welfare.</p>

<p>"It's mighty stupid o' ye drinkin' so much after a heavy
supper," said he, reprovingly. "It's real bad for your digestion, I
reckon."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch13"></a>Chapter 13. The Mystic Mountain</h2>

<p>"Latitude 27&deg; 42&acute; 10&acute;&acute;, longitude 128&deg;
7&acute; 11&acute;&acute;." It was noon three days after leaving
Thirsty Spring, as their last strangely-found well had been
designated, and Bob read aloud these observations as he noted them
down in his log-book. They had reached the vicinity of Bentley's
last camp, and all eyes had been alert for the melancholy symbols
of the ill-fated expedition. Away to the east the country extended
back in a series of rugged "blows" until they suddenly merged into
apparent nothingness; a swelling, white haze obscured the true
horizon in this direction, but north and south well-wooded grassy
plains stretched into the dim distance. The uttermost edge of the
desert seemed to have been reached at last.</p>

<p>"Ay, it was just about here that the camel broke away," said
Mackay, musingly, "and over there"&mdash;he pointed to the
east&mdash;"lies the mountain."</p>

<p>"It must be a terrible long way over there, Mac," commented Emu
Bill, "for we should see it 'bout forty miles off if it is any
size, an' you said it was a whopper."</p>

<p>Mackay looked puzzled; certainly no mountain was visible at this
period.</p>

<p>"It <i>must</i> be there," he reiterated grimly.</p>

<p>Bob, too, was much exercised over the prolonged absence of the
desert sentinel; it had figured so much in all their calculations
that it had, indeed, been the initial quest of the expedition.</p>

<p>"There's an extraordinary heat haze rising up straight ahead,"
said he. "Perhaps it hides that shadowy mountain."</p>

<p>"It's there right enough," said Mackay, again. "I mind well that
I didna see it until I was right up against it."</p>

<p>"There's something mighty uncanny about this place," grunted
Never Never Dave, who had been gazing around suspiciously.</p>

<p>A gentle zephyr breeze wafted towards them from the obscuring
mists, and they sniffed the air wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Blow me tight, boys," muttered Emu Bill, "we has struck old
Jimmy Squarefoot's country."</p>

<p>"That are a fact," concurred Never Never Dave, solemnly; "we has
come a bit too far on this trip. No wonder poor ole Bentley didn't
get back."</p>

<p>"Why, what is wrong?" asked Jack, in some alarm.</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" echoed Never Never. "Why, we must be near
Hades, my lad; don't you smell it?"</p>

<p>A strong odour of a pungent, sulphurous nature assuredly filled
the air. Mackay was equally mystified with the others, though he
did not give expression to his thoughts. He was trying to recall to
the minutest incident the happenings of over a year ago in the same
district.</p>

<p>"I distinctly saw their tracks," he repeated, half to himself,
"and the bones&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But there ain't no bones now," interrupted Emu Bill. "There's
some curious mystery about this here place, there is."</p>

<p>A cry from the Shadow, who had gone exploring on his own account
some distance off, drew their attention. It was plain that he had
discovered something important, for he semaphored to them excitedly
as they looked. Silently they obeyed his summons, and in a few
minutes were gazing at the poor relics of the last expedition,
where they lay half covered in the sand.</p>

<p>There they were beyond a doubt, a mass of bleaching bones.
Reverently they uncovered their heads, then Mackay knelt down by
the sad litter, and great, dry sobs shook his breast. His
companions turned away with heavy eyes, all but Bob, who remained
to comfort the grief-stricken man.</p>

<p>"We may at least bury the remains," he said sadly, "and I think
we might put up a small mark over the spot. There are lots of trees
about which we could cut down."</p>

<p>Mackay looked at him kindly. "Not yet, Bob, not yet," he
muttered hoarsely; "not till I have squared accounts with the
wretches who committed this crime. These poor fellows here were
murdered after daring the dangers o' the desert; their last mortal
remains have awaited my coming here on the surface o' the
sweltering sands, and they cry to me for vengeance&mdash;and
vengeance they shall have before I cover them from the light o' a
just Heaven." He rose with forced calm and linked his arm in Bob's.
"You shall help me, Bob," he said earnestly; "you of all people
have a reason&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ceased abruptly as Emu Bill appeared once more. The tall
bushman was apparently much moved, though he strove to hide his
sorrow.</p>

<p>"I has just been talkin' to Never Never," he began, in an even
voice, "an' we has come to the conclusion that we'll go an' wipe
out some o' them skunks who did this. I reckon we'll feel better
after it."</p>

<p>Mackay smiled faintly. "I believe we are near the end o' our
search for the hidden treasure o' the Never Never," he said
quietly. "The invisible mountain must mark the entrance to the land
we are seeking, but we may have many a struggle before we triumph,
but each difficulty overcome will bring us nearer our goal. Let us
move on once more, Bill; I must see the other side o' the
mountain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' nary one o' us is goin' back on you," said Emu Bill, with a
grim laugh. "Wherever that there perfume comes from, I reckon Never
Never an' me will see the end o' the journey."</p>

<p>They retraced their way to the camels, and in a short time were
forcing a trail on into the seething mists. And now the stumbling
camel-train experienced great difficulty in negotiating the many
dry ravines that lay in their course, and they climbed over the
basaltic bluffs which now and again reared their heads above the
boulder-strewn expanse, only with the extremest effort. The sun
beat down pitilessly on the wayfarers, and here the heat was,
indeed, overpowering; it seemed to rise in long, pulsating swells
from the bare rocks and hang in a filmy cloud of vapour, through
which the eye could see but vaguely, as in a dream-picture. On, on,
the pioneers struggled, and as they proceeded, the strange,
sulphurous odour became more and more perceptible, until it
assailed the nostrils in sharp, burning breaths. Yet still the
vision ahead was clouded by dense white vapours, and the horizon
remained obscured. Then suddenly a curious thing happened: the
shrouding curtain in the near distance lifted up like a giant
screen in a theatre, and through the mists of dispelling ether a
dark towering height loomed up vividly.</p>

<p>"The mountain! the mountain!" cried Jack; and truly it was a
mountain, and a mountain of so precipitous and forbidding an aspect
that it looked like an immense black wall rising into the sky.</p>

<p>"That is just how I ran up against it before," said Mackay,
calmly. "It appeared all at once, and I wondered why I didna see it
earlier."</p>

<p>"Well, this beats me," growled Emu Bill. "An' why in all the
world <i>didn't</i> we see such a colossal monument before? We
oughter have sighted that there tower o' Babel at least two days
back."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke a great white mask rose from the base of the
towering elevation, and in an instant the mighty landmark had
vanished from their view.</p>

<p>"I reckon we has had a sight o' ole Jimmy Squarefoot's furnace,"
remarked Never Never Dave, mysteriously. "An' don't it smell
strong?"</p>

<p>"It jest howls," groaned Emu Bill, gasping hard.</p>

<p>Mackay kept an unmoved silence. He apparently had no intention
of being surprised at anything; but Bob somewhat eased the minds of
the twain by endeavouring to explain the phenomenon they had
witnessed.</p>

<p>"The covering haze is nothing but steam," said he. "I think the
mountain must be volcanic."</p>

<p>Mackay shook his head. "I shouldna wonder if it is an extinct
volcano," he said; "but there was no lava flow that I remember, and
it disappeared just the same."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the odd happenings during the last few minutes,
the camels were not permitted to slacken their pace. Each and all
of the party had determined to probe the mystery to the fullest,
and the solution was soon forthcoming. As they forced their way
into the densest depths of the ghost-like curtain, they became
quickly aware of a gurgling, boiling sound almost at their feet.
Bob's keen ears were the first to catch the unwonted echoes; but
before he could speak a greenish-yellow cloud rolled before his
eyes, and he staggered back, choking wildly.</p>

<p>"Ease off, boys," spoke Mackay. "We must scout around an'
investigate before we go further."</p>

<p>The whole party, camels and all, were now enveloped in the
wreathing smoke-columns, and the sky was hidden from sight. Blindly
Bob made a few steps forward, keeping well to the right of the
unseen caldron, which now bubbled and foamed spasmodically. The
Shadow followed, stumbling and gasping, and within a minute the two
found themselves in a clear and untainted atmosphere, and but a
yard or so from the base of the gloomy mountain. Loudly they
shouted to their companions, and soon the spectral forms of the
camels hove into view, with Mackay and Jack treading cautiously at
their head. But where were Emu Bill and Never Never Dave? They
seemed to have vanished completely.</p>

<p>"They were alongside Jack an' me a minute ago," said Mackay,
gazing wonderingly around.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll go back an' see if they've stopped to look at the
scenery," grunted the Shadow; and he made a dash into the heavy
fumes once more.</p>

<p>The three who waited by the camels heard a startled cry,
followed by a faint splash, then all was silent. Hastily Mackay
seized a camel pack-rope, and would have rushed off after him, but
Bob interfered.</p>

<p>"I think I can guess where to find them," he said. "Let me
go."</p>

<p>With reluctance Mackay saw him depart; but before Bob had
entered the chaos the swelling mass rose before him, disclosing in
his track a broad, pit-like cavity. Hurriedly he strode to the edge
of the caldron; but ere he reached it the Shadow climbed out of its
seething depths wet and dripping, and saying strange things to
himself. Immediately behind him Never Never Dave's head popped up,
and an eloquent flow of language was let loose upon the air.
Lastly, Emu Bill scrambled into the open. He looked savagely around
for a moment, until he caught sight of the Shadow, and his wrath
overflowed in a torrent of abuse. All three were bedraggled enough
looking specimens; but the last arrivals were considerably worse
off than the Shadow in that respect&mdash;their hair was covered
with a greenish scum, which spread down over their faces and almost
blinded them.</p>

<p>"It was all that wretched young Shadow's fault!" roared Emu
Bill.</p>

<p>"But you were there first, Bill," remonstrated Mackay,
laughingly.</p>

<p>"Of course we were. We went plump into the filthy boilers; but
we got a good grip o' the sides, and were sliding out quick an'
lively, when, blow me! if that howlin' scarecrow didn't bounce down
on top o' us, an' sent us swimmin' like tadpoles to the bottom.
Ugh!"</p>

<p>But their indignation quelled speedily when they learnt how
excellent had been the intentions of the much-maligned youth.</p>

<p>"It must be a hot spring," said Bob.</p>

<p>"And there are more of them," cried Jack. "See, they are
scattered all round the foot of the mountain."</p>

<p>"I reckon it is hot, right enough," grumbled Emu Bill. "I'm just
'bout turned into a Salamander, I is."</p>

<p>As Jack had noticed, quite a number of similar indentations
formed a line right along the base of the mountain, and in each
yawning crater examined, a greenish-yellow fluid bubbled
tempestuously. High overhead the smoke-wreaths dissembled into thin
air, and for a brief space all was beautifully clear. Then a dull
rumble like the mutterings of subdued thunder was heard, and
immediately snowy puffs of smoke issued from the strange cavities.
The denser fumes rapidly spread along the ground like a turbulent,
foaming sea; then the whole seemed gradually to rise upwards and
suspend as a filmy pall before the face of the mountain. Yet,
strangely enough, the noxious odours were now almost absent.</p>

<p>"Ay, it's vera marvellous," said Mackay, with a sigh. "So does
Nature protect her treasure-houses."</p>

<p>"It's a wonder you managed to get through without accident when
you came," Bob observed thoughtfully. "But, then, it's possible the
line was clear when you passed."</p>

<p>"A breeze of wind would have lifted that fog," hazarded Jack. "I
should think that on some days the clouds would not be nearly so
constant nor so thick."</p>

<p>"You're possibly right, Jack," mused Mackay, looking upwards.
"See how the smoke curls in to the west now."</p>

<p>They all followed his gaze, and, surely enough, the mists
appeared to bend over before a powerful air current and break off
into numberless flying patches of lambent spray. Assuredly, a
fairly strong blast must be blowing on the mountain summit, though
all was serene and unmoved below. They now bethought themselves of
having an inspection of the wonderful elevation, which they had
reached after so much weary striving. There it stood, gaunt and
bare, precipitous in outline, and rising almost sheer to a height
of over eight hundred feet, and as far as the eye could reach in
either direction along the base, the same grim barrier appeared,
but it curved in almost imperceptibly at each limit of
observation.</p>

<p>"The monument might stretch across into Queensland," said Emu
Bill, "if we tried to follow it round. I vote we does a scramble
over the top."</p>

<p>"I tried that before, Bill," answered Mackay, "but I'm going to
try it again. Only we'll look for the easiest side before we
start."</p>

<p>"But what about the camels?" asked Jack. "We can never get them
over it."</p>

<p>"An' we've got to remember that there's an all-fired quantity o'
bloodthirsty niggers about," said Never Never Dave.</p>

<p>"Suppose we hobble them out on the other side of the smoke,"
suggested Bob. "If the blacks stay beyond the mountain they
couldn't very well see them so close in, and the camels are too
tired to wander much."</p>

<p>"It's a risk, Bob," said Mackay; "but the whole journey has been
a risk, an' it's the best we can do. We can keep an eye on them
from the top&mdash;if we get there."</p>

<p>"An' our rifles can speak for us from there well enough,"
laughed Emu Bill; "an' there's one howlin' satisfaction about it,
there's nary spear could reach us."</p>

<p>And so it was arranged; the four tired beasts were unloaded, the
bell was unstrapped from Misery's neck, and the Shadow led them out
to the plains, man&oelig;uvring most carefully in his passage
between the bubbling caldrons. In a few minutes he returned, with a
somewhat anxious visage.</p>

<p>"I is pretty certain I saw a nig on the top o' the hill when I
was out back a bit," he announced.</p>

<p>"On the top o' the hill?" cried Emu Bill, incredulously. "Well,
if they don't pop too many spears at us, I don't mind if they stay
there until we get up."</p>

<p>"But you couldn't see anything through the haze, Shad," said
Bob.</p>

<p>"I just did. The top o' the concern was shining strong in the
sun, an' I got a sight o' a big nigger dressed like a corroborree
mourner standin' looking' at me."</p>

<p>It was quite possible that the Shadow's information was correct,
for the fine haze in the upper air would barely have obscured the
bold ridge of the mountain summit, especially with the sun's rays
beating strong upon it. Yet it was evident that the young bushman's
statement was received with considerable unbelief.</p>

<p>"It's been a hallucination, Shad," laughed Jack.</p>

<p>It was already late in the afternoon, and it would have been
useless to attempt the climb that night, so a tour of investigation
was made in order to discover the least impregnable aspect of the
frowning barrier, and as the little party moved along they carried
their rifles ready for immediate action in case of a sudden alarm.
But not a sign of natives was observed, and they tramped mile after
mile over the jagged rocky <i>d&eacute;bris</i> lining the base of
the mountain without once noting an easier place of ascent than
that which they had first gazed upon. Not a trace of vegetation
showed on the steep declivity; the bare rocks scintillated in the
last rays of the setting sun, and showed up barren and forbidding.
Here and there deep clefts appeared, striating the gloomy
formation, and cutting deep into the heart of the mountain. It was
one of these that drew an exclamation from Mackay.</p>

<p>"That looks vera like the cap o' a gold-bearing lode showing at
the bottom o' the gully," he cried. He crept carefully into the
yawning crevice, and broke off a piece of the supposed auriferous
stone with the iron heel of his boot. "Decomposed diorite," he
announced, "and showing gold all over. I do believe the whole
mountain is just a mass of gold lodes an' leaders."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blest," murmured Emu Bill, "if that don't beat
everything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But we can't carry the hillock away," said Jack, hurriedly.</p>

<p>The difficulties of transport had at once appeared to his
practical mind, and his words acted as a restraining tonic on the
exhilarating spirits of the others.</p>

<p>"You're right there, Jack," agreed Mackay, with a smile, "but if
we get plenty of water on the other side, we could very soon get
machinery out here; an' I've a firm idea that our golden land o'
promise lies just beyond this barrier." He tapped the rocky surface
with his hand meditatively. "And more than that," he continued,
with rising excitement, "I believe we'll find rubies and diamonds
as well. I mind we picked up some rubies in the gullies around the
last camp when I was here before. At least, Phil, the geologist,
said they were rubies, an' I'd back his knowledge in that direction
against any man's. He said they had been shed from some mountain or
other, but, of course, we hadna seen the mountain at this time; and
poor Phil never did see it, either."</p>

<p>They commenced to retrace their steps, for the night was fast
closing in, and as they walked along, Bob stooped down occasionally
to pick up pebbles from the silted driftage at his feet, and
unobtrusively placed them in his pocket for future inspection. They
had almost reached the place where they had unloaded the camels,
when the Shadow shouted out triumphantly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look, boys! I reckon there ain't no mistake about that nigger,
is there?"</p>

<p>He was gazing at the ridge forming the summit of the mountain,
and looking up, Bob saw a tall, dishevelled figure standing against
the sky-line and waving his arms energetically.</p>

<p>"By gum, he is wild!" laughed Emu Bill; "an' what a dandy outfit
he's got; why, the beggar's got a 'possum blanket over him."</p>

<p>He raised his rifle mechanically, but Mackay had already
levelled his piece at the silhouetted form.</p>

<p>"Please don't shoot," pleaded Bob, staying his hand. "It almost
seems like murder to kill a man like that."</p>

<p>Mackay lowered his weapon with a groan, and Bob, looking upwards
once more, was astounded to see the object of his commiseration
extending his hands as if in benediction. He stood thus for a
moment, then, with a despairing gesture, pointed towards the
Western desert.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I didna shoot," said Mackay; "that's the most
wonderful savage I've seen. He even tried to warn us not to come
further."</p>

<p>"That was out o' gratitood for us not shootin'," laughed Emu
Bill; "but, blow me, I can't shoot a nig when he hasn't a spear or
weapon o' some sort in his hand."</p>

<p>When they looked again, the strange aboriginal was gone.</p>

<p>The spirits of the little party were unusually cheerful that
night, as they sat around their camp-fire and talked eagerly over
their prospects on the morrow. Their objective had been reached at
last, the toil and stress of the dreary journey was over, the
reward&mdash;and of reward they all seemed well assured&mdash;was
now about to be theirs.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll give ye a hymn o' praise on the orchestra,"
remarked the Shadow, pulling his ear-shattering instrument from the
pocket where it had lain silent since the finding of Fortunate
Spring.</p>

<p>"If ye does," threatened Emu Bill, "I'll dump ye in that there
smelling solution right over the head."</p>

<p>"Hang it, Bill," complained the unappreciated musician, "I ain't
quite dry yet, as it is. Couldn't ye think o' some happier kind o'
return for my professional services?"</p>

<p>"Anyhow," consoled Jack, "it wouldn't do to let the niggers know
we were about; they might come for us when we were helplessly
enslaved with your melody."</p>

<p>The Shadow grinned. "Right O," said he; "music is off."</p>

<p>But Mackay had not seemed at all unwilling to encourage the
youth's suggestion.</p>

<p>"The blacks should ken we are about by this time," he observed
lightly; "but there are six good rifles in this camp, an' we might
as well encourage them to come out now as at any other time.
There's going to be a good moon up to-night."</p>

<p>"You might give us a tootle on the flute," said Never Never
Dave; "I hasn't heard ye play since we left Golden Flat."</p>

<p>"Let us have 'The Muskittie's Lament,'" urged the Shadow; "I is
just dyin' to stretch my voice a bit."</p>

<p>"No, Shadow; though you are a budding Sims Reeves, I can't
sympathize wi' you enough just now to listen to you singing. I must
even deny you the pleasure o' hearing me warble the old familiar
tune to-night, for I'm no' in the mood for waxing extravagantly
joyous. But seein' we've reached the deceivin' mountain at last,
and without mishap, I'll gie ye a blaw on the flute, if only to
make this night something different from other nights."</p>

<p>Jack fetched the flute with alacrity, and then seated himself
beside Bob, and soon the little group were listening in hushed
silence to the pensive strains of one of Balfe's melodies. When it
was finished, the man of many moods paused for a moment, and his
eyes roamed instinctively back towards the desert, and though the
smoky cloud still intervened, Bob guessed at once that he was again
filled with swelling memories of the past.</p>

<p>"Let us have something lively, Mac," said Emu Bill, "something
that will make us forget them pestiferous niggers for a bit."</p>

<p>"I can't do it, Bill," came the husky response; "not here, not
to-night." Then he lifted the flute once more. "I'll play you one
o' Bentley's favourite hymns," he said gravely. "Well do I mind we
used a' to sing it whiles when we were on the march."</p>

<p>Softly into the night rose the notes; they lingered by each deep
crevasse on the mountain side, and echoed back from the rocky
steeps. Unspeakably entrancing was the effect. The musician himself
seemed lost in the wonderful sounds he created, and his hearers,
after listening in mute attention for some time, by a common
impulse joined in with the words, familiar to them all&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Lead, kindly Light...<br>
Lead Thou me on."</p>

<p>And as the rough voices swelled upwards, a weird answering
chorus floated back to them from the summit of the mountain, and
lo! several dark forms appeared outlined against the starry sky.
Emu Bill ceased his vocal exercises at once, and squirmed about
uneasily until the flute stopped.</p>

<p>"Say, mates," said he, anxiously; "I hope it ain't no
corroborree song they is singin'."</p>

<p>Mackay glanced upwards, then hastily grasped his rifle, but the
vague voices in the air broke afresh upon his ears just as he was
about to pull the trigger, and he laid the deadly weapon down with
a shudder.</p>

<p>"They are actually mimicking that bonnie hymn," he said
nervously. "I&mdash;I haven't the heart to shoot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And aren't their voices almost musical!" cried Jack, whose ear
was keenly attuned to melody. "They make a very much better attempt
than our corroborree savages did about a week ago; their voices
were simply hideous."</p>

<p>"The aborigines are born mimics, Jack," answered Mackay; "but,
as you say, their song is usually enough to drive a man to
drink&mdash;providin' he can get it. Still there may be a different
sort o' savage in this mysterious country. If the land itself is
better, it would influence the people, and who knows maybe they
have acquired some accomplishments unknown to their brethren on the
flats."</p>

<p>"I can't make them out at all," said Bob, quietly. "Everything
seems so unreal, so&mdash;so uncanny about here, and these niggers
singing that hymn have given me the creeps."</p>

<p>"Let me have one go at 'The Muskittie's Lament,'" pleaded the
Shadow. "I reckon it would bust them up to mimic that high
note&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You leave that long-suffering muskittie alone," said Mackay.
"We'll bust them up wi' something more solid in the morning. I'll
climb that mountain or go under trying."</p>

<p>Conversation somewhat flagged after that. The events of the day
had all been so strange and inexplicable; the lure of the mountain
was becoming oppressively potent, and each of the staunch little
band was filled with his own secret convictions regarding what
might lie beyond.</p>

<p>"Better turn into your blankets, boys," said Mackay, at length.
"You'll need all your energies in the morning. I'm going to keep
watch and see that nothing happens while you sleep. I'm not going
to risk another wipe out in this quarter."</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to do sentry go on your own," spoke Never Never
Dave. "I reckon I'll take my turn."</p>

<p>"An' me, of course!" cried Emu Bill.</p>

<p>"And ain't the poor, low-down Shadow any good?" complained that
individual, pathetically. "Let me do a prance round, boss. I ain't
a bit sleepy."</p>

<p>"Let Jack and me take it for the first night," said Bob,
quietly.</p>

<p>Mackay laughed. "I know you are all vera willing, my lads, but
the first night is my care; I'll ask Bob, who is next in
responsibility, to take part o' the watch. Jack and the Shadow will
be on duty to-morrow night, and you, Bill and Never Never, can take
the next;" which equable arrangement appeared to suit every
one.</p>

<p>Then Bob arose, rifle in hand, and stepped forward.</p>

<p>"No, no, Bob; not yet," said Mackay. "I'll call you in three or
four hours to take a spell. Lie down and sleep for a bit, my
lad."</p>

<p>But Bob was obdurate. "You've been wearing yourself out these
last few days," he said simply. "You can surely trust me to fill
your place for the first half of the night, at least. Perhaps I may
not need to call you, for I know I couldn't sleep if I tried. My
brain is buzzing with odd ideas, which would be bound to keep me
awake."</p>

<p>The elder man hesitated for a moment, then gave in. "But promise
to call me at one o'clock, Bob," he said, "otherwise I'll stay up
with you;" and Bob promised.</p>

<p>A few minutes and a row of sleeping figures lay outstretched
around the fire. Bob tightened up his cartridge-belt, pulled up the
heads of several cartridges so that they might be easily extracted
in an emergency, examined the magazine of his gun, and closed the
breech gently, bringing the trigger to full cock. Then he waited,
motionless as a statue, beside the huddled forms of his comrades,
with rifle upraised, and every nerve strung at highest tension.
Well he knew that danger threatened; he felt it in the air; an
ominous calm prevailed; how soon would it be broken by the savage
yells of the guardians of the mountain? Bob gripped his rifle the
tighter, and his eyes scanned the near distance critically, then
roamed aloft to the now deserted mountain summit. A slight sound
startled him, and his finger closed gently on the trigger of his
weapon, but it was only Mackay tossing restlessly in his blanket.
Bob looked pityingly at the sleepless form, and at that moment
Mackay beckoned him.</p>

<p>"I canna get it out o' my mind," he whispered, "that when I
followed the tracks o' the blacks, they led right into the mountain
an' no' round about it, an' it beats me to know how they managed to
climb over so quickly. Keep a careful watch, Bob; keep a careful
watch."</p>

<p>Bob nodded silently and returned to his position. He had
unconsciously shared Mackay's fears before they had been spoken.
Since he first saw the mysterious mount he had marvelled how it had
been scaled, and how descents had been accomplished.</p>

<p>The Southern Cross slowly sank to rest, and the edge of the
Great Bear constellation peeped above the northern horizon. Yet
still the watcher stood erect at his post, and the camp
slumbered.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch14"></a>Chapter 14. The Struggle by the Mountain</h2>

<p>It was well after midnight, and Bob still stood guard over the
sleeping camp with undiminished vigilance. Not a sound in the air
escaped him; he heard the distant scream of the curlew with a
shiver of dread, then nearer at hand the dull monotone of a mopoke
resting on some rocky ledge overhead would reach his ears as a
dismal calling from a shadowy world. Again would come a period of
silence, broken only by the gurgling echoes from the sulphur
springs, and the regular breathing of the sleepers. Bob pulled
himself together impatiently, he had felt himself relaxing into a
kind of stupor wherein all things grim and melancholy appeared to
him.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have believed," he muttered, "what a shattering
influence a night watch has on a man's nerves."</p>

<p>The long wailing cry of a dingo now penetrated piercingly over
the desert from the west, and the watcher stirred uneasily at the
mournful sound which seemed to convey in it all the sadness and
despair of a voice from the nether world.</p>

<p>The weird notes had scarcely died away when he became conscious
of a peculiar tap-tapping almost close beside him. He could not
make it out; the black surface of the barring range rose before his
eyes, but he could distinguish nothing there, and the moon shone
clearly on the giant rock. Tap! Tap! Tap! Softly the echoes came
but imperceptibly growing louder; anxiously he scanned the bare
hillside for some clue to the mystery, and as his eyes reached the
ridge of the mountain he was startled to see a tall beshrouded
figure standing there, and apparently gazing down upon him. Bob was
certain the apparition had not been in the same place but a minute
ago, and surely he could not be responsible for these strange
noises which seemed to come from the mountain, yet with no cause
showing. Tap! Tap! Tap! Harsher and more metallic the ghostly
reverberations rang, and now a faint call wafted down from the
heights; again and again it came, gently falling on the mystified
listener's ears like a voice from the skies, and the strange figure
aloft waved his arms in wild gesticulation. Sharper and still
sharper sounded the demoralizing tapping, and with it now came a
curious shuffling, slight almost to noiselessness, but Bob's
sensitive ears were not to be deceived. A cold sweat broke out upon
his brow; the vague disturbances of the night were issuing not from
the side of the mountain, but from its interior! With a quick
stride he reached Mackay, and at a touch the sleeper awoke.</p>

<p>"What is it, lad, what is it?" he asked, breathlessly, his rifle
already in his hand.</p>

<p>Bob placed his finger on his lips, and pointed silently to the
mountain.</p>

<p>"They're coming <i>through</i> it!" he whispered, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Mackay nodded briefly, and strode silently over to the
resounding wall, and Bob hastily aroused the sleepers. In a moment
the camp was prepared, and meanwhile Mackay was walking stealthily
along the base of the mount, his ears bent down to the rock as he
strove to locate the mysterious alarms. And now the distant call
from the hilltop floated down to them once more, and Emu Bill
started at the sound, and looked up wonderingly, for the faint
double note of a coo-ee had this time been plainly heard, and the
tall form on the distant heights was despairingly pointing outwards
across the desert.</p>

<p>"That nigger can coo-ee like a good 'un," muttered he, "an' he's
tryin' to warn us. I reckon that's because we didn't shoot him
to-day; but I never believed a nig could feel any gratitood."</p>

<p>Suddenly the echoes ceased, and all was silent as a tomb. Bob
looked, and saw Mackay crouched hard against the rocky wall on the
edge of a deep fissure which showed down half the face of the
mountain. He seemed like an animal preparing for a deadly
spring.</p>

<p>"I reckon we should go over beside him," said Never Never Dave,
but so speedy had been the developments of events that there was no
time to decide upon a definite course of action. Indeed, not one of
the party guessed what wild happening was about to take place. Bob
somehow expected to hear the preliminary yells of an attacking
horde, even as they had heard them before, but no such outcry took
place. He saw Mackay beckon wildly with one hand over his shoulder,
and quickly he obeyed the summons, the others following with silent
footsteps. Then a stone clattered noisily at the bottom of the
ravine, and to Bob's amazement, a swarthy face appeared from the
depths, surmounted by a tall waving head-dress of feathers. As the
warrior emerged further into view, Bob's astonishment increased,
for here was no naked savage, but a gorgeously arrayed aboriginal,
splendidly proportioned, and carrying in his hand a long curved bow
and several arrows. Bob had just time to note this much and no
more, for Mackay's rifle belched out almost in the new arrival's
face, but the shot had been fired with the hands resting loosely on
the ground, and the bullet sped high, scattering the nodding plumes
of the astonished black in all directions. With a cry of pent-up
fury, Mackay lunged forward to grasp his prey, and at once the
stalwart native closed with him. And now crowding up behind, one by
one, a solemn procession of similarly attired warriors came
trooping. The first of the number without hesitation rushed to the
assistance of his struggling comrade, the others calmly bore down
upon the little group, who, with Bob at their head, had watched the
scene as in a dream. With a hoarse snarl of rage Never Never Dave
opened fire, and almost at the same instant the entire artillery of
the camp spouted out flame and smoke and leaden hail. In reply, a
cloud of arrows flew about their heads, and Bob felt one pierce the
muscle of his arm, but he pulled out the slender barb with a
wrench, and again his rifle spoke, and the roar of many reports in
his ears told him that his comrades too were strenuously engaged.
Backwards and forwards the spectral warriors surged, and yet never
a sound escaped their lips, and they strove with steady effort to
come to close quarters with the camp defenders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mackay was engaged in desperate encounter on the edge
of the fray. His first antagonist he had flung from him almost
immediately, limp and broken, from that dreadful clutch. The second
he had rendered <i>hors de combat</i> with a single blow of his
mighty fist. Then two more rushed upon him, but profiting by the
experience of their brethren they evaded his circling arms, and
hurled themselves upon his lower limbs, and there they clutched
leech-like, while others hastened to attack him from behind. Mackay
marvelled for the moment why they had not shot him down with their
arrows; his own rifle had been thrown aside after the first
fruitless shot, but now his revolver flashed in his hand, and the
weighty stock came down crash on the head of his nearest
encumbrance, but before he could use it again, he was seized from
the back and pulled to the earth, yet even as he fell his revolver
exploded upwards into the faces of his foes, and he chuckled in
grim joy as he felt their relaxing hold. It was at this stage that
Bob missed him from their midst. The attack had drawn off somewhat,
and he glanced around for the first time in search of his
companions. Then he noticed the seething band standing over the
fallen giant, and a wild fury filled his heart.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," he cried, "Mackay's down!" and he dashed to the
rescue.</p>

<p>Quick as he was Never Never Dave was quicker, and his clubbed
rifle swung light as a feather in his strong right hand, but it
fell heavy as lead on the heads of the all too previous natives,
who had not looked for further molestation from that quarter. With
a guttural exclamation they leaped aside, and Mackay arose bleeding
and scarred. But the end was not yet; even while the defenders were
congratulating themselves on their victory the natives once more
swooped down upon them, and their arrows whistled loudly through
the air. They had guessed that the death-dealing weapons of the
little party had lost their power, for indeed there had not been a
shot fired these many minutes, and the magazines of the rifles were
empty. But they still had their revolvers, and at the first
discharge the angry blacks seemed to waver, but still they came on.
As in a dream Bob saw a wild, grinning face peering into his, while
a heavy club was raised to strike; vainly he tried to lift his
revolver, the blood rushed to his head, his brain reeled, another
instant and the blow would have fallen, when, with a stifled cry,
Jack dashed before him and sprang fiercely at the savage's throat.
The very force of his onslaught bore back the gloating native, the
club fell, but it fell harmlessly to the ground as Jack's fingers
closed on its owner's throat. But the warrior had had enough;
disentangling himself from the youth's grasp, with many a wriggle
and gasp, he turned and fled, and when Jack looked round he found
that the entire enemy had vanished.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Mackay, cheerily, "let us estimate the damage.
You, Bob, have got an arrow-hole in your arm, an' I'm surprised
you've managed to hold out so long, but if you had got that crack
on the head that was meant for you, you would never have seen old
England again."</p>

<p>Bob laughed weakly. "I'm pretty right," he said. "What about
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Nothing serious, my lad; and you, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Not a scratch," responded that youth, brightly.</p>

<p>"As for me, boys," echoed out Emu Bill's voice dismally, "I'm a
regular pin-cushion, I am. I reckon they've ventilated me a bit;
but hang it all, them arrows don't hurt worth a cent."</p>

<p>But where were the Shadow and Never Never Dave? The former they
found sitting moodily by the base of the mountain, his back propped
against it for support.</p>

<p>"That there last rush 'bout finished me," he said. "A howling
gorilla gave me a tender smack on the back wi' his club,
an'&mdash;an' I believe it's broken."</p>

<p>Mackay laughed. "The back or the club, Shadow?" said he; whereat
the sorrowful youngster arose painfully to his feet, and communed
with himself in language deep and eloquent.</p>

<p>"Where in thunder has Never Never gone?" cried Emu Bill,
anxiously, as they looked in vain for the well-known figure of the
bushman.</p>

<p>"He was beside me when that last rush came on," said Jack,
almost tearfully. "I didn't see what happened to any one after
that."</p>

<p>"Dave! Dave!" cried Emu Bill, and there was a quiver in his
voice which sounded strangely on his lips. "Where are you,
Dave?"</p>

<p>Then a thin, weak voice answered out of the gloom by the
ravine.</p>

<p>"I is right here, Bill, old man, right here."</p>

<p>And there they found him, lying aslant on the loose
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> as he had fallen, an inert mass. His face was
upturned to the sky, and his breath issued between his clenched
teeth in long spasmodic jerks. He smiled feebly as they bent over
him.</p>

<p>"I'm sent for this trip, boys," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Dave," groaned Emu Bill, in anguish; "you ain't
goin' to leave your old comrade, Dave?"</p>

<p>Mackay knelt down by the stricken man and placed his hand over
the feebly beating heart, and a hoarse cry of pain burst from his
lips, which was echoed by the sad little group around.</p>

<p>"They must have given you a sair crack, Davie, man," said he, "a
sair, sair crack."</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of the broken butts of two arrows in the
sufferer's broad chest, and he turned aside with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"Never Never's going, lads," he said, with deep emotion. "Say
your good-byes before it is too late."</p>

<p>Emu Bill gently pillowed his dying comrade's head upon his knee,
and the tears ran down his rugged cheeks unchecked, and dropped
upon Never Never Dave's pallid face.</p>

"EMU BILL GENTLY PILLOWED HIS DYING COMRADE'S HEAD UPON HIS KNEE">
</p>

<p class="caption">"Emu Bill gently pillowed his dying
comrade'shead upon his knee"</p>

<p>"Couldn't we carry him over and lay him on the blankets?"
whispered Bob.</p>

<p>Mackay sadly shook his head. Then Never Never Dave opened his
eyes and glanced at the sorrowing assembly, while his old smile
struggled to his lips.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, boys," he whispered, "don't fret 'bout me. I is goin'
on a long, long trail, where there ain't no nigs an' no snakes.
Never Never has made his last bush journey, I reckon.
But&mdash;but&mdash;we reached the mountain." He ceased and
laboured for breath, while the blood welled out from his cruel
wounds with the exertion. Silently each pressed round and squeezed
the bushman's rough and horny hand in a farewell grip. Once more
the man whose life-blood was ebbing so cruelly fast away spoke, but
now he was in the fantasy of delirium. "We'll get the spring all
right, Bob. Don't worry, my lad&mdash;and the mountain, wi' gold
and diamonds&mdash;we'll reach it, after all. Over the
mountain&mdash;over&mdash;the&mdash;mountain." And so Never Never
Dave went forth himself on a new quest with a smile on his lips,
the smile of a man who knew no fear even at the end of his earthly
pilgrimage. Emu Bill gathered the stiffening form in his arms,
gulping down the great sobs with an effort, and tenderly he carried
his lifeless burden over to the camp-fire, and sad indeed were the
hearts of the melancholy procession which followed.</p>

<p>"I reckon Never Never has had his wish, anyhow," said Emu Bill,
quietly. "He has passed in his checks with his boots on."</p>

<p>"May we a' go out on the long trail as bravely," spoke Mackay,
solemnly. "Dave has gone over the mountain right enough. Over the
mountain o' earthly difficulty and down through the valley of the
shadow. We should not pity him now, boys, for he's free o' all the
sorrows an' cares, an' disappointments o' this vale o' tears. But
we mustn't forget the living, lads, though we respect the dead, or
there may be more o' us starting out on the long trail before
sunrise. Get a lamp, Jack, an' we'll have a look at that gully
where they came out."</p>

<p>"You're right, Mac," answered Emu Bill; "I'll get a pick too, in
case we need it."</p>

<p>The lamp was speedily brought, and they started over to the
gully whence the natives had emerged, and as they crossed the scene
of their conflict Jack stumbled over the dead body of one of the
warriors. He shuddered painfully, and Bob, who was at his hand,
drew him aside.</p>

<p>"There are three more of them, Jack," he whispered. "Never
Never, hasn't gone under unavenged."</p>

<p>Mackay heard the words, and he laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Ay, there's three more o' them, Bob," he said, "and there's a
dozen more who feel a bit mair pained in their anatomy than we
do."</p>

<p>They reached the treacherous ravine, and Mackay, taking the lamp
in his hand, cautiously moved forwards and downwards into the deep
recess, and gazed at the rocky rubble there strewn in bewilderment.
In a moment Emu Bill stood beside him, pick in hand, but he too was
nonplussed completely by the very natural appearance of
affairs.</p>

<p>"I'll swear I saw them come outen this here hole," he said.</p>

<p>"We can't blame ourselves vera much for neglectin' to notice
things," agreed Mackay, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>In the depths of the fissure which striated the mountain, only a
number of loose boulders were to be seen.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll try and shift some o' them," spoke Emu Bill. He
stooped down and lifted one or two of the heaviest rock fragments,
while Mackay held the light, and examined the markings on the walls
of the cavern with keen interest.</p>

<p>"There ain't no opening here at all," cried Emu Bill, looking
round fearfully, as if half expecting to find the savages still
close in the vicinity. "I'm certain sure they couldn't get through
here."</p>

<p>Mackay smiled. "I don't know what sort o' blacks we've struck,
Bill," he said earnestly; "but if they constructed this trap-door
arrangement they've got a wonderful amount o' intelligence."</p>

<p>He traced with his finger an irregularly shaped shelving crack
in the southerly wall. It seemed a perfectly natural occurrence in
every way, as indeed it was, but the edges gaped considerably
towards the top, and Mackay, pressing lightly against the mossy
front, caused the overlapping rim to close solid into the rock. By
this time Bob, Jack, and the Shadow had scrambled in beside the
two.</p>

<p>"But they couldn't get through that measly crack," protested Emu
Bill, not quite understanding.</p>

<p>Mackay reached for the pick, and inserting the sharp point into
the thin, almost unnoticeable crack now showing, pulled gently, and
behold, the weighty rock swung back on end revealing a narrow,
tunnel-like entrance penetrating into the mountain. At the same
time a draught of damp and stifling air issued from the dark and
gloomy passage way, extinguishing the lamp, and before they could
look again, the rock fell softly back into position, and this time
it closed with a snap. Again Mackay endeavoured to lever it open,
but now the solid formation refused to be moved; try as he might,
the doorway into the mountain seemed closed conclusively against
him.</p>

<p>"Surely it cannot be a natural cave formation?" said Bob.</p>

<p>"Nary cave, Bob," returned Emu Bill, decisively.</p>

<p>"Not in a diorite rock," added Mackay, much perplexed.</p>

<p>They stood gazing at the tantalizing face of the ponderous
doorway for some time without speaking. Then Mackay was aroused to
action.</p>

<p>"We'll find out all about it before we go away from here," he
said, "but in the meantime we'll barricade the swinging rock on
this side to prevent any one coming out. I have an idea that it
wasn't right closed at first or we would never have been able to
find it; the blacks were in too great a hurry to be cautious, I'm
thinking."</p>

<p>With a will they all set to work and built up a rampart of
massive boulders in the ravine. Then they sadly went back to the
camp-fire to await the coming of the dawn. All thought of sleep had
left them now, and they sat moodily by the flickering flames for
some time without a word being spoken, then as the chill morning
air made itself felt, Bob's wounded arm, which he had not yet
examined, began to grow stiff, and his head throbbed painfully. The
Shadow, too, was far from comfortable, though he made no complaint,
and he fought against his growing weakness manfully but at last,
with a weary sigh, he fell back limp on his blanket. Then Mackay
rose with an exclamation of regret.</p>

<p>"Bill," he said, "we've forgotten that these young mates of ours
are scarcely as tough as we are. We'd better try an' doctor up
their bruises a bit."</p>

<p>Emu Bill staggered to his feet with a sympathetic grunt, and
walked blindly towards the camel packs in search of something that
might serve for bandages, and Mackay stooped over the fallen Shadow
and pulled back the neck of his much-torn shirt. The cause of that
individual's relapse was not difficult to find, a great jagged gash
on the young bushman's shoulder showed what a fierce blow he had
received, evidently from a flint-studded club. Jack hurried to
fetch water to lave the bloody wound, but the Shadow refused to
receive any attention.</p>

<p>"Let the thing dry, boss," he said, sitting up once more. "I
reckon I ain't no tender chicken to howl 'bout a muskittie
bite."</p>

<p>Bob's memento of the affray was a little more serious; one of
the barbs of the arrow had broken in his arm, keeping the wound
open, and the blood was still dripping down his sleeve in great
gouty drops. Mackay carefully cut out the splintered wood with the
point of his sheath-knife, an acutely painful operation; but the
patient never winced.</p>

<p>Then Emu Bill returned. "I can't find nary cloth 'ceptin'
flour-bags," he announced. "Take a bit o' this here shirt o'
mine."</p>

<p>He ripped off a sleeve of his garment and handed it to Mackay,
and with it Bob's arm was soon tightly dressed. And now the rosy
light of approaching dawn began to spread over the scene, and the
stars faded out one by one before the radiant sun's advance.
Morning had come at last. Yes, morning had come, and with it
appeared in all their grim hideousness the evidences of the long
night's struggle. There was Never Never Dave stretched beside them,
his calm white face gazing peacefully towards the heavens. A little
way off four huddled forms lay bent up in the dust, their torn
plumes scattered around them. Here and there arrows and clubs were
strewn, and gory tracks marked the way towards the subterranean
passage wherein the warriors had retreated. Bob surveyed the
ghastly relics with a sorrowful countenance. Here to him was a new
aspect of the wanderer's life. In the pursuit of Nature's treasure
the risks were many if the rewards were great. All was not sunshine
and romance and pleasurable excitement. He stood for some minutes
in silent contemplation.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said aloud, "and I, too, would have been lying there,
had it not been for you, Jack."</p>

<p>"Don't speak about it, Bob," returned the boy at his side, with
a shudder. "How could I have gone home without you?"</p>

<p>Mackay had, in the mean time, been examining the discarded
weapons of the aborigines with critical interest.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," he said quietly, "that we might all have been
lying there if the warriors hadn't imagined us to be asleep. I can
only find about twenty arrows altogether. I think they could only
have carried one or two each, never dreaming they would have need
for more."</p>

<p>"I reckon that is why they tried to rush us every time,"
remarked Emu Bill. "They were too cock-sure, they were; an' we've
got to be thankful for it. But ain't this a funny get up for nigs,
even if they is on for a corroborree dance?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the strange habiliments of the dead warriors. Each
native was cloaked in a rich opossum robe, suspended from the
shoulders almost down to the heels.</p>

<p>"I can't make them out, Bill," said Mackay. "They are different
from any tribe I've ever run across before. They're bigger than an
ordinary native, and their faces look almost intelligent. But we've
forgotten about the mountain passage. Surely the blacks couldn't
have made that. There's more o' a mystery here than I can fathom,
Bill; but we'll soon know what it all means."</p>

<p>"I just reckon we will," grated Emu Bill as they turned
away.</p>

<p>Jack, who was now the most active member of the party, was not
long in preparing breakfast, and the stimulating influence of the
boiling tea did much to revive their weary spirits.</p>

<p>"If only Never Never hadn't gone under," said the Shadow, as he
munched at his hard, unpalatable damper fare, "I could have felt
real joyous, I could. I reckon we has struck the land o' gold and
di'monds right enough."</p>

<p>The mysterious mountain had assuredly grown more and more
mystifying. What wonderful secret could be hid beyond? What strange
people could have made the tunnel through its mighty heart?</p>

<p>"I am convinced we are about to make a wonderful discovery,"
said Bob. "Ordinary aborigines could never have constructed that
passage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And allowing that they could," interjected Jack; "what purpose
is it supposed to serve?"</p>

<p>"I reckon it's the treasure chamber o' the Never Never we has
struck at last," observed Emu Bill, with quiet assurance. "Nary man
ever knew what to expect in this here country; but we has struck
the secret, only poor old Dave ain't with us no more."</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the expedition had reached a region of
strange mystery in the heart of the great unknown land of the Never
Never. Their humble repast over, there now came the sad duty of
interring the body of their dead comrade. Silently they filed off,
armed with pick and shovel, in search of a soft spot in which to
dig the grave. But no kindly soil was to be found; the bare rock
appeared everywhere immediately below the surface.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing we can do," said Mackay. "We must drill
and shoot a hole down wi' gelignite, that is, unless we carry poor
Dave out across these springs into the desert, but for my part I'd
rather bury him close into the mountain. I think he would have
liked it himself. Let us give poor old Dave a big monument, boys,
I'm sure none o' us will grudge the work."</p>

<p>Grudge the work? Not they. It was the last tribute they could
pay to the faithful and brave companion of their travels, and with
heavy hearts they set about their task. A case of gelignite had
been included in the outfit of the expedition in anticipation of
any valuable ore deposits being found which might necessitate
blasting before samples could be obtained, and now for the first
time the deadly explosive was called into requisition, and for a
most melancholy purpose. The long steel drills which had done such
good work in the Golden Promise Mine were also called into play,
and all forenoon Mackay and Emu Bill laboured at their sad work,
relieved occasionally by Jack, the Shadow, and Bob, for though the
last two were then wholly unfitted for any exertion, they insisted
on taking their turn, Bob swinging the great hammer with his one
free hand, while the Shadow held and turned the drill. At every
half hour or so the mighty roar of an explosion would burst forth
from the rocky excavation, and a hail of boulders and showers of
iron sand were hurled into the air.</p>

<p>In the midst of this turmoil Bob happened to look up, and he was
scarcely surprised to see the same gloomy figure on the mountain
summit watching their operations intently.</p>

<p>"I can understand his warning now," he muttered to himself. "He
knew they were going to attack us from the tunnel. But why should
he have wished to save us?"</p>

<p>The more he considered the matter the more puzzled he became.
Then he observed quite a number of the oddly garbed natives join
their companion on the hilltop. Again and again the dull boom of
the heavy gelignite charges echoed out on the still air, and after
each ponderous report a fresh group seemed to gather up aloft until
Bob could count fully fifty of them.</p>

<p>"I reckon this here circus sort o' disturbs them," grunted Emu
Bill.</p>

<p>Mackay looked anxious. "I hope there's no more o' them," he
remarked gravely. "We've struck a bigger-sized tribe than we
calculated on, Bill, an' we'll have to be vera cautious."</p>

<p>At last the tomb was completed and reverently they wrapped the
dead man in his blanket and carried him to his last earthly rest.
No tears now dimmed their eyes, their sorrow was deep set in the
heart; it had passed the mere emotional stage, and could find
relief only in strenuous action. Then they stood around the open
grave with bowed heads, while Mackay repeated a brief prayer. Long
afterwards Bob remembered the quiet dignity of his utterance, the
simple eloquence of his tribute, and the whole pathetic scene would
return to him with all its overwhelming memories. When he had
finished, they shovelled in the loose sand and rubble in solemn
silence, and built up a cairn over the top.</p>

<p>The natives from their position of vantage had gazed stolidly
down on them throughout the entire ceremonial; but now they
dispersed, leaving but one solitary watcher on the height.</p>

<p>"We'll have to plant these natives now," said Mackay; "we can't
leave them lying like that."</p>

<p>They walked over and surveyed the bodies again, and the Shadow
taking the long opossum robe from one of them, threw it over his
own shoulders with a chuckle of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I reckon this here ornament should just fit me," said he,
turning round for inspection.</p>

<p>Emu Bill laughed hoarsely. "Throw the wretched thing away,
Shad," he growled. "Ye doesn't want to wear a nig's wardrobe, does
ye?"</p>

<p>But a wild idea had just then entered Mackay's head; he bent
down and gathered several of the emu feathers lying around; these
he stuck in the Shadow's hair much to that youth's disgust.</p>

<p>"Why, Shad, if your face was blacked you'd pass for one of the
warriors!" exclaimed Jack, noting the effect at once.</p>

<p>"We'll save these decorations for future use," said Mackay,
quietly.</p>

<p>Emu Bill whistled softly, "I never thought o' that," said he. "I
reckon it's a real daisy idea."</p>

<p>Quickly they despoiled the natives of their gorgeous trappings,
and Bob sighed when the miserable bodies were revealed in all their
savage nakedness, and marvelled at the unusual muscular development
showing in their chest and limbs.</p>

<p>"Ay, Bob," said Mackay, guessing his thoughts, "one of these
fellows is worth two of any other tribe, I ken. Somehow, though I
have a sair grudge against them, I feel sort o' sorry to see such
bonnie specimens slaughtered."</p>

<p>"But I reckon they would have danced round our funeral all
right," said Emu Bill, savagely. "Hang it, the nigs in this here
country ain't fit to live, they ain't."</p>

<p>"There are no opossums about here, are there?" asked Jack,
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Nary one," answered Emu Bill, with a laugh. "Why, they couldn't
live on sand, an' there ain't no trees around that a muskittie
couldn't bend by sitting on them."</p>

<p>"Then where could these skins come from?" cried the lad.</p>

<p>Bob shook his head dubiously, and Emu Bill seemed to have
thought of the matter for the first time. Mackay alone seemed
confident in his knowledge.</p>

<p>"It's a sure proof, Jack," said he, "that beyond the mountain
there must be a different kind o' country, a country o' forests and
rivers, maybe, and our Eldorado."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch15"></a>Chapter 15. The Secret of the Mountain</h2>

<p>It was well into the afternoon before their gruesome task was
accomplished, and the sun shone far down in the Western sky when
they returned to the camp. They had carried the deceased warriors
out into the sandy tracts beyond the boiling springs. It cannot be
said that they were unduly sympathetic with the slain, and
certainly they were anything but enamoured of their self-imposed
contract, but the alternative would have been extremely
disagreeable.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt their brethren would have come for them
to-night," said Bob, "and saved us a good deal of trouble&mdash;if
we could only have depended on them going peaceably away
again."</p>

<p>"Ay, if," agreed Mackay, dryly. "But their coming would only
mean more funerals, Bob, and as for that, I believe they've been
trying to force that patent door of theirs before now."</p>

<p>He turned and gazed towards the fissure at the base of the
mountain, and at that moment there distinctly came a sound
therefrom as of the jarring of rocks under pressure. They all kept
perfect silence for a minute or two, and again the sound was
repeated, but this time it was succeeded by the sharp rattle of
falling boulders.</p>

<p>"That's the top o' our barricade down, I reckon," whispered the
Shadow, reaching gingerly for his rifle.</p>

<p>"They would see us go out into the plains," hazarded Bob,
calmly, "but the smoke of these very convenient boilers has kept
them from noticing our return."</p>

<p>Mackay nodded. "They've got about a solid ton to shift before
the door will swing," he said musingly. "Now I wonder if we should
go an' help them wi' the job or no'?"</p>

<p>"I reckon we has had enough for one day, Mac," answered Emu
Bill, wearily. "Let the skunks work their own passage."</p>

<p>Another rattle, louder than the first, reached their ears.</p>

<p>"'Pears to me they is in a mighty hurry," grinned the
Shadow.</p>

<p>Bob rose to his feet. "I'm going to have a look," he said. "Come
on, Jack;" and they tip-toed over to the origin of the
disturbances, leaving their companions apparently deeply and solely
intent on bringing the billy on the fire to a boil speedily.</p>

<p>Mackay had examined the barricade once or twice earlier in the
day, and noticed no change in its appearance, and was convinced
that nothing short of gelignite cartridges could shift their
obstruction from the inside. Bob held the same opinion, but he was
nevertheless curious to see what sort of efforts were being made.
Making a short <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, they silently approached the
entrance to the underground passage from the side farthest from the
movable rocky slab. The interstice had been well-nigh filled with
diorite boulders, leaving only the top of the solid panel showing;
but when Bob looked now, he was alarmed to find a considerable
shrinkage in the level of the barricade, and though the noisy
echoes of falling rocks were still plainly heard, it was evident
that nothing was rolling down from the top of the pile. Jack drew a
quick breath of anxiety; Bob was perplexed beyond measure, but he
made no sign, and as he looked, behold! the boulder stack was
gradually, yet surely, sinking&mdash;sinking apparently into the
earth beneath. Then his eye noticed some slight change in the
position of the rocking wall; it was thrust up somewhat, and gaped
widely. The solution of the mystery was now made clear: the great
slab moved upwards as well as outwards, and the depletion of the
pile was taking place from the bottom; the rock fragments were
rolling inwards to the tunnel!</p>

<p>Hastily he beckoned on his companions, and they came forward at
a run, just as the last stone was disappearing from view. But the
natives had now taken alarm. There came a dull thud as the doorway
relapsed into its accustomed place, and then their rapidly
retreating footsteps were heard as they scurried back into the
subterranean channel, and the peculiar tapping of the night before
heralded the direction of their flight.</p>

<p>Mackay took in the position at a glance, and an expression of
grave concern settled on his features.</p>

<p>"Their resources are positively marvellous," he groaned in
despair. "It's a vera fortunate thing, Bob, that you werena
influenced by my stupid over-confidence, and came to investigate.
We might have been bowled over wi' their arrows before we had time
to lift a rifle." He continued bitterly to abuse himself while he
inspected the now bare cavity in the mountain.</p>

<p>"I reckon it's a long sight more fortunate that they came along
in the daytime," commented Emu Bill, "which they likely wouldn't
have done, if they had thought we were about. Seems to me, that
good Samaritan job o' ours in planting them nigs nice and
comfortable out in the sand has done us a service right away."</p>

<p>"You've hit it pretty near, Bill," Bob agreed. "If they had done
that trick in the night, we should probably have been wiped
out."</p>

<p>"This is a mighty unpleasant climate for us tender lambs, it
is," wailed the Shadow. "There's nary night but what we may wake up
wi' a screech an' find ourselves dead."</p>

<p>"There's one way we can block it for good," muttered Mackay,
grimly, "but I'm no vera willing to do it, for it will block us
too, an' I mean to get inside that mountain before I'm a couple o'
days older." He looked towards the gelignite case, lying near where
it had been placed for safety, and his companions knew his plan at
once. "Yes, we may well shoot down a bit o' the mountain big enough
to bar that tunnel safe as a house, but that wouldn't suit us
afterwards."</p>

<p>"If we roll round a few boulders wider than the door itself,
that would keep things pretty safe for a night," suggested Jack;
and in the end, this was the plan decided upon, and for half an
hour they busied themselves transporting the most unwieldy diorite
blocks they could find, and fixing them securely into the cavity.
Then they returned to partake of their well-earned and belated
dinner of tea and damper.</p>

<p>The last added proof of the blacks' ingenuity considerably
disturbed the members of the little party. It had been so hard to
believe that aborigines could possibly have constructed the tunnel
through the mountain, but now they were inclined to imagine their
savage neighbours capable of anything.</p>

<p>"I reckon we has got to go slow, boys," remarked Emu Bill, with
a troubled expression; "them nigs don't seem to be the genuine
article. They knows a long sight too much for my liking, they
does."</p>

<p>Mackay, too, was obviously concerned. The mysterious tunnel
mystified him; he could not imagine how it had been wrought, but
there was gradually dawning in him a vastly increased respect for
the natives who lived beyond the mountain. That they were different
from all other tribes he had encountered was only too evident. The
question was, in how great a degree did they excel their brethren
of the plains? Judging from his brief experience of them, Mackay's
estimate of their powers was far higher than he cared to admit.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, in answer to Emu Bill, "if the country on
the other side is what we expect, the natives will be of a much
more advanced class than any we've met before. You see, it's the
power o' environment, Bill; it may have worked marvels here, for a'
we know."</p>

<p>They ate their unpalatable meal without much further remark.
Then Bob, who had been pondering deeply over the events of the last
twenty-four hours, showed the trend of his thoughts by asking
quietly if any of the aboriginal tribes had been known to use bows
and arrows.</p>

<p>"I never saw, nor heard tell o' such a thing before," grunted
Emu Bill.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Bob, "these natives show that they have
originated that custom here, or have retained it from an earlier
period, before the blacks began to degenerate; and, in either case,
it proves them to be an exceptional lot altogether."</p>

<p>"That's just what's bothering me, Bob," admitted Mackay. "We
might well tackle an ordinary tribe, even though we only numbered
five against fifty, but wi' these beggars here, I'll allow we seem
to be embarking on a job that is, to say the least of it, a bit
unhealthy. No, no, don't think I'm gettin' nervous, Bill, but we
must calculate the chances before we start. Bob counted fifty
niggers on the hill this morning, so we've a fair idea o' what we
are goin' to run up against."</p>

<p>"Hang it, boss," complained the Shadow; "you doesn't think a
crowd o' nigs is goin' to hustle us back now, does ye? If we kin
join their happy family in the daytime we'll scatter 'em quick an'
lively, but the night gives me the creeps, it does. I can never see
the sights o' my rifle in the dark."</p>

<p>"If we were once on the other side of the mountain," said Jack,
eagerly, "we could soon shift the blacks; it's the wretched old
tunnel that keeps worrying us here."</p>

<p>"Ay, my lad," said Mackay, dryly; "the tunnel is a vera curious
construction for a crowd o' aborigines to make, an' the more I
think about it, the more puzzled I become. I was going to suggest
that Bill an' me should force the passage in the morning, while the
three o' you waited out by the camels in case o' accident."</p>

<p>"I'm right wi' you there," cried Emu Bill. "I reckon it ain't
safe for these here young 'uns to come along wi' us
first&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A storm of protest greeted his words, and Bob turned to Mackay
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," he said; "but neither Jack nor I will
leave unless we all leave together, so that if anything happened to
you we would not escape in any case. Isn't it far better to make
the most of our strength instead of dividing it?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, perhaps you are right," returned the big man,
hastily, as if annoyed at his own fears; "but we'd better wait
until morning before we start the circus. Like the Shadow, I prefer
to meet the natives in daylight, and anyhow, we're a' needing a
sleep to-night, so we'd be better to turn in early and get up by
sunrise. It should take us a good half-hour in the morning blowing
out that tunnel door for a start."</p>

<p>Certainly nothing further could be done on that day, for the
darkness was already closing in, and each one of the party was
weary and tired from lack of sleep. So shortly afterwards they lay
down in their blankets, though not before a searching examination
had been made of the new barricade erected at the entrance to the
subterranean passage, and, in spite of the known dangers
surrounding them, they slept soundly, each taking a two hours'
watch in turn. It was well after midnight when Bob awoke for the
first time, and at once his ears caught the strange tapping in the
mountain which had first heralded the approach of the natives on
the night before. He aroused himself immediately, and saw Mackay,
who was on guard, listening to the ghostly echoes intently. Slowly
they seemed to pass along the base of the hill, then all was quiet.
Bob got up and joined Mackay, and together they walked softly
towards the fissure, and there in the dull light they could vaguely
see the great boulders move as if under pressure from beneath, but
though they watched for fully ten minutes in silence, the barricade
remained intact. Jack's scheme had worked admirably. Then Mackay
turned on his heel with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"It's just as well to let them ken we're here, Bob," he
explained; and the sound of scurrying footsteps which answered him
from the concealed passage showed that the natives had thought fit
to retire once more. Then again the peculiar tapping issued out
dully from the great rock, continuing for nearly a minute before it
faded into the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it, Bob?" asked Mackay.</p>

<p>Bob did not hesitate a moment. "The passage must lead for some
distance along the face of the mountain," said he. "But why these
strange sounds are heard every time the blacks come along, I cannot
say."</p>

<p>"Man, Bob," laughed Mackay, "that's vera easily explained. The
tunnel must be dark, of course, and the warriors have to guide
themselves along the passage by feeling the walls wi' their arrows
or clubs as they go. It just struck me that that was the reason o'
the uncanny noises when I heard them come along there to-night.
Simple enough, isn't it, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad there is nothing approaching the supernatural about
it, anyhow," replied Bob, soberly. "The echoes seemed to ring in my
ears like a knell of doom."</p>

<p>He shuddered as he got back into his blanket. The others were
awake by this time; but when they learned that an ineffective
attempt had been made to destroy the barricade, they chuckled in
rare good-humour, and went off to sleep again. The remainder of the
night passed without alarm, and the morning broke, calm and serene,
over the little camp, which awoke to life with renewed vigour after
its peaceful slumber. Breakfast was soon over; then a hurried
council of war was held to reason out the best plan of action. Emu
Bill was in favour of inserting a heavy charge of gelignite in the
rocking panel which had defied their gentler efforts on the
preceding day; and Jack and the Shadow supported this proposal
vociferously. Mackay, however, though he had at first advocated
this drastic action, now seemed reluctant to carry it through; and
Bob, too, though he did not say much, was evidently pondering over
some other and better scheme, which he at last broached
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"If the passage runs parallel with the face of the mountain for
twenty or thirty yards," he said, "it strikes me that if we made a
fresh entrance to it as far away from the old one as possible, we
could deceive the natives most completely, and perhaps provide a
means of escape in an emergency."</p>

<p>"I don't quite catch on," grumbled Emu Bill. "I'm hanged if I
see what difference it should make; an' we doesn't know how far
we'd have to dig into the blasted rock afore we hit the
tunnel&mdash;if it's where you say."</p>

<p>Mackay took up a pick, and, proceeding along the base of the
mountain away from the fissure, struck at the rocky wall
repeatedly, with the result that a deep, hollow rumbling issued
forth at each stroke, until a point had been reached some thirty
yards distant from the tunnel entrance, when only the solid diorite
formation gave back the sound.</p>

<p>"I calculate we'd have less than five feet to drive, Bill," said
he. "About a couple o' long shots in from the top would do it. You
can trace the passage as plainly as if you were looking at it. I
don't know what the idea was in making it like a boomerang; but
we'll soon find out. Now, Bob, you're better at explaining than me.
Try an' convince Bill o' the advantages we may derive from making a
new hole into the mountain."</p>

<p>"I reckon I can see it all right," cried the Shadow. "Oh, it are
a daisy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Shad," growled Emu Bill. "Now, Bob, for any sake, tell
me your plan. Of course I'm with you, whether I understand or not;
but, blow me if I can see the force o' doing extra work in the
niggers' mountain fur nothin'."</p>

<p>Then Bob endeavoured to elucidate the ideas which had been
taking shape in his brain all through the night, since Mackay and
he had come to a conclusion as to the origin of the warning sounds
and the proximity of the passage for some distance to the outer
air.</p>

<p>"If we don't tamper with the old door, boys," said he,
earnestly, "we can block up the hole we make by some bagging, and
so will always have a chance of escape if the natives are too many
for us. They will guard their own entrance only, for they probably
will never see ours; and it's just as well to take precautions. The
darkness of the tunnel will help our plan; and if we succeed
without having to trouble about getting back, so much the
better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And there are a few more arguments in favour o' the scheme,
Bob," added Mackay; "but we may see the excellence o' them
later."</p>

<p>"But they'll hear us firing the charges, won't they?" said
Jack.</p>

<p>"They heard us doing the same thing yesterday," answered Mackay;
"an' they saw us too, so it's no vera likely they'll trouble us
to-day. But if we put the drill-holes in deep enough, and give the
powder plenty work to do, there shouldna be much noise&mdash;in
fact, I doubt if they'll hear it at a'."</p>

<p>No time was lost in making the experiment, and the long steel
drills were quickly grinding their way through the hard outer
casing of the rock as nearly as could be judged opposite the place
where the passage took an abrupt turn inwards. And now the mining
knowledge of Mackay and Emu Bill made their work comparatively
easy; they knew exactly the correct angles at which to drive the
drills so as to obtain the best results when they loaded the holes
so made with the deadly explosive. Steadily they laboured at their
task, Bob, Jack, and the Shadow assisting at intervals, but more
often engaged farther out in the open making a goodly appearance
for the benefit of the natives, should they chance to be watching,
and thus drawing attention away from the great work in hand. For a
full hour Mackay slogged at the steel with his mighty hammer, then
gradually the borings extracted from the deepening hole grew
lighter and redder in colour, and the drill sank inwards
rapidly.</p>

<p>"That's a new formation we've struck, Bill," said he, pausing to
examine the edge of his tool. Then an exclamation broke from his
lips. "We're chippin' through a gold lode!" he cried; "and it's so
rich that the drill clogs in the metal."</p>

<p>"I reckon there's nary nig'll shift us from here now," said Emu
Bill, examining for himself the gold grains exposed. "I means to
see the other side o' this here mountain, or bust. I reckon there
must be oceans o' gold an' di'monds over there."</p>

<p>At this stage Jack called out warningly, "I see old
Nebuchadnezzar on the top of the mountain again."</p>

<p>"It's the same old nig that we didn't shoot," exclaimed the
Shadow; "an', blow me! if he ain't goin' to throw stones at
us."</p>

<p>The tall figure on the summit had certainly attempted to throw
something down; but it caught on a jutting rock overhead, and
bounded thence into the rising vapours of the hot springs. Once
more he appeared to cast some projectile into the air; but if he
did, it did not reach the ground in the vicinity of the anxious
party beneath. Then again a visible missile came hurtling down; but
it fell wide, much to the Shadow's satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The old fool can't throw stones for nuts!" he cried
delightedly.</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll hurt us much," said Mackay, with a laugh.
"Let him play away, Shadow, if it amuses him; it doesn't do us any
damage."</p>

<p>And the individual aloft continued his strange pranks for some
time, though in no one instance did the stones he threw alight even
moderately near; then he vanished as suddenly as he had come.</p>

<p>"I think we're about ready for firing, Bill," said Mackay,
shortly afterwards. "We'd better hurry up, too, seeing that there
does not seem to be any one about to watch in the mean time."</p>

<p>The drill had been driven over eight feet down, at an angle of
somewhat less than forty-five degrees, and Bob, making a rough
calculation, considered that its extremity was at least four feet
away from the surface of the rock in a straight line.</p>

<p>"We'll give it twenty-five cartridges, I think," mused Mackay,
"an' the shock o' discharge should burst at least another foot
inwards."</p>

<p>"I reckon something's bound to shift," murmured Emu Bill, as he
deftly prepared the charges, and inserted the long fuse.</p>

<p>Bob watched the last operation with quiet interest, but not so
Jack and the Shadow. They suddenly pranced off towards the cooking
utensils by the fire, and began to drag them back out of range.</p>

<p>"Tea and damper is bad enough," groaned the Shadow, tenderly
secreting the only two billy cans the expedition possessed; "but
damper without tea would be howlin' starvation, it would."</p>

<p>"You doesn't need to worry, Shad," grinned Emu Bill. "There
won't be much o' a scatter here."</p>

<p>And he calmly applied a lighted match to the end of the fuse,
and stood for almost a minute, listening to its sputtering as the
fire crept slowly down towards the gelignite, before he turned
away. Another minute, two minutes, three minutes passed.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we've had a misfire, Bill," said Mackay.</p>

<p>But just as he spoke the base of the mountain seemed to quiver
and burst forward, then came a dull report, and when the smoke
cleared away, a giant crack showed in the rock, but otherwise no
evidences were left to indicate that a powerful explosive had been
at work.</p>

<p>"That's hard lines," said Emu Bill, stepping forward. "It might
have shifted that chunk o' iron out o' the road, anyway. Now we'll
need to begin all over again."</p>

<p>"I'm no so sure o' that," answered Mackay, waving his hat in the
rent created in order to dispel the clinging white fumes, which
obscured all vision.</p>

<p>Then it was made apparent that it was no mere crack in the
formation they gazed upon. The force of explosion has not only
cleft the rock, but had thrust it almost a yard forward in one
unbroken mass, and at the bottom of the chasm thus made a vague
blackness appeared, the blackness of a void. Mackay bent down his
head eagerly, but hastily withdrew it again; a rush of heavy damp
air, stifling and odorous, had come with a gust in his face.</p>

<p>"I reckon them powder fumes'll make you feel pretty bad,"
sympathized Emu Bill. "Just give the smoke time to clear, Mac, an'
then we'll put in another shot."</p>

<p>"There's no need to do any more work here, Bill," answered
Mackay, recovering himself. "We've broken right into the tunnel
first pop! There it is, too, as natural-looking an entrance as you
could wish to see, wi' a door&mdash;if we could move it&mdash;that
weighs five tons if it weighs a pound."</p>

<p>Eagerly they all clustered round to look; and now that the
atmosphere had grown less clouded, the dark shadows of the cavern
below were plainly discernible. Bob gave a sigh of relief. At last
the secret of the mountain was to be revealed.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon I'd better get down an' prospect round a bit,"
said Emu Bill, hitching up his nether garments preparatory to
scrambling down into the uncertain depths.</p>

<p>"Let me go first," urged the Shadow. "I'm the lightest, and it
wouldn't hurt me much if I did go down a bit further than I
expected when I let go the edge."</p>

<p>"We'll lower a rope wi' a stone on the end o' it before any one
goes down," said Mackay, firmly. "We've got to engineer this
funeral vera cautiously, my lad, an' mustna go bouncing ourselves
into difficulties, as if there was a good fairy waiting by us every
time to pull us out o' them."</p>

<p>A rope was speedily forthcoming, and fastening a fragment of
rock to the end of it, Mackay carefully allowed it to descend. It
came to a standstill in good time, however, showing that the bottom
of the passage was barely three feet below the point where the rent
had entered its wall. Mackay quickly proceeded to adjust the rope
so that its extremity dangled just on the edge of the yawning gap,
then he made it fast on the outside by coiling it several times
round the top of the sundered rock.</p>

<p>"A man could pull himself out in a hurry by getting something to
hold on to," he remarked, "an' it's just as well to be
prepared."</p>

<p>This operation completed, Emu Bill wriggled himself down through
the narrow opening, and holding on to the guiding-rope, quickly
disappeared from view, while his companions on the surface waited
expectantly for his report on his surroundings.</p>

<p>"Well, an' what do you make of it, Bill?" demanded Mackay, when
the tension on the cable had slackened.</p>

<p>"I can't see a single thing," came the response. "It's dark
as&mdash;as Hades, an'&mdash;howlin' blazes! but it does
smell."</p>

<p>Without a word Mackay slid down beside his complaining comrade;
the Shadow followed, then Jack, and lastly Bob squirmed down beside
them. All was dark and oppressively gloomy in the strange passage,
and the thin streak of light from the opening they themselves had
made, only served to intensify the utter blackness which prevailed.
They stood for a full minute without speaking, their ears alert for
the slightest sound which might warn them of danger; but all was
silent as a tomb.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," whispered Mackay, "we'll have a look at the inside
o' that other doorway before we go any further." He led the way,
staggering and stumbling, and Bob, following at his heels, became
conscious that the floor of the tunnel was extremely muddy and wet.
After a few steps Mackay paused. "I've got a bit o' candle in my
pocket," he said; "I may as well strike a light."</p>

<p>The match spluttered feebly in his hand for a moment, and then
went out, but on a second attempt he succeeded in getting the
candle alight, and though it burned with a dismal blue flame, it
illuminated the rocky cavern sufficiently for the adventurers to
observe its structure.</p>

<p>They stood in a longitudinal chamber about eight feet high, and
barely four in width. The roof fairly scintillated with beaded
moisture, and the dank, cold walls were adrip with ooze. The bottom
of the chamber, as they had already discovered, was a soft and
clinging clayey formation. Mackay's trained eye immediately grasped
the significance of the scene.</p>

<p>"This is a most extraordinary thing to find in the heart o'
Australia," he said. "It's a tunnel driven through an enormous gold
lode, an' it's vera evident that the men who made it knew almost
nothing about mining, for the ore hasn't been stripped either to
the hanging wall or foot wall. It's just as if a blind gap had been
dug into the country where it was softest."</p>

<p>"I see a nugget shining in the roof," whispered Jack, pointing
to a yellow splatch showing overhead.</p>

<p>"Ay, my lad, an' I can see several more," said Mackay, surveying
the exposed stratum in bewilderment. "It is a wonderful mine,
without a doubt, but what on earth the natives do with it is more
than I can imagine."</p>

<p>He moved onwards once more, and then he halted suddenly, and
held the candle aloft. The passage had come to an end; before him
stood the huge stone panel which had first barred their entrance;
at his feet gaped a deep, pit-like cavity.</p>

<p>"Come close up here, Bob," he said quietly. "Come an' have a
look at this arrangement o' things; primitive but effective,
eh?"</p>

<p>Bob gazed at the sight before him in absolute wonderment. The
great stone which marked the end of the chamber stood upright on an
egg-shaped base; it appeared to be formed like a rude and bluff
wedge, the wider extremity protruding outwards, where, as had been
seen, it flanged neatly on to the main rock from which it had
sprung. But it was not its shape that surprised Bob: a massive bar
of some gleaming metal was welded into it fully halfway up its
height, and from this U-shaped bar a rope of extraordinary girth
stretched taut into the depths of the pit, where it could be seen
attached to a ponderous mass of diorite rock, which hung from it
like the weight of a giant clock.</p>

<p>"They probably always come in force when they use this passage,"
mused Bob; "and see, I suppose that arrangement is for keeping the
stone bent over when they are out?"</p>

<p>He pointed to a short and stout log lying near, which had
apparently been used for preventing a quick rush back of the
weighted panel when the warriors had gone out on the night of the
conflict. Mackay stepped gingerly across the intervening shaft, and
shone his light into its unsavoury depths as he did so.</p>

<p>"I see now where our boulder barricade dropped to," he said;
"but I can see also that they can never move our present
obstruction in the same way, the big blocks outside will stick
them, no matter how they try."</p>

<p>Emu Bill now tried to find his speech. "How in thunder is we to
account for the rock prizing open wi' us at first?" said he. "I
can't understand this here concern yet, I can't."</p>

<p>Bob pointed downwards to where the wall of the pit was deeply
scarred and dented.</p>

<p>"Likely enough the weight caught in the side," he said, "and so
eased off the tension considerably."</p>

<p>Mackay, who had been keenly scrutinizing the rope and the stout
bar in the stone to which it was connected, now lifted his
head.</p>

<p>"The rope is made o' a grass which doesn't grow on our side o'
the mountain, boys," he said; "but the bar is fashioned out o' a
metal which is known to all of us, though we've never managed to
possess it in sufficient quantities to throw away on a job like
this, where simple iron would be far stronger and better in every
way."</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Emu Bill. "You doesn't mean to say that they've
stuck a chunk o' gold in that there stone, does ye?"</p>

<p>"I just do," answered Mackay, wearily. "Now, I think we'd better
get out and think over things for a bit. Two or three shocks o'
that sort would just about destroy my nervous system
altogether."</p>

<p>"But you ain't goin' to leave that bonanza in the rock, surely?"
cried the Shadow. "Let me get one tug at it, boss, I'll pretty soon
yank it out, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here his companions gently but firmly led him away.</p>

<p>"There's bound to be lots more of it lying around," said Jack,
soothingly, as they retraced their steps.</p>

<p>When they reached the exit the light of the candle showed them
that the tunnel here swung off to the left at a right angle, and at
this point the passage was considerably wider than they had at
first judged, probably owing to the difficulty the natives had
experienced in making such a sharp turn. But the eye could
distinguish nothing beyond the radius of the feeble illumination;
all was oppressively murky and damp and repellent.</p>

<p>"That's our road, boys," said Mackay, pointing with his candle
into the gloomy cavern which led into the heart of the mountain.
"But before we start on our journey we'll get out an' make our
final arrangements, an' change our wardrobe to suit the
situation."</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were all on the surface once more, eagerly
talking over their prospects, for, strangely enough, the dangerous
aspect of their projected journey through the mountain was for the
moment lost on them, so completely had the glamour of the golden
tunnel exercised its subtle influence. Mackay, however, quickly
regained his control.</p>

<p>"We must remember, boys," he cautioned, "that we have no
ordinary natives to contend with, an' before we leave this camp it
will be necessary to attend to some details which may be helpful to
us afterwards."</p>

<p>"What would you suggest?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"In the first instance," Mackay replied, "we should hide the
camel-packs containing our provisions. We can easily do that out
among the sand on the other side o' the springs. It won't take us
half an hour altogether."</p>

<p>"But what about the camels?" interjected Jack.</p>

<p>"They are a good distance away, my lad, an' they're no' hobbled.
They'll just have to take their chance; but I don't think there's
much risk in that direction, after all, for Misery can't stand the
sight o' a nigger, an' if he bolted, the rest would follow, an' we
could track them up afterwards just as I had to do before in this
same district."</p>

<p>It was yet early in the day, and though Emu Bill was loath to
delay their tour of discovery even for five minutes, he was brought
to see the wisdom of Mackay's advice. Within half an hour the camp
had assumed a bare and desolate appearance, only the heavier mining
implements being left at the base of the mountain. Then they
gathered round the cleft in the rock, and hurriedly prepared for
their work of subterranean exploration. It had been agreed that the
party should don the robes of the deceased warriors in order to
lessen the chances of detection should any natives be encountered
while traversing the mysterious passage, but now they saw that
whereas there were five persons to transform into savages, there
were but four of the long furry coverings, although the feathered
decorations for completing their sartorial equipment were more
numerous than necessary.</p>

<p>"I believe I saw one o' them 'possum robes in the pit, aside the
hanging rock," said Emu Bill, reflectively. "I'll go an' get it in
a jiff."</p>

<p>He disappeared into the recess immediately, and Bob heard him
feeling his way back towards the old entrance, muttering and
grumbling against the awkward nature of the dismal, muddy track at
each floundering step. Then for a brief space all was still.</p>

<p>"A bit o' charcoal rubbed over the face an' neck will make us
more nigger-like, I'm thinkin'," laughed Mackay, as he surveyed
himself with rueful gaze.</p>

<p>It was no sooner said than done. Jack rushed over to the
smouldering fire, and came back with a handful of charred embers,
and with these they smeared their faces and hands plentifully.</p>

<p>"An' I reckon we won't want our boots," grunted the Shadow,
discarding his almost soleless shoes, and rolling up the legs of
his much-frayed nether garments.</p>

<p>"That's right, Shadow," said Mackay; "you make a grand nigger,
an' I only hope I don't mistake you in the dark for a real warrior,
an' slaughter you in error."</p>

<p>Bob and Jack, when they had finished their toilet, looked their
part to the life; but when Mackay's towering bulk was arrayed and
besplatched to his satisfaction, he seemed the most fearsome object
imaginable, a formidable-looking savage indeed.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder what's keeping Bill?" broke out Jack, impatiently.
"This rock here is burning my feet terribly."</p>

<p>"He'll be tryin' to wrench off that bit o' gold from the big
stone," remarked the Shadow, with assurance. "I reckon I'll go down
an' help him."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing o' the kind," said Mackay, firmly, laying a
restraining hand on the youth's shoulder. "We've got something else
to do in the meantime, my lad. Bill will be gropin' in the dark for
that nigger dress, an' he'll be here in a minute."</p>

<p>The Shadow's feeble smile at being intercepted in his desire to
possess the treasure he so much coveted looked so malevolent on his
besmeared features, that Jack could not forbear a hearty laugh.
Then Bob gave a gasp of dismay.</p>

<p>"I can hear natives coming through the passage!" he said. "What
are we to do about Bill?"</p>

<p>The vague echoes of shuffling movements were now quite plainly
heard, and still there was no sign from Emu Bill; probably he had
not yet become aware of the ominous sounds, or perhaps he was, as
the Shadow had suggested, too much engrossed with a congenial task
to grasp their true significance. With a forceful expression on his
lips Mackay insinuated his muscular form into the gap, and just at
that instant a band of savages swept by him so close that they
almost touched him. Then only it seemed that Emu Bill became
aroused to his danger. A hoarse snarl of rage rang along the
passage, and the sounds of a silent scuffle came to Mackay's ears
as he stood motionless by the exit. With a stifled groan he pulled
himself up, just as the warriors had evidently accomplished their
work.</p>

<p>"Have they killed him too?" whispered Jack, nervously.</p>

<p>Mackay did not trust himself to reply. He motioned Bob to hand
him his rifle, and he was sliding back into the passage with a
vengeful rage in his heart when a stentorian call from Emu Bill
made him pause.</p>

<p>"I'm not dead, boys," he cried, "but they've got me trussed up
like a prize fowl, an' I don't know what they're goin' to do wi'
me. Block the light, or they'll see where I came in, an' don't try
to save me now, for there's over a score o' the skunks. It'll be
all right, boys, all right. Ye are a pack of miserable, sneakin',
howlin' gorillas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The last phrase, which was continued at some length, was
obviously destined for his captors as they bore him along. It was
evident that Bill had suffered no serious hurt at their hands, and
his warning showed that, even under such exceptionally trying
circumstances, he was not unmindful of the welfare of his comrades,
who would assuredly have been overcome had they descended to his
assistance. The bushman's chivalric self-abnegation however would
not have deterred Mackay from taking long odds at a work of rescue,
but in the gloom of the cavern such action would have been futile,
or perhaps worse, because any shots fired at random might just as
easily kill Emu Bill as any one else, and the resultant chaos could
only end in one way. So Bill was led away by the savage band, who
gave vent to their satisfaction by sending forth shrill, unmusical
shouts, which rang through the vaulted chamber like the cries of
demons in torment. They passed by the gap in the wall which
Mackay's bulk covered without a moment's pause, and marched slowly
on into the heart of the mountain.</p>

<p>When at last all discordant sounds had died away, Mackay aroused
himself with alacrity; but when his gaze fell upon the despondent
countenances of his companions, he could not forbear a smile; their
dusky aspect and warrior-like trappings agreed ill with their
sorrowful visages.</p>

<p>"Now, my young savages," he cried, "try an' look less miserable.
We've got to get through the mountain somehow now, for I won't
leave Bill over there on his own. See that you've got plenty of
cartridges, my lads, an' let us go."</p>

<p>"Poor old Bill!" murmured the Shadow, sadly. "It was that darned
chunk o' gold that did it, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Now that they've found some one in the tunnel," said Bob,
wearily, "they'll most likely come back to set a guard over the
door; and when they find it won't open, they'll look around until
they get this entrance, so that we'll be blocked completely from
getting back."</p>

<p>Mackay was already halfway into the passage, but he climbed out
again quickly on hearing Bob's words.</p>

<p>"You're quite right, Bob," said he, "an' there's only one thing
to do before we start on Bill's trail. I don't like the idea o' it,
but I believe it's the best plan."</p>

<p>They all hurried over to the barricaded entrance of the fissure,
and straightway began to pull aside the great rocks they had placed
there so carefully the night before. Already Mackay's forethought
in hiding the stores of the expedition was about to bear good
fruit. If the blacks came out now, as they undoubtedly would, they
would find nothing to destroy of any importance, and it was
extremely unlikely that the natural-looking crack in the rock
further along the hill would receive their attention; and, even if
it did, the adventurous four would run no more risk than if they
had left the barricaded crevice intact. Mackay calculated much on
the blind, unreasoning ardour of the blacks.</p>

<p>"They won't come out in the daytime if they think we're about,"
said he, grimly, "and in the night they can see nothing, anyhow,
though I hope we haven't to dodge about in that passage for such a
length o' time."</p>

<p>Jack now bethought himself of a brilliant scheme whereby the
purposes of the free exit would be served without danger of the
blacks profiting much thereby. He found poor Never Never Dave's
empty rifle lying near, and this he carefully propped up by the aid
of several boulders with the long barrel directed fairly at the
great stone door.</p>

<p>"They'll think there's a man behind the gun," said he, chuckling
in boyish glee, "and whenever they open the concern they'll pop
back again mighty quick."</p>

<p>"It's a vera excellent idea, Jack," approved Mackay. "Now,
surely, we can go our way in peace."</p>

<p>They returned to the rent in the mountain which the explosive
had made, and without further hesitation stepped down into the
depths below, and Mackay, who was the last to descend, dragged with
him a number of empty flour bags with which he effectually screened
the little light which filtered between the sundered rocks. All was
still in the passage as they felt their way cautiously forward,
hugging the walls for guidance, their bare feet plashing in the
oozy mire. Mackay and Bob led the way, each pressing against the
opposite sides of the passage for support. Jack and the Shadow
followed, more secure of their steps, knowing that the way was
proved before them. On, on, they struggled; Bob would have dearly
liked to light a match, but that would have been extremely
foolhardy at such a critical juncture of their pilgrimage, as it
would betray their presence to any aboriginal who might happen to
be lurking near.</p>

<p>Already they seemed to have been an age in the stifling cavern,
though but a few minutes had elapsed since their entry. The tunnel,
as nearly as Bob could judge, had continued on a straight course,
but it was hard to estimate with certainty how great a distance had
been traversed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mackay stopped and clutched Bob's arm in a vice-like
grip.</p>

<p>"There's a hole o' some sort at our feet," he whispered, as the
lad stumbled backwards.</p>

<p>Bob put forward one foot gingerly, but it met with no
resistance; assuredly a dangerous void intervened in their path. In
vain they sought across the full width of the passage for a
foothold; not an inch of solid ground remained, and the clayey
particles dislodged by their essaying footsteps fell down into an
unknown depth, and sundry gurgles and splashes echoed back as they
reached the bottom.</p>

<p>"There's no scarcity o' water there," remarked Mackay; then he
felt over as far as he could reach with his rifle, and at the
utmost limit of his stretch something hard interposed. "It's just
like a shaft cutting down through the lode," he murmured; "but how
the beggars get across it beats me to understand."</p>

<p>"We could take it at a jump, I think," suggested Jack.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we'd slip into the water if we tried, my lad. It's
no' easy gettin' a firm footing in this clay for a start. No, I
think I'll throw the Shadow across first an' he can steady us from
the other side."</p>

<p>"Say, boss," said that individual, plaintively, "I ain't no
flying machine or human bullet. I reckon my tender bones won't get
damaged so much if I jump&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But while they stood thus deliberating as how best to surmount
the difficulty, the dreaded sound of approaching natives fell dully
on their ears. The Shadow uttered a stifled groan and his
rifle-lock clicked under his impetuous fingers. Jack gave a faint
whistle of dismay, and Bob calmly drew and cocked his revolver.
Mackay stood unmoved, straining his eyes into the gloom; then he
gently pressed Bob back close to the wall.</p>

<p>"Hug the side," he whispered; and each one crushed hard against
the slimy rock, and waited.</p>

<p>Pat! pat! pat! came the unwelcome echoes, accompanied by an
occasional splash, as the oncoming band floundered in the mire, and
the direction from which the disturbance came was away decidedly to
the left, although it was speedily altering to a point straight
ahead. Bob noted this fact carefully, despite his alarm.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the unseen band advanced until but a few yards
separated them from the yawning pit. Bob held his breath. Would
they walk blindly into it? Had they miscalculated its position? He
felt Mackay's hand press lightly on his shoulder as if to give him
confidence, and he marvelled at its steadiness, and braced himself
for the encounter he felt sure was about to begin. He could hear
Jack's heart throbbing under the severe tension of the moment, and
the Shadow's quick breaths indicated how trying was the strain even
for that iron-nerved youth. But now came the crucial moment; the
foremost savage shrieked out a guttural word of warning, as it
seemed, and stopped, apparently on the edge of the chasm. A second
later and his feet alighted with a sharp, sliding sound close
opposite Bob, and with a recovering effort he passed on. He was
followed immediately by another and still another warrior, whose
arrows rustled in their hands as they cleared the gulf. If one of
them had slipped there could have been little hope of escape for
the intrepid quartet, for assuredly the slightest stumble would
have sent him right into their arms. But no disaster of the kind
occurred, each wildly-leaping figure arrived safely on the slippery
floorway beside them and lunged forward with the momentum of his
flight, and in this way fifteen warriors passed and proceeded on
their way; then all was quiet again.</p>

<p>Mackay broke the silence. "That was a close shave, my lads,"
said he, coolly. "Now, I wonder if any of you noticed how they got
across so sprightly?"</p>

<p>"I reckon they jumped," grunted the Shadow, "an' I is mighty
pleased they jumped so well."</p>

<p>"It would be a good jump," whispered Bob; "but they cleared it
too easily without a run."</p>

<p>"I think I'll risk lighting a match," said Mackay. "There's a
bend in the tunnel straight forward a bit, so nothing can be seen
past that, an' the niggers that have passed will probably be
dodgin' the barrel o' Never Never's rifle by this time."</p>

<p>A howl of terror from that extremity of the tunnel almost
verified his surmise. Mackay calmly struck a match, held it aloft
for an instant, and blew it out hurriedly, but in that fleeting
moment Bob caught sight of a stout rope suspended from a beam
directly over the pit, and he also observed that at this point the
roof of the tunnel was considerably farther above them than it had
been at the start of their journey. Evidently, greater work of
excavation had been done at this part of the golden lode. Mackay
groped forward and seized the rope, gave it a tug to test its
strength, then swung himself lightly across the obstacle which had
delayed them so long. Bob went next, then Jack and Shadow trusted
their weight to the flying trapeze.</p>

<p>"They might just as well have put a log or two across that
shaft," murmured Mackay.</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon it would be a long sight handier for visitors,"
agreed the Shadow; and they plodded on once more. Slowly, slowly,
they advanced, and now Bob became conscious of a growing change in
the atmosphere; it was surely becoming less and less stifling, and
the overpowering odours which had been with them so long were
gradually dispelling. Round to the left bore Mackay, and Bob
followed, wondering vaguely if the light of the outside world would
soon burst upon them, but no sign of lessening gloom cheered them
on their altered course. Another few minutes passed, then Mackay
stopped with an exclamation of surprise, the solid wall had reared
up before him; they had been following a blind drive!</p>

<p>"I'm certain I heard them coming round this way," he said,
feeling with his hand across the barring rock as if in search of
some clue to the mystery.</p>

<p>"We may have taken a wrong turning," suggested Bob, much
perplexed. Then he missed Jack beside him, and the Shadow too had
disappeared. "They're both gone," he muttered anxiously.</p>

<p>"That shows there must be a branch off somewhere," said Mackay,
cheerily. "They must have been hugging the right wall while we
clutched on to the left. We'll hang in to the right going back,
Bob, an' we'll get back on to the main passage."</p>

<p>And back they went, striving vainly to quell the rising fear in
their hearts, for both were more alarmed than they cared to admit
over the absence of their comrades. At last they reached the
awkward turn, and almost, at the same moment, floundering footsteps
were heard approaching from a new direction, almost continuous with
the line along which they had just returned. Not a word was spoken,
and the two stood motionless at the junction of the ways waiting
for some sign which would indicate to them whether their near
neighbours were friends or foes. And even as they stopped, the
sounds which had attracted their attention ceased abruptly, and for
a short space all was still. But it was only for a short space;
away back in the distance the harsh cries of the returning warriors
thundered along the passage. Apparently they had not ventured out
beyond the mountain, and that knowledge was satisfactory enough,
but what of the new danger which threatened by their retreat? There
was no deep chasm to distract the savages' notice at this point. On
they came, their unmusical voices raised in a droning chant which
might equally well have expressed joy or regret so far as Bob could
make out. Then it suddenly struck him that they would imagine the
white invaders of their domain to be still outside, despite their
capture of Emu Bill in the well-guarded precincts, and were duly
rejoicing in consequence. Over the watery pit they swung, nearer
and nearer they drew. Then out of the deep gloom opposite clicked
the hammer of a rifle, sure evidence that it was Jack and the
Shadow who waited near. But it was too late now to speak, and the
way of safety was unknown. Mackay and Bob pressed backwards whence
they had last come, and the foremost savage almost brushed up
against them as he felt for the wall. Bob's hand was on the trigger
of his revolver ready to fire, but the warrior with a grunt passed
over the entrance to their retreat, and stumbled onwards into the
unexplored darkness ahead. And in this way the invisible band
trooped by, nor did they once pause to investigate the openings on
their left or right.</p>

<p>When they had passed out of hearing, a cautious voice whispered
hoarsely from the darkness&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is ye there, boss? Shout out quick, for I is goin' to
shoot."</p>

<p>"Keep your finger off that trigger, you nervous young rascal,"
responded Mackay, sternly; and at the words the lost pair issued
forth from their hiding, and rejoined their companions.</p>

<p>"It was all owing to our following the right hand wall," Jack
hastened to explain. "We didn't know you weren't with us until we
came to the end."</p>

<p>"Another blind drive," muttered Mackay. "This is getting very
confusing. It's just as well the niggers came back again to show us
the way."</p>

<p>"And it was just as well they came back while we were off the
main track," said Bob; "otherwise we might have had trouble."</p>

<p>Then they moved on along the middle track which they had been
fortunate not to find at first, and for the space of several
minutes not a word was spoken. There was no doubt about the
hazardous nature of the mission on which they were employed; and
Bob smiled grimly to himself as he reckoned up the chances against
them, yet, strangely enough, each member of the expedition seemed
in no wise to consider his own safety, and was fully determined to
meet the best or worst that Fate had in store. A period had come in
their lives when the call of the Unknown was irresistible; and had
this for a moment failed them, the firm desire to rescue Emu Bill
from the clutches of the savages would have sent them steadily
onwards, recklessly ignoring the cost, for the wanderer's creed is
simple and sincere&mdash;he may never forsake a comrade in deadly
peril.</p>

<p>Their progress was painfully slow, for they knew not what
obstacles might lie in their path, and probably it had been a
miscalculation of their own pace that had led Mackay into error,
when he turned into the drive along which he fancied he had heard
the blacks approaching, for now the tunnel was distinctly curving
to the left, and the occasional rush of fresh air which swept into
their faces told them quite plainly that they were on the highway
to the outside world. Slowly, too, the darkness began to merge into
a gloom less and less profound, until the floor and sides of the
cavern they traversed became dimly discernible.</p>

<p>"We won't be long now, my lads," encouraged Mackay.</p>

<p>"I is gettin' mighty nervous," murmured the Shadow, cheerfully.
"I reckon I'll go back home. This ain't no place for a youth o'
tender years, it ain't."</p>

<p>Bob laughed quietly at his companion's happy pessimism, and was
about to make a reply when a faint buzzing sound in the unseen
distance ahead drew his attention. Mackay, too, had heard it, and
he stopped for an instant to listen more intently.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Jack, trying vainly to make out the cause of
the vague noises.</p>

<p>"It's natives&mdash;at a distance, Jack, my lad," said Mackay.
"They're outside the tunnel; so we'll be all right if there's no'
too many o' them. I'm just hoping we've seen the full strength o'
the tribe already."</p>

<p>They resumed their march; and now they had less difficulty in
making progress owing to the continued increase of light, and as
they proceeded the confused babel of voices became more and more
distinct. The tunnel was by this time veering back towards its
original course. Then suddenly a bright light flashed upon them as
through a giant lens. The exit of the tunnel was in sight at last!
Once more Mackay stopped, and was on the point of making some
cautionary remark; but even while he turned the bright circle ahead
was darkened, and several natives entered. A word at that moment
might have proved disastrous, and Bob gripped Mackay's arm just in
time; scarcely twenty yards separated them from their enemies. The
big man hesitated only for a moment, then quickly concealed his
rifle under his long cloak and walked slowly forward, his
companions copying his example without a murmur.</p>

<p>The oncoming warriors were now close beside them; but in the
semi-light of the cavern their dusky faces could not be
distinguished. By this time they had apparently become aware of the
presence of the dauntless four, for they stepped aside to let them
pass, and addressed Mackay in a series of unintelligible
ejaculations&mdash;presumably of inquiry&mdash;to which that
gentleman answered by a non-committal grunt, and strode on his way.
And for the third time within an hour the natives brushed by the
little group, and left them unmolested; but on this occasion it was
the efficacy of their disguise which saved them&mdash;a fact which
made the Shadow effervesce with delight. However, it was yet too
early to rejoice, and Bob and Jack restrained their spirits with an
effort. As for Mackay, he made no sign that anything unusual had
happened, and walked on calmly as before, but a repressed cry of
wonder burst from his lips when he reached the end of the tunnel
and gazed beyond on the land which they had so eagerly sought, and
his companions echoed his cry when they, too, looked on the scene
which lay before them. And little wonder, for their eyes were
drinking in a vision of rare beauty&mdash;it was as if a glimpse of
a tropical paradise had been vouchsafed them. In the near distance
the waters of a crystal lake glistened in the sunshine, and lapped
a coral-white beach, while, fringing its outer edge, and extending
back and upwards, a luxurious forest in miniature lay spread. The
sight was wonderfully cool and exhilarating to the beholders so
long accustomed to the arid desert. Here certainly was no lack of
water, no absence of shade.</p>

<p>But in their first hasty glance at the entrancing picture none
of the watchers had noticed the many bower-like structures which
lined the edge of the abundant foliage; and now Jack drew attention
to this feature of the landscape with some concern.</p>

<p>"There must be quite a population in the valley," said he.</p>

<p>Mackay nodded gravely. "My calculations have been all out," he
remarked in a subdued voice. Then his rage rose again. "But I'll
no' go back," he added fiercely, "until I have avenged my old
comrades. I couldna do it, my lads. But you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will stay with you," interrupted Bob, quietly.</p>

<p>"I reckon something's goin' to happen pretty sudden," grumbled
the Shadow, craning his neck out of the tunnel, and looking all
around anxiously.</p>

<p>The voices which they had heard while in the far back recesses
of the passage reached their ears close beside them, and towards
the right. In their eagerness they had overlooked the near vicinity
while absorbed in contemplation of the tiny lake and forest beyond;
but now the Shadow's gaze rested upon a crouching circle of
warriors less than forty yards from him, and it seemed as if each
gaudily-bedecked native was eyeing the figures at the mouth of the
underground passage with the keenest interest.</p>

<p>"Look, boss," said the Shadow, "they seem to be quite tame. The
critters must have seen us all the time."</p>

<p>Mackay raved silently at his lack of perception, and drawing
back into the recess, examined his rifle, and felt for his
cartridge-belt underneath his furry garb.</p>

<p>"Why," said Bob, "we forget we appear to be savages too; they
won't think there is anything wrong."</p>

<p>But in this conjecture Bob was soon proved to be very much
mistaken. Immediately the Shadow withdrew his head, an animated
discussion appeared to take place among the blacks, and their
voices were raised to an alarming pitch. Bob, though still keeping
in the shade, could see the dusky ring clearly by pressing hard
against the rocky wall on his left, and he noted with dismay the
growing disturbance which followed the advent and withdrawal of his
companion's befeathered cranium.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Bob," said Mackay, coming up beside him, "They
know we are not the genuine article apparently, an' we've got to
fight now whether we will or no."</p>

<p>Yet still no attempt was made on the part of the natives to come
to closer quarters with the intruders, although many had arisen,
bows in hand, as if impatient for the fray.</p>

<p>"There's a curious old chap sitting in the middle," said Jack,
peering out of his shelter; "I wonder if he has anything to do with
their hesitation? He seems to have a lot to say."</p>

<p>Bob looked again, and caught a glimpse of an odd wizened figure
sitting amid the gesticulating warriors, and evidently endeavouring
to restrain their ardour. He had not been observable before, but a
gap made in the circle by the sudden movement of the restless band
had revealed him, as Jack had quickly noticed.</p>

<p>"He must be their king," remarked Mackay; "but it's vera strange
that he should want to delay the circus."</p>

<p>The grizzled old native certainly appeared to have considerable
influence over the others; there could be no doubt that he was a
leader of some sort, and his policy was clearly not the policy of
his followers, at which the watchers by the tunnel marvelled
exceedingly. For several minutes he continued to address the
multitude, glancing occasionally towards the objects of their wrath
and waving his hand as if signalling for some one on the heights
through which Mackay and his companions had come. But at last he
ceased his wordy exhortations, and slowly arose to his feet,
donning as he did so a gigantic head-dress fashioned out of the
skin of some peculiar animal, the grinning head of which had been
cunningly retained in its pristine shape, so that the living
creature seemed to glare out savagely over the thick locks of the
wearer; and as he stood thus arrayed a tumultuous roar issued from
the lips of the awaiting horde, and they turned in a mass and
marched straight for the opening to the underground passage.</p>

<p>"Old Nebuchadnezzar has put his war-paint on at last," muttered
Mackay. "Now, my lads, let us rush them while we can. If we can
stop them even for a minute we'll win the day in spite o' their
numbers."</p>

<p>"Let her go, boss!" yelled the Shadow from behind, and Mackay,
with a hoarse bellow of anger, dashed forward to meet the foe, his
impetuous comrades bounding closely at his heels. All were filled
with the mad desire to slay until the last. The lust of battle had
taken hold of them completely; no thought of the probable grim
finale was theirs.</p>

<p>Their wild advance caused the blacks to hesitate momentarily,
and the front rank crowded back. Bob noticed in a flash the
advantage which had thus been given, and he knew why Mackay had so
suddenly left the shelter of the cavern. While the natives hustled
together not a bow could be bent. Quickly he dropped on one knee
beside his leader, Jack and the Shadow falling into line as if by a
preconceived arrangement. Had they discharged their rifles at that
crucial moment their enemy would have been mowed down before the
leaden hail. But ere a finger pressed the trigger, the old chief,
with a shrill cry, which was heard high above the din, leapt in
front of his myrmidons, and, with an almost regal gesture, waved
them back. That he himself escaped being riddled with bullets was a
lasting testimony to the iron nerves of the dauntless four who,
even at such a critical juncture, disdained to fire on one whose
face was turned away from them. But they recovered themselves
promptly and prepared to follow up their apparent triumph, yet the
ancient warrior stayed them with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"I'll soon throw him out of the way," roared Mackay, dashing
forward.</p>

<p>Before he reached the patriarchal chief, however, a stentorian
call from behind arrested his attention, and he stood rooted to the
spot, dazed and bewildered. Again the cry sounded in his
ears&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come back, Jim; for God's sake, come back. There's three
hundred against you."</p>

<p>He staggered and would have fallen, had not Bob's strong arm
supported him; then he turned almost fearfully. Five tall figures
were hastening frantically down the hillside, and the foremost was
the watcher of the summit. As in a dream Mackay raised his rifle,
and he did not seem to notice when Bob pressed the deadly tube
down. He was gazing with wild staring eyes at the approaching
form.</p>

<p>"Great Centipedes!" howled the Shadow, in amazement. "It's a
white man!"</p>

<p>That broke the spell. With a hoarse exclamation, Mackay rushed
to meet the new-comer.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="i355" id="i355"></a><img src=
"2300241h-images/i355.jpg" alt="MACKAY RUSHED TO MEET THE NEW-COMER">
</p>

<p class="caption">"Mackay rushed to meet the new-comer"</p>

<p>"Dick!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me, Jim," came the answer. "I knew you would
come."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch16"></a>Chapter 16. The Prisoners by the Mount</h2>

<p>Silently the two men clasped hands. Mackay could not trust
himself to speak, so strong was his emotion at meeting his old
leader in the flesh after having given him up as dead for over a
year.</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew you would come, Jim," repeated Richard Bentley, the
explorer, "and month after month I have watched for you on the
mountain-top, hoping yet fearing for your coming."</p>

<p>"But the bones?" murmured Mackay, questioningly.
"I&mdash;saw&mdash;the bones?"</p>

<p>Bentley smiled. "I wouldn't have thought it of you, Jim," he
said, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "But I see you must have
fallen into the error you used to preach so much against. Where
were your powers of observation? I am sure you would have known the
difference between camels' bones and human bones if you had
examined them. But I know how you must have felt, old man, and I
don't wonder at your mistake at such a terrible moment. They burnt
the camels, Jim, because they could never take them through the
passage in the mountain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whaur is ma auld enemy?" roared an interrupting voice, and a
lithe figure in savage habiliments spun into the midst of the
group, blowing tempestuously. The impetus of his flight down the
steep hillside was only brought to a close when he bounced against
Mackay like a weighty stone from a catapult.</p>

<p>"I kent it was you! I kent it was you!" he cried, in honest
delight; "I couldna mistak' that sweet visage o' yours even though
it's half changed its colour."</p>

<p>"Stewart, you red-heided rascal, you've knocked the wind clean
oot o' me," replied Mackay, sternly, shaking his aggressor's hand
nevertheless with hearty warmth. "I might have known that nothing
could have killed you."</p>

<p>Two others now pressed up, their sun-tanned and bearded features
fairly glowing with delight. They were Phil, the geologist, and
Pioneer Bill, the bushman of Bentley's party, and their joy at
seeing their lost comrade again was affecting in its sincerity.</p>

<p>Emu Bill was the next to approach. "I knew you wouldn't be long
after me, Mac," he said, "but I'm blowed if I expected you to
bounce through so sudden. Bentley, here, mesmerized the nigs that
scooped me in, or I should have been dead meat by this time. They
seemed mighty unwilling to let me go, all the same, an' I was a bit
anxious 'bout your reception, I was."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bob stood a little way apart, his heart filled with
gladness at the happy reunion. Jack and the Shadow were calmly
leaning on their rifles, and keeping a watchful glance on the old
chief, who in turn was eyeing the boys with a smile on his wrinkled
countenance. About a hundred yards behind him his massed warriors
stood, silent and grim.</p>

<p>"I reckon we should go an' wash the filthy black off our faces,"
said the Shadow to Jack; "it feels mighty uncomfortable, it does."
Then he gazed at his companion in surprise. "Why," he cried,
"you're face is marked like the bars o' a cage. What has you been
doin' to it?"</p>

<p>Jack laughed. "I had forgotten that we ought to be black," said
he, "or I could have told you that yours was like the moon under
partial eclipse."</p>

<p>"And how about mine?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Clean washed off," answered Jack. "But look at Mackay; isn't
his a treat? It's striped like the zebra in a circus."</p>

<p>Mackay heard the remark, and put up his hand to his cheek.
"Well, well," he said, in disgust, "here I was fancyin' myself to
be black as the ace o' spades. No wonder the niggers thought there
was something no' right about our get-up. It must have been the
water dripping from the roof o' the passage." Then he turned to
Bob. "It's a good thing we passed that last batch inside the
tunnel, Bob."</p>

<p>Bob nodded gravely, then discarded his cumbersome robe, and
straightened out his sinewy form with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Mackay, quietly, addressing himself to Bentley
and his comrades, "I want to introduce to you my three young
comrades, who have stuck by me on a journey that has tried the
nerves and beaten some o' the finest explorers who ever tackled the
desert. Come forward, Shadow, an' you, Jack&mdash;a pair o'
reckless young rascals, true as steel, an' without
fear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, boss," protested the Shadow, "do let me have a scrimmage
wi' a nigger or two, just to show how brave I really is. I is just
burstin' wi' bravery&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jack at this stage dragged him aside.</p>

<p>"And you, Bob," continued Mackay, and his voice unconsciously
became softened, "what can I say for you? Only this, my lad, that
without you this expedition would never have reached the mountain.
To you belongs a' the credit that my auld friends here shower upon
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," broke in Bob, hastily; "it is just like you to say so,
but I'll not allow it. I was only the navigator under your
supervision."</p>

<p>Mackay placed his hand on the youth's shoulder. "Bob," he said
gently, "I have a confession to make. I'll admit that I ken how to
handle a sextant an' read the vernier, but beyond that I canna go.
I wasna able to check your observations, my laddie, but I was
afraid to tell you before, lest it might make you nervous to ken
that a' our lives depended on your skill. Here now, at the end o'
our journey, I wish to give you the credit which is your due."</p>

<p>Bentley smiled as he grasped Bob's hand. "Sextant or no
sextant," he said, "you couldn't go far out in Mackay's company, my
boy. I know him of old. But why, your face seems strangely familiar
to me; surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mackay shrugged his broad shoulders, and smiled a happy
smile.</p>

<p>"You hand on a bit, Dick," he said. "I have a few words to say
to Bob which I hesitated to speak earlier, for&mdash;for obvious
reasons. Do you remember when I first met Jack and you, Bob?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I should say so," answered Bob, fervently. "I have had cause to
thank&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The big man shook his head deprecatingly. "And do you know why
I, who am a&mdash;a very unsociable individual at the best,
encouraged you in your wish to go out to Australia, an' even
offered you the extraordinar' advantage o' my company on the
journey? No, of course you don't. It was because I knew that uncle
you spoke of, my lad."</p>

<p>"You knew him?" cried Bob. "But you didn't
say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought he was dead," broke in Mackay, gravely; "but I was
mistaken. He was, an' is, vera much alive&mdash;an' his name is
Richard Bentley Wentworth."</p>

<p>"Great Heavens!" ejaculated Bentley, gazing at Bob earnestly.
"Can it be true? But of course it is. How could I have been so
blind."</p>

<p>Then the scales fell from Bob's eyes. "Uncle Dick!" he cried,
rushing forward.</p>

<p>"My dear, dear lad," murmured the explorer, clasping him in his
arms. "This is the first happiness I have had for ten years. You
are a worthy son of a worthy father, my boy. Thank God I have lived
to see you."</p>

<p>To say that the onlookers to this strange scene were surprised
would ill express the state of their feelings. They were simply
thunderstruck. Then Jack found his voice. "Hurrah!" he shouted, in
an ecstasy of glee, and hurried to clasp his comrade's hand.
Eagerly they all crowded round to offer their congratulations, and
Mackay stood alone, a smile of peaceful contentment stealing over
his grim old features.</p>

<p>"Yes," he muttered, "there is some satisfaction in the
wanderer's life after a'. Bob steered us here, which was right, but
Mackay will be the man to lead the back trail through the
mountain."</p>

<p>"I fully believe you, Jim," said a voice at his elbow, and
Bentley laid an affectionate grasp upon his arm.</p>

<p>The whole of the little drama had been enacted within the space
of a few minutes, and the actors therein had apparently become
oblivious to the fact that a band of impatient blacks were drawn up
in aggressive order at no great distance. They were not allowed to
remain long in this blissful state, however, for the aged chief
suddenly hastened forward, and shrilled a few words to Bentley,
which had the effect of arousing that happy man to a true sense of
his responsibilities. He answered the old warrior in an odd
monosyllabic language, which he spoke with perfect ease, much to
the astonishment of the youthful members of the group, who had
never before heard a white man converse so fluently in the savage
tongue. For some moments they held high consultation thus, and Bob
was quick to observe a shade of dire uneasiness steal over the
features of his newly found relative; and he noticed, too, that the
natives in the background were gradually drawing nearer and nearer,
while loud, angry mutterings filled their ranks.</p>

<p>It was at this stage that Stewart whispered something into
Mackay's ear which made that gentleman frown deeply, hesitate for a
brief instant, then surreptitiously remove the magazine of his
rifle; and his three companions, obeying a signal from his eye,
quickly unloaded their weapons and secreted the cartridges. Bentley
seemed to have been conscious of these proceedings, for it was only
when the firearms had been rendered harmless that he turned and
addressed the party.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to alarm you, boys," he said, "but the king, who
has always been a good friend of mine, tells me that his warriors
are getting beyond his control, and nothing short of a miracle can
save us. You killed four of them, you see, and wounded about a
dozen more, and, by their law, a life must pay for a life."</p>

<p>"That's vera comforting," grunted Mackay, preparing to reload
his rifle afresh, and glaring savagely at Stewart the while.</p>

<p>"Don't! For Heaven's sake don't do that, Jim," exclaimed
Bentley. "Lay down your rifles, and I'll try and talk them
over."</p>

<p>Reluctantly each proffered his deadly weapon to the king, who
received it with unconcealed joy.</p>

<p>"We've still got our revolvers," whispered Jack to Stewart, who
was looking very sorrowful indeed.</p>

<p>Yet still the warriors came surging on, despite their old king's
frenzied expostulations. In vain he displayed the trophies he had
received in proof of the good intentions of the visitors, and as
his followers crowded heedlessly forward, his wrath at his own
impotence was terrible to witness.</p>

<p>Mackay was deciding on the bold stroke of retaking the weapons
from the king's grasp, when Bentley stepped slowly out to meet the
angry mob. He was greeted with shrill yells, the dominant note of
which seemed to be fear and expectancy rather than fury.</p>

<p>"He'll be killed! he'll be killed!" cried Jack, making as if to
dash to his assistance.</p>

<p>The Shadow restrained him. "I reckon he's all right," said he.
"Them nigs is howlin' wi' terror, they are."</p>

<p>"What power can he have over them?" asked Bob, in awe, as he
watched the single man sway the fiery multitude with his calm
words. Phil, the geologist, who was by his side, answered him.</p>

<p>"Your uncle's knowledge of aboriginal tribes has stood us all in
good stead before this," he said quietly. "Listen to that cry. Can
you make anything of it?"</p>

<p>"It sounds like Bilya Backan," Bob said, straining his ears to
catch the prevailing shouts.</p>

<p>"Bilya Backan!" exclaimed Mackay. "Has Dick got that position
here? Ah, well, it means that we are safe enough so long as he
keeps his power; but I can see trouble ahead when he tries to get
away."</p>

<p>"Why, what does it mean?" questioned Bob, in wonder.</p>

<p>"Mean? It means that he is the sorcerer o' this tribe, and will
be guarded night and day if they think he wants to clear out. But,
hallo! he doesna seem to be succeeding just as well as he should.
It seems to me I'd better be sorcerer number two, an' devise an
opportune miracle."</p>

<p>Bentley, indeed, appeared to have great difficulty in quelling
the unruly spirit of the savage warriors. They crowded around him
almost threateningly, and brandished their bows and clubs in
half-restrained fury. The unhappy king had joined his more powerful
friend, and was lending his high-pitched voice to the uproar.
Mackay unconcernedly chipped at something he held in his hand with
the point of his sheath-knife, then stalked jauntily towards the
gesticulating throng.</p>

<p>"Keep back, Jim! keep back!" warned Bentley. "You are the man
they want principally. Keep back, if you value your life."</p>

<p>"You canna kill me, Dick," laughed Mackay. "I've come over to
work a miracle to that effect."</p>

<p>Yet to all appearances it seemed as if the resourceful Scot was
tempting Providence to too great a degree in the present instance.
The blacks redoubled their clamour at his approach, and one false
move on the part of Bentley at this juncture would assuredly have
brought about his companion's doom, but he did not once turn his
back on the truculent band.</p>

<p>"What wild idea have you got?" he cried over his shoulder. "I
think I'll manage them all right. I'm telling them that the spirit
of the thunder killed their brethren for their own misdeeds."</p>

<p>"That's good enough," said Mackay. "But you'd better tell them
you've decided to slaughter me right off now, only that you're
afraid Wangul, the maist powerful god in their calendar, will
protect me, seein' I'm an auld friend o' his. Get my rifle from old
Methuselah, Dick; let me load it, an' shoot me with the first
cartridge. Savvy?"</p>

<p>Bentley pretended not to hear, but he spoke out several
sentences rapidly, which evidently pleased the warriors mightily,
then he signed to the king to fetch the rifles.</p>

<p>"The long-barrelled one's mine, Dick," cautioned Mackay. "Ah,
that's right."</p>

<p>He seized his treasured weapon, and in a trice had inserted two
cartridges, and closed the breech, leaving one in the barrel.
Bentley received back the deadly firearm with evident trepidation,
and once more addressed the multitude.</p>

<p>"Hear ye, O my people," he cried, in their own weird tongue.
"The friend of Wangul, the mighty dweller in the waters, whose
breath dries up the land and makes it desolate, stands before you
and dares the strength of the big thunder. If it so be that he dies
by the spirit which issueth forth when the thunder speaks, then
shall you work your will upon the others. But if he lives and
defies the spirit, then surely is he indeed in the guarding care of
Wangul, and must be permitted to go unhurt with his brethren to
partake of food with me in my home by the hillside."</p>

<p>Mackay smiled grimly as he gathered the text of the speech, but
a great roar from the assembled blacks indicated that the
arrangement met with their full approval. Bentley raised the rifle
with an obvious effort, and at the action a wild cry of alarm broke
from the lips of the little group in the rear, who had never dreamt
that Mackay's promised miracle was to take on such a deadly aspect
of reality. And now the withered old chief created a diversion.
With a gurgle of joy he sprang forward and took the rifle from
Bentley's unresisting hands, and levelling it almost against
Mackay's broad chest, pulled the trigger. A terrific explosion
followed, and Bentley uttered a groan of anguish. The miracle, as
he had understood it, was to have been accomplished by his firing
wide, and he had relinquished the firearm, never thinking that the
wily king of the savages meant to do other than lay it aside with
the others. To his intense astonishment, however, and to the
amazement of the massed blacks, the "friend of Wangul" stood erect
and smiling after the thunderous reverberation had died away.</p>

<p>A loud cheer from his comrades behind showed how truly thankful
they were at his marvellous escape from what had looked like
certain death, but the most astounded of all present was,
undoubtedly, the dusky individual who had fired the shot; he
pranced about with the reeking rifle still in his hands, shrieking
out all sorts of incantations. Suddenly he stopped short, opened
and closed the breech of the gun, thereby forcing another cartridge
into position, and, with a crafty smile on his lips, directed the
long tube at a stalwart savage standing near, and fired. The
unoffending victim uttered a yell like a wounded dingo, and sprang
several feet into the air, then subsided on the ground, and writhed
in torment with a bullet-hole clean through his shoulder. That was
enough. With droning wails of fear the natives drew back in alarm,
gazing at the man who had withstood a similar shock with wild,
staring eyes. Bentley knelt down and examined the wounded native,
then, calling two of his brethren, who came forward reluctantly, he
gave them some directions for his treatment. The king meanwhile was
grovelling on the ground, his head beating the dust, and his voice
raised in feeble lamentation; and, while he was thus prostrated,
Jack crept stealthily up and gathered in the rifles lying near.</p>

<p>"That will be another miracle for the old beggar to explain,"
said he, when he rejoined his companions.</p>

<p>"You've fairly frightened the old fellow to death, Jim,"
remarked Bentley, stooping over the fallen monarch. "I'll tell you
about him afterwards; but he was proof against all sorts of
sorceries, and now I shouldn't winder if he turns over a new leaf,
and goes in for the extremest forms of savagery. But come with us
to our retreat. There are many things we have to talk over
to-night. This day has been a wonderful one for all of us."</p>

<p>"You might tell me, boss, how you dodged the bullet?" pleaded
the Shadow, as they all walked along together.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a matter I should like to understand," added
Bentley.</p>

<p>The big man laughed. "The explanation is vera simple," said he.
"There wasna any bullet in the first cartridge; I took it oot
aforehand!"</p>

<p>"You're just the same auld deceitfu' schemer you used to be,"
murmured Stewart, sorrowfully. "I'm fair shocked at your woefu'
depravity. You would actually bamboozle the puir heathen!"</p>

<p>"What's that you've got inside your cloak?" demanded Mackay,
slyly, noting an odd protuberance in his corrector's garment.</p>

<p>Stewart beamed. "That's a vera dangerous gun, Mac, ma man," he
answered solemnly, "an' I'm takin' it awa' in case the unfortunate
niggers might dae themselves damage wi' it."</p>

<p>They had been so engrossed in their mutual recriminations that
Mackay had not noticed the odd logged structure which now appeared
before them; it was half hidden amid a splendid group of lime and
cedar trees which occurred in the valley, about two hundred yards
to the north of the tunnel entrance, and the waters of the
beautiful lake lapped the white sands within a few paces of it.
Mackay gave a rough glance round to make sure of his position. The
sun had descended behind the frowning barrier range, and a gloom
was settling over the valley.</p>

<p>Bentley guessed his thoughts. "I know every foot of the country,
Jim," he said quietly. "We'll talk over our plans to-night. What
have we got in the larder, Stewart?"</p>

<p>"I caught ane or twa fish this morning," answered that
individual, smilingly. "I thought we might have some visitors to
keep us company."</p>

<p>"And there's bread made from wild bananas," added Phil. "It's
not half bad, though it will take you a little time to get
accustomed to it."</p>

<p>Bentley pushed open the door, which was an airy contrivance
composed of light saplings interlaced with long tendril forest
growths, and it swung from above by stout plaited grassy cords.</p>

<p>"Enter, boys," he said, "and welcome, most heartily welcome, to
the white man's dwelling in the mystic valley of the Never
Never."</p>

<p>Mackay mechanically raised his hand to his head as he stepped
between the portals, and a grunt of disgust forced itself from his
lips when, instead of the hat he expected to find, a few muddy
feathers broke off in his grasp. The boys, following close behind,
saw the action and laughed, yet immediately proceeded to copy his
example, so strong was the habit of civilization upon them.</p>

<p>The single large room within was bare, save for a rough logged
table in the middle of the floor, and sundry rude but comfortable
chairs which were scattered about.</p>

<p>"We sleep on the ground," explained Bentley; "we've never had
the heart to attempt building proper bunks. Have you a match,
Jim?"</p>

<p>Mackay sought in his pocket and produced the small corked bottle
in which he carried his supply so that it might be preserved from
damp, and Bentley, with a sigh of thankfulness, applied a light to
a torch of fine fibrous sticks stuck in a crevice in the table. Bob
watched him with many questions surging on his lips.</p>

<p>"How do you usually get a light?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"You are anticipating me, Bob," laughed Bentley. "At night we
use the flints, in the old primitive way, but in the daytime I use
the lens of my pocket microscope which was left to me. If I hold it
in the sun's rays it will light a fire of these twigs in less than
sixty seconds. That was the first thing the natives saw me do that
made them marvel. They couldn't understand how I could call down
fire from heaven, and it's one of the few things which that knowing
old king of theirs hasn't grasped yet."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Stewart and Pioneer Bill were busy preparing
supper. There seemed to be no lack of cooking utensils, and each
vessel was most peculiarly marked, as if it had been stamped out of
the solid. Mackay, who had thrown off his encumbering outer garb,
sat gazing into the fire, apparently lost in the depths of his
thoughts; Bentley and Phil were talking earnestly together in a
subdued voice; Emu Bill roamed aimlessly about the room; Bob, Jack,
and the Shadow were glaring with wide-open eyes at the thin metal
platters with which Stewart had adorned the table;&mdash;not one of
them could find words to speak.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is it another mirage?" muttered the Shadow, at length,
stretching out a hesitating hand; then a whoop of delight burst
from his lips. "Say, boss," he cried, shaking Mackay energetically
by the shoulder. "Look! Look at this!"</p>

<p>Mackay awoke from his reverie with a start, and turned his
head.</p>

<p>"Ay, it's gold, Shadow," said he, calmly. "I am no' vera
surprised."</p>

<p>Bentley gave a whistle of annoyance. "Well, boys," he explained,
"I absolutely forgot to mention the matter, but gold is so
plentiful in this quarter that I have got quite accustomed to it,
and I do believe I had also forgotten that the stuff has such a
powerful value&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spin us your yarn after supper, Dick," said Mackay. "I'm as
hungry as a starved dingo just now."</p>

<p>"I've felt a bit sick ever since I saw them plates an' things,"
said Emu Bill, pausing in his perambulations. "Howlin' blazes! I
wish we could cart the whole mountain away wi' us."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you've got a bit o' tea in your pocket?"
interjected Stewart, eyeing Mackay pathetically. "No? Weel, I'll
just have to mak' up my ain concoction. It's no' vera bad when you
get accustomed to it; but I'm sair wearyin' for a ceevilized drink.
I hope the flavour o' the leaves winna disagree wi' ye; I gather
them off a wee bush that grows in the forest, but the taste is
naething like the real article."</p>

<p>Stewart's tea, however, proved to be a wonderfully palatable
beverage, and the accompanying fare of such a highly appetizing
nature that Mackay's little party soon felt revived to their
fullest energies.</p>

<p>"It will be something to remember that we've eaten out of golden
dishes," Jack remarked with much satisfaction. "I think I'll
appropriate a spoon as a memento."</p>

<p>Bentley sighed wearily. "You may be tired enough of these same
spoons before you leave here, Jack," he said.</p>

<p>Mackay gave a snort of disapproval, and rose from his chair.</p>

<p>"Load up these rifles, Shadow," he directed. "And now,
Dick"&mdash;seating himself once more&mdash;"fire away wi' your
story. What sort o' place have we struck, an' how do ye account for
the natives being so different from others? an' tell me how in the
name o' a' that's wonderful, you havena escaped long syne wi' your
pockets fu' o' nuggets?"</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Bentley plunged into his narrative. "When
you had been about an hour away, Jim," he began, "chasing up that
confounded camel, and while we were loading the team, we were
suddenly surrounded by an army of the oddest-looking warriors
imaginable. They must have been hiding in the scrub near by us for
some time, for we had no warning whatever of their coming, and, to
make matters worse, not one of us had a rifle ready. They bore down
on us without a word, and, of course, quickly had the best of it,
for they were ten to one, and were armed with clubs and arrows.
They seemed quite peaceably inclined, however, and did not appear
to be in any way anxious to exterminate us at once, though Stewart
got a crack on the head which nearly finished him."</p>

<p>"I did that," murmured that individual, patting the back of his
skull tenderly. "But ye shid mak' mention o' hoo I squelched a
wheen o' them wi' ma naked fist aforehand."</p>

<p>"They carried us away," continued Bentley, reminiscently,
"though not before they had built a huge fire beside our camp. I
thought they meant it for us; but when I saw them unloading the
poor camels I knew at once what was going to happen. It is a common
custom among the most knowing savages to burn the bodies of animals
or men so as to give the impression that the expedition had died of
thirst years before. They have deceived Government search-parties
many times by that ruse, and frightened off explorers from tackling
the same supposedly droughty quarter again. Anyhow, our captors
made short work of the unfortunate camels, scooped up every bit of
our outfit, and marched on. I don't need to speak of our surprise
when we passed through the choking fumes of the sulphur springs. We
all know about them, and probably you know more than we do, for you
were camped alongside, and we scarcely got a glimpse of the
wonderful craters. The passage, too, you know possibly better than
we, for we have never been allowed to go back to the entrance, and
twenty warriors guard it night and day when there are any signs of
danger, or a strange tribe is in the vicinity. But the biggest
surprise of all came when we had an opportunity of studying the
valley and its formations, and we got that very speedily, for that
curious old king of the tribe released us almost as soon as we were
brought in."</p>

<p>"I can remember he had some difficulty with his followers then,
too," interjected Phil, gravely. "They weren't quite so wild as
they were to-day, but they were bad enough until you talked to them
in their own lingo."</p>

<p>Bentley smiled. "I could see even then," he said, "that their
aged leader had some strange scheme in hand, though it was several
weeks later before he laid his views quite clearly before me."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to say that you waited here o' your ain free
will as prisoners?" snorted Mackay.</p>

<p>"For the first little while we were interested to know what sort
of country we had reached, and then, when even the riches of the
valley began to pall on us, we suddenly realized that we could not
help ourselves. The tunnel was always well watched, but even had we
got safely through the mountain, where were we then? On the edge of
an enormous desert without food or means of transport. You must
recollect, Jim, that the camels had been killed, as probably yours
have been by this time."</p>

<p>Mackay started to his feet, but resumed his seat with a
smile.</p>

<p>"It would be dark before they could venture out," he said,
musingly. "We have a good ten hours' grace yet. Hurry up wi' your
story, Dick; I want to know whether we should stay here, an' get
rich quick wi' the gold oot o' the mountain, or clear out while we
have a chance."</p>

<p>"You forget, Jim," said Bentley, quietly, "that your chance has
gone. I tried to warn you from the summit in every conceivable
manner, but you wouldn't understand. I even scribbled charcoal
messages on pieces of wood and threw them down, and you paid no
attention."</p>

<p>"We thought you were throwing stones at us," said Bob. "You
looked so very like a native at that distance."</p>

<p>"It was a miracle we didn't pop you over with our rifles,"
commented Emu Bill, shortly.</p>

<p>"I dinna see that our chance has vanished just yet, if we care
to take it," Mackay observed, with undiminished assurance. "But go
on wi' your yarn, Dick; what I'm anxious to know is, who made that
tunnel and for what purpose?"</p>

<p>"First of all, let me tell you," said Bentley, "that this valley
is almost impregnable from every direction but one. Away to the
north-east there is a slight break in the circular range, but the
country in that quarter is so broken and desolate that it is almost
impassable, and certainly no explorer making an east or west course
would dream of altering his route to the south at that point. He
would rather give the mountain&mdash;if he happened to see it
then&mdash;as wide a berth as possible. On the west, as you know,
Nature guards her secret very effectually, and it might have
remained undiscovered for another hundred years if you had not
escaped from the expedition as you did, and so been able to track
up the mysterious mountain afresh, and with greater caution. But
now that you are here, you may take it as a surety that you will
never be allowed to leave with the knowledge you have gained. The
fact is, boys, this valley in the heart of the Never Never land is
a perfect treasure-house of gold and gems, and it is inhabited by
the remnants of a once truly remarkable tribe. They are still
infinitely superior in knowledge and intellect to any other
aboriginal race that I know, but they have been degenerating slowly
these last many centuries, ever since the upheaval, I should
imagine, which altered the aspect of Central Australia, and
separated it from Polynesia. Their environment has protected them
to an enormous degree, for their home in this natural paradise is
surely all that could be desired, but, from what I have been able
to gather from the king, they have inherited a policy of isolation,
which is now almost a part of their creed. Any unsuspecting tribe
that wanders near is attacked with the utmost ferocity, as I have
myself witnessed on more than one occasion. The early rulers of
this strange little kingdom were undoubtedly wise men, and it seems
to me they were struggling towards a kind of civilization. The
tunnel was driven in their time, but whether it was intended to
provide a means of exterminating their savage neighbours of the
plains, or gradually pushed through in the course of their
excavations for gold, I haven't been able to discover, though I
rather fancy both reasons came into play. The gold has been used
for all sorts of purposes, because it can be hammered into any
shape so very easily. Its value in the outside world is wholly
incomprehensible to them."</p>

<p>"Do you think they have ever heard of the great world beyond the
desert?" asked Bob, who had been listening with keen interest.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt about that, my lad. It's simply
marvellous how remote native races acquire their news; but they
invariably get it, though in this case there is nothing
inexplicable about it, for the cunning old king has his scouts
wandering all over the country. The dangers of the vast salt tracks
have little meaning to them, for they seem to have cultivated an
instinct for smelling out any water there may be within miles of
them, and they can travel a very long way without it if necessity
arises. Their system of navigation is beyond my understanding
altogether."</p>

<p>"An' what do you think made the old chap so tenderhearted when
you came along, Dick?" asked Mackay.</p>

<p>Bentley shook his head. "I know why he didn't demolish us at
first," he said. "The tunnel had been commencing to cave in about
the centre, where the dripping water had weakened the walls, and
all his warriors' efforts at timbering it were without avail. You
see, they hadn't grasped the necessary principle of locking the
timber to prevent lateral strain. I suppose he thought the white
man could make things right."</p>

<p>"An' it was a terrible hard job too," grunted Stewart, "for we
had to do the maist o' it in the dark. A light wouldna' burn five
minutes in the place, an' the air was enough to poison a
nigger."</p>

<p>"After that," continued Bentley, "I seemed to get into his good
graces somewhat. I talked to him of other tribes I had met, and
generally showed such a keen interest in the welfare of his
kingdom, that I believe he altered his purpose to kill us, greatly
against the wishes of his subjects. It was then he gave out that I
was the direct representative of one of their most dreaded gods,
and I've had to live up to my reputation ever since. You saw the
result of my influence over the king to-day. Yet I've noticed the
more I have tried to civilize him, the less his warriors like him,
and, to tell the truth, I expected an open revolt against his
ruling long before this. If I hadn't arrived in time to-day I
shouldn't like to think what might have happened. I didn't expect
you could possibly get through the passage, for when I rescued Bill
from the warriors they went straight back, and we climbed the
mountain to make another effort to warn you against trying. They
were so savage when I took Bill from them, that I believe they
would have killed you right away if they had met you. I don't know
yet how you escaped."</p>

<p>"As it happened," said Mackay, dryly, "the darkness saved us
when they first came through, an' when they were returning we had
fortunately made a mistake in our direction, and got into a cross
drive."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness we made these drives," cried Bentley,
fervently.</p>

<p>"You made them?" echoed Mackay, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, we made them, Jim. I tried to get the natives to help, but
they very quickly tired of the work, and contented themselves
watching us instead. I felt curious to know the width of the lode,
and we just managed to strike the walls of the giant fissure, when
our picks, which we had recovered, were worn almost to the wooden
handles. I scarcely fancied continuing operations with flint-headed
implements, such as must have been used in the main work of
excavation, and, besides, I didn't see any hope of us being able to
carry away the gold we got, even if an opportunity of escape had
offered. We washed the stuff in the lake here by hand; it
decomposed very rapidly on contact with the air, and hardly
required any crushing. Stewart made all our cooking utensils out of
the results of our work, and I melted what was left. You will see
it lying over there in the corner."</p>

<p>Mackay looked casually in the direction indicated, but the three
boys made a dash towards the golden treasure, and after a first
glance the usually imperturbable Scot arose with a bound and
followed them. There, lying carelessly on the damp clay, were half
a dozen huge irregularly shaped masses, which glistened yellow in
the dull light. Jack lifted one in his hand with some
difficulty.</p>

<p>"I reckon I want to lie down an' die somewhere," muttered Emu
Bill, feebly blinking his eyes at the dazzling spectacle.</p>

<p>"How much do you think you've got here, Dick?" said Mackay,
calmly.</p>

<p>Bentley smiled. "Just about a hundredweight, I calculate," he
answered. "But it is no earthly good to us. We can't carry it away,
even if we had the chance."</p>

<p>Mackay looked perplexed, and for a few moments seemed to be
struggling with a mighty problem.</p>

<p>"The weight wouldna' be much among the lot o' us," he murmured
at length, "but&mdash;but it hurts me sair to think o' leaving a'
that stuff in the mountain."</p>

<p>"Don't let that worry you, old man," broke in Bentley hastily.
"If you've got a scheme for escape, let us act upon it without
delay; there's more than any of us will ever need in this shanty
besides gold. Show him the collection, Phil."</p>

<p>Without a word Phil drew forth a short, deep case made of
plaited twigs from a recess under the table, and threw open the
lid, exposing a mass of red, blue, and yellow tinted pebbles.</p>

<p>"There you are, Mac," said he, "they don't look anything special
in their present rough state, but they're worth a long way more
than a hundredweight of gold, and certainly very much more
portable. They are rubies and sapphires, and I think there are some
diamonds among them. There's surely enough here to go round without
bothering about more, though I can show you where to get them
to-morrow if you want a bigger stock."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, Phil," said Mackay, with decision, "we'll be
marching along homeward bound, if we're no' lying perforated wi'
arrows in some corner o' the tunnel. We'll help you to carry the
treasure, an' maybe afterwards we'll come back an' get some for
oursel's. Isn't that right, Bob?"</p>

<p>Bob nodded, then quickly dived into his pocket, and extricated
therefrom sundry rounded stones, and showed them to Phil.</p>

<p>"Are these any good?" he asked. "I picked them up on the other
side of the mountain the first day we arrived, and had forgotten
all about them."</p>

<p>"They're exactly the same, Bob," returned the geologist, with a
smile, "and they come from the same source, apparently."</p>

<p>"Let us know your plan, Jim, and we'll make an effort to get
away if it is possible," urged Bentley. "But I won't budge unless
we agree to make an even divide of the treasure of the Never
Never." And the sharing of the spoil was insisted upon with happy
unanimity.</p>

<p>It was now about ten o'clock in the evening and Mackay pushed
open the door and looked out; the air was close and sultry as if
presaging a thunderstorm, and a heavy, dark cloud suspended over
the little valley; in the gloom near the tunnel several forms were
to be seen flitting about. He returned into the room with a smile
on his lips.</p>

<p>"We're goin' to have rain, I think," he announced, "an' I
shouldn't wonder if there's a bit o' thunder along wi' it. The
elements will fight on our side, boys; we'll just give them a bit
o' a start. An' now, Dick," he added, eyeing his old leader
quizzically, "did I no' see you lookin' at us when we were blowing
chunks o' Australia into the air this morning?"</p>

<p>"I saw you making a tomb for poor Never Never Dave," answered
Bentley, sadly.</p>

<p>Emu Bill groaned and Mackay sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"But that was yesterday, Dick. What about this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I noticed you this morning, too; but I only heard one
explosion, and didn't think anything of it."</p>

<p>"Where were your powers o' observation, Dick? We were bursting a
new entrance into the mountain." But Mackay's satisfaction at his
sally was clouded by the sad recollections aroused by his friend's
first remark. "You tell him, Bob," he added weakly. "Tell him o'
our precautionary arrangements which should stand us in good stead
now."</p>

<p>A few minutes later a series of great pattering drops on the
bark roof of the dwelling intimated that the expected storm had
burst; slowly they came at first, then louder and louder hissed the
growing deluge until it seemed as if the floodgates of the heavens
had broken loose, and a dull, tearing roar echoed across the vale
as the thunder-cloud rent in twain.</p>

<p>"If that doesna frighten the niggers they ought to be ashamed o'
themselves," grunted Mackay. "Now we'll go, lads, an' trust to
Providence an' our rifles for a safe journey."</p>

<p>They gathered up their precious freight, each taking a goodly
share so that nothing was left, and silently they filed out into
the raging night, and, with Bentley leading, groped a cautious
course towards the underground passage. Through the beating torrent
they caught glimpses of many lights in the native camps bordering
the lake near at hand, and the droning intonation of a most
melancholy chant reached their ears in occasional snatches as they
hurried on their way. The natives were invoking the favour of the
mighty thunder-god who that day had smitten one of their warriors
so cruelly. At last they arrived at the opening from which Mackay
and his companions had first gazed out in wonder, and with a united
breath of thankfulness entered the yawning darkness of the
cavern.</p>

<p>Yet, even as they disappeared, a shrill cry of alarm sounded out
above the storm from the vicinity of the home they had just
vacated, and a chorus of answering yells showed too truly that
their flight had been discovered.</p>

<p>"That was the old king's voice," whispered Bentley, as the
fugitives paused for a moment to listen. "He probably called to get
you to stay the thunder. We just got away in time."</p>

<p>"The other end is where our danger lies," muttered Mackay. "Now,
lads, follow me, an' be as slippery as you can. Those howlin'
hyenas will be at our backs in a minute."</p>

<p>Blindly they stumbled on, staggering from wall to wall in their
feverish eagerness; but before they had even reached the
cross-drives, the cries of their savage pursuers were echoing along
the passage close in their rear. On, on they laboured, and now
Mackay began to hesitate in his course, so that his comrades kept
pushing up in a confused mass behind him. In the excitement which
reigned they could not well understand why their doughty leader
should pause at such an inopportune moment. But that level-headed
individual knew exactly what he was doing; in another instant he
had found the rope which hung over the treacherous pit.</p>

<p>"Now, my bonnie boys," said he, "over you go. You, Bob, take the
lead, and walk quietly on. I'll be after you in a jiff."</p>

<p>"I never knew of this death-trap," breathed Bentley, hoarsely.
"Jim, old man, Heaven knows how you managed to negotiate this
terrible place at first."</p>

<p>"My power o' observation is strong even in the dark," chuckled
the brawny Scot. "Now, grip the rope, Dick, an' get across. Here's
old Methuselah's gang almost beside us, an' I want to stop their
progress a bit."</p>

<p>Bentley delayed no further, and in a flash Mackay too had leapt
the gully, but, ere he hastened after the others, he leaned out
over the unseen chasm and smote at the thick cord high overhead
with his sheath-knife, then he gathered up his burden and struggled
after his companions. He overtook them while they were yet some
distance from the sudden bend which occurred just opposite the
entrance the gelignite had made, for Bob was treading cautiously,
expecting each moment to be assailed by the warriors whose duty it
was to abide by the rocking stone. And that his fears in that
direction were by no means groundless was proved by the excited
mutterings which at this moment issued from the end of the passage,
and the ominous snap of the great rock as it closed into position
was distinctly heard. The watchful blacks had evidently been
investigating matters outside, and had just returned to their post.
The clamour of the pursuing band was now most demoralizingly loud
and fierce. They seemed to be already rejoicing at the pleasing
prospect before them: their enemy was neatly caught between two
fires; little wonder that they sent out shriek after shriek of
delirious acclamation. And in the mean time the escaping party,
trudging heavily through the mire, rejoiced also that the noisy
exuberance of the warriors so effectually drowned their own
hastening footsteps, and thus prevented their near approach to
safety from being made known to the awaiting savages.</p>

<p>Then a yell, louder and more dismal than ever, suddenly echoed
through the cavern; it was followed by a dull plunge, and
immediately a succession of similar disturbances intimated that the
all too eager warriors had experienced a rude and ardour-cooling
check. Mackay chuckled right heartily when the success of his
scheme was thus revealed to him.</p>

<p>"There has been more than one o' the beggars who has jumped for
the rope an' missed," he whispered, with ill-suppressed mirth; and
then only did his comrades guess the part he had played in the
natives' discomfiture.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the quick turn of the passage, and
Bob felt carefully for the saving gap that would lead to freedom.
The cries of the baffled warriors in the rear now rang out through
the darkness like the wails of coyotes cheated of their prey, and
their brethren ahead, by their hoarse exclamations of dismay, were
apparently considerably exercised over the strange happening which
had taken place.</p>

<p>"Quick, boys," said Mackay, when Bob had laid bare the opening.
"Up ye go in a hurry, an' hang on to your treasure; I'll send the
rifles aloft when you're a' through."</p>

<p>Bentley would have remonstrated, but the imperturbable director
of affairs was obdurate.</p>

<p>"I'm engineering this circus," he said sternly. "Now, out you
go. Whoop-la!"</p>

<p>In his own hearty exuberance he seemed utterly to have forgotten
the near presence of a part of the enemy, and his voice sounded out
boisterously as he cheered each of his companions on his way to the
outside world. For a brief instant there was absolute silence from
the extreme end of the tunnel, and Mackay knew that the inevitable
rush would speedily follow. Nor was he mistaken. With screams of
rage the blacks advanced, and the reckless man laughed aloud as
they came. He caught Jack, who alone remained, in his powerful arms
and literally hurled him into the embrace of Stewart, who stood
ready to receive him.</p>

<p>"And now, my lads, here's the rifles," he cried, thrusting the
collected weapons out through the aperture.</p>

<p>"Hang the rifles! Come oot yersel'!" howled Stewart, reaching
down a massive bony fist, and grasping his comrade by the shoulder;
and in this way Mackay, clutching fast to the armoury of the
expedition, was hauled to the surface, even as the foremost of the
vengeful warriors dashed their heads impotently into the aperture
through which he had been yanked so rigorously forth.</p>

"MACKAY, CLUTCHING FAST TO THE ARMOURY OF THE EXPEDITION, WAS HAULED TO THE SURFACE">
</p>

<p class="caption">"Mackay, clutching fast to the armoury of the
expedition, was hauled to the surface"</p>

<p>"There was no need for you exertin' your muscular powers in that
vera drastic fashion," reproved the latest arrival, turning, and
thrusting the stock of his rifle down into the gap with calm
forcefulness.</p>

<p>The response which greeted his action seemed to soothe him
somewhat.</p>

<p>"All's well that ends well," he remarked philosophically; "but
before we start congratulating oorsel's we'd better lock these twa
doors an' leave the keys on the ootside."</p>

<p>In a short time a very effective boulder barricade was arranged
before both entrances, the enormous rocks used for the purpose
being rolled and carried to their positions by the united strength
of the party; only when this work was completed, when the yells of
the baulked warriors sounded dull and subdued behind the solid
barriers, only then did the earnest toilers pause.</p>

<p>The night was beautifully clear, not a cloud was visible in the
sky, and the stars shone down with steady radiance. The rising
mists from the bubbling caldrons spread like a ghostly white veil
in the near westward distance, and ever and anon a heavy rumbling
would run along the line of the deep cavities, and fresh vapoury
puffs from the craters ascended towards the heavens. For fully a
minute no one spoke; the extreme tension on their nerves for the
last half-hour had been most trying to all, and their silence was
now more eloquent of their thankfulness than words.</p>

<p>"There has been no rain on this side of the mountain," said Bob,
at length, examining the rubbly surface of the ground intently.</p>

<p>"It would all condense inside the valley, Bob," answered
Bentley. "We are back once more in the thirsty desert of the Never
Never, and"&mdash;turning to Mackay&mdash;"we owe our escape to
you, Jim; we owe our lives to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll no' dwell on the subject," interrupted that gentleman,
cheerily. "I have no doubt we'll a' find oursel's in tighter
corners on some other expedition. It's fair surprisin' how often a
man can warstle oot o' a difficulty by the skin o' his teeth. I'm
just a wee bit afraid that the skin o' my teeth is gettin' sair
worn at the game, but it's grand fun, a' the same. However," he
continued hastily, as an upward glance revealed to him several dark
forms on the summit outlined against the sky, "I think I'll go and
round up the camels now, so that we can start on the homeward trail
without any unnecessary delay. I've a dim idea that the climate o'
the country nearer Fortunate Spring will be healthier for us than
this."</p>

<p>"I is comin' wi' you, boss," cried the Shadow. "I think I know
where the leather-hided animiles are."</p>

<p>"All right, my lad; an' you, Jack, might unearth the stores an'
the water-bag, so as to be ready when we come back. Never mind the
heavy tools. I see the niggers have shifted the case o' gelignite
we left in sight. I hope it gives them indigestion pretty bad."</p>

<p>"Have ye no' got an extra pair o' breeks in the camp?" inquired
Stewart, appealingly. "I dinna like waltzin' aboot like a gorilla
oot o' a circus."</p>

<p>Mackay laughed. "I'm vera pleased to see you've got some sense
o' shame left in ye, my man," he said sternly. "Mak' free o' the
wardrobe o' the expedition, boys, every one o' you. Bob will
dispense it out, though I don't think there's enough to go round.
Anyhow, there's lots o' string in the outfit, an' you can easily
mak' yoursel's vera presentable garments out o' the empty bags when
we get further on; but I can see we'll a' be in an outward state o'
advanced disintegration before we reach civilization."</p>

<p><br>
It was nearly two months later, and the sun stared pitilessly down
on a struggling camel-train that was wearily forcing its way
outwards from the grim desert of the interior. The animals
comprising the team were but four in all, surely much too
inadequate a number to be the mainstay of the nine strangely garbed
figures who accompanied them; yet, judging by the light packs on
their backs, it was very apparent that the outfit of the returning
expedition did not greatly impede their movements. Slowly, slowly
the great hulking creatures laboured on. At the leader's head
strode a youth, who, every now and again, turned to pat the
trembling nostrils of his cumbrous charge, and cheer it forward
with endearing words. His face was deeply browned by long exposure
to the scorching sun's rays. His clothing, consisting of a few
shreds of what had once been a shirt, and a pair of nether garments
so tattered and torn that they clung by almost miraculous means to
his person, was sufficient to indicate that he had been long on the
march; but if further proof were required, a glance at his boots
would have been more than enough. The uppers alone were left, and
they were tied to his sockless feet by numberless cords and strips
of hessian cloth. But despite the dilapidated nature of his dress,
it was the acme of respectability, compared with that of some of
his comrades. Indeed, the combined wardrobe of the party was such
that the most abandoned tramp would have turned aside from it in
disgust.</p>

<p>"Keep Misery moving, Jack&mdash;keep him moving," cried a
familiar voice; and a strongly built, yet gaunt-faced man strode up
alongside the young leader of the train, and patted his shoulder in
friendly encouragement.</p>

<p>Then he stopped and awaited the coming of the rearmost camel,
which was lagging painfully, and addressed its attendant in similar
tones.</p>

<p>"An hour or so more will do it, my lad&mdash;only an hour or so
more. Golden Flat should be just over the horizon."</p>

<p>"Say, boss," came the answer, "this here fiery animile is 'bout
busted; but I reckon I'll pull him in somehow."</p>

<p>He groped about in some hidden recess of his well-ventilated
shirt, and extricated a small shining instrument, which he placed
to his lips with a smile of real joy.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," he cried, "here we goes again&mdash;one, two,
three!" and at once the strains of a favourite melody echoed out in
the air.</p>

<p>The bulk of his companions shuddered at the opening shock, then
joined boisterously in the chorus. Loudly, triumphantly, they
bellowed forth in varying voices and keys, and, lo! the camels
pricked up their ears and quickened their steps, and the weary-eyed
singers and chief musician marched to the tune thus given with
sprightly step&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Soon we'll be in London town.<br>
Sing, my lads, yo ho-o&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again and again the cheering refrain was taken up; then suddenly
a cry of astonishment burst from the lips of a lithe and wiry young
man who had been on the point of consulting his note-book for the
twentieth time since he took his noonday altitude.</p>

<p>"We've missed it!" he cried. "That must be Kalgoorlie
ahead."</p>

<p>The music stopped at once; the white, glistening roofs of a
fair-sized township had suddenly appeared to view, nestling at the
foot of a gentle undulation in the land surface.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there has been some mistake made, Bob," said a tall,
grave-faced, dark-bearded man who walked by his side. "What do you
make of it, Jim?" He addressed the stalwart individual who had but
a moment or so before been coaxing on the camels.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Dick; it's hardly big enough for Kalgoorlie. I
canna think what place it is. Bob, my lad, that's the first error
o' navigation I've known you to make."</p>

<p>So did Mackay's expedition, with its augmented numbers rescued
from the far back Never Never Land, yet with one sad depletion in
the original party, see civilization once more. It would have been
hard indeed to recognize them now, so marked were they by
privation. The stores had been used most sparingly, for the supply
had not been lavish enough to stand the additional strain imposed
upon it by the extra appetites of Bentley's party. So all had
cheerfully pinched and starved themselves throughout the long
journey. But now their sufferings were nearly over; civilization,
in the form of some unknown township or city, was in sight. Bob
alone seemed to be grieved. He had steered an unerring course these
many weeks; and now, when he fancied he was heading for Golden
Flat, it was humiliating to feel that at the very last he had made
some grave miscalculation.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Bob," said Mackay, kindly. "You knew you were safe
enough in your direction."</p>

<p>Bob sighed and shook his head, and consulted his log-book again,
but appeared to derive little satisfaction from his scrutiny. On,
on the worn-out team staggered; and as the welcome settlement
loomed up nearer and nearer the hearts of the wayfarers grew light.
Yet the size of the township confused them; there were several wide
streets in evidence, and one great building in particular arrested
their attention. And yet withal the whole scene seemed strangely
familiar to Mackay and his young companions, and Emu Bill, too,
looked puzzled as he gazed at the strange city so revealed.</p>

<p>"I hope it ain't no mirage," he murmured, with vague
discontent.</p>

<p>"We'll soon know what we've struck," cried Jack. "Here's a
horseman coming out to meet us."</p>

<p>"I thought I knew every bit o' this country," grumbled Mackay,
"but this certainly beats me, though somehow everything looks vera
like a place I prospected before. Anyhow, we'll soon see. Hallo!"
he called out, as the horseman drew rein in front of him and stared
at the travel-worn company in curious amazement. "Hallo! you bold,
bad bushman; what township is this?"</p>

<p>The man replied only with a gaze of more intense amazement than
before, until he was sternly brought to his bearings by the now
irate questioner.</p>

<p>"Say, mate," he protested weakly, "don't bounce a man so sudden.
You all look like Rip Van Winkles, you does, only worse. But you
must be strangers in these parts if you don't know Wentworth City.
Why, it's the biggest min&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>The cry came like a roar from the lips of the nine men at once,
and the startled individual on the horse jerked back in alarm; but
becoming satisfied that his interrogators really desired
information, he proceeded to give it to them.</p>

<p>"Wentworth City, mates, ain't very old, but it has squatted here
to stay. It boomed up like a shot after the diskivery o' a process
for treating the refractory ores in the district. There's simply no
end o' the stuff, an' we expect to get a railway along
shortly."</p>

<p>"How did it get its name?" inquired Mackay, calmly.</p>

<p>"Well, I has only been a couple o' weeks here myself, an' don't
know exactly how it happened; but every one will tell you that it
is called after the diskiverer o' the process which sent it
booming. A young chap, I believe he was, an' he went out exploring
afterwards. But it's mighty funny you doesn't know that much. Say,
you must have come in from out back?"</p>

<p>Mackay nodded briefly. "You've struck it," said he; "but now
tell me if you know a man called Nuggety Dick, and where can we
find him?"</p>

<p>"Nuggety Dick?" echoed the horseman. "Why, you won't have any
trouble finding him. He's the mayor, he is. Go along the main
street right in front o' you&mdash;it is called Mackay
Street&mdash;an' turn down Golden Promise Drive on your right,
an'&mdash;but I'd better go in front an' show
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you'd better," murmured Mackay, feebly; then he reached
out and clasped Bob's hand.</p>

<p><br>
"And so you all mean to have a trip to the old country, boys?" said
Nuggety Dick.</p>

<p>It was about an hour later, and the wanderers were seated in the
mayor's dining-room doing ample justice to the generous fare
provided by that hospitable individual, whose pleasure at meeting
his old friends again had been almost boyish in its glad
exuberance.</p>

<p>"It's over ten years since I left the dear old land, Dick,"
answered Bentley, "and now I should like to see it again. I wanted
to persuade every one to come, but I found they didn't need any
persuading. All but Bill seemed to have taken it as a foregone
conclusion that they were to have a run home as a reward for their
labours."</p>

<p>"An' I would go quick enough, boys," said Emu Bill, quietly,
"but I reckon I'd peg out if I lost sight o' the Southern Cross. I
ain't no traveller, boys; I is only a simple bushman, an' somehow
the grim old desert grips me tight."</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll be able to tell you all about it when I get back,
Bill," said the Shadow. "I is goin' with Jack to see the sights,
an' we'll have a rare good time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope you've made up your mind to behave yoursel'?"
interjected Mackay, severely.</p>

<p>"Surely, boss, you can trust me. I won't even squelch a
policeman unless he looks at me cross-eyed. I'll be gentle as a
little lamb, I will, an' I won't round up no horses nor camels nor
nothin'."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope it's only a trip you're goin' to take, boys, an'
that you'll all come back an' look me up in a month or so," said
Nuggety Dick, earnestly.</p>

<p>They remained talking in this strain for some time; then Mackay
suddenly inquired after his old enemy, Macguire.</p>

<p>"I don't bear the man any ill will," said he. "I'm just sort o'
curious to know if he rose wi' the fortunes o' Wentworth City; that
name must have stuck in his throat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, hasn't you heard?" exclaimed Dick; "but, of course, you
couldn't know. Macguire cleared out 'bout two days after you, an'
every one fancied he meant to follow you up, because he thought you
were goin' to some new strike. He had his old crowd wi' him, an' a
black tracker. He has never come back yet. I reckon he must have
gone under."</p>

<p>"Poor beggar!" murmured Bob. "I hope he manages to come out all
right, but&mdash;&mdash;" He shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"If by any chance he does hit our old trail into the Never
Never, he'll be mighty sorry for it afterwards," spoke Mackay,
grimly, with visions of vengeful savages before his eyes.</p>

<p>That night Bob came into Mackay's room at the hotel where they
were all staying.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you alone," he said simply, "so that I might
tell you how truly I have appreciated your great kindnesses. I know
now who it was that sent that letter to my mother, you dear old
humbug."</p>

<p>Mackay smiled. "My reward is more than I ever dreamed, my lad.
You yourself have given me much by your friendship. I haven't been
disappointed in you, Bob, an' I hope our partnership will no'
finish here."</p>

<p>"I'll be with you every time," cried Bob, heartily.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is, but you can count on me," came a
well-known voice beyond the thin wooden partition, and immediately
afterwards Jack burst into the room. "I thought I heard about
another threatened expedition," he said eagerly, "and I wanted to
sign my name to it right away."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," ventured Mackay, gazing at the boy with
shrewd, twinkling eyes&mdash;"I have an idea, Jack, that when you
get home you'll find a wonderfu' magnetic influence there to
restrain your wandering nature. But all the same, I shouldna wonder
but you'll be allowed to mak' just another journey in my good
company, for Bob has promised to say a word or two in my favour, so
that I won't be judged altogether as an uncouth savage from the
Never Never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is this a corroborree you're holding, Jim?" said Bentley,
suddenly entering the doorway.</p>

<p>"No, Dick, nothing so vera desperate; we were sort o'
considerin' a future expedition, that's a'."</p>

<p>"Already?" laughed Bentley. "Why, man, haven't you knocked
around this little planet enough to last you a lifetime?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is no such thing as contentment in the
world," said Bob, gravely. "We have sought fortune, and we have
found it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, an' we found more than fortune, Bob," added Mackay, gazing
at his old leader affectionately. "The gold and gems are welcome
enough, but the lives o' my comrades are dearer to me than a'."</p>

<p>Bentley laid a gentle hand on Mackay's shoulder, and his voice
was full as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lads," he said, "you will find true happiness, not in
riches nor in the fulfilment of worldly ambition, for our
satisfaction is ever in the striving after rather than in the
attainment of our desires; but it will come to you in the
realization of an unerring truth: greater by far than gold or gems
is the love of our fellow-men."</p>
