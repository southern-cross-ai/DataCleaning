<h3>A CONTEMPORARY REVIEW</h3>

<p class="first">A SUBTLE essence of Victorianism pervades these
"nineteenth century pieces," and there are many signs that Miss
Bowen has enjoyed the writing of them. She is at her very best
when recreating a past, not too far distant to alienate those who
are shy of historical fiction, and far enough to provide excuse
for numerous little embellishments of courtliness, coyness,
dignity and romantic affection. There are stories of ghosts,
elopements, love, murder and mystery. Perhaps the best of all is
"The Crown Derby Plate," but the title story which tells of a
dignified woman of "easy virtue" who is forced to spend an
evening in the company of an ultra-respectable wife and mother is
a very close second. All the stories, whether dramatic, amusing
or macabre have point: their great virtue is that they are
stories, and do not depend upon the finishing touches, graceful
though these are.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a> GRACE LATOUCHE AND THE
WARRINGTONS</h2>

<h3>A STUDY IN MANNERS&mdash;1850</h3>

<p class="first">MRS. LATOUCHE dropped the green damask curtain
between herself and the sleeping youth. The nurse and doctor had
departed with a discreet hush of step, look and gesture, which
distinctly conveyed&mdash;"He had better be alone with you when
he wakes, if he wakes at all..."</p>

<p>Grace Latouche folded her small hands in her lap and leant
back in the low chair; her movements were naturally graceful. It
was a summer afternoon, and this woman had always found a
peculiar quality of tedium in English summer afternoons spent in
the country. The blinds were drawn in the spacious, light and
exactly furnished bedchamber, but Mrs. Latouche could see on the
pale squares of holland the lightly moving shadows of the trees
without, and she visualised perfectly the empty space of the
sunny park that surrounded Warrington Hall.</p>

<p>Custom, order, tradition and conventionality lay over the
whole place like spells&mdash;to Grace Latouche like a blight; as
she mused in the stately quiet of the solitary mansion set in the
large austere landscape she felt as if nothing occurred in this
establishment that had not been sternly regulated for
generations. She was sure that the servants had been in the
family from father to son, from mother to daughter, that the
clocks were all wound at a set hour, that no picture or piece of
furniture had been moved within living memory, that Mrs.
Warrington knew exactly what she possessed in her china closet,
her linen cupboard and her still-room; even a great tragedy, even
a possible sudden death, had not been able to disturb the
immemorial tedium of this English mansion on an English summer
afternoon.</p>

<p>Grace Latouche sighed. She had listened with decorum to the
doctor's solemn talk.</p>

<p>"It is the crisis of the illness, we must be careful, his life
may depend upon your presence."</p>

<p>These sentences hung in her mind. She knew that the doctor and
nurse had thought her too composed; they and the servants had, of
course, all been hostile. The master of the house she had neither
seen nor expected to see; of the mistress she had had one
glimpse. Mrs. Warrington (and Grace Latouche could estimate what
the effort had cost her) had received her in the formal hall.
Repelled by the cold atmosphere of the mansion, by the absence of
the master, Grace Latouche had almost returned to her chariot and
driven back to London, but the other woman's look had induced her
to remain. Mrs. Warrington had been weeping, and her face was
hideous with terrible grief.</p>

<p>"Her son," thought Grace Latouche, "and I suppose he's
dying."</p>

<p>While the footman took (with disdain she was sure) her parasol
and her shawl, Mrs. Latouche had gracefully played with the
buttons of her pearl-coloured gloves which fastened at the wrist,
and, her lovely face shrouded by the plumes of her bonnet, had
listened courteously to Mrs. Warrington's difficult words. But
the only one of the broken sentences that Mrs. Latouche answered
was:</p>

<p>"You will understand that we could do no less than send for
you."</p>

<p>To this she had replied: "And you will understand, Mrs.
Warrington, that I could do no less than come. Shall I go
upstairs and wait?"</p>

<p>"If you will be so good," said the poor trembling mother.</p>

<p>And Grace Latouche thought: "How cowardly of the husband to
leave it all to her!"</p>

<p>Alone in the pale shadowed bedroom Mrs. Latouche watched those
delicate waving shadows on the opaque holland blind and the
languor of her tedium nearly overcame her high spirits. She was a
woman who loved activity and abhorred the kind of life typified
in Warrington Hall. Never could she recall any time passing so
slowly as this time measured by the porcelain clock on the
mantelshelf&mdash;five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an
hour, twenty minutes, half an hour, and still the pale young man
had not stirred; his outline showed rigid beneath the quilted and
flourished-satin coverlet.</p>

<p>Grace Latouche moved the curtain again. He lay as the nurse
had arranged him, sunk in the flounced pillows. On his handsome
face was that look of illness and dishevelled fatigue that is so
pathetic on the countenance of extreme youth. His left arm and
shoulder were swathed in bandages.</p>

<p>They had told her that he had shot himself for love of her;
the bullet had been extracted but pleurisy was feared.</p>

<p>"It would be a fight"&mdash;the doctor had used the
conventional phrases&mdash;"for his life." And it was supposed
that the best chance of safety lay in the presence of the woman
for whose sake he had committed&mdash;Grace Latouche again in her
mind quoted the doctor&mdash;"this desperate act."</p>

<p>"One never knows," that had always been her philosophy; but
she was surprised and startled that Harry Warrington, of all
people, should have committed this&mdash;Mrs. Latouche
substituted for the doctor's words another&mdash;"folly." She had
known him quite well&mdash;in Paris, in London, as she had known
also quite well dozens of such young men. She was very sorry when
the agonized appeal of the distracted mother had come to her
little house in Cork Street; she had never hesitated a moment in
her response. She was extremely grieved, she was also extremely
bored, and she asked herself&mdash;Would she be expected to sit
for hours in this sick chamber?</p>

<p>They were treating the whole affair as if it were sacred and
required a kind of ritual, and she smiled to herself, having an
unfortunate kind of wit, and wondered, "Was she the priestess or
the victim of these solemn rites?" Would the family continue to
ignore her? The Honourable George Warrington shut in his
study&mdash;the Honourable Mrs. Warrington shut into her
boudoir...And what&mdash;she could not help a further smile at
that&mdash;did they intend to do if the beloved Harry
recovered?</p>

<p>A maid brought in tea, an elaborate refreshment which she
arrayed in decorous silence on a rosewood table.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Warrington, ma'am, thought you'd rather have it here
than come down to the drawing-room."</p>

<p>Grace Latouche smiled.</p>

<p>"Naturally," she replied, and thought: "I suppose I am good
enough for Harry's bedroom but not for his mother's
drawing-room."</p>

<p>The maid was subdued to utter decorum, but Mrs. Latouche
caught in her eye a feminine flash over the pearl-grey French
gown garnished with knots of sarcenet ribbon, the heavy lace
cuffs and fichu, the bonnet, the silvered feathers, the carved
cornelian garniture&mdash;all so different from anything the girl
would have seen before at Warrington Hall.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I shall do very well," said Mrs. Latouche.</p>

<p>"And you are to ring the bell, ma'am, if you require anything
more."</p>

<p>"I'll not be likely to require anything more."</p>

<p>The tea was lavish&mdash;exquisite cakes, hothouse fruits,
filigree silver, embroidered linen but she was to eat it alone.
Mrs. Latouche was not offended. The maid, at the door, said very
respectfully:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Warrington will be joining you, ma'am."</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche's surprise was hidden under a casual "Thank
you." She noticed then that there were two cups and two plates,
and she was curiously touched. It was always difficult for her to
see anybody forfeit something they cherished, and she knew that
Mrs. Warrington, in coming to drink tea with her, was forfeiting
something highly valued indeed.</p>

<p>The mistress of the house entered, the other lady rose, and
they gave each other a small curtsey. Mrs. Warrington looked
steadily at her son, pulled the curtains a little further on the
poles as if shielding him from some visible annoyance, flicked at
a speck on the coverlet and joined Mrs. Latouche at the
tea-table.</p>

<p>"You have had everything you require, Mrs. Latouche, the maid
has shown you into the other room where you can make your toilet
and repose yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have everything I require, thank you, Mrs. Warrington, but
I have preferred to remain here."</p>

<p>"That I can understand, I also should prefer that we remain
here. If we drink our tea quietly I do not think we shall disturb
Harry, and I should like to be quite near, you know, in
case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mrs. Latouche.</p>

<p>Their glances just brushed each other. They were both too
well-bred for their curiosity to have any offence in it. Mrs.
Latouche thought, "She has never met a woman like me before, and
I really cannot remember now when I last met a woman like her.
Yet I understand her so well. She looks fifty, but I suppose she
is not so very far from my own age."</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington wore a dress of steel-blue bombazine, a
matron's cap, collar and cuffs, a gold chain across her bosom.
She was the type of whom people say vaguely&mdash;"I should think
she was handsome once."</p>

<p>"It was good of you to come, Mrs. Latouche."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Mrs. Warrington, I could do no less, as I
remarked before."</p>

<p>"You will understand, Mrs. Latouche, that this has all been a
very great shock to me and must excuse any defect in your
reception." She poured out the tea and added, above the other
woman's murmured acceptance of these apologies, "You will excuse
my husband, he would have wished to receive you, but he is
entirely overcome and has shut himself in the library
since&mdash;since the accident."</p>

<p>"Pray do not concern yourself," replied Mrs. Latouche; "I came
here for one purpose only, that which you desired of me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington handed her the cup of tea and took this
occasion to look at her straightly&mdash;at the lovely face, the
bare throat, the upper bosom above the rich lace, the auburn
curls rolling over the fine shoulders, at the delicate fingers
which glittered with too many and too large jewels.</p>

<p>"It must have been a great shock to you," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Of course, Mrs. Warrington, I was very distressed; I knew
Harry"&mdash;fearful of giving offence she slurred that
over&mdash;"your son&mdash;well, we had met in London, in Paris,
and, two years ago I believe, in Rome."</p>

<p>"My son travels a great deal," said Mrs. Warrington, flatly.
"He is very young and has distressed his father on many
occasions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," interrupted Mrs. Latouche, gently. "When I
received your note this morning I knew I could not do otherwise
than come immediately, but I am afraid that you do not quite
understand the situation between myself and your son, Mrs.
Warrington."</p>

<p>The mother glanced at the bed, the other woman was almost
afraid before the courage and the resolution that showed in that
look.</p>

<p>"I must tell you, Mrs. Latouche, exactly what happened."</p>

<p>"Is there any occasion, Mrs. Warrington, to give yourself
pain?"</p>

<p>"My pain is of absolutely no moment," replied the other woman
with a quiver of her lip. "I have to tell you what occurred. My
son, Harry, interviewed his father on the question of yourself.
He wished, as you must know, Mrs. Latouche, to marry you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, I did not know that." She was aware that the other woman
thought she was lying.</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington hurried on with her narrative.</p>

<p>"It seems, from what his father tells me, that he became quite
frantic and violent at the first hint of opposition. This is
difficult to put to you without offence."</p>

<p>"I never take offence," murmured Grace Latouche; "it is hardly
ever worth while."</p>

<p>"My husband is a man of most rigid principles; I dare
say"&mdash;and this was spoken with an effort&mdash;"to you and
your world, a narrow-minded and hard man, Mrs. Latouche. He
considered that&mdash;he and I had decided"&mdash;proudly she
associated herself with her husband&mdash;"that this marriage was
altogether unsuitable; Harry is only nineteen and you, Mrs.
Latouche&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said that lady, gently, "your husband, Mrs.
Warrington, described me 'as old enough to be his mother.' I was
born in eighteen-ten, the year famous for the comet, the vintage
and for myself, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are older than my son, Mrs. Latouche, that is admitted,
and of a different experience&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish you would not disturb yourself with this recital. I
can comprehend the whole interview so well...Poor Harry, I am
very grieved. His father, I suppose, gave him the most absolute
refusal?"</p>

<p>"I must admit that he did, Mrs. Latouche. There was a quarrel
between them; I could hear angry voices, that is very uncommon
for my husband is of a most controlled disposition. Harry left
the room in an extremely agitated condition. I entered soon after
to soothe his father. There was a miniature of yourself on the
table&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are many about," said Mrs. Latouche, "I fear even they
may be purchased from various artists&mdash;against my will, but
there it is. I have never given Harry a miniature."</p>

<p>Again she knew that the other woman thought she was lying.
"She will believe, I suppose, that creatures like myself always
lie," she thought, wearily, "so I had best be silent and listen
to what she has to say."</p>

<p>"Harry went straight to the gunroom," continued Mrs.
Warrington; "before I could get the brief facts from his father
someone&mdash;one of the grooms&mdash;heard the
shot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg you, Mrs. Warrington, do not thus discompose yourself.
You must have had a most terrible, a most exhausting experience;
believe me, you have my intense sympathy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington held herself rigid.</p>

<p>"That sounds grotesque," she said, breaking through her own
formal decorum.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it does," said Mrs. Latouche. "The situation is a
little grotesque, is it not? I am doing my best, but I also must
explain something to you. Harry has never asked me to marry him,
and if he had ever done so I should have refused."</p>

<p>She saw a look of blank incredulity and offended horror in the
matron's face; she added, in a deprecating tone:</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mrs. Warrington, I suppose it seems very peculiar to
you that women like myself do receive offers of marriage and do
refuse them. You see, it is rather difficult for me to get back
into your world, though it is one that I was bred in. I am, by
birth, a gentlewoman and I can, therefore, understand your point
of view. No doubt the least name that you would give me is 'the
notorious Mrs. Latouche.'"</p>

<p>"We tried to think of you," said Mrs. Warrington, in an
unsteady tone, "as a woman whom my poor Harry loved, adored."</p>

<p>"It is very ingenuous and charming of Harry to adore me, but,
well&mdash;he is not the only one. I have known others
recover."</p>

<p>"I suppose, Mrs. Latouche, there have been no other young men
committing suicide for you?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" said the lady, gravely. "And this&mdash;this
accident&mdash;I cannot understand. I have given your son no
encouragement, but I suppose I shall have difficulty in
persuading you of that. He was no more to me than one of the
companions of a companion, one of the young men who came to my
salon, a friend of a friend&mdash;I hardly believe that we had
three interviews alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does any of that matter?" cried Mrs. Warrington. "There
is the fact." She looked again towards the bed.</p>

<p>"But I cannot understand why Harry should have gone to his
father for his consent to a marriage which had never been even
suggested to me," said Mrs. Latouche. "The poor boy must have
completely lost his sense of&mdash;of humour, shall we say, Mrs.
Warrington?"</p>

<p>For the first time since this strange interview began Mrs.
Warrington showed definite hostility towards her guest.</p>

<p>"Harry could hardly have supposed that he would have been
refused," she said; and behind her was all the force and majesty
of rank, money, position and an honourable name.</p>

<p>She contrived in the tone in which she uttered that brief
sentence to name Mrs. Latouche "outcast" as plainly as if she had
spoken the words, but the other woman's equanimity was not
disturbed, she had the perhaps fatal gift of always seeing the
other person's point of view and she could very well put herself
in Mrs. Warrington's place. She thought to herself, not without
tenderness:</p>

<p>"Poor woman, to her I am an adventuress, a Jezebel, why, I
suppose she doesn't know the name she thinks I ought to have, and
she's his mother and has no other child, and I dare swear her
husband is a black tyrant, cold and violent; yet, why should I
pity her? After all, she thinks herself so much my superior and
knows very little of anything. She's his mother&mdash;but, what's
that but a mere animal function, yet she stakes so much pride on
it? I've been a mother, too, but was I any the better for it? My
baby is in a Roman cemetery&mdash;she's never had that
experience, why should I pity her?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington was looking at her guest with her pale
formidable eyes, at once cold and eager.</p>

<p>"You have overthrown all my plans," she said. "I
intended&mdash;yes, Mrs. Latouche, this will surprise you very
much&mdash;but I intended to ask my husband for his consent to
this marriage."</p>

<p>"That would have meant a great sacrifice on your part, I am
sure," replied Grace Latouche, quietly, "and I am obliged to you
for the compliment, I honour you for your self-abnegation.
Believe me, I could not, in any circumstances have married your
son."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Mrs. Warrington.</p>

<p>"Must I give you my reasons? He is too young, he&mdash;well, I
don't love him, Mrs. Warrington."</p>

<p>"But love," stammered the matron, as if she had not taken that
word over her lips for many years; "but love, Mrs. Latouche, is
this a question of love?"</p>

<p>The other lady interrupted these stammerings:</p>

<p>"I suppose you think, Mrs. Warrington, that with women like me
love does not enter into our&mdash;shall we say, without
offence&mdash;our bargains? Marriages can be bargains, too, you
know. I have been married twice, but each time for love. Love
does not always last, you know; but that does not say that while
it endures it is not genuine. But I speak of affairs which have
not been marriage, but which have had in them love and, while
they lasted, fidelity. I do not want to hurt you, I wish to make
it clear why I should not marry your son."</p>

<p>"You will find it difficult to convince me of that," replied
Mrs. Warrington, and her tone was now stern as if she were aware
that she dealt with a sly and subtle adventuress.</p>

<p>"How can I convince you?" smiled Grace Latouche. "I must
convince you, there can be no false pretences about this. I have
come to be near your son until he recovers consciousness, I want
myself to make him see reason; I want him to tell you before me
that I never encouraged him; there was never talk of any
entanglement."</p>

<p>"This is extraordinary," murmured Mrs. Warrington.</p>

<p>"Believe me, Mrs. Warrington, I find it most extraordinary. I
am deeply distressed, I wish to assist you, but you must believe
me. Perhaps," she added, "you will believe me if I tell you that
I am in love with someone else."</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington flushed a dull unbecoming red.</p>

<p>"There was another name mentioned," she muttered, looking
aside. "I heard it&mdash;Count Alexis..."</p>

<p>"Count Alexis Poniatowski," said Mrs. Latouche; "yes, his name
has been connected with mine. You will have heard, perhaps, that
he has stayed at my cottage, Villa Violetta, outside Parma!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington appeared to shudder and Mrs. Latouche
smiled.</p>

<p>"I suppose that all sounds very gaudy and theatrical to you?
But, really, there <i>are</i> violets there, you know, fields of
them, that is how the Villa gets the name. I know," she added, in
a tone of sympathy, "when one is in England on an afternoon like
this or, even more so, on a Sunday, these things seem quite
impossible, but they are there. I believe you would really like
the Villa Violetta and the violets. They have the three colours
in two varieties&mdash;double and single; white, deep purple and
light mauve. And, as for Count Alexis Poniatowski, he is most
interesting and cultured&mdash;you must not think of him, please,
because of his name&mdash;as I know English people do&mdash;as
quite a cheapjack, you know..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington was silent, she seemed to wither and withdraw
into herself.</p>

<p>"But it is not of this gentleman I would speak, there is
another man; I have met someone who, if the chance offered, I
would marry."</p>

<p>"But he has not asked you to marry him?" asked Mrs.
Warrington, who seemed to feel her way stiffly about an alien and
hostile world.</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Latouche, "he has not asked me. I met him in
romantic circumstances, in France; I have entertained at my
little house in the rue du Bac; we have corresponded. It is quite
a delicate little affair I am telling you of, Mrs. Warrington; I
want you to know where my heart lies."</p>

<p>Mrs. Warrington rose.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Latouche," she said, sternly; "I cannot conceive how
Harry could have been so mistaken. You must excuse me for
troubling you&mdash;I had no conception that this could be the
truth; you must forgive me if I doubt, even now, it is the
truth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche also rose.</p>

<p>"We must not dispute," she said, sweetly; "we might awake your
son."</p>

<p>"But what am I to say to him," exclaimed Mrs. Warrington,
"when he does wake? It is almost better that you went, that he
did not see you."</p>

<p>"That is as you please. I came here on your urgent summons and
also because I had to tell you that there was some mistake."</p>

<p>"And I suppose," said Mrs. Warrington, leaning against one of
the posts of her son's bed, as if unable any longer to stand
upright without support, "that it was stupid of me to expect any
candour from you."</p>

<p>"I suppose you've heard dreadful things of me, Mrs.
Warrington?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the other woman, "I have heard nothing at all,
except your name, and that is quite the worst, you understand,
when one hears nothing of a woman but her name, and just notice
how people look..."</p>

<p>"I see," replied Mrs. Latouche, thoughtfully, "that is how it
is done, is it? I have often wondered how ideas about women like
me are conveyed to women like you; now I understand&mdash;just
the name and a look."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we do not discuss you or your companions at all,"
said Mrs. Warrington, breathing quickly.</p>

<p>"No, I understand, I was brought up like that myself, Mrs.
Warrington. Now, I am afraid we disturb your son, he is beginning
to move a little. Do you want me to go or stay?"</p>

<p>In an instant, Mrs. Warrington was all maternal terror.</p>

<p>"No, you must stay, indeed you must; your name was his last
word." She hurried to the door, whispering in the pompous doctor
and the officious nurse, who were waiting in the anteroom.</p>

<p>Grace Latouche moved to the head of the bed. The young man was
stirring as if from a natural sleep. She ventured to touch his
hand, then his brow&mdash;surely of a normal coolness? The
hastening doctor confirmed her hopes, the fever had fallen, the
young man had sunk from the last swooning delirium of illness
into a healthy sleep. He opened his eyes, conscious,
clear-headed; he smiled at his mother and Mrs. Latouche. In tones
of guarded tenderness Mrs. Warrington said, bending over the
pillow:</p>

<p>"You see she is here, Harry; I sent for her at once. She came
and has been waiting by your bed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche despised herself for noticing the accomplished
way in which Mrs. Warrington dropped into the part of the
ministering angel, and the delicacy with which she stressed her
own sacrifice in sending for the outcast.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mother, I'd like to speak to her," whispered
Harry.</p>

<p>"Not now, my dear boy, you are not strong enough."</p>

<p>"I'm quite strong enough, thank you, Mother, and I'd rather
get it off my mind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could tell me in a very few words," said Mrs.
Latouche, looking with soft compassion at the pallid face and
shadowed eyes; she was thinking of herself, too, for was she not
quite indifferent to the young man save as regarded pity? And how
impossible to spend the night in Warrington Hall, with a master
who would not see her and a mistress who had to make an effort
not to draw her skirts aside! The young man, Mrs. Latouche
admitted reluctantly to herself, must be, what she had never
suspected him to be, a fool.</p>

<p>With her (no doubt unconscious) air of renunciation and
sacrifice the mother tiptoed away, followed by the solemn doctor
and the blank-faced nurse.</p>

<p>Grace Latouche's manner became more natural when relieved of
these formal presences. She sat down by the bed, reached for the
sick youth's hand and said, reprovingly:</p>

<p>"Why, Harry, how did you come to be so foolish? I would hardly
have believed it. I thought you was so sensible."</p>

<p>Harry smiled and not, as she noticed instantly, in any
languishing or lovesick fashion.</p>

<p>"What have they been telling you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That you asked your father's permission to marry me, that
when he refused you went off in a pet and shot yourself. Your
poor mother is in torment and, I suppose, your father is too;
though for him I have less pity. And what were you doing with my
miniature? I never gave you one."</p>

<p>"They have got the whole thing wrong from beginning to end.
They sent for you?" whispered Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, but ought you to talk, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I must talk. You won't wish to stay, will you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to if I can get away. But, do tell me what
it all means. You don't look to me as if you were dying of
love."</p>

<p>"The shot&mdash;that was an accident&mdash;a confounded
accident. I was in a temper and went to the gunroom, started
cleaning a pair of pistols and didn't notice that one was
loaded... That's all there is to that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche laughed with relief.</p>

<p>"Why, let us have your mother in and tell her immediately."
She reached out her hand for the bellrope. But the boy said in a
thick whisper:</p>

<p>"Don't, please don't; I've got something else to tell
you&mdash;I'd rather she went on thinking that I did it because
of you. You see, my father and I did have a quarrel, and about
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, won't you please come closer to the bed? I'm not very
strong yet and I feel that I shall go to sleep again, but I want
you to help me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, I 'llhelp you, Harry, I came here to help you; but
I feel so relieved that you didn't do it intentionally, and
because of me. Tell me now, honestly, Harry, I didn't lead you on
and make you fall in love with me, did I?"</p>

<p>The dark head on the sumptuous pillow shook "No."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so relieved, I never wanted to do that to anyone. I
have told your mother, and I'd like to tell you, Harry, there's
someone else whom I met in Paris&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want you to tell me about that," said the boy. He
closed his eyes and appeared exhausted, but his words though low
were distinct.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Latouche, you see I know all about it."</p>

<p>"You know all about it&mdash;about my little romance in
Paris?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and that was what the quarrel was about. You did give a
miniature to that man, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a little violet morocco case."</p>

<p>"Well, if you were to go into the library now you'd find it
there, unless he's destroyed it. You see, Mrs. Latouche," he
moved his head so as not to see her, "that man is my father. He
was staying at the Embassy in Paris and he met you in the
Luxembourg&mdash;someone told me about it. He didn't give you his
real name. My mother knows nothing at all."</p>

<p>Grace Latouche laughed quickly, she could always pick herself
up quickly after she had been thrown: she said swiftly to
herself&mdash;"After all, is the marriage of this boy's mother so
much? I guessed he went under an assumed name and was married.
But, how infinitely more charming and interesting than
Harry&mdash;Harry's father! the man whom I imagined to be a dull
provincial tyrant!"</p>

<p>"But what had it to do with you?" she asked, "and how did you
venture to speak to him about it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;it came up&mdash;I made an occasion...then
there was the miniature and one or two other things. I could see
that he was really&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"In love, I suppose?" said Mrs. Latouche.</p>

<p>"I don't like to think that."</p>

<p>"What were you considering?"</p>

<p>"Just one person&mdash;my mother."</p>

<p>"That woman," whispered Mrs. Latouche.</p>

<p>"Well, she's also in love&mdash;if you like to put it that
way&mdash;and has been for the last twenty-five years. I suppose
he and I are all she's got, and&mdash;I'd rather she thought I
was a confounded fool, infatuated with you, and shot myself, than
know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;that he, perhaps, came to stay with me in the Villa
Violetta?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You won't let him do it, will you?" he added with a
childlike accent.</p>

<p>"Your mother is a stranger to me, Harry, and I don't know you
very well. I have long since ceased to be bound by&mdash;just
convention, tradition."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be sorry for her."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't she be sorry for me?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there's been anybody else, and if you were to
leave him alone...You see, he's really fond of her. They've been
extremely happy until now." His voice was becoming very
faint.</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche rose.</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk so much," she said.</p>

<p>She put on her bonnet over her smooth fashionable curls and
tied the sarcenet ribbons under her chin.</p>

<p>"I'll go now. I suppose he excused himself, when she found the
miniature, by putting it on to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What are you going to tell my mother?" he asked,
drowsily.</p>

<p>She did not answer but touched the bell.</p>

<p>Instantly, Mrs. Warrington, the doctor and nurse were on the
threshold.</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche swept up to them.</p>

<p>"Harry and I have had a candid talk," she said. "He is quite
cured of his folly, his illness has effaced his&mdash;whimsey. It
often does, you know&mdash;a kind of fever that passes with a
little bloodletting. He will not disturb you with his
'infatuation' any longer, Mrs. Warrington. He is quite
sensible."</p>

<p>A flush and tremble of joy broke over Mrs. Warrington's
features and by that the other woman could gauge how deep her
sufferings had been, how hard the restraint she had put on
herself. She held out a hand which she had not done before. She
followed Mrs. Latouche to the door, while doctor and nurse
decorously bent over the bed where their patient was again
falling into a natural drowsiness.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Latouche."</p>

<p>They were out on the landing. Mrs. Warrington added,
impetuously:</p>

<p>"I am sure you are a good woman at heart."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Warrington, and please don't take my hand if
you'd rather not..."</p>

<p>"I should not like to hurt you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've hurt you, Mrs. Warrington."</p>

<p>"Well, after all, there's a good deal I don't understand. I
should like to take your hand, and, please, may I wish you good
luck and felicity with whomever it was&mdash;the man you said you
would marry if you had the chance?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, again."</p>

<p>They clasped hands and dropped a little curtsey.</p>

<p>"Please go back to your son, Mrs. Warrington."</p>

<p>Grace Latouche went alone down the stairs. Behind her tinkled
the bell to summon a footman. She walked slowly. On the next
landing were two large doors. The footman waited for her before
one of them. She asked him coolly:</p>

<p>"Where do those doors lead to?"</p>

<p>"One, ma'am, to the library, the other to Mr. Warrington's
study."</p>

<p>Mrs. Latouche paused, slowly buttoning her short
pearl-coloured gloves at the wrist.</p>

<p>How easy to scribble a line on a leaf torn from her tablets,
to send the footman away on some excuse to fetch her shawl or
parasol, and slip a message under the door. Or, again, how easy
to hand it to the footman, saying, "Pray take that to your
master."</p>

<p>But what would that message be? "I have found out who you are,
it makes no difference, meet me in the rue du Bac or in the Villa
Violetta."</p>

<p>Easy to let him know that she was not outraged, or shocked, or
frightened; that, in brief, she really loved him beyond all such
considerations. Did she not owe him so much outward compassion?
Had he not, enclosed in there, suffered more than his wife, or
Harry, or herself? Harry would recover. Mrs. Warrington would
always have Harry.</p>

<p>Grace Latouche took a long time to button her gloves. She told
the footman to go ahead of her, to get her parasol, her shawl, to
see if her chariot were ready. Poor Mrs. Warrington had wished
her, with what pain and effort she, Grace Latouche, could
value&mdash;"Good luck" in her love affair, and she had said, "I
believe you are a good woman at heart." Mrs. Latouche knew what
Mrs. Warrington meant by "a good woman."</p>

<p>She leant against the door, a charming figure in her frivolous
Parisian dress of flowing silken folds, her furbelowed bonnet and
rich laces. She seemed a butterfly that the lightest breeze would
blow to its destiny. She did not touch the handle of the door,
nor write a note to slip underneath. She said, very low, an echo
of a whisper:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dear," and went downstairs, got into her chariot
and drove back to Cork Street.</p>

<p>When she arrived there she lowered her veil for her face was
as disfigured from weeping as had been Mrs. Warrington's face
when she had met her that morning.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a> MISS LUCY'S TWO VISITORS</h2>

<h3>A MIDSUMMER PICNIC&mdash;1810</h3>

<p class="first">
WHEN she could no longer hear the last echoes of the departing
carriage-wheels, a sense of desolation overcame Lucy's already
drooping spirits. She was pierced by the childish pang of "being
left behind," that indescribable regret which comes from seeing
off a gay party of pleasure from which you are the only one
omitted. Even most of the servants had gone on the picnic and
Lucy was alone with Mrs. Bartlet and a maid. Three carriages and
the light wagonette, laden with laughing people and baskets of
provisions, had driven off merrily to Okestead Woods to hold
there the great picnic for Emily's birthday.</p>

<p>Only Lucy had been left behind.</p>

<p>Lucy stood at the window of the drawing-room and looked on to
the long terrace. It was early morning and already very warm.
To-day would be cloudless and very sunny, everyone had predicted
that, as amid laughter and merriment they had entered the
carriages, all eager for the picnic. Lucy had helped to pack the
baskets and tie the ribbons round the birthday cake. She had felt
rather like a heroine, for everyone was so sorry that she was not
able to join them in the long-anticipated festival. Her sisters,
Caroline and Emily, had clung round her neck, almost with tears
in their eyes amid their kisses.</p>

<p>"Dear Lucy! Sweet Lucy! what a pity! How unfortunate! Are you
quite sure you cannot come?"</p>

<p>Then her mother, so tender and regretful, and her father
disappointed in the midst of his pleasure, and Mary Fenwicke, her
close friend, protesting that she would not go but stay behind to
keep Lucy company; and Kate Sorrel, offering to return at midday
and "see how Lucy did"; and Aunt Charlotte who had had to be
almost pushed into the carriage, so desirous was she of remaining
with Lucy; and Uncle Ambrose, with hearty kindness declaring that
it was all nonsense and that he was sure Lucy could come with
them. Then the young men, Mr. Matchet, Mr. Lemoine and Mr. Gray,
all declaring that the picnic would be robbed of its brightest
lustre if Miss Lucy did not condescend to keep them company,
until Emily began to pout in pretence of a jealousy and all
laughed together; but Lucy continued to excuse herself. Really,
she could not come; yes, she had felt like a heroine then, the
centre of all that love and tenderness, affection, consideration
and kindness.</p>

<p>Now that they had really gone without her, now that the last
farewells had been waved and there was silence in the house, in
the gardens and on the terrace, and the long sunny summer day
quite empty of events was before her, Lucy felt no longer like a
heroine, but rather like a naughty child who, for some
misdemeanour, has been deprived of a treat. She began to wonder
why she had refused to go. Certainly, last spring&mdash;that
late, long cold spring&mdash;she had been quite seriously ill,
but now she was completely recovered and, though the doctor had
said she must not exert herself or become excited or fatigued,
she had not given much heed to that mandate until to-day. But
this morning, after waking up early and joining the chattering
group who were congratulating Emily on being nineteen years of
age, and after presenting the beloved sister with a sarcenet bag
exactly flowered by herself, she had felt a sudden languor and a
complete inability to join the picnic, a panic terror at the
thought of being in the midst of all that cheerful good company
and overcome by sudden illness; so she had confided to her mother
that she did not feel able to go and Mrs. Middleton had anxiously
agreed that it would be far better for Lucy to remain quietly at
home with Mrs. Bartlet.</p>

<p>The picnic was to be at Okestead Woods and the drive was long;
the day, too, would be long, for they intended to stay until the
full moon was high. Two of the gentlemen had flutes and there
would be dancing and singing, perhaps a charade. Yes, it would
all be very exciting and fatiguing, and it would be far wiser for
Lucy, if she felt nervous or languid, to remain at home.</p>

<p>Lucy did not really want to remain and she disliked very much
the idea of giving herself any importance, or, possibly, clouding
the pleasure of others. Yet there was an ominous throbbing in her
temples, a sense of faintness over all her limbs, a palpitation
in her bosom which warned her that if she joined the picnic she
would be but a burden to others and a misery to herself.</p>

<p>Well, the question had been decided and she had been left
behind, standing on the terrace in the sunny early morning, with
silence about her and a long empty day before her; presently this
same warmth and silence began to soothe her. Her wave of
disappointment passed and she was grateful that there was this
long spell of quietness ahead; she would have nothing to do for
hours and hours, but sit in the warmth, or perhaps sleep, or
gossip a little with Mrs. Bartlet, her old nurse. Yes, after all
the regrets had gone, she was glad that she had found the courage
to say that she could not face the picnic.</p>

<p>She felt very languid and fatigued, it was delicious to be
alone and know that there was absolutely nothing to do. The sun
would go on shining for hours and after that there would be the
moon. There was no cloud in the sky nor any care in her mind;
even that piece of needlework for Emily, which had rather weighed
on her (for she was often weary and had to force herself to do
the fine embroidery), even that was finished. She had learned,
too, her new piece on the harp, which had been of some
difficulty; no need to worry any more over that. No one would
come near her all day, for everyone knew that this was Emily's
birthday and that the whole family always went on this fourth of
August to Okestead Woods.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet would give her the luncheon she most liked;
afterwards, perhaps, she would go and lie in the <i>chaise
longue</i> under the cedar trees, or wander into the warm garden
where the peaches bloomed, or, perhaps, if she felt strong
enough, go as far as the wishing-well in the woods of Ruslake
Manor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet brought a chair out on to the terrace and without
fussing, folded a long white silk shawl with a heavy fringe round
Lucy's frail shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Bartlet, but the sun is warm!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear, it's possible you might get a chill,
even on a day like this. Now you don't feel moped and melancholy,
do you, the others being gone?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did a little at first," confessed Lucy shyly, "but
now somehow I feel glad that there's nothing to do; isn't it
delicious here, Mrs. Bartlet&mdash;like one of those places in a
fairy tale, under an enchantment, you know."</p>

<p>She settled herself into the comfortable chair and drew round
her muslin gown the silk shawl, she liked the feel of it on her
bare arms and the warmth of the sun coming through the silk. She
folded her sandalled feet on the footstool Mrs. Bartlet had
brought and smiled at her kind attendant.</p>

<p>"It seems a sad shame, miss, that you should be denied the
pleasure of the picnic after such a long preparation and looking
forward to it. That was it, you did too much and overtaxed your
strength. You know the doctor said that you'd got to be
careful."</p>

<p>"Well, I am being careful to-day," smiled Lucy; "I am just
going to lie here and do nothing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet looked at her with tender affection and thought,
with a swelling pride, how beautiful this young nursling of hers
was&mdash;Miss Caroline and Miss Emily were pretty girls, but
Miss Lucy was like an angel, the old nurse believed. She had
clusters of pale hair, a complexion so delicate and with such a
wild-rose stain in the cheek, features of so pure an outline and
eyes of such a radiant blue... Mrs. Bartlet considered, with a
kind of satisfaction, that probably the picnic had been spoilt
for all the young gentlemen by the absence of Miss Lucy. She had
seen Mr. Gray's look when he heard the news...</p>

<p>"Well, they weren't any of them good enough for Miss Lucy;
there was no one in the whole neighbourhood good enough for Miss
Lucy, and that was the trouble of it&mdash;no one good
enough."</p>

<p>"Shall I bring you your needlework, miss, or a book?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Mrs. Bartlet, I'll just do nothing; for a
while, at least."</p>

<p>Alone on the terrace Lucy also was thinking of Mr. Gray. She
knew then, what she had not been quite sure of before, that she
was glad to be rid of Mr. Gray and his little timid attentions;
she "half"-liked him and she tried to puzzle out why only "half."
She had had of course insistent and secret dreams of what a young
man should look like and how he should behave, and, to a certain
extent, Mr. Gray had fulfilled the ideals exacted by those
dreams, but only if she looked at him glancingly, sideways; if
she ventured (and it was not often that she had so ventured) to
gaze at him directly, or to consider him seriously, not only had
he not fulfilled her ideals, but there was something about him
that irritated, almost disgusted, her&mdash;little imperfections
which, to her fastidiousness, had been distasteful, just a look,
or an accent, or a line wrong, and she had wished to flee him for
ever. Yes, she was glad to be rid not only of the excitement,
hurry and confusion of the picnic, but also of the courtesy and
attention of Mr. John Gray.</p>

<p>As the sun grew stronger, rising in a steady blaze behind the
old red-brick manor-house, Mrs. Bartlet brought out a parasol and
fastened it cleverly above the chair; Miss Lucy did not yet care
to move, but lay there languidly.</p>

<p>Large single red roses spread their petals over the brick
front of the house. She gazed at these two shades of colour close
together&mdash;the hard, purplish bricks and the frail crimson
roses; even as she looked some of the petals fell from the golden
stamens and dropped on the terrace; white butterflies, the
quintessence of summer luxury and idleness, floated past. When
the faint sweet summer breeze stirred the heavy blue air, a waft
of perfume of fruit and flowers was borne to Lucy's nostrils.</p>

<p>She could not remember the house ever having been so empty
before; when she turned her head she could see through the long
windows into the drawing-room&mdash;all the familiar possessions,
her little desk, her harp, Emily's workbox, the portrait of their
grandmother, the marble chimneypiece, the shelves with all the
books she had known since childhood&mdash;never before could she
remember the drawing-room empty like that.</p>

<p>Then all the rooms above&mdash;the bedrooms, the little
sittingroom&mdash;all empty! their windows open on the summer
air. She began to muse on how old the house might be, and how
many generations of Middletons might have passed up and down
those shallow stairs from the drawing-room now empty to the
bedrooms now empty...</p>

<p>How old was the climbing rose tree, glowing against the
bricks? How many years since those steps had been laid down which
led to the stone-flagged garden, and the sundial amidst bushes of
myrtle and rosemary? For the first time in her life Lucy
Middleton did not seem herself to belong definitely to her own
time and generation, but to be part of the silent empty house,
the silent empty garden, and one of the company of all those
other people who had once crossed this terrace.</p>

<p>She fell asleep, and when she awoke felt much better and
declared to the watching Mrs. Bartlet that she was indeed quite
recovered and that if the picnic had been starting now she would
have been ready to join them. She looked indeed, the gratified
nurse thought, not only well but blooming...for a long while she
had not coughed.</p>

<p>Lucy went into the empty drawing-room where the blinds were
drawn against the sun and ate some of the carefully-prepared
luncheon, specially set for her there. Mrs. Bartlet remained to
keep her company and they began talking about Okestead Woods.
That, apart from Lucy's absence, had been the one blot upon a
charming day. Mr. Middleton had long wished to purchase Okestead
Woods which had been the scene of all the family's picnics and
which lay exactly on the borders of his estate.</p>

<p>"I do think Lord Weybourne might sell them to the master,"
lamented Mrs. Bartlet.</p>

<p>And Lucy said: "Well, he might answer&mdash;Father has written
twice, you know, but there has been no reply. Of course Lord
Weybourne is always in London, but there's the steward. I suppose
there is an explanation."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, miss; the master would have been delighted if
to-day, Miss Emily's birthday, he could have said the woods were
his. And, after all, they're not worth anything, and with all the
land there is belonging to the Hall one wood or less wouldn't
make any difference."</p>

<p>"I expect it's all right," smiled Lucy. "Father will hear
soon, but, as you say, it would have been much pleasanter if he
could have heard to-day."</p>

<p>After luncheon she went upstairs, according to the dainty
habit of a lifetime, to change her morning dress. She put on
(though she was alone and to gratify what whim she knew not, for
she was very free of vanity) a fine figured silk with a broad
blue ribbon fastening under her breast. Then she came downstairs
and, taking out her harp, played over her piece; then went to the
harpsichord and sang over the song that she had been diligently
learning:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Angels ever bright and fair,<br>

Waft, O waft me to your care!"</p>

<br>

<p>"It's a sad thing, that, Miss Lucy."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it is in a way, but it's pretty, too, and
father likes it. I think I'll go for a walk now."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't do that, Miss Lucy; every time you get a bit of
strength you mustn't use it up. You sit out on the terrace again
and I'll get you presently a dish of tea."</p>

<p>"Why, I've only just had luncheon."</p>

<p>Lucy went out on to the terrace. The sun was very strong and
she was glad of the parasol, even in the shadow of the house
there seemed a dazzle of light. The perfume of fruit and flowers
was stronger and she could smell the box and laurel, the rosemary
and myrtle growing in the flagged garden. Her heart was quite
free&mdash;empty as the house and the day; she mused
impartially.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet, finding solicitous occasion to pass through the
drawing-room and look at her young mistress, thought resentfully:
"It's a pity there's no one&mdash;not anyone good enough."</p>

<p>Lucy came in from the terrace and asked for the white kittens.
Mrs. Bartlet brought them and she played with them on the
cushions of the long sophy between the windows.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mrs. Bartlet, I do think I ought to go for a
walk; I am quite well now and I feel it was so silly of me not to
have gone to the picnic."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet did not answer; her quick trained ear had heard a
footstep outside and she said, with the utmost surprise:</p>

<p>"Why, there's someone here!" and stepped out of the tall
French window, expecting she knew not whom, but prepared, with
stern dignity, to send away any possible intruder.</p>

<p>A young man had crossed the terrace and stood directly
fronting Mrs. Bartlet. He was, in the housekeeper's eyes, a very
manly and splendid figure; he wore a uniform, tagged and braided;
he was dark, handsome and agreeable. He said, smiling
pleasantly:</p>

<p>"Why, I thought everyone was out; I've been round to the front
entrance but could make no one hear. Could I see Mr. Middleton or
Mrs. Middleton?"</p>

<p>"The family is out sir," replied Mrs. Bartlet, "and most of
the servants. This is Miss Emily's birthday and everyone has gone
on a picnic."</p>

<p>"How odd that I should have chosen to-day," said the young
man, with an even more charming smile. "I have come with a
message from my uncle, Lord Weybourne; it's about Okestead Woods.
Two letters have been unaccountably overlooked and Lord Weybourne
was very anxious that Mr. Middleton should have an answer to-day.
I am staying there and offered to come over in person."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet knew perfectly well that she should have taken
this message and courteously dismissed the young man, repeating
her assurance, "The family is out, sir, there is no one at home,"
but Mrs. Bartlet hesitated. She knew who he was&mdash;Captain the
Honourable Simon Greeve, Lord Weybourne's heir&mdash;the man who
would be master of that great name and that great estate, a
soldier on the famous Duke's staff, a hero, too, no doubt, and
handsome as the prince in the fairy tale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet's thin face flushed. How odd that Miss Lucy
should have stayed behind just to-day! Why, he made all those
other gentlemen, Mr. Gray, Mr. Matchet and Mr. Lemoine, look like
so many broomsticks.</p>

<p>Captain Greeve, seeing the housekeeper's hesitation, said:</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you would give that message to Mr. Middleton,
and say that he will hear from my uncle tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet moved aside from the window; she replied:
"There's Miss Lucy at home, sir, if you would like to speak with
her; she understands all about the Okestead Woods. You see, they
used to play there as children, and it's become like home to
them." And she added, with an unconscious note of invitation in
her voice, "Wouldn't you care to see Miss Lucy, sir?"</p>

<p>"Of course," smiled Captain Greeve, "I should be absolutely
delighted to speak to Miss Lucy. Will you ask her if she would
care to receive me?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet went inside the drawing-room where Lucy was
playing with the two white kittens on the long sophy.</p>

<p>"Here's a visitor for you, Miss Lucy."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Bartlet, I couldn't see anybody to-day. I heard you
talking&mdash;it's a man, isn't it? Please send him
away&mdash;with compliments, you know, and say that my father
will see him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Lucy, it's Captain Greeve from the Hall and he's
come about the Woods."</p>

<p>"Let him leave a message with you," whispered Lucy; "do not
let us talk here so long, it seems discourteous."</p>

<p>"It is discourteous," said Mrs. Bartlet, firmly; "that's just
what it is, miss. It's a hot afternoon and he's walked over from
the Hall, and you can do no less than ask him in and give him a
dish of tea."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Lucy, doubtfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet had always been a firm model of all the decorum,
the proprieties and the conventionalities, and her advice
surprised and impressed her charge.</p>

<p>"You'll like him, Miss Lucy," whispered the housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Well," smiled Lucy, "I'm bound to see him now after this long
delay, for it would seem as if you had described him and then I
had refused; so ask him to come in, please."</p>

<p>She stood up, putting the kittens down on the sophy, and came
forward as Captain Greeve entered through the tall French
windows. Mrs. Bartlet repeated:</p>

<p>"A visitor for you, Miss Lucy, Captain Greeve!"</p>

<p>The girl dropped a little curtsey, the young soldier bowed.
She had never seen a man like this and was too innocent to
disguise her wonder, and he had often heard of absolute
loveliness but never before beheld it...they looked, therefore,
at each other for a second without speaking; both given a certain
ease by the sense of the empty house and the empty garden and
park about them and the languorous sweetness of the full summer
afternoon.</p>

<p>"I'll bring a dish of tea, miss," said Mrs. Bartlet, with a
tone of triumph in her voice.</p>

<p>"Please, will you be seated," said Lucy, "and tell
me&mdash;you have come about Okestead Woods?"</p>

<p>He said yes, and how strange it was that he should have chosen
the day when all the family were abroad at that very place.</p>

<p>"Indeed," smiled Lucy, "and it is strange that I was not
there, too; but I was ill last spring with a cough and to-day
felt languid, but now I am completely recovered."</p>

<p>"You would like me to go?" he said. "I intrude upon your
kindness; it is but a matter of leaving a message."</p>

<p>"Please stay," said Lucy, "and please be seated."</p>

<p>He took carefully the satin chair by the hearth and she sat
again on the sophy, and she thought how the whole room, nay the
whole house, the whole manor, seemed but a background for his
personality.</p>

<p>"Lord Weybourne, Miss Lucy, is very willing to sell the Woods;
he is sorry that there has been a delay in answering the
letters."</p>

<p>Lucy flushed:</p>

<p>"Oh, father will be delighted. We have always wanted them, you
know."</p>

<p>"Why?" smiled Captain Greeve, "are they different from any
other woods?"</p>

<p>"Well, they are to us; we have always gone there for picnics,
there is such a splendid view, and little groves, and certain
trees that we know so well and even call by names. You," she
added shyly, "you are not often here, you would not know the
places, I think."</p>

<p>"No, I have not often been here; once or twice as a child, but
I do not think we met."</p>

<p>"No, we have never met before."</p>

<p>"Miss Lucy, isn't that odd?" asked the young soldier.</p>

<p>And as her gentleness, her loveliness, her simplicity further
enchanted him, he could not keep some tenderness from his
voice.</p>

<p>"Is it not odd that we do meet at last, like this? I thought,
even as I left the Hall, there was some magic in the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Is there," asked Lucy, "some magic abroad? It has been very
still here. I have been alone all day, but not lonely."</p>

<p>She added in her heart, "It was this that I was waiting for
and, therefore, was quiet and content." Aloud she said, "I
watched the roses, just a few petals fell, it was so warm."</p>

<p>"The very height and crown of summer," said Captain
Greeve.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet carried in the tea and Naples cakes; Lucy noticed
that she had brought in the Crown Derby service and the best
silver as if this were a festival, and that her face was set in
lines of rare satisfaction and pleasure.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy had never been alone with a young man before, but
she was not shy nor frightened, for this seemed some familiar
friend. Her face flushed to a more delicate rose blush and her
blue eyes sparkled with an even more radiant brightness.</p>

<p>With ease, with grace, with a half-compassionate,
half-admiring tenderness the young soldier allowed her to
entertain him. They talked together of little things&mdash;of
music, of flowers, of the long, sweet, fair summer that had
followed the desolate winter and spring, of Okestead Woods, of
the picnics, the games and plays that had been held there by
happy children, and of all other trivial, charming matters which,
on their lips, were neither tedious nor insipid. Soon, all that
they said had a delicious interest for each other. When she
spoke, he listened as if all her words were as new as charming;
when he spoke, she was silent to hear, as if her ears were
ravished by new and unheard-of delights.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Bartlet came to remove the tea equipage Captain
Greeve told Lucy that he was home for a long leave and that he
must plan a dozen excursions for her to recompense her for the
picnic missed to-day. Did she know this and that? Would she go
here and there?</p>

<p>"But, 'tis I who must guide you," laughed Lucy; "we have some
charming places in the Manor grounds."</p>

<p>"How easily they talk together," thought Mrs. Bartlet, with a
swelling heart; "they look like accepted lovers already. Why,
this has been a sheer stroke of Providence, that she should
remain behind and he see her by herself like this, not surrounded
by those chattering misses, Kate Sorrel and Mary Fenwicke, or
even by her two sisters, Emily and Caroline&mdash;but, all by
herself, in her beauty, her dignity and her grace&mdash;the
sweetheart!" Here, at length, was a lover worthy of her, who had
walked in out of the still summer afternoon just like the prince
in the fairy tale who came to wake the Sleeping Beauty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet had given the gorgeous young man many shrewd
looks. She knew, and there was a pang in that, that he was Miss
Lucy's superior in birth, wealth and fortune, but she had never
heard any evil of him and she trusted him; he had honest eyes, a
serious manner; she could swear he was not one '"of your young
'flyaways,' who make a play of catching maidens' hearts like
butterflies in a net. No, there was respect in the way he looked
at Miss Lucy and, more than that, a breath-catching surprise." He
seemed to Mrs. Bartlet's triumphant, piercing gaze, like a man
amazed at the extent of his own good fortune, and Miss
Lucy&mdash;Miss Lucy was transformed; Mrs. Bartlet herself had
not guessed how gay, how charming, how lovely she could be...she
had bloomed like a flower, long-closed, suddenly struck by the
sun and opening wide to the golden heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Bartlet, I am going out! I am going to show Captain
Greeve the beech grove and the wishing-well and the little stream
with the forget-me-nots, though it's rather late to see the
flowers!"</p>

<p>"Well, miss, don't tire yourself," smiled the housekeeper.
"You know you were supposed to rest to-day."</p>

<p>"But, indeed I am quite recovered now."</p>

<p>"You must not let me take her," said the young man, "if she
should remain indoors."</p>

<p>And he looked humbly at the housekeeper as at the lawful
possessor of this new-found treasure. But Mrs. Bartlet was not
going to interfere with Providence, nor do anything to mar this
sudden and perfect idyll.</p>

<p>She hurried upstairs and fetched her mistress's straw bonnet
with the white sarcenet ribbons, the azure shawl which matched
the blue ribbons round Miss Lucy's waist, a little reticule with
handkerchief and vinaigrette within, and the long white silk
gloves and brought them down, that Miss Lucy might not lose a
single moment of Captain Greeve's company by going up to fetch
the things herself. The usual cautions were on her lips but not
in her heart as she bade them "Godspeed!" as if they were going
on a long magic journey.</p>

<p>"You won't go far, and you won't tire yourself, Miss Lucy.
You'll be back before it's dark, and I can trust you, Captain
Greeve, sir, for indeed she's not very strong yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I could walk miles!" laughed Lucy, "and I am
absolutely weary at being penned up in the house. If I had a
carriage I would go off to Okestead Woods and join them all and
tell them the good news!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet watched the two figures crossing the terrace. How
well matched in youth and grace and joyous pleasure in the summer
day! Slowly, side by side, they walked, he accommodating his step
to hers, she laughing. Mrs. Bartlet could not remember when she
had heard Miss Lucy laugh like that. Twice she turned back to
wave, her sweet face shadowed beneath the deep bonnet, her sweet
figure shadowed by the parasol.</p>

<p>When they came to the steps Mrs. Bartlet saw that he tenderly
took her elbow to guide her little feet.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, if ever there was a match made in Heaven that was;
maybe he could marry a fine lady with a pot of money for dowry;
but he's seen the world and knows a sweet face when he sees it,
and he's not likely to find a sweeter than Miss Lucy's; and she,
God bless her! has found somebody worthy of her at last."</p>

<p>They crossed the garden and paused to mark the time upon the
sundial, he lifting his fob to set his watch by it, and then they
went on across the flags, and she was conscious of a most
delicious warmth&mdash;the sunshine penetrating her thin dress on
to her limbs. She must show him the kitchen garden, the peaches
and the plums behind the netting, or preserved in linen bags, and
the slow, lazy buzzing bees and wasps; the withering currant
bushes gave out a pungent sweetness, the large black fruit hung
under the curling yellow leaves; and then, like a child enjoying
unobserved mischief, she must peep into the greenhouse and show
him the exotic plants growing there and the frames for winter
violets. Then into the park and to the beech grove, a spot she
had always loved where the shade was thick and golden.</p>

<p>It was like a temple&mdash;the floor paved with last year's
beech-mast, the roof the interlaced leaves of the trees through
which the sun poured, rendering them transparent yellow-gold like
cloudy amber.</p>

<p>The young man could hardly believe that she was mortal. She
had caught his heart and his fancy; the suddenness of their
meeting, the loneliness of their meeting-place, the off-chance
that had brought them thus together&mdash;all this combined to
give her a glamour of which he was almost afraid; he believed
that if he put out his hand to touch her she would vanish. He
tried to use his reason and analyse her coldly, but this he could
not do, there was certainly something about her which eluded him;
she was, he could have sworn, different from any other girl or
woman he had ever met; her pure gaiety, her extraordinary high
spirits, something crystal clear and radiant in her person and
her manner, her light joyousness, and yet the utter absence of
even a trace of coquetry. So could he have imagined a goddess or
a fairy treading the earth for a few hours.</p>

<p>They passed through the beech grove into a deeper wood where
the sun could scarcely penetrate and came to the wishing-well in
a deep grove with ivy, maidenhair and harts' tongue.</p>

<p>"In the summer, earlier, there are violets," she said; "this
is called Diana's Wishing-well, or, sometimes, the Nuns'
Wishing-well. Diana was, in a manner, a nun, you know."</p>

<p>She found the cup chained to the rock amid the tangled
ferns.</p>

<p>"See, you must drink, holding it in both hands, and wish."</p>

<p>She dipped it into the water and held it, brimming full, up to
him, their hands met beneath the bowl and the pure drops fell
upon their fingers.</p>

<p>"I wish that I may never be less happy than I am to-day, Miss
Lucy, but that is perhaps asking too much of the most indulgent
of gods."</p>

<p>"Now you have spoilt your wish, for you must tell none what it
is."</p>

<p>"May I not have another, Miss Lucy?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "there is only one wish for each, and, if
you speak it, it is lost."</p>

<p>"You have yours, Miss Lucy; your luck has not been
broken."</p>

<p>"Why, I had mine long ago, sir, when we were all children. We
came here on our several birthdays and had our wishes."</p>

<p>"And what was yours&mdash;but I suppose you must not tell it
me, even after so long?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I may tell it now&mdash;after a year or so one may
speak; but it was nothing, or something foolish&mdash;I think it
was that I might not live to grow old."</p>

<p>They went on into the wood&mdash;O lovely day! O serene
afternoon!</p>

<p>They did not know where they went or of what they spoke,
neither cared to measure the extent of their enchantment. On
several occasions he did force himself to remember the
housekeeper's injunction.</p>

<p>"You are sure you are not fatigued, Miss Lucy, I do not
overwalk you?"</p>

<p>But she seemed at the zenith of good health and spirits.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I was never less tired than now."</p>

<p>All her childhood's haunts, all the glades she had peopled
with youth's brightest fairies, they visited together. In a
Grecian temple on a little height they paused and looked over the
rolling countryside below the park, saw the wheat-sheaves piled
together in the lowlands and the church beyond, its delicate
spire rising above the elms and oaks, and over all the blue
cloudless sky; the shadows were long when they turned homewards,
the full, generous day was nearly ended when he left her on the
terrace. He lingered so long in his farewell and spoke so often
and so passionately of their next meeting:</p>

<p>"To-morrow, Miss Lucy, soon?"&mdash;hat it might be as if he
feared never to see her again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartlet was waiting for her, not anxiously or with any
regret, Miss Lucy was safe with him&mdash;the honoured damsel
with the chosen knight.</p>

<p>At length he was gone, but not the brightness he had brought
with him.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Lucy, there's adventure! Never have you had such a
thing happen to you before, have you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Bartlet, I took him to all the places&mdash;you
know, the Wishing-well&mdash;though he spoilt the wish by telling
it me&mdash;the beech grove and the little temple where you can
see the lowlands and the church, and all the other happy places;
oh, Mrs. Bartlet, I think he loves me!"</p>

<p>The old nurse drew the girl to her bosom.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure he does, my dear."</p>

<p>"And he's coming again to-morrow, Mrs. Bartlet, and the day
after that. And do you think anyone will be displeased? And,
hush! you must not say I told you&mdash;I don't know how it came
that I spoke the words, for he never said anything of it to
me."</p>

<p>"But looks are enough, my dear; the being together and his
finding you like that. And who would have thought, Miss Lucy, you
being alone here would have had a visitor like that?"</p>

<p>"Love," thought Lucy. "Love itself&mdash;that's who my visitor
was!"</p>

<p>"You're not shivering, Miss Lucy, you're not overtired? I've
got some supper for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Bartlet, I couldn't eat anything, but I will wait up
till the others come home to tell them." And she laughed. "I must
tell them about Okestead Woods, must I not? And, you know I had
forgotten about them until this moment&mdash;and yet that was the
cause of his coming&mdash;O blessed, happy woods will they always
be to me!"</p>

<p>The picnic party were late; the moon was high and glorious,
but Lucy Middleton would not go to bed, she sat in the lamplit
drawing-room, looking out on to the moonlit terrace. What had he
said&mdash;how had he said it&mdash;how had he moved and glanced?
She could neither eat nor drink and Mrs. Bartlet, listening to
more confidences, found her clinging hand hot.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Lucy, you've never taken a chill! Did you go into
the beech wood? It's always cool, on a sunny day."</p>

<p>"We went into the beech wood, Mrs. Bartlet, but I never took a
chill. I am well, I never felt better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet, my dear, you must not sit up for them any longer;
they're late&mdash;who knows how later they may not be? The young
people enjoying themselves and the master and mistress not
wishing to interfere with their pleasures, and all thinking you
abed and asleep hours ago, Miss Lucy dear."</p>

<p>"They don't know what's happened to me," said Lucy, "they
never can guess what's happened to me."</p>

<p>She turned suddenly, and peered past the circle of
lamplight.</p>

<p>"Why, surely that's someone outside! Do you think he's come
back, Mrs. Bartlet, do you think he's forgotten something?"</p>

<p>The nurse turned; she, too, thought she had heard a footstep,
like an echo of that manly step of the afternoon on the terrace
without. She thought she discerned in the moonlight the shape of
a figure.</p>

<p>"Why, there wouldn't be another visitor for you to-day, Miss
Lucy, at this time of night."</p>

<p>No, it was all fancy, they had not seen or heard anything.</p>

<p>"People sitting alone, and being excited, as you might say,
Miss Lucy, waiting for others to come home, between the moonlight
and the lamplight on a summer evening like this, often think they
see and hear things."</p>

<p>"And maybe they do, just happy fancies come, as it were, to
life."</p>

<p>Her high spirits dropped from her, she seemed suddenly
fatigued.</p>

<p>"I certainly thought there was someone there," she added,
vaguely. "Queer that you should have said 'another visitor for
you, Miss Lucy'&mdash;have I had two visitors to-day or one?"</p>

<p>"One, and one only, and that's enough, my dear. But you
<i>are</i> tired and you are coming upstairs now with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am tired, I don't think I'll wait up any longer. I
suppose I walked farther than I knew. My head's beginning to
throb again, and I have got that pain in my side. Yet, I don't
want to go to sleep." She struggled to shake off languor. "Shall
I play the harp a little, Mrs. Bartlet, or sing 'Angels ever
bright and fair'?"</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing, Miss Lucy, but come up to bed. If you've
over-fatigued yourself, Miss Lucy, I shall never, never forgive
myself for letting you go."</p>

<p>The girl went upstairs slowly, the kind old nurse behind her,
and into her little bedroom, the white, precise room, with the
oval pictures and the dimity bed, which the moonlight filled with
silver.</p>

<p>She stood musing, swinging her bonnet by its strings.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is a lovely night, Mrs. Bartlet, don't let's have
the candles yet!" Then, "Oh, I am so happy. He's coming
to-morrow, you know!"</p>

<p>She sat down by the bed.</p>

<p>"I shall be asleep when they come back, but don't tell them
about Okestead Woods&mdash;I want to do that myself."</p>

<p>"No, Miss Lucy, I won't tell them. That's a piece of news for
you to give them, and you've got something else, too, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>The girl continued to swing her bonnet to and fro.</p>

<p>"I am so happy," she repeated. Then, suddenly: "Oh, I am
going&mdash;there <i>were</i> two visitors, I thought someone
came for me!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Miss Lucy?" cried the nurse, in swift and
deadly panic.</p>

<p>But Lucy had fallen lightly across the bed, her beautiful hair
encircling the pale face; she murmured again&mdash;"I'm
going...someone has come to take me...I can't stay."</p>

<p>As Mrs. Bartlet lifted her she had ceased to sigh or
smile.</p>

<p>Along the moonlit drive came the gay sounds of the picnic
party returning.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a> THE CROWN DERBY PLATE</h2>

<h3>"HOUSE TO LET"&mdash;1900</h3>

<p class="first">
MARTHA PYM said that she had never seen a ghost and that she
would very much like to do so, "particularly at Christmas, for
you can laugh as you like, that is the correct time to see a
ghost."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you ever will," replied her cousin Mabel
comfortably, while her cousin Clara shuddered and said that she
hoped they would change the subject for she disliked even to
think of such things.</p>

<p>The three elderly, cheerful women sat round a big fire, cosy
and content after a day of pleasant activities; Martha was the
guest of the other two, who owned the handsome, convenient
country house; she always came to spend her Christmas with the
Wyntons and found the leisurely country life delightful after the
bustling round of London, for Martha managed an antique shop of
the better sort and worked extremely hard. She was, however,
still full of zest for work or pleasure, though sixty years old,
and looked backwards and forwards to a succession of delightful
days.</p>

<p>The other two, Mabel and Clara, led quieter but none the less
agreeable lives; they had more money and fewer interests, but
nevertheless enjoyed themselves very well.</p>

<p>"Talking of ghosts," said Mabel, "I wonder how that old woman
at 'Hartleys' is getting on, for 'Hartleys,' you know, is
supposed to be haunted."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," smiled Miss Pym, "but all the years that we
have known of the place we have never heard anything definite,
have we?"</p>

<p>"No," put in Clara; "but there <i>is</i> that persistent
rumour that the House is uncanny, and for myself, <i>nothing</i>
would induce me to live there!"</p>

<p>"It is certainly very lonely and dreary down there on the
marshes," conceded Mabel. "But as for the ghost&mdash;you never
hear <i>what</i> it is supposed to be even."</p>

<p>"Who has taken it?" asked Miss Pym, remembering "Hartleys" as
very desolate indeed, and long shut up.</p>

<p>"A Miss Lefain, an eccentric old creature&mdash;I think you
met her here once, two years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe that I did, but I don't recall her at all."</p>

<p>"We have not seen her since, 'Hartleys' is so un-get-at-able
and she didn't seem to want visitors. She collects china, Martha,
so really you ought to go and see her and talk 'shop.'"</p>

<p>With the word "china" some curious associations came into the
mind of Martha Pym; she was silent while she strove to put them
together, and after a second or two they all fitted together into
a very clear picture.</p>

<p>She remembered that thirty years ago&mdash;yes, it must be
thirty years ago, when, as a young woman, she had put all her
capital into the antique business, and had been staying with her
cousins (her aunt had then been alive) that she had driven across
the marsh to "Hartleys," where there was an auction sale; all the
details of this she had completely forgotten, but she could
recall quite clearly purchasing a set of gorgeous china which was
still one of her proud delights, a perfect set of Crown Derby
save that one plate was missing.</p>

<p>"How odd," she remarked, "that this Miss Lefain should collect
china too, for it was at 'Hartleys' that I purchased my dear old
Derby service&mdash;I've never been able to match that
plate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A plate was missing? I seem to remember," said Clara. "Didn't
they say that it must be in the house somewhere and that it
should be looked for?"</p>

<p>"I believe they did, but of course I never heard any more and
that missing plate has annoyed me ever since. Who had
'Hartleys'?"</p>

<p>"An old connoisseur, Sir James Sewell; I believe he was some
relation to this Miss Lefain, but I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wonder if she has found the plate," mused Miss Pym. "I
expect she has turned out and ransacked the whole
place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not trot over and ask?" suggested Mabel. "It's not much
use to her, if she has found it, one odd plate."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Clara. "Fancy going over the marshes,
this weather, to ask about a plate missed all those years ago.
I'm sure Martha wouldn't think of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Martha did think of it; she was rather fascinated by the
idea; how queer and pleasant it would be if, after all these
years, nearly a lifetime, she should find the Crown Derby plate,
the loss of which had always irked her! And this hope did not
seem so altogether fantastical, it was quite likely that old Miss
Lefain, poking about in the ancient house, had found the missing
piece.</p>

<p>And, of course, if she had, being a fellow-collector, she
would be quite willing to part with it to complete the set.</p>

<p>Her cousin endeavoured to dissuade her; Miss Lefain, she
declared, was a recluse, an odd creature who might greatly resent
such a visit and such a request.</p>

<p>"Well, if she does I can but come away again," smiled Miss
Pym. "I suppose she can't bite my head off, and I rather like
meeting these curious types&mdash;we've got a love for old china
in common, anyhow."</p>

<p>"It seems so silly to think of it&mdash;after all these
years&mdash;a plate!"</p>

<p>"A Crown Derby plate," corrected Miss Pym. "It is certainly
strange that I didn't think of it before, but now that I have got
it into my head I can't get it out. Besides," she added
hopefully, "I might see the ghost."</p>

<p>So full, however, were the days with pleasant local
engagements that Miss Pym had no immediate chance of putting her
scheme into practice; but she did not relinquish it, and she
asked several different people what they knew about "Hartleys"
and Miss Lefain.</p>

<p>And no one knew anything save that the house was supposed to
be haunted and the owner "cracky."</p>

<p>"Is there a story?" asked Miss Pym, who associated ghosts with
neat tales into which they fitted as exactly as nuts into
shells.</p>

<p>But she was always told: "Oh, no, there isn't a story, no one
knows anything about the place, don't know how the idea got
about; old Sewcll was half-crazy, I believe, he was buried in the
garden and that gives a house a nasty name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very unpleasant," said Martha Pym, undisturbed.</p>

<p>This ghost seemed too elusive for her to track down; she would
have to be content if she could recover the Crown Derby plate;
for that at least she was determined to make a try and also to
satisfy that faint tingling of curiosity roused in her by this
talk about "Hartleys" and the remembrance of that day, so long
ago, when she had gone to the auction sale at the lonely old
house.</p>

<p>So the first free afternoon, while Mabel and Clara were
comfortably taking their afternoon repose, Martha Pym, who was of
a more lively habit, got out her little governess cart and dashed
away across the Essex flats.</p>

<p>She had taken minute directions with her, but she had soon
lost her way.</p>

<p>Under the wintry sky, which looked as grey and hard as metal,
the marshes stretched bleakly to the horizon, the olive-brown
broken reeds were harsh as scars on the saffron-tinted bogs,
where the sluggish waters that rose so high in winter were filmed
over with the first stillness of a frost; the air was cold but
not keen, everything was damp; faintest of mists blurred the
black outlines of trees that rose stark from the ridges above the
stagnant dykes; the flooded fields were haunted by black birds
and white birds, gulls and crows, whining above the long ditch
grass and wintry wastes.</p>

<p>Miss Pym stopped the little horse and surveyed this spectral
scene, which had a certain relish about it to one sure to return
to a homely village, a cheerful house and good company.</p>

<p>A withered and bleached old man, in colour like the dun
landscape, came along the road between the sparse alders.</p>

<p>Miss Pym, buttoning up her coat, asked the way to "Hartley" as
he passed her; he told her, straight on, and she proceeded,
straight indeed across the road that went with undeviating length
across the marshes.</p>

<p>"Of course," thought Miss Pym, "if you live in a place like
this, you are bound to invent ghosts."</p>

<p>The house sprang up suddenly on a knoll ringed with rotting
trees, encompassed by an old brick wall that the perpetual damp
had overrun with lichen, blue, green, white colours of decay.</p>

<p>"Hartleys," no doubt, there was no other residence of human
being in sight in all the wide expanse; besides, she could
remember it, surely, after all this time, the sharp rising out of
the marsh, the colony of tall trees, but then fields and trees
had been green and bright&mdash;there had been no water on the
flats, it had been summer-time.</p>

<p>"She certainly," thought Miss Pym, "must be crazy to live
here. And I rather doubt if I shall get my plate."</p>

<p>She fastened up the good little horse by the garden gate which
stood negligently ajar and entered; the garden itself was so
neglected that it was quite surprising to see a trim appearance
in the house, curtains at the window and a polish on the brass
door knocker, which must have been recently rubbed there,
considering the taint in the sea damp which rusted and rotted
everything.</p>

<p>It was a square-built, substantial house with "nothing wrong
with it but the situation," Miss Pym decided, though it was not
very attractive, being built of that drab plastered stone so
popular a hundred years ago, with flat windows and door, while
one side was gloomily shaded by a large evergreen tree of the
cypress variety which gave a blackish tinge to that portion of
the garden.</p>

<p>There was no pretence at flower-beds nor any manner of
cultivation in this garden where a few rank weeds and straggling
bushes matted together above the dead grass; on the enclosing
wall which appeared to have been built high as protection against
the ceaseless winds that swung along the flats were the remains
of fruit trees; their crucified branches, rotting under the great
nails that held them up, looked like the skeletons of those who
had died in torment.</p>

<p>Miss Pym took in these noxious details as she knocked firmly
at the door; they did not depress her; she merely felt extremely
sorry for anyone who could live in such a place.</p>

<p>She noticed, at the far end of the garden, in the corner of
the wall, a headstone showing above the sodden colourless grass,
and remembered what she had been told about the old antiquary
being buried there, in the grounds of "Hartleys."</p>

<p>As the knock had no effect she stepped back and looked at the
house; it was certainly inhabited&mdash;with those neat windows,
white curtains and drab blinds all pulled to precisely the same
level.</p>

<p>And when she brought her glance back to the door she saw that
it had been opened and that someone, considerably obscured by the
darkness of the passage, was looking at her intently.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," said Miss Pym cheerfully. "I just thought
that I would call to see Miss Lefain&mdash;it is Miss Lefain,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's my house," was the querulous reply.</p>

<p>Martha Pym had hardly expected to find any servants here,
though the old lady must, she thought, work pretty hard to keep
the house so clean and tidy as it appeared to be.</p>

<p>"Of course," she replied. "May I come in? I'm Martha Pym,
staying with the Wyntons, I met you there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do come in," was the faint reply. "I get so few people to
visit me, I'm really very lonely."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," thought Miss Pym; but she had resolved to
take no notice of any eccentricity on the part of her hostess,
and so she entered the house with her usual agreeable candour and
courtesy.</p>

<p>The passage was badly lit, but she was able to get a fair idea
of Miss Lefain; her first impression was that this poor creature
was most dreadfully old, older than any human being had the right
to be, why, she felt young in comparison&mdash;so faded, feeble,
and pallid was Miss Lefain.</p>

<p>She was also monstrously fat; her gross, flaccid figure was
shapeless and she wore a badly cut, full dress of no colour at
all, but stained with earth and damp where Miss Pym supposed she
had been doing futile gardening; this gown was doubtless designed
to disguise her stoutness, but had been so carelessly pulled
about that it only added to it, being rucked and rolled "all over
the place" as Miss Pym put it to herself.</p>

<p>Another ridiculous touch about the appearance of the poor old
lady was her short hair; decrepit as she was, and lonely as she
lived she had actually had her scanty relics of white hair
cropped round her shaking head.</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me," she said in her thin treble voice. "How
very kind of you to come. I suppose you prefer the parlour? I
generally sit in the garden."</p>

<p>"The garden? But not in this weather?"</p>

<p>"I get used to the weather. You've no idea how used one gets
to the weather."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," conceded Miss Pym doubtfully. "You don't live
here quite alone, do you?"</p>

<p>"Quite alone, lately. I had a little company, but she was
taken away, I'm sure I don't know where. I haven't been able to
find a trace of her anywhere," replied the old lady
peevishly.</p>

<p>"Some wretched companion that couldn't stick it, I suppose,"
thought Miss Pym. "Well, I don't wonder&mdash;but someone ought
to be here to look after her."</p>

<p>They went into the parlour, which, the visitor was dismayed to
see, was without a fire but otherwise well kept.</p>

<p>And there, on dozens of shelves was a choice array of china at
which Martha Pym's eyes glistened.</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried Miss Lefain. "I see you've noticed my treasures!
Don't you envy me? Don't you wish that you had some of those
pieces?"</p>

<p>Martha Pym certainly did and she looked eagerly and greedily
round the walls, tables, and cabinets while the old woman
followed her with little thin squeals of pleasure.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful little collection, most choicely and
elegantly arranged, and Martha thought it marvellous that this
feeble ancient creature should be able to keep it in such precise
order as well as doing her own housework.</p>

<p>"Do you really do everything yourself here and live quite
alone?" she asked, and she shivered even in her thick coat and
wished that Miss Lefain's energy had risen to a fire, but then
probably she lived in the kitchen, as these lonely eccentrics
often did.</p>

<p>"There was someone," answered Miss Lefain cunningly, "but I
had to send her away. I told you she's gone, I can't find her,
and I am so glad. Of course," she added wistfully, "it leaves me
very lonely, but then I couldn't stand her impertinence any
longer. She used to say that it was <i>her</i> house and her
collection of china! Would you believe it? She used to try to
chase me away from looking at my own things!"</p>

<p>"How very disagreeable," said Miss Pym, wondering which of the
two women had been crazy. "But hadn't you better get someone
else."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," was the jealous answer. "I would rather be alone
with my things, I daren't leave the house for fear someone takes
them away&mdash;there was a dreadful time once when an auction
sale was held here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were you here then?" asked Miss Pym; but indeed she looked
old enough to have been anywhere.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Miss Lefain replied rather peevishly and
Miss Pym decided that she must be a relation of old Sir James
Sewell. Clara and Mabel had been very foggy about it all. "I was
very busy hiding all the china&mdash;but one set they got&mdash;a
Crown Derby tea service&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With one plate missing!" cried Martha Pym. "I bought it, and
do you know, I was wondering if you'd found it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hid it," piped Miss Lefain.</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you? Well, that's rather funny behaviour.
Why did you hide the stuff away instead of buying it?"</p>

<p>"How could I buy what was mine?"</p>

<p>"Old Sir James left it to you, then?" asked Martha Pym,
feeling very muddled.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> bought a lot more," squeaked Miss Lefain, but
Martha Pym tried to keep her to the point.</p>

<p>"If you've got the plate," she insisted, "you might let me
have it&mdash;I'll pay quite handsomely, it would be so pleasant
to have it after all these years."</p>

<p>"Money is no use to me," said Miss Lefain mournfully. "Not a
bit of use. I can't leave the house or the garden."</p>

<p>"Well, you have to live, I suppose," replied Martha Pym
cheerfully. "And, do you know, I'm afraid you are getting rather
morbid and dull, living here all alone&mdash;you really ought to
have a fire&mdash;why, it's just on Christmas and very damp."</p>

<p>"I haven't felt the cold for a long time," replied the other;
she seated herself with a sigh on one of the horsehair chairs and
Miss Pym noticed with a start that her feet were covered only by
a pair of white stockings; "one of those nasty health fiends,"
thought Miss Pym, "but she doesn't look too well for all
that."</p>

<p>"So you don't think that you could let me have the plate?" she
asked briskly, walking up and down, for the dark, neat, clean
parlour was very cold indeed, and she thought that she couldn't
stand this much longer; as there seemed no sign of tea or
anything pleasant and comfortable she had really better go.</p>

<p>"I might let you have it," sighed Miss Lefain, "since you've
been so kind as to pay me a visit. After all, one plate isn't
much use, is it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, I wonder you troubled to hide
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I couldn't <i>bear</i>," wailed the other, "to see the things
going out of the house!"</p>

<p>Martha Pym couldn't stop to go into all this; it was quite
clear that the old lady was very eccentric indeed and that
nothing very much could be done with her; no wonder that she had
"dropped out" of everything and that no one ever saw her or knew
anything about her, though Miss Pym felt that some effort ought
really to be made to save her from herself.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like a run in my little governess cart?" she
suggested. "We might go to tea with the Wyntons on the way back,
they'd be delighted to see you, and I really think that you do
want taking out of yourself."</p>

<p>"I was taken out of myself some time ago," replied Miss
Lefain. "I really was, and I couldn't leave my
things&mdash;though," she added with pathetic gratitude, "it is
very, very kind of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your things would be quite safe, I'm sure," said Martha Pym,
humouring her. "Who ever would come up here, this hour of a
winter's day?"</p>

<p>"They do, oh, they do! And <i>she</i> might come back, prying
and nosing and saying that it was all hers, all my beautiful
china, hers!"</p>

<p>Miss Lefain squealed in her agitation and rising up, ran round
the wall fingering with flaccid yellow hands the brilliant glossy
pieces on the shelves.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'm afraid that I must go, they'll be expecting
me, and it's quite a long ride; perhaps some other time you'll
come and see us?</p>

<p>"Oh, must you go?" quavered Miss Lefain dolefully. "I do like
a little company now and then and I trusted you from the
first&mdash;the others, when they do come, are always after my
things and I have to frighten them away!"</p>

<p>"Frighten them away!" replied Martha Pym. "However do you do
that?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem difficult, people are so easily frightened,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>Miss Pym suddenly remembered that "Hartleys" had the
reputation of being haunted&mdash;perhaps the queer old thing
played on that; the lonely house with the grave in the garden was
dreary enough around which to create a legend.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've never seen a ghost?" she asked pleasantly.
"I'd rather like to see one, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no one here but myself," said Miss Lefain.</p>

<p>"So you've never seen anything? I thought it must be all
nonsense. Still, I do think it rather melancholy for you to live
here all alone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Lefain sighed:</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very lonely. Do stay and talk to me a little
longer." Her whistling voice dropped cunningly. "And I'll give
you the Crown Derby plate!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you've really got it?" Miss Pym asked.</p>

<p>"I'll show you."</p>

<p>Fat and waddling as she was, she seemed to move very lightly
as she slipped in front of Miss Pym and conducted her from the
room, going slowly up the stairs&mdash;such a gross odd figure in
that clumsy dress with the fringe of white hair hanging on to her
shoulders.</p>

<p>The upstairs of the house was as neat as the parlour,
everything well in its place; but there was no sign of occupancy;
the beds were covered with dust sheets, there were no lamps or
fires set ready. "I suppose," said Miss Pym to herself, "she
doesn't care to show me where she reeally lives."</p>

<p>But as they passed from one room to another, she could not
help saying:</p>

<p>"Where <i>do</i> you live, Miss Lefain?"</p>

<p>"Mostly in the garden," said the other.</p>

<p>Miss Pym thought of those horrible health huts that some
people indulged in.</p>

<p>"Well, sooner you than I," she replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>In the most distant room of all, a dark, tiny closet, Miss
Lefain opened a deep cupboard and brought out a Crown Derby plate
which her guest received with a spasm of joy, for it was actually
that missing from her cherished set.</p>

<p>"It's very good of you," she said in delight. "Won't you take
something for it, or let me do something for you?"</p>

<p>"You might come and see me again," replied Miss Lefain
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course I should like to come and see you
again."</p>

<p>But now that she had got what she had really come for, the
plate, Martha Pym wanted to be gone; it was really very dismal
and depressing in the house and she began to notice a fearful
smell&mdash;the place had been shut up too long, there was
something damp rotting somewhere, in this horrid little dark
closet no doubt.</p>

<p>"I really must be going," she said hurriedly.</p>

<p>Miss Lefain turned as if to cling to her, but Martha Pym moved
quickly away.</p>

<p>"Dear me," wailed the old lady. "Why are you in such
haste?"</p>

<p>"There's&mdash;a smell," murmured Miss Pym rather faintly.</p>

<p>She found herself hastening down the stairs, with Miss Lefain
complaining behind her.</p>

<p>"How peculiar people are&mdash;<i>she</i> used to talk of a
smell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you must notice it yourself."</p>

<p>Miss Pym was in the hall; the old woman had not followed her,
but stood in the semi-darkness at the head of the stairs, a pale
shapeless figure.</p>

<p>Martha Pym hated to be rude and ungrateful but she could not
stay another moment; she hurried away and was in her cart in a
moment&mdash;really&mdash;that smell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" she called out with false cheerfulness, "and thank
you <i>so</i> much!"</p>

<p>There was no answer from the house.</p>

<p>Miss Pym drove on; she was rather upset and took another way
than that by which she had come, a way that led past a little
house raised above the marsh; she was glad to think that the poor
old creature at "Hartleys" had such near neighbours, and she
reined up the horse, dubious as to whether she should call
someone and tell them that poor old Miss Lefain really wanted a
little looking after, alone in a house like that, and plainly not
quite right in her head.</p>

<p>A young woman, attracted by the sound of the governess cart,
came to the door of the house and seeing Miss Pym called out,
asking if she wanted the keys of the house?</p>

<p>"What house?" asked Miss Pym.</p>

<p>"'Hartleys,' mum, they don't put a board out, as no one is
likely to pass, but it's to be sold. Miss Lefain wants to sell or
let it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've just been up to see her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mum&mdash;she's been away a year, abroad somewhere,
couldn't stand the place, it's been empty since then, I just run
in every day and keep things tidy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Loquacious and curious the young woman had come to the fence;
Miss Pym had stopped her horse.</p>

<p>"Miss Lefain is there now," she said. "She must have just come
back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wasn't there this morning, mum, 'tisn't likely she'd
come, either&mdash;fair scared she was, mum, fair chased away,
didn't dare move her china. Can't say I've noticed anything
myself, but I never stay long&mdash;and there's a
smell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Martha Pym faintly, "there's a smell.
What&mdash;what&mdash;chased her away?"</p>

<p>The young woman, even in that lonely place, lowered her
voice.</p>

<p>"Well, as you aren't thinking of taking the place, she got an
idea in her head that old Sir James&mdash;well, he couldn't bear
to leave 'Hartleys,' mum, he's buried in the garden, and she
thought he was after her, chasing round them bits of
china&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Miss Pym.</p>

<p>"Some of it used to be his, she found a lot stuffed away, he
said they were to be left in 'Hartleys,' but Miss Lefain would
have the things sold, I believe&mdash;that's years
ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Miss Pym with a sick look. "You don't know
what he was like, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, mum&mdash;but I've heard tell he was very stout and very
old&mdash;I wonder who it was you saw up at 'Hartleys'?"</p>

<p>Miss Pym took a Crown Derby plate from her bag.</p>

<p>"You might take that back when you go," she whispered. "I
shan't want it, after all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before the astonished young woman could answer Miss Pym had
darted off across the marsh; that short hair, that earth-stained
robe, the white socks, "I generally live in the
garden&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Pym drove away, breakneck speed, frantically resolving to
mention to no one that she had paid a visit to "Hartleys," nor
lightly again to bring up the subject of ghosts.</p>

<p>She shook and shuddered in the damp, trying to get out of her
clothes and her nostrils&mdash;that indescribable smell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a> THE NEW HOUSEMAID</h2>

<h3>A LONDON MANSION&mdash;1870</h3>

<p class="first">
MRS. NANGLE, slowly and comfortably, descended from the
hackney cab in front of the large mansion facing the park. The
coachman climbed down from his box and between them they carried
down the basement steps the corded hair trunk belonging to Jenny,
who followed them cumbered with small boxes and parcels.</p>

<p>It was late September and late afternoon; there was a gentle
fall of dry dusty leaves from the plane trees in the small garden
at the back of the closed house. A mist crept up from the
park.</p>

<p>A glance, as she descended from the hackney coach, had shown
Mrs. Nangle that the houses to right and left of the mansion were
still uninhabited; the gentry had not yet returned to town. She
paid the coachman sufficient to secure his goodwill and told
Jenny to light the fire in the huge kitchen grate.</p>

<p>"A bit lonely, isn't it?" said the girl, and shivered in the
damp, spacious basement-room.</p>

<p>"You've got back early," commented the coachman, "as far as I
can see there's not a soul in the whole of the Lane."</p>

<p>"I've got to get the house ready," replied Mrs. Nangle; "me
and Mrs. Withers what comes to-morrow&mdash;she's the housekeeper
bringing a new housemaid&mdash;will soon have things cosy and
comfortable."</p>

<p>At this Mrs. Nangle, who was very cosy and comfortable
herself, drew out a penny which she gave to the coachman for the
blue-toed urchin she had seen holding his horse's head, and so
dismissed him, and taking off her bonnet and shawl looked round
with the air of an old campaigner delighted to be back on the
field of action.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle, a good woman and an excellent cook, had been in
service with the Hambletons for many years and knew intimately
every crevice of the handsome, solid mansion in the lane by the
park; but Jenny, her niece, was new to London and overawed,
between giggles and tears, as she stood with the end of her shawl
in her mouth and her bonnet strings untied, staring round the
vast kitchen.</p>

<p>"We needn't have come up till to-morrow, auntie, need we?" she
asked, "when the others would be here. It's fearsome lonely; I
never knew the house'd be so big."</p>

<p>From a huge cupboard Mrs. Nangle fetched out an apron which
she tied round her large waist.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing," she said good-humouredly, "the trains
don't run to please you and me, Jenny; if we hadn't come up
to-day we should have had to stay till Thursday&mdash;that'd have
been two good days' work lost, and the master and mistress coming
back on Monday. Now, you light the fire, that's a good girl;
there's been provisions ordered in and there's all that stuff
we've brought up with us in the baskets."</p>

<p>"Didn't you say there was a caretaker, auntie?" Jenny asked,
not moving.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's a caretaker all right, that's Mrs. Claypole, but
she'd have gone by now; you wouldn't catch her waiting. She's got
a long way to get home, right up Hampstead, and we're late."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's getting dark," said Jenny.</p>

<p>The cook, capable and serene, had soon found all she needed,
lit the fire, brought out the candles and laid a cloth on the
kitchen table.</p>

<p>"Why, it's all closets and cupboards!" cried Jenny, peeping
out into the passage.</p>

<p>"What did you expect in a mansion like this?" asked Mrs.
Nangle, not without pride. "You was all for a place in London, my
girl, and now you've got it, and if you don't like it I can soon
pack you home to your mother."</p>

<p>Jenny did not answer.</p>

<p>When her aunt had come to spend her holiday with them she had
thought that it would be a tremendously fine thing to go to
London as kitchenmaid in a great gentleman's house; now, on this
chill autumn evening in the empty basement of the large mansion,
she wished herself back in the comfortable Buckinghamshire
cottage&mdash;father coming home from work, children sitting up
to their tea, and mother busy with the kettle. Of course, the
firelight made a great deal of difference; in such a short time
had Nit's. Nangle got a good fire burning, and four candles lit
in brass candlesticks! Really, Jenny tried to persuade herself,
the kitchen was quite cheerful; but then there were all those
passages and closets outside which were quite dark.</p>

<p>"We won't bother about the lamp to-night, Jenny, the
candles'll be good enough for you and me."</p>

<p>"Where are we going to sleep?" asked Jenny, unpacking the
baskets that were full of the last anxious gifts of her
mother.</p>

<p>"When everyone is here," said Mrs. Nangle, taking down the
tea-canister, "we sleep right up in the attics; but, to-night as
we are alone and you seem a bit fearsome, we can sleep down here
in a room that two footmen use&mdash;there are two beds in it and
all clean and proper."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," agreed the girl, "that will be much better, auntie.
Then we wouldn't have to leave the fire."</p>

<p>"Why, I had no idea you were so timid, Jenny!" laughed Mrs.
Nangle. "Why don't you go and have a look round and get used to
the place while I get the tea?"</p>

<p>Secretly Jenny thought she would never get used to it; she had
no wish whatever to take a look round the empty house which, to
her country imagination, stretched above and beyond her in an
endless succession of large, dark, fathomless rooms. She did,
however, open the little side door that led from a kitchen into
the small stone area, ran up the area steps and peered through
the railings up and down the road in the secret hope of seeing
some passer-by or a neighbour. The irregular line of houses which
appeared to be all of different styles and sizes stretched into
the distance on either hand of the peering little maid; the vista
on either side ended in mist and mist was also encroaching over
the wide spaces of grass, through the tall withering trees and
the high narrow railing, darkening down the day to a dense
twilight. Jenny could see no one abroad at all, the town seemed
more lonely than the country; as far as she could discern the
houses were all shut up. With a curiosity touched with awe she
opened the area gate and stepped out on to the pavement. There
was a queer, charming little house next door with a semicircular
front and verandah balconies, very much narrower, though as high,
than the mansion in which she had come to reside. This, too, was
apparently empty, the white blinds drawn with a dead appearance
over the tall windows; but, no, even as Jenny looked a light
suddenly appeared in the top room which was almost on a level
with the top window of the neighbouring house, then was gone
instantly&mdash;a spurt of red which flared into the blue-grey of
the twilight, then was gone.</p>

<p>Jenny shivered back to the warm kitchen.</p>

<p>"There don't seem nobody about," she said; "all the houses
shut up."</p>

<p>"And what would you expect at this time of year?" said Mrs.
Nangle, cheerfully: "you and I are up in London early, my girl,
you don't find people living in this part of the town much before
October."</p>

<p>When the red rep curtains were drawn over the mist and the
half-wall half-railing of the area, the kitchen door shut on
those numerous closets and passages, life became tolerable, even
cheerful, to the country girl; she looked forward to the future
with a vague but tingling excitement. Mrs. Nangle, perfectly
familiar with the mansion and knowing no such thing as nerves or
whimsies, was for going upstairs to the attics and looking out
her own possessions for the night, but Jenny earnestly dissuaded
her.</p>

<p>"We've plenty in our bags, auntie, that'll do for to-night,
and there's no need for you to be going up looking after your
things. No need for me to undo my trunk either; it will be
difficult to get that cording undone, that father made so tight,
just by ourselves."</p>

<p>"But I don't want you to go, Jenny child, and I don't see why
you shouldn't let me."</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie, I don't want to be left alone; I don't like the
place well enough."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle laughed and good-naturedly gave in; going to the
linen cupboard she took out the coarse twill sheets and began
airing them in front of the fire, setting them across the kitchen
Windsor chairs. She put away the provisions and Jenny had to wash
up at the big sink which would be her principal place of
occupation in the future, if indeed she remained as Lady
Hambleton's kitchenmaid; but Jenny did not think that she would
do so. She was used to the country, a rough but an open and a
cheerful life; she did not mind hard work, but she hated the dark
and she had never seen a basement before. As she stood before the
large, cumbersome, grey stone sink, running the water over the
white plates, the yellow light of the candle falling on her, even
Mrs. Nangle, practical as she was, thought in her motherly heart
"The girl's too good for the work." For Jenny was very pretty
with the abundant prettiness of seventeen&mdash;bright auburn
hair, smooth English features, English blue-grey eyes.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Nangle was making up the beds in the servants' room,
Jenny called across to her:</p>

<p>"Auntie, who lives next door?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle pursed up her lips: "No one that you need concern
yourself about, my lady don't visit there."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a pretty little house, ain't it? And I just
wondered; so close, too, the windows touching&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a Mr. Monkswell," conceded Mrs. Nangle, "a gentleman
what lives mostly abroad."</p>

<p>"I like it better than this, it's smaller."</p>

<p>"Smaller," scoffed Mrs. Nangle, "it's hardly a house at all;
it's what the master calls a <i>cottage orné</i>, though it's so
tall, if you know what that means, Jenny; it's not a proper sort
of place, anyhow, so don't you go worrying your head about
it."</p>

<p>If conscientious Mrs. Nangle had had a woman of her own age
about her, or even a married woman, she would very much have
liked to have told the history of the little high house next
door&mdash;a history which it was quite impossible for her to
unfold to the innocent Jenny. The owner was a wealthy bachelor
who, not being too great a favourite in English society, spent
most of his time abroad among persons not so particular. He had
many houses besides the little residence in the lane by the park,
the bijou, toy-like bagatelle of a place which was always either
closed up or inhabited for brief periods by ladies for whom,
however exquisite and luxurious in appearance, honest Mrs. Nangle
could not find hard enough names; it was all very discreetly
done, of course, there was nothing that anyone could lay hold of
or complain about; nevertheless the state of affairs was bitterly
resented by the Hambletons and the Hambletons' servants.</p>

<p>Maids? Yes, she could have told Jenny something about the
maids They weren't a bit of company for honest girls; French and
Italian they were mostly, and no better than the hussies they
served, and that was saying the utmost.</p>

<p>Jenny broke into Mrs. Nangle's indignant thoughts about the
house next door.</p>

<p>"I saw a light," she said: "it seemed to be the only light
there was, everything else was dark and misty, the fog was coming
up fair thick."</p>

<p>"A light next door!" exclaimed Mrs. Nangle, "why, surely
there'd be nobody there now; I had a look at it as I got out of
the hackney; it seemed to me to be shut up all right."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was the caretaker."</p>

<p>"I've never heard of one in that house," said Mrs. Nangle;
when it's shut up it's shut up, but it's no business of ours,"
she added, "and I dare say Mr. Monkswell or one of his friends
might come back sudden-like; you mustn't take any notice of that
house, Jenny, they're all eccentric&mdash;that's what the master
calls them. There's plenty of company here, there's the new
housemaid coming with Mrs. 'Withers to-morrow, then by the end of
the week there'll be the other maids back, and nice good girls
they are, such as I'd like to see you friends with, Jenny. Have
you finished the washing-up and put everything back tidy like I
showed you?"</p>

<p>Jenny, smiling, held up the last plate.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've just finished, auntie; then we can go to bed?"</p>

<p>"That you shall, everything is ready, and you've been yawning
the last half-hour, Jenny."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle went cheerfully round the lower portion of the
house, bolted and locked the doors back and front, and saw that
the fastenings of the shutters were secure; she had put out the
candles in the kitchen, leaving only that in the little bedroom,
when she was startled by a sharp cry from Jenny and the clatter
of a broken plate. Coming into the kitchen she saw that the girl
had turned round with her back to the sink and the plate she had
been holding had dropped at her feet, where it had smashed on the
stone flooring of the passage.</p>

<p>"Why, Jenny, what's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie, I heard a step, there's someone in the
house!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Jenny; now you've broken a plate and that'll spoil
the set!"</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie, I did hear someone&mdash;a step it was, just
outside that passage!" And Jenny fled into the warmth and light
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"No one could have got in," said Mrs. Nangle, firmly, yet
listening intently. "The keys were in the right place and Mrs.
Claypole is to be relied on, though I do say she might have
stayed to welcome us. Everything was shut up and proper."</p>

<p>"It's that lonely," breathed Jenny, "just on to that great
park place; it's worse than the village, and you always said you
found that lonely after London."</p>

<p>"You can't judge London from this," said Mrs. Nangle, sharply.
"You run in and get to bed, Jenny."</p>

<p>But Jenny was listening with straining ears and said
immediately:</p>

<p>"There's someone walking up and down outside, auntie, I heard
'em&mdash;a step on the stairs, someone came down and then went
back again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle had also heard a sound.</p>

<p>"D'you think Mrs. Claypole stayed behind," reflected Mrs.
Nangle, "meaning to meet us, went to sleep upstairs in one of the
rooms, and then has woke up sudden-like?"</p>

<p>"Then why doesn't she come in, why does she come down to the
door and go back again?" asked Jenny, fearfully.</p>

<p>The footsteps were now as unmistakable to Mrs. Nangle as they
had been from the first to Jenny.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of something like this!" said Jenny, "in this
great awful house. Oh, I wish I'd never come. What shall we
do&mdash;run out at the front, auntie, up that area, and see if
we can find someone in the street?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," said Mrs. Nangle, brusquely, "it's Mrs.
Claypole if it's anybody; I'm not afraid&mdash;what is there to
be afraid of? There's always a 'peeler' at the corner come to
that."</p>

<p>"I didn't see him," said Jenny: "when I looked out there was
nothing but empty houses and mist." She suddenly gripped her
aunt's stout arm. "Look there, auntie, what's that?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle looked. A line of light showed under the outer and
further door that gave on to the passage and stairs.</p>

<p>"It will be Mrs. Claypole," said Mrs. Nangle, advancing
boldly. "Never you fear, Jenny; get behind me if you're
scared."</p>

<p>"I'm scared all right," quavered Jenny. "It's a ghost, that's
what it is, or thieves or murderers."</p>

<p>"It may be Mrs. Withers, or one of the maids, what come
earlier than was thought of."</p>

<p>"But we didn't hear no hackney coach, we didn't hear no one
come to the door," said Jenny, shivering. "I tell you, auntie,
it's thieves or murderers."</p>

<p>The very grossness of the exaggeration of these childish fears
encouraged Mrs. Nangle. She advanced boldly and threw open the
door above which the light appeared and called out in a
formidable voice:</p>

<p>"Who's there and what do you want?"</p>

<p>The basement stairs, narrow and dark, ran sideways to the door
that the cook threw open. On these stood a young woman, holding
in her hands a small bedroom lamp. Even Jenny's fears (she was
peering from behind her aunt's stout back) were allayed at the
sight of a person of her own sex.</p>

<p>"There, you see, Jenny," said Mrs. Nangle, on a breath of
relief, "it'll be the new housemaid."</p>

<p>She addressed the young woman:</p>

<p>"You gave us a fair fright. Are you the new housemaid,
Dolly?"</p>

<p>The young woman replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm the new housemaid, Dolly, and I suppose you're the
cook?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm Mrs. Nangle and this is my niece, what's going to be
kitchenmaid. When did you come?"</p>

<p>"Hours ago," replied the young woman. "I've been alone in the
house, wandering about looking for somebody."</p>

<p>"But didn't you hear us arrive, and how is it you aren't
coming to-morrow with Mrs. Withers? You'd better come down into
the light and warmth, you'll be fair perished up there."</p>

<p>"I am," said the young woman, "fair perished."</p>

<p>She followed Mrs. Nangle and Jenny into the kitchen. The tale
she told, standing at the kitchen table, was simple, if confused.
She had had an appointment to meet Mrs. Withers, the housekeeper,
on, as she thought, the Monday&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle broke in:</p>

<p>"No, it was Tuesday, that was all arranged."</p>

<p>"Well, so it seems," said the new housemaid: "anyhow I made
that mistake, and I came on here, and there was someone
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'd be old Mrs. Claypole."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Claypole&mdash;well, she let me in. She said I'd
better wait for you; she was sure you'd be here. That's why she
didn't wait herself."</p>

<p>"Then why weren't you looking out for us?" asked Mrs. Nangle,
angrily. "We came afore it was dark, and noise enough we made
getting that trunk down these steps."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the young woman, "I must have been asleep.
You see, Mrs. Claypole&mdash;isn't that the name&mdash;showed me
a little room at the top of the house; she said I'd got to sleep
there and so&mdash;I&mdash;I was looking about and putting things
in order and being hungry, sleepy and tired with
travelling&mdash;because I've come up from Warwickshire, you
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Warwickshire? I didn't know the new housemaid was coming from
there. Why, wasn't Dolly Standish coming up from Oxford?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about&mdash;I'm Dolly
Standish, and I've come up from Warwickshire. Well, I was tired
and fell asleep, that's how I missed you, I suppose."</p>

<p>She sat down at the table and folded her arms on the white
deal.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Mrs. Nangle, good-humouredly; "we
didn't know you were here and you missed our coming; but here we
all are; I suppose you'd like some supper?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't want anything. It seems to me you've just cleared
away and were going to bed."</p>

<p>"Why, you must have something," said Jenny in her relief and
pleasure at finding the visitor to be no other than Dolly the
housemaid.</p>

<p>Dolly smiled: "I don't want anything."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle was looking at her critically. She had decided at
once that this was not quite the sort of girl she would have
thought either her mistress or Mrs. Withers the housekeeper would
have chosen; for both these ladies were biased in favour of
honest, pious country-girls; good creatures like her Jenny. Mrs.
Nangle was rather afraid that Jenny would be too pretty to please
the housekeeper, but Dolly Standish's beauty put Jenny's modest
charms completely in the shade. And yet Mrs. Nangle, considering
her as she sat at the kitchen table, could scarcely have said
where this beauty lay. Her mouth was too wide, her cheek-bones
were too high, her eyes were deep-set&mdash;yet somewhere in
colour and outline, in poise and movement, was beauty. She had an
abundance of bright hair drawn up under a muslin cap and wore a
lilac-sprigged cotton dress much too large for her. Noticing the
ill-fit of this garment Mrs. Nangle cried out:</p>

<p>"Why, Dolly Standish, you're wearing one of my cotton
dresses!"</p>

<p>"One of yours, is it?" said the new housemaid. "I'm sorry, I
suppose I got into the wrong room upstairs."</p>

<p>"Well, even if you did, you needn't have gone opening the
cupboards and taking the things out," said Mrs. Nangle. "Hadn't
you got your own?"</p>

<p>"My trunk hadn't got here, it was all part of the muddle, I
suppose. I was looking round and I found these things in a
drawer; I thought, perhaps, they belonged to the last girl."</p>

<p>"But you got into my room," said Mrs. Nangle. "A fine business
the whole thing seems to have been. Not that I mind you having
the dress, but it don't fit."</p>

<p>"It's well enough," replied Dolly Standish. "It don't show
with an apron over it."</p>

<p>"But where's the sense in putting on a print dress at this
time of night?" asked Mrs. Nangle, with some contempt. "It seems
to me you fair lost your head, my girl. Why didn't you keep on
your travelling clothes?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've been here hours," replied Dolly, "and I didn't
know but what I might be expected to do some work."</p>

<p>"No work," said Mrs. Nangle, contemptuously, "until Mrs.
Withers comes and gives directions; you ought to have come with
her; I don't know what's gone wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, it's too late to go into that now," said Dolly.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to sleep?" asked Mrs. Nangle, "it's
getting fair late with all this talking."</p>

<p>"I'll sleep upstairs, if you don't mind. There's everything up
there except sheets and pillow-cases&mdash;I was coming down for
them."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come in?" asked Mrs. Nangle.</p>

<p>"Well, you opened the door before I had a chance."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you was walking up and down the passage&mdash;I
heard you, and up and down the stairs once or twice."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, I lost my way, I suppose; it seems to be
nothing but passages and stairs and closets here."</p>

<p>Dolly rose and steadied herself, there seemed an impatience in
her manner. Mrs. Nangle primly thought that she would not "suit"
but, in her honest heart, she had to admit that there was nothing
against the girl.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your hand?" she asked, as she noticed
that Dolly's right hand, which she had held under her apron, was
wrapped very thickly and clumsily round with a napkin.</p>

<p>"That's partly what I came down for, too; I wanted to bathe
it. I hurt it trying to open one of those windows&mdash;the bolts
were rusty."</p>

<p>"That they weren't," said Mrs. Nangle, grimly: "there's
nothing ever gets rusty in this house. If you hurt yourself it's
your own clumsiness."</p>

<p>"I'll bathe it for you and tie it up," said Jenny, hurrying
for a bowl of water.</p>

<p>But Dolly had already gone to the sink.</p>

<p>"I'll do it myself, I'm used to doing things for myself. I've
been looking all over the house for water," she added
impatiently, and it seemed indignantly. "No water anywhere except
down in the basement?"</p>

<p>"Where do you expect to find it?" asked Mrs. Nangle.</p>

<p>The girl turned on the water; from the darkness of the passage
they heard the gush from the faucet. Mrs. Nangle had looked out
some old linen rags.</p>

<p>"You had better take her these, Jenny."</p>

<p>As Dolly Standish heard Jenny approach she threw away the
water in the bowl in which she had bathed her hand.</p>

<p>"My! there's a lot of blood, it must have been a bad cut!"
said Jenny. "The napkin's soaked, too; it doesn't look like a
napkin, it's part of a lady's dress."</p>

<p>Dolly Standish looked over her shoulder and smiled at
Jenny.</p>

<p>The girl drew back before that smile. In the half-darkness and
the uncertain obscurity of the passage there seemed to the
country girl something dreadful in this new housemaid's smile.
She drew back to her aunt, silent, after timidly placing her
bundle of linen rags within Dolly Standish's reach.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle was again airing sheets and pillow-cases before
the sinking fire, which still gave out a faint but grateful
warmth.</p>

<p>The new housemaid returned from the sink, her arm swathed in
bandages, which she had clumsily tied with her free hand, and
refused further assistance.</p>

<p>A sullen, difficult piece, thought Mrs. Nangle. Aloud she
said:</p>

<p>"Come on, Jenny, let's go to bed. Dolly can go upstairs when
she feels tired enough."</p>

<p>"I'm going now," said Dolly, pulling the sheets from the
chairs by the fire.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll leave that candle for you. You'll be down by six
o'clock, I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be up early."</p>

<p>"Early! Six is late, but we'll allow that to-morrow."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nangle and Jenny went into their little room. Mrs. Nangle
was soon undressed, in bed and asleep. Jenny put on her thick
cotton nightgown, then her flowered chintz dressing-gown, and
went on her knees by her bed and said her nightly prayer. She
then crept between the sheets which were quite cold and tried to
sleep, but she found this was impossible. The strangeness of the
place, the sudden coming of Dolly and the personality of Dolly
kept her wide awake and in an excited condition; so excited, in
fact, was Jenny that she could not for very long lie still, and
when she was quite sure that her aunt was asleep she sat up,
struck a flint and tinder and looked round the small dim bedroom
which was really like a cell compared with the small chamber she
was used to under the eaves looking over the little kitchen
garden. It was really a horrible place, she was quite sure she
would not stay. Meanwhile she was consumed with curiosity about
Dolly. She had not heard Dolly go upstairs. Why was the girl
lingering? Was she, despite her bravado, really afraid as she,
Jenny, would have been desperately afraid to go upstairs to those
lonely dark attics, with no more protection than one small
candle?</p>

<p>Held by breathlessness, curiosity, and a certain agitated
sympathy with the other girl, little Jenny cautiously opened the
door of the narrow bedroom and looked across the stone passage to
the door of the kitchen; this stood ajar and there was a light
within. At this sight Jenny immediately quenched her own. Dolly,
then, had not gone upstairs; she was, of course, afraid and, no
doubt, lonely; why she must be much more lonely than she, Jenny,
was for she had got Aunt Nangle, but Dolly Standish had no one;
she must be terribly homesick and Jenny's kind little heart
softened towards the stranger whom she did not like; she would go
in and talk to her, though there was something rather dreadful in
getting out of bed when one was supposed to be asleep and talking
to anybody, and, doubtless, it was fearfully late. But Jenny was
excited and, apart from her sympathy with "poor Dolly," there was
a certain half-dreadful thrill in the adventure.</p>

<p>How strange and even delightful it would be to have a private
gossip with this other girl, this stranger who was so different
from herself in every way! She could ask Dolly all the things she
had not liked to ask her in front of Mrs. Nanglewhere she came
from? Where had she been before? (for she surely was much older
than Jenny). How she liked this great gloomy mansion on the edge
of the park? Perhaps she knew London and could tell Jenny
something about that wonderful city. So Jenny put on her little
dimity gown, the bedroom slippers she had made herself and
carefully quilted, and crept across the passage, peeping round
the open door of the kitchen.</p>

<p>She knew there was something dreadful about this moment, that
she was being impelled to it despite her own real and secret
wish, and she recalled&mdash;she knew not why&mdash;some of the
most terrifying stories of her childhood; one, in particular,
where an unfortunate traveller, finding himself in a deserted
house, peeps through the half-open door of a room and sees the
Devil in person seated at the table. Jenny's grandmother had told
her that story, oh, many times, and always had ended by
saying&mdash;"It's a dangerous thing to peep through a half-open
door."</p>

<p>Jenny was peeping through a half-open door then and saw not
the Devil but Dolly Standish, the new servant-maid, sitting at
the table, her bandaged arm resting on the white deal and her
face turned towards the shuttered window. Something in the
stillness of her attitude and the averted line of her countenance
made Jenny draw back, she had come so quickly and soundlessly
that she had not disturbed Dolly and, timid yet curious, she hung
back in the shadows of the passage, peering through that
half-open door. Dolly slowly turned her head and at sight of her
face Jenny had to put her fingers quickly to her mouth, an
instinct of self-preservation made her silent though her impulse
had been to cry out&mdash;why?</p>

<p>Dolly's face had changed. There was no colour in it at all.
The eyes seemed sunk deeper into her head, her lips were drawn
back a little from her teeth. Jenny had never seen a look like
that on any face before. Surely, Dolly was not well, but Jenny
was too frightened to call Mrs. Nangle and, staring in a deeper
curiosity and a dreadful apprehension, she saw Dolly do a most
curious thing. First, she took off her muslin cap&mdash;Mrs.
Nangle's clear-starched cap which she had found in the drawer in
the attic, then she put her fingers into her hair&mdash;which was
very beautiful and abundant, held up in a strong net&mdash;and
out of this hair she drew, one after the other, gold
pieces&mdash;sovereigns, Jenny knew them for&mdash;and placed
them on the table. The candle that Mrs. Nangle had left stood in
front of the girl as one by one she pulled the golden coins from
her hair and laid them on the scrubbed deal of the kitchen table.
Then she counted them, ranged them in two little piles, and once
more putting her fingers into that rich tangle of locks she drew
out what appeared to the affrighted eyes of Jenny to be a rich
diamond, she held this up to the candlelight watching the colours
run in and out of the many-facetted stone, then she turned it
over in the palm of her hand, and all the while Jenny watched
fascinated&mdash;watched too long, for the new housemaid seemed
to sense that she was being observed and suddenly turned round,
fixing those beautiful sunken eyes on the passage beyond the
half-open door.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come in?" she said contemptuously.</p>

<p>Jenny crept into the doorway.</p>

<p>"I didn't like to&mdash;somehow, to disturb you."</p>

<p>"Why aren't you asleep&mdash;why did you get up?" asked Dolly
Standish, putting her hands over the diamond and the gold
pieces.</p>

<p>"I was waiting to hear you go upstairs," stammered Jenny.</p>

<p>"And I was waiting for you to go to sleep," said Dolly.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Jenny.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; it's early yet. Is your aunt asleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's asleep all right," said Jenny. She looked at the
fire and saw that Dolly had made it up again.</p>

<p>"You didn't think I was going to sit without a fire, did you?"
asked Dolly: "it's as cold as hell down here."</p>

<p>This fearful word made Jenny shiver. She wondered, too, in
horror what Dolly meant by "cold as hell," she always thought of
hell as the place of eternal flames. She crept to the fire and
warmed herself, for she was shivering with chill after hesitating
in the passage. She looked at the hoard under Dolly's
outstretched hands, and said:</p>

<p>"That's a powerful lot of money you've got, Dolly."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't, there isn't twenty pounds there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But twenty pounds is a lot of money."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it would be to you, but it's not so very much
to me&mdash;my savings!"</p>

<p>"And you carry them about like that in your hair?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It's safe, isn't it? Where's a poor girl to keep her
money?"</p>

<p>"But how long you must have worked to have saved twenty
pounds!" wondered Jenny, her lovely eyes round and awestruck.
"Twenty pounds, Dolly Standish&mdash;why, I'm getting three
pounds a year, and Mrs. Mangle's taking half of that to buy my
clothes, it'll be a long time before I save twenty pounds!"</p>

<p>"Why, so it would the way you are living now in this hideous
house. How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a bit older than that." She looked up sharply,
tapping her cheeks as if to bring back a little colour into them.
"You're pretty," she said, staring at Jenny across the
candlelight. "You'll get together twenty pounds all right before
you're my age."</p>

<p>"What's prettiness got to do with it?" asked Jenny.</p>

<p>Dolly Standish laughed out loud, then, checking herself, she
said:</p>

<p>"I'd like a glass of wine, Jenny. Do you know where the wine
cellar is and the keys?"</p>

<p>"How should I know that?" replied Jenny, amazed and
terrified.</p>

<p>Dolly Standish rose, stretching herself, wincing as she moved
her bandaged arm.</p>

<p>"Where does your aunt keep the keys?" she demanded. She took
down a bunch from the dresser. "I suppose these are they."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but you'd never dare touch anything, would
you?"</p>

<p>Dolly did not answer this. She picked up the coins slowly and
twisted them into her hair, swinging the keys on her little
finger as she did so, then laughingly lifted the white stone.</p>

<p>"What's that?" gasped Jenny.</p>

<p>"What do you think it is? A piece of coloured glass, of
course."</p>

<p>Having replaced her treasure-trove in her locks Dolly drew
over them the muslin cap and, taking the keys and the candle,
went into the passage, leaving Jenny shivering over the fire in
the half-dark. She was terrified by Dolly, amazed by Dolly, and
yet, at the same time, fascinated by Dolly. Dolly with those
guineas in her hair and the beautiful stone she had called glass,
but that Jenny felt quite sure was no glass with all those
colours in it! Dolly with her courage and her springing
movements, taking aunt's keys and going down to see if she could
find a bottle of wine!</p>

<p>Dolly found it, too, for she returned with it, two glasses, a
corkscrew and the candle&mdash;all neatly on a tray which she put
on the table.</p>

<p>"You didn't eat no supper," protested Jenny, "so what d'you
want with that stuff now? It's fair poison it is and girls don't
never drink it."</p>

<p>Dolly grinned.</p>

<p>"You'll find out something before you've been in London long,"
she remarked.</p>

<p>"What'd aunt say if she was to wake up?" Jenny was staring as
Dolly drew the cork and poured out the wine. "Don't you pour none
for me, I couldn't drink it."</p>

<p>"You'll learn in time," said Dolly, indifferently, and drank a
glass with relish.</p>

<p>To the terrified and absorbed Jenny she seemed almost a
satanic figure&mdash;her pallor, her beauty, the guineas hidden
in that rich hair under the servant's muslin cap, and Mrs.
Nangle's lilac print frock too large for her, drawn tightly round
her slender waist with the apron strings.</p>

<p>"You'll never stay here," said Jenny.</p>

<p>"Nor you won't either," replied Dolly, flashing round on her.
"Can't you see what sort of a house it is? There'll be prayers
two or three times a day and church twice on Sundays I've seen
the Family Bible upstairs...I suppose you'll get one evening a
month off, then it'll only be to go to church!"</p>

<p>"I don't want no more," quavered Jenny, "I didn't ask for no
more. I just want a comfortable home."</p>

<p>"You won't get it here."</p>

<p>"It fair gives you the creeps," admitted Jenny, "when it's
empty, but when it's full of people&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There'll be work," grinned Dolly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you staying then?" asked Jenny.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not staying," said Dolly, pouring herself another
glass of wine.</p>

<p>"You have hurt your hand bad," murmured Jenny, "I can see the
blood coming through your bandages. Shan't I do it up for you
again?"</p>

<p>She noticed, though she did not dare comment on the fact, that
the heavy wrappings round Dolly's arm were edged with lace and
looked, as she had noticed before, like part of a lady's
dress.</p>

<p>Dolly sat on the table beside the candle. The wine had brought
the colour to her cheeks and a lustre to her eyes. She began to
talk in a low yet wild tone and Jenny understood very little of
what she said, and yet was utterly absorbed by her manner of
saying it.</p>

<p>"I was something like you when I first came to London, but
you're prettier than I ever was. I had more spirit, perhaps."</p>

<p>She was talking differently now&mdash;almost like a lady,
thought Jenny, for a great deal of her common accent had
disappeared. She carried herself more boldly, too, lifting her
head high and using her bandaged arm in gestures both grand and
terrible.</p>

<p>"There are better things for a girl like you than toiling in a
basement kitchen, and things in London that you'll never hear of
from your aunt. Wouldn't you like to go to parties with diamonds
round your neck? Wouldn't you like to have a nice little chariot
to ride about in in the park, and a footman standing up behind?
Wouldn't you like to go to Italy with a fine gentleman as
companion?"</p>

<p>"Dearie me!" said poor Jenny, "I don't know what you're
talking about; you frighten me, you fair do!"</p>

<p>"Frighten?" repeated Dolly, "frighten you? I swear I'm
frightened myself, Jenny, or whatever your name is."</p>

<p>She sat down on a chair and locked her hands (and Jenny
noticed that they did not look like hands that had done much
work) under her chin.</p>

<p>"I wonder where I am going to," she whispered, "I wonder what
will become of me."</p>

<p>"You're not staying here?" said Jenny, half-glad,
half-sorry.</p>

<p>"No, no, I'm going to-night before your aunt wakes up. Where's
her hood and bonnet? I'll wear those."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," protested Jenny, indignantly, "that'd be
stealing; you've got on aunt's dress as it is. Why don't you go
upstairs and put your own things on?"</p>

<p>"They're not suitable," said Dolly Standish. "I'll take your
aunt's things. If you're so particular I can pay for them."</p>

<p>She put her hands to her hair and, pulling out a coin, laid it
on the table. "That'll pay for all your aunt's clothes, I
think."</p>

<p>"I dare say it will, but it all seems strange."</p>

<p>"It's strange enough," grinned Dolly. "You can tell on me if
you like, I don't care."</p>

<p>"Tell on you," whispered Jenny, "what's there to tell? Oh,
this is a fearful house, I wish I'd never come!" She began to
cry.</p>

<p>Dolly turned on her one of those looks which had so terrified
her at the sink when she had been bathing her wounded hand.</p>

<p>"You start whining and wake your aunt!"</p>

<p>"I won't," promised terrified Jenny, "I won't&mdash;I'll be
quite good and quiet. But you do frighten me, you really do."</p>

<p>"I wonder what you'll be like in five years' time!" said Dolly
Standish, taking Mrs. Nangle's bonnet and cloak from the peg
behind the door.</p>

<p>All these peculiar events, so outside Jenny's experience and
even outside her imagination, left her dumb and baffled,
terrified and staring. She could not realize that such things
ever happened, neither could she possibly realize what one did in
circumstances so surprising and, in an odd way, so horrible.</p>

<p>"So you don't like the place and you're going?" she asked,
foolishly.</p>

<p>With a smile that lifted her lip Dolly the new housemaid
replied:</p>

<p>"No, I don't like the place and I'm going."</p>

<p>"But where to? It's the middle of the night&mdash;and
London!"</p>

<p>"The middle of the night," repeated Dolly Standish, tying on
Mrs. Nangle's bonnet and folding the cloak about her
shoulders&mdash;"and London! well, it's not so strange to me as
it is to you!"</p>

<p>Dolly Standish's last action was to drain the final glass of
wine left in the bottle on the table. Then, with another of her
pale, awful smiles to Jenny, she was gone.</p>

<p>Jenny heard her draw the bolts of the area door, heard her go
up the area steps in the darkness and the fog; then, was so
terrified by what she had seen and so frightened of the silence
in which she was left and even by the look of the wine-glasses,
one stained the other clean, and the empty bottle, that she began
to cry softly to herself.</p>

<p>The fire seemed to have suddenly fallen almost out, the candle
was burning low. With an unreasoned desire to hide all traces of
this dreadful interview Jenny hurried away the bottle and glasses
into a cupboard, blew out the candle and crept back to her bed,
shuddering and shivering, but thankful to hear the steady
breathing of Mrs. Nangle.</p>

<p>It was not surprising when poor Jenny, exhausted and agitated,
did finally fall asleep she should sleep heavily and late. But
Mrs. Nangle always said afterwards that it was little short of a
miracle that she herself should have so overslept herself on this
particular morning. It may have been the journey, it may have
been that she had been kept up late by the arrival of the new
housemaid, it may have been, she said, that she had eaten of her
late supper too heavily; whatever it was the fact remained that
Mrs. Nangle slept a good deal later than she had ever known
herself to sleep before. She was wakened in a strange fashion by
a heavy and persistent knocking on the area door. Putting on her
clothes and with a terrified glance at the clock&mdash;for the
first flinging aside of the shutters had filled the kitchen with
pale autumn sunlight&mdash;Mrs. Nangle hurried to the door while
Jenny, only yet half-awake, sat huddled up in bed.</p>

<p>It was a policeman, or "peeler" as Mrs. Nangle called him, who
stood at the bottom of the area steps. Fog still hung over the
late autumn morning, the park was blotted out by a damp mist.</p>

<p>With goggling eyes and straining ears Mrs. Nangle, still
fastening her apron strings, listened to the "peeler's"
story.</p>

<p>It was murder, nothing short of that, murder at the house next
door. Mr. Monkswell, found by two friends who went to have
breakfast with him, murdered in his bedroom. That little top
room...Mrs. Nangle closed the area door, kindly and prudently she
wished to keep this horror from Jenny.</p>

<p>"He never was no good, he's come to the end that's prepared
for them like him!"</p>

<p>"But to think a woman done it&mdash;one what was kept there,
called Sarita Gai; that wasn't her name, you may believe. There
was her clothes all thrown about&mdash;bonnets and gowns. He'd
been robbed of some money."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" cried Mrs. Nangle. Then, "I don't see what it's
got to do with us, young man, though it's a horrid thought that
it was going on while we was here last night."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure it hasn't got something to do with you," said
the "peeler" in a low, mysterious voice. He pointed out a group
of people waiting beyond the area railings. "We all want to have
a look round. You see, mum, she must have crawled out of the
window of Mr. Monkswell's house into the window of
yours&mdash;you know, the top rooms nearly touch."</p>

<p>"My lady has always regretted it," said Mrs. Nangle,
bitterly.</p>

<p>"She didn't care to come out into the street, you see, for
there's a constable at the corner, and she wanted a disguise; I
don't know if you've been upstairs?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't; young Jenny had the terrors and I didn't go up
last night."</p>

<p>"If you do, mum, I dare say you'll find some of your clothes
gone. I have no doubt she took them for a disguise, and I dare
say there'll be blood on the window-sill, she seems to have hurt
herself climbing across, there's a dress torn up, part of which
she might be using as a bandage; she might be coming down to look
for water&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look for water!" exclaimed Mrs. Nangle. "O Lord, the new
housemaid!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a> "&mdash;THE WAY THE WIND
BLOWS"</h2>

<h3>A MORAL TALE OF AN ENGLISH YOUNG LADY&mdash;1830</h3>

<p class="first">
MISS JESSIE PELLEW, vexed and bored, looked out of the
grandiose window on to the first cold primroses. It was a late
spring and the sky heavy with snow. A wagoner with his cart and
team had passed; Miss idly noticed two straws in the road and to
her exasperated mind came a favourite saying of her old nurse,
Sarah Vitty, "a straw shows the way the wind blows." What a
foolish proverb! Miss Pellew looked back again into the large
state room where her uncle, Sir Joseph Bellis, his lawyer, and
Lord Verron and his lawyer, sat at the great table scratching
quills over parchment&mdash;her marriage contract, her marriage
settlement.</p>

<p>Miss disliked all these serious grave men and detested the
business they were discussing in undertones. She glanced sideways
at herself in a wall glass. She saw the reflection of a neat
figure in a morning gown of pink muslin with broad white chenille
trimmings and, because of the unusual cold for this time of year,
a little mantle of blue sarcenet. Her face was smooth, precise
and very childish; she had a clear complexion with freckles like
those on a thrush's egg; her eyes were rather small, her mouth
rather large, she was quite charming and had often heard herself
called a beauty, but that was because she was a considerable
heiress.</p>

<p>As the scratching of quills continued she kicked her little
slippers against the rungs of the high chair and made an
imliatient movement with her hands on the polished arms carved
like snarling dragons.</p>

<p>Lord Verron looked up. He was a comely man of five-andthirty
or so, very formal in his manners, in plain morning dress, his
beaver still on his knee; though he was the chosen husband of the
ward he was not familiar with the guardian, Sir Joseph
Bellis.</p>

<p>Everyone had told Jessie that he was a "splendid match," but
their glances met in a stare which was, on her part at least,
hostile. This quiet man who was to be her husband seemed to her
to be as old as her uncle and nearly as dull. When the dullards
had finished with their documents and she might get down from her
high chair, Lord Verron asked "for a few words with her"; but
Miss tossed her head and pleaded another engagement, then, seeing
her uncle's frown&mdash;"a headache," and so escaped rudely from
the room, not forgetting to look back and give a little insolent
giggle.</p>

<p>Miss Jessie ran up to her own little room and sat down on a
small stool by the side of her nurse who pampered her
considerably; but this was all the pampering poor Miss got (as
she often reminded herself in an access of self-pity), her uncle
and aunt had "done their duty handsomely by her," but no more.
Now she pouted and shrugged, and tears of real temper burnt her
clear innocent eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't like him, Nurse Vitty, and I'm to marry him in
May!"</p>

<p>The nurse, with the feminine craft of her kind, had been
prepared for this and dwelt on the material advantages of the
match&mdash;"a fine town house, a fine country house, horses,
carriages, jewels, crowds of fine friends, to go to Court on the
Queen's birthday&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Jessie interrupted pettishly:</p>

<p>"But I might have had all that anyhow, Nurse Vitty. I'm not
like some poor female who has never had a chance."</p>

<p>The nurse was silent, for the little heiress had indeed always
possessed the best of this world's goods.</p>

<p>"It is a cold spring," said Nurse Vitty at last with a
shudder. "Dearie me! when shall we ever see the sun?"</p>

<p>"The primroses are out," pouted Jessie; she smiled a little to
herself, thinking of the young man yesterday when she had been
riding in the lane who had plucked her a little bunch of these
early flowerets and flung them into her lap. Now, if it had been
he who had been sitting downstairs watching the lawyers bend
their spectacles over their parchments...looking up shyly, she
asked:</p>

<p>"Why does uncle dislike Esquire Brabazon Aylmer, nurse?"</p>

<p>"Because he hasn't a penny-piece," was the ready truth on the
old woman's tongue, but she checked it and began to mutter
vaguely all those platitudes so disagreeable and unimpressive to
the ears of youth.</p>

<p>"Esquire Brabazon Aylmer had his way to make, he was thought
to be a gambler, he was known to be a spendthrift, he was beneath
the rank of Sir Joseph Bellis, Lord Verron didn't like him," and
so on.</p>

<p>Jessie listened impatiently; she knew that old people were
always spiteful like that about young people, she knew
instinctively that dry, prim, church-going men like Sir Joseph
Bellis always hated gay, brilliant and amusing young men like
Brabazon Aylmer. She was, of course, hotly on the side of youth
against age...</p>

<p>The nurse noticed the look and said anxiously:</p>

<p>"I don't know what Esquire Brabazon Aylmer is doing in this
neighbourhood, indeed I don't; hanging about the lanes and fields
with nothing to do. I heard that he was to get a commission and
go abroad, and surely it's the best thing for a young gentleman
who has neither money nor parts."</p>

<p>"He has every right to be here," cried Miss: "he's got a house
here, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"Not what you might call a house. He sold all his lands, every
parcel of them, not long ago. He has only got a field or two and
that little pleasure place, what they call a <i>cottage orné</i>
I think, at Vomersby."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Jessie, "I suppose he has the right to come
there when he likes."</p>

<p>The nurse did not care for the tone of her voice or her
obstinate look. She said, shaking her head sadly:</p>

<p>"'Twill be a good thing when you are married to Lord Verron,
who is an amiable, worthy, steady gentleman, if ever there was
one."</p>

<p>The epithets which she had chosen were not such as were
disposed to prepossess Jessie in favour of her prospective
bridegroom.</p>

<p>That evening when Lady Bellis, with the best intentions in the
world, lectured Miss on the importance of the step she was about
to take and of all the duties incumbent on the marriage state,
Miss sat in mute, grim revolt. She knew absolutely nothing of
anything, little accomplishments were her sole learning and
dreams found an easy entry into this open and unguarded mind.</p>

<p>That night she opened the lattice and looked out at the moon,
as (she had read in <i>The Lady's Magazine</i>) the Elfridas, the
Clorindas, of wild Gothic romances, opened their casements and
"gazed out at the stormy beauty of the night."</p>

<p>It was cold, and she huddled deeper into her white cosy
woollen wrap. There was no need to borrow images from hectic and
exotic romances; the scene was grand enough, the clouds veiled
the full moon, the trees black against the gloomy purple of the
sky. There was no scent of bud or flower, though this was the
Ninth of April, and more snow expected.</p>

<p>Miss thought swooningly of Brabazon Aylmer, of his beautiful
slender figure, the incomparable grace with which he wore his
elegant clothes, of his dark eyes charmingly set under the low
level brows, of his mouth with the arched upper lip, the way his
hair sprang back into strong curls over his shapely ears. She was
sure he had given her lover-like glances though they had met so
seldom, being sternly discouraged by Sir Joseph and frowned on by
my lady. What did Miss know of him? Nothing. But it was very
tormenting and delicious to think about him while standing there
shuddering in the night air and gazing at the moon. Then the
scene, which the lonely girl had so often bent over in the
printed page with eager eyes and burning cheeks, took place in
actuality, and she was almost too amazed to believe it true.</p>

<p>There, beneath her window, clear in the rays of the moon,
stood Esquire Brabazon Aylmer, wrapped in a long travelling
cloak. He was looking up at her and his superb face seemed more
delightful than ever in this silver light. There was a balcony to
the room beneath Jessie's bedchamber and even while she stared at
him, to her terrified but delighted astonishment he had easily
gained that and was speaking to her, using those very words of
love she had always longed to hear:</p>

<p>"I have had no chance, I have been on the rack; you are alone?
I may speak?"</p>

<p>With a trembling hand Miss extinguished the taper beside her
(they always did that, she remembered) and gave a whispered
assent.</p>

<p>"You know what you mean to me, Miss Pellew, you must; you have
read it in my glance, you have heard it in my sighs, and to-day
your marriage contract was signed. These barren, dull wrongheads
have sold you!" Sincere despair sounded in his voice.</p>

<p>Miss leant her head against the mullion and listened, she
hoped she looked lovely in the moonlight.</p>

<p>He gave her beauty, her grace, her sweetness, her virtue, her
unattainable exquisiteness all that extravagant praise which she
had learnt in <i>The Lady's Magazine</i> were the proper tributes
from a lover but which she thought, when she had looked across
the parchment at Lord Verron, she would never hear.</p>

<p>The young man made love with arch delicacy and passion and in
five minutes Miss was won. Terrified lest she should be
discovered, and giddy with her new joy, she promised to escape
from the house the following evening and meet him by the decoy
pond.</p>

<p>Content with this and renewing his protestations the expert
gallant departed.</p>

<p>Miss had the instinctive address to conceal her ecstasy of
elation, and Lady Bellis praised her submission, while Nurse
Vitty told her she was "a dear, good, sweet lamb."</p>

<p>The night was still cold but the moon had overpowered the
clouds. Miss did not know how she found the courage to wait till
the house was dead asleep, and then to slip on her warm pelisse,
her padded slippers and escape from the room, across the great
state chamber where her marriage contract had been signed, to
open the French windows without making a sound, creep across the
balcony and the terrace and run to the decoy pond. There he was,
an impatient lover, a gallant figure outlined against the stately
sheen of the silent water! Oh! it was too good to be true!</p>

<p>He took her at once in his arms, too tenderly to alarm her,
Miss, drooping against his bosom, tasted ecstasy. She told him
eagerly that she loathed Lord Verron and had no hand in the
marriage. She admitted, with a long-repressed passion vowed to
some dream cavalier, that she loved him, "Oh, and no one
else!"</p>

<p>He pressed her for an immediate elopement. Miss's courage rose
high above all obstacles.</p>

<p>During the half-hour that she walked up and down at the side
of the pond with her splendid young lover he had told her much
about himself. He had been unfortunate, he said, "an orphan, like
herself, with none to guide." But he had nothing to accuse
himself of "save follies and those he would soon redeem." He
owned a fair estate in the North, he had well-to-do relatives,
"his connections were good, his reputation spotless." "With the
stimulus of her love he might achieve much"; in brief, she
learned that she had given her heart to an entirely worthy as
well as an entirely brilliant youth, and she agreed to meet him
by the cross-roads within a stone's throw of Ruxtry House in
three days' time. He would have a phaeton and pair ready, they
would go at once to London and be married, then she would be his
wife and all opposition useless.</p>

<p>He proved to be a methodical as well as a romantic young man.
He had written down on a piece of paper full instructions for her
and watched her put it carefully in her bosom before he gave her
his farewell kiss. Miss returned to the house without being
observed and, snuggling into her warm bed, lay all night awake,
pinching herself to find out "if it was true."</p>

<p>Miss put exactly into practice these instructions. She took a
few clothes, only those necessary ("for we can buy everything in
London," he had told her), and the finest of her jewels she could
get hold of without exciting comment, for he had reminded her
"that little as he himself cared for wealth or worldly affairs it
was as well she should take any cherished trinkets with her," for
it would be difficult to get them afterwards. Miss wished she
could have packed in the small travelling case (which she was
able to carry herself) her parure of emeralds, her cameos set in
gold, her onyx and diamond bracelets, the pearls she had had
given her on her last birthday, her mother's rubies, last set for
the coronation of His late Majesty, but her uncle had charge of
these, those in her possession were but trifles. A happy secret
teaches clever deceit as well as a guilty conscience. Miss was
dutiful and obedient; she even submitted to a state visit from
Lord Verron. They sat either side of the hearth and talked about
the severe weather, "how difficult the roads were becoming for
the coaches and how late the mail from London had been"; Miss
felt a very expert conversationalist and she wondered why a
little smile seemed to lurk about the corners of my lord's fine
mouth and why he gave her so constantly that straight searching
look he had turned on her when their marriage-contract was
signed.</p>

<p>When the dawn of the day of the elopement broke Miss felt her
first pangs of fear and apprehension. The weather had increased
in severity; everyone said that such cold had never been
remembered at this time of the year. For two nights there had
been an intense frost, and the day was far more wintry than the
usual day would have been in December or January; in the middle
of the day there was a fall of snow which soon dissolved, to
Miss's joy, in Ruxtry Park. Tales came in during the day that in
some parts it lay a foot deep and had frozen again. Sir Joseph
prosed on about "the losses among the sheep and lambs, the delay
with coaches and carriers."</p>

<p>The terrible sick apprehension and disappointment that a
feared delay in some deeply cherished plans means afflicted Miss;
she could scarcely control herself. When at length the great
moment came the snow had ceased and the moon was again shining
over the frosty park.</p>

<p>From the little room beside that of Mrs. Vitty, who was
snoring cosily, Miss crept away in her thickest pelisse, her fur
tippet, her little pink bonnet of padded satin, and her case of
jewels and linen in her hand. She did not fail to write a note to
her guardian, for in many a tale she had read that this was the
correct thing for the heroine to do before she eloped. Her
fingers stiff with the cold, for the fire had fallen out in the
bedchamber, Miss penned a missive couched in the formal terms
which were the only ones she knew but full of rebellion, stating
clearly with whom she was leaving Ruxtry and why&mdash;her
dislike of Lord Verron and her defiance of them all. She was so
agitated that she could not for a moment think where to leave
this note&mdash;the pincushion, surely! But that in her
nervousness she could not find, and her hands were so cold. Then
she picked up her muff&mdash;how foolish not to have thought of
that before&mdash;the note would do on the little bureau...she
was out of the house and away. How easily one could escape!</p>

<p>The cold was intense, those were surely snow clouds riding up
in a dense hard pack behind the moon as if to overtake and
extinguish the icy light. The trees had a stiff look, the grass
stood rigid and frozen. This was a very different adventure from
just running down to the duckpond; it did not seem far to the
cross-roads in the daytime, but it seemed a long way at night.
They were gained at last with many a slip of a tired small foot,
and many a palpitation of an overwrought heart, and there he was
in his greatcoat striding up and down beneath the signpost which
bore the directions of four ways.</p>

<p>He greeted her with all a lover's eager courtesy and took from
her at once her case and comforted her about her cold journey,
and warmed her hands in his. But she detected beneath his ardour
a certain uneasiness and after a moment or two he confessed that
"the phaetons had not come and that the roads were almost
impassable; he did not know how they were to contrive to get to
town that night," and he cursed his luck with unmistakable
sincerity. Miss was completely dismayed.</p>

<p>"Let us wait awhile. If you have engaged a man he must
arrive."</p>

<p>"Fond foolish one," said Mr. Brabazon Aylmer, "how can the
fellow come if the roads are impossible for the horses? I heard
that they had stopped the coaches. I was minded to send you a
letter asking you to come another time, but could not think of a
messenger, you are kept so cursed close, my love."</p>

<p>The night darkened down. The clouds soon overwhelmed the moon,
only a fitful light remained, but Mr. Brabazon Aylmer had a dark
lantern under his greatcoat and showed that to reassure Miss, who
began to fall into a childish fear.</p>

<p>"We may be overtaken. Oh, I would sooner die! Let us go
towards London, even if we have to walk."</p>

<p>"I would," he replied, "that it were possible for you to walk,
but it is several miles, and you&mdash;" his voice broke off, and
she began to cry with vexation.</p>

<p>Miss could have walked it if it had not been for her slippers
and her terror and the coming storm. Then there was a sudden rise
of wind and the clouds scattered like great stallions across the
gloomy sky, seeming to rise and fall in front of the cold moon.
The snow fell in stormy gusts overwhelming them as they stood
beneath the signpost.</p>

<p>"The phaeton will not come, that's sure," said Brabazon
Aylmer. And Miss moaned.</p>

<p>"I must go back, we will try another night. Come with me as
far as the gates, at least."</p>

<p>"No, my charmer, there is no refuge for you. What, do you
think a few flakes of snow are going to prevent me in my design?
No, indeed; my passion for you is far too great."</p>

<p>These words a little consoled Miss even through her fright and
discomfort. He helped her to walk along the frozen road. She
wondered where he could be going. It was impossible for them to
go to the village or to a neighbour's house, they would both be
instantly recognized by everyone and, country-bred, she knew that
no bribe would make any man take a horse out on a night like
this.</p>

<p>He was more adroit than she supposed for he soon found a way
out of her predicament.</p>

<p>"There's the mausoleum," he said; "it used to be mine before I
sold the ground, it will be warm and dry at least in there."</p>

<p>But Miss cried out against this...she well knew the old brick
circular mausoleum of the Aylmers. But he replied impatiently to
her objections, "that the dead had not been buried there for
years, and a portion of it was never aught but the chapel."</p>

<p>Still Miss would not go there, and certainly she would not be
left alone, she would rather go cold and hungry and walk about
all night in the storm. Her voice rose hysterically above the
wind and then as the inclemency of the night increased and her
terror and agitation became more overwhelming she began to run
through the snow, just running blindly into the large scudding
flakes which she could see now by the light of Brabazon Aylmer's
lantern, now by the transient moonbeams which pierced the
hurrying clouds. Out of this confusion of seething storm and snow
(it seemed to Miss a very chaos of disaster), she saw a house, a
door, suddenly loom, and she recognized it as her lover's
pleasure-house at Vomersby. What a relief! Miss thought, and how
stupid of him not to have suggested this instead of the
mausoleum!</p>

<p>"Quick, quick!" she cried out.</p>

<p>She heard her lover running behind her as hard as he was able
on the frozen road, and she saw the beams of his lantern close to
her.</p>

<p>"Have you the key? Or is there any way in which we can break
in? Why did you not think of this before? I did not know we were
so near."</p>

<p>"Nor I," he answered. "The place is in disorder, it is not fit
for you."</p>

<p>"But better than the mausoleum," shivered Miss.</p>

<p>"I would not take you there," he repeated, "I would not go
there myself. It has unpleasant associations, I have been there
with ill companions, I wish to have done with Vomersby."</p>

<p>"But chance has brought us here," cried Miss, shaking with
cold, terror and impatience. "At least it will be shelter, and
you must have food and a bed within. In the morning the storm may
be over, or if need be I can be hidden here all to-morrow."</p>

<p>He took a key from his pocket with which he opened the door
and she passed into the passage. It was a pleasant place, as his
lantern showed, and gaily furnished. Miss ran into the first
room, took off her pelisse, shaking off the snow; she dashed the
flakes from her long-haired muff and kicked off her soaked shoes
with the unconsciousness of complete inexperienced innocence and
ignorance.</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously then, the shutters being already
closed, took pains to stuff up the chinks before he lit the
candles. She crouched up on the sofy while he got food and lit a
fire. He brought her a drink of apricot brandy and, looking at
her lying there, half-drowsy, in the reaction from her fright and
fatigue, he muttered half to himself, "Well, this settles the
affair anyway. There's no going back now." Miss's gaiety
returned, "she told him she would hide in Vomersby as long as he
wished."</p>

<p>He sat down moodily on the other side of the fire and took his
face in his hands. Miss was sorry for him, "all his plans
spoilt!" She was quick to see that he felt himself humiliated in
her eyes by his failure, she did her best to soothe and encourage
him.</p>

<p>"We should have been married by now," he murmured, "I had not
intended this."</p>

<p>Nor had she thought of it. She sat upright, flushed and then
paled and felt sick at heart; for she knew enough from the tales
she had read and the hints and anecdotes of her old nurse to know
that she was ruined in reputation and honour if it should be
discovered that she had spent the night alone at Vomersby with
Esquire Brabazon Aylmer. Quite the reason for the terrible
disgrace attaching to such a disaster Miss could not fathom, but
instinct told her that this was an outrage on all decorum and
modesty.</p>

<p>"You're safe with me here, my love."</p>

<p>Miss could not quite understand him. She began to hate the
charming little room with Chinese monsters in the glass cabinets
and the pastel pictures on the walls, the French carpet on the
floor. She looked about and beheld a woman's workbasket with a
long grey glove falling out of it. His glance followed hers, he
snatched up the glove and threw it in the fire.</p>

<p>"I told you I had had ill companions here. Do you sleep," he
added, controlling himself, "and I will sit beside you all night
and guard against any surprise."</p>

<p>"I'll go upstairs," said Miss, faintly. "Give me a light. I'll
leave you here."</p>

<p>He said with a dark look: "No, it is all in disorder upstairs,
I would not have you in any of those chambers."</p>

<p>Miss, with some dignity, insisted and, seeing he did not offer
to help, herself took a candle and ascended the short stairs of
the pleasure-house. She opened a door at random&mdash;a pretty
room with birds on the wall-paper. The bed was not dressed but
there were blankets folded on it and pillows, "'twould do well
enough. If she must pass the night in the same house with him she
would not pass it in the same room." She looked at herself in a
mirror, her face looked grey and withered in the pink silk of the
Paris bonnet. "Oh, he will never love me if I look like that,"
she thought, and she remembered the toilet necessaries in her
satchel. Running down to get this she surprised him in the act of
opening the case, his hands already turning over seed pearl and
coral with, she feared, disgust...did he despise her as frivolous
for bringing these pretty toys? Miss thought this prying an
ungentlemanly action, but he excused himself coolly:</p>

<p>"I wished to see what you have brought; there is no great
responsibility in all this, but I shall be held accountable for
them. Could you get nothing of value? Some females would have
contrived to do so."</p>

<p>Miss answered stupidly</p>

<p>"I brought all I had myself. I have many more&mdash;but my
uncle keeps them."</p>

<p>He asked sharply: "Why did you come down for them?"</p>

<p>"It was not for those," said Miss, blushing, "but for the
other things in the case. Please keep the jewels and look after
them to-night."</p>

<p>Miss took her linen and the toilet articles and went upstairs.
She was disappointed that her lover had parted from her so
abruptly; no doubt he was upset, overcome, chagrined; but surely
tenderness need not have dropped from him so suddenly?</p>

<p>Everything in her room was comfortable and her door locked.
Feeling secure and tired Miss snuggled down under the coverlet,
pulled the pillows into position under her head and slept. The
bitter dawn was in the room showing through the thick silk
curtains before he knocked at the door. Miss rose up all startled
finding herself awry, both in her person and her heart, but soon
put herself to rights and was out on the stairhead with her case
and her pelisse, her slippers and her pink bonnet, a little thick
powder on her cheeks, too, for she had been frightened at her own
pallor.</p>

<p>Miss was still further frightened at the appearance of Mr.
Brabazon Aylmer. He looked as if he had been deadly sick during
the night; his handsome face was greenish, his features appeared
pinched, his hands trembled.</p>

<p>"There's been a thaw," he said hoarsely. "This is our only
chance to get away. My God! what a night." And with an
extravagantly embroidered handkerchief he wiped the sweat from
his forehead.</p>

<p>"I slept," rebuked Miss, gently, "though I suppose you would
feel great anxiety, but there has been no one?" She looked round
the pretty room.</p>

<p>"No one," he repeated, and his glance followed hers and he
shuddered as if some of the thawing ice had got down his
back.</p>

<p>Miss sighed, if he had been an ideal lover he would have got
her a cup of coffee, or some comforting drink, and she asked
pettishly: "Are there no provisions in the house?"</p>

<p>"Why, some I believe in the kitchen," he said, impatiently
buttoning his greatcoat.</p>

<p>"Well then, I will get some. We will have a hot drink if
nothing else. I am so hungry and cold, too."</p>

<p>"Don't go into the kitchen," he commanded; "don't stop for
coffee, we'll get all on the journey. There's only one man here
whom I could trust to get horses from. And that's Jeremiah
Hartslib at 'The Mare and Foal'&mdash;he'll oblige me&mdash;that
damned fellow and the phaeton!"</p>

<p>Miss wished that her lover would not swear so much. She knew
now what had given Brabazon Aylmer a reputation for "wildness"
among men like her uncle and Lord Verron. She was sorry, too,
about the coffee, it seemed churlish on his part. She followed
him, however, dutifully, shivering and shuddering into the bleak
day.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Hartslib, too, she had heard his name mentioned. He
kept an inn, one ill-frequented, except by poachers and footpads,
it was said, and the man himself she had often heard her uncle
declare should be on the first excuse turned from the
neighbourhood. But it was to Jeremiah Hartslib's broken-down
tavern that they made their way across the frosty fields.</p>

<p>Miss was too occupied in gratitude for the fact that evidently
she had not yet been missed, at any rate had not been pursued, to
care much about other matters.</p>

<p>The village of Payny Wyke seemed yet asleep; they met no one
and when they got to the inn there was some difficulty in
arousing Mr. Hartslib, but when he was awakened Esquire Brabazon
Aylmer instantly went into an inner room and had a short
conversation with him, the result of which was that they were
quickly accommodated with a hackney and two stout horses, and Mr.
Hartslib himself drove them to London. Once they were on their
way Miss found that her lover's spirits rose. He became once more
the ardent wooer of that first magic interview beneath her window
and of that wonderful walk by the decoy pond.</p>

<p>They put up, evidently through some preconceived plan with Mr.
Hartslib, at a small inn in Covent Garden, called "The Rainbow."
Miss detested the look of the place, but he said gaily, what did
it matter, "they would be married in half an hour or so." And now
Miss could have her coffee or whatever else she wished, and he
was coaxing and kind again, and a pleasant enough meal was sent
in to her, as she sat stiff and half-dazed by the fire the drawer
had hastily lit in the private parlour. She asked him timidly "if
he would not share her refreshment?" But he shook his head and
laughed, and said he had a queasy stomach and required something
stronger by this hour of the morning. When he came back in half
an hour she could see he had been drinking. He was like the
gentlemen after they had come to dinner and stayed late with Sir
Joseph, but he had himself well in hand.</p>

<p>"Well, my charmer," he cried, "you look more adorable than
ever. I will give you some money and you must go out and buy what
you wish. As for your jewels you must not worry about them, I
have them in safe custody."</p>

<p>Miss had not thought of the jewels and she wondered why he
mentioned them, she wondered still more at his next remark.</p>

<p>"Is it true, my sweet girl, that you have entire control of
your own fortune when you are twenty-one and that you were
twenty-one last birthday?"</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose it is true," said Miss, amazed. "I don't know,
you must ask the lawyers." Why had he asked that? He must have
taken some trouble to inform himself of her affairs.</p>

<p>He said in quite a reasonable fashion:</p>

<p>"One must inform oneself of how one stands; it is not my
intention to take a large dowry with you, for this is a marriage
of love, and I intend to keep my wife myself." He kissed her hand
gracefully.</p>

<p>But Miss still had the feeling that he knew far more about her
affairs than she did herself. He now looked very handsome. He had
adjusted his clothes precisely and it was difficult to recognize
the man so dishevelled, so terror-stricken who had knocked on her
door early that morning. It was strange that his own
pleasure-house at Vomersby should have such a gloomy and
depressing effect on him! She remembered what he had said about
"ill companions," and it occurred to her for the first time that
perhaps there was a great deal in a man's life that a Miss like
herself could not understand.</p>

<p>The day was grey and muddy; he said he would hire a coach for
her and take her to the shops in Regent Street. As he handed her
from her private parlour they had to pass through what seemed to
be a public room. There were two loungers there with pipes and
beer, leaning across the table, and as Miss passed she heard the
one say to the other:</p>

<p>"Look at that handsome young scoundrel with that plain little
piece; there's a pretty game afoot there, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>Miss paused in the doorway. She remembered distinctly her own
face in the mirror when her marriage contract was being signed,
her own face in the mirror at Vomersby...and it was with very
sunk spirits that she followed Mr. Brabazon Aylmer to the hackney
coach. They stopped at a mantuamaker's and he was handing her out
when she saw a man and woman at the corner of the street. The
woman was lurching with an unsteady step and the man was
following her violently with upraised fists. As Miss stared she
beheld the poor creature struck and falling on her knees in the
gutter, while the man rained foul language on her. The sight to
her was beyond everything incredible and terrible, she clutched
her lover's arm and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Stop him, save her!"</p>

<p>But he looked and laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"No doubt the trollop deserved it; come into the shop, my
love."</p>

<p>But Miss did not move. The woman had got up and thrown her
shawl round her head and taken herself off sobbing, while the man
stood muttering and cursing in the gutter.</p>

<p>"I've a headache," said Miss, "a sudden nausea&mdash;I must go
back to the inn."</p>

<p>Mr. Brabazon Aylmer admirably concealed his vexation.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, my dear, you are full of whims and caprices, but
it is true the weather is dismal."</p>

<p>Miss agreed to everything. When they once more alighted at the
Rainbow Inn she saw two straws in the gutter which had fallen
from a cart taking produce to Covent Garden&mdash;"the straws
which show the way the wind blows." She was a "plain little
thing" and he did not care when he saw a man maltreating a woman,
but seemed rather to be amused by it. She assented to everything
with adroit skilfulness. But when he had gone, gay as a feather
to arrange for their marriage, she at once snatched up her case
and left the inn and hastened to the town house of Lord Verron
which had been pointed out to her with pride by her aunt.</p>

<p>Lord Verron, sitting reflectively over his paper and his
morning coffee, was considerably startled when his betrothed,
whom he believed safe at Ruxtry, was shown into his presence, a
draggled, forlorn, sad-looking little Miss, with a damaged
quilted silk bonnet, a pelisse weather-stained, and shoes
bespattered with mud.</p>

<p>"I was stupid enough to come to try to do a morning's shopping
by myself and came by the public coach, now I am frightened and
tired. Perhaps you or Lady Charlotte will look after me."</p>

<p>"My dear child," said Lord Verron, calmly, "I'm afraid it was
very uncomfortable in the public coach and foul weather for you
to have adventured to London alone; I am very glad, though, you
chose to come here." His words were formal but inexpressibly
kind, and Miss was relieved that he did not question or reproach,
comment or even so much as put her in the wrong by a critical
glance.</p>

<p>When he had left the room to fetch his sister, the Lady
Charlotte, Miss's terror (why did she feel terrified as if she
had come through unmentionable horrors?), which had changed into
relief, was renewed when she recollected her foolish farewell
letter; how useless her story of shopping! The note would be
found and everyone would know she had run away with Brabazon
Aylmer. Miss turned sick when my lord returned with his sister;
she would have to confide in one of them, she knew at once it
would not be in the lady who must already be regarding with
curiosity her soiled attire and her unlikely story. So she
decided she would confide her shame, her terror and her confusion
to Lord Verron.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, could I see you alone for a moment?" she said, and
Lady Charlotte found a ready and gracious excuse to leave the
room.</p>

<p>Miss stood upright in the fire-glow, twisting and untwisting
her hands in her muff. Lord Verron waited for her to speak with a
courteous and sympathetic aspect behind which was anxiety and,
she believed, love. Miss had thought him old or plain, now she
had a desire to sink at his feet and dissolve in tears, then her
hand twisting nervously in her muff came upon a screw of paper.
She pulled it out and to her furtive glance saw her own note. In
that stupid panic confusion of leaving her room she had, after
all, pushed the paper into the muff not left it on the bureau. My
lord advanced towards her thinking she was going to weep, but
instead Miss cried with relief:</p>

<p>"After all, I have nothing to tell you," and sat down by the
fire, trembling and struggling back the tears.</p>

<p>"You left Payny Wyke early this morning by the first coach,
bad as the weather was, my dear, because you had a whim and a
desire to make some purchases for yourself, is that not it?"</p>

<p>Miss thought that she detected disappointment behind his
manner. She replied childishly:</p>

<p>"Yes, that was it, and I am very sorry, sir. I will not do it
again; I hope that you will not tell my uncle and aunt."</p>

<p>"I can assure you, Jessie, dear, of my protection and
sympathy." Then he took her hand and told her simply (as if he
knew that this was just the right moment for such an avowal,
using just the right tone and look) that he had always loved Miss
ever since he had seen her a little girl plucking primroses in
the lane.</p>

<p>"And yet," said Miss with a catch in her voice, "I am only a
plain little thing."</p>

<p>"Not to me," smiled the pleasant man, "but very charming and
delightful."</p>

<p>Miss, looking at him and hearing his voice, was moved to do
the most difficult thing of her life.</p>

<p>"I told you," she said, "a lie just now. I left home last
night. I meant to run away with Brabazon Aylmer, but I could not
because of the storm, and we spent the night at Vomersby."</p>

<p>He became so pale that she was frightened, still there was no
harshness in his aspect and he constrained himself to speak
kindly, and Miss, looking into the fire and shading her shamed
face, told her tale.</p>

<p>"Are you angry?" she asked. "Am I entirely disgraced?"</p>

<p>"My poor child," he said, and folded her to his breast.</p>

<p>A few hours later Sir Joseph and Lady Dellis drew up at Lord
Verron's town house. They had met on the road the footman my lord
had sent to inform them of the arrival of Jessie now sweetly
asleep in Lady Charlotte's chamber.</p>

<p>Both Sir Joseph and his wife seemed to my lord's surprise to
make very little matter of Miss's naughty escapade. They accepted
the tale on its face value, and my lord discovered that this was
because they were entirely absorbed with a far more exciting
happening which had occurred at Payny Wyke.</p>

<p>"Murder," said Sir Joseph, standing in front of the fire and
rubbing his hands together, "murder, a most horrid murder, and
almost next door to us."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At that young scoundrel's, Brabazon Aylmer's, country house,
Vomersby."</p>

<p>My lord could not repress an exclamation and Sir Joseph
continued with a kind of unction people display when retailing a
hideous, startling piece of news.</p>

<p>"Yes, that girl who was missing four or five weeks ago, Martha
Carnaby from Sussex; they found her downstairs buried in the
cellar next the kitchen."</p>

<p>"How? Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was that rogue Jeremiah Hartslib gave him away, they
quarrelled over money. It was only discovered this afternoon. The
young rogue was already in London, on his way to the Continent,
no doubt, which partly brought the runners after him."</p>

<p>My lord was thinking: "Now I know what I could not understand,
why Brabazon Aylmer left her alone last night, he must have been
in a mortal terror." And then he thought, "No saving her
reputation now&mdash;one or both will speak."</p>

<p>But Sir Joseph's next words came as an enormous relief to
these hideous apprehensions. He said:</p>

<p>"When Brabazon Aylmer was arrested he shot the
informer&mdash;and upon my soul I can't blame him&mdash;and then
turned the weapon on himself. Both dead, sir, and the country
cheated of a bit of fun at the Assizes."</p>

<p>That evening Miss came down to supper very trim and neat in
one of Lady Charlotte's frilled muslins. She seemed very happy
and comfortable and the name of Brabazon Aylmer was not
mentioned. That was a sordid sensation they hoped to keep from
the ears of the young Miss. Only before she left to go to her
uncle's town house, my lord took the occasion to draw her aside
and ask:</p>

<p>"One word on a matter of which I will never speak again. I can
understand why you ran away with him, my dear, for he was a gay
and plausible rogue; but what made you leave him? What put it
into your head to run away from him so suddenly?"</p>

<p>Miss reflected. She was anxious to please this new-found
lover. She clung to him in a touching desire to be honest; she
paused as if turning over in her mind: What had it been? Because
he wanted her to go to the mausoleum, his dislike for her to use
his pleasure-house, his refusal for her to go into the kitchen,
his appearance in the morning like a man who had been sick, his
disdain of her shame and terror over the scene of the man
striking the woman, the remark she had heard in the
tavern&mdash;(There goes a plain little thing!). And yet,
trifles, all of them. Miss could not speak of all this, it was
too subtle, too slight. She answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, sir, I could never tell. Just straws, you
know, which show the way the wind blows."</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a> THE AVENGING OF ANN LEETE</h2>

<h3>PORTRAIT OF A LADY WITH A ROMAN SCARF&mdash;1845</h3>

<p class="first">
THIS is a queer story, the more queer for the interpretation
of passions of strong human heat that have been put upon it, and
for glimpses of other motives and doings, not, it would seem,
human at all.</p>

<p>The whole thing is seen vaguely, brokenly, a snatch here and
there; one tells the tale, strangely another exclaims amaze, a
third points out a scene, a fourth has a dim memory of a
circumstance, a nine-days' (or less) wonder, an old print helps,
the name on a mural tablet in a deserted church pinches the heart
with a sense of confirmation, and so you have your story. When
all is said it remains a queer tale.</p>

<p>It is seventy years odd ago, so dating back from this present
year of 1845 you come to nearly midway in the last century when
conditions were vastly different from what they are now.</p>

<p>The scene is in Glasgow, and there are three points from which
we start, all leading us to the heart of our tale.</p>

<p>The first is the portrait of a woman that hangs in the parlor
of a respectable banker. He believes it to be the likeness of
some connection of his wife's, dead this many a year, but he does
not know much about it. Some while ago it was discovered in a
lumber-room, and he keeps it for the pallid beauty of the canvas,
which is much faded and rubbed.</p>

<p>Since, as a young man, I first had the privilege of my Worthy
friend's acquaintance, I have always felt a strange interest in
this picture; and, in that peculiar way that the imagination will
seize on trifles, I was always fascinated by the dress of the
lady. This is of dark-green very fine silk, an uncommon color to
use in a portrait, and, perhaps, in a lady's dress. It is very
plain, with a little scarf of a striped Roman pattern, and her
hair is drawn up over a pillow in the antique mode. Her face is
expressionless, yet strange, the upper lip very thin, the lower
very full, the light brown eyes set under brows that slant. I
cannot tell why this picture was always to me full of such a
great attraction, but I used to think of it a vast deal, and
often to note, secretly, that never had I chanced to meet in real
life, or in any other painting, a lady in a dark-green silk
dress.</p>

<p>In the corner of the canvas is a little device, put in a
diamond, as a gentlewoman might bear arms, yet with no
pretensions to heraldry, just three little birds, the topmost
with a flower in its beak.</p>

<p>It was not so long ago that I came upon the second clue that
leads into the story, and that was a mural tablet in an old
church near the Rutherglen Road, a church that has lately fallen
into disrepute or neglect, for it was deserted and impoverished.
But I was assured that a generation ago it had been a most famous
place of worship, fashionable and well frequented by the better
sort.</p>

<p>The mural tablet was to one "Ann Leete," and there was just
the date (seventy-odd years old) given with what seemed a
sinister brevity. And underneath the lettering, lightly cut on
the time-stained marble, was the same device as that on the
portrait of the lady in the green silk dress.</p>

<p>I was curious enough to make enquiries, but no one seemed to
know anything of, or wished to talk about, Ann Leete.</p>

<p>It was all so long ago, I was told, and there was no one now
in the parish of the name of Leete.</p>

<p>And all who had been acquainted with the family of Leete
seemed to be dead or gone away. The parish register (my curiosity
went so far as an inspection of this) yielded me no more
information than the mural tablet.</p>

<p>I spoke to my friend the banker, and he said he thought that
his wife had had some cousins by the name of Leete, and that
there was some tale of a scandal or great misfortune attached to
them which was the reason of a sort of ban on their name so that
it had never been mentioned.</p>

<p>When I told him I thought the portrait of the lady in the
dark-green silk might picture a certain Ann Leete he appeared
uneasy and even desirous of having the likeness removed, which
roused in me the suspicion that he knew something of the name,
and that not pleasant. But it seemed to me indelicate and perhaps
useless to question him. It was a year or so after this incident
that my business, which was that of silversmith and jeweller, put
into my hands a third clue. One of my apprentices came to me with
a rare piece of work which had been left at the shop for
repair.</p>

<p>It was a thin medal of the purest gold, on which was set in
fresh-water pearls, rubies and cairngorms the device of the three
birds, the plumage being most skilfully wrought in the bright
jewels and the flower held by the topmost creature accurately
designed in pearls.</p>

<p>It was one of these pearls that was missing, and I had some
difficulty in matching its soft lustre.</p>

<p>An elderly lady called for the ornament, the same person who
had left it. I saw her myself, and ventured to admire and praise
the workmanship of the medal.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "it was worked by a very famous jeweller, my
great-uncle, and he has a peculiar regard for it&mdash;indeed I
believe it has never before been out of his possession, but he
was so greatly grieved by the loss of the pearl that he would not
rest until I offered to take it to be repaired. He is, you will
understand," she added, with a smile, "a very old man. He must
have made that jewellery&mdash;why&mdash;seventy-odd years
ago."</p>

<p>Seventy-odd years ago&mdash;that would bring one back to the
date on the tablet to Ann Leete, to the period of the
portrait.</p>

<p>"I have seen this device before," I remarked, "on the likeness
of a lady and on the mural inscription in memory of a certain Ann
Leete." Again this name appeared to make an unpleasant
impression.</p>

<p>My customer took her packet hastily.</p>

<p>"It is associated with something dreadful," she said quickly.
"We do not speak of it&mdash;a very old story. I did not know
anyone had heard of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I certainly have not," I assured her. "I came to Glasgow not
so long ago, as apprentice to this business of my uncle's which
now I own."</p>

<p>"But you have seen a portrait?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, in the house of a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"This is queer. We did not know that any existed. Yet my
great-uncle does speak of one&mdash;in a green silk dress."</p>

<p>"In a green silk dress," I confirmed.</p>

<p>The lady appeared amazed.</p>

<p>"But it is better to let the matter rest," she decided. "My
relative, you will realize, is very old&mdash;nearly, sir, a
hundred years old, and his wits wander and he tells queer tales.
It was all very strange and horrible, but one cannot tell how
much my old uncle dreams."</p>

<p>"I should not think to disturb him," I replied.</p>

<p>But my customer hesitated.</p>

<p>"If you know of this portrait&mdash;perhaps he should be told;
he laments after it so much, and we have always believed it an
hallucination&mdash;"</p>

<p>She returned the packet containing the medal.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she added dubiously, "you are interested enough to
take this back to my relative yourself and judge what you shall
or shall not tell him?"</p>

<p>I eagerly accepted the offer, and the lady gave me the name
and residence of the old man who, although possessed of
considerable means, had lived for the past fifty years in the
greatest seclusion in that lonely part of the town beyond the
Rutherglen Road and near to the Green, the once pretty and
fashionable resort for youth and pleasure, but now a deserted and
desolate region. Here, on the first opportunity, I took my way,
and found myself well out into the country, nearly at the river,
before I reached the lonely mansion of Eneas Bretton, as the
ancient jeweller was called.</p>

<p>A ferocious dog troubled my entrance in the dark overgrown
garden where the black glossy laurels and bays strangled the few
flowers, and a grim woman, in an old-fashioned mutch or cap, at
length answered my repeated peals at the rusty chain bell.</p>

<p>It was not without considerable trouble that I was admitted
into the presence of Mr. Bretton, and only, I think, by the
display of the jewel and the refusal to give it into any hands
but those of its owner.</p>

<p>The ancient jeweller was seated on a southern terrace that
received the faint and fitful rays of the September sun. He was
wrapped in shawls that disguised his natural form, and a fur and
leather cap was fastened under his chin.</p>

<p>I had the impression that he had been a fine man, of a
vigorous and handsome appearance; even now, in the extreme of
decay, he showed a certain grandeur of line and carriage, a
certain majestic power in his personality. Though extremely
feeble, I did not take him to be imbecile nor greatly wanting in
his faculties.</p>

<p>He received me courteously, though obviously ill-used to
strangers.</p>

<p>I had, he said, a claim on him as a fellow-craftsman, and he
was good enough to commend the fashion in which I had repaired
his medal.</p>

<p>This, as soon as he had unwrapped, he fastened to a fine gold
chain he drew from his breast, and slipped inside his heavy
clothing. "A pretty trinket," I said, "and of an unusual
design."</p>

<p>"I fashioned it myself," he answered, "over seventy years ago.
The year before, sir, she died."</p>

<p>"Ann Leete?" I ventured.</p>

<p>The ancient man was not in the least surprised at the use of
this name.</p>

<p>"It is a long time since I heard those words with any but my
inner ear," he murmured; "to be sure, I grow very old. You'll not
remember Ann Leete?" he added wistfully.</p>

<p>"I take it she died before I was born," I answered.</p>

<p>He peered at me.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, you are still a young man, though your hair is
grey." I noticed now that he wore a small tartan scarf inside his
coat and shawl: this fact gave me a peculiar, almost unpleasant
shudder. "I know this about Ann Leete&mdash;she had a dark-green
silk dress. And a Roman or tartan scarf."</p>

<p>He touched the wisp of bright-colored silk across his chest.
"That is it. She had her likeness taken so&mdash;but it was
lost."</p>

<p>"It is preserved," I answered. "And I know where it is. I
might, if you desired, bring you to a sight of it."</p>

<p>He turned his grand old face to me with a civil inclination of
his massive head.</p>

<p>"That would be very courteous of you, sir, and a pleasure to
me. You must not think," he added with dignity, "that the lady
has forsaken me or that I do not often see her. Indeed, she comes
to me more frequently than before. But it would delight me to
have the painting of her to console the hours of her
absence."</p>

<p>I reflected what his relative had said about the weakness of
his wits, and recalled his great age, which one was apt to forget
in face of his composure and reasonableness.</p>

<p>He appeared now to doze and to take no further notice of my
presence, so I left him.</p>

<p>He had a strange look of lifelessness as he slumbered there in
the faintest rays of the cloudy autumn sun.</p>

<p>I reflected how lightly the spirit must dwell in this ancient
frame, how easily it must take flight into the past, how soon
into eternity. It did not cost me much persuasion to induce my
friend, the banker, to lend me the portrait of Ann Leete,
particularly as the canvas had been again sent up to the
attics.</p>

<p>"Do you know the story?" I asked him.</p>

<p>He replied that he had heard something; that the case had made
a great stir at the time; that it was all very confused and
amazing, and that he did not desire to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>I hired a carriage and took the canvas to the house of Eneas
Bretton.</p>

<p>He was again on the terrace, enjoying with a sort of calm
eagerness the last warmth of the failing sun.</p>

<p>His two servants brought in the picture and placed it on a
chair at his side.</p>

<p>He gazed at the painted face with the greatest serenity.</p>

<p>"That is she," he said, "but I am glad to think that she looks
happier now, sir. She still wears that dark-green silk. I never
see her in any other garment."</p>

<p>"A beautiful woman," I remarked quietly, not wishing to
agitate or disturb his reflections, which were clearly detached
from any considerations of time and space.</p>

<p>"I have always thought so," he answered gently, "but I, sir,
have peculiar faculties. I saw her, and see her still as a
spirit. I loved her as a spirit. Yet our bodily union was
necessary for our complete happiness. And in that my darling and
I were balked."</p>

<p>"By death?" I suggested, for I knew that the word had no
terrors for him.</p>

<p>"By death," he agreed, "who will soon be forced to unite us
again."</p>

<p>"But not in the body," I said.</p>

<p>"How, sir, do you know that?" he smiled. "We have but finite
minds. I think we have but little conception of the marvellous
future."</p>

<p>"Tell me," I urged, "how you lost Ann Leete."</p>

<p>His dim, heavy-lidded, many-wrinkled eyes flickered a glance
over me.</p>

<p>"She was murdered," he said.</p>

<p>I could not forbear a shudder.</p>

<p>"That fragile girl!" I exclaimed. My blood had always run cool
and thin, and I detested deeds of violence; my even mind could
not grasp the idea of the murder of women save as a monstrous
enormity. I looked at the portrait, and it seemed to me that I
had always known that it was the likeness of a creature
doomed.</p>

<p>"Seventy years ago and more," continued Eneas Bretton, "since
when she has wandered lonely betwixt time and eternity, waiting
for me. But very soon I shall join her, and then, sir, we shall
go where there is no recollection of the evil things of this
earth."</p>

<p>By degrees he told me the story, not in any clear sequence,
nor at any one time, nor without intervals of sleep and pauses of
dreaming, nor without assistance from his servants and his
great-niece and her husband, who were his frequent visitors.</p>

<p>Yet it was from his own lips and when we were alone together
that I learned all that was really vital in the tale.</p>

<p>He required very frequent attendance; although all human
passion was at the utmost ebb with him, he had, he said, a kind
of regard for me in that I had brought him his lady's portrait,
and he told me things of which he had never spoken to any human
being before. I say human on purpose because of his intense
belief that he was, and always had been, in communication with
powers not of this earth. In these words I put together his
tale.</p>

<p>As a young man, said Eneas Bretton, I was healthy, prosperous
and happy.</p>

<p>My family had been goldsmiths as long as there was any record
of their existence, and I was an enthusiast in this craft, grave,
withal, and studious, over-fond of books and meditation. I do not
know how or when I first met Ann Leete.</p>

<p>To me she was always there like the sun; I think I have known
her all my life, but perhaps my memory fails.</p>

<p>Her father was a lawyer and she an only child, and though her
social station was considered superior to mine, I had far more in
the way of worldly goods, so there was no earthly obstacle to our
union.</p>

<p>The powers of evil, however, fought against us; I had feared
this from the first, as our happiness was the complete circle
ever hateful to fiends and devils who try to break the mystic
symbol.</p>

<p>The mistress of my soul attracted the lustful attention of a
young doctor, Rob Patterson, who had a certain false charm of
person, not real comeliness, but a trick of color, of carriage
and a fine taste in clothes.</p>

<p>His admiration was whetted by her coldness and his intense
dislike of me.</p>

<p>We came to scenes in which he derided me as no gentleman, but
a beggarly tradesman, and I scorned him as an idle voluptuary
designing a woman's min for the crude pleasure of the
gratification of fleeting passions.</p>

<p>For the fellow made not even any pretence of being able to
support a wife, and was of that rake-helly temperament that made
an open mock of matrimony.</p>

<p>Although he was but a medical student, he was of what they
call noble birth, and his family, though decayed, possessed
considerable social power, so that his bold pursuit of Ann Leete
and his insolent flaunting of me had some licence, the more so
that he did not lack tact and address in his manner and
conduct.</p>

<p>Our marriage could have stopped this persecution, or given the
right to publicly resent it, but my darling would not leave her
father, who was of a melancholy and querulous disposition.</p>

<p>It was shortly before her twenty-first birthday, for which I
had made her the jewel I now wear (the device being the crest of
her mother's family and one for which she had a great affection),
that her father died suddenly. His last thoughts were of her, for
he had this very picture painted for her birthday gift. Finding
herself thus unprotected and her affairs in some confusion, she
declared her intention of retiring to some distant relative in
the Highlands until decorum permitted of our marriage.</p>

<p>And upon my opposing myself to this scheme of separation and
delay she was pleased to fall out with me, declaring that I was
as importunate as Dr. Patterson, and that I, as well as he,
should be kept in ignorance of her retreat.</p>

<p>I had, however, great hopes of inducing her to change this
resolution, and, it being then fair spring weather, engaged her
to walk with me on the Green, beyond the city, to discuss our
future. I was an orphan like herself, and we had now no common
meeting-place suitable to her reputation and my respect.</p>

<p>By reason of a pressure of work, to which by temperament and
training I was ever attentive, I was a few moments late at the
tryst on the Green, which I found, as usual, empty; but it was a
lovely afternoon of May, very still and serene, like the smile of
satisfied love. I paced about, looking for my darling.</p>

<p>Although she was in mourning, she had promised me to wear the
dark-green silk I so admired under her black cloak, and I looked
for this color among the brighter greens of the trees and bushes.
She did not appear, and my heart was chilled with the fear that
she was offended with me and therefore would not come, and an
even deeper dread that she might, in vexation, have fled to her
unknown retreat.</p>

<p>This thought was sending me hot-foot to seek her at her house,
when I saw Rob Patterson coming across the close-shaven grass of
the Green.</p>

<p>I remembered that the cheerful sun seemed to me to be at this
moment darkened, not by any natural clouds or mists, but as it is
during an eclipse, and that the fresh trees and innocent flowers
took on a ghastly and withered look.</p>

<p>It may appear a trivial detail, but I recall so clearly his
habit, which was of a luxury beyond his means&mdash;fine grey
broadcloth with a deep edging of embroidery in gold thread,
little suited to his profession.</p>

<p>As he saw me he cocked his hat over his eyes, but took no
other notice of my appearance, and I turned away, not being
wishful of any encounter with this gentleman while my spirit was
in a tumult.</p>

<p>I went at once to my darling's house, and learnt from her maid
that she had left home two hours previously.</p>

<p>I do not wish to dwell on this part of my tale&mdash;indeed, I
could not, it becomes very confused to me.</p>

<p>The salient facts are these&mdash;that no one saw Ann Leete in
bodily form again.</p>

<p>And no one could account for her disappearance; yet no great
comment was aroused by this, because there was no one to take
much interest in her, and it was commonly believed that she had
disappeared from the importunity of her lovers, the more so as
Rob Patterson swore that the day of her disappearance he had had
an interview with her in which she had avowed her intention of
going where no one could discover her. This, in a fashion, was
confirmed by what she had told me, and I was the more inclined to
believe it, as my inner senses told me that she was not dead.</p>

<p>Six months of bitter search, of sad uneasiness, that remain in
my memory blurred to one pain, and then, one autumn evening, as I
came home late and dispirited, I saw her before me in the
gloaming, tripping up the street, wearing her dark-green silk
dress and tartan or Roman scarf.</p>

<p>I did not see her face as she disappeared before I could gain
on her, but she held to her side one hand, and between the long
fingers I saw the haft of a surgeon's knife.</p>

<p>I knew then that she was dead.</p>

<p>And I knew that Rob Patterson had killed her.</p>

<p>Although it was well known that my family were all
ghost-seers, to speak in this case was to be laughed at and
reprimanded.</p>

<p>I had no single shred of evidence against Dr. Patterson.</p>

<p>But I resolved that I would use what powers I possessed to
make him disclose his crime.</p>

<p>And this is how it befell.</p>

<p>In those days, in Glasgow, it was compulsory to attend some
place of worship on the Sabbath, the observation of the holy day
being enforced with peculiar strictness, and none being allowed
to show themselves in any public place during the hours of the
church services, and to this end inspectors and overseers were
employed to patrol the streets on a Sabbath and take down the
names of those who might be found loitering there.</p>

<p>But few were the defaulters, Glasgow on a Sunday being as bare
as the Arabian desert.</p>

<p>Rob Patterson and I both attended the church in Rutherglen
Road, towards the Green and the river.</p>

<p>And the Sunday after I had seen the phantom of Ann Leete, I
changed my usual place and seated myself behind this young man.
My intention was to so work on his spirit as to cause him to make
public confession of his crime. And I crouched there behind him
with a concentration of hate and fury, forcing my will on his
during the whole of the long service.</p>

<p>I noticed he was pale, and that he glanced several times
behind him, but he did not change his place or open his lips; but
presently his head fell forward on his arms as if he was praying,
and I took him to be in a kind of swoon brought on by the
resistance of his spirit against mine.</p>

<p>I did not for this cease to pursue him. I was, indeed, as if
in an exaltation, and I thought my soul had his soul by the
throat, somewhere above our heads, and was shouting out:
"Confess! Confess!"</p>

<p>One o'clock struck and he rose with the rest of the
congregation, but in a dazed kind of fashion. It was almost side
by side that we issued from the church door.</p>

<p>As the stream of people came into the street they were stopped
by a little procession that came down the road.</p>

<p>All immediately recognized two of the inspectors employed to
search the Sunday streets for defaulters from church attendance,
followed by several citizens who appeared to have left their
homes in haste and confusion.</p>

<p>These people carried between them a rude bundle which some
compassionate hand had covered with a white linen cloth. Below
this fell a swathe of dark-green silk and the end of a Roman
scarf. I stepped up to the rough bier.</p>

<p>"You have found Ann Leete," I said.</p>

<p>"It is a dead woman," one answered me. "We know not her
name."</p>

<p>I did not need to raise the cloth. The congregation was
gathering round us, amongst them was Rob Patterson.</p>

<p>"Tell me, who was her promised husband, how you found her," I
said.</p>

<p>And one of the inspectors answered:</p>

<p>"Near here, on the Green, where the wall bounds the grass, we
saw, just now, the young surgeon, Rob Patterson, lying on the
sward, and put his name in our books, besides approaching him to
enquire the reason of his absence from church. But he, without
excuse for his offence, rose from the ground, exclaiming: 'I am a
miserable man! Look in the water!'</p>

<p>"With that he crossed a stile that leads to the river and
disappeared, and we, going down to the water, found the dead
woman, deep tangled between the willows and the weeds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And," added the other inspector gravely, "tangled in her
clothes is a surgeon's knife."</p>

<p>"Which," said the former speaker, "perhaps Dr. Patterson can
explain, since I perceive he is among this congregation&mdash;he
must have found some quick way round to have got here before
us."</p>

<p>Upon this all eyes turned on the surgeon, but more with amaze
than reproach.</p>

<p>And he, with a confident air, said:</p>

<p>"It is known to all these good people that I have been in the
church the whole of the morning, especially to Eneas Bretton, who
sat behind me, and, I dare swear, never took his eyes from me
during the whole of the service."</p>

<p>"Ay, your <i>body</i> was there," I said.</p>

<p>With that he laughed angrily, and mingling with the crowd
passed on his way.</p>

<p>You may believe there was a great stir; the theory put abroad
was that Ann Leete had been kept a prisoner in a solitary, mined
hut there was by the river, and then, fury or fear, slain by her
jailer and cast into the river.</p>

<p>To me all this is black. I only know that she was murdered by
Rob Patterson.</p>

<p>He was arrested and tried on the circuit.</p>

<p>He there proved, beyond all cavil, that he had been in the
church from the beginning of the service to the end of it; his
alibi was perfect. But the two inspectors never wavered in their
tale of seeing him on the Green, of his self-accusation in his
exclamation; he was very well known to them; and they showed his
name written in their books.</p>

<p>He was acquitted by the tribunal of man, but a higher power
condemned him.</p>

<p>Shortly after he died by his own hand, which God armed and
turned against him.</p>

<p>This mystery, as it was called, was never solved to the public
satisfaction, but I know that I sent Rob Patterson's soul out of
his body to betray his guilt, and to procure my darling Christian
burial.</p>

<p><br> This was the tale Eneas Bretton, that ancient man, told
me, on the old terrace, as he sat opposite the picture of Ann
Leete.</p>

<p>"You must think what you will," he concluded. "They will tell
you that the shock unsettled my wits, or even that I was always
crazed. As they would tell you that I dream when I say that I see
Ann Leete now, and babble when I talk of my happiness with her
for fifty years."</p>

<p>He smiled faintly; a deeper glory than that of the autumn
sunshine seemed to rest on him.</p>

<p>"Explain it yourself, sir. What was it those inspectors saw on
the Green?"</p>

<p>He slightly raised himself in his chair and peered over my
shoulder.</p>

<p>"And what is this," he asked triumphantly, in the voice of a
young man, "coming towards us now?"</p>

<p>I rose; I looked over my shoulder.</p>

<p>Through the gloom I saw a dark-green silk gown, a woman's
form, a pale hand beckoning.</p>

<p>My impulse was to fly from the spot, but a happy sigh from my
companion reproved my cowardice. I looked at the ancient man
whose whole figure appeared lapped in warm light, and as the
apparition of the woman moved into this glow, which seemed too
glorious for the fading sunshine, I heard his last breath flow
from his body with a glad cry. I had not answered his questions;
I never can.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a> HELIOTROPE</h2>

<h3>A RECIPE FROM GRANDFTHER'S DAY BOOK&mdash;1860</h3>

<p class="first">
ALTHOUGH the night was so cold Alicia had a whiff of the
perfume of heliotrope as she opened the window. Just beneath her,
in the dark, under the snow was the spot that every year was
planted with heliotrope, and had been ever since she was born in
the little house&mdash;and before that, she believed.</p>

<p>But never before had she experienced this delusion of the
perfume of the frail flower in winter.</p>

<p>She did not know what had made her open the window this stormy
weather; she had risen out of bed suddenly, half dreaming, with
the impression that someone was calling her, that someone was
wanting, insistently, to be admitted.</p>

<p>But she had gone, not to the door, but to the window, and all
she had admitted was this ghost of a perfume.</p>

<p>She pulled down the window with a snap, but the odour of
heliotrope had entered her small homely bedchamber; it was
unmistakably in the room, a definite presence.</p>

<p>Alicia crept into bed, fully awake now and thrilled with
excitement.</p>

<p>The patch of heliotrope beneath her window was connected with
the only romance that had ever coloured her quiet, pleasant,
monotonous life, and this was a romance of sixty years ago that
she had only heard in scraps, half as legend, half as truth, and
altogether as something to be hushed up.</p>

<p>Alicia shivered down under the warm blankets, yet the perfume
was so strong, so strong. Why, never in summer when she had been
standing over the flowers in full bloom had she felt the sweet,
dusty scent so poignantly.</p>

<p>In the morning she would tell Mary; but Mary would not
believe; Mary was so fond of saying things were "nonsense," and
had always been for neglecting the bed of heliotrope
altogether.</p>

<p>"Why should we have those expensive hot-house flowers every
year?" she had said often enough. "Marigolds would make a better
show at half the price."</p>

<p>But Alicia, though by far the weaker of the two sisters, had
always insisted on the heliotrope and tended it every year with
meticulous care.</p>

<p>It was because of her grandfather that the heliotrope had
first been planted there; he had been a dandy, a foreigner with a
title, a being altogether fantastic even to Alicia and to Mary
quite incredible.</p>

<p>Seventy years ago he had come to this little house in this
little English town and married the daughter of the doctor, and
then gone away, and after that the story was confused and rather
dreadful, like an evil dream.</p>

<p>For it was whispered that the marriage was no marriage at all,
and the foreigner never came back, and their child Mary, the
mother of Alicia and Mary, took her mother's name until her
marriage, when the whole story was hushed over and forgotten.</p>

<p>The old doctor had left the little house to his grandchild
Mary whose husband inherited his practice, so three generations
of women of the one family had lived there&mdash;Alicia who
married the foreigner dandy but never left her father's house,
Mary her daughter who married her grandfather's assistant, and
their children, also named Alicia and Mary, now for some years
orphaned, who had inherited the house, a nice little income, and
the bed of heliotrope.</p>

<p>The first heliotrope had been planted for their foreign
grandfather; he used that scent, the whisper went, and she, the
first Alicia, had worn a gown of that artificial hue, book muslin
with many tiny frills, when they had first met.</p>

<p>Alicia the second often dwelt lovingly and secretly on this
romance; she had early sensed that it was something she must not
speak about, that there was even a shade of shame or disgrace
attached to it, and there were no relics of the foreigner with
which to feed her imagination (though the little house held much
that had belonged to Alicia the first) but this could not prevent
her hoarded interest in the fragmentary story.</p>

<p>"Your father has a castle and estates and a title, and some
day you may inherit them," Alicia the first had whispered to her
daughter, "but always keep the heliotrope growing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is some sad old story attached, poor mother would never
explain," this Mary had whispered in turn to her daughter, "but
keep the heliotrope, for mother's sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>And now there was the perfume of heliotrope in winter, near
Christmas-time, permeating the cold dark.</p>

<p>Alicia counted over the sparse facts of the ancient story and
tried to picture what this man was like and why he had gone away
and where all the trouble was.</p>

<p>The perfume grew fainter, receded and appeared to die away in
a gentle whisper of air that was like a human sigh.</p>

<p>In the morning, over the comfortable breakfast table, Alicia
attacked Mary with a boldness that surprised herself.</p>

<p>"Mary, do you know anything at all about grandfather? We are
middle-aged women now, and I don't think these things should be
made such a mystery of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mary, "why should you think I know more than
you do? And what," she added comfortably, "is the use of raking
over these old tales?&mdash;I know you and your heliotrope." She
smiled. "You're a sentimentalist!"</p>

<p>Mary looked so shrewd and practical, albeit so kind and cosy,
with her round face and glittering glasses and her nice grey hair
waved back from her chubby cheeks, that Alicia decided not to
tell her of the delusion of perfume in the night.</p>

<p>Besides, in the firelit room, with the snow drifting heavily
against the pane, the whole thing did seem, even to Alicia, just
a dream.</p>

<p>"I'm only curious," she answered. "It is a little strange to
think one had a foreign grandfather; one may be like him for all
one knows."</p>

<p>"I dare say you are," assented Mary placidly; and certainly
Alicia, thin, dark and plain, with a very distinguished air quite
unwarranted by her attainments and position, was not the ordinary
English country type; "but he was a bad man, and I don't see the
need of bothering about him."</p>

<p>"That sounds so old-fashioned, calling him 'bad,'" protested
Alicia, "just because he ran away from grandmother."</p>

<p>"It was worse than that."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>do</i> know something about it!"</p>

<p>"A little. Father went over to see him when I was a
girl&mdash;thirty years ago, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Why wasn't I told?"</p>

<p>"You were a child, Alicia, and it all came to nothing and we
didn't talk about it. You know father was always a quiet sort of
man; he only went to please mother."</p>

<p>"Do tell me&mdash;it was Belgium, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;grandmother knew all about him, but of course it
was all hushed up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, no one knew if they were married or not."</p>

<p>"Were they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," smiled Mary. "It doesn't matter now."</p>

<p>"But couldn't it be proved?"</p>

<p>"No, that was the trouble. You see it was all a long time ago
when it was easier to muddle these things up. Grandmother went to
a boarding school at Clapham and he saw her walking on the
Common&mdash;he had come to London on some diplomatic
mission&mdash;and when she came home he followed her&mdash;and
they ran away."</p>

<p>"And presently she came back and said she was married and a
Countess and I don't know what not. I think her parents didn't
believe a word of it and kept it all hushed up&mdash;then the
baby was born and they called grandfather to account a bit, and
he admitted the marriage, but there was some difficulty, because
of his people, about proclaiming it&mdash;the old excuse, of
course; anyhow, there was the baby, and I suppose they had to
make the best of it, and things were patched up and he stayed
here and spent money on them all, then went away again."</p>

<p>"You know all about it," said Alicia enviously.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm ten years older than you, and always more
practical," replied Mary.</p>

<p>"Mother told me about the heliotrope."</p>

<p>"That was more in your line," said the elder sister. "<i>I</i>
should never have kept that up&mdash;Well, great-grandfather
died, and the old Count died, and then grandmother began to try
to push her claims&mdash;this time she was repudiated altogether,
and her husband, as she always called him, married a woman of his
own rank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then there wasn't a marriage at all!" exclaimed Alicia.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the man was a bigamist," smiled Mary. "You never
know, do you? Grandmother tried to prove the marriage, of course,
but the clergyman was dead, she couldn't trace the witnesses, and
there was no entry in the registry. Of course, it wouldn't have
been so difficult for a man with money and position to have
bribed away the witnesses and tampered with the registry."</p>

<p>"It sounds rather fantastic," said Alicia, not because she
thought so, but to please Mary.</p>

<p>"I suppose a lot of these sort of things used to happen,"
conceded Mary. "Of course I should never have believed a word of
it, but father really did go out and see the old man&mdash;he was
old then, thirty years ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's dead now, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he died soon after father's visit; a dreadful old
person he was too."</p>

<p>Alicia drew her chair nearer the fire.</p>

<p>"I do think I should have been told," she complained.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, dear, you were always the baby to us, and then
when you grew up I really think we forgot all about it&mdash;and
I never guessed you were interested, <i>except</i> in pleasing
mother by planting the heliotrope every year&mdash;" Mary paused
suddenly, and asked:</p>

<p>"Why did you suddenly want to know about it?"</p>

<p>Alicia positively coloured.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was just a dream I had," she said foolishly.</p>

<p>"A dream of grandfather! After all these years! Well, Alicia,
this <i>is</i> strange," remarked Mary, with her rather
irritating placidity, and then she was silent and reached for her
knitting because the robust maid had come in to clear the
breakfast things away, and Alicia had to wait; she stared down at
a little hard footstool in Berlin wool cross-stitch, made by
Alicia the first, two large red roses tied with blue ribbon on a
black ground; it was an ugly thing and really seemed as if it
would last for ever; Alicia wondered if her grandmother had made
it before or after she had discovered that her lover was a
faithless rogue&mdash;one would hardly have the patience for such
labour after such a blow, surely!</p>

<p>"Father," Mary continued, as the door finally shut, "was very
impressed by the château; it was all fine and stately, he said,
not what he had expected. You know how sceptical one is about
these foreign Counts and Barons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There really was a title?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Baron Londerzeel it was, and he was quite a personage.
Well, father saw him, and asked him to clear up the mystery, and
he would neither say no nor yes; all he would admit
was&mdash;'the truth is known only to myself, and anyone else
must find it for themselves.'"</p>

<p>"Whatever did he mean by that?"</p>

<p>"The old wretch hated his wife, the Baroness, you see, and he
just held that over her head, that there may have been a former
marriage which would make her disgraced and ridiculous and
disinherit her son&mdash;in front of her he told father that
there was a certain little box&mdash;a long olive-wood box lined
with tortoiseshell&mdash;in which he had put all the truth
concerning his affair with grandmamma, and this box he had hidden
somewhere in the castle."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Just to keep his wife hunting for it, of course&mdash;'If
there <i>is</i> a marriage certificate it is in that box,' he
said, 'and if Madame here finds it, she can destroy it; if anyone
else finds it no doubt they will sell it to you.' Of course,
father told him what he thought of him and came home."</p>

<p>"I suppose there <i>wasn't</i> such a certificate?" suggested
Alicia timidly.</p>

<p>"Not very likely. Nor such a box. Father thought he was a
little touched. Anyhow we had no money to fight the case."</p>

<p>"I suppose we should be the heirs if it had been a proper
marriage?"</p>

<p>"Of course. And wealthy people. A couple of Belgian
baronesses, Alicia."</p>

<p>"I should," remarked the younger sister, "have <i>liked</i>
it."</p>

<p>"My dear!" Mary's laugh was hearty. "You seem to be taking the
whole thing seriously! The old man was just torturing his wife,
and she, father said, was a terror, too. Fancy, he had his
portrait painted holding this box with 'Mon secret' on the lid,
and she was to keep it in her bedroom always, under pain of
losing all he left her."</p>

<p>"What happened to her?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know. I believe she is still alive&mdash;her son
and grandson died, I know, but she still lives shut up in Château
Londerzeel, I believe, about a hundred, hunting for that
certificate!"</p>

<p>And Mary's hearty laugh rang out again as if what she had
related was really very comical.</p>

<p>But Alicia said nothing.</p>

<p>This story impressed her differently from the way it had
impressed either her father or Mary, people of good sound robust
common sense and no nerves or imagination, the type that miss
such a great deal in life.</p>

<p>To Alicia the whole thing was rather awful; she almost wished
that she had not heard the tale&mdash;told by Mary, to whom it
never seemed to occur that, marriage or no marriage, this old man
was their own kin.</p>

<p>Of course, as Mary had so definitely stated, he was an old
wretch and an old monster; but then he certainly had not always
been old, and perhaps not always a wretch and a monster. There
certainly must have been something attractive about him or
grandmamma would not have been so loyal to him, as she had been
to the last.</p>

<p>"Some day he will put it all right." That was her constant
saying, handed down secretly to Alicia the second.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Mary after a pause, when she had given
her whole attention to a difficult passage in her knitting, "I
think, though it was never very clearly stated to me, that
grandfather made us very comfortable&mdash;there was always
plenty of money after his coming, and you know we are really much
better off than we should have been out of father's savings."</p>

<p>"He bought the family off, I suppose," said Alicia,
disgusted.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't put it like that," answered Mary. "I should say
that whatever he did it was only his duty, and of course I don't
know for certain, but I think there was a good sum of money
invested for grandmamma."</p>

<p>"It is all rather queer," sighed Alicia. "I wish it had all
been cleared up&mdash;<i>I</i> wouldn't have taken money to keep
quiet."</p>

<p>"We were always careful, prudent people," smiled Mary, "and
never the kind to make a sensation when things could be arranged
comfortably and quietly. We were very poor, you know, and no
lawyer would have taken the case; why, it would have looked
almost like blackmail!"</p>

<p>Alicia was silent again, oppressed by resentment; it was so
stupid of Mary to have kept quiet about this so long!</p>

<p>Why, they had even taken two little holidays in Belgium and
there had never been any suggestion that they should go and see
even the outside of grandfather's castle; she had ventured to
suggest this, and Mary had said that it was right off the beaten
track, hardly safe travelling for two women alone.</p>

<p>Overcome by the remembrance of this grievance she spoke at
length:</p>

<p>"I think we ought to have gone to Londerzeel when we were in
Belgium."</p>

<p>"To be thrown out by the old Baroness?" asked Mary. Alicia
gave her a queer look.</p>

<p>"I can't understand that you don't want to see the place,
Mary."</p>

<p>"What is the use? I've got a picture of it if you would like
that."</p>

<p>And Mary rose and unlocked the drawer in the tiny desk at her
elbow where she kept the housekeeping accounts, and took out a
little book and an old cheap lithograph.</p>

<p>Alicia gazed at this eagerly; it showed a castle on a rock,
surrounded by trees with a winding river in the valley at the
bottom, and in the distance a sunny landscape.</p>

<p>A flag waved above the topmost turret, and over the handsome
entrance a coat of arms was indicated.</p>

<p>The place had a sombre and romantic look, far removed from
reality.</p>

<p>"It was before the days of photographs," said Mary, "but
father bought this&mdash;and here he wrote down all that passed
at his interview with grandfather, with the dates and
everything."</p>

<p>Alicia was staring at the print.</p>

<p>"Fancy that old woman still living there searching for that
box! However old must she be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; she was very much younger than her husband, but
I expect she is old enough&mdash;as for the box, of course, she
has forgotten <i>that</i> long ago!"</p>

<p>And Mary hurried away, after a guilty glance at the clock, for
she was a very busy person with her housekeeping and her
charities.</p>

<p>But Alicia never had very much to do; she painted a little,
sang a little, read a great deal, and was rather dreamy and
idle.</p>

<p>She had never really meant to stay so long in the tiny house
in the tiny town, but she lacked energy and concentration; first
she had stayed because father would miss her, then because mother
couldn't be left, and now that both these excuses were in the
tranquil churchyard because Mary made one so comfortable.</p>

<p>She read through the notes made by her father on the occasion
of his visit to Londerzeel; the prosaic, conscientious man had
put nothing down but dry facts and the dryer comment that he
considered the old Baron "an unpleasant Iunatic."</p>

<p>Alicia sighed, put away the note-book and the print and went
upstairs and took out of a small bookcase on the top landing one
of a row of disused books; a small guide to Belgium.</p>

<p>She had read over, often enough, the short paragraph devoted
to the historic château of Londerzeel, but now she looked at the
map and compared distances, measuring off the scale with the edge
of her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Why, Londerzeel wasn't so far from Brussels after all! Only a
little off the main line.</p>

<p>She played with the thought that it would be quite easy to get
there.</p>

<p>And there was no reason at all why she shouldn't
go&mdash;except that she was afraid of Mary; that was the worst
of being weak and timid, you were always doing what other people
liked, not what you really wanted to.</p>

<p>All that day Alicia, employed in dressing dolls for the
church-room festival, was absent and melancholy.</p>

<p>Mary, of course, with so much on her hands for Christmas,
never said anything more about grandfather and certainly had
quite forgotten him; indeed, any sensible person would have
agreed that there was no use in remembering him; but Alicia
simply couldn't help herself.</p>

<p>She felt an extraordinary and quite unwarrantable sympathy
with this relative she had never seen, as if, supposing they had
met, they would quite well have understood each other.</p>

<p>"I am sure," thought Alicia, "that he would have done
something for me, that he always wanted to do something for me. I
dare say I <i>am</i> like him, as I'm so different from the
others."</p>

<p>She took the print of Londerzeel up to her room and put it
away among her few treasures.</p>

<p>And that night again in the cold and dark she smelt the
heliotrope.</p>

<p>Yes, wide-eyed, sitting up in bed, Alicia smelt the perfume
without any possibility of a mistake.</p>

<p>The room was full of it; without even the opening of the
window it had surrounded her, poignant, pungent, faintly sweet
with the curious dusty odour.</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it?" asked Alicia, as if she addressed a
ghost.</p>

<p>And indeed, what was it but a ghost, the ghost of a
perfume?</p>

<p>Alicia held herself expectant for a second, as if she really
hoped for an answer, and, when the scent receded, she went to the
window and opened it despite her shivering, and stared into the
blank, bleak blackness.</p>

<p>How foolish Mary would find her behaviour I This was even more
fantastic than a dream; Mary would begin to think, if she knew of
these two incidents, that grandfather Londerzeel had really been
insane and that Alicia had inherited this insanity.</p>

<p>Of course it was all a delusion; Alicia applied the soporific
of this useful word to herself without knowing what it meant or
considering what is delusion and what is not.</p>

<p>She returned to bed and lay awake and excited thinking of the
Château Londerzeel as she had seen it in the lithograph.</p>

<p>She thought of the story of the box with the possible marriage
certificate hidden somewhere in that romantic old castle, and it
seemed to her unfair that she should not have been allowed to
look for it also.</p>

<p>It was not right that the sole chance of this discovery should
have been given to the old Baroness; why, supposing there
<i>really had been</i> such a paper and this woman had found it,
of course she would have destroyed it, and she, Mary and herself,
would have been defrauded of their rights.</p>

<p>Alicia became restless at the thought.</p>

<p>Timid and irresolute as she was she longed to face the ancient
chatelaine of Londerzeel and demand from her an account of her
search.</p>

<p>"She is so old now, I think that she would be frightened and
tell me."</p>

<p>To Alicia, tired and agitated after a bad night, came
salvation in the shape of a letter which lay on the modest pile
by her breakfast plate.</p>

<p>An invitation from Minnie Towers to "spend Christmas" with
her...At first Alicia was for at once refusing; but it occurred
to her, with startling force, that the Towers lived near the
coast; how easy to pretend to go there and really to slip over to
Belgium!</p>

<p>Alicia, flushed with the sense of adventure, entered on the
first deceit of her life.</p>

<p>She wrote to Minnie, declining the invitation, and she told
Mary that she was accepting. The news was taken with placid good
humour, for Mary liked Alicia to have what she called "a change"
as often as possible, and was herself so much in request at
Christmas that she would never feel lonely.</p>

<p>Alicia packed a small valise, drew a comfortable sum of money
out of the local bank, took a ticket for the village where Minnie
Towers Lived, and when she reached that station, got out and
changed into another train that took her to Dover.</p>

<p>From there she wrote an abject letter of excuses to Mary, but
not before she had her ticket for Brussels in her pocket.</p>

<p>To go abroad alone was in itself a thrill for Alicia Gates.
All her former little trips had been carefully shepherded by
Mary, and now she felt not only forlorn but rather foolish.</p>

<p>There were very few people on the boat, and the Belgian coast
looked dun and sombre rising from the dark stillness of the
winter sea; it was cold, windless and threatening snow.</p>

<p>When Alicia found herself in the train for Brussels, she felt
extremely depressed.</p>

<p>And worse than depressed, silly.</p>

<p>Nothing is more irritating and difficult than justifying some
unaccountable impulse of the dark to one's sane daylight
self&mdash;especially when one has acted on such an impulse!</p>

<p>Alicia, reviewing her action, saw it as merely childish.</p>

<p>To come to Belgium, in the winter, alone, just on the chance
of a peep at grandfather Londerzeel's castle!</p>

<p>How impossible that would be to explain; Mary would think she
was quite irresponsible, and then the waste of money and the
deception about Minnie Towers!</p>

<p>And worst of all the pleasant time missed; it was nearly
Christmas, and there were all sorts of friendly, comfortable
things happening at home that as a rule Alicia thoroughly
enjoyed; and instead of being at home, or the guest of the Towers
in their nice, wealthy establishment where everything was done
with such good will and so much money, she was in this stuffy
foreign train going on a really crazy errand.</p>

<p>Well, there was just time to get back before Christmas Day;
she would buy Mary a handsome present in Brussels and go straight
home.</p>

<p>When she reached this point in her reflections Alicia felt
easier in her mind and settled herself more comfortably in her
seat.</p>

<p>And, as she changed her position, she was aware of someone
standing in the corridor outside the open door of her
compartment.</p>

<p>Alicia felt the little fearful thrill of the lonely
inexperienced female in discovering that this was a man and that
he was looking at her intently.</p>

<p>Then this stupid awkwardness vanished when she saw the
friendly way in which the stranger regarded her; he wore an
uncommon kind of light cloak thrown over his shoulder and a stiff
military cap; an officer in full equipment, evidently.</p>

<p>"Can I assist you?" he asked in good English, and, saluting,
came into the carriage.</p>

<p>His appearance was very attractive, and Alicia felt pleased
that he had noticed her and spoken to her with such kindness and
respect.</p>

<p>"That is very nice of you," she said, blushing a little, and
on a quick nervous impulse she took him into her confidence.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to find a little place called Londerzeel; I don't
know quite how to get there. I suppose you have never heard
ofit?"</p>

<p>The young man had now seated himself opposite to Alicia; his
cloak had fallen back from the silver clasps and she saw his
uniform, very fantastic and ornate, with gold cords and two rows
of medals; it was obvious that he came from some important
function.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know Londerzeel quite well," he answered, "and I can
tell you how to get there."</p>

<p>"I was going to Brussels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must not go to Brussels at all. I will show you where you
change; it is quite near and you might be there late
to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think that would be very convenient," explained
Alicia, "as I don't know where to stay&mdash;and I've engaged a
room in Brussels in the hotel where my sister and I stayed
before."</p>

<p>"But isn't the Baroness expecting you?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Whatever should make you think so? Do you know
the Baroness?" asked Alicia, startled.</p>

<p>"Yes, very will indeed. I often visit the Château Londerzeel,
and I understood that she was expecting an English lady&mdash;for
some time."</p>

<p>"It is not I," said Alicia, "and I certainly don't wish to
call on the Baroness&mdash;"</p>

<p>She felt a curious flutter of trepidation at getting so nearly
in touch with the object of her journey, and she looked eagerly
at the young man whose profile was now towards her as he gazed
out into the corridor of the train.</p>

<p>His face was familiar, but she could not tell if she had ever
actually seen it before; he had rather an effeminate appearance,
his features were small and his complexion had a fine polished
look, unusual in a man.</p>

<p>"The name of the lady the Baroness expects is Miss Alicia
Gates," he said, and Alicia crouched in her seat with a sense of
shock, "and this is where we get out, please."</p>

<p>The train had stopped, and the young man handed Alicia out on
to a cold, bleak platform ill lit.</p>

<p>"My valise is left behind," murmured Alicia, but her companion
did not seem to hear.</p>

<p>"I think you must make haste to the Château Londerzeel," he
said, "as the Baroness cannot wait much longer."</p>

<p>It was snowing; Alicia felt the big soft flakes falling
against her face in the darkness and she was speedily almost
numbed by cold; a porter asked her for her ticket, and when she
produced it told her that it was for Brussels and muttered after
her when she pushed past him, which she did in a sudden nervous
fright, for she had lost sight of her companion.</p>

<p>Just outside the station, under the light of the solitary
lamp, she saw him again.</p>

<p>But with him was a carriage and pair; the lamps on the front
cast uncertain rays into the snow and the horses were walking up
and down impatiently.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," said the officer, opening the brougham
door. "Madame has sent for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alicia could see a coat of arms on the gleaming varnish of the
panel, the same coat that she had seen on the gateway of
Londerzeel in the old lithograph.</p>

<p>"Please step in," he insisted.</p>

<p>Alicia obeyed; she was bewildered and eager to get out of the
pelt of the snow and the bite of the winter air.</p>

<p>"It begins to snow," added the young man, "but you will get
there before the storm is impossible&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alicia looked out of the window; the yellow light of the
carriage candles cast a blurr round his figure, giving it a rim
or glow of illumination against the darkness, like an uncertain
halo.</p>

<p>He pulled out his handkerchief and pressed the scrap of linen
to his mouth with an affected gesture. To Alicia's nostrils came
a whiff of heliotrope.</p>

<p>"Why," she quivered, "you use heliotrope perfume&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then she checked herself. It was likely enough a favourite
perfume in this country, or in any country, for all she knew; men
who used perfume at all had never come the way of Alicia.</p>

<p>The officer saluted and slightly bowed; Alicia saw his face
for a second clearly outlined with what seemed an unnatural
lucidity.</p>

<p>And she thought:</p>

<p>"That is a wicked face&mdash;or the face of someone who could
do wicked things."</p>

<p>The carriage moved on briskly, and Alicia, drowsy in her
corner, was casting over, in broken reasonings, in her mind how
it was that the Baroness Londerzeel could possibly be expecting
her. Had she for years lived in terror of a visit from her
husband's grandchild set on claiming her rights?</p>

<p>That was an added misery to the dreadful life of the recluse
shut up with her fanatic search for the olive-wood box, but then,
how could she have known that Alicia would come tonight, been
sure enough to send the carriage?</p>

<p>And who was the young man who knew it all so well&mdash;this
queer old story?</p>

<p>The carriage stopped and the door was opened; Alicia saw a
flight of steps and an imposing doorway faintly lit by a massive
lamp; the groom had rung the iron chain bell and the door was
quickly opened. Alicia shivered up the steps.</p>

<p>"Are you the English lady Madame la Baronne expects?" asked
the pale manservant.</p>

<p>"I'm Alicia Gates&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is the name. Madame has expected you for years, the
carriage has been sent to meet Mademoiselle every time the
English train came through Londerzeel." The man was looking at
Alicia with respectful curiosity, as if amazed that the expected
visitor had really come at last.</p>

<p>"You really are Miss Alicia Gates?" he asked again, as she
followed him down the long tapestried hall.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. But I never told the Baroness I was
coming&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is strange," commented the manservant. He paused outside a
great door solidly carved with trophies. "The Brussels express
doesn't stop at Londerzeel."</p>

<p>"But you say that your mistress has always expected me by this
train?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but Madame la Baronne has, for years,
been&mdash;peculiar."</p>

<p>He uttered the last word in a low, meaning tone, as if he
meant it as a warning, and opened the big door, announcing: "Miss
Alicia Gates, Madame la Baronne."</p>

<p>Alicia entered.</p>

<p>The room was very splendid; the sinking firelight glowed on
painted ceiling, tapestried walls, rich screens and heavy dark
furniture, and the figure of an old woman in a green velvet
hooded chair.</p>

<p>She was dressed in dove-coloured brocade and folds of thick
yellow lace, and her frail cap of blonde glittered evilly with
diamonds.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come to-night, Alicia," she said, "that is
why I asked them to stop the express&mdash;a visitor to
Londerzeel, I said, at last."</p>

<p>Her voice whistled from her toothless mouth, and she turned on
Alicia such blank eyes so filmed by age that it seemed impossible
that she could see.</p>

<p>"Now which Alicia is it, after all?" she added, and her voice
took on a whining note. "I suppose he sent you here?"</p>

<p>Alicia supposed she referred to the young officer and found
some command of herself.</p>

<p>"There was a young officer on the train who told me the way
and helped me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, that was <i>he</i>&mdash;he has been here a great deal
lately. Now, come close, child."</p>

<p>Alicia crept up to the hooded chair from which the Baroness
poked her trembling head.</p>

<p>"You are too late, Alicia Gates. I've <i>found</i> it&mdash;it
has taken me forty years, but I've found it!"</p>

<p>Excitement passed like a flame between them.</p>

<p>"The certificate!" whispered Alicia, "there was a
certificate!"</p>

<p>"There was, and other papers proving his first
marriage&mdash;the <i>sale bête</i>, but I've found them, and
you've come too late except to see me burn them&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Alicia saw that her crooked fingers did clutch a roll of
ancient papers.</p>

<p>"He always lied and cheated and tricked," she continued
fiercely. "You never could tell when he was fooling you&mdash;but
I've got them. I've got them!"</p>

<p>Alicia stood rigid; as if by magic, indeed, <i>by magic</i>,
she was almost in possession of the coveted treasure. She looked
at the wretched old woman and thought that she herself was really
Baroness Londerzeel and owner of this house and everything in it;
she controlled herself to guile.</p>

<p>"Of course you must destroy the papers as you have found them,
mustn't you&mdash;that was the bargain, wasn't it? And I have
come just in time to see you burn them, which I am sure will make
it more pleasant for you."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course." The old woman nodded and grimaced. "It
is some days since I found them, but I've been keeping them for
your coming&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How was it that you were so sure of my coming?" asked
Alicia.</p>

<p>A look of cunning passed over the senile face that was not
without indications of once having been graceful and noble.</p>

<p>"There were his last words to me&mdash;he was continually
saying them, and these were his last words&mdash;'Victorine, one
of these days one of my English grandchildren will come here for
their inheritance&mdash;watch'&mdash;and I've been
watching&mdash;ever since, watching and searching, for forty
years."</p>

<p>She spoke faintly, almost indifferently, and the hand that
clutched the papers shook violently.</p>

<p>Alicia watched these papers; a great greed possessed her,
something within her that had laid dormant all her life was now
dominant; she was no longer timid, or shy, or hesitant; she drew
in her lips and her eyes glittered over the rich appointments of
the handsome room.</p>

<p>The Baroness seemed to see or sense this glance, for she
murmured:</p>

<p>"Ah, there isn't a corner I haven't searched, not a stone I
haven't had out&mdash;not a picture or an ornament that hasn't
been moved. I've been shut up here, doing nothing else, for forty
years."</p>

<p>"The whole of my life," thought Alicia, "and I've been
conscious of it all that time, that is what has been the matter
with me. I've known that this was going on, and I've wanted to
join in."</p>

<p>She saw, on a corner table, a pencil drawing in an ivory
frame, a likeness of the young officer she had met in the
train.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" she asked quickly, "the likeness&mdash;the only
likeness in the room?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is the next Londerzeel, my great-nephew," grinned
the old lady. "He very much resembles my husband and he uses
heliotrope perfume."</p>

<p>"Does he know that you have been expecting me?"</p>

<p>"He knows all about everything, of course. He is always round
here, he is watching and waiting, too, of course&mdash;for me to
die before his creditors get him."</p>

<p>"He isn't the heir now," said Alicia; and she knew, fearfully,
that the young man would come up to the castle to-night, was
probably in the castle now, watching, waiting, as all three had
watched and waited so long; and she wanted to get the papers and
be away quickly, before he found her; yes, even wildly away into
the snow and cold.</p>

<p>"Where did you find the papers?" she asked, her voice flat
with excitement. "You can tell me that just to prove to me how
clever you are."</p>

<p>The ancient Baroness unexpectedly rose, with a creeping
movement, out of the hooded chair, and leaning on a stick hobbled
across the room, trailing with difficulty her grotesque brocades.
She passed behind a gilt screen, and Alicia followed her,
desperately swift; before them was a door.</p>

<p>"Open it," said the Baroness.</p>

<p>Alicia obeyed and they stepped into a sleeping apartment,
where a few lights lit in the crystal candelabra cast gleams from
the lustres and showed the splendour of the beautiful room.</p>

<p>Above the bed was a sweeping drapery of purple satin, fluted
into a gilt coronet of Empire design, and in the embrasure made
by this curtain hung a portrait which appeared to Alicia to be
that of the young man whom she had met in the train, but which
she knew to be that of grandfather Londerzeel.</p>

<p>Yes, it was very like the officer who had sat opposite to her
in the swaying carriage and wore the same uniform and medals,
only looked older and infinitely more wicked. This was, Alicia
thought, really a dreadful face, mean, crafty, treacherous,
despite the smooth effeminate good looks&mdash;and the dashing,
showy equipment of such fashion-plate glossy correctness.</p>

<p>The picture was mutilated.</p>

<p>Part of the right hand and an oblong of canvas near had been
cut away, revealing a dark hole.</p>

<p>The old woman came to the bed and stood blinking up, with her
filmed, blank eyes, at this picture.</p>

<p>"That is where the old rogue had hidden them&mdash;in the
picture itself&mdash;liar and cheat! there in the
picture&mdash;the painted box with 'Mon secret' was a real box, a
false back to the picture, you see, so I've had it over my head
all these years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you found it at last," said Alicia, trembling.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought of it at last. I had the picture taken
down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was cleverly done," whispered Alicia.</p>

<p>"Yes. He was clever&mdash;but I'm clever too&mdash;and now I'm
going to burn the certificate&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alicia's hand came down strongly on the trembling wrist.</p>

<p>"No, you're not&mdash;you're going to give them to
me&mdash;they are mine, you know, really mine."</p>

<p>An expression of terror overspread the old woman's face; she
struggled, and Alicia's free hand grasped her by the shoulder and
shook her to and fro gently, so that they swayed together.</p>

<p>"Give them up&mdash;give them up&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a horrible wrestle lasting a second, then the
Baroness slipped to the bedstep and groaned; Alicia knew that she
was dead and did not care; she drew the papers from the twitching
fingers and spread them out.</p>

<p>Two were blank; the third contained a recipe for making
heliotrope perfume.</p>

<p>Someone laughed; Alicia thought it was grandfather Londerzeel;
then she thought that it was the sound of grinding brakes. She
sat up, stiff, cold, frightened, bewildered as the train drew
into the murk of Brussels station.</p>

<p>Afterwards when she confessed to Mary that practical woman
remarked:</p>

<p>"Fancy going all that way to have a nightmare!"</p>

<p>Then, humouring her sister's silliness and disappointment, she
added: "But there may be something in it, of course. I've had a
recipe for heliotrope perfume for years&mdash;among those old
papers in the attic, and it was always supposed to come from
grandfather's day-book&mdash;"</p>

comedy, it is suggested that the Curtain goes up showing a black
backcloth, with the complete characters posed as an old portrait
of a stiff family group, 1840. The whole effect should be formal
and severe, relieved by the colouring of the costumes. The
strains of "Home, Sweet Home" played from the front as the
Curtain goes up and descends slowly. The Curtain to ascend again
as quickly as possible on to the Comedy proper. (See also end of
Play.)</i></p>

<p class="first">PERIOD.&mdash;1840.</p>

<hr>

<p class="first">
SCENE.&mdash;<i>A Parlour in MR. PORTER'S House in Islington.
Early morning. Spring. Window stage C. backing showing railings
and trees beyond: a door R. and a door up L.: a round mahogany
table with a wool mat and a group of wax fruit under a glass case
in the middle: down L. a fireplace with mirror above and screen
in front, a chair either side: above the door R. a heavy
sideboard: on walls some dark oil paintings.</i></p>

<p><i>(See ground plan of scene.)</i> </p>

<p><i>(MRS. PORTER is seated at L. of the table c. turning over
the pages of a large Bible with one hand and holding a
handkerchief to her eyes with the other: she is a comely woman of
not much more than 40, but her lace matron's cap, her dark dress,
cashmere shawl, braided hair, etc., make her appear twenty years
older. Site has been crying violently and is still sniffing: she
turns over the Book for consolation and reads between her
sobs.)</i> </p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. "The heart is deceitful and desperately wicked,
who shall know it?" True, how true! (<i>Wiping her eyes</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>MR. PORTER enters from the door R.&mdash;a big, vigorous
man of 45 or so, in precise morning attire. Agitation shows
beneath a manner which has been so correct for so many years as
to become mechanical, and emotion tinges but does not disturb a
lifelong air of undisturbed authority: he is whiskered, dominant,
prosperous and God-fearing.</i>)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>approaching R. of the table C.</i>). Tears, my
dear, tears? (MRS. PORTER <i>sobs louder</i>.) I hardly expected
this&mdash;I observed that Henry left the house just
now&mdash;violently. (<i>A short pause</i>: <i>MRS. PORTER buries
her face in her handkerchief</i>.) You have been harsh with
him.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>reproachfully</i>). <i>You</i> were harsh with
him, last night&mdash;harsh indeed!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. I exercised authority. I performed my duty. I
expressed pain, surprise, displeasure.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>the same</i>). And when I endeavoured to
restrain you, you begged me not to meddle with matters beyond the
judgment of a female!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Precisely. And you have disobeyed me, Clara. I
have thought the matter over and have decided to forgive
Henry&mdash;but when I look for the lad I find him driven from
the house by your unwomanly reproaches.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>aghast</i>). John! Unwomanly! Please
listen&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. PORTER (<i>interrupting</i>). I refuse to listen.
(<i>Walking up C. and down again.</i>) I feared this, you are
always so unreasonable, Clara, last night you took his part, this
morning you must open up the affair again.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Open it up! Henry came to me&mdash;</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>interrupting</i>). Of course, for consolation,
for motherly tenderness, for feminine sympathy&mdash;he was
agitated, naturally.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Yes, by <i>your</i> reproaches, John; after all,
if you may express your feelings, I suppose I may?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Certainly not. I am surprised, Clara, surprised.
This is not the first time I have looked for sweetness, kindness,
smiling patience in you. And failed to find it, Clara, failed to
find it.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>rising</i>). Please listen&mdash;</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>with dignity</i>). No. I have refused to
listen.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>angrily</i>). You usually do. Indeed I cannot
remember when you have listened to me, except when I was saying
something wholly agreeable to you.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Ah! Accusing me of injustice, I suppose?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. <i>And</i> unreasonableness. Last night you were
for turning Henry out of the house.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>inflamed</i>). Do you call that unreasonable?
When a man of my principles finds his only son has been drinking,
gambling, and engaging in a clandestine love affair.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>with dignity</i>). I beg of you, John,
<i>not</i> to use these coarse expressions before me. Henry had
<i>only</i> had two glasses of port and lost fifteen shillings at
dominoes.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>angrily</i>). And secretly betrothed himself to
his tailor's daughter&mdash;that's nothing, I suppose?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. You see, you are losing your temper again about
it&mdash;and yet I was not to say a word. Henry is my child, too.
(<i>With handkerchief to her eyes</i>.) <i>I</i> have <i>my</i>
feelings, I suppose.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>trying to control himself</i>). It was
<i>my</i> affair. Father and son. Perhaps I went a little too far
last night. I don't pretend to be perfect.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>weeping</i>). How can you say that! You always
have!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>still trying to control himself</i>). Not at
all. I try to be reasonable. The boy did wrong, I&mdash;there was
a regrettable scene, but he confessed. I've thought it over. I
intend clemency, Clara, clemency. After all, I can recall my own
youth.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>looking up from handkerchief</i>). Oh, John!
And I've always held you up as such an example to the
children.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>exasperated</i>). So I am, so I am&mdash;it is
quite impossible to discuss these things with a female. That is
what I complain of, Clara&mdash;your interference.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Interference! With my own children! The Bible
says&mdash;(<i>Majestically laying her hand on the Book</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>losing control and turning away</i>). The Bible
is for Sunday&mdash;it's not real life.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>aghast</i>). John! Oh!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>returning to table</i>). Well, not
<i>English</i> life&mdash;you're continually telling me things
out of the Bible to put me in the wrong, but there is a good deal
there you wouldn't care for me to act on.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>sobbing</i>). If you are going to
blaspheme&mdash;what do you know of the Book? You always sleep in
church&mdash;except for the hymns.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Exactly. A day of rest. I wish <i>you</i> slept in
church, Clara, instead of listening to all you hear there and
bringing it on into the week, which it was never meant for.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>still sobbing</i>). Look where your
inattention has brought you&mdash;if you hadn't slept through so
many sermons you would not be behaving so <i>disgracefully</i>
now.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. You exasperate, Clara&mdash;you'll drive me out of
the house as well as poor Henry. ("<i>The Turkish Patrol" is
heard on the piano from the next room</i>.) Isn't it very early
for Maria to begin her practice?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>still half-weeping</i>). It is not. It is
<i>you</i> who are late. Is it possible you are not going to the
office?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. It is. I am not. I remained at home to settle this
unfortunate business with Henry&mdash;if you would have had the
goodness to mind your affairs, my dear, all would have been
amiably settled by now.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>bridling</i>). Indeed. And how, pray? Do you
mean after what you said last night, you were going to overlook
Henry's conduct?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>pompously</i>). I do. The boy is a good
boy&mdash;he took a glass or two last night merely to give
himself courage to face me.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. He needed it&mdash;your display of
temper&mdash;</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>in his most pompous manner</i>). Clara, be
silent. I say I had decided to tell Henry he was
forgiven&mdash;even to inform him that Miss Speed&mdash;I confess
I was shocked, but, on reflection&mdash;</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. After what you said about clandestine love
affairs!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Let us be calm. The boy told me. He confessed very
candidly.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>with tearful pride</i>). I always trained him
to be truthful.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>sharply</i>). A pity you didn't train him to be
temperate and prudent.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. There! You say something different every time you
speak.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. You don't expect me to say the same thing over and
over again, Clara? You confuse me, you positively confuse me.
(<i>With an effort</i>.) Speed is in a fair way of business, my
own father was a clothier.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Yes, remind me, Mr. Porter, of your obvious lack
of gentility which I for twenty-five years of marriage have tried
to forget.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. And what do you suppose <i>I</i> have tried to
forget? But you shan't provoke me. Sarah Speed is a modest,
pleasant girl any woman might be proud of&mdash;("<i>The Turkish
Patrol" thumps more loudly</i>.) Need Maria continually play that
piece?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Continually, Mr. Porter, continually. She is to
perform it at Miss Magnet's Academy on the fifteenth.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. But I want to keep my head clear&mdash;I can't
think while that&mdash;er&mdash;music&mdash;is going on. Pray,
Clara, tell the child to cease.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>hysterically</i>). No, indeed. I may be an
unnatural mother, I may have turned my only son out of the house,
I may be unwomanly&mdash;but I will <i>not</i> interrupt Maria's
education because you have no ear for harmony!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. So you exult in your atrocious conduct&mdash;you
did turn the boy out of the house&mdash;</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>not heeding</i>). As if I hadn't noticed how
you leave the room when I bring out my harp&mdash;you've no soul,
no sentiment.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>shouting</i>, as <i>"The Turkish Patrol"
stumbles along again</i>). Are you to tell her to stop, or shall
I?</p>

<p>(MRS. PORTER <i>sails to door up L. and opens it. Music
louder</i>.)</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>with false calm</i>). Maria! Mar&mdash;ia!</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>off, falsetto</i>). Yes, Mamma!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>with acid sweetness</i>). Maria, my dear,
please cease your practice, it disturbs your dear papa.</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>off</i>). Certainly, dear Mamma!</p>

<p>(<i>The music ceases</i>.)</p>

<p>(MRS. PORTER <i>closes door and returns to table, C</i>. MR.
PORTER <i>has made a brave effort to compose himself</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>pompously</i>). If I have been hasty I regret
it, as I hope, Clara, <i>you</i> regret your hastiness with
Henry. From a woman, a mother, one expects a melting tenderness,
a soft sympathy, an&mdash;er&mdash;an exquisite sensibility.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>grimly</i>). Qualities I trust I have never
failed in, John.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>dryly</i>). On the contrary, your lack of them,
Clara, has led to the present distressing scene.</p>

<p>(<i>The door R. opens and MISS EMILY PORTER puts in her
head</i>.) EMILY. Did I hear voices?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>further annoyed at her appearance</i>). I hope,
Emily, in <i>my</i> house you will never hear voices. (<i>Moving
up c</i>.)</p>

<p>(EMILY <i>enters. She is older than her brother and really as
redoubtable, but her sex and the period are against her: even
with these handicaps she holds her own. The cut of her features
is in contradiction to the heavy decorum of her sombre attire. As
she advances, MRS. PORTER, who has collapsed at L. of table
again, makes an instant attempt to gain her as an ally</i>.)</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>sobbing, with handkerchief at eyes</i>).
Emily, you did hear one voice, that of your brother&mdash;raised
against me!</p>

<p>(EMILY <i>sweeps across to L. of MRS. PORTER and puts her arm
round her, while she glares at</i> MR. PORTER.)</p>

<p>EMILY. John! A recurrence of the scene of last night! Have you
no consideration for a mother's heart?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>moving down R. again</i>). A mother's heart!
Don't talk nonsense&mdash;Clara has turned the boy out, abused
him, reproached him, exulted in it, flown in my face, defied
me.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>rising</i>). Am I to endure this?</p>

<p>EMILY. Certainly not&mdash;control yourself, John.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>raging</i>). Am I master here, or not? Is Henry
my son or not? Am I capable of conducting my own affairs or
not?</p>

<p>(<i>Door up L. opens and MARIA, a lanky girl of 12, puts her
head in</i>. EMILY <i>sees her</i>.)</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>dramatically</i>). John! (<i>Pointing</i>.) The
child. (Rebuked, MR. PORTER <i>subsides into desperate
silence</i>.)</p>

<p>MARIA. Papa, may I play "The Turkish Patrol," now?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Certainly not.</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>coming to the top of table c. and whimpering</i>).
But, Papa, Miss Magnet said&mdash;</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>exploding</i>). Miss Magnet be&mdash;</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>rising hastily</i>). Retire, my child. Dear
Papa is not very well.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>holding himself in once more</i>). Emily, this
is between Clara and me&mdash;I will not endure any interference.
I must decide about Henry, I must impress on Clara&mdash;</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>with rising hysteria</i>). Yes, indeed, I am
to count for nothing&mdash;I, the mistress of his home and the
mother of his children.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>more fiercely</i>). Will you allow me to
speak?</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>enjoying herself</i>). Pray compose yourself,
John&mdash;this temper is most unbecoming. (<i>Moving to the
fireplace</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Emily, I have been endeavouring to compose myself
for the last half-hour. Pray let us all calm ourselves. Emily, I
have decided to overlook Henry's conduct&mdash;Sarah Speed is not
such an ill choice.</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>turning, horrified</i>). After what you said last
night!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>triumphantly</i>). Just so. Now the girl is
praised up&mdash;put before my own daughters, yes, indeed, Emily,
your brother taunted me with that. (<i>As</i> MR. PORTER <i>makes
an effort to break in</i>.) I <i>will</i> speak! You have abused
me, John, accused me of unnatural conduct, told me my girls were
a discredit to me, blasphemed the Book&mdash;(<i>Tapping
it</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>breaking in</i>). Lies&mdash;lies!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. You hear, Emily, you hear!</p>

<p>EMILY. I certainly do. (<i>To her brother</i>.) Clara had
every right to reprove Henry and say what she thought of the
Speed miss&mdash;entangling the poor boy.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. She did not! She said she would not receive his
addresses without <i>my</i> consent!</p>

<p>EMILY. So <i>Henry</i> says.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. So I suppose the boy's a liar, too!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. <i>You</i> said he was last night when he tried
to say his breath smelt of camomile tea!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>waving his hands</i>). This is paltry,
positively paltry. (<i>Swelling with indignation as he returns to
C.</i>) I will not be dictated to, I have been too complacent,
too tender, too sensitive, with the result that I am not able to
open my mouth in my own house.</p>

<p>EMILY. Fiddlesticks. I know what Clara has had to put up
with.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>clinging</i> to her). Dear Emily&mdash;</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>disgusted</i>). Very affectionate, Mrs. Porter,
very affectionate! I didn't hear so much of dear Emily when you
missed the cherry brandy!</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>pushing off</i> MRS. PORTER). Cherry brandy?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>weeping</i>). Who is being paltry now, Mr.
Porter? I never accused Emily.</p>

<p>EMILY. I should hope not, indeed! Cherry brandy! So that was
why you were measuring it off with a bit of string every
night.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Precisely. Her nose was as keen for cherry brandy
as mine for camomile tea.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. John!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. You told me you smelt it in her bedroom, and that
the maids were all above suspicion!</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>outraged</i>). I can believe it&mdash;I've long
known you've spied on me.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>responding with temper</i>). Well, miss, you
<i>have</i> got duplicate keys, not many women would allow
that.</p>

<p>EMILY. Why have I got duplicate keys, Mrs. Porter? Because you
are such an inefficient housekeeper&mdash;for twenty-five years
I've stood in the background, counteracting your incompetence and
extravagance.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. For twenty-five years I've endured your
interference, rudeness and uselessness, Miss Porter! (<i>Dabbing
her eyes</i>.) I've shared my home with you, knowing you would
never have one of your own&mdash;and <i>this</i> is my
reward.</p>

<p>EMILY. You've put on me all the work you didn't want to do
yourself&mdash;stop crying, do; you're as strong as a horse, for
all you spend half your time snoring on the sofy!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>dramatically</i>). Mr. Porter, will you stand
there and let your sister insult me?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>who has been watching the two women with
sardonic enjoyment</i>). I think you are quite able to take care
of yourself, Mrs. Porter. Emily has always made me very
comfortable.</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>turning on him</i>). Yes, that's what's the matter
with you, I've spoilt you. I ought to have left you to
Clara&mdash;that would have prevented you being so swelled up
with vainglory.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>majestically</i>). Do you forget you share my
home?</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>grimly</i>). Well, I suppose my two hundred a year
has helped, hasn't it?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>shocked</i>). How disgusting!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. What <i>are</i> we all saying to each other?</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>with relish</i>). I don't quite know, but I'm sure
it's something I've wanted to say for <i>years</i>.</p>

<p>(MARIA <i>puts her head in door L.</i>)</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>on a whining note</i>). Please, Papa, may I continue
with "The Turkish Patrol?"</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>roaring</i>). No! You may not!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>with a shudder</i>). Brute!</p>

<p>(MARIA PORTER <i>enters door L. and slams it behind her. Comes
down stage C. and bursts into tears, knuckling her eyes. The
three adults give suppressed exclamations of intense
irritation</i>.)</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>howling</i>). If I don't learn the piece I can't go
to Miss Magnet's party, and if I don't go to the party I can't
wear my new tarleton with the pretty cherry sash!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>moving up to window and down again, stifling
his fury</i>). <i>Your</i> daughter, Mrs. Porter, vain,
disobedient, uncontrolled!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>with false sweetness</i>). Dear Papa doesn't
like your pretty piece, dear Maria; dear Papa (<i>viciously</i>)
still doesn't feel quite well. (<i>Going up to</i> MARIA <i>and
caressing her</i>.) My darling girl must be patient.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>with suppressed fury</i>). Dear Papa himself
wants all the patience there is in this house. Clara, leave the
child. Maria, go to your room.</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>sobbing on her mother's shoulder</i>). If I
go&mdash;go&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;my room&mdash;may I practise
"The Turkish Patrol" on&mdash;a&mdash;comb?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>walking about furiously</i>). No! No! No!</p>

<p>EMILY. You spoil the child, Clara&mdash;she is far too young
for Miss Magnet's party&mdash;(<i>howls from</i> MARIA) and looks
hideous in the tarleton&mdash;(<i>louder howls from</i> MARIA.
EMILY <i>glares at her with intense dislike</i>)&mdash;with that
complexion&mdash;<i>book muslin</i>&mdash;with those
elbows&mdash;<i>sleeves</i>.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>hysterically</i>). Since when have you been an
authority on dress, Miss Porter? Is an old maid to dictate to me
how I shall dress my daughters?</p>

<p>(MARIA, <i>interested in this, stops howling to
listen</i>.)</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>moving down between them</i>). Is Aunt Emily an old
maid, dear Mamma?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>turning on her</i>). You naughty, rude girl,
how dare you interrupt?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>viciously</i>). Clara! Before the child!</p>

<p>(MRS. PORTER <i>pulls herself together: a forced calm descends
on them</i>. MARIA <i>sticks her finger in her mouth and looks
round from one grim face to another</i>.)</p>

<p>MARIA. If I can't play "The Turkish Patrol," may I say my
little poem?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>desperately flinging himself into the chair R.
of table</i>). Certainly, my dear, certainly. Pray let us hear
your little poem.</p>

<p>(MARIA <i>puts her arms by her side and begins to gabble
rapidly but distinctly</i>.)</p>

<p>MARIA.<br>
&emsp;The tiny ant works all the day,<br>
&emsp;The bee works all
&emsp;the night&mdash;<br>
&emsp;And if I'd be as good as they,<br>
&emsp;I must be different&mdash;quite.<br>
<br>
&emsp;I must not yawn or laze or stare<br>
&emsp;As naughty children do.<br>
&emsp;Refuse to brush and comb my hair,<br>
&emsp;And say what is not true.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>interrupting</i>). Who wrote that?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>scornfully</i>). I should have thought you
would have known John Milton when you heard him.</p>

<p>MARIA. Miss Magnet didn't give us John Milton. After all, dear
Mamma, she wrote that herself&mdash;she said we could work it in
cross-stitch, too.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>exasperated</i>). It's nonsense&mdash;about the
bee, anyhow. Where did the woman get her natural history from?
Bees don't work all night.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Of course they do&mdash;I've seen them.</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>scornfully</i>). You haven't, you've never left the
house after nine for years.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>grimly, ignoring the women</i>). Bees do
<i>not</i> work all night.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>weeping</i>). Then they ought to, it might
make honey cheaper.</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>spitefully</i>). If you were more careful with your
accounts you wouldn't have to worry so over the cost of wholesome
food.</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>piping up</i>). May I say the rest of my poem?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>sensing opposition</i>). Decorum, John,
decorum&mdash;before the child! (<i>She puts handkerchief to her
eyes and sinks into arm-chair above the fireplace L.</i>)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>calm, but fierce</i>). Proceed with your poem,
Maria.</p>

<p>MARIA (<i>gabbling</i>).<br>
&emsp;I'm very proud to think I am<br>
&emsp;A little English child.<br>
&emsp;I might have been a foreigner,<br>
&emsp;Or else a heathen wild.<br>
<br>
&emsp;But God was very good to me,<br>
&emsp;I thank His Gracious plan<br>
&emsp;Which set me in my loving home<br>
&emsp;And made papa&mdash;a Christian gentleman.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>mollified, smoothing his whiskers</i>). Very
well, my dear, very well. I dare say Miss Magnet has observed the
habits of bees more closely than I have.</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>sitting in the arm-chair below the fireplace, sotto
voce</i>). More closely than she has observed you, at least.</p>

<p>AIRS. PORTER. Now run away, Maria.</p>

<p>MARIA. There is a great deal of the poem, dear
Mamma&mdash;(<i>exclamations of horror from all</i>)&mdash;but I
don't know any more.</p>

<p>EMILY. Then run away and learn it, you lazy girl!</p>

<p>MARIA. Yes, dear Aunt Emily. (<i>Running to door up L.,
opening it, and then pausing and looking back.</i>) When I've
finished learning my little poem may I practise "The Turkish
Patrol?"</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>loudly</i>). Yes.</p>

<p>(MARIA <i>exits door L.</i>)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>angry</i>). Why is the child not at Miss
Magnet's?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Saturday is a holiday, you seem to forget
everything.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>to both of them</i>). You are sufficient to
make a man forget everything, but I won't be provoked, I am
determined not to be provoked&mdash;come here.</p>

<p>(EMILY <i>and</i> MRS. PORTER <i>rise and approach the table,
where he stands glaring</i>.)</p>

<p>The trouble with females is that one must treat them as human
beings&mdash;if they could be chained up, or locked up, or turned
out&mdash;like&mdash;like&mdash;cats&mdash;I'm sure we should get
on very well. But this attempt to use reason with creatures who
haven't got any&mdash;</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>acid</i>). I suppose you are founding your opinion
of women on Clara?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. On every female I have ever met.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>hysterical</i>). Kicked out! Kicked out!
Like&mdash;like&mdash;a cat!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. I did not say kicked.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>ignoring him</i>). Kicked! Such an indelicate
expression!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. As far as that goes you contrived to kick out
Henry.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. John! Kicked! How can a gentlewoman kick?</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>looking at her skirts</i>). I've often wondered. But
what a marvellous feeling it must be&mdash;a good kick! Ah! La!
(<i>She lifts her shirt and careering round gives a good hick at
the chair L. by fire</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>really shocked</i>). Emily! Emily!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>in hysterics</i>). She has gone mad! Oh dear!
Oh dear! She has gone mad! Mad!</p>

<p>EMILY. Not at all. I've wanted to do it for years. I loathe
that saddlebag suite&mdash;you brute! (<i>Kicking the chair
again</i>.)</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>hysterically</i>). Your wedding gift to us,
Emily!</p>

<p>EMILY. When I gave it to you I didn't know I was going to live
with you!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>acidly</i>). No, you hadn't resigned all hope
of making poor James Hopkins propose!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>shouting above the tumult</i>). Will you be
silent! I want to talk of Henry, of Henry, do you hear?
(<i>thumping table</i>) Henry!</p>

<p>(MRS. PORTER, <i>who is sitting in the chair L. of table,
screams in hysterics, and</i> EMILY <i>comes L. of her to
table</i>.)</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>severely</i>). I wonder you're not ashamed to talk
of Henry, you've driven him out of his home and broken his heart
between you&mdash;I shouldn't wonder if he isn't at the bottom of
Balls Pond by now.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>faintly</i>). My salts! My salts! My
heart&mdash;my palpitations. Oh, why didn't I die long ago!</p>

<p>EMILY. Because you took such good care to keep yourself alive.
I'll not fetch your salts&mdash;there is nothing the matter with
you but temper. (<i>Turning back to the fireplace</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>still shocked</i>). Emily! I've never heard you
talk like this before!</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>grimly</i>). There's a sense of independence in the
air. The spring, I suppose&mdash;don't you feel it, John?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>fiercely</i>). How dare you accuse me of
feeling the spring? I tell you I want a clear understanding about
Henry. I intend to give my consent to his marriage with Sarah
Speed.</p>

<p>EMILY. Indeed. Well, when <i>she</i> comes in I go out.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>sarcastically</i>). Partly why I shall welcome
her, Miss Porter. What have you against the girl?</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>folding her arms</i>). She is a&mdash;
(<i>Pause</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Emily!</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>defiantly</i>). A puss. Positively&mdash;a puss.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter, door down R.</i>, MISS MATILDA PORTER, <i>a rather
plain young woman of 22, in walking attire with a large
reticule</i>.)</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>slightly mincing</i>). Dear Mamma, Miss Bertha
positively cannot match the Berlin wool, neither the cerise, the
magenta, nor the salmon pink.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>sullenly</i>). There are a good many things in
this house unmatchable, Matilda. (<i>Moving up to the
window</i>.)</p>

<p>(MATILDA, <i>with a swimming motion, reaches table, opens
reticule and pours out samples of bright coloured wools, then,
glancing round, sees the stony attitude of</i> EMILY <i>and</i>
MR. PORTER <i>and the collapse of</i> MRS. PORTER.)</p>

<p>MATILDA. Dearest Mamma! Dearest Papa! Dearest Aunt Emily!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>faintly</i>). One of my attacks, dear child.
(MATILDA, <i>gliding to her mother and caressing her</i>.) Dear
Papa has been horrid.</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>turning reproachfully to her father</i>).
Papa!</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>rapidly</i>). Fiddlesticks. Every one has been
horrid. You'll be horrid yourself in a minute. Your mother says
I'm a thief, your father says she's driven Henry to suicide, they
both say I've lived on their charity, I say he's a bully and
she's a fool&mdash;and Henry is to marry the
Speed&mdash;puss.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>crossing down R.C., roaring</i>). Lies! Lies
(MATILDA <i>collapses on her mother and joins her in
hysterics</i>.) What have I done to be so tormented?</p>

<p>EMILY. Married Clara.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>with genuine surprise</i>). And we were all so
loving!</p>

<p>EMILY. Nonsense. We've been bickering for a quarter of a
century.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. But this is the first time we have ceased to be
civil.</p>

<p>EMILY. Isn't it a relief?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Not before Matilda, please.</p>

<p>EMILY. It will do Matilda good. Of course she knows all about
it. She heard all you said last night.</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>masking curiosity, recovering from her
hysterics</i>). Yes, please let me stay, I want to be a comfort
to you and dear Mamma, and a loyal sister to poor misguided
Henry&mdash;"Little deeds of kindness, little words of love."
(<i>Sobbing</i>.)</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>turning away</i>). Rubbish.</p>

<p>MATILDA. But you taught it me. Oh, dear, what has happened to
every one? (<i>Looking round at them all</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>pompously</i>). I fear it is a crisis, my dear
Matilda, a crisis&mdash;one word has followed another&mdash;</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>violently interrupting</i>). One word followed
another!</p>

<p>(MR. PORTER <i>tries to speak, but by sheer volubility she
silences him</i>.)</p>

<p>No, I'll not be silent! (<i>Majestically rising</i>.) Matilda,
your aunt has admitted to secret drinking, she has been smashing
up the furniture&mdash;your father says I have driven Henry to
suicide, and ought to be kicked&mdash;(MATILDA
<i>screams</i>)&mdash;yes, kicked out of the house, he has been
blasphemous (<i>banging the Bible</i>), used foul language about
Miss Magnet&mdash;</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>cutting in</i>). I met Miss Magnet, she said I was
to be sure to see Maria practised "The Turkish Patrol."</p>

<p>MR. PORTER and MRS. PORTER (<i>together</i>). "The Turkish
Patrol" won't be played any more in this house, Miss Porter.</p>

<p>MATILDA. Oh, dear, something dreadful must have happened!</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>grimly</i>). I always knew it was an unhappy
marriage, but I never thought I'd live to see them admit it.</p>

<p>(This acts as a cold douche on the others; they all stare at
EMILY, <i>who seems to dominate them all. They become
thoughtful;</i> MATILDA, <i>glancing away from her aunt, surveys
her parents with a sharp curiosity that makes her forget her
hysterics and affectations; a slight pause</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (facing a new thought). An unhappy marriage. Good
heavens. Well, I suppose so.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. We never agreed about anything. Not from the very
first. It was all pretence.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. I don't know that I ever undertook to do more than
pretend. After all, what more <i>can</i> a man undertake?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Or a woman either. How hard you were when little
Annie died. (<i>Sobbing</i>.)</p>

<p>EMILY. If little Annie had lived you would have found her just
as trying as you do Matilda.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>with curiosity, to</i> MATILDA). Are you happy,
Mattie?</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>sharply</i>). Happy?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. I'm serious.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Why shouldn't she be happy?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>seriously</i>). That's what I want to know.
Family life is not easy&mdash;you suddenly find you've been doing
a difficult thing for twenty-five years. Here we are, accusing
each other. What about? There's something in the air.
(<i>Thoughtfully</i>.) It must be you women. I don't get this
sort of thing at the office, everything goes smoothly there, year
after year.</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>shrilly</i>). That is it, Papa, you have got the
office. We're rather shut up.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>puzzled</i>). Shut up? This is your home.</p>

<p>MATILDA. Home isn't enough.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Not enough? For a good woman?</p>

<p>EMILY. Supposing we weren't any of us good women?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>sharply</i>). Speak for yourself, Emily.</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>defiantly</i>). Papa asked if I was happy. Good? I
don't know. I would like to go out more. Why <i>need</i> we live
in Islington?</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>amazed</i>). Don't you like Islington, Matilda?
You were born here.</p>

<p>MATILDA. Perhaps that's why. No, I don't like it.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. What would you like?</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>more defiantly</i>). To travel. Rose Watson went
to Switzerland.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. They are dreadful people. Travel!</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>with remorse</i>). Oh, what dreadful things I'm
saying! Papa, you should not have asked me if I was happy!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>slowly</i>). I suppose it is a dangerous
question. Queer how I came to ask it. (<i>Looking round at the
three women</i>.) How was I to know you were not happy? You've
always behaved yourselves&mdash;till to-day. And so have I.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>spitefully</i>). I dare say. But there are
hours when we don't see you. <i>We</i> are always here, watching
each other.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. I suppose you'll tell me next that you aren't fond
of one another?</p>

<p>EMILY. No one could be fond of Clara. I've been sorry for her.
And amused.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>bridling</i>). I hope there is some credit due
to me for enduring Emily. All these years.</p>

<p>MATILDA. I believe this is the first chance I have had of
being taken seriously. Or speaking seriously. It's a funny
feeling.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>with dreadful curiosity</i>). Aren't you fond
of your mother and aunt?</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>slowly</i>). Of course, I must be. But I would
like to get away from them.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. And this is a Christian home!</p>

<p>EMILY. That is what is the matter with it&mdash;no one could
keep up appearances as well as we have, and for so long, without
suffering for it.</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>quickly</i>). Suffering! Yes, one does.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Ungrateful girl, surrounded with every
comfort&mdash;I've suffered, my heart, my nerves, the anxieties
of bringing up you children, your father's tempers. And I don't
like Islington, either!</p>

<p>(<i>Softly but firmly there breaks in the sound of "The
Turkish Patrol."</i>)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>starting at the sound</i>). Why <i>need</i>
Maria learn "The Turkish Patrol?"</p>

<p>EMILY. For the same reason that we live in Islington, I
suppose.</p>

<p>MATILDA. I hate my drawing lessons. Must I have them? I would
like to ask Mr. Bliss to tea&mdash;may I?</p>

<p>EMILY. I would like to take my money, go away and spend it on
myself. I would like to keep a parrot. And to not go to Margate
every year. Yes, I should like everything to be quite
different.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>pondering</i>). Why can't it be?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. If I once began saying what I would like! Why, I
daren't even begin to think about it.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>still pondering</i>). You never began to think
about anything did you, Clara? Not to <i>really</i> think. I
don't believe I have, either&mdash;it's dangerous. Look where
we've got to now. (<i>To</i> EMILY.) Quite different, eh? But we
are all comfortable.</p>

<p>EMILY. Yes. One's body is, but one's mind always seems to be
sitting on hard chairs.</p>

<p>MATILDA. And having nasty food, and never resting
properly&mdash;yes, it's all inside one. May I have Mr. Bliss to
tea?</p>

<p>EMILY. If you married Mr. Bliss, you'd have another home like
this, exactly.</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>bitterly</i>). Don't! Don't! (<i>Sitting down at
the table and turning over the wools mechanically</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>heavily</i>). I don't see what good all this is
doing. I've allowed you women too much licence, it ought not to
be possible for you to talk like this. You've made me forget all
I was going to say about Henry. After all, Henry is more
important than any of you.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Henry and I&mdash;</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. I won't hear a word from you about Henry&mdash;you
turned him out of the house, he may have run away or drowned
himself for all I know. A fine mother, Mrs. Porter! (<i>To</i>
MATILDA.) As for you, miss, you may not have that Bliss fellow to
tea&mdash;he is only a clerk.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Wherever did you meet him? I never heard you
mention him before. For shame, miss.</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>dully</i>). I met him at the church sale of
work&mdash;</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>interrupting</i>). He is very plain. Why did you
want to ask him here?</p>

<p>MATILDA. Because he is the only man who ever wanted to
come.</p>

<p>MRs. PORTER (<i>seriously frightened</i>). We can't have these
things said! We can't! John, I shall return to mother.</p>

<p>MATILDA. You quarrelled with Grannie last time we visited
her.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Be silent, miss! John, do you hear? I've been
insulted, outraged, treated atrociously by you and your children.
I am leaving the house. (<i>Putting her handkerchief to her
eyes</i>.) Oh, my heart! I feel faint, my head!</p>

<p>(<i>They all look at her without offering assistance as she
collapses on chair L. of the table.)</i></p>

<p>EMILY. She'll never go, or if she did she'd come back. Gran is
cleverer than we are.</p>

<p>MATILDA. Henry is the lucky one. He has got free.</p>

<p>EMILY. He'll marry that Speed&mdash;puss.</p>

<p>MATILDA. I hate her!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Why, Mattie, why?</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>fiercely</i>). She is so pretty.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Emily, stop that child playing.</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>going to door L., opening it, and calling out</i>).
Stop that horrid noise, miss, or I'll smack you till you can't
sit on the piano-stool!</p>

<p>(<i>The music ceases suddenly</i>, EMILY shuts the door.)</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>faintly</i>). Oh, what vulgarity! How
degrading! And Matilda talking of prettiness and young
men&mdash;you bold, brazen girl! And Sarah Speed <i>isn't
pretty</i>, either.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. I quite understand poor Mattie&mdash;you ought to
have seen to it she had better chances&mdash;did her hair
differently.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>rising wildly</i>). Let me get away&mdash;help
me, some one, let me get out&mdash;I'm stifling. John&mdash;oh,
John! the man wants me to deck out my Matilda like a daughter of
Babylon! Oh! After all these years of patience! We indeed wander
in a vale of tears!</p>

<p>(<i>The two women give some perfunctory attention to</i> MRS.
PORTER, <i>who collapses in her chair</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>losing his temper with a roar</i>). I'll be
damned, blasted, roasted if I'Il wander in the vale of
<i>your</i> tears any more!</p>

<p>(<i>He sweeps wax flowers and wool mat off the table with a
gesture of abandoned fury:</i> MRS. PORTER'S <i>hysterics rise
louder, she beats her heels on the floor:</i> MARIA <i>sticks her
head out of door L. and gapes, unnoticed by any</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>Roaring</i>.) I'll stand no more of it, d'ye hear, the
pack of you?</p>

<p><i>You're pampered, overfed, lazy, useless, ill-tempered,
jealous! Henry was worth the lot of you! And then a dozen
more!</i> </p>

<p><i>(The women make some incoherent efforts to speak, but they
are cowed.)</i> </p>

<p>A man toils to make money to spend on&mdash;you! (<i>Pointing
at them</i>.)</p>

<p>(MARIA, <i>unseen in the background, begins to giggle. Enter,
door R.</i>, HENRY, <i>a spruce, neat young man, neither as
foolish as his mother nor as formidable as his father. Bright and
slightly self-assured: his appearance works a miracle with the
group by the table</i>. MRS. PORTER <i>instantly drops her
hysterics, straightens her cap, and smiling</i>, EMILY <i>makes a
grab for the wax fruit</i>.)</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>glibly</i>). An accident! How vexatious! Your dear
Papa, Henry, tripped over the table, and I fear the lovely fruit
is broken!</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>her smooth manner returned</i>). Never mind, dear
Aunt Emily, I believe I shall be able to mend it quite
neatly!</p>

<p>(MR. PORTER <i>darts a look of amazement at this feminine
duplicity, then decides to imitate it</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>with breathless composure</i>). Your mother was
threatened with one of her attacks&mdash;hastening to her
assistance&mdash;I tripped.</p>

<p>HENRY (<i>advancing</i>). Dear Mother&mdash;you have
recovered, I trust?</p>

<p>(<i>Embracing his mother, who is now perfectly controlled and
even smiling</i>. MR. PORTER <i>can hardly restrain his
amazement</i>.)</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>coyly</i>). I am perfectly recovered, dear
Henry&mdash;but you have been a long time!</p>

<p>(MARIA <i>enters from door L</i>. EMILY <i>and</i> MATILDA
<i>are piecing together the wax fruits</i>.)</p>

<p>HENRY (<i>brightly</i>). I have brought Sarah&mdash;I had some
difficulty to persuade her&mdash;but she is waiting in the hall
for your permission to come in.</p>

<p>(<i>All save</i> MRS. PORTER <i>&gt;look at him surprised:</i>
MATILDA <i>drops the wax fruit she holds</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Sarah! Miss Speed here!</p>

<p>HENRY (<i>turning to him</i>). Oh, dear Papa, Mother said I
could. She said she was sure you would soften&mdash;she was so
very kind, dear Mamma.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Kind? I thought&mdash;</p>

<p>EMILY. Hush! John!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>faintly</i>). Fetch Miss Speed, Henry.</p>

<p>HENRY. Oh, thank you, sir,</p>

<p>(HENRY, <i>shaking his hand violently, exits by the door
R.</i>)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>turning instantly to his wife</i>). Clara! You
were&mdash;kind? You didn't drive Henry away?</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER. Of course not. But you never allowed me to say
so&mdash;you kept threatening and bullying.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>to</i> EMILY <i>in despair</i>). If she'd only
<i>told</i> me. The woman is a fool.</p>

<p>EMILY. But you knew that. Don't let Henry see anything
wrong.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. All over nothing! I don't know how I can pull
myself together.</p>

<p>MATILDA. For Henry's sake&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> HENRY, <i>door R., with</i> MISS SPEED, <i>very
pretty and demure. The family greet her with forced but emphatic
smiles: their affectations, now safely resumed again, carry them
over an awkward moment</i>. MISS SPEED <i>glides from one to
another with affectionate greetings</i>.)</p>

<p>MISS SPEED (<i>crossing to</i> MRS. PORTER). Oh, Mrs. Porter,
I am overwhelmed&mdash;when dear Henry said you would receive
me&mdash;(<i>Turning to</i> MR. PORTER.) And you, dear sir. I
know I am unworthy of your regard&mdash;a disappointing match for
you&mdash;but I will be a good obedient wife to Henry.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. Of course, of course, my dear. I'm delighted, I'm
sure. Mrs. Porter is delighted, every one is delighted&mdash;in
fact we were gathered here to welcome you.</p>

<p>HENRY (<i>unctuously</i>). How good every one is!</p>

<p>MATILDA (<i>to</i> MISS SPEED). We are going to be
<i>great</i> friends. I've always admired you so much!</p>

<p>EMILY (<i>to</i> Miss SPEED, <i>who has crossed to her</i>). I
always <i>hoped</i> you were going to say "yes" to Henry.</p>

<p>MISS SPEED (<i>taking a hand of each</i>). How good every one
is!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>looking round</i>). Ah, here is Maria. Come
forward, child, and speak to your new sister.</p>

<p>(MARIA <i>comes forward, gaping and staring</i>.)</p>

<p>MISS SPEED (<i>embracing</i> MARIA). Oh, this is the little
darling who plays so beautifully!</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>patting</i> MARIA'S <i>head</i>). Yes, quite a
talent, quite a talent. She is learning "The Turkish Patrol," a
most interesting piece. I always insist on really good music.</p>

<p>MARIA. But, Papa, you said&mdash;</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>crossing to above table</i>). Hush, dear
(<i>Holding up her hand reprovingly</i>.) Never speak till you
are spoken to.</p>

<p>HENRY. Mamma, I've promised Sarah you'll teach her some of
your wonderful housekeeping.</p>

<p>MISS SPEED. Pray do, Mrs. Porter, though I shall never be able
to make Henry as comfortable as you do!</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>simpering</i>). I do my best.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER (<i>pompously</i>). You couldn't come to a better
school, Miss Speed. I flatter myself this is a well-run home.</p>

<p>HENRY. And, Papa, we've planned to take the little house next
door, so that we won't have to leave Islington!</p>

<p>MATILDA. Won't that be wonderful! Not to leave Islington!</p>

<p>Miss SPEED (<i>who has crossed back to</i> HENRY;
<i>shyly</i>). And Papa and I have arranged to come to Margate,
too, this summer.</p>

<p>EMILY. That will be delightful&mdash;you'll love Margate.</p>

<p>MRS. PORTER (<i>fatuously</i>). I'm sure we're all going to be
very, very happy.</p>

<p>HENRY. And perhaps Aunt Emily could come and live with us just
to show Sarah the way I like things.</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. An excellent idea. Emily will enjoy making you
comfortable, I'm sure.</p>

<p>(MARIA <i>exits quietly and sneakingly by the door up
L.</i>)</p>

<p>HENRY. Dear Mamma, we met that fellow Bliss coming along; he
tried to make himself friendly, but I soon showed him his
mistake.</p>

<p>Miss SPEED. Such a common man!</p>

<p>MATILDA. Odious. I am so glad you showed him he was being
impertinent.</p>

<p>EMILY. Matilda was only saying this morning he was becoming
quite pestering.</p>

<p>MATILDA. Dear Aunt Emily.</p>

<p>(<i>She puts her arm through that of</i> EMILY. MR. PORTER
<i>puts his with a loving gesture round his wife. They face</i>
HENRY <i>and</i> Miss SPEED, <i>who stand R.</i>.)</p>

<p>MR. PORTER. All I can say, my dears, is that I hope you'll be
as happy as we've been&mdash;these twenty-five years.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a> THE CONFESSION</h2>

<h3>A SOUVENIR OF A STAY IN SWITZERLAND&mdash;1880</h3>

<p class="first">
THE great chemist had finished his lecture: "an epoch-making
lecture," the newspapers would call it, in the articles that
carried all over the world, and would make his name even more
famous than it was to-day; Richard Crighton, one of <i>the</i>
names of all time.</p>

<p>While they were discussing him, all excited, all seeing in
these discoveries, inventions, or as Crighton called them,
"condensations of eternal verities," the ultimate realization of
their own personal dreams of progress, goodness, ambition, or
money, the man himself went away, taking only one with him, a
young Frenchman, whose work closely pursued his own, had even
boasted it might in time surpass it; Crighton liked this man for
his intelligence, his industry and his severe adoration; common
adulation had long since disgusted the lofty genius of Richard
Crighton, but he could still savour the admiration of one quite,
well, nearly, his intellectual equal, only lesser than he by the
difference in years and the knowledge the years bring.</p>

<p>The two men sat silent, each gazing in the tall clear flames
on the straight plain hearth, that burnt with the bright serenity
of the fires rising from some sacrifice on an altar.</p>

<p>The room was of course severe, ordered with a keen economy of
beauty rare to the West.</p>

<p>There was one picture, a <i>Claude Lorraine</i> (but Crighton
called him <i>Gelée</i>), one bronze (an early Florentine David),
and a bowl of flowers (branches of forced white lilac), each with
a dull grey lacquer wall background&mdash;by the
fire-place&mdash;nothing but two fantastic andirons cast by
<i>Cellini</i>.</p>

<p>Plain grey curtains shut out the London March night&mdash;for
the rest, simplest of chairs and tables and a large untidy desk;
no secretaries came into this room.</p>

<p>A "queer" room, people said; not many saw it, fewer liked it;
even the young Frenchman who sat there to-night rather resented
the <i>Claude Lorraine</i>&mdash;what did a taste so fine drawn,
so weary of mere beauty, so precise and overtrained, want with
this fairy landscape?</p>

<p>"Of course, it is quite wonderful," said Desalle, in his
excellent English. "The pinnacle, the pinnacle!"</p>

<p>"For me?" asked Crighton quietly.</p>

<p>"Naturally. You are one of&mdash;them&mdash;now. Archimedes,
Galileo, Newton, Faraday&mdash;it's&mdash;well, there is nothing
like it&mdash;can be nothing like&mdash;even you&mdash;must feel
that?</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the great man slowly. "I think it seems
rather flat."</p>

<p>"Flat!"</p>

<p>"Or flavourless, like something you have sucked the taste out
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, you have had always too much success&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Desalle&mdash;what <i>do</i> we mean by
this&mdash;success?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman smiled queerly.</p>

<p>"You want to analyse&mdash;even that?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;again, a Mumbo-Jumbo word, analyse! The thing I
mean is just the thing that always escapes...analysis."</p>

<p>"Just&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What Psyche missed in the dark, what Pandora shut the lid
on&mdash;the side of the apple Adam <i>didn't</i> bite&mdash;the
few grains of 'unknown matter' at the bottom of your
crucible!"</p>

<p>"Not much unknown to you, Professor, at the bottom of your
crucible&mdash;but I see what you mean, of course, you can teach
the universe how to spin, but you cannot control your own
heart-beats."</p>

<p>Crighton smiled; he leant forward in the spare-looking, but
supremely comfortable chair; the subdued glow of the electric
bulbs concealed somewhere in the cornice, showed his heavy, yet
fallen figure, the bearded face, fine, yet physically a ruin, his
precise, expressionless evening clothes, the dead black, the
glazed white, the heavily veined, pale hands.</p>

<p>"Right, as usual, Desalle," he said: his tired voice was
almost sad. "Heart, or conscience, that is what I meant, I
suppose."</p>

<p>The alert Frenchman caught at a word in this sentence that
seemed to him peculiarly grotesque.</p>

<p>"Conscience! That cannot concern you, Professor. The most
generous of men, the most just and kind&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crighton checked him with a lift of the tired hand.</p>

<p>"You always admired me, Desalle; well, well." The faded,
strained eyes flashed a second behind the spectacles. "Who paid
for your training, Desalle?"</p>

<p>So direct was this suddenly personal question that the younger
man almost flushed.</p>

<p>"My people, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah...they were, are, well to do?"</p>

<p>"Wealthy, you might say, Professor. Where are you leading
me?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere. My mind rambles. Tired, Desalle. Wealthy! They spent
a lot of money on you?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid...a great deal, sir."</p>

<p>"Expensive training! Expensive experiments! Travel! Leisure!
Books! Yes, a great deal&mdash;a great deal of money."</p>

<p>Crighton spoke thoughtfully, gazing into the fire, springing
straightly up, as from a poured libation.</p>

<p>"You do not earn much money now, Desalle?"</p>

<p>"Not a great deal, sir."</p>

<p>"You will. As I have done. A great deal of money. You are not
forty yet? And well on the road."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. But I never much wanted money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Money!" repeated the old man. "You speak with an emphasis of
contempt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not contempt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do, you do&mdash;because you have always had it, and were
able to forget it, eh?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;perhaps."</p>

<p>"Now, supposing you had been poor, conscious of your powers,
knowing what you needed to cultivate them&mdash;with no one to
help you, only capable of earning a small wage by hard
distasteful work...well, you would have found yourself thinking a
great deal about money, Desalle."</p>

<p>The Frenchman's lean face showed concentrated and keen in
expression.</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted.</p>

<p>"And what would you, so young, so ambitious, so sure of
yourself, so desperate, have done to obtain that money?" demanded
the great man.</p>

<p>"Almost anything, I suppose, sir."</p>

<p>"<i>Almost</i> anything! We come to the bottom of the
crucible, Desalle, the small residue in our tubes of 'unknown
material,' <i>almost</i> anything!"</p>

<p>"Well, one would not care for a career founded on fraud, or
wrong, or lies, or any kind of thieving or trickery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked Crighton quickly. "Or are you just
repeating the usual thing?"</p>

<p>"The usual thing?"</p>

<p>"What we are expected to say to these questions. I
mean&mdash;the answers dictated by tradition, convention!"</p>

<p>"I do not know, sir," replied Desalle slowly. "I have never
been tried. One takes so much for granted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wealthy people do," came the rather harsh interruption.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and I have always, I think, believed&mdash;in
tradition," finished the Frenchman with a touch of stiffness.</p>

<p>"But you've never been tempted?"</p>

<p>"Tempted, Professor?"</p>

<p>Crighton smiled at the intonation.</p>

<p>"Oh, not crudely. We can most of us keep our hands out of each
other's pockets&mdash;but&mdash;well, there are degrees&mdash;it
is like a man priding himself on his disdain for a flashy
street-walker&mdash;<i>she</i> does not tempt you, of course, but
there may be a woman somewhere who could make you do something
you would rather not."</p>

<p>The Frenchman very slightly shrugged.</p>

<p>"Of course. Nevertheless I should hope to withstand your 'one
in a million' woman as successfully as the poor prostitute."</p>

<p>"Oh, Desalle, Desalle!" sighed Crighton. "Listen to what I am
going to tell you. I want to tell someone. It is at the bottom of
everything with me."</p>

<p>"The usual thing, again?"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;Love? How curious the word sounds. Cheapened
till we are ashamed to use it, eh? Made common as dirt, vulgar as
town mud! Romance! Love!"</p>

<p>His glance just flickered, in a pause of silence, to the
<i>Claude Lorraine</i>, cunningly lit by hidden lamps to show the
golden distance, the gleaming river, the ethereal clouds.</p>

<p>"Exquisite," said Desalle, respectfully. "This room has made
me discontented with every picture gallery and museum in
Europe."</p>

<p>"That is not what you meant to say," smiled Crighton.</p>

<p>"Yes, Professor. Not what I thought, perhaps."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"I always thought that picture out of place," conceded the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Yes. A fairy-tale slipped into a treatise on Molecules! Never
mind. I want to show you something."</p>

<p>Desalle made no further attempt to change the subject; he had
wanted to talk "shop," but he knew when it was useless to induce
Crighton to do this, and there was something too reverential in
his attitude towards the older man to permit him to endeavour to
lead the conversation.</p>

<p>Besides he was becoming interested.</p>

<p>With a slow, rather awkward movement Crighton turned in his
chair, and opened a drawer in the little slender table that stood
beside him, which held the untouched decanters and unopened
cabinet of cigars.</p>

<p>From this drawer, with clumsy hands that slightly trembled
(Desalle reminded himself that the great man was old, old) he
drew out a small box.</p>

<p>Desalle knew it at once for one of those cheap affairs of
unstained wood, crudely carved and sold to "tourists" in every
Swiss town.</p>

<p>It was locked; Crighton actually had the tiny key on his
watch-chain and fumbled with it slowly.</p>

<p>Desalle was interested.</p>

<p>"It does not look fifty years old&mdash;nearly?" smiled the
great man. "They make them just the same now. But they were more
uncommon then. And more expensive. This cost...ten francs, a lot
of money to me then...a lot of money to a very poor young
man."</p>

<p>The last words impressed the Frenchman with a quick sense of
queerness, but, being subtle, he did not say&mdash;"You were
poor, then?" but:</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> bought it, Professor?"</p>

<p>"Nearly fifty years ago. At&mdash;, 'a little village at the
foot of the Alps'&mdash;you remember <i>Julie?</i>"</p>

<p>Desalle smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes. But I should not have thought you would, Professor."</p>

<p>"It was a favourite book with me, then. I think I took it for
'light literature'! Well, well."</p>

<p>He had unlocked the box now.</p>

<p>Inside&mdash;a ring, a letter, a flat and withered flower.</p>

<p>"Very much the usual thing," smiled Crighton.</p>

<p>Desalle took out his cigarette-case; the love-story of Richard
Crighton! How poignant...and how utterly trivial...an old man
dwelling on a half-century old romance...rather dreadful.</p>

<p>To Desalle it was almost like a first horrible touch of
senility...as if Crighton had begun to talk of his first breeches
or the attack of measles he had had at six...almost.</p>

<p>"I am not going to be garrulous," smiled the great man with a
humorous look at the other's cigarette.</p>

<p>"Garrulous!" repeated Desalle. "The word is an
affront&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was sincere, yet nothing had been in his mind save what
this word expressed.</p>

<p>Crighton looked at his treasures and lifted them out, one by
one.</p>

<p>First, the ring, that just circled the top of his little
finger; "cheap" as the box from which it came, made when
"artificial" stones were so crudely done, glass coloured red and
white that gave out not one flicker of light, but stared dull and
blank from the thick setting.</p>

<p>Second, the flower; eidel-weiss (<i>of course</i>, thought
Desalle) looking like heavy flannel, dried and flat, dirty white,
dingy green, a touch of withered gold.</p>

<p>Third, the letter, a buff envelope, the stamp with the young
Queen's head, the thin postmark&mdash;the address in a careful
hand to:</p>

<br>

<p class="cp"> <i>Richard Crighton, Esquire,<br>

88, Blomfield Street,<br>

Mary-Le-Bone.</i></p>

<br>

<p>No letters after the name...and what an address...fifty years
ago...</p>

<p>"I just want you to see this picture," said the great man,
putting the three objects back into the box which he held openon
his lounging knee. "A young man, myself, very poor, very
friendless, very ambitious, at the end of all his resources,
forced to give up all his dreams&mdash;which were&mdash;well, not
so wild&mdash;and take a job, they would say now, at&mdash;a soap
factory, shall we call it, a small salary, continuous work, no
time, no money, no heart <i>for what he wants to do</i>, what he
thinks, God helping him, he <i>ought to do</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was right, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, Desalle. I see him in this little village&mdash;he had
got away to think it out, Switzerland was a bit of an adventure
in those days, almost like Rousseau saw it&mdash;it was his last
assertion of liberty. He was really at the end of things...and
going back to the...soap factory."</p>

<p>"Was there no way, sir?"</p>

<p>"None. He had tried everything. It was all so much more
difficult then. People were very comfortable. And blind. They did
not really want-scientists. Discovery seemed, well, a little
blasphemous. You weren't&mdash;encouraged. No one was looking out
for you. They&mdash;they honestly thought you could do better in,
in the soap factory."</p>

<p>Desalle pressed out his cigarette and sat still.</p>

<p>"I see this young fellow, myself, a likely young fellow, I
suppose...and, my God, how much in earnest!...coming across those
fields at the foot of the Alps, and a girl with him, a funny
little dark girl&mdash;not&mdash;no, I do not think you would
call her pretty&mdash;she was not anything else either, not
distinguished, nor clever, nor wealthy just a little English
governess in one of the better families of the place. She wore
this ring. She had not, even, I think, very good taste. I have
forgotten the dress. I remember the hat&mdash;with plaid ribbons.
She was carrying this box&mdash;she had admired it so much that
the young man had asked her to keep it&mdash;he had only bought
it himself because he was sorry for the peasant who made it. And
sold so few."</p>

<p>The quiet voice, weary with the long lecture, dropped a
second.</p>

<p>Desalle glanced, almost furtively, at the <i>Claude
Lorraine</i>.</p>

<p>"So I see them," continued the great man. "Young, side by
side. And soon&mdash;another picture. The girl&mdash;dying. Some
quick infection&mdash;some carelessness&mdash;and the funny
little dark girl is dying. In the deal-boarded, white-curtained
Swiss bedroom. Her&mdash;employers&mdash;arc kind. She has asked
for the young man, and he is allowed to sit beside her. It is too
early for flowers, but he brings the little spray of eidel-weiss,
not knowing why, and she tries to kiss it. She will not let him
leave her. And when she is delirious, which is often, she says,
'Richard, Richard&mdash;' The doctor is sorry. They are all
sorry. They did not know that she had&mdash;-a romance&mdash;they
call it. They thought her plain, not interesting. Everyone is
sympathetic&mdash;kind&mdash;sorry. They telegraphed to England,
which still seemed rather a wonderful thing to do&mdash;and the
only relative comes&mdash;an aunt, very affectionate, very
tremulous, rather&mdash;fine&mdash;no, not the word&mdash;noble,
I think something noble, about this agitated, plain, elderly
woman."</p>

<p>Crighton was silent a second, he had the indrawn look of one
who sees pictures of his own making that blot out actuality.</p>

<p>"Almost as soon as the aunt arrives, the girl dies&mdash;this
box, this flower on her pillow, the young man so close&mdash;that
his face was the last thing she saw. Well! It is over...there is
the funeral, the comments&mdash;the aunt goes back to England in
her black crepe dress&mdash;and presently the young man goes
too&mdash;back to the soap factory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wretched," murmured Desalle. "Wretched."</p>

<p>"Wretched! Poor devil! Now&mdash;another picture&mdash;it is
just a few days before he takes up his new post, and he is in his
common little room, dark, rather dirty and uncomfortable, I
think, though he did not notice that then&mdash;and he means to
burn his books, and never dream of them again&mdash;the books
that could only whet his appetite&mdash;there is the fire in a
heavy grate and the books ready. When&mdash;the post. A letter.
This letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>Desalle felt a curious pang; he wished the old man would
stop.</p>

<p>"&mdash;from the aunt of the funny little dark girl&mdash;by
the same post a parcel, with the eidel-weiss, the box, the cheap
ring she had always worn&mdash;This is the letter&mdash;she had
written to the Swiss Hotel for my address&mdash;Listen."</p>

<p>Slowly he drew a single sheet of paper out of the buff
envelope and read aloud:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.
Crighton</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">Mary had no time to tell me of you, and
afterwards I saw you did not feel you could speak of it. But I
understood. How much she loved you! I send you her ring your
betrothal ring I guess it to be, the mountain flower, and the box
she treasured so. Also, what will surprise you very much, a
cheque for a thousand pounds. Mary's little fortune that I had
charge of&mdash;it was for her dowry, or, if she never married,
to set her up in a little school. Now, it seems so naturally
yours that I can hardly think you need telling so. I heard you
were not rich and wished to study&mdash;medicine, was it? Mary
can help you perhaps with this money, as she will, I know, by the
memory of her love&mdash;she would have been your wife,
remember."</p>

<br>

<p>Crighton folded the letter away without a word of comment.</p>

<p>"A pathetic idyll, sir," remarked Desalle gently.</p>

<p>"I took the money," said Crighton, closing the box. "I never
went to the soap factory. I meant to pay it back, but the woman
died soon after. That money was the foundation of everything for
me."</p>

<p>"Rather beautiful, sir&mdash;I do not see what there should be
to question in it&mdash;<i>she</i> would have been so
pleased&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Desalle spoke he recalled that the great man had never
married.</p>

<p>"How pleased and proud she would have been," he added
warmly.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Crighton slowly, falling sunken into
the chair and replacing the box carefully on the little
table.</p>

<p>"I wonder. Did she care for me&mdash;or was it the delirium.
The usual thing?"</p>

<p>"I do not follow you, sir."</p>

<p>"I took the money," said Crighton again, not heeding him.
"There was your delicate temptation! I took it. Lie, fraud,
cheat&mdash;well, what do you say now, Desalle? Those are my
foundations&mdash;the ambitious grab, the swift unscrupulous
seizing of advantage, the absence of honour, of rectitude! The
usual thing!"</p>

<p>"I have not got it clear, sir."</p>

<p>"No. I'll tell you. I do not know if that girl loved
me&mdash;but I did not love her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Desalle looked again at the <i>Claude Lorraine</i>.</p>

<p>"I was not betrothed to her&mdash;I did not know her
name&mdash;I met her on the fields three days before she
died...for the first time she spoke to me casually&mdash;about
the way. I offered her the box to put some winter cones in, her
hands were so full&mdash;that was all. She must have known my
name, for she sent for me when she was ill. And everyone thought
we were lovers. It did not seem possible to undeceive them. Or
worth while. The girl was dead. And I accepted her money."</p>

<p>Desalle dropped his glance from the golden picture.</p>

<p>The flames had died down on the hearth now, peaceful as an
offering accepted, a sacrifice completed.</p>

<p>Crighton put the Swiss box back into the drawer of the
table.</p>

<p>"Think it over," he said in a very tired voice. "Think it
over...I haven't told you...there was a lock of her hair put in
by the aunt...with the other things...I could not keep
that&mdash;-I destroyed it&mdash;&mdash;perhaps remorse."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a> MARWOOD'S GHOST STORY</h2>

<h3>A PUZZLE-PIECE&mdash;1890</h3>

<p class="first">
HE went into the country to write a ghost story; he had
written about most things but never about ghosts; he was a keen,
practical, clever man and he could not admit that there was
anything, in the writing way, that he could not do; since other
people had achieved ghost stories, he meant to achieve
one&mdash;a good ghost story.</p>

<p>He did not despise any of the usual effects, loneliness, snow,
even Christmas Eve; he thought that if he went into the country
for the winter and experienced all these sensations for himself
he might be helped in the writing of his story.</p>

<p>Of course there were a great many trashy, flimsy, silly ghost
stories written, but that did not prevent someone writing a
really fine ghost story, a tale that would grip and chill and
pester the imagination of the unfortunate reader.</p>

<p>Marwood had never been very successful as far as money goes
though the critics, those one or two or three or four that can
really be called critics, always encouraged him; still he had
sufficient means to be able to, sometimes, do what he liked; he
was able now, for instance, to give up the winter to writing this
ghost story; able, with the assistance of Janet, his wife, who
came willingly into the country because the doctors, three very
clever doctors, had said that Marwood was overworking, that he
wanted quiet, a rest and change.</p>

<p>Doctors say that kind of thing very often, and sometimes rich,
or lazy, or solitary folk are able to take advantage of the
advice.</p>

<p>The cottage was very lonely, but not inconvenient; it was
solid, compact, and could be made warm. Marwood paid so little
rent for it that Janet felt she could be slightly lavish in
comforts; Marwood had his big soft chair, his clear lamp, his
roomy shelves, his thick curtains, his bright fires and his
books.</p>

<p>The room soon began to overflow with books; Marwood began to
collect ghost stories; he had never read a ghost story before,
being a rational, sceptical man; his sharp, acrid studies of
modern life had had as little to do with ghosts as with
fairies.</p>

<p>"It is a queer thing," said Janet, "that you should want to
write about ghosts&mdash;it is so silly, really, and so
overdone."</p>

<p>"I know; that's the interest, to see if you can put some new
vigour into such old stuff&mdash;one ought to be able to
do&mdash;it is just a question of applying your
intelligence."</p>

<p>Janet said:</p>

<p>"The best ghost stories have been written by those who believe
in ghosts."</p>

<p>Marwood didn't think so; he didn't really think that anyone
believed in ghosts.</p>

<p>"Well," argued Janet, "I don't see how you can hope to scare
anyone, if no one believes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Marwood impatiently, "the fools who read ghost
stories&mdash;it's a special audience, of course."</p>

<p>It was November and he had not begun to write; he just sat in
his comfortable room and read the other fellows' failures.</p>

<p>He didn't think much of any of them, not even Defoe, or Roe,
or Walter Scott.</p>

<p>"Stuff to frighten children," he said. "There must be a good
ghost story somewhere, and I'm going to write it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Janet didn't care as long as he was quiet, resting; she was
absorbed in making him comfortable; a plain woman who had never
been enticed by pleasure, she did not miss the seductions of
town, but sometimes she found the place rather lonely.</p>

<p>It was in a field, off a by-lane, and when the tradespeople
(three times a week) and the postman, had "called" there was no
one else all day but perhaps a farm-hand trudging through the
mud.</p>

<p>It had been a wet summer; when the Marwoods first came the
trees were still green, a dank and sodden green, and for a month
the low swollen clouds hung over the bistre-coloured uplands and
the rain slashed, for many hours each day, into fields already
like a sponge full of water. Then, in November, came the frost,
and everything was dry and blackish against a sky the colour of
iron.</p>

<p>Marwood continued to buy ghost stories; he searched old
catalogues for anything remotely bearing on the subject; piles of
books came from the library.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to get ideas," he explained to Janet. "I'm
just seeing what the other fellows have said, so I can leave all
that alone and start fresh&mdash;it's amazing. The credulity, the
childish nonsense!"</p>

<p>"You'll get swamped in all that rubbish," replied Janet, who
was a very practical woman. "I should stop if I were you and
begin to write&mdash;after all, we can't stay here for ever."</p>

<p>Of course not. I've got my plot, you know; it won't take me
long to write it&mdash;I ought to have it ready soon after
Christmas; that was part of my plan, you know, to spend Christmas
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't know if it is Christmas or not here, no one comes
near us, they think we are mad, or heathen."</p>

<p>"Still it <i>will</i> be Christmas Eve and I shall get the
atmosphere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't see why ghosts should come out on Christmas Eve,
never could; there's no logic in it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course there isn't," said Marwood, irritated. "It is all
an absurd invention. Haven't I told you that is what I want to
do, take the stupid nonsense as it stands and make something out
of it that's going to touch people up a bit?"</p>

<p>Janet thought that he was becoming rather bad-tempered and
rude; she didn't believe much in his ghost story, she wished that
he would get it over and done with and back to his usual work;
with the cold the loneliness increased and Janet would have been
quite glad to have returned to town.</p>

<p>When she ventured to make some remark to this effect, he
returned a queer reply.</p>

<p>Janet said:</p>

<p>"If we stay away much longer you'll get out of touch with
things."</p>

<p>And Marwood answered:</p>

<p>"I'm just getting <i>into</i> touch with things!"</p>

<p>He looked vexed at her surprise and added sullenly:</p>

<p>"It depends what you mean by <i>things</i>."</p>

<p>The first day of real snow Janet remarked that it might be a
good occasion to commence the book.</p>

<p>Marwood said, yes, it was a good occasion, and he would go
upstairs and write.</p>

<p>During their quiet meal that evening he seemed thoughtful, his
lean, yellowish face was, Janet believed, paler than usual.</p>

<p>"Isn't it remarkable," he asked suddenly, "where they get it
all from?"</p>

<p>"All what?" Janet was stupid at an emergency.</p>

<p>"All those things&mdash;ghosts, griffins, cockatrices,
hobgoblins, vampires&mdash;if they never existed, how did people
come to think of them?"</p>

<p>"Ignorance, of course." Janet was alert now. "They saw
something that they didn't understand and they made up a
tale&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why? And how? <i>Where did they get the stuff for the
tale?</i>"</p>

<p>"Imagination, obviously."</p>

<p>"But what is imagination, Janet?"</p>

<p>Janet became impatient.</p>

<p>"I should think that you are reading too much of that
trash."</p>

<p>"I only want to know where they got it from," he persisted
obstinately. "Some of those tales are so queer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Inventions, fancies."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Marwood, exasperated, "but where did they
get them from?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's drink, and drugs." Janet tried to humour
him.</p>

<p>"That only starts it off&mdash;do you think the vision is in
the glass? It's in your brain and the drink sets it free."</p>

<p>"What's madness, then?" asked Janet finally. "What's raving
lunacy?"</p>

<p>Marwood sat up in some excitement.</p>

<p>"Now don't you ask me that&mdash;don't you ask me what madness
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't be personal over the stupid argument. I wish
you'd finish your book so that we could get away from
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't like the place?"</p>

<p>"I don't say that. But we've been here long enough. It's
rather lonely."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's rather lonely."</p>

<p>They both glanced round the room, the one large low living
room, as if to confirm this impression of loneliness.</p>

<p>"Fancy sitting up in bed at night and feeling the Devil
pulling the mattress from under you, or hearing an empty box
opening and shutting, or something with eight feet shuffling
round the house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Robert," said Janet, "you couldn't frighten a child with
those things, nowadays."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you? Couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not,"</p>

<p>"What would you say if I told you I saw a gigantic negress,
very lean, with a huge red turban, prying round the house and
staring in at my window?"</p>

<p>"I should say that it was a poor joke."</p>

<p>"So it is," responded Marwood grimly, "a very poor joke."</p>

<p>"Silly."</p>

<p>"Silly," agreed Marwood.</p>

<p>They sat in silence a little while.</p>

<p>It was real silence in the cottage, heavy palpable
silence.</p>

<p>That night Marwood stayed up late, writing or reading, Janet
did not know which; she heard him talking to himself&mdash;a bad
habit that had lately increased upon him, a habit to be
discouraged.</p>

<p>They awoke to snow so thick that the dawn could scarcely
penetrate the heavy chilled clouds; the fields were pure against
a dirty sky.</p>

<p>A few days off Christmas Eve now.</p>

<p>"I hope you got on all right last night," said Janet.</p>

<p>"Splendidly."</p>

<p>"Really begun the ghost story?"</p>

<p>"Really begun."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall be glad when you've finished and we can get
away."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," said Marwood. "It isn't so easy to get
away, in fact it's extraordinarily difficult."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, quite?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't keep explaining what I mean," he replied
testily.</p>

<p>She left him alone.</p>

<p>Queer how the snow added to the loneliness; they seemed
absolutely cut off from humanity; if it hadn't been for that
glimpse of the tradespeople and the postman Janet would have felt
herself completely isolated; she wanted to go to the village,
just to see people, but it was a long way and there was the snow,
and her husband didn't seem to care to be left alone.</p>

<p>"Someone might come to the door and interrupt me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not likely."</p>

<p>"You never know. The Vicar perhaps. And I really can't be
interrupted."</p>

<p>Janet stayed in.</p>

<p>That evening they sat alone round the fire; the snow had
ceased, there was a wind and a frost; they had been to the door
several times to look at the stars and to listen to the church
bells, practising for Christmas Day, that could just be heard in
the absolute stillness.</p>

<p>"Funny," said Marwood, "if something really came
along&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Robert?"</p>

<p>"Ghosts, or devils&mdash;"</p>

<p>She laughed thinly: they evaded each other's look.</p>

<p>"Mind you," Marwood added earnestly, "if any were to come, I
couldn't bear it; I've been thinking it over&mdash;and I really
couldn't."</p>

<p>Janet smiled at his joke.</p>

<p>"You aren't afraid?" she asked feebly.</p>

<p>"How can you be afraid of what you don't believe in? I never
believed in them, did I?"</p>

<p>Still they didn't look at each other; Marwood lowered his
voice and continued:</p>

<p>"What I am afraid of is <i>Fear</i>."</p>

<p>"Afraid of being afraid?" she suggested.</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;if you were afraid now, if you looked
afraid&mdash;if I saw <i>Fear</i>&mdash;anywhere," he answered
confidentially.</p>

<p>"This is foolish," said Janet stoutly. "We are really shut up
too much alone."</p>

<p>Marwood looked sullen; he remarked that he had a bad headache;
temper, translated Janet, who was beginning to be nettled
herself&mdash;and it was lonely.</p>

<p>Lonely.</p>

<p>They locked and barred and bolted it all up, they put out all
the lights but one candle, and went up to bed.</p>

<p>Janet could not get to sleep; she thought it was because the
silence was oppressive.</p>

<p>But Marwood was asleep, and dreaming, she thought, by his
mutterings and tossings.</p>

<p>Janet felt uneasy; what a lot of queer things her husband had
said lately! He wasn't really a bit like his usual level-headed
self; she would be glad when they got away from this place and
all these ghost books.</p>

<p>Then Janet heard a faint noise.</p>

<p>Outside the house.</p>

<p>A shuffling, scraping, peculiar sort of no Marwood said about
SOME thing with eight feet?</p>

<p>Janet struck a match and lit the candle by the bedside; in the
spurt of yellow light she saw her husband's face staring up from
the pillow.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," she said quickly. "Some stray dog."</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>do</i> hear it, then?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;a stray dog, I say."</p>

<p>Marwood sat up and they listened.</p>

<p>The noise seemed to encompass the house; it was as if they
were being surrounded, beleaguered in the cottage.</p>

<p>"A dog," said Marwood.</p>

<p>Then the shuffling was broken by a hoarse, quickly suppressed
laugh.</p>

<p>Janet gripped her husband's shoulder; they stared at each
other, shivering.</p>

<p>"If it is," whispered Marwood. "I can't bear it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. It ISN'T."</p>

<p>They peered forward across the murk of the room; the window
space now showed faintly luminous, a square of reddish light; at
the sight of this doubtless infernal illumination Janet
winced.</p>

<p>"You're afraid," gibbered Marwood. "I can see
that&mdash;you're afraid."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;-I'm going down to find out&mdash;"</p>

<p>He clung to her.</p>

<p>"No, you're not&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sudden clash, wail and howl tore the tension.</p>

<p>Marwood shrieked.</p>

<p>"I knew they couldn't have invented it all, I knew they'd got
the stuff somewhere! It's true! It's true!"</p>

<p>"What's true?" mumbled Janet.</p>

<p>"Devils, ghosts&mdash;there outside&mdash;legions of 'em."</p>

<p>The howl took form and substance; it became:</p>

<p>"Hark, the Herald Angels sing&mdash;"</p>

<p>With triangle and trombone accompaniment.</p>

<p>"The Waits," sighed Janet, trembling.</p>

<p>Marwood never wrote his ghost story; he composed instead an
essay on "Fear," but he would not care to have it published. You
see, he never believed they <i>were</i> the Waits.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a> "ILLUSION D'HYACINTHE BLANCHE"</h2>

<h3>A PARISIAN IDYLL&mdash;1890</h3>

<p class="first">
IT has been said of love that one of its greatest charms is
that it is a panacea against boredom, that most insidious enemy
of idle human nature.</p>

<p>And it was mainly to escape a quite definite boredom that
Harry Considine persuaded himself that he was in love with
anything so elusive, so quite impossibly difficult, so obviously
spoilt and <i>outré</i> as Thérèse Fabre.</p>

<p>He was not attracted by the fact that it was the fashion to be
in love with her, but indeed vexed that he had not made a more
exclusive choice, nor was he greatly impressed by the force of
her genius; his acknowledgment of her as one of the greatest of
actresses was a little cold.</p>

<p>It was the woman herself with her extraordinary exotic
delicacy, her air of secret magnificence, her serene and weary
loveliness&mdash;who attracted his too-sensitive judgment, his
over-fastidious taste.</p>

<p>Considine was a diplomat who had seen too much and known too
much for the measure of his youth not to overflow with experience
not often sweet.</p>

<p>He was clever and pleasant and comely in quite the right sort
of way and was assured of success in due course, for there was no
flaw in his relations, his means and his prospects.</p>

<p>But as his qualities were not of the driving, brilliant or
pushing order (he was too aristocratic and sane for anything of
that kind) the waiting period of humdrum duties was naturally
long, and as he moved comfortably from capital to capital in
elegant but subordinate employ, he was more often and more
ferociously attacked by the demon boredom.</p>

<p>And so, finding his stately steps stayed in Paris for some
considerable time, he encouraged himself to fall in love with
Thérèse Fabre.</p>

<p>He toyed with this cool passion.</p>

<p>She had her own theatre and produced strange and extravagant
dramas that showed off her curious personality. To each of them
Considine went several times, studying the actress with an almost
cruel scrutiny, rediscovering her peculiar traits under this and
that disguise.</p>

<p>Her costumes were as remarkable as the ease with which she
wore them.</p>

<p>She appeared sometimes in the most severe classic drapery,
sometimes in a baroque gown of hoops and panniers with yard-long
feathers on her head, sometimes in the stiff golden and coral
robes of a Chinese queen with her face painted to the likeness of
an Oriental mask, and sometimes in a wisp of a dress of to-day,
her features not "made up" and looking pallid and weary in the
glow of the foot-lights.</p>

<p>The <i>décor</i> of her plays was always beautiful. Considine
had seen her moving through dim enchanted forests, sleeping on
high brocaded beds, pacing rose-laden terraces, reclining in
great lacquer chairs under satin palanquins so that she was woven
into the stuff of dreams and fairy-tales, associated with vague,
unreal dim lights, with heavy perfumes and languorous music.</p>

<p>It was with a sense almost of pain that he went to his first
interview with Thérèse Fabre. He had woven so many illusions
round this enchanting figure that he had a sensitive dread of
dispelling the magic of the theatre, of looking behind the mask,
of seeing the natural stature of the woman without the
buskins.</p>

<p>Yet his desire to behold her in her natural life, to talk to
her, was imperative.</p>

<p>He was now very definitely in love.</p>

<p>She received him in a dressing-room furnished in a dull gold
colour and filled with the fumes of Eastern pastilles smoking in
a little brazier.</p>

<p>The play was over, and she reclined, wearily, on a low scarlet
divan, turned so that she could see herself in a queer oval
mirror that hung opposite.</p>

<p>She was wrapped in what seemed a straight length of
wine-coloured silk, and her maid removed, carefully and slowly,
the elaborate braids of pearls from her warm, dark, curling
hair.</p>

<p>She gave the young Englishman one glance for his grace and
distinction and another for the homage in his eyes.</p>

<p>It still never failed to please even her satiated vanity to
see that she did not disappoint as a woman the expectations she
had raised as an actress.</p>

<p>Again and again had she seen that questioning look of almost
frightened anticipation give place to the relief of rapturous
admiration. She was a Basque, triumphantly young and healthy, the
years of her conquering success coming after a girlhood of
hardship and simplicity that had left her strong and robust under
the artificial languors of her present life.</p>

<p>She gave Considine her hand; she spoke to him of her play
braid by braid the pearls slipped on to her smooth shoulders,
over her breast, on to her lap from there, her silk-spread knees.
She gathered them up and put them in an ivory box lined with blue
velvet.</p>

<p>"You send me too many flowers," she smiled. "They stifle me.
Or, rather, you do not send them to me, but to Hélène, Zaire,
Margaret, Melusine, the parts I play&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Always to you," he answered. "Directly and only to you."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she said sadly. "Only to the illusion I create."</p>

<p>"You create no illusion."</p>

<p>"Fie, do you say that I am a bad actress, then?"</p>

<p>"I say you are the thing you profess to be&mdash;it is not any
illusion."</p>

<p>She looked at him, half mocking.</p>

<p>"You thought so, till to-night."</p>

<p>"No, no," he protested.</p>

<p>"Confess that you were almost afraid to come here."</p>

<p>"Why should I be? I knew that you were young and
beautiful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you thought," she insisted, "that I might destroy your
dreams&mdash;I saw that in your eyes."</p>

<p>She suffered him to argue with her on this topic.</p>

<p>While she accepted his worship with a languid interest, she
strove to prove to him that she was for him but an illusion, a
mere figment of dreams and fancies, a symbol of beauty, of
Magic.</p>

<p>"And this beauty, this Magic is," she said, "all in the mind
of the beholder. It is you who create the creature you
admire."</p>

<p>It was sufficient to listen to her low mournful voice and to
watch the perfect woman in the perfect setting.</p>

<p>Only one thing jarred on Considine.</p>

<p>Seated on a stool, just under the gold-shaded electric light
on the dressing-table, was a girl mending lace.</p>

<p>She was very plain, and, more than plain, commonplace and
ordinary.</p>

<p>A cheap string of glass beads was round her neck. She wore an
old-fashioned blouse and skirt, the first check, the second drab,
and the street mud was on her laced boots.</p>

<p>On the carpet beside her was a fustian-looking hat, with a
gaudy dyed quill in it, and her drab coat.</p>

<p>Considine found himself obliged to look at a creature so
incongruous and displeasing; he understood that she was a
professional lace-mender, entrusted with the mending of lace too
valuable to leave the owner's possession, but he could not
understand why Thérèse Fabre tolerated her in her presence, nor
how she could endure in these austerely lovely surroundings this
blot of ordinary ugliness.</p>

<p>When he took his leave Thérèse Fabre gave him her hand
again.</p>

<p>"If you send me any more flowers let them be white hyacinths,"
she said. "I am weary of all other kinds."</p>

<p>These frail and stately blooms, the resurrection of beauty in
mid-winter, well expressed the personality of the actress.</p>

<p>She also had this pallid honey flushed whiteness warmed with
the faintest tones of amber and gold, this immaculate fragrance,
this still dignity conveyed by the pure clusters of the rich
flower.</p>

<p>Considine searched the great opulent florists' shops for white
hyacinths.</p>

<p>When slush and snow disfigured the roaring, hungry, cold
streets, and bitter winds blew the beggars into the doorways of
frozen buildings, the dressing-room of Thérèse Fabre was always
full of white hyacinths.</p>

<p>She ceased to use the exotic perfumes that effaced the
delicate odours of the flower, and her person was always
enveloped in this chill scent of the spring.</p>

<p>Considine progressed in friendship, not in love. She admitted
him into many recesses of her subtle, too-clever mind, but she
kept closed to him her heart.</p>

<p>If indeed she ever could, or would, open this to any...</p>

<p>Considine thought that, in this also, she was like the white
hyacinth, that hot-house loveliness that perishes with the first
natural warmth of spring.</p>

<p>He continued to be irritated by the presence of the
lace-mender; not always, but often, her dull ugliness of dress
and figure and face would be obtruded on him; the maid he could
accept as part of the necessary furniture of the dressing-room,
but this girl thrust forward memories of hideous things.</p>

<p>He was sure that she would go home on a packed, filthy tram,
jostled with dirty, tired people; he could imagine the gaunt,
arid house she lived in, somewhere in those desolate regions,
"the fortifications"; he could visualize her coarse food, her
whole sordid surroundings.</p>

<p>One day he found her sitting beneath a big silver bowl of the
white hyacinths.</p>

<p>The sight enraged his nerves.</p>

<p>When she had gone, he asked:</p>

<p>"Why do you have that poor girl here? Doesn't it bother you to
see her?"</p>

<p>"The lace-maker?" asked the actress indifferently. "Oh, she is
very ugly and no doubt imbecile, but she mends
excellently&mdash;lace and stockings, and even veils and
chiffons."</p>

<p>"She looks very clumsy for such delicate work," returned
Considine resentfully.</p>

<p>"You dislike her? I assure you she is to be pitied. You have
no idea how roughly she lives, how little she earns."</p>

<p>"I have," he said. "That is why I do not care to see her. She
reminds me of all that I want to forget."</p>

<p>"The next time that you come when she is here," said Thérèse
Fabre gravely, "we will put up a screen round her and tell her
that it is to prevent her being disturbed by our chatter."</p>

<p>"But she will be able to hear us just the same," objected
Considine.</p>

<p>"And do you think that she is able to understand?" smiled the
actress.</p>

<p>He did not think it likely that she would be able to
understand anything but her fine stitching; yet he was irked by
the sight of the bright lacquer screen (a deep coral red and a
notable background for white hyacinths) that he knew concealed
the bent, shabby, dull figure of the seamstress.</p>

<p>After one of his visits, very suddenly he was dismissed from
the dressing-room and any contemplation either of the
lace-mender, or the spiral gold dragons on the shining crimson
lacquer that hid her plainness, for Thérèse Fabre told him, in
one indifferent breath, that she was leaving the stage and taking
a husband.</p>

<p>This person was a strange cosmopolitan of wealth approaching
the tales of fable, of vague but Eastern nationality, of polished
manners, and a vast understanding of women.</p>

<p>The actress gave no reason for her choice which withdrew the
radiance of her kindness from so many of her adorers.</p>

<p>She said that she was tired and that this man could take her
to the kind of lotus land she loved. She was married in January
and left Paris for one of the islands in the Aegean Sea.</p>

<p>Considine almost filled the church with white hyacinths; the
bride allowed him to do this, but her bridal flowers were queer
Chinese lilies with flaming, spotted throats.</p>

<p>Considine used his not inconsiderable influence to hasten his
removal to Rome.</p>

<p>As far as he was concerned the delicate play had been serious
enough, the sting was deeper and the wound sharper than either
his pride or his affections cared to acknowledge.</p>

<p>This successful and pleasing young man felt wretchedly lonely;
he swiftly earned the reputation in the quick Italian society of
being morose.</p>

<p>And then her love letters began to arrive.</p>

<p>There very definitely opened out to him, if not a new earth,
at least, what is perhaps more important, a new heaven.</p>

<p>She wrote all the things he had hoped to hear her say; she
disclosed all the passion and tenderness he had scarcely dared
think that she possessed; she soared to the heights of those
peaks of emotion to which before she had only raised her
glance.</p>

<p>She told him that she loved him and she showed him what love
can be, in mystery, in power and eternal strength.</p>

<p>"You will think me faithless," she wrote, "but my love is a
treasure that will not bear the light of day&mdash;like fairy
gold. I could not risk that you should tire of me as a wife, or
hold me cheaply as a mistress. Love me the most difficult way,
with the love of pain and parting, of eternal separation, of
spiritual communion.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you that I was only an illusion? Preserve me
as an illusion, and I will perfume your life as the white
hyacinth perfumes the lonely woods in spring."</p>

<p>The coming of the letter was, to Considine, like the rising of
the sun out of the sea, flooding all the world with light.</p>

<p>To many men such an oblique and mysterious love affair would
have been an offence, an affectation, a puerile pretence of the
shallow wits of vanity to masquerade as passion.</p>

<p>But Considine's peculiar temperament was suited by this
indirect and subtle affair, a certain fastidious weariness of
everyday events, a certain half-cynical melancholy of
disposition, even a certain laziness of mind were well served by
the method chosen by Thérèse Fabre.</p>

<p>He answered; taking not long enough time to keep her waiting
and too long for his reply to be a mere ejaculation of surprise
or emotion.</p>

<p>She wrote again.</p>

<p>And before the Italian summer had played the blue-gold skies
to the bleached violet azure of winter, Considine's whole life
was set to the secret melody of these letters.</p>

<p>They always came in slim, smooth envelopes, written on smooth,
plain paper with no distinguishing mark beyond the perfume of
white hyacinth. Wherever Thérèse Fabre might be, the letters were
invariably sent from Paris, and it was to the address written at
the top that Considine always sent his replies, addressing them,
as she requested, to an assumed name.</p>

<p>An old servant, of priceless discretion, was, she explained,
the intermediary.</p>

<p>Considine had at first thought these precautions childish, yet
they were only what was to be expected on the part of a
Frenchwoman and an actress, and the method had conveniences;
while he watched her movements in the society "gazettes," he
always posted his letters to "Mdle Jane Mailly, 2 rue Eglantine,
Paris (VII <i>arronde</i>.)," and gradually did so mechanically,
without criticism of the method.</p>

<p>Thérèse proved herself more than a great lover; her letters
showed wisdom and the imagination of a poet.</p>

<p>She painted the ineffable luxury of her surroundings in quick,
warm words; the pink lotus and the papyrus growing out of the
glassy water at the foot of the tall Egyptian columns, the orange
groves in Sicily, the vivid fruit, first jade, then flame, amid
wax-white flowers and leaves nearly black, edging the desolation
of the gaunt scorched country, the forgotten beauty of the Black
Sea, darkly reflecting the luxuriant coast, the strange wild
splendours of Montserrat, full of mystic remembrances, the sad
glooms of ancient Moorish palaces beyond Granada, the haunted
quiet of deserted monasteries on the Iuxuriant banks of the
Rhine.</p>

<p>So, as she moved from place to place, she wrote of her
impressions, and always ended her vivid sentences with one that
seemed like a quick cry:</p>

<p>"It is all illusion, illusion! Only my love for you is real."
He recalled how she had always insisted on that word, and now she
had beguiled him into sharing her view.</p>

<p>"Illusion is the only true happiness," she wrote. "How can so
gross a thing as reality yield genuine delight?"</p>

<p>"Confess that the whiff of white hyacinth that comes to you
with this letter gives you more joy than the rich odours of the
rose that you hold in your hand, and could, if you wished, tear
to pieces.</p>

<p>"I am unattainable, yet infinitely possessed. I shall never
grow old, or stale, or commonplace&mdash;you will never weary of
me.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for me to bore you, yet I am always with
you&mdash;in the light, in the trees and flowers when the
festival lamps are lit among them, in the stars behind the cold
clouds, in the misty visions that come to you when you wake in
the night."</p>

<p>It was a year after her first letter came that he met
her&mdash;almost with a sense of shock&mdash;even of faint
dismay.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly he found himself in Athens, believing her to be
in Tunis; the date of her last letter was Tunis.</p>

<p>And then, at a cosmopolitan gathering to which he had gone
with a lively apprehension of boredom, he saw her across the
room.</p>

<p>And recognized her with a pang that was as if she had subtly
been translated into a stranger, so different was the woman he
beheld with his outer senses to the woman of the letters he loved
with his inner senses. Illusion! Illusion!</p>

<p>She greeted him with a composure that was almost too perfect;
his vanity was irritated. He looked at the fair still hand that
had so often traced the words, "I love you, I love you," coupled
with his name, and thought how ironical it was that he must not
touch it, save in the lightest of greeting.</p>

<p>Not only was she absolutely at her ease, she even contrived an
effect of vagueness; as if she had almost forgotten him and was
trying to recall him as she spoke.</p>

<p>This piqued him, and when the shifting groups Ieft them for a
moment almost alone, he showed it in a faint hostility.</p>

<p>"The only happiness is illusion," he quoted her own words.
"How far you carry your cult."</p>

<p>"My cult?" she queried lazily.</p>

<p>"Your mystery, if you will," he returned.</p>

<p>"I do not think that I have ever been mysterious with you,"
she replied.</p>

<p>This spurred Considine to still further directness.</p>

<p>"You do not use white hyacinth perfume to-night," he said. A
wrinkle of bewilderment troubled her smooth brows.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, you are the man who used to send me white
hyacinths," she reflected. "I remember&mdash;those chill spring
flowers&mdash;have not you, like myself, found the perfume rather
sickly by now?"</p>

<p>He thought that she was pushing her perversity too far.</p>

<p>"I am glad, however, that you still use it on your letters,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Letters?" She echoed the word as if he had affronted her.
"But I consider perfumed stationery so vulgar."</p>

<p>She turned away as if she did not wish to further speak to
him, and he looked after her tall silver figure with
resentment.</p>

<p>The mask was too firmly fastened for his liking; she might, by
a smile, a hand-clasp, a glance, have varied it for a second;
surely he had deserved as much as that.</p>

<p>She was too discreet; even Considine, man of the world and
diplomat, disliked a woman over-prudent in her love affairs.</p>

<p>The next morning he received another passionate letter, posted
in Paris, forwarded from Rome; before he replied to it he
resolved to see Thérèse again.</p>

<p>Enquiries at the house of the mutual acquaintance where they
had met before revealed that she had left Athens.</p>

<p>"I think she has gone yachting with her husband," said the
lady. "No one really sees much of her since her marriage."</p>

<p>Considine could scarcely conceal his chagrin.</p>

<p>"Thérèse is so successful, isn't she?" continued his hostess
with a spice of malice. "She always does the right thing."</p>

<p>"As far as effect is concerned?" asked Considine sourly. The
lady laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, she has had the supreme good taste to fall in
love with her husband."</p>

<p>Considine did not like the sound of that; Thérèse was
evidently too perfect an illusionist.</p>

<p>But he could not resist her letters; she had drawn him into an
enchantment from which he could in no wise escape.</p>

<p>He wrote to her, reproaching her with her behaviour at their
meeting, and she replied with a sweet cloud of mystical
excuses.</p>

<p>A month later he was again in Paris; there was now no object
in his avoidance of this city, but it depressed him. The season
was once more winter, a chill leaden period when the streets
looked squalid and filthy, the ancient buildings iron hard and
iron cold. Considine had the fancy to discover the rue
Eglantine.</p>

<p>A vague and languid fancy at first, but startled into activity
by the fact that no one knew of such a street.</p>

<p>Thereupon he took uncommon trouble to trace it, and discovered
it to be in an outlying and very poor district.</p>

<p>He had not thought that any former servant of Thérèse would be
living in poverty, and curiosity urged him to find the place
where he had addressed so many love letters, <i>the</i> love
letters of his life.</p>

<p>It was a pitiful pilgrimage; the fastidious young man
shuddered at the ugly windings of the gaunt streets, the high
grim buildings, the greasy roads and metallic tram lines, the
cheap shops and drab crowds.</p>

<p>The rue Eglantine was a slum; the number he looked for was a
sad tenement house; what ironic caprice had induced Thérèse to
use this sordid corner for their beautiful correspondence? What
former servant of hers could have been left in this
indigence?</p>

<p>A trickling rain was falling, a north wind whistling;
everything looked mud colour in the twilight.</p>

<p>Considine thought of her letters, of the blue sea, where she
now was, of white hyacinths. What poor old hag was the depository
of her secret&mdash;their secret?</p>

<p>He asked the frowsy portress if she knew the name of Mlle Jane
Mailly?</p>

<p>The woman jerked a thumb up the sombre stairs, and with a
glare of suspicion, said:</p>

<p>"Third <i>étage</i>, first door."</p>

<p>So Jane Mailly was the name of the go-between&mdash;perhaps
she even opened his letters...it was a curious, a repulsive
thought...</p>

<p>He toiled up the cold, enclosed stairs, lit only by a thin jet
of gas on each floor.</p>

<p>"Illusion!" he said to himself. "Illusion! What illusion could
carry anyone away from this?"</p>

<p>He knocked at the first door of the third <i>étage</i>; he
searched in his pocket-book for money; he would be more generous
than Thérèse had been to this miserable "confidante" of her queer
choice.</p>

<p>There was a gentle shuffling on the other side of the door. It
was opened by the lace-mender.</p>

<p>She wore the same skirt, the same blouse, but now spectacles
further disfigured her strained eyes. As she stared at him in
dumb fright, one horrible glimpse showed him the wretched room
behind her; the table with a pile of mending and a packet of
thin, smooth, expensive note-paper, a rickety shelf where stood
some cracked crockery, a few thumbed guide books; he could read
the names on the back, staring at him with brutal mockery:
"Sicily," "Algiers," "Spain," "Egypt."</p>

<p>As Jane Mailly shrank back and back before him and the agony
of his amaze, she knocked against the loaded table.</p>

<p>A bottle of cheap perfume rolled off and spilled between them
on the dusty drugget. An unbearable odour filled the man's
nostrils; stupidly he picked the bottle up; stupidly he noted
that it had cost ten francs (a long time to earn that, Jane
Mailly, mending lace) and was labelled "Illusion d'hyacinthe
blanche."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a> A TRAVELLER'S TRUE TALE</h2>

<h3>THE EDUCATION OF A MAN OF QUALITY&mdash;1800</h3>

<p class="first">
AS the horse struggled round the uphill bend of the snowy road,
the wheel of the coach twisted over the broken linch-pin and the
heavy vehicle tipped to the ground; the three occupants climbed
out and consulted with the coachman and postillion; they were yet
in sight of a wintry sea; a chill wind was blowing sharply over
the bare, rising fields, the moon shining cold, clear in a
silvery void of sky over the North Foreland; the travellers
hunched themselves into their coats, thrust their hands in their
pockets and walked up and down the road where the first
snowdrifts had been hardened by a light frost; they comprised a
young gentleman who was important enough to travel with an
<i>incognito</i>&mdash;Mr. John Falconer, his body-servant, and
tutor. This latter, Dr. Sopher, grumbled:</p>

<p>"Sir, this might have been foreseen&mdash;-a crazy hired
carriage! How much more reasonable to have spent the night in
Mary-gate!"</p>

<p>"The fellows here," replied the young man, "say it is only a
matter of half an hour to fetch a wheelwright."</p>

<p>"'Tis likely. But who, sir, will relish even a brief delay in
this forlorn spot, encompassed by the night, the winter, after
thirteen hours in that murderous Dutch packet?"</p>

<p>Mr. Falconer replied with dry irony:</p>

<p>"Sir, we have travelled two years round Europe and this is our
first adventure&mdash;nay, our first discomfort."</p>

<p>"'Tis to be hoped, sir," snapped the indignant clergyman,
"that the world has become sufficiently civilized for gentlemen
to travel without fear of one or the other&mdash;and this, sir,
is a mere vulgar mishap, due entirely to your unaccountable
desire to make a push for London."</p>

<p>Dr. Sopher, with this, jerked up his coat collar, pulled down
his hat flaps, passed a rug round his body and seated himself on
the roadside with grim resignation, to await the resumption of
the tedious journey.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I blame myself, sir," admitted Mr. John Falconer, who
was possessed of sensibility and delicacy, and who perceived that
the tutor, who had suffered severely during the passage from
Helvoetsluys, really appeared ill; "and I will endeavour to
discover some shelter; there is surely a house or cottage in the
neighbourhood."</p>

<p>He made enquiries of the coachman (the postillion having
departed to fetch the wheelwright) and learnt that in a hollow of
the Downs, not half a mile away, was a mansion belonging to a Sir
William Taverner who, if not there himself, would have servants
in charge; Mr. Falconer examined the wheel, he perceived that it
would take some time to mend, that indeed further progress that
night might be impossible, and, telling his servant to do what
was possible for Dr. Sopher, he set over across the hill-side
fields in the direction the coachman had indicated.</p>

<p>His rank was sufficient to admit him into palaces and he had
no hesitation in demanding the hospitality of a country gentleman
of Kent, and stepped out briskly across the wide, solitary,
moonlit downs.</p>

<p>He reflected, smiling, on his own recent remark&mdash;two
years travelling in Europe and this their first accident...the
dull, slow years, the young man had visited Electoral and Royal
Courts, heard the Opera at Venice, examined the ruins at Rome,
seen a royal wedding at Vienna, pried into the rich confusion of
costly churches, the damp glooms of catacombs, the varied
splendours of picture galleries and cabinets of curiosities, been
caressed by the most polished society, smiled on with gracious
partiality by delicious ladies and found it all very tedious.</p>

<p>And not one adventure had broken the monotony of
well-arranged, well-introduced progress, no episode had occurred
which had aroused his passions, his wonder or his desires.</p>

<p>He had seen, heard, learned nothing that would make him
forget, for one disloyal moment, Henrietta Pentelow.</p>

<p>As he breasted the bare shoulder of the downs he paused,
oblivious of the stinging cold, forgetful of his errand, and took
from the pocket of his travelling-coat a small gold snuff-box
enamelled with a tiny picture of <i>amorini</i>, rosy, tender as
flower petals; he opened this and gazed with delight at the
contents, a male sapphire of Indian blue.</p>

<p>The moonlight struck this magnificent gem with cold azure
fire, from every cunningly-cut facet flashed a long sparkle of
beamy light; the blue of the rare stone was more than a colour,
it was an emotion.</p>

<p>For Henrietta Pentelow.</p>

<p>A year ago he had sent her another such jewel, which he had
bought from an impoverished collector in Torino...her letter of
loving thanks lay with her other letters, all too few, on his
heart; he had found the second sapphire at Prague among the
merchandise of an old, secret Jew; these gorgeous jewels were to
hang in her cars, to cast blue shadows on her perfect neck, to
gleam beneath the silken lustre of her hooped curls and her
bridal wreath.</p>

<p>The young man returned the snuff-box, the gem safe within, to
his pocket and, musing sweetly, continued on his way; he was soon
out of sight of the road, the coach, his companions, the sea;
alone on the wintry downs beneath the November moon. Falconer was
at last free to marry Henrietta Pentelow; six weeks ago he had
been of age; his famous title, his great wealth, his huge
estates, were his to deal with as he would; he could lay all at
the feet of Henrietta Pentelow...the sweet, still, tranquil
maiden...This young man was of such importance that his guardians
had forbidden his marriage with his love because she was the
daughter of a private gentleman, and he had had to endure these
weary two years with Dr. Sopher&mdash;but that was over;
to-morrow he would be in London where Henrietta Pentelow was
waiting for her love, her fortune to be put into her hand, like a
rose for her heart.</p>

<p>A gather of wind that rushed by his ears and sent his coat
flapping reminded him of his immediate business; he had, absorbed
in enchanting reveries, wandered without regard to the
instructions of the Marygate coachman; glancing about him he
perceived that he had climbed to a considerable height and stood
(as it seemed) directly under the moon, with, beneath, a
gently-sloping hollow in which, clearly showing in this pale
light, was a small house set in the interlaced thickness of the
black boughs of a close grove of nearly leafless trees, and
approached by a bridle-path.</p>

<p>If he had been in Italy or Germany Falconer would have
considered this scene very romantic and affording some prospects
of adventure, but as he stood in an English field, a few miles
from the busy town of Marygate, he merely reflected that the
house was very retired, and inconveniently situated. Indeed,
having traversed Europe without encountering any of those odd or
peculiar incidents, people or scenes that he had often read of in
the books labelled <i>Travellers' True Tales</i>, he had ceased
to expect anything extraordinary, either in nature or
humanity.</p>

<p>But, as he descended the hill, the danger of footpads did
occur to him; he was resolute and sensible, and he looked to the
pistol at his belt and put his gloved hand on his stout
travelling-sword...it was not likely ruffians would lie at catch
in a place so remote, yet there lingered a menace in this
complete solitude.</p>

<p>A few moments' brisk walking brought him to the little wood,
which reminded him (he being newly instructed in the classics) of
that passage in <i>Lucan</i> that speaks of the dark groves that
shelter cruel priests whose sacrifices to unknown powers smear
the black tree trunks with smoking, human blood, or of those
sombre forests in the Vosges that were so dense and gloomy that
the Roman legions quailed as they proceeded...these similes were
too grandiose for the occasion since this was but a group of
English oaks in a hollow of English hills.</p>

<p>An unpretentious iron gate hung open on the gradual ascent of
the path to the trim mansion; the moonlight showed the grey
façade with the windows discouragingly shuttered; the silence was
only disturbed by the intermittent passage of the wind through
the almost bare trees and a shower of dank leaves tumbling to the
frost-hard ground.</p>

<p>Falconer hesitated.</p>

<p>His errand appeared futile; he considered it might be wiser to
return to the road and wait the accommodation of the coach, for
Sir William Taverner was obviously not in residence, and, should
the mansion be inhabited at all there seemed not much prospect of
obtaining here any but a bleak hospitality; Falconer, fastidious,
elegant, luxurious, did not relish the thought of a night in this
small disused-seeming house; rather the hired coach that brought
him every moment nearer to Henrietta Pentelow...</p>

<p>He disliked, however, an unfinished errand and was, moreover,
impelled by a vague curiosity.</p>

<p>So, he approached the house.</p>

<p>The trees formed a semicircle before the closed door with the
classic porch, the blank windows; there was no indication of
life.</p>

<p>But on the lowest of the three shallow steps lay a dark object
which the moonlight outlined in black shadow.</p>

<p>Falconer observed that this was a man's gauntlet; he picked it
up and could have vowed that it came from his own glover in St.
James's Street; it certainly did not belong to a servant.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this discovery Falconer walked round the house
with the glove in his hand; at the back of the mansion a low
terrace and a small plot of grass divided the house from the
encompassing wood, all in the heavy shadow cast by the building
which reached the thin dark interwoven shadows flung from the
sighing boughs of the thick close oak trees.</p>

<p>Four windows gave on to this terrace; the last of them was
unshuttered and disclosed a feeble illumination; Falconer
advanced briskly and struck on the window-frame; the room was
concealed by curtains between which the faint glimmer of light
was revealed.</p>

<p>Falconer's knock was answered by a woman's low cry of alarm,
so doleful and penetrating that Falconer felt himself impelled to
push open the unlatched window and enter the room.</p>

<p>The scene which he beheld was not extraordinary; the room
appeared to have been furnished by an ordinary upholsterer;
hangings, furniture, were commonplace. The wall facing the window
was filled by folding doors, slightly ajar; a modest fire glowed
on the ash-strewn hearth; on a small side-table was a tea
equipage and cakes, wine bottles and sweetmeats; on a chair were
coats, hats and walking canes. The lady who had cried out had
disappeared&mdash;through the folding-doors, no doubt. Falconer
gazed at the only occupant of the room; a gentleman who reclined
on a sophy by the fire and returned the scrutiny with a keen,
inquisitive, mocking glance.</p>

<p>"The Devil must have sent you here," remarked this
personage.</p>

<p>"Sir, I trust not," replied Falconer, who was not used to
liberties and disliked ribaldry. "Are you Sir William
Taverner?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I am not."</p>

<p>"Is this that gentleman's house?"</p>

<p>"It is not."</p>

<p>"Then I have mistook my way."</p>

<p>"You have indeed. Taverner's place is in the other direction.
Did I not say that the Devil had guided you?"</p>

<p>A TRAVELLER'S TRUE TALE 217</p>

<p>"For your convenience?" asked Falconer, haughtily, resenting
the other's easy, jeering, cold tone.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Though, no doubt, you came here for your own."</p>

<p>"To ask an ordinary courtesy. A trivial accident has overtaken
me."</p>

<p>"I," replied the lolling gentleman, with an added depth of
sarcastic scorn, "have been overtaken by an accident that is not
trivial."</p>

<p>Falconer approached him; he was in shadow, for the one lamp
was concealed (oddly) behind the tea urn on the table beyond the
sophy, and his person was partially hidden by a light dimity
wrapper, such as Falconer knew as hairdressers' or barbers' bibs,
which had evidently been flung hastily over his shoulders; apart
from this unusual garment the man on the sophy made a figure
familiar to Falconer, that of a fine gentleman, handsome,
fashionably attired; even the uncertain light could not disguise
his uncommon pallor, this and the barber's wrap were all that was
remarkable, in Falconer's eyes, about the stranger who added,
with an unpleasant sneer:</p>

<p>"You are very young, are you not?"</p>

<p>Young enough to blush at this; Falconer was almost stung into
declaring his rank which was such as would bring this insolent
lounging fellow to his feet, but disdained that expedient and
drily explained his errand and his need; with his hat in his hand
he stood erect, indifferent, disliking the moment, too proud to
notice the other's sharp appraisal of his person and
appointments, both of which were extremely good to contemplate;
Falconer was as comely as he was elegant and had that cold proud
air that gracefully disguises the warm romantic passions of the
young English aristocrat.</p>

<p>"I cannot assist you," remarked the stranger.</p>

<p>Falconer bowed stiffly; he then noticed the glove he carried
with his hat.</p>

<p>"I found this on your step," he said, very severe at the
other's rebuff, and was taking his leave when the lolling
gentleman added:</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Place it beside me. You, I was about to say, can
assist me."</p>

<p>"I regret my time is hardly at my own disposal."</p>

<p>"Oblige me," said the stranger, "and move the lamp from behind
the urn."</p>

<p>As Falconer hesitated, the other added:</p>

<p>"As a favour."</p>

<p>Falconer went behind the sophy and brought the lamp forward so
that the coarse yellow light fell over the face now upturned
towards him; a face of considerable beauty set in an expression
of resolution and self-mocking, but a face colourless indeed,
with a faint distortion about the wide nostrils and deep-cut lips
that were of a hue Falconer's brief experience had not seen on a
human countenance before...the ringlets on the low forehead were
dank with sweat, and there was a sinister darkness beneath the
handsome grey eyes.</p>

<p>"You are ill," murmured Falconer, bending down.</p>

<p>The other, gazing up, smiled.</p>

<p>"I have been murdered."</p>

<p>Falconer set down the lamp and snatched off the hairdresser's
wrap with great expedition; he saw then the reason for this hasty
concealment; the gentleman's cravat, shirt and waistcoat were
open, and he was holding to his breast with both hands a sponge
and several napkins; the blood had already penetrated these and
soaked on to his pale cloth coat and breeches.</p>

<p>"That glove," he said, "belongs to my murderer."</p>

<p>"How can I help you?" asked Falconer, pale himself, but calm
as became his breeding. "You are not alone? I heard a lady's
voice? Has a surgeon been sent for?"</p>

<p>"You heard a lady," replied the wounded man. "She and I are
alone in this house. And have been so alone since early
afternoon. It is impossible to send for assistance. Odd one lives
so long, eh?"</p>

<p>He sighed; Falconer observed that he was making severe efforts
to speak; his voice was faint, uneven.</p>

<p>"I must be succinct. And mysterious. I'll not know your name
or you mine&mdash;I am in a confounded predicament," he shifted
the napkins at his breast, fought down a spasm of faintness and
added with casual contempt, "Damn the women."</p>

<p>"I dare swear the women you are involved with are damned
already," remarked Falconer, stern in his young virtue and his
steady fixed love.</p>

<p>"A wise, sober remark, boy," mocked the other, "but I, as you
said just now, have little time at my disposal. I am dying fast.
I believe only my will has kept me alive so long. I was
resolved"&mdash;he struggled with his breath&mdash;"to find some
expedient&mdash;then&mdash;the Devil&mdash;sent you."</p>

<p>He moved his bloodstained hand towards the glasses on the
table beside him; Falconer found a flask of <i>aqua vitae</i>,
poured some out and offered it to those grey lips.</p>

<p>"A drop only...I must keep my wits clear, A few words will
explain...an ordinary situation, eh? A certain lady's husband
pursued us here, set on me before I could draw...escaped."</p>

<p>"Leaving his wife in so horrible a plight?" asked Falconer,
revolted at these ugly-tempered scenes thus evoked.</p>

<p>"He could not find her...one has one's places of
concealment...I observed him coming...besides, she was not his
wife."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but, of course, I could not explain this without
revealing the lady's identity...Confound these intrigues!...to
what airy figures have I sacrificed my ease and life."</p>

<p>Falconer perceived the coil, he did not perceive how he could
unravel it, though his generosity was stirred by the thought of
the trapped woman's agony...she must be exposed to all the
practices of scorn and ignominy.</p>

<p>"In brief," smiled the dying man, "my mistress has been alone
in this house with me for&mdash;a cycle of torment&mdash;she
loves me, but also her reputation; she knows her dishonour would
involve others&mdash;the poor fond fool has a husband,
children&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She could have escaped?"</p>

<p>"She was simple enough to endeavour to preserve me&mdash;and
now it is late, eh? We came here on foot, leaving a carriage on
the high road to Marygate; she meant to have returned hours ago,
she was, in fact, leaving when that blundering rustical fellow
arrived...now the worst mischief has befallen us."</p>

<p>He leant back exhausted; the blood oozed unheeded through his
slack fingers; a faintness was on his spirits.</p>

<p>"It seems, on your own confession," said Falconer, sternly,
"that you have seduced married women to confusion and shame, and
I take you for one of those rake-hell fellows whose barbarous and
brutish ends arouse not compassion but disgust."</p>

<p>"I'm past your moralities," the other smiled, wryly. "I ask
you this&mdash;as one gentleman to another&mdash;will you, when I
am dead&mdash;she'll not leave me sooner&mdash;take this lady
away?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thank you&mdash;this will pass for the work of thieves.
I'll not be found for days as this house is credited not to be
used&mdash;we came from London to-day&mdash;by different roads,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Where am I to take the lady?" Falconer abhorred this
duty.</p>

<p>The dying man had now a sharp difficulty with his speech, yet
forced himself to put his design into execution.</p>

<p>"There's a house near Canterbury&mdash;where they give a great
entertainment&mdash;she'll tell you&mdash;they expect
her&mdash;take her there."</p>

<p>"But how?" asked Falconer, quite unused to intrigue and in a
tumult of alarm and disgust. "And what tale shall I tell?"</p>

<p>The other grinned; his eyes gazed hollowly through his fallen
hair, he pressed his fingers on the bandages beneath his
disordered attire; he faced his inexorable foe.</p>

<p>"Cannot you think that out? No&mdash;well, I must&mdash;tact,
discretion, eh? You'll learn in time."</p>

<p>Falconer stood disdainful; with a deep inner joy he thought of
Henrietta Pentelow who moved in such a different world from this
world that had been so brutally revealed to him&mdash;Henrietta,
in her muslin and swansdown, who would be, even at this moment,
safe in her tender home, among her young sisters, rapturously
awaiting his return...To give himself courage and fortitude (for
he disliked all of this, felt sickened, outraged, struck) he put
his hand in his pocket and caressed the enamelled snuff-box that
contained the Indian sapphire, while he listened to the wounded
man's instructions. And, as he listened, Falconer could not
resist an admiration for one he had already decided was a very
worthless fellow, the victim of his vile passions, the cause of
ruin to frail women. For, with infinite bravery, his companion
strove against pain and death, with clear composure and scornful
self-control he conceived and expounded his plans; and there was,
even in this moment of his overthrow and agony, a grace, a
gaiety, a charm in his air, that accorded well with the beauty of
that person avenging jealousy had so harshly destroyed; no
defection lowered the insolence with which he held off a fate
like to have broken all patience.</p>

<p>For the first time Falconer learnt more of life than was
contained in the books selected for him by Dr. Sopher, in the
civil conversation of modish society&mdash;in the girlish
adoration of Henrietta Pentelow&mdash;learnt something of the
expedients of illicit passion and the reckless ingenuity of a
practised rake.</p>

<p>For a year these two had been secret lovers, though he, at
least, had not been faithful to the dishonouring hidden vows;
through his contrivance both had been asked to a marriage
entertainment at the mansion of an acquaintance; her husband was
abroad, and she had travelled with servants&mdash;women, a
cousin&mdash;"all the panoply of virtue," in sedate safety as far
as five miles or so from Canterbury, then, a feigned attack by
his hired ruffians&mdash;cut traces, disarmed grooms, a hubbub,
and the lover neatly to the rescue&mdash;a skilfully organized
confusion, panic&mdash;the lady snatched up&mdash;he would escort
her to their common destination&mdash;nay, servants as well, for
decorum, then the valets outridden&mdash;his swift light carriage
ready at a lonely bend&mdash;the country cut across&mdash;his
desolate pleasure-house reached&mdash;the light carriage ordered
again for two hours later (it waited in vain, eh? and not long,
Jewel had his orders&mdash;"Whenever I am late, slip away"), with
the most moderate luck they should have reached their destination
unquestioned as to honour&mdash;Oh, an alarming experience, the
wrong turn, a lame horse, a rest at an inn, the public
stage,&mdash;"Eh, you see, as easy as that?"</p>

<p>"All this for one stolen meeting?" asked Falconer, amazed,
disgusted.</p>

<p>"You understand nothing," the dying man assured him, and
fainted.</p>

<p>Falconer rubbed his drawn lips and damp temples with <i>aqua
vitae</i>, and endeavoured to staunch the flowing blood; he was
horrified by the aspect of death, the loneliness of the scene,
the tragedy of the circumstances, but resolved to act as a man of
breeding; he wondered at the woman&mdash;how could she leave so
long her dying lover?...these fierce, yet coward, passions were
new to him.</p>

<p>As the gentleman sighed back to a feeble consciousness,
Falconer voiced this question.</p>

<p>"She is in the next room, where I ordered her when we heard
your knock," was the whispered answer. "I make them obey me. She
is not to come until I summon her."</p>

<p>"She thinks of her reputation," suggested Falconer, sadly.
"What else has she to think of? I suppose, you&mdash;can hardly
guess&mdash;what they become&mdash;poor, slight, silly wantons,
when they lose their reputations."</p>

<p>Falconer had guessed but never realized.</p>

<p>"You will not ask who she is&mdash;she will wear her
riding-mask&mdash;a married woman, remember,
well-born&mdash;older than you&mdash;with
children&mdash;brothers, a sister&mdash;all shamed, blighted, if
this is discovered."</p>

<p>He struggled up on his elbow and, with a firm effort, gasped
out instructions.</p>

<p>"You will say&mdash;you met her&mdash;on the road. I left
her&mdash;hours before&mdash;for some other assignation, perhaps;
leave that&mdash;she was separated from her
servants&mdash;thrown&mdash;nothing to connect her with
me&mdash;eh, you've some wits, patch that up&mdash;I've known a
worse tale serve when a woman is suspected. And she has never
been blown upon."</p>

<p>He coughed into his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I've nearly finished&mdash;call her&mdash;her
mask&mdash;"</p>

<p>Falconer knocked on the inner door which still stood ajar. She
must have overheard everything.</p>

<p>"Madame, you are to come out. And wear your mask and
riding-hood. I am a stranger who does not pretend to your
acquaintance, but I desire to help you."</p>

<p>The young man was proud of these sentences which he delivered
in a steady voice, though awed by the situation, he eagerly
desired to conduct himself in a manly and generous spirit.</p>

<p>The lady entered immediately; she must have been waiting
behind the doors; she was sedulously disguised, a deep
riding-hood, <i>calèche</i>, as they were named that year,
stiffened with whalebone, was pulled over her face which was
further concealed by one of those wizards ladies used to protect
their complexions from the rigours of the climate.</p>

<p>A breath of horror seemed to enter with her, invisible
disasters to lurk in the darkness of the room where she had
waited; Falconer saw her eyes flashing through the mask holes in
the depths of her hood; she took no heed of the man on the
sophy.</p>

<p>"How whimsical that your grace should come here."</p>

<p>"You know me?" Falconer had never considered this possible
complication.</p>

<p>"I met your grace at Court. My name would shock you."</p>

<p>"Hush," murmured Falconer, "I'll not know it, madame, and do
you forget mine...I travel <i>incognito</i> as John
Falconer."</p>

<p>"You do well," replied the lady, "to overcast your quality
since you are so high a prize in so many markets."</p>

<p>The youth was deeply outraged by these words, which struck in
so ghastly a manner into this scene.</p>

<p>"You heard what Charles named me?" added the
lady&mdash;"light, wanton, foolish...such are my titles after
obsequious affection and obedience."</p>

<p>"He is dying," said Falconer, "and the conduct of this affair
falls on me."</p>

<p>The woman moved to the sophy and bent above her lover who
appeared to be dozing; he had slipped sideways into the
cushions.</p>

<p>"I have watched him die&mdash;for hours," she said. "Charles,
is it time to say farewell?"</p>

<p>She bent lower.</p>

<p>"He is dead. Charles is dead. Vast passions, high designs and
rich beauties die with Charles."</p>

<p>Falconer was horrified as fascinated by her steadfast
heartlessness.</p>

<p>"He died, madame, with incredible constancy and valour...does
not something smite you that he might have been preserved had you
fetched help?"</p>

<p>"I could not do that without blasting myself."</p>

<p>"But, madame, at the very height and felicity of love how
could you consider so base a detail?"</p>

<p>The woman said, as the dead man had said:</p>

<p>"You understand nothing."</p>

<p>Falconer offered to adjust the collapsed figure decently on
the sophy, but she stayed him, quietly.</p>

<p>"Leave him so that it seems an unperceived crime."</p>

<p>She raked out the fire, a dark shrouded figure with the
monstrous hood; she turned down the lamp; they stood in a
darkness flecked with only a mournful gleam of light from the
fading embers.</p>

<p>"You are fortunate in not suffering most intensely," remarked
Falconer, sternly.</p>

<p>"My suffering may find expression hereafter. I end a
servitude. All Charles told you of me was lies."</p>

<p>"Yet lies for your service since he was past any ends of his
own." Falconer was earnest to be gone from this dreadful house;
he felt unsteady and uncertain in his resolves, at once awed by,
and hostile to, the shrouded woman.</p>

<p>"Come, madame, let us put in practice the expedients of your
friend...I am to take you to your destination with a blown-up
tale&mdash;"</p>

<p>She crept to his side.</p>

<p>"I know your Henrietta Pentelow."</p>

<p>"Forbear that name, madame, for pity."</p>

<p>"Do you then value in women nothing but their ignorance?"</p>

<p>With this ambiguous remark she glided on to the terrace.
Falconer followed her, less uneasy when he was beneath the sky,
though the dark bough moaning in the moonlight, the drift of drab
leaves, the encompassing embrace of the winter-dead forest could
not brighten his dampened spirit.</p>

<p>"Your grace has been notably faithful&mdash;you have resisted
two years and many temptations, and returned to marry this little
creature whom many do not consider seductive."</p>

<p>"Madame, if you continue on this theme, I may acquit myself of
my obligation to you."</p>

<p>They followed the short way through the wood; an unseen
screech owl greeted them from the tangle of branches, Falconer
was startled; the lady laughed.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she said, "your Henrietta had learned something
while you were away&mdash;something of what you have learnt
to-night?"</p>

<p>"I can have no such gross imagination."</p>

<p>"Your grace is romantical. But, be at rest&mdash;your
Henrietta is unchanged, docile, sweet&mdash;a doll baby, a
smiling moppet&mdash;she will make a pretty little Duchess."</p>

<p>They were clear of the whispering wood, of the creaking, open
iron gate, and out upon the moonlit downs; Falconer did not look
back at the house that contained the murdered man; he wished to
be staunch to his promise; but, temperate and orderly himself,
was in a confusion before these thoughtless, prodigal people, at
once gay and tragic, and this amazing mesh of circumstance into
which he had strayed...he thought of the broken coach, of Dr.
Sopher, of the high road, as the incidents of another world...of
London and Henrietta Pentelow waiting for him, as of another
world yet; this was his first adventure, his first experience of
the horrible, the marvellous, the fantastic; nor did the
commonplace surrounding of down and sky mitigate his amazement,
for this had changed into a dreadful bleakness; the moon appeared
to languish in a blank sky, the hillside was covered with grass
withered to the root.</p>

<p>They hastened; he had forgotten the way, but she could find
it; they hastened, further and further from the scene of her
tragic mischance.</p>

<p>"All Charles told you was false&mdash;will you hear another
story? One fiction goes as neatly as another. He was my husband
and in a moment of jealousy I slew him&mdash;"</p>

<p>She spoke wildly now and he judged her to be wavering,
trembling to tears.</p>

<p>"Hush, I will not learn of your story, nor of you&mdash;that
confession is counterfeit&mdash;I am to save you, if I can."</p>

<p>They gained the road which was not so far as his imagination
had conceived it; the coach was ready, his servant anxiously
looking out for him; Dr. Sopher, on a disgust at the long delay,
had pettishly returned to the comfort of the harbour inn,
trudging with dudgeon to his bed; easier then for Falconer,
explanations to servants need not be more than brief, nor any
question of the unmasking of the lady arise; they took their
seats in the coach which started on the London road, swinging, to
Falconer, through the dingy, insipid depression of a
nightmare.</p>

<p>They sat opposite each other; she, one with the darkness of
the interior; he hoped that he would never have a closer
knowledge of her than he now possessed. Sometimes she leaned
forward to view the passing grey monotony of the landscape and to
enquire of the way, and then he saw, in a fascination, the quick
movement of her eyes through the mask holes.</p>

<p>Once she discovered a red smear on her small bare hand, and
wiped it off carefully, diligently, with a crumpled handkerchief;
once she bent towards the window on some impatience and he saw a
shaft of blue light at her bosom; a jewel had swung free from her
cloak and dangled in the moon-mist that fitfully penetrated the
coach.</p>

<p>A blue jewel that seemed a body of azure flame bursting out of
the colourless gloom; the companion to the sapphire Falconer had
lovingly concealed in his pocket.</p>

<p>"You had that from Henrietta Pentelow!" he exclaimed, on a
cry.</p>

<p>Her swift hand hid the gem, eclipsed the fire.</p>

<p>"You know it? Your gift? It has too bold and rich a lustre for
a young maid's wearing."</p>

<p>"Why did she give it to you?" asked Falconer,
passionately.</p>

<p>"Ask her."</p>

<p>"There could be no reason&mdash;no possible reason why she
should part with my gift&mdash;so valuable, so rare."</p>

<p>"There might be many reasons, your grace is so young, so
inexperienced, you trust women too utterly&mdash;you left your
Henrietta for two years, remember, and Charles was most
accomplished."</p>

<p>"But, how do these names come together?"</p>

<p>"If we were rivals for the favours of Charles, she might have
given me this as a bribe for silence, eh? Supposing I discovered
her with Charles&mdash;and she so anxious to secure your grace,
the finest match in England?"</p>

<p>Nothing could have sounded uglier in the ears of the
sensitive, honourable youth than this; in the harshest tones he
had ever used to a woman he commanded her silence; he was aware
that never would he know the truth of her story, at once trivial
and horrible, nor how she came by his Henrietta's jewel; but, as
if she read this sad conviction of his, she said:</p>

<p>"Some day you will know everything."</p>

<p>Then, retired into her hood, she began to sigh and weep, but
not without a desperate attempt at control; Falconer listened to
her soft and broken lamentation, her ejaculations of distress
that contained the name of her lover, her whisperings of reproach
as if she threatened herself for her cowardice.</p>

<p>They reached the house to which she had directed the
coachman&mdash;a formal, cheerful mansion in pleasant parkland;
the lady appeared to recover, if not her spirits, her courage,
and ordered the coach to halt at the gates&mdash;she would go in
alone&mdash;she would make her own tale; as she said this, there
rang foolishly in Falconer's mind&mdash;<i>Travellers' True
Tales</i>&mdash;he could have related one himself now.</p>

<p>She was thrusting a cold object into his hand.</p>

<p>"It is right I should return this."</p>

<p>As he gazed at the sapphire and the snapped chain, she was
running towards the house; lights flashed from the lower windows,
the handsome door admitted her immediately; Falconer continued a
detestable journey, after asking the postillion:</p>

<p>"What is the name of this house?"</p>

<p>"Merrion Court, sir."</p>

<p>Arrived in London, confused from disordered slumbers in the
carriage, Falconer stirred himself to shake off infamous dreams;
a midday visit to a prim house in Queen Street gave him the news
that Miss Pentelow was out of town, her family on their estate;
uneasy but resolute he waited on his uncle and late guardian,
Colonel Douglas; this gentleman's greeting reminded him that he
was returned sooner than was expected.</p>

<p>He had forgotten that; it accounted for his Henrietta's
absence; yes, by pushing on impatiently from stage to stage he
had arrived in London a week before his time.</p>

<p>"Did you have any adventures, John?"</p>

<p>"None, sir, till I reached Marygate&mdash;and there the hired
coach met with an accident and I lost Dr. Sopher."</p>

<p>Both the gentlemen laughed; there was a different quality in
their merriment; Falconer laughed too long, too loudly.</p>

<p>"Henrietta Pentelow is out of town," he remarked, still
laughing.</p>

<p>"She is often out of town. She has become Maid of Honour to
the Princess&mdash;she told you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I have respected our agreement not to mention her name
while you were abroad&mdash;you'll find her changed. She's much
admired&mdash;her dresses, her exploits are daring. I leave you
to judge you have rivals. It is thought that Lord Charles Scroop
would have married her out of hand had he not possessed a
wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked the young man, steadily, fingering the two
sapphires in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Charles Scroop&mdash;he was in Brussels when you left&mdash;a
notable scoundrel."</p>

<p>His Grace was surprised at his own calm...but two years is a
long time for youth.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Pentelow?&mdash;But you'll not know."</p>

<p>"I watch her movements, in your interests, John&mdash;she has
gone&mdash;with a wild crowd&mdash;to Merrion Court, in
Kent."</p>

<p>In a week's time The Mercury, with perfect truth, could
announce:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"His Grace the Duke of H&mdash;&mdash;, lately
returned from his Travels, has become so Enamoured of Naples,
that he has decided to purchase a Villa there, and spend the
Season in that agreeable Climate. The rarest Curiosities that His
Grace brought Home consist of two Indian Sapphires which he has
presented to the Lady of his Uncle, Colonel D&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a> KECKSIES</h2>

<h3>A PATCH OF MARSH WEEDS&mdash;1800</h3>

<p class="first">
TWO young esquires were riding from Canterbury, jolly and
drunk, they shouted and trolled and rolled in their saddles as
they followed the winding road across the downs.</p>

<p>A dim sky was overhead and shut in the wide expanse of open
country that one side stretched to the sea and the other to the
Kentish Weald.</p>

<p>The primroses grew in thick posies in the ditches, the hedges
were full of fresh hawthorn green, and the new grey leaves of
eglantine and honeysuckle, the long boughs of ash with the hard
black buds, and the wand-like shoots of sallow willow hung with
catkins and the smaller red tassels of the nut and birch; little
the two young men heeded of any of these things, for they were in
their own country that was thrice familiar; but Nick Bateup
blinked across to the distant purple hills, and cursed the
gathering rain. "Ten miles more of the open," he muttered, "and a
great storm blackening upon us."</p>

<p>Young Crediton who was more full of wine, laughed
drowsily.</p>

<p>"We'll lie at a cottage on the way, Nick&mdash;think you I've
never a tenant who'll let me share board and bed?"</p>

<p>He maundered into singing:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"There's a light in the old mill,<br>

Where the witch weaves her charms;<br>

But dark is the chamber,<br>

Where you sleep in my arms.</p>

<p class="verse">Now came you by magic,<br>

by trick or by spell,<br>

I have you and hold you,<br>

And love you right well!"</p>

<br>

<p>The clouds overtook them like an advancing army; the wayside
green looked livid under the purplish threat of the heavens, and
the birds were all still and silent.</p>

<p>"Split me if I'll be soaked," muttered young Bateup. "Knock up
one of these boors of thine, Ned&mdash;but damn me if I see as
much as hut or barn!"</p>

<p>"We come to Banells farm soon, or have we passed it?" answered
the other confusedly. "What's the pother? A bold bird as thou
art, and scared of a drop of rain?"</p>

<p>"My lungs are not as lusty as thine," replied Bateup, who was
indeed of a delicate build and more carefully dressed in
greatcoat and muffler.</p>

<p>"But thy throat is as wide!" laughed Crediton, "and God help
you, you are muffled like an old woman&mdash;and as drunk as a
shorn parrot."</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Tra la la, my sweeting,<br>

Tra la la, my May,<br>

If now I miss the meeting<br>

I'll come some other day."</p>

<br>

<p>His companion took no notice of this nonsense, but with as
much keenness as his muddled faculties would allow, was looking
out for some shelter, for he retained sufficient perception to
enable him to mark the violence of the approaching storm and the
loneliness of the vast stretch of country where the only human
habitations appeared to be some few poor cottages, far distant in
the fields.</p>

<p>He lost his good-humor, and as the first drops of stinging
cold rain began to fall, he cursed freely, using the terms common
to the pot-houses where he had intoxicated himself on the way
from Canterbury.</p>

<p>Urging their tired horses, they came on to the top of the
little hill they ascended; immediately before them was the silver
ashen skeleton of a blasted oak, polished like worn bone standing
over a small pool of stagnant water (for there had been little
rain and much east wind), where a few shivering ewes crouched
together from the oncoming storm.</p>

<p>Just beyond this, rising out of the bare field, was a humble
cottage of black timber and white plaster with a deep thatched
roof. For the rest, the crest of the hill was covered by a hazel
copse and then dipped lonely again to the clouded lower levels
that now began to slope into the marsh.</p>

<p>"This will shelter us, Nick," cried Crediton.</p>

<p>"'Tis a foul place and the boors have a foul reputation,"
objected the lord of the manor. "There are those who swear to
seeing the Devil's own phiz leer from Goody Boyle's
windows&mdash;but anything to please thee and thy weak
chest."</p>

<p>They staggered from their horses, knocked open the rotting
gate and leading the beasts across the hard dry grazing field,
knocked with their whips at the small door of the cottage.</p>

<p>The grey sheep under the grey tree looked at them and bleated
faintly; the rain began to fall, like straight yet broken darts
out of the sombre clouds.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a woman very neatly dressed, with large
scrubbed hands, who looked at them with fear and displeasure; for
if her reputation was bad, theirs was no better; the lord of the
manor was a known roysterer and wild liver, and spent his
idleness in rakish expeditions with Sir Nicholas Bateup from
Bodiam, who was easily squandering a fine property.</p>

<p>Neither was believed to be free of bloodshed, and as for
honor, they were as stripped of that as the blasted tree by the
lonely pool was stripped of leaves.</p>

<p>Besides, they were both, now, as usual, drunk.</p>

<p>"We want shelter, Goody Boyle," cried Crediton, pushing his
way in as he threw her his reins. "Get the horses into the
barn."</p>

<p>The woman could not deny the man who could make her homeless
in a second; she shouted hoarsely an inarticulate name, and a
loutish boy came and took the horses, while the two young men
stumbled into the cottage which they filled and dwarfed with
their splendor.</p>

<p>Edward Crediton had been a fine young man, and though he was
marred with insolence and excess, he still made a magnificent
appearance, with his full blunt features, his warm coloring, the
fair hair rolled and curled and all his bravery of blue
broadcloth, buckskin breeches, foreign lace, top boots, French
sword and gold rings and watch chains.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas Bateup was darker and more effeminate, having a
cast of weakness in his constitution that betrayed itself in his
face; but his dress was splendid to the point of foppishness and
his manners even more arrogant and imposing.</p>

<p>Of the two he had the more evil repute; he was unwed and
therefore there was no check upon his mischief, whereas Crediton
had a young wife whom he loved after his fashion, who checked
some of his doings, softened others, and stayed very faithful to
him and adored him still, after five years of a wretched
marriage, as is the manner of some women.</p>

<p>The rain came down with slashing severity; the little cottage
panes were blotted with water.</p>

<p>Goody Boyle put logs on the fire and urged them with the
bellows. It was a gaunt white room with nothing in it but a few
wooden stools, a table and an eel-catcher's prong.</p>

<p>On the table were two large fair wax candles.</p>

<p>"What are these for, Goody?" asked Crediton.</p>

<p>"For the dead, sir."</p>

<p>"You've dead in the house?" cried Sir Nicholas, who was
leaning by the fireplace and warming his hands. "What do you want
with dead men in the house, you trollop?"</p>

<p>"It is no dead of mine, my lord," answered the woman with evil
civility, "but one who took shelter here and died."</p>

<p>"A curst witch!" roared Crediton. "You hear that, Nick! Came
here&mdash;died&mdash;and now you'll put spells on us, you ugly
slut&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No spells of mine," answered the woman quietly, rubbing her
large clean hands together. "He had been long ailing and died
here of an ague."</p>

<p>"And who sent the ague?" asked Crediton with drunken gravity.
"And who sent him here?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the same hand that sent us," laughed Sir Nicholas.
"Where is your corpse, Goody?"</p>

<p>"In the next room&mdash;I have but two."</p>

<p>"And two too many&mdash;you need but a bundle of faggots and a
tuft of tow to light it&mdash;an arrant witch, a contest witch,"
muttered Crediton; he staggered up from the stool. "Where is your
corpse? I've a mind to see if he looks as if he died a natural
death."</p>

<p>"Will you not ask first who it is?" asked the woman,
unlatching the inner door.</p>

<p>"Why should I care?"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Sir Nicholas, who had the clearer wits,
drunk or sober.</p>

<p>"Richard Horne," said Goody Boyle.</p>

<p>Ned Crediton looked at her with the eyes of a sober man.</p>

<p>"Richard Horne," said Sir Nicholas. "So he is dead at
last&mdash;your wife will be glad of that, Ned."</p>

<p>Crediton gave a sullen laugh.</p>

<p>"I'd broken him&mdash;she wasn't afraid any longer of a lost
wretch, cast out to die of ague on the marsh."</p>

<p>But Sir Nicholas had heard differently; he had been told, even
by Ned himself, how Anne Crediton shivered before the terror of
Richard Horne's pursuit, and would wake up in the dark crying out
for fear of him, like a lost child; for he had wooed her before
her marriage, and persisted in loving her afterwards with mad
boldness and insolent confidence, so that justice had been set on
him and he had been banished to the marsh, a ruined man.</p>

<p>"Well, sirs," said Goody Boyle, in her thin voice that had the
pinched accent of other parts, "my lady can sleep o' nights
now&mdash;for Robert Horne will never disturb her again."</p>

<p>"Do you think he ever troubled us?" asked Crediton with a
coarse oath. "I flung him out like an adder that had writhed
across the threshold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A wonder he did not put a murrain on thee, Ned. He had
fearful ways and a deep knowledge of unholy things."</p>

<p>"A warlock. God help us," added the woman.</p>

<p>"The Devil's proved an ill master then," laughed Crediton. "He
could not help Richard Horne into Anne's favor&mdash;nor prevent
him lying in a cold bed in the flower of his age."</p>

<p>"The Devil," smiled Sir Nicholas, "was over busy, Ned, helping
you to the lady's favor and a warm bed. You were the dearer
disciple."</p>

<p>"Oh, good lords, will you talk less wildly with a lost man's
corpse in the house, and his soul riding the storm without?"
begged Goody Boyle; and she latched again the inner door.</p>

<p>Murk filled the cottage now; waves of shadow flowed over the
landscape without the rain-blotted window, and drowned the
valley. In the bitter field, the melancholy ewes huddled beneath
the blasted oak beside the bare pool, the stagnant surface of
which was now broken by the quick raindrops; a low thunder
grumbled from the horizon and all the young greenery looked livid
in the ghastly light of heaven.</p>

<p>"<i>I'll see him</i>," said Ned Crediton, swaggering. "I'll
look at this gay gallant in his last smock!&mdash;so that I can
swear to Anne he has taken his amorous smile to the
earthworms&mdash;surely."</p>

<p>"Look as you like," answered Sir Nicholas, "glut your eyes
with looking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you'll remember, sirs, that <i>he was a queer man and
died queerly</i>, and there was no parson or priest to take the
edge off his going, or challenge the fiends who stood at his head
and feet."</p>

<p>"Saw <i>you</i> the fiends?" asked Ned curiously.</p>

<p>"Question not what I saw," muttered the woman. "You'll have
your own familiars, Esquire Crediton."</p>

<p>She unlatched the inner door again and Ned passed in, bowing
low on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Good day, Robert Horne," he jeered. "We parted in anger, but
my debts are paid now and I greet you well."</p>

<p>The dead man lay on a pallet bed with a coarse white sheet
over him that showed his shape but roughly; the window was by his
head and looked blankly on to the rain-bitten fields and dismal
sky; the light was cold and colorless on the white sheet and the
miserable room.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas lounged in the doorway; he feared no death but
his own, and that he set so far away it was but a dim dread.</p>

<p>"Look and see if it is Robert Horne," he urged, "or if the
beldam lies."</p>

<p>And Crediton turned down the sheet.</p>

<p>"'Tis Robert Horne," he said.</p>

<p>The dead man had his chin uptilted, his features sharp and
horrible in the setting of the spilled fair hair, on the coarse
pillow. Ned Crediton triumphed over him, making lewd jests of
love and death, and sneering at this great gallant, who had been
crazed for love and driven by desire, and who now lay
impotent.</p>

<p>And Sir Nicholas in the doorway listened and laughed and had
his own wicked jeers to add; for both of them had hated Robert
Horne as a man who had defied them.</p>

<p>But Goody Boyle stole away with her fingers in her ears.</p>

<p>When these two were weary of their insults they returned the
flap of the sheet over the dead face and returned to the outer
room. And Ned asked for drink, declaring that Goody Boyle was a
known smuggler and had cellars of rare stuff.</p>

<p>So the lout brought up glasses of cognac and a bottle of
French wine, and these two drank grossly, sitting over the fire;
and Goody Boyle made excuse for the drink, by saying that Robert
Horne had given her two gold pieces before he died (not thin
pared coins but thick and heavy) for his funeral, and the
entertainment of those who should come to his burying.</p>

<p>"What mourners could he hope for?" laughed Ned Crediton. "The
crow and the beetle and the death-watch spider!"</p>

<p>But Goody Boyle told him that Robert Horne had made friends
while he had lived an outcast on the marshes; they were, no
doubt, queer and even monstrous people, but they were coming
tonight to sit with Robert Horne before he was put in the
ground.</p>

<p>"And who, Goody, have warned this Devil's congregation of the
death of Robert Horne?" asked Sir Nicholas.</p>

<p>She answered him&mdash;that Robert Horne was not ill an hour
or a day but for a long space struggled with fits of the marsh
fever, and in between these bouts of the ague, he went abroad
like a well man, and his friends would come up and see him and
the messenger who came up to enquire after him was Tora, the
Egyptian girl who walked with her bosom full of violets.</p>

<p>The storm was in full fury now, muttering low and sullen round
the cottage with great power of beating rain.</p>

<p>"Robert Horne was slow in dying," said Sir Nicholas. "Of what
did he speak in those days?"</p>

<p>"Of a woman, good sir."</p>

<p>"Of my wife!" cried Ned.</p>

<p>Goody Boyle shook her head with a look of stupidity.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of that. Though for certain he called her
Anne, sweet Anne, and swore he would possess her yet&mdash;in so
many words and very roundly."</p>

<p>"But he died balked," said Ned, swaying on his stool, "and
he'll rot outside holy ground."</p>

<p>"They'll lay him in Deadman's Field, which is full of old
bones none can plough and no sheep will graze," answered the
woman, "and I must set out to see lame Jonas who promised to have
the grave ready&mdash;but maybe the rain has hindered him."</p>

<p>She looked at them shrewdly as she added,</p>

<p>"That is, gentles, if you care to remain alone with the body
of Robert Horne."</p>

<p>"I think of him as a dead dog," replied Ned Crediton.</p>

<p>And when the woman had gone, he, being loosened with the
French brandy, suggested a gross jest.</p>

<p>"Why should Robert Horne have all this honor, even from rogues
and Egyptians? Let us fool them&mdash;throwing his corpse out
into the byre, and I will lie under the sheet and presently sit
up and fright them all, with the thought it is the Devil!"</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas warmly cheered this proposal and they lurched
into the inner chamber which was dark enough now by reason of a
great northern cloud that blocked the light from the window.</p>

<p>They pulled the sheet off Robert Horne and found him wrapped
in another that was furled up under his chin, and so they carried
him to the back door and peered through the storm for some secret
place where they might throw him.</p>

<p>And Ned Crediton saw a dark bed of rank hemlock and cried,
"Cast him into the kecksies," that being the rustic name for the
weed.</p>

<p>So they flung the dead man into the hemlocks which were scarce
high enough to cover him, and to hide the whiteness of the sheet,
broke off boughs from the hazel copse and put over him, and went
back laughing to the cottage, and there kept a watch out from the
front window and when they saw Goody Boyle toiling along through
the rain, Ned took off his hat and coat and sword and folded them
away under the bed, then Sir Nicholas wrapped him in the under
sheet, so that he was shrouded to the chin, and he lay on the
pillow, and drew the other sheet over him.</p>

<p>"If thou sleepst do not snore," said Sir Nicholas, and went
back to the fire and lit his long clay full of Virginian
tobacco.</p>

<p>When Goody Boyle entered with her wet shawl over her head, she
had two ragged creatures behind her who stared malevolently at
the fine gentleman with his bright clothes and dark curls,
lolling by the fire and watching the smoke rings rise from his
pipe.</p>

<p>"Esquire Crediton has ridden for home," he said, "but I am not
minded to risk the ague."</p>

<p>And he sipped more brandy and laughed at them, and they
muttering, for they knew his fame, went into the death-chamber
and crouched round the couch where Sir Nicholas had just laid Ned
Crediton under the sheet.</p>

<p>And presently others came up, Egyptians, eel-catchers and the
like, outcasts and vagrants who crept in to watch by the corpse.
Sir Nicholas presently rolled after them to see the horror and
shriekings for grace there would be, when the dead man threw
aside his shroud and sat up.</p>

<p>But the vigil went on till the night closed in and the two wax
candles were lit, and still Ned Crediton gave no sign, nor did he
snore or heave beneath the sheet, and Sir Nicholas became
impatient, for the rain was over and he was weary of the foul air
and the grotesque company.</p>

<p>"The fool," he thought (for he kept his wits well even in his
cups), "has gone into a drunken sleep and forgot the joke."</p>

<p>So he pushed his way to the bed and turned down the sheet,
whispering:</p>

<p>"This jest will grow stale with keeping."</p>

<p>But the words withered on his lips, for he looked into the
face of a dead man. At the cry he gave they all came babbling
about him and he told them of the trick that had been put upon
them.</p>

<p>"But there's Devil's work here," he added. "For here is the
body back again&mdash;or Ned Crediton dead and frozen into a
likeness of the other"&mdash;and he flung the sheet end quickly
over the pinched face and fair hair.</p>

<p>"And what did ye do with Robert Horne, outrageous dare fiend
that ye be?" demanded an old vagrant; and the young lord passed
the ill words and answered with whitened lips.</p>

<p>"We cast him into yon bed of kecksies."</p>

<p>And they all beat out into the night, the lout with a lantern.
And there was nothing at all in the bed of kecksies...and Ned
Crediton's horse was gone from the stable.</p>

<p>"He was drunk," said Sir Nicholas, "and forgot his
part&mdash;and fled that moment I was in the outer room."</p>

<p>"And in that minute did he carry Robert Horne in alone and
wrap him up so neatly?" queried Goody Boyle.</p>

<p>"Well go in," said another hag, "and strip the body and see
which man it be&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Sir Nicholas was in the saddle.</p>

<p>"Let be," he cried wildly, "there's been gruesome work enough
for tonight&mdash;it's Robert Horne you have there&mdash;let
be&mdash;Ill back to Crediton Manor&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he rode his horse out of the field, then more quickly down
the darkling road, for the fumes of the brandy were out of his
brain and he saw clearly and dreaded many things.</p>

<p>At the cross-roads when the ghastly moon had suddenly struck
free of the retreating clouds he saw Ned Crediton ahead of him
riding sharply, and he called out:</p>

<p>"Eh, Ned, what have you made of this jest? This way it is but
a mangled folly."</p>

<p>"What matter now for jest or earnest?" answered the other. "I
ride home at last."</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas kept pace with him; he was hatless and wore a
shabby cloak that was twisted about him with the wind of his
riding.</p>

<p>"Why did not you take your own garments?" asked Sir Nicholas.
"Belike that rag you've snatched up belonged to Robert
Horne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If Crediton could steal his shroud he can steal his cloak,"
replied Ned, and his companion said no more, thinking him wrought
into a frenzy with the brandy and the evil nature of the
joke.</p>

<p>The moon shone clear and cold with a faint stain like old
blood in the halo, and the trees, bending in a seaward wind, cast
the recent rain that loaded them heavily to the ground, as the
two rode into the gates of Crediton Manor.</p>

<p>The hour was later than even Sir Nicholas knew (time had been
blurred for him since the coming of the storm) and there was no
light save a dim lamp in an upper window.</p>

<p>Ned Crediton dropped out of the saddle, not waiting for the
mounting block, and rang the iron bell till it clattered through
the house like a madman's fury.</p>

<p>"Why, Ned, why this panic homecoming?" asked Sir Nicholas; but
the other answered him not, but rang again.</p>

<p>There were footsteps within and the rattle of chains, and a
voice asked from the side window:</p>

<p>"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>And Crediton dragged at the bell and screamed:</p>

<p>"I! The Master!"</p>

<p>The door was opened and an old servant stood there, pale in
his bedgown.</p>

<p>Ned Crediton passed him and stood by the newel post, like a
man spent, yet alert.</p>

<p>"Send some one for the horses," said Nick Bateup, "for your
master is crazy drunk&mdash;I tell you, Mathews, he has seen
Robert Horne dead tonight&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crediton laughed; the long rays of the lamp light showed him
pale, haggard, distorted with tumbled fair hair and a torn shirt
under the mantle, and at his waist a ragged bunch of hemlock
thrust into his sash.</p>

<p>"A posy of kecksies for Anne," he said; and the sleepy
servants now up, began to come into the hall, looked at him with
dismay. "I'll lie here tonight," said Sir Nicholas; "bring me
lights into the parlor. I've no mind to sleep."</p>

<p>He took off his hat and fingered his sword and glanced
uneasily at the figure by the newel post with the posy of
kecksies.</p>

<p>Another figure appeared at the head of the stairs, Anne
Crediton holding her candle, wearing a grey lutestring robe and a
lace cap with long ribbons that hung on to her bosom; she peered
over the baluster and some of the hot wax from her taper fell on
to the oak treads.</p>

<p>"I've a beau pot for you, Anne," said Crediton, looking up and
holding out the hemlocks. "I've long been dispossessed, Anne, but
I've come home at last."</p>

<p>She drew back without a word and her light flickered away
across the landing; Crediton went up after her and they heard a
door shut.</p>

<p>In the parlor the embers had been blown to flames and fresh
logs put on and Sir Nicholas warmed his cold hands and told old
Mathews (in a sober manner for him) the story of the jest they
had striven to put on Goody Boyle and the queer, monstrous people
from the marsh, and the monstrous ending of it, and the
strangeness of Ned Crediton; it was not his usual humor to
discourse with servants or to discuss his vagrant debaucheries
with any, but tonight he seemed to need company and endeavored to
retain the old man, who was not reluctant to stay though usually
he hated to see the dark face and bright clothes of Nick Bateup
before the hearth of Crediton Manor.</p>

<p>And as these two talked, disconnectedly, as if they would fill
the gap of any silence that might fall in the quiet house, there
came the wail of a woman, desperate yet sunken.</p>

<p>"It is Mistress Crediton," said Mathews with a downcast look.
"He ill-uses her?"</p>

<p>"God help us, he will use buckles and straps to her, Sir
Nicholas." A quivering shriek came brokenly down the stairs and
seemed to form the word "mercy."</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas was an evil man who died unrepentant; but he was
not of a temper to relish raw cruelty or crude brutalities to
women; he would break their souls but never their bodies.</p>

<p>So he went to the door and listened, and old Mathews had never
liked him so well as now when he saw the look on the thin dark
face. For the third time she shrieked and they marvelled that any
human being could hold her breath so long; yet it was muffled as
if some one held a hand over her mouth.</p>

<p>The sweat stood out on the old man's forehead.</p>

<p>"I've never before known her complain sir," he whispered. "She
is a very dog to her lord and takes her whip mutely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know&mdash;she adores his hand when it caresses or
when it strikes&mdash;but tonight&mdash;if I know anything of a
woman's accents, that is a note of abhorrence&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ran up the stairs, the old man panting after him with the
snatched-up lantern.</p>

<p>"Where is her chamber?"</p>

<p>"Here, Sir Nicholas."</p>

<p>The young man struck on the heavy oak panels with the hilt of
his sword.</p>

<p>"Madam, Madam Crediton, why are you so ill at ease?" She
moaned from within.</p>

<p>"Open to me, Ill call some of your women&mdash;come
out&mdash;" Their blood curdled to hear her wails.</p>

<p>"Damn you to Hell," cried Sir Nicholas in a fury. "Come out,
Ned Crediton, or I'll have the door down and run you through."
The answer was a little break of maniac laughter.</p>

<p>"She has run mad or he," cried Mathews, backing from the room.
"And surely there is another clamor at the door&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the bell clanged and there were voices and tumult at the
door; Mathews went and opened, and Sir Nicholas looking down the
stairs saw in the moonlight a dirty farm cart, a sweating horse
and some of the patched and rusty crew who had been keeping vigil
in Goody Boyle's cottage.</p>

<p>"We've brought Esquire Crediton home," said one; and the
others lifted a body from the cart and carried it through the
murky moonlight.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas came downstairs, for old Mathews could do nothing
but cry for mercy.</p>

<p>"It was Edward Crediton," repeated the eel-catcher, shuffling
into the hall, "clothed all but his coat and hat and that was
under the bed&mdash;there be his watches and chains, his seals
and the papers in his pockets&mdash;and for his visage now there
is no mistakening it."</p>

<p>They had laid the body on the table where it had so often sat
and larked and ate and drunk and cursed; Sir Nicholas gazed,
holding up the lantern.</p>

<p>Edward Crediton&mdash;never any doubt of that now, though his
face was distorted as by the anguish of a sudden and ugly death.
"We never found Robert Horne," muttered one of the mourners,
trailing his foul muddy rags nearer the fire, and thrusting his
crooked hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>And Mathews fell on his knees and tried to pray, but could
think of no words.</p>

<p>"Who is upstairs?" demanded Sir Nicholas in a terrible voice.
"Who is with that wretched woman?"</p>

<p>And he stared at the body of her husband.</p>

<p>Mathews, who had loved her as a little child, began gibbering
and moaning.</p>

<p>"Did he not say he'd have her? And did not yon fool change
places with him? Oh God, oh God, and has he not come to take his
place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Robert Horne was <i>dead</i>. I saw him dead," stammered
Sir Nicholas, and set the lantern down, for his hand shook so the
flame waved in the gusts.</p>

<p>"Eh," shrieked old Mathews, grovelling on his hands and knees
in his bedgown. "Might not the Devil have lent him his body back
for his own pitchy purposes?"</p>

<p>They looked at him a little, seeing he was suddenly crazed;
then Sir Nicholas ran up the stairs with the others at his heels
and thundered with his sword, and kicked and shouted outside Anne
Crediton's chamber door.</p>

<p>All the foul, muddy, earthy crew cowered on the stairs and
chittered together, and in the parlor before the embers old
Mathews crouched huddled, and whimpered.</p>

<p>The bedroom door opened and Robert Horne came out and stood
and smiled at them, and the young man in his fury fell back and
his sword rattled from his hand to the floor.</p>

<p>Robert Horne was a white death, nude to the waist and from
there swathed in grave clothes; under the tattered dark cloak he
had ridden in, was his shroud knotted round his neck; his naked
chest gleamed with ghastly dews and under the waxen polish of his
sunken face the decayed blood showed in discolored patches; he
went down the stairs and they hid their faces while his foul
whiteness passed.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas stumbled into the bedchamber. The moonlight
showed Anne Crediton tumbled on the bed, dead, and staring with
the posy of kecksies on her bare breast, and her mouth hung open
and her hands clutching at the curtains.</p>

<p>The mourners rode back and picked up Robert Horne's body
whence it had returned from the kecksie patch and buried it in
unholy ground with great respect, as one to whom the Devil had
given his great desire.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a> RAW MATERIAL</h2>

<h3>STRANGE HAPPENINGS AT PECKHAM RYE&mdash;1900</h3>

<p class="first">
LINLEY was fond of collecting what he called "raw material"
and, as a fairly successful barrister, he had good opportunity
for doing so. He despised novelists and romancists, yet one day
he hoped to become one of these gentry himself, hence his
collection of the raw material...however, after some years he
became disgusted and overwhelmed by the amount of "stuff" (as he
termed it) which he had gathered together&mdash;scenes, episodes,
characters, dialogues, descriptions and decorations for all or
any possible type of tale; he remained, he declared, surprised at
the poverty of invention of the professional story-tellers who
gave so little for the public's money in the way of good, strong,
rousing drama, such as he, Robert Linley, had come across, well,
more times than he cared to count...</p>

<p>"There isn't anything," he declared with some vehemence, "of
which I haven't had experience."</p>

<p>"Ghosts?" I asked, and he smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I've had any amount of experiences with
ghosts, with people who've seen 'em, and people who think they've
seen 'em, and with the ghosts themselves..."</p>

<p>"Well," I asked, "have you come across a real Christmas ghost
story&mdash;what we used to call the old-fashioned kind? They're
getting a bit threadbare now, you know; they've been told over
and over again, year after year; have you got a novelty in that
direction?"</p>

<p>Linley, after a moment's pause, said that he had.</p>

<p>"There's some raw material for you," he cried, waxing
enthusiastic, "the story of the Catchpoles and Aunt Ursula Beane,
there's some raw material&mdash;why, there's everything in
it&mdash;comedy, tragedy, drama, satire, farce&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" I cried, "and just tell us as briefly as possible
what your 'raw material' consists of. I'm out for a Christmas
ghost story, you know, and I shall be disappointed if you don't
give us something of that kind."</p>

<p>Linley made himself extremely comfortable and, with a lawyer's
relish of the right phrase and the correct turn of sentence, gave
us the history of Aunt Ursula Beane, with the usual proviso, of
course, that the names and places had been altered. Before he
began his narration Linley insisted on the novelty of the story,
and before he had finished we all of us (those select few who
were privileged to hear him hold forth) agreed that it was very
novel indeed.</p>

<p>The case of Aunt Ursula Beane, as he called her, had come
under his notice in a professional way and in the following
manner, commonplace enough from a lawyer's point of view,
although the subsequent case was one which the papers endeavored
to work up into what is described by that overworked word
"sensational." As far as the lawyers and the public were
concerned it began with an inquest on Mrs. Ursula Beane. In
Linley's carefully selected phrases the case was this:</p>

<p>Mrs. Ursula Beane had died suddenly at the age of
seventy-five. The doctor who had been intermittently attending
her&mdash;she was an extremely robust and healthy old
woman&mdash;had not been altogether satisfied with her symptoms.
He had refused a death certificate, there had been an autopsy,
and it was discovered that Mrs. Ursula Beane had died from
arsenical poisoning. The fact established, an enquiry followed,
eliciting the following circumstances. Mrs. Ursula Beane had
lived for forty years in a small house at Peckham Rye which had
belonged to her father and his father before him. The house had
been built in the days when Peckham Rye&mdash;well, was not quite
like it is now. She resided with a nephew and niece&mdash;James
and Louisa Catchpole. Neither of them had ever married, neither
of them had ever left Peckham Rye for more than a few weeks at a
time, and the most minute investigation did not discover that
either of them had had the least adventure or out-of-the-way
event in their lives. They enjoyed a small annuity from a father
who had been a worthy and fairly prosperous tradesman. James was,
at the time of the inquest, a man over sixty and had been for
many years a clerk&mdash;'confidential clerk' as he emphasized
it&mdash;with a large firm of tea merchants. He received a
sufficient, if not a substantial salary and was within a year or
two of a pension. His sister, Miss Louisa Catchpole, was
younger&mdash;fifty or so; she also had a substantial, if not a
brilliant, position as a journalist on one of those few surviving
monthlies which rather shun publicity and cater for the secluded
and the virtuous. She wrote occasional short stories in which the
hero was always a clergyman and the heroine <i>sans peur et sans
reproche</i>. She also wrote little weekly causeries&mdash;as I
believe they are called&mdash;'Meditations in a Garden'; they
were headed and adorned with a little cut of an invalid in a
basket-chair gazing at a robin. In these same <i>causeries</i>
Miss Louisa Catchpole affected month after month, year after
year, with unfaltering fortitude, a vein of Christian
cheerfulness, and encouraged her readers with such maxims as
'Character is stronger than Destiny,' 'A man is only as strong as
his faith in himself,' and chirpings about the recurring miracle
of spring, together with quotations from the more minor
poets&mdash;you know the type of thing.</p>

<p>It is irrelevant to our story to go into why Aunt Ursula Beane
lived with those two; they seemed to be the only surviving
members of their very unimportant family, and they had lived
together in the house at Peckham Rye for forty years, ever since
Louisa was quite a small child and had gone there to live with
Aunt Ursula who, on her husband's death, had retired to this
paternal abode. Nobody could think of them as apart one from the
other. During those forty years James had gone to and fro his
work, Louisa had written her articles and stories, and at first
had been looked after by, and afterwards had looked after, Aunt
Ursula Beane. Their joint earnings kept the tiny establishment
going; they were considerably helped by the fact that there was
no rent to pay and they lived in modest comfort, almost with
(what James would have called) 'every luxury.' Besides giving
them the house to live in, Mrs. Beane paid them at first thirty
shillings, then, as the cost of living went up, two pounds a week
for what she called 'her keep.' What, you will say, could have
been more deadly commonplace than this? But there was just one
touch of mystery and romance. Aunt Ursula was reputed to be of
vast wealth and a miser&mdash;this was one of those family
traditions that swell and grow on human credulity from one
generation to another. The late Mr. Beane was spoken of with
vague awe as a very wealthy man, and it appeared that the
Catchpoles believed that he had left his widow a considerable
fortune which she, a true miser, had concealed all those years,
but which they might reasonably hope to inherit on her death, as
a reward for all their faithful kindness. Investigation proved
that what had seemed rather a fantastic delusion had some
startling foundation. Mrs. Ursula Beane employed a lawyer and his
evidence was that her late husband, who had been a tobacconist,
had left her a tidy sum of money when he had died forty years
ago, amounting to fifteen thousand pounds, which had been safely
invested and not touched till about five years before. What Mrs.
Beane lived on came from another source&mdash;a small capital
left by her father that brought her in about a hundred and fifty
pounds a year; therefore this main sum had been, as I have said,
untouched and had accrued during those thirty-five years into a
handsome sum of nearly fifty thousand pounds. The lawyer agreed
that the old lady was a miser, nothing would induce her to draw
out any of this money, to mention its existence to a soul, or to
make a will as to its final disposal. The lawyer, of course, was
pledged to secrecy. He knew that the Catchpoles guessed at the
existence of the hoard, he also knew that they were not sure
about it and that they had no idea as to its magnitude. Five
years before her death the old lady had drawn out all her
capital&mdash;forty-eight thousand pounds&mdash;without any
explanation whatever to the lawyer, and had taken it away in a
black bag, going off in a taxicab from the lawyer's office in
Lincoln's Inn. It might have been the Nibelung hoard flung into
the Rhine for all the mystery that was attached to it, for nobody
saw or heard of it again. Both the Catchpoles swore that they had
no knowledge whatever of the old woman realizing her capital; she
had certainly not banked it anywhere, she must have taken that
very large sum of money in notes and, I believe, a few bonds, to
that small house at Peckham Rye and in some way disposed of it. A
most exhaustive search revealed not so much as a five-pound note.
In the bank was just the last quarterly instalment of her
annuity&mdash;barely enough, as Louisa Catchpole remarked with
some passion, "to pay the doctor and the funeral expenses."</p>

<p>There you have the situation. This old woman dead in what was
almost poverty, the disappearance of this large sum of money she
had realized five years previously, and the fact that she had
died from arsenical poisoning. To explain this there were the
usual symptoms, or excuses, whatever you like to call them; she
had been having medicine with arsenic in it, and she might have
taken an overdose. There had been arsenic in the house in the
shape of powders for an overgrown and aged dog, and in the shape
of packets of weed-killer, James had always taken an industrious
interest in the patch of garden that sloped to the Common. The
old lady might have committed suicide, she might have taken some
of the stuff in mistake, or the Catchpoles might have been
murderers. The only possible reason for suspecting foul play
would have been that the Catchpoles knew of her hoard and wished
to get hold of it. But this it was impossible to prove. I was
briefed to watch the case for the Catchpoles. There was, of
course, a certain sensation and excitement over the fact of the
large sum of money, the only startling and brilliant fact about
the whole commonplace, drab and rather depressing story. I myself
thought it rather absurd that any question of suspicion should
attach to the Catchpoles. After forty years of placid uninspired
devotion to Aunt Ursula Beane, why should they suddenly decide to
put her out of the way when, in the nature of things, she could
not have had more than a few years to live? Their demeanor, too,
impressed me very favorably. There was none of the flaunting
vanity, posing or vehement talk of the real criminal, they seemed
slightly bewildered, not very much disturbed, and to trust wholly
in their undeniable innocence, they almost found the whole thing
grotesque and I could understand their point of view. The
verdict, however, was rather surprising. It was confidently
expected that it would be Death from misadventure,' but instead,
the verdict was 'Death from arsenical poisoning not
self-administered.' This is really about as near as we can get in
England to the Scottish verdict 'Not proven,' and I was rather
indignant, for it seemed to me to attach a great deal of wholly
unmerited suspicion to the two Catchpoles. Still, of course, they
were quite free and no direct blame was laid on them. In fact,
the coroner had remarked on their devoted care of an old lady who
must have been, from the various facts proved by the doctors,
'very trying and difficult,' as the saying goes. They conducted
themselves very well after the inquest, still with that slightly
bewildered patient air of resignation. It seemed to me that they
did not realize the ghastly position in which they stood and, as
I knew when I heard the verdict, the very narrow escape they had
had from being arrested on a charge of murder. They paid all the
expenses connected with the inquest at once and without any
trouble. They had, as James explained with a certain mild pride,
'savings.' I was interested in them, they were so meek and drab,
so ordinary and repressed; there was something kindly and amiable
about them and they were very attached to each other. I
questioned them about this mysterious hoard, the existence of
which would have been difficult to believe but for the evidence
of the lawyer. They did not seem very concerned, they had always
known that Aunt Ursula Beane had money and, said Louisa without
passion, they had always guessed that she had tried to do them
out of it&mdash;she had been an extraordinarily malicious old
woman, they complained, and it was quite likely that the money
was buried somewhere, or had been destroyed. She was capable of
feeding the fire with it, of sticking it in a hole in the ground,
of throwing it into the water in a bag weighed down with stones,
in fact of doing anything in the world with it except putting it
to some profitable use. She was undoubtedly not right in her
head.</p>

<p>"She ought to have been certified years ago," I declared.</p>

<p>"James Catchpole shook his head.</p>

<p>"She was never bad enough for that," he announced with
resignation.</p>

<p>They had really been slaving and "bearing" things for forty
years for that money, and they took the loss of it, I thought,
with extreme gallantry.</p>

<p>They returned to the little house in Peckham Rye which came to
them as next-of-kin. The little annuity, which was all that Aunt
Ursula had left of her worldly goods after she had disposed of
her main fortune, perished with her. James and Louisa would have
to live on his clerkship and her journalism.</p>

<p>At this point Linley stopped to ask me if we did not perceive
a real strong drama in what he had told us&mdash;"A whole novel,
in fact," he added triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, "one might make it into a whole novel by
inserting incidents and imagining this and that and the other. As
you have given it, it seems a dreary stretch of nothingness with
a rather damp squib at the end. After all, there was no murder, I
suppose the old woman took an overdose of medicine by mistake.
Where," asked, "does the Christmas ghost story come in?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you if you will have just a little more patience.
Well, I have said that I was interested in the Catchpoles, I even
went to see them once or twice. They seemed to me to be what used
to be called 'human documents'&mdash;the very fact that they had
such blank faces made me want to study them. I know there must be
some repression somewhere, some desire, some hope, something
beside what there appeared on the surface&mdash;this blank
negation. They did not betray themselves. Louisa said she missed
the old lady and that she was having quite a handsome headstone
put on her grave in the vast London cemetery where she had been
laid to rest. James spoke of the old lady with a certain
deference, as if the fact of her being dead had made a saint of
Aunt Ursula Beane.</p>

<p>"I continually asked them if they had had any news of the
money. They shook their heads with a compassionate smile at my
hopefulness. They were convinced that during those five years
Aunt Ursula Beane had completely destroyed the forty-eight
thousand pounds&mdash;easily destroyed, for most of it had been
in hundred-and thousand-pound notes. Of course the garden had
been dug over and every brick and plank in the house disturbed,
with no result."</p>

<p>"And if she never left the house and garden?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They told me she had. She was a robust old woman, as I said
before, and she used to take long walks and every year during
those five years she went away for a fortnight&mdash;sometimes
with Louisa, sometimes with James, sometimes to the seaside and
sometimes to lodgings in a farmhouse, and on all these different
occasions she had had plenty of opportunity of getting rid of her
money. Of course these five several lodgings had been searched
and the country round about them, but always with no result."</p>

<p>"You see, sir," said James, with his meek and placid smile,
his pale faded eyes gleaming at me behind the glasses, "she was
far too cunning for all of us."</p>

<p>One winter evening about a year after the inquest the mood
took me to go and visit these two curious specimens. I found them
with a planchette, their eyes goggling at the sprawling writing
that appeared on the piece of paper beneath. James informed me
without excitement that they had 'taken up' spiritualism, and
Miss Louisa chirped in that they were getting 'the most wonderful
results.'</p>

<p>Aunt Ursula Beane had 'come through,' as they put it, almost
at once, and was now in constant communication with them.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope she can tell you what she did with the
money."</p>

<p>They answered me quite seriously that that was what they were
trying to find out, but that the old lady was just as tricky and
malicious on the other side, as they termed it, as she had been
on this, luring them on with false scents and wayward
suggestions. At the same time, they declared, placidly but with
intense conviction, they believed that sooner or later she would
disclose to them her secret.</p>

<p>I soon began to lose interest in them after this. When people
of the type of the Catchpoles get mixed up with this
spiritualistic business they cease to be&mdash;well, almost cease
to be 'human documents.' I thought I'd leave 'em to it, when I
received a rather urgent invitation from Miss Louisa Catchpole,
begging me to be present at a 'demonstration' at which Aunt
Ursula Beane would undoubtedly appear in person. I went to the
little house in Peckham where the furniture, the wallpaper, even
the atmosphere did not appear to have been changed all those
monotonous forty years&mdash;forty-one now to be exact. There was
a medium present and no one else save myself and the brother and
sister. We sat round the table. The medium who beamed with a
rather fussy kindness went off with surprising celerity into a
trance, and soon the 'demonstration' took place.</p>

<p>At first I was cynical, secondly I was disgusted, and thirdly,
I was rather disturbed, finding myself first in the midst of
farce, low charlatanry and chicanery, then suddenly in the
presence of something which I could not understand. The
'demonstration' began by groans and squeaks issuing from the lips
of the medium, greetings to Louisa and James (presumably in the
voice of the defunct Aunt Ursula), various jovial references to a
bottle containing poison, a few other crude remarks of that
nature, and then several knocks from different parts of the
room&mdash;rappings loud and quick, and then beating time, as if
to a piece of music, then a sudden clatter on the table in the
middle of us as if the old lady were dancing there with heavy
boots on. James and Louisa sat side by side, their hands clasped,
listening to all this without a shade of expression on their
blank faded faces. The hideous little room was the last resort of
the antimacassar, and presently these began to fly about, scraps
of the horrible white crocheted tatting gliding through the air
in a way which would have been very funny if it hadn't been
rather dreadful. Of course I knew that many mediums have these
powers and there is nothing much in them&mdash;I mean, it can all
be explained in a perfectly practical and satisfactory fashion.
At the same time I did not greatly care about the exposition, and
I begged the Catchpoles to bring it to an end, particularly as
the old lady had nothing definite to say. James whispered that
the medium must not be disturbed while she was in trance. Aunt
Ursula Beane then began to sing a hymn, but with a very
unpleasant inflection, worse than any outspoken mockery. While
the hymn was being sung I gained the impression far more vividly
than I had ever received before that Aunt Ursula Beane had been a
rather terrible person. When she had finished the hymn she began
in an old half-broken voice softly to curse them all in a
language that was not at all agreeable to listen to, coming as it
did in those querulous, ancient feminine tones. This was rather
too much for me, and I shook the medium violently. She came out
of her trance. Louisa and James did not seem in the least
affected, drank tea, ate biscuits, and discussed in banal terms
the doings of those on 'the other side.'</p>

<p>I received no more invitations from the Catchpoles and did not
go near them for a considerable time. In fact, I think I had
rather forgotten about them, as I had had a great many other
interesting cases and a good many other interesting specimens had
come my way. I had heard a vast number of stories as good as the
story of Aunt Ursula Beane, but it did happen one day that I had
to pass through Peckham and could not resist the passing impulse
of curiosity that urged me to go and look at the house on the
Common. It was 'To Let' or 'To be Sold,' according to two or
three estate agents' blatant boards on the front railing. I
called next door and was received with the inevitable suspicion
with which the stranger is usually regarded in small places. I
did, however, discover what I had set out to discover, namely,
that the Catchpoles had left the neighborhood about six months
ago, and no one knew where they were. I took the trouble to go to
one of the estate agents whose address was given on the board, to
make further enquiries. The house was to be let or sold, it did
not seem to have been considered a great prize, and it certainly
had not gone off very quickly, though it was cheap enough; the
neighborhood, even the estate agent admitted, 'was not what it
had been.' Then, of course, one couldn't deny that the Ursula
Beane case and the fact that the old lady had died there, and of
poison, had given a slightly sinister air to the modest stucco
building. As to the Catch-poles, the estate agent did not know
where they had gone; all he had was the address of a bank, nor
was it any of my business, so I decided to dismiss the whole
thing from my mind.</p>

<p>Good raw material, no doubt, but none of it worked up
sufficiently to be of much interest.</p>

<p>Linley glanced round at us all triumphantly as he said
this.</p>

<p>"But it was all rounded off as neatly as any novelist could do
it. Let me tell you," he added with unction.</p>

<p>Five years afterwards I ran over to Venice for
Christmas&mdash;I don't know why, except just the perverse desire
to see the wrong place at the wrong time, instead of forever the
right place at the right time. I like Venice in the winter fogs,
with a thin coat of ice on the canals, and if you can get a
snowstorm&mdash;well, so much the better&mdash;St. Marco, to me,
looks preferable with the snowflakes in front of the blue and the
bronze instead of that eternal sunshine...Well, there I was in
Venice, and I'm not going to bore you with any more local color
or picturesque details. I was in Venice, very well satisfied with
myself, very comfortable and alone. I was tolerably familiar with
the city and I always stay at the same hotel. One of the first
things I noticed was that a large and very pretentious palace
near by had recently been handsomely and expensively 'done up'; I
soon elicited the fact that the place which I had always envied
had been bought by the usual rich American who had spent a great
deal of money in restoring and furnishing it, but who did not
very often live there, he only came and went after the fashion of
all Americans, and was supposed to travel considerably in great
luxury. Once or twice I saw this American going past in a
gondola, wrapped in a foreign, rather theatrical-looking cloak,
lounging with a sort of ostentation of ease on the cushions. He
was an elderly man with a full grey beard, and wore, even now in
the winter, blue sunglasses. On two separate occasions when I was
sitting on the hotel balcony in the mild winter sunlight and he
was being rowed past underneath I had the impression that he was
looking at me sharply and keenly behind those colored spectacles,
and also the impression, which was likely enough to be correct,
that I had seen him before. I meet, of course, a great many
people, but even with a memory on which I rather pride myself,
cannot immediately place everyone. The hotel at which I was
staying&mdash;and this was one of the reasons I always selected
it&mdash;did not have any of those ghastly organized gaieties at
Christmas; we were left to ourselves in a poetic gloom best
suited to the season and the city. I was seated by myself
enjoying a delicious kind of mournful repose, piquantly in
contrast with my usual life, when I received a message and a very
odd one: the gentleman, Signor Hayden, the American from next
door, would very much like to see me. He had observed me on the
balcony, knew my name and my profession, and requested the honor
of my company. Attracted by anything queer or the least out of
the way, I at once accepted, and in ten minutes or so found
myself in the newly-restored palace which I had so often admired
and envied. The place was furnished with a good deal of taste,
but rather, I suspected, the orthodox taste of the professional
decorator. Mr. Hayden was not immediately visible, but, I
understood, in bed ill; I expressed my willingness to go to his
bedside and was shortly conducted there. The room was very
handsome, the servants very well trained, and I was impressed by
the fact that this rich American must be very rich indeed. One
knows, of course, what these out-of-the-way little caprices of
newly-restored palaces in Venice cost. The owner of this
up-to-date luxury was in bed, propped up with pillows and shaded
by old-fashioned mauve velvet curtains. He still wore the colored
glasses, and I concluded that he had some defect in his sight. He
appeared to see me perfectly well, however, and beckoned to me to
approach his bedside. As I did so he removed his glasses; there
was an electric standard lamp on an antique table by the bedside
and the light of it was turned full on to the sick man's face,
which I immediately recognized. I was looking down into the
faded, mild, light-blue eyes of James Catchpole.</p>

<p>"Very odd that you should be here," he smiled at me, "very odd
indeed. You've always been interested in us and I thought perhaps
you'd like to hear the end of the story, that is, if any story
ever does end; there's a pause in ours at this point,
anyway."</p>

<p>I expressed due surprise and gratification at seeing him. In
truth, I was considerably amazed. I was startled, too, to see how
ill he was. He asked me to help him up in bed. He declared,
without emotion, that he knew himself to be dying.</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Louisa?" I asked&mdash;"where is your
sister?"</p>

<p>"She died last year," he answered placidly. "She had a
thoroughly good time for four years and I suppose it killed her,
you know; but, of course, it was worth it, she always said
so."</p>

<p>The inevitable conclusion had jumped to my mind.</p>

<p>"You found Miss Ursula Beane's hoard?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"James Catchpole, passing his hand over the full grey beard
which had so changed his face, replied simply:</p>

<p>"We never lost it&mdash;we had it all the time."</p>

<p>"You mean <i>you</i>?" I asked dubiously, and he nodded and
replied:</p>

<p>"Exactly!"</p>

<p>"That you&mdash;?" I suggested, and this time he nodded and
said:</p>

<p>"Precisely!"</p>

<p>"Louisa persuaded her to realize her capital," he continued
with childish calm. "She was a proper miser and she rather
fretted not having the actual stuff in her hands. It wasn't
difficult to make her get it&mdash;she liked a real hoard, a
thing you can put under the hearthstone or in the mattress, you
know. We thought we should get hold of it easier that way when
she came to die. You never knew with anyone like that what she
might do in the way of a will, she was keen on lost cats and
Christians. We thought she would enjoy herself playing with it,
and then we'd get it if we were patient enough."</p>

<p>He blinked up at me and added, with the faintest of ironic
smiles&mdash;"We'd been patient for forty years, don't you
suppose we spent some part of that time planning what we would do
with the money? We were both engaged, to start with, but her
young man and my young woman couldn't wait all those years...We
read a good deal, we made lists of things we wanted, and places
we wanted to go to...We had quite a little library of
guide-books, you may have noticed them on the bookshelf&mdash;one
of them was a guide to Venice. Louisa, writing her piffling
articles, and I at my piffling job, to and fro&mdash;well, you
don't suppose we didn't have our ideas?"</p>

<p>"I see," I said doubtfully, "and then, when there was that
little misfortune about the arsenic, I suppose you didn't care to
mention the hoard?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have been altogether wise, sir, would it?' smiled
James Catchpole simply. It would have thrown a lot of suspicion
on us, and we'd been very careful. There wasn't any proof, not a
shred. We had to wait until the case had blown over a bit, and
then we&mdash;well, we did the best we could with the time that
was left us. We lived at the rate of ten thousand a year. We had
the best of everything...Of course it was the pace&mdash;don't
you call it?&mdash;that killed. We were neither of us young, and
we knew we couldn't stand it for long, so we enjoyed ourselves
thoroughly, believe me, sir, <i>thoroughly</i>."</p>

<p>"He paused and added reflectively:</p>

<p>"But it's a good thing we made a move when we did, we
shouldn't have been able to get about at seventy;
<i>she</i>&mdash;she might have gone on to a hundred and
ten."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you&mdash;?" I suggested quietly.</p>

<p>"It was the easiest thing in the world," he smiled, "to drop a
couple of those dog powders into her milk..."</p>

<p>I'd always been intensely interested in murderers. I tried to
question James Catchpole as to his motives, his sensations, his
possible remorse; he appeared to have had none of any of
these...</p>

<p>"You didn't regret it afterwards, you haven't felt the Furies
behind you, or anything of that sort?"</p>

<p>He replied, as far as his feeble strength would permit:</p>

<p>"I have enjoyed myself thoroughly. I wish we hadn't waited so
long."</p>

<p>I was puzzled. They had always seemed such very nice
people.</p>

<p>"I am dying now," said James Catchpole, "and it's about time,
for I've spent all the money. The doctor said my next heart
attack would be fatal, and I've done my best to bring one on. I
couldn't go back to lack of money."</p>

<p>"Who are you going to leave all this to?" I asked with
professional interest. I glanced round the handsome room.</p>

<p>He smiled at me with what I thought was compassion.</p>

<p>"I haven't been so silly as all that," he replied. "Everything
that I possess wouldn't pay half of my debts. I have had full
value, I can assure you. After all, I had a right to it, hadn't
I? I'd waited long enough."</p>

<p>"What about the planchette and the demonstrations?" I asked.
"I suppose all that was a fake to throw us off the scent?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," he declared, in what seemed to be hurt surprise,
"that was perfectly genuine. We made up our minds to get in touch
with Aunt Ursula Beane, to find out what she thought about it
all."</p>

<p>"And what did she think?" I asked, startled.</p>

<p>"She said we were a couple of fools not to have done it
sooner."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Catchpole," I cried, something shocked, "this
is unseemly jesting."</p>

<p>"No jesting at all," he assured me. "Aren't I dying myself? I
shall be in the old girl's company in a few minutes, I daresay.
You heard her yourself, sir, dancing on the table that evening.
She said she'd been a perfect fool herself, and now that she'd
'got over' she realized it. She said if we didn't have a good
time, or someone didn't have a good time with that damn money,
she'd never forgive us. You see, sir, at first we began to have
that miserly feeling too and didn't want to spend it. We thought
we'd go on hoarding it, living just the same and knowing it was
there. She used to scribble out on the planchette saying what
idiots we were. That's why she used all that strong language.
'You've got it&mdash;now use it!' That was what she always said.
'I'll go with you and share in your good time'&mdash;and so she
has, sir, believe me. We've often seen her sitting at the table
with us, nodding over the champagne; she'd have been fond of
champagne if she'd allowed herself...We've seen her dancing in
some of those jazz-halls, we've seen her in boxes listening to
opera, we've seen her sitting in the Rolls-Royce revelling in the
cushions and the speed...Remorse? Why, I tell you we've given the
old girl the good time she ought to have had years ago."</p>

<p>"Come, come, James Catchpole," I said, "you're delirious. I'd
better fetch the doctor."</p>

<p>He smiled at me with compassion and some contempt.</p>

<p>"You're a clever lawyer," he said, "but there are a lot of
things you don't understand."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he seemed to fall into a peaceful sleep and I
thought it was my responsibility to fetch a doctor. Of course I
believed hardly anything he said&mdash;I thought it was quite
likely that he hadn't poisoned Aunt Ursula Beane, but that he had
invented the story. At the same time there was the hard concrete
evidence of the palace, the servants, the furniture&mdash;he had
got money from somewhere.</p>

<p>"Good raw material, eh? Think what you could make of it if you
wrote it up!"</p>

<p>I went downstairs, telephoned on my own responsibility to the
address of one of the English doctors. It was Christmas Eve and I
could not find him at home. I was quite uncertain what to do. I
stood hesitant at the foot of the wide magnificent staircase,
when I observed a dreadful old woman creeping up the stairs with
a look of intense enjoyment on her face&mdash;Mrs. Ursula
Beane&mdash;not a doubt of it&mdash;Aunt Ursula Beane! I saw her
so clearly that I could have counted the stitches in the darns at
the elbows of her black sleeves. I ran up after her, but of
course she was there before I was. When I carne up to the bedside
James Catchpole was dead, with an extremely self-satisfied smug
smile on his face.</p>

<p>There's my Christmas Eve ghost! An hallucination, of course,
but you can give it all the usual explanation. There's the story,
you can put it together as you will. There's plenty of stuff in
it&mdash;good raw material, eh?&mdash;take it how you will.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a> THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL</h2>

<h3>A HOLIDAY IN ITALY&mdash;1912</h3>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="first">
THE dark-eyed invalid sat on the hotel terrace in the sun,
looking sometimes at the sea and sometimes at a great tower of
roses&mdash;the small cream and pink tight-curled roses of the
Italian Riviera, that stood on the little table by his side. The
winter sun gleamed on a clean plaza and the neat sweep of the
white road and pavement; the town was more fashionable in the
spring than now, and there were only a few people about, these
mostly well dressed and melancholy like the man sitting on the
bare terrace who was looking sometimes at the smooth blue sea and
sometimes at the curled pink roses.</p>

<p>He was a young man and his exotic type of Southern good looks
was set off by very expensive English clothes; a costly rug was
over his knees and his comfortable cane chair was filled with
fine silk pillows. An English newspaper, a novel, and several
opened letters had slipped to the ground beside him; medicine was
on the table but it was concealed by the roses. A look of peevish
indifference made dull a face whose chief charm should have lain
in sparkling animation. The best part of the countenance lay in
the large eyes and sweeping brows, the thrown-back black hair,
the low forehead that gave an impression of
simplicity&mdash;almost of nobility; but the nose and lips were
too coarse, the chin too feeble for real beauty or pleasantness.
Still he was effective and generally considered extremely
handsome.</p>

<p>Presently he stretched out the long dry fingers of a sick man
and picked up the card that lay among the roses. It bore a
coronet and the name of a Portuguese Countess. Her rank impressed
him more than her petting; he had taken pains to find out from
the hotel manager that she really was of high birth and rank, one
of the old royalist Portuguese families that had lost everything
in the late revolution&mdash;or, if not everything in the
strictest sense of the word, at least most of what they had
possessed before. She was staying in the same hotel for the same
reason; her health was delicate and she was ordered to the south
for the winter. Despite the family disasters caused by the
downfall of the royal family she had always served, she travelled
with a companion and two maids, and everything she did was done
well, both as regards money, taste and distinction.</p>

<p>The man on the terrace was thinking of these things as he
stared at the coroneted card; they had a great attraction for
him, and the peevish expression lifted slightly from his face as
he reflected on all the attentions this great lady had shown him,
from cups of chocolate specially made, brought up by her maid, to
long talks in some corner of the deserted public rooms, or in the
barren gardens where the palm trees rose from the sand. She was
not young and she was very plain, and to the judgment of a
Southern Italian these were two laughable defects; but she was an
aristocrat and she flattered him, and the slow stately manner of
her advances suited the enfeeblement of a sick mind and body.</p>

<p>He heard her step in the room behind him (the great arid
drawing-room with the closed grand piano and the stiff velvet
chairs), and had just time to drop her card among the letters
before she came on to the terrace. Just as he had also kept
it&mdash;&mdash;this card that had come with her first
gift&mdash;because it gave him pleasure to see her titles and the
coronet, so, from the same motives of childish vanity, he did not
wish her to know that he did so.</p>

<p>The lady came out into the sunshine. She was thin and brown as
a withered twig, but she was exquisitely dressed in white serge
and lace, ermine and satin with ornaments of tiny diamonds, and
she had the air, for all her ugliness, of something rare and
choice&mdash;an aroma of fascinating femininity.</p>

<p>The young man made no effort to rise; he always took full
advantage of his privileges as an invalid, but he smiled, showing
his fine white teeth.</p>

<p>"You are out early," said the lady, seating herself by the
table, "but one must take advantage of the lovely sun. You are
better this morning?" Neither could speak the language of the
other, so they conversed in French which gave an air of formality
to their intercourse.</p>

<p>On the subject of his illness he was voluble; there was
nothing really the matter with him, only a little cough, left
from an old attack of bronchitis; and of course he was run down;
and equally of course he was getting the wrong treatment.</p>

<p>"But you like your new doctor?" asked the lady, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I think his medicine has done me a great deal of
good, I have had three quite easy nights. No, I mean that I
should not be here alone&mdash;with no one to look after me."</p>

<p>"That is quite true," said the lady, with a glance of warm
sympathy in her large eager eyes. "I can understand that. You
must be very lonely."</p>

<p>"I am very lonely," tears of self-pity at once wetted the
invalid's lids. "Until you spoke to me I had not exchanged a word
with a soul beyond the hotel staff and the doctor since I came
here."</p>

<p>"It is shameful," she murmured. "Why do you not go south to
your people?"</p>

<p>"I have been trouble enough to them," he replied. "One does
not want to be a burden. Besides, the English doctors
particularly recommended this climate&mdash;not too hot."</p>

<p>The lady glanced at the pile of letters.</p>

<p>"You have not heard from your wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"She is coming out here?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>A dreary silence fell between them; their bloodless faces grew
pinched; the lady pulled at her gift of roses; she was picturing
the English wife who had sent off her delicate husband alone to
cure himself in a foreign hotel, picturing the English home he
had so often spoken of, where she was now comfortable, surrounded
by relations and friends while he dragged out this lonely,
starved existence. There was no lack of means, that was obvious
from the young man's equipment, his lavishness with money, his
doctors and his treatments. Her maid had spoken of ivory and gold
dressing appointments, the profusion of his clothes, the luxury
of his room...he certainly had come from a rich home...the wife
must be frivolous&mdash;utterly hard.</p>

<p>She had never bean to England, but she had met Englishwomen
and she believed that they could be this&mdash;frivolous, utterly
hard, and her hatred of the alien woman increased. She permitted
herself daring and tender dreams; she had had much in her life,
never romantic.</p>

<p>The young man was leaning back on his cushions, his dark eyes,
so heavily fringed by the thick lashes, were regarding her
wistfully, with, she thought, a veiled entreaty. Why should she
consider the wife?&mdash;&mdash;she could not, could not; it must
have been a hideous mistake that marriage, the hard worldly woman
with the romantic arduous young man. North with South, flint with
fire. Should she not redeem this error and catch at these rays of
autumn sunshine that had come so sweetly into her life? They were
so equally matched; both had birth and money and leisure (she
knew quite well that these things were necessary to her), both
were in that delicate state of health when crude desires and
passionate impulses run low, both could exist only in this exotic
southern atmosphere of luxury, warmth and idleness. The lady
thrilled to the spur of romance; he was really very handsome and
looked at her with tender and wistful meaning; she felt that she
could be so much to him; with hands that quivered slightly with
excitement she raised the roses to a delicately flushed face and
in that moment resolved on the elopement.</p>

<h3>II. THE REVERSE</h3>

<p class="first">
THE lady was not deterred by the wire announcing the wife's
arrival; during the last few days she had advanced considerably
in her poignant and sentimental flirtation; and though the young
man was very chivalrous in his reserve, she had easily learnt how
unfortunate had been the marriage, what a failure had been the
wife. She thought she would be rather glad to see her rival, to
make her feel the contempt and aversion that were her due and
then to leave her in the lurch as she had left her husband, to
disappear with him under the other woman's very eyes and to leave
her foolish and humiliated in the strange hotel.</p>

<p>The elopement was not definitely planned, not spoken of even,
but it was very much in the air, very much thought about by both
of them, and both knew that the other was resolved on this
extreme step.</p>

<p>Into this atmosphere came the English wife. The lady, sitting
exquisitely at ease, in the lounge, very finely gowned, very cool
and pleasant, saw her arrive; she came without a maid and with
very little baggage, and she was, contrary to all forecasts and
expectations on the part of the lady, extremely dowdy.</p>

<p>Her dark cloth dress looked as if she had made it herself; she
wore an imitation fur coat, and (horrible contrast) a straw hat
of a dismal prune colour; she was tall and plain, pleasant and
clever; the lady watched her out of sight with a dubious
glance.</p>

<p>That evening the invalid did not appear; he was dining
upstairs with his wife; the lady sat alone wondering about
several things&mdash;why this woman had come at all, why she was
so dowdy, even shabby, so meek and amiable-looking&mdash;the
prospective triumph was largely robbed of its piquancy and
point&mdash;there would not be, to a great lady, much pleasure in
humiliating that modest, rather pathetic figure.</p>

<p>Into the great, empty drawing-room, perfumed by the freesias
lavishly crowded into every vase, the English wife came slowly
like an embodiment of the lady's thoughts and sat down beside her
on the long settee in the shaded corner behind the grand piano.
She introduced herself, in French, with rather faltering
simplicity; the lady replied, with a freezing sweetness. With
some relief the Englishwoman took up the conversation.</p>

<p>"You have been so very kind to my husband, he has been telling
me about it&mdash;-thank you so much."</p>

<p>"It was a pleasure to be of any assistance to one so
lonely."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose he was lonely."</p>

<p>"Naturally&mdash;with no one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was never meant to come here," said the wife, "he went to
his own people in the south, but they didn't get on well
together, so he came back here to wait for me."</p>

<p>The lady smiled, swinging her costly chain with well-kept
hands; she was really rather enjoying the extreme dowdiness and
plainness of the other woman, who looked, on a near view, quite
haggard and old.</p>

<p>"You ought to have come with your husband," she said,
coolly.</p>

<p>"It was impossible."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Quite impossible."</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, and her keen, humorous mouth set in a
firm line.</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you about that. I think it best to have
everything clear from the first&mdash;the English way, you
know...."</p>

<p>At this bluntness a sneer curled the lady's thin lip; yet in
her heart she was startled by the quickness of the other's
perception which had evidently seen all there was to see&mdash;or
had the husband made an indiscreet confession? She sat stiffly,
her claws sheathed.</p>

<p>"I have had a long talk with my husband, and think that I
understand everything clearly."</p>

<p>Her tone was so business-like that the other was
nonplussed.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" she queried, groping her way.</p>

<p>"Yes. Though he did not say anything definitely. He would not,
of course. Not that type of man."</p>

<p>"You speak very unkindly of your husband."</p>

<p>"Do I? I don't mean to. I was just stating fact. You see, I
know him rather well."</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;as he would know you."</p>

<p>"That is just it&mdash;I am afraid he doesn't know me at all.
That is why I couldn't speak to him. But you look very
sensible&mdash;I'm sure you would understand at once."</p>

<p>"I am not stupid."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I can see that&mdash;therefore, I'm sure you are
under a mistake."</p>

<p>"A mistake?"</p>

<p>The English wife looked with kindly earnestness at her
questioner.</p>

<p>"I'm rather used to reading between the lines," she said, "and
you won't mind if I speak quite plainly?"</p>

<p>"You have been speaking&mdash;very plainly indeed."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I dare say it has seemed rather crude to you. I've
never had leisure for hesitations and subtleties."</p>

<p>"Never had leisure?" The great lady was plainly surprised.</p>

<p>"No, I have had to earn my living&mdash;ever since I was
sixteen. I was always good at things, and now I do pretty well
with fashion&mdash;articles and drawings, you know. I've got a
name now and I get a good price for the stuff."</p>

<p>"You <i>earn</i> your living?&mdash;but&mdash;your
husband?"</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. He was in an office when I married him,
but he soon had to leave because of his health&mdash;that is four
years ago and since then I have had to do everything."</p>

<p>"Everything?"</p>

<p>"All the expenses. Illness is so costly and he had so many
whims. I expect," there was a faint gleam of laughter in her
tired eyes, "that you have noticed that he likes everything of
the best; that is what attracts him to you&mdash;because you are
costly."</p>

<p>The lady was reduced to silence; she stared with a look almost
of panic at the outspoken wife.</p>

<p>"It has been a great strain. And when the doctors told me last
autumn that he would have to go to Italy, I felt it could hardly
be done. But I did raise the money and sent him off to his
people&mdash;but&mdash;well, you see they are very simple and I
think he had got rather spoilt and he quarrelled with them, and
came back here."</p>

<p>"And why did you not come with him?" asked the other, rather
faintly.</p>

<p>"I had to stay behind to earn the money&mdash;you see, I got a
rather big contract for a paper and I could not leave England
till it was finished."</p>

<p>"I don't know why you tell all this to me."</p>

<p>"Because I know that he never will&mdash;and you ought to
know," answered the wife, simply. "He's my job, in a way, and
I've undertaken to look after him, and if you are going to take
it on I should like you to know how matters stand."</p>

<p>"This illness, then?&mdash;he is getting better, is he
not?"</p>

<p>"He will never get any better. Of course he does not know
it."</p>

<p>A dying, penniless man...the lady shivered in the shadows.</p>

<p>"Naturally," added the other, "it would be the most
<i>tremendous</i> relief if you <i>did</i> take him away. It has
been a great strain, and it may last a long time yet."</p>

<p>"You are a very cold-blooded woman."</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"And I am sorry for your husband."</p>

<p>"You have the chance of making it up to him&mdash;if you
<i>really</i> love him you ought to be very happy&mdash;we hear
so much about that&mdash;the joy of service, the sacrifice of
love."</p>

<p>She was not in the least sarcastic but quite decisive and
calm.</p>

<p>"So I suppose," she continued, "that you are very glad of this
chance of showing how much you care and what you can do for
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was the shortest pause during which the lady gathered
her forces to offer a complete denial of everything&mdash;to
enquire with annoyed irony, what the other meant? But she was too
emotionally overwhelmed to do this instantly, and while she
faltered, the other made it impossible for her to speak at
all.</p>

<p>"Please don't try and deny that what I have said is true. That
would be rather foolish, wouldn't it? And cheap. Good night, now,
and let me know in the morning what you have decided."</p>

<p>She rose, with a little nod, and left the lady staring into
the shadowed emptiness of the hotel drawing-room. She was not
much in doubt of the issue of this conversation; as she went
upstairs to minister to the querulous invalid her heart was
heavy.</p>

<p>"I wish I <i>didn't</i> always have to play fair," she
thought, "but perhaps after all <i>she</i> will take
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>But during the tiresome vigil of her watch by the sick man (he
was very ill that night, from excitement, perhaps) she heard the
furtive packing of her rival, the running to and fro of the maid,
the hasty lies whispered to the night porter, of the sudden
summons elsewhere&mdash;and, bitterly, she thought again:</p>

<p>"I <i>wish</i> I did not always have to play fair."</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a> COLONEL DE POMENARS AND TWO
LADIES</h2>

<h3>A SCENE IN A FRENCH CHÂTEAU&mdash;1918</h3>

<p class="first">
THE queer figure in the niche in the ancient tower had been
old, very old, when that ancient tower was built. With pain and
suffering, with toilsome effort, this image had been dragged up
from the abysses of time as a deep-sea monster is drawn from the
secret depths of the ocean.</p>

<p>As in the rare monstrous fish, so in this strange grey statue
was there something loathsome, almost obscene, as if, in each
case, there was something better not meddled with, reluctant to
face the light, antagonistic, too old, too grotesque, too
mysterious.</p>

<p>The man who found this basalt figure, deep, deep, in the earth
of Africa, Claude de Pomenars, the famous explorer, had called it
"The Moon at Carthage"; to the casual eye the figure had no
meaning. Draped, veiled, masked, almost it seemed there was
nothing tangible about the sexless shape save the blunt horned
moon set above the fiat swathed head.</p>

<p>Goddess, devil, beast or woman, the thing was as famous as the
man who had discovered it; during his life it had been exhibited
all over the world, then rested awhile in the Musee du Louvre.
After his death it came into the possession of his friend, Madame
du Vernis, and she placed it in the tower which served as her
private apartments in the Château du Vernis.</p>

<p>Everything in the tower chamber was old and beautiful,
tapestries, furniture, pictures, but all of to-day as compared
with the grey statue.</p>

<p>Madame du Vernis had a very fine taste in everything; she was
a woman a little apart from the life and movement of her day; she
did nothing, had never done anything, never would do anything,
yet she gave the impression of an intense and active personality,
grave, almost austere, but radiant with ardent life. A childless
woman, she was neither humiliated nor thwarted by this fact; wife
of a man, dry, cold, twenty years older than herself, she was
untouched by either scandal or bitterness.</p>

<p>Beautiful; she never used her beauty as an asset. Wealthy; she
ignored her riches.</p>

<p>There was something in her still loveliness, her serene
silence, her impassive, yet ardent life, akin to the statue that
Claude de Pomenars left her when he died.</p>

<p>He had been killed in the war, at Soissons. Madame du Vernis'
château was then a hospital, and the great explorer had requested
that if wounded he might be sent there, but he died within a few
hours of his wound and the statue came alone to Madeleine du
Vernis.</p>

<p>She spent most of her leisure time in the tower chamber that
was like a room in a fairy tale, with the medixval arras, low
wide chairs and lancet-shaped windows looking on to the park, and
the few steps that led to the other little turret-room where
Madeleine du Vernis had her books, her desk and her work, her
spinning-wheel and lace pillow.</p>

<p>This clear day of autumn the mistress of the tower was away in
the deer park with young de Merinville, the last of her patients
who lingered on at the château, still wan, still crippled, still
shuddering from contact with the world of strong common
things.</p>

<p>His father and his stepmother were guests at the château for a
few days, and this afternoon there were others in the quiet
house, members of a Committee for the Care of the Wounded, who
were organizing a large exhibition in Paris for which men like
the Marquis du Vernis were lending their treasures.</p>

<p>His wife had entertained them all very graciously at lunch,
she would entertain them again very graciously at tea, but she
did not care to go with them over the château, nor exhibit to
them the queer grey statue that of course they must be shown.</p>

<p>The western sun was tinging the mellow-coloured room with gold
when the gentlemen, conducted by M. du Vernis, stood in front of
that queer, swathed mysterious figure which stood in an alcove
especially made by the window and directly under an elaborate
iron lantern, hanging from a bracket.</p>

<p>The Marquis, a spare quiet man, indicated the figure.</p>

<p>"This is the de Pomenars' statue," he said.</p>

<p>"Venus?" asked General de Merinville.</p>

<p>"De Pomenars called it 'The Moon at Carthage,'" replied the
host.</p>

<p>"Meaning?"</p>

<p>"Ah, General&mdash;the meaning&mdash;of a man of genius?"</p>

<p>"You think de Pomenars a genius?" asked one of the
Committee.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said du Vernis, drily.</p>

<p>"He had that reputation," remarked another, "but whether a
great explorer can be called a genius&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Count," interrupted du Vernis, "a romantic career, an
attractive personality, a heroic death&mdash;to achieve these, is
it not genius?"</p>

<p>A suave sentence from a third member of the deputation covered
the sub-acid in the Marquis' speech.</p>

<p>"The statue at least is wonderful&mdash;horrible perhaps.
Venus or who? 'The Moon at Carthage'&mdash;Well, who saw the Moon
at Carthage&mdash;perhaps that was de Pomenars' meaning? or
simply&mdash;the unattainable. The thing one will never see."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied M. du Vernis, "it is the most important of
his African discoveries, he thought her marvellous."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of approval, of acknowledgment, the
spokesman of the deputation said gratefully:</p>

<p>"It will be the most valued addition to the Exhibition,
Marquis&mdash;with this and the pictures you have been too
generous&mdash;our only apology is our cause&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"Vicomte, if you care to ask for everything in the château I
shall be honoured&mdash;and de Pomenars&mdash;he gave <i>all</i>
for France, he would be pleased to give this&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he finished speaking Madame du Vernis entered; she had
hoped that her chamber would be free of the intruders, on
learning that they were still there a vague sense of irritation
had brought her to her domain.</p>

<p>All the gentlemen turned to face her as she stood, in her
plain grey dress and black fur, pale and dark against the blurred
tints of the tapestry with a cluster of vivid autumn berries and
leaves in her gloved right hand.</p>

<p>Her husband spoke at once.</p>

<p>"The Committee have selected de Pomenars' statue, Madeleine. I
think de Pomenars would be pleased. I have just said so."</p>

<p>"But this is impossible," said Madame du Vernis, quickly.</p>

<p>"Madeleine?"</p>

<p>"I really could not lend that, Henri," returned the wife,
nervously. "Anything else. Messieurs, you will understand, a
personal gift from a dead friend, standing in my own room."</p>

<p>"Marquise," replied the spokesman, persuasively, "the statue
will be as safe as in your own château&mdash;insurance and all
precautions will be undertaken by the Committee."</p>

<p>"Insurance!" answered the lady quickly, "Comte, I cannot lend
the statue."</p>

<p>"But I have promised," said her husband, coldly.</p>

<p>There was a murmur, polite, delicate, among the gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Of course, if the Marquise objects," said one, "I hardly
understood&mdash;"</p>

<p>But General de Merinville interrupted, and looking at the lady
pointedly, added to the other's broken speech.</p>

<p>"I am sure the Marquise can have no real objection. The
exhibition is for the wounded&mdash;the incurables. I speak as
the friend of the Marquise's childhood."</p>

<p>The eyes of Madame du Vernis shone bright in the shade of her
plumed hat.</p>

<p>"But I have an objection, General&mdash;and you have half the
treasures in France and the best of our poor collection, the
Velasquez, the Rubens, the Henri Deux ware and the Majolica. This
room and my little boudoir in the <i>tourelle</i> only contain my
personal belongings."</p>

<p>"Then, Madame," said de Merinville, still more pointedly,
"since the Marquis has been so generous, you will certainly want
to make some contribution&mdash;of these personal
belongings."</p>

<p>"I have other things," replied Madame du Vernis, in agitation.
"Why do you want this? It is even ugly&mdash;a mystery, perhaps a
fake."</p>

<p>"De Pomenars is the hero of the moment," replied the General.
"The public has its idols&mdash;he was one&mdash;and died for
France&mdash;no one will think of&mdash;fakes."</p>

<p>"Enough," interrupted du Vernis, coldly, "I have given my
promise. It is not affected by my wife's caprice. And of course
the statue is genuine."</p>

<p>As he turned away, there was a second's embarrassed pause,
then de Merinville spoke again.</p>

<p>"The statue goes to Paris to-day, Madame, and in a fortnight
will be returned to you."</p>

<p>"To-day!" exclaimed the lady. "Impossible! I
really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will take it down," interrupted de Merinville, "I am expert
in&mdash;these affairs."</p>

<p>"You'll need tools, General?" asked du Vernis.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>In a moment the tall soldier had lifted the queer grey statue
from the alcove and carefully handed it to his colleagues.</p>

<p>"I will have it packed for you," said du Vernis.</p>

<p>"No, Marquis! We have our own men in the car&mdash;Madame can
be assured of the greatest care&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rather glad to escape from the sombre eyes of the lady the two
gentlemen carried away the statue.</p>

<p>To the others du Vernis spoke, ignoring his wife.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the enamels?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me," replied the General, "I will arrange the empty
niche so as to be less offensive to the Marquise."</p>

<p>Du Vernis and the other gentlemen left, the Marquis saying, in
a tone of cutting reproof, as he passed his wife:</p>

<p>"You are ungracious, Madeleine."</p>

<p>But the lady did not move; her white gloved fingers were
pulling at the clusters of ripe berries she held, leaving on the
soft leather a faint red stain.</p>

<p>As the door closed de Merinville instantly turned to her,
holding out a packet of letters.</p>

<p>"You are very clever, General," she said, faintly.</p>

<p>"Merely observant."</p>

<p>She looked at the packet, thick and tightly tied, that he held
slackly.</p>

<p>"I too am observant," she said. "I knew you hated me."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Knew you were my enemy."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What but hatred could have made you guess that those letters
were hidden in that alcove, beneath the statue?"</p>

<p>"I was interested to find out why you adored that statue, why
you were here so frequently&mdash;why you kept this tower sacred,
as an oratory, even when you had your hospital open and
full&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You spied on me."</p>

<p>"You were not very discreet."</p>

<p>"An indifferent husband has made me careless, perhaps," said
the lady, bitterly. "With Henri one hardly troubles to be
discreet."</p>

<p>"I was not indifferent," replied the tall old soldier,
sternly, "I was very eager to&mdash;confirm my suspicions. I
arranged for the Committee to be brought here, to covet the
statue, to take it away at once."</p>

<p>"So much is obvious. Please tell me why? We have not too long.
Your wife may be coming here soon."</p>

<p>"My wife," repeated de Merinville, "I am taking her away
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"From contamination, General?"</p>

<p>"Marquise!"</p>

<p>"But you meant it. Please be quick&mdash;will you give me
those letters or tell me their price?"</p>

<p>"Quite easily. I want you to send Louis home. I want my
son."</p>

<p>"Louis! The boy!" cried Madeleine du Vernis, in amazement.</p>

<p>"A man," the stern father reminded her, "a soldier and a de
Merinville."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," she replied, swiftly. "He is so
happy&mdash;here."</p>

<p>"Too happy."</p>

<p>Her serenity was troubled now; she took a full step
forward.</p>

<p>"Why, you do not think that I&mdash;why, one must
smile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He adores you," interrupted the severe masculine voice,
breaking in on her broken feminine accents, "you know that, of
course."</p>

<p>"Only as a boy adores a woman nearly old enough to be his
mother&mdash;and I, ah, General, I never had a son."</p>

<p>Not by a flicker of pity did he spare her.</p>

<p>"While your hospital was open it was natural he should be
here&mdash;now it is closed and your wounded have gone it is
natural that he should come home."</p>

<p>She still spoke eagerly.</p>

<p>"He is still only convalescent. His was the worst case we had.
He loves this place. Why should he not stay until he rejoins his
regiment?"</p>

<p>"Why should he not come home?"</p>

<p>She caught her breath a little and looked, in fixed agitation,
at her tightly grasped cluster of crushed berries.</p>

<p>"General, you have a young wife, as young as Louis&mdash;the
boy feels 'de trop.'"</p>

<p>"It is because of my wife that I want him home. I am
old-fashioned, Marquise, I believe in the influence of a good
woman&mdash;on a youth&mdash;like Louis."</p>

<p>She did not look up nor ease the anxious pucker of her
brows.</p>

<p>"A woman like&mdash;Madame de Merinville?"</p>

<p>"A woman innocent, good, sweet&mdash;like my wife."</p>

<p>The lady did lift her eyes now for just a flicker of a
glance.</p>

<p>"Not the woman who was&mdash;the lover of de Pomenars?" she
asked with her serene swift softness.</p>

<p>He answered swiftly also&mdash;not softly, he had long had his
weapons sharp and ready.</p>

<p>"If he was your son, Marquise, would you not think as I
think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should want to keep him from&mdash;false women, women
who played with love, married women with affairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>He challenged her pause.</p>

<p>"Well, Marquise?"</p>

<p>"I am not one of those women."</p>

<p>"You are not what Louis thinks you."</p>

<p>"What does he think me?"</p>

<p>"A saint&mdash;an angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, that does not hurt him"&mdash;sudden passion strained
her voice&mdash;"and it means a great deal to me. You have been
frank, General de Merinville&mdash;I will be franker&mdash;in my
life of failure, of repression, sad negation and secret
bitterness the affection of your son has been the one sweet and
pleasant thing. He has a nature like one of our ancient paladins
and I&mdash;have not betrayed that nature. That high and remote
affection that he cherishes for me will keep him safe until he
really&mdash;loves."</p>

<p>She moved slowly to the lancet window, let her safe gaze rest
for a moment on the empty niche, then turned it across the sunny
deer park, that prospect so sweetly still in the ruddy glow of
evening.</p>

<p>"At least you have him in thrall, Marquise, he has no thought
beyond you."</p>

<p>She answered without turning her head.</p>

<p>"No thought of another woman&mdash;but his whole heart belongs
to France."</p>

<p>He retorted quickly and even more drily.</p>

<p>"After what I have said it is impossible that you should
permit him to remain here, Marquise."</p>

<p>"All, why?" she asked, serenely. "You think I ought to feel
insulted. I am a strange creature, I suppose, General&mdash;but I
am still willing to keep Louis&mdash;for his own sake."</p>

<p>"The inordinate feminine vanity!" he cried, in deep
vexation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, "one likes to use one's power."</p>

<p>"You will use yours to keep Louis here?"</p>

<p>"If I thought it for his good&mdash;Louis is very dear to
me."</p>

<p>The father was moved now, flushed of face and rough of
voice.</p>

<p>"Then if you use your weapons&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her gentle tones checked him.</p>

<p>"You use&mdash;the letters? That is ugly."</p>

<p>"The whole situation is ugly."</p>

<p>She moved now and faced him with a look of melting
sweetness.</p>

<p>"Ah, General, you were my father's friend&mdash;you remember
me when I was&mdash;younger than Louis is now. I was like he is
now&mdash;I had my dreams! The Moon at Carthage, General, the
light that never will be re-lit, the city that will never be
rebuilt, the romance that will never glow any more. I lost it
all, all. Let Louis keep it, leave him with me and I will see
that he keeps it."</p>

<p>"I hardly understand," he replied, sternly.</p>

<p>With the same impulsive warmth she answered:</p>

<p>"I am very unhappy."</p>

<p>"You have the memory of&mdash;de Pomenars&mdash;doubtless a
golden one."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I have the memory of-de Pomenars," she agreed. "Ah,
well, then, Marquise, why, after the love of a man like that do
you need the devotion of a boy like Louis?"</p>

<p>"Because he is a boy. Tell me&mdash;was it not your wife who
inspired you to&mdash;this attempt to rescue Louis?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," he admitted, "she is hurt, Amelie&mdash;at his
prolonged absence&mdash;she is but a child herself, sensitive,
generous, impulsive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough! Enough!"</p>

<p>"But," he added, sternly, "she has not influenced me&mdash;do
you think that a woman like Amelie can have any conception
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A woman like me?"</p>

<p>"You have said it, Marquise."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Madame du Vernis, slowly.</p>

<p>"I know," continued the stiff soldier, gravely, "that it is a
ridiculous position&mdash;an old man, a young girl, but I am not
afraid of ridicule&mdash;Amelie is so exceptional, so
touching&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is beautiful, General, a perfect union&mdash;but hardly
affects our matter in hand. I want Louis to stay here with me.
And you and Amelie want him to go home with you. Well, when I
have told you the truth, General, you will understand&mdash;and
perhaps you also will not wish Louis to leave me."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Those letters you hold are not what you think them to be,
General."</p>

<p>"They are love letters?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Written by de Pomenars&mdash;or to de Pomenars, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, Marquise?"</p>

<p>"They are not written to me nor by me," she said, clearly.</p>

<p>"Not written to you&mdash;nor by you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;save one."</p>

<p>"To whom, then?"</p>

<p>"To a detestable woman," replied Madame du Vernis. "The woman
who broke his heart. I loved de Pomenars&mdash;like&mdash;ah,
well, what does that part of it matter? He did not love me. I was
merely his friend, his counsellor&mdash;his Egeria, perhaps. He
was&mdash;the sun at midday to my frigid, weary, spoilt life. I
lived in his glory, his triumphs, his toils&mdash;enough, he
loved this other woman and he was so sure of my steady friendship
that he told me the progress of his wooing. She was married, the
usual marriage&mdash;like mine!&mdash;she, well, I had to stand
by, he loved her so&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now he faltered in his stern attitude of judgment.</p>

<p>"Marquise, I have no right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," she continued, calm and merciless, "you would pry into
a woman's heart; you cannot close your eyes now. I will be brief
and plain. This woman never appreciated her great fortune! A
lover like de Pomenars! She was a born wanton. I think
he&mdash;tired her with his flights into ethereal
realms&mdash;the Moon at Carthage did not please her, she liked
the electric lights of the Boulevards. De Pomenars coming home
unexpected&mdash;a precious few hours in Paris, found her with
another man&mdash;you observe&mdash;the old trite situation. He
rushed back to Soissons and a few days later received his death
wound&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marquise, I beg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hear me out. He wanted to come to my little hospital
here&mdash;but he died before they could move him&mdash;he sent
me this packet of letters, hers to him, and some he had written
to her and never sent&mdash;with a covering letter scrawled on
his death-bed. Give them to me."</p>

<p>Silently he handed her the packet, she drew out the top paper,
then put the others into the empty niche.</p>

<p>Slowly she unfolded the rough paper, a sheet torn out of an
Army note-book, and handed it to General de Merinville.</p>

<p>"Read that&mdash;you know his writing?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Read it aloud."</p>

<p>In a low voice the proud old man read out the few lines
scribbled in pencil on the lined paper.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Written in I know not what mood by a dying man.
Take this record of a folly and do what you will. Crush her or
spare her. I am past it all. I meant to die and have been
fortunate. Now there is just this pain and the thought of you.
Madeleine, you have been so wonderful, an inspiration,
always&mdash;ah, if! if! Madeleine, good-bye.</p>

<br>

<p>There was a second's pause, then he said, as he gave her back
the paper:</p>

<p>"De Pomenars did love you, after all."</p>

<p>"He never said so," she returned, proudly. "You could show
that letter to my husband."</p>

<p>"Marquise, you have shamed me."</p>

<p>"You are convinced?"</p>

<p>"I humbly beg your forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was foolish to keep those letters&mdash;but I could
never tell if I would, as he says&mdash;crush or spare her. There
is no more to say."</p>

<p>"The woman?"</p>

<p>"The woman?"</p>

<p>"What of her?"</p>

<p>"She seeks a third lover. She is trying to fascinate a
boy&mdash;like Louis. What would you?&mdash;She runs her course
and I mine."</p>

<p>"She does not know that you have the letters?"</p>

<p>"No," said Madame du Vernis. "She thinks, I suppose, that he
destroyed them."</p>

<p>The outer door opened quickly, letting in a shaft of sunset
light and Madame de Merinville, infantile, rosy, delicate as a
Greuze portrait, in white and lavender, laughing, gay.</p>

<p>"Madeleine, are you not coming to give the gentlemen their
tea? They are waiting, dear."</p>

<p>Her husband gazed at her with eyes of doting affection.</p>

<p>"Amelie," he said, "I was just begging the Marquise to keep
Louis till he can rejoin his regiment."</p>

<p>The childish face clouded, the lovely lips quivered.</p>

<p>"Oh, but we want him at home," the girl pouted.</p>

<p>"Louis is happy here and in such good hands."</p>

<p>Amelie tossed her delicate head.</p>

<p>"It makes me feel that I have come between you," she
protested. "Ah&mdash;the statue has gone!"</p>

<p>She gazed with what seemed dismay at the empty niche.</p>

<p>"It is coming back," said the General. "The Committee feel
that after all they cannot take the responsibility&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How dark it has become," interrupted Madame du Vernis she lit
the lamp above the empty niche and the light gleamed on the
packet of letters.</p>

<p>Laughing, the girl crept up to the woman.</p>

<p>"Do let Louis come home&mdash;it is so dull and I am not
allowed to go to Paris yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You spoilt child," smiled her husband, but Madame du Vernis
did not answer.</p>

<p>The fair girl glanced at the packet of letters in the empty
niche, then at the still face of the elder woman.</p>

<p>"Louis stays," added the General, glancing at his hostess.
"Now, I must go and see they do not pack the statue."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The blonde beauty flushed into animation.</p>

<p>"You won't be hurt if he stays?" asked Madame du Vernis,
looking direct at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Relieved, rather. How should I have entertained my
great, big&mdash;son? Madeleine, they are waiting for
us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A moment&mdash;there is one of my treasures I want to show
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, then came into the room after closing the
door on her husband.</p>

<p>"What is it you want to show me?" she lisped, ingenuously.</p>

<p>"These letters."</p>

<p>Madame du Vernis snatched them up and held them out.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>The girl was not childish now nor lisping, but alert and
keen.</p>

<p>"Your letters&mdash;take them, I'll not be the keeper of your
conscience any longer!"</p>

<p>"My letters!"</p>

<p>"Yours to de Pomenars!"</p>

<p>Madame de Merinville had seized the packet and instantly
thrust it into the bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>"You are expert," observed Madame du Vernis.</p>

<p>The fair face, no longer infantile, but ferret sharp and
snarling, looked at the other woman, bitter with hate.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What do you want?" she asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Only to save Louis from you as I could not save de
Pomenars&mdash;come, let us join the others</i>."</p>

<p>Before the other could answer General de Merinville returned
and tenderly drew his young wife's arm through his own.</p>

<p>"You are sad, Marquise?" he said, regretfully.</p>

<p>"Sighing for the Moon&mdash;at Carthage!" she smiled.</p>

<p>"The statue is to be returned at once&mdash;the letters Ah, I
perceive the letters are gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Into oblivion, General&mdash;"</p>
