  <br>

  <p class="first">"I cry'd out: Well, I know not what to do, Lord direct me!
  and the like... and casting my eye on the 91st Psalm, I read to 7th verse
  exclusive and, after that, included the 10th, as follows:</p>

  <p class="first">'<i>I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress:
  my God; in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of
  the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His
  feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield
  and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the
  arrow that flieth by day. Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness,
  nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A. thousand shall fall at
  thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh
  thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the
  wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most
  High, thy habitation. There shall no evil befall they neither shall any
  plague come nigh thy dwelling</i>'...</p>

  <p class="first">from that moment I resolved that I would stay in the town
  and, casting myself entirely upon the goodness and protection of the
  Almighty, would not seek any other shelter whatever. And that, as my times
  were in His hands, He was as able to keep me in a time of infection as in a
  time of health, and if He did not think fit to deliver me, still I was in His
  hands and it was meet He should do with me as seemed good to Him."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch0"
     name="ch0"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE are so many different kinds of historical stories and
  this author has tried most of them, so it is as well to make clear what has
  been attempted in this novel. The shell of the tale is true and concerns an
  incident fairly well known, though perhaps better known a hundred years ago
  than it is to-day. It has served to illustrate many moral poems and
  anecdotes, which are now as forgotten as the morality they expressed.</p>

  <p>But the details of this episode of country life in the reign of Charles II
  are sparse and rest largely on legend and conjecture. The characters, too,
  are shadowy, mere names and labels, most of them.</p>

  <p>None of this matters beside the spiritual truth that emerges; in that
  remote Derbyshire village nearly three hundred years ago, a man did try to
  serve his God to the best of his belief and at a terrible cost to himself and
  others. This action was such as to make him a hero in the eyes of the
  single-minded, a fool in the opinion of those who have the knowledge he could
  not have possessed.</p>

  <p>He believed that he was following divine instructions. From a worldly
  point of view he was doing things as foolish as they were brave.</p>

  <p>Here is good matter for study, a moving, inspiring subject; can there be a
  more important one than a man's sincere dealings with his God?</p>

  <p>The background and the details have been given as much verisimilitude in
  time and place as the writer could achieve; such history as is introduced
  would pass muster in the school books, it is hoped. But the main theme is the
  spiritual adventure of the young man who was convinced he knew the will of
  God. Some readers may detect echoes of Henry Vaughan in the story; such
  verses as are quoted are his, as are the very beautiful lines above. The
  writer felt that Vaughan was the perfect expression in poetry of the spirit
  that moved the hero of this tale, and the poet was but a few years earlier in
  date than the priest, so that they share the same contemporary colouring. The
  letters given in this book are from originals supposed to be genuine, but
  unfortunately stilted and affected as well as dubious. The writer has
  ventured to recast them into a more sympathetic and fluid form.</p>

  <p>The medical details, in this case so important, are given on medical
  authority; the principal book consulted being that by Dr. Charles Creighton:
  <i>Epidemics in Britain</i>. The rest of the material had to be gathered from
  old guide-books, magazines, and memoirs long since out of print.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; ST. HELEN'S WAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">"IF they do not know, do not inform them, but it seems
  incredible that they are in ignorance."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I dare assure you that it is so&mdash;these people live as isolated
  an existence as if they resided in Muscovy."</p>

  <p>"You speak in pity, Mr. Mompesson? You think them, perhaps, savages?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, that they are rude, wild and unlettered, there can be no doubt."</p>

  <p>"They have immortal souls, Mr. Mompesson."</p>

  <p>"I should have said that, my Lord," replied the young clergyman with a
  look and an accent steady and quick.</p>

  <p>"No, it was I who was impertinent to remind you. See, your son's craft has
  capsized and you must make him another&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;out of the pages of my sermons, my Lord."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson took a packet of manuscript from his pocket and deftly
  fashioned, by folding the paper, a little ship; the two men stood by the
  banks of a stream that eddied swiftly down a gradual hill, the clear water
  impeded here and there by glistening stones. Limestone rocks, thickly grown
  with fine ferns and glossy ivy rose on either side of the dell that was
  surrounded by trees that almost shut out the distant mountains that rose
  purple and cloud-veiled behind them.</p>

  <p>A child of four years of age sat on the edge of the stream and watched his
  father fashion his new toy; the first paper ship, water-logged, had foundered
  in the current.</p>

  <p>"I irk you, sir, with my childish occupations," said the young clergyman.
  "Your Lordship will think that Eyam has gotten an idle pastor."</p>

  <p>The Earl regarded the speaker shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"I am your friend," he replied quietly, and watched the launching of the
  paper boat, on which, in a fine careful hand, the words 'Thou hast made the
  desert blossom as the rose' were clearly visible.</p>

  <p>The July day was warm, the hill air sweet with the pure scent of the wild
  thyme and mint, which showed their blue and purple flowers by the banks of
  the stream; a soft wind stirred the upper boughs of the crest of trees that
  overhung the dale; the two men and the child, as if entranced by the summer
  languor, watched the paper boat taken slowly, with a gallant dignity, down
  the current.</p>

  <p>The Earl, who was the elder by twenty years or more, was a man still in
  the prime of life, but marked by fatigue, hardship and anxiety. He had known
  war, exile and poverty; but four years ago he had been living in miserable
  penury abroad; now he was restored to something more than his ancestral
  honours and he had been recently appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Derby. With
  little taste for Court life, the Earl of Devon resided during most of the
  year at Chatsworth, the antique and noble building that stood amid the
  dignity of the wide park through which this stream flowed; the Earl was a
  quiet, careful man, of whom little was known, so earnest had he been to avoid
  disputes or strivings with his fellows; his attire was plain, he wore his
  graying hair cut to the shoulders and might have been his own steward as he
  stood thoughtful among the knee-high flowers and grasses.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson, on the other hand, looked above his station; his gray
  cloth was of the finest make, his bands of delicate lawn, his whole air full
  of elegance and grace; moreover, he was brilliantly handsome, his patrician
  and slightly aquiline features shaded by thick auburn curls. Had not his
  bearing been grave and slightly aloof, he would have appeared no more than
  what he had hitherto been, chaplain in the household of a great
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Why did you enter the Church, Mr. Mompesson?" asked the Earl
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>The dell was full of echoes, and the question, asked in a slightly raised
  voice, was repeated in hollow tones: "&mdash;the Church, Mr. Mompesson?"</p>

  <p>"You hear the echoes?" smiled the young clergyman. "How am I to answer so
  many at once? Surely I did not enter it for preferment&mdash;since I am sent
  into the wilderness."</p>

  <p>"That was my thought," said the Earl bluntly. "I should have thought, with
  your gifts and scholarship, family and friends, you might have hoped for a
  better cure than Eyam."</p>

  <p>"Sir, it was in my patron's gift, he offered it and I took it."</p>

  <p>The Earl was not sure whether Mr. Mompesson spoke lightly or in
  rebuke.</p>

  <p>"And your wife, does she take kindly to this rural life?"</p>

  <p>"Kate is, as I think, happy."</p>

  <p>"Do not then, disturb her, with talk of what is happening in London. She
  has no friends there?"</p>

  <p>"None, my Lord. Her family were at Cockpen, Durham, and her parents are
  dead. An uncle in York City is all she has."</p>

  <p>"There is no chance that she should write to London or receive a letter
  from there?"</p>

  <p>"None, my Lord, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Nor her sister?"</p>

  <p>"Bessie still less than Kate has any acquaintance at London. Have no fear,
  my Lord. I shall neither send nor receive anything for a time. Indeed, since
  I came to the North, I have lost my friends there."</p>

  <p>"Very well. And no doubt it is fantastic that a mere letter, save that it
  came from an infected house... But our wise men can tell us very little of
  these matters."</p>

  <p>"I have studied them. I thought once to be a physician," said Mr.
  Mompesson unexpectedly. "It is still a foggy science. But for infection, I
  would not trust a scrap of rag&mdash;came it never so many miles."</p>

  <p>"Some hold that opinion." The Earl wished to probe into the character and
  attainments of this attractive man who deeply interested him. "I did not
  know, Mr. Mompesson, that you followed this modern fashion of chemical
  experiments and medicine."</p>

  <p>"I have done very little, I assure you, sir."</p>

  <p>"I rather held you to be a scholar. Sir George Savile told me you were
  translating Plautus."</p>

  <p>"Again," smiled the young clergyman, "I must say&mdash;I have done very
  little."</p>

  <p>"You are, sir, over-diffident. I take my leave. Let me welcome you at my
  house soon. You are lucky, sir, to have your son beside you. Mine is at sea
  and even now engaged, maybe, with the Dutch."</p>

  <p>"I will pray for him, my Lord." Mr. Mompesson bade the little boy rise and
  salute the Earl, and then stood thoughtful when the boy had gone back to his
  play, regarding the thick-set figure of the elder man as he walked quickly
  down the winding path that led to Chatsworth.</p>

  <p>In such company the young clergyman was at home; he came from an old
  Nottingham family of Norman extraction and had received a liberal education.
  When he had left Peterhouse College, he had obtained, through influence, the
  post of chaplain to Sir George Savile at Rufford Park and had attended him
  there or at Thornhill, Yorkshire, and had lived a life of elegance, ease and
  refinement such as best suited his temperament. His content had been
  completed by his early marriage to a docile and fair young gentlewoman,
  Catherine Carr of Cockpen, Durham, who had given him two fine children.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson had sometimes accompanied his patron to London and thus
  had seen something of vice, movement, and novelty of the times, and how men
  strove both for good and bad, and women clung to their coat skirts impeding
  them with clamour, or put a staff into their hands and helped them along with
  noble words.</p>

  <p>He remembered little of the Rebellion; he had been a child when the late
  king was beheaded, but he could recall the hurry, the anxiety, the dread of
  civil war; the sour clash of opinion on how God was to be served and
  understood. He recalled, too, the universal joy when the present Charles had
  returned to his own, and how the prospects for a young royalist student at
  Cambridge had brightened, and how soon afterwards he had come by his early
  living, because he was a gentleman bearing arms, well-bred and comely.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson much admired Sir George Savile, who was brilliant, witty and
  wise, and who had taught him to despise the tricks and superstitions of
  mankind and to disdain the grossness of the self-seekers, the panders,
  jobbers and wittols who cluttered up all approaches to authority. Sir George
  had drawn his young chaplain's attention to the delights of Attic philosophy,
  the exquisite pleasures of music, classical learning, chess and
  horsemanship.</p>

  <p>There were those who said that Sir George was too much of a philosopher to
  be a good Christian, there were those who taxed him to his face with being an
  utter disbeliever, but for them he always had the same reply: 'None but a
  fool is an atheist,' and reminded them of the Holy Bible, where the saying is
  written: 'The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.'</p>

  <p>"Come home, George," said Mr. Mompesson, rousing himself from his reverie
  and observing that the Earl was now out of sight. "We spend too much time
  idling, you and I."</p>

  <p>The child raised his head and marked with delight the echo that, absorbed
  in his sport, he had not before observed.</p>

  <p>"Sir, we stay," he protested; and cupping his fat hands round his mouth,
  gave stammering cries to the echoes of the glen.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson readily lingered in this sweet solitude that had that
  elegant luxury (to his mind) to which he was too well used; the dell was as
  fine as the great music-room at Rufford Park. Only when he came upon the
  dwellings of his rude flock was the young clergyman offended. He did not wish
  to return to his own house, the meanness of which vexed him. Kate and Bessie
  were, moreover, distracted with the feminine business attendant on the
  approaching wedding and he had no part in that, nor was he much at ease about
  that marriage.</p>

  <p>While his child shouted through the trumpet of his hands, William
  Mompesson's thoughts returned with pleasure to his old life at Rufford Park
  and with vexation to his magnificent patron, Sir George Savile. Why had that
  great gentleman so encouraged and flattered him, laying him, as it were, on
  silk and feeding him with honey for five years, only at last to say: 'Why,
  Mr. Mompesson, here is the living of Eyam vacant by the death of Sherland
  Adams, who was a quarrelsome rogue. And it is yours.'</p>

  <p>It would have been to many men a sentence of banishment, for the mountain
  village was remote and wild, and the people had been much neglected by their
  late pastor, who, after being suspended by Cromwell, had returned to his
  charge, a bitter, broken man. But at first William Mompesson had been glad to
  leave his golden servitude, for he had been discontented with his fastidious
  sheltered life and eager to exercise his energy and his gifts.</p>

  <p>He smiled now as he thought of that flash of enthusiasm. There were no
  opportunities in Eyam for a man like himself. Though this was the country
  where his family had lived since the Norman Conquest, he had no knowledge of
  these hills, this rural life, these people, rude, superstitious, coarse and
  troublesome, who neither had, nor wished to have, any connection with the
  outer world. People who had hardly heard of London, whose imaginations went
  no further than Bakewell, and to whom the Earl of Devonshire in Chatsworth
  was more important than the King.</p>

  <p>'What can I get into their thick heads?' he thought. 'What use is
  learning, or love of God, or holiness, or wit and enthusiasm here?'</p>

  <p>He frowned slightly as he pondered over the part that Sir George had taken
  in this; had that subtle man thought that his young chaplain was becoming
  effeminate and pampered? Had he, with that sparkle of delicate malice which
  sometimes lit his urbane detachment, decided to put William Mompesson to the
  proof?</p>

  <p>'Perhaps he was tired of me; perhaps he recalled that I was his dependent
  and might be dismissed. And took this way of doing so, courteously.'</p>

  <p>The young man's sensitive mind was galled, not only because he detected a
  hidden rebuke in this banishment to this desolate post, but because he
  detected failure in himself. He had always believed that he was sincerely
  religious and that he longed to prove it. Now he knew that he regretted
  Rufford Park and Thornhill and was depressed&mdash;even disgusted&mdash;by
  Eyam.</p>

  <p>His chance meeting with the Earl of Devonshire to whom Sir George had
  warmly recommended him, had stabbed him with regret for the old days when he
  had enjoyed as of right the company of such men and the luxuries with which
  they surrounded themselves. True, my Lord had been gracious, but William
  Mompesson knew that an occasional visit to the great man's establishment
  would not assuage his longing for the life that he had left.</p>

  <p>Other considerations crossed his mind; he was a poor man. His parents,
  both dead, had been ruined by the civil war and what they had left him had
  been almost exhausted by the expenses of his education. He had not above
  forty pounds a year, nor was his wife in better case; the late troubles had
  left her orphaned and sucked up her family's substance, and she had no near
  relative beyond Mr. John Beilby, a gentleman possessing a small estate
  outside York.</p>

  <p>And there was little George to educate&mdash;'he must go to
  Cambridge'&mdash;and little Bessie to portion&mdash;'she must marry a
  gentleman.' So, on these grounds alone, the young man was well advised to
  accept the rectorship of Eyam and the stipend of one penny per
  lot&mdash;every thirteenth dish&mdash;of ore obtained from the lead mines
  that, together with the manor of Eyam, had come to Sir George Savile from his
  great-aunt, the Countess of Pembroke. Nor was this tithe mean; the income
  varied from three hundred to nearly five hundred pounds a year and more than
  sufficed for any possible expenditure that could be made in this place.</p>

  <p>"It will provide for you, your wife and children," Sir George had said,
  and William Mompesson resented the money that was the base lure to hold him
  in this wilderness.</p>

  <p>'Am I to die here?' he thought, with a touch of wildness and glanced round
  at the sloping banks of the little glen, at the crest of trees and at the
  mountains beyond as if he surveyed prison walls.</p>

  <p>He had heard how, in the old days, one parson would stay all his life in
  one parish&mdash;how many years?&mdash;he had lived but twenty-six himself,
  forty more would scarcely see his span out.</p>

  <p>Surely the Earl had looked at him shrewdly, wondering what a man of his
  parts was doing here. Why had he not become a scholar attached to his beloved
  University, a soldier with the world before him, a curious experimenter in
  medicine and chemistry? There were livelihoods to be obtained through any of
  these vocations.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson knew why he had taken Holy Orders. It was because he had
  felt a searing enthusiasm for God.</p>

  <p>He knew also why he had accepted the chaplaincy with Sir George Savile. It
  was because he had been tempted by the insidious, not ignoble, bribes offered
  by life in a magnificent household where intelligence, taste, fondness for
  beauty, ease, wit and refinement were gratified to the full.</p>

  <p>As he now pondered over his case, he realized as he had never realized
  before, how that early, sweet and delicate love of God had dwindled and been
  almost smothered during the five years he had spent in attendance on this
  splendid and dangerous patron.</p>

  <p>'Did I love God, this post would not be hard. Do I not, then, love Him? Am
  I a hypocrite?'</p>

  <p>He looked down at his little son; the child, suddenly tired, had fallen
  asleep on the crushed beds of mint and parsley; an unspeakable tenderness
  touched Mr. Mompesson; he stooped and gathered the warm, drowsy face, the
  soft, dimpled and relaxed limbs to his bosom. Here was flattering, ready
  love; here was affection easy to understand.</p>

  <p>The boy awoke and cried out after his boats; but one was sunk and the
  other gone far down the stream.</p>

  <p>"Will you hear the voice, George?" asked Mr. Mompesson: making a trumpet
  of his hands he called: "Love God," and the rocks gave back the
  echo&mdash;"'Love God.'"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE young clergyman's mind was distracted with petty worries
  that he despised and yet that he could by no means overcome. These clangours
  of worldly matters overlay his deeper preoccupation with his own soul and his
  private honour.</p>

  <p>He considered himself the guardian of his wife's young sister, Elizabeth,
  and he was not satisfied that she was making a good match with young John
  Corbyn; Mr. Mompesson was not pleased with the way his own wife delighted in
  the worldly aspect of this marriage, nor even with her attitude towards her
  new life. She had been in Eyam since April and more and more could he guess
  at the dissatisfaction behind her loyal but alarmed reserve.</p>

  <p>Kate had lived as softly as himself at Rufford Park and Thornhill, the
  friend of Lady Savile, admired, flattered&mdash;and now this&mdash;a country
  parson's wife in this wild place. It was no wonder Kate had welcomed with
  childish pleasure the excitement of her sister's wedding and had made far too
  much of the money and position of the Corbyns.</p>

  <p>'I must speak to Kate,' went constantly through Mr. Mompesson's mind,
  always followed by, 'but what can I say?'</p>

  <p>Then there was the problem of his flock, strange unruly people, secretive,
  hard to understand, alien to him in everything. Some of the miners in
  particular were almost savages in the estimation of the cultured scholar.
  There was one, Sythe Torre, who seemed beyond all discipline and who led his
  fellows in many disgraceful and indecent pranks; he mocked, almost openly, at
  the new pastor, though he seemed abashed before his fine wife. And Torre was
  but one of the odd and difficult characters now in the spiritual charge of
  Mr. Mompesson; there was Mother Sydall, whom all believed to be a witch, and
  the herb doctor and the astrologer at The Brass Head in Bakewell&mdash;'God
  help me,' thought Mr. Mompesson, 'but they are no better than pagans. And
  their rites and customs come from heathen times.'</p>

  <p>In his abstraction he stumbled over a stone&mdash;this snatched him out of
  his reverie and at the same moment he heard his name and saw a tall figure
  coming towards him up the glen.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mompesson, while you were meditating, your little one was falling
  into the stream." And the speaker put forward the child who, with wet skirt
  and rosy face, clung to his hand.</p>

  <p>The blood rushed into William Mompesson's cheeks; this man was one whom he
  disliked, and who was one of his griefs and troubles&mdash;Thomas Stanley,
  the dissenting minister who had been appointed to Eyam under the rule of
  Oliver Cromwell.</p>

  <p>"I thank you," he said stiffly, "I was forgetful." He took his son to his
  side. "The boy was chasing his paper boat, but it has gone."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," replied the Puritan, "his father chased as trivial a
  toy&mdash;or were your deep musings on holy matters?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, they were private. And your sour censures, whenever we meet, strain
  my patience."</p>

  <p>"If your patience never has more to bear than my poor rebukes, you are
  fortunate," replied Mr. Stanley steadily; he fell into step beside the young
  Rector&mdash;who foresaw, with vexation, that he would be forced to listen to
  another tedious discourse from the man whom he so heartily disliked.</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley was about fifty years of age, healthy and robust, with a
  deep chest and the slightly bowed legs of a constant horseman; he had been a
  chaplain to the Parliamentary troops and ridden with them in many campaigns;
  he was the son of a saddler of Chesterfield and had nothing of what Mr.
  Mompesson looked for in a gentleman. His coarse, thick grey hair was
  close-cropped, his blunt, not ill-shaped, features were empurpled and
  thickened from continuous exposure to the weather; an ugly scar puckered one
  cheek; his hands were like those of a labourer, and his clumsy homespun black
  garments were worn and faded, while his stout leather boots were patched and
  roughly laced with hide thongs over his rudely knit stockings.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson could have endured these offences, but he could not tolerate
  this ignorant fellow's assumption of a sacred office, his defiance of the
  Church of England and his indifference to breeding and scholarship&mdash;and
  his persistent interference in the parish from which he had been ejected on
  St. Bartholomew's Day, five years before.</p>

  <p>The new Rector was also galled by the fact that Thomas Stanley had been
  revered and obeyed in Eyam and that the respectability of his character was
  in notable contrast with that of Sherland Adams, the man whom he had replaced
  and who, after the Restoration, had replaced him. Mr. Mompesson was bitterly
  aware that the Nonconformist still visited several of his former parishioners
  and, for all he, the Rector, knew, held services on the hill-side on the
  moors.</p>

  <p>As they reached the mouth of the glen where it widened into the heath, the
  road and the village, Mr. Mompesson saw Ann, the maidservant, coming towards
  them, her grey gown and white apron cool in the sunshine; the child was late
  and his mother had sent for him; 'careless Kate,' her husband thought
  tenderly, 'was never careless where the children were concerned.'</p>

  <p>He bade the boy run ahead, and when he had seen the woman take charge of
  him he turned to the sternly disapproving figure at his side.</p>

  <p>"Sir, this is not the first time that you have forced your company on me.
  Let us come to an issue, so that, hereafter, we may leave one another in
  peace."</p>

  <p>"Those are peevish words," replied the Puritan, his deep, steady voice
  touched with scorn. "To what issue can we come?"</p>

  <p>"I bid you look to your ways." Mr. Mompesson flicked at some thistles with
  his light cane. "Sir, your interference in this parish will not be tolerated.
  I am very well with Sir George Savile, who is Lord of the Manor, and with my
  Lord at Chatsworth, who is Lord-Lieutenant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But art thou," interrupted Mr. Stanley, "very well with God?"</p>

  <p>"That is between a man and his conscience," retorted Mr. Mompesson
  curtly.</p>

  <p>"Examine well that conscience of thine," said Mr. Stanley. "For many years
  I held this post&mdash;not always abiding here, but going much among the rude
  and scattered peoples of the north. Tyranny expelled me and I was forced to
  watch that unworthy man, Sherland Adams, usurp my place&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sir, these complaints are familiar to me," interrupted Mr. Mompesson
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>The Puritan continued unheeding:</p>

  <p>"He cared for nothing but his tithes&mdash;what he might wring from the
  mines, and exasperated all with his litigation. You are no better, Mr.
  Mompesson, with your fopperies and your fine lady wife and the junketing at
  the Rectory."</p>

  <p>"I no longer heed these charges that you bring against me so
  continuously," replied Mr. Mompesson with warmth. "But since your railings
  are vexatious, you rude man, I must bid you begone from my parish, Eyam,
  Foolow, Eyam Woodland, Bretton, Hazelford, my boundaries, the brooks and the
  river that you know so well."</p>

  <p>"You bid me!" smiled the Puritan. "What are you or your patrons, or your
  boundaries, to me? I perform the will of God."</p>

  <p>And he would not be silenced, but ran over his charges against the new
  Rector, his worldly elegance, the refinements of his household, the Papist
  ornaments he had introduced into the church, the frivolity of his wife and
  sister-in-law, who thought nothing of the poor, but who kept themselves for
  such gentle families as there might be in this Hundred of the High Peak, such
  as the Corbyns and the Lysons&mdash;and what better than neglect and
  worldliness could be expected from one who had been a courtier to a great
  lord and who bowed before such a notable malignant as the Earl at Chatsworth?
  Courtesy at first kept Mr. Mompesson in his place, then an ironic amusement
  that such bold speech should come from one so. forlorn. For the dissenter was
  penniless and proscribed; Mr. Mompesson did not know how he contrived to
  live, though he shrewdly suspected that some of his former parishioners
  subscribed to support Stanley; and the Rector remembered, with some shame,
  that the fine stipend that he enjoyed had never been drawn by the dissenter.
  During the suspension of the manorial rights, the tithe on the product of the
  lead mines had been abandoned and Stanley had received, for labours that none
  doubted had been zealous and arduous, a mere pittance. But Mr. Mompesson put
  that out of his mind and said sternly:</p>

  <p>"I respect you for an honest man and I advise you for your own good. You
  have no business here. I know that you go still from house to house, helping
  the ignorant people with their business and their letter-writing, and under
  this colour praying with them."</p>

  <p>"I have not denied it."</p>

  <p>The Rector struck again at the thistles. "It is against the law. I think,
  too, that you dare to hold meetings&mdash;up in the hills or moors. It is
  known that last year you would not pay the steeple rate. Nor would you
  contribute to the Easter offering."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stanley replied quietly: "For the first, one shilling and fourpence
  was demanded, and for the second, five pence. And they took my horse, whose
  value was over five pounds."</p>

  <p>"For your field preachings, I might set the constable on you, yea, have
  the soldiers from Derby. You mind how those people called Quakers were
  dispersed last year?"</p>

  <p>"Yea, and dragged away by the legs, with their heads on the ground,"
  replied Mr. Stanley, "and taken before a Justice of the Peace, who sent them
  <i>mittimus</i> to Derby Gaol. There they were kept in a cell where they
  could not stand upright and their keeper struck them in the face when they
  prayed to God."</p>

  <p>"Such is the law against dissenters," said Mr. Mompesson firmly, "and I
  have been long-suffering." He turned towards the village, the warm wind
  lifting the auburn curls from his shoulders, a flush on the handsome face
  that provoked the Puritan's contempt. "But you, sir, must leave my flock
  alone. Mr. Sherland Adams was lamentably indifferent to spiritual matters.
  But I stand for the Church of England."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stanley dropped into his easy stride beside the young man and
  answered: "How deeply art thou mistaken! Both in thy menaces to me and thy
  confidence in thyself! I shall abate nothing of my ways because of thee. It
  maybe that thou shalt abate thine because of me. It maybe that God will speak
  to thee in this place, which is to thee so wild and savage. And then thou
  wilt leave thy easy living, thy music, ribbons, idols, dancings, perfumes and
  curlings."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson looked curiously over his shoulder at the speaker, "I am not
  the idler you think me, Mr. Stanley," he smiled, his vexation gone, for he
  felt that beneath a rude exterior this man was modest, humble and brave. "I
  have studied, worked and pondered."</p>

  <p>"I make nothing of thy learning, Mr. Mompesson, Master of Arts, as thou
  mayest be. Nor of thy ponderings. Take heed to these people in thy charge.
  Their souls will not be saved from the Pit by shows of images or lute
  playings or honey-sweet talk. Look to these wakes, sir, they begin shortly.
  See if you can control the wild, the wicked and the blasphemous in these days
  of festival and licence."</p>

  <p>"Could you, when you were Pastor here?" demanded Mr. Mompesson.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the Puritan simply. "But under Mr. Sherland Adams bad
  customs prevailed again; last year it was like a heathen rioting. And the
  Rector himself sat in an ale-house, <i>The Miners' Arms</i>, and drank and
  jested."</p>

  <p>At this talk of the coming merrymaking, known in Eyam as St. Helen's Wake,
  Mr. Mompesson's spirits sank; he did indeed feel unequal to the prospect
  offered by the outburst of profanity and licence, idleness and buffoonery,
  that he had been assured characterized this festival of harvest, which
  remained pagan in almost all its aspects; especially did he dislike this
  thought, because St. Helen's Wake coincided with Bessie's marriage, another
  matter before which he felt inadequate.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid," said Mr. Stanley, who had been observing him closely.
  "This charge is too heavy for you, Mr. Mompesson. For you have a
  conscience."</p>

  <p>The village on its pleasant valley was now before them, and the Puritan,
  giving the other no time to reply, abruptly turned and retraced his steps
  along the paths, purple with the flush of red heather, that wound towards the
  dell.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson looked back after his sturdy figure and almost envied him,
  for Thomas Stanley knew the peace of a single mind and a steadfast heart.
  Almost, not quite, for William Mompesson would not have cared to live, as the
  dissenter probably lived, in holes in the rocks, in barns, on charity.
  William Mompesson would not have cared to go roughly clad and to exist
  without all those pleasures that gilded life for him, nor without Kate and
  his two children.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE village of Eyam, which William Mompesson slowly
  approached on the late afternoon of this warm July day, lay in the south-east
  part of the Parish of that name and six miles from Bakewell. Two little
  townships, Foolow and Eyam Woodland, and two hamlets, Bretton and Hazelford,
  completed the Parish; the whole was confined in the Honour of Peverel of the
  Peak, and in the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry.</p>

  <p>The Rector faced a wide street, nearly a mile in length, as he approached
  the Rectory from the dale, built, who knew how long ago, on a tableland of
  limestone, sandstone and shale, which curved through the valley surrounded by
  the lofty hills of the Peak. The street, of uncommon width, was guarded at
  the eastern or Town end by the gate known as the lych-gate; this the
  villagers took it in turn to watch by at night, more out of regard for
  ancient custom than through fear of any possible danger. Beyond this gate,
  which stood open in the daytime, the street widened to the spacious green and
  Cross, then narrowed again to the Townhead, or western part.</p>

  <p>The village took a serpentine course and there branched from this long
  street, twisted lanes, the Causey or Causeway, the Dale and the Water Lane.
  In the centre rose the church, almost completely hidden at this season of the
  year by the foliage of some magnificent linden trees; above these boughs,
  amber-coloured from the sunlight, only the squat grey tower with the four
  finials was visible.</p>

  <p>The dwellings that lined the street were simple, one-storeyed cottages,
  some tiled, some thatched, some flush on the wide road, others with
  stone-walled gardens round them; some detached, in a square of ground, others
  in a row; such as had space possessed neat ranks of straw-covered beehives,
  and many had a little pasturage in the rear where a cow was kept.</p>

  <p>A capacious inn with a wide entrance for carriages stood on the green. The
  efforts of a journeyman painter had depicted a glossy and gigantic <i>Bull's
  Head</i> on the sign. Further on there were two ale-houses of modest
  pretensions, <i>The Foresters' Arms</i> and <i>The Miners' Arms</i>, while
  another inn, <i>The Townhead</i>, and two other alehouses, <i>The Rose and
  Crown</i> and <i>The Royal Oak</i>, furnished the western part of the
  village. To the open disgust of Mr. Stanley and the secret dismay of Mr.
  Mompesson, this village of less than three hundred houses and less than five
  hundred inhabitants had six ale-houses.</p>

  <p>Eyam was almost deserted as the Rector walked slowly along the main
  street, a few old folk and children, with sleeping dogs and yawning cats, sat
  at their doors, spinning, gossiping or dozing in the sun. The men divided
  their time between the lead mines situated in the rocks of the Peak and
  agriculture; most families were self-supporting with their cows, poultry,
  bees and hay. The mines were very old and paid better every year; a man did
  not need to work long hours there in order to earn a good income for a
  labourer or peasant. These mines, besides supporting the Church, paid a tithe
  to the Lord of the Manor, and the expenses of their own administration by a
  Barmaster, Steward and yearly court called the Barmoot. The mines themselves
  belonged to the Parish of Eyam by virtue of a Charter supposed to have been
  given by King John, which no one, however, had seen.</p>

  <p>A new mine, known as the Edgeside vein, had lately been discovered and
  found to be very rich in ore, and this promised fortune showed in the lively
  preparations being made this year for the St. Helen's Wake. Mr. Mompesson
  knew that this meant added riches for himself&mdash;some said that his
  stipend would be raised to something near a thousand pounds a year presently.
  Kate and Bessie had been very pleased at this talk, but he had felt uneasy.
  And he felt uneasy now again when he recalled the grim rebukes of Thomas
  Stanley.</p>

  <p>The villagers returned his graceful salutation kindly; if he had not much
  impressed them as a man of God like Mr. Stanley, they bore with him because
  he was a handsome, amiable young gentleman, who always spoke to them
  courteously and who did not much interfere with them.</p>

  <p>The Rectory stood back from the road, close to the church and in
  considerable grounds. Mr. Sherland Adams had let it fall into disrepair, and
  Mr. Stanley had turned it into a poor-house save for one room in which he
  lived, so Kate had burst into tears when she had first seen her new dwelling.
  But Sir George Savile had allowed repairs to be made and sent furniture from
  Rufford Park, while Kate and her sister had travelled as far as York to buy
  hangings and mirrors.</p>

  <p>Then the Rector had sent to Nottingham for such chattels of his own as his
  parents had left him and had been stored with a relative, and Kate's uncle,
  Mr. Beilby, had sent some gifts, so that now, four months after their arrival
  in Eyam, the Mompessons were set out in a state that rivalled that of the few
  gentle families in the district, the Corbyns, who were rebuilding the old
  Manor House, the Lysons of the Hall, near Middleton Dale, and a few others of
  the better sort, who resided near Eyam. Yet Mr. Mompesson was conscious of a
  return of that distaste of his new surroundings which he had not yet been
  able to overcome. Eyam was truly in the wilderness and the Rectory a mean
  place compared to Rufford Park; he was ashamed to find that he was
  calculating how soon the profits from the new lead mine might come, and if
  they would justify him in adding a wing to the house that had been so much
  too large and fine for Thomas Stanley.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE two women were in the large panelled room that looked on
  the rose garden and, through the gate in that, to the orchard where the
  beehives stood beneath the fruit trees; the sunshine was full on the group in
  front of the handsome mirror with the tortoise-shell frame and the bands of
  dark blue glass that had been a present from Lady Halifax.</p>

  <p>Catherine Mompesson was seated on a low stool and Elizabeth Carr on a
  cushion by her side; the young matron wore a gown of pale grey cloth with a
  falling lace collar and laid seams of green braid, she had sea-green ribbons
  in her hair, at her bosom and wrists; she was a slight, gay creature, with
  fine, bright brown ringlets and large hazel eyes, her features childishly
  small and pretty, her complexion too brilliant to need the velvet patch she
  had stuck by her delicate chin.</p>

  <p>Five years of marriage and the birth of two children had not sobered the
  Rector's wife into any gravity or heaviness of deportment; at twenty-four
  years of age, she seemed no older or more serious than the younger sister who
  sat beside her, wearing a gold coloured gown of a bird's-eye pattern and
  holding up to the dazzling light a sample of white satin.</p>

  <p>Bessie Carr was darker than Kate, an abundance of glossy, chestnut curls
  hung gracefully from her small head, and charm was given her insignificant
  features by her animation, sparkle and radiancy of her clear eyes and pure
  complexion. In the cushioned window seat slept the other Elizabeth, the
  Rector's little daughter, curled up in her muslins and silks, with the
  curtains drawn forward to shield her from the sun's bright rays.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson paused at the door and smiled tenderly at this peaceful
  scene. But he recalled the stinging rebukes of the dissenter and inwardly
  admitted that there was truth in them. The room was handsomely furnished;
  there were inlaid cabinets, a sideboard with silver flagons, portraits in
  gilt frames, damask hangings, chairs with velvet cushions, cups and platters,
  and the two young women in their expensive garments, with patterns of
  tinsels, satins, buckrams, braids and fringes scattered over their knees and
  on the floor beside them.</p>

  <p>"We are choosing the wedding clothes," smiled Catherine. "And yours, too,
  my dear&mdash;even if you must wear gown and bands, I'll see that they are of
  the finest quality." He had no heart for a rebuke, though he thought they
  made too much of this wedding and spent a good deal of time and thought on
  the preparations for it, rejoicing, besides, with too open a guileless
  pleasure, on the worldly advantages of the match.</p>

  <p>"Where do the patterns come from?" he asked, trying to show a courteous
  interest in their dainty task.</p>

  <p>"From Derby," said Kate. "Mr. Vickers got them for us; they came by the
  carrier this morning. Mr. Vickers is a clever tailor, for this outlandish
  place."</p>

  <p>"But is not your finery complete?" asked the Rector pleasantly; he took
  the place beside his tiny daughter in the window seat and looked with a deep
  affection at the sleeping infant.</p>

  <p>"Not complete," cried Elizabeth Carr, who was always ready to chatter.
  "Most of the dresses are made, but there are household furnishings and
  ornaments to attend to&mdash;you know that John says I am to have new goods
  in a new house..."</p>

  <p>"And there, Mompesson," put in Kate quickly, "is a chance for you to read
  us a homily, on a new heart too."</p>

  <p>"I cannot preach to you, Kate." Mr. Mompesson smiled a little sadly. "Save
  when you go to church and then, I think, you do not listen."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but I do, and think what a fine figure you make in the
  pulpit..."</p>

  <p>"Do not laugh, Kate, for I am like to make but a poor figure in Eyam.
  These people give no heed to me. To them I am not only a stranger, but almost
  a foreigner."</p>

  <p>The women spoke together.</p>

  <p>"They are so barbarous, so wild..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson hushed this pretty clamour. "They are given into my charge.
  And when this wedding is over, Kate, you must go among them more, and make
  friends with them, and help them."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Mrs. Mompesson gave her lord a mischievous glance. "I must, indeed!
  Why, I hardly understand what they say&mdash;and they stare at me as if I was
  a mummer at a fair..."</p>

  <p>"And I'm sure," added Bessie eagerly, "I don't know how you expect Kate to
  remain in this lonely place..."</p>

  <p>"Will not you live here?" asked the Rector. "What of the fine new Manor
  House, Bess?"</p>

  <p>"John has promised to take me to Derby and to Buxton. John will not be
  tied here, as you will be. We shall have a coach, we might even go to London.
  And we'll carry Kate with us, too, say what you will, dear sir."</p>

  <p>"Truly," put in Mrs. Mompesson eagerly. "I hope we do not stay here long,
  even now in the summer I feel shut in by these mountains&mdash;so far away
  from the rest of the world; and what must it be, for desolation, in the
  winter..."</p>

  <p>"We are not in Muscovy or Cathay," said the Rector gently, "but a few
  miles and you are in a fine town, Buxton or Sheffield..."</p>

  <p>"He protests against himself, dear," smiled Bessie to her sister. "He
  feels exiled here, too; how different his spirits are from what they were at
  Rufford Park! Is he not often apart in a melancholy?"</p>

  <p>"It is true," agreed Kate tenderly. "Where were you to-day? You had George
  abroad so long I sent Ann after you, and she found you where I knew you would
  be, in that solitary glen."</p>

  <p>The Rector was impressed by this picture that the two young women, with
  simple sincerity, gave him of himself. It was true that he had fallen into a
  pensive, inactive habit, had become slothful and languid, since he had been
  confronted with the difficulties of his new post. "I must amend my own ways,"
  he admitted, "the task I have weighs on me. I feel that it is one for a
  better man. One older and of more power. I should do more with these people,
  who have become very irreligious under Sherland Adams's idle ministry..." He
  did not add the thought that was in his mind&mdash;that there were many in
  his parish who were God-fearing, but that these were secretly followers of
  the Rev. Thomas Stanley and heeded him, William Mompesson, not at all.</p>

  <p>"Let it go," said Kate easily. "You do your duty and the people are
  content. I wonder only that Sir George sent you here. Pray, before the winter
  comes, beg him to send us to another living or take us again to Rufford
  Park."</p>

  <p>"Nay, my Kate, we have been cream fed, cushioned on silk, too long."</p>

  <p>The young women laughed and their delicate mockery roused him; he saw,
  with a sudden painful clarity, the whole pleasant scene as an enchanter's
  delusion. These two lovely girls, the beautiful infant, the handsome room,
  the prospect beyond, honey, roses, fruit, all the symbols of ease, of luxury,
  of rich idleness&mdash;what manner of man, of priest was he to be content
  with this?</p>

  <p>He rose and approached the laughing Bessie and the smiling Kate and said
  to them earnestly and with deep tenderness:</p>

  <p>"I am at fault. I should set you a better example. I conjure you, both of
  you, to give no cause for mockery. I am the Rector, Kate, and you are the
  Rector's wife. What was suitable for Rufford Park is not suitable here," he
  glanced at the boxes of patterns, the cuttings of braid and tinsel. "I will
  have this wedding plain, Bessie. You have no other guardian save your uncle,
  Mr. Beilby, and he is of my mind. All must be sober, even plain. Besides
  that, gauds are not fitting our station, we cannot afford them."</p>

  <p>"John is well enough for money," pouted Bessie, fingering a length of
  azure ribbon.</p>

  <p>"His father's settlements are not very generous, dear. And whatever he
  has, your provision does not come from him until you are his wife. I'll have
  no debts, Bessie. No useless expense. It is my charge to see your little
  fortune wisely bestowed."</p>

  <p>"How serious you are, Mompesson!" protested Kate. "Is this a time for
  homilies?"</p>

  <p>"Alas, if I speak lightly, you give no heed to what I say. I have observed
  much hustle and coming and going here..."</p>

  <p>Kate flushed; she had always been so affectionately dealt with by her
  husband that the least reproof from him wounded her keenly; lately she had,
  with the sensitiveness of a young, delicately nurtured woman, resented his
  absent-mindedness, his fits of melancholy, his long withdrawals to the
  solitudes of the mountains and the glens, as much as she had resented the
  uncouthness and isolation of Eyam. "I hope I know a woman's business best,"
  she said warmly. "Bess needs much stuff before she can set up housekeeping. I
  make what economies I can. But my sister cannot go like a beggar... "</p>

  <p>"She need not go, either, like a great gentlewoman," replied Mr.
  Mompesson. "Indeed, Kate, I want no pomp that is likely to set us above our
  rank and to rouse malice and unkindness among those to whom we should be an
  example of humility..."</p>

  <p>Kate bit her lip, silenced by this show of authority, but hurt and
  rebellious; Bessie hung her head and the Rector left the room conscious of
  having ill played his part, of an uneasiness and uncertainty in himself that
  ill fitted him to play the mentor to anyone.</p>

  <p>He had more serious grounds for concern than the charming, if exasperating
  frivolity of the two young women; his man, Jonathan Mortin, had met him on
  his return and told him that, during his absence, Sythe Torre had come to the
  Rectory, speaking of an urgent matter on which he wished to see the Rector.
  Urgent it must be, Mr. Mompesson reflected, for the miner to have left his
  work so early, and he shrank from any contact with this uncouth, almost
  savage fellow, who had so bad a character even among his coarse fellows. 'I
  suppose he comes a-begging,' and he told the servant that he would see Torre
  when he returned, as he had promised to return that evening. 'It is my plain
  duty,' he told himself; he had another, even more disagreeable. He must go to
  the Manor House and speak to John Corbyn on a matter that had come to his
  knowledge&mdash;a thing, perhaps, of no importance, and yet perhaps a thing
  of great moment.</p>

  <p>He did not like the Corbyns, a proud, hard family, he thought, which was
  not diffident about expressing a sense of condescension in marrying their
  heir to the Rector's portionless sister-in-law. The haughty parents, Mr.
  Mompesson knew, had been heard to say that the match would never have been
  made had not John Corbyn met Elizabeth at Rufford Park, where he had gone to
  pay his <i>devoirs</i> to the new Lord of the Manor. Only the kindness of the
  Saviles for the bride-to-be had made her acceptable to the Corbyns, and the
  appointment of William Mompesson to Eyam, which might have seemed so
  apposite, had rather irritated these local gentlefolk, who would rather have
  had Sir George's chaplain than the Rector of Eyam in the family.</p>

  <p>Of these feelings Mr. Mompesson was well aware, and they did not help to
  increase his liking for his new position. Nor did he feel altogether easy at
  trusting the happiness of little Bessie, which was so closely woven with the
  happiness of his Kate, to John Corbyn, for whom he had little respect. But
  outwardly it was a fine match and Bessie was deeply in love, so there was
  nothing for the Rector to do but to make the best of it, and he set out
  through the summer gold towards the Manor House, which stood a little beyond
  the village.</p>

  <p>The sun was declining and the miners were returning to work in their
  little fields and gardens before the evening meal; self-absorbed as he was,
  William Mompesson took no heed of these rude parishioners beyond a casual
  touch of his beaver; he was thinking, with compassionate love, of the two
  young women, whose pleasure he had perhaps spoiled by his rebukes. How
  pleased they would have been had they known that he had met the Earl, how
  eager to go to Chatsworth, that was even more splendid than Rufford Park.</p>

  <p>This reflection brought sharply to his mind what my Lord had said: 'If
  they do not know, do not tell them.'</p>

  <p>For a second Mr. Mompesson could not recall to what this referred; the
  matter was vague and, compared to the affairs that he had on his mind,
  unimportant. But it was as well for him to recall the Lord Lieutenant's
  warning, which was this&mdash;the plague that had been so frightful a scourge
  in the capital last year that the court had removed to Oxford had, after
  subsiding during the winter, returned, in some slight degree, to London.</p>

  <p>Well, he smiled to himself, they were as safe here as if they had been in
  Cathay, shut a hundred and fifty miles away in this mountain fastness; but if
  poor, sweet Bess really tried to induce her groom to take her to London, why,
  then, he must tell her of the Earl's warning; but his smile deepened as he
  reflected how over-cautious my Lord was in even mentioning this recurrence of
  the plague in London&mdash;why, if it had been in Derby even, there would
  have been no fear, so cut off from the rest of the world was this little
  community in the Peak.</p>

  <p>And it was with a pang near to regret that Mr. Mompesson recalled that
  neither he nor his wife had as much as an acquaintance in the capital, for
  he, when he had visited London with Sir George, had much admired the
  splendour and eager energy of the life that his patron and his friends led in
  Whitehall.</p>

  <p>The Manor House had long been leased by the Corbyn family, who farmed a
  large district and owned a lead mine in another part of the Peak; wealthy
  marriages had increased their importance considerably, and Catherine
  Mompesson was justified, from a worldly point of view, in rejoicing that her
  sister had made so good a match as young John Corbyn, only child of Ambrose
  Corbyn and heir to all his property.</p>

  <p>The Rector paused at the gate and looked at what was to be Bessie's house;
  the stone-masons were working on the new wing and the portion that was being
  rebuilt was covered with scaffolding poles. It would be some months before
  the work was completed and meanwhile the young couple were supposed to lodge
  in the Dower House, a small antique dwelling lower down the valley, so
  incommodious that it afforded Bessie a fair excuse to travel.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson passed through the gardens, now disturbed by the builders,
  and stood before the old Manor House south door; above this was a circular
  stone, on which was the crest of the Corbyns cut deeply. A raven on a wreath,
  perching under a vine, with the date 1560 cut beneath. As the Rector's hand
  went out to the iron bell-pull, he saw young John Corbyn coming towards him
  through the orchard at the side of the house, and he turned aside to meet
  him, coming up with him in the field known as the Manor Yard.</p>

  <p>The two young men exchanged greetings and spoke of the wake, for which the
  Corbyns made extensive preparations. They feasted and entertained their
  tenants and servants and this year this rejoicing was to be on a large scale,
  for on the last day of the wake John Corbyn was to marry Bessie Carr. This
  family had a peculiar connection with the festival, for they held their lease
  on the condition that they should keep a lamp perpetually burning before the
  altar of the patroness of the wakes, St. Helen, in the Parish Church.</p>

  <p>John Corbyn seemed surprised at this visit from the Rector and, when he
  had talked rather boastfully about the handsome show his family would make,
  he fell into a silence that was slightly awkward and left the conversation to
  the other man.</p>

  <p>Bessie's betrothed was a fine young man, tall and well shaped, with thick
  yellow hair cut square on his forehead, light grey eyes that easily assumed a
  sullen expression, and good features, slightly thick and coarse. His country
  clothes were expensive and not free from a hint of foppery in the bunches of
  ribbons on his shoulders and at his wrist.</p>

  <p>"I have to speak to you on a vexatious matter."</p>

  <p>John Corbyn at once became hostile; he had never made any disguise of his
  ill-concealed dislike to the Rector; he protested&mdash;what tiresome affair
  would be brought up now?</p>

  <p>"Your conduct in Bakewell," said Mr. Mompesson kindly. "Upon a hint I
  determined to make inquiries and found that your behaviour has been such as I
  must take notice of..."</p>

  <p>"You put an affront on me!" replied the young man, his sanguine face
  flushed darkly.</p>

  <p>"I am Bessie's guardian," said the Rector, who had expected this anger,
  "so pray check your wrath and way of thinking. You are not a month off your
  wedding and you sit in ale houses with mummer's wenches."</p>

  <p>"Who told you?" demanded John Corbyn, pausing in his walk and sticking his
  hands on his hips.</p>

  <p>"Those I did not heed. But I rode myself to Bakewell and saw you, three
  nights ago, though you did not see me, coming in your cups out of <i>The
  Talbot</i>, with a poor dancing woman on your arm."</p>

  <p>"I prepared some actors for the shows up here"; the young man made his
  excuses with ill will. "Do you expect me to be ever saying my prayers at
  home?"</p>

  <p>"Bessie loves you," said Mr. Mompesson. "If she knew this, all her world
  would fall into confusion."</p>

  <p>"Who is to tell her? Who is to make mischief over a little harmless
  merriment?"</p>

  <p>"Not I, John, not I. Harmless? I do believe it has no great harm, but ill
  manners breed mischief fast enough."</p>

  <p>"This is a time of licence," interrupted the young man shortly. "I am no
  profane fellow or a scoffer. But I tell you, sir, neither will I live as that
  snivelling Round-head would have us. I mean Thomas Stanley. This place is
  quiet for one of my parts. I mean to travel, to get some post with the Lord
  Lieutenant."</p>

  <p>"Jack, I have nothing against your ambitions; the Peak is quiet, too, for
  Bessie&mdash;nor would I be straitlaced. But these levities and
  debaucheries..."</p>

  <p>"When Bessie has me fast," put in John Corbyn, with a sudden smile, "let
  her hold me if she can&mdash;do you doubt that she can? I love her as she
  loves me. But no more of this preaching, sir. I had my belly full from the
  dissenter. I marvel that you allow him to lurk about the place. I cannot stir
  abroad but he is at my bridle, telling me of my foul life. As if a cup of ale
  and a wench on the knee were damnation."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson was offended, for he did not like to be compared to the
  ranting Puritan whom he disliked, nor to think that Thomas Stanley had taken
  on himself to rebuke one whose morals and behaviour were in the Rector's
  charge. John Corbyn saw his vexation and took advantage of it to say:</p>

  <p>"Why do you not set the constable on him? Nay, have the soldiers in from
  Derby, as they did for the Quakers..."</p>

  <p>"Some like the man and he does good, too," replied Mr. Mompesson. "He
  shall not be apprehended on my charge, but we digress..."</p>

  <p>"From the sermon that you would read me?" John Corbyn spoke with forced
  frankness. "Sir, I know it all and you must look upon me as a sensible,
  religious man, until you have proof that I am a rogue."</p>

  <p>"I did not say rogue..."</p>

  <p>"No, for you gave up your sword when you put on the gown and bands," said
  the young man with a wry smile, "therefore you go gently and I must respect
  you for a clergyman. But were we of a quality as we are of an age, I doubt
  not that we should come to high words." He turned aside and stared down into
  the fish-pond, where the big mullet came, gaping with blue-gey mouths, to the
  stone rim.</p>

  <p>'He dislikes me,' thought Mr. Mompesson, 'and it is my fault. I have not
  handled this carefully.' He was turning away, feeling self-rebuked and
  grieved, because there would never be, he thought, any real quarrel between
  Bessie's lord and himself, when the young man called after him in an
  unpleasant mocking fashion.</p>

  <p>"Ask Bessie herself what mischief she has on hand. Is she in debt for
  finery, does she gamble? She had five pounds from me, and won it from me with
  kisses. Is that your training, sir?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson was amazed; a sharp denial he checked with difficulty; he
  saw in the steady, angry grey eyes of John Corbyn that he spoke the
  truth&mdash;he remembered the boxes of patterns, the glistening fopperies
  that had of late been strewing the Rectory furniture. "Your money shall be
  returned to you, sir," he said quickly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I would take it?"</p>

  <p>"Since you have told me you gave it," replied Mr. Mompesson, with rising
  colour, "I am at liberty to believe that you would accept its return."</p>

  <p>"You had not heard unless you had angered me. I defy you to tell
  Bessie...?"</p>

  <p>"That you betrayed her?" interrupted the Rector bitterly. "You need not
  fear, sir. I value her peace of mind that rests on my faith in you." He
  checked himself, this would soon be a quarrel, a scandal, perhaps the ruin of
  poor Bessie's marriage; he turned away miserably through the thickening gold
  of the late afternoon and heard John Corbyn laugh behind him as he went.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE young Rector felt weary with that nervous, restless
  fatigue which comes from a dissatisfied mind and ill-adjusted labours; he had
  been quiet during supper and the young women had cheerfully rallied him on
  his humour. Now he sat alone in his little library or study, awaiting with
  distaste the arrival of the uncouth miner, Sythe Torre.</p>

  <p>'I am in the wrong place,' he thought gloomily. 'I am fitted for none of
  these things&mdash;neither to manage my own wife and her sister nor to
  control John Corbyn nor to overcome Thomas Stanley nor to understand and help
  my savage parishioners&mdash;what use can I be to this man Torre? A bold
  ruffian, what does he want of me? What am I? A fine gentleman? A recluse? Why
  am I thus cloudy and languishing?'</p>

  <p>He looked round the room still unfamiliar to him and mean, compared to the
  painted chamber he had enjoyed for nearly five years at Rufford Park, though
  Kate's care had done much to make it handsome. A tapestry that was the gift
  of Sir George Savile hung against the long wall opposite the window; worked
  in indigo blue and deep green worsted, it represented Moses raising the
  Brazen Serpent. In front of this was a fine Chinese cabinet on a gilt stand,
  and lining the short walls, save for the door, cases of books; Mr. Mompesson
  had a valuable collection of classical authors and some modern treatises; he
  himself had beeswaxed the shining tooled calf and sepia-inscribed vellum
  covers, and it gave him pleasure to see the purple, green, and scarlet silk
  ties hanging below the spines.</p>

  <p>Before the window, curtained in a saffron yellow damask, stood the
  writing-table where the Rector sat, and in the corner was a brass bracket
  clock, while either side of the window was a small portrait by a Dutch
  painter: one of Mr. Mompesson's father, painted on his visit to the Brownist
  Colony at Leyden, the other of his wife, a pale young woman holding an
  African pink.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson's desk was handsomely finished, the standish, hour-glass,
  and candlesticks were in silver, the Bible and Prayer Book were lavishly
  bound and mounted with the same gleaming metal.</p>

  <p>The reading-lamp, of sparkling crystal and silver-gilt, set close to his
  hand, was neatly trimmed; quills, packets of paper, tapers, sticks of wax and
  binding cords for packages, all lay in readiness for the Rector's sermons or
  his correspondence.</p>

  <p>His deep chair with arms was deeply cushioned with saffron velvet heavily
  fringed, and on the cloth that hung over the back were worked in Kate's fine
  stitching the Mompesson arms, <i>argent, a lion rampant, sable, charged on
  the shoulder with a mullet of the field</i>: with the curious crest of a
  bouget, or Crusader's desert water-carrier, with <i>a string assure,
  tasselled of the first</i>. Above, in uneven letters was the motto that Kate
  had found difficult to embroider: '<i>Mon juge est Dieu seulement</i>.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson had taken considerable pains to make the room that he had
  found bare and forbidding into some likeness of the luxurious chamber that he
  had occupied at Rufford Park. But though he had succeeded in impressing his
  parishioners&mdash;far more than he wished&mdash;with his gentility and his
  wealth, the apartment remained, to him, mean and even distasteful.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson tried to compose his thoughts; he was deeply vexed with
  himself that they should be so agitated. He had no reason to be disturbed or
  forlorn; he reminded himself of his bountiful blessings&mdash;his youth, his
  health, his easy life, his wife, and children, his opportunities for
  usefulness, the many pleasures he had, from his books, Seneca, Plautus,
  Lucian, to his beehives and his apple trees.</p>

  <p>But content cannot be hastily summoned, nor serenity be put on by making a
  resolution to be serene.</p>

  <p>The young Rector was deeply troubled; he could neither adjust his affairs
  with man nor, and this was the deeper grief, with God. He had from his early
  youth accepted Christianity as taught by the Church of England, he was
  absolutely loyal to the religious teachings that he had imbibed with such
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson, sensitive and conscientious, was not the man to enter
  the ministry for a piece of bread or to accept with grateful facility the
  mere symbols of a religion. As a Christian priest he knew that he must accept
  the tremendous fact of God, and God's holy Angels, and the Devil and his
  loathsome demons, and allow these to guide both his spiritual and his
  material life.</p>

  <p>He had the temperament of a mystic, but worldly matters had impinged upon
  his secret communings, which had in his youth approached ecstasy, with his
  Maker. Indolence, worldly ease, even doubt, had crept in like the little
  foxes that eat the vine. The elegant conversation of Sir George Savile, his
  wide intelligence, and gently mocking wisdom that were not, for all his
  protestations, wholly subservient to Christian doctrines, had done something
  to disturb his chaplain's faith.</p>

  <p>Then had come the sharp, poignant, bitter-sweet love of the flesh for
  Catherine and the joys of his union with her, the birth of his children, and
  his own studies in the classics, which had engaged him so deeply. He had felt
  blotted and corrupted by these sensual pleasures.</p>

  <p>All these things seemed to put clouds between him and God. The priest
  began to fear his own mind and his own power of reasoning; he dreaded to feel
  that through the intellect the Devil tempted men of his temperament. He
  feared his own easiness and indolence, which at times approached sloth; he
  winced before his own love and liking for the activities of his life. He knew
  that he should look upon all these as vain joy, vain grief, vain care, and
  have all his soul fixed on eternity.</p>

  <p>But this attitude of mind and soul was not easy to attain. William
  Mompesson feared, too, his own inner arrogance, which he could by no means
  subdue and which made him sense himself to be the superior of these rude,
  gross people, over whom he had been set, and that he was put apart from them.
  Indeed, when, as in this moment of solitude in his study, he looked into his
  own heart, he saw mirrored there nothing but fears, uncertainties, and
  doubts.</p>

  <p>There were specious arguments he might have employed, such as: 'Go thy
  way, thou hast done no wrong': 'Live pleasantly, dream deeply, and let all
  else slide': or 'Who has complained about thee? Thou art fortunate, a worthy
  man in a safe place.'</p>

  <p>Such fallacious comforts could not soothe him, nor could he derive
  contentment from dwelling on his felicity. He knew that his present
  discomforts in Eyam were but temporary, and with the aid of Sir George Savile
  and the Earl of Devonshire he might easily, say in a year or two, be sent to
  some other cure. He might contrive, even, to go to London and become chaplain
  again in a great house, where the lucky world's gorgeous mask and glittering
  store would be spread before him, his Kate, and his children.</p>

  <p>There he might have, for the asking or the intriguing, all the latest
  modes of pride and lust.</p>

  <p>Yet this hope did not allure him, though ambition stirred in him often
  enough. It was indeed as distasteful as the rude solitude of his mountain
  fastness. Every prospect that rose before him seemed equally abhorrent. He
  would not be here among this coarse peasantry whom he did not understand or
  like, he would not be amidst the temptations of the glitter of the great
  cities, he wished to resist the snare that came from the gilded idleness in a
  vain, glorious lord's mansion.</p>

  <p>What, then, did he want?&mdash;he would neither be recluse nor man of the
  world nor nobleman's servant nor plodding citizen nor industrious scholar.
  Something of all these qualities there was in his nature.</p>

  <p>But above them all was this desire to be at one with his God.</p>

  <p>He laid his hands out on the desk and looked at them, ashamed of their
  delicate make. Womanish hands they appeared in the yellow light of the
  carefully trimmed lamp, too fine for the uses of anything but indolence.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said out loud, "what is Thy will with me?"</p>

  <p>But these were words only, and he felt that they did not go upwards to the
  all-triumphant splendour, for he was vexed because of little
  troubles&mdash;the five pounds that Bessie had borrowed from John Corbyn,
  Kate's absorption in the approaching wedding festivities, the coming wake
  that would provoke a licence he would not be able to restrain.</p>

  <p>Then the problem of Thomas Stanley, a man whom he respected yet did not
  like, whom he was protecting, half-willingly, against the Law, whom perhaps
  he should deliver to the Law, for the man was a heretic, an outcast from and
  a derider of the Church.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson's troubled reverie approached anguish, and prayer broke from
  his lips that God would relieve the weight about his heart. And then, when
  the door opened slowly, he was startled at his own seriousness and wondered
  why this discord had brought him, for no good reason, to so low a state.</p>

  <p>It was Jonathan Mortin who entered, his confidential body servant, who had
  been with him at Rufford Park, and who had very willingly come to Eyam with
  his master, since that was near his native place, Bakewell.</p>

  <p>Jonathan Mortin was a well-trained, quiet man, who had effaced his own
  personality, as a servant in a great gentleman's house. Mr. Mompesson liked
  him without being familiar with him, and trusted him without having ever
  probed into his character.</p>

  <p>Ann Trickett, who was Kate's woman, and helped her with the children, had
  also come from Rufford Park, Buxton was her birthplace, but there were
  Tricketts in Eyam. It was not the least of William Mompesson's comforts that
  these two staid and faithful servants had followed him into the strange place
  and freed him from the necessity of employing the villagers, who to him were
  like foreigners, for anything save the roughest work.</p>

  <p>"It is Sythe Torre, sir," said Mortin; "he declares that you promised to
  see him."</p>

  <p>"It is true," said the Rector, collecting his idle shames swiftly. "Bid
  him come up."</p>

  <p>When the servant had withdrawn, the young man clenched his hands on the
  desk, and his eyes and brows narrowed into a frown of self-contempt.</p>

  <p>'Why do I dread to see this fellow? Why am I so unequal to this that is
  but a small part of my task?' He turned in his chair so that he faced the
  door, and putting out that fair right hand, the delicacy of which he had
  himself despised, on the silver-bound Bible, composed himself for the
  interview.</p>

  <p>He had not the least inkling of what this man would want of him, but he
  experienced an unpleasant sensation when the miner slowly and sullenly
  entered the library, for he remembered the bad character the man had, and he
  was oppressed by his physical stature.</p>

  <p>Sythe Torre was accounted in Eyam a giant; he was well over six feet and
  of enormous proportions. His massive sloping shoulders, short thick neck,
  small head with the flat back, were characteristics of strength that Mr.
  Mompesson had seen in antique statues. The Derbyshire miner, indeed, much
  resembled a bust in the possession of Sir George Savile, which purported to
  represent the Emperor Maximus. Here were the same blunt, brutal features, the
  compact dark curls, the heavy jaw outlined by a crisp beard, the deep-set
  eyes, and the retreating forehead.</p>

  <p>The miner was in the prime of life, Mr. Mompesson judged him to have no
  more than thirty years? His strength and industry earned him good money in
  the lead mines, but he was not very frequently occupied there, he preferred
  the upper air. Besides farming his own small piece of land on the outskirts
  of the village, he took long holidays from his toil when he travelled about
  the Peak district, wrestling, throwing the javelin, fighting with the
  quarter-staff, and exhibiting other feats of strength at local fairs.</p>

  <p>The Rector had heard ugly stories of the giant, who was reported to be
  cruel, ruthless, and blasphemous, but his crude stone dwelling, largely built
  with his own hands, sheltered a silent wife and sickly son, to whom he was
  reported to be obstinately attached.</p>

  <p>Without speaking and taking no notice of the Rector's suggestion to him
  that he sat, the giant stood, glancing with his small sly eyes around the
  room, noticing the tapestry, the furniture, the books, with childish
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>He had made, Mr. Mompesson noted, some attempts to compose his dress for
  this interview. His coarse and soiled shirt was caught together with a ribbon
  at the neck, his grey-green coat had been brushed and a pair of clean white
  woollen stockings drawn up over his worn, patched breeches.</p>

  <p>The Rector controlled his impatience and waited for this strange member of
  his strange flock to speak. He wondered if the fellow had come to ask for
  work, perhaps he was unemployed as a result of some quarrel at the
  mines&mdash;but when Sythe Torre spoke, he showed at once that he had come on
  spiritual matters.</p>

  <p>Looking at the Rector and thrusting his thick finger into the coarse
  ribbon at his neck, he said:</p>

  <p>"Would a murderer be damned, sir, save he make repentance?"</p>

  <p>This was no problem to the Rector, who answered directly:</p>

  <p>"Every sinner would be damned unless he made repentance, unless he
  believed."</p>

  <p>"Ay," said Sythe Torre, with a deep sigh, "ay. That's what Mr. Thomas
  Stanley told me, and he's a holy man."</p>

  <p>"Do you go to him?" asked Mr. Mompesson quietly. "Are you in his charge?
  Do you term yourself a dissenter?"</p>

  <p>The giant shifted uneasily from foot to foot; he appeared awkward,
  bewildered, and yet desperately earnest about some vital matter, his dialect
  was thick and offensive to the ear of the gentleman who listened to him so
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"I don't know these fine terms, sir," he said sullenly. "I come to you
  about a plain matter. Mr. Stanley's a man of God, too, isn't he? Well, I
  asked him. He said&mdash;damned and lost, burned for ever."</p>

  <p>"No one can tell you otherwise," replied Mr. Mompesson sternly. "None but
  a madman would think it possible to sin and escape punishment. What is this
  talk of murder? How does it concern you, Sythe Torre?"</p>

  <p>"That's not my business to be telling you, nor your business to ask, sir,"
  replied the man, servile and yet hostile too. "I thought it was a point you
  could make clear to me."</p>

  <p>"I have made it clear to you," replied the Rector. "I could enlighten you
  on other matters, would you come to church. I do not think I have seen you
  there since my ministry began. I hear you indulge a black self-will, that
  your lusts disorder into crime."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand the church," replied Sythe Torre, looking on the
  ground. "I don't understand half the things you say. Mr. Stanley told
  me..."</p>

  <p>"When you speak to me," replied Mr. Mompesson coolly, "you must leave Mr.
  Stanley out of your speech. He is a dissenting minister. If he preaches or
  tries to instruct any of you, it is against the law. He might be laid in
  Derby gaol for that."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, so he said," replied the giant, unmoved. "But I wanted to come to
  the matter of the murder, sir. There was one man that murdered another, and
  it was not discovered. And he didn't repent. Is his soul damned?"</p>

  <p>"To all Eternity," replied Mr. Mompesson. "Poor man! Have not these awful
  truths been impressed upon you yet?"</p>

  <p>"Who's to tell me they be truths?" asked the huge fellow obstinately.
  "That's what you say and that's what Mr. Stanley said, and I went to <i>The
  Brass Head</i> in Bakewell..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson interrupted sternly.</p>

  <p>"You must not come here to talk such blasphemous nonsense! These
  astrologers and witches are but quacks and charlatans, telling lies and
  performing tricks for money. There is no shorter cut to Heaven than by
  repentance."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay," replied the giant unexpectedly, "but, sir," and his small eyes
  were earnest, "the magician told me, too, that there'd be a judgment for it,
  and maybe not only on the murder, but on the place where he lived. He said
  that God sent judgment like thunder and lightning and earthquake."</p>

  <p>"There was Sodom and Gomorrah," replied Mr. Mompesson with a slight smile,
  "but these are deep matters to argue with you. If you know one who has a
  crime upon his conscience, bid him confess, give up his body to the law and
  his soul to the Church so that he may be saved from eternal damnation."</p>

  <p>Sythe Torre stroked his small beard with his coarse hand and looked
  doubtfully on the ground.</p>

  <p>"The murder might have been in a fight, and the one that killed the other
  might have had the right of it," he argued, "and it might have happened down
  the lead mines when no one was looking or prying."</p>

  <p>"I will not hear these tales save you give them to me as a sincere
  confession. I suppose you speak of your own case, Sythe Torre?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay," protested the giant quickly, "I talk of a friend."</p>

  <p>"Be that as it may," said the Rector, rising, "I cannot hear these
  half-confessions nor pass judgment upon problematical cases. Learn, poor
  wretch, that sin must be punished in this world and in the next, and that the
  Lord will send judgment on those who offend Him."</p>

  <p>"Til think on it," muttered the miner, shuffling uneasily towards the
  door, pulling again at the ribbon that bound his dirty shirt at the neck.
  "But there's many who'd rather risk damnation in the next world than be
  hanged in this. Who knows," he added, with a simplicity that robbed his words
  of offence, "if God really tells you and Mr. Stanley how things be? There's
  none comes back either from Heaven or Hell to tell us what the places be
  like. There's ghosts and spirits enough, but what do they do but gibber
  nonsense?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot help you," replied the Rector, "until you speak to me more
  frankly. I entreat you to come to church, I entreat you to suffer me to give
  you some instruction."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather go to Mr. Stanley for that," replied the giant. "He's a brave
  man and means what he says." The Rector flushed slightly; these sincere words
  seemed a reflection upon his own courage and his own good faith.</p>

  <p>"I warned you about Mr. Stanley," he said swiftly. "If your mind is
  burdened either by your own secret or by that of another person, I can only
  entreat you to relieve it by a full confession."</p>

  <p>"That's as may be," said the giant, with his hand on the door. Then
  looking up quickly, he added: "There's something you should know about young
  Esquire John Corbyn."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing I should know of Mr. Corbyn from you, Sythe Torre,"
  replied the Rector haughtily, "he is about to marry my sister-in-law."</p>

  <p>"For that reason I should tell you, sir," said the miner confidentially,
  thrusting his thick neck forward and speaking in a hoarse whisper. Before Mr.
  Mompesson could stay him he added quickly:</p>

  <p>"The young master was drunk down at Bakewell, at The <i>Derbyshire
  Arms</i>, and all the miners was about him and I was there. So was the
  mummers coming up to St. Helen's Wake. They'd got a wrestler with them and I
  tried a fall with him..."</p>

  <p>"Sythe Torre," put in the Rector, "this has naught to do with me."</p>

  <p>"But it has! Esquire Corbyn had one of them wenches&mdash;Nell, they
  called her&mdash;on his knee, and after all had been boosing together a
  little, she suggested he should marry her. And he had another glass or two
  and said 'yes.' And then the Common Prayer Book was brought out, and one of
  us took on a sad air and read the whole ceremony. And they said their parts,
  like a couple do in church. And so it was done, sir. And the young Esquire
  was roaring drunk."</p>

  <p>"You saw this yourself, Sythe Torre?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, or I'd not have spoken of it. Your lady has been kind to my
  poor wife," he added sheepishly. "It's a long while since we saw a fine lady
  here."</p>

  <p>The Rector again interrupted.</p>

  <p>"It was a jest, the jest of a drunken man," he said. "You must forget
  it."</p>

  <p>"No one will forget it," replied the giant, with his disarming air of
  simplicity, "for many thought that the young master would have done in
  earnest what did in jest. He kept the wench with him all night&mdash;his
  wedding night, he called it&mdash;and we made a music beneath the windows. I
  wonder you have not heard of this, sir," he added, looking
  half-apprehensively at Mr. Mompesson.</p>

  <p>"Something I heard, but not this. If you have, as you say, some respect
  for my wife and her sister, Sythe Torre, you will not repeat this tale in
  Eyam."</p>

  <p>"I'll only tell it to you," replied Torre, "but there's many saw it
  besides myself."</p>

  <p>"But it was not this," said Mr. Mompesson, with an effort, "that you came
  to see me about, but some trouble of your own."</p>

  <p>"No more of that, now," replied the giant, opening the door and clumsily
  taking his leave. "I'll let you know, sir, when I have more to tell you on
  that matter."</p>

  <p>When he found himself alone again, Mr. Mompesson went to the window,
  pulled the curtains sharply aside and flung wide the casement. He felt
  unnerved, slightly confused with anger, and was glad of the cool, fresh
  mountain air upon his face. The halting, incoherent talk of Sythe Torre's own
  troubles the Rector had completely forgotten; he did not recall the look of
  questioning agony in the man's small brutal eyes, as he had appealed to him
  for his ghostly advice on such terrible matters as crime and punishment,
  death and damnation.</p>

  <p>No, William Mompesson was thinking of the insult that had been put upon
  Kate's sister, thinking of the foul behaviour of John Corbyn, of the
  obscenity of the marriage with the mummer's wench, of what must have taken
  place in that inn parlour with the loose women and the swilling peasants, and
  Betty's Jack reeling in the midst of these vagabonds and pimps with their
  bawdy tricks.</p>

  <p>It did not occur to him to doubt the tale, because it coincided so exactly
  with other reports he had heard of young Corbyn's riotous behaviour.</p>

  <p>This was no husband for Betty. Yet Mr. Mompesson knew, even as that
  thought came to his mind, that he would never be able to break the match off
  now. The girl's heart was deeply engaged. Kate would support her, too. She
  would say, if he were able to tell this story to her, that it was only a
  jest, a young man's drunken frolic, something that no one would think very
  much of a few days after it had happened.</p>

  <p>And Mr. Mompesson knew that that view would be the one taken by most
  people. If he were to appeal to the Earl, to Sir George Savile, they would at
  the utmost give but a few words of cool rebuke to the young man and tell him
  to take his wife and be true to her and to forget his wayside doxy.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson, too, remembered his cloth. He could not, like another
  gentleman, defend his honour or that of his womenkind with the sword. Jack
  Corbyn had already mocked at him because of that. And if he were to go to him
  again, speak to him sternly, he would be termed a ranting parson and mocked
  at. Then he recalled with an unpleasant pang the five pounds that Betty had
  borrowed from her lover, and that he had spoken of so keenly.</p>

  <p>With a sigh the Rector sank down on the cushioned window-seat. There was a
  strong west wind blowing and the stars were thick like a gilded mist in the
  dark blue heavens. The lamp flame fluttered in the glass globe, and the loose
  papers on the table stirred as the breeze passed round the room.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson took no heed of these light sounds, so absorbed was he in
  his reverie, nor did he hear a soft footfall behind him, and he started when
  a hand was laid on his and a laughing voice said:</p>

  <p>"Sir, are you not coming down into the parlour?"</p>

  <p>The Rector turned to look into the smiling face of Betty Carr.</p>

  <p>She sat down beside him at once and took his slim hand in hers and added
  gaily:</p>

  <p>"But I'd rather you stayed here for a while, for I have something to say
  to you. Yes, a little confession to make."</p>

  <p>'Confession!' the word hung oddly in the Rector's mind. He smiled at
  Betty, not speaking, and she said anxiously:</p>

  <p>"You look tired, sir. Kate thought you were displeased with us to-day when
  you found us with the patterns of the wedding clothes, but that was not so,
  was it?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, why should I be displeased? But what was it you wanted to
  confess, Betty?"</p>

  <p>"To show you something, sir. Indeed, I would not confess if I did not want
  your help. I thought I could do this for myself, but it seems I cannot.
  Women, sir, are strangely handicapped."</p>

  <p>Betty, with the light restlessness of youth, was on her feet again and
  tugging at her brother-in-law's hand.</p>

  <p>"Must I come with you now, Bess? I am tired&mdash;with idleness, I
  confess, but still&mdash;tired."</p>

  <p>She drew the Rector gently from his study. He was not in the mood for
  childish games, but had not the heart to rebuke her when she was in post for
  pleasures.</p>

  <p>As they passed down the shallow stairs he saw Kate leaning over the upper
  banisters and so knew that the two young women were in a conspiracy against
  him. No doubt all their design was some frivolous matter, but it irked him
  that they should so intrigue against his peace; they knew not how they
  disturbed his ease of mind and tranquillity of soul with their fond
  pranks.</p>

  <p>He wished that his Kate, at least, had a steadier mind, and rather that
  they had not the company of poor Bessie, who seemed to have come between him
  and his wife, drawing her back into childish ways from that graver demeanour
  which he preferred.</p>

  <p>Yes, it seemed to William Mompesson as he followed Bessie out of the house
  into the sweet-smelling garden and the cool mountain air, that the deep
  affection between himself and his wife had been thinned and distracted since
  they had been at Eyam.</p>

  <p>"Bessie, dear child," he said, "where would you take me? I have been idle
  too long, indeed there is some work I must do if only it is to prepare my
  sermon for Sunday."</p>

  <p>"There are too many Sundays and too many sermons in your life," replied
  Bessie, lightly. "Think rather of the Fair that is coming."</p>

  <p>"St. Helen's Wake?" smiled the Rector sadly. "Ay, there are fairs enough
  in the Peak, but even that must be a serious matter to me, child, for I have
  six couples to marry besides yourself and John Corbyn. Think of the homilies
  I must compose."</p>

  <p>He felt her small, warm fingers squeeze closely into his palm.</p>

  <p>"I am very happy," she sighed, with a bright simplicity that smote him
  into poignant remembrance of Sythe Torre's tale of the mock wedding at
  Bakewell. "But come, you must see my secret and I must make my
  confession."</p>

  <p>The eager girl was leading him to the stables; the Rector was almost
  painfully conscious of the still beauty of the scene that overran his heart.
  There was a perfume of lavender and thyme enriching the thin air, the haze of
  stars had a hard, clear sparkle; the dark shapes of the orchard boughs and
  the white shapes of the beehives could be but dimly seen, though there was
  not a trace of mist. The square tower of the church showed beyond the boughs
  of the linden trees and the warm light of the Rectory windows cast squares of
  pale gold on the grass.</p>

  <p>The Rector drew an excitement from this peaceful scene, expectancy seemed
  to him to be in the crystal-clear air. He wondered how men could walk with
  heads on the earth with these wonders around them, speaking the name of God
  with so much ease on their lips, and thinking of nothing save their own petty
  trifles.</p>

  <p>Bessie led him to the stables.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want me to go abroad?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She pulled her hand from his, unlatched the stable door and showed him a
  new-comer standing at the manger&mdash;a stout gray horse, not very handsome,
  but healthy and well kept, who turned on them a large, soft eye.</p>

  <p>"That is Merriman," explained Bessie in a low, eager voice. "I bought him
  for seven pounds&mdash;five of them I had to borrow from John. Do you think
  that was an unmaidenly thing to do? I did not dare to come to you, for we
  have cost you so much, but the first pin money that John gives to me, I will
  return him those five gold pieces."</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to buy a horse, Bessie? You have your own mount and Kate
  has hers, and if you require another..."</p>

  <p>Bessie put her fingers first on her lips and then on those of the
  Rector.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Thomas Stanley's horse," came in an excited whisper. "You know
  it was taken from him and sold, because he would not pay the tithe and other
  money they said was due from him."</p>

  <p>The Rector, in amazement, interrupted.</p>

  <p>"What do you know of Mr. Thomas Stanley and his adventures, then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have met him," replied the girl, "and so has Kate. When we go
  abroad in the dells, as we have done, you know, often enough, and you have
  been in your study or at church. He is not very civil, indeed, he rebukes us
  for many things, for our fine clothes and our playings. But he is kind and
  steadfast, too, and I think that what he says is just."</p>

  <p>More than amazement held William Mompesson silent. He had to suffer the
  pang of guessing that these two young women had accepted from the errant
  dissenter advice and even rebukes that they had refused to take from him. Was
  it possible that Thomas Stanley did possess a spiritual power totally denied
  him, the Rector of Eyam?</p>

  <p>He spoke against Bessie's light chatter that yet was serious enough,
  though given in the tones of a chirruping bird.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand how you could have met this man! It is against the
  Law that he lurks here! What do you mean, you and Kate, making the
  acquaintance of this dissenter?"</p>

  <p>"We were sorry for him," said the girl, caressing the patient horse. "Do
  you know how he lives? He has nothing! All he had when he was Rector here he
  gave back again to the people, he did not save a penny. And now he lives in a
  little hut that he has built for himself on the moor. He does what service he
  can for these poor people and they in return give him his bread. His horse
  was very necessary to him&mdash;Merriman is a queer name for a Puritan horse,
  is it not, sir?" Bessie laughed, despite her own gravity. "But such the beast
  was called and he would not change it. And he used to go abroad with it, to
  visit friends and people whom he would succour. But that he cannot do
  now."</p>

  <p>"Hush, Bessie! What is all this?" The Rector firmly closed the stable door
  and led his sister-in-law away towards the orchard. "Why should your head be
  full of these things? You know the law against dissenters. I have been very
  tolerant with this Thomas Stanley. Perhaps, he is not so harmless&mdash;do
  not let pity obscure your judgment. Did he ask you to buy this horse for him?
  You should have come to me with that tale."</p>

  <p>"No, he did not," said Bessie firmly. "We heard about it and wondered to
  ourselves how he existed without the horse. And we knew the men who had it,
  and I got Mortin to buy it for me."</p>

  <p>The Rector exclaimed sadly: "You went to Jonathan Mortin instead of to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"He is kind and faithful, and I knew that you would have forbidden us. But
  now that the horse has been bought I want your advice as to how to give it to
  Thomas Stanley. Neither Kate nor I can lead it about until we meet the
  preacher and I do not like to send Mortin on this errand. So I thought you
  could arrange it."</p>

  <p>Even in the midst of his discomposure, William Mompesson could hardly
  forbear laughing.</p>

  <p>"You are a child, Bess, indeed, and I were foolish and unkind were I to
  try to thwart your charity, though it is wild and wasteful. I shall see that
  the gray horse is returned to Thomas Stanley. Perhaps I am sorry that I did
  not think of this myself."</p>

  <p>"Why should you?" said Bessie, at once loving and affectionate. "You have
  so much on your mind. Kate says you are really a great man and have wonderful
  thoughts when you sit alone in your study."</p>

  <p>"Poor Kate over-praises me," sighed the Rector, profoundly touched by this
  ingenuous tribute. "I am so far from being a great man, Bessie, that I cannot
  even learn to manage my own small affairs. When I am pensive, dear child, it
  is not because I dwell on any fault of thine or Kate's, but because of my own
  demerits, and maybe because of a lethargy I misname peace."</p>

  <p>He drew the girl's arm through his so that her hand rested on the cuff of
  his fine grey-cloth coat, and they paced together through the short grass of
  the orchard and between the beehives and beneath the twisted boughs where the
  small green apples showed dimly in the starlight.</p>

  <p>"Bessie," continued the Rector, in a warm, hurried tone, "thou hast a
  true, kind heart, and I value thy happiness above that of any other creature,
  save Kate and my little ones. Nay, all are equal in my eyes. Now, hearken!
  This marriage of thine! Is it wholly to thy liking? Thy Jack is truly all
  thou wouldst have him?" The girl fetched a doting sigh.</p>

  <p>"I love him," she stated, a little wondering at the severity of his tone,
  "and have done so since I first met him. He is my dear treasure."</p>

  <p>"Hast though thought upon his qualities," said the Rector earnestly.
  "Whether he is all that you would have in a man&mdash;true, and loyal, and
  brave, and pious?"</p>

  <p>"He seems these things to me." Then unexpectedly, with a mature gravity,
  Bessie added: "What will it help me to con all this over now? If he has more
  vices than virtues, how will it help me to know it? I am bound to him, I
  shall soon be his wife. I love him with a love that does, I think, lead up to
  God."</p>

  <p>William Mompesson was silent. He felt that indeed there was no more to be
  said, and that even if Bessie's marriage with Jack Corbyn was likely to bring
  her pain, it must go forward. It might be that the incident at Bakewell was
  no more than a jest such as any lusty young man might indulge in when in his
  cups, and not what Sythe Torre had said, and that it would not seem to anyone
  save the most fastidious the blasphemy and the treachery that it seemed to
  William Mompesson. Good corn or fruitless weeds, if ever Bessie was to have
  harvest she must garner it now.</p>

  <p>At last he said:</p>

  <p>"The money must be returned to Jack. I will give it to you to-morrow. You
  and Kate shall go and give it to him. Does he know for what you wanted
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I did not tell him. I think he does not like Mr. Stanley. I believe he
  would even have him sent to gaol. There are some things that Jack does not
  understand. Perhaps," added Bessie Carr humbly, "I may teach him."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Bessie, thou mayest teach him much by the mild art of love. And
  now go in, dear, and tell Kate, who I doubt not is waiting impatiently, that
  all is well and that grey Merriman shall be returned to Thomas Stanley."</p>

  <p>She kissed him for that, reaching up and touching his cheek with her cool
  lips. In that instant she seemed to him as young and innocent as the other
  little Bessie, his infant daughter.</p>

  <p>He watched her shadow among the shadows, hastening towards the dark
  house.</p>

  <p>Well, Kate would be pleased. He had made the two young women happy, and
  their action had been one of the sweetest charity. Yet he knew that humanly
  speaking he had made a fool of himself. The story would be all over the
  parish, nay, all over the Peak. Thomas Stanley would, perhaps, refuse to
  accept the gift. And even if he did not, it meant that he, William Mompesson,
  was aiding a law-breaker. It was but one more small tangle to be adjusted,
  one more small knot to be untied.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson turned towards the Rectory.</p>

  <p>And Sythe Torre and his appeal for help? His clumsy half-confession came
  back to the Rector's mind. He, too, had spoken of Thomas Stanley and of his
  advice. The man seemed to seduce everyone to listen to him.</p>

  <p>As the Rector crossed his threshold he decided: 'This fellow, be he saint
  or charlatan, must leave my parish. Two of us cannot hold the same post.'</p>

  <p>And he wondered uneasily if it were true, as the dissenter had declared it
  was, that when Thomas Stanley had been Rector here the place had been more
  quiet, more law-abiding. Whether the disturbances and scandals that had begun
  to show their ugly heads during the rule of Mr. Sherland Adams had really
  increased during the few months that he, William Mompesson, had been at
  Eyam?</p>

  <p>He did not go to bed at once, but passed into his little closet that was
  next to the library and lit his lamp and looked about him. He had arranged
  this room as a laboratory, but his equipment was modest, as he had neither
  means nor time to pursue deeply the study of chemistry. This science, which
  was but a new name for the old toil of the alchemists, had spread through the
  whole of England and had been greatly fostered by the examples of the King
  and his uncle, Prince Rupert, who were both noted chemists and spent many
  hours daily in their well-fitted laboratories.</p>

  <p>Sir George Savile, like almost every other elegant gentleman of the time,
  had been interested in the newfangled matters and at Rufford Park William
  Mompesson had learnt almost all he knew of chemicals and of medicines.</p>

  <p>Here he had a still and alembic, some jars and bottles of various drugs
  and compounds, syrups and unguents with which, if need arose, he dosed his
  parishioners and family, a small furnace, now unlit, some bellows and
  retorts, and some shelves on which stood books dealing with the subject that
  William Mompesson found so entrancing.</p>

  <p>He had soon discovered when he arrived at Eyam that he would have to be
  both very frank and very secret as to his experiments. His medicines and
  healing plasters must be made openly and candidly explained; his more
  difficult investigations must be kept from the knowledge of all save the
  taciturn Jonathan Mortin. For the inhabitants of this place were wrapped in
  gross superstitions that would have been laughed at at Rufford Park. William
  Mompesson had marked with astonishment the survival of pagan customs that
  must have been handed down from parent to child since the Roman occupation of
  the Peak.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he was forced to admit to himself that Christianity had here been
  merely superimposed upon paganism, a palimpsest. And added to all these
  superstitions and traditions of paganism, was a rich store of legends that
  had gathered during the succeeding ages.</p>

  <p>Therefore the Rector knew that were it to be bruited abroad that he did
  anything more than prepare simple medicines in his laboratory, he would be
  considered an astrologer, or wizard, no better than old Mother Sydall who
  gathered her herbs upon the moor when the moon was beneficent, or than those
  wandering quacks and charlatans who set up business under the sign of <i>The
  Brass Head</i> of Friar Bacon in Derby, Bakewell, or Buxton, and to whom all
  the credulous folk of the district flocked to hear their fortunes told, buy
  love charms, and be mulcted of their savings.</p>

  <p>Such gross quackery was extremely odious to the Rector, the more so as he
  saw that it affected all classes. He even suspected that Kate and Bessie had
  sometimes purchased copies of <i>Kelly's Almanac</i> or <i>Poor Robin's Book
  of Prophecies</i>, though he hoped they had not gone so far as to visit the
  astrologer who had lately hung out his sign opposite the church in Bakewell
  and whom Torre had mentioned.</p>

  <p>Now he looked round his own small laboratory with a regret for this strong
  interest that had to be forgone. His own ignorance seemed to hamper him like
  strong bonds round hands and feet.</p>

  <p>In the company of intelligent, eager men, who had gathered in the handsome
  rooms at Rufford Park, he had heard so many amazing projects propounded, so
  many potential discoveries discussed. He would have liked to give his life to
  this science, at present so cloudy, but which he felt contained so many
  possible benefits for mankind. And he wondered why God did not disclose his
  wonders sooner and more easily and thus tune disordered man by knowledge into
  harmony.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson sat down on the rude wooden chair by the cold furnace. The
  ceiling was painted as a cloudy sky and some few dispersed stars, and the
  light of the lamp flickered oddly on these false fires. Paper rolls of rich
  tobacco were on a shelf and long, smooth clay pipes, the gift of Sir George
  Savile, but never touched by Mr. Mompesson.</p>

  <p>He thought: 'This idleness must cease to-day. To-morrow at least I shall
  have to begin my task. I shall lock up this room and not be tempted to these
  experiments that are but toys. I will put aside my books, save my Bible and
  <i>Holy Living and Dying</i>. There are many matters that somehow I must
  adjust, I must get in touch with these people. I must see that Thomas Stanley
  leaves the district. I must speak again to Jack Corbyn. I must help Sythe
  Torre in his trouble. I must see St. Helen's Wake past without too much riot
  and blasphemy. How I am parcelled out! Every hour shows some lack. I will
  cast off grossness.'</p>

  <p>But these resolutions did not serve to calm his spirit. He was restless
  and went to the window and pulled aside the green drugget and stared from the
  painted stars to those that sparkled in the purple heavens between the curled
  clouds, seemingly formed of pale blue vapour, that floated like little puffs
  of smoke amid the dark hills.</p>

  <p>'Why am I not happy in this place?' thought the Rector. 'Should I now
  really prefer to be in the city where God is everywhere invisible or dim?
  Should I care to be wandering in the streets amidst the pimps and knaves, the
  catchpoles, where jaded lust searches for a mate, and all is noise and
  lashing whips, the shouts of chairmen, the wheels of hackneys, the scolding
  and bawdy songs, and the complaints of the tired lackeys? I am worthless
  indeed, if I lament that I am exiled here.'</p>

  <p>The Rector remained musing at the open window until it was later than he
  thought, and then went upstairs to his bedchamber where his Kate lay, next to
  the room in which were Ann and the two children.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson did not disturb his wife, but gently moved aside the
  bed-curtains, which were of white wool worked to a design of foxgloves and
  acorns by her own hand, and glanced down at her as she lay lightly asleep on
  the large, frilled pillow.</p>

  <p>The night-lamp in the hearth gave a soft glow to the room and filled it
  with wide shadows from the large pieces of furniture that had been part of
  Kate's dowry, and that she kept so finely polished that the room smelt
  faintly of wax as well as of the brown bay leaves and grey lavender flowers
  that were packed among the hidden clothes and linen in the presses.</p>

  <p>Kate looked young, pretty, and exempt from common frailty; she was flushed
  with sleep; her hair was bound by a rainbow-coloured ribbon through which the
  long curls escaped on to her throat and plump, white shoulder showing above
  the dropped lawn of the bed-gown. Her husband tenderly raised the slipping
  quilt so that she was covered; her breath came quickly, her upper lip,
  slightly raised, showed the small teeth pressed on the lower; the small
  muslin bags of dried violets under the pillow gave out a faint, dusty, sweet
  perfume.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson let the curtains fall together and went softly from the
  room.</p>

  <p>"If there are sorrows laid up for me, let her be spared."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE villagers celebrated the last day of St. Helen's Wake on
  the green of Eyam. The moon was full and the evening very warm, even
  excessively so for this mountainous district. The doors and windows of all
  the cottages stood open and most of the entrances were wreathed with flowers
  slung from poles on which fluttered flags, or attached by hooks to the
  lintels. Ferns, ox-eyed daisies, pansies, wild mint, and thyme, arum lilies
  and parsley plucked from the hedgerows and the fields mingled with the
  treasures of the cottage gardens&mdash;gillyflowers, roses, amaryllis,
  wallflowers, and stocks.</p>

  <p>The flags were made of scraps of coloured silk, tiffany, and cloth, some
  were very old and tattered. All the little houses had horn-lanterns hung in
  front, some had torches made of pine-knots, which sent a smoky flame into the
  evening air.</p>

  <p>On the green itself booths had been erected for the trading of sweetmeats,
  gingerbread, ribbons, toys and chapbooks.</p>

  <p>The entrances to all the inns stood wide open and bright light blazed from
  their long, low windows; these had been decorated with bunches of ash that
  had been brought from the hills and with streamers of gilded paper.</p>

  <p>The travelling mummers had erected a stage in front of <i>The Bull Inn</i>
  as the yard was not large enough to accommodate the spectators, and on the
  platform in front of the dark curtains, stuck with spangled stars and moon,
  the gibbering clown ran to and fro waving his bladder-skin and
  horse-tail.</p>

  <p>On another booth nearer the lych-gate, for once unguarded, Sythe Torre,
  supported by a large crowd of ribald miners, was challenging a professional
  wrestler.</p>

  <p>Here and there, surrounded by groups of their friends, the newly married
  brides danced upon the green, their wreaths twined with ribbon confining
  their flowing hair.</p>

  <p>Stoups of ale passed from hand to hand and the potboys were continually
  running to and from the inn with fresh supplies of liquor. The elder men sat
  on the ground or on benches smoking pipes and urging on the antics of the
  youngers. An orchestra of marrow bones, cleavers, and kitchen pans made a
  persistent din added to by the shrill trumpets blown by the mummers from the
  two corners of their platform.</p>

  <p>Nearly a thousand people were assembled in the wide village streets, for
  friends and relatives of the villagers had come from all over the Peak
  District to join in the revelry.</p>

  <p>The Rector moved among the merry-makers and was received with a casual
  recognition and a perfunctory respect. He had not been successful in drawing
  many of either his own parishioners or their visitors into the church.
  Morning after morning he had preached to benches empty save for the members
  of his own household. His efforts to repress gross disorder during the wake,
  though ably seconded by the village constable, a stern and able man suspected
  of being a dissenter, had not been popular or fruitful.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson tried now to join in the merriment of his parishioners, to
  tell himself that their plays and pastimes were innocent and even necessary,
  but he could neither enjoy himself nor sympathize much with the enjoyment of
  others; these whirling dancers, these blowsed faces, these raucous shouts and
  coarse jests, the steady cacophony of the local musicians, all disgusted him,
  made his head ache, and even, as the night continued, his senses reel.</p>

  <p>This last night of St. Helen's Wake seemed to whirl round him like a
  tawdry phantasmagoria, and the scene on which the moon poured down her cold
  bluish light became as unreal as hideous.</p>

  <p>All Mr. Mompesson's delicate senses as he made his way, trying to speak a
  courteous word here and give a pleasant smile there, were assailed at once.
  There were smells of sweat, of drink, of frying food, the odour of the acrid
  smoke of the torches, of the rancid oil in the lamps in front of the booths,
  there was the clatter of coarse voices, the shrill of tin trumpets, the
  shriek of unrestrained laughter, while sight was bewildered with the whirling
  shapes of so many scrambling, leaping, pushing figures in gaudy finery hung
  with strips of ribbon, stuck with broken feathers, with coloured belts and
  draggled skirts.</p>

  <p>The sweet short grass of the village green had been worn away under foot,
  and though the space was wide open to the unclouded mountain air, yet the
  atmosphere seemed tainted. The long poles of mountain ash festooned with
  flowers, the garlands above the door were withered and hanging in lank,
  rotting wreaths.</p>

  <p>The coarse scene was misted to Mr. Mompesson's eyes by the fumes of
  tobacco, smoke from the open fires and the knot torches.</p>

  <p>Games were in progress in one part of the green to which he made his way;
  large tubs of water had been supplied and in these youths were diving for
  apples. Some of the games in which the villagers liked to indulge were so
  barbarous that Mr. Mompesson had forbidden them. He knew this had caused
  muttering against him; in particular, the people regretted their favourite
  cruel pastime of goose-riding.</p>

  <p>The yelling apple-divers, who were half-drunk, took no notice of the
  Rector, who turned away and passed a bridal party seated on the grass
  drinking ale and eating love cakes. He noted with a slight wince their pagan
  custom of passing the bottle or glass according to the course of the sun. The
  thing itself was a foolish trifle, but everything he saw convinced him that
  these people were pagans, and not true Christians, although the grey church
  had stood so long in their midst.</p>

  <p>Earlier that day he had taken a walk that was a favourite of his leisure,
  to Wett-Withins, where stood a strange temple or circle of sixteen oblong
  sand-stones placed in an upright position and surrounded by a deep ridge of
  earth. The use and antiquity of these stones could only be guessed, but Mr.
  Mompesson had a scholarly interest in such antiquities and knew that they
  were very old indeed and probably represented the remains of some heathen
  temple, in which hideous sacrifices had taken place with mysterious and
  accurst rites of shameful slaughter.</p>

  <p>Near to this ruined temple were several mighty barrows; the Rector had
  been told that some years since one of these had been opened and found to
  contain ashes, bones, arrow-heads of flint, a little charcoal and urns of
  exceeding beauty, which had however been smashed in the hopes that they
  contained coins.</p>

  <p>These uncouth and dreadful symbols of paganism came into his mind as he
  watched St. Helen's Wake, and he asked himself if these were not the true
  descendants of those people who had watched their bloody priests slit the
  throats of their victims on the sacrificial stone. Even now, if they were
  allowed to, they would have their blood feasts, of animals if not of human
  beings.</p>

  <p>As the night grew on the revellers became with every hour more drunk, more
  obscene, more noisy and ferocious.</p>

  <p>By midnight almost the only sober man was Samuel Ealott, the village
  constable, a man on whom the Rector placed great reliance, although he
  probably was a secret follower of Thomas Stanley.</p>

  <p>Ealott, lean and vigorous, now strode from group to group, using his
  bludgeon on those who defied his authority, threatening the scolds with the
  cucking-stool, the cheating mountebanks with the pillory or Derby gaol, and
  dragging, with the assistance of the pot-boys, the drunkards from off the
  green into the porches of the inns, in order to save them from being kicked
  to death by the merry-makers.</p>

  <p>'I can do no good here,' thought William Mompesson. 'What have I to say to
  them, if they should listen?'</p>

  <p>He made his way through the pressing throng, the confusing shadows and
  spurts of light, towards the church and the Rectory.</p>

  <p>It was with a sinking of the heart that he observed by the flare of the
  lamps in front of the mountebanks' booth the stalwart and comely figure of
  Jack Corbyn. The young gentleman, though sober compared to his fellows, was
  red-faced, sweating and shouting.</p>

  <p>The long, fair love-lock that hung over his brow was tied up with a tawdry
  pink ribbon that he had bought at the fair. His lace cravat hung unknotted
  and there was dust and wine-stains on his elegant, peach-coloured coat.</p>

  <p>As he represented the family that had been for years the most powerful in
  the neighbourhood, he received the respect and attention that had been denied
  the Rector. He was popular, too, for he was a good sportsman, a fine athlete
  and open-handed with his money. Now he continually put his hand in his pocket
  and flung silver pieces among the crowd whom he entertained with his jests,
  mocks and snatches of bawdy song.</p>

  <p>Some of his party were urging him on to try a fall with Sythe Torre who
  had defeated his rival and stood panting and triumphant, his arms folded over
  his chest, in front of the little ragged booth where the mutton-fat candles
  flared in their horn cups.</p>

  <p>It was but a week to John Corbyn's wedding and the Rector was deeply
  offended by his present demeanour. But he was offended by almost everything
  that John Corbyn did and he had resolved to endure the pranks of this man
  whom Bessie loved. But then it was galling to see the bridegroom who was
  loved standing there to make a show for fools, and Mr. Mompesson was
  half-minded to step up to him and tell Jack to be gone. But he knew that to
  do so would be only to provoke a party against himself, for all were in
  favour of their young lord, and he, William Mompesson, had no hold over them
  whatsoever, either through his own personality or as representative of the
  Church.</p>

  <p>So he stood apart, in the shade beyond the flare of the lamps and torches,
  with his hand at his chin and looked with a thoughtful melancholy at the wild
  scene.</p>

  <p>The mummers put on a little miming show and young Corbyn applauded it,
  called for more wine and drank again and made some jest that was applauded
  with loud laughter, while he played with the question whether or no he should
  try to wrestle with Sythe Torre.</p>

  <p>'He'll have his ribs cracked and his neck broken if he does,' thought the
  Rector. And he decided that if the young fool was dared into accepting the
  challenge he would step in to interfere.</p>

  <p>But the idea left the young man's fuddled brain soon enough, and he turned
  his attention to a woman who appeared on the stage and who recited in a sweet
  voice some crudely indecent doggerel. The lines did not lack a spice of
  coarse wit, and the charm and innocent air of the young actress held her
  half-circle of audience enthralled.</p>

  <p>The Rector, stepping a little nearer, regarded her closely, for he
  supposed that she was the heroine of the mock-marriage ceremony at Bakewell.
  And though to him, with his high fastidiousness and nice narrow preciseness,
  she was a creature utterly lost, smirched and degraded, yet he acknowledged
  her bright seductive comeliness.</p>

  <p>She was no older than Bessie Carr and her life, which the Rector thought
  must be utterly foul, had left no trace upon her. Her face was smooth, her
  limbs were rounded, the lustre of her comely youth showed even through the
  coarse paint upon her cheeks and eyelids and lips. Her pale yellow hair,
  crisply curled, was half-hidden by a gilt cardboard crown; a chemise of
  pale-blue silk fell loosely open and left her almost naked to the waist where
  a belt of black satin held up trailing skirts of stained and tattered rose
  tiffany.</p>

  <p>So young was she, so charming, and her air so naturally innocent and
  ingenuous, that she reminded the Rector, with an indescribable pang, of
  Bessie and even of Kate. It was as if she recited her ugly lines and made her
  ugly gestures without knowing what they meant.</p>

  <p>When she had finished she stepped from the platform and went round the
  crowd collecting money in a shell. When she came to John Corbyn he put his
  arm her waist and gave her a smacking kiss, first on one cheek and then on
  the other, and taking a piece of money from his pocket put it, amid the
  drunken applause from the crowd, not into the shell that she carried, but
  into her open bosom. The froward girl resisted only sufficiently to give a
  relish to the scene, and struggled languidly, half-naked, leering up at the
  youth while the cardboard crown slipped over her heavy eyes.</p>

  <p>At this exasperating sight the Rector became past all prudent and
  dignified consideration. He tried to push aside two men standing in front of
  him and to move out of the shadow into the circle of light in front of the
  booths. But there was another who was quicker than he, one whom hitherto he
  had not noticed, but who must have been close beside him in the dark
  hurly-burly of the fair.</p>

  <p>This was Thomas Stanley, who, in his rough patched country clothes with no
  sign of his calling about his robust, thick-set person, suddenly forced his
  way to the front and demanded silence in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>At the same instant, and with no heed of anyone, he put his thick-set hand
  on Jack Corbyn's chest and pushed him from the girl with such considerable
  force that the young man staggered into the arms of those behind him and the
  girl, cursing, fell down in front of the mummers' booths.</p>

  <p>"Leave thy trull," commanded the dissenter coolly, "and go home, John
  Corbyn, and cleanse thyself for thy wedding day. Hang thy head and groan for
  thy sins."</p>

  <p>William Mompesson stepped forward instantly and the two clergymen stood
  side by side in the glare of the lamps from the rude platform. The Rector had
  thought that the half-drunken crowd would turn upon the dissenter and
  maltreat him and that it would be necessary for him, the Rector, to intervene
  in order to avoid dangerous and disgraceful consequences to Mr. Stanley's
  bold intervention.</p>

  <p>But he was, as he soon discovered to his chagrin, mistaken. At the first
  sight of Thomas Stanley the crowd seemed awed and John Corbyn sobered, while
  two of the strolling players dragged the screaming girl between the dingy
  curtains, the spectators fell back so that the landlord of <i>The Bull</i>,
  the constable and the potboys were soon able to clear them away. Some, to the
  Rector's amazement, even muttered excuses and pulled at their forelocks;
  during the time that he had been in authority Thomas Stanley must have made
  himself feared if not beloved. As for himself, the Rector of Eyam, few took
  any heed, least of all the man whom he had sprung forward to protect. The
  dissenter looked with grim satisfaction on the scattered merry-makers and
  remarked dryly:</p>

  <p>"Here is enough ungodliness, blasphemy, and wantonness to draw down a
  judgment as severe as that predicted by last year's comet."</p>

  <p>"When you were Rector here were you able to restrain this licence?" asked
  Mr. Mompesson.</p>

  <p>"Such scenes as these were not witnessed under my ministry," replied Mr.
  Stanley. And he gave but a casual attention to his successor; his eyes,
  gleaming in the weather-beaten face with the intensity of his feeling, were
  turned towards the young esquire who, with a sick look, was leaning against
  one of the supports of the booths chewing a nugget of tobacco. He was
  dishevelled, soiled and degraded from his gentility.</p>

  <p>"I have marked you, John Corbyn, since you were brought to me as a little,
  wilful child," said Mr. Stanley, "and I see no mending of your ways, no
  patching up of your errors."</p>

  <p>And he continued to preach at the young man in the conventional language
  of clerical reproof. The Rector was amazed to see that Esquire Corbyn did not
  seem to resent these reprimands, and though Mr. Mompesson was glad to see
  these signs of grace in his future brother-in-law, he thought that the
  Puritan had ranted long enough and his sympathies began to veer towards the
  man who was, after all, of his own Church and his own class, young, and
  shamed publicly.</p>

  <p>So he went up to John Corbyn and put his hand through his arm, saying:</p>

  <p>"Let's get away from this, here's enough of it. Soon everyone will be
  drunk and lying senseless on the green. Let's leave them to it."</p>

  <p>The young man looked at him, smiling a little sadly, and remarked
  irrelevantly:</p>

  <p>"There's the sleeping sickness in Derby. I heard from one who came from
  Bakewell; the grass grows in some of the streets."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" replied the Rector. "Is there not always sickness somewhere? If it
  be not the pox or the <i>Gallicus morbus</i>, it is scurvy or measles. But we
  are safe in this fastness. Come, Jack, let us away."</p>

  <p>"Tender my regards to Bessie and say nothing of my behaviour to-night,"
  begged the young man earnestly, with a more chastened look than William
  Mompesson had seen him use before. "I'll home to the Manor House; see me
  to-morrow when I am in better trim." He added: "I chew this tobacco against
  the infection, they say there is nothing like that and cloths soaked in
  vinegar."</p>

  <p>As he lurched away, Mr. Stanley, who had not moved from his post beside
  the mummers' booth, remarked with satisfaction:</p>

  <p>"See how his mind runs&mdash;on punishment for his sins. Sickness cannot
  come within fifty miles of his doors, but he is afraid of it."</p>

  <p>"It is not fifty miles from here to Derby," replied the Rector with a
  little smile. "But I have never been afraid of sickness. How should a man
  live if he were, it being so frequent among us?"</p>

  <p>The Puritan was now moving away through the subdued revellers towards the
  western part of the village where the stream ran across the road not far from
  the lych-gate and was crossed by two rude foot-bridges.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson followed him and with a selfish pleasure said:</p>

  <p>"My sister-in-law, Elizabeth Carr, bought the gray horse that you
  forfeited for non-payment of your fines. She wishes it to be returned to you
  and I have agreed to her request. Will you tell me of some place where I may
  deliver the beast?"</p>

  <p>The Rector was gratified by seeing the Nonconformist at last moved in a
  human and personal fashion. He paused, pulled off his broad-brimmed hat, put
  his hand to his brow, looked on the ground and then at the Rector, who
  regarded him with a faint; smile in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"My gray horse, Merriman?" he asked at last. "The young gentlewoman bought
  it for me?"</p>

  <p>"For you indeed. I did not know you had an acquaintance with my wife?"</p>

  <p>"I have met them sometimes when they have been abroad in the dells, and
  spoken a word in peace. I had not thought of this. Now, shall I take it or
  not?" The sturdy man looked upwards to the stars, as if he sought an answer
  from on high.</p>

  <p>The Rector instantly rebuked himself for finding this ridiculous. How did
  he know whether or not this other human being had a means of communicating
  with his God?</p>

  <p>"I will take the animal," said Thomas Stanley simply. "If you will send
  your man with him to the head of Middleton Dell to-morrow at noon I shall be
  there to receive him. I know one who will stable him for me, yes, and feed
  him too."</p>

  <p>"Both that one and I," said the Rector, with a deepening of his smile,
  "are breaking the law in aiding you. But my advice, nay, I might call it my
  command to you, is to use this horse to leave my parish. Get, if you can, a
  licence to preach. Do not use it here."</p>

  <p>"Thou hast said! Thou hast said!" replied the dissenter casually. And then
  added: "I thank you for your good offices. Perhaps some day I can repay the
  young gentlewoman's kindness."</p>

  <p>He crossed the bridge and, going towards the unguarded lych-gate, was soon
  lost in the shadows that were thick beyond the circle of lamplight and
  torchlight on the green.</p>

  <p>'He, not I, should be in charge of these people. They fear, obey and
  respect him, but me they count as nothing. Surely they do not like me nor do
  I love them.'</p>

  <p>And the young Rector, as he turned towards the green, wondered how it was
  that God had chosen as his instrument the heretic and not himself, the loyal
  son of Holy Church. Unless he were to be false to his vows, a traitor to his
  holy profession, the Rector must believe that Thomas Stanley was mistaken at
  least in his belief, if not wholly misled and blinded by the Devil. How then
  was it possible for him to be an upright, godly man as he so manifestly was,
  one who despised all earthly things and lived only for spiritual matters? The
  Rector could not resolve this problem. He walked sadly across the village
  green, the desecrated fair ground. Fatigue had fallen upon the revellers and
  the sudden appearance of the Puritan and the withdrawal of the young esquire
  had damped their spirits.</p>

  <p>The mummers had put out their lamps in front of their booths, the
  wrestling was over and Sythe Torre, inert from heavy drinking, lay asleep on
  a bundle of sacks beside the painted pillars of the gaudy little stage. Other
  drunkards, men and women, lay here and there in their soiled and torn holiday
  clothes, wreaths of crushed flowers hanging over their brows, paper,
  cardboard and tinsel crowns beneath their tousled heads.</p>

  <p>Weeping children were being led away by tired mothers; a languid fight
  between three gipsy men was going on outside <i>The Bull</i>, the constable
  and the landlord were separating them with the blows of a tipstaff and a
  cudgel. The torches had flared out, most of the candles set in the windows
  had guttered away, the moonlight lay pure and clear over this scene of
  disorder.</p>

  <p>There was a faint sound of running water audible now that the tumult of
  the fair had subsided. This came from those underground streams known as the
  wallows, which passed under the village to fall down the mountain-side
  waterbreaks into the neighbouring dells. The northern heights that shut in
  the village were crowned with darkness and showed purple-black against the
  silver pallor of the sky.</p>

  <p>The Rector made his way across the grass strewn with platters, papers of
  sweetmeats, dropped garters and favours. Dogs were nosing about to pick up
  what they could of the broken meats and bones.</p>

  <p>Very few took any heed of the Rector, only here and there a toper raised
  himself upon his elbow and muttered: "God save you, sir!" and pulling at his
  forelock, sank back to snore.</p>

  <p>Mr. William Mompesson was glad to be free from these sights and the
  stenches, glad to be near the great lindens of the churchyard. It was past
  their flowering time, but a faint perfume seemed to come from their large
  leaves, and the starlight gave a dignified, serene beauty to the commonplace
  outline of the old church that was now but a vast shadow on the spangled
  sky.</p>

  <p>The young man, always responsive to peace and loveliness, felt soothed and
  uplifted. He would have liked to put his hand into the cool water, to splash
  it over his face to wash away the sour remembrances of the tawdry night.</p>

  <p>He looked towards the Manor House, which he could see on the slopes beyond
  the village. There was a light in one of the upper windows; he hoped that
  Jack Corbyn was there, praying perhaps, composing himself for sleep. And the
  Rector put up his own prayer&mdash;that light-hearted, kind Bessie, so
  ignorant and simple, who had never known anything except childish happiness,
  and dissolute young Jack Corbyn, who was, nevertheless, no doubt a humane,
  brave and generous man, should be happy together in their marriage.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Mompesson approached the Rectory, he was surprised to find that
  there was a light also in one of his rooms&mdash;in Kate's chamber. This was
  a late hour for his wife to be sitting up, and it was with a little prick of
  alarm that he entered his quiet house and went up to Kate's fine room.</p>

  <p>Was one of the children ill, or Kate herself indisposed? Or had Betty
  proved wilful because she had been denied her wish to go to the fair on the
  green?</p>

  <p>But his alarm was allayed as soon as he opened his door. His wife was
  smiling; she was seated on the bed-step by the round table with the
  embroidered top. On this stood two candles that had given the light he had
  seen as he came round the churchyard wall.</p>

  <p>"My dearest dear, you should be in bed. I went abroad to see what they
  were doing at the wake, but I made but a poor business of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose it is very late," replied the young woman placidly, "but I
  had not noticed how the time went, I had such happy thoughts."</p>

  <p>He stood beside her, looking down at her tenderly and deeply moved. How
  sweet and fair she was and all the atmosphere she had about her, how
  refreshing to the spirit it was to come into her presence and into this
  pleasant chamber after the rude sights and sounds he had been mingling with
  on the green.</p>

  <p>Kate rose and rested against his bosom; her hair and her pale gray linen
  bed-gown, which was tied with cherry ribbons, smelt of the dried violet
  flowers that she kept under her pillow and in her wardrobe. The air of the
  whole room was full of the mingled clean, sharp smell of the odours of
  lavender, bergamot, bay and cinnamon.</p>

  <p>For Kate kept a little cupboard of aromatics beside her bed and the door
  was open and the stoppers out of some of the bottles, and Ann Trickett had
  come to her that evening complaining of a cold on the chest.</p>

  <p>"See how untidy I am," she said, comfortable in her husband's arms. "I did
  not even shut up my little cabinet, I was thinking so much of how happy I am
  with you."</p>

  <p>"Be sincere with yourself and with me. Are you not happy merely because
  you feel you ought to be happy? For that is my trouble, Kate. I count my
  blessings morning and evening and still I have to say to myself I am not
  grateful to my God as I should be. Is it so with you, sweet Kate?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have read my mind a little," she confessed with a sigh. "Yet
  it is true I am very happy with you and the children and Bessie. And even
  with Ann and Jonathan Mortin&mdash;yes, with everyone."</p>

  <p>"But you are a little lonely here, Kate? You don't like these people! You
  find this solitary place dreary to your pleasant spirit?"</p>

  <p>"It is true, Mompesson, that I have longed for the town or for Rufford
  Park. Oh, I don't know! Yes, perhaps there is a melancholy on my spirits. But
  it is true what I told you just now, I am happy." And her clear eyes looked
  at him with valiant defiance. "We should be ungrateful people if we were not
  happy, shouldn't we, Mompesson? Besides," she added, with a sophistry that
  made her husband laugh despite his grave intention, "we can ask Sir George to
  move us soon."</p>

  <p>"We should not do that, dear Kate. We should take the path that lies to
  the hand, we should try to help these rude people. The dissenter, Thomas
  Stanley, endeavours to do so."</p>

  <p>"He is a holy man," interrupted Kate thoughtfully, fingering the fine
  ribbons at her husband's throat.</p>

  <p>"A holy man! Yes!" William Mompesson was serious. "That means that you do
  not think that I am one."</p>

  <p>"You are but twenty-six years old," she laughed up into his face. "I don't
  want you to be so holy yet."</p>

  <p>"There have been saints and martyrs younger than I," replied the Rector.
  "My failure is not due to my lack of years. And now, Kate, why do you sit up
  so late? Have you something to say to me?" for he knew that that was her
  custom, when she had some little matter on her heart, to wait for him and
  tell him before they went to bed. She had done this before, when he had been
  busy in his laboratory or his study, and sometimes had not come upstairs
  until the dawn had paled the stars.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have something to tell you. Bessie had her little confession the
  other night, and now I've mine. Now you must not be angry, William, but I
  have disobeyed you. You know," she went on with such an eager, pretty
  breathlessness that he had no heart to check her, much less to chide her,
  "that I am worldly and foolish"</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it, Kate? Out with this dreadful secret."</p>

  <p>"Well, you know you told me we were not to spend too much on Bessie's
  marriage&mdash;either of thought or time or money. But I am afraid we have
  spent far more of all than will please you. But I wished everything to be
  fine for Bessie. And, after all, she will have a good estate, and if we have
  exceeded our means she can pay us back."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry she borrowed the five pounds from John," he interrupted. "She
  must take that to him."</p>

  <p>"Why, William, that is foolishness. In but a matter of days she will be
  Mistress John Corbyn and have her own settlement. You know how they have been
  generous."</p>

  <p>"Well, Kate, do not run on so, but tell me what this little secret
  is."</p>

  <p>She raised her brilliant eyes appealingly and her delicate fingers
  continued to play with the ribbons beneath her fine lawn band.</p>

  <p>"It is the wedding dress. We could not be content with a country
  tailor&mdash;we sent for it from London."</p>

  <p>"Why, Kate, that's very extravagant. George Vickers is an excellent tailor
  and gets fine cloth from Derby, ay, and good silk too."</p>

  <p>"But this is satin, fine white satin," said Kate coaxingly. "It is laced
  with silver and a design of lilies. And the petticoat is of silver
  tissue."</p>

  <p>"And what is the cost of all this to be, sweetheart?" He put her from him
  into the tapestry chair with arms. He was weary, in no mood to be angry with
  her frivolity yet feeling a lack of comfort in coming home to this&mdash;his
  Kate's absorption with worldly gear, after a day that had been empty and in a
  way humiliating.</p>

  <p>She chattered on about the gown. George Vickers, who was the tailor and
  lived between the barber and the cobbler in the group of houses beyond Eyam
  Church, had long had, it seemed, a box of patterns, of fine French and
  Italian brocades and silks that he procured, when need arose, from an English
  merchant whose warehouse was on St. Paul's Wharf in London. It had been some
  years since Mr. Vickers had had any need to call upon his London supply,
  though he had in the past made fine gowns of these brocades for Madame Corbyn
  and for the wives of some of the other gentry in the Peak. For though he
  lived modestly in the small village, Vickers had a reputation for fine work
  and care and diligence.</p>

  <p>The story that Catherine Mompesson told now was that of a visit paid to
  this tailor by herself and Bessie some months ago.</p>

  <p>"Before we knew that the expenses would be so high," pleaded Kate. And
  there they had chosen the thick white French satin and all the trimmings that
  were to make the wedding gown for Bessie.</p>

  <p>When they learned of the Rector's disapproval of so many extravagances for
  this village wedding, they would, although half-heartedly, have cancelled the
  order. But Vickers said that it was too late and the stuff was already on the
  road. It had lain for a while at Derby and only two days before had it been
  forwarded, by the carrier's cart to Eyam. Kate, feeling very discreet, had
  told Mr. Vickers to leave the box unopened until the wake was over.</p>

  <p>She and Bessie could have it sent up to the house and fitted and altered
  in peace&mdash;"for Ann Trickett, you know, and the kitchen woman, and even
  Jonathan Mortin and all had been so distracted by the Fair."</p>

  <p>"You have not, then, seen the dress?" said William Mompesson, trying to
  feign an interest in this piece of extravagant finery and wondering in his
  mind how much it would cost and feeling that his resources would be strained
  to pay for it, for as poor Bess was nearly dowerless, he could by no means
  bring himself to accept money from Corbyn for her wedding attire.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know how much it will cost, dear. You think of nothing else
  but that, and I suppose you are right. But I'm sure Lady Halifax would give
  it to us as a present."</p>

  <p>"Kate, I could not think that she should be asked for so much. She has
  given us more than I care about as it is. This furnishing of the Rectory
  causes something of a scandal here in this poor rough place."</p>

  <p>Kate tossed her pretty head.</p>

  <p>"We'll leave that," she said, with a touch of sharpness, "for it's a
  matter on which we differ."</p>

  <p>Then, instantly repenting, she added: "Wait until you see it. Mr. Vickers
  has made a drawing of what it is to be when it is completed."</p>

  <p>"It is made up then?" asked the Rector indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was made up in London by the London tailors and has only to be
  fitted to Bess and some of the trimmings put on here. Why, you foolish man,
  there would not be time to make it up now. Bessie's wedding is but a week
  off."</p>

  <p>William Mompesson kissed his wife's brow.</p>

  <p>"Then I will leave you now to your sleep and go to mine, and in the
  morning you must send for this gown and I will see it on Bess."</p>

  <p>"You are not angry then?"</p>

  <p>She clung to him and embraced him, giving him hard, cool kisses that
  expressed her pleasure at his acquiescence in her folly, as no doubt he
  considered it, and her appeal for a complete forgiveness.</p>

  <p>The Rector soothed his wife and returned her kisses, persuaded her to go
  to bed and so left her for his own closet.</p>

  <p>More and more this marriage that the women made so much of weighed upon
  his spirit. He would be glad when it was over and all the junketings
  vanished. What a to-do there was in a household that should have been so
  quiet, the hiring of extra women, the baking already of cakes and sweetmeats
  and the making of preserves and comfits. The house would be full of guests,
  and already Kate had complained that her room was not large enough for the
  wedding feast.</p>

  <p>Ambition and vanity, no less, though prettily disguised.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE PAGAN ALTAR</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Rector fell asleep from weariness and sank into deep
  dreams. He did not remember them when he woke suddenly with a start. In his
  sleep a thought had come to his disordered mind that caused him to sit up,
  wide awake, in bed&mdash;between a nightmare and reality.</p>

  <p>London! The wedding dress had come from London! The Lord-Lieutenant had
  warned him to have nothing to do with any goods that came from the
  capital.</p>

  <p>Why? The plague, despite the severity of the last winter, had come
  creeping in again. There were various rumours, exaggerated perhaps, or false,
  but the Earl had warned him to have nothing to do with anything that came
  from London.</p>

  <p>The Rector slept no more that night. With early sunlight he was dressed
  and left the Rectory.</p>

  <p>The day was bright and clear, the linden trees showed gold against the
  cloudless blue; it was already hot; everything was dry and gilded.</p>

  <p>The young man's heart was heavy because of his errand. He could not really
  credit that there could be much danger in a parcel that had come from so far
  and been so long on the road, and though he had studied medicine he knew
  little about contagion. He had heard an old Turkish story that the plague had
  been brought into Constantinople in the jacket of a janizary, and this last
  outbreak in London was said by some to have been brought by Dutch prisoners
  of war, who in their turn had caught it from cargoes brought into Amsterdam
  from the East.</p>

  <p>And this illness in Derby! What was that? One heard so many tales and knew
  not what to believe. When he was a child, William Mompesson had heard his
  father talk of the many illnesses that were rife during the Civil War and in
  particular of that horrid outbreak of the sweating sickness which had ruined
  the troops of my Lord Essex outside Oxford and infected the whole city.</p>

  <p>He remembered, too, with scorn for his own superstition, the comet of last
  year, the words of Sythe Torre about a judgment sent by God for undiscovered
  crime, and Thomas Stanley's words last night about punishment for licence and
  blasphemy.</p>

  <p>Well, this doom might be evaded by the exercise of a little common sense,
  he told himself grimly as he passed the low churchyard wall. The box had not
  yet been opened, it must be taken out to one of the moors beyond the town and
  there burned and the reason given. And Bessie and Kate would be in tears;
  there would be a gloom over the wedding. Some gown must be found for the
  disappointed girl: no doubt there were many that were suitable in the
  wardrobe that she and Kate had been getting together with so much busy
  chatter.</p>

  <p>With these thoughts, the Rector passed rapidly round the church and was
  surprised to find his way barred by a group of noisy young miners who had not
  been to bed that night and who were celebrating the end of the wake by coarse
  pastimes.</p>

  <p>In their midst was a young cow that one of them was leading by a straw
  halter. When the Rector, pausing, asked sternly why they had the animal so
  near the churchyard, Sythe Torre, who dominated his fellows by the power
  given to him by his gigantic stature, grinned:</p>

  <p>"They did more than have it in the churchyard, sir. It was taken in the
  church!"</p>

  <p>"This is more than a drunken jest! It is hideous blasphemy!" cried the
  Rector, deeply outraged. "Away with you! Take the beast to where it belongs,
  and I shall devise some penance."</p>

  <p>He spoke with more authority than he had used before, and the men were
  cowed, all except Sythe Torre, who stood leaning against the churchyard gate,
  his arms folded on his bare chest, his ragged shirt hanging in tatters on his
  gleaming shoulders.</p>

  <p>"A penance, sir!" he jeered in hoarse, sulky tones. "Now what penance
  would you set on me? The other night I asked you about a penance and you had
  no word of comfort. Well, sir, if there's no penance for a crime, what is
  there for taking a cow into a church?"</p>

  <p>The scene had become ludicrous; without further speech, the Rector moved
  away. He heard the miners whistling and laughing among themselves as they
  drove the cow down the village street. This was behaviour that he must take
  notice of... he thought: 'Thomas Stanley would not have endured this.'</p>

  <p>And then into his tired mind slipped the remembrance of the grey horse,
  Merriman, and that he must tell Mortin to take it to the head of the glen.
  But his immediate errand was with George Vickers.</p>

  <p>He paused outside the small thatched house from which hung the sign of a
  large pair of shears. On one side was the striped pole and brass basin of
  Henry Sentem, the barber-surgeon of the village, and on the other a wooden
  statue of Saint Crispin that marked the residence of the shoemaker and
  cobbler, James Frogatt.</p>

  <p>The Rector knocked at the door vigorously with his ivory-headed cane, and
  a night-capped head was soon thrust out at the upper window. The slim figure,
  handsome face, auburn curls and elegant clothes of William Mompesson formed
  in the eyes of the villagers a picture of an elegant gentleman as complete as
  that represented by Sir George Savile, who once or twice had visited his
  Manor, or my Lord at Chatsworth. They were still not used to considering him
  as the Rector, that term being reserved in the hearts of almost all of them
  for Thomas Stanley.</p>

  <p>So Vickers blinked stupidly for a while, not recognizing in the young man
  looking up at him, William Mompesson. When he did, he excused himself hastily
  and protested he would come down as soon as he could get his breeches on.</p>

  <p>"It's the wedding dress that my wife and sister-in-law had from London,"
  explained the Rector, looking up. He was hatless, and the pure chill morning
  air was blowing the hair backwards from his face. He had dressed carelessly
  and there was an air of disorder about his person and his manner that was
  most uncommon, for usually he was, at least outwardly, serene.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're in a hurry for it, sir," cried Vickers, plucking off his
  nightcap as a mark of respect for the fine gentleman standing below. "Well,
  it shall be sent up at once."</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay! That it must not be. It must be taken out and burnt in the
  fields. I will make full compensation. Pray, do not open the box!"</p>

  <p>"But it was opened last night, sir. We thought that the clothes would be
  getting damp, and so my man had them out and hung them in front of the fire
  in the kitchen. The box was on the road longer than usual, sir&mdash;as far
  as I understand, a matter of six or seven weeks." Then the core of the
  Rector's words drifting into his bewildered brain, the tailor exclaimed:
  "Burnt, sir! Did you say they must be burnt!"</p>

  <p>"Do not shout from the window, come down to the door. Let me into your
  parlour and I will speak to you quietly."</p>

  <p>The Rector's senses became alert; he realized that he must not cause any
  alarm or panic in Eyam. The awful word 'plague' must not be mentioned. After
  all, there might be nothing in this fear of his... the Lord-Lieutenant's
  warning might have been merely a matter of precaution. He certainly must not
  upset these simple people.</p>

  <p>When George Vickers, hurriedly clothed and agape and agitated, had
  admitted him to the tiny house, the Rector said:</p>

  <p>"I must trust you with a secret. It is something that might be important
  and might be of no matter. First of all understand that I will pay you the
  full value of these garments from London. I have been told by the
  Lord-Lieutenant that we should have no goods from the capital, the plague has
  broken out again."</p>

  <p>"Lord have mercy upon us!" muttered the tailor with sagging chops.</p>

  <p>"I hope," said the Rector gravely, "that He will indeed have mercy upon
  us. But we must take all human means for our safety. Put the clothes back in
  the box and you and I will take them out on to the moor and there burn them
  with fire or possibly bury them."</p>

  <p>He consulted in his own mind which was the better method, and then
  remembered that he had heard something about infected ground.</p>

  <p>"The wedding dress is worth twenty pounds, fine braid trimmings all cut
  and made with whalebone and buckram," bewailed the tailor.</p>

  <p>"Twenty pounds!" Even through his preoccupation the thought of Kate's
  extravagance went through him with a pang, but the Rector said: "I will pay
  that money. Pack up the gown." And then recalling that he should not ask
  another to do a dangerous thing that he might do himself, he said: "No, stay
  here. I will return it to the box."</p>

  <p>"Young Fulwood will do that," protested the distracted tailor. "But, sir,
  who ever heard of an illness coming in a box of clothes? And is the plague
  again in London? Did the comet bring it? And is there likely to be a judgment
  on the Peak?"</p>

  <p>"I can answer none of those questions. Let us about our business before
  the whole village is astir. Mark you, I am trusting you as an honest, brave
  man to stand by me in this."</p>

  <p>The little tailor was flattered, though still deeply disturbed. He opened
  the door into an inner room and there, carefully spread over a wooden horse,
  was the wedding gown from London. In the bright sunshine that came through
  the little back window athwart the flowers in the garden, the silk showed
  with a pearl-like lustre, the silver braids and ribbons gleamed brightly.</p>

  <p>"Harry," shouted the tailor, calling his apprentice. "Harry! Harry! Come
  here, there's work for you And quiet about it, lad."</p>

  <p>There was no answer. The tailor ran to the little staircase that twisted
  out of the closet into the sleeping-room above occupied by the
  apprentice.</p>

  <p>"He's still asleep. He was always a lazy loon," he cried, as he scrambled
  indignantly up the stairs.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson stood alone, looking at the wedding dress and thinking
  tenderly and with regret of Bessie's disappointment and Kate's chagrin.
  Perhaps he was acting foolishly, perhaps there was no danger at all. Maybe,
  even, his Kate would misunderstand him and think he had had the dress
  destroyed from malice or anger at her extravagance. Indeed, a gloom would be
  put over the whole wedding; it might be that John Corbyn would take the
  women's part and deride him for being so cautious. There would be twenty
  pounds good money gone, too&mdash;the price had seemed to him excessive. And
  then there would be the carriage from London... and no doubt the thing was
  finely cut and fitted and finished. He admitted himself that it was a
  handsome garment and that Bessie would look charming in it. She was fond of
  fine clothes, and he was sorry that this lustrous dress must be taken up and
  burnt as if it were a foul rag.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson heard a cry from the tailor; sharp and querulous, it broke
  through his musing.</p>

  <p>He went to the foot of the stairs and called up: "What's to do?"</p>

  <p>"Young Fulwood is taken ill! Come up and see, sir! Maybe he could do with
  some of your medicine."</p>

  <p>William Mompesson instantly mounted the twisting, steep stairs that spread
  fan-like from the centre post.</p>

  <p>Vickers had drawn the curtains from the small casement; the little room
  was in full morning sunlight. It was poorly but neatly furnished. On the
  truckle-bed and covered by a patchwork quilt lay the young man William
  Mompesson knew as Fulwood, the tailor's apprentice. He was pale, breathing
  heavily, his eyes glazed and half-open, his mouth pulled awry, and sweat
  thick upon his forehead.</p>

  <p>"This may be nothing," whispered the priest, keenly eyeing the sick man.
  "I will go to the Rectory and fetch some physic. Was he abroad last night in
  the revels? Did he overheat himself with food or drink?"</p>

  <p>The youth did not seem able to reply, or indeed to know that anyone was in
  the room. But the tailor, in great agitation, said that his apprentice had
  not been abroad late. He had been to the wake earlier in the day, but had
  come home before sunset, unpacked the dress, arranged it before the fire, and
  then worked a while at some of the wedding finery. Then he had gone up to his
  bed at about ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>"I have not seen him since, nay, nor heard one groan."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson approached the sick youth's bed.</p>

  <p>"How is it with you?" he asked. "What do you feel?"</p>

  <p>At this Fulwood roused himself a little and fetched a moan and muttered he
  had vomited much during the night. He felt that he had had a swelling in his
  throat and a weight in his head. After being further interrogated by the
  Rector he admitted, in a low, broken voice, that his senses were confused and
  that he could remember very little. And then he seemed to lapse into a
  sleep.</p>

  <p>"Sir, what be this?" entreated the tailor, clinging to Mr. Mompesson's
  coat, and flinching from the bed. "Is it the sweating sickness, or the
  'French Evil'?"</p>

  <p>"We are in the hands of God. You have no surgeon or physician in this
  place?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, none&mdash;save Mr. Walbeoffe who lives up at Chatsworth when
  the Earl is in residence. The barber will do bleeding and purging. Should I
  get him brandy, sir. I have some in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, better give him water. Put a ewer of water by his side. We still
  have to burn the dress."</p>

  <p>"Do you think, sir," whimpered the terrified tailor as he followed,
  stumbling, William Mompesson down the crooked stairs, "do you think this
  could have come in the wedding dress&mdash;the plague from London?"</p>

  <p>The Rector answered:</p>

  <p>"Whether it be the plague or not, it will make no difference to our
  proceedings."</p>

  <p>He took the gown off the wooden rails on which it hung. It was soft, rich
  and heavy in his hands and his quick fancy saw it&mdash;not filled out with
  the round and rosy limbs of Elizabeth Carr, but by the gleaming bones of a
  skeleton.</p>

  <p>Quietly he folded the rich gown back into the box in which it had come
  from London.</p>

  <p>He observed that the tailor stood aside while the box was being packed; he
  was already infected, if not with the plague, with fear. But when the Rector
  had finished his task, returned the wrappings to their place and knotted the
  cords, he said quietly to the tailor:</p>

  <p>"You must help me with this, it is too large for one man to carry and I do
  not want to involve others. You have already had the garment in the house and
  it can do you no further harm. Besides, it is shut away again in the box and
  it will be safe enough until it is opened."</p>

  <p>"How do we know that, sir?" asked the tailor, reasonably enough, as the
  Rector was forced to admit. "It may have infected dozens from London to
  Derby."</p>

  <p>"Did you not know," asked the Rector sadly, "that there was the plague in
  London? Could you not employ more discretion?"</p>

  <p>The man replied uneasily that he had had tales of this and that, even of
  the sickness in Derby, but nothing had ever come to Eyam. The air was too
  pure, the place too isolated. Besides, what were these invisible elements
  that could be enclosed in a box of garments and remain vital for so many
  weeks?</p>

  <p>William Mompesson could not answer this question himself. All he could
  say, was:</p>

  <p>"It has been proved that infection can travel in this manner. Yet do not
  be unduly alarmed. It may be that the lad has some other sickness. Take the
  box with me and we will carry it up to the moors. Make haste, for I would not
  attract attention, and it is early yet."</p>

  <p>Still deeply troubled, but obeying his superior without hesitation, George
  Vickers ran upstairs, completed his attire, peeped nervously in at the
  invalid, who he reported was now in a placid state and seemed asleep. He came
  down again to the parlour where William Mompesson stood thoughtfully by the
  London box.</p>

  <p>The two men took it up between them and carried it up the village street
  away from the green, the stream and the lych-gate.</p>

  <p>Some of the revellers were still abroad, most of the miners had taken a
  holiday to-day, although the wake was over. Women were sweeping doorsteps and
  shaking clothes out of windows; there was much litter about.</p>

  <p>And the Rector, before there was a chance of being observed, turned behind
  the cottages and, taking a roundabout way through the rocky dells, came out
  on the wide moor.</p>

  <p>He had taken the precaution to bring a flint and tinder from the tailor's
  shop and thought that he would burn the wedding dress on the old heathen
  altar, not only because of his inner fantasy to sacrifice this evil thing to
  evil gods, but because he feared in this dry weather to set the heath
  alight.</p>

  <p>The tailor approached this spot, marked by the two long barrows, one of
  which had been broken open, with some trepidation. He declared that around
  this place, which was considered by the inhabitants of Eyam as accursed,
  Gabriel's hounds had been heard to howl.</p>

  <p>The Rector asked sadly&mdash;what gross superstition was this?</p>

  <p>But the man replied stubbornly that the Hounds of the Archangel Gabriel
  ran across the moor howling when any disaster or the death of a notable
  person was about to take place. And he added that these infernal dogs were
  inhabited by the souls of unchristened children.</p>

  <p>"It is the wind and the loneliness that create such a fancy," said William
  Mompesson. He looked at the gray, upright stones and the flat stones in the
  centre. The spot was awe-inspiring, even to the educated, and had he not
  already resolved that it would be blasphemous for him to doubt the existence
  of devils and angels? Perhaps this simple, ignorant man beside him was in the
  right of it, perhaps hell-hounds did caper across the lonely moor?</p>

  <p>Well started on his subject now, the fearful Vickers was full of stories
  of prognostications of death; trying to remember if he had lately observed
  any that might foretell his own end.</p>

  <p>"That mound," he said, "is considered the grave of an evil man. You can
  see the pile of stones on it, sir. You know in ancient times they used to
  cast stones on the graves of wicked men as often as they passed them. And a
  great urn was found there, too, and it was hoped that it was full of
  gold."</p>

  <p>"Let that be," said the Rector, placing the box on the large plain stone
  in the midst of the upright monoliths. "There is nothing but ashes in these
  urns, and no gold. Come, strike the flint and steel and light the
  tinder."</p>

  <p>"It goes to my heart to do so," lamented the tailor, as the Rector
  unstrapped the box and cast the wedding dress out. "It is the most beautiful
  piece of work that I ever cast eyes on. And Lyons satin, worth a guinea a
  yard." He looked cautiously round him, and added in a whisper: "Here they
  come to gather May dew, which makes weak children strong. And now I think of
  it," he said, scratching his ear, "I believe that it is the plague and that
  young Fulwood will not recover. For I saw a white cricket not a fortnight
  ago, and bees sitting on a dead branch."</p>

  <p>Seeing that it was impossible to obtain any service from the distracted
  man, Mr. William Mompesson struck the flint and steel himself, and when the
  flame sprang up set light to a piece of paper and cast it down on what should
  have been Bessie Carr's wedding dress.</p>

  <p>There was a slow wind blowing that shook the tall, fine grasses and added
  to the Rector's sensitive imagination, to the intense loneliness of the
  desolate scene.</p>

  <p>Tree-covered hills enclosed the wide moor all round, the close-growing
  heather had lost its vivid bloom and was now the colour of dried blood amid
  the clusters of orange-stemmed ferns and the mossy patches set with
  harebells.</p>

  <p>The Rector wondered how long it was since the flames had burnt up on the
  sacrificial stone. The dry, crisp muslins and buckrams of the trimmings and
  stiffenings soon caught fire and, fanned by the uneasy wind that seemed to
  come from the clenched fist of God, Mompesson thought, the flames crept down
  the length of white satin, over the silver flounces and braidings.</p>

  <p>"It is money burning," cried the tailor, brought out of his fit of musing
  by the destruction of the beautiful dress. "Twenty pounds' or more worth of
  good money! And who knows if it is only for a whim or a fantasy?"</p>

  <p>"It is a necessary precaution," replied William Mompesson.</p>

  <p>The sight was to him curious and even horrible; the flames, pale in the
  sunlight, waved here and there in the delicate breeze; there were fine
  spirals of smoke against the grey upright monoliths.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson resolved to try to pray. He told the tailor to return
  home, to wash his hands and face in vinegar and to burn some cinnamon, if he
  had it, before his door and before the chamber of the sick boy. And he added
  that he would, on his return, go to the Rectory and fetch some physic or have
  it sent to Vickers's cottage. But above all, he bade the tailor keep his
  counsel and not let anyone know that there was a chance that the plague had
  come to Eyam.</p>

  <p>The man was not sorry to return to his familiar places; he was ill at ease
  on the lonely heath amidst the stones that formed the heathen temple
  dedicated to who knew what hideous devils. Nor was he greatly reassured by
  the grave, preoccupied manner of the Rector.</p>

  <p>So he turned and went quickly towards the village, looking now and then
  over his shoulder as if he indeed feared that Gabriel's Hounds might be upon
  his track. But there was no sound to mar the sweetness of the bright morning,
  save that faint rustle of the breeze in the leaves of the mountain ash, a few
  pale clouds curled up in the blue heights and cast slowly-moving shadows over
  the heath.</p>

  <p>And William Mompesson tried to pray. He raised his eyes and clasped his
  hands as the wind stirred his hair. He tried to reach his God, to find out
  what was required of him, to get into mystical communication with his Maker.
  And he prayed, too, that the plague might not come to Eyam and that those he
  loved might be spared from this and other scourges.</p>

  <p>But he was not satisfied with his prayers; for even while he cast his eyes
  upward and pressed his hands upon his breast, he had been too conscious of
  the material things about him, of the flaming wedding dress upon the
  sacrificial stone, of the light and shade across the blowing grass, of the
  wind that went past his ears with a delicate sound, of the hills that ringed
  him in, of the great emptiness that encompassed him.</p>

  <p>The wedding dress flared out. There was nothing left on the stone but a
  few charred fragments and some strips of whalebone and twisted wires.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson turned these over with his cane and waited until the
  last spark had died down, then stamped them into the ground with his feet. It
  was curious to see ashes and charred fragments on this stone: so perhaps it
  had looked a thousand years ago after a bloody sacrifice had been offered to
  a pagan god.</p>

  <p>He returned at once to the village, going quietly by the back of the
  church. It was reassuring to see the familiar gold of the linden trees, the
  familiar gray of the church tower and those stones that marked the last
  resting-place of the peaceful dead. It was reassuring to see the Rectory and
  Ann Trickett hanging out clothes under the orchard trees, and the beehives in
  the rows beneath the glistening green apples on the bough, and the dog
  barking in the sun.</p>

  <p>Why, perhaps this had all been a bother about nothing!</p>

  <p>But he remembered the sick boy...</p>

  <p>Calling Jonathan Mortin, he told him to take the gray horse, Merriman, to
  the Middleton Glen by twelve o'clock and to give it to the dissenter.</p>

  <p>"You and I infringe the law in this, Mortin," he said, "but I suppose it
  will not grieve you. It was Mistress Elizabeth's wish and her money, too, and
  where she has been charitable we must not be harsh."</p>

  <p>Mortin replied that he was very willing to do this errand, for he thought
  the dissenter a brave man and one who did much good.</p>

  <p>"More good, perhaps, than I do," smiled the Rector sadly. "He knows these
  people, he has been among them nearly twenty years and I but a few
  months."</p>

  <p>Then he went upstairs to his laboratory and glanced up at the stars,
  painted on the cloudy skies on the ceiling and then addressed himself to the
  task of preparing the physic for the tailor's apprentice.</p>

  <p>He had several books on the plague in his medical library, but he knew by
  heart some of the recipes. A decoction of rue leaves was considered a
  sovereign remedy, and there was 'Lady Kent's Powder'; the use of spices and
  pomanders was much admired. He had some of these in his drawer and he took
  them out and began to make up a packet. Then, pausing in the middle of his
  task, he went to the closet and took out a large bottle of vinegar and some
  cloths and washed and dried his hands. He had heard of people who had passed
  through an epidemic unscathed because they always kept themselves soaked in
  vinegar, even bandaging cloths wet with the acid round their heads.</p>

  <p>Sir George Savile had given him, some time ago, a tract issued by the
  College of Physicians that was full of directions and prescriptions of what
  to do in case of various illnesses. He recalled that one precaution was to
  burn fires in the streets, but there was a difference of opinion as to
  whether these should be wood or coal fires; he found the pamphlet on his
  shelf.</p>

  <p>Earnestly intent on his task, William Mompesson read through the tract
  until he came to that portion of it which dealt with the plague. There were
  many prescriptions and all of them old, being mostly those of that noted
  physician, Signor de Vigo, who had died a hundred and twenty years
  before.</p>

  <p>First, read the tract, in time of infection from this disease, it was best
  to have something to smell at, not sweet but sharp&mdash;a physic box, a
  pouncet box, and a pomander were all good. There were also plague waters that
  were considered most efficacious. Tobacco was good.</p>

  <p>And Mr. Mompesson remembered that Jack Corbyn had been chewing a plug of
  tobacco at St. Helen's Wake last night... Mention was here, too, of Goddard's
  drops.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson remembered hearing his father speak of this physician, for
  he had attended General Cromwell in the Irish and Scottish campaigns and was
  afterwards Master of a College at Oxford. Sir George Savile had told his
  chaplain that the secret of this famous drop had been sold to Charles II for
  a large sum, more than five thousand pounds. But Sir George, laughing, had
  added that this was but a roguery, for there was nothing in the recipe but a
  volatile spirit of raw silk rectified with oil of cinnamon and that the whole
  thing was no better than ordinary spirits of hartshorn.</p>

  <p>'Well, I have none of these things,' thought William Mompesson, 'but I
  have oil of cinnamon and some spices and hartshorn and I will take these
  round to the poor lad.'</p>

  <p>He began to be interested in the matter for its own sake, for he had spent
  too much time when he had been in Rufford Park in making his own experiments
  and following those of the Empirics and the Paracelsists or Chemical
  Physicians, and during his brief visit to London he had gone to St. Thomas's
  Hospital and attended a demonstration given by the great anatomist, Dr.
  Wharton.</p>

  <p>He also knew of the lectures and experiments that had been made by the
  Royal Society and their meetings at Gresham College. But now with all these
  scraps of wisdom he was but in a bewilderment and had to fall back on the
  simple remedies that were used in most households for all diseases.</p>

  <p>So he made up a case of his oils and drops and put in a pomander and left
  the house to go to the tailor's cottage.</p>

  <p>Kate and Bessie were watching from a window and saw him go out and called
  at him, and he waved up at them cheerfully. They wondered where he had been
  and asked him why he had not come to breakfast. He said that a parishioner
  was not well and required his attendance, and they were content with that,
  for he spent quite a portion of his time visiting the sick, though so far he
  had undertaken this duty without much satisfaction to himself or others.</p>

  <p>When he went to the tailor's house he found that man much composed; he
  believed that young Fulwood's illness was but slight after all, for he was
  lying placidly and showed no signs of delirium. So Mr. Mompesson gave him the
  medicine, told him to use the pomander and to burn cinnamon in the room, and
  to wash his hands frequently with vinegar and to sprinkle it on the door
  sill. If the young man showed fever, it would be better to purge and bleed
  him.</p>

  <p>"And for that you must get the barber-surgeon, and mind that he, too,
  washes his hands in vinegar and makes himself a pomander."</p>

  <p>"Still I lament the wedding dress," confessed the tailor. "What will
  Mistress Bessie be married in now, sir?"</p>

  <p>This reminded Mr. Mompesson that he had not yet told the two young women
  of the misfortune that had overtaken their finery. They would be angry with
  him, though he had better cause to be angry with them for their carelessness
  in sending for goods from London.</p>

  <p>He turned away, thoughtful, and as he went through the churchyard he
  remembered the ridiculous incident of Sythe Torre and the cow in the church.
  How all these fantasies impinged both on sober, practical truth and on
  spiritual communion with God...</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that he should have advice and support at this moment.
  If the plague was really in Eyam there were certain steps to be taken&mdash;a
  pest-house must be erected on the green, so that those who sickened might be
  kept apart from the others. Perhaps it would be well for Bessie to be married
  sooner and to leave the place, it would be but a question of hastening the
  ceremony on a few days, and although poor Kate's cooking and housewifery arts
  might be disturbed, what were those matters compared to safety from the
  plague?</p>

  <p>So he thought that the best place for him to go to would be to the old
  Manor Hall and there to speak to Mr. Corbyn, who would be Bessie's
  father-in-law.</p>

  <p>When he reached this place he found that the old man was already abroad,
  having gone to Bakewell on a matter of business about his tithes from the
  mine. But Jack was there, sitting idly in the parlour with his hands in the
  pockets of his rose-pink plush coat and his feet stretched out before him, a
  clay pipe hanging out of the corner of his pale mouth, and his yellow
  lovelock falling forlornly over his sullen eyes.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson, who had been so pleased with the behaviour of the youth
  under the reproaches of Mr. Thomas Stanley last night, was disappointed to
  see him in this indolent guise. He should surely have already been in
  attendance on Bessie...</p>

  <p>But Jack got to his feet with a good enough grace and excused himself for
  his idleness by saying that he felt sick, that he had dismal qualms in the
  stomach and an ache in his head.</p>

  <p>"It is your potations of last night, Jack," said Mr. Mompesson, "the price
  all revellers must pay for their merriment. But, sir, I have something
  important to say to you that will shake you out of this lassitude."</p>

  <p>The young man turned quickly, there was an eager look over his face.</p>

  <p>"Is it about Bessie?"</p>

  <p>"In a manner, yes. I want you to advance your wedding. I want you to be
  married to-morrow. You must take her away at once, to that house of your
  friend's outside York city, where you were planning to go till the Dower
  House was ready."</p>

  <p>"But why? That will ruin everything! What about the feast and
  entertainment? My mother and father and your wife..."</p>

  <p>"Yes," interrupted the Rector, "I know all about these preparations, but
  something has happened. A box of clothes has come to George Vickers, the
  tailor. It is possible it is infected."</p>

  <p>"With the plague?" exclaimed young Corbyn at once.</p>

  <p>"I do not know. There is no reason why we should fear it, and yet it might
  be. Young Fulwood, who works for him, is sick, and I took the clothes out and
  burnt them on the big stone on the wide moor."</p>

  <p>"The plague in Eyam," muttered Jack. He sat down flatly in the window seat
  and cast his glance on the floor; his dissolute face was livid.</p>

  <p>"You see, you must help me, by setting an example to the others. I have
  told no one else."</p>

  <p>William Mompesson proceeded to detail his visit to Vickers, the illness of
  the apprentice and how he had taken the infected clothes up to the moor and
  burnt them.</p>

  <p>"Why do you come to me about it?" demanded Jack Corbyn heavily.</p>

  <p>"I came to see your father, really, John, but as he is away, why then, I
  must speak to you. I must have all those who are in authority in Eyam on my
  side. It may be that we shall have to face an outbreak of plague here."</p>

  <p>"Surely you take matters too heavily," replied the young man. "It may be
  but an ordinary sickness."</p>

  <p>"So one must hope. Yet, Jack, you have not answered me as to whether you
  will marry Elizabeth at once and take her away to that house in Yorkshire
  where you propose to live for a while."</p>

  <p>"It will mean the altering of plans," said the young man, "and mean the
  unsettling of many people, and a great disappointment to poor Bessie herself,
  yes, and your Kate, too."</p>

  <p>The Rector had no answer to this protest, which was moderately voiced, and
  therefore more effective. Indeed, Mr. Mompesson felt himself, now that he was
  in these tranquil surroundings in the old Manor, that perhaps he had made too
  much of a trifle. And at that moment his most poignant regret was for the
  disappointment of the two young women whose finery had been burnt on the
  sacrificial stone on the moor.</p>

  <p>He seemed to see the whole thing also as something slightly ridiculous, as
  if had cut a foolish figure in his over-anxiety; he stood silent, a little
  downcast.</p>

  <p>Again young Corbyn began probing him as to what the clothes were and who
  had been foolish enough to send for dresses from London. And finally came at
  the truth, saying:</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was Bessie herself, who would not be content but must have
  the best of everything."</p>

  <p>"Well, it was Bessie&mdash;and Kate," admitted the Rector. "But we must
  not say too much about that, Jack, we do not wish to humiliate them."</p>

  <p>"Did they do it in defiance of your orders?" asked the young man, frowning
  and plucking with unsteady fingers at his soft cheek.</p>

  <p>"I cannot say that, I do not seek to give them orders. I try to keep a
  check upon their extravagance."</p>

  <p>"Ay, she's extravagant enough, Bessie. Perhaps that's what the five pounds
  went on," interrupted the young man. "The proud thing! And you thought me
  foppish!"</p>

  <p>"I must return that five pounds to you as soon as I can obtain it," said
  the Rector sternly. "I do not think it becoming in you that you should
  mention it so often. And Bessie did not require the money for clothes, but
  for an act of charity."</p>

  <p>"And who is to be charged for these London gowns that have been burnt?"
  demanded the young esquire, frowning more deeply.</p>

  <p>"That will be at my charge," replied the Rector, and he thought, with a
  pang, of how heavy the expense was&mdash;twenty pounds or more&mdash;to
  compensate Vickers and the London men.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want me to do?" Jack Corbyn stood squarely in the
  window place, his hands folded on his chest. He seemed alert now and to have
  thrown off the fumes of last night's revelry.</p>

  <p>The Rector thought: 'Surely in him I shall find a staunch friend, a
  valuable ally.'</p>

  <p>"I've told you what I want you to do, Jack, it's to marry Bessie. But
  perhaps that was unnecessary. We'll see if we have the plague in Eyam."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the young man, "supposing we do? We're high in the mountains
  here and the air's fresh, the people healthy! Why should it get a hold on us?
  There's sickness everywhere; I told you, the grass grows in some of the
  streets in Derby."</p>

  <p>"Remember that," said William Mompesson quickly, "if you feel inclined to
  blame Bessie or Kate. The plague might have been brought here in a dozen
  different ways."</p>

  <p>He would have liked to add: 'The strolling mummers could have brought it,'
  but thought this would be too unkind a cut at the young man's behaviour the
  night before.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he admitted, "I feel more reassured now than I did a few
  hours ago, when I stood by that poor lad's bedside. It may be, as you say,
  nothing. But these are my plans. If it should prove to be the plague, you,
  who have been nowhere near this sick boy and therefore cannot carry any
  infection, should go up to Chatsworth and tell my Lord, and he will make
  arrangements, possibly to send his surgeon here and certainly to keep his
  people from visiting the place."</p>

  <p>"What, you would cut us off? You would keep people from coming here?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, and others from going out," replied Mr. Mompesson. "We have no right
  to spread the infection abroad. And this will be your part, Jack. You will go
  to my Lord and explain these things to him, offer to keep your own people
  quiet."</p>

  <p>"Ay, I'll do that," replied young Corbyn, who was grave enough. "I'll ride
  over to Chatsworth this morning, and when I return you shall let me know how
  your patient progresses."</p>

  <p>At this moment, Mistress Corbyn, the young esquire's mother, entered the
  room and Jack put his finger on his lips hastily as a sign that she was not
  to be told the ill news. So the Rector passed some idle compliment with her
  and went his way.</p>

  <p>But as he picked a path through the poles, barrows, blocks of stone and
  slabs on which the wet cement lay that filled the courtyard, he glanced back
  and he saw mother and son in the window seat in what seemed close and
  agitated conversation.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' thought the Rector, trying to make excuses for Bessie's
  betrothed, 'he is telling her that he must ride unexpectedly to Chatsworth.
  But that should be a light matter and not one for such close converse. Is it
  possible that he has, after all, taken her into his confidence?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson hoped this was not so, for Mistress Corbyn, though a good
  housewife and a pleasant woman, was not one of much wit, control, or learning
  and would be likely not only to send the bad news all over the place, but to
  make panic of it, with strange, fantastic tales.</p>

  <p>Still, the Rector had to put this out of his mind. He had his own task
  before him, and it was not a pleasant one; uneasily it clouded upon him like
  a mist.</p>

  <p>He found his Kate in the still-room, where the air was heavy with mingled
  sickly perfumes from small bottles of essences and flavourings from which she
  was concocting her syrups and comfits for the wedding feast.</p>

  <p>She smiled up at him happily; it was not often she was employed in these
  hosewifery arts, for though the Rectory was finely run, that was owing to the
  care of Ann Trickett. Kate herself was too much given to be idle and to
  spending her time at her music and her embroidery. But now, under the
  excitement of her sister's marriage, she had taken an interest in these
  things, and though, as her husband tenderly guessed, it was not with very
  skilful fingers that she was making her concoctions, still she put loving
  goodwill into her task.</p>

  <p>He broached his dismal subject briskly, for he had no courage with which
  to beat around the bush.</p>

  <p>"Kate, I find that there is sickness in the tailor's house and I have
  destroyed Bessie's wedding gown."</p>

  <p>Kate had seldom heard her husband speak so sharply and she was both amazed
  and alarmed... As he went on, hurriedly, and in stern tones with his tale of
  the infected dress, she gave little heed to what he was saying. She was
  convinced that his action had been intended as a punishment for her
  frivolity, and when he came to a pause and took her hand, and said
  earnestly:</p>

  <p>"You understand, do you not, Kate?" she returned, her lips quivering, and
  her eyes flashing through tears: "No, I do not, Mompesson! I do not
  understand at all! Or rather, perhaps I understand too well, and to the
  contrary of what you have said. You are angry with me because of my
  extravagance. But I tell you that Lady Halifax would have paid for the dress,
  or Bessie, when she had her pin-money."</p>

  <p>He tried to hush her, but she was too hurt and angry and went on
  protesting and railing, while she sat down in the little kitchen chair in
  front of the still where the perfumes lay in their bottles and dishes, and
  began to weep, the dark, tumbled curls falling over her fingers as she
  pressed her face into her hands.</p>

  <p>"It's no use, Mompesson, I was never intended to be a clergyman's wife or
  to live mewed up in a place like this! I can't endure it, indeed I can't! And
  you know you anger everyone with your prim ways."</p>

  <p>"Prim?" The Rector could not forbear echoing the laugh, sad and bitter
  enough. "Why, Thomas Stanley railed at me because I was not prim enough."</p>

  <p>"I'm not clever with words," protested Kate, pulling her kerchief out of
  her bosom and dabbing her eyes, "and I want to be a dutiful wife to you,
  Mompesson. But I don't know what it is about you, since you have come to
  Eyam. But at Rufford Park we were so happy."</p>

  <p>"Ay, at Rufford Park," he said, interrupting harshly, "because we were
  both cradled in silk and too much at ease. But I can tell you, Kate, why I do
  not please you so much, nay, nor others either. It is because I am a man
  divided. I am half your husband and lover and a man of the world, half a man
  of God, unresolved, undecided."</p>

  <p>Kate sighed. She was a sweet-tempered woman and her anger was soon spent,
  always.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps my heart is hard," she murmured, "and set in vanities. And I,
  too, have behaved ill, doubtless. But if you had but let this wedding go by,
  Mompesson, if you had but let us enjoy ourselves, then indeed I should have
  been patient and put aside all worldly gear."</p>

  <p>But he interrupted again impatiently:</p>

  <p>"Kate, don't you understand? I'm not talking of the wedding festivities or
  of anything of that kind! You might have done as you would, and I should have
  paid the bills. But this dress is infected. Fulwood, the tailor's apprentice
  is ill."</p>

  <p>"How can it be from that?" she asked incredulously. "The plague's in
  London. I blame myself, I did not tell you, I did not want to disturb you and
  I thought there was no possible connection between us, and the capital. We
  knew no one there. Who would have thought," he added with heavy emphasis,
  "that from a place, though we have no acquaintance, danger would come in a
  box of finery?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it has, Mompesson," said Kate, comfortably. "The lad
  overdrank at the festival, or has the sleeping sickness, or perhaps the pox.
  And all our brave clothes lost for that!" Then, with a pathetic feminine
  curiosity that touched her husband's heart, she asked wistfully: "Tell me,
  what was the gown like, Mompesson? You know, I never saw it."</p>

  <p>"I saw but little of it myself, my dearest dear. It was hung upon a horse
  in front of the fire, which had gone out by the time I saw it. They say it
  was damp and Fulwood put it there to air. Oh, it was fair enough, curled and
  puffed and braided. A lustrous piece of work."</p>

  <p>"And lovely would Bess have looked in it," lamented Kate, beginning to
  weep again.</p>

  <p>"Peace, child," replied her husband. "If thou had'st put Bess in that
  wondrous gown thou mightest have put her in her gorgeous winding sheet."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Kate, with deep sighs, "I must even find her something else,
  and the time is short enough."</p>

  <p>"Kate, I want the time to be shorter still. I have been to the old Manor
  this morning and asked Jack Corbyn to marry Bess to-morrow. I'll have
  everything in readiness and then he can take her away to Yorkshire. If we are
  to have the plague in Eyam it is better that all who can be safe."</p>

  <p>"The plague? And Bess to be married on a day's notice? I'll believe no
  such thing! I'll have no such thing! Where's Mistress Corbyn? I'll go down
  and see her."</p>

  <p>"She is with her son. But leave this matter with me, Kate, there are
  things in which women should not meddle."</p>

  <p>"Ay, meddle's the word for us," sobbed Kate, weeping again. "And yet you
  must do what you will and we must call it Divine providence!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was," said the Rector. "Perhaps God did direct me to destroy
  the wedding gown and save all my flock."</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose it was the Devil," asked Kate, innocently, "who inspired
  me to send for the stuff from London?"</p>

  <p>The Rector had no answer for this; his faith was not to be argued out on
  these lines of feminine logic.</p>

  <p>"We'll argue no more, Kate. I have done what I have done and you know my
  desires. Go now to Bess and tell her the news." And he added mildly: quoting
  from St. John: "'If ye love me take my commandments.' Remember, that, Kate,
  as I must try to remember it, and do not dote upon this world's fancies that
  loves but the silly snares of shallow pleasure and all such vanities."</p>

  <p>She did not answer him, but with downcast head left the room, not having
  stayed to put aside her comfits, syrups, and essences. He smiled at this
  disorder, thinking how characteristic it was of Kate to show enthusiasm and
  then leave her task half-done. Yet he must blame himself for her distraction,
  for he feared that he had saddened her as she had not been saddened in her
  life before. It was difficult, as he knew, for him to realize how the women
  had counted upon this wedding and all its attendant pleasures.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE TAILOR'S APPRENTICE</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. MOMPESSON, Elizabeth and Ann Trickett, the
  serving-woman, went down the afternoon of that day to the old Manor House to
  consult with Mistress Corbyn as to the change in the plans for the
  wedding.</p>

  <p>Bessie had felt the disappointment perhaps less keenly than her sister,
  for all her thoughts were on becoming united to her darling Jack, and after
  the first pang was quickly past she was willing enough to marry her lover
  immediately and to leave Eyam with him if so willed and as originally
  planned. Though she declared that, if there were the least danger, she would
  stay with her sister.</p>

  <p>The news of young Fulwood was reassuring and the Rector nursed some hope
  that he would be made a fool of and the illness proved not to have been the
  plague. The lad lay in something between a sleep and a swoon and seemed not
  to suffer. Fumigants were burned before his bedroom door and in front of that
  of the tailor's house.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to prevent the story of the box of clothes coming from
  London from getting abroad, but George Vickers, the tailor, with a touching
  loyalty towards the Rector, gave out that the case had contained nothing but
  patterns. And he went up to young Fulwood's bed and ordered him to give the
  same tale when he recovered. But the young man did not seem to hear him, so
  sunk was he in his flaccid trance. The day was very hot and people, sick and
  sorry after the revels, moved slowly about their business.</p>

  <p>The two young women, going on foot from the Rectory to the old Manor,
  discussed this illness of young Fulwood, for indeed they could not get
  anything else in their thoughts. And what amazed them both was, not so much
  that one of the villagers had fallen sick, but that the Rector should take
  the matter so seriously.</p>

  <p>"It is those books he is always reading," pouted Kate; "you know when he
  was at Rufford Park what a time he spent in his laboratory and perusing the
  tracts of old physicians. And who knows what it has put into his head."</p>

  <p>"William is very wise," said Bess, "and probably knows far better than we
  do. And now that the dress is burnt&mdash;and really, Kate I do not mind so
  much&mdash;expect we are all free from danger. And even if poor young Fulwood
  has the plague, and even if he should die of it, what is there for the rest
  of us to grieve over? And as for the wedding, do not agitate yourself so
  much, dear Kate. We will hear what Mistress Corbyn has to say."</p>

  <p>When the ladies reached the old Manor they were surprised and even alarmed
  to find that in the early afternoon Jack Corbyn had ridden away, not saying
  where he was going, and had been followed immediately afterwards by Mistress
  Corbyn, who had gone riding pillion behind a manservant. Several of the other
  servants were under orders to follow them; no explanation had been given to
  those that remained, save that instructions would arrive in a day or so.</p>

  <p>Good breeding saved Mrs. Mompesson and Bess from showing their dismay.
  They stood among the blocks of masonry and watched the workmen moving
  leisurely in the golden sunlight, planing wood, mixing mortar, chipping
  stones to embellish the rebuilding of the Manor.</p>

  <p>Then, followed by Ann Trickett, they moved aside and crossed the Hall yard
  and paused by the fish-pond where William Mompesson had talked to Jack
  Corbyn.</p>

  <p>Then Bessie said faintly:</p>

  <p>"Why should he go away, hurriedly, like that, and the wedding but a week
  off?"</p>

  <p>"It's worse than that," whispered Kate. "Mompesson told him this morning
  that he would like to have it in twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>Fear, like a quickly moving shadow, fell over the spirits of the two young
  women, even the bright sunshine about them seemed chilled.</p>

  <p>"He will have sent a message to the Rectory," said Kate, pressing her
  sister's hand. "Mompesson asked him to go to Chatsworth. These stupid
  servants have misunderstood. Jack has gone there, of course."</p>

  <p>"But his mother? Why should his mother go? And his father has not
  returned. Did they send a messenger warning him to keep away?"</p>

  <p>"Fie, Bess, we should not think of such things."</p>

  <p>In silence the two young women left the Manor garden and returned to the
  Rectory. There was no message there from the young esquire.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson could not believe this news. He thought, as Kate
  thought, that there must have been some mistake, and he himself went down to
  the old Manor and sharply examined the servants. But the story was always the
  same. And so, in suspense and anxiety, three days went by, like a lull before
  the approach of storm shadows.</p>

  <p>Kate bravely continued her preparations for the festival and Bess allowed
  her sister to alter one of her gowns into the semblance of a wedding garment,
  trimming the pale silk foundation with gold and silver lace, fashioning a
  deep falling collar for the shoulders; while Mompesson went over himself to
  Chatsworth and waited upon my Lord. And then he discovered that none of the
  Corbyns had been there, but there was news of them travelling towards
  Yorkshire to the house of that friend where Jack should have spent the first
  week of his married life.</p>

  <p>These things were by no means to be concealed in a small village. A
  sadness fell over the little place, which had been so full of high spirits
  during St. Helen's Wake.</p>

  <p>When the Sunday came there were a large number in the church and a
  different reverence paid to the Rector's brief sermon, which he spoke on a
  text appropriate to such a mountainous district:</p>

  <p>'I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
  strength.'</p>

  <p>That sweet Sunday afternoon he had to officiate at the burial of an infant
  that he had but lately christened, in the churchyard under the golden linden
  trees, and an unusually large crowd gathered and they were very quiet. Mr.
  William Mompesson supposed that they were pitying him and his Kate and
  Bessie, who seemed to have been forsaken but a few days before her wedding,
  and scorning the false lover who had seemed to show a blackness of heart.</p>

  <p>He could not believe this, but thought that some message had gone astray
  and that Jack Corbyn would return. It was possible that he had gone to fetch
  physics and doctors from Derby, but though the Rector tried to keep this in
  his mind as a probability, he knew it was fantastic. Jack Corbyn could have
  helped in more immediate ways, and there were doctors and physic enough
  nearer than Derby, at Bakewell, for example, or Buxton.</p>

  <p>Neither this matter nor that of the plague was spoken about at the
  Rectory.</p>

  <p>When the funeral service was over, William Mompesson went towards the
  tailor's house. He had visited the young man twice every day, since he had
  fallen sick, and never seen any change in him, save one evening when he
  seemed in a mild delirium and had talked foolishly about his work, making a
  movement of his hands as if snipping with the scissors or stitching with the
  needle.</p>

  <p>It was a peerless evening; gold and blue and tranquil, the spendthrift sun
  scattered largesse everywhere. Despite his grave cares and wonder, the Rector
  felt his spirits lifted into some divine contentment that was beyond his
  immediate circumstance.</p>

  <p>When he entered the little shop, he found George Vickers, as he had bid
  him do, smoking, for it was well known that tobacco helped to keep contagion
  away, and with the bowl of spices smouldering in the window so that the low
  room was full of bluish smoke.</p>

  <p>"He is better this afternoon, sir&mdash;the lad," said the tailor
  cheerfully, "and I think, after all, I shall not send for his parents. He was
  sitting up and speaking cheerfully before noon, soon after your visit."</p>

  <p>The Rector stood silent, but his slender fingers gripped closely on the
  silver-bound Prayer Book that he held and his whole spirit seemed to be
  stilled into an ecstasy of thanksgiving. This dark shadow, then, was to pass
  away. And what a lesson it would have taught him! There would be no more
  repining, no more idleness, no more nice disdain of these rude people among
  whom he had been sent.</p>

  <p>"You give me," he breathed at last, "very good news. I will see the boy
  and join with him in thanksgiving."</p>

  <p>And he went quickly up the small, winding stairs to the apprentice's
  bedroom. The pure golden light came in at the low-set window beneath the
  slanting ceiling and fell over the young man who lay half-stripped upon his
  truckle bed, the patchwork quilt twisted under him.</p>

  <p>'Doubtless he is asleep.'</p>

  <p>The Rector approached. But young Fulwood was too still, his face too
  clay-coloured for sleep; there were patches on his neck, his mouth was
  dragged.</p>

  <p>The Rector felt his joyous relief vanish like sunshine before a
  storm-cloud, his soul, like the tempest-smitten landscape, was suddenly dark
  and bleak; the boy was dead and in an agony.</p>

  <p>Mompesson took first the coverlet and the blanket between his fingers and
  pulled them down. Then he opened the shirt the young man wore; the young body
  that had been so lately firm and fresh was livid, and on the thighs and legs
  and on the chest showed large blains, puffing up the skin, a sure 'token' of
  the plague.</p>

  <p>Without a change in his face, save a light twitching of his brow and lips,
  the Rector performed those offices that he had performed so often before,
  when he had attended the poor tenants of Sir George Savile's estates. He
  closed the dim, staring eyes, he crossed the hands over the breast, he
  composed the drawn up limbs, marking the loathsome disfigurements the while
  and then he drew the sheet over the corpse and prayed beside it; the sun was
  hot on him and the body stank.</p>

  <p>Then he rose and, looking at the outline beneath the coarse sheet, he
  murmured: "But go thou thy way till the end be, for thou shalt rest, and
  stand in thy lot, at the end of the days."</p>

  <p>Then the priest went downstairs and said to George Vickers, who was seated
  comfortably by the door taking his rest on the Lord's Day:</p>

  <p>"It is the plague. The youth is dead, and on him are the spots that the
  physicians term the buboes."</p>

  <p>"The plague!" whispered the tailor. "Then I am a dead man, too, sir!"</p>

  <p>"It does not follow," replied the Rector firmly. "Thou art no more a dead
  man than I am or any other in this place. Now take heed to thy ways, Vickers,
  obey me, and we may yet stay the disease to this one case. I will go up to my
  laboratory and see what I have there in the way of fumigants and medicine
  that might be preventive. And I will come back here and put this lad in the
  coffin myself."</p>

  <p>"Nay, sir, I shall help you," said Vickers coolly, losing his fear now the
  test had arrived. "I have no more fear than you."</p>

  <p>"You may help me if you will. There should be a coffin ready, there was
  one made for old Riley, of the Dale, who was to be buried on Tuesday. Go to
  the carpenter and ask for that."</p>

  <p>"To get it I must tell him the whole story, sir."</p>

  <p>"We cannot keep the story secret, but must put all on their mettle to
  behave bravely. If you treat them as brave men you will make them so."</p>

  <p>William Mompesson shut himself in his laboratory that sunny afternoon, and
  when Kate tapped on the door he told her he would take no supper, that he had
  urgent business afoot.</p>

  <p>He studied the medical tracts that he had once again, and looked over his
  stores of physic. Then he made up a compound to serve as a powerful fumigant
  and set it in a brazier and burned it at the door of his laboratory so that
  the fumes went all over the house.</p>

  <p>When the family supper was over he came down and read the prayers as
  usual. And when they were over he asked his household to remain; there was
  his wife and Bessie, the two little children, Ann Trickett, Jonathan Mortin
  and three other servants, a maid, a gardener, a groom.</p>

  <p>To them the Rector told the story of how the plague had come to Eyam, that
  no one was to blame for it, and there might be no ill consequences if
  precautions were taken.</p>

  <p>"For," said he, "just as these things come in a mysterious way, so in a
  mysterious way they may be prevented. Nay, I use the word mysterious, but so
  it is not. It is only our ignorance, which is clouded and blinded and may not
  understand these things."</p>

  <p>And he told them how he was going down himself that evening to put the
  young man in his coffin. He must be buried that night.</p>

  <p>"George Vickers, the tailor, who is a brave man, and the sexton will carry
  the coffin the short distance to the churchyard, and there must be no one
  present save myself, and it is my duty to be there. God," added the Rector,
  with a firmer note in his voice, "protects those who do their duty."</p>

  <p>This speech was received in dutiful silence. The only sign of alarm that
  he had observed, for he was watching them closely, was the quick looks that
  all the women had given the two children, who were kneeling on their little
  cushions in front of the other worshippers, Kate supporting the little girl
  and Ann Trickett keeping the restless boy in his place.</p>

  <p>When all but Kate and Bess had gone, Ann Trickett taking the two children
  away to their beds, Mrs. Mompesson broke out:</p>

  <p>"This is a horrible thing! You run a grave risk and I should like to come
  with you. I am not afraid of dead bodies, nor of the plague."</p>

  <p>"I well believe this, Kate, that you are afraid of nothing, but you must
  obey me without question. I stand in no danger." And to comfort her he added:
  "I know a good, nay, a certain preventive for the plague."</p>

  <p>Then Bessie, who had been standing silent, half leaning against one of the
  heavy dining chairs, said:</p>

  <p>"But what of Jack? Is there no word from him? And why did he leave
  me?"</p>

  <p>These questions had been in the hearts if not on the lips of all of them
  for the last four days, but the Rector could not answer them now.</p>

  <p>"Surely you will hear from him soon, Bessie. He could not have left you
  willingly. Something must have gone astray."</p>

  <p>"No," said Elizabeth Carr, with a bitter little smile, which wiped all the
  youth from her face and made her seem older than her married sister, "you may
  stop your preparations for the wedding, Kate, and you, sir, may announce in
  the church that it will not take place. For even if Jack should return now,
  save he had a very good explanation, I would not have this wedding go
  forward."</p>

  <p>"Hush, hush, Bess," said Kate, taking hold of her and clasping her tight,
  "you must not speak thus. And we must think of it neither; remember only that
  the plague has come to Eyam and that we must stand by our posts and see how
  we can help."</p>

  <p>But that night, when Mr. Mompesson had gone to the tailor's shop and was
  helping George Vickers to put the body of an apprentice into the coffin that
  had been made for another, a horseman came to Eyam and riding to the Rectory
  delivered a package to Bessie. It was from Madam Corbyn and sent from a house
  in Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>It said that the Corbyns had been called away by the sudden illness of a
  relative, an old uncle from whom they had great expectations, the very man
  who was to have lent his house to Bessie and Jack. Although the wedding had
  been so near 'it behoved them,' the good lady wrote, 'to go at once.' And lo
  and behold! they had come into the house when the old man had recovered and
  Jack himself had been taken ill. Now, this illness was but a slight thing and
  Bessie was by no means to be disturbed. Still less was she to think of trying
  to come and nurse him. The worst was over, but Jack was still weak and was
  not likely to leave his bed for several days yet. Therefore, Madam Corbyn
  begged the postponement of the wedding. In a short while further news would
  be sent, and in a short while more Jack would return to claim his
  beloved.</p>

  <p>This letter arrived on the sixth day after the departure of Jack Corbyn
  from the old Manor House, and when Kate Mompesson questioned the messenger,
  after he had been refreshed in the Rectory, she found that the place he had
  come from was no more than a good day's riding.</p>

  <p>"So," said Bessie sharply, "allowing that it took Jack a day to get there,
  and this man a day to return with his letter, that allows four days for him
  to fall into a bad illness, to recover, and to lie languid."</p>

  <p>Kate questioned the messenger as to the state of his young master. But the
  fellow was a stranger, one from the Yorkshire household, and seemed wary in
  his replies. And the women thought that he had been told what to say. He
  could only assure the ladies that young Esquire Corbyn had been ill and abed.
  But he added that he did not think the illness was of much gravity, since he
  had seen him at his chamber window, fully clothed, and playing with some
  pigeons on the sill.</p>

  <p>When the man had gone, the sisters turned into each other's arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Kate! Oh, Bessie! What are we to think?"</p>

  <p>Not until this moment did Bessie Carr realize how strong her hope had been
  that there might be some credible explanation for her lover's behaviour,
  since she had loved him so utterly. All her heart had been set upon her
  approaching marriage and the long vista of happiness behind it. She could not
  believe that all had been a deception; she could not believe it now.</p>

  <p>With trembling hands she took Madam Corbyn's letter and read it over and
  over again.</p>

  <p>Then she was for setting out at once and taking the twelve hours' ride to
  the Yorkshire house, but Kate restrained her, telling her that it was not in
  womanly dignity nor maidenly honour to do such a thing. But poor Bessie was
  impatient and declared that nothing mattered but her love for Jack and she
  would go.</p>

  <p>And into the middle of this agonized scene the Rector returned, not
  breaking in upon the women who were closeted in Kate's chamber, but they
  heard his steps go past as he went straight into his laboratory, only on his
  way calling out to Ann Trickett to bring him ewers of fresh water and clean
  cloths.</p>

  <p>He had attended the funeral of young Fulwood, he had helped put the body
  in the coffin and had noted that it was already putrid and the stench had
  been such as to overcome the perfumes from the fumigations and from the burnt
  vinegar.</p>

  <p>So, on the seventh day of September the first victim of the plague in Eyam
  was buried. And within a week George Vickers was dead, and the woman who came
  in to do his work, and the children of the cobbler who lived next
  door&mdash;two little girls.</p>

  <p>The Rector watched by the death-beds of all of them and helped put them
  into their coffins and carry them to the churchyard.</p>

  <p>Then the terrible alarm died down, for it seemed as if the disease was
  stayed. For fifteen days passed, then Edward Cooper died. Then there was a
  month and more until October the twenty-eighth, when Jonathan Cooper, his
  brother, died, and the plague had spread into six other families, of which
  twenty-five had died; two named Halksworth, six Thorpes, six Sydalls, four
  Bands, four Torres and three Ragges.</p>

  <p>So, from the death of young Fulwood until the end of October, twenty-nine
  had perished.</p>

  <p>Now, up to this time, none had known with perfect certainty, save the
  Rector, that this disease was the plague, for some had had no tokens upon
  them at all and others were very young children or very old people, such as
  might have been supposed to die naturally. But though the villagers had
  become fearful over so many deaths, the word 'plague' had not gone round
  Eyam, and the household of the Rector was loyal and none breathed a word.</p>

  <p>But by November some travelling from Derbyshire heard the tale of this
  illness, and the symptoms described, and said roundly that it was the plague
  and had gone away again immediately. And when the doctor from Chatsworth had
  been asked to his face what this disease was, he admitted that it was the
  plague.</p>

  <p>Yet, even as this terror came to the inhabitants of Eyam there was some
  relief, for there were but three deaths during November, and with December
  came a sharp frost that seemed to stay the infection.</p>

  <p>Though there was so much desolation in the little place, so many families
  being in mourning, still the villagers' spirits soon recovered, because there
  was no more than the usual amount of illness during December and the plague
  tokens were not found upon any that died during that month. And everywhere
  the villagers manifested joy to think they had been saved from the terrible
  scourge with the loss of only thirty-one persons who, young and old, lay
  buried in the churchyard close together under the linden trees.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the height of the malignant destruction had passed and that
  they might now consider themselves safe, and Mr. Mompesson and his wife
  believed that their anxiety and their toil were now at an end with the
  melancholy clouds and whistling winds of winter.</p>

  <p>The sharp frosts, the severe snowstorms fell like a purification on the
  mountain village and passes; the Rector, the sexton, the constable and two
  men sent from Chatsworth by my Lord went down to the barracks or pest-house
  that had been built upon the green and took out all the bedding and materials
  used for the sick people and burned them between the falls of snow that
  blotted out the hills.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson had observed that those who lived in the better, western
  part of the village beyond the stream that divided Eyam and the lych-gate had
  not been visited by the infection at all, and he wondered if the stream had
  not served to check the disease, acting as a barrier to the infection.</p>

  <p>These months had passed for him very quickly, for he had been concentrated
  on his labours, on much watching and praying, but that had not prevented him
  from giving a sharp attention to the affairs of Elizabeth. She had refused to
  allow him to interfere between herself and Jack Corbyn. Letters came from
  Yorkshire, but always the young man, though in no danger and on the mend, was
  languid and could not travel and the marriage had been postponed until the
  spring.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson noticed that all the work on the old Manor was suspended,
  the servants had been withdrawn, the house was shut up and the man who farmed
  the land knew nothing of the doings of the Squire and his son.</p>

  <p>'It is well,' said the Rector to himself in deep anger, 'that if he be
  that manner of man who would forsake his bride because of fear of a disease,
  that Bessie is free from him.'</p>

  <p>This was but a hollow consolation, for he had seen how the girl, though
  brave and silent, pined. And it was hardly to be endured to watch the women
  putting away quietly all the preparations for the wedding festivities and
  locking apart the clothes and giving to the poor the cakes, the jellies and
  the comfits.</p>

  <p>But William Mompesson thought: 'When the plague is over, I shall deal with
  Jack Corbyn.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; GOD'S TRUCE WITH DUST</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Peak district was still covered with thick snow, the
  frosts were heavy at night and lay white in all pockets and hollows on the
  moorlands. But the streams were relieved from the ice and began to flow
  freely through the stiff mosses and dead grasses; here and there was a
  celandine or the bright blades of a strong lusty weed. The firs showed pale
  tips at the ends of their blue-black winter boughs, and on the thorn-trees
  and larches in the dells was a faint bloom of bud. The plague was over and
  spring returning to the mountains.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Carr went on foot alone across the heath beyond Middleton Dale.
  The air was still sharp and the bright sky colourless above the snow-streaked
  hills. The girl kept her woollen hood pulled over her face and her mantle
  wrapped tightly across her bosom. Light was receding from the air and an
  arrow-shaped flight of birds above her head was speeding homewards.</p>

  <p>As she entered the dell, so different now from what it appeared in its
  summer splendour, with the bare trees and limestone rocks and sandstone
  hollows showing, and the broken flags and tarnished weeds of last year, she
  paused and looked round her apprehensively.</p>

  <p>She felt as she looked&mdash;small, lonely and helpless in the wide
  majestic landscape.</p>

  <p>And when a man, who had been seated on one of the boulders near a grove of
  ash at the top of the dell, moved forward, so that his figure was outlined
  against the sky, she gave a little sob of alarm. But it was instantly checked
  as she saw that the tall elegant figure in the gray coat was her
  brother-in-law. She waited proudly defiant as he came down the side of the
  dell.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth, you have been out alone? Did I not ask you always to go
  attended? This place is wild, the inhabitants savage. Besides,' he added
  sadly, "I think I know your errand."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth began to excuse herself nervously as they walked slowly by
  reason of the uneven ground and the breaking rills of water between the
  smooth boulders through the dell.</p>

  <p>"I have not been far, only a little way across the heath. And I am by now
  so familiar with the place. The people may be savage, but they are honest,
  too. I do not think anyone would hurt me. I often pass the miners going to
  and from their work and they salute me courteously."</p>

  <p>"Still, I would not have you go, Bessie. I believe you go with Kate's
  connivance, but you are too loyal to tell me that."</p>

  <p>She did not answer, and with increased pity and tenderness he
  continued.</p>

  <p>"I wish that you and Kate understood how much I sympathized with you and
  how little desire I have to be hard with you. But, Bessie, where you go is to
  old Mother Sydall, is it not? The wise woman, as they call her, who lives in
  a hut on the moor."</p>

  <p>"I went there last autumn," said Bessie, in a low voice, "to get some
  amulets against the plague. We all had one&mdash;Kate, myself, the children,
  and Ann Trickett."</p>

  <p>"I knew as much," replied the Rector. "I took them from Kate and the
  children once, but I suppose you fetched others?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How little you trust me, Bessie! Did you not think that I could have
  given you something that would have been as useful to you? Must you believe
  in these silly practices?"</p>

  <p>The girl stood her ground.</p>

  <p>"If one must believe in demons and angels, why not in witches?" she asked.
  "This is a good old woman, and may not God use her as an instrument?"</p>

  <p>"God bids us use our wits," replied the Rector. "And I do not like these
  arguments, Bessie. These old women are ignorant, if well-meaning, and do more
  harm than good. But why do you visit her now? The plague, God be praised, has
  left Eyam."</p>

  <p>Bessie did not answer and her brother-in-law continued to press her,
  gently but with authority. When they had almost reached the end of the glen,
  the girl stopped and looked earnestly up at the Rector.</p>

  <p>She had changed since the days of her bright lustre when she had been
  preparing for her wedding. William Mompesson knew that Bessie was brave and
  also that she suffered much from her private grief at the absence of her
  lover and from the public plague for which, for all her brother-in-law could
  say, she held herself responsible. As both the tailor and his assistant were
  dead and there were no others that knew precisely the story of the box of
  clothes, save Jack Corbyn who had not returned to Eyam, the Rector had kept
  it quiet and not mentioned to anyone what he believed to be the truth, that
  the plague had come in the box of clothes from London.</p>

  <p>But he knew if he had expressed his opinion not only would Bessie and Kate
  have been scorned for their disobedience and vanity, but the two young women
  would hardly have been able to endure their remorse. Therefore he had spread
  it about, and even told his wife and sister-in-law, that he thought the
  plague had come with some of the people who visited St. Helen's Wake, been
  brought from Derby, perhaps by the mummers, perhaps by one of the quacks or
  strolling traders.</p>

  <p>But Kate could never forget that he had told her the plague had come in
  the clothes, though he had tried to efface that impression, saying that he
  was mistaken, for he could not endure that these two innocent creatures
  should have the deaths of thirty-one people at their count, though in his
  heart he believed that they had been the one and only cause of the arrival of
  the infection in the mountain village.</p>

  <p>He thought that Bessie was going to speak of this matter now and try, as
  she had tried before, to clear herself before her own conscience by finding
  out from him his real opinion of the source of the infection in Eyam.</p>

  <p>But instead she said:</p>

  <p>"Sir, I have been obedient to you in everything; you have the ordering of
  my actions, the handling of my poor fortune, I live in your house and am
  subservient to you, but some liberty I must have."</p>

  <p>"Why, Bess, I hope that thou hast all the liberty that thou need'st?"</p>

  <p>"I must have this," added the girl anxiously, "to go abroad a little, even
  to visit this old woman if I will."</p>

  <p>"But what do you visit her for, Bessie? Two or three times in the last
  month I have asked for you and Kate has been forced to tell me that you were
  on this heath, and I have had to come and meet you."</p>

  <p>"You need not fear for me," she said earnestly, "I think I am
  protected."</p>

  <p>He was a little abashed because her faith was greater than his own, for he
  was by no means confident where Bessie or Kate were concerned, he knew the
  miners were rough, savage people, and in particular he dreaded Sythe Torre,
  who had once, not so many months ago, made a half-confession to him of being
  a murderer and whose lewd and cruel disposition was well known. Suppose he
  was straying on the heath when Bessie made her piteous errand? And if he only
  frightened the girl? Why, it was not to be thought of...</p>

  <p>So the Rector said:</p>

  <p>"Bessie, we have had a sad winter but the spring comes now. See, even the
  poor wayside herbs lift up their heads and grow green again? And I am assured
  that Jack Corbyn will return and we shall have our wedding after all, with a
  deeper rejoicing that the scourge has come and gone."</p>

  <p>"Will Jack return?" asked Bessie eagerly, putting back the loose dark hair
  that the wind blew inside her hood from her face. "Will he?"</p>

  <p>"He writes to you, doesn't he, Bess? And they are the letters of a
  lover?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, but there are always excuses&mdash;his father has lost much money and
  therefore they cannot reside at the Manor, he has been sick and his mother
  has been sick, the uncle with whom they live is whimsical and will have him
  close. Oh! sir, I greatly fear I have lost his love."</p>

  <p>"It is true that he is but a cold lover," said the Rector, taking Bessie's
  hand through his arm as they went on their way towards the village, "and it
  would be better if you could put him out of your heart. But if that may not
  be... Bessie, before we come to the first cottages, tell me this&mdash;I
  would rather ask these questions in the open air than in the Rectory. I have
  not spoken of this matter, even to Kate, but I ask you now&mdash;do you go to
  the old woman to buy love philtres and charms?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer but he saw her delicate face harden, her lips quiver,
  and he knew it was useless to question further that frail obstinacy. No doubt
  she had been near to Hell these last months since her broken wedding, and he
  would not for that have her slip into folly. So he argued with her tenderly,
  yet with a touch of authority, telling her that she might cause great
  mischief by dabbling in drugs and charms, of the virtues and strengths of
  which she knew nothing. Not by magic would love be forced. If her lover had
  for any reason forsaken her, nothing could bring him back save her own
  loyalty and constancy. And in the end the Rector gave the advice, knowing
  well how useless it was, that Jack Corbyn was hardly worth the wearying for
  and that one so sweet and fair and gently bred as herself would find in time
  a better mate.</p>

  <p>Bessie did not answer, neither did she weep William Mompesson had noticed
  before that her tears did not come as easily as Kate's; she had a curious
  inner strength of character.</p>

  <p>She thanked him for his care and withdrew her hand from his arm and they
  walked side by side and suddenly estranged down the winding village street,
  through the larger houses at the western end, from which many of the
  inhabitants had fled last autumn and where they had now all returned, through
  the lych-gate, where the villagers stood on duty ready for the night watch,
  and so past the green and <i>The Bull</i>, the churchyard with the bare
  linden trees and the Rectory.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson found his wife in the parlour that looked upon the gray,
  bare orchard. She was giving her elder child a lesson out of a horn-book, but
  when her husband came in she sent the boy away.</p>

  <p>The Rector stood leaning against the tapestried walls close to her and
  spoke to her, reluctantly, about Bessie and her visits to old Mother
  Sydall... No harm in the thing, but it was a folly, and yet it should not be
  countenanced. Not only was it ill for herself, but in the effects it might
  have on the villagers to whom it might give but an odious example.</p>

  <p>"They are sunk enough in crafts and superstitions and I know not what
  black ignorance, already," said the Rector.</p>

  <p>Catherine stopped him, saying almost in the words that Bessie had
  used:</p>

  <p>"But you teach us to believe in angels and devils, how are we to know what
  is true and what is not, Mompesson? If we are not to believe in the baying of
  Gabriel's Hounds, how are we to believe in guardian angels?"</p>

  <p>"Woman," he answered sadly, "you must not argue with me on these points.
  Both as your husband and as your priest, I must be your guide. I tell you,
  you and I and Bessie are but one dusty story, these follies will live after
  us as an ill example. See that Bessie goes no more upon the moors. I have no
  time to spend following her or meeting her in the dells, covering up her
  foolishness."</p>

  <p>"I cannot control Bessie," smiled Kate quietly, "her heart has been almost
  broken since John Corbyn went away, since we had the plague in Eyam. What do
  you think life has been for her, or for me? We have done what we could to
  help."</p>

  <p>"You have done very nobly," replied the Rector, "I have no reproofs to
  make there. And well do I know your grief and disappointment. But, Kate, how
  is it that this has not brought us all nearer together, instead of sending
  us, as I think, farther apart?"</p>

  <p>"There has been the cloud of death upon the village and upon this house,"
  replied his wife, and her pretty lips trembled piteously.</p>

  <p>"That is over, Kate, and we should lift up our hearts But something is
  wrong, and I think the fault must be mine. I feel it in my parishioners, too.
  This trouble has not brought us nearer, though I have worked hard for them
  and they seemed grateful I think it is because I cannot discern where the
  hand of God moves."</p>

  <p>"That may well be a mystery," said Kate bitterly. "Why should God send
  death in that wedding dress?"</p>

  <p>"Kate, I have not said He did, I do not know from whence the plague
  came."</p>

  <p>"You said so, once, though you've tried to take it back. Why should God
  send death in the wedding dress, to kill those innocent people?"</p>

  <p>"We do not know, Kate. You must not question His wisdom. Let be."</p>

  <p>Catherine Mompesson raised her tired eyes and looked at her husband with
  deep love, but it was the love that gazes across a gulf. They had been
  separated, if not estranged, during the tribulations of the winter, Bessie's
  distress and the public calamity; and though she had stood by his side and
  worked with him, still in some things they had been divided. And she could
  not, any more than he, put a name to this division.</p>

  <p>He looked now at his own features in the tortoiseshell mirror, as if he
  expected to see a great change there. But the trouble that had marked the
  sensitive delicacy of Kate's and Bessie's features had not marred his own
  comeliness. The face that looked back at him did not seem to his own
  consideration that of a priest, though it was sad, grave and serene. The
  features were too worldly handsome, the expression too aloof; there was too
  much cool pride in the brow, too much haughty self-containment in the set of
  the lips. Sloth was on his spirit and lethargy on his lips.</p>

  <p>'What are we?' he thought, staring into the mirror, 'but God's truce with
  dust?'</p>

  <p>And it was in his mind then to write to Sir George Savile and tell him
  that he was not fitted to have the cure of souls, that he would return to
  some humbler post&mdash;not the gilded idleness of chaplain in the great
  man's house, but some small cure where he might work under some holy man and
  not be what he was not fitted to be&mdash;his own master.</p>

  <p>But even as the thought came into his mind it was checked by another, and
  a worldly one. He had no means to support Kate and Bessie and his children,
  if he had a meaner living than Eyam. He had already deprived them of worldly
  pleasures and comforts by bringing them to this solitary place. Should he,
  for the sake of his own spiritual peace, condemn them to more hardships?</p>

  <p>He put his hand into the thick chestnut curls that hung damp on his brow
  (for he still, as he went constantly among the sick, kept his forehead bathed
  with vinegar), and turned and made a movement to his Kate as if he would
  invite her into his arms. But she did not look up and he stood mute and
  sated, his eyes gazing at her delicate face, the long throat, the pure lips
  now only faintly coloured, the large dark eyes shadowed beneath.</p>

  <p>Then he made an effort to overcome his spirits and said:</p>

  <p>"Kate, I saw the flowers and the mosses and the herbs springing green
  to-day. Spring is coming, even in this isolated place, even on the
  mountain."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," she said, "the spring! But I do not think anything will be the
  same again."</p>

  <p>Bessie Carr sat in her sweet self-privacy, handling her lover's letters.
  About once a month a messenger came from Yorkshire with a missive from Jack
  Corbyn for her. There was not much in these short epistles, but they were
  sufficient for her love and loyalty to feed upon. Through all her cloudy
  doubts and fears she clung to these few lines, reading them often, carrying
  them, sewn into a silk cover, placing them under her pillow at night.</p>

  <p>She wrote to him, but out of delicacy no more frequently than he wrote to
  her, and always over her letters she said the charm that had been taught her
  by Mother Sydall and then held them over a pan of smouldering fumigants so
  that there might be no danger that the plague or any other illness would
  touch her lover.</p>

  <p>He spoke now of returning, he thought his affairs were something settled,
  that work might begin again upon the Manor Hall, and that they might be
  married about Eastertide.</p>

  <p>Her lover's desertion and the illness that she still blamed herself for
  having brought into the village had much changed Bessie. She was no longer
  laughing, frivolous and careless, but grave, attentive to her duties, dressed
  soberly and often sitting alone with a book of devotion or walking in the
  outskirts of the village, where the waters headlong and loose fell over the
  boulders, or on the heath and moors by the ancient altar, where her wedding
  gown had been burned last September.</p>

  <p>This evening she went on her knees by her simple bed and gave thanks to
  God for removing the plague from Eyam, and then, something soothed but still
  restless, she thought she would do as she so often did&mdash;go abroad and
  walk through the village streets enquiring at the houses where there were
  still people recovering from illness, or old folk, or little children, if she
  could be of any service to them. These errands completed, she would walk
  around by the Hall yard and the old Manor and look at the house, where she
  had hoped to live as mistress, where perhaps she might yet live happily with
  John Corbyn. Even her brother-in-law could have no objection to this amount
  of liberty.</p>

  <p>So she went downstairs and passed the parlour, where was Kate with Ann
  Trickett and the children, and the study where the Rector was enclosed, and
  came out by the churchyard walls and the bare linden trees, made her way
  round the village and back again to the Manor Hall.</p>

  <p>She passed inside the gates and went to the fishpond and looked about her.
  No one slept in the half-demolished partly rebuilt house, though some servant
  came in the daytime to set all in order. The snow was now quite gone from the
  valleys and the low-lying places and remained only in patches on the hills.
  The air was still sharp and the new moon was like a chip of crystal hanging
  above the high chimney-pots of the ancient house.</p>

  <p>And as Bessie, a small figure in her modest cloak and hood, gazed at Jack
  Corbyn's home, she saw lights in one of the upper rooms. The sight of this
  gave her an unutterable pang that another should have the right to be there
  and she not at all. Then a wild hope sprang up as she saw a large shadow pass
  in front of the light. She went round to the stable and found a horse there,
  newly rubbed down, feeding from the manger, while his harness hung from its
  place. Only one thought and one action were then possible for Bessie Carr.
  She ran round to the front door of the house and knocked at the door.</p>

  <p>It was Jack Corbyn who opened to her and his greeting was such as she most
  dearly hoped for.</p>

  <p>"Bess!" he cried. "My dearest dear!" And took her in his arms and drew her
  inside the house.</p>

  <p>They clung together for a moment, kissing and speaking incoherently.</p>

  <p>"How did you know I was here?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you not tell me you were coming? What chance brought you? Are you
  alone?"</p>

  <p>Till they both laughed.</p>

  <p>"We perplex one another with questions," he laughed. "They have lit me a
  fire in the large parlour, come in there and I will talk to you."</p>

  <p>The fire was burning brightly on the wide hearth beneath the overmantel
  carved with the arms of the Corbyns, the crowned birds and the motto.</p>

  <p>Jack drew Bessie down on the old oak settle and told her she had not
  changed a whit for all her waiting and her misfortune and the horror of the
  plague. And that was true enough while he said the words, for joy had sent a
  lovely flush over the girl's face, given a sparkle to her eyes, and a lustre
  to her whole person so that she was radiant.</p>

  <p>How could she have doubted him? All her suspicions were gone like cobwebs
  swept away by a strong, impatient hand.</p>

  <p>He explained himself, gaily and easily, putting the blame on his parents,
  on his old uncle, on the loss of money, on this and that, till by the time
  that he was finished talking, Bessie was persuaded that she had no grief at
  all, that she was foolish to have even given a thought to this long
  postponement of her wedding day.</p>

  <p>"Everything shall be as it was. My uncle is dead and I have come into four
  thousand pounds. We will continue with rebuilding the old Hall and I dare say
  the masons can have it ready by Easter."</p>

  <p>He ran on in a headstrong, boasting style that was, however, to Bessie all
  that was just and proper. She sat, leaning forward and gazing at him with
  delight, taking in every detail of his handsome person. Whatever illness he
  had suffered, it had left no mark upon him; his rounded features were full
  and comely, his yellow hair was glossy and curling on his heavy shoulders, he
  had his ribbons and his lovelock and his finely appointed riding attire.</p>

  <p>He took a purse of money out of his pocket and showed it to Bessie, the
  gold glittering through the silver meshes of the silk.</p>

  <p>"You knitted that for me, Bessie, do you remember? And now it's filled
  with my old uncle's gold and we'll make merry on it."</p>

  <p>Remorse overcame the young girl, even in her delight. She said:</p>

  <p>"Jack, nothing will ever be the same as it was. It has been horrible here.
  You know, thirty-one people have died, and I can't help thinking it was the
  plague that came in my wedding dress!"</p>

  <p>The young man laughed loudly.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's an old wives' tale. The plague doesn't come like that! The
  physicians will tell you that one infected person must bring it. It cannot
  come in a box of clothes!" And he guffawed as if at a good joke. And although
  Bessie was not wholly reassured, she could not help being pleased and felt
  her spirits rise at his buoyant good-humour and easy self-confidence.</p>

  <p>Then he asked her about the progress of the disease and how many deaths
  there had been in the last month? When she said 'none' he laughed again and
  said what were thirty-one people after all? As many often died in the winter,
  of some wasting sickness or chills, or the pox, or the fever. And when he put
  the matter like that it was not such a grave thing after all, and that shut
  up here in Eyam they had made too much of the disaster.</p>

  <p>He would have kept her with him all the evening, he said he had been
  starved of her too long, and he wanted her to sit beside him on the settle
  and gaze into the flames with him and make plans and pictures for their
  future.</p>

  <p>But Bessie said no, she must return to the Rectory and let them know that
  he had returned. If the wedding was really to be at Easter, there were many
  preparations to be made.</p>

  <p>"Though never again, Jack, shall I have such extravagance and vanity."</p>

  <p>So the two young people walked under the rising moon the short distance
  from the old Manor Hall to the Rectory. And there Jack Corbyn's reception was
  such as greatly to satisfy his vanity. For Kate was nearly as excited and
  pleased to see him as Bessie had been, and if the Rector had any reproaches
  to make he kept them to himself and gave the young man a kindly welcome.</p>

  <p>They all sat down to supper together and Ann Trickett brought out some of
  the home-made wine, the silver fruit basket and the fine white cloth from
  Holland that Lady Savile had given Kate when she had been a bride. While
  Bessie ran up to her little room and, taking off her plain winter clothes
  that she had paid so little attention to for some time now, put on a dress of
  saffron yellow silk with a long, deep collar of falling lace.</p>

  <p>They all laughed and talked round the Rectory table. And the children were
  brought in before they went to bed, and Jack Corbyn wanted to give them a
  gold-piece each from the blue knitted silk purse, but the Rector interfered
  and said they were too young to know the value of money.</p>

  <p>Ann Trickett took them to their beds and the two young men and the two
  young women sat in the pleasant firelight talking of the future.</p>

  <p>And as they ran over the events that had occurred since they had last met,
  talking of this person and that who were common acquaintances, the name of
  Thomas Stanley came uppermost, and the Rector mentioned that he had not seen
  him since the outbreak of the plague. He added that he was truly pleased
  about this, because the man had interfered with his parishioners; though no
  doubt well-meaning, the dissenter was far too presumptuous and
  censorious.</p>

  <p>Jack Corbyn looked up quickly at this name; the Rector knew that he was
  thinking of the night of St. Helen's Wake when Thomas Stanley had rebuked him
  so sternly. It was not out of forgetfulness or awkwardness that the Rector
  had brought in the dissenter's name, but deliberately, because he wanted the
  young man to remember that evening. However smooth his outward demeanour, he
  was not wholly pleased with young Corbyn, nor wholly satisfied with his
  conduct. He hoped that he had not returned lightly, merely to hurt Bessie
  again, and he intended to have a stern conversation with him when he should
  get him alone.</p>

  <p>But Jack gave his host a straight and rather curious look as he said:</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir, you haven't seen Stanley. This meddling and canting
  Nonconformist dog has been in Derby Gaol for the last two months. I think he
  only came out a few days ago."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for that," said the Rector, "I did my best to keep him from
  punishment, but he would contravene the law. Who informed against him? Who
  had him arrested?"</p>

  <p>Jack laughed.</p>

  <p>"How do I know. He was caught preaching. I wonder you haven't heard of
  it!"</p>

  <p>"We have been much shut in upon ourselves," replied Mr. Mompesson,
  "holding little communication with the outside world."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," said Kate. The two women had been downcast at the news of
  the Nonconformist's arrest, and Bessie said: "Do you know what happened to
  his gray horse, Merriman?"</p>

  <p>"No. I was surprised to hear he had a horse, for he had to sell it to pay
  his tithe last year."</p>

  <p>"How did you know he had a horse, Jack?" asked Bessie.</p>

  <p>The young man lifted his brows as if he was surprised at the seriousness
  of her tone and said:</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Someone told me. I suppose the horse has been sold
  again."</p>

  <p>The Rector turned the conversation. He was more sorry than he would have
  believed possible that the dissenter had been imprisoned.</p>

  <p>He felt mysteriously humiliated. Why should a man go to prison for his
  honest convictions? When Thomas Stanley had been Rector at Eyam he had done
  his duty admirably. He had brought more people to the church, he had ensured
  a higher standard of conduct, he had made the name of God more feared than
  either his successor, Mr. Sherland Adams, or William Mompesson had been able
  to do.</p>

  <p>And thought the Rector uneasily: 'It is but another turn of the wheel. The
  Church might be disestablished again and the Nonconformists in power as they
  were under the Lord Protector and I be in Derby Gaol and Thomas Stanley here,
  comfortable in this very room.' Then he remembered with an increase of his
  uneasiness that Thomas Stanley had never made himself comfortable in the
  Rectory with pretty women and gay young men, with wine and fine napery and
  silver, but had lived like a recluse in one room, giving up the rest to the
  poor or as a hospital.</p>

  <p>The next day was a break of early sunshine that gave a most unexpected
  warmth and radiance, and Bessie, seeing from her window John approach the
  Rectory, went running down to meet him and they stood talking together,
  leaning against the churchyard wall.</p>

  <p>She pointed out to him the thirty-one green mounds that marked the victims
  of the late sickness in Eyam, and asked him to pray for their souls.</p>

  <p>She was too happy now to feel saddened even by this tragedy, and she had
  quite persuaded herself that the dress had not been the cause of the plague's
  coming to Eyam, so the two young people leant on the low wall and looked at
  the graves with a certain tenderness, seeming to bless, by their very
  happiness, those who lay beneath.</p>

  <p>The sunshine was on the green mounds, and the winter-bitten grass seemed
  to take on freshness from the warmth of its rays, and the lindens above were
  sprinkled with golden buds.</p>

  <p>"How horrible," exclaimed Jack passionately, "to die on a day like
  this!"</p>

  <p>"But most of them," said Bessie, "were old."</p>

  <p>They looked pensively at those thirty-one graves over which the linden
  boughs cast but a thin tracery in the pale sunshine. Some of them had rude
  headstones.</p>

  <p>The sudden transmission from sorrow to joy had made the girl's mood
  exalted; she thought that she could see the thirty-one souls like thin white
  shapes hovering in the bright air. She pressed her lover's hands as they lay,
  strong and comely in repose, on the top of the churchyard wall, placing her
  fingers over them with a movement that was almost convulsive.</p>

  <p>"I have had a strange winter, John. I have really been very lonely."</p>

  <p>"Why, you've had Kate," he said uneasily, "and her babies, and Ann
  Trickett and Mr. Mompesson," for he always spoke in formal tones of the
  Rector.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I have had much to do besides, going about among the sick. But I
  have been lonely too. I have missed Mr. Stanley. I am very sorry that he has
  been in prison; I hope he has not been ill."</p>

  <p>And she added, with what seemed to her lover a strange irrelevancy: "I
  hope he has his gray horse, Merriman, again."</p>

  <p>"He is a rogue who should be sent to the pillory and returned to prison,"
  said John sternly.</p>

  <p>This was so painful to Bessie that she turned her head away and pretended
  she had not heard. Then she went along the wall and through the gate where
  the dead rested on their last journey into the churchyard and stood among
  those graves and plucked a few snowdrops that stood in the hollows between
  the swelling turfs.</p>

  <p>The sun was quite warm and there was a sickly sweet, very faint perfume,
  like that of almonds, in the air.</p>

  <p>Bessie returned to her lover, who remained leaning on the churchyard wall,
  and gave him the snowdrops to put into his bosom, to keep, even after they
  were withered, in remembrance of their coming together again.</p>

  <p>Then they went to the old Manor House where the servants, having had
  warning of the young master's return, had come from their cottages on the
  estate and were putting things to rights, taking the covers off the furniture
  and rolling and hanging up the tapestries, returning the pictures to their
  places in the still habitable rooms.</p>

  <p>Bessie walked through the chambers with a pretty, housewifely air, leaning
  on her lover's arm and laughingly, yet wisely, choosing where this and that
  should go.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sheldon, who was the gardener's wife, and who lived with her husband
  in the cottage beyond the hall yard, acted as housekeeper and was pleased and
  proud to show the charming young lady, who was to be her future mistress, the
  closets, the store-rooms, and those new apartments that were almost
  completed.</p>

  <p>"I never saw the old Manor so properly before," laughed Bess. "When your
  mother was here I was a little afraid of her, John. Besides, the house was so
  full of people, there was no opportunity. Oh, it is a spacious and lovely
  dwelling."</p>

  <p>And the lovers said together:</p>

  <p>"How happy we are going to be here!"</p>

  <p>When Jack Corbyn took Bessie back to the Rectory, the Rector called him
  into the study and there spoke to him about his strange disappearance last
  September and all the evil talk it had given rise to, and poor Bessie's
  distress during that terrible winter when the plague had been in Eyam.</p>

  <p>The young man made his excuses in a frank, and as the Rector thought,
  engaging fashion.</p>

  <p>"In truth, sir," he admitted, "it was largely my mother's fear that kept
  me away. That time you visited us and asked me to go up to see my Lord, she
  saw some agitation in my manner and soon had out of me what the truth of the
  matter was." Here the Rector remembered how he had seen mother and son, when
  he looked back at the window, seeming in close and distressed converse.</p>

  <p>"That was weak, Jack! You should not have given a woman such a secret,
  least of all a mother."</p>

  <p>"I know, sir. But she had it out of me, and she was frightened, said that
  I was to take her away to my uncle in Yorkshire, to join my father who was
  there on business relative to my marriage and his tithe, as you know."</p>

  <p>"I know, Jack, I know. Well, what further excuse have you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had to escort her there. And once we were there, it was true the
  old man was very ill and that I caught his complaint, and she was terrified
  it was the plague. You know she was in Exeter during the war and saw the
  soldiers dying there, and she has ever had a terror of this disease in her
  mind. And then we heard that the plague had really come to Eyam and that the
  tailor's apprentice was dead, and other rumours and gossip. Things were much
  exaggerated, sir; it was at one time said that a hundred had died."</p>

  <p>The Rector smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"Yet your duty was to Bessie, too, as well as to your mother. Bessie might
  have been one of that rumoured hundred."</p>

  <p>"I know, sir, yet I used to pray to God for her, and I thought somehow
  that she'd be protected. Besides, she was in your good care and that of
  Kate's. What could I do for her? I wrote often."</p>

  <p>"I think she found your letters cold."</p>

  <p>"I am a poor writer," said Jack, "but I have come to make amends. I assure
  you that Bessie will be happy with me, sir. And I have this little money now
  from my uncle and we shall finish building the old Manor Hall. Everything
  must be as it was to have been."</p>

  <p>"We can hope so, Jack, we can hope so. I must accept your excuses, which
  certainly seem manly enough. If Bessie is happy, there is no more to be
  said."</p>

  <p>And he added, with a certain pride: "There will be no more plague in Eyam,
  I have taken every precaution. All the infected bedding and furniture from
  the pest-houses have been burnt. And such vessels as we cannot burn have been
  purified in running water or vinegar. There can hardly be a safer place in
  Derbyshire than this little village now."</p>

  <p>Then Jack Corbyn asked if it were true that the infection had come in poor
  Bessie's wedding gown. "For she has that on her mind, I think, sir, and I
  should like to reassure her."</p>

  <p>"I have told her that I am not certain, and you may tell her the same,"
  replied William Mompesson. "Let us forget that matter. Who knows what is
  behind it? Of those thirty-one who died, some were already doomed by age, or
  frail infancy, or other diseases. Let us leave the question of the wedding
  dress."</p>

  <p>And he added his excuse, which he had given before to the women, that it
  might be the infection had come in to Eyam through the mummers. And he
  thought when he said these words, that the young man looked aside. Then he
  asked him abruptly if he had seen any more of these poor wretches&mdash;the
  drollers?</p>

  <p>And the young esquire answered: No, he had seen nothing of them. He
  believed they had travelled southwards, for they went to the larger towns
  during the winter.</p>

  <p>Leaving his books, the Rector wandered on the heath, which was now pale
  and bright with the sunshine of early spring. The snow had disappeared from
  everywhere save on the highest, most rugged peaks, where it lay in the
  crevices so bright in the sunshine that its crystals seemed themselves to
  give off light.</p>

  <p>In this weather, still chill, William Mompesson left the dales&mdash;his
  favourite haunts in the summer&mdash;and preferred the moorlands. He often
  went, where he was straying now, to the circle of grey monoliths and the
  sacrificial stone, where he had burnt the wedding dress. The spot seemed to
  him hallowed, sanctified by all the prayers that he had put up there during
  his visit, by his own passionate endeavours to please his God and save his
  flock, when he had made that poor sacrifice of the finery. He had never been
  called upon to pay for it, for Vickers was dead and had left neither kith nor
  kin.</p>

  <p>But he counted that twenty pounds as lost out of his fortune, to be
  appropriated when the chance should come for some godly work.</p>

  <p>As he stood there now, with the light breeze lifting the hair from his
  forehead, his thoughts went far. He no longer regarded with horror or disgust
  those pagans who had once worshipped in this lonely place; rather he felt a
  kinship with them, feeling that they, after their manner, had been reaching
  out after God even as he was reaching, and the words formed on his lips:
  'They should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him,
  though He be not far from every one of us; for in Him we live and move and
  have our being.'</p>

  <p>And he thought how unreal was this fair shell of things&mdash;the
  mountains, the heaths, the coloured sky, the grey stones, the dips that
  formed the valleys beyond, the rocks of lime and sandstone, the first budding
  trees. And what were all these? Naught, save that in them he might descry the
  symbols of better things!</p>

  <p>To study this world was but to travel in clouds, and all that was but
  allegories, to help us search to find what was beyond this show.</p>

  <p>As William Mompesson thus stood silent beside the monoliths, he saw
  someone coming up over the heath and he knew it at once to be Thomas Stanley.
  And he feit an odd stir of pleasure. His roving ecstasy was checked and he
  thought on worldly matters; about this man's unmerited imprisonment and how
  glad he would be to see him, almost as if it were a friend he welcomed. Yet
  the dissenter had been to him more as an enemy.</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley came briskly to the spot where the Rector stood, and held
  out his hand.</p>

  <p>His once florid face was sallow and seamed, his clothes, even more than
  formerly, used and stained, though carefully cleaned and mended. He had a
  wallet at his side and carried a staff.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," said Mr. Mompesson frankly, "about your misfortune. I hope
  you do not think that I had any hand in your imprisonment."</p>

  <p>"I know you did not," replied the dissenter. "It was young Jack Corbyn who
  set the constables upon me."</p>

  <p>"Jack Corbyn!" Mr. Mompesson turned aside. He wished it had not been so.
  Yet he had no right to blame the young man, even if he had acted
  over-zealously.</p>

  <p>"I do not regret the trial I had in Derby Gaol, and I was able to be of
  some service to my fellow-prisoners. Therefore, grieve not for my misfortune,
  I never thought much of the body's bliss and I have always lived roughly. But
  I had one pain, and that was that you might think I had forsaken you when the
  plague broke out, for even in Derby we heard of that. There was unwonted
  cleanliness and fumigation in the gaol, for they said the plague had come to
  the country and even the mountains."</p>

  <p>"It is over," said Mompesson. "I believe that if you had been able, you
  would have come. I thought you had not heard. We lived much enclosed." And he
  added with a sigh of relief, profound and deep, "It is over, God be
  praised."</p>

  <p>"Why should we praise Him for that?" asked the Puritan sombrely. "Who
  knows His will? Why should we praise Him that more are left in tribulation?
  Are not those who died happier?"</p>

  <p>"But these are rude, savage people," replied Mr. Mompesson, "by no means
  fit for Heaven. They have not repented, they do not even understand the
  meaning of the word. I had much ado, with those who died, to bring them to a
  sense of their danger. Besides, humanly speaking, I had my loved ones to
  think of&mdash;two young women, two children. It is human love that dim's
  one's spiritual sight."</p>

  <p>"I think Heaven seems to you as far away, William Mompesson, as it does to
  your rude flock."</p>

  <p>"I see," smiled the Rector, "that you still think my heart hard, bound up
  and asleep. You still consider me a worldly man. Perhaps I was, I admit as
  much. But I have had my lesson this winter. I do not think so much of gauze,
  stars, pearls, rainbows as once I did."</p>

  <p>Then, with a smile, as it were at a tangent: "Have you still Merriman, the
  gray horse?"</p>

  <p>The Puritan replied that he had, that a friend had kept the animal for
  him, while he had been in prison, and it was safe now at a neighbouring farm
  where it was resting.</p>

  <p>"For since I came out a fortnight ago I have ridden him hard and far. But
  this afternoon, in this clean, white day, I was minded to walk across the
  heath."</p>

  <p>"Do not come to Eyam," warned the Rector. "Jack Corbyn has returned to the
  Manor and has begun again preparations for his marriage with Bessie Carr, my
  sister-in-law."</p>

  <p>"I should care little for that," answered the dissenter indifferently, "if
  I were needed in Eyam. But I was there two days ago and visited some of my
  old flock, although you knew nothing of it," he added with a simplicity that
  made his words void of offence.</p>

  <p>The Rector warned him, though kindly:</p>

  <p>"Take care how you go about these busy restless ways administering in
  secret. It is still against the law and thou may'st yet visit prison
  again."</p>

  <p>"I know it well," replied the dissenter. He snatched off his ragged hat
  and let the clear breeze blow against his thick gray locks and rugged brow.
  "What is that to me? I am in the hands of God."</p>

  <p>These words savoured much of the cant that the Puritans were accused of
  using, yet to the Rector they were sincere.</p>

  <p>The two men parted. William Mompesson was comforted by the meeting and
  watched with a kindly glance the sturdy figure of the dissenter disappearing
  across the lonely moor.</p>

  <p>Where did he live, the outcast? In holes and crannies like the fox or the
  rabbit, or in a stable or barn of some lonely farm-house, fed by charity, he
  and the gray horse Merriman? And Mr. Mompesson's heart softened with
  tenderness for little Bessie who in her gayest, most frivolous season, had
  thought of the wandering preacher and his horse.</p>

  <p>He turned towards the village, and as the low wind blew the springing
  grasses around his feet, he felt an unutterable loneliness that was hardly
  dispersed when he beheld the light that was just lit in the Rectory window
  before him.</p>

  <p>Jack Corbyn was expected at supper that evening, but he did not come.</p>

  <p>"He has gone, perhaps," said Kate, when it was hopeless to expect him any
  longer, "to meet his mother. He said that she, and possibly his father, would
  be returning this week."</p>

  <p>"But it was not to have been to-day," said the Rector, who was puzzled,
  for he had sent Jonathan Mortin over to the old Manor House to ask after the
  young squire, and the servants had told him that he had gone abroad early in
  the afternoon. Was it possible that the young man was setting some foolish
  trick upon them again? That he was really so false and unstable that he would
  a second time forsake Bessie?</p>

  <p>The Rector could not believe it, but quieting the women as well as he
  could, for they, though laughing, confessed to some fears as to what had
  happened to Jack Corbyn, he went himself to the old Manor House, where the
  workmen had begun again to labour on the new buildings.</p>

  <p>He received the same tale as that which had been given to Jonathan Mortin.
  The young man had been seen in the early afternoon and had seemed in high
  spirits, even gay. He had gone out, he had taken his horse, and they believed
  he was riding to Chatsworth to wait upon my Lord.</p>

  <p>The Rector found some discrepancy among these statements. The housekeeper
  thought he had returned, the men-servants thought he had not. As he had with
  him no body-servant, it might be just possible that he was shut in his
  chamber, having gone up there without anyone's having seen him; and upon
  investigation his horse was found in the stable.</p>

  <p>"This is a household in much disorder," said the Rector displeased. "Your
  master may come and go and you know not his whereabouts! I'll go upstairs
  myself and see if he be in his chamber."</p>

  <p>So he took a small lamp from the housekeeper and went up the fine, wide,
  shallow stairs of the old Manor Hall. Though his mood was distracted, he
  found pleasure in the handsome dwelling that seemed so spacious and noble
  after the mean quarters of the Rectory.</p>

  <p>He was ashamed at once of this reflection and felt a pang of anguish at
  the knowledge, how ever-present with him, even now after he had been much
  purged of vanity during the last winter, was the love of worldly splendour
  and beauty.</p>

  <p>The housekeeper had told him that young Mr. Corbyn's room was that on the
  right when he came to the stair-head, so he knocked there, holding the lamp
  in his hand. And when there was no answer, opened the door.</p>

  <p>The room was in darkness and he cried out: "Jack! Jack!" holding his lamp
  up.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that the young man was ill? He had been unwell when in
  Yorkshire, and he might have had a recurrence of his sickness. But there was
  no one on the bed; the curtains were drawn back, the pillows
  untouched&mdash;his belt, his boots, his feathered hat, his purse and gloves,
  his shirt and socks were flung on the floor, and these were soiled with dust
  and mud. While flung over another chair was his coat of pale gold-coloured
  cloth laced with silver.</p>

  <p>'This was what he was going to wear to-night,' thought the Rector. 'He was
  changing his clothes when something disturbed him. He had put off one suit
  and not completely attired himself in another. Where is he, then?'</p>

  <p>As he thought this, the Rector moved round the bed and there, stretched on
  the floor, he saw Jack Corbyn, clad in his gold-coloured breeches and the
  fine shirt that was open at the neck. The cravat and the black ribbon used to
  tie it were undone. His eyes were half-closed, the whites alone showing, his
  mouth was open and from the corners blood was bubbling.</p>

  <p>The Rector set the lamp upon the table and went on one knee beside the
  young man, thinking of murder, and wondering who could have got in and slain
  young Corbyn.</p>

  <p>His greatest terror was absent from his mind at this moment, and he pulled
  open the shirt to put his hand on the fallen man's heart. As he did so he saw
  the black plague spots on the broad, arched white bosom.</p>

  <p>The Rector got to his feet and recoiled as if a blow had been struck him
  between the eyes. All his senses were stunned at the realization of what had
  happened. The plague! Bessie's bridegroom dead of the plague! He had fled
  from it months before, been safe in an untainted spot, and then, when the
  contagious disease was over, he had returned. And he was the first victim of
  a new epidemic.</p>

  <p>It was over a month since anyone had died of the plague in Eyam, and the
  Rector for a moment did not think even of Bessie's tragedy, but only of the
  horror of the failure of his own precautions.</p>

  <p>The black death was, then, still in the village! Or was it possible that
  young Corbyn had brought it with him? He had been home about a week&mdash;the
  Rector made a rapid calculation. He had died very quickly, yet there had been
  others who had been snatched away as suddenly&mdash;laughing in the morning
  and dead, with the foul froth on their lips, in the evening.</p>

  <p>He tried to remember the young man's demeanour yesterday; he had been a
  little languid, he had said that it was hot, yet it was only early April in
  the mountains, and the Rector had noticed nothing but a pleasant mildness in
  the air. Three days ago he had noticed him with Bessie under the bare linden
  trees, leaning over the churchyard wall, looking at those thirty-one graves.
  And he remembered seeing Bessie go round by the lych-gate and pluck the
  snowdrops and hand them to her lover.</p>

  <p>There was no infection possible there. No one living near the churchyard
  had had the plague.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson put his hand to his brow and a wordless prayer left him,
  a soundless appeal to his God.</p>

  <p>Then, leaning against the tapestry that Bessie had seen hung with such
  pleasure but a few days before, the young Rector tried to reconstruct what
  had happened.</p>

  <p>The young man had come in, not having been noticed by his servants, and
  gone upstairs to change his riding-clothes for those he intended to wear to
  the Rectory and suddenly, even as he had been changing his shirt, must have
  been smitten and fallen down without the power to give a cry. The infection
  must have been virulent, and he so young and strong... Rector heard himself
  saying aloud: "And so afraid..."</p>

  <p>Well, here was the end truly, now, of Bessie's marriage.</p>

  <p>The young man took the lamp and crossed the disordered bedchamber.</p>

  <p>He was thinking rapidly, his whole nature seethed up to meet this crisis.
  There was no time for agitation or lament, little for sorrow. The servants,
  the housekeeper, and two others, had gathered at the foot of the stairs,
  apprehensive of something unusual, even dreadful, for the Rector had been
  some time in their master's bedroom and there had been silence, for he had
  had the fortitude not to cry out.</p>

  <p>Standing at the top of the stairs, holding his lamp, William Mompesson
  said: "Your master has died of a sudden sickness."</p>

  <p>He thought of saying, No doubt it is a recurrence of the attacks he had in
  Yorkshire, but he did not dare to lie, so he added: "It is the plague. Get
  out rags and vinegar and such spices as you have and burn them at the foot of
  the stairs."</p>

  <p>The servants drew back with a little shudder, as if they had been struck,
  one by one. The women put their aprons to their faces, the men looked sullen.
  There were others in the door now and the words went from one to another:
  "The plague! The master, dead upstairs."</p>

  <p>The Rector stood among them and gave his lamp into the hands of one of the
  stable-men.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-one people have died of the plague in this village, but you have
  been spared. You have no need to think that you are doomed now. I must write
  to the young esquire's parents."</p>

  <p>And he thought to himself: 'They will not return.' Aloud he said: "And as
  he has no near relatives here, I will order his coffin."</p>

  <p>"And who's to put him into it, sir?" asked the man who held the lamp that
  cast a yellow light over his sickly face.</p>

  <p>"I have done that work myself, so far," replied Mr. Mompesson, "save in
  those cases where the relatives wished to do it. Let none go to your master's
  room. I will return when I have wrought some fumigants, and wrap your master
  in his shroud. Get out a sheet and some candles and all the spices you have
  in the house."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir," sobbed the pallid housekeeper, "the poor young mistress!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Rector gravely, "pray for her." And like a dart in his
  mind was the thought that Bessie's wedding dress had slain her
  bridegroom.</p>

  <p>He met her as he was returning; in her eagerness she had come from the
  Rectory, hoping to meet her lover and her brother-in-law on the way. Over her
  silvery gown she had put a dark mantle, and her small face was pale in the
  hood.</p>

  <p>"Bessie," he said, taking her hand, "happiness is not for you, but courage
  may be. None can spare you this suffering, child."</p>

  <p>"Happiness not for me! Suffering!" she repeated. "Jack is ill?"</p>

  <p>"Jack is dead, I have seen him just now. He has died of the plague,
  Bessie. There is no time for lamentation."</p>

  <p>He caught her strongly as she cried out and seemed about to fall, and he
  added:</p>

  <p>"Bess, this is death to the common eye, but the soul that was in thy Jack
  is now in eternity."</p>

  <p>That night Catherine Mompesson watched by Bessie, who fell into a gentle
  wildness and with the mounting heat in her blood spoke crazily of her wedding
  dress, of the decked church, the marriage morning.</p>

  <p>Ann Trickett kept the two children in the far part of the house, and the
  Rector spent the night in the old Manor Hall; Jonathan Mortin had volunteered
  to help him in the preparation of the body of Jack Corbyn for the grave.</p>

  <p>The young man was folded with sprigs of bay and rue and sorrel and
  rosemary into one of his mother's finest sheets, and as there had been many
  coffins made of late in the village, there was one in readiness that had been
  waiting for five weeks or more for the next victim of the plague; this was
  brought down to the old Manor Hall and the young man placed in it. And before
  they were able to nail him in, his flesh was putrefying so that for all the
  fumigants the stench was almost insupportable.</p>

  <p>So on the next day he was buried in the churchyard near to those
  thirty-one graves that he and Bessie had been looking at four days
  before.</p>

  <p>The Rector read the burial service over him and afterwards went into the
  church to pray.</p>

  <p>On the afternoon of that day Bessie fell into a deep sleep and when she
  woke was composed and quiet, yet seemed to her anxious sister to be a
  different person from the girl who had fallen down when her brother-in-law
  met her with the news of her lover's death.</p>

  <p>From her window she could see the grave, the fresh overturned sods. In
  burying him they had disturbed the snowdrops she had plucked to put in his
  bosom. But nothing had changed; there seemed no more flowerets in the grass,
  no more buds on the trees, it was still early spring, the season not advanced
  one jot. Yet to Bessie and Kate it seemed that it had been in another
  existence that they had helped to lay the supper table, putting in its place
  the great salt-cellar and standing out the wineglasses and the flagons and
  laying the napkins for the coming of Jack Corbyn to supper.</p>

  <p>Bessie had no thought save for her own infinite loss, though she said:</p>

  <p>"Kate, you must not think I shall hinder you with groans and sighs. I have
  nothing to do now but wait until I join him in Heaven, but meanwhile I must
  work and be of some service. Give me something to do, if it is only in the
  kitchen."</p>

  <p>So Kate found her little tasks here and there. There were always many
  duties to perform in the Rectory where there were two children and the house
  was old and rambling.</p>

  <p>But Kate had other fears, though she did not voice them. She felt Bessie's
  tragedy to the core of her heart, though for herself she had not much liked
  Jack and she had even been sorry that he had returned into her sister's life,
  for she thought that if he had stayed away poor Bess would have recovered
  herself at last and found herself a better mate. And Kate nourished this hope
  even now. Bessie was very young and her grief would die, and she would find
  another husband.</p>

  <p>But Kate's fear and grief was for the return of the plague. It had never
  been so near the Rectory as the old Manor House. She thought of her two
  children and her husband, even of kind Ann Trickett and good Jonathan Mortin,
  who had gone to the old Manor House to put the body into its coffin. They had
  believed themselves safe and here it was again. And the horror of the young
  man's death clung to her like a cloud over her spirits and a veil over her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Her husband had given her some brief particulars of how Jack must have
  gone upstairs and even while he was changing his clothes fallen down without
  a chance to make a Will, to say a word, to have his soul shriven, to say
  farewell. Oh, it was horrible!</p>

  <p>And Kate wished they had not buried him where his grave could be seen from
  the window. But it had chanced that that corner of the churchyard was where
  the other plague victims had been put. And the feeling was to put them all
  together and afterwards to raise some memorial to them. There was talk of
  taking the great ancient cross that stood the other side of the church and
  placing it there. But for Jack Corbyn there would, of course, be a fine altar
  tomb. Perhaps his parents would plant another yew tree; there was one already
  in the churchyard at the other side of the porch.</p>

  <p>But Kate knew that this fear of the graves was folly, perhaps wickedness.
  Neither she nor Bessie, nay, nor even her two children, should shrink from
  these evidences of mortality, but keep the graves before their eyes and
  remember their own slight tenure of years and how soon their dust would be
  dispersed, too.</p>

  <p>Kate prayed often, but into her prayers came little creeping doubts that
  distracted her from thoughts of Heaven.</p>

  <p>And three days after the death of Jack Corbyn two of the servants in the
  old Manor House were taken ill and four days after that, two more. And within
  a week there were twenty in Eyam sick of the plague. Nor did the
  strengthening sunshine, for the spring was early and brilliant, seem to help
  them.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson sent to Chatsworth for supplies of medicines and
  fumigants and went among the sick, but soon there were so many ill that he
  could not minister to them all and some had to die without Christian
  consolation.</p>

  <p>And so the quick tragedy of Jack Corbyn's death was soon forgotten in the
  fierce onslaught of the return of the plague to Eyam.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; AN ANGEL TALKING TO A MAN</h2>

  <p class="first">WILLIAM MOMPESSON had withdrawn into the dell nearest the
  village, where he might find some solitude for meditation and yet be near at
  hand, should his services be of a sudden required, as was very likely during
  the plague.</p>

  <p>In May, only three had died of the plague, and hope had revived again in
  Eyam, and there had been a relaxation of the strict rules that the doctor,
  Mr. Walbeoffe, from Chatsworth, had laid down, and Mr. Mompesson in his
  reports to my Lord-Lieutenant had been able to write cheerfully of the
  future.</p>

  <p>But it was now June and as uncommonly warm as the winter had been
  uncommonly severe, and the plague had returned with exceptional malignancy;
  since the death of young Fulwood, the tailor's apprentice, seventy-four
  people had died of the plague or of an illness presumed to be plague; and
  terrible as that scourge had been, it was as nothing to the desolation that
  afflicted Eyam now.</p>

  <p>Three weeks of June had gone and in that period of time thirty had died
  and ten more were ill.</p>

  <p>The wealthier inhabitants of the village, those who dwelt about the
  lych-gate on the western side beyond the stream had, many of them, left the
  district, and all the strangers, such as the masons who had been employed
  upon repairing the old Manor Hall, had gone, as well as several of the miners
  who were not natives of Eyam, but had come to lodge there for the convenience
  of their work. Nor had Mr. Corbyn, the esquire, returned to look upon the
  grave of his only son, while there had been no word or sign from some of the
  other considerable families who lived a short distance from Eyam, nor had
  William Mompesson sent for them.</p>

  <p>The situation was fast becoming such as taxed all his resources, almost
  overcame his courage. There was scarcely labour enough to carry the dead to
  the churchyard. Unassisted, the Rector had to read the funeral services at
  the rate of one a day, comfort the sick and dying, hold services, and preach
  in the church that now was always full.</p>

  <p>As he sat beside the stream down which George, his little son, had once
  sent the paper boats folded from sheets of his sermon, his thoughts flew
  desperately wide. He felt like the general in a besieged city with a scant
  garrison, few means of defence and a low stock of provisions. But worse than
  the terror of his position was the sense of the clouds above, weighty and
  dull, as if he were put away and divorced from the will of God and indeed
  knew not what his Maker would have him do. Nor could he conceive why the
  plague that had left the whole country-side free, or shown itself but a
  little in a city like Derby, should have broken out in this solitary
  spot.</p>

  <p>And he remembered what Sythe Torre had said, about God's judgment, and
  foolish&mdash;yes, surely they were foolish&mdash;incidents like the driving
  of the cow into the church before St. Helen's Wake came into his perturbed
  mind.</p>

  <p>He was so absorbed in his sad meditation that he did not notice that
  Merriman, the dissenter's iron-gray horse, was tethered to an ash tree not
  far away, for the colour of the beast was easily lost in that of the shadows.
  So it was with a start that he became aware of Thomas Stanley approaching
  him; he hardened himself against the Puritan and made a motion of his hand to
  hold him off, saying:</p>

  <p>"Do not approach me, I may carry the disease of the plague."</p>

  <p>"You know well enough," replied Thomas Stanley, with a dour smile, "that I
  have been in Eyam as much as you have and have probably been infected."</p>

  <p>"I'll not endure it," said Mompesson, whose state of fatigue, strained
  patience, and apprehension was not such as could endure the persistency of
  this grim man. "I shall be compelled to warn the constable that you must be
  arrested, if you persist in interfering with my ministrations."</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley seemed to take no offence at this rebuke, indeed he looked
  kindly, almost with compassion, at the worn features of the Rector, whose
  attire was not so precise and nice as usual, whose linen bands were ruffled,
  whose black cravat was untied.</p>

  <p>"I have a proposition to make to you, Mr. Mompesson. These people are
  mine, I know them, their natures, their stories, their families far better
  than you can, for I was years in the place that you now hold. You have been
  here scarce a twelve-month and are still a stranger. Take away your wife,
  your sister, your children to some safe spot&mdash;Sir George Savile will
  house you at Rufford Park or find you another cure. Leave Eyam to me. You
  know, sir," he added simply, "that you can trust me with these poor people in
  their affliction."</p>

  <p>The Rector smiled in his turn.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I would fly my post, leaving it to you?"</p>

  <p>"It was done commonly in London," replied the dissenter. "Many Church of
  England clergy went into the sweet air and left the Nonconformists to do
  their work."</p>

  <p>Mompesson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You are a brave man, though obstinate, and fanatic, Mr. Stanley. And even
  if I were minded to accept your offer it would not be tolerated. Were you to
  come forward openly in Eyam, you would be re-arrested."</p>

  <p>"I think not, there are not many who are eager to come to Eyam now, and if
  I were doing good work for the souls and bodies of these poor people, I think
  I should be allowed to pursue my task of making the living waters flow even
  through dry dust."</p>

  <p>The Rector rose abruptly.</p>

  <p>"You must leave me and leave this talk, and take yourself away, Mr.
  Stanley, for this plague is beyond all computation horrible. Every day
  another falls of the disease; so many fast and foul decays unsettle the
  mind."</p>

  <p>"It is a strange thing," remarked the Puritan reflectively, "that it
  should return. They say you know something of medicine, sir. Have you studied
  what this plague may be and how it may pass from one to another?"</p>

  <p>The intense interest of this question and his burning eagerness to discuss
  it with someone cool and intelligent, for there were none such now in Eyam,
  caused Mr. Mompesson to answer, regardless of their former controversy:</p>

  <p>"I have indeed studied. I do little else in what leisure I have. Since
  young Fulwood died, I have been investigating the matter. I sent then into
  Bakewell and to my Lord's physician for such books as might be had, and I
  have the tracts published by the Royal College of Physicians. I do not even
  know what this plague is. Is it the black death that came so often before to
  England? Is it the African fever bred in Ethiopia or Egypt, of which Pliny
  speaks? Does it, as he asserts, travel always from south to north?"</p>

  <p>"It is more important to know," observed the dissenter shrewdly, "not what
  it is, but how it spreads."</p>

  <p>"I can get no certainty on that point," replied Mompesson. "There is one
  ancient author who mentions a feather-bed that proved mortal and had been
  carried from one infected family to another. There is a tale that bandages of
  one who had died of the plague were put between the wainscot and the wall of
  a house in Paris and many months afterwards the person who took them out
  immediately died. I have heard tales, too, that in Holland the plague was
  carried from one village to another in clothes."</p>

  <p>"It is supposed that it travels in goods of a loose texture which hold
  imprisoned the seed of the infection," said the Puritan. "All declare that in
  this epidemic it came to London by some ships from Cyprus, or the Levant,
  through Amsterdam and Rotterdam. I have heard, too, that it was brought in
  some woollen goods from Holland to London last December twelve-month. And is
  it not true what I have heard whispered in Eyam, that it came through a box
  of clothes or patterns sent to Vickers, the tailor?"</p>

  <p>"I believe that to be true, then the severity and frost of the winter
  seemed to kill the plague. Surely it is to do with the heat, the infection
  must have been lurking in something that lay frozen up during the winter and
  was released again with the sun. But what it was I cannot think, for
  everything I could lay hands on that had to do with the infected person I
  burnt."</p>

  <p>"You made good use of fumigants, too," said the dissenter. "The place
  smelt like a spice box."</p>

  <p>"Yet it was not sufficient and I blame myself. I am the only educated man
  in this place&mdash;-the Corbyns and the country gentry scarcely come here,
  and their minds are so little on these things. And I have studied medicine,
  yet I could not prevent this."</p>

  <p>"It was not God's will that you should do so," remarked the Puritan sadly.
  And the conventional words had a double-edged meaning to Mompesson's
  mind.</p>

  <p>"It must be God's will that we should suffer so," he agreed. "Tell me why
  this foul horror should be sent and I placed here to face it, all unfitted
  and unwilling as I am?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot interpret God's mind to you," said Thomas Stanley, "I can only
  assure you that it is God's will that the plague is in Eyam and His will that
  you face it. And if, humanly speaking, there is nothing you can do, then you
  must stay among your people&mdash;since you obstinately refuse my
  relief&mdash;and comfort them as best you may."</p>

  <p>"Has it to do with the weather?" The Rector frowned and put his weary hand
  over his wrinkled brow. "I have heard that pestilences come with earthquakes,
  droughts, excessive rains, or pestiferous winds. Yet there was nothing here,
  save the extreme cold of the winter, and the heat now&mdash;it is something
  excessive for June in the mountains."</p>

  <p>"I have read," said Mr. Stanley, "that three hundred years ago or more,
  when the black death went through Europe, the foundations of the earth were
  shaken from China to the Atlantic, and we may suppose that it is the baleful
  influence of the atmosphere that brings the pest. Sometimes it comes, they
  say, in a thick stinking mist; at one time this lay right over Italy and it
  was of such deadly nature that thousands fell down and expired in agony."</p>

  <p>"But what is this contagion," asked Mr. Mompesson, "something invisible?
  That is what I cannot understand&mdash;what is it that leaps from one to
  another? It is certain there is no law about it, it is utterly unreasonable.
  A woman who died four days ago had a child five months old, who lay in the
  same bed with her, but it has escaped the disorder. And there is another
  ancient woman, upwards of seventy years old, who had it, but has recovered.
  Her two little grandchildren, who were in the same house with her, received
  the infection and died."</p>

  <p>"It is not for us to probe these mysteries," replied the Puritan, "but to
  do the task assigned to us."</p>

  <p>"It is my task, not yours," replied the Rector, with a sigh. "I thank you
  for your offer, Mr. Stanley. I admire your bravery, but you must leave me
  alone at my post."</p>

  <p>"You undertake to do more than it is in the capacity of one man to
  perform," said the Puritan in a note of warning. "Do you think that you,
  hampered as you are by your love for your wife, your sister, your two
  children, by your care and affection for your servants, can administer to all
  these people? What will you do if the plague becomes worse?"</p>

  <p>"God help me! It can hardly be worse," exclaimed the Rector
  mournfully.</p>

  <p>"It well may be. A hundred thousand, they say, died in the last year in
  London. You had about six hundred persons under your care and so far only a
  hundred have died. Supposing all of them are sick, supposing they fall round
  you quicker than you can count? Who is to bury them, who is to keep some
  order among them, who is to administer to their souls? You have not even a
  doctor, you have no skilled help!"</p>

  <p>The Rector was for a moment tempted to take into an alliance this
  courageous and intelligent man, who seemed more full of the fear of God than
  he was himself, who was not tortured by his own sensitiveness, his doubts and
  conflicts. But it was against his principles to have dealings with any who
  did not belong to the Church of England. So, making very few words about the
  matter, he declined the help of the Nonconformist and once more begged him to
  be out of the district that was now so terribly infected, and to leave him to
  do as best he could in Eyam.</p>

  <p>And he thought it his duty to add a warning, that he had defied the law
  for the sake of his kindly feeling for the dissenter long enough and could do
  so no more.</p>

  <p>And that if Mr. Stanley was found in Eyam it would be his, the Rector's,
  duty to tell the constable to take him to Bakewell and so to the gaol in
  Derby.</p>

  <p>The dissenter did not reply, save by a curt inclination of his head, and
  turning away loosed Merriman from the ash tree and led him along the glen in
  the direction of Chatsworth.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson felt that he had done his duty both in declining the
  help of the dissenter and in threatening him with prison. Yet it was with
  regret that he watched the shabby, stalwart figure disappearing behind the
  tree-grown rocks and boulders; he, Mompesson, not Thomas Stanley, had been
  broken by the rebuke.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the Rectory, Jonathan Mortin, without a word, showed
  him a paper on which was written the names of three more families infected
  since that forenoon with the plague.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson said nothing. He washed his hands with vinegar, put
  another pomander in his pocket, took up his box of chemical antidotes and
  went out into the village street.</p>

  <p>It is always difficult to become accustomed to a great calamity, terror
  weighs intermittently on the spirit and always has the aspect of an evil
  dream. So the young Rector, coming out of his pleasant home and skirting the
  churchyard wall and pausing for a moment under the golden fragrance of the
  linden trees, could hardly believe that this dreadful horror had befallen
  him.</p>

  <p>He looked at the graves; the last were roughly made, the sexton and the
  two miners who had given up their work to help him had cut the turfs
  hurriedly and hastily put them into place. There were many now who had no
  headstones nor were there any wreaths of spring flowers about their resting
  places.</p>

  <p>Three more families infected... Death set all out of joint, even the
  tranquil summer day.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly down the street, there were few people in sight. He
  reflected again and anxiously upon the fact that those upon the western side
  behind the stream seemed to be free from the infection, and he wondered if it
  was the running water that stayed the plague.</p>

  <p>If he had but a little more knowledge! Was there any wise man anywhere who
  could inform him of what to do? But he consoled himself a little by
  remembering that in the capital, where the most skilled physicians in the
  country had gathered together in conclave, and where public-spirited men had
  worked diligently at every possible expedient, still the scourge had not been
  stayed until the great city was desolate.</p>

  <p>He began to turn over in his mind what they had done there. He remembered
  some tales coming through to Rufford Park of Sir George Savile sending a
  handsome subscription to the Lord Mayor's Fund for the relief of the victims,
  and how arrangements had been made to take food into the stricken districts,
  and how nurses had been employed by the City Fathers to go to those families
  where there was none left well enough to nurse the others.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson remembered, too, some of the tales about these nurses. How
  they robbed the sick, sometimes pulling from under them the very sheets that
  should have served them for a shroud, and he thought that if he could find
  some such cool and hardened creatures in Eyam, it would help him in his
  task.</p>

  <p>At the first house that he visited a little girl was ill. She lay on two
  pillows on the floor in an upper room where all the windows were closed and
  the air was thick and sweet. The plague spots had already appeared on her
  breast, and her mother, kneeling beside her, was giving vent to piercing
  lamentations.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson was already well used to the progress of this disease.
  It varied little in its manifestations; it began with shivering, hot and cold
  fits, headaches, sickness, then delirium; then the appearance of the fatal
  tokens, the plague spots on the breast and thighs that meant immediate death.
  At best the illness never took more than three days; sometimes it was sudden,
  as in the case of Jack Corbyn. A man or woman would fall down at his or her
  work, a child at his play, and be dead before they could be carried to the
  pest-house.</p>

  <p>In this case, as in others, the Rector found a painful difficulty in
  removing the patient from her home. The mother protested and wailed, the
  father stood by, sullen and inactive. And he had to send for Jonathan Mortin
  to help him carry the child to the little plague-house on the green.</p>

  <p>When they reached this, the Rector left the child to be cared for by the
  two women who worked there&mdash;one was the district midwife, the other a
  woman who was supposed to have much skill in nursing. Both had already had
  the infection last October and were supposed to be immune.</p>

  <p>There were four sick people in the pest-house, and these, seeing the
  Rector, made a clamour to him to speak to them, for they had been but
  recently smitten. Indeed, so rapid was the plague in its progress that those
  in the pest-house were either lively or dead.</p>

  <p>The Rector could not stay long, for he remembered two other infected
  families that he had to visit, but he went up to the bed of one man to whom
  he had given a dose of Peruvian bark that had been sent him by Sir George
  Savile with a letter that it had been used with great effect in Spain and
  Belgium, and that in the recent plague in Holland had not failed in a single
  case in Delft. It was supposed to keep down the fermentation of the blood and
  thus lower the fever and the paroxysm of delirium.</p>

  <p>But this man, who had had the new and costly remedy&mdash;two pounds was
  charged for as much as would make twenty doses at <i>The Black Spotted
  Eagle</i> in the Old Bailey, or at Mr. John Crooks, Booksellers, at the sign
  of <i>The Ship</i> in St. Paul's Churchyard&mdash;appeared no better. He
  complained of headache and want of sleep and said he had axes and hammers and
  fireworks in his head that he could not bear.</p>

  <p>The Rector gave him a quieting potion and turned to the other patients,
  two of whom in their delirium had fallen off their truckle beds and lay on
  the floor, the women being unable to lift them. And indeed Mr. Mompesson
  could see that labour spent on them would be wasted, for they were plainly
  marked for death. He still felt surprised by this calamity, which seemed too
  gross for relief. He winced before the horror that lay in ambush for his
  soul.</p>

  <p>He went on his way through the village, resolving with deep distress, that
  he would not try the Peruvian bark again, for it might be well enough in an
  ague or a seizure, but it was clearly useless in the plague. And as he
  considered how unreliable these medicines were, he could not blame the poor
  people who kept charms in their bosom or tied round their wrist and who,
  despite all he could say, crept out at night to visit old Mother Sydall upon
  the moor, or who sent in whenever it was possible to do so to <i>The Brass
  Head</i> at Bakewell to buy amulets and potions.</p>

  <p>At the next house he visited, a young man had been stricken. He was a
  miner and had fallen down on returning from his work. His wife was in the
  apathy of despair. She declared that she had expected this, since she had
  seen the white cricket only four days ago, while the death watch had ticked
  for three successive nights.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson saw that the young man was too far gone to think of moving
  him to the pest-house, so he sat beside him and read the service for the
  dying, although the patient, ranting in his delirium, took no heed.</p>

  <p>And then he went his way to the third family, and here an old woman was
  ill, lying on the floor in a paroxysm, while her widow daughter and three
  children stood staring at her in curiosity and dismay. Before he could do
  anything to relieve this patient, a boy came running up and told the Rector
  that there was another man ill in the house by the stream that divided the
  village.</p>

  <p>When William Mompesson, now feeling faint, sick, and weary himself,
  reached with a lagging step this house, Jonathan Mortin walking behind him
  with the medicine-box and the Prayer Book, he found that it was Ealott, the
  constable of the village, who had been smitten, a strong man who had
  weathered many sicknesses, including the sweating and the pox.</p>

  <p>This fellow sat on his chair by his hearth and was shivering, yet
  complained of burning heat. He had his senses, though his speech was thick
  and his eyesight double, but what concerned the Rector most was that by his
  chair stood Thomas Stanley, in his coarse country clothes, which brought a
  scent of the heather in the air sullied by sickness.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, sir," said the dissenter. "You see that the man whom you
  spoke of as likely to arrest me is my friend and sent for me. He has been
  unwell for two days, but did not like to speak of it. I was on my way to see
  him when I met you but now."</p>

  <p>The constable himself spoke and the Rector stood silent, gazing at his
  livid face, his dragged mouth, his heavy eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I meant no disloyalty nor disrespect to you nor to the Church. Mr.
  Stanley was my pastor for years, and I wearied after him as did others."</p>

  <p>The dying man coughed and turned his head aside, and the dissenter gave
  him a glass of plain water, which he sipped slowly; his lips were strained
  and had a bluish look, his deep chest heaved painfully; he began to fall into
  a delirium, but through his broken words the Rector understood his deep
  desire that Mr. Thomas Stanley and the Rector of Eyam should work together at
  this time of distress.</p>

  <p>"Do you not think," demanded the dissenter, looking straight at Mr.
  Mompesson, "that God speaks through this poor man's mouth? The very man whom
  you would have made the instrument of my punishment? If you will not give me
  back my ancient post here, at least permit that I remain and help you in your
  task."</p>

  <p>The Rector was silent, debating in himself, but as the neighbours came in
  to remove the constable to the pest-house on the green, he felt a strong
  conflict within himself.</p>

  <p>Easy to obey God, if one knew His commands! Had He spoken through the
  mouth of the village constable who in a few hours would be dead?</p>

  <p>"Let thy faith," urged the dissenter, "take a practical turn, friend. Thou
  canst not do this work unaided; there is more even than we can contrive to
  accomplish together."</p>

  <p>"I accept your help," replied the Rector quietly. "While the plague
  endures, at least, let us bury ancient controversies and plan together, you
  and I, how we may meet this trial. First," he added, "you must come to the
  Rectory. You can no longer live in the woods and fields, a fugitive from the
  law."</p>

  <p>"I will come with you gladly, and we will stand together, shoulder to
  shoulder. There is no situation so terrible that there is not some wise and
  worthy way of meeting it. Even now, as I did in Derby gaol, I feel God in
  every breath that passes and every beam that falls."</p>

  <p>That night three more cases of the plague were reported in Eyam, and the
  Rector and the Puritan sat together in the laboratory making their plans; the
  first suggestion came from Thomas Stanley.</p>

  <p>"You must send away your wife, her sister, and the two children. This
  sacrifice is not required of you. Have you friends or relations anywhere
  near?"</p>

  <p>The Rector thought of the uncle in Yorkshire, Mr. Beilby, who would very
  gladly receive Kate, Bessie, and the children.</p>

  <p>"Let the woman who has been so faithful&mdash;Ann Trickett&mdash;go with
  them."</p>

  <p>"It might be," smiled the Rector, "that I should never see any of them
  again."</p>

  <p>"I do not disguise that you, as well as myself and perhaps everyone in
  this village, are doomed. It is because of the great danger that I advise you
  to send these women and children away."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done, they shall go within two days. Though it is difficult
  now to get carriages and horses, since none who can avoid it come to Eyam,
  still there is a coach and there are horses at the old Manor Hall, and I
  think the Corbyns would not begrudge me the use of them."</p>

  <p>"When you have sent away your dear ones," continued the dissenter, "we
  must make our plans like good generals. The pest-hut on the green must be
  enlarged and more women employed to serve there." "If such can be found."</p>

  <p>"Such can be. They will obey me," replied Mr. Stanley. "Then such houses
  as have been deeply affected, where all the family has died, must be shut up
  and fires burnt in the streets as they were in London. Some physicians say
  that coal-fires are better, and some prefer wood. But as here we have no coal
  and but little wood, we must use what we can get. And such rags, furniture,
  and mattresses from infected houses as we have will serve to feed the flames.
  All these people must be put upon strict rules. Brandy and strong waters must
  be forbidden, for those who drink them catch the plague the sooner. We must
  engage more stout fellows to dig graves, and if death continues at this rate,
  we must dig a pit in the churchyard and put them all in as they did in London
  and even in Derby. We must have a cart and a horse and warning bell, and we
  must have one who goes about and writes 'God have mercy upon us' on such
  houses as have the disease that the others may take heed."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stanley made these statements with an authority and a decision that
  showed he had been long thinking out the case, and the Rector looked at him
  with admiration. But he added quietly:</p>

  <p>"There is one thing, friend, that you have not thought of, and that is
  that no one, when I have sent my family away, must leave this place, lest we
  spread the infection over the whole of Derbyshire."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that we can induce these people to remain where they are?
  Many have fled already, too many."</p>

  <p>"None of the gentry are left in the district," admitted the Rector. "But
  there are still something near five hundred people in the village and the
  surrounding farms, and I propose to tell them that they must stay where they
  are. I believe they will obey me, even though they know that they might save
  their lives by flying." The dissenter's eyes flashed encouragement. Such a
  scheme, heroically bold, appealed to his stern nature. He had the temperament
  of a martyr, self-sacrifice delighted him.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps together we can do it," he remarked thoughtfully. "I have some
  influence, as you have seen, with these people. We might put a cordon round
  the village and the outlying farms, beyond which they must not go. Though we
  were all to die here, it would be a triumph."</p>

  <p>"There are provisions and medicines to be thought of," said the Rector.
  "How are we to obtain those?"</p>

  <p>"We must, somehow, get a message to Chatsworth. One might go who was
  healthy and properly fumigated, and we might arrange that on some stone, say
  the well above Middleton Dell, or that heathen altar, provisions were placed
  in return for money. The coins could be placed in running water, or vinegar.
  My Lord's physician might come and give us directions across the stream. All
  that could be contrived without delay or difficulty. For such as have
  business or trade in other parts of the district, they must be told to delay
  all such matters until the plague be stayed."</p>

  <p>"A regiment of soldiers," remarked the Rector, "could not keep these
  people in, there are so many ways of leaving Eyam&mdash;by the moors or the
  dells or the mountain paths."</p>

  <p>"No," replied the dissenter, "we shall not employ a regiment of soldiers,
  but the fear of God."</p>

  <p>A considerable comfort had come over the Rector's spirit since he had
  entered into a friendship and an alliance with Thomas Stanley. He felt, in a
  strange way, set aside from mean doubts and querulous fears and protected,
  and though the meaning and continuance of this scourge was a mystery to him,
  still his own part therein seemed now clear. It was with a courage that he
  had not shown for several days that he went into Kate's bedroom; since his
  late great fatigue he had slept in his closet and Kate had taken the two
  children to sleep with her; she was still proud with life and love.</p>

  <p>The hired woman had gone to her people and there was only Ann Trickett to
  help with the house, and the shadow seemed to thicken on the dulled home,
  even when the sun shone.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson thought: 'How this cloud has come between us! It is almost
  as if we were divorced.' And as he had felt so often a gloomy mist between
  himself and his God, so he felt, and had indeed felt for some time since, a
  darkness between himself and his wife.</p>

  <p>Since the first outbreak of the plague and the flight of Jack Corbyn his
  pleasant family life had been disturbed; since the death of Jack Corbyn poor
  Bess, a widow, as it were, before she was a bride, had been completely
  broken; all was jangled.</p>

  <p>The Rector was amazed now to think that he should ever have complained
  about the dullness of Eyam or drawn contrast between the life here and the
  comfort, nay, the splendour he had enjoyed at Rufford Park. He was smitten
  because of his own ingratitude. He tried to put all these private feelings at
  the back of his mind, and standing beside his wife he told her that Thomas
  Stanley had come to live at the Rectory and to help with the onslaught of the
  plague. She answered quietly that she was glad, for she thought the dissenter
  was a good, brave and able man.</p>

  <p>"Bessie likes him, too," added Kate, looking at her sleeping babes, so
  peaceful in their little cots of wickerwork, with the coverlets and curtains
  she had made herself. And she asked if Mr. Stanley, who seemed to her an
  experienced person, knew of any fresh treatment for the plague.</p>

  <p>The Rector turned aside, he did not like to meet the hope that had been
  lit in her eyes and that he knew he was bound to quench.</p>

  <p>"No, dear heart, Mr. Thomas Stanley knows no more than I do. At least, I
  do not think he has studied the matter so deeply. He has experimented with
  the same drugs and medical antidotes, the same fumigants. He suggests that we
  light fires in the streets as long as we have materials. But while we lack
  wood for coffins, I do not like to use it for this purpose. He suggests,
  also, that we should add another hut to the plague-house on the green, get
  some more women to work there. There are those, who have had the plague
  slightly or come from houses where it has been and have not been infected,
  who might be willing."</p>

  <p>"I will go among them to-morrow," said Kate, "and ask them."</p>

  <p>"No, Kate, you will go nowhere in Eyam to-morrow," said the Rector firmly.
  And he told her of the plans he had made with the dissenter to send her,
  Bessie, Ann Trickett and the children away to Mr. Beilby, in York City; he
  bade her make everything ready, to fold up and pack the children's wardrobe,
  putting a fumigant between the garments, to provide each with a pomander and
  a bottle of spirit and a bottle of water and to write a letter to her
  uncle.</p>

  <p>"I shall write one, too, Kate. There is not time to advise him of our
  plans, but I am sure that our little ones will receive a welcome. For what
  they may cost him, I will be responsible. George is old enough to have some
  schooling now and your uncle might look out for a learned man in York who
  could do this for us."</p>

  <p>The Rector spoke of this matter to please and distract Kate, but he saw at
  once that this little subterfuge was useless, for she was not listening.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm a selfish, hard-hearted woman!" she exclaimed. "I should be so
  thankful to see my children so safe from danger, yet I can do nothing but
  grieve."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Kate," said William Mompesson tenderly, "we can none of us do
  anything but grieve at this moment of dreadful affliction. Yet you may take
  comfort and retire from this cold, rude place with a good heart, knowing that
  nothing but our duties divide us, Kate, and our affections keep us close
  together. I shall write to you often. Neither malice nor neglect must come
  between us! Kate, don't cry! York is not so far away."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to York. You waste your words. I made my vows to
  you&mdash;'until death do us part'&mdash;do you remember that, Mompesson?
  Well, it is not death yet. The children shall go, and Bessie and Ann
  Trickett, but I shall remain."</p>

  <p>He saw her lips tremble, her bosom swell, her eyes become moist. Never,
  even when she had been younger and more beautiful than she was now, had she
  seemed so lovely to him. His whole spirit felt refreshed as a fountain that
  is dry and receives a fresh gush from the ground; the cloud between them
  cracked and showed vital gold.</p>

  <p>"Would you stay with me, Kate?" he asked; then putting a stern restraint
  on his emotion, he hurried on to tell her of the great danger she would be
  in, and of how neither he nor Thomas Stanley thought there was any hope of
  the abatement of the plague, nor could they see any means to stay it. And he
  repeated to her the resolve they had made&mdash;that all should be begged to
  stay in Eyam, "save only those, like yourself, my heart's delight, who come
  from houses not yet infected and who wish to go at once. Any mother or old
  person or child may leave, and I will give them all help."</p>

  <p>She made a sign for him to cease.</p>

  <p>"The children go to-morrow with Bessie and Ann Trickett. Say no more, my
  place is here, and you know it. Do you think I am such an easy, light
  creature that I could leave you now? Were our vows mere stage and show? Do
  you think fear could eclipse my heart?" She rose and put her small hands on
  his shoulders; her tired eyes searched his face.</p>

  <p>"You may be ill yourself, you look already worn. I know you suffer. I am
  so glad you have the help of this good man, Mr. Stanley. I can help, too,
  though I am young and inexperienced and little. I can nurse and go among the
  women, and when I am free from my own children, I can look after those of
  others."</p>

  <p>He put his arms round her, unable to speak, and for a space they clung
  together, hardly able to believe that this terror had overtaken them in their
  harmlessness, when all life lay before them, a fair, fresh field.</p>

  <p>But she would not be moved; he could not force her away against her will.
  And he did not know even if he was in the right in trying to move her.</p>

  <p>"To be away from you," she whispered, while he held her close, "is to be
  dead alive. I should be like a body without its soul. I should be blind and
  deaf and dumb! Mompesson, it cannot be! I am no spruce wanton to fade when
  sorrow comes. He who binds and loosens death will help me to be strong."</p>

  <p>"But can you endure to part with the children?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer, but kissed him wildly, and he was quite spent with
  love and pity and wished for the ease of sleep, safe from passion, corruption
  and fear.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson put the case to his colleague, and Thomas Stanley agreed
  that Kate's place, if she so chose, was in the Rectory by her husband's side.
  But there was no question but that Bessie and the children must go. He
  himself, being a resolute man of action, made the arrangements within a few
  hours.</p>

  <p>He went to the old Manor Hall and engaged the servant in charge there to
  lend the carriage and horses in this matter of emergency. He spoke to Ann
  Trickett and to Bessie and both readily agreed to take the children to York.
  Ann made no comment; Bessie said she perceived a divided loyalty, but she
  would go with the children and try to be a mother to them. All was a mystery
  to her; she was glad to have a plain duty to perform.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Stanley went to the Rector's study and wrote out fairly a placard
  to affix to the churchyard porch. And this, which he got the Rector to sign,
  stated that the two children, the sister-in-law and the maidservant of
  William Mompesson were leaving the next day for York City, because of the
  plague, and if there were any other young children or young mothers into
  whose houses the sickness had not yet come, they were invited to leave the
  village themselves or to send their babes away, and all help would be given
  them in the hire of horses or waggons and the provision of lodging for them
  in some distant farms, if they had no friends of their own.</p>

  <p>But for the rest of the inhabitants, all those into whose homes the plague
  had already come, and all who were not young, having children, or being with
  child, were required to come to the church that evening, as the Rector had to
  speak to them on the matter of the scourge that had afflicted Eyam.</p>

  <p>Such of the villagers as could read had spelt out the placard by midday
  and told it to the others, so that there was a fairly large crowd to see
  William Mompesson's children depart.</p>

  <p>Contrary to the Rector's expectations, none seemed willing to send their
  children away. The mothers would not part with them and feared the dangers
  that might be beyond their native village more than they feared the plague.
  He had noticed before how isolated these people were from the outer world,
  and how they dreaded and disliked anyone, even from Bakewell, as a foreigner.
  They were extremely jealous of their descent and the entire village consisted
  of perhaps no more than six or seven families who constantly inter-married;
  therefore, even at this crisis, they were loth to trust their children to
  strangers. And the only women that were willing, and even these were somewhat
  reluctant to send their children away, were those in whose homes the plague
  had already been; and these the Rector would not allow to depart.</p>

  <p>But such of them as were not at work in the mines or fields&mdash;and
  every day there were less and less of these through sickness and the
  apprehension of sickness&mdash;had gathered round the low churchyard wall
  under the golden linden trees and watched the carriage from the old Manor
  Hall and Ann Trickett, in her best gown and hood and scarf, and Bessie in a
  black mourning dress with white bands, and the two children come out of the
  Rectory and enter the carriage that was driven by Corbyn's old coachman.</p>

  <p>There was not very much baggage, for there was but little accommodation
  for it&mdash;only the children's toys, puppets and animals, made of cloth and
  wool, were put into the carriage with the children as were their wicker
  cradles, their bedding and their baskets of clothes.</p>

  <p>Little George in his blue tiffany suit was excited by the novelty of a
  long drive and by the tales his mother had told him of the splendours of York
  and the treatment he would have from his uncle, who would surely give him a
  fair entertainment. But little Bessie cried at leaving her father and mother
  and had to be lifted into the carriage with her rosy fists in her eyes; she
  was pale and pretty as a primrose; a heavy pomander hung from her neck.</p>

  <p>The curious, sullen villagers watched the sisters cling together, Bessie
  and Kate, with their sunk cheeks pressing close. Ann Trickett seemed
  cheerful, as if she too enjoyed the prospect of an escape from this place
  that was always dull and now plague-stricken.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson spoke as cheerful words as he could find and kissed the
  travellers gravely and with a passionate sincerity. Bessie put the letters to
  Mr. Beilby in her bosom and Ann Trickett had the responsibility of the money
  that would be required for the journey. So, in little commonplaces and
  exclamations and running to and fro, the departure took place.</p>

  <p>As soon as the little party started, Kate ran to an upper window to stare
  at the carriage, but it was soon out of sight. She came down the stairs again
  and without a word either to her husband or to those gathered about the gate,
  crossed the churchyard where the graves now lay so thickly. In the corner
  known as the plague spot, she entered the church and went up to the belfry by
  the stairs the ringers used on Sunday and that she had never trodden
  before.</p>

  <p>She had been very quick and had apprised none of her intentions so that
  she was not followed. Her husband had soon discovered what she would be at
  and pityingly bade the people leave her alone; she was light of foot and
  agile and not likely to come to mischief.</p>

  <p>Kate Mompesson went up the stairway, until she came to the top part of the
  tower where the four bells hung, the first, third, and fourth being inscribed
  with the mottoes: '<i>Jesus be our speed</i>,' and the dates severally of
  '1590,' '1618,' '1628,' while the second had the date '1618' and was
  inscribed: '<i>God save this church</i>.'</p>

  <p>The belfry was large, there was room for ten bells, though Eyam had never
  been able to afford more than these four that gave out rich and deep-toned
  peals when rung by the six men and boys employed as ringers.</p>

  <p>Kate took no heed of these bells, but moved to the small lancet-shaped
  window and there gazed over the village, across the little houses, the old
  lych-gate, the stream at the western end and at the rude highway that wound
  over the heath beyond.</p>

  <p>The coach went slowly over the uneven ground, the stout horse struggling
  in the shafts, the coachman driving carefully.</p>

  <p>Kate impressed every detail on her mind&mdash;the long whip, the curling
  thong, the boot behind from which the luggage hung clumsily, Bessie leaning
  from the window and waving to the villagers, and now George's red-gold head
  and now that of his sister, Bessie, showing. To her failing eyes the carriage
  grew smaller and smaller, until it was no larger than the picture in the
  initial letter in her old Prayer Book.</p>

  <p>And then she gave a loud cry that was lost in the boughs of the linden
  trees, and beat her head against the stone wall, for she was sure that she
  would never see them again. Angels might be with them, but she would not. Her
  life seemed purposeless; she felt wasted as a glass of water poured on the
  sand.</p>

  <p>Two more cases of the plague were reported that evening; Thomas Stanley
  visited one of these and William Mompesson the other, before they attended
  the meeting that had been called in the church.</p>

  <p>The medical treatment the two men employed was the same; it was the best
  that they knew of after studying so earnestly such books and such knowledge
  as was available to them. When the fever was declared they gave some soothing
  medicine such as the plague-waters of Matthias, though they no longer used
  bark after the Rector's unfortunate experience. Various elixirs that
  Mompesson compounded in his laboratory were also administered. Then, when the
  plague spots appeared, these were dressed with ointment, and if the patient
  lived long enough, they were cut and cleansed and bandaged with further
  anointings.</p>

  <p>To break the tumours they sometimes used the prescription of the College
  of Physicians, which was: 'Take a great onion, hollow it, put in a fig, rue
  cut small, and a dram of Venice treacle; put it, close stopped, in a wet
  paper and roast it in the embers. Apply hot to the tumour. Make three or
  four, one after another; let one he three hours.'</p>

  <p>But they had to omit the fig from the prescription as these fruits were
  not to be obtained in Eyam.</p>

  <p>Tobacco was much used and the supply in the village was running short, for
  such as could obtain it chewed or smoked it continually, for Mr. Mompesson
  heard that none in London who kept tobacco shops had the plague and that the
  school at Eton had been spared, because every schoolboy, however young, had
  smoked a pipe.</p>

  <p>They also used some of the recipes recommended by the Paracelsists or
  Chemical Physicians, though they seemed to Mr. Stanley altogether too
  mystical. A remedy that had been taught to the people by Mother Sydall was
  much used secretly. It was made by roasting a dead toad over a vessel of
  yellow wax and smearing the fat on the sores.</p>

  <p>But, despite all this care, precaution, skill and quackery, very few of
  the patients recovered, though some lingered as many as twelve days and a
  number to five or six days. But the clergyman knew that many remedies were
  resorted to besides those that they themselves sanctioned. Not alone Mother
  Sydall, the witch, but other so-called wise men and women, herbalists and
  hermits, who dwelt upon the moors, were consulted and many strange and
  horrible concoctions were brought in secret to the sick beds. There were also
  many crude operations performed, such as cutting the carbuncles too soon, so
  that the patients died under the agony. Or making gashes in the sound flesh
  for the infection to escape, so that many limped about wounded with green or
  cankered wounds.</p>

  <p>The church was full, the door being set wide so that those who could not
  obtain admission might stand in the outer air and hear the Rector's
  speech.</p>

  <p>He gave first a brief discourse on the text: 'But go thou thy way to the
  end, for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the day,' that
  was often in his mind.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson spoke to his people of how brief and, as it were worthless,
  was the longest and most splendid life. He declared that it was but a little
  play before eternity and given to us as a time to prepare for Heaven, and
  that those who had the most crosses and afflictions in this life were likely
  to get the highest rewards, when His bright face should beam upon the
  righteous.</p>

  <p>And he spoke of the Judgment Day, when the heavens would be rolled up, and
  night and day end with one loud blast that would rend the deeps. When all the
  dead would arise at a second birth, crowding with those who should be living,
  to the bar of Judgment&mdash;fire would rush from the north to the east and
  sweep up south and west; stars and elements would be confounded and blotted
  out, and God's thunders would play over chaos. And nothing would matter in
  the fateful day but cleanliness from sin.</p>

  <p>So he spoke to them of the worthless vanity of all the lusts of this
  earth, and how it behoved them to do God's will, and to thank Him for any
  crosses He might send.</p>

  <p>And so he came to the main matter of his discourse, which was the
  desolation of Eyam. There was no need for him to describe the ravages to
  them, for they had seen it for themselves. Some of those who were there had
  been sick and recovered, some had lost relatives and friends, others had left
  sufferers from the scourge at home or in the pest-house, a few yards from
  them lay the graves of those who died from the plague.</p>

  <p>Therefore Mr. Mompesson said nothing of the scourge, but he reminded them
  that they were all in God's hands, and that nothing they could do could save
  those who were marked and that those who were protected could walk immune
  among the fiercest contagion.</p>

  <p>"It may be that you or I, or my wife or your wife, will be the next. But
  we must go on and do our part, each of us."</p>

  <p>So, in view of the judgment visited upon them, he exhorted them to be
  industrious and sober and Godfearing, to have no wallowing in impure thoughts
  and scurrilous conceits, for the day might be at hand when every idle word
  should be accounted for, and how desperate then should be the condition of
  those who, instead of grace and life, had thought only of sin and death! And
  in this moment of terror to leave piety and sobriety would be an inexcusable
  desertion. But those who would conduct themselves soberly might remember that
  a door would be opened for them in Heaven.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson here paused and looked round the faces of his congregation.
  There had been a hush among them while he spoke, and their countenances, some
  brutal, some simple, some comely and some vile, had been tense in expression.
  As they crowded together in the chancel and aisles, they stood pressed round
  the ancient stone font, lead lined, where most of them had been christened,
  and leaned into that aperture in the north aisle through which, legend said,
  the confession of sins was whispered in ancient times; the common people, and
  this was an unheard-of thing, were even in the pews of the gentry, which had
  long since been empty.</p>

  <p>All the one-time ornaments of the church had been removed by the Puritans,
  many by the zealous hands of Thomas Stanley himself, but there still remained
  the grotesque figure of a Talbot, or dog, on one of the wooden cross-beams,
  the crest of the arms of the Earls of Shrewsbury, formerly Lords of the Manor
  of Eyam and patrons of the village. While in one of the windows a few
  fragments of coloured glass had been suffered, through disdain, to remain,
  and the July sunlight falling on these cast blurs of gold, blue and red on
  the tense, anxious faces below.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson, in his black gown and white bands, stood silent with his
  fine fingers on the edge of the pulpit, as if speech had suddenly failed him,
  and looked down on the stout figure of the dissenter, who stood below him,
  against the pulpit.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson felt he had obtained an added strength from this man's
  presence, and the fact that Thomas Stanley was by his side had served to
  overawe and impress the villagers, who seemed to listen to him with a deeper
  respect than ever before.</p>

  <p>He felt suddenly weary, fatigue, like a great wave, swept over and
  drenched his spirit. There was much more he had to say, indeed he had not
  come to the crucial part of his argument, but he stammered and could not put
  his words together. And then stepping, almost stumbling, down from the
  pulpit, he touched the dissenter on the shoulder and said:</p>

  <p>"You speak to them."</p>

  <p>'If this is blasphemy,' he thought, 'surely God will forgive me.' He
  remembered thankfully that Heaven had permitted Thomas Stanley for many years
  to preach in that pulpit.</p>

  <p>With only a slight inclination of his head as acknowledgment, the
  dissenter at once mounted the humble pulpit. His sunken, wrinkled, yet still
  keen eyes flashed at once to the three letters, 'I.H.S.,' on one of the beams
  before him. Though he was no scholar he knew the three Latin words they stood
  for: 'Jesus Hominum Salvator'&mdash;and they had often been his encouragement
  and his inspiration.</p>

  <p>He spoke briefly with none of the emotion and flowery, if faltering,
  phrases that William Mompesson used.</p>

  <p>"I have been asked by the present Rector of Eyam to help him in this
  affliction, and we have decided to remain together in the village and do what
  we can for those who suffer both in soul and body. And we have decided to ask
  you all to remain enclosed here, dying like true soldiers at your post,
  sooner than carry the disease far afield.</p>

  <p>"We have asked you to be soldiers, and we are prepared ourselves to be
  generals. We have thought out our plan, for the nursing of the sick, the
  tending of the sound, the burial of the dead.</p>

  <p>"A messenger went to-day to my Lord at Chatsworth, and he will send
  supplies, both of food, medicines and such other things as may be needed. We
  shall ask for voluntary workers, some to serve in the pest-house, some to
  bury the dead. And, as there is no longer sufficient wood for coffins and no
  labourers to make them, from henceforth the dead will be buried in their
  shrouds only. And until happier times, there will be no headstones, but all
  will be placed in a pit in the churchyard so that one burial service may be
  said over several.</p>

  <p>"And so we shall await God's judgment."</p>

  <p>A shudder passed through the congregation; one heard again some of the
  women begin to weep, bowing their heads on those near them. Another one near
  the door fell down and cried out and was passed from one hand to another into
  the open air.</p>

  <p>The scene began to flicker before William Mompesson's tired eyes. He saw
  the broad beams of golden sunlight coming through the open doorway, the
  breath of fresh air mingling with the fetid breath of the people, their
  sweating odours, and the sickly and acrid fumes of the vinegar and spices
  they used. He saw those squares of colour from the glass and wondered idly
  why Thomas Stanley had not removed that as he had removed every other
  beautiful object from the church.</p>

  <p>The young man despised himself for the faintness that was upon him, he
  remembered that he had eaten very little food that day. The scene of the
  morning was impressed on his vision and seemed more real than that which
  surrounded him&mdash;the carriage going away with the children, Bessie and
  Ann Trickett, and Kate running from him and hastening up to the belfry to get
  a last look at her children; when she had returned she had said to him: "I am
  sure I shall never see them again." And he had tried to argue her out of such
  uncomfortable thoughts, but with little feeling in his words.</p>

  <p>He tried to see her now, she was seated somewhere in that press, too faint
  to stand, on a rush chair by a pillar. His soul revolted against the task put
  upon him&mdash;his Kate even now breathing in the infection.</p>

  <p>Why had he been sent here? Why had this sacrifice been asked of him? He
  wanted to go, to leave this accursed place, these people whom he had never
  liked and who demanded of him now his life's blood and that of his
  beloved.</p>

  <p>He heard the harsh voice of the dissenter droning on overhead, talking,
  instructing the people, for though he had put the case to them briefly
  enough, he must now expand and embroider it with many texts and allusions of
  moralizing. And the gaping, sweating villagers stood listening, as intent and
  overawed as if an angel spoke to them.</p>

  <p>When at last Thomas Stanley left the pulpit, the people stirred and sighed
  and groaned and began to talk among themselves, and so streamed out into the
  sunlight and stood among the graves discussing the matter.</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley spoke to none of them, but went to the Cross that was so
  old that it was supposed to have been cut in heathen times and the Christian
  carvings now on it placed there at a later date. Such as they were, they were
  of Popish origin, and Thomas Stanley had at one time thought of defacing
  them. But he had decided to let them be, arguing that they had been placed
  there by a pious hand; but he had been severe on those whom he had found
  creeping out at night to kneel in prayer before these figures that
  represented the Virgin and Child.</p>

  <p>On the arms of the Cross were spirits blowing trumpets and others holding
  crosses and books. On the side were knots, and whatever any Rector,
  Nonconformist or Church of England, might say or do, the villagers regarded
  this Cross with as much awe as indeed, in secret, they regarded the gray
  stones that seemed to be of a like ancestry upon the moors.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson and Thomas Stanley took their position against the
  shaft, and here it was Stanley who spoke again.</p>

  <p>Raising his bony hand he cried out gravely:</p>

  <p>"Let those who are willing to abide by what we have decided and to promise
  to remain in the village within a distance that we shall mark out, come
  forward, give his or her name and swear to observe this pact, which I take to
  be made with God Almighty Himself."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a moment and Mompesson, with his tired eyes glancing
  over these rude people, some of whom he knew to be savage, cruel and vicious,
  thought: 'Why should they thus doom themselves to save strangers?'</p>

  <p>Then one or two of the better sort began to argue together and put forward
  as a spokesman the carpenter, who was supported by Sythe Torre; this man,
  towering above his fellows, seemed to be in better spirits than any there.
  The carpenter, coming forward cap in hand, asked the two clergymen if they
  could answer for it that the plague was carried by one person to another?</p>

  <p>"For it seems," said he humbly, "that nothing is certain about the pest.
  And that even you learned gentlemen..."</p>

  <p>"Not learned," protested Mompesson faintly under his breath; but Thomas
  Stanley made no demur.</p>

  <p>"You learned gentlemen," continued the carpenter, fearful at the sound of
  his own voice before so many people, "do not know much of the nature of this
  plague, nor even how it came to Eyam, though there is talk of a box of
  clothes..." He paused, then picked up his words again: "What I mean, reverend
  sirs, is&mdash;if we were to stay here, making the promise that is required
  of us, could we be assured that we spared others and kept the plague here
  instead of spreading it over maybe the whole of the Peak?"</p>

  <p>"Can you answer them, Mr. Stanley?" asked Mr. Mompesson. "For myself,
  though I have studied the matter, I have to confess to a great
  ignorance."</p>

  <p>"My ignorance is great too," said the dissenter, but with relish. "But
  this I am certain of, and you can judge it for yourself&mdash;that the
  disease is passed from one to another, and if we all remain enclosed here and
  refuse to go abroad and have any trade or truck with the outside world, then
  surely, even though we all die at our posts, we shall prevent it from
  spreading in Derbyshire. Though if it slay us all it can but slay five or six
  hundred souls, yet if it get spread through the Peak it may slay as many
  thousands. And leaping on its course may waste the north."</p>

  <p>"That is enough, sir," said the carpenter without a pause, "and I for my
  part am prepared to make this pact."</p>

  <p>"And I! And I!" came the voices of his fellows behind him. They pushed up
  through the docks and nettles that had grown round the ancient shaft and one
  by one they made their promise and took their oath. Those who had left their
  families at home gave the promise for them also.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stanley seemed to accept this ready sacrifice as a matter of course,
  but William Mompesson was profoundly moved.</p>

  <p>Before the meeting was over, three of those who were there fell down with
  the plague and were carried to the pest-house, upon which many began shouting
  hymns in a light-hearted manner.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; RUDE, BARREN HOURS</h2>

  <p class="first">'THIS is worse than death,' thought Catherine Mompesson,
  'for death means that something ends.' And she straightened her aching back
  and with a hand coarsened from much bathing with rough soap and water and
  vinegar, put back the tousled hair from her eyes.</p>

  <p>The day was so hot, and it seemed noisome, too, so that she half-believed
  what her husband declared was a whimsy, that the contagion was in the air and
  did not pass from person to person.</p>

  <p>She leant, hand to head, against the mullions of the kitchen window; she
  was overborne with toil, for since Bessie and Ann Trickett went away, she had
  had all the household work to do herself with but little assistance, for such
  women as did not have their own families to tend were employed in the
  pest-house or in nursing those who were threatened by sickness. Sythe Torre's
  wife came in now and then to help Kate, but for the rest she did all herself,
  save for the drawing of water, a task that one of the men performed for her
  when he could.</p>

  <p>She did more, too, than her own housework. Her husband had shown her how
  to help in preparing the medical remedies he used. She must cut up, too, even
  those fine linen sheets that had been given her by Lady Savile into strips
  for bandages. She made soups and jellies that were sent to the poor and these
  she distributed herself as far as her strength was able.</p>

  <p>The whole of her life thus had an unnatural cast, all the sweet ordered
  simplicity had gone. Again and again she wondered if this was a punishment
  for her ingratitude in complaining when first she came to the loneliness of
  Eyam.</p>

  <p>This evening she felt the desolation of her household&mdash;her children,
  Ann Trickett and Bessie all gone, and her husband as good as gone, for she
  saw but little of him. And every time that she did see him she looked at him
  in terror for fear she would see the marks of the plague on his face. But she
  knew that he considered himself immune, even as he considered her
  protected.</p>

  <p>But this horror she would not express and hugged to herself a wild hope
  that a man of God, doing godly work, might be spared. Yet the hope was indeed
  but wild and alternated with fits of despair so that her soul was in a
  continual torment. There was no longer the pleasant routine, the elegance of
  music, of song, the fine conversation that had once continued for hours in
  the Rectory. All that Catherine Mompesson could do was to have food ready
  when her husband and Thomas Stanley were able to eat it. And food was scarce
  too, and much of it looked on with suspicion, for there were many different
  and firm convictions as to how the infection went. Some thought it was in
  meat, and others blamed overripe fruit, and the Rector himself declared that
  a spare diet was good.</p>

  <p>So Kate kept soups, bread, honey and milk, for neither of the men would
  touch wine or spirits, ready on her buffet.</p>

  <p>She gazed out into the orchard&mdash;the apples were ripe among the
  curling grey leaves, the August sun was in a thick haze of gold above the
  beehives, the grass grew knee-high round the red wall that divided the
  orchard from the garden, there was a heavy, sickly sweetness in the air.</p>

  <p>Kate felt drowsy, even her anguish numbed&mdash;she wished only for
  repose. The yearning for her children had become an obsession with her.
  Sometimes, when she was alone in this empty, despoiled house, she had been
  able to forget them for hours together, but now their images were
  ever-present to her mind. She had not yet had a letter from York, indeed it
  was too soon for her to have received news from that city. But every day when
  the messenger went to the stone where letters for Eyam would be placed, she
  waited eagerly at the door of the Rectory in the foolish hope that somehow
  Bessie might have sent a word of their progress.</p>

  <p>The Lord-Lieutenant had sent his commendation and admiration of the action
  of Mr. Mompesson and had taken upon himself to give the dissenter, Thomas
  Stanley, leave to remain in the village and help during the plague. The Earl
  had also undertaken to supply the village with what it required in the way of
  medicines, goods and foods. These were taken at night and left on the stones
  on the heath that were supposed to be a heathen altar, or on the well at the
  head of Middleton Dell.</p>

  <p>Those who had private purchases to make left their orders and their money,
  both well soaked in vinegar, on the stone. In this way, too, letters were
  exchanged.</p>

  <p>My Lord's physician came once again to the stream that ran out of the
  grounds of Chatsworth into the dale near the village, and with the running
  water between him and Mr. Mompesson or Mr. Stanley, as the case might be,
  gave advice and directions. Yet these, as poor Kate knew, amounted to very
  little, for her husband had as much knowledge as the wise physician at
  Chatsworth. Though now and then some remedy that had been tried in London or
  Derby was given by the physician in the hopes that it might prove efficacious
  in Eyam.</p>

  <p>But Kate, like many another in the village, relied also upon spells and
  charms. She carried round her neck on cords beneath her gown a charm that had
  been given her by old Mother Sydall; and before she rose in the morning and
  before she went to bed she repeated an incantation that had been taught her
  by the old woman. But nothing could cast out fear; waking and dreaming,
  Catherine Mompesson was a haunted woman.</p>

  <p>She roused herself from her apathy and fatigue and left the window,
  looking round the kitchen, which was so different now from what it had been
  under the reign of Ann Trickett. There was much that was awry, for Catherine
  had little skill in housewifery arts; she did not like to see the disorder,
  but she had not the strength to remedy it. She had never been in her life
  before so coarsely dressed&mdash;her gown was of drugget, draggled at the
  bottom from going in and out of the house into the yard and throwing water
  and bending down to clean. Her hands were coarse, her face drawn, it was long
  since she had bathed, perfumed and curled her hair, which had been her great
  pride.</p>

  <p>All her limbs ached, and when she sat down it was small relief; even when
  stretched in bed she had little repose from her great fatigue.</p>

  <p>Slowly she went up the shallow stairway; through the windows that gave on
  to the garden beams of thick yellow sunshine fell and in them the motes
  danced merrily. Bent from her weariness, with one hand supporting herself
  against the wainscot of the panelled wall, she went along the corridor to the
  room the children had used and looked at the empty place where their cots had
  been and at the cupboard where they had kept their toys and at the press
  where their clothes had hung.</p>

  <p>She knew this room so well, every inch of it, every detail of it,
  everything that had been in it was a personal matter to her. She had not
  known till they had gone away how the children had involved themselves with
  every fibre of her life.</p>

  <p>Kate shut the door resolutely, blaming herself for being a coward because
  her children were safe and she could not rejoice at it. She had to remind
  herself of that&mdash;They are safe! they are happy! they will even forget
  me! They will not pine, they are too young. She went then into her own room,
  which was much neglected. She had almost come to the end of her sheets, and
  pillows and bolster-cases, so much bandaging was required, for the bandages
  must not be used twice however carefully washed, but burnt in the fires that
  were kept glowing in the streets.</p>

  <p>The young woman thought dully: 'They must ask my Lord for more linen.'</p>

  <p>It was but a short time ago that she would have been distressed to part
  with her store of fine sheets, so many worked by her fine hand. But this loss
  no longer concerned her. She opened her press in her tired, fumbling way and
  took out nightgowns, chemises, petticoats and cambrics. Bent wearily in a
  chair she began to pull the seams apart and to slit them in strips, using the
  scissors that hung at her waist. When the strips were made she rolled them,
  dividing the end, and tied them in little bundles.</p>

  <p>This was the hour that Catherine Mompesson put aside for meditation and
  under her husband's instructions tried to put herself into communication with
  God. She did not find this easy, her mind was too distracted with worldly
  affairs and worldly terrors. God seemed to her an impenetrable mystery; she
  could not fathom His Will, she dared not question it. Yet her belief was
  simple and profound. She had not a sceptical nor a challenging spirit; she
  was convinced of the reality of Heaven and Hell; she believed that the stars
  lit the angels and that God had His throne beyond the sun, that the world was
  a land of darkness and blind eyes, that a painted veil was drawn over the
  glorious moon of God.</p>

  <p>But how to feel that this belief was a living, comforting thing, how to
  trust herself to God's mercy when He had shown so little?</p>

  <p>She thought of the dead whom she had seen die in Eyam, she who had never
  looked upon death before. Those who with cries and groans and rolling eyes
  and hideous sweats had died in the pest-house, pallid children, the
  ashy-cheeked babes whom she had seen in the cottages! Why did God permit this
  slaughter?</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley had spoken of a judgment on the village, but though
  Catherine Mompesson did not dare to murmur at the words, she thought that a
  judgment on these poor souls was like checking a wilful child at its
  play.</p>

  <p>'Should I make a judgment on Bessie and George for some little thing they
  did amiss in their innocence and ignorance?'</p>

  <p>Foul men, the dissenter said, had driven the angels away from Eyam, and
  Catherine believed that he referred to the villagers' return to the church.
  Between him and the Rector was always this cleavage of religious belief,
  although they agreed not to speak of it in the present hour of distress.</p>

  <p>Here again Catherine was bemused and bewildered. Both her husband and the
  dissenter seemed to her holy men, she knew them brave and admirable, perhaps
  saintly. And each claimed to be in communion with God, yet they regarded one
  another as lost, disobedient, if not damned.</p>

  <p>"It is not for your feminine intellect," the Rector had told her tenderly,
  "to consider such things,"</p>

  <p>He had told her to resign herself meekly and he reminded her, as he always
  reminded his congregation now, that the greater crosses borne on the earth
  the brighter the crowns to be won in Heaven. Yet all this was a thin
  consolation to Kate Mompesson.</p>

  <p>She wanted her worldly life, she wanted her husband, to sleep with, to eat
  with, to talk with, to walk with. She wanted her children about her, and the
  merry gossiping housewifely life, and fine dresses and good food and music.
  Why, she had not touched the virginal since the plague began. She wanted
  these things and she had lost them, and the consolation of a promised
  paradise seemed dim and far away.</p>

  <p>Kate tried to pray. She bent her weary knees and put her tired, trembling
  hands before her worn face and thus in the darkness tried to smooth out her
  disordered life, her restless sorrows, into a sacred calm.</p>

  <p>When she rose she was a little consoled. Her weariness had passed into a
  gloss of tranquillity.</p>

  <p>How lonely and empty the old house seemed! When would the Rector and Mr.
  Stanley return? She had set their food, she had covered the fire so that it
  would be easy to heat the soup.</p>

  <p>Kate moved slowly from the bedroom, down the corridor and down the shallow
  stairs, and then she heard two familiar voices that caused the blood to rush
  into her cheeks&mdash;Ann and Bessie! She could hardly believe this to be the
  dear truth; her step was lighter and her pace quicker than it had been for
  many days as she hastened into the parlour.</p>

  <p>And there stood Bessie and Ann, with their trunks before them. Outside,
  beyond the garden gate, she could see the Corbyns's carriage and the old
  coachman moving away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bess!" she said. "Oh, Bess!"</p>

  <p>And could say no more, but lay and wept passionately on her sister's
  shoulder. Bessie could not speak either; she sobbed too and the two girls sat
  in the window place holding one another tightly, while Ann, who was composed
  and even smiling, gave the story.</p>

  <p>"Did you think, mistress, that we had forsaken you? We would not say that
  we meant to return, for then we feared we should not be let out of the
  village, and the children required minding."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the children, the children!" said Kate. "You should not have left
  them, Bessie. Are they happy, are they well?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, dear heart, they are well and happy."</p>

  <p>And again Ann Trickett took up the story.</p>

  <p>"They are well enough, and happy enough, I warrant, mistress. Why, Mr.
  Beilby is delighted to have them, they are just like two treasures to him.
  And he has a good woman who looks after his house, and two willing maids, and
  the little ones have a fine room and a cupboard full of toys. And there's not
  one case of the plague in York."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you should have stayed. Have you heard what's happened here? Was it
  decided before you went away? I've forgotten," smiled Kate, trying to dry her
  tears. "But we are shut in, you know, none is allowed out."</p>

  <p>"I know that," said Ann Trickett, "they told us as much at Bakewell. They
  said those that went into Eyam now must stay there. But we came back to our
  places. I am sorry, mistress," she added, "that you should have thought
  otherwise of me. And of your own sister!"</p>

  <p>Now Kate Mompesson was roused to a sense of the danger that Bessie ran.
  Her selfish pleasure at seeing her sister vanished into fear.</p>

  <p>"Bess, you should not have come back," she said in deep distress. "The
  plague is terrible. People die every day, yes, every day more. Mr. Stanley
  and Mr. Mompesson are ever on their feet, going from one to another. It may
  be here any moment, nobody knows how the contagion goes. Oh, Bess, I should
  have been happier if you had stayed in York."</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten my condition?" replied Bessie Carr. "Don't you
  understand, Kate, that since Jack died all life's vain to me? I truly hate to
  be staying here below. My one pleasure is that I might be of some service to
  you. There must be something I can do."</p>

  <p>"I'll warrant there's plenty I can do," said Ann Trickett, taking off her
  hood and cloak and flinging them over her arm.</p>

  <p>"Yes," smiled Kate, "I've not done too well in the house for myself. I've
  been so tired, not able to sleep, and no woman can be obtained."</p>

  <p>"I'll soon have things to rights, mistress. I suppose Jonathan Mortin is
  still here&mdash;doesn't he help you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he brings in the water and washes down the floors in the kitchen and
  closets. But there are many things to do, queer things we never thought of
  before. So much to fumigate and the bandages to make. And I help put up the
  medicines. Bess, it is terrible. You know they are burying the dead in sheets
  now, and there's not enough of those because they want them for bandages for
  the sick."</p>

  <p>"Have they made the headstone for Jack?" asked Bess wearily. Her pleasure
  at returning home and seeing Kate again had soon died out, her face was
  fatigued, like her sister she looked ten years more than her age. Both these
  young women seemed benumbed by a long frost of sorrow.</p>

  <p>But Ann left the room and went into the kitchen, which was her own
  peculiar region, and they could hear her moving about, and the clatter of
  pots and pans, the snap of wood as she kindled a fresh fire.</p>

  <p>"It's so hot," sighed Kate, "so hot."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's strange," said Bess, "up here in the mountains. It seems
  hotter than it was down in the valley. Is the infection in the air, do you
  think, Kate?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, dear, no one seems to know! Mompesson is always reading his
  learned books, and Mr. Stanley has his head full of conceits, but between
  them they cannot come to the truth of the matter. Oh, Bess, all I know is
  that people die and die in pain and in agonies. So foul, too. The stench, the
  tremors, the vomiting and the sweat."</p>

  <p>"Let us try to forget it," begged Bess, drawing her sister up to her
  bosom. "Poor Kate! Bathe your face and your hands and comb your hair and we
  will have a little music."</p>

  <p>"Music! I have not played for many a day now! How does one dare? The death
  bell was ever tolling, and now it ceases to toll it is worse still, for one
  knows that funerals come too quick and the bell-ringers have other things to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, Kate, Ann Trickett will get the meals to-night."</p>

  <p>"We have no meals now, Bess, but just put the food aside for Mompesson and
  Mr. Stanley when they come in."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, never mind, remember that the children are safe, there is
  some hope there. But as for me, I have my glance above."</p>

  <p>"Hast thou truly, Bess? I would that I could. Art thou resigned to die and
  join thy Jack in Paradise?"</p>

  <p>"I am resigned."</p>

  <p>She drew her sister to the virginal; it was an old-fashioned instrument
  that had belonged to the girl's grandmother, but was still sweet and pure in
  tone.</p>

  <p>But Kate did not play, her soiled fingers rested languidly on the yellow
  keys.</p>

  <p>"Bessie, do you think that it is our fault, that it is a judgment?"</p>

  <p>"What have we done that there should be a judgment on us?" asked the
  younger sister wildly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. We played with fire, perhaps! Spurned good advice. We never
  thought this could happen, never realized how our souls could ache. Do you
  remember all the glorious deceptions we had, like gilded mists before our
  eyes&mdash;false joys, fantastic flights. How we gave our fond humours their
  wings, all our plays, toys, conceits?"</p>

  <p>"I remember well enough," said Bessie Carr, "the days at Rufford Park and
  Jack's visits and the games we had"; she stared in front of her. "But what
  evil was there in that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Bessie, that there was evil in it. But our eyes were not
  turned to Heaven as they should have been. We were enjoying ourselves on
  earth instead of making haste to be away. And now&mdash;there are the dead
  all around us! You know, when I go upstairs at night, I seem to meet a dead
  man on every tread. And he reminds me how I, even like my toys and games,
  must fain vanish away.</p>

  <p>"I remember when we first came here and I was gathering some early flowers
  in Middleton Dell, and Mr. Stanley met me, and told me that my garland would
  be dead in the morning. But if I wished for one that would not fade, I must
  think of good deeds and Heaven. And I laughed at him then when he told me
  that my pleasures were but a sugared dose of wormwood."</p>

  <p>"Play some music, Kate," said Bessie, "play some music. Do not think so
  sadly. We must pine for home&mdash;which is with God&mdash;you and I. My
  loss, so far at least, is greater than thine. Play a little melody,
  Kate."</p>

  <p>At this appeal the elder sister obeyed, and the thin tinkling notes fell
  in the sweet, thick, golden air. The sun was setting now and low level rays
  fell through the wide parlour windows.</p>

  <p>"Let us think," said Bessie, when Kate dropped her worn hands on the lap
  of her drugget gown, "that we sleep, you and I, and that when we wake we
  shall be happy. And remember, dear, humanly speaking, that the little ones
  are safe."</p>

  <p>There was a step on the threshold, and the Rector stood there,
  astonished.</p>

  <p>"Bessie! Returned!"</p>

  <p>And yet in his inner heart he had thought of this. The girl had gone so
  quietly that he could not believe that she had gone for ever. He knew her
  true heart, she was another like his Kate, staunch and loyal, and grief had
  purged her from her childish follies and affectations.</p>

  <p>So there was not need for much explanation between them. The Rector bade
  her stand away from him, until he had been to his closet and fumigated his
  clothes and washed his hands in vinegar.</p>

  <p>"For I have been in three infected houses this afternoon," he said. "I am
  glad for Kate's sake you have returned, dear Bess."</p>

  <p>"Ann Trickett is here, too, Mompesson," smiled the younger sister. "We
  must all stay together."</p>

  <p>"Jonathan Mortin will be glad to see her. He goes about with me now,
  carrying the medicine chest. I think," added the Rector, with enthusiasm,
  "that God's blessing is on this house, for none of us has been affected, and
  I feel as well as ever I did in my life. And though Kate is a little tired,
  that is from doing the housework, not from any illness."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, and now that Bessie is here, I am tired no more."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mompesson felt inspired by her husband's words. Perhaps God spoke
  through him, and they were really protected, and she dared to bring her
  thoughts from Heaven, which to her was but a dim though golden place, and to
  cast them again on her children and on her future, when they might all be
  together. Surely when the plague was over, she and Mompesson would have done
  their duty by Eyam and they might go away to some other cure that might be in
  the gift of Sir George Savile, or even stay in Rufford Park again, when they
  should be purged of all infection.</p>

  <p>So there was more happiness in the Rectory that evening than there had
  been for some time. And when Mr. Stanley came in, they sat down at a meal
  prepared by Ann Trickett quickly and deftly, and there was a certain peace
  upon them.</p>

  <p>Yet there was a torment in the Rector's heart, too, though he spoke
  cheerfully, for he realized in his state of happiness how he still clung to
  worldly things. What pleasure he got from Kate and Bess and the thought of
  his children and the little tales the younger girl told of the children's
  behaviour upon the road, and of the warm and generous welcome given them by
  Mr. Beilby, and of the kind messages he had sent!</p>

  <p>He thought to himself: 'How my poor short hour, my few wretched sands and
  crumbs of life revolt and flinch at the thought of dispersing. Nay, though
  there's a heavenly crown offered above, still I must grovel here in poor
  joys.'</p>

  <p>He turned his tired eyes to the side cupboard on which stood a large
  hour-glass and watched, as if fascinated, the sands running through. And his
  faith wavered and almost sank as he thought of the death scattered abroad,
  and how any minute there might be a knock at the door and he be summoned to
  yet another who was stricken.</p>

  <p>He heard Bessie's sweet, tired voice say: "Mr. Beilby had heard that to
  make an incision in the leg or arm was efficacious, for the infection would
  run out through the wound." She added that many who lived in York and had
  occasion to go to Derby, where there was the plague, had tried this and had
  not been struck.</p>

  <p>"Did you do it?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"No, I hadn't the courage to make the wound. Besides," she smiled, and all
  could read her thought, which was that she would take no precaution against
  the plague that had slain Jack Corbyn.</p>

  <p>But Kate took her up eagerly. She besought her husband and Mr. Stanley to
  make such an incision in their legs or arms and to keep it open daily.</p>

  <p>The dissenter refused this cowardly precaution as he termed it, but Mr.
  Mompesson said he would oblige his wife's restless hope.</p>

  <p>Words would not suffice Kate Mompesson, but she must see the wound made
  and bind it up herself. So after supper, there being no further call upon
  him, the Rector went with his wife into the study.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson sank down in the great chair with arms; it was a long
  time since he had had any leisure to spend in his library and the room had
  become unfamiliar to him. His head was giddy and waves of fatigue swept over
  his limbs. His head was rested against the uncertain lettering of Kate's
  embroidering of his motto, his eyes were turned unseeingly towards the
  tapestry that with so much pride and pleasure he had garnished the walls with
  little more than a year ago. He could recall through all his weariness those
  petty discontents&mdash;how ashamed he was of them now, when he had first
  come to the Rectory and found it so mean compared to Rufford Park.</p>

  <p>Kate was looking at him with pity touched with terror. He was too tired to
  do more than smile at her, and tried to raise his hand reassuringly.</p>

  <p>He said:</p>

  <p>"Go into the laboratory, Kate, and bring me the little knife by the marble
  slab where I keep the medicines, and some of the yellow ointment and the
  bandage. See, child, this is all to please you. If you wish, I will not do
  it."</p>

  <p>Her face seemed to recede, as objects lose their true perspective, when
  one who is in a fever gazes at them. The figures on the tapestry loomed
  terrific and their meaning suddenly became plain to him. He had never before
  noticed the subject of that tapestry, save in a most superficial manner.</p>

  <p>It represented the plague, Moses with the brazen serpent, and the writhing
  bodies of the victims in the foreground, looking vivid in the blue and green
  tints of the threads.</p>

  <p>A little sultry breeze eddied the tapestry so that the bodies seemed to
  fill out and move towards the Rector. He put his hand across his eyes, raised
  his head, and, pressing his hands on the arms of the chair, got to his feet.
  And then as he turned he saw the motto on the back of the chair that Kate had
  worked, and that, too, had its meaning: 'For God only.'</p>

  <p>'Give me strength,' he prayed. 'Oh, God, how can I do Thy will unless Thou
  givest me strength? I feel as if all the flies of Hell were buzzing in my
  head!'</p>

  <p>But he forced a smile for Kate's sake when she returned with her knife,
  ointment, and bandage. A lamp was kept always burning in the library, it was
  but small and gave a pin-point glow, which helped to create the fantasies
  that tormented William Mompesson.</p>

  <p>Kate now lit the larger lamp and put it at the edge of the table. Her
  husband rolled down his long stocking and put his leg across another chair on
  a cushion Kate provided, she all the while frowning and anxious.</p>

  <p>"Child," he said forcing, though sick and spent, an air of courage, "this
  is but a whimsy, let us leave it. It will only cause you distress." Then,
  trying to smile, he added: "Wound yourself, dear Kate, your life is the more
  precious."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, then hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I will, but now we must think of you. Take the knife, and I will
  look another way, but be ready with the ointment and the bandage."</p>

  <p>The Rector took the knife and indifferently gashed his leg. The pain was
  small and sharp; he watched the bright blood drop on the bandage placed
  ready, then staunched the wound with the wads of cotton that Kate handed him.
  He saw the pity and distress in her face as she watched the blood flow, and
  yet a certain eagerness and hope, too. How she believed in this cure!</p>

  <p>Thick yellow ointment was smeared over the wound and it was bound up and
  the stocking drawn over it.</p>

  <p>Then William Mompesson caught his wife by the waist and drew her down to
  the arm of his chair and rested his tired head on her shoulder and bosom.</p>

  <p>"When shall we have peace, Kate, peace and rest? Must men have either toys
  or care? Have we no hopes in any place? Kate, somewhere we have a home! But
  we get nowhere. It seems so far away that we have forgotten the
  direction."</p>

  <p>"Do not try to shake my faith, dearest dear," she said, caressing his damp
  locks, "for I have little enough. All is so cloudy and dark."</p>

  <p>"Kate! Kate!" He held her close. "You must not say such things! How can we
  solve these rare and intricate questions? We must have faith, we must believe
  in the justice of God's dealing with us. Oh, my wife, my darling! I, too, am
  stung with fear at my own frailty! Comfort me!"</p>

  <p>"What comfort have I?" she said, and tears of weariness stained her
  cheeks. "All I can say is, happy are the dead who are asleep below.
  Mompesson, every day I see more graves from my window or rather see that one
  large grave increase. Mompesson, they say the plague has gone to the outlying
  parts now."</p>

  <p>"Not outside the cordon?" he asked anxiously, sitting up. "Thou hast heard
  no case of that, Kate?" he said, clasping his hand.</p>

  <p>"Nay, none! But those who left the village to build themselves huts upon
  the heath&mdash;they say the plague is there. I heard the family at Riley had
  sickened. William, I heard this&mdash;when I was tending a sick child to-day,
  a woman came in who lived in a farm near to Riley, at least near enough for
  her to see, for the stream divides them, and she said there was something
  wrong. She had seen mistress Riley digging."</p>

  <p>"Not a grave, Kate?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. All is in a fog. Come, does your leg still hurt?"</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten it. But you, Kate, we must try this on you, too. It is
  possible there may be some hope. Bare your arm and look another way. I have
  the courage for this if you have. Think of our babes, Kate."</p>

  <p>"The pain is nothing," she said simply, "but I do not like the blood."</p>

  <p>She turned up her rough drugget sleeve and the plain undersleeve of linen,
  and he took the knife and after wiping it made a gash in her forearm. As she
  turned, she smiled at his pallor, for it struck him to the heart to have
  wounded her. He helped her to bandage up the arm and drew down the sleeve
  again. And they did begin to feel a certain comfort; supposing there was
  efficacy in this cure, they might yet be saved for happiness...</p>

  <p>They clung together with sad caresses, taking much comfort in their mutual
  love. And he reminded her, gazing over her bent head at the tapestry where
  Moses held up the brazen serpent:</p>

  <p>"Though we are but wandering clods, Kate, there is One above Who keeps
  track of our step, and even in the masks and shadows through which we move, I
  see, sometimes, the hand that beckons to the sacred way. Remember He is with
  us in all things, although He is invisible."</p>

  <p>The dawn was hot and yellow, the first colourless light had soon faded and
  there were storms in the air.</p>

  <p>Kate looked into the little room where Bessie slept. The girl was sunk in
  a swoon of fatigue, there were large shadows under her eyes, her hair was
  uncombed on her brow, her shift untied at her neck.</p>

  <p>Catherine closed the door carefully and then went to the closet where her
  husband slept, and found him too sunk in an unconsciousness deeper than sweet
  peaceful sleep. Carefully she lifted the coverlet and turned down the cotton
  stocking that he wore. There was the bandage still in place and a stain of
  dried blood on it. She puzzled if the wound was still open, surely as long as
  it were and an issue came from it there was good hope that by that means the
  infection would leave the body.</p>

  <p>The gash on her own arm had died and closed; she wondered if she should
  open it again or if she should accept this omen of ill-fortune.</p>

  <p>Then she closed her husband's door. Let them sleep, they had toiled
  excessively. But for herself, all repose seemed to have left her. She had
  dressed herself in her plainest gown and put on a hood and cloak of light
  material. Now she went into the kitchen; Ann Trickett was not yet abroad, but
  all was in order.</p>

  <p>She put together some parcels of food, bread, apples, honey, cakes, and
  folded them in a linen napkin in her basket. She never touched linen now, but
  thought how poor their store was becoming. She went lightly upstairs to the
  laboratory and took two pots of ointment such as her husband and Thomas
  Stanley used for anointing the plague spots, and a roll of bandage and a
  bottle of plague water, two pomanders and a packet of cinnamon. Then she
  turned to leave the house.</p>

  <p>But she was not unobserved; the dissenter was already abroad. He seemed to
  have an iron strength, since she had hardly seen him rest. She drew back,
  startled, and tried to put her basket behind her. But he perceived it and
  understood her errand.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to let my husband and Bessie sleep," she stammered.</p>

  <p>"Why should you not sleep, Mistress Mompesson? You have toiled as hard as
  they."</p>

  <p>"I could not catch at sleep," she replied. "I'm going abroad on my errand.
  Pray do not stay me, sir."</p>

  <p>"Why should I stay you?" he answered quietly. "Go where God directs you,
  Catherine Mompesson. But where do you go?"</p>

  <p>"Keep my counsel," asked the young woman gravely. cc I am going up to the
  Riley farm, I believe they are stricken there. No one will go."</p>

  <p>"I will go," said Thomas Stanley. "I was there a few days back and all
  were well."</p>

  <p>"And I heard a horrible story, sir&mdash;that Elizabeth Riley was seen
  digging a grave. Perhaps they're dying about her&mdash;and she is alone.
  Indeed I am going."</p>

  <p>"I would come with you at once," said the dissenter, "but I have promised
  to go into the village to watch by two who are dying&mdash;it is the boy who
  used to serve at <i>The Bull Inn</i>, and his sister."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, you must go, that is your duty plain before you," said
  Catherine hurriedly. "I may be wrong, I may find that these families are
  well. But they live so far away and nobody has seen them recently in the
  village."</p>

  <p>"I will come up presently, perhaps in two hours. If you stay there I will
  help you, if I meet you on the way coming back you must give me their news.
  There are other farms that we should visit besides those at Riley."</p>

  <p>The two stepped out into the air, still thick and sweet and golden. It was
  towards the end of August and the leaves were dry and yellow on the linden
  trees and the grass was fading in the churchyard, the weeds were brown and
  broken round the great Cross.</p>

  <p>The dissenter told Mrs. Mompesson that yesterday a man had come with a
  load of wood from Bubnell, and that the villagers had turned him back,
  refusing to allow him to pass through the village, though the fellow, who was
  in fine robust health, laughed at them and said he was not fearful of the
  plague.</p>

  <p>"It is most admirable the spirit that has got into them," declared the
  dissenter with enthusiasm. "They refused to let this fellow endanger himself
  and so he turned back. And it must be now six weeks since any stranger came
  within the boundaries of our affliction."</p>

  <p>Then they parted by the churchyard wall, and Kate, who felt a little
  strength with the brightening of the day and with the zeal of her errand,
  left the Nonconformist and turned eastwards towards Riley, where lived the
  families who were known by the common name of Riley from the place where they
  lived, and also of Talbot and Hancock.</p>

  <p>The farms where these families lived were about a quarter of a mile
  eastward of Eyam on the slope of a hill where the heather and the harebells
  had now withered, the first to a faint brownish-coloured foliage, the second
  altogether away. The low wind that stirred the withered grasses around
  Catherine Mompesson's path gave her a sense of desolation, yet one of
  exaltation.</p>

  <p>As she mounted above the village, she felt lifted from her usual petty
  cares, for so she tried to term everything that was worldly, even her
  affection for her children. Curling clouds, still tinged with the rosy hues
  of the sunrise, for it was early, were high overhead. And looking up at them
  she felt that invisible and dim, yet surely, there was the presence of God
  and that He was blessing her errand. And there was a pleasant stop to all her
  busy sorrows.</p>

  <p>The air was pure and fresh, different, surely, from what it was down in
  the village. She paused more than once to put down her basket and run her
  fingers through the stream that leaped through the heather and mosses on the
  hill-side.</p>

  <p>When she came in sight of the two farms that lay a little distance one
  from the other, she noticed at once that no smoke rose from the chimneys.
  Even on such a hot day as this at least one fire in each house would be kept
  alight for cooking and the heating of water. Nor could Catherine see any
  signs of life nor hear any sound&mdash;a barking dog, a crowing cock, the cry
  of a child.</p>

  <p>The Talbots were blacksmiths and had a smithy joining the small plot of
  land they farmed, for close by passed the upland road from Manchester to
  Sheffield. Catherine Mompesson knew these people&mdash;a man, his wife, three
  sons, three daughters, all at home save the eldest son, who had found
  employment in Bakewell.</p>

  <p>They were fine, comely children, more lively and full of grace than the
  villagers. Catherine had often admired them when they came down to Eyam to
  the church or to the festivals. She had seen them garlanded with flowers
  proceeding to St. Helen's Wake last year. They had been warned like all the
  other families, who occupied outlying farms, to remain in their high and airy
  situation; Catherine remembered this and still hoped that they might have
  escaped the contagion.</p>

  <p>A little orchard lay at the back of Riley and this was fenced about. When
  Catherine Mompesson came there, she paused at the latch gate and set down her
  basket, for it was heavy for her frail and now almost exhausted strength, and
  putting her hand cupped round her lips she called out, halloing, asking who
  was there.</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>The ripened apples had fallen into the long, dry grass, and as she stared,
  hushing her own voice and listening in vain for a reply, she saw in the
  further part of the orchard, where there had been an open patch for beehives,
  that these had been removed and the ground disturbed. She gazed at the rough
  outline of seven crude graves.</p>

  <p>Catherine Mompesson went through the orchard. This was the most terrible
  tragedy of the scourge; these people must have been buried&mdash;one by
  one&mdash;each by the hands of the survivors. And who had buried the last?
  She counted the graves again&mdash;seven! Father, mother, two sons, three
  daughters.</p>

  <p>The Hancocks, then! Had the plague touched them?</p>

  <p>She went into the farm kitchen and placed her basket&mdash;the contents
  were useless now&mdash;on the table. There was a mattress on the floor, an
  overturned chair, on the table some bowls and cooking utensils, a heap of
  neglected ashes lay on the hearth: there was a spent lamp, some torn, stained
  linen, a heavy putrid smell.</p>

  <p>She went upstairs, thinking perhaps there might be someone there, even
  though all the family were accounted for. Her mind was not functioning
  clearly, she fumbled at the door latches. She moved, wasting time, from one
  room to another, calling under her breath. But the house was empty.</p>

  <p>Kate left it, mechanically picking her basket up again and passing through
  the front garden where a few flowers bowed their heads before the lonely
  chill winds, for the heat seemed to have left the air in this solitary place,
  or else it was Catherine's spirit that made all around her seem cold.</p>

  <p>She passed to the next cottage, that was that of the Hancocks. It was a
  small cottage, and on the patch of ground beside it Catherine saw more
  hummocks, close together, cut out of the withered heath.</p>

  <p>Catherine tried to count them, but her senses failed. She leaned against
  the fence, the basket fell out of her hand and the contents were scattered on
  the ground.</p>

  <p>Then she saw that something was moving in the door of the cottage&mdash;a
  woman&mdash;Ann Hancock. Catherine knew her by sight. Ann had a towel in her
  hand that dragged on the ground, her attitude was one of great fatigue.
  Against the cottage wall leaned a spade, stained with earth.</p>

  <p>When the large, lone woman saw Catherine Mompesson, she greeted her
  without surprise, rather with a little nod, as at something expected.</p>

  <p>"I have buried them all, Alice, Ann, William, Oner, my husband."</p>

  <p>"You buried them!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the woman, showing the twist of towel in her hand. "I did
  not dare to touch them, but I put this about their necks and drew them out
  and made shallow graves for them. I had one with me to dig for all but the
  last, and that I had to make myself. I went on my knees, praying for help,
  but none came."</p>

  <p>"The Talbots," Catherine said, "they are dead, too? I heard talk of this
  in the village and came up. But why did you not send for help?"</p>

  <p>"Were we not asked to keep the infection to ourselves?" replied the woman
  with a wild sullenness. "And who had I to send? They sickened, one after
  another. One day two died, the next three, and so there's none left of either
  the Talbots or the Hancocks but myself."</p>

  <p>Catherine saw she was distracted, out of her wits, for she spoke
  desperately yet with what seemed lack of feeling; she pointed her finger
  across to the distant height of Stony Middleton, divided from Riley by two
  narrow dells. And she said that she had made signals to the inhabitants of
  the houses there, but they had taken no heed, though she believed they had
  watched her digging the graves for her husband and children, ay, digging,
  till her arms ached and dragged in the sockets.</p>

  <p>Catherine Mompesson could no longer stand. She went into the dirty cottage
  and sat down on a wooden chair with wings. She put her face into her hand;
  she could neither weep nor lament. These people were strangers to her, but
  their sufferings were as her own. The bleak woman, her hands hanging
  hopelessly, came into the little house.</p>

  <p>"My husband would have come, Mr. Stanley would have come," whispered
  Kate.</p>

  <p>"Thomas Stanley was here," replied Ann Hancock, "but that was before
  anyone sickened. He has a great deal to do and many to comfort, we could not
  expect him to return. Their blood was thickened by corruption. They had a
  stench even while they lived."</p>

  <p>"And they had no one to pray for them, and no one to read the burial
  service?" asked Kate; she asked if there was a Prayer Book in the house, and
  the woman answered: "Yes."</p>

  <p>Kate rose; she felt her body light, as if she floated.</p>

  <p>"Come out with me and I shall read the service over their graves. And
  afterwards, when the pest is past, they may be enclosed and stones put
  up."</p>

  <p>She felt a little strength ebb into her veins as she spoke these words.
  There was help in action. She added:</p>

  <p>"I shall stay and assist you to put the two cottages in order and to burn
  the bedding. That is what we do in the village, you know. And I have brought
  some fumigants. Then you must drink some plague water, and I have a
  pomander."</p>

  <p>The woman shook her head; the greasy gray hair hung over her yellow
  face.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do with these cares? I have buried my husband and my
  children, I have seen my neighbour and his children die and be buried, all in
  the course of a few weeks. What have I to do with remedies?"</p>

  <p>Ann Hancock sank down by her ash-strewn hearth and her hands fell in her
  lap. She was a woman who had been robust and comely, but now she looked like
  a crone of eighty winters; there was dried blood and filth on her hands and a
  noisome smell came from her draggled clothes.</p>

  <p>"What will you do?" asked Kate.</p>

  <p>The woman said she would go to Sheffield, where she had a son who was
  bound apprentice; she seemed to take some small relish out of the thought
  that this son would come back and erect some memorial to his family.</p>

  <p>"Bring me the Prayer Book," said Kate. "Though my husband or Mr. Stanley
  will come and read the service over your dead, yet I think God will accept
  this from a woman, first."</p>

  <p>She suggested this because she thought that the clergyman might be
  delayed; there were limits to what the two men could do, since they were
  employed almost day and night in the village.</p>

  <p>The woman looked at her visitor strangely, and then she seemed to take a
  little comfort too, while a few soiled tears stained her eyes. She went to a
  shelf littered with platters and cups and brought down a Prayer Book that had
  been a treasured possession, it was bound in green leather and clasped with
  silver roses.</p>

  <p>Kate asked for some pure water, and when Mrs. Hancock came with a stoup
  from the well, Kate put some of the vinegar she had brought with her into it
  and the two washed their hands and bathed their faces.</p>

  <p>Then the woman began to shake with sobs, as the water dripped over her
  flesh sullied with blood and dust; she had been like one quenched in grief,
  but now under the influence of this human companionship she began to realize
  her sorrows. She told her story of how they had died, at intervals of two,
  three or four days. At first all the Talbots had gone and then her own
  family. She said her husband and sons had gone to the neighbours and helped
  them to make graves in the orchard, and then died themselves; then she and
  Ann had buried Alice between them, and then when Ann had died, there had only
  been the mother left to dig the grave for her; shallow graves they were; a
  strong wind might blow the rude sods away.</p>

  <p>Catherine took the Prayer Book and the woman went with her into the open.
  First they went to the graves by the smithy, and there Catherine Mompesson
  read the burial service over those seven hummocks. And the woman said 'Amen.'
  Kate had no mutinous thoughts. 'Away with life and mirth,' she thought, 'this
  preludes my end. Why should I block with delays the way between me and
  Heaven?'</p>

  <p>Then they returned to the other graves; a cloud was over the sun and a
  wind stirred their garments; close together on the patch of ground by the
  Hancocks' cottage the rude mounds were set together and again the Rector's
  wife read the burial service&mdash;'in full and joyous hope of a glorious
  Resurrection.'</p>

  <p>Then she gave the Prayer Book to the woman and all she had in the basket
  and told her to remain where she was, lest she carry the plague somewhere
  else; she was by no means to go to Sheffield, but live at Riley, until she
  died or the infection was over.</p>

  <p>"Brighten your devotions," said Kate, "with thought of those who wait for
  you above."</p>

  <p>The woman seemed discontented and stupid; she muttered about her only
  surviving son and her wish to go to find him.</p>

  <p>"No," said Catherine sternly, "we must obey Mr. Mompesson. You must stay
  at your post as the others stay at theirs. I shall send help to you, Mr.
  Stanley will be here as soon as may be, and he must comfort you as God's
  mouthpiece. Why do you sigh over this filth and stench? Think of Heaven."</p>

  <p>Then she put her hood over her head again, for the air was rank and
  stifling, and went down from the hill-side, marvelling now and then at the
  steadiness of her own step; the landscape seemed slipping round her in a mist
  of rainbow colours.</p>

  <p>She saw many other evidences of mortality besides the graves at Riley. It
  was clear that many of those living in the outlying farms and many of those
  who had fled from the village and built themselves huts upon the moors had
  perished, for there were graves and rude stones, set here and there among the
  ferns and heather.</p>

  <p>These uncultivated graves filled Catherine's heart with hushed whisperings
  of pity. As long as her strength lasted, she stopped at each of them and said
  a prayer and some sentences of the burial service. And she tried to keep in
  mind their situation so that the Rector or Mr. Stanley, for she had forgotten
  that he was not qualified to be what she had called him to Ann Hancock, God's
  mouthpiece, might come up here and bless them. She wondered if God, in His
  mercy, would remember that these poor unshriven souls had been unable to show
  their penitence or to obtain anyone to intercede for them, and if He would
  deal tenderly with their sins and redeem their bones from among the poor
  highway herbs and lonely grasses.</p>

  <p>When William Mompesson heard that the pestilence had reached Riley he took
  his horse and went up immediately to that lonely place.</p>

  <p>But the wife of John Hancock had gone; despite Catherine's command, she
  had departed to Sheffield. The people from Stony Dell told him they had seen
  her go by on the high road without either bundle or staff.</p>

  <p>Now the Rector feared greatly that this woman, escaping from the
  desolation at Riley, would spread the plague, for she was the only one so far
  who had disobeyed his commands not to pass the boundaries that ringed the
  doomed village.</p>

  <p>But this case showed the mercy of God or the whimsy of the scourge, for
  the woman found her son in Sheffield, as it was afterwards discovered, but
  did not take the contagion with her, nor any sickness.</p>

  <p>As it was beyond the villagers' power to disinter the bodies of the
  Talbots and Hancocks from their shallow graves, a fence was put round them
  and some stones dragged to mark the place, and it was left to happier times
  to place some memorial there.</p>

  <p>But the Rector, sitting in the desolate cottage, wrote out in his
  beautiful handwriting the names of the members of the two families and the
  date, month and year, when they had died; the actual days he knew not.</p>

  <p>Then he and Mr. Stanley visited the graves that Kate had told them of on
  the wide moor and consecrated them and said a prayer over each, not knowing
  for whom they prayed, lad or maid, or one old and weary.</p>

  <p>Now the plague in Eyam was at its height. The heat was intense and seemed
  to increase from day to day. The stream that ran across the western end of
  the village was almost dried up, the leaves of the trees seemed to rattle
  with a metallic sound on the parched boughs, there was not a blade of green
  in the churchyard, where the ground had not been disturbed to bury the dead
  and the sods overturned, there was no growing thing. The whole soil seemed
  poisoned. Flowers shrivelled in the cottage gardens and the few crops were
  parched in the fields and there were few to gather them in.</p>

  <p>The villagers lived on the provisions placed on the stones in the dell at
  the head of the glen that the Lord-Lieutenant sent regularly. And there being
  so many infected that there was scarcely a family free, it seemed to William
  Mompesson that it was an ill thing to crowd them into the church. So
  gathering them together at the great antique Cross by the yew tree, the only
  green thing in the churchyard, and that dark as midnight, he told them that
  he would preach to them in the open air, in the dell called Cucklett, where
  there was an elevated stone on the slope at one side that might serve as his
  pulpit.</p>

  <p>And before he dismissed them after that advice, he gave them some
  commendation of their behaviour, for none that he knew had disobeyed him,
  save the poor distracted woman from Riley; but for himself he had little
  help, he felt sadly loose and stray as if borne before a giddy blast.</p>

  <p>As he descended from the steps beneath the Cross, he called out to Sythe
  Torre, who was standing amidst the crowd, and said to him:</p>

  <p>"I hear, Torre, that you have taken upon yourself the task of disposing of
  the dead. It is one for which you are well fitted, may you take this as a
  penance for those sins that you once almost confessed to me."</p>

  <p>The giant laughed, heaving his huge shoulders. He boasted:</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid of the plague, master. I put a rag round their necks and
  drag them out without touching them. And I get what's in the cottage often
  enough for my pains, and enough napkins to set me up in linen for life, and
  my wife and son as well."</p>

  <p>"Look to your own wife and son," warned the Rector, "and do not perform
  this task in a spirit of boasting and profanity, lest thou be punished
  instead of blessed for it. Ay, I think thou hast slipt, almost to Hell."</p>

  <p>But Sythe Torre blasphemed, rolling the tobacco in his mouth. He was
  convinced that he would escape the contagion; he was indifferent to the fate
  of his neighbours; he had a queer belief that his wife and his son, whom he
  loved, were immune. As he strode away through the haggard crowd, many
  frightened and baleful looks followed him. It was certainly a strange thing
  that not only had Sythe Torre escaped the infection, but he seemed in rude
  health. He never came to church, he did not join in the public prayers or
  lamentations, he drank heavily, spending such time as he was not employed in
  disposing of the dead in sitting in the parlours of the now almost empty
  taverns and drinking ale and brandy that none dare refuse him though he had
  not the money to pay.</p>

  <p>But in goods he was becoming a rich man, for he did not hesitate to take
  the property from an infected cottage from which all others had fled. He
  stripped the bodies of their clothes, if they had died, when they were
  attired. He took these to his house and piled them up in the cupboard, for he
  scoffed at any idea that contagion might lie in the garments.</p>

  <p>The villagers began to regard him with a superstitious awe; they felt that
  he was in league with the devil, the personification of the plague itself,
  and there were tales of his meetings with the evil one on the moors.</p>

  <p>The Rector returned to his study and pulling a sheet of paper wearily
  before him began to write; trying, with trembling hand and eyes dim with
  fatigue, to keep a register of the dead. It was impossible to do this
  regularly in the church, the deaths were too frequent, and moreover when one
  or more died in some beyond the village, the death was not reported, as in
  the case of the Talbots and Hancocks who had perished, all but one, at Riley,
  and whose fate would not have been known save for the visit of Kate.</p>

  <p>There were names of the victims to be written down, their ages, their
  occupations, and, as far as possible, the days on which they died. These
  facts were not always known to William Mompesson, but they could usually be
  supplied by Thomas Stanley who, during his ministry, had taken a keen
  interest in and scrupulously kept all details relating to his
  parishioners.</p>

  <p>The Rector trimmed the lamp and strove to free himself from the
  hallucinations that came from fatigue and anxiety. The room seemed full of
  swarming figures, now appearing in varying shades of gray, now in the white
  light of stars or moon. Sometimes he thought these fantasies were sent by the
  Devil to trouble him and deflect him from his duty, at other times that they
  were heavenly wings sent to console him and thrust his thoughts upwards.</p>

  <p>He tried to concentrate on his task, which was to copy into the register
  some fresh particulars given him by the dissenter.</p>

  <p>The plague had surely reached its height, it could scarcely be imagined
  that it could become more frightful. Whenever the Rector went abroad, his
  ears were assailed by a steady wailing issuing from the desolate houses, and
  those few who went abroad had a peculiar horror of expected doom stamped upon
  their pinched features. The place was isolated, too; no traveller passed
  through the streets, no stranger visited it, there was hardly a cottage that
  did not house at the same time the living and the dead. The pest-house was
  always full and it was impossible to venture abroad without seeing Sythe
  Torre, or one of the miners whom he had elected to assist him, drawing forth
  some still-warm body by a cord of napkin passed round the neck and placing it
  hastily in a shallow grave, stamping the earth over it impatiently; for the
  villagers had it rooted in their mind that the infection lay in the putrid
  bodies and that the sooner these were got out of sight, the better for the
  survivors.</p>

  <p>At first the Rector had remonstrated bitterly against this indecency, but
  in vain, and now the state of misery was such that he could not hope to
  contend with it; neither he nor Thomas Stanley nor the few men who had
  remained staunch and level-headed about them could possibly bury the numerous
  dead with religious rites.</p>

  <p>The villagers were by now familiar with the progress of the disease, and
  when they beheld the victim sinking into the final stage, the signal would be
  given and a shallow hole dug in the nearest spot&mdash;in a garden or field,
  sometimes by the roadside. The Rector knew that in some cases the still
  palpitating bodies had been thrust into pits dug in the kitchens of the
  houses or at their back doors.</p>

  <p>Until the month of July each family had buried its own dead, but now that
  had become impossible, for in some families there was no survivor and that
  was more work than ever for Sythe Torre.</p>

  <p>As the Rector made his register, trying to keep his figures neat and
  legible, his weary thoughts dwelt with a fascination upon the gigantic figure
  of the dissolute miner. Only shortly before he had seen him in the streets,
  half-drunk, shouting out a bawdy song, while he dragged along an old man by
  cords round his feet. When he had seen the Rector, he had cried out that he
  had pinners and napkins sufficient to kindle his pipe with while he lived,
  alluding to the hoard of clothing he had gathered during his fearful
  occupation.</p>

  <p>The Rector wondered if indeed this fearful man was sent from God or the
  Devil. How he obtained his strength, which seemed superhuman, and his daring
  courage that was hardly to be understood.</p>

  <p>'For even I, who may boast to be upheld by God, and even Thomas Stanley,
  who is undoubtedly a holy man, has not the daring of this brute. Shall he
  watch while I drouse?'</p>

  <p>He continued his list for a while, putting down the names of the Talbots
  and Hancocks in the register, the Sydalls after that, the family who were
  supposed to be descendants of the old witch who dwelt on the moors&mdash;a
  father, son and four daughters, all of whom had died in the space of
  twenty-five days. They had given the infection to the lover of one of the
  girls, a youth named Rowland, who had resided in the Middleton Dale and
  caught the infection on coming to visit Demmot Sydall. The Rector had also to
  add the names of some victims of the families who had fled early in the
  onslaught of the plague to Cussy Dell and there dwelt in huts. Though they
  lived so far apart from the village, the pestilence had sought them out, and
  when Thomas Stanley had last visited them, he had to report that there were
  four dead.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson had also to record the death of a young woman who had come,
  unknown to her husband and neighbours, from Coburn to Eyam to visit her
  mother, and who had died the second day after her arrival in Eyam.</p>

  <p>There were also the names of some families who dwelt in Shepherd's Flat, a
  little west of the village; one, a relation of Jonathan Mortin, by the name
  of Samuel, had lost his wife and child. Another family dwelling at Shepherd's
  Flat had also all died, and this Samuel Mortin was the only human being left
  on the moor where, obeying the injunctions of Thomas Stanley, he lived
  lonely, his only companions being a greyhound, four cows and a cock. The dog
  fed his master by bringing in some of the game which now overran the moors
  and fields.</p>

  <p>It was many weeks now since the villagers had attended to their usual
  occupations, the harvest had withered in the fields, threshing barns were
  silent, cattle lowed in the meadows where the hay had not been cut. There
  were only a few stout women, like Margaret Blackwell, who had the strength or
  energy to milk the cows.</p>

  <p>The Rector made his register as complete as he could and on a rough map
  that Thomas Stanley, who knew the district so much better than he, had drawn,
  he marked, as far as his knowledge went, all the various graves, so that when
  the time came he might consecrate them, or at least read a prayer above them.
  But he did not think that God meant him to do this service, for he believed
  that he, as well as the entire village, was doomed, and it was not intended
  in this Upas vale that any should remain alive.</p>

  <p>He rested his head upon his hands and did not note that the wick of his
  lamp was sinking into the socket.</p>

  <p>How scorching the summer was! He had set the window open, but the air came
  in tipped with heat. Surely it was most unnatural that there should be this
  sultry heavy weather so high in the mountains. Day by day purple clouds that
  seemed flame-edged hung over the peaks of the encircling hills and heavy
  vapours rested on Sir William, the highest mountain of the district, so that
  the noble summit was seldom visible. Now the stars were hidden in a cloudy
  murk and the wind that blew the study curtains bellying out into the room was
  as hot as if it blew off flame.</p>

  <p>"I saw them move, I heard them howl. Oh, check their fury..."</p>

  <p>There was a scratch at the door and the Rector started, trying to compose
  himself: 'Surely I have a darting conscience, full of stabs and fears.'</p>

  <p>It was Catherine. Without a word she came to his desk, looking so shadowy,
  so different from her usual self. Yes, shadowy was the word to use, she
  seemed so drained of life, that for a moment, drawing herself from the
  confusion of his inner thoughts he hardly knew her for his dear wife.</p>

  <p>She rolled up her sleeve and with a pallid smile showed him the wound on
  her arm. It had now quite healed. This meant, in her opinion, failure; the
  infection, should she take it, would be lodged in her body and not allowed to
  issue forth.</p>

  <p>She asked him how the wound in his leg went and he rolled down the
  stocking and took off the bandage and showed her. His wound had not healed,
  indeed, it had throbbed and had given him much pain and, when he with an end
  of the linen took off the ointment on it, a yellow liquid issued from the
  open sore.</p>

  <p>Catherine gave a sob of joy.</p>

  <p>"See! It is the infection that comes out," she cried, and her face was
  flushed into a likeness of her own former loveliness. "Oh, sir," she cried.
  "Oh, Mompesson, you are saved! It is as if you had the plague and it has run
  through you, as they say it did with Sythe Torre and Margaret Blackwell."</p>

  <p>He could not daunt her joy, but he had little belief in this remedy,
  though he did look with a certain curiosity at the issue from his leg. Was it
  possible that this was the deadly pest, in this way leaving him unscathed? He
  had a secret and intense horror of dying of this disease, of this pain; he
  had seen the people scream aloud with the agony of the hard tumours that no
  fomentation would break on breast and thigh and groin, and the filthiness of
  it filled him with dread.</p>

  <p>Nor did he wish to die like some he had seen, running mad in the streets
  and dropping into the dust, blaspheming and shrieking.</p>

  <p>So he felt what he confessed to himself was an ignoble relief that he
  might be spared the plague, even though he was ready to dedicate his life to
  God.</p>

  <p>But Kate's joy was unfeigned and unsullied by selfishness. She forgot her
  own fatigue and apprehension in thinking her beloved husband safe. She drew
  him to the window and pointed out that though the night was thick and black,
  yet in the rift of clouds were troops of stars.</p>

  <p>"I believe now," she said, "I believe! I believe in God and His miracles
  and in His mercy and justice, too. Yes, even though I have lived through this
  plague."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe in God, Kate, only because you think I have been spared
  the pestilence?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is not that."</p>

  <p>And he believed her, so simply and earnestly she spoke, even as she said
  she believed in God.</p>

  <p>"It has come to me lately when I have been with Bess and Ann Trickett,
  making bandages, scrubbing floors, preparing jellies and soups, and doing all
  in a haze of horror. When I have seen children die, and the women fall down
  in agony, and Sythe Torre dragging the dead through the streets. Even through
  this, somehow, there was a light like a pin-point&mdash;to-night, for
  instance&mdash;see the clouds, as I said, so thick, and yet the stars. I
  cannot use the words as you do, Mompesson, but I tell you I feel, behind it
  all, the hand and love of God."</p>

  <p>Her resignation, her piety, shamed him. He had loved her deeply, but he
  had thought her shallow compared to himself, as he knew her ignorant compared
  to himself; she had no manner of learning, she could not join in any argument
  or dispute or give any reason for this or that, but in the moment of her
  great suffering and trouble she had found her faith.</p>

  <p>"It is weak of me to rejoice that you should be spared, or I either," she
  said. "We should care for nothing save to wait for the sound of the trumpet
  that will summon us from the dust. But I am glad that we should live together
  for a little longer, Mompesson&mdash;only this morning I had no hope."</p>

  <p>"I confess I had little myself," He put his arm round her and she rested
  her head upon his shoulder. "This morning when I was preaching to them in the
  Dell, and saw those forlorn and scarred faces all gazing up at me, I almost
  lost heart and courage. I thought: 'What can I say to these? How can I induce
  them to believe in God, in His justice, or His mercy?' Yet when I told them
  how the great Victor fought for us, a sigh went among them like a wind going
  among the thistles, and I believe that they were a little comforted."</p>

  <p>"They must be comforted, they must believe," whispered Kate Mompesson,
  "otherwise it is to die. Tell me. I saw you making up the registers as I came
  in&mdash;how many have died?"</p>

  <p>"Of adults&mdash;two hundred," he replied firmly. "Of
  children&mdash;fifty. But there are many whose deaths have not been reported
  and who have been buried suddenly and secretly."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Kate, stirring against him on a sigh, "our children our
  safe&mdash;they must nearly have forgotten us by now. Let us make up the
  fairy tale, Mompesson, let us think that the plagues have gone, that it is
  the clean winter and that we have purified the village and have the children
  back again and everything is as it was, and Bessie has found a new
  sweetheart."</p>

  <p>He kissed her damp forehead.</p>

  <p>"We must not amuse ourselves with sickly trifles, Kate, but set ourselves
  to what we have in hand."</p>

  <p>"I wish," said Kate Mompesson, "we could get a breath of fresh air.
  Everything seems stale and infected, or is it my fancy. The flowers seem all
  withered this year, early. I could find nothing in the fields when I went
  abroad for half an hour to-day. Mompesson, do you think the infection could
  be in the flowers? Janet Parnley was picking the flowers on her father's
  grave to make a garland of remembrance, when she fell down and died in a few
  hours."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; MUSIC AT MIDNIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">THOMAS STANLEY, riding the gray horse, Merriman, made his
  rounds. His duty was every third day to visit the boundaries that had been
  placed by agreement with himself, the Rector and the villagers round
  Eyam.</p>

  <p>This invisible cordon was marked by spots well known to all inhabitants.
  It was about half a mile beyond the village; stone hillocks and tracts of
  moor outlined it and at several places, such as the well or rivulet to the
  northward, the cliff between Stony Middleton and Eyam, an ancient barrow,
  before which was a hollow filled with small stones, was selected for
  provisions to be placed upon, letters and money and other articles to be
  exchanged.</p>

  <p>The Lord-Lieutenant, his steward, the physician resident at Chatsworth and
  one or two other of the gentry of the neighbourhood carefully and
  scrupulously fulfilled the promises they had made to the Rector when he had
  first agreed to persuade the villagers to remain enclosed with their own
  pestilence.</p>

  <p>While several of the wealthier families who had lived either in or near
  the village, and who now dwelt in the houses of relatives at a good distance
  or in huts that they had made for themselves in the hills or on the moors,
  out of a shame-faced charity, left anonymous gifts on these stones for those
  whom they had forsaken.</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley made a methodical inspection of these places, filling his
  pack-bag with bottles of vinegar, rolls of bandages, packets of cinnamons and
  mixed spices, bottles of plague-water, letters, syrups and prescriptions. He
  carefully read the private messages and took from his pouch the little
  pockets of labelled money that had been given him. They had all first been
  washed in vinegar or laid in the running water of one of the streams that ran
  through the moors.</p>

  <p>There was one letter that gave him great pleasure. He could tell by the
  superscription that it came from Mr. Beilby in York, who had the Rector's
  children in his charge and had been sent to one Arthur Newlyn at Bakewell,
  who had taken this means of sending it into Eyam. The dissenter's rugged face
  softened, he even smiled as he put the letter into his bag, thinking of the
  pleasure it would afford Kate Mompesson.</p>

  <p>He was most regular in his actions; he did not pause to meditate or
  speculate on this or that, but mounted his gray horse and went on across the
  moor towards the well where he might expect to find the messages and
  provisions from Chatsworth.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stanley could not doubt, with the contrast of this cool breeze in his
  face, that the air in the village was infected, and when he came to a certain
  point where he could look down upon it and even count the graves that marked
  the neglected fields about it, he thought that he saw a kind of visible
  miasma hovering over the village like a noisome vapour. He shaded his eyes,
  trying to be certain if this were a fact or his excited fancy, and his mind
  was divided, his thoughts partly being that this was the contagion itself
  borne on the winds and hovering in this one spot, and partly that this was
  the visible wrath of God, the angry breath from His nostrils congealing in
  the air.</p>

  <p>These thoughts were confusing and difficult to pursue; the dissenter had
  to fall back upon blind faith. He was not unhappy; a man who had no love, no
  responsibilities, and no hates, but whose mind dwelt ever beyond the judgment
  day when he should enjoy such a bliss as he could not imagine, he was not
  greatly disturbed by the scenes of horror that had shaken William Mompesson.
  He had seen war and endured prison, and the pest-house and the corpses and
  even the cries and screams of the afflicted did not greatly move him.</p>

  <p>But as he went along on the plodding gray horse, he began to sing in a
  voice that was sweet and musical:</p>

  <pre>

<i>"Yet I have known thy slightest things,
     A feather or a shell,
A stick or rod, which some chance brings,
     The best of us excel.

Yea, I have known these shreds outlast A fair compacted strain,
     And, for one twenty we have passed,
Almost outlive our name.
     Thus Thou hast placed in man outside Death to the common eye;

That Heaven within him might abide,
     And close eternity.
A silent tear can pierce thy throne,
     When loud joys want a-wing,

And sweeter air stream from a groan Than any arted string.
     Thus, Lord, I see my gain is great,
My loss but small to it;
     Yet something more I must entreat,

And only thou canst do it.
     Oh, let me like him know my end,
And be as glad to find it,
     That what so e'er thou shalt commend,
Still let thy servant mind it."</i>
</pre>

  <p>Thomas Stanley, having relieved and cheered his soul with this hymn,
  turned his horse's head towards the slope that led down into the village.</p>

  <p>The sun was approaching the west and his keen eyes, trained like a
  countryman's to close observation of details and to recognizing objects at a
  distance, discerned how the little shadows were sloping from the scattered
  graves that were now thick round Eyam. He believed there were many more there
  than the numbers William Mompesson had put on the registers, and the
  energetic Puritan resolved that to-morrow, if he might be spared for long
  enough from the village, he would make his rounds and try to discover to whom
  all these heaps of earth belonged.</p>

  <p>As he remained thus, his horse reigned in at pause, a shrill long cry made
  him turn, and he saw some yards away a girl in a ragged dress, with her hands
  to her lips, trying to attract his attention.</p>

  <p>The dissenter guessed at once her errand. She belonged, doubtless, to one
  of the scattered families who had retreated to the hills or the moors from
  the plague, and who now, as he knew, had been visited by the pestilence. His
  aid was probably required&mdash;to say a prayer over a dying person, or over
  some shallow grave beneath the disturbed heath.</p>

  <p>So he turned his horse's head and rode across the moorland path towards
  the girl. As soon as he was near enough to discern her clearly, he checked
  his progress and gazed at her with a suspicious eye, for she was no one whom
  he knew. His constant travels during many years over this district, his
  intense interest in his parishioners and his retentive memory made it
  impossible for him to forget any of his flock.</p>

  <p>This girl was in tattered garments, not the clothes worn by the village
  maidens, but had once been looped with gaudy braids and cords that now hung
  dirty and torn from the ragged folds of purple cloth.</p>

  <p>Her form was voluptuous and she did not scruple to show it, making no
  attempt to lace tightly the soiled chemise across her full bosom or to
  protect her plump shoulders from the August sun by means of the thin cloak of
  red silk that hung by tassels from her throat. Her head was bare and her hair
  hung in close crisp ringlets and curls over a saucy, daring face, pretty in a
  coarse way, though now marked by neglect and that emphatic reckless defiance
  that keeps fear at bay.</p>

  <p>"The old mother," she said, in an accent that was not that of Derbyshire,
  "is ill. It is the pest, I doubt not. She told me to fetch you or Mr.
  Mompesson; I came out and saw you from a distance and hallo'ed to you."</p>

  <p>"I will come," said the dissenter at once. "But who are you?"</p>

  <p>She answered sullenly:</p>

  <p>"I came with the mummers who were playing at St. Helen's Wake last
  year."</p>

  <p>"And why did you not depart with them?" asked Thomas Stanley.</p>

  <p>He proceeded slowly along the moorland path that had been so little used
  this summer that the heath and fern had almost overgrown it. And she walked
  at his side, cutting a path with a strong hand through the yellowing ferns
  and clumps of tough, dried heather that dragged at her skirts.</p>

  <p>She answered readily; she seemed glad, he thought, to have someone to whom
  to speak.</p>

  <p>"I left the troop to follow Esquire Corbyn here. He made me promises, you
  know&mdash;there's some say I should be his wife."</p>

  <p>"These are no times to be talking of old sins," said the dissenter, ready
  with his rebuke, "but of present repentances."</p>

  <p>"But I talk of neither sin nor repentance, sir. It's not for myself I've
  asked your services. I say I came up here to seek Squire Corbyn. He sent his
  man for me, too. He wanted me to stay with him and comfort him. He was always
  afraid of the pestilence, that's why he left Eyam the first time. But when it
  grew near his wedding day he told me to be off, and so I went to Bakewell.
  But the troop of drollers had gone, so I wandered about, doing some farm work
  and helping the sick."</p>

  <p>"I have not met you before," remarked Mr. Stanley shrewdly. "Where have
  you been hiding?"</p>

  <p>"I kept out of the way, and out of that of the other rector, too. And then
  I went to live with old Mother Sydall, who is reputed a witch, and we did
  well enough."</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Stanley was silent; he blamed himself for neglect. Mother
  Sydall's hut had been unvisited, he knew, by either himself or William
  Mompesson, because they knew the woman to be evil. They thought they could
  not have their way with her and had left her alone, having other matters on
  their hands. But now the zealous man thought: 'It is that very wretched
  creature whom I should have visited. There were two lost souls there, but may
  be it is not too late for their salvation.'</p>

  <p>And he said with a grim smile:</p>

  <p>"Mother Sydall has been selling charms and potions to those who are afraid
  of the pestilence, and no doubt making a good thing out of it. And yet when
  she is ill herself, she sends for me and wants to make her peace with
  God."</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged her gleaming bare shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The old woman's grown sickly," she grinned. "She's pining and wasted. So
  she begins to think of her immortal soul and the close fires of Hell. And I
  have my fancies too, master, out here on the moor. I was peering in the Cussy
  Dell and saw Sythe Torre there, dragging a dead man along by a napkin around
  the neck. And when he saw me he cried and said he had nodded at Old Nick
  looking at him from a tree."</p>

  <p>"You are bold and ignorant," replied Thomas Stanley. "If you will repent,
  I will pray for you. Remember that no stained or withered creature shall come
  near the eternal, living well."</p>

  <p>The girl gave him a furtive, half-frightened look. She said:</p>

  <p>"I do not perceive the hand of God in this. Rather does it encourage the
  blasphemers. If there be a God, I think he has given his faith and given his
  fire into the Devil's hands."</p>

  <p>To which the dissenter answered calmly:</p>

  <p>"Solomon has said of a fair and foolish woman&mdash;she is like a jewel of
  gold in a swine's mouth."</p>

  <p>And the mummer seemed pleased at this, for the grim dissenter had
  unconsciously named her fair and her beauty had been all her trade. She
  smiled in high spirits, plucking a piece of heather and using it as a brush
  to send the buzzing flies from her face.</p>

  <p>And he asked her had she not more fear of the pestilence when she dwelt in
  the very house with it? And she replied that she had no fear of anything save
  Jack Corbyn's ghost, for she had met that upon the moor often enough, sitting
  by a high pond and whistling into the empty air, or coming forward to their
  old trysting place.</p>

  <p>The dissenter harshly bade her cease such lewd talk. He had suspected that
  the young man had had this way-side mistress long upon his hands, and
  believed that she as well as the pest had been a reason for his sudden
  leaving of Eyam, and he was indignant for the sake of Bessie Carr who was
  grieving so profoundly for her dead lover, who had even dedicated herself to
  death for his sake. She had refused to take any precautions against the
  pestilence and valued her life, as Thomas Stanley knew, not a whit.</p>

  <p>They had now come in sight of the substantial hut, sheltered by a grove of
  ash trees, on the moor where Mother Sydall dwelt. The hut had been built in
  what the local folks called a daubin, perhaps a generation ago.</p>

  <p>It was one of the pleasanter customs of the place that when a young couple
  not blessed with worldly goods were about to marry, all their neighbours and
  friends should gather together and build them a hut, each one contributing
  his handful of clay, his brick or his stone. With so many eager workers the
  new home was usually finished in a day. It would then be furnished by
  homemade furniture, provided by the same helpers, food and drink carried in,
  and a rude festival held in the new home, wine and salt being spilled over
  the threshold and many curious rites, which Thomas Stanley bitterly suspected
  to be of pagan origin, being performed.</p>

  <p>The couple for whom this cottage had been thus built upon their bridal day
  had long since left the neighbourhood, the man being called away to his
  father, who lived in Sheffield. Whether they were alive or dead, they had
  never been heard of since, and it was nearly twenty years now since Mother
  Sydall, who formerly had dwelt in a cavern in the rocks, had moved into this
  neglected dwelling.</p>

  <p>Among those whom she favoured with her blessings, and those who feared her
  curses, she had found eager helpers to patch up and restore the hut; it stood
  there stoutly in the warm light of the setting sun, a patch of cultivated
  ground set at the back, steps cut in the heathy ground to the stream that ran
  at the side of the slope, a dog tied to its post at the door, and a curl of
  smoke rising from the one chimney. Mother Sydall's cottage was familiar
  enough to Thomas Stanley, but there was one strange detail in the scene that
  caused him to strain his eyes and sharply question the girl.</p>

  <p>An elegant, dappled, purplish roan horse, splendidly trapped in polished
  leather plated with gleaming silver, was fastened by the bridle to one of the
  ash trees.</p>

  <p>"The old witch has a visitor," said Thomas Stanley, pointing with his whip
  towards the handsome animal.</p>

  <p>The girl affected a complete ignorance. She said that the old woman had
  been alone and in deadly pain when she had left her to seek help.</p>

  <p>The dissenter smiled sourly.</p>

  <p>"There is no mystery about the case, one of the neighbouring gentlefolk,
  who should from his education know better, has come to consult the old witch
  for a love potion or a preventive against the pest. Do I not know that these
  impious fools come for miles to indulge gross and studied filthiness in this
  desolate place!"</p>

  <p>But the girl said shrewdly:</p>

  <p>"How is it he stays, sir? When he put his head in the hut and saw the old
  woman dying&mdash;for dying she is, I dare swear&mdash;would he not have gone
  again at once?"</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley did not reply. He jogged up his horse and he, too,
  dismounted by the group of ash trees, whose leaves made a melancholy
  whispering in the evening breeze, and fastened the humble, roughly accoutred
  Merriman near the elegant horse.</p>

  <p>The girl had already run ahead to the cottage door and Mr. Stanley, with
  his long stride, was soon beside her. Together they stood in the entrance,
  for the door was open.</p>

  <p>The cottage consisted of one large room, a portion of which was screened
  off by blankets hanging from a rod. At the back a small door led into a
  penthouse where the witch kept her peculiar secrets. One end of the room was
  occupied by a large open fire-place on which, despite the August heat, a few
  embers were burning and over them on a tripod was suspended an iron pot.
  There were some rude pieces of furniture in the room, some female garments
  hanging from hooks and underneath the windows several shelves on which were
  jars, bottles, and boxes. Dried birds were pinned against the wall, a skull
  dangled by a pack-thread from one of the beams in the ceiling. A large
  bouquet of herbs stuck in a cracked, yellow pot gave a certain astringent
  freshness to the air.</p>

  <p>All this, however, served as but a background for the human beings within
  the hovel.</p>

  <p>The old woman lay on a blanket dragged over some heather and bracken, a
  shawl was pinned over a rough linen sheet, her head was tied in a kerchief.
  Her eyes were turned in her head, she was struggling for breath, and her
  crooked hands were clutching at the patched coverlet that lay over her
  crooked limbs.</p>

  <p>By her side on one knee was a handsome young man who, with an earnestness
  that showed he was deeply absorbed in his task, was offering a bowl of water
  to the old woman by gently tipping it towards her dry lips and lolling
  tongue.</p>

  <p>The appearance and actions of this stranger were both so unexpected by the
  clergyman and the mummer girl that they stood for a minute staring, wrapped
  in their own amazement.</p>

  <p>The strange gentleman was no more than a youth, of remarkably good looks
  and finely dressed in dark-blue cloth braided with silver; and embroidered
  baldric passed over his shoulders, which supported a costly sword. Long,
  thick and glossy curls, such as were worn only by the nobility, fell over his
  shoulders and either side his face. The lace at his wrist was, as he held the
  cup, touching the old woman's dirty garments and wizened breast.</p>

  <p>As he heard the steps in the doorway he turned and glanced coolly at the
  two newcomers.</p>

  <p>"The old woman is dying," he said. "I found her on the floor, and made her
  as comfortable as I could."</p>

  <p>"How did you come to be tending her, sir?" asked the dissenter, putting
  down his hat and whip on the table, already loaded with a strange assortment
  of ugly, filthy objects.</p>

  <p>"I was passing across the moor," replied the young gentleman. He was now
  supporting Mother Sydall with one arm, while with the other he was tilting
  the water that she lapped languidly into her withered mouth. "I heard her
  cries. I know the place well and who dwelt here, when I came in I found her
  writhing. She was in great pain. I have seen the marks on her breast," he
  added indifferently. "It is the pest."</p>

  <p>"Certainly it is the pest," said Mr. Stanley. "This young woman came to
  fetch me. I must say a prayer. Stand aside, sir, and give me place."</p>

  <p>But the young man did not immediately obey. When he had given the woman a
  drink, he wiped her lips and arranged the coverlet and the heath bracken and
  heather under her head, and then rose to his feet, wiping his hand on the
  napkin he took from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"The plague spreads," he remarked gravely.</p>

  <p>The girl went to the side of the old woman's bed; Mother Sydall was now
  unconscious, though breathing.</p>

  <p>The dissenter knelt down and began to pray, while the stranger watched him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>When he had finished his prayer, Thomas Stanley rose and the young
  gentleman was still there by the table, observing the scene from his dark,
  almond-shaped eyes; he had a charming face, brown, smooth and manly.</p>

  <p>The dissenter was, most unworthily, nettled by this display of cool
  courage on the part of a man whose type and class he much disliked. He said
  sharply:</p>

  <p>"You have no business here, sir. You will catch the pest yourself and you
  will carry it into other places. It has been our constant endeavour to remain
  enclosed against the world."</p>

  <p>The young man answered:</p>

  <p>"For myself I take no count, for I was not born fearful. For
  others&mdash;I ride to Buxton to-night, where the plague is already and where
  I stay with a family who has had it and therefore is, I think, safe. From
  there I am on my way to London, where God knows, there's plague enough. And
  so, abroad."</p>

  <p>He picked up his feathered hat and tasselled gauntlets that he had laid
  upon the chair beside the door and added with a slight smile:</p>

  <p>"You make much ado about keeping the plague in your village, sir. I have
  heard the tale and admired it. Those who do what they think right should be
  respected. But, sir, the plague is already all over Derbyshire, and if you
  had let some of these poor people remove themselves, they had had a better
  chance.</p>

  <p>"We have kept the plague, sir," replied Thomas Stanley sternly, "from
  spreading all over the Peak district."</p>

  <p>"Say you so?" asked the young man. "Well, it is in Buxton, and Bakewell,
  and Derby, but truly there is no spot where it rages so sorely as Eyam. And
  now it will be impossible for any of the villagers to leave the place. I have
  heard of one who tried and was stoned back. You have given Eyam a cursed
  name, sir&mdash;you and the Rector."</p>

  <p>"You venture to talk to me as if you thought that I and William Mompesson
  were mistaken?" asked Mr. Stanley, flushing dully.</p>

  <p>"I think you are mistaken. The villagers should have been dispersed last
  autumn."</p>

  <p>"How so, sir? How so?"</p>

  <p>"I believe by November only a few had died of the plague, and through the
  winter there were scant losses of life. It was with the heat the infection
  returned&mdash;cannot you, sir, draw the moral?"</p>

  <p>"There is none to draw," replied the dissenter. "Sir, you speak with
  frivolity and lewdness, as if you doubted the judgment of God."</p>

  <p>"I doubt the wisdom of men," replied the young man. "The infection was in
  the churchyard and stayed only by the frost of this severe winter, and it
  broke out with the heat, and once you began to bury your dead without coffins
  you were doomed."</p>

  <p>"That is a wickedness," said the dissenter angrily. He was stung both in
  his spiritual and in his worldly pride, to an extent that he forgot that he
  had, according to his own conceit, been in communication with God on his
  knees in prayer but a few moments before; he laid down the law severely in
  the tones of a master checking a froward pupil.</p>

  <p>"That is a whimsy, a conceit and a folly. It is well known that as soon as
  a person is dead and in the grave and the earth so ever lightly laid over it,
  there is no more contagion. And as for the frost sealing up the
  infection&mdash;that, young sir, is but an idle tale. And I have known cases
  of the plague, when the summer was unusually cold and again in a time of
  ceaseless rain. Indeed, sir," said he, warming into his subject, "I think the
  plague be more frequent, when the air is full of black mist and damp, with no
  dewdrops at night but a vaporous smoke. I have read all these things in a
  broadsheet called <i>The Red Cloth</i>, which gives many details of former
  plagues."</p>

  <p>And so he would have run on, for he prided himself on his knowledge of
  this matter and also on the heroic measures that he and the Rector had taken
  in Eyam, and it galled him to hear both despised by this young cavalier, who
  continued to look at him with a touch of radiant scorn, as if he were but an
  ignorant quack or babbler of a charlatan's wares in the market-place.</p>

  <p>But the young man interrupted and told him that this talk was
  wasted&mdash;"for I have been abroad, in ships, and in great cities, and
  heard much, especially from French physicians about the plague and the way it
  is treated. And I am assured that the plague increases by means of the
  uncoffined bodies tumbled together in pits."</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley, his face flushing, his features working with rage, asked
  scornfully:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, sir, you can tell me&mdash;since your knowledge is so
  wide&mdash;some remedies against this plague? We should be glad of them in
  our desolate village. Though everything," he added with heavy sarcasm, "that
  wise men have advised has been tried&mdash;from blood-letting to the wearing
  of cakes of arsenic in the armpit."</p>

  <p>The stranger smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of even more fantastic remedies than those. When I was in
  Venice they were making medicines from Oriental pearl. But look to the old
  woman&mdash;I think she passes. She is more in need of your prayers than I am
  of your arguments."</p>

  <p>With that the young man turned from the humble threshold of the hovel out
  upon the open moor, and the sun, just then sinking behind the purple peaks of
  the distant hills, gave his tine figure and authoritative profile an edging
  of light.</p>

  <p>Neither the girl, who had listened agog to the conversation between the
  young cavalier and the dissenter, nor Thomas Stanley himself took any heed of
  the old woman. Both of them had more than a touch of professional
  callousness, both of them had been already at many death-beds; there was
  nothing to be done to soothe the last moments of those who died of the plague
  and who usually were unconscious for some time before they drew their last
  breaths.</p>

  <p>Instead, these two ill-assorted companions stared at the young man, and
  both were touched with superstitious awe.</p>

  <p>The place was so lonely, the apparition of this radiant, splendidly
  dressed cavalier so unexpected. There was something so free, disdainful and
  bold in his demeanour that the thought came to them that perhaps he was not
  mortal but some devil sent in this worldly guise to deceive and mock them for
  their efforts.</p>

  <p>Stimulated by the thought that he was really in the presence of an
  emissary of evil, the Puritan stepped forward out of the hut and demanded, as
  the young man sprang into the saddle and turned his horse across the
  moor:</p>

  <p>"Who, sir, are you?"</p>

  <p>The cavalier laughed; he seemed to read the other's thoughts, for he
  said:</p>

  <p>"Not the Devil, but William Cavendish."</p>

  <p>"I wish you, sir, a better heart and less froward disposition," sneered
  the dissenter, and turned back into the hovel where the girl was drawing a
  sheet over the dead, distorted face of Mother Sydall; she then rose to take a
  spade from a corner of the room.</p>

  <p>"We kept that here," she said, "that whoever stayed the longer should use
  it on the other."</p>

  <p>"I will dig the grave," replied the Puritan.</p>

  <p>He took the spade and went out into the twilight, for with the
  disappearance of the sun behind the mountains the air had become grey in
  colour, the shadows were thickening in the hollows, and the neighbouring
  woods; the cavalier, riding rapidly, was now almost out of sight.</p>

  <p>As his spade cut the turf a few yards from the cottage, Thomas Stanley
  thought upon the young man's words, spoken with such an indifferent
  assurance.</p>

  <p>'He must be the son of the Lord-Lieutenant, who has lately been abroad at
  the wars, and travelling. He is supposed to be a reckless blade, a ruffling
  wanton.'</p>

  <p>The Puritan knew that it was likely enough that Lord William would inform
  against him. The young man perhaps had not his father's toleration, and as he
  passed through Buxton he might tell the Constable and the law officers to be
  on the outlook for the dissenter when the plague should have abated in Eyam
  and it would be safe to approach that desolate spot.</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley hoped that it might be so, for he longed to die a martyr's
  death. Yet the fact that he had so far been immune from the plague swelled
  him with pride, for he thought he was being reserved for some more dreadful
  fate, and that should ensure even a brighter reward.</p>

  <p>The girl came out of the cottage with rosemary in her arms. She complained
  that a short while ago it had been possible to buy a bunch for a few pence,
  now twelve shillings was charged for an armful in Bakewell; but they had
  grown some in old Mother Sydall's garden, though it had been difficult, the
  plants not doing well in that soil.</p>

  <p>She gave some to the dissenter and he crushed the flowers up and put them
  in his ears and in his mouth so that the girl, throwing back her head with a
  coarse laugh, said that he looked like a boar's head ready for the Christmas
  festival.</p>

  <p>Then they went into the cottage together, and finding a napkin put it
  round the old woman's feet and drew her out towards her grave and buried her
  there, touching neither the body nor the garments.</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley having a desire to get back to Eyam and deliver his letter
  to Mrs. Mompesson, the grave was but shallow and portions of the old woman's
  drugget skirt showed through the turf and the thinly sprinkled earth, so that
  they cut bracken and heather and piled it over.</p>

  <p>The dissenter did not lose this chance of moralizing. He pointed out to
  the young woman, who said her name&mdash;an outlandish one to Thomas
  Stanley's ears&mdash;was Janot, though some called her Nell, how the old
  woman with her false arts and devilish predictions had come to die as readily
  as any poor Christian, her spells and her amulets and her waters and plasters
  and potions not having saved her at all.</p>

  <p>"And what shall save me?" said the girl suddenly, as if a sense of her
  forlorn situation had overcome her with a force she could not withstand.</p>

  <p>She sat down upon the sill of the forlorn cottage's open door and, putting
  her elbows on her knees, hid her face in her hands and tears glittered in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stanley asked her how she had lived hitherto, and she said that there
  was a family not far distant who still farmed a bit of ground and who had
  sent the two of them, the old woman and herself, vegetables and now and then
  a little flour and some eggs. But when they knew the old woman was dead of
  plague, it was likely they would be afraid to come near the place.</p>

  <p>The dissenter, leaning on his spade, for he was fatigued and sweating,
  sternly told her to leave her blubbering and to come down to Eyam and help in
  the pest-house with the other women "and so make a repentance for your past
  life, which is nothing but sin sugared and candied over with folly."</p>

  <p>"It is certain death to go into the village," murmured the girl, looking
  at him askance.</p>

  <p>"It is perilous," he agreed. He put the spade inside the hovel and wiped
  his brow. "But I give you this chance as a penance, as William Mompesson gave
  it to Sythe Torre, who is a self-confessed murderer, having killed a man in
  the mines once&mdash;from jealousy." He added, looking harshly on the girl:
  "Dost thou fear death? Is any plague worse than sin, or any pain more foul
  than a lewd life? Come, make up thy bundle and come down to the village with
  me."</p>

  <p>Janot laughed at this rebuke. She turned to some of the shelves in the
  hovel and took down a pot of fennel and rue and tied this with what remained
  of the rosemary into a bouquet and put it in the bosom of her tattered
  skirt.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm really afraid? I have often been down to Eyam since the
  plague began, to stick flowers on Jack Corbyn's grave. Yes," she added with a
  sigh, "his was the only one that had festoons and garlands on it, though they
  were but of heath and ivy."</p>

  <p>"Your courage should be put to better use," said Thomas Stanley. "Leave
  this fond humour. Take thy bundle, say I, and follow me down to the village."
  Shadows now filled the lonely hut, in which the presence of death seemed
  still to hover. The heather couch, stirred by the last struggles of the dead,
  remained in the corner with the patched coverlet awry, and on the floor was
  the glass of water that the cavalier had offered to the dying woman.</p>

  <p>The Puritan cast a shrewd glance round the accumulated rubbish. He
  wondered if possibly among all these potions and essences there might be
  something that would be useful in combating the pestilence. But he decided
  that all was unhallowed and best left alone.</p>

  <p>So again urging the girl to haste he went outside and unfastened the gray
  horse from the ash and turned Merriman's head towards the village,
  indifferent as to whether or not the girl followed him. She might, if she
  would, remain behind in the hut; there were many who dwelt alone on the
  moors.</p>

  <p>She came after him and walked beside the horse's head, her bundle on her
  back and a comb, coral bright, stuck in her tangled locks.</p>

  <p>"Make thy garlands," said Thomas Stanley, a shadow on his face as he
  passed out of the high moor into the dale, "where neither wind nor rain nor
  time shall wither them."</p>

  <p>And then he asked the girl if she could sing, and she said: "Yes," she had
  been used to singing in the mumming plays in which she had acted.</p>

  <p>"I fear you know none but bawdy songs," said the Puritan. "Raise thy voice
  in this, if thou canst."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">CATHERINE MOMPESSON'S joy at receiving the letter that
  brought news of her children in York was so poignant that it seemed entirely
  to consume her spirit, and she almost fainted where she stood, the first time
  that she had shown sign of collapse since the plague began.</p>

  <p>Then when she and her husband and Bessie and Ann Trickett were all
  gathered together for the evening and had read the letter and commented upon
  it with loving excitement, she took it from them all and went up to her
  chamber.</p>

  <p>And when William Mompesson followed her, he found her kneeling by her bed
  in an attitude of prayer.</p>

  <p>He was touched to the heart at this proof, as he thought it, of her
  dutiful resignation. But he was mistaken, for when she saw him on the
  threshold she turned, not rising from her prayers, and her prayer was not to
  God but to him.</p>

  <p>"Let us leave the village now," she said, in hurried tones. "Let us go
  away. If we dare not go to York for fear of the infection, let us go and live
  in a cavern in the hills as so many others do. We shall find food up there,
  there are still those who will supply us. You have no longer the contagion, I
  am sure, because of that issue in your leg. Why! I feel so well, so happy, it
  cannot be that I am going to sicken."</p>

  <p>"Why, Kate," asked the Rector mournfully, "what weakness is this? To
  retreat now, when the fight is nearly won!"</p>

  <p>"Death has won the fight here," she said, still upon her knees. "Do not
  they die daily? How many have I seen to-day, lamenting and falling in the
  streets? Soon there will be not one left, the churchyard can contain no more,
  they are digging a pit outside the wall&mdash;I saw them from my window. We
  must both die if we remain. There are the children, dear, how shall they live
  without us? They will have no home, no money, no means of life."</p>

  <p>"For that," replied the Rector, cheerfully, trying to raise her from her
  knees and control his own emotion, "I have made provision. Sir George Savile
  would look after our little ones, and your uncle, Beilby, too. They are in
  God's hands."</p>

  <p>"God's hands!" she said wildly, allowing him to raise her to her feet. "I
  suppose we are all in God's hands! And what is He doing to us&mdash;consuming
  us utterly."</p>

  <p>She cast herself on his bosom and clung to him tightly.</p>

  <p>"I am young, Mompesson, I have not had my share of life. I want my
  children, your children, other children, too. Is it all to be cut short and
  for no good? We can do nothing here!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed we do much. Would you leave Thomas Stanley to face it all
  alone?"</p>

  <p>"He is sufficient," she answered quietly. "They heed him more than they do
  you, they know him better. He has a rougher way. I think, Mompesson, he
  believes more steadfastly than you do. It seems as if he can see the goodness
  of God behind all this horror, and I cannot. Can you? Once I could. I found
  faith. Now it is gone again. I want to live. You cannot stay here."</p>

  <p>"I do! I can! I must!" said the Rector. "I am His soldier, I cannot leave
  my post. Take even poor little Bessie, even Ann Trickett, who is an ignorant
  woman, take them. Should we forsake them?"</p>

  <p>"Bessie urged me to go," sobbed Kate, limp in her husband's arms as if all
  her strength had left her. "So did Ann Trickett. They said we should live for
  the children, and they would stay here and look after Jonathan Mortin and
  Thomas Stanley. Bessie has no stake in life, her heart's in Jack's grave. All
  her brave, glad hopes are gone."</p>

  <p>"She's had little to regret, Jack Corbyn was but a scoundrel," said
  Mompesson. "Stanley told me how just now he met a girl, a player's girl, who
  was his paramour. But leave Jack and leave Bess&mdash;think of ourselves,
  Kate, think of what is due to our own dignity and honour. Take your hands
  from my neck, it is not fair that you should thus entreat me."</p>

  <p>But she clung the tighter, pleading quickly, incoherently for life, for a
  chance, for the future</p>

  <p>"We cannot fly from God," whispered the Rector, ashy-lipped. "Were we to
  leave Eyam, He could set the Black Death behind us, to clutch us when He bade
  it."</p>

  <p>The room was only lit by the small, beamy flame of one candle hastily and
  carelessly lit, so that shadows encroached on them on all sides.</p>

  <p>And Mompesson, raising his desperate eyes, saw on the other side of the
  bed, once so trim and now so indifferently draped, a large dusty mirror set
  between the windows, in which he could see his wife and himself clinging
  together, her head still upon his bosom. They were so disordered in their
  dress, so wild in their movements, her face was hid with such an excess of
  despair and his own visible countenance so gaunt and lined that he thought
  that he did not look upon himself and his Kate, but upon two lost souls, and
  the faint radiance of the candle reflected in the mirror seemed but a
  mourning light upon the dead.</p>

  <p>Kate raised her face pearled with tears and continued her entreaties in a
  thick whisper.</p>

  <p>But he was staunch. He had offered her a chance of leaving the desolate
  village once before; now it was too late. She would carry the infection
  wherever she went.</p>

  <p>"Kate, my dearest dear," he said, "through these sick hands and high
  agonies your faith will break into life and death itself will die. Your good
  deeds shall be as music at midnight to you."</p>

  <p>Kate lay asleep, her passion washed away by tears.</p>

  <p>Before she slept she had seemed resigned and even joyful when, to console
  her, the Rector had brought up the question of the issue in his leg and
  showed her that the wound was still open with the thick yellow fluid flowing
  from it, while that she had made on her own arm had closed.</p>

  <p>She had folded her hands upon her breast and fallen into the deep slumber
  of exhaustion; he had remained by her; no other had a greater claim on him
  and he would watch by her that night. Too many nights they had been separate.
  He dared to hope that the time might come when he could have her in his arms
  again and they could lie cheek to cheek, heart to heart, between the curtains
  of her embroidering, as they had lain in those days when they had first been
  wed, that seemed now, in retrospect, the very ecstasy of happiness.</p>

  <p>With the dawn she woke and seemed revived and said no more about leaving
  Eyam. She got up and bathed her face in the ewer of water, which Ann Trickett
  kept always in the bedchamber, and asked the Rector if they might walk in the
  fields before they broke their fast.</p>

  <p>"I have not been away from the village for some time," she urged, and he
  tenderly granted her request.</p>

  <p>They left the house together, none seeing them; Thomas Stanley was perhaps
  already abroad, Bess and Ann Trickett asleep. Jonathan Mortin would be
  working too; no one had had much sleep in the Rectory for many months
  now.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson understood his wife's wish without her expressing it. They
  turned abruptly away from the village and the graves, the pest-house and the
  cottages marked with the red and yellow cross, and turned towards the fields
  on the western side of Eyam.</p>

  <p>Even here the air seemed heavy and infected as if a miasma lay over the
  whole place. Nor could they entirely escape the dreadful sights to which they
  could never become accustomed, for as they turned through the dead heather
  and bracken they saw the gigantic figure of Sythe Torre dragging a yellow
  female corpse, unclothed, by the napkin round the neck and singing a lewd
  song.</p>

  <p>He was half-drunk and his tangled hair, with a kerchief tied round his
  head, ragged shirt that exposed his hairy chest, the fanatic glitter of his
  small eyes, gave him a dreadful appearance.</p>

  <p>Perceiving the Rector with his young wife hanging faintly on his arm, he
  shouted out his usual blasphemy&mdash;that he had seen Old Nick grinning in
  Cussy Dell.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson paused and sternly asked who it was that was being
  dragged out for burial. And Sythe Torre replied with an oath and a grin that
  it was the last of a family who dwelt just outside the western end of the
  village and who had hitherto buried one another in their own garden. But that
  being full he was forced to take this one to the heath.</p>

  <p>"But I am well paid for my labour," he added, "for I have all that is in
  the cottage, and that includes as fine a set of pewter plates as ever I
  saw."</p>

  <p>"When I die," asked Kate wildly, "will they do that to me?"</p>

  <p>"My dearest dear," cried the Rector, deeply shocked, "take such thoughts
  from your mind! Let us go away! Yes, even though I neglect everyone else, let
  us go from the village and walk where the air is sweeter."</p>

  <p>She smiled up at him.</p>

  <p>"But the air is so sweet, it smells to me of almonds, of lilies,
  hyacinths, harebells."</p>

  <p>These words struck a dismal chill into the Rector's bosom. He thought that
  she was flagging, that her weight hung heavier on his arm. She still murmured
  that she wished to walk further and further away, but he turned her back and
  led her, her protests growing fainter, to the Rectory.</p>

  <p>And when she crossed the threshold, she stumbled and fell on her knees,
  and Ann Trickett came forward, crying, and they lifted her up between them
  and took her to her room.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," cried William Mompesson in his agony, "it is nothing! It
  is fatigue."</p>

  <p>But as soon as Kate Mompesson was returned to the bed from which she had
  so lately risen, she seemed to fall into an unconsciousness that caused Ann
  Trickett to cry out that she had heard the white cricket last night.</p>

  <p>And although the Rector hushed her sternly, there was despair in his
  look.</p>

  <p>Bessie, too, came running in and stood by her sister, staring down into
  her face. Kate roused herself after a while and in a drowsy voice bade them
  all keep away from her, for she thought she had the plague. With a smile she
  added:</p>

  <p>"I have been much wasted of late, almost as if in a consumption, and I do
  not think I shall resist the illness long."</p>

  <p>Mompesson, groaning with anguish, charged her not to speak such words of
  ill-omen.</p>

  <p>"Go," said Bessie, "and get some cordials, Mompesson. There are those
  already beating at the door, but Thomas Stanley will attend to them. Go, I
  say!"</p>

  <p>The Rector left the room and stood for a while, not able to collect his
  wits, in his study. And when he passed into the laboratory he was again at a
  loss and stood there, stammering to himself half a prayer and half a
  protest.</p>

  <p>When he raised his eyes, he saw his own face reflected in the mirror
  between the windows, and it seemed to him it was a skull from which rusty
  hair hung, bitten by the infection of the grave.</p>

  <p>Twice he made up a cordial, but his hand shook so much that it was spilled
  all over the table. Then he took a pot of ointment and a roll of bandage. He
  had done this so often that the action came to him without his having any
  need of thought. And in a few minutes he was back in her chamber, yet he felt
  that he had travelled a long way through the dark, windy wastes of eternity,
  for that she had the plague and would die of it he made no doubt.</p>

  <p>Before that day ended, the marks of the pestilence appeared on her bosom,
  beginning as a purple stain and swelling to hard, dark tumours.</p>

  <p>She had by now fallen into a delirium and spoke at random about her
  children, her soul, and her terror lest that was lost for all her care. Then
  she seemed to recognize Ann Trickett and begged her pardon, if she had ever
  used unkindness to her, and stretched out her hand for Bessie, but could not
  find her though she stood close, so that they knew that Kate's sight must be
  failing.</p>

  <p>Bessie and Ann Trickett between them heaved her up in bed, William
  Mompesson being incapable of touching her. Thomas Stanley gave her sweating
  antidotes such as they usually employed in the early stages of the plague; he
  had difficulty in making her drink them. This seemed but to inflame her more,
  to heat her blood and to distemper her head, which put upon her many
  incoherences.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson was greatly troubled with this; he could no longer hope
  to save her body, but he must do his utmost for the salvation of her soul. So
  he cried out to the delirious woman:</p>

  <p>"Kate, by whom and on what account do you expect salvation, and what
  assurances have you of the certainty thereof?"</p>

  <p>Though in other things as she had talked at random, yet to these religious
  questions she gave a rational answer, saying: "One drop of my Saviour's blood
  to save my soul!" and cried out often, "God&mdash;God&mdash;God."</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley then offered her some more cordials and she shook her head,
  intimating that she could not take them, but her senses seemed to have a
  little returned.</p>

  <p>And when her husband conjured her to take these drinks in the name of her
  children, she said: "For their dear sakes, I will attempt it." And she with
  difficulty lifted up her head and swallowed the drink.</p>

  <p>"You are to understand," said Bessie, crying, "that while she has any
  strength left, she will embrace any opportunity of testifying to her
  affection for the children." While her senses remained to her, Kate again
  whispered to her husband that he should leave her for fear of contagion. But
  he smiled; and said: "How can I leave you in your sickness who have been so
  tender and nursed me in your health? Blessed be God, if he enables me to be
  helpful and consoling to you."</p>

  <p>But on these words she shook her head upon the pillow and said: "What can
  console me?"</p>

  <p>Her husband said hastily, for he feared she was disturbed by worldly
  matters:</p>

  <p>"Think of God! God!"</p>

  <p>And she repeated in a hollow voice:</p>

  <p>"God! God!"</p>

  <p>Her illness endured but two days. At the end of the second day she fell
  into a sleep and her husband slept, too, on a mattress beside her bed; Bessie
  and Ann Trickett took it in turns to watch by Kate. And Thomas Stanley,
  coming and going on his various errands, performed the usual routine in the
  sick chamber of one who is dying of the pest&mdash;burning spices at the
  door, sprinkling vinegar upon the floor and upon the curtains, tying bunches
  of rue, fennel and rosemary above the bed, and renewing them as they
  faded.</p>

  <p>It was Ann Trickett's watch, when Kate Mompesson woke and whispered that
  she would like her husband to pray with her. She seemed in her senses now and
  smiled faintly. Therefore Ann Trickett went round the bed and woke the
  Rector, who stumbled to his feet and cried: "My dearest wife, how do you
  do?"</p>

  <p>She could not answer, but Ann Tricket said:</p>

  <p>"Sir, she is looking when the good hour shall come."</p>

  <p>William Mompesson turned about and took the Common Prayer Book from the
  side table and read the prayers. She made the responses&mdash;"Hark, as
  perfectly as if she were in health," said Ann, who was on her knees at the
  end of the bed.</p>

  <p>When the prayers for the sick were ended, she still had not stirred, but
  she was breathing. Then her husband fetched <i>The Whole Duty of Man</i> and
  read some prayers from that treasured volume.</p>

  <p>When these were ended, still the sick woman was silent and pulling aside
  the disordered curtains, he stared down into her face, and asked:</p>

  <p>"My dear, dost thou understand? Dost thou mind what I say?"</p>

  <p>She answered: "Yes!" after struggling with the weakness of her lips.</p>

  <p>It was the last word she spoke.</p>

  <p>Ann Trickett pulled him back by the shoulders, and Bessie coming in with a
  bowl of water stayed herself on the threshold with a little cry, and the
  water spilled over her feet.</p>

  <p>For Kate was dead&mdash;a figure of corruption lay mute in the tumbled bed
  that once had been so nice and elegant.</p>

  <p>Catherine Mompesson was buried. They had found a space for her under the
  yew tree, but there was none who had the leisure to make her a tomb.</p>

  <p>"That shall come afterwards," said William Mompesson.</p>

  <p>He sat in his study writing a letter to his children of farewell, for he
  knew himself to be a doomed man and that he could by no means escape the
  pestilence. Yet his language was formal and stiff, that of a schoolman;
  though the anguish he felt bubbled up within him, yet he repressed it even in
  this hour of poignant grief into the language of decorum.</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'To my dear children, George and Elizabeth Mompesson, these
  present with my blessing.</p>

  <p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">Dear Hearts</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">'This brings you the doleful news of your dear mother's
  death, the greatest loss that ever befell you. I am not only deprived of a
  kind and loving comfort, but you are also bereaved of the most indulgent of
  mothers that ever dear children had.</p>

  <p class="letter">'But we must comfort ourselves in God, with this
  consideration&mdash;that the loss is only ours, and that what is our sorrows
  is her gain. The consideration of her joys, which I do assure myself are
  unutterable, should refresh our drooping spirits.'</p>

<br>

  <p>William Mompesson tried to compose himself, to brush away the dreadful
  hallucinations that crowded upon himself, to persuade himself that the
  figures were not springing from the tapestry behind him&mdash;the brazen
  serpent raised in the brawny arms of Moses with the flowing beard, the
  writhing victims on the ground&mdash;these seemed to press about him as he
  wrote. He mastered his nerves, his hand traced the formal words that covered
  his perplexed anguish.</p>

  <p>'Joys unutterable,' his Kate was enjoying Paradise... He tried to impress
  upon himself what those words really meant, but he could only remember how he
  and Ann Trickett had prepared her for the grave, how quickly she had
  corrupted, and how her thin white features stood in a peak through the
  shrouds... How they had pressed rosemary and fennel upon her, but had not
  been able to stay the stench of decay. The once sweet, loved flesh had soon
  been in tatters on the small bones.</p>

  <p>The Rector could only remember how he, Ann Trickett, and Jonathan Mortin
  had carried her into the churchyard between them, for no one would come near
  the Rectory, each being absorbed in his own woe. Nor would Mr. Mompesson have
  allowed her to be touched by a strange hand.</p>

  <p>When they had laid her on the parched grass beside the open grave that he
  and Jonathan Mortin had dug the night before, he had stumbled up the belfry
  steps and rung one of the great bells himself, that she might not pass wholly
  unhonoured.</p>

  <p>He pushed these thoughts out of his mind and tried not to see, as if in a
  hazy vision, the look of the sods falling on the sheet that he had wrapped
  about her. He had found this one piece of fair linen at the bottom of the
  press&mdash;Ann Trickett had told him that she had kept it there, lest he
  should die&mdash;and now it had been used for herself.</p>

  <p>Were these things the truth, perceived in a horrible kind of half-light?
  Was what he wrote on the fair paper lies&mdash;<i>'My dear hearts, your
  blessed mother lived a most holy life and made a most comfortable and happy
  end and is now invested with a crown of righteousness.'</i></p>

  <p>Poor Kate! Poor little Kate! Were these brilliant sayings true of her? He
  remembered all her little faults, her frivolities, her shallowness, her
  laughter, and her vanity. He wrote:</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'Let me recommend to you her piety and devotion, which were
  according to the exact principles of the Church of England. In the next
  place, I can assure you she was composed of modesty and humility, her
  discourse was ever grave and meek, yet pleasant withal, a vaunting, immodest
  word was never heard to come from her mouth.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Again, I can set out in her two other
  virtues&mdash;charity and frugality. She never valued anything she had, when
  the necessities of a poor neighbour required it.'</p><br>

  <p>That was true, for Kate was always generous and charitable; his quill
  continued to scratch the paper.</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'She never liked tattling women, and abhorred the custom of
  going from house to house and wastefully spending precious time. She was ever
  busy in useful work, yet though prudent she was affable and kind.'</p><br>

  <p>The Rector could no longer continue this formal panegyric; he could
  remember nothing but Kate's love. And he wrote:</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'I do believe, my dear hearts, upon sufficient grounds,
  that she was the kindest wife in the world. I speak from my soul, for she
  loved me ten times better than herself. For she not only resisted my
  entreaties that she should fly to you, dear children, from this place of
  death, but some days before it pleased God to visit my house, she perceived a
  green matter to come from the issue of my leg, which she fancied a symptom
  that the infection had found vent that way&mdash;when she assured herself
  that I was passed the malignancy of the disorder. Whereat she rejoiced
  exceedingly, not considering her own danger thereby.</p>

  <p class="letter">'I think, however, that she was mistaken in the nature of
  the discharge she saw. Certainly, it was the salve that made it look so
  green, but her rejoicing on that account was a strong testimony of her love
  for me. For I am clear that she cared not, if I were safe, though her own
  dear self was in ever so much pain and jeopardy.'</p><br>

  <p>He paused, took a sip from the cordial in the glass by his side, and
  continued writing, trying to put on the paper to his children some account of
  the death of Kate. But the words seemed stiff and cold.</p>

  <p>He folded the letter and sealed it&mdash;Thomas Stanley would see that it
  was taken and placed on one of the stones on the boundary ring and sent to
  Mr. Beilby in York.</p>

  <p>He sat with his face propped in his hands, the candle guttering unheeded
  beside him.</p>

  <p>He remembered the days at Rufford Park, the gables, the square tower of
  Sir George Savile's mansion swam before his mind, and he hardly believed that
  life had been his; he had not valued his happiness when he had had it, like
  most poor wretched men ever grumbling and complaining, but not seeing what
  misery was before them.</p>

  <p>His heart pinched in what was an acute physical pain when he recalled Kate
  seated at her music in her brocade gown, gay and lovely, sparkling with
  happiness; his children in their little wicker cots, Bess so gallant from her
  happiness with Jack Corbyn.</p>

  <p>To distract himself from these intolerable remembrances, he pulled another
  sheet of paper towards him and wrote to his patron, the Lord of Rufford
  Park.</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">Honoured and Dear Sir</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">'This is the saddest news that ever my pen could write, the
  Destroying Angel having taken up his quarters within my habitation, my
  dearest wife has gone to her eternal rest and is invested with a crown of
  righteousness, having made a happy end. Indeed, had she loved herself as well
  as me, she had fled from the pit of destruction with the sweet babes and
  might have prolonged her days.</p>

  <p class="letter">'But she was resolved to die a martyr to my distress. A
  crown of righteousness, joys unutterable...'</p><br>

  <p>He groaned, the quill dropped from his stiff fingers, and he leaned back
  in his chair. He felt a heaviness and a giddiness that surely presaged the
  end; he could not doubt that he was doomed. He had lived among corruption and
  breathed infection for months now; he was withered, even his grief lacked
  passion; he remembered his duty to that kind friend, Sir George Savile and
  his lady, and added some formal lines, tracing the words with an
  effort:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'Sir, this paper is to bid you a hearty farewell for ever,
  and to bring you my humble thanks for all your noble favours. And I hope you
  will believe a dying man, I have as much love as honour for you.</p>

  <p class="letter">'But, dear sir, let your dying chaplain recommend this
  truth to you and your family, that no happiness or solid comfort can be found
  in this vale of tears like living a pious life. Pray, ever remember this
  rule&mdash;never do anything upon which you dare not first ask the blessing
  of God upon the success thereof.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Sir, I made bold in my will with your name as executor,
  and I hope you will not take it ill. I have joined two others with you who
  will take from you the trouble; your favourable aspect will, I know, be a
  great comfort to my distressed orphans.'</p><br>

  <p>His will! He leant back in the chair again, putting his hand over his
  forehead. Yes, he had made that and locked it away in his cabinet. Thomas
  Stanley knew where it was and Ann Trickett. But he was confused by
  distress&mdash;perhaps they might all die and his will never be found.</p>

  <p>But he crushed these displeasing thoughts that 'bit,' as he said to
  himself, 'like the flies of Hell in my distracted brain,' and continued his
  letter, bending low over the paper, steadying his right hand with his left
  hand.</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'Sir, I thank God I am contented to shake hands with all
  the world, and have many comfortable assurances that God will accept me
  through His Son. I find the goodness of God greater than ever I thought or
  imagined, and I wish from my soul that it were not so much abused or
  condemned. I desire, Sir, that you will be pleased to make choice of a humble
  pious man to succeed me in my parsonage. Could I see your face before my
  departure hence, I would inform you in what manner I think he may live
  comfortable among his people, which would be some satisfaction to me before I
  die.'</p><br>

  <p>"Yes, that is true," said the Rector, "I do have many comfortable
  assurances that God Himself will accept me. I will believe, I will! What does
  all this suffering mean but a little waiting in the ante-chamber that leads
  us to eternal life?"</p>

  <p>He looked round the shadows that fluttered in the light cast by the
  lengthening candle flame. He saw the threatening figures in the tapestry,
  which seemed to loom larger. The casement slipped the catch and blew wide, a
  gust of foul air came in from the infected churchyard.</p>

  <p>As the Rector turned in his chair he saw his motto worked by Kate's
  impatient fingers in the tapestry: 'For God Alone.' And it seemed to him he
  could hear a rustling and a hissing about him and he felt like crumbled dust
  blown upon by evil spirits.</p>

  <p>To fortify himself he took the quill again and wrote:</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'Dear Sir, I beg the prayers of all about you that I may
  not be daunted by the powers of Hell, and that I may when dying be graced
  with pity and with tears. I beg that when you are praying for fatherless
  orphans, you will remember my two pretty babes.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Pardon the rude style of this paper and believe me that I
  am, dear sir, your humble and obedient servant,</p>

  <p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">William Mompesson</span>.'</p><br>

  <p>That letter sealed and placed with the other, he sat back in his chair and
  closed his eyes. A great weakness was upon him and the air seemed full of
  voices as if he was called in this direction and that.</p>

  <p>"What am I," he muttered, "but a quickening mass of clay?"</p>

  <p>Even an attempt to reason with God's dealings was a presumption, even to
  make an inner cry of anguish against the fate that had robbed him of his
  wife, that had put this task upon him&mdash;even that was a sin. 'I must go
  on, I must be patient, I must do His will. And perhaps afterwards my God will
  give me a sunshine after tempest&mdash;a drop of bright essence after so much
  foul mud.' The Rector scarcely noticed Ann Trickett and Bessie going about
  the house on their several duties. They seemed to him but flat shapes without
  substance or colour. He answered their questions kindly and ate the food they
  put before him. Sometimes he roused himself to bid them both leave the
  Rectory, for he and Thomas Stanley could shift for themselves, and surely he
  was a doomed man. He felt a grave indisposition upon him and believed he
  hastened his death with every breath he sucked in. Once he spoke to Bessie
  with great tenderness.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast done enough, child, and mayst now think of purer air. Go up
  into one of the cottages in the mountains and live there until the infection
  is over/' But his thoughts soon went even from Bessie, and he did not hear
  her answer. But as through many mists he saw her smiling and guessed at her
  denial. Bessie, like himself, was consecrate. But no symptoms of the plague
  appeared on any of the inhabitants of the Rectory and the Rector went about
  his duty, though expecting every time he bared his bosom to see the spots
  that were the mark of death placed there.</p>

  <p>Five days after his wife's death he made up the register again.</p>

  <p>There had only been three days&mdash;the sixth, the twenty-sixth, and the
  last day of August&mdash;in which no one had died, while the whole number who
  perished in the other twenty-eight days was seventy-eight. The number of
  people in the village on the first of that month had been under two
  hundred.</p>

  <p>"There are now," said Thomas Stanley, as he helped the Rector fill up the
  register, "few left to die. Our tasks grow lighter, sir, there are not so
  many now to visit. The houses eastwards and to the middle of the village are
  nearly all empty."</p>

  <p>"Ay," replied William Mompesson, "and those at the west, and they are but
  few I think, have shut themselves in and will let none cross the stream. How
  many do you consider are left?"</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley, who was the more active of the two and the one who went
  more frequently abroad and knew the desolation that reigned in the farms, the
  outlying huts and hovels, made out that the souls under their joint care were
  then under one hundred persons.</p>

  <p>If the plague did not abate, but continued at this rate of mortality,
  everyone in the village would be extinct by the first or second week in
  October.</p>

  <p>Thomas Stanley calculated that there would be ten or a dozen corpses left
  unburied&mdash;the last survivors having no choice but to fall and corrupt in
  the street or on the threshold of their homes. With an iron fortitude that
  caused William Mompesson to shudder, he made his plans that he now put before
  the Rector.</p>

  <p>For, as he said drily, the plague might increase instead of decreasing,
  and if it occurred at a higher rate than hitherto, all might be extinct in
  another fortnight or three weeks. Therefore they should prepare a paper,
  giving the state of affairs clearly, and enclose it with a copy of their
  Wills and the register in as stout a parchment case as they could and have it
  ready to set upon one of the boundary stones when they saw the final
  catastrophe occurring.</p>

  <p>"And we must leave directions," added the dissenter, "that my Lord, at
  Chatsworth, shall send hardy people, preferably those who have had the
  plague, down into the village to bury the remaining dead, to burn the
  furniture and linen in the pest-house, and to send another clergyman here to
  consecrate such graves as still be forlorn."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we will do that," replied the Rector, steadying himself. "And I will
  leave instructions on my wife's grave of the tomb that I desire set above it,
  and the inscription. A square, solid tomb with at the corners four stone
  pillars and thus I would have the inscription."</p>

  <p>He drew a piece of paper under his hand, on which he had written in a
  clear writing and elegant Latin:</p>

  <p>'Catherine, wife of William Mompesson, Rector of this church, daughter of
  Ralph Carr, Esquire, late of Cockden, in the County of Durham, was buried on
  the twenty-fifth day of August, Sixteen Sixty-six.'</p>

  <p>"It is well enough," said the dissenter. "Why concern yourself about such
  matters now?"</p>

  <p>Taking no heed of this interruption, the Rector continued, smiling to
  himself slowly and sadly: "I would have an hour-glass cut between two
  extended wings&mdash;she died so young&mdash;and underneath on a tablet
  'Cave,' and nearer the base the words: '<i>Nescitas horam</i>,' while at the
  other end shall be a skull with the words: '<i>Mors mihi lucrum</i>.' Why do
  I linger here?"</p>

  <p>"These are but trifles and frivolities," rebuked the Puritan. "There are
  still nearly a hundred souls in our charge, and all of them are in distress,
  wailing with pain or mortal anguish. As I passed by Sythe Torre's hut this
  morning, I heard rude lamentations issuing, and when I entered the place, I
  found that his wife, Joan, had died and the son whom he greatly cherished. So
  I believe that hard heart has been struck at last. He told me, with many
  horrible blasphemies, that his wife had often entreated him not to bring the
  goods from the infected cottages into his place. But he would, and had
  hoarded them there. And I consoled him for that, for it was like enough the
  woman and boy had died in any case."</p>

  <p>"But he seems immune," said the Rector, with a look of horror, "as if the
  Devil indeed did protect him."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he does. Satan has a certain power," admitted Thomas Stanley
  grimly. "I have been myself twice to the spot that Sythe Torre has told me of
  and where he says he has seen the Enemy of Man grinning from an ivyed rock.
  But I saw nothing. Yet if I did, I believe I could force the foul fiend to
  give an account of himself." He spoke with such emphasis that the Rector was
  moved even out of his own bemusement to look at him shrewdly and say:</p>

  <p>"You are a strong man yourself, Thomas Stanley."</p>

  <p>"I have been through war and prison and other pestilence than this. I have
  had my blind and desperate fits, I have been through my heap of dark days.
  But it seems that God has made a truce with this dust that I am."</p>

  <p>"Thou art assured of salvation?" asked the Rector, folding up the register
  of dead. "Tell me, before once more we go about this work that seems so
  useless, thou art assured of Paradise?"</p>

  <p>The two men looked at each other steadily across the golden morning light
  that filled the study where they stood. For William Mompesson had risen with
  his question and the dissenter had never been seated.</p>

  <p>"Dost thou doubt?" asked the Puritan steadily.</p>

  <p>"I did not speak of myself, but of thee," replied William Mompesson."
  Methinks thou hast no great gladness or radiancy about thee as a man who
  expects to be soon in eternal glory, but rather a doggedness as one who does
  a duty out of a native courage and obstinacy."</p>

  <p>A smile softened Thomas Stanley's coarse features.</p>

  <p>"Did He not beckon out my brutish soul, even from the grave and womb of
  darkness? Dost thou think the link between Him and me could be broken now?
  Though I go my way in silence, I am not asleep. What is it to be, what shall
  it be to you that this pestilence has a little abridged our life? View thy
  forerunners, William Mompesson, are they not all humble dust, crushed beneath
  the foot or left to the winds? Do not all things teach us to die, point out
  the way we must go? Do not birds, beasts, trees, flowers, herbs in the
  fields, take their leave and die? Have they not one large
  language&mdash;Death? What is to turn mist to beams, damps to day but the
  glory of the Spirit?"</p>

  <p>"The link! The link!" cried William Mompesson. "Ay, that's it&mdash;the
  link 'twixt God and me. Sometimes a dead sleep is upon me, I shrink and pine,
  I cannot feel that I am next to Him. Is it enough to pay one's debts, to face
  death and do one's duty?</p>

  <p>"Surely," replied the Puritan, "it is not enough. But thou dost more. Thou
  hast thy moments of prayer. Thou hast no vices or sins, Mompesson, to soil
  and haunt thy door. Thou canst be cured&mdash;and speedily. Thou mayest yet
  feed among the lilies."</p>

  <p>The Rector did not answer. He stood with downcast eyes leaning heavily on
  the back of the chair on which his arms were embroidered by Kate's impatient
  fingers. And the Puritan added:</p>

  <p>"And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the
  Spirit. Even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the
  adoption&mdash;to wit, the redemption of our bodies."</p>

  <p>September continued in sultry heat, and William Mompesson kept under his
  hand his Will:</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'Inasmuch as a great calamity has befallen this town or
  village of Eyam, and death has already visited my dwelling, as all are in
  daily expectation of death, and as I humbly consider myself on the verge of
  eternity, I therefore while in sound mind do give and bequeath as hereafter
  noted my worldly effects...'</p><br>

  <p>The gates of the churchyard were now closed against the dead; even those
  who had money could not purchase a shroud, much less a coffin. Those whom
  Sythe Torre did not draw with a napkin round the neck were taken out on an
  old door or chair to serve as bier.</p>

  <p>Nearly forty people died during September. This death toll was not as high
  as the dissenter had expected, and they came into October with still more
  than fifty souls under their charge.</p>

  <p>Nor had the seeds of the disease ripened within the Rector. He said he had
  cast off the indisposition that had seized him soon after the death of his
  wife, and seemed despite all his privations and fatigues to be restored to a
  perfect health. Nor was Thomas Stanley touched.</p>

  <p>No one broke the solemn injunctions laid upon them by the two clergymen to
  attempt to leave the village. Apart from their habit of obedience and any
  generous resolve they might have made to stay the infection spreading over
  the district, they well knew they would be beaten back, if they tried to pass
  the boundary into a neighbouring village; for a woman who had tried thus to
  escape and who had been found in a field about a mile or two beyond the
  boundary, had been stoned by a farmer and his children and forced, bruised
  and exhausted, to return.</p>

  <p>Nor did the Lord-Lieutenant send any help beyond encouraging letters and
  such provisions and medicines as were left upon the stones. He wrote in terms
  of warm admiration of the work done by William Mompesson and Thomas Stanley,
  and rewarded their efforts, as he put it, by informing them that save one or
  two scattered instances that had been promptly dealt with, the plague was
  concentrated in Eyam and had not spread to the neighbouring places or towns,
  and the outbreaks that there had been in Buxton and Derby had been quelled.
  Indeed, the whole neighbourhood was healthy, except this village of
  desolation, which seemed to have been offered up as a sacrifice or scapegoat
  in order that Derbyshire might escape the pest.</p>

  <p>When the Rector read this letter, he was in the field at the back of the
  church, and the autumn landscape was gold and bronze and honey-coloured about
  him, and the sky was purple overhead and the air infected with a sickly,
  faint, yet luscious smell, as if the last autumn flowers that straggled in
  the hedgerows were tainted by the corruption of the soil.</p>

  <p>He folded up the letter, which had been brought him by Sythe Torre, and
  thrust it in his bosom, and a dull spasm of revolt shook his frame. 'Why was
  I elected to do this work? I did not like these people, I did not belong to
  them, I have lost my Kate and all my happiness.'</p>

  <p>He wished that the plague would move more swiftly and by death end this
  expectation of death. If but two a day died, another month would see them all
  at peace.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson longed to burst the bonds of his own fatigued flesh and
  prove for himself the reality of Heaven and reunion with Catherine. He had
  glorified his love for her, so that now in his memory it surpassed that of
  lovers or husband and wife and became a mystical passion.</p>

  <p>And so did the desolation about him, and his fatigue, and the constant
  sight of suffering and death, and the stern fortitude of Thomas Stanley exalt
  and support him, that he scarcely noted when Bessie died.</p>

  <p>She had looked, he knew, for days pale and sad, but he could hardly
  remember when she had looked otherwise. And when he missed her from the
  supper table and Ann Trickett said she was a-bed, he had risen up almost
  mechanically and gone to his laboratory and opened the new stock of cordials
  and physics sent by the Earl and taken out what was needful for the early
  stages of the plague and gone to Bessie's room.</p>

  <p>She had refused everything, though with sweetness. For months she had been
  slowly detaching herself from life and now she welcomed, with ecstasy,
  release. She had a secret to tell him before she went. That was something
  that startled him, even apart as he was from worldly things.</p>

  <p>Bessie Carr, before she died, told her brother-in-law that Janot or Nell,
  the mummers' girl, who had been the paramour of Jack Corbyn, was living in
  the deserted old Hall.</p>

  <p>"And I used to take her food every day, for she dare not come out, as the
  villagers think she is a witch and a wanton and would probably stone or drown
  her. You know, since the old woman, Mother Sydall, died, Janot has nowhere to
  go. So she crept out there. And once when I went, because it had been Jack's
  home and was going to be mine, I found her."</p>

  <p>William Mompesson moistened the girl's dry lips.</p>

  <p>"I know what you would ask me, dear heart&mdash;that I should continue to
  protect this wretched creature."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she is truly repentant. She is prepared to die. But do not let it be
  like a dog's death, without comfort."</p>

  <p>That night Bessie Carr died herself, and Ann Trickett swathed her in all
  that was left to them of linen&mdash;two petticoats ripped open and joined
  down the middle, and Jonathan Mortin and the two clergymen carried her out,
  and though the churchyard was closed, they took her in at night and laid her
  beside her sister, close in one grave.</p>

  <p>"We must believe," said William Mompesson, "that God loves us. We must
  believe that He will respect our courage and our dignity. We must believe
  that in His infinite goodness He sent the plague into Eyam in a wedding
  gown."</p>

  <p>When he had said these words to himself, the Rector leant forward, and
  dating his letter 'November the twentieth, sixteen sixty-six,' he wrote to
  John Beilby, Esquire, the uncle of his wife, who had in charge the two
  children.</p>

<br>

  <p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">'I suppose this letter will seem to you no less than a
  miracle. That my habitation is <i>inter vivos</i>.</p>

  <p class="letter">'I have got these lines transcribed by a friend, being loth
  to affright you with a letter from my hand.</p>

  <p class="letter">'You are sensible of my state, the loss of the kindest wife
  in the world, whose life was amiable and end most comfortable. Had I been as
  thankful as my condition did deserve, I might have had my dearest dear in my
  bosom. Now farewell all happy days, and God grant that I may repent my sad
  ingratitude.</p>

  <p class="letter">'The condition of this place has been so sad that I
  persuade myself it did exceed all history and example. The town has become a
  Golgotha, the place of a skull, and had there not been a small remnant left
  we had been as Sodom and Gomorrah. My ears never heard such doleful
  lamentations, my nose never smelled such horrid smells, and my eyes never
  beheld such ghastly spectacles. There have been seventy-six families visited
  within my parish, out of which two hundred and fifty-nine people died. Now,
  blessed be God, all our fears are over, for none have died since the eleventh
  of October and the pest-houses have long been empty.</p>

  <p class="letter">'I intend, God willing, to spend this week seeing all
  woollen clothes fumed and purified for the satisfaction and safety of the
  country. There have been such burning of goods that the like, I think, was
  never known.</p>

  <p class="letter">'For my part, I have scarcely apparel to shelter my body,
  having wasted more than I needed merely for example. During this dreadful
  visitation I have not had the least symptom of disease nor have I ever had
  better health. My man had the distemper and upon the appearance of the
  tumours I gave him some chemical antidotes which operated and after the
  rising broke he was very well. My maid continues in health, which was a
  blessing, for had she failed, I should have been ill-set to wash and have
  gotten my provisions.</p>

  <p class="letter">'I know I have your prayers, and I conclude that the
  prayers of good people have rescued me from the jaws of death. Certainly I
  had been in the dust, had not violence been conquered by holy
  omnipotence.</p>

  <p class="letter">'I have largely tasted of the goodness of the Creator, and
  the grim looks of death never yet affrighted me. I always had a firm faith
  that my babes would do well, which made me willing to shake hands with the
  unkind and froward world. Yet I shall esteem it a mercy, if I am frustrated
  in the hopes I had of a translation to a better place.</p>

  <p class="letter">'And God grant that with patience I may await for my change
  and that I may make a right use of His mercy. As the one has been tart, so
  the other has been sweet and comfortable.</p>

  <p class="letter">'I perceive by a letter from Mistress Newby your concern
  for my welfare. I make no question that I have your unfailing love and
  affection. I assure you that during my troubles you have had a great deal of
  room in my thoughts. Be pleased, dear sir, to accept this as a sign of my
  kind respect for you and all my dear relations.</p>

  <p class="letter">'I can assure you that a line from your hand will be
  welcome to your sorrowful and affectionate nephew,</p>

  <p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">William Mompesson</span>.'</p><br>

  <p>He concluded the letter and sealed it, placing it in another envelope
  addressed to the Lord-Lieutenant with the desire that it might be fumigated
  again at Chatsworth and copied by a safe hand, that of my Lord's secretary,
  Mr. Newton. For he did not wish to send direct to the house where his
  children sheltered any letter from the infected town.</p>

  <p>Then he rose and glanced round the bare room. The tapestry was gone, and
  the chair embroidered by Kate's hand, and the carpet on the floor, and the
  Persian drapery on the side table.</p>

  <p>As he said, he had wasted more than he needed for the sake of an example.
  All these treasures had been burnt on the village common, together with the
  poor rags used by the patients in the pest-house and the simple hangings and
  rude bedclothes of the villagers.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson was even a little cold, for he had tossed into the flames
  most of the woollen suits that he had worn during the preceding winter, it
  being his rooted conviction that the germs lurked longest in woollen
  material. And he had left but one cloth cloak, and that an old one that he
  had kept at the back of the press and that was not, therefore, he thought,
  tainted.</p>

  <p>He left the room with his letter and gave it to Ann Trickett, who was
  putting out food on a tray.</p>

  <p>"Take this up to the stone, Ann," he said, "for Jonathan Mortin must come
  with me. We try to finish the burning this week."</p>

  <p>The manservant joined him; he was yellow and bent, his face marked with
  purple scars, for he had, by a miracle as all exclaimed, recovered from the
  plague, and with, his recovery, regained much of his strength. Always a
  silent man, he now seldom spoke at all, and the Rector would have thought
  that he had lost touch with God save that he was always assiduous at morning
  and evening prayer, and always came when a service was held in the Cucklett
  Dell, kneeling throughout, not sitting as some did, through apathy or
  languor, on the stones.</p>

  <p>The Rector thought that these outdoor services might now cease. The
  weather was becoming colder, there were frosts at night and the fallen leaves
  lay thick on the winter-bitten ground.</p>

  <p>Fumigants had been burnt in the church and William Mompesson and Thomas
  Stanley agreed it might be used again. There were now, counting those who
  straggled in from the hovels they had built themselves on the moors and in
  the rocks, about thirty people to attend these services.</p>

  <p>The Rector and Jonathan Mortin, carrying between them a pile of napkins,
  cloths and the hangings from Kate's bed, which the Rector had spared to the
  last, proceeded through the winter afternoon to the common.</p>

  <p>The bonfire was lit; a straggle of flame rose against a murk of smoke that
  obscured the infected houses whose black windows and open doors showed their
  emptiness.</p>

  <p>Janot was helping two other women to pile some fragments of wood from the
  pest-house on the heap of charred furniture and hangings.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson took from his servant Kate's bed curtains worked with
  her design of foxes and acorns and laid them by the bonfire.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THY BEGGAR GLAD</h2>

  <p class="first">THEN the Lord-Lieutenant learned from the letters left upon
  the boundary stones that the plague had ceased in Eyam, and that a month had
  passed without there being any sign of it either in the village or on the
  surrounding farms, he came with his servants, secretary, and physician to
  visit the place to see who might be surviving and to offer his help to Thomas
  Stanley and William Mompesson with whom he had kept in such close touch
  during all the time of the desolation. For my Lord had refused all entreaties
  from his family to leave Chatsworth and had remained at his post, using great
  diligence and skill in procuring even the most outlandish demands of the two
  clergymen and their flock in the way of medicines and antidotes, so that on
  some occasions ingredients worth many pounds had been sought for from afar
  and left on the stones without price.</p>

  <p>Shortly before his visit to the village, the Earl had been wandering in a
  gloomy mood in the large grounds of Chatsworth, which then were covered with
  a light fall of early snow.</p>

  <p>He had been musing by the banks of a small rivulet, which the frost was
  not yet strong enough to lock up, and he had seen stranded among the
  submerged pebbles and smooth stones a piece of paper folded like a child's
  paper boat, and he had recalled at once how he and William Mompesson had
  stood talking together, before the plague was even thought of in Derbyshire,
  while the little boy had made these boats from sheets of his father's sermon
  and had sent them floating down the stream.</p>

  <p>So he went on one knee and caught the piece of paper up from between the
  stones. On it was written some incoherent words in an ink that had been
  washed but not become illegible: <i>'The year of the plague, sixteen hundred
  and sixty-six:'</i></p>

  <pre>

<i>'There's not a wind can stir,
Or beam pass by,
But straight I think, though far,
Thy hand is nigh.</i>
</pre>

  <p class="letter">'Unto Him that loved us and washed us from our sins in His
  own blood and has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father. To Him
  be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. Amen. Amen.'</p><br>

  <p>The Earl had this poor paper in his pouch as he rode through the stricken
  village.</p>

  <p>Everything was changed in Eyam, even to the superficial glance of the
  outward eye. The houses, having lacked for some while any repair, were most
  of them dilapidated. Doors hung askew, window-frames empty, the roofs were
  broken, the chimneys fallen. Grass, now winter-parched and dying, choked the
  wide streets, and lank lush weeds, still kept fresh by the running water,
  hampered the stream that divided the western from the eastern end. There was
  no guard at the old lych-gate where for so many generations the villagers had
  taken turn to watch.</p>

  <p>"How many left alive did Mr. Mompesson say?" the Earl gravely asked his
  companion, Mr. Walbeoffe, the physician, and he answered: "He said thirty
  persons. And of those, my Lord, I believe some half live in the outlying
  farms."</p>

  <p>"There is no smoke from any of the chimneys," said my Lord, "although the
  winds are surly."</p>

  <p>It was a grey and frost-bitten day; dark curling clouds eclipsed the
  winter sun when the little cavalcade reached the common that had been the
  scene of St. Helen's Wake. The melancholy sky overhung bare trees, trampled
  and defaced grass, a heap of fallen masonry where the pest-house had once
  stood and a great space of burnt ground and ashes, from the centre of which
  rose a column of smoke steadily into the still air from a small bonfire.</p>

  <p>Round this moved a group of dull figures that my Lord, reining his ambling
  horse in softly, looked at with amazement, for he knew none of them.</p>

  <p>These people had their heads bound with rags, brown in colour from
  repeated dippings in vinegar, but not foul. Indeed, my Lord observed as he
  approached that these people, though but scarecrow wretches in their general
  outline, were wondrous clean, their hands being discoloured and sodden from
  scrubbing, their faces chapped, cheeks close-shaven, their hair cropped.</p>

  <p>They wore coarse country clothes and sprigs of herbs were thrust into
  their nostrils. Two of them smoked short clay pipes.</p>

  <p>As they moved about their work, which was the burning of garments and
  pieces of furniture, which they broke first with mallets and hammers, they
  sang, to a rude native melody, a hymn. Their voices, though harsh, were sure
  and full of zeal.</p>

<pre>

<i>"Leave, leave thy gadding thoughts,
Who pores And spies
Still out of doors,
Decries
Within them naught.
The skin and shell of things Though fair Are not
Thy wish, nor pray'r,
But got
By mere despair Of wings.
To rack old elements Or dust And say
Sure here He must Needs stay
Is not the way Nor just."</i>
</pre>

  <p class="first"><i>"Search well another world; who studies this Travels in
  clouds, seeks manna where none is."</i></p><br>

  <p>Hearing the horses, these haggard people stared up, stayed their singing
  and one lean wretch cried:</p>

  <p>"What, hast thou brought us more stuff to burn? Soon there will not be a
  napkin or a wollen coat in the whole of the Peak."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mompesson!" cried my Lord, deeply shocked. "Mr. Thomas Stanley! Who
  is here? I entreat you to come forward!"</p>

  <p>He now perceived in the fore-front of the miserable group three men and a
  woman, the latter defaced by what seemed a leprosy over her countenance.
  There was nothing in raiment or looks to distinguish them, and it was a
  moment or two before my Lord knew these ragged men to be Mr. William
  Mompesson, Mr. Thomas Stanley, and Jonathan Mortin, the servant.</p>

  <p>The dissenter was the least changed; his countenance, which had formerly
  been rude and gross, was purified in colour and sharpened in outline. His
  clothes hung slackly on a gaunt frame. He looked an old man of perhaps
  seventy years, but there was still vigour in his glance and in his movements,
  as after a brief salutation he continued to pile the clothes and stick them
  with the metal-pronged fork on the bonfire.</p>

  <p>Jonathan Mortin was heavily scarred across the face with dry scabs of the
  pox. His head was tied in a woollen scarf and he sang continually to
  himself.</p>

  <p>William Mompesson, without his clerical attire, his elegant, auburn curls,
  his look of melancholy composure, was the most changed of the three; his
  eyes, so bloodshot and hollowed as to have lost all their original beauty,
  had a glance that the Earl could not understand. It seemed quizzical, almost
  as if he smiled; he wore a rude garment like a smock, of a greenish colour,
  cotton stockings, and cobbled shoes.</p>

  <p>He came forward, as if not much surprised, and said:</p>

  <p>"I had not expected your Lordship so soon. Yet I do not think you run any
  danger, for the place is now clear of the plague."</p>

  <p>"I am ashamed to talk of danger, when you are present, Mr. Mompesson. How
  many are left?"</p>

  <p>He glanced up the ruined street, where the windows and doors were blank in
  the grey afternoon.</p>

  <p>"We count fifteen souls here," replied the Rector, pointing to the gaunt,
  tattered-looking villains who were helping him. "We thought to have done with
  this work, but to-day there came in another cartload of furniture and clothes
  from a farm where they had the plague. So we are burning it. But I think this
  is the last of our fires."</p>

  <p>"How have you borne this?" said my Lord, dismounting and giving the reins
  to his servant. "How have you endured to stay here? What, sir, is your
  formula for this courage?"</p>

  <p>To which William Mompesson replied that they should "seek the Lord, if
  haply they might steal after Him and find Him, though He be not far from
  every one of us. For in Him we live and move and have our being."</p>

  <p>"There must," said my Lord painfully, "have been many mists and shadows
  between you and this truth, Mr. Mompesson. And it is hard to understand why
  it should have been obeyed and why so many should have died terribly."</p>

  <p>And he looked at the Puritan who, leaning on his fork, asked with a grim
  smile:</p>

  <p>"Sir, do you come to take me to Derby jail?"</p>

  <p>"Thy zeal," replied my Lord, "has earned my charity. Go in peace, Mr.
  Thomas Stanley."</p>

  <p>The dissenter did not thank him, but smiled more deeply and returned to
  his work, as one who had no concern with this world.</p>

  <p>The Earl stood silent, afraid, for he felt a deep gulf between himself and
  these people, though he had been communicating with them intimately for so
  long; to him they were like strangers, stern angels clothed in the coarse
  habiliments of men, or supernatural creatures like those supposed to haunt
  the lonely moors; he knew that he had no longer anything in common with them.
  They were monstrous in their virtue.</p>

  <p>Nor had they anything to say to him; nothing of what might have been
  expected&mdash;relief at seeing members of the outside world again, joy at
  feeling that the plague had gone at last, anxious enquiry after their friends
  or their fortunes abroad.</p>

  <p>After the few words of greeting, spoken with quiet courtesy, they went
  about their work, scrupulously piling together and burning every particle of
  infected clothing and furniture. And my Lord almost felt foolish as he stood
  there with the physician muttering what sounded, in the face of this, but
  quackeries, by his side, and his servants staring like men ashamed.</p>

  <p>When the task was finished, William Mompesson gathered his helpers
  together, altogether they were but sixteen in number and only three were
  women, and read them a few prayers, and gave them a short address.</p>

  <p>"But to-day," he said, "we will not go to Cucklett Dell, for I think it is
  too cold for these services under the skies. So next Sunday we will meet
  again in the church."</p>

  <p>Then he raised his hand and bade them be of good courage, since God had
  spared them to the last, when He had taken so many others. But they were not
  on that account to make any valuation of their lives, but rather to hold them
  cheap, and he added:</p>

  <p>"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not when the Master of the house cometh,
  at even or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning."</p>

  <p>Then, as they were turning away, he added:</p>

  <p>"I give you this comfort. For as by one man's disobedience many were made
  sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous."</p>

  <p>Then when the helpers were gone to their ruined homes, Mr. Mompesson asked
  my Lord and his attendants if they would come to the Rectory. There was
  something to offer them in the way of repose and refreshment, he said, though
  but little.</p>

  <p>"But you have kept us bountifully supplied, sir. We have never really
  wanted. And I have sacrificed willingly much of my household goods, more than
  was necessary, to encourage the others. So you must not despise, if you find
  my dwelling very strict."</p>

  <p>They all turned towards the Rectory, but my Lord did not like to look to
  right and left because of the empty cottages, the dead nettles and thistles
  growing by the thresholds and the rude mounds that told that the owners were
  buried near where they had lived.</p>

  <p>The woman followed them and my Lord asked who she was. Mr. Mompesson
  replied: "She is one, Janot, who was a strolling player and returned here
  after one she loved. She helped me in the Rectory after Kate and Bessie died,
  and without her I do not think I could have succeeded. She escaped the
  infection, but took a gross complaint in the face which I have cured. The
  other is Jonathan Mortin, my man&mdash;I believe your Lordship met him
  before. And so with Thomas Stanley we made up our little household."</p>

  <p>They passed the church and the Earl glanced up at the tower against a
  curdle of iron-grey clouds, and at the bare linden trees, a still tracery in
  that cold air. He could scarcely repress a groan as he saw how close-packed
  the graves were, as he observed that great mound which hid the pit close by
  the low wall.</p>

  <p>"I have tried to keep the register complete," said the Rector, "but it has
  been difficult. There were but the two of us to go the rounds of our parish
  boundary."</p>

  <p>As they entered the Rectory, my Lord noticed that it was indeed stripped,
  and the physician exclaimed against the extravagance of burning or destroying
  everything, even tapestries and chairs.</p>

  <p>"Ay," said Mompesson with a smile, "I did have a certain tapestry that
  showed Moses and the brazen serpent, which I valued somewhat. It was given me
  by Sir George Savile. But as I said, I did this to encourage others to bring
  out their treasures, which were more to them than mine were to me. This,
  however, I kept," he said. And he picked up a Prayer Book bound with silver
  that lay on the table inside the door. "It belonged to Kate. Is it not
  strange that some chance should make these shreds of skin and scraps of metal
  outlast the pestilence, excel the fair, the young, the lovely?"</p>

  <p>Janot had turned aside to mend the fire that burned on the wide hearth and
  to put over the long table a square of fresh linen. The air, scarcely warmed
  by the flames on the hearth of the Rectory, was sweet and pungent from
  aromatics that burnt continuously.</p>

  <p>The Rector bade Janot bring what they had. Wine and brandy were gone, but
  there were some home-made cordials. Janot had proved a good housewife; she
  could make bread, and they had not yet come to the end of their
  preserves.</p>

  <p>When the girl had left the room, and the men were seated round the blaze,
  the Rector said: "She has given all she has, like Mary Magdalen, to
  God&mdash;her comeliness. She will never more earn her wage as she earned it
  before."</p>

  <p>Jonathan Mortin had left the gentlemen to help in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"He now hardly speaks," said the Rector. "I believe his faith is pure and
  steady."</p>

  <p>Again my Lord felt and more powerfully than before&mdash;indeed so
  forcibly that he was minded to get up and escape from an atmosphere that was
  stifling&mdash;that these people were not human, but mere spectres of
  humanity, ghosts, phantoms, or wraiths. And he said hastily that he must not
  pause to eat or drink, not that he meant any slight on their hospitality, but
  that he was too overwhelmed by the sense of their heroism and suffering to
  put them to any pain on his account; rising, he asked the two clergymen what
  they would do now?</p>

  <p>Mr. Mompesson made a motion of his hand, which had once been so white,
  elegant, and well-cared for and which was now scarred, swollen, and red,
  towards the dissenter, who answered, as if out of an abstraction, that he
  would go his ways again and travel round Derbyshire and minister to his flock
  till he died or was jailed.</p>

  <p>"And I hope soon," he added, "my gazing soul will spy some shadows of
  eternity."</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Mompesson spoke. He said that he was willing to stay in the
  village if Sir George Savile wished, but the task was now for a stouter man.
  He said that one required a great deal of energy to encourage such of the
  villagers as had fled back to their homes, to induce them to bring willing
  helpers with them to rebuild the village, to take up life again.</p>

  <p>"But for me," he ended, "I think I have done my work here. Each night when
  I lie down in my bed, it is like a curtained grave, and sleep lies on me like
  ashes. Yet I know," he added sternly, "that God does shine and move beyond
  that misty shroud."</p>

  <p>He glanced at my Lord and added strangely:</p>

  <p>"How long dost thou think it is till day, sir?"</p>

  <p>"What day do you mean, Mr. Mompesson?"</p>

  <p>"I think of that day when all shall arise, when the Day Star shall
  spring."</p>

  <p>My Lord knew that the stricken man thought of his wife, and he said:</p>

  <p>"Have you arranged for the tomb of Mrs. Mompesson? I have had commands
  from Sir George Savile to see that all is fair set above her grave and no
  cost counted."</p>

  <p>Upon this the Rector became eager in his manner and went upstairs with a
  lighter step than he had used yet, and came down with a bundle of papers in
  his hand and pointed out with great zeal to my Lord the plans he had made for
  the tomb and the motto he had written out.</p>

  <p>He expressed his hope that all his successors in the Rectory would keep a
  yew tree planted near her grave and never move the old Cross from which he
  and Thomas Stanley had preached in the early days of the desolation.</p>

  <p>"I have, sir," he said with enthusiasm, "one pearl&mdash;her
  memory&mdash;left me. And though her body is now in truth a ruined piece that
  the winds and rains beat through and stain, though she has taken to that
  senseless sleep the wages of her sin, though Time, sir, so it seems as I see
  him, is old and slow, with wings dull and sickly, yet the day will come when
  she shall rise, and I, too, from the dust and stones. And not only me but
  they who also have the first-fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves groan
  within ourselves, waiting for the adoption&mdash;to wit, the redemption of
  our bodies."</p>

  <p>"Amen, my Lord. "Amen," said the physician. And the dissenter stood apart,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>Then Jonathan Mortin and Janot, having tidied their garments and washed
  their hands yet again (the girl having put ointment on her scarred face and
  drawn her linen hood discreetly over it), brought in cordials that my Lord
  and his physician and his secretary all drank, looking the while out of the
  uncurtained windows at the bare orchard and the empty hives, and the grey,
  purple vista beyond with the dark curdle of clouds.</p>

  <p>"The day is dark and murk," smiled the Rector, taking the glass of cordial
  from my Lord's hand. "We come upon a dark Egyptian damp. My thoughts, believe
  me, sir, they challenge the brightest day. Sweet downy thoughts, soft
  lily-shades they are, fresh spicy mornings, eternal beams. These visions keep
  me company."</p>

  <p>He then, in a quiet formal tone, asked my Lord if he would come upstairs
  to the laboratory, where all was purged with aromatics, and see the register
  that had been kept carefully as might be?</p>

  <p>And when my Lord and physician and secretary followed him up the
  staircase, Mr. Mompesson spoke but one sentence more of his state. And that
  was:</p>

  <p>"May we not think, my Lord, that we are not all stone and earth, but shine
  a little and have by those weak rays some glimpse of where we come from? We
  see Heaven over our heads, do we not, and know from whence we come? But now,
  no more. Let us complete what we have set our hands to."</p>

  <p>Then he began to talk of his business, and when my Lord reached the
  laboratory, he found not only the register but other ledgers set out very
  plain, in which William Mompesson had entered all the goods he had
  received&mdash;both from my Lord and other sources&mdash;such as had been
  paid for and such as had been given as gifts and loans. He had also written
  notes of the progress of the disease, the various ways in which it attacked
  the various people. He had put down the names of families, their heirs and
  heiresses, and what property there might be to be divided in the future among
  various claimants.</p>

  <p>The Earl bade his secretary note all this, and the physician was very
  curious, too, to hear these accounts of the pestilence and the various forms
  it had taken.</p>

  <p>As they stood there thus debating the desolation of Eyam, the heavy clouds
  outside the window disbanded and scattered, and a few beams fell into the
  laboratory, glittering on the glass jars, retorts, crucibles, and giving a
  lustre to the pots of ointments.</p>

  <p>My Lord chanced to glance up and he saw the Rector's face clear in that
  pale though steady beam, and for the third time he had the impression that he
  was in the presence of someone unearthly, so drained of all sensuality was
  that haggard countenance from which so wild a zeal did those deep-set eyes
  gleam. Yet Mr. Mompesson spoke very quietly, and said that if another might
  take his charge, say in a year's time, he would retire to a hut in Rufford
  Park that he made no doubt Sir George Savile would lend him, and there spend
  some time in peace. And if he was spared, seek later on, another chaplaincy.
  As for his children, his friends would see to them.</p>

  <p>With that my Lord left the Rectory, promising to send some of his servants
  to help in the village, and some of his woodmen, masons, and tenants to look
  after the crops and fencing and rebuilding of the houses. He also promised to
  use all his influence to persuade those who had fled from the village to
  return, and to engage the interest of larger families, such as the Corbyns,
  in coming again to their homes.</p>

  <p>So they took leave of the Rector and of the Nonconformist, who said that
  he was soon going again on his travels as he had no longer any work to do in
  Eyam, since most of those who had followed him in that village were now dead.
  Jonathan Mortin, it was understood, would always stay with his master, while
  the girl Janot would find some place as a serving-maid, if any one would take
  one from the infected village even now. If not, she too would return to
  solitude and build herself a hovel on the moors or in the rocks.</p>

  <p>My Lord was silent for a while, only answering his secretary, who pointed
  out to him the cottage where the tailor, George Vickers, had lived and that
  would surely, he said, be ever after known as the 'plague cottage,' for there
  the plague had come into the village, as was now well ascertained on the
  Rector's own admission, in the wedding dress for Bessie Carr.</p>

  <p>When they were clear of the village, the physician spoke his mind and he
  said:</p>

  <p>"That man sacrificed all those wretches to a mistaken idea. Had he let
  them all scatter at the first sign of the plague, they had not spread it but
  saved their own lives. If they had not kept together, there had been little
  danger. The infection was sealed up in the graves as Lord William said."</p>

  <p>The Earl did not reply. Here was a conundrum he was by no means disposed
  to answer; he left it to God, who had sent the plague to Eyam in a wedding
  dress.</p>

  <p>In the Rectory the visit of my Lord was soon forgotten; when the midday
  meal was eaten and cleared away, they gathered for a service of praise, and
  Janot, who had once been a fair musician, played on Kate's spinet an
  accompaniment to the hymn that the three men sang.</p>

  <pre>

<i>"King of comforts, King of life,
     Thou hast cheer'd me;
And when fears and doubts were rife,
     Thou hast clear'd me.

Not a nook in all my breast
     But Thou fill'st it,
Not a thought that breaks my rest
     But Thou kill'st it.

Therefore with my utmost strength
     I will praise Thee.
And as Thou giv'st line and length
     I will raise Thee.

Not a minute in the year
     But I'll mind Thee,
My seal and bracelet here,
     I will bind Thee.

If then, dread Lord,
     When to Thy board
Thy wretch comes begging,
     He has a flow'r
Or to his pow'r
     Some poor off'ring.

When Thou hast made
     Thy beggar glad,
And fill'd his bosom,
     Let him, though poor,
Strew at Thy door
     That one poor blossom."</i>
</pre>
