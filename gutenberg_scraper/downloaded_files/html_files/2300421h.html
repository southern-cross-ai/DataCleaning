<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Memoir"></a>Memoir </b></h2>
<p>OVER thirty years ago Victor  Daley, then a happy, wondering Irish lad, drifted out to Australia. His head  was full of old tunes and fragments of poetry; his pocket was nearly empty. The  sunshine and freedom of Australia delighted him, and, in careless, vagabond  fashion he enjoyed the fleeting pleasures of the day with little thought of the  morrow. A good companion, &ldquo;a fellow of infinite jest,&rdquo; life to him was a  gallant spectacle, which he loved to look at and did not take seriously.  Worldly success never tempted him, for he was a Bohemian by birth; but he was  also descendant of a bardic sept, and he wanted to be a poet. So he wrote  verses charged with the melancholy regret of the Celt for vanished glories and  the beauty of remote things, dainty opalescent lyrics with hints of fairy  music, witty and ironic verse on passing events, and, occasionally, prose  sketches. When the pressure of hard realities brought sorrow into his life he  wrote more gaily and vigorously than ever. For twenty years or more he charmed  a large number of readers. In this thinly-peopled continent the makers of verse  are numerous, and though Daley never appealed to so large an audience as the  ballad writers, he was the writer best beloved of the writing clan. </p>
<p>Daley travelled through life with  few <i>impedimenta</i>, and left behind no papers from  which biographical data could be drawn. The story of his life which follows  here may, therefore, be inaccurate in some particulars. He believed that he was  born at Navan in the county of Meath, Ireland, on the 5th September, 1858, and  that he was christened Victor James William Patrick. The last two names were  dropped early in life. His father, a soldier, went to India with his regiment  when Victor was an infant. Falling ill there, he sent for his wife and child;  and a few weeks after their arrival the three left for home. The father died on  the voyage. </p>
<p>For some years afterwards Victor  lived with his grandparents, in a district associated with one of the great  periods in Ireland&rsquo;s history, and amongst people who were intensely patriotic  and learned in fairy lore and legend. Memories of the stories he then heard  were vividly retained until the end of his life. Some of them were embodied in  articles written for the Sydney <i>Freeman&rsquo;s Journal</i>, from which  I have taken these passages:&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the front garden of my  grandmother&rsquo;s house there was a great Fairy thorn. They told me, before I began  to know much about history, that Queen Meeva had planted it there with her own  white hands. And, indeed, anything was possible in that country. Green  Emania&mdash;which is now called the Navan Ring&mdash;was within arrow-flight of us, and a  little more than a mile away was a lonely little tarn in the middle of a field.  They called it the King&rsquo;s Stables. The bottom of it was paved with blocks of  stone, and many relics of the days of old had been found there by adventurous  divers. It was really the site of the Great Rath of the Red Branch Knights. The  town-ship is to this day called Creeve Roe (Red Branch). Not far from it, and  under the shadow of McCormack&rsquo;s brae, is Lough na Shade (Clear Water) into  whose depths no man has ever ventured, because of the Great Snake that is below  guarding the crock of gold, which was the treasure of Cormac MacNessa.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;When I was a boy staying out at  night, for the love of the thing and the romance of living in a little hazel  house of my own on the side of the Rath, I saw the Sidhe&mdash;or I thought I saw  them, which was the same thing&mdash;coming out of the long-choked gates of the  Castle of Conchobar, dressed in green and gold and riding on little white  horses on their way to Lough na Shade. Some distance away&mdash;five hundred yards or  so&mdash;from the Rath is a little mound, smooth as the breast of a giantess, that  had been ploughed over and sown with corn in the early spring and grown in the  last spring, and yellow in the summer, and thick with whispering tongues and  listening ears in the autumn. This was once the Speckled House. A Scotchman by  the name of Leeman owns the place now, or rather he owned it when I was a boy. My  grandfather used to say that, if we had our rights and Cromwell and James the  First had never been born, the great house would have been ours, and the  Leemans would have been calling at our back door begging some seed potatoes and  the loan of a furrow or two from our fine black-soil field in which to plant  them. &lsquo;Princes in the land we were in the old time,&rsquo; my grandfather would  observe, &lsquo;and let neither of you boys ever forget the fact.&rsquo; I was about eight  years old then, and his son&mdash;my uncle&mdash;was over thirty.&hellip; My uncle was a  sub-centre of Fenians, and I myself was probably the most violent rebel in the  whole county of Armagh.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Daley&rsquo;s mother, who was of  Scottish descent, married again and removed to Devonport, England. Victor,  about 14 at the time, was sent to the Christian Brother&rsquo;s school in that town.  What he valued most afterwards was the privilege to browse at large in the  school library, and he then became fired with an enthusiasm for literature. At  16 he passed a Civil Service examination, and entered the Great Western Railway  Company&rsquo;s office in Plymouth. </p>
<p>After three years, he tired of the  work and grew restless. His stepfather had relatives in Adelaide who were  childless, and he suggested that it might be a good thing for Victor to join  them. Australia appeared to the boy&rsquo;s mind as something like a modern  Hy-Brasil, and he gladly agreed to go. </p>
<p>Early in 1878 he reached Sydney;  there he left the ship, as he liked the look of the place and thought Adelaide  was within easy reach. His slender stock of money dwindled away and he took a  job as gardener to a clergyman, although he knew nothing of gardening&mdash;as the  clergyman soon discovered. Before long he got to Adelaide, where he found  employment as a correspondence clerk. </p>
<p>In Adelaide, Daley experimented a  good deal in verse and some of his rhymes were printed in a local paper. By  chance a love-lyric of his was sent to an office client instead of a letter;  remonstrances followed, and Daley left for Melbourne. He had a vague idea of  going on to Noumea, but at a race meeting in Melbourne he lost all his money,  and had to turn to free-lance journalism for a living. For a time he was on the  staff&mdash;in fact, he was all the staff&mdash;of a suburban paper. Then some of his  verses were printed in Melbourne papers; two striking sonnets appeared in <i>The  Victorian Review</i>, and Daley became acquainted with the principal  writers of the city. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Marcus Clarke once,&rdquo; he  said later on in a <i>Bulletin</i> article.  &ldquo;Somebody whose name I have forgotten introduced me, and said with pompous sarcasm  that I was a young aspirant to literature, and that Marcus had better look  after his laurels. I felt furiously ashamed and distressed, but Clarke nodded  kindly, shook my hand, and told me that he would say something to me about  literature later on. I inferred from the tone of his voice that the information  he had to give me would not be pleasant. He never gave it. George Walstab was  there, and Garnet Walch and Grosvenor Bunster, and, I think, Bob Whitworth and  others. The conversation flowed on. I was in Paradise&mdash;a Paradise that smelt of  whisky and cigar-smoke, and echoed with light-hearted laughter. I had  previously read <i>La Vie de Boh&egrave;me</i>, and I said  to myself, &lsquo;This is Bohemia, indeed.&rsquo; And it was. All good fellows. All good  writers. Then, in a pause of the conversation, while they were ordering drinks,  or lighting their pipes or something, Marcus Clarke turned to me and asked me  what I was doing&mdash;meaning I suppose, in that galley. I replied that I was by  trade a correspondence clerk, but I was then writing for a suburban paper, and  never wanted to be a correspondence clerk again. Some member of the company,  who was passing out of the room, tapped me on the shoulder and said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t  give away your silk purse for a sow&rsquo;s ear.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t catch his meaning at the  moment, but all the others laughed. Now I know why they laughed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>One happy-go-lucky acquaintance of  this time, Larry Spruhan&mdash;the &ldquo;half Galahad, half Don Juan&rdquo; of a poem in <i>At  Dawn and Dusk</i>&mdash;lured Daley away from writing suburban leaders on  European politics&mdash;&ldquo;which must have made the iron knees of Bismarck knock with  terror.&rdquo; Spruhan was off to prospect for gold, and promised to send for Daley  as soon as he had good news. For a week or two, I believe, Daley sold Japanese  pottery at the Melbourne Exhibition of 1880. The profit was magnificent, but  the tenure of office all too brief. Soon news came from Spruhan at Queanbeyan,  N.S.W.&mdash;&ldquo;Struck it rich, come at once.&rdquo; Daley, with a friend named Caddy, took  the train as far north as their funds would allow, and then tramped. They had a  number of adventures before they arrived at Queanbeyan and found that Spruhan  had disappeared. Daley got a billet on a local paper, and stayed about six  months. </p>
<p>Moving on to Sydney he worked for  the expiring <i>Sydney Punch</i> and the newly established <i>Bulletin</i>. He met  Kendall, whose poems he greatly admired, and mixed with the little group of  artists and writers who were as an oasis in the desert of money-making people.  Writing of them twenty-five years afterwards, he remembered them all as jolly  fellows. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody about town seemed to  know everybody else in those days. There were, of course, some of them who did  not like each other; but I think that, on the whole, there was more geniality  on the streets than there is now.... I believe also that there was more real <i>camaraderie</i> amongst  musicians, artists, pressmen and even actors than there is at the present day.  Possibly this was because they were all young&mdash;in spirit, if not in years&mdash;and  doing fairly well without making slaves of themselves.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Somewhere about 1885 Daley went  back to Melbourne, and wrote with varying fortune for most of the papers there,  as well as for <i>The Bulletin</i>. In 1898 it  was arranged to publish a selection of his verses, and in that year he returned  to Sydney in connection with the book. At  Dawn and Dusk was moderately successful. Australian reviewers, almost  without exception, praised it highly, and many predicted that it would be  warmly received in Britain; but it made no impression there. While Daley&rsquo;s work  had a unique place in the regard of Australians, it was, not unnaturally,  slighted by British reviewers because of the absence of local colour. </p>
<p>By that time Daley had ceased to  care for fame. He had no illusions about the place of his verses in the pageant  of poetry. He was satisfied if his writings would earn him enough to live upon,  and glad that they had introduced him to the society he liked. Many times in  earlier years he had meditated a big work in verse which would express all he  had thought about Things-in-General. He began one when staying on the  Hawkesbury River in 1884, and the result was printed as &ldquo;Fragments of a  frustrate poem.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I yet shall sing my splendid  song;<br>
The world is young, the world is strong&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>he cried, and tried again, but  found that he was incapable of sustained effort. </p>
<p>Only for brief periods had he  tried to do any regular work, apart from literature. After <i>At  Dawn and Dusk</i> was published, a place was obtained for him in a  Government Office in Sydney; but the adding of perpendicular columns of figures  and making them agree with horizontal columns was an agony not to be borne.  &ldquo;That way madness lies,&rdquo; he said, and walked out. </p>
<p>From the conventional standpoint  his life was a failure. Yet he had practical wisdom and a respect for  conventions; if he had tried he might have succeeded, as many lesser men have  done. He never cared to try. Life seemed too precious to waste in striving for  money or position, and his temperament demanded freedom from routine. He came  to know that a bitter price had to be paid for freedom, and he paid it without  grumbling. Daley was as unhappy as Charles Lamb if long away from the city, and  a vagabond life in town is without the purifying influences which the fresh  hand of Nature can bestow. In a city there are many taverns, and at times Daley  touched the mire. Yet he remained unsoiled; for he was clean at heart, and,  apart from the irregularities of Bohemia, he had no vices. Many stories,  grotesque and humorous, have been told about him; and in time to come the Daley  of legend may be a figure resembling the Beloved Vagabond of Locke&rsquo;s romance. </p>
<p>There was nothing riotous in Daley&rsquo;s  nature. He confessed that he had never had a grand passion and seldom  experienced profound emotion. His colour sense was not opulent; but he thrilled  to the beauty of delicate shades, and preferred the faint green dawn to the  sunrise, the dusk to the sunset. His talk was excellent. He touched any subject  of conversation with a gleaming fancy, and would risk much for a jest. Of his  desultory reading he remembered the anecdotes, the picturesque images, the  magic phrases, and unconsciously echoed some of them in his own lines. He was a  true votary of old world Romance, and some of its glamor he cast over the  continuous stream of bright shining verse which flowed from his pen&mdash; finely  pure, but thin when it was seen running side by side with that broader and more  turbulent current which was coloured by Australian soil. </p>
<p>Daley&rsquo;s health failed in 1902, and  friends enabled him to take a voyage to the South Sea Islands in the following  year. In 1905 it was found that he had consumption. He went to Orange on the  New South Wales table-land; he was lonely there, got no better, and returned to  Sydney in the Spring. For months he saw the end coming; his buoyant spirit rode  like a cork on a sea of troubles, and he jested in the face of death. He died  at Waitara, near Sydney, on the 29th December, 1905, and was buried at  Waverley, not far from the dust of those other Celtic spirits which have  enriched Australia&mdash;Kendall, Dailey and Deniehy. </p>
<p>Light-hearted, brave, generous,  but weak of will&mdash;the man was finer than his work, and his work is good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Romance"></a>Romance</b></h2>
<p>They say that fair Romance is dead, and in her cold grave  lying low,<br>
  The green grass waving o&rsquo;er her head, the mould upon her breasts of snow;<br>
  Her voice, they say, is dumb for aye, that once was clarion-clear and high&mdash; <br>
  But in their hearts, their frozen hearts, they know that bitterly they lie.</p>
<p>Her brow of white, that was with bright rose-garland in  the old days crowned, <br>
  Is now, they say, all shorn of light, and with a fatal fillet bound.<br>
  Her eyes divine no more shall shine to lead the hardy knight and good <br>
  Unto the Castle Perilous, beyond the dark Enchanted Wood.</p>
<p>And do they deem, these fools supreme, whose iron wheels  unceasing whirr,<br>
  That, in this rushing Age of Steam, there is no longer room for HER?&mdash;<br>
  That, as they hold the Key of Gold that shuts or opens Mammon&rsquo;s Den,<br>
  Romance has vanished from the earth and left the homes and hearts of men?</p>
<p>Yea, some there be who fain would see this consummation  sad and drear,<br>
  And set their god Machinery with iron rod to rule the year.<br>
  They go their way, day after day, with forward-staring, famished eyes,<br>
  Whose level glances never stray&mdash;fixed fast upon a sordid prize!</p>
<p>The sun may rise in god-like guise, the stars like burning  seraphs shine,<br>
  But, ah, for those sad souls unwise, nor Earth nor Heaven bears a sign.<br>
  All visions fair, in earth and air, they gaze upon with sullen scorn.<br>
  God knows His own great business best; He only knows why they were born.</p>
<p>They never saw, with sacred awe, the Vision of the Starry  Stream<br>
  That is the source of Love and Law; they never dreamt the Wondrous Dream;<br>
  They never heard the Magic Bird, whose strains the poet&rsquo;s soul entrance;<br>
  Their souls are in their money-bags&mdash;what should they know of fair Romance?</p>
<p>She still is here, the fair and dear, and walks the Earth  with noiseless feet;<br>
  Her eyes are deep, and dark, and clear, her scarlet mouth is honey-sweet;<br>
  A chaplet fair of roses rare and lordly laurel crowns her head;<br>
  Her path is over land and sea. She is not dead; she is not dead.</p>
<p>On roads of clay, &rsquo;neath skies of grey, though Fate compel  us to advance,<br>
  Beyond the turning of the way there sits and waits for us Romance.<br>
  Around yon cape, of lion-shape, that meets the wave with lion-brow,<br>
  A ship sails in from lands unknown; Romance stands shining on her prow.</p>
<p>At dead of night, a fiery light, from out the heart of  darkness glares;<br>
  The engine, rocking in its flight, once more into the darkness flares;<br>
  The train flies fast, the bridge is past; white faces for a moment gleam&mdash;<br>
  And at the window sits Romance and gazes down into the stream.</p>
<p>When first the child, with wonder wild, looks on the world  with shining eyes,<br>
  Romance becomes his guardian mild, and tells to him her stories wise. <br>
  And, when the light fades into night, and ended is this life&rsquo;s short span,<br>
  To other wonder-worlds she leads the spirit of the Dying Man.</p>
<p>Right grim gods be Reality, and iron-handed Circumstance.<br>
  Cast off their fetters, friend! Break free!&mdash;and seek the shrine of fair  Romance.<br>
  And, when dark days with cares would craze your brain, then she will take your  hand,<br>
  And lead you on by greenwood ways unto a green and pleasant land.</p>
<p>There you will see brave company all making gay and  gallant cheer&mdash;<br>
  Blanaid the Fair, and Deirdri rare, and Gold Gudrun and Guinevere;<br>
  And Merlin wise, with dreaming eyes, and Tristram of the Harp and Bow;<br>
  While from the Wood of Broceliande the horns of Elfland bravely blow. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Anacreon"></a>Anacreon</b></h2>
<p>We bought a volume of Anacreon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defaced, mishandled, little to admire,<br>
  And yet its rusty clasps kept guard upon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetest songs, the songs of young desire <br>
  Like that great song once sung by Solomon.<br>
  My sweetheart&rsquo;s cheeks were peonies on fire:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw by the bright message of his eyes <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Eros served us in bookseller&rsquo;s guise.<br>
  I keep the volume still, but She has gone &hellip;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, for the poetry in Paradise!<br>
  There&rsquo;s Honey still and Roses on the earth,<br>
  And lips to kiss, and jugs to drain with mirth; <br>
  And lovers walk in pairs: but She has gone&hellip;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anacreon!  Anacreon! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheWoodsofDandenong"></a>The Woods of Dandenong</b></h2>
<p>High, clear and high, the soaring skylark sings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love! Love! Love! the joy of life and woe:<br>
  Throbs, throbs his heart, as upward on thrilling wings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far, far he soars from this dim world below.<br>
  Was it a skylark&rsquo;s voice or a soul&rsquo;s triumphant song<br>

<p>Rose, lovely rose&mdash;a fairer rose was she&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, white rose, I kiss your tender leaves!<br>
  Speak, speak, speak, O Soul-white rose for me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, say to her my heart in silence grieves.<br>
  Lonely and sad it grieves amidst the careless throng .. .<br>
  Ah, green are the waving trees in the woods of Dandenong!</p>
<p>Star, crystal star, shining where angels be,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright, bright star&mdash;yet brighter were her eyes&mdash;<br>
  Ai! Ai! Ai! Star of my life was she!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shine, gently shine where low her bright head lies.<br>
  And ah, but the world is cold and the way is dark and long;<br>
  And oh, that we were once more in the woods of Dandenong.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheQuestofBrahma"></a>The Quest of Brahma</b></h2>
<p>Once upon a hushed red morning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wondrous years of old,<br>
  When the sun rose like a Rajah<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad in robes of gleaming gold,</p>
<p>And upon his land of India<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poured the largess of his heart,<br>
  By the Ganges stood a Brahmin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from all his kind, apart.</p>
<p>Darkly on that royal dawning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed the Brahmin, sore distraught,<br>
  And his body lean was shaken<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passion of his thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years with hands uplifted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they withered in the air,<br>
  I have prayed,&rsquo;&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to Brahma,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But He heedeth not my prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have prayed and I have fasted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting ever for a sign,<br>
  While the world went reeling past me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its women and its wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burning suns by day have scorched me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freezing stars with icy spears,<br>
  They have pierced my brain at midnight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the long and lonely years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would lose my soul in Brahma,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is soul, and life, and breath;<br>
  Nought to me are human shadows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitting by to empty death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done with prayer and fasting:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the years in vain go by,<br>
  I will search the world for Brahma,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will seek him till I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the Brahmin spake, then swiftly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journeyed up the Ganges stream:<br>
  All around him reeled the riot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a strange phantasmal dream.</p>
<p>Rajahs proud he saw returning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wars in regal guise,<br>
  In their turbans blood-red rubies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleaming over gleaming eyes;</p>
<p>Royal elephants that slowly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marched, with trunks in pride uncurled;<br>
  And the spearmen and the banners,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the glory of the world:</p>
<p>And, amidst the great processions,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captive kings in fetters borne;<br>
  While the cymbals clashed with triumph,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trumpets blared with scorn.</p>
<p>These he passed with eyes unheeding<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All their glorious array;<br>
  For he knew they were but shadows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grim death would sweep away.</p>
<p>Never sight of human sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never show of human pride,<br>
  Edge of sword or smile of woman,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned him from his path aside.</p>
<p>Yet he stayed by still, dim waters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whose breast the lotus blooms&mdash;<br>
  Flower of secrecy and silence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleaming, midst the temple glooms.</p>
<p>All in vain he searched the temples<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, in many a form and guise,<br>
  In the dim vast halls the idols<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stared with soulless, jewelled eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will seek,&rdquo; he cried &ldquo;for Brahma<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst the everlasting snows;<br>
  Where the holy Ganges River<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his awful forehead flows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the far-off peaks he turned him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving homes of men behind;<br>
  Driven onward by his yearning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a flame before the wind.</p>
<p>Hunger gnawed, and fear pursued him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he climbed with sobbing breath;<br>
  And above his head, unsleeping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovered dark the vulture Death.</p>
<p>Ever downward plunged the torrents<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fierce and foaming flood,<br>
  Roaring through the gloomy gorges,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a people mad for blood.</p>
<p>Rose the white moon like a spectre&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All with ghostly light aglow,<br>
  Shining on a lonely Shadow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst the Himalayan snow.</p>
<p>Rose the sun in opal glory&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the Shadow lingered there,<br>
  On a ledge above the eagles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vast blue void of air.</p>
<p>Long the Brahmin stood and gazed on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;India lying far below,<br>
  Like a Maharanee dreaming<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil dreams of war and woe.</p>
<p>And he felt his bosom thrilling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fearful pity then,<br>
  For the fierce unhappy nations,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wretched sons of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this woe of old passed by me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cry upon the wind:<br>
  Brahma is no God of Mercy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto hapless humankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, perchance, the Fate that rules us <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules Him too, through endless years, <br>
  And the Ganges flowing seaward <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the flowing of his tears.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he spake: then upward struggling <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came at last unto a plain,<br>
  Cold and silent, white and awful,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far above the hurricane.</p>
<p>And amidst it gleamed the fountain <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence the Holy River flows,<br>
  And beside the mystic fountain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloomed a red and lonely Rose.</p>
<p>Never wind its leaves did ruffle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never breeze dispersed its balm,<br>
  As it bloomed there&mdash;a still-glowing <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossom of Eternal Calm.</p>
<p>All the plain was white and silent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue and silent was the sky;<br>
  And the Brahmin, in his anguish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Rose lay down to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the end has come,&rsquo;&rdquo; he murmured, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lone I die amidst the snows,<br>
  I have sought in vain for Brahma.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am Brahma,&rdquo; breathed the Rose.</p>

  I make a poet of the dumb;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make a seraph of a frog.</p>
<p>The lover with a wrecked romance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gambler by misfortune struck,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New life, new times, new love, new luck.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLandofLaissezFaire"></a>The Land of Laissez Faire</b></h2>
<p>Far beyond the city&rsquo;s bounds,<br>
  And its tidal swells and sounds&mdash;<br>
  Voices of the Street and Mart,<br>
  Throbbings of its mighty heart&mdash;<br>
  Far from sordid noise and glare<br>
  Lies the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>There the days in joy are born,<br>
  Fairest eve brings fairest morn;<br>
  And, like the shadows o&rsquo;er the grass,<br>
  Silently the sweet hours pass:<br>
  Rose-and-poppy wreaths they wear<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>Through the deep blue summer sky<br>
  Snow-white clouds go sailing by,<br>
  Like to Ships of Dreams in quest<br>
  Of the Country of the Blest&mdash;<br>
  Ah! it lies below them there,<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>Years ago, in that bright land,<br>
  Lovers twain walked hand in hand<br>
  Under that blue summer sky&mdash;<br>
  Surely they were you and I?<br>
  Surely We were that fond pair<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire?</p>
<p>Yea! . . . Your eyes were blue, I wis,<br>
  As the sea at dawning is<br>
  In the zones of Pearl and Palm,<br>
  And you sang a pagan psalm<br>
  To a sweet old pagan air,<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>And your brow was smooth and white<br>
  As a lily&rsquo;s leaves of light;<br>
  And your mouth was red&mdash;ah me!<br>
  As a red anemone,<br>
  And a vine-wreath bound your hair,<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>All around our fair domain&mdash;<br>
  Like a grim, grey mountain-chain<br>
  That doth some green vale in-wall&mdash; <br>
  Ran a rampart magical,<br>
  Shutting out the World&rsquo;s Despair <br>
  From the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>From that sad world, all around,<br>
  Never tidings came, nor sound<br>
  Of the anguish and the strife <br>
  On the battle-field of Life:<br>
  For the winds were debonair <br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>Builded by a dreaming Celt <br>
  Was the House wherein we dwelt:<br>
  East and West and South and North <br>
  On a pageant it looked forth&mdash;<br>
  Ah, we had a mansion rare <br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire!</p>
<p>What could make our hearts forlorn <br>
  In the crimson-bannered morn?<br>
  What could come our hearts to grieve <br>
  In the purple-pennoned eve?<br>
  What at night our souls could scare <br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire?</p>
<p>Ah, there came a night at last <br>
  When an army, marching fast,<br>
  With its battle-flags all torn,<br>
  By our ramparts swept in scorn&mdash; <br>
  While the lightnings stabbed the air,<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>And the leader of the Horde <br>
  Smote our gate with ringing sword, <br>
  Crying with a scornful cry&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Here they live&mdash;who dare not die.&rdquo; <br>
  And I cowered in my chair <br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>Then against the black of night <br>
  Rose a form, with visage white,<br>
  Clad in steel, and crowned with flame, <br>
  &ldquo;Duty&rdquo; was her awful name&mdash;<br>
  What the Devil brought her there,<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire?</p>
<p>Swiftly then against the Fates <br>
  Firm and sure we barred our gates,<br>
  Lit the lamp in bow&rsquo;r and hall,<br>
  And with music bacchanal <br>
  Drowned the brazen trumpet&rsquo;s blare&mdash;<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>Night went by, and in the morn <br>
  Twin white roses without thorn <br>
  Breasts as white I placed between Saying&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;If he saw this scene God <br>
  Himself would surely spare <br>
  Our sweet Land of Laissez Faire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the sunlight&mdash;o&rsquo;er the wall&mdash; <br>
  Crashing came a horseman tall, <br>
  Riding on a steed of black, <br>
  Trampling all our world to wrack. <br>
  And he said his name was &ldquo;Care&rdquo;&mdash; <br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Sweetheart! All too well we know <br>
  That was years and years ago,<br>
  And amidst the world of men <br>
  We have fought our fight since then. <br>
  And you often ask me, &ldquo;Where <br>
  Is the Land of Laissez Faire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listen low! Beyond the tall <br>
  Ruin of the western wall,<br>
  There remains a little spot <br>
  Covered with Forget-me-not,<br>
  And a little house is there&mdash;<br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire.</p>
<p>Dearest, neither you nor I <br>
  Now can turn the earth and sky <br>
  Into gardens; into seas;<br>
  Into frames for fantasies&mdash;<br>
  Yet shall we find room to spare <br>
  In the Land of Laissez Faire. </p>

<p>Ah, no; ah, no; for, long ago,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That faded, long and long ago.</p>
<p>Upon the moonlit balcony<br>

<p>Whoso the Wine of Passion sips,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At him the gods have ever laughed:<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I could sleep as sound as they.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose eyes are like two holy wells,<br>
  In gardens where the Attic bee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes honey from the asphodels.</p>
<p>Her speech was slow and silver-clear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A river flowing full and deep,<br>
  She said that Love, divine and dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was but a dream of fevered sleep.</p>
<p>But Memory, with tender sighs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed softly in the myrtle blooms;<br>
  And Passion with her glowing eyes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stared at me from the pine-tree glooms.</p>
<p>All ballads of true lovers sung,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stories of true lovers told,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vanished days of rose-and-gold.</p>
<p>And, in the falling of the year,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead leaves beneath the poplar tree<br>
  Like old love-letters, worn and sere,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mournful stories tell to me.</p>
<p>I sat me down on many a night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When gilded lamps like moons did shine,<br>
  And cheeks were flushed and eyes were bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drown my thoughts in crimson wine.</p>
<p>In vain: there never grew the grape,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Greek or Lusitanian shore,<br>
  Whose juice can help us to escape<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of days that are no more.</p>
<p>In visions of the night I take<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your heart to my heart, lover-wise;<br>
  And, in the morning, I awake<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With empty hands and burning eyes.</p>
<p>Life yet within me pulses strong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in my veins the blood runs red,<br>
  But O, dear God! the days are long,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world to me is dead.</p>
<p>I had a dream of wringing hands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tear-wet eyes, and faces wan,<br>
  And heard a cry from all the lands&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O where have our Beloved gone?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  In the Roaring Days, that now so silent are,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the ships that sail the ocean,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a treasure as the Flower,<br>
  As the Flower of Hope that blossomed in my heart.</p>

  While they drink &ldquo;Good luck&rdquo; to luck that keeps away.</p>

  Struggling onward for a paltry little prize.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, it fills my heart with sorrow<br>

  Move round and round with moveless wings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-living and half-dead.</p>

<p>The tender Demon heard her tale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smile was fond, but bleak.<br>
  He said, &ldquo;Your revels, cold and pale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would kill me in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, pointing to the verge of space,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where gushed the lurid foam,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark of death to dawn,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veil of flesh was drawn.</p>
<p>And I, methought, beheld the sight forbidden&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in the moonlight pale&mdash;<br>
  The form of Isis, but the face was hidden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the seven-fold veil.</p>
<p>And, one by one, the veils were lifted slowly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like mist at the sunrise,<br>
  The veils that hid that face august and holy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever from man&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the world seems new;<br>
  One, as the sea that rolls around the globe is,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was grey, and green and blue.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was sown with stars,<br>
  And one was dark as Doom in legends olden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dim, forgotten wars.</p>
<p>And one was&mdash;though its light was somewhat duller&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red as a world in flame,<br>
  And one was of the strange and mystic colour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which men have no name.</p>
<p>This last veil rose, the Secret Old revealing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ancient Mystery,<br>

  To change this life of dull tranquility!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These multitudinous misspent mountain-waves,<br>

  Her breasts were whiter than the foaming seas,<br>
  Her lips were red as sea-anemones.</p>
<p>Abou Ben Adam, by Maroubra Bay,<br>

<p>They lived full many a day and saw the torn<br>
  White breakers seethe around their Land of Morn,<br>
  And unto them were many children born.</p>
<p>The red geraniums on their window-stand<br>
  Smiled always gay defiance from the land<br>
  Unto the sea that snarled along the strand.</p>
<p>Splendid nasturtiums did their banners blow,<br>
  And red-voiced roses with their lips aglow,<br>
  Against this steadfast, silent, scornful snow.</p>
<p>Abou Ben Adam, in a silent poise,<br>

<p>She heard the noise of all the gods of old,<br>
  Of all the nations dead; of all the gold<br>
  Resplendent burials in the ocean old.</p>
<p>Then spake she, fire-eyed, through her gloaming hair,<br>
  To One that for Ben Adam waited there&mdash;<br>
  Not dark as she, but all so darkly fair;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood and caught him in the splendid surge<br>
  Of shining days. He did my sea-ships urge,<br>

<p>They care not, when the living pass,<br>
  Whether they sigh or smile;<br>
  They hear above their graves the grass<br>
  That sighs&mdash;&ldquo;A little while!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A white stone marks her small green bed<br>
  With &ldquo;Anna&rdquo; and &ldquo;Adieu.&rdquo; <br>

  There&rsquo;s not a voice familiar, or a face that&rsquo;s known to me:<br>
  The Lord He knows, but I suppose that this is Arcady.</p>
<p>I sit on the verandah at the closing of the day<br>
  And compare myself to Ovid in my modest little way&mdash;<br>
  To Ovid in his exile, dreaming evermore of Rome,<br>
  And in vain beseeching Caesar to forgive and take him home.</p>
<p>He dwelt amongst barbarians, and sang his mournful song<br>
  Beside the frozen Ister and the Euxine shore along;<br>

  And still I long for Sydney and its narrow streets again.</p>
<p>The wheat is cut and garnered, and the ploughing has  begun;<br>

  And great potato-digging in the fields of Arcady.</p>
<p>The farmers use, to break the ground, a fine four-furrow  plough.<br>
  Their ancestors would smile if they could see the Irish now&mdash;<br>
  For they wrought hard with wooden shares their frugal crops to raise,<br>
  When Cecht, the Plough, they worshipped in the old Dedanaan days.</p>
<p>In spite of new machines the world is full of wonder  sweet;<br>
  There&rsquo;s still as much of magic in the springing of the wheat<br>

  The Naked Maid in darkness walked and wove a magic spell.</p>
<p>A homely-looking folk they are, these people of my kin;<br>
  Their hands are hard as horse-shoes, but their hearts come through the skin;<br>

  And if your name&rsquo;s not Hogan here it must be Hegarty.</p>
<p>And Nature, God preserve her well, is kindly Irish too;<br>
  The winds croon Irish melodies the swaying gum-trees through;<br>

  The magpie warbling in the woods with rich, clear purple note,<br>
  Pretends that he&rsquo;s a blackbird with a Cork brogue in his throat.</p>
<p>They love the land they live in, all these folk that I esteem&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gendarme with pointed moustache,<br>

  He&rsquo;s sold it to Monsieur Puget,<br>

  And cut up the devil&rsquo;s own caper,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give to the <i>caf&eacute;</i> this name,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one more last chance at the game.<br>

<p>Does it sooth the spent man dying<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the stars are shining bright<br>

<p>The moon was like that sweet drowned virgin face<br>
  &nbsp;That floated down the Tiber&rsquo;s current  slow<br>
  When Nero reigned, long centuries ago,<br>
  All dim with grief, yet glorious with grace.</p>
<p>The wind went moaning through the trees below,<br>
  And like a lost child cried, then wildly laughed;<br>
  The grateful lily in the garden quaffed<br>
  The wine of Heaven from her cup of snow.</p>
<p>Yea, far away, beyond the Mountains Blue,<br>
  On many an ample field, on many a plain,<br>
  Made glad by the rich succour of the rain,<br>
  The harvest, like the gourd of Jonah, grew.</p>
<p>But I was gazing on another sight;<br>
  I saw the gaslit silent streets that shone<br>
  Like Hell&rsquo;s sad streets by Heaven&rsquo;s tears rained upon,<br>
  When God was merciful on Calvary&rsquo;s night.</p>
<p>And, at lane-corners where the gaslight gleamed,<br>

  Sat keening o&rsquo;er the grave of Hope,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And years that could not come again.</p>
<p>What tears&mdash;of mourning ink&mdash;I shed<br>
  Because Leuconoe was dead!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she was fair&mdash;as well might be<br>
  A maiden out of moonshine made.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never saw Leuconoe<br>
  In life&mdash;but loving was my trade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fairer than the moon was she.</p>
<p>Sweet Margaret, sweet Isabel<br>
  Were living maids whom I loved well.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet vaguely to my memory<br>
  They come, though neither one is dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But married&mdash;which means dead to me.<br>
  Yet I shall lose my heart and head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I forget Leuconoe.</p>
<p>In those old days&mdash;I mean those young<br>
  Old days&mdash;I thought my harp was strung<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To saddest melodies alone;<br>
  And darkling did I muse on Death,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weep for youth I had not known&mdash;<br>
  While all around me was the breath<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of youth&rsquo;s own roses newly-blown.</p>
<p>And, looking back, so strange appears<br>
  The wake of my swift-passing years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes think that I began<br>
  With Autumn, and have come to Spring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fabled rivers backward ran.<br>
  What did I know of anything,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I was Forty&mdash;and a Man?</p>
<p>The mystic dawns, the sunset strange<br>
  That glorified sea-rim and range<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those past days&mdash;where have they fled?<br>
  The noons supreme of blue and gold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nights with starry secrets dread&mdash;<br>
  What realm doth now their glories hold?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep them in my heart and head.</p>
<p>Yea, I have gathered all my years<br>
  With all their laughter and their tears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that was of me a part<br>
  In Christendom and Pagandom&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, will my goddess backward start?<br>
  Ah, let her take one red rose from<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-rose garden of my heart!</p>
<p>She smiles: she will! My Thackeray<br>
  I love you as in olden day;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still it does to me appear<br>
  A Boy who courts is not an ass&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I prefer to wine or beer<br>
  The red lips of a laughing lass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I have come to Forty-Year.</p>

<p>When I am young and strong again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ended is this sickness sore<br>
  That chills my heart and numbs my brain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not wasted days deplore,<br>
  But set the days that are to be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a higher, nobler plane,<br>
  And make my friends feel proud of me&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am young and strong again.</p>
<p>For straightway I will break the chain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of evil habits, and be free<br>
  To live the life without a stain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved by calm Philosophy.<br>
  I cannot what is spent restore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And barren sorrow I disdain;<br>
  But I will play the fool no more<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am young and strong again.</p>
<p>The chimes at midnight all in vain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall ring; for me their charm is o&rsquo;er;<br>
  My nights shall sober be and sane,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the mad, glad nights of yore.<br>
  And I will keep good company;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only drink shall be champagne&mdash;<br>
  Which is the real eau de vie&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am young and strong again.</p>
<p>The castle that I built in Spain&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An edifice sublime to see &mdash;<br>
  Its roof, I hear, lets in the rain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rots the rich old tapestry.<br>
  It soon will be a ruin hoar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Madam Owl for chatelaine;<br>
  I shall not build on Spanish shore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am young and strong again.</p>
<p>I had a ship&mdash;La Belle Helene<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, in my thoughts, the name she bore&mdash;<br>
  I fear she met the hurricane,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lies upon the ocean-floor.<br>
  She was a gallant argosy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well filled with hopes&mdash;drowned in the main.<br>
  I shall not send my hopes to sea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am young and strong again.</p>
<p>When I am young and strong again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fresh and fair the world will be!<br>
  The birds will sing in blither strain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And roses bloom in rivalry;<br>
  And friends grow dearer than before!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not change with Charlemagne<br>
  My lot, were he still Emperor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am young and strong again.</p>
<p>When I am young and strong again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ended is this sickness sore,<br>
  What if some wrinkles I retain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the signs of trouble o&rsquo;er.<br>
  Farewell! the time has come for me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep like Ogier the Dane,<br>
  Or Merlin, in his hollow tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I am young and strong again.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the eyes undimmed by trouble,<br>
  And the lips that laugh at care,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the brown limbs fleet and free&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou quite forgotten me?</p>
<p>Maid divine, dost thou not mind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we raced the streams together,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mad, glad winter-weather,<br>
  While thy hair streamed on the wind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a flying flame of gold?&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, the vanished days of old!</p>
<p>Lady, bright, dost thou forget<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we wandered, we two only,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the side of waters lonely,<br>
  From sunrising to sunset,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I made a rhyme for thee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of magic melody?</p>
<p>When the morn&rsquo;s flag was unfurled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wert with me, rapture bringing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my heart a song was singing<br>
  Of the Beauty of the World &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the morn no longer glow?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it all so long ago?</p>
<p>On the purple hills afar<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are thy swift feet gleaming, gliding?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or art thou o&rsquo;er grey plains riding<br>
  Underneath the Morning Star?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maid divine, my fear is sore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I ne&rsquo;er shall see thee more. </p>

<p>The moon a silver vision is, the rising of the sun<br>
  Is still the golden miracle it was in years ago;<br>
  The lily is as lovely in her robes that are not spun,<br>
  The rose is still as radiant as the rose I used to know.<br>
  My eyes the beauty of the world can yet with rapture see&mdash;<br>
  But, wheresoever I may go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Old Men sit by Me.</p>
<p>The young men pass me on the boat with pleasant nod or  jest,<br>
  And talk and laugh amongst themselves of sport, or girls, or drink;<br>
  They seem to think such themes for me have lost all interest.<br>
  I&rsquo;d like to let them see that I am not the age they think;<br>
  But what&rsquo;s the use of trying to look careless, young and free,<br>
  When, talking on things dead and gone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Old Men sit by Me.</p>
<p>They somehow seem to think that I no longer should be gay,<br>
  But take life very seriously and wear a solemn face;<br>
  Because my brow is wrinkled and my hair a trifle grey,<br>
  I should (they seem to fancy) drop out gently from the race.<br>
  But there is that within me which doth proudly disagree<br>
  With such superannuation, though<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Old Men sit by Me.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true I am a little bald behind and grey before;<br>
  The lines about my eyes are somewhat deep, perhaps&mdash;what then?<br>
  Young men who are both bald and grey, I know them by the score;<br>
  And wrinkles merely do not age a sprightly citizen&mdash;<br>
  I used to think that Trouble left me them as legacy.<br>
  But still the fact remains that now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Old Men sit by Me.</p>
<p>But, spite of Time, the Thief of Youth, till health and  hope be gone,<br>
  I shall see the beauty of the world as in the years of yore.<br>
  I may grow as bald as Caesar and as grey as Wellington,<br>
  Yet while my heart is light and young I care for nothing more;<br>
  And, therefore, in the train, or on the boat upon the sea,<br>
  I am not old, my masters, though<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Old Men sit by Me.</p>

<p>Four walls and a door,<br>

  Yet now I see more<br>
  Than ever before<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could see at all.</p>
<p>The wall-paper fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With it&rsquo;s queer volutes,<br>
  A devil-may-care<br>
  Bohemian air<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plays with harps and flutes.</p>
<p>The flutes to the white<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ceiling play;<br>
  And merry and bright<br>
  As quivering light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes the march so gay.</p>
<p>O, Harps of the green<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your strings of gold<br>
  And music so keen,<br>
  I know what ye mean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the tale is old&mdash;</p>
<p>Four walls but no door<br>

<p>The pallid Morn with face aghast <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked on the meadows drear;<br>
  Her face was in the river glassed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold, white face of fear.</p>
<p>The trees were still; there was no stir<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grass blades on the lawn,<br>
  And the candles near the dying man <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned yellow in the dawn.</p>
<p>The ghost set forth upon its way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard no farewell sound<br>
  But the crowing of a distant cock <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the baying of a hound. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  check thy flight<br>
  Will break beneath the sun, or silent stars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some  day or night.</p>
<p>Be still and wait; the Body seems to reign <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  pride serene;<br>
  But darkly in its pathway crouches Pain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  poniard keen.</p>
<p>Grieve not when it is grieved, nor, when it errs&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis  naught to thee;<br>
  Its sins and sorrows are but ministers <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  set thee free.</p>
<p>Behold, it is the bondslave to the Earth <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From  which it springs;<br>
  Its laugh is loudest in the Masque of Mirth&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  loves all things</p>
<p>That make the world seem beautiful and gay, <br>

  The joy of Spring-time and the dawn of day, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wine,  Women, Song.</p>
<p>Red-tongued it rushes, like a hound unchained, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  hunt Desire;<br>
  But thou remainest still a proud, unstained <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit  of fire.</p>
<p>It has no part in thee; thou hast no mate <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  share thy throne.<br>
  Thou art invincible, inviolate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White  and alone.</p>
<p>Dost thou not feel in rapt imaginings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  dreams sublime,<br>
  The sovran sweep of thy immortal wings <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through  Space and Time?</p>
<p>The stars and suns whose magnitude appal <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall  seem to thee<br>
  Like twinkling lights of some small port of call, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen  far at sea.</p>
<p>Be still and wait, O caged Immortal Bird!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou  shalt be free;<br>
  Not all in vain hast thou the voices heard <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  lives to be.</p>
<p>Be still and wait! No Being that draws breath<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy  bounds can set;<br>

<p>The scarlet music in his veins <br>
  Ran glowing like seraphic strains.</p>
<p>The dawn appeared for him alone.<br>
  The day, the world, were all his own.</p>
<p>For him the sun kissed lovingly <br>
  The silken-robed Sultana Sea.</p>
<p>The hours to him were golden sands:<br>
  He scattered them with both his hands.</p>
<p>The thrill of ecstasy that runs<br>
  Through song of lark, through light of suns,</p>
<p>Through grasp of hand in comradeship,<br>
  Through kiss of woman&mdash;heart on lip&mdash;</p>
<p>He knew and loved it passing well.<br>
  Then on his soul a shadow fell&mdash;</p>
<p>The Shadow of a Shape of Fear,<br>
  That made the golden daylight drear.</p>
<p>Its hollow eyes were dim and dull;<br>
  A fool&rsquo;s cap crowned its grinning skull.</p>
<p>It stood a moment by his side,<br>
  He looked, and laughed&mdash;and laughing, died.</p>
