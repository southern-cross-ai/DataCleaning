    <b><a name="TheMuseOfAustralia"></a>The Muse Of Australia</b></h2>
<p>Where the pines with the eagles are nestled in rifts,<br>
  And the torrent leaps down to the surges,<br>
  I have followed her, clambering over the clifts,<br>
  By the chasms and moon-haunted verges.<br>
  I know she is fair as the angels are fair,<br>
  For have I not caught a faint glimpse of her there;<br>
  A glimpse of her face and her glittering hair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a hand with the Harp of Australia?</p>
<p>I never can reach you, to hear the sweet voice<br>
  So full with the music of fountains!<br>
  Oh! when will you meet with that soul of your choice,<br>
  Who will lead you down here from the mountains?<br>
  A lyre-bird lit on a shimmering space;<br>
  It dazzled mine eyes and I turned from the place,<br>
  And wept in the dark for a glorious face,<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a  hand with the </i>Harp<i> of Australia!</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Mountains"></a>Mountains</b></h2>
<p>Rifted mountains, clad with forests, girded round by  gleaming pines,<br>
  Where the morning, like an angel, robed in golden splendour shines;<br>
  Shimmering mountains, throwing downward on the slopes a mazy glare<br>
  Where the noonday glory sails through gulfs of calm and glittering air;<br>
  Stately mountains, high and hoary, piled with blocks of amber cloud,<br>
  Where the fading twilight lingers, when the winds are wailing loud;<br>
  Grand old mountains, overbeetling brawling brooks and deep ravines,<br>
  Where the moonshine, pale and mournful, flows on rocks and evergreens.</p>
<p>Underneath these regal ridges &mdash; underneath the gnarly  trees,<br>
  I am sitting, lonely-hearted, listening to a lonely breeze!<br>
  Sitting by an ancient casement, casting many a longing look<br>
  Out across the hazy gloaming &mdash; out beyond the brawling brook!<br>
  Over pathways leading skyward &mdash; over crag and swelling cone,<br>
  Past long hillocks looking like to waves of ocean turned to stone;<br>
  Yearning for a bliss unworldly, yearning for a brighter change,<br>
  Yearning for the mystic Aidenn, built beyond this mountain range.</p>
<p>Happy years, amongst these valleys, happy years have come  and gone,<br>
  And my youthful hopes and friendships withered with them one by one;<br>
  Days and moments bearing onward many a bright and beauteous dream,<br>
  All have passed me like to sunstreaks flying down a distant stream.<br>
  Oh, the love returned by loved ones! Oh, the faces that I knew!<br>
  Oh, the wrecks of fond affection! Oh, the hearts so warm and true!<br>
  But their voices I remember, and a something lingers still,<br>
  Like a dying echo roaming sadly round a far off hill.</p>
<p>I would sojourn here contented, tranquil as I was of yore,<br>
  And would never wish to clamber, seeking for an unknown shore;<br>
  I have dwelt within this cottage twenty summers, and mine eyes<br>
  Never wandered erewhile round in search of undiscovered skies;<br>
  But a spirit sits beside me, veiled in robes of dazzling white,<br>
  And a dear one's whisper wakens with the symphonies of night;<br>
  And a low sad music cometh, borne along on windy wings,<br>
  Like a strain familiar rising from a maze of slumbering springs.</p>
<p>And the Spirit, by my window, speaketh to my restless  soul,<br>
  Telling of the clime she came from, where the silent moments roll;<br>
  Telling of the bourne mysterious, where the sunny summers flee<br>
  Cliffs and coasts, by man untrodden, ridging round a shipless sea.<br>
  There the years of yore are blooming &mdash; there departed life-dreams dwell,<br>
  There the faces beam with gladness that I loved in youth so well;<br>
  There the songs of childhood travel, over wave-worn steep and strand &mdash;<br>
  Over dale and upland stretching out behind this mountain land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely Being, can a mortal, weary of this changeless  scene,<br>
  Cross these cloudy summits to the land where man hath never been?<br>
  Can he find a pathway leading through that wildering mass of pines,<br>
  So that he shall reach the country where ethereal glory shines;<br>
  So that he may glance at waters never dark with coming ships;<br>
  Hearing round him gentle language floating from angelic lips;<br>
  Casting off his earthly fetters, living there for evermore;<br>
  All the blooms of Beauty near him, gleaming on that quiet shore?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ere you quit this ancient casement, tell me, is it well  to yearn<br>
  For the evanescent visions, vanished never to return?<br>
  Is it well that I should wish to leave this dreary world behind,<br>
  Seeking for your fair Utopia, which perchance I may not find?<br>
  Passing through a gloomy forest, scaling steeps like prison walls,<br>
  Where the scanty sunshine wavers and the moonlight seldom falls?<br>
  Oh, the feelings re-awakened! Oh, the hopes of loftier range!<br>
  Is it well, thou friendly Being, well to wish for such a change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Spirit answers nothing! and the dazzling mantle  fades;<br>
  And a wailing whisper wanders out from dismal seaside shades!<br>
  &ldquo;Lo, the trees are moaning loudly, underneath their hood-like shrouds,<br>
  And the arch above us darkens, scarred with ragged thunder clouds!&rdquo;<br>
  But the spirit answers nothing, and I linger all alone,<br>
  Gazing through the moony vapours where the lovely Dream has flown;<br>
  And my heart is beating sadly, and the music waxeth faint,<br>
  Sailing up to holy Heaven, like the anthems of a Saint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Kiama"></a>Kiama</b></h2>
<p>Towards the hills of Jamberoo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some few fantastic shadows haste,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplit with fires<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like castle spires<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outshining through a mirage waste.<br>
  Behold, a mournful glory sits<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On feathered ferns and woven brakes,<br>
  Where sobbing wild like restless child<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gusty breeze of evening wakes!<br>
  Methinks I hear on every breath<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lofty tone go passing by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That whispers &mdash; &ldquo;Weave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though wood winds grieve,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fadeless blooms of Poesy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spirit hand has been abroad &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evil hand to pluck the flowers &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world of wealth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blooming health<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has gone from fragrant seaside bowers.<br>
  The twilight waxeth dim and dark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad waves mutter sounds of woe,<br>
  But the evergreen retains its sheen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And happy hearts exist below;<br>
  But pleasure sparkles on the sward,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And voices utter words of bliss,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while my bride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits by my side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, where&rsquo;s the scene surpassing this?</p>
<p>Kiama slumbers, robed with mist,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All glittering in the dewy light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, brooding o&rsquo;er<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shingly shore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies resting in the arms of Night;<br>
  And foam-flecked crags with surges chill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rocks embraced of cold-lipped spray,<br>
  Are moaning loud where billows crowd<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In angry numbers up the bay.<br>
  The holy stars come looking down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On windy heights and swarthy strand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Life and Love &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cliffs above &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sitting fondly hand in hand.</p>
<p>I hear a music inwardly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That floods my soul with thoughts of joy;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within my heart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions start<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Time may still but ne&rsquo;er destroy.<br>
  An ancient Spring revives itself,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And days which made the past divine;<br>
  And rich warm gleams from golden dreams,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All glorious in their summer shine;<br>
  And songs of half forgotten hours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a sweet melodious strain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which still shall rise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the skies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all things else have died again.</p>
<p>A white sail glimmers out at sea &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vessel walking in her sleep;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Power goes past<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bends the mast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While frighted waves to leeward leap.<br>
  The moonshine veils the naked sand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ripples upward with the tide,<br>
  As underground there rolls a sound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From where the caverned waters glide.<br>
  A face that bears affection&rsquo;s glow,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that speaks from gentle  eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy which slips<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From loving lips<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have made this spot my Paradise!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Etheline"></a>Etheline</b></h2>
<p>The heart that once was rich with light,<br>
  And happy in your grace,<br>
  Now lieth cold beneath the scorn<br>
  That gathers on your face;<br>
  And every joy it knew before,<br>
  And every templed dream,<br>
  Is paler than the dying flash<br>
  On yonder mountain stream.<br>
  The soul, regretting foundered bliss<br>
  Amid the wreck of years,<br>
  Hath mourned it with intensity<br>
  Too deep for human tears!</p>
<p>The forest fadeth underneath<br>
  The blast that rushes by &mdash;<br>
  The dripping leaves are white with death,<br>
  But Love will never die!<br>
  We both have seen the starry moss<br>
  That clings where Ruin reigns,<br>
  And <i>one</i> must know <i>his </i>lonely breast<br>
  Affection still retains;<br>
  Through all the sweetest hopes of life,<br>
  That clustered round and round,<br>
  Are lying now, like withered things,<br>
  Forsaken &mdash; on the ground.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis hard to think of what we were,<br>
  And what we might have been,<br>
  Had not an evil spirit crept<br>
  Across the tranquil scene:<br>
  Had fervent feelings in your soul<br>
  Not failed nor ceased to shine<br>
  As pure as those existing on,<br>
  And burning still in mine.<br>
  Had every treasure at your feet<br>
  That I was wont to pour,<br>
  Been never thrown like worthless weeds<br>
  Upon a barren shore!</p>
<p>The bitter edge of grief has passed,<br>
  I would not now upbraid;<br>
  Or count to you the broken vows,<br>
  So often idly made!<br>
  I would not cross your path to chase<br>
  The falsehood from your brow &mdash;<br>
  I <i>know</i>, with all that borrowed light,<br>
  You are not happy now:<br>
  Since those that once have trampled down<br>
  Affection&rsquo;s early claim,<br>
  Have lost a peace they need not hope<br>
  To find on earth again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Aileen"></a>Aileen</b></h2>
<p>A splendid sun betwixt the trees<br>
  Long spikes of flame did shoot,<br>
  When turning to the fragrant South,<br>
  With longing eyes and burning mouth,<br>
  I stretched a hand athwart the drouth,<br>
  And plucked at cooling fruit.</p>
<p>So thirst was quenched, and hastening on<br>
  With strength returned to me,<br>
  I set my face against the noon,<br>
  And reached a denser forest soon;<br>
  Which dipped into a still lagoon<br>
  Hard by the sooming sea.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>All day the ocean beat on bar<br>
  And bank of gleaming sand;<br>
  Yet that lone pool was always mild,<br>
  It never moved when waves were wild,<br>
  But slumbered, like a quiet child,<br>
  Upon the lap of land.</p>
<p>And when I rested on the brink,<br>
  Amongst the fallen flowers,<br>
  I lay in calm; no leaves were stirred<br>
  By breath of wind, or wing of bird;<br>
  It was so still, you might have heard<br>
  The footfalls of the hours.</p>
<p>Faint slumbrous scents of roses filled<br>
  The air which covered me:<br>
  My words were low &mdash; &ldquo;she loved them so,<br>
  In Eden vales such odours blow:<br>
  How strange it is that roses grow<br>
  So near the shores of Sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sweeter fragrance never came<br>
  Across the Fields of Yore!<br>
  And when I said &mdash; &ldquo;we here would dwell,&rdquo; &mdash;<br>
  A low voice on the silence fell &mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Ah! if you loved the roses well,<br>
  You loved Aileen the more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that I did, and now would turn,<br>
  And fall and worship her!<br>
  But Oh, you dwell so far &mdash; so high!<br>
  One cannot reach, though he may try,</p>
<p>The Morning land, and Jasper sky &mdash;<br>
  The balmy hills of Myrrh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why vex me with delicious hints<br>
  Of fairest face, and rarest blooms;<br>
  You Spirit of a darling Dream<br>
  Which links itself with every theme<br>
  And thought of mine by surf or stream,<br>
  In glens &mdash; or caverned glooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;thy wishes led me down,<br>
  From amaranthine bowers:<br>
  And since my face was haunting thee<br>
  With roses (dear which used to be),<br>
  They all have hither followed me,<br>
  The scents and shapes of flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then stay, mine own evangel, stay!<br>
  Or, going, take me too;<br>
  But let me sojourn by your side,<br>
  If here we dwell or there abide,<br>
  It matters not!&rdquo; I madly cried &mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;I only care for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, glittering Form that would not stay! &mdash;<br>
  Oh, sudden, sighing breeze!<br>
  A fainting rainbow dropped below<br>
  Far gleaming peaks and walls of snow<br>
  And there, a weary way, I go,<br>
  Towards the Sunrise seas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Kooroora"></a>Kooroora</b></h2>
<p>The gums in the gully stand gloomy and stark,<br>
  A torrent beneath them is leaping,<br>
  And the wind goes about like a ghost in the dark<br>
  Where a chief of Wahibbi lies sleeping!<br>
  He dreams of a battle &mdash; of foes of the past,<br>
  But he hears not the whooping abroad on the blast,<br>
  Nor the fall of the feet that are travelling fast.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, why dost thou slumber, Kooroora?</p>
<p>They come o&rsquo;er the hills in their terrible ire,<br>
  And speed by the woodlands and water;<br>
  They look down the hills at the flickering fire,<br>
  All eager and thirsty for slaughter.<br>
  Lo! the stormy moon glares like a torch from the vale,<br>
  And a voice in the belah grows wild in its wail,<br>
  As the cries of the Wanneroos swell with the gale &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! rouse thee and meet them, Kooroora!</p>
<p>He starts from his sleep and he clutches his spear,<br>
  And the echoes roll backward in wonder,<br>
  For a shouting strikes into the hollow woods near,<br>
  Like the sound of a gathering thunder.<br>
  He clambers the ridge, with his face to the light,<br>
  The foes of Wahibbi come full in his sight &mdash;<br>
  The waters of Mooki will redden to-night.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go! and glory awaits thee, Kooroora!</p>
<p>Lo! yeelamans splinter and boomerangs clash,<br>
  And a spear through the darkness is driven &mdash;<br>
  It whizzes along like a wandering flash<br>
  From the heart of a hurricane riven.<br>
  They turn to the mountains, that gloomy-browed band;<br>
  The rain droppeth down with a moan to the land,<br>
  And the face of a chieftain lies buried in sand &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the light that was quenched with Kooroora!</p>
<p>To-morrow the Wanneroo dogs will rejoice,<br>
  And feast in this desolate valley;<br>
  But where are his brothers &mdash; the friends of his choice,<br>
  And why art thou absent, Ewalli?<br>
  Now silence draws back to the forest again,<br>
  And the wind, like a wayfarer, sleeps on the plain,<br>
  But the cheeks of a warrior bleach in the rain.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! where are thy mourners, Kooroora?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="FaintingByTheWay"></a>Fainting By The Way</b></h2>
<p>Swarthy wastelands, wide and woodless, glittering miles  and miles away,<br>
  Where the south wind seldom wanders and the winters will not stay;<br>
  Lurid wastelands, pent in silence, thick with hot and thirsty sighs,<br>
  Where the scanty thorn-leaves twinkle with their haggard, hopeless eyes;<br>
  Furnaced wastelands, hunched with hillocks, like to stony billows rolled,<br>
  Where the naked flats lie swirling, like a sea of darkened gold;<br>
  Burning wastelands, glancing upward with a weird and vacant stare,<br>
  Where the languid heavens quiver o&rsquo;er red depths of stirless air!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my brother, I am weary of this wildering waste of  sand;<br>
  In the noontide we can never travel to the promised land!<br>
  Lo! the desert broadens round us, glaring wildly in my face,<br>
  With long leagues of sunflame on it, &mdash; oh! the barren, barren place!<br>
  See, behind us gleams a green plot, shall we thither turn and rest<br>
  Till a cold wind flutters over, till the day is down the west?<br>
  I would follow, but I cannot! Brother, let me here remain,<br>
  For the heart is dead within me, and I may not rise again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore stay to talk of fainting? &mdash; rouse thee for  awhile, my friend;<br>
  Evening hurries on our footsteps, and this journey soon will end.<br>
  Wherefore stay to talk of fainting, when the sun, with sinking fire,<br>
  Smites the blocks of broken thunder, blackening yonder craggy spire?<br>
  Even now the far-off landscape broods and fills with coming change,<br>
  And a withered moon grows brighter bending o&rsquo;er that shadowed range;<br>
  At the feet of grassy summits sleeps a water calm and clear &mdash;<br>
  There is surely rest beyond it! Comrade, wherefore tarry here?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet a little longer struggle; we have walked a wilder  plain,<br>
  And have met more troubles, trust me, than we e&rsquo;er shall meet again!<br>
  Can you think of all the dangers you and I are living through<br>
  With a soul so weak and fearful, with the doubts I never knew?<br>
  Dost thou not remember that the thorns are clustered with the rose,<br>
  And that every Zin-like border may a pleasant land enclose?<br>
  Oh, across these sultry deserts many a fruitful scene we&rsquo;ll find,<br>
  And the blooms we gather shall be worth the wounds they leave behind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my brother, it is useless! See, o&rsquo;erburdened with  their load,<br>
  All the friends who went before us fall or falter by the road!<br>
  We have come a weary distance, seeking what we may not get,<br>
  And I think we are but children, chasing rainbows through the wet.<br>
  Tell me not of vernal valleys! Is it well to hold a reed<br>
  Out for drowning men to clutch at in the moments of their need?<br>
  Go thy journey on without me; it is better I should stay,<br>
  Since my life is like an evening, fading, swooning fast away!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are all the springs you talked of? Have I not with  pleading mouth<br>
  Looked to Heaven through a silence stifled in the crimson drouth?<br>
  Have I not, with lips unsated, watched to see the fountains burst,<br>
  Where I searched the rocks for cisterns? And they only mocked my thirst!<br>
  Oh, I dreamt of countries fertile, bright with lakes and flashing rills<br>
  Leaping from their shady caverns, streaming round a thousand hills!<br>
  Leave me, brother, all is fruitless, barren, measureless, and dry,<br>
  And my God will never help me though I pray, and faint, and die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up! I tell thee this is idle! Oh, thou man of little  faith!<br>
  Doubting on the verge of Aidenn, turning now to covet death!<br>
  By the fervent hopes within me, by the strength which nerves my soul,<br>
  By the heart that yearns to help thee, we shall live and reach the goal!<br>
  Rise and lean thy weight upon me. Life is fair, and God is just,<br>
  And He yet will show us fountains, if we only look and trust!<br>
  Oh, I know it, and He leads us to the glens of stream and shade,<br>
  Where the low, sweet waters gurgle round the banks which cannot fade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he spake, my friend and brother! and he took me by  the hand,<br>
  And I think we walked the desert till the night was on the land;<br>
  Then we came to flowery hollows, where we heard a far-off stream<br>
  Singing in the moony twilight, like the rivers of my dream.<br>
  And the balmy winds came tripping softly through the pleasant trees,<br>
  And I thought they bore a murmur like a voice from sleeping seas.<br>
  So we travelled, so we reached it, and I never more will part<br>
  With the peace, as calm as sunset, folded round my weary heart.</p>

<p>The crag-pent breezes sob and moan where hidden waters  glide;<br>
  And twilight wanders round the earth with slow and shadowy stride.<br>
  The gleaming clouds, above the brows of western steeps uphurled,<br>
  Look like the spires of some fair town that bounds a brighter world.<br>
  Lo, from the depths of yonder wood, where many a blind creek strays,<br>
  The pure Australian moon comes forth, enwreathed with silver haze.<br>
  The rainy mists are trooping down the folding hills behind,<br>
  And distant torrent-voices rise like bells upon the wind.<br>
  The echeu&rsquo;s* songs are dying, with the flute-bird&rsquo;s mellow tone,<br>
  And night recalls the gloomy owl to rove the wilds alone;<br>
  Night, holy night, in robes of blue, with golden stars encrowned,<br>
  Ascending mountains like to walls that hem an Eden round.</p>
<p class="note">* The rufous-breasted thickhead.</p>
<p>Oh, lovely moon! oh, holy night! how good your God must  be,<br>
  When, through the glories of your light, He stoops to look at me!<br>
  Oh, glittering clouds and silvery shapes, that vanish one by one!<br>
  Is not the kindness of our Lord too great to think upon?<br>
  If human song could flow as free as His created breeze,<br>
  When, sloping from some hoary height, it sweeps the vacant seas,<br>
  Then should my voice to heaven ascend, my tuneful lyre be strung,<br>
  And music sweeter than the winds should roam these glens among.<br>
  Go by, ye golden-footed hours, to your mysterious bourne,<br>
  And hide the sins ye bear from hence, so that they ne&rsquo;er return.<br>
  Teach me, ye beauteous stars, to kiss kind Mercy&rsquo;s chastening rod,<br>
  And, looking up from Nature&rsquo;s face, to worship Nature&rsquo;s God.</p>

  And grapple the dark and only the dark<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my search for a loving hand.</p>
<p>For it&rsquo;s here a still, deep woodland lies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With spurs of pine and sheaves of fern;<br>

<p>Where the lone creek, chafing nightly in the cold and sad  moonshine,<br>
  Beats beneath the twisted fern-roots and the drenched and dripping vine;<br>
  Where the gum trees, ringed and ragged, from the mazy margins rise,<br>
  Staring out against the heavens with their languid gaping eyes;<br>
  There I listened &mdash; there I heard it! Oh, that melancholy sound,<br>
  Wandering like a ghostly whisper, through the dreaming darkness round!<br>
  Wandering, like a fearful warning, where the withered twilight broke<br>
  Through a mass of mournful tresses, drooping down the Native Oak.</p>
<p>And I caught a glimpse of sunset fading from a far-off  wild,<br>
  As I sat me down to fancy, like a thoughtful, wistful child &mdash;<br>
  Sat me down to fancy what might mean those hollow, hopeless tones,<br>
  Sooming round the swooning silence, dying out in smothered moans!<br>
  What might mean that muffled sobbing? Did a lonely phantom wail,<br>
  Pent amongst those tangled branches barring out the moonlight pale?<br>
  Wept it for that gleam of glory wasting from the forest aisles;<br>
  For that fainting gleam of glory sad with flickering, sickly smiles?</p>
<p>In these woodlands I was restless! I had seen a light  depart,<br>
  And an ache for something vanished filled and chilled my longing heart,<br>
  And I linked my thoughts together &mdash; &ldquo;All seemed still and dull to-day,<br>
  But a painful symbol groweth from the shine that pales away!<br>
  This may not be idle dreaming; if the spirit roams,&rdquo; I said,<br>
  &ldquo;This is surely one, a wanderer from the ages which have fled!<br>
  Who can look beyond the darkness; who can see so he may tell<br>
  Where the sunsets all have gone to; where the souls that leave us dwell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This might be a loving exile, full with faded thoughts  returned,<br>
  Seeking for familiar faces, friends for whom he long had yearned.<br>
  Here his fathers must have sojourned &mdash; here his people may have died,<br>
  Or, perchance, to distant forests all were scattered far and wide.<br>
  So he moans and so he lingers! weeping o&rsquo;er the wasted wild;<br>
  Weeping o&rsquo;er the desolation, like a lost, benighted child!<br>
  So he moans, and so he lingers! Hence these fitful, fretful sighs,<br>
  Deep within the oak tree solemn! Hence these weary, weary cries!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or who knows but that some secret lies beneath yon dismal  mound?<br>
  Ha! a dreary, dreadful secret must be buried underground!<br>
  Not a ragged blade of verdure &mdash; not one root of moss is there;<br>
  Who hath torn the grasses from it &mdash; wherefore is that barrow bare?<br>
  Darkness shuts the forest round me. Here I stand and, O my God!<br>
  This may be some injured spirit raving round and round the sod.<br>
  Hush! the tempest, how it travels! Blood hath here been surely shed &mdash;<br>
  Hush! the thunder, how it mutters! Oh, the unrequited Dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Came a footfall past the water &mdash; came a wild man through  the gloom,<br>
  Down he stooped and faced the current, silent as the silent tomb;<br>
  Down he stooped and lapped the ripples: not a single word he spoke,<br>
  But I whispered, &ldquo;He can tell me of the Secret in the Oak?<br>
  Very thoughtful seems that forehead; many legends he may know;<br>
  Many tales and old traditions linked to what is here below!<br>
  I must ask him &mdash; rest I cannot &mdash; though my life upon it hung &mdash;<br>
  Though these wails are waxing louder, I must give my thoughts a tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake that silence from you, wild man! I have looked into  your face,<br>
  Hoping I should learn the story there about this fearful place.<br>
  Slake your thirst, but stay and tell me: did your heart with terror beat,<br>
  When you stepped across the bare and blasted hillock at your feet?<br>
  Hearken to these croons so wretched deep within the dusk boughs pent!<br>
  Hold you not some strange tradition coupled with this strange lament?<br>
  When your tribe about their camp-fires hear that hollow, broken cry,<br>
  <i>Do they hint of deeds mysterious, hidden  in the days gone by?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>But he rose like one bewildered, shook his head and glided  past;<br>
  Huddling whispers hurried after, hissing in the howling blast!<br>
  Now a sheet of lurid splendour swept athwart the mountain spire,<br>
  And a midnight squall came trumping down on zigzag paths of fire!<br>
  Through the tumult dashed a torrent flanking out in foaming streams,<br>
  Whilst the woodlands groaned and muttered like a monster vexed with dreams.<br>
  Then I swooned away in horror. Oh! that shriek which rent the air,<br>
  Like the voice of some fell demon harrowed by a mad despair.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sources of rivers that all of us know;<br>

  And running up gorges, we&rsquo;ll come to the verges<br>

  Yet who would be quailing, or fainting, or failing?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not you, who are men of the Narran, I ween!<br>
  When we leave the dry channels away to the south,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reach the far plains we are journeying to,<br>

<p>Wild-eyed woodlands, here I rest me, underneath the gaunt  and ghastly trees;<br>
  Underneath fantastic-fronted caverns crammed with many a muffled breeze.<br>
  Far away from dusky towns and cities twinkling with the feet of men;<br>
  Listening to a sound of mellow music fleeting down the gusty glen;<br>
  Sitting by a rapid torrent, with the broken sunset in my face;<br>
  By a rapid, roaring torrent, tumbling through a dark and lonely place!<br>
  And I hear the bells beyond the forest, and the voice of distant streams;<br>
  And a flood of swelling singing, wafting round a world of ruined dreams.</p>
<p>Like to one who watches daylight dying from a lofty  mountain spire,<br>
  When the autumn splendour scatters like a gust of faintly-gleaming fire;<br>
  So the silent spirit looketh through a mist of faded smiles and tears,<br>
  While across it stealeth all the sad and sweet divinity of years &mdash;<br>
  All the scenes of shine and shadow; light and darkness sleeping side by side<br>
  When my heart was wedded to existence, as a bridegroom to his bride:<br>
  While I travelled gaily onward with the vapours crowding in my wake,<br>
  Deeming that the Present hid the glory where the promised Morn would break.</p>
<p>Like to one who, by the waters standing, marks the reeling  ocean wave<br>
  Moaning, hide his head all torn and shivered underneath his lonely cave,<br>
  So the soul within me glances at the tides of Purpose where they creep,<br>
  Dashed to fragments by the yawning ridges circling Life&rsquo;s tempestuous Deep!<br>
  Oh! the tattered leaves are dropping, dropping round me like a fall of rain;<br>
  While the dust of many a broken aspiration sweeps my troubled brain;<br>
  With the yearnings after Beauty, and the longings to be good and great;<br>
  And the thoughts of catching Fortune, flying on the tardy wings of Fate.</p>
<p>Bells, beyond the forest chiming, where is all the  inspiration now<br>
  That was wont to flush my forehead, and to chase the pallor from my brow?<br>
  Did I not, amongst these thickets, weave my thoughts and passions into rhyme,<br>
  Trusting that the words were golden, hoping for the praise of after-time?<br>
  Where have all those fancies fled to? Can the fond delusion linger still,<br>
  When the Evening withers o&rsquo;er me, and the night is creeping up the hill?<br>
  If the years of strength have left me, and my life begins to fail and fade,<br>
  Who will learn my simple ballads; who will stay to sing the songs I&rsquo;ve made?</p>
<p>Bells, beyond the forest ringing, lo, I hasten to the  world again;<br>
  For the sun has smote the empty windows, and the day is on the wane!<br>
  Hear I not a dreamy echo, soughing through the rafters of the tree;<br>
  Like a sound of stormy rivers, or the ravings of a restless sea?<br>
  Should I loiter here to listen, while this fitful wind is on the wing?<br>
  No, the heart of Time is sobbing, and my spirit is a withered thing!<br>
  Let the rapid torrents tumble, let the woodlands whistle in the blast;<br>
  Mighty minstrels sing behind me, but the promise of my youth is past.</p>

  And our thoughts were all in mourning for the dear, dead Long Ago!<br>
  In a night like this we parted. Hearts were sad though they were young,<br>

<p>Said my darling, looking at me, through the radiance of  her tears:<br>
  &ldquo;Many changes, O my loved One, we will meet in after years;<br>

  Changes like to swift-winged shadows falling on a moony deep!<br>

  &ldquo;Oh, the Purpose scattered from me, like the withered autumn leaves!<br>
  Oh, the wreck of Love&rsquo;s ambition! Oh, the fond and full belief<br>
  That I yet should hear them hail you in your land a God-made chief!<br>
  In the loud day they may slumber, but my thoughts will not be still<br>
  When the weary world is sleeping, and the moon is on the hill;<br>
  Then your form will bend above me, then your voice will rise and fall,<br>
  Though I turn and hide in darkness, with my face against the wall,<br>
  And my Soul must rise and listen while those homeless memories throng<br>
  Moaning in the night for shelter,&rdquo; said the Maid of Gerringong.</p>
<p>Ay, she passed away and left me! Rising through the dusk  of tears,<br>
  Came a vision of that parting every day for many years!<br>
  Every day, though she had told me not to court the strange sweet pain,<br>
  Something whispered &mdash; something led me to our olden haunts again:<br>
  And I used to wander nightly, by the surges and the ships,<br>
  Harping on those last fond accents that had trembled from her lips:<br>
  Till a vessel crossed the waters, and I heard a stranger say,<br>
  &ldquo;One you loved has died in silence with her dear face turned away.&rdquo;<br>
  Oh! the eyes that flash upon me, and the voice that comes along &mdash;<br>

  Hide for shame from well-raised clamour, moderate fools who would be wise;<br>

  And another asketh, doubting that my brother speaks the truth,<br>
  &ldquo;Can we love in age as fondly as we did in days of youth?<br>
  Will dead faces always haunt us, in the time of faltering breath?<br>
  Shall we yearn, and we so feeble?&rdquo; Ay, for Love is Love in Death.<br>
  Oh! the Faith with sure foundation! &mdash; let the Ages roll along,<br>
  You are mine, and mine for ever, dark-haired Maid of Gerringong.</p>
<p>Last night, dear, I dreamt about you, and I thought that  far from men<br>
  We were walking, both together, in a fragrant seaside glen;<br>
  Down where we could hear the surges wailing round the castled cliffs,<br>
  Down where we could see the sunset reddening on the distant skiffs;<br>
  There a fall of mountain waters tumbled through the knotted bowers<br>
  Bright with rainbow colours reeling on the purple forest flowers.<br>
  And we rested on the benches of a cavern old and hoar;<br>
  And I whispered, &ldquo;this is surely her I loved in days of yore!<br>
  False he was who brought sad tidings! Why were you away so long,<br>
  When you knew who waited for you, dark-haired Maid of Gerringong?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the strangers come around you, in the far-off foreign  land?<br>
  Did they lead you out of sorrow, with kind face and loving hand?<br>
  Had they pleasant ways to court you &mdash; had they silver words to bind?<br>
  Had they souls more fond and loyal than the soul you left behind?<br>
  Do not think I blame you, dear one! Ah! my heart is gushing o&rsquo;er<br>
  With the sudden joy and wonder, thus to see your face once more.<br>
  Happy is the chance which joins us after long, long years of pain:<br>
  And, oh, blessed was whatever sent you back to me again!<br>
  Now our pleasure will be real &mdash; now our hopes again are young:<br>
  Now we&rsquo;ll climb Life&rsquo;s brightest summits, dark-haired Maid of Gerringong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the sound of many footfalls, did you falter with  regret<br>
  For a step which used to gladden in the time so vivid yet?<br>
  When they left you in the night-hours, did you lie awake like me,<br>
  With the thoughts of what we had been &mdash; what we never more could be?<br>
  Ah! you look but do not answer while I halt and question here,<br>
  Wondering why I am so happy, doubting that you are so near.<br>
  Sure these eyes with love are blinded, for your form is waxing faint;<br>
  And a dreamy splendour crowns it, like the halo round a saint!<br>
  When I talk of what we will be, and new aspirations throng,<br>
  Why are you so sadly silent, dark-haired Maid of Gerringong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she faded into sunset, and the sunset passed from  sight;<br>
  And I followed madly after, through the misty, moony night,<br>
  Crying, &ldquo;do not leave me lonely! Life has been so cold and drear,<br>
  You are all that God has left me, and I want you to be near!<br>
  Do not leave me in the darkness! I have walked a weary way,<br>
  Listening for your truant footsteps &mdash; turn and stay, my darling, stay!&rdquo;<br>
  But she came not though I waited, watching through a splendid haze,<br>
  Where the lovely Phantom halted ere she vanished from my gaze.<br>
  Then I thought that rain was falling, for there rose a stormy song,<br>
  And I woke in gloom and tempest, dark-haired Maid of Gerringong!</p>

  Till the evening closed about him &mdash; till the strength to move was gone;<br>
  Then he penned his latest writings, and, before his life was spent,<br>
  Gave the records to his comrade &mdash; gave the watch he said was lent &mdash;<br>
  Gave them with his last commandments, charging him that night to stay<br>
  And to let him lie unburied when the soul had passed away.</p>
<p>Through that night he uttered little, rambling were the  words he spoke:<br>
  And he turned and died in silence, when the tardy morning broke.<br>
  Many memories come together whilst in sight of death we dwell,<br>
  Much of sweet and sad reflection through the weary mind must well.<br>
  As those long hours glided past him, till the east with light was fraught,<br>
  Who may know the mournful secret &mdash; who can tell us what he thought?<br>
  Very lone and very wretched was the brave man left behind,<br>
  Wandering over leagues of waste-land, seeking, hoping help to find;<br>
  Sleeping in deserted wurleys, fearful many nightfalls through<br>
  Lest unfriendly hands should rob him of his hoard of wild nardoo.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Ere he reached their old encampment &mdash; ere the well-known  spot was gained,<br>
  Something nerved him &mdash; something whispered that his other chief remained.<br>
  So he searched for food to give him, trusting they might both survive<br>
  Till the aid so long expected from the cities should arrive;<br>
  So he searched for food and took it to the gunyah where he found<br>
  Silence broken by his footfalls &mdash; death and darkness on the ground.</p>
<p>Weak and wearied with his journey, there the lone survivor  stooped,<br>
  And the disappointment bowed him and his heart with sadness drooped,<br>
  And he rose and raked a hollow with his wasted, feeble hands,<br>
  Where he took and hid the hero, in the rushes and the sands;<br>
  But he, like a brother, laid him out of reach of wind and rain,<br>
  And for many days he sojourned near him on that wild-faced plain;<br>
  Whilst he stayed beside the ruin, whilst he lingered with the dead,<br>
  Oh! he must have sat in shadow, gloomy as the tears he shed.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Where our noble Burke was lying &mdash; where his sad companion  stood,<br>
  Came the natives of the forest &mdash; came the wild men of the wood;<br>
  Down they looked, and saw the stranger &mdash; he who there in quiet slept &mdash;<br>
  Down they knelt, and o&rsquo;er the chieftain bitterly they moaned and wept:<br>
  Bitterly they mourned to see him all uncovered to the blast &mdash;<br>
  All uncovered to the tempest as it wailed and whistled past;<br>
  And they shrouded him with bushes, so in death that he might lie,<br>
  Like a warrior of their nation, sheltered from the stormy sky.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Ye must rise and sing their praises, O ye bards with souls  of fire,<br>
  For the people&rsquo;s voice shall echo through the wailings of your lyre;<br>
  And we&rsquo;ll welcome back their comrade, though our eyes with tears be blind<br>
  At the thoughts of promise perished, and the shadow left behind;<br>
  Now the leaves are bleaching round them &mdash; now the gales above them glide,<br>
  But the end was all accomplished, and their fame is far and wide.<br>
  Though this fadeless glory cannot hide a grateful nation&rsquo;s grief,<br>
  And their laurels have been blended with the gloomy cypress leaf.</p>
<p>Let them rest where they have laboured! but, my country,  mourn and moan;<br>
  We must build with human sorrow grander monuments than stone.<br>
  Let them rest, for oh! remember, that in long hereafter time<br>
  Sons of Science oft shall wander o&rsquo;er that solitary clime!<br>
  Cities bright shall rise about it, Age and Beauty there shall stray,<br>
  And the fathers of the people, pointing to the graves, shall say:<br>
  &ldquo;Here they fell, the glorious martyrs! when these plains were woodlands deep;<br>
  Here a friend, a brother, laid them; here the wild men came to weep.&rdquo;</p>

  The god-like Sun, arrayed<br>
  In blinding splendour, swiftly rose,<br>
  And looked athwart the glade;<br>
  The sleepy dingo watched him break<br>
  The bonds that curbed his flight;<br>
  And from his golden tresses shake<br>
  The fading gems of Night!<br>
  And wild goburras laughed aloud<br>
  Their merry morning songs,<br>
  As Echo answered in the depths<br>
  With a thousand thousand tongues;<br>
  The gully-depths where many a vine<br>
  Of ancient growth had crept,<br>
  To cluster round the hoary pine,<br>
  Where scanty mosses wept.</p>
<p>Huge stones, and damp and broken crags,<br>
  In wild chaotic heap,<br>
  Were lying at the barren base<br>
  Of the ferny hillside steep;<br>
  Between those fragments hollows lay,<br>
  Upfilled with fruitful ground,<br>
  Where many a modest floweret grew,<br>
  To scent the wind-breaths round;<br>
  As fertile patches bloom within<br>
  A dried and worldly heart,<br>
  When some that look can only see<br>
  The cold, the barren part!<br>
  The Miser, full with thoughts of gain,<br>
  The meanest of his race,<br>
  May in his breast some verdure hide,<br>
  Though none that verdure trace.</p>
<p>Where time-worn cliffs were jutting out,<br>
  With rough and ragged edges,<br>
  The snowy mountain-lily slept<br>
  Behind the earthy ledges;<br>
  Like some sweet Oriental Maid,<br>
  Who blindly deems it duty<br>
  To wear a veil before her face,<br>
  And hide her peerless beauty;<br>
  Or like to Innocence that thrives<br>
  In midst of sin and sorrows,<br>
  Nor from the cheerless scene around<br>
  The least infection borrows,<br>
  But stayeth out her mortal life &mdash;<br>
  Though in that lifetime lonely &mdash;<br>
  With Virtue&rsquo;s lustre round her heart,<br>
  And Virtue&rsquo;s lustre only.</p>
<p>A patch of sunshine here and there<br>
  Lay on a leaf-strewn water-pool,<br>
  Whose tribute trickled down the rocks<br>
  In gurgling ripples, clear and cool!<br>
  As iguanas, from the clefts,<br>
  Would steal along with rustling sound,<br>
  To where the restless eddies roamed<br>
  Amongst the arrowy rushes round.<br>
  While, scanning them with angry eyes<br>
  From off a fallen myrtle log<br>
  That branchless bridged the brushy creek,<br>
  There stood and barked, a Shepherd&rsquo;s Dog!<br>
  And underneath a neighbouring mass<br>
  Of wattles intertwining,<br>
  His Master lay &mdash; his back against<br>
  The grassy banks reclining.</p>
<p>Beneath the shade of ironbarks,<br>
  Stretched o&rsquo;er the valley&rsquo;s sloping bed &mdash;<br>
  Half hidden in a tea-tree scrub,<br>
  A flock of dusky sheep were spread;<br>
  And fitful bleating faintly came<br>
  On every joyous breath of wind,<br>
  That up the stony hills would fly,<br>
  And leave the hollows far behind!<br>
  Wild tones of music from the Creek<br>
  Were intermingling with the breeze,<br>
  The loud, rich lays of countless birds<br>
  Perched on the dark mimosa trees;<br>
  Those merry birds, with wings of light<br>
  Which rival every golden ray<br>
  Out-flashing from the lamps of Night,<br>
  Or streaming o&rsquo;er the brow of Day.</p>
<p>Amongst the gnarly apple-trees,<br>
  A gorgeous tribe of parrots came;<br>
  And screaming, leapt from bough to bough,<br>
  Like living jets of crimson flame!<br>
  And where the hillside-growing gums<br>
  Their web-like foliage upward threw,<br>
  Old Nature rang with echoes from<br>
  The loud-voiced mountain cockatoo;<br>
  And a thousand nameless twittering things,<br>
  Between the rustling sapling sprays,<br>
  Were flashing through the fragrant leaves,<br>
  And dancing like to fabled fays;<br>
  Rejoicing in the glorious light<br>
  That beauteous Morning had unfurled<br>
  To make the heart of Nature glad,<br>
  And clothe with smiles a weeping World.</p>

  Like wine, which is spilt when the people are wanting,<br>
  And hot winds have dried all the cisterns of Elim!<br>
  For love that is wasted her women were wailing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The timbrels fall silent! And dost thou not hear it,<br>
  A voice, like the sound of a lute when we loiter,<br>
  And sit by the pools in the valleys of Arnon,<br>
  And suck the cool grapes that are growing in clusters?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She glides, like a myrrh-scented wind, through the  willows,<br>
  O Ada! behold it is Achan that speaketh:<br>
  I know thou art near me, but never can see thee,<br>
  Because of the horrible drouth in mine eyelids.&rdquo;</p>
