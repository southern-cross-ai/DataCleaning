<p class="caption">King Edward III.</p>
</div>

<p class="first">THE following narrative deals, in a broad,
impressionistic manner, with the last few years of the life of
Edward Plantagenet, K.G., Prince of Wales, and his rule as Duke
of Aquitaine in the provinces of Guienne and Gascony.</p>

<p>This very popular English Prince, the hero of the Hundred
Years War and the victor of Crêcy, Poictiers and Najera, has been
the central figure of (I believe) a vast number of romances. The
present novel is not a biography or study of this famous Prince
of Wales, but an impressionistic relation of the fatal Spanish
campaign of 1366 and the subsequent revolt of Aquitaine in 1370,
considered from many points of view.</p>

<p>The political events with which the story deals are the revolt
of Don Enriquez of Transtamara against Don Pedro, and the
intervention of France, Aragon, Navarre, England and the Pope in
the quarrel which thus became the cause of the ruin of the
English fortunes in France, and of a renewal of the war between
Charles V and Edward III. Don Enriquez was one of nine natural
children of Alfonso the Conqueror, by Eleanora de Guzman, and
after regaining the throne of Castile in 1370 ruled long and
prosperously.</p>

<p>Readers of historical novels are sometimes interested to know
the authorities an author has used and the proportion of fact and
fiction that has gone to the making of the narrative; it is easy
to give the first information, difficult to supply the
second.</p>

<p>The details of continental affairs are scattered over too wide
a field to be given here, but Froissart is, of course, an
entrancing, if sometimes untrustworthy guide to the ramifications
of European intrigues and wars of the late fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>Contemporary authorities (often unreliable or doubtful) are:
The Chandos Herald, Froissart, Baker's Chronicle, Rymer's Foedera,
and the Calendars of the Patent and Close Rolls. Three
biographies of this Prince of Wales are in existence, that by G.
P. R. James, that by Monsieur Moisant (dealing especially with
Aquitaine), and that by R. P. Dunn-Pattison, M.A., which is
succinct, impartial, provided with maps and plans, and contains
nearly all that is known of this hero. The Life of John of Gaunt
by Armitage Smith gives a detailed account of the Aquitaine
disaster.</p>

<p>The magnificent tomb of the eldest son of Edward III in
Canterbury Cathedral is well known as one of the finest treasures
we have left to us of this period. Less familiar perhaps, is the
small gilded effigy of him on the tomb of his father, Edward III,
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>A beautiful fresco portrait of this Prince (of which
engravings remain) was on the wall of St. Stephen's Chapel,
Westminster&mdash;it showed the Prince in his youth. This was
destroyed by fire in 1835.</p>

<p>The sobriquet, "the Black Prince," has not been used in this
work as the first mention of it is in Grafton's Chronicle,
written in 1563, nearly two hundred years after the death of
Edward of Woodstock. Camden's tale, associated with Edward of
Plantagenet, of the three ostrich feathers and the blind King of
Bohemia seems to be mere legend; the emblem of the three feathers
in their original form, viz. separate, erect and uncurled, was
used by many other princes and probably originated in the East.
Even in ancient Egypt this symbol stood for authority and virtue.

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE WHITE CAT OF SEVILLE</h2>

<p class="first">NUNREDDIN lay at his ease and conversed with the
slave Yussuf who had been appointed his attendant. He reclined on
a mattress of bronze-coloured silk near the gilded alabaster
window. Through the arch of this showed the moon-coloured air,
high trees laden with early fruits and late blossom, and a
crystal bright fountain jet falling into a basin lined with
silver.</p>

<p>"Everyone in the palace," said Nunreddin softly, "is either
drunk or asleep and we may converse quite freely."</p>

<p>But the other was timid. He cast his eyes frequently round the
chamber, the proportions of which were hidden in shadow.</p>

<p>"How long," asked Nunreddin, "have you been a slave in this
palace?"</p>

<p>Yussuf hardly knew. It was indeed useless for him to keep an
account of time. He was young and had been born in slavery. He
believed that his father had been a Persian of Thun.</p>

<p>Lying prone on his stomach and drawing himself a little nearer
the feet of Nunreddin, Yussuf asked if it was possible for him to
follow in the retinue of King Abu-Sa'ad when this left
Seville?</p>

<p>"It is ill for a man to live out all his days in slavery and I
have aspirations towards learning. I have heard that you are a
very famous philosopher and wise."</p>

<p>"Even a slave has heard that?" smiled Nunreddin.</p>

<p>"But why do we talk of such trivial things? The night is so
beautiful and it is not given to many of us to enjoy beautiful
nights without number."</p>

<p>"Little is beautiful to him who languishes in captivity,"
sighed the slave mournfully.</p>

<p>Then he also was silent and the two dark faces turned towards
the moonlight, which revealed the soft shape and colour of fruit
and the chalices of flowers in the royal gardens below.</p>

<p>Some white peacocks, as if roused from their sleep by the
brilliancy of the night, were walking round the silver basin into
which the fountain jet splashed.</p>

<p>Bright citrons and lemons had fallen from the boughs and lay,
greenish-yellow, on the marble pavement.</p>

<p>The philosopher and the slave both thought that they saw the
shapes of birds with long tails like spun glass flying through
the feathery fronds of the overgrown trees.</p>

<p>A creeping plant, with smooth tendrils like ropes of silk,
hung beneath the balcony of the window and swung huge blossoms of
wine-red colour.</p>

<p>"O Nunreddin, will you not have pity on me?" murmured the
slave.</p>

<p>"And get you away from Seville?" smiled the philosopher. "It
seems to me one of the most enchanting places in the world.
Indeed, Yussuf," he added, "I should have little to offer did I
help you from your captivity. For my life is a continual
wandering."</p>

<p>"Tell me something of your life, master," urged the slave.</p>

<p>"I am of peasant origin and was born in Asia Minor. I learnt
Arabic in Baghdad. I have studied, and with some zeal, the great
philosophers. I have learnt logic at Harran from a Christian
physician. I have studied medicine for thirty years and have some
skill. In my searchings for philosophy I have journeyed into
Syria, Egypt and now, as you see, into Spain."</p>

<p>"You have always been free!"</p>

<p>"Yes, for I have despised the world and been at no pains to
collect wealth. The usages of society have never been anything to
me," he added; "I have always found sufficient company in music,
in nights like this and in my own reflections. And as much is
open to you, even if you are a slave. So you see that, after all,
there is very little I can offer you."</p>

<p>"They say you can speak seventy languages," murmured the
slave.</p>

<p>He drew himself up to a sitting position and, clasping his
brown hands round his knees, he smiled.</p>

<p>One of the peacocks rose with a scream from the fountain and
disappeared like a silver flame among the delicate leaves of the
pepper trees.</p>

<p>"Well," said the physician, using the dialect which was the
only tongue familiar to the slave, "I know enough to converse
with you and that is sufficient. Tell me something of your
master&mdash;this King Pedro."</p>

<p>"Why should he interest you?" replied Yussuf sullenly. "He is
a tyrant and there are many such in the world. Surely, O great
philosopher! you who have penetrated the mysteries of
transcendental philosophy, and know medicine and mathematics, are
not interested in such as this Pedro of Castile&mdash;a lustful,
cruel brute, set in a high place."</p>

<p>"But," mused Nunreddin, "it is true that to-night the King
behaved himself quite well. My master Abu-Sa'ad was very pleased
with his reception."</p>

<p>"Abu-Sa'ad," said the slave, "is a usurper and Pedro is an
ally of Muhammed, the lawful King of Granada. What does he
here?"</p>

<p>"O slave!" replied the doctor, smiling, "he hopes to so
flatter this Christian Pedro that he will aid him to push his
brother from the throne of Granada, and I believe that he has
succeeded."</p>

<p>"It has none of it anything to do with me," sighed the slave,
"unless, master, you can contrive that I escape with you when you
return to-morrow."</p>

<p>A lovely stillness lay over the garden and the palace.</p>

<p>The festival which the King of Castile had given to the
usurping King of Granada had been tedious, brilliant and noisy,
and this long silence was very gracious to the ears of the
doctor.</p>

<p>He drew over his thin brown chest his light saffron-coloured
silk robe and moved nearer to the arched window, stretching his
lean neck and opening his full lips as if he drank in a
voluptuous draught combined of the moonlight, the heavy perfume
of the ripening fruits and the dewy exhalations of the
flowers.</p>

<p>The slave glanced at him in awe.</p>

<p>He was a man of fifty years, sleek, with a beard and turban
that seemed one hue of dark ashy silver, and blood-shot,
close-gazing eyes.</p>

<p>From his neck hung an amulet&mdash;a square of dark blue glass
or crystal, set in a wooden frame suspended from a scarlet
cord.</p>

<p>On the forefinger of his right hand was a seal with characters
which the slave shuddered to behold.</p>

<p>His aspect and his manner were kind, even compassionate, but
he could scarcely disguise how he despised the frailties and
superstitions of mankind.</p>

<p>From behind a lattice of ebony and mother-o'-pearl he had
watched the costly feast which the King of Castile had offered to
Abu-Sa'ad.</p>

<p>The two Kings had sat side by side on a silken divan. The
noble figure of the Moor had bowed before the Christian, so that
the chains round his neck, of pearls, dyed rose and blue, and
square lumps of gold as large as a walnut, had touched the mosaic
floor.</p>

<p>King Pedro had brought out all his gilt and silver vessels to
do honour to his royal guest.</p>

<p>But the Moor and his attendants had far outshone the Spanish
pomp.</p>

<p>By midnight everyone had been drunk, drowsy, or exhausted.
Luscious plums, bursting figs, overripe pears had been crushed
under foot. Sweetmeats and scented wax tapers had melted together
on the long table. The Christians had begun to boast insolently
of their Faith, their power, their wealth, their warlike exploits
and their women. The Moors had retained their dignity and
courtesy.</p>

<p>Abu-Sa'ad had unwound from his waist a long scarf of green
gauze hung with emerald tassels, and had passed it over the
shoulders of Don Pedro.</p>

<p>Taking this as a signal, the other Moors had pressed some rich
trifle from their person on to their Christian neighbours.</p>

<p>Pedro, standing in his place and speaking thickly, had sworn
that he would forsake his ally Muhammed, the lawful King of
Granada, and put in his place Abu-Sa'ad. That would mean another
war.</p>

<p>Nunreddin the philosopher smiled at this recollection and
gazed across the gracious garden.</p>

<p>A few milky clouds rose into the dark azure of the sky. The
stars sparkled with an ice-blue radiance.</p>

<p>"How stupid they all are!" said Nunreddin, "like
children."</p>

<p>The slave sighed, he had given up hope of release. Nunreddin,
he believed, was indifferent to him and his fate.</p>

<p>The other white peacock rose and circled above the fountain, a
silvery bird above the crystal spray. The dark purple-red
chalices of the flowers beneath the balcony swayed in an
intangible breeze. The more distant trees were a mere haze of
hyacinth silver. Through them floated the pale shapes of two
large owls.</p>

<p>The slave, who only lived by the quickness of his senses, drew
himself silently to his feet.</p>

<p>"There is somebody moving outside," he said softly.</p>

<p>"It is very likely," agreed the doctor.</p>

<p>The stained whites of his eyes shone as he turned them.</p>

<p>"But they were all so drunk," muttered Yussuf in his fine ear.
"Anyone who is awake to-night would be so of a purpose."</p>

<p>"What purpose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>A shrill, sobbing scream bubbled out of the violet-silver of
the night.</p>

<p>"The owls have found their prey."</p>

<p>The doctor stretched his lean arm across his mattress and
pulled a dagger from under his pillow.</p>

<p>"Slippered feet are outside," breathed Yussuf.</p>

<p>The doctor fastened the weapon to his belt.</p>

<p>"May not the Castilians move about their own palace, even in
the night-time, O Yussuf?"</p>

<p>The slave repeated:</p>

<p>"They were so drunk."</p>

<p>The doctor crept to the wall, fumbling for the amber handle of
the door in the shadowed portion of the chamber. This he found
and pulled the door open on to a labyrinth of arched corridors
shot by moonbeams and interlaced with varying depths of
shadow.</p>

<p>There was a medley of sound coming from this medley of shade.
Paddings, slow treadings of slippered feet, jingle of metal on
metal, swish of silk against silk, dropping of heavy curtains
into place, whispers dying into sighs, moans and gurgles dying
into silence.</p>

<p>Through the silvery shiver of the moonbeams and the troubled
rich shadows in the corridor these shufflings and these muted
cries were many times repeated.</p>

<p>The wind wafted through the piercings of a high arch the
odours of the ripening fruit in the gardens. Soon the moon
gliding above even the highest trees and the gilded towers of the
palace would be at her zenith and all these passages be filled
with darkness.</p>

<p>The burden of strange happenings lay heavy on the spirit of
the slave. He wished to creep away, but was afraid to leave the
guardianship of the doctor. He no longer cherished any radiant
thoughts of freedom or adventure, nor even of lying at length in
the cool of the night on the tessellated floor of Nunreddin's
chamber and listening to his tales of Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia,
Persia, and other distant lands where he had gained his famous
and perhaps dangerous knowledge. The slave only desired to creep
away to his own quarters, but he did not dare to do so for fear
of what he might see on the way there.</p>

<p>The doctor stood alert, all his acute senses straining.</p>

<p>There came suddenly a sound of ripping and tearing, of heavy
metal being dragged, of silk being rent.</p>

<p>Feeling his way by the wall, which was cold to his touch, the
wise man slipped along the passage followed by the noiseless
slave.</p>

<p>When they came to a turning they saw the red light of a lamp
burning beneath the shrine of a saint&mdash;a contorted figure
painted in rude colours which glowered from a niche.</p>

<p>Nunreddin turned, gently pulled at the creeping slave and laid
his lips to his ear.</p>

<p>"Are those the apartments of Abu-Sa'ad?" he asked in a
whisper, light as a sigh.</p>

<p>He saw the slave nod.</p>

<p>There was a tumult, vehement but hushed, of gathering
footsteps.</p>

<p>The two Orientals drew back, and with a common instinct, hid
behind a length of wall tapestry which hung behind them, and so
concealed themselves.</p>

<p>Someone hurried past in the darkness. Someone who was
easy-slippered with light foot, someone who was breathing
hard.</p>

<p>Nunreddin slowly crept out of his concealment.</p>

<p>"Occasionally men are not as drunk as they feign to be," he
thought to himself.</p>

<p>From some high, open, unseen window came a stir of colder
wind.</p>

<p>The slave wriggled along behind the stiff tapestry, now and
then peeping between the panels, the whites of his eyes and the
saliva on his loose-hung lips gleamed in the red light of the
sacred lamp.</p>

<p>"You had better look after yourself," muttered the doctor. "My
company will only do you harm."</p>

<p>Yussuf nodded. He believed that those padding footsteps had
gone to Nunreddin's chamber. His eyelids twitched; the sweat
gathered on his low forehead.</p>

<p>Nunreddin marked curiously these signs of fear and
cowardice.</p>

<p>"One would think you had very little to live for," he remarked
in his lightest of whispers, and with a slantwise movement he
crept away towards the red light.</p>

<p>This stood between two high doors screened by curtains of
interchanged silk of green and yellow. Both had been dragged
aside and one had been torn from the pole.</p>

<p>Nunreddin's sunken but flashing eyes glanced from one to the
other of these entrances.</p>

<p>A few hours ago he had seen Abu-Sa'ad, the usurping King of
Granada, pass behind one of these curtains, and the nobles of his
retinue behind the other.</p>

<p>Poised lightly on his toes, Nunreddin listened.</p>

<p>From the high, open window, which had admitted the wind and
the moonbeams, came the distant, mournful, harsh cry of the
peacocks.</p>

<p>Nunreddin, not disturbing the torn curtain, stepped into the
guest-chamber occupied by Abu-Sa'ad.</p>

<p>In sharp relief against the purple darkness of the apartment
was the scarlet flame of an aromatic pastille burning on a
brazier; thin spirals of acrid perfume rose from this slow
fire.</p>

<p>Nunreddin glided into the chamber.</p>

<p>It was dome-shaped and had for summer pleasure a semicircle of
small windows opening on to a colonnade. But all was dark. The
moonlight had left this part of the palace.</p>

<p>With snake-like stealth Nunreddin returned to the passage and
listened again.</p>

<p>The palace was silent.</p>

<p>He took the red lamp from the shrine and returned to the
chamber of the usurping King of Granada. He held the small sacred
flame high and peered about, careful how he trod. He saw what he
had expected to see.</p>

<p>There were four murdered men in the room.</p>

<p>Abu-Sa'ad lay stretched naked on the black marble floor. His
white night-robe was a bloodstained rag across his glistening
body. His skull had been split to the teeth. The purple gashes
were stiffening on his breast and arms. Near his feet his young
brother was huddled, a knife through his back, the bodies of the
King's chamberlain and equerry lay near the colonnaded window. It
was obvious that they too had been slain in their sleep.</p>

<p>The room was in disorder. Nothing had been left to the Moors
but some rags of linen.</p>

<p>Abu-Sa'ad's signet finger had been chopped off. His inlaid
armour, jewelled weapons, the belts, helmets, scarves and
bracelets&mdash;all the appointments and accoutrements of the
usurping King of Granada and his suite had been taken.</p>

<p>Nunreddin moved carefully. He did not wish to leave a track of
blood behind him. Without faltering he replaced the lamp above
the shrine, then peered through the other door, his exquisite
sensibilities needing no light.</p>

<p>Here was silence and a gross smell of blood and death.</p>

<p>All the Moors had been massacred by their host Don Pedro, King
of Castile, and his knights.</p>

<p>"Because of their jewels and their splendid equipment,"
thought Nunreddin to himself. "They were foolish to come so
gorgeously clad." Pedro would, of course, endeavour to murder
him, too. Not that he had any riches to excite his envy, but he
regarded him as a magician, and was afraid of his spells. Also,
no doubt, Pedro had vowed, in a frenzy of religious fervour, to
dispatch any heathen whom he might meet. "The Christian's
hospitality is dangerous," smiled the doctor to himself. "Had I
not stayed up gossiping with the slave and admiring the moon, I,
too, had been murdered."</p>

<p>There were other Moors housed that night in the palace of
Seville&mdash;servants, grooms and slaves.</p>

<p>No doubt by now these also would have been murdered for their
arms and the sumptuously-apparelled horses in the stables,
exquisite Arab and Turkish steeds, war-chargers and
baggage-mules, with their harness of dyed leather, enriched with
balls of silver and squares of Turkish amber. Yes, it was quite
certain that the first Christian he chanced to meet would
instantly slay him, despite all the compliments he had received
last night, as to his wisdom and cunning, and the great extent of
his learning.</p>

<p>Crouched up against the wall without the circle of light of
the sacred lamp, he listened.</p>

<p>In the distance were those shuffling footsteps again and the
light ring of metal on metal.</p>

<p>Above these sounds rose a wailing voice of rage.</p>

<p>"It was a crystal with a purple stain! I cannot find it! I
have been robbed!"</p>

<p>Nunreddin recognized the thick voice, always either sullen or
excited, of Pedro of Castile.</p>

<p>The doctor slipped back into the chamber of the murdered King
of Granada. Death did not inspire him with fear nor corpses with
disgust. Holding his silken robe about him he moved to the window
and stood on the balcony behind one of the groups of clustered
columns which supported the delicate uprising arch.</p>

<p>The moon had sunk behind the lowest tower of the palace. A
grey pause that was neither light nor dark filled the night.</p>

<p>Nunreddin peered down to see how low the drop might be to the
garden. He believed that he could let himself down by the thick
fleshy tendrils of the wide-leaved creeper.</p>

<p>A flare of light filled the chamber behind; a Castilian had
returned to see if the murderers had missed any spoils.</p>

<p>Nunreddin heard the King's voice again lamenting the loss of
the purple-stained crystal. He had observed this jewel with sick
eyes of envy, during the feast, when it had glowed with sombre
flame in the deft folds of Abu-Sa'ad's bronze-tissue turban.</p>

<p>Among the scattered limbs of dead men, the blood and the torn
bed-furnishings, the Castilian began to search for this jewel.
The strong light of a great lantern fell over the hideous
disorder of the guest-chamber and struck the armour of the huge
soldier behind the King into specks of flame. The searchers
quaked. They were afraid of the slim, brown dead men. They were
afraid of the King, standing in front of the warrior with the
lantern&mdash;now shouting, now raving for the purple-flushed
crystal. They could not find this envied gem.</p>

<p>Pedro of Castile had a small axe in his hand. Blood and hair
defaced the gleam of it. The veins on his neck and forehead
seemed bursting, sweat glistened on to his eyebrows and ran down
his face. His coat, stained with wine, slashed with gold, had
been torn open on his shirt by some dying Moor's struggles. He
had put on his helmet with the green African plumes; these added
some three feet to his already gigantic height.</p>

<p>Like a phantom the doctor crouched on the balcony in that blue
gloom which was not yet dawn, and raised his voice into a high,
whispering falsetto:</p>

<p>"Shall he have peace who slew his guest?"</p>

<p>Don Pedro stood erect, rigid with superstitious fear. The
stiff collar of his caftan rising to his ears framed a face as
spent as ashes. He crossed himself and muttered:</p>

<p>"The magician!"</p>

<p>Grovelling on the blood-stained floor among the dead men the
Castilians fawned upon their patron saint to aid the search for
the purple-flushed crystal.</p>

<p>The doctor called out in the same assumed, mocking voice:</p>

<p>"Perhaps this crystal contains the supreme secrets of hermetic
philosophy which are hidden in the four elements and will only
work harm to the ignorant and the evil."</p>

<p>"Spawn of the Devil!" muttered Pedro, and made a signal to his
huddled men to attack the magician. But none of them dared raise
a hand against Nunreddin, who appeared to them to be veritably
under the protection of some terrible power.</p>

<p>Seeing that his men refused to move and that the figure of the
doctor remained a shadow in the dawn-light behind the clustered
pillars, the huge frame of Pedro began to quake and the befouled
axe dropped to his side.</p>

<p>Nunreddin turned coolly away, leapt the balcony and, with
agile fingers clinging to the stout creepers, lowered himself,
light as a panther, to the marble pavement of the garden.</p>

<p>The rising wind was lifting the chalices of the trumpet-shaped
flowers as if invisible hands carried them to invisible lips.</p>

<p>Nunreddin slipped in and out of the quince, pomegranate and
pepper trees; with every second the light was strengthening. The
gilded spires and minarets of the palace and the boughs of the
highest trees where the doves chattered together were stained red
by the first beams of the rising sun. Nunreddin came out by the
stables.</p>

<p>The murdered Moorish grooms were lying along the walls. The
Castilians were tearing the discs of gold from their leathern
tunics.</p>

<p>Beneath a bough of white bell-flowers one of the coffers of
Abu-Sa'ad had been broken open and pages were throwing right and
left the contents&mdash;scarves, daggers, flat bags of vermilion
silk, cedar-wood boxes full of spiced preserves. Many of these
had been intended as presents to Don Pedro and his nobles.</p>

<p><br>
STANDING apart by a fountain, which the light wind transformed
into a veil of glittering drops, was a man whom Nunreddin knew,
Don Gomez Carillo de Quintania, grand Chamberlain of Castile. He
surveyed the plunderers with a look of contempt. His arms were
folded on the breast of his caftan of radiant silk. A stiff
turban in the Spanish fashion was bound round his frowning
brows.</p>

<p>Nunreddin approached him.</p>

<p>"Was this massacre premeditated?" he asked coolly, "or was it
caused by a sudden lust?"</p>

<p>"My master," replied the High Chamberlain, speaking as
indifferently as he had been addressed, "intended to be the
friend of this Abu-Sa'ad and to assist him with many knights to
push his brother from the throne of Granada. But he was tempted,"
added the Castilian sarcastically, "by the sight of so many
jewels and such rich appointments. He thought it was a lucky
occasion also, for it happened to be the name-day of his patron
saint."</p>

<p>"To such an end have the immense treasures of Abu-Sa'ad
brought him," smiled Nunreddin.</p>

<p>The Chamberlain warned him that he had better be on his
way.</p>

<p>"No Moor, Turk or Persian, save the slaves, will be left alive
in the palace to-day."</p>

<p>Through the open doors of the stables could be seen the
beautiful Arabian horses, glossy and shining, with mild eyes and
gently-arched necks.</p>

<p>"Are you really a magician and an alchemist?" added Don Gomez
Carillo. "You appear of an unparalleled coolness in this
adventure. Perhaps you do know something of the secrets of the
supernal triumph of alchemy? Perhaps," he continued, with a flash
of eagerness, "you are familiar with the writings of the adept,
Adfar, who was in the service of Kalid, the Sultan of Egypt? It
is said that his writings, fine and curious, contained the secret
of the Philosopher's Stone."</p>

<p>"Are you too nosing after gold?" asked the doctor. "Have you
not to-night seen the ill-effects of possessing it? As for me,
one must be a hermit to escape scenes like this. Your King is
occupied for awhile at least. He is searching for a stone, a
diamond or a crystal, which he envied in the turban of
Abu-Sa'ad."</p>

<p>The baggage of the usurping King of Granada, which had been
torn from the backs of the sumpter mules, was scattered round the
fountain and against the walls of the royal stables.</p>

<p>Hauberks of mail, so fine that each jerkin contained thousands
of small steel rings, agraffes of heron and ostrich with clasps
of rubies and sapphires, robes of satin padded with cotton-wool
and quilted, and scimitars with handles of white jade studded
with chalcedony and firestone... these riches and treasures were
scattered beneath the trees, hung with swelling figs, glistening
pomegranates, with the feathery leaves and late scarlet fleshy
blossoms of the pepper tree.</p>

<p>"The king," said the Chamberlain, looking at Nunreddin, "had
nine misbegotten brothers, the sons of Eleanora de Guzman, who
was a notable termagant. Six he has slain but three survive."</p>

<p>"For how long?" questioned Nunreddin.</p>

<p>"Castile," added the Chamberlain, "is a country to be coveted.
The eldest of these bastards, who is Don Enriquez, the Duque de
Transtamara, would give much to the man who would put Castile
into his hands, as I put this into thine." He clutched a golden
fig and laid it in the lean palm of Nunreddin. "Eat, you must
have a parched throat after the events of this night, go your way
and listen well to what you may hear on the high road."</p>

<p>The sun, now overtopping the palace, was full on the
Castilian's lean, intelligent face, with the heavy-lidded eyes
and the full lips.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he smiled, "one day you and I, O Nunreddin, may be
able in some interval of peace to discuss the secrets of
mathematics, philosophy and alchemy."</p>

<p>The air, which had been so fragrantly cool, began to be
tainted with the odour of mutilated dead flesh and dried
blood.</p>

<p>The bodies of Abu-Sa'ad, his brothers and his attendants had
been tossed from the balcony into the gardens below.</p>

<p>The corpse of the usurping King of Granada fell into the
silver-lined basin of the fountain. His blood was caught up in
the water and the lifting spray was stained red.</p>

<p>Nunreddin and the Chamberlain, prying through the oleanders,
the roses, the trumpet-shaped lilies, observed this. Then the
doctor, with a fastidious movement, dabbled his hands in the
other fountain near the stables by which he stood. He had eaten
the fig with relish.</p>

<p>Without speaking further to the High Chamberlain he went on
his way, keeping cautiously in the shelter of the flowers and
shrubs, which seemed to move and spread themselves voluptuously
in the increasing heat of the sun.</p>

<p>A party of Castilian knights passed through the garden. Their
heads were bare but their bodies armoured. The metal clanked as
they carried some of the booty of the murdered Moors, which they
intended to bury in a distant part of the garden, away from the
jealous eyes of the King.</p>

<p>They pried about for the "magician" as they termed him. One
had a spear ready to throw.</p>

<p>Nunreddin crept deeper into the bushes.</p>

<p>When they drew close he lay flat, pulling great fronds of
ferns, curled and waving like a warrior's crest, over him. As he
lay so, crouching on the warm, dry earth, something soft leapt
into his breast&mdash;a white cat. The doctor turned and stared
into two perfect green eyes, while the creature rubbed against
him with delicate caresses. The Castilian knights passed. Their
angry blasphemy silenced the cooing of the doves.</p>

<p>On the highest spire of the palace hung the heavy banner of
Castile and Leon, sullen against the pole.</p>

<p>The sky took on a gold and burnished look. The day was fast
becoming tawny red, the tops of trees were outlined sharply and
edged with light.</p>

<p>Gathering the white cat into his bosom, and wrapping round it
his light silk tunic, Nunreddin, as deft and lithe as the
creature he carried, made his way through the shrubs, ferns and
flowers, scarcely disturbing a leaf.</p>

<p>When he cleared the voluptuous growth of plants and trees he
felt the bright light heavy on his skin. With his long easy
stride he crossed an open space of paving where starry flowers
and flowering agaves were set in sculptured pots.</p>

<p>From a stone peacote the coroneted heads and bronze necks of
the birds, at once proud and foolish, flashed in the steady
brilliance of the day. Some fowls behind an enclosure of silver
net clucked. Far off, a drum beat.</p>

<p>Nunreddin, with the cat nestling close, climbed a low wall and
stood without the palace looking on to a wide sweep of the
Guadalquiver.</p>

<p>The river was without colour or shade in the clear vibrating
light.</p>

<p>Nunreddin walked slowly. The heat began to be sweltry. His
feet, clad in soft leather ankle-boots, were pierced by the
thorns of the rank thicket of weeds, wild lilies and heath
flowers, many of which bore red, swollen and gaping seed-pods. He
regretted the mule which had been left behind in Don Pedro's
stables on which he had ridden into Granada yesterday, with the
harness of scarlet leather hung with little bells that had
tinkled pleasantly as he leisurely travelled in the train of the
usurping King of Granada.</p>

<p>Save for that distant drum-beat which was tremulous and
troubled there was silence.</p>

<p>Nunreddin looked back at the palace and its crowning standard
which seemed in the surrounding trees to be cut out of one solid
piece of bright metal.</p>

<p>The cat curled close into his bosom. His sweat damped the pure
fur. He felt his throat and lips dry and wished he had brought
away more of the figs; slowly, saving his strength, he followed
the road by the river. His narrowed eyes looked cunningly about.
No one in sight. The whole landscape was metallic, even the river
showed hard and solid. The walls, undulating about the city,
appeared like a ribbon of bronze.</p>

<p>Lizards, lustrous green and yellow bloomed with bright blue,
remained motionless in the stiff dry grasses by the roadside, as
if petrified by the brilliancy of the sunshine.</p>

<p>In the distance were ranges of mountains. These too appeared
hard and stiff.</p>

<p>Nunreddin espied a monastery. The smooth walls, from which the
keen sunlight picked fine fluted columns, delicate tracery work
and a roof of sharply-pointed arches, appeared to conceal
emptiness or stagnation. But Nunreddin knew that it was swarming
with eager and active life, just as the palace, which appeared
now a thin shape cut out of metal stamped on to the sky,
concealed all the tumult of war, rapine and murder.</p>

<p>Nunreddin knew there were treasures in that monastery which
even Don Pedro would never dare to envy&mdash;mitres of white
silk worked in heavy gold and precious jewels, pieces of gold
tissue to cover the Sacred Host, coffers full of costly
vestments, some of which had been sent, blessed and sanctified,
from Rome&mdash;green silk, red silk and gold silk, copes and
chasubles, encrusted with jewels, some of them weighing as
heavily as a cuirass.</p>

<p>In that sacred building also was a tunic of most curious
colours which had come from China, and there too was a skull of a
virgin martyr which was kept perpetually crowned with white
roses.</p>

<p>The monastery owned also a large chalice shaped like a
delicate bell which gave a musical sound as it was raised aloft,
above the tombs of kings, ancestors of Don Pedro son of Alfonso
the Conqueror, warriors silent at last in stone and metal.</p>

<p>Nunreddin envied none of these things nor did he desire to
glut his curiosity by looking at them, but he longed after the
cool fountains he knew there were in the cloisters, splashing on
to the paths of the herb garden and the leaves of citron and
lemon trees.</p>

<p>He envied too the monks' hour of rest in the heat of the day,
behind green lattices.</p>

<p>Nunreddin walked slowly till he came to a forest of cork
trees; their shrivelled boughs gave a meagre shade. He sat down
and counted out his treasures.</p>

<p>A purse of small Castilian money. A purse of money of the King
of Granada. A small book, the leaves of which were made of the
bark of a tree, covered in Arabic characters, and which was bound
in silver. Two or three glass phials carefully stoppered, two
small bones, one carved&mdash;and among all these the crystal,
white flushed with purple, which Don Pedro had been searching for
in the chamber of the murdered men.</p>

<p>Abu-Sa'ad had prized it so much that he had given it to the
doctor for safe keeping on his retirement at night during their
visit to the Castilian monarch.</p>

<p>"What next?" Nunreddin asked himself.</p>

<p>The cat leapt from his bosom and rubbed against his knees.</p>

<p>He moved on. Even in the cork forest small eddies of light
dust stirred. By noon he had cleared the wood and come out on to
a wayside inn with ragged boys playing in front of a vine-hung
shelter. At the side drooped an elderberry bush, heavy with
wine-dark fruit.</p>

<p>Nunreddin went in and with some of his money purchased a salad
and two hard eggs and some goat's milk for the cat. Two men in
the inn doorway were chaffering over the price of wool and
almonds. The way ahead was steep, rugged and dreary, with narrow
ledges of rock and an ill-made road. A bell tolled from the
church and a procession of monks moved across the stubble of a
sparse cornfield to the village near by. Beyond stretched the
highlands of Sierra Morena. Nunreddin remained thoughtful under
the vine, the white cat asleep at his feet.</p>

<p>The peasants who kept the inn regarded him with awe and
suspicion, suspecting him for a heathen but fearful lest he was a
magician as well.</p>

<p>He did not know where to go. He had counted on the success of
Abu-Sa'ad's embassy to Castile and had intended to remain in the
train of that monarch, who had promised him his support and
protection while he made some curious and, maybe vital,
experiments in alchemy. He certainly had not reckoned on the
massacre.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to return to Granada for the
reigning and now undisputed King, Muhammed, was his enemy, who
had shut him up once in a tower and threatened him with sharp
torture if he did not produce large quantities of gold. It had
taken all Nunreddin's adroitness to escape from that
predicament.</p>

<p>By the side of the road was a huge painted crucifix.
Nunreddin, eyeing it from the shadow of the withering vine,
pondered on the mysteries of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>The ragged, flea-bitten children stopped their gambolling to
stare at this man with the silvery turban, the silvery beard and
the fine yellow face that appeared polished on the bridge of the
nose and the high cheek-bones.</p>

<p>Nunreddin took no heed of them. He began to consider where and
how he could dispose of the diamond&mdash;the purple-flushed
crystal as Don Pedro had named the lovely jewel.</p>

<p>Of course the first man who knew that he had such a treasure
would instantly murder him. But if he could get into a
considerable city, Cordova for instance, he might find some Jew,
or a man even of his own race, who would buy the gem of him for a
moderate sum&mdash;a sum sufficient to secure to the philosopher
an interval of leisure. But Cordova must be nearly a hundred
miles away.</p>

<p>He again went into the inn. The shaded room had a faint, sour
atmosphere. He asked for water. He spoke Castilian so well that
they were reassured about his character and the woman of the inn,
old and enormously fat, wiped the grease from her brow and asked
him "where he had come from?"</p>

<p>When he said Seville, adding nothing to that information, she
began to talk about the King Don Pedro. Cocks and hens cackled in
the small, dry, straggling yard at the back of the building.</p>

<p>Across the distance a pinkish haze spread. Nunreddin could see
this view through the small unglazed aperture.</p>

<p>The woman again talked of the King and the Queen, but he felt
safe, for no one ever paid attention to a gossiping pot-wife.</p>

<p>"The Queen is dead," he commented.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, the King killed her! Shut her up in a tower and
tortured her to death!"</p>

<p>Nunreddin laughed. "So the French say&mdash;that is because
she was a Frenchwoman."</p>

<p>"It was because the King Don Pedro was bewitched by Maria de
Padilla&mdash;she ought to be burnt. One day," she added
viciously, "no doubt she will be burnt. A pity I live so far
away, here one never sees any sights."</p>

<p>A man came in with a dead pheasant and a hare hanging on a
stick over his shoulder. He had caught the last words of the
talk. "Did you see Donna Maria de Padilla?" he asked Nunreddin in
a tone of awe.</p>

<p>The doctor could truthfully answer "No." There had been no
women at the festival last night, only behind a lattice which
pierced the wall above the King's chair he thought he had caught
the flash of monstrous eyes and the long line of a white
neck.</p>

<p>"She has bewitched the King, worked spells on him," remarked
the man gravely. "She made him murder his wife the Lady Blanche
of Bourbon. That's why all the French are our enemies."</p>

<p>"But it is true," added the inn-woman with an air of justice,
"that the Frenchwoman made a great deal of fuss. She never took
anything quietly but was always complaining about every little
thing he did, so that whenever he offended her she must run and
tell her ladies and duennas." She shrugged her huge shoulders.
"Well, one knows what happens to women like that."</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, flinging the dead bird and hare on the
dirty table, disturbing the flies, "there was no need to have
murdered a woman of that sort. Maria de Padilla will be the ruin
of Don Pedro as Donna Eleanora de Guzman was the ruin of Alfonso
his father, and if Don Enriquez," he added significantly, "were
to make a try for the country, you would see that he got it."</p>

<p>Nunreddin looked at the dead hare flung over the corpse of the
bird. So had he seen the dead bodies of the Moors look in the
palace of Seville&mdash;one sight was just as horrible as another
to the oriental philosopher.</p>

<p>The hare was more beautiful than Abu-Sa'ad and more harmless.
There had not been one among his retinue who was so bright and
swift and graceful as the bird. In each case it was brutal
destruction to gratify a lust for gold, for food.</p>

<p>He left the foul air of the house and came on to the road
again. The sun had a little abated of its violence. He thought
that he would continue on the road. The shadows had begun to
lengthen.</p>

<p>Among the metallic outlines of the distant mountains were
flat, purple patches of shadows. The pink mist about the lower
portion of the sky was tinged with saffron. And this too had a
hard quality. The pupils of Nunreddin's eyes became fixed, his
brows contracted, he stood rigid, listening intently.</p>

<p>Through the gossiping and quarrelling of the children and
Christians round the cup-board of the wine-house his fine senses,
almost supernaturally acute, could detect the sound of hastening
horses. A cavalcade nearing swiftly&mdash;men riding in haste.
Nunreddin picked up the white cat, returned to the inn and
hastily informed the people of the approaching horsemen. At first
they would not believe him, then they became terrified.</p>

<p>All crowded out into the porch, pushing back the children, and
the men paled. When the sounds were unmistakable they looked at
each other in the greatest uneasiness.</p>

<p>Drums began to beat and a trumpet blared harshly. Men of war!
Perhaps a rebellion had broken out?&mdash;perhaps Don Pedro's
brother, the Duque de Transtamara, was making an effort to snatch
the land from him? In any case, honest, simple people were best
away. The innwoman, her guests and her children rushed out of the
inn by the back-door and ran over the reaped cornfield to the
village.</p>

<p>Nunreddin and the cat went to an upper room. Spying through an
aperture cautiously he saw the cavalcade arriving less hastily.
Great warriors on monstrous warrior steeds with sumpter mules,
baggage-waggons and a spreading retinue...</p>

<p>The foremost rider, a gigantic man, bestrode a huge steed,
caparisoned in purple. This animal, drawn up sharply, caracoled
before the inn door with trained, magnificent movements. The
trappings flying out, showed the royal arms of Castile, the rider
was Don Pedro armed in chain mail beneath the scarlet caftan.
Many weapons were in his sash and round his neck hung some of the
dyed pearls stolen from the murdered Abu-Sa'ad.</p>

<p>Nunreddin thought instantly: "He has been driven from Seville,
he would not be here save on a desperate occasion."</p>

<p>The Castilian knights, grooms and pages clustered thick around
the King who roared out "for someone to loosen his armour!"</p>

<p>Nunreddin withdrew from the window and looked round the room.
It was dark and dirty, insects crawled over the filthy cracked
plaster of the walls, straw and a few rags formed a bed in one
corner. Across this was cast a monk's thick, filthy habit.</p>

<p>Nunreddin put off his turban and slipped the greasy brown over
his light silk tunic. The cowl came well down over his face
allowing only the tip of his beard to be seen.</p>

<p>On the wall was a small wooden crucifix. He hastily took this
and laced it on the scarlet thread round his neck in place of the
blue amulet which he concealed in his purse.</p>

<p>The King's horse continued his impatient capriole before the
door of the building.</p>

<p>Don Pedro's face was suffused with rage because there was slow
answer to his angry summons. The road was blocked with knights
and squires, pages and baggage-waggons had come to a sudden halt.
There could be no doubt that this was a flight, thought
Nunreddin, and, pulling the cowl well over his eyes, he went
downstairs. His movements were soft and easy as that of the white
cat which followed him. Startled to see the sudden figure of a
monk in the doorway Don Pedro ceased his blasphemies.</p>

<p>"There is no one in the inn, sire," said Nunreddin, bowing
low.</p>

<p>"You know me?"</p>

<p>"Everyone knows Your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Not everyone, it appears," replied Don Pedro, with a
sarcastic grin. "There are, it seems, since this morning two
Kings. My bastard brother, monk, has thrown himself into
Seville."</p>

<p>"May God curse him and the Devil harry him!" said Nunreddin,
making the sign of the Cross on his bosom.</p>

<p>Don Pedro's black eyes flashed with pleasure. He swung in his
saddle to shout out to his knights that the holy man had cursed
Don Enriquez.</p>

<p>"The baseborn and the usurper must ever be cursed," added
Nunreddin with emphasis. "Warriors will spring out of the very
ground for the assistance of your knightly grace."</p>

<p>Don Pedro grinned more emphatically.</p>

<p>"Well," he admitted, "it is true that I already have had some
luck. I got good warning of this villain's attempt and was able
to bring off some of my men and treasures."</p>

<p>"A King so wise, clever and prudent must surely have been
betrayed into disaster?" suggested Nunreddin.</p>

<p>Don Pedro swore foully.</p>

<p>"Betrayed," he stuttered, foam flecking his wide lips, "'twas
that lousy knave, that cursed blackguard, Don Gomez Carillo my
Lord High Chamberlain betrayed me. While I was spoiling the
cursed heathen dogs he, on an arranged signal, let in the bastard
and his men."</p>

<p>The King lifted up his hand, massive in a great war-glove
which glittered against the fiery pink of the sky. He
swore&mdash;"I will get him and," he swore, "treat Gomez Carillo
as I treated Abu-Sa'ad."</p>

<p>Then Don Pedro regarded the tall, impressive monk with awe.
Behind him the Castilian knights gesticulated and chattered
together in their harsh language.</p>

<p>Nunreddin, peering under his cowl, espied a woman among the
cortège of nobles, bachelors, squires and men-at-arms. This
shameless one could be no other than Donna Maria de Padilla, for
she rode astride like a man, wore silk trousers and knee-boots of
leather, a turban with fringed ends, and carried a great cased
knife in her belt.</p>

<p>So did she, who had yesterday peeped so shyly behind the
lattice at the doomed Moors, flaunt herself, without
discomposure, thus publicly in masculine attire.</p>

<p>She edged her fine Arabian jennet to the King's side and asked
him anxiously "why he delayed?"</p>

<p>She had none of the beauty, the ardency, the gaiety of youth.
This woman, for whom Don Pedro of Castile had murdered one wife
and put aside another, was thin and tawny. Her eyes were
monstrous and further enlarged by paint beneath and on the lids.
She had a fierce, anxious air and was full of restless
movements.</p>

<p>"A delay," said Don Pedro of Castile sullenly, "because I do
not know the safest road and few seem to guide me."</p>

<p>Nunreddin stepped nearer the King's purple trappings. "Where,
O King! do you wish to go?"</p>

<p>"Along a difficult route, monk," frowned the monarch. "I
intend to go to Burgos, then perhaps to Bordeaux to ask help of
the English Prince who is always ready to assist in a feat of
arms."</p>

<p>"The first stage would be Cordova," said Nunreddin placidly.
"I am quite able to guide you there." He added, "I was probably
sent by heaven to do so. Sire, is not to-day the day of your
patron saint, Santa Porphria?"</p>

<p>The King startled, his dark face all aflush.</p>

<p>But Maria de Padilla leant forward across the horns of her
gilded saddle.</p>

<p>"I am a hermit," continued Nunreddin composedly.</p>

<p>"I was meditating among the cork trees yesterday when an angel
appeared to me, and told me I was to be the instrument of good
fortune to a mighty king. He bade me go to a certain grove and
search beneath a certain tree, the seventh from the crest of a
hill. There, he said, I should find a relic of Santa
Porphria&mdash;I discovered this." Nunreddin scrabbled in his
satchel. At the bottom of this lay the two small smooth bones.
One had been polished and was in the shape of a small reed-pipe,
the other was a knuckle end. "This, the Vision declared to me,"
added Nunreddin, holding out the latter, "is a bone of the holy
Porphria's right hand."</p>

<p>He held it up, small and white in the dusky pinkish light. The
King bowed his head in awe. The Castilian knights crossed
themselves and began to chatter joyfully. Many of them had been
on the point of turning back, fearful that they had taken the
wrong side in this venture. Now they were reassured that God was
indeed with Don Pedro.</p>

<p>"The Vision bade me," continued Nunreddin, "come to the inn.
He said that your princely grace would arrive here at about the
hour of this sunset. Did not this angel speak truth, Sire?"</p>

<p>Again Nunreddin fumbled in his satchel.</p>

<p>"I have another sign to give your princely grace. The holy
Vision told me that you searched for something you could not
find."</p>

<p>Don Pedro trembled in his saddle.</p>

<p>Maria de Padilla glanced quickly behind her at the expectant
faces of the knights, crowding as close as their great war-horses
could bring them.</p>

<p>"Among the bodies of foul heathen dogs," continued Nunreddin,
"your princely grace was searching for a jewel that had taken
your pleasure. This the angel put into my charge."</p>

<p>He brought out the diamond with the purple stain. The King
flung himself from his horse and was on his knees in the dust,
almost prostrate before the monk.</p>

<p>There was a clattering, a shouting, a calling up of pages, a
rearing of impatient steeds, and all the Castilian knights were
soon grovelling before the relic and the miracle.</p>

<p>Nunreddin suddenly recollected that he should have been
barefoot. He had not had time to pull off his leather
ankle-boots. He withdrew his feet under the hem of his robe,
fearful that Don Pedro should observe them.</p>

<p>But that monarch, in a religious ecstasy, had no eyes for such
a detail.</p>

<p>He flung himself flat on the road, his face in the dust, dirt
on his lips and breast, his armour and his caftan disfigured and
defiled by the refuse of the road.</p>

<p>Murmuring prayers to Santa Porphria, he worshipped the
relic.</p>

<p>But Donna Maria de Padilla remained on her horse, disdainful
of the prostration of all the men. Then Nunreddin fixed her with
a glittering eye from under his hood and she at once flung her
reins to a page, reluctantly dismounted and knelt in the
dust.</p>

<p>For a moment the Oriental enjoyed this spectacle&mdash;the
groaning Christians beating their breasts, awkwardly prostrate
and kneeling in their armour, the dry, odd, barren country about
them in the lurid, pinkish, fiery light.</p>

<p>Over-ripe and withered grapes dropped from the pergola in
front of the pot-house. The fowls clucked near by. This sound
could scarcely be distinguished from the mutterings and squeaks
of the Christians at prayer.</p>

<p>Behind them rose the Crucifix at the roadside. It had a remote
air of symbolizing something very different and very far from
this scene.</p>

<p>Nunreddin smiled.</p>

<p>"Rise, O King! Rise, O knights!" he commanded reverently.</p>

<p>When Don Pedro was in his seat again, wiping the sweat and
dirt from his broad dark face, Nunreddin handed him the jewel and
the relic with great awe and dignity&mdash;both of these the King
kissed convulsively and thrust into his bosom.</p>

<p>"Let your pavilions be set up here to-night, O King!" said
Nunreddin, "and to-morrow I will guide you stage by stage, even
to Burgos."</p>

<p>The King gave his commands.</p>

<p>In the field beyond the Crucifix were arranged the pavilions
of blue silk with scalloped edges raised on gilded poles,
surmounted by the banners of Castile. Tables, stools,
cooking-pots and cushions were hastily dragged from the
baggage-waggons, many of which were laden with yesterday's
pillage from the Moors.</p>

<p>Braziers of charcoal were lit, on which aromatic herbs were
scattered, to keep off the flights of insects which rose with the
setting of the sun.</p>

<p>Don Pedro did not concern himself with the thought of any
possible pursuit. He now believed that he was under Divine
protection. He sat at his ease in his pavilion.</p>

<p>The entrance was looped back and over it hung a fine gauze to
keep out the flies and gnats.</p>

<p>Maria de Padilla, tawny and lean as a half-famished young
lioness, lay stretched over the cushions with her fingers in a
bowl of pure water. She was frowning and sullen.</p>

<p>It appeared that this man, to whom she had attached her
fortunes, had lost the splendour and the power that made him
desirable. She had not been reassured by the miracle.</p>

<p>"That monk," she remarked, "has much the appearance of the
magician who came with the King of Granada but yesterday."</p>

<p>Don Pedro smiled. He felt quite gay and safe. Like a rosy
mantle the protection of his patron saint encompassed him.</p>

<p>"The Devil," he said, "plays these tricks with our eyes."</p>

<p>In high good humour he sent for Nunreddin.</p>

<p>The Oriental had contrived, during the confusion of the
camping, to slip away and improve his disguise; he had entangled
his neat beard and rubbed dry earth on it so that it no longer
shone silver; he had matted his hair with muddied water and
pulled it over his eyes; this coating of filth made him appear
much more like a Christian hermit.</p>

<p>When he lifted the gauze and came into the presence of the
King he found that monarch absorbed in contemplating the relic
and the purple-flushed diamond which lay on a small cushion in
front of him. The moon began to make the landscape appear
metallic and unreal. Even round the fires and the braziers the
flies buzzed incessantly. The flat curve of the river glittered
behind the dry trees.</p>

<p>Nunreddin ventured to push back his cowl and face the King
with a formidable stare; he had a certain power of distorting and
changing his features and he exercised this impressively.</p>

<p>Maria de Padilla looked at him sharply and continued to dabble
her fingers in the bowl of cool scented water, then to draw them
over her parched lips and hot brow.</p>

<p>The King, huge and gross, sat motionless. His silk caftan was
open on his bare, glistening chest. He had flung off his helm,
turban and coronet, and his black hair was curled upwards like a
sweeping crest.</p>

<p>He said to the woman contemptuously:</p>

<p>"What foolish, drivelling talk is this?&mdash;saying that the
holy man had a look of the foul magician of yesterday! In
everything he is different."</p>

<p>"There was a white cat in the castle at Seville," remarked
Maria de Padilla, and she eyed the small animal which crept in
behind Nunreddin.</p>

<p>"Bah, there are white cats in many places," scowled Don
Pedro.</p>

<p>Nunreddin added coldly:</p>

<p>"But this beast, Donna, was guarding the spot where I found
the relic of Santa Porphria."</p>

<p>The moonlight filtered through the swaying gauze against which
the insects buzzed in vain clouds, and it shone on the filthy
brown habit, the tangled hair and beard and inscrutable face
which seemed sculptured out of yellow soap stone.</p>

<p>Outside was the sound of grasshoppers and frogs in the region
of the river, and the cook-men going about with their clanking
pots, the sharp complaint of horses stung by gnats, and the
monotonous rustle of dry leaves.</p>

<p>The King began to question Nunreddin as to the portents for
the future.</p>

<p>He confided to him his hatred for his three brothers&mdash;Don
Enriquez, Duque de Transtamara, Don Sancho and Don Tello. Would
that he had slain them with the other six! These three bastards
who had thrust him from his kingdom! Was it not possible to lay
on them some malediction which would wither them at the very
root?</p>

<p>Nunreddin preserved that inscrutable air so necessary to wise
men and prophets; he threw himself along the line of the King's
humour.</p>

<p>"It is best for the present that your princely grace pursued
your journey. At Burgos you will surely find help," he declared
solemnly. "In great triumph you will return to Castile. You will
capture these three ruffians and be able to dismember their
bodies as you dismembered those of the Moors last night."</p>

<p>"How does he know that?" cried Maria de Padilla
suspiciously.</p>

<p>But the King was not troubled. His was of an unquestioning
faith. He silenced the woman with a brutal look. He was convinced
that the monk was possessed of supernatural powers. The crystal
with the purple flush, miraculously carried through the air by
angels from the castle of Seville to the forest on the banks of
the Guadalquiver, had sufficiently proved that.</p>

<p>"Sire, I will play a hymn to Santa Porphria," said Nunreddin.
He drew the other bone out of his satchel and put it to his
lips.</p>

<p>A shrill yet plaintive whistle filled the tent.</p>

<p>The King and the woman were silent under the incantation of
the melody which took up the song of the grasshoppers and the
frogs and the buzz of the flies. Nunreddin's twinkling eyes held
Don Pedro by a hypnotic stare.</p>

<p>The King's head began to droop on to his mighty chest. Maria
de Padilla's painted lips fell wearily. Beyond the tents the
night stretched in a vivid, interminable monotone of heat and
moonlight; it appeared as if the sun would never rise again.
Nunreddin continued to play on the small white bone. He eyed the
other bone placed before the King&mdash;the sacred relic set
beside the heathen stone. Both these bones had come from the same
hare. Nunreddin felt that the animal thus revenged itself on
those who had destroyed its beautiful body. The King's head
nodded, his body bent, the saliva dripped from his thick lips on
to his chest. The woman turned over and lay slack. The Oriental
put away his small bone pipe and gathered up the white cat into
his bosom; at this the soft creature thrust its face close to
his, the doctor thought that those green eyes looked as if they
knew a great deal about most things. Don Pedro and Donna Maria de
Padilla slept.</p>

<p>With impressive majesty Nunreddin stepped out of the silk
pavilion into the silver heat of the stifling night.</p>

<p><br>
IN the lilac haze of morning, pursued by glittering clouds of
ants, the Castilians resumed their march.</p>

<p>The short column made its way over the undulating ground in
uneven files&mdash;now halting, now separating, now closing up.
Heavy fringed standards dipped, sunk and were hoisted high.</p>

<p>The King, though still believing himself under divine
protection, had discovered some uneasiness when it was put to him
by his most trusted friend, Don Juan de Castro, that the
mysterious monk might be misled or false.</p>

<p>Don Pedro did not believe this. The miracle of the crystal and
the relic were sufficient for him, but he was impressed when the
anxious knight urged on him the length and toilsomeness of the
road to Aquitaine.</p>

<p>De Castro suggested that they should halt at Burgos and
endeavour to gather an army there with which to return and fall
upon Seville and the usurping Don Enriquez.</p>

<p>Don Pedro had not much faith in this course. He eyed the hazed
landscape sullenly. He knew well enough how he was hated in his
own kingdom. He feared also that both His Holiness the Pope and
the King of France might be on the side of his brother who was a
noble, generous knight unstained by any great crime.</p>

<p>His wish was still to push on to the Prince of Aquitaine, that
great victor and hero of Poictiers and Crécy, eldest son of the
King of England.</p>

<p>De Castro looked askance at his master.</p>

<p>"If we had enough money we might engage the Free Companies,"
he suggested, and he added that a halt at Burgos might result in
amassing sufficient treasure from the people to buy the services
of these famous mercenaries, who were without occupation since
the last war.</p>

<p>"I shall be overbid by the ruffian bastard or the King of
France," said Don Pedro, who was shrewd enough in matters of
policy, and he added with bitter disdain, "that foul hypocrite
Enriquez will get on the right side of the Pope." He scowled and
pouted out his full lips as he added fiercely:</p>

<p>"The Pope is not everything. I do not need him when I have a
holy hermit direct from heaven."</p>

<p>"More dangerous than the Pope is the King of France."</p>

<p>"He is a boy and a fool," replied Don Pedro contemptuously,
flicking the flies from his horse's flank.</p>

<p>"He has good advisers," said De Castro.</p>

<p>"He has been defeated in a long war," persisted the King.</p>

<p>But the Castilian knight replied:</p>

<p>"He is still powerful. He too might engage the Free
Companies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he did," interrupted Pedro, "and could find the money, who
has he to command them?"</p>

<p>The Castilian knight replied with the name of the most famous
captain in the world after the Prince of Aquitaine, "Bertrand du
Guesclin."</p>

<p>But Pedro reminded him that Bertrand du Guesclin was in
prison, having been captured by Sir John Chandos some time since
in the Britanny affair, "And such a ransom is asked that no one
is likely to be able to pay it, your mind is full of moody
fancies this morning, Don Juan. I fear neither the Free
Companies, the Pope, the King of France, nor Du Guesclin, and I
am undecided whether I shall halt at Burgos and summon my array,
or whether I shall go on to Bordeaux and put my cause before the
English Prince."</p>

<p>Wishing for no more advice or discussion the King rode ahead,
taking command of this small column, straggling through the
increasing heat, which was all that was left to him of a powerful
kingdom.</p>

<p>Maria de Padilla drooped in her saddle. She held one end of
her light silk turban across her face to shield her from the
heat. She stared at the broad back of Don Pedro riding ahead of
her; she hated him as a man who had failed.</p>

<p>Nunreddin rode comfortably in one of the baggage-waggons, the
white cat asleep on his knees. He was eating from a basket of
ripe figs and kept his cowl pulled over his eyes to protect them
from the dust of the road.</p>

<p>At the first halt the King hastily sent for him and moodily
asked his advice as to whether they should halt at Burgos or push
forward into Aquitaine?</p>

<p>The Oriental cared nothing for Don Pedro's plans. He thought
that it would suit him, Nunreddin, very well to spend the winter
in Burgos, where there were many learned men, good libraries and
fellow-countrymen who would allow him to sink into obscurity as
an eel into a mud-stream. Yet he thought it would be amusing to
accompany this march for weeks and months across Spain and France
to the city of Bordeaux which he had never yet seen, and into the
presence of the English knight, <i>The English Paragon</i> as he
was called, whom the Oriental was also curious to behold.</p>

<p>He said therefore that he must wait until his Vision further
instructed him as to the proper course to pursue, but that, for
the moment, it would undoubtedly be better to halt in Burgos and
see which way fortune went.</p>

<p>"There is the King of Aragon, that flaunting young fool,"
mused Don Pedro, stroking his chin dubiously.</p>

<p>"He will join the bastard because I took those marsh lands
from him."</p>

<p>"Count up these chances when you are in Burgos, O King!"
advised Nunreddin.</p>

<p>The King ordered his standard to advance. A great bitterness
overwhelmed him. It was intolerable that the bastard son of
Eleanora de Guzman should thus be able to drive him ignominiously
from his kingdom; he was glad that he had murdered that
intolerable woman.</p>

<p>Other things were fortunate too, the King of France was only a
boy&mdash;his country ruined by a long war, the Pope had been
driven from Rome and must live at Avignon, Du Guesclin was a
prisoner and not likely to be ransomed. And, highest fortune of
all, he, Pedro of Castile, carried in his bosom a holy relic
miraculously revealed.</p>

<p>The short straggling column, the men soon exhausted by the
heat and the weight of their armour, moved forward through the
thick lilac haze which appeared hard as the baked ground from
which it rose. Trails of sparkling gnats and glittering insects
hung like scarves round the banners and about the horses' heads
and haunches whose swishing tails were in constant motion. Even
the great warrior horses began to droop their heads.</p>

<p>Only Nunreddin and the cat travelled comfortably in the hooded
baggage-waggon, protected from the sun and asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; FLOWERS AT AVIGNON</h2>

<p class="first">HIS Holiness Pope Urban V gave audience to Mons.
de Nolhac, the Ambassador of King Charles V, King of France.</p>

<p>The Pope, who had been a Benedictine monk, observed a very
simple state. The mighty, sumptuous palace of his predecessors
Clement VI and Innocent VI oppressed him. He felt himself an
alien in those mighty apartments, and he had had constructed,
according to his own tastes, a very modest lodging almost like
the monastic cell in which he had lived the life of a simple
monk. Everywhere possible he had ordered windows to be pierced.
He spent most of his time out of doors or walking in open
cloisters or colonnades.</p>

<p>In his poor secluded room he sat silent, his hands folded in
his sleeves, listening to the Frenchman.</p>

<p>On his ascetic, aquiline face with the full drooping lids and
thin lips was a look of serene ambition. He was a man who never
doubted the strength of his own resolves. He was certain that one
day he would return in triumph to Rome. Passion or cupidity were
equally impossible to that composed face. He listened carefully
to what the Ambassador was saying.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Nolhac was a small, dry, elderly man. His full
robe with wide sleeves girdled round the waist and long-ended
coif gave him a feminine appearance</p>

<p>"It would be well worth Your Holiness's while to ransom Du
Guesclin from the English Prince," he concluded in a tired
voice.</p>

<p>"How much money did you say?" asked the Pope.</p>

<p>The Frenchman named a sum which caused the Pope to smile.</p>

<p>"Is any man worth so much? That amount has been fixed in
fantasy... A hundred thousand francs!"</p>

<p>De Nolhac declared that the great captain was worth that and
more, and that if the Prince of Aquitaine had not allowed his
chivalry to override his prudence, he would not have permitted
him to go even for that immense treasure...</p>

<p>"But when this great sum is paid," asked the Pope, "the
captain released, what will you do with him?"</p>

<p>"Put him at the head of the Free Companies," replied the
Frenchman, "and send him to assist Don Enriquez, the present King
of Castile, against his presumptuous and cruel brother Don Pedro,
who is now at Burgos gathering a host."</p>

<p>"Yet it is unnatural and a bad precedent," replied the Pope
calmly, "for a bastard to occupy a throne. It is true that I
daily receive complaints of this Don Pedro and that he has
refused to obey the commands of the Church, vexing the priests
with tyranny, thieving their revenues, and even receiving my
envoys with insult. But we must consider that he is the
legitimate King of Castile."</p>

<p>The Ambassador patiently went over the crimes of Don
Pedro.</p>

<p>"He murdered Eleanora de Guzman, his father's mistress. He
murdered Blanche of France, his first wife. He is allying himself
with heathen kings, such as the King of Granada, of Benamarine
and Tremeçon. In brief, there are many odious crimes laid to his
charge."</p>

<p>"No doubt," admitted Urban, "the man is a beast and a villain,
but we must consider how we assist his brother and embroil Europe
for a bastard. Tell me, sir, what is the King of France's count
in this?"</p>

<p>"He wishes," replied the Ambassador, "to regain the Provinces
of Guienne and Gascony."</p>

<p>"But those," the Pope said gently, "were ceded to England by
the Peace of Bretigny."</p>

<p>"But the King, my master, was a child at the time. He need not
ratify a Treaty which his father made under duress and in
despair. Aquitaine is a French Province. It is most unjust that
the English should hold it. People murmur under the rule of this
Prince Edward. The King of France will pay half the ransom of
Bernard du Guesclin."</p>

<p>The Pope's eyes sparkled at the thought of this possible
deliverance for his beloved France. But there were many
hindrances and difficulties in the way. His position was more
delicate than that of any statesman in Europe. He must go
cautiously.</p>

<p>"The King of Aragon," urged the French Ambassador, "is a young
ardent knight&mdash;he will also fall upon Pedro with the least
encouragement."</p>

<p>Urban pondered the case.</p>

<p>"What manner of precedent shall I give if I depose a lawful
king and set a bastard in his place?"</p>

<p>De Nolhac urged the crimes, the low villainies and
beastlinesses of Don Pedro, who lived in Burgos like a swine in
its stye, and he had that cursed, shameless woman with him, Maria
de Padilla.</p>

<p>"Do not despise my master because he is a youth," added the
Ambassador earnestly. "King Charles is no boaster, ruffler or
villain. He prefers study to the camp. His leisure goes in
brooding over manuscripts or in consultation with the astrologer
Thomas of Pisa who is full of curious learning. No foul words or
lewd tales are allowed at his Court. None dare indulge in
wantonness or gambling."</p>

<p>The Pope's comment on this panegyric was, with a slight
inflection of contempt:</p>

<p>"A humble, simple scholar like myself."</p>

<p>"But like Your Holiness," replied the Ambassador quickly,
"this same modest scholar is a clever statesman and an able
administrator, and," added De Nolhac with emphasis, "above all,
he longs to rid France of the Free Companies&mdash;those plagues
of the Devil."</p>

<p>The Pope did not move, but his eyes flashed. The last sentence
had touched him on a tender point. More than any king or
potentate in Europe, more even than the Turk (whom the King of
Hungary was combating in the East) did Urban loathe and dread the
Free Companies&mdash;those bands of lawless mercenaries, who
obeyed no king or priest, who were only faithful to their own
self-chosen captains&mdash;who lived by plunder and pillage, who
left desolation in their wake and spread terror before
them&mdash;who had, since the Peace, settled on France like the
locusts on Egypt, and whom no man could sway, overawe or
disperse.</p>

<p>"Such is the child of war," muttered the Pope, "brutish,
incendious, certainly of the Devil. The foulest spawn of the
foulest ambitions of mankind. How are law or learning, order or
beauty, to survive while such treat the earth as if it were their
heritage, to be trampled underfoot or torn to pieces?"</p>

<p>"Would it not," put in the Ambassador eagerly, "be a good
stroke to ransom Du Guesclin, place him at the head of these
ruffians and send them into Spain to assist Don Enriquez to keep
the throne of Castile?"</p>

<p>"But that will not occupy them for ever," smiled Urban, "and
what shall we do with them when we have succeeded or
failed&mdash;they must be disbanded again."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said the Ambassador dryly, "but they can be
disbanded in Spain&mdash;not in France. If they fight for Don
Enriquez, he will have to pay them. If he does not pay them, they
will ravage his kingdom. If he does, possibly they may be induced
to join the King of Hungary."</p>

<p>"If I support France," mused the Pope, "I shall make an enemy
of England. I have heard that Don Pedro is likely to appeal for
help to the Prince in Aquitaine."</p>

<p>"By denouncing Don Pedro for his crimes, Your Holiness will
not be defying England," suggested the French Ambassador
smoothly.</p>

<p>"But by helping to pay the ransom of Du Guesclin I certainly
shall," smiled Urban.</p>

<p>Still, he admitted to himself that the plan had its
advantages. The studious, shrewd, careful young King of France,
Charles de Valois, appealed to him a great deal more than the old
fighting warrior king of England and his warlike son, who had no
thought of anything but these battles and that military glory
which were, in the eyes of the Pope, so contemptible.</p>

<p>"Beasts!" he said to himself, "Beasts! all fighting,
snarling&mdash;and this Don Pedro no worse than the
others&mdash;none of them able to see beyond the chance medley of
a fight or able to value anything save a plumed crest, gilded
armour, or a silk rag on a pole. But, this youth in France
now..." He broke off his thoughts to ask the Ambassador
abruptly:</p>

<p>"Did your master, the King, suggest this scheme of getting rid
of the Free Companies into Spain?"</p>

<p>"It was his own thought," replied De Nolhac, with pride. "He
looked further than that. He believed that the Prince of
Aquitaine would be embroiled, and so he might recover his
provinces."</p>

<p>"It is true," reflected the Pope thoughtfully, "that Don Pedro
has treated my envoys with insolence. He sits in Burgos like a
fat, poisonous spider, sucking up the life-blood of the country
round. He has attached to him some false monk who holds him by
devilish arts, vain promises, satanic spells. And yet, Don
Enriquez is a bastard..."</p>

<p>The Pope rose. He appeared a modest, almost a humble figure in
his monastic garb, but he carried himself with an imposing
majesty.</p>

<p>"Come into my garden," he said, with a sudden eagerness. "This
talk becomes strangely tedious. I will show you what really
interests me. When my mind has cleared I will give you my
decision on your politics."</p>

<p>The Pope passed swiftly through a small side-door, screened
only by a light curtain of thin linen. The Frenchman followed
him.</p>

<p>"Here," said His Holiness, "is the abode of bliss, knowledge
and beauty."</p>

<p>His small eager figure hurried down a few steps and he stood
on the first <i>parterres</i> of the great gardens of Avignon.
There were no gardens like them in the whole of the world.</p>

<p>Instead of spending his revenues as his predecessors had on
mighty buildings, sumptuous apartments, gorgeous furniture and
rich vestments, Urban had laid out all his money on gardens.</p>

<p>Everywhere he had let in light and air, piercing the ramparts,
lowering walls and towers, planting woods, orchards, pleasaunces,
<i>allées</i> and terraces with every known species of tree and
flower.</p>

<p>It was April. The delicious softness of the South was in the
faint breeze, in the milky, gauzy clouds that passed lightly over
the tender azure of the sky. The sweetness of acres of bloom hung
in the air.</p>

<p>The Pope had the plan of the gardens accurately in his head.
He could point out with precision where a certain tree grew, or a
certain bed of blooms had been planted. He knew the names of the
different vines, peaches, nectarines and pears.</p>

<p>He declared that when he returned to Rome&mdash;and he spoke
with the utmost confidence&mdash;he would make another such
garden on the hill of the Vatican, thus glorifying the Eternal
City. Among the trees and plants were many gardeners
(indistinguishable at a first glance, but afterwards to be
clearly perceived), kindly men absorbed in the kindly
earth...</p>

<p>The Pope spoke rapidly:</p>

<p>"The true surroundings for a scholar and a poet! Men of
letters are tired of telling the praises of so-called heroes who
are in reality cut-throats. They are weary of fortresses and
ramparts, houses bombarded against enemies. Yes, indeed, refined
and ardent spirits full of idealism must have been always of that
mind."</p>

<p>He mentioned again his scheme for laying out the Vatican
gardens on the model of these at Avignon, or of those of the
great poet&mdash;Petrarca at Vaucluse&mdash;when he was once more
installed in Rome.</p>

<p>"How certain he is of returning!" thought the Ambassador, and
he recalled the tale that the Benedictine had selected the name
of "Urban" as a play on the word "urbanos," meaning that he
intended some day once more to rule in Rome.</p>

<p>The Pope pointed out his new garden, or <i>giriardium
novum</i>, especially reserved for the cultivation of flowers of
rare or tender species. Experiments were made here with different
soils and dressings. He went on to talk of the wood filled with
the most uncommon trees which covered about two thousand square
metres. This joy in the beauties of nature was something new, and
De Nolhac was too old to share in this modern enthusiasm which he
had noticed in his young master Charles V; he also was taking
down frowning walls, grim towers and wide ramparts, the shielding
deep ditches of his castles, and laying out gardens...</p>

<p>"It is," said the Pope, "as if beauty was being lent to the
world to show that we are making a little advance from
barbarism."</p>

<p>"Very little indeed," smiled the Ambassador, true to his
point, "while monsters like Don Pedro are allowed to exist."</p>

<p>The Pope had paused before a bed of violets, sheltered by the
low boughs and long, grey-green leaves of oleanders not yet in
bloom.</p>

<p>The violets were of all hues that mingled red and blue can
make&mdash;rosy pink faintly stained white, and all shades of
lilac and purple to an azure pure as the Southern sky.</p>

<p>The Pope frowned. He did not wish to talk of Don Pedro. But
the Ambassador insisted.</p>

<p>"It is said that he too is a bastard. That his mother, Maria
of Portugal, was unfaithful to her husband with a Jew."</p>

<p>Urban shuddered. He detested these ugly stories. How
impossible, incredible and grotesque seemed all these tumults,
intrigues and brutalities of the world. Yet, how real they were,
but how impossible to escape from them!</p>

<p>"It is really all so simple," he sighed. "If there were but a
few men of sense in the world, these brutal appetites and stupid
ambitions would be controlled. In gardens like this, Mons. de
Nolhac, can be found happiness, beauty and a true communion with
God."</p>

<p>"But the world is full of proud, presumptuous fighting men,"
urged the Frenchman, "like this Don Pedro and his brother Don
Enriquez, the great captain Du Guesclin, Sir John Chandos and his
master the Prince of Aquitaine, and the old King of
England&mdash;men like these would see no beauty in Your
Holiness's garden, they would even trample it under foot, cut
down your trees and tear up your shrubs, as the Free Companies
are demolishing the orchards and trampling the corn throughout
France."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Pope in agitation, still looking down at
his violets, "I must get rid of these beasts. But, do not let us
talk of it now. Look how exquisite all this is&mdash;what order,
what grace, what beauty! Yonder are the vineyards. I have over a
hundred different varieties of vines. Orange and citron grow very
well here, and soon we shall have pomegranate and perhaps the
pepper tree."</p>

<p>There was no menagerie in the Pope's garden. He disliked to
see anything in captivity and loathed the smell of the raw meat
on which the beasts must be fed. But there was a superb aviary
where the birds were lightly restrained behind fine wires and
flew, almost at large, through the fronds of delicate trees.</p>

<p>"This is not <i>of</i> the world, but <i>apart</i> from it,"
thought the Ambassador, and he remembered that at the Pope's very
door were filth and poverty, misery and suffering; the streets of
Avignon were narrow and filthy; diseased people perished
miserably in broken, foul hovels&mdash;hungry, despairing.</p>

<p>The Pope, seemingly quite absorbed in his favourite subject,
continued to talk of gardens, of Petrarca, of his terraces at
Vaucluse and the hill where his friends would gather on an
afternoon, quite exposed to the sun; they sheltered from it under
the boughs of high trees... of the river passing the garden,
always rapid and cool. And of the perpetual glory of sunrise and
sunset, of moon and star-shine, and of the laurel trees (with
their memories of Daphne and Apollo), which Petrarca had
celebrated as half a wind and half a
woman&mdash;<i>l'aura</i>.</p>

<p>He tenderly handled the buds on many delicate plants which
seemed to throb with expanding sweetness.</p>

<p>The April clouds gathered like dense incense around the high
Tower of the Angels which watched over the modest apartments of
the Pope; large as a barrack for an Emperor's army the palaces of
the Vicars of Christ stretched before the mean city.</p>

<p>"Why," asked the Pope, "do so many problems trouble our
conscience and hearts? Are these fantastic and dark events which
we concern ourselves with leading towards any definite goal? Or
do we live in a time when all will soon be extinguished in a
universal decadence?"</p>

<p>He spoke with philosophic calm, but his eyes were ardent.</p>

<p>"It would be quite easy," thought the Ambassador, "for him to
become a hermit or a simple monk again, did he so long to be in
solitude. But he is careful to remain Pope and he is really very
interested in the affairs of Europe. After all these gardens cost
fabulous sums which we poor devils have to provide."</p>

<p>The Pope listened in ecstasy to the cooing of turtledoves the
colour of mother-o'-pearl, as they flew across the milky blue of
the sky. The Ambassador, glancing over the garden which stretched
as far as eye could see to the very banks of the river, said
dryly:</p>

<p>"It is possible that even this may pass away and leave no
trace behind."</p>

<p>"It is possible," replied Urban, "but in Rome I will plant
some trees whose shade and perfume will spread all over
Europe."</p>

<p>The Ambassador endeavoured to lead him back to the point of
his interview. He did this the more eagerly as he felt himself
being overcome by the drowsy, sweet atmosphere of the delicious
pleasaunces. It was certainly difficult in this spot to concern
oneself with hard, brutal matters of fact. But De Nolhac reminded
himself sarcastically that he was not the Pope of Rome that he
could permit himself the luxury of dreaming, that he had to act
for his master, Charles of France, who had a great responsibility
in the shape of a defeated and impoverished kingdom on his slim
young shoulders.</p>

<p>The Ambassador began again to talk of the misdeeds of the Free
Companies. These hideous hordes of armed men who were so
formidable because among themselves their discipline was so
rigid, they were so obedient and faithful to their own officers,
were making deep wounds in the face of France.</p>

<p>"Think of this garden," said De Nolhac, "think of these woods,
terraces and <i>allées</i> that Your Holiness has delighted to
plant&mdash;consider what they would be after the Free Companies
had passed through Avignon!"</p>

<p>A spasm contorted the ascetic face of the Pope. It was all
very distasteful. With crude beasts one must use crude
expedients. He was becoming weary of the Frenchman. He was
finding his company tedious. He longed to get away to talk to his
gardeners and his architects. There were some things best decided
quickly.</p>

<p>"Very well," he conceded, "I will excommunicate Don Pedro of
Castile, and I will pay half the ransom of this ruffian Du
Guesclin on condition that he leads the Free Companies to support
Don Enriquez, and perhaps, if this Prince Edward of Aquitaine
takes up the quarrel, it will be a chance for your master to get
the Provinces back."</p>

<p>The Pope smiled agreeably, patted the Ambassador on the
shoulder and walked away. He knew that the Frenchman would be
quite content to have this dismissal once he had gained his
point.</p>

<p>De Nolhac returned to the large apartment in the deserted
palace of the Pope. A scribe sat ready at a high desk with ink,
reed and parchment. The Ambassador dictated a long letter couched
in careful and ambiguous terms to the King of France.</p>

<p>The day was so sweet with the overpowering sense of Spring
that the Frenchman was scarcely conscious of the walls. The room
seemed, even as he sat dictating his dry, official letter (which
was, however, so important), to be invaded by fields of cyclamen,
of jonquils, of daffodils, of violets and primroses, strawberry
blooms and apple-blossom&mdash;all of an individual fragrance,
blending into an indescribable perfume of delight.</p>

<p>Through these enchanted beds of fragrance he could see the
little figure of the Pope in his modest Benedictine habit, moving
cautiously as if he did not wish to disturb the scented breath of
the flowers, talking to his busy, silent gardeners, who had keen,
close-gazing eyes and earth-stained hands.</p>

<p>He should not have been thinking of such trifles for he had
completed a bold stroke of policy.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for Don Pedro, however audacious and
insulting that bad King was, to affront the bolt of
excommunication. All, except his most villainous supporters,
would fall away from him. If he had the impudence to remain in
Burgos he would be soon ousted by Bertrand du Guesclin and the
terrible Free Companies.</p>

<p>The Ambassador wondered who was going to pay these
mercenaries. Nothing had been said about that. The Pope had
promised half the ransom of Du Guesclin, and that was an immense
fortune. It would be as much as Charles V could do to find the
other half.</p>

<p>If Don Enriquez could not pay or would not pay these ruffians,
they must be kept quiet as long as possible with pillage, booty
and promises... After all, it did not very much matter what
happened to them in the end. It would be a good stroke of policy
to get them out of France.</p>

<p>The Ambassador rubbed his thin hands together. Men like
himself, the Pope and the young King of France were the real
rulers of the world. They always got the better of men of
violence, of passion and uncontrolled lusts, even the dreaded
mercenaries were but their instruments. Du Guesclin himself would
do their dirty work for them.</p>

<p>And as for that Edward of Aquitaine, whose head was full of
romance and stupid tales of the past, who considered himself a
King Arthur or a Charlemagne, King Horn, or a Sir
Lancelot&mdash;he, too, this English paragon, was a mere man of
action, exulting in and boasting of the deeds of his body. A good
fighter, no doubt, but he might be beguiled (as easily as Pedro
of Castile) into defeat and ruin... The English Prince held
Aquitaine in feoff for his father, the conquering King of
England. Charles de Valois had set his heart on winning it
back.</p>

<p>The final ratifications of the Treaty of Bretigny had never
been exchanged, and the young King of France was prepared at the
right moment to deny the Treaty and summon the lost Provinces
back to their allegiance.</p>

<p>"They would return, of course, very willingly," thought the
Ambassador, for in Guienne, Gascony and Aquitaine they hated the
foreigner forced on them by a disastrous war.</p>

<p>When the Ambassador had finished his letter and directed a
knight and two squires to take it to Paris he went out again into
the pleasaunces of Avignon.</p>

<p>In spite of the care of the gardeners a spider had contrived
to spin a web between the heads of four heavy-budded pinks.</p>

<p>Faintly buzzing in these silken strands were two flies,
gleaming metallic blue and bronze, like knights in
finely-polished black armour. De Nolhac, observing them, named
them Pedro of Castile and Edward of England. There was a pleasant
look on his face. He enjoyed the spectacle of the vain struggles
of the great, stupid, glittering insects.</p>

<p>The spider was far away, in a remote corner of the web. His
attitude was one of complete indifference.</p>

<p>The Ambassador thought he had something of the look of Urban V
in his plain monastic robe, or even of his young master, Charles
de Valois in his humble student's garb, sitting demurely over his
books, or in consultation with his astrologer.</p>

<p>Neither the old Pope nor the young King made any pomp or
parade, but like the spider, they knew quite well how to spin
exquisite webs.</p>

<p>The Ambassador passed on, murmuring a few verses of Petrarca
as a courtly salutation to the extreme beauty of the scene.
Indeed the gardens were marvellous.</p>

<p>The Frenchman felt soothed, almost happy.</p>

<p>In the distance he could see the Pope down on his knees in the
finely-raked earth, peering with tender joy at the first blue
blossoms of a plant which had never been known before to flower
in Avignon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE FREE COMPANIES</h2>

<p class="first">BERTRAND DU GUESCLIN brought the Free Companies
to Avignon to receive the blessing of His Holiness the Pope.</p>

<p>This, as the French leader pointed out, could not justly be
withheld, for they were undertaking an expedition against an
excommunicated King and might be termed Crusaders embarking on a
Holy War.</p>

<p>The Papal Legate had in vain represented to Du Guesclin that
this delay was quite unnecessary and it would be far better for
him to advance straight into Aragon, where the young King was
waiting to welcome him. But Du Guesclin had listened to nothing
of this, instead he had swept his hordes up to the very gates of
the Papal palace.</p>

<p>This famous captain, who had been a prisoner since the
skirmish at Auray, had been delighted to obtain his liberty and
flattered at the high price paid for him by the Pope and the King
of France. He was perfectly ready to fight for them in any cause
they chose to uphold. He had had no difficulty in gathering
together the Free Companies.</p>

<p>All the noted mercenaries, except Hawkwood, had answered his
summons. It was a huge command that Du Guesclin halted outside
the walls of Avignon.</p>

<p>These Free Companies were the result of the long wars with
France. Hard pressed for men the King of England had made
contracts whereby various gentry of means agreed to furnish him
with a certain number of men-at-arms at fixed pay for a definite
period; when the peace came these same contractors were quite
willing to sell the services of their highly efficient troops to
anyone who cared to pay the price, even to the previous
opponents, but when they found no bidders they lived by pillage.
Their organization was of extraordinary efficiency. Various
troops or regiments were under the command of noted captains like
Sir Hugh Calverley, Sir Walter Felton and Sir Matthew
Gourney.</p>

<p>They consisted of every type of fighting man&mdash;heavy
cavalry, or knights who were attended by squires, sergeants and
serving men, mounted on Spanish steeds (the only chargers capable
of carrying a knight in complete armour and war equipment), and
the light cavalry who wore sleeveless coats of chain mail and
carried lances; there were also hobelars mounted on small cobs
and equipped with heavy padded doublets, iron helmets and swords.
The infantry was the best in the world&mdash;Welsh spearmen and
archers, in simple tunics and mantles, armed only with an iron
cap and carrying a spear, the famous English archers carried
six-feet bows and iron arrows. All these were well fed, equipped,
and their arms in the finest possible condition. Though they
lived by rapine, robbery and murder they were completely obedient
to their officers.</p>

<p>From the window of his palace Pope Urban V watched parties of
the Free Companies foraging the country. Their encampment
stretched for acres. Their defilements for miles. The Pope
trembled with rage.</p>

<p>He sent a priest to Du Guesclin.</p>

<p>"Tell that villain that unless he goes on the march
immediately I will not give him my blessing."</p>

<p>The priest softened the message which Du Guesclin received
quite good-humouredly.</p>

<p>He said, however, that it was impossible for him to remove his
troops at once. They must have rest and diversion and he wished
to pass them under review.</p>

<p>"He would endeavour," he added, "to restrain the pillaging as
much as possible. But," he pointed out, "as the mercenaries have
not as yet received any pay they are forced to live on whatever
country they chance to be passing through."</p>

<p>The French Ambassador, still nervously anxious for the success
of his policy and the schemes of his master, ventured to urge
upon His Holiness that he should ask the great Captain to
supper.</p>

<p>With a grimace of distaste the Pope acquiesced.</p>

<p>"If may be an opportunity to urge him to depart
immediately."</p>

<p>The Pope made such preparations as he believed would please a
man of the world. One of the disused apartments of the palace was
opened. The tapestries were brushed. A service of silver was set
out on the great cup-board, the long table was polished and
arrayed with clean linen. The cook, long used to preparing simple
dishes for His Holiness, was bid put some extravagance into the
supper. Wine was fetched from cellars where it had long lain in
store.</p>

<p>Surrounded by priests the Pope received Du Guesclin surrounded
by men-at-arms.</p>

<p>It was a June night of flaming blue, moonless, the stars
sparkling with a thousand colours. The famous gardens were at
their climax of loveliness.</p>

<p>"A nightingale should be singing," said the Pope, "but these
ruffians have frightened away my birds."</p>

<p>He received Du Guesclin with subtle courtesy. Then forgot his
prejudiced dislike of the man, in sheer curiosity.</p>

<p>To the elderly, refined, philosophic scholar the French
soldier was indeed of extraordinary interest. He named him, when
he gave him his ring to kiss, "an odd beast."</p>

<p>As Captain and man-at-arms Bertrand du Guesclin had no rival
in the world, save possibly the two Edwards of England, and this
some disputed.</p>

<p>He was an enormous man of a height and bulk that appeared
supernatural. Stout as were his slightly bowed legs, the enormous
sweep of his shoulders and the huge arch of his chest seemed to
overweigh them. In comparison his head was small and compact. His
hair was shaven close and his features were flat as those of a
frog, the bridge of his nose seemed broken. His eyes were very
far apart, clear and yellowish. His mouth appeared gashed from
ear to ear. His lips were the same healthy pallor as his cheeks.
His whole countenance was sprinkled with large freckles.</p>

<p>"A frog," thought the Pope, fascinated, "yes, it is indeed a
frog of which his face reminds me. His body is that of an
ogre."</p>

<p>The great Captain's monstrous person was set out with all the
parade of war. He had taken off his steel cap with its coif of
chain-rings. His huge arms and neck were covered with clean
glinting steel. A circlet drawn tightly round his huge body was
embroidered with his arms. A gigantic sword was fastened by stout
leathern thongs to his hip, while over this hard and gleaming
panoply was twisted a scarf of light gold gauze, not the gift of
his wife in Brittany.</p>

<p>He looked at the Pope without ill-will and sat himself with an
air of good-fellowship at the board.</p>

<p>The Pope asked him jestingly why he came fully armed to a
peaceful meal?</p>

<p>"I became weak and lazy," answered Du Guesclin simply, "when I
was in prison and now must train myself to bear my armour again.
Unless one can become unconscious of it, it is felt an
encumbrance. Perhaps," he added, "Your Holiness feels like that
about your robes of office? That is why you always go simply
attired?"</p>

<p>His yellow eyes sparkled with an expression which caused the
Pope to think: "He is no beast after all, but a man of courage,
capacity and intelligence. How can he put himself at the head of
those murdering hordes and fight in a quarrel that's nothing to
do with him?"</p>

<p>But aloud he asked curiously:</p>

<p>"Do you never weary of war, Sire du Guesclin?"</p>

<p>The soldier replied:</p>

<p>"'Tis my way of life. It's as natural for me to be a soldier
as for you to be a priest. If there were no quarrels in the world
there would be no sin and no reason for you to pray to God."</p>

<p>He took off his heavy steel gloves, gave them to his page and
began to eat with vivacity.</p>

<p>The Pope crumbled up a portion of maize bread by his
plate.</p>

<p>"Besides," added Du Guesclin, "I go to fight against the man
whom Your Holiness has excommunicated. Also this Don Pedro is a
false knight, a murderer and a villain."</p>

<p>"So, you make your distinctions?" remarked the Pope dryly. "I
should have thought you had murderers and villains in your
command."</p>

<p>"Maybe," replied the Captain cheerfully, "but those are not
knights or gentlemen, merely the common soldiers who must have a
little life now and then."</p>

<p>"I hope you will be able to leave Avignon tomorrow, Sire du
Guesclin?"</p>

<p>The soldier shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, nor the day after. I must beg the indulgence of Your
Holiness, I am expecting reinforcements. I hope that Sir John
Hawkwood will join and other knights who have come from Prince
Edward's Court at Bordeaux."</p>

<p>The Pope's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"The English Prince then is favouring this expedition?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose," replied Du Guesclin, with his mouth full of
food, "that he wishes to keep on good terms with the King of
France. He doesn't want troubles fermented in Aquitaine, which is
a difficult enough place to rule anyhow, so he's willing to
oblige King Charles by allowing some of his knights to ride with
me."</p>

<p>"Appoint another rendezvous for them," said the Pope with some
sternness. "I do not wish you to delay any longer in
Avignon."</p>

<p>With his knife suspended above his meat, Du Guesclin paused
thoughtfully. He could not see why he should oblige the Pope. It
was no part of his business to oblige anyone. If he listened to
this sort of complaint he would never be able to halt the Free
Companies anywhere. He knew quite well they were regarded as a
visitation from Hell. He considered that at the moment his men
were behaving very well, that the Pope was narrow-minded and
ungenerous.</p>

<p>Urban waited for his reply.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin suddenly plunged his knife again into his meat and
began chewing.</p>

<p>"I cannot do it," he said cheerfully. "The men must
remain."</p>

<p>There was a movement of frightened disgust among the priests
and monks gathered round the Papal board, and Urban, who thought
he had forgotten what anger was, felt a thrill of wrath in his
cool veins.</p>

<p>"If you linger here after to-morrow you will go without my
blessing," he announced.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Du Guesclin, thrusting more meat into his mouth,
"we will never move without that, Holy Father."</p>

<p>The Pope's nostrils dilated and his thin lips quivered. The
sight of the gross, massive, powerful, armed man sickened him
with a sense of offence. He was sorry now that he had listened to
De Nolhac's plan which did not seem after all very likely to
prove of service to France.</p>

<p>He was about to answer with bitter dignity, when some of the
Papal servants hurried into the room with but little ceremony.
They left the door open behind them and the faint sounds of a
tumult could be heard without.</p>

<p>The Pope rose in his place.</p>

<p>But Du Guesclin went on feeding. If he had stopped at every
alarm he would have died of starvation long since.</p>

<p>The other knights also calmly continued with their food. They
had absolute trust in the men of the Free Companies and feared
nothing.</p>

<p>"I expect it is only the soldiers amusing themselves," nodded
Du Guesclin to one of his companions, "probably the Welsh."</p>

<p>It was indeed the Welsh.</p>

<p>The stammering Papal servants on their knees announced that
the spearmen had got into the Pope's gardens. They were very
drunk and trampling all over the flower-beds and hurling their
spears at the young saplings.</p>

<p>The Pope was terribly moved. He eyed the impassive Du Guesclin
with fury.</p>

<p>"If you do not call off these blackguards," he cried, "'twill
be my curse, not my blessing, that will go with you!"</p>

<p>The great Captain remained good-humoured.</p>

<p>"Hey, now there's a to-do over nothing!" he smiled. "'Tis but
a bit of sport. Why, Holy Father, one would think that every man
in Avignon had had his throat slit and every woman been
ravished!"</p>

<p>And Urban replied fiercely:</p>

<p>"Sooner that than that my gardens were laid waste!"</p>

<p>At which the knights laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>Rebuked by that coarse mockery the Pope beat his breast in
humble repentance.</p>

<p>"I was wrong to say that," he muttered, troubled.</p>

<p>"I was wrong."</p>

<p>He came down from his dais and paced about, greatly
distressed.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin eyed him and, seeing him old, small, feeble and
pitiful, rose up and left his meal unfinished.</p>

<p>The tumult had increased, and the gardeners, some of the
servants and a few archers who formed the Pope's bodyguard were
endeavouring to drive off the drunken intruders.</p>

<p>A fight was taking place in the rose-garden. The boughs laden
with flowers at their prime had been snapped off right and left.
The petals were trampled underfoot into the fine mould. A
gardener's boy, with a Welsh spear between his shoulder, moaned
and cried on the ground. The spearmen laughed, blasphemed and
fought. There appeared to be hundreds of them in the blue gloom
of the starlit night springing up from every <i>parterre</i> as
if it were an illustration of the old legend when Cadmus sowed
the dragon's teeth and armed men leapt up from every ridge of
earth.</p>

<p>Attracted by the sound of brawling, several bowmen came up
from the camp to help their companions. They broke through the
Pope's orchard, tearing down boughs as they passed, treading
underfoot the dropped, unripe fruit. They dragged the green
peaches and the hard pink blossoms from the walls.</p>

<p>Some of them blundered into the vineyard and clawed at the
long trails of grapes which, solid as stone, were beginning to
form beneath the leaves.</p>

<p>So used were they to destruction they could not stay their
hands.</p>

<p>They rioted across the Pope's gardens, shouting to their
companions. Some said that their master, Du Guesclin, had been
ambushed and attacked&mdash;what had begun in a frolic seemed
likely to end in a bloody affray. There were whispers of
treachery&mdash;of hidden Spanish or English troops. A drunken
spearman tore the fine wired netting of the Papal aviary. The
delicate birds fled frightened into the night.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin, a torch held either side of him, strode out on to
the balcony.</p>

<p>Through his cupped hands he sent out a shout as loud as a
trumpet, telling the men to cease their rioting, and return
immediately to camp.</p>

<p>The English knights who had followed him from their unfinished
meal grumbled at this:</p>

<p>"Why should not the men bemuse themselves? They had hardships
enough to come."</p>

<p>"This garden," said Du Guesclin, "is like a box of toys to the
old man. Besides, if we affront him he will never give us his
blessing&mdash;and you know what that will mean to the
soldiers."</p>

<p>"He would soon give us his blessing," scowled Sir Hugh
Calverley, "if he had my knife at his throat."</p>

<p>But Bertrand du Guesclin went down into the garden and sent
his squires and bachelors here and there to order the men back to
the camp.</p>

<p>In half an hour the garden was quiet, but when the Captain
returned to the guest-chamber the Pope had gone.</p>

<p>The knights shrugged their shoulders at this discourtesy, but
finished their meal, talking and jesting among themselves. Then
they too returned to the camp of the Free Companies in the
meadows beyond Avignon, their flaring red torches leaving a trail
of thick smoke like mourning banners behind them.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Knolles, riding beside Du Guesclin, complained of
the mean and paltry behaviour of the Pope. They were foolish to
accept his entertainment.</p>

<p>"What could we expect, except rebuke and discourtesy?"</p>

<p>"The old man behaved according to his habits and his age,"
replied Du Guesclin indifferently. "He is very willing to get the
Companies out of France into Spain. For that no one can have any
wonder."</p>

<p>"I hope," replied the English mercenary sullenly, "we shall
have as good harbouring in Spain as we have in France. Who is to
pay us? Much has been undertaken and little done. The money sent
by the King of France is already distributed. For the rest, we
have nothing but promises."</p>

<p>"This Don Enriquez will pay us," replied Du Guesclin, still
indifferent.</p>

<p>"And if he does not?" grumbled the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Then," said Du Guesclin, "we may even take his whole country
and hold it to ransom."</p>

<p>Knolles&mdash;and here he was supported by other knights who
rode close to him&mdash;grumbled and lamented that Spain was a
poor country and by no means to be compared with the riches of
France.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Calverley's harsh voice came suddenly out of the
dark.</p>

<p>"We might easy sack Avignon, put to flight this Pope and his
rascally Cardinals, and help ourselves to their treasure. Then
the old man might have something more worth crying over than a
few beds of flowers."</p>

<p>The English began to complain among themselves about the
behaviour of the Pope. He had, they declared, always been against
them. When, by a sheer feat of arms, they had captured villages,
towns and even forts, the Pope and the priests had stirred up the
inhabitants and lords against them. When they had made prisoners
and had allowed these out on parole to collect their ransom, the
Pope had freed them of their obligation. So the Companies had
lost much justly-earned money.</p>

<p>The Pope had even gone so far as to cry up a sort of Crusade
against the Companies, giving indulgences to any knight, burgher
or citizen who would take arms against them.</p>

<p>He had paid the Marquis of Montserrat to bribe them into
Lombardy to help him with his wars there. There had been promises
of a lump sum of three score thousand florins and great wages,
and an assoilment of <i>pena et culpa</i>, but when they had got
into Lombardy all had proved false. They had had their stomachful
of fighting, no wages and little plunder, and so had returned to
France.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Knolles reminded them of another plan the crafty
old Pope had made to lure the Companions into Hungary so that
they might lose their lives for nothing, fighting the
heathen.</p>

<p>"Now, when we have him and his Cardinals, nay the whole
College of Rome at our mercy, he raises a cry and a lament for a
few weeds trampled underfoot."</p>

<p>Bertrand du Guesclin smiled in the summer dark.</p>

<p>"Seeing how you have killed and wasted, stolen great treasure,
raped and despoiled," he remarked dryly, "it is little wonder
that the Pope and the King of France combined to ransom me to
lead you out of the country."</p>

<p>"Men must live," replied the Englishman, "and some men prefer
to live by war. One old withered man cannot set the laws by which
the world wags. We have been treated with great discourtesy,
after holding our hand in the most discreet manner, and I am
minded to burn Avignon about his ears."</p>

<p>"Remember," said Du Guesclin, "that you go on a holy Crusade
and that we require the Pope's blessing."</p>

<p>"And it does not seem," grumbled Sir Hugh Calverley, "that we
will get it after to-night."</p>

<p>"But I will not depart without it," replied Du Guesclin. "I am
not a mercenary, but a Frenchman fighting for his King&mdash;a
Christian knight setting out against one who has been
excommunicated. Am I to go like a rascal without a blessing? Nay,
sir, you must leave Avignon alone, and I shall hang several of
the Welsh spearmen and string them up in the Pope's garden that
he may see them in the morning."</p>

<p>Sir John Knolles objected:</p>

<p>"But how can we know who were the men who were in this
affray?"</p>

<p>Du Guesclin replied:</p>

<p>"We cannot know. We will make the men cast lots. You may be
quite sure that all of them have done something that deserves
death."</p>

<p>"Well," agreed the English knight, though somewhat sullenly,
"perhaps it would be better to have the blessing than to pillage
Avignon, though I regret I cannot get my fingers into the
treasure the old fox has no doubt hidden in that great palace of
his. And I hope that in Spain we may find better
entertainment."</p>

<p>"The King of Aragon," said Du Guesclin, "has promised to put
all he possesses at our disposal."</p>

<p>They reached the quarters of the Free Companies. Thirty
thousand men were encamped along the banks of the Rhone with that
order and discipline which made them so terrible a weapon in the
hands of their expert leaders.</p>

<p>There were Gascons and Germans among the Companies, but by far
the greater number were Englishmen.</p>

<p>As Du Guesclin dismounted at the door of his pavilion he asked
shrewdly if the King of England were cognizant of this enterprise
against Don Pedro?</p>

<p>"For 'tis a curious thing to me," said the Frenchman, "if King
Edward should uphold a bastard against a rightful sovereign and
favour one who is favoured by the Pope."</p>

<p>Sir Robert Knolles replied with a grin that several of the
English knights had received letters from England commanding them
to their allegiance, but had taken no more heed of the mandate
than they had before, when King Edward had bid them leave
France.</p>

<p>"Why should they listen to the King of England? They no longer
hold property in his realm nor draw wages from him. They follow
where their living and liking are. Why, sire, concern yourself
about this? You have every noted freelance in Europe under your
command."</p>

<p>But Du Guesclin was still not quite satisfied.</p>

<p>"Supposing," he said, standing at the door of his dark red
silk pavilion, "your Prince in Aquitaine were to take up the
cause of Don Pedro, how many of you would leave me to follow
him?"</p>

<p>"Sir, a great many, no doubt, but I do not think it likely
that this Edward will draw his sword in the quarrel of so base a
villain as Don Pedro."</p>

<p>"It is true," said Du Guesclin, "that he has done all in his
power to expedite my adventure, but I have personal friends of
his in my command. Yet Sir John Chandos, who is closest of all in
the Prince's regard and is his Constable, would not come."</p>

<p>He spoke regretfully, for not only was Sir John Chandos the
most famous knight but he was a cautious diplomat. His refusal to
join the expedition seemed to the Frenchman as if he saw through
the schemes of the King of France and the Pope, which were not
really to aid Don Pedro, but to be rid of the Free Companies and
to secure the return of Aquitaine to the Crown of France.</p>

<p>Leaving the English knights, Du Guesclin went into his
pavilion.</p>

<p>He was not pleased with the field he led. He knew the
reputation of the Free Companies too well. He did not intend they
should be utterly cursed by Christendom for destroying Avignon,
and perhaps murdering the Pope and the Cardinals.</p>

<p>He at once dispatched a messenger&mdash;a priest with an
escort&mdash;to the palace, imploring Urban V to give the Free
Companies his blessing. Then they should pass out of
France&mdash;Du Guesclin bid the priest emphasize these
words&mdash;in twenty-four hours' time.</p>

<p>He then, with his careful deliberation, issued orders for the
breaking of camp and instant departure from Avignon.</p>

<p>He regretted the absence of Sir John Chandos&mdash;a man after
his own heart&mdash;the knight who had captured him in the
skirmish at Auray, that little broil over the affair of the Duke
of Brittany when Du Guesclin, obeying the secret orders of the
King of France, had been fighting for De Montford against Charles
of Blois.</p>

<p>The great Breton leader did not sleep that night. When, in the
early hours of dawn, his last orders had been given he took out
his map and traced his route.</p>

<p>There was only one way that he could go, with thirty thousand
men who must live on plunder.</p>

<p>To Aragon&mdash;to Saragossa&mdash;up the Ebro in the
direction of Logrono&mdash;then the great high road to Burgos and
Valladolid.</p>

<p>It might be quicker across the barren uplands, but that way
there would be no sustenance for the men.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin wondered how Don Pedro&mdash;firmly established at
Burgos as he was&mdash;would meet the invader. Would he flee from
Galicia? Would he affront the enemy, or appeal to the Prince in
Aquitaine for help? This last Du Guesclin hoped he would not. For
if the English Prince were to take the field he (Du Guesclin)
would lose a large number of the Companions who would prefer to
fight under their famous native Commander.</p>

<p>The Breton's frog-like face became thoughtful. He played with
his rude map.</p>

<p>Yet, if the Prince in Aquitaine were lured into this adventure
and took with him his men-at-arms and treasure, it might be that
that fair Province would revolt and return to its true
allegiance.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin yawned and stretched his huge limbs.</p>

<p>His pavilion stood on rising ground in a grove of olive trees,
apart from the noise and defilements of the vast camp. He could
hear the rustling of the young leaves and of the river blended
into one melodious sound. A tender colourless light flowed
through the flaps of the tent. Du Guesclin quenched the harsh
glow of the lamp.</p>

<p>He strode to the entry of the pavilion, gratefully drawing in
the cool, refreshing air.</p>

<p>The breaking light showed the low-arched bridge stretching
across the Rhone&mdash;a graceful span, strong and light through
which the enclosed waters hurried. Beyond the outline of the town
were the towers of the Pope's palace, the high-walled façade
concealed the great courtyard and princely apartments.</p>

<p>Beyond again, unprotected, the magnificent gardens which the
mercenaries had half-ruined the previous night.</p>

<p>"It was foolish of the old man," thought Du Guesclin, "to
press so far beyond his walls and ramparts. This is no century
for a man to lay his treasures in the open."</p>

<p>The morning mists suddenly divided and with a lively sparkle
the sun rose radiantly over the exquisite plains of Comtat.</p>

<p>The great Captain thought of the old man somewhere behind
those palace walls.</p>

<p>He sympathized with him and felt a compassion towards him. Du
Guesclin himself was moderate and temperate, robust in health but
controlled in his appetites, frugal and modest in his life.</p>

<p>Something about the austerity of the Papal chambers had
pleased him. He had felt the fragrance of the old man's saintly,
austere, philosophic existence. He regretted that the gardens had
been devastated. He hoped that the Pope would give his blessing
without further dispute, so that he might take the Free Companies
away from Avignon before there was further mischief.</p>

<p>In the pure light of the rising sun the huge soldier stretched
himself, standing at the door of his dark red silk pavilion.</p>

<p>A sudden wind touched his light standard and blew it out above
the olive trees.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin's noble figure and ugly face were edged with
light. Three gold rings that he wore on his right hand sparkled
in their centres with three gold stars from the rays of the
sun.</p>

<p>As the day brightened, darts and flashes of light showed (in
between the long lines of tents) on armed men and horses.</p>

<p>In the ruined Papal gardens Urban V walked in his monk's
modest habit. Its rifled sweetness gave out a last piteous
perfume.</p>

<p>Unripe fruit and shedding blossom were flung together on the
trampled ground.</p>

<p>The Pope looked sadly right and left. All to be done over
again.</p>

<p>Several dead men had been carried away during the night.
Several wounded had crawled through the <i>parterres</i> and
along the neat paths.</p>

<p>The Pope went to look for the rare Persian flower which had
just come to the climax of its bloom. His steps were feeble and
he blinked in the power of the rising sun.</p>

<p>Everywhere he gazed was a favourite tree or a cherished plant
damaged in the senseless brawl.</p>

<p>The Persian bell-flower had been plucked up by the roots. It
lay limp and withered beneath the slashed boughs of the oleander
which had sheltered its delicate grace. Close beside was the
gardener's boy, whose pride it had been to tend the Pope's
choicest experiment. He had died defending this treasure. A Welsh
spear was through his shoulder. The Pope was bitterly ashamed of
himself because his first thought was for the plant. In his
remorse he went on his knees beside the dead boy.</p>

<p>"How long, O Lord, how long?" murmured the old man as his
chill fingers rested in blessing on the bloodless brow of the
youth.</p>

<p>The boy had been struck on the head, knocked down like a
savage beast. A gentle, studious lad who had tried to learn Latin
that he might understand the names the Pope gave the
flowers...</p>

<p>The old man raised his eyes. Another radiant day, cool,
gracious, serene, was dawning. How the heavenly sweet weather was
wasted! How the slow, gentle hours were made foolish by intrigues
and quarrels and bloody deeds!</p>

<p>The Pope detached the crucifix from his breast and laid it on
the bosom of the gardener's boy.</p>

<p>He rose stiffly from his knees and walked with bowed head and
hands clasped behind his habit down towards the river. On the
other side of the swift-flowing stream he could see the movement
and glitter of the camp of the Free Companions.</p>

<p>He thought of Du Guesclin, the monstrous armed man, who was
leading these hordes of beasts. Du Guesclin's eyes were not the
eyes of a beast. The exquisite breeze, which seemed a fitting
herald for a day of merriment and delight, blew across the ruined
orchard and rosary.</p>

<p>The Pope, walking with bent head, suddenly looked high enough
to see a man's feet dangling before his eyes. He recoiled in sick
alarm and glanced up.</p>

<p>Three men, whom he knew to be Welsh spearmen, were hanging
from the upper boughs of a stout tree on the confines of the
orchard.</p>

<p>The Pope understood. This was the way Du Guesclin, the man of
blood, made amends.</p>

<p>The Pope turned away, bitterly ashamed for all mankind and
greatly humiliated in himself.</p>

<p>Punctual to the pre-arranged hour the Free Companies rode out
of France. The Pope, with his Cardinals behind him, stood at a
balcony window of his palace and blessed them as they went
past.</p>

<p>"So," he said to himself, "these cut-throats go on their way
with the benediction of the Vicar of Christ on earth!"</p>

<p>In perfect array and maintaining the strictest discipline the
Free Companions rode and marched past the palace at Avignon. A
column, so long that it appeared endless, crossed the bridge in
orderly squads&mdash;colours and heralds, drums and trumpets,
knights, bachelors, squires, foot soldiers, pennons and
standards, baggage-mules and baggage-waggons&mdash;the steady
methodical marching past, while the weary old man stood on the
balcony continually raising his hand in blessing.</p>

<p>When the last of the camp followers had gone, leaving a cloud
of dust blowing in the road, the day was nearly spent.</p>

<p>Urban V leant wearily against the framework of the narrow
window.</p>

<p>"What a lot of trouble," he muttered, "these rascals give
themselves to find the road to Hell!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE COURT IN THE ABBEY OF ST.
ANDREW AT BORDEAUX</h2>

<p class="first">JEAN POMMIERS was angry when he saw the four
wayfarers coming up through the vineyard.</p>

<p>"That is the worst," he said to his daughter, "of living so
near the high road. We have always travellers coming here for
food or shelter."</p>

<p>The girl paused with a basket of grapes in her hand.</p>

<p>The vintage was late. There was fear of the first frosts
before the last grapes were gathered. The work had been
continuous all day in the flat vineyards under the cloudless blue
sky.</p>

<p>The four travellers made their way cautiously among the
stripped vines and baskets of high-piled grapes.</p>

<p>Jean Pommiers regarded them suspiciously; his daughter stared
curiously.</p>

<p>The foremost was a knight. A long robe, girdled over his chain
armour, bore arms unknown to the Gascon farmer. His face was
lean, sallow and melancholy. By his side walked a monk, and
behind them came two esquires.</p>

<p>It was the monk who, in a French very well understood by Jean
Pommiers, explained their business. The knight was a Castilian.
He himself was a Benedictine from the Convent of St.
Matthew-At-The-End-of-the-World. The others were bachelors. They
had left four horses on the high road, with servants and
baggage-mules.</p>

<p>The farmer interrupted:</p>

<p>"Do you think I can give shelter to a crowd like that?" he
asked, "and in the middle of the vintage, with half the grapes
not plucked and none of them pressed?"</p>

<p>The monk replied with perfect composure:</p>

<p>"We can discover no inn. Your Gascon roads are very
ill-provided. We are prepared to pay."</p>

<p>The farmer looked at the dark, gloomy face of the knight. "Who
is he and why doesn't he speak for himself?"</p>

<p>"He is a Castilian," replied the monk, "and knows very little
French. Come, don't hesitate. We require hardly anything of you.
We bring our own food. We only want water, bedding for the horses
and, perhaps, some shed or barn for ourselves. The nights begin
to grow chilly."</p>

<p>Still grumbling that he was losing precious daylight by this
conversation Jean Pommiers told his daughter to take the
strangers to the old stables beyond the vineyard, and to give
them what they wished with as little trouble to herself as
possible.</p>

<p>Staring, the girl rubbed her hands, sticky with red juice, on
her faded blue frock, and walked slowly across the vineyard away
from the high road and the farm buildings.</p>

<p>She was glad to cease her labours. The day had been long and
hot. Her back and arms ached.</p>

<p>She told the monk in a low voice that her name was Margaret
and that he must not be angry with her father if he spoke
brusquely. It had been a bad year, the crops poor, the grapes
slow in ripening, the taxes higher and higher.</p>

<p>"It is the fault of the English," she added sullenly, "they
eat up everything. Perhaps, though, you are English."</p>

<p>"No," replied the monk. "This knight is Spanish, so are the
two bachelors, and I have really forgotten what nationality I
am."</p>

<p>The girl made the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>"So men may forget who have devoted their lives to God."</p>

<p>She showed them the stable. A portion of it was occupied by a
litter of black pigs. The straw on the ground was stale and foul.
But there was an expanse of waste ground in front where, without
harm to any, they might encamp.</p>

<p>The squires sent orders to the servants to bring the horses
and the baggage.</p>

<p>The knight asked how far it was to Bordeaux?</p>

<p>"Not above three or four leagues," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"We often see the English knights passing up and down the
road."</p>

<p>"I suppose they are very magnificent?" said the monk.</p>

<p>"They live with a splendour you would hardly believe,"
returned the farmer's daughter bitterly.</p>

<p>"You have never seen anything like it. The whole of Gascony,
Guienne and Aquitaine are made to support them."</p>

<p>The bachelors returned with the travellers' train&mdash;horses
and mules were stabled&mdash;provisions unpacked&mdash;a fire lit
and water brought.</p>

<p>The night was chilly. In the paling sky appeared the first
small star and the bright orb of Hesperus. Margaret, the farmer's
daughter, sat on the hard ground outside the circle of the camp
and watched the strangers. She was very fatigued and glad of the
excuse not to return to her father, who would make her labour
until there was no longer any light in the sky.</p>

<p>The travellers made no secret of their business.</p>

<p>The monk told her that the knight was Juan de Castro. That he
had come from King Pedro of Castile on an embassy to the Prince
of Aquitaine. He said that Don Pedro had been cast from his
throne by his base-born brother. That they had come to appeal to
the English Prince to assist a distressed king to regain his
own.</p>

<p>The girl knew nothing of all these things. She understood very
little of what the monk said. But she was quick to see that if
the English Prince and his forces left Aquitaine the conquered
Provinces might be free of their alien master.</p>

<p>In the patois that only the monk could understand she
declaimed fiercely against the exactions of the hated
English.</p>

<p>The monk said to the knight in Castilian:</p>

<p>"Everywhere it is the same. This paragon Prince is detested.
People find his arm long and his hand heavy. They consider this
pattern of chivalry a rapacious bloodsucker."</p>

<p>"What does that matter to me?" replied Juan de Castro
wearily.</p>

<p>"It will matter a good deal, sire, to the success of your
mission. This Prince only holds his government by a large armed
force. Is he likely to take that out of the country on a
fantastic notion of chivalry?"</p>

<p>Juan de Castro replied:</p>

<p>"From what I can hear of him he is. Neither his pride nor his
courage will allow him to refuse the appeal of a king in
distress."</p>

<p>"You forget," smiled the monk grimly, "that your master Don
Pedro has many ugly crimes at his charge and he is besides
excommunicate by the Pope, who has blessed the Free Companies who
go to help Don Enriquez."</p>

<p>"That was merely to get them out of France," replied Juan de
Castro, with an air of disgust.</p>

<p>"What does it matter to me whether this English Prince lose
Aquitaine or not as long as he helps my master to regain Castile
from the bastard? As to what these people say, what does that
matter either? How can peasants judge a knight&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Any more," added the monk sarcastically, "than the swine can
judge the man who drags him out to have his throat cut. In both
cases a little prejudice, eh?"</p>

<p>The farmer's daughter became disinterested in this
long-continued conversation carried on in a language she did not
understand.</p>

<p>She rose, stiff with fatigue. But she was good-natured and
went off slowly to fetch clean straw and fresh bread for the
travellers.</p>

<p>These had made themselves as comfortable as possible and would
have been well at ease if it had not been for the companionship
of the pigs who grunted, squealed, and gave off a horrible
odour.</p>

<p>Juan de Castro took off his armour, rolled his cloak into a
pillow and stretched himself on the ground beside the stable
door.</p>

<p>The monk had thrown off his hood. His face, clean-shaven and
spare-fleshed, at once ascetic and shrewd, was outlined against
the darkening sky.</p>

<p>The bachelors and servants were already asleep. The songs,
half-fatigued, half-triumphant, of the vintage gatherers sounded
in the distance.</p>

<p>It was one of those peaceful evening hours that lighten what
otherwise would be the intolerable fatigue, sordid miseries,
laborious intrigues and hot cruelties of the day. Not only did
the approaching night breathe peace and quiet, but there seemed
something in that serene atmosphere which rendered trivial and
even useless all the activities of mankind.</p>

<p>The monk turned to the recumbent knight.</p>

<p>"Why do you follow Don Pedro," he asked, "and take so much
trouble to serve him? You yourself are honest as men go."</p>

<p>The Castilian knight replied gravely:</p>

<p>"I do not know. Maybe I serve my interests, maybe my loyalty.
It is true I am faithful to one who has no faith&mdash;deal
honourably with one who has no honour. But, at least, Don Pedro
is the legitimate King of Castile. And he was betrayed, and
foully, by the Chamberlain."</p>

<p>He raised himself on his elbow and added with meaning:</p>

<p>"But who are you? First you call yourself a hermit and then a
monk from the Convent of St. Matthew-At-The-End-of-the-Earth. You
know a great deal. Really, too much. Sometimes I think you are
not a Christian. Sometimes, too, I think that Maria de Padilla
was right, when she recognized in you the magician who came to
Seville with the King of Granada."</p>

<p>Nunreddin replied impassively:</p>

<p>"I have been very likely all the things that you accuse me of.
What does it matter?"</p>

<p>Juan de Castro smiled.</p>

<p>"Why do you, who are so wise, attach yourself to this Don
Pedro whom you must despise?"</p>

<p>"My answer comes readily. He has been useful to me. I have had
some pleasant quiet months in Burgos and made many interesting
experiments."</p>

<p>"And one of them on Don Pedro, I think," smiled the knight
sourly. "Have you not been striving to see how far human
credulity could go with your miracles and amulets and
prophecies?"</p>

<p>"I was well paid," said Nunreddin, "and gave good value for my
wages. You cannot disprove anything I have said."</p>

<p>"You are not a Christian," insisted Juan de Castro.</p>

<p>"But as good a Christian as I have ever met," replied
Nunreddin.</p>

<p>The Castilian knight sank back on his rude pillow.</p>

<p>"Well, it none of it matters. If you are a heathen, you will
be damned for it, not I. Why did you come with us on this
expedition," he asked lazily, "since you were enjoying yourself
so well in Burgos?"</p>

<p>"I knew the place would be intolerable when the Free Companies
came there. Besides, I was really quite attached to Don Pedro and
felt it my duty to accompany him in his flight. And, for a third
reason," smiled Nunreddin, looking in an amiable fashion at the
Castilian, "I wished to see this English Prince&mdash;this
paragon&mdash;this peerless knight&mdash;this Christian ideal of
all that a man should be&mdash;a Charlemagne, an Arthur, a
Caesar, an Alexander!"</p>

<p>"He is all that," said Juan de Castro, who suspected no
sarcasm in the Oriental's words. "And you will see him quite
soon. Also Sir John Chandos, his Constable, and Sir Thomas
Felton, his Seneschal... Yes," continued the Castilian dreamily,
"I would like to serve such an one&mdash;the noble, unconquerable
hero, the mighty leader, the loyal friend, the pattern of
manhood, grace and chivalry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The oppressor of the poor," muttered Nunreddin.</p>

<p>"A luxurious, fast, easy liver. A wanton, extravagant man of
sensual pleasures. Cruel, haughty, vain and obstinate. Do such
heroes as he people your Christians' Paradise?"</p>

<p>But Juan de Castro did not hear him. Nunreddin had spoken
almost under his breath and the Castilian was drowsing into
sleep.</p>

<p>Offended by the odour of the swine and the horses in the
stables, by the cries, moans and tossings of the sleeping,
flea-bitten men, Nunreddin wandered away from the little
encampment to the borders of the vineyard where the day's labours
had at last ceased.</p>

<p>The perfume of the grapes that had fallen and been trampled
underfoot in the hasty pluckings, permeated the chilliness of the
cold blue night.</p>

<p>The white cat, with tail erect and purring softly, hurried
over the hard earth and rubbed itself against the Oriental's
dirty, ragged robe.</p>

<p>He picked up the soft beast and pressed it to his bosom; never
had he found a human being so wholly to his taste, the cat
neither intrigued, nor lied, nor repented of her sins, her love
was frank and impetuous, her hate fierce and swift. The despoiled
vines, waving in withered, crackling garlands from the poles, the
heavy bunches of ungathered grapes, were one dusky colour in the
clear hard light.</p>

<p>Some of the peasants, exhausted by toil, had fallen down and
were heavily asleep on the bare earth. Their rags, the colour of
clay, fluttered on their breast as, even in their sleep, their
breath came hard with weariness.</p>

<p>From their labours and the labours of their like, from the
patient toil of human being and horse and mule, came the gold
which was spent with so lavish a magnificence at Bordeaux and
Bayonne&mdash;the superb courts, gorgeous tourneys and a
glittering costly array that held the world in amazement.</p>

<p>"What fools men are," thought the Oriental, walking between
the vines, "to toil thus for another's benefit! It is true that
when, driven desperate by ill-treatment, they revolt and are
butchered, but, if they knew their own value and had someone to
lead them, they would make all these pompous princes look very
stupid."</p>

<p>Nunreddin felt a disgust for the West, a nostalgia for the
East. He longed again for Egypt, Persia, Arabia, Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Here the people were crude, childish and knew nothing. In the
East only were great secrets to be learned and wise men to talk
with. He would return to the East, but first he would see the
English Paragon.</p>

<p>He lay down in a corner of the vineyard, festooned with
untouched grapes which came between him and the starlight.</p>

<p>The white cat slept on a corner of his robe.</p>

<p>The night was so still that, even apart as he was from the
others, he could hear their painful, eager breathing, as if they
snatched greedily, these overspent toilers, at their few hours of
repose.</p>

<p>The white cat slept in a different manner, without hurry or
alarm. How much more preferable was her luxurious lot to that of
the peasants!</p>

<p>By dawn the cavalcade was on its way again, by noon they had
reached the gates of Bordeaux, where the English Prince, Duke of
Aquitaine, lodged in the Abbey of St. Andrew. He kept such state
as to be disdainful of surprise or alarm, and the Castilian
knight, with the monk as interpreter, was admitted without
difficulty into the Abbey.</p>

<p>Everything was most splendid. Never in the days of his highest
pomp had Don Pedro lived with such grandeur. Nothing that the
mind of man could devise or contrive for costliness of show, was
missing from the appointments of the Duke of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>The English knights received the Castilian very courteously,
they gave him and his retinue rest and refreshment, while Don
Pedro's letter was sent in to the Prince.</p>

<p>Don Juan de Castro and Nunreddin (who passed without question
for a learned Benedictine) were shown into a large apartment; the
deep square beams of the ceiling were painted with bright
colours, on heavy cup-boards of carved wood were set out gold and
silver plate, ivory bottles, and crystal flagons, pots, basins,
porringers and ladles; there was a winged shrine thrown open on
to a bright picture of the Crucifixion. On the hood of the
fireplace, which reached to the ceiling, were deep-cut the badges
of the Prince, the three straight ostrich feathers, each an
emblem of Justice, Truth and Honour, with his two
mottoes&mdash;"Houmont" and "I serve."</p>

<p>After but a brief delay the Castilian was summoned into the
presence of the Prince. Nunreddin followed him, coolly curious to
see the most famous man in the world.</p>

<p>This inner chamber was even more sumptuous than the outer; the
walls and ceiling were entirely covered with gold leaf and paint
of a bright scarlet and a vivid blue. The hangings at windows and
doors were of a curious heavy silk, of an interchanged weaving of
red and gold, which were scattered with the Leopard of England
and the Lily of France. Between the two tall windows was a
triptych heavily framed in enamel and jewels.</p>

<p>A Persian carpet was on the floor. A few logs of orange-wood
sprinkled with aromatic herbs burnt slowly on the hearth and gave
out a drowsy perfume. Beside the hearth was a high narrow seat,
on the back were pinnacles of carving that reached nearly to the
ceiling.</p>

<p>In front of this was a table with a long white silk cloth on
which stood a ewer, a basin and a glass.</p>

<p>Seated in this chair, with a letter in his hand, was Edward of
Woodstock, Knight of the Blue Garter, Earl of Chester, Prince of
Wales and Duke of Aquitaine, whose knightly renown shone brighter
than that of any man since the days of the fabled heroes about
whom he loved to read.</p>

<p>To the right of him stood a knight who was only second in fame
to himself, his Constable, Sir John Chandos, Vicomte de St.
Sauveur. To his left was his Seneschal, Sir Thomas Felton.</p>

<p>Juan de Castro fell on his knees and began ceremonious
greetings from his master.</p>

<p>The Prince could not understand the Castilian. He turned again
to the letter Nunreddin had written for Pedro in French.</p>

<p>He told Sir John Chandos to raise the Castilian and looked
himself quickly at Nunreddin. He had a great respect for men of
all religious orders.</p>

<p>The Oriental bent his head gravely. He was quite ready with
his credentials, for which the Prince asked in Latin.</p>

<p>Edward seemed satisfied with Nunreddin's answers.</p>

<p>He bowed seriously and turned again to the letter.</p>

<p>The two messengers had ample leisure in which to indulge their
curiosity as to the great hero's person. For 'Chandos and Felton
stood erect and silent like two sentinels and took no heed of the
newcomers, while the Prince thoughtfully kept his eyes on the
letter&mdash;not so much reading as considering the contents.</p>

<p>The Prince was in the prime of life and of great build and
stature, without being as monstrous as was Du Guesclin. For there
was a fineness in all his limbs, his hands and feet were long and
elegant.</p>

<p>His features showed him to be of the renowned House of
Plantagenet, a true descendant of Fulk of Anjou. There was
something in the contour of that famous face which reminded
Nunreddin of a lion he had seen in the menagerie of the King of
Granada&mdash;here were the same rounded, blunt contours, the
flat cheeks, the short nose, the prominent chin and the upright
carriage of the neck, so impressive and dignified; the tawny
colouring of the Prince's short sleek hair and clear complexion,
the same dark, bold look helped the likeness to the noble animal.
His naturally fair skin was deeply tanned. His lips were
beautifully shaped, his fargazing eyes had also that gold or
tawny look. They were wide apart under serene, level brows and
had a grand look, but one was disfigured by a drooping lid and a
cast (that blemish which no Plantagenet wholly escaped, and which
was supposed to be a heritage from some bargain Fulk of Anjou had
made with the Devil), "Satan's squint" as the enemies of this
great House named this hereditary defect.</p>

<p>The Prince wore a robe of yellow silk brocade that reached the
ground and was girdled at the waist. His long sleeves touched his
feet. His stiff collar came up to his ears, and round his head
was twisted a violet silk coif with scalloped edges. Across his
broad chest glittered the colour of the Blue Garter of St. George
and several chains of rubies and sapphires. His tight inner
velvet sleeves wrinkled almost to his fingers, which were
rendered nearly useless by the quantity of heavy rings he wore.
The ends of his shoes were turned up and fastened round his
ankle. In his belt was a dagger&mdash;more as an excuse, as it
seemed for a further display of jewellery, than for any practical
reason.</p>

<p>He carried himself well, with both grace and dignity, yet
something of his natural quickness and elegance were lost because
of the extremely fashionable but unbecoming awkward richness of
his attire.</p>

<p>Nunreddin glanced from the master to his two favourite
friends.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Felton was dark and heavy and dressed in a style
too foppish for his sombre personality.</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos, now old, was very plainly attired and had
something beautiful both in his face and his person.</p>

<p>The Prince asked Juan de Castro if he could speak French, and
the knight replied that he had a little knowledge of the Court
language, but none of the patois which the peasants spoke.</p>

<p>"But the monk, sire, is very learned. He knows seventeen
languages."</p>

<p>"You and I," smiled Edward, "must contrive to manage with
one." He added with what seemed a rising excitement, "Your master
asks me to help him. You know his affairs, I doubt not?"</p>

<p>"I am, I believe," replied the Castilian, "the only faithful
friend my master has left. He was forced to fly from Burgos as,
more than a year ago, he was forced to fly from Seville. He took
merchant ship from Corunna and made a difficult way by sea."</p>

<p>"What has he with him?" asked the Prince.</p>

<p>"A retinue of a few faithful knights and, God be thanked, a
vast amount of treasure. Also his two young
daughters&mdash;Constancia and Ysabella."</p>

<p>But Juan de Castro did not add that Don Pedro was also
accompanied by Donna Maria de Padilla&mdash;the accursed woman
who was the cause of all his misfortunes.</p>

<p>"Why did he not gather some forces at Burgos," asked Prince
Edward, "and make a stand for his rights, instead of flying?"</p>

<p>"Sire, Bertrand du Guesclin and the Free Companies are
marching on Burgos&mdash;thirty thousand strong. Don Enriquez,
the cursed bastard, was in Seville with a mighty force. Du
Guesclin had the insolence to send to my master and ask for a
free passage for his troops, saying they were pilgrims on the way
to Saragossa. The Companies were healthy and lusty and had been
gorged with plunder and entertained by the King of Aragon, who is
an enemy of my master."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," smiled Prince Edward, "that your master has
nothing but enemies. The Pope has excommunicated him."</p>

<p>"The Pope," replied the Castilian, cunningly endeavouring to
hit the English Prince in a tender spot, "is a pensioner of the
King of France and does his will. They wish to get the Free
Companies out of their country into Spain."</p>

<p>But the Prince did not jump at this bait. He replied:</p>

<p>"I have no wish to do a displeasure to the King of France. My
royal father himself has commanded the Free Companies to depart.
And the Pope had other reasons&mdash;he had, sir, many and bitter
complaints against your master."</p>

<p>At which De Castro replied hastily:</p>

<p>"The King bade me remind you, sire, that there was a Treaty of
Alliance between you and he a few years ago, and in the name of
that he appeals to you for your help. I gave him that advice,"
added the Castilian proudly. "I said, 'Sire, give heed to me.
Send straightway to the Prince of Aquitaine&mdash;a man so
chivalrous and hardy and so strong in knights and men-at-arms
that God alone can put him down. If you find him ready to help
you, you will have Spain again in your hands before a year is
over.'"</p>

<p>Nunreddin glanced shrewdly and covertly at the Englishman to
see how he would take this bold flattery.</p>

<p>He seemed to receive it as no more than his due.</p>

<p>"Don Pedro asks a good deal," he said with dignity.</p>

<p>"It is true that I have been idle too long and should be very
well pleased to embark on an adventure of arms. But there are
reasons of state to be considered. I would have to consult my
parliament here in Bayonne, and my father at Westminster."</p>

<p>"No one, sire," replied the Castilian, "can fail to commend
your prudence, but in the meanwhile it is a pity that Bertrand du
Guesclin will get the name of the best knight in the world and
have the honour of conquering Castile and making a bastard King.
And this by the aid of many Englishmen who would follow Your
Highness if you but lifted your finger."</p>

<p>Nunreddin marked how the Prince's tawny eyes smouldered
beneath the heavy lids, but he maintained his impressive calm
which appeared good-humoured but inflexible.</p>

<p>"You do well to speak boldly for your master," he replied,
"but I have many interests to consult and many reflections to
make before I give you my answer. Meanwhile you and your retinue
will not lack entertainment."</p>

<p>He held out his hand and De Castro kissed it, feeling on his
lips the hard coldness of the jewelled rings.</p>

<p>The Castilian was not wholly dissatisfied with the impression
he had made on the Prince.</p>

<p>Followed by Nunreddin, who gladly would have stayed to study
this great hero, De Castro left the royal apartments.</p>

<p>As soon as they had gone, Edward turned with far more
animation than he had allowed himself in the presence of the
strangers to his two close friends.</p>

<p>"My lords, this is great news!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Hear it again and, while I read, consider in your own
hearts."</p>

<p>He then read carefully, word for word, the letter from Don
Pedro, penned at Corunna in the misery and alarm of a hasty
flight.</p>

<p>Folding up the letter, the Prince exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Sir John and Sir Thomas, you are my principal advisers in
whom I have the greatest trust and confidence, tell me what I
should do in this business?"</p>

<p>The two Englishmen exchanged a glance in silence.</p>

<p>On the noble face of Chandos was a shade of doubt and
sorrow.</p>

<p>"Sirs," urged the Prince impatiently, "say boldly whatever you
think." He rose and added impetuously: "You know how irksome to
me has been this life in Aquitaine! How ill-fitted I am for this
dull routine work of an administrator! And how I long again for a
life of action."</p>

<p>It was at Chandos that he looked as he spoke and Chandos who
replied; no man was dearer or nearer to the Prince's heart.</p>

<p>"We know that, sire. I think of the danger of your leaving
Aquitaine and drawing off your force. I know, sire, the misery
these people felt at leaving France and how they long to return
to the allegiance of King Charles. They submit to us but they
hate us."</p>

<p>"We keep the Provinces by force," said Felton, "a force that
must not be relaxed for a moment. The frontier fortresses are
still more French than English."</p>

<p>"You take it too heavily, Sir John," replied the Prince, not
pleased at this counsel. "What does it matter to me if the people
do hate us so long as they pay their taxes and obey my laws?"</p>

<p>"But the moment your back is turned," replied Chandos sadly,
"they will cease to do either, sire."</p>

<p>"We are hated," agreed the Prince, "that is natural; conquered
people will detest those who have overborne them. But," he added
with superb self-assurance, "they are also afraid of us and no
one will dare to raise a hand at my administration, whatever I
undertake or wherever I go."</p>

<p>Both Chandos and Felton thought differently. They knew well
enough that the English had done nothing to ingratiate themselves
in the Provinces torn from France. The Prince's administration
was careless and inefficient. The French people were suspicious
that they could never obtain any justice under his rule, for his
favourites and his relations filled all offices.</p>

<p>Around Bordeaux and in the vine-growing districts the
situation was made even more tense and difficult, by commercial
rivalries and jealousies between the French and the English.</p>

<p>Most important of all, to shrewd, astute and experienced men
like Chandos and Felton, there was a huge deficit in the reyenue,
and it was quite impossible for the Prince's magnificent
extravagance to brook any manner of retrenchment.</p>

<p>Of all things he could not afford that most costly
luxury&mdash;a war.</p>

<p>There were two other heavy drawbacks to interfering in the
Castilian faction. The loyalty of the great feudal lords of
Aquitaine was strongly suspected to lie towards the King of
France, and the Free Companions, whose assistance was almost
essential in any European warfare, and these were already engaged
on the other side.</p>

<p>"Sire," broke out Chandos, "who is this Don Pedro? A man
stained with many crimes, excommunicate by the Pope, against whom
the hands of all Christians should be set."</p>

<p>"But he is an ancient ally of my father's," said Edward
moodily, "and the other man is a bastard and has no right to take
the kingdom as if it were his by legal inheritance. That, sirs,
is a bad precedent."</p>

<p>He recalled, and the two Englishmen knew that he recalled, the
fall of his grandfather.</p>

<p>"It is bad policy," he insisted, "to allow a disputed
succession to a Crown. This Don Pedro, villain as he may be, is
the legal King of Castile. He is in distress and he has appealed
to me. At least, my lords, allow him to come to Bordeaux and
plead his cause in person."</p>

<p>"Let him come," said Chandos sadly, "and he will be but a
trouble and a burden, a cause for dispute, when we have dispute
already. Sire, there is enough to give a man work to do day and
night in Aquitaine, without embarking on another's bottomless
quarrel."</p>

<p>The Prince turned on his old friend and cried out in a tone of
reproach:</p>

<p>"Chandos! Chandos! I've known the time when you would have
given me other advice, whether the cause was right or wrong!"</p>

<p>Chandos bent his head before this rebuke. He was a more
far-seeing man than his master and one who did not so greatly
crave for adventure and fame. Though in his youth he had been
known only for his extravagant exploits of chivalry and glory,
yet in his age he had become wise and shrewd&mdash;a man who
could foretell and cast events. He was weary in Aquitaine. He
would have liked the war to be renewed between England and
France, or to have returned to England, but, for the honour of
King Edward, the conquered provinces must be held and
administered. How this could be done and the fantastical war for
Castile undertaken as well, Chandos could not see.</p>

<p>"Our most crying need is money," he remarked.</p>

<p>"How, sire, will you get the money for this expedition if
indeed you choose to undertake it?"</p>

<p>"Don Pedro brings treasure with him," replied the Prince, who
was always impatient of even the mere mention of expense, for he
had been used all his life to have whatever he wanted and never
to count the cost.</p>

<p>Debts had encompassed and involved him since he was a youth.
Bailiffs had sweated continuously to extort his heavy revenues
from his rich estates, and his English tenantry cursed him as
deeply for his extortions as did his subjects in Aquitaine.</p>

<p>Glorious as was his name and far-spreading as was his
reputation, he was only loved by those who came into direct
contact with his personality. To his friends, foolishly generous,
indulgent and yielding, yet he had never done anything to make
himself beloved or respected by those who did not come within
reach of his voice, his look, his elegant and gallant person.</p>

<p>"Send me," he said to Chandos, putting a hand firmly on that
knight's shoulder, "the monk who came with the Castilian. I wish
to question him about a few matters. The Castilian will lie
loyally for his master's sake, but the monk has a strange
unworldly face. I believe he will tell me the truth."</p>

<p>So it came about that evening that Nunreddin, who the night
before had been lodged with the sweating labourers sighing for
weariness even in their sleep among the vines, was received by
the Prince of Wales in his private apartment in the Abbey of St.
Andrew.</p>

<p>It was after supper. Two minstrels sat in the window. Their
instruments lay silent about their knees. Above their heads hung
a sleeping singing-bird in a silver cage.</p>

<p>As Nunreddin entered noiselessly, his hands wrapped in his
sleeves, he perceived Prince Edward half-reclining on a couch at
the far end of the chamber.</p>

<p>He was without his formal splendour of the daytime. He looked
taller and more manly in the plain white garment girdled round
the waist, his tawny hair uncovered. As Nunreddin entered the
Prince dismissed the musicians.</p>

<p>Nunreddin was alone with the formidable hero. The Oriental
knew that if he were discovered to be a heathen masquerading as a
Christian he was likely to receive swift and terrible
punishment.</p>

<p>Prince Edward was a deeply religious man. He never missed his
Masses and prayers, nor stinted in his lavish gifts to the
Church, nor hesitated to undertake tedious and costly
pilgrimages.</p>

<p>But the Oriental was not afraid of detection. He was wiser,
more cunning and better educated than any men whom he met in
Europe. He knew all the trick symbols and passwords with which
Christians deceived each other.</p>

<p>He had shaved his silver beard and hair. The dark
yellowish-brown of his complexion passed very well for a southern
skin tanned by exposure.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you," said the Prince. "You are the monk who
has been in the confidence of Don Pedro since he fled from
Seville last autumn?"</p>

<p>Nunreddin bowed his head without replying. His attitude was
respectful without being servile.</p>

<p>The Englishman studied him closely. He added in a tone touched
with awe:</p>

<p>"I have even heard that you can prophesy and work
miracles."</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Nunreddin, "I have some skill in abstruse
sciences, and by these means am able sometimes to perform what
seem miracles to the ignorant."</p>

<p>"Where did you acquire this learning?"</p>

<p>"Sire, I have wandered all over the known world. I have
penetrated into the secrets of the philosophers, the learnings of
the schoolmen. I know the teachings of the Assyrian, Turkish, and
the Arabian philosophers."</p>

<p>Prince Edward crossed himself.</p>

<p>"But that is contrary to the will of God," he said
sternly.</p>

<p>The Oriental did not reply, but stood serenely, though not
meekly, with his arms folded.</p>

<p>Edward spoke again. His manner was less severe, even
hesitating.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have even endeavoured to discover the
Philosopher's Stone or the Elixir of Life?"</p>

<p>"Sire," replied the Oriental, "the most curious and
investigating of men must keep their lips sealed on some of these
incredible secrets, until the time comes when it is the will of
God to reveal all&mdash;the power of the elements, of the metals,
of the principles of nature and of the intellect of
humanity."</p>

<p>Edward frowned. He seemed slightly uneasy.</p>

<p>"How did you, a Christian monk, come to attach yourself to a
man like Don Pedro of Castile?" he asked. "You know that he is
excommunicate. How can a monk continue to pray for such a
man?"</p>

<p>"How can a knight fight for such a man?" asked the Oriental.
"Yet I think you, sire, do intend to fight for him."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, monk?" asked the Englishman, haughtily. "And
why?"</p>

<p>"Because you are a man of action who has found it very irksome
to live as ruler of a murmuring province. The government of
peoples is as nothing to you. You wish to command thousands of
armed men and to win battles. You were born and trained to do
that. Sire, you do not greatly care whether you fight for an
excommunicated cut-throat or not, as long as you have an
opportunity to display to the world your resplendent
prowess."</p>

<p>Prince Edward was half-startled out of his habitual and
magnificent self-absorption. Never had anyone&mdash;not even Sir
John Chandos&mdash;spoken to him so plainly. But he was above
taking offence from a monk.</p>

<p>"What else is there in life for a knight," he replied, "but
war and adventure? Clerks and lawyers, bailiffs and priests can
govern. Tell me of Don Pedro. It was for that I asked you here.
Is he, as some say, a madman?"</p>

<p>"He is more dangerous than a madman. He is not only sane, but
able and cunning. He is ruthless, false and cruel. He was about
to make an alliance with the usurping King of Granada, Abu-Sa'ad.
Yet, tempted by the jewels he and his retinue wore, he had them,
as guests, murdered in their apartments."</p>

<p>"They were heathens," remarked Prince Edward.</p>

<p>"Yes, sire, they were heathens. But many Christians have also
been murdered by this Don Pedro. He has outraged and defiled
professors and churches of his own faith. There is no good in
him&mdash;a beast, with the cunning of a man. Will the English
pattern of honour champion such?"</p>

<p>"It is strange for you," said the Englishman, "to persuade me
against your master."</p>

<p>"I do not count him my master, sire. I am indifferent to him,
to Don Enriquez, yourself, to all the rulers of mankind. I speak
of what I see and know."</p>

<p>"Don Pedro has no friend, it seems to me, save myself. The
King of France, the Pope, the King of Aragon, Bertrand du
Guesclin, the Free Companions&mdash;all against him! It would be
an excellent adventure to assist an oppressed King."</p>

<p>"Don Enriquez," said Nunreddin, "is a great honourable knight
and much beloved by the Castilians. No one regrets Don
Pedro."</p>

<p>Prince Edward raised his head suddenly, the droop in his lid
seemed accentuated and the pronounced cast in his eye gave a
sinister expression to a face otherwise noble and grand.</p>

<p>"If I took up this cause," he said, "it would not be for the
sake of Don Pedro but for the sake of a principle. He is the
legitimate King, the other but a bastard and a usurper."</p>

<p>The Oriental gave his faint smile.</p>

<p>"No doubt, sire, you are clever enough to do that. An adroit
politician can always give his personal desires the air of a
principle."</p>

<p>"You talk like a wise man," smiled Edward, suddenly rising to
the full of his splendid height. "Give me your advice."</p>

<p>"It will be disregarded, sire. Yet, it takes no prophet to
tell you that if you leave Aquitaine with all your armed force to
help this scoundrel regain his throne, you will commit, not only
an unworthy, but a foolish action. You will probably lose the
French Provinces to England. Aquitaine will certainly revolt in
your absence."</p>

<p>"And if it does," replied the Englishman, "I will conquer it
again when I return."</p>

<p>Nunreddin looked at him very curiously.</p>

<p>"You are quite fearless, are you not, sire? You have never
been set down or humiliated, or bent any manner of bow you could
not spring."</p>

<p>Prince Edward did not think this worth answering.</p>

<p>He smiled, interested to hear what this strange creature would
say next.</p>

<p>But Nunreddin merely added:</p>

<p>"'Tis true, I am something of a prophet, but I am also wise
enough to keep my prophecies to myself."</p>

<p>Prince Edward paced up and down the room.</p>

<p>He had a soft padding tread, and the grace of a noble beast in
the light swing of his carriage.</p>

<p>"We live in such base, degenerate times," he lamented. "These
modern days are full of sordid dullness." His quick, sidelong
glances seemed to despise the splendours by which he was
surrounded.</p>

<p>"Everything is in decay. Chivalry is not what it was, nor
knighthood, nor feats of arms. To know the pride of honour and
adventure one must read the old books of past times. To gain any
satisfaction one must lose oneself in a world of fancy."</p>

<p>"Have you never, sire," asked Nunreddin, "never felt in your
moments of great triumph or resounding victory, complete
happiness?"</p>

<p>Edward paused to stare at him moodily.</p>

<p>"Once perhaps, at Crécy," he answered half-sullenly, "and then
I was but sixteen years old and that's twenty years ago. The
world seems quite different now. Yes, there I won my spurs and
proved myself a worthy Plantagenet, it was a good moment. I
recall that once I was hurled to the ground and my
standard-bearer, Richard de Beaumont, covered me with the great
banner of Wales. I have known no such pleasure since."</p>

<p>"Yet the battle was senseless," said Nunreddin, "and the war a
blunder."</p>

<p>"I cared not for that," replied Prince Edward musingly; then,
as if he suddenly realized the import of what the Oriental said,
he added fiercely:</p>

<p>"My father was in the right. England was in the right."</p>

<p>"How many archers and bowmen were slain at Crécy?" asked
Nunreddin. "When the Genoese hesitated, being much fatigued, the
French (who employed them) turned and rode them down with great
slaughter. How many horses died, maddened with fright and the
stings of arrows?"</p>

<p>"What does any of that matter?" replied Edward impatiently.
"<i>We</i> lost only forty knights."</p>

<p>"No, it does not matter," agreed Nunreddin, "the poorer sorts
only exist to fight and toil for great lords, knights and princes
like yourself, sire. The animals only exist to toil and suffer
for the benefit of mankind. So ordained an all-merciful God."</p>

<p>Prince Edward heard no sarcasm in these words. He continued to
move about the room, his white robe flowing open as he walked and
revealing the strength of his limbs.</p>

<p>Nunreddin peered forward and stared steadily up at that
leonine face, which was pale in its proper complexion under the
tan.</p>

<p>"Why are you uneasy, why not wholly satisfied, sire?" he
asked. "Have you not everything that the world can
offer&mdash;fame, wealth, power, a beautiful wife, a fair son, a
loving father, valiant brothers, troops of noble friends, an
admiring mother, armed men ready to press round your standard
and, most valuable of all, a complacent God Who asks nothing but
the few prayers and gifts which you can so easily bestow?"</p>

<p>The Prince paused in his movement and stared down at the
speaker. His beautifully-shaped lips were certainly pale, the
flat-cheeked generously-modelled face with the noble impressive
lines had a look as if it had been suddenly chilled. Yet
Nunreddin observed on the forehead beneath the heavy fringe of
tawny hair small beads of sweat.</p>

<p>"How do you know I am uneasy and dissatisfied?" he asked in a
thick voice.</p>

<p>"Sire, if you would tell me your trouble, I might assist you.
I am a physician."</p>

<p>"A physician!" exclaimed the Prince. "What has a physician to
do with me? Certainly," he added thoughtfully, "I had just now a
spasm of pain, like the prick of an arrowhead in my side. But
'tis nothing, only once in weeks does it come. A physician! I
have no need of a physician, monk."</p>

<p>Nunreddin did not speak.</p>

<p>The Prince's face assumed an expression of pride beyond vanity
or haughtiness.</p>

<p>"I am the strongest man in the world&mdash;do you hear, monk?
I have never met my equal at feats of arms, at the six-foot lance
or the broadsword. Since I was a boy I have been accustomed to
wear heavy armour. Nobody can ride in complete mail longer than
I. I can endure fatigue or privation as well as any I have ever
met. So much health and strength has God given me."</p>

<p>"Rejoice in it, boast of it, while you can, sire," replied the
Oriental. "The days pass swiftly and the nights are brief."</p>

<p>Prince Edward looked at him without any faltering in his stare
of serene pride.</p>

<p>"You speak of old age, monk. Before that comes to me I shall
be dead in battle. Begone! You shall be well entertained. Before
the month is over you shall know my decision with regard to your
master."</p>

<p>As Nunreddin left the room, Prince Edward raised the curtain
which led to an inner apartment. He was sorry he had wasted so
much time on this monk, who had fascinated him with his lean,
brown look, his impassive eyes and his slow careful
utterance.</p>

<p>The Prince approached a bed, where the leopards woven in gold
thread sparkled in the lamplight.</p>

<p>There lay Jeannette, his wife, her bodice of ermine unlaced on
white silk, the pearl buckles of her girdle unfastened and flung
aside, her yellow hair carefully combed into a gold net, her
skirts of the most costly shot silk trailed over the edge of the
bed to the floor.</p>

<p>Jeannette was two years older than her husband. Though he
still appeared in the prime of youth she seemed a woman whose
chief beauty was already overpast.</p>

<p>She had always been very clever in obtaining what she wanted,
but her successes had not seemed so brilliant to her as they did
to others. She was of the blood-royal of England, amorous, idle,
selfish and extravagant beyond bounds.</p>

<p>Already her fair face, which had been acclaimed as the most
beautiful in England, was marked with the petulant lines of one
whose every desire has been gratified and who remains
unsatisfied.</p>

<p>"What was this long tedious talk, Edward?" she asked
pettishly.</p>

<p>"I had a mind to speak to the man, sweetheart. They say he has
much learning."</p>

<p>"He would embroil you," protested the Princess impatiently,
raising herself on her elbow, "in this Castilian expedition."</p>

<p>"Nay," smiled Edward, "he told me nothing but what was ill of
his master, Don Pedro."</p>

<p>Jeannette looked relieved. She wished to keep her husband
beside her. She was afraid, too, of the coffers. Though she was
as spendthrift as her husband, she had not his indifference to
money itself. It was his way to command things for her and expect
obedience, regardless of what it might cost. But the Princess
worried where the money was coming from and was always fearful
lest her extravagances would have to be curbed.</p>

<p>"Do not help this Don Pedro," she insisted, "we cannot afford
it. Every month the revenues grow less and the people complain
more. Chandos and Felton continually come to me, grumbling about
our household expenses. They say those bills for the tournament
at Bayonne were beyond measure extravagant. Certainly none of
them are paid yet."</p>

<p>"If I choose to undertake the expedition," replied Edward, who
was always impatient when his wife talked of finance (this was a
subject on which he did not listen with much relish to anyone),
"Aquitaine must find the money."</p>

<p>"But why should you go? There is everything against it. The
man is excommunicate, discredited. Every reputable knight in
Europe has taken service with his rival. We cannot afford it and
everyone is unwilling to have another war."</p>

<p>Edward took her little hand and stroked it. She had wooed and
won him when she was another man's widow. Without her deliberate
arts he had never looked her way. Yet he had loved her entirely
since their marriage, nor had he allowed so much as a glance to
stray to another woman. She wondered at this fidelity. It seemed
to her to have a kind of stupidity in it, because she knew that
it was she who had entangled him, and that he had not sought her
out with impatient passion. This was, to her, the flaw in their
happiness. But he knew of none. She was his wife, his cousin, his
love, Jeannette, his lady, the mother of a noble little prince
who would one day be King of England.</p>

<p>He looked at her with such tenderness that she thought he was
going to ask some favour. She was careful never to show temper
before him. To disguise her rising annoyance she smiled, studying
him from under delicately painted lashes.</p>

<p>He was splendid to look at, the strong magnificent man with
the white collar open on his massive throat and chest, his tawny
hair, that in some places was darkened almost to a red colour,
framing the blunt leonine face.</p>

<p>Jeannette loved him, but because he was the eldest son of the
King of England, the most famous knight in the world, a man whom
all other men envied and whom all other women admired, and
perhaps hated because their lords were his inferiors.</p>

<p>She could not have made a more splendid match nor married a
man who had given her so lavishly all her selfish, greedy soul
desired.</p>

<p>But even as she gazed at him now, so wholly hers, so
subservient to her in love and tenderness, there was that little
prick of fear at her heart.</p>

<p>She was older than he, she was losing her youth and she knew
she had never had anything but her beauty.</p>

<p>"The Fair Maid of Kent," people had called her, and with that
fairness she had purchased the world's most splendid trophies and
prizes. And if she lost that, by what could she hold him?</p>

<p>She turned her eyes away and her terrors deepened, for she
thought he was gazing at her, marking the paint on her face and
the wrinkles it hid. How could she hold him&mdash;the strong,
powerful, sensual man, whose life before he met her had been one
round of pleasure, of easy, wanton gaiety?</p>

<p>If he went to Spain! Her mind travelled over all the
possibilities of the long journey far from her... this Don Pedro
had two young daughters&mdash;brought up by that witch-woman,
Maria de Padilla, witches themselves for all she knew, potent
with charms and spells.</p>

<p>"Do not assist the King of Castile, Edward," she pleaded.
"There is everything against it."</p>

<p>He tenderly pulled up the down pillows behind her head. There
was more good in him than her shallow nature could judge. She
might have been reassured. He would always be faithful to his
wife. He would never deny anything to the mother of his little
Edward. But this Jeannette would never understand.</p>

<p>She would always remember how easily she had ensnared him and
dreaded that another woman would achieve the same success.</p>

<p>She exclaimed petulantly:</p>

<p>"How can you even consider going, Edward? Everyone is against
it. Every circumstance and every reason are against it."</p>

<p>"All but one, Jeannette," he replied good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"That is, my own desire. Supposing, despite everyone and all
these circumstances, Jeannette, opinions and reasons, I
<i>wish</i> to go?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; NEW LOAVES</h2>

<p class="first">THE new loaves had just come from the oven, and
the smell of warm bread filled the small, dark shop.</p>

<p>Raynold the baker opened the upper shutter of his door and
pushed out his puffy face, powdered with flour, peering into the
street. He had been standing for hours over his brick fireplace
and was glad of a breath of the frosty wintry air.</p>

<p>The heavy signs of the other shops in the narrow
street&mdash;the smith, the perfumer, the
haberdasher&mdash;sullenly clattered in a sharp wet east
wind.</p>

<p>The cobbled street was empty, for it was yet early in the day.
A thin layer of frost covered the foul water of the gutter
running down the middle of the narrow way.</p>

<p>Raynold the baker leant heavily on the lower portion of his
door and thought vaguely how monotonous was life. He heard
occasionally of great deeds and exciting events in the outer
world, but none of those came his way.</p>

<p>Even the war, so lately over, had seemed to make little
difference to him, for ever since he could remember there had
been scarcity and high taxes. It had had no effect on his daily
life, though one brother had been slain at Crécy and another at
Poictiers.</p>

<p>He had still continued to bake bread in his dark underground
cellar, mixing the leaven with the flour, watching the loaves
rise, standing by the steadily-glowing wood and charcoal, so
grateful in winter and of such a suffocating heat in summer.</p>

<p>Nothing of interest seemed to pass down this narrow street,
though it was so near the palace of the King.</p>

<p>Now and then an archer or man-at-arms came home, but he would
seem to know very little about the war or when and where he had
fought. Even when the soldiers were wounded they seemed
inarticulate about the causes of their disasters.</p>

<p>The baker had heard his father talk of the days when there had
been a Court in Paris and one could see, for a diversion, the
lords and ladies riding past, or being carried in litters. And
sometimes a tourney at which the poor folk might obtain
admission, standing patiently for hours behind a rope to catch a
glimpse of the silks and satins, the glittering steel and the
gleaming horses. But that was all of the good old days&mdash;a
thing of the past. The last King had been for years a prisoner in
London and the country had been bled to pay his ransom. Now he
was dead in captivity and there was this quiet young man on the
throne whom few saw and who had none of the qualities which go to
make a knight. Always there was scarcity, sometimes approaching
famine. Always there were taxes to be paid, and Raynold the baker
was too tired to complain.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye, the baker's lodger, looked down from his
leaded window above the sign of the great painted loaf cut out of
wood. He saw the baker, his hair white with flour, leaning over
the half-door below, and he sighed. He too found life monotonous.
The world seemed very stale and weary. Every day the same tedious
round.</p>

<p>Eking a poor living as a scribe, satisfying oneself with bread
and salads and water, sometimes a little acid wine, sometimes a
few dreams when one was not so tired as to fall asleep
immediately work was finished... what sort of life was this for a
man? Every possible joy and pleasure, every possible opportunity,
seemed to have been eaten up by that bestial, mad war. And now
the peace had come everyone was exhausted.</p>

<p>France had opened the veins of her own life-blood to pay for
her defence against the wanton attack by the King of England and
to raise the enormous ransom demanded for the last King John of
Valois. After all for no purpose, for he had died in captivity,
and his son was a weakling.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye reflected bitterly on these things. There
seemed no place, he thought, in the world for a man like himself,
who detested war and cruelty, bloodshed and rapine, and was of no
use at any feat-of-arms.</p>

<p>He had pitiful recollections of when he was a small boy and
had a pleasant home near the sea by the great town of Calais.
When the English landed they had burnt that little house and
slaughtered everyone, save himself and an old swineherd, who had
contrived to flee with his frightened charge and, ever keeping a
little ahead of the advancing army, had come to Paris.</p>

<p>The child had been brought up at the Convent of Franciscans
where they kept the old herdsman till he died.</p>

<p>But Philippe Braye had no wish to be a monk&mdash;that life
was as distasteful to him as that of a soldier.</p>

<p>He had found employment with the Benedictines who were far
more learned than the poor Franciscans and who had given him some
sort of a liberal education.</p>

<p>He had attended lectures and studies at the Sorbonne and had
heard many odds and ends of philosophies which had merely
unsettled his soul.</p>

<p>He believed that he would find satisfaction in some sort of
art, in carving statues like those round the porch of the great
Cathedral, or in painting pictures like those on the altars
which, precious as jewels, were locked up in their decorated
cases save when the Mass was being said.</p>

<p>But he lacked skill and patrons. Everyone was absorbed in war
or the results of war. No one cared about the arts. Materials too
were costly and it was seldom that he could squeeze enough from
the money he earned, laboriously copying monotonous documents for
the doctors of law, to buy a few colours and a sheet of parchment
from the apothecary at the end of the street who was cunning in
mixing earth and oils.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye sighed. The east wind lifted the light hair on
his pale forehead.</p>

<p>That breath of heaven, pure even over the foulness of the
city, afflicted him with an almost unendurable nostalgia.
Pleasantly came the smell of the new bread.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye felt hungry. The baker was good-natured and
would give him a portion of new loaf, even when he owed his rent
and had no sou in his wallet.</p>

<p>But he was tired too, for he had sat up far into the night by
the light of his poor lamp, labouring at his neat rows of square
black letters, adorned with curls and stiff flourishes, which his
reed pen, dipped in black paint, had carefully formed on the
legal parchment.</p>

<p>Therefore he continued to lean out of the window above the
sign of the painted loaf.</p>

<p>A man in a long murray-coloured robe trimmed with shabby fur,
a flat cap of worn velvet pulled over his brows, was coming down
the street.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye surveyed him with curiosity. He knew everyone
who lived near by, and this was a stranger. The young scholar
felt an instant sympathy towards him. He had a grave and learned
aspect. And he was delighted when this stranger paused (he seemed
to smell the new loaves) and stopped to speak to the baker.
Philippe Braye descended into the shop.</p>

<p>The baker had opened the lower portion of his door and the
stranger had entered and was asking for a slice of new bread.</p>

<p>"It is cold," he said, in an agreeable voice, "and the glow
from your furnace is pleasant." Seeing Philippe Braye enter he
smiled and greeted him courteously.</p>

<p>The baker served them both with a large manchet of new
bread.</p>

<p>High in the upper air, a few faint beams of light pierced the
wintry clouds and fell with a pale glow down the narrow street
into the dark shop.</p>

<p>"An early and a severe winter, I fear, messire," said the
baker, standing respectfully before the stranger whom he guessed
to be a man of quality.</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed the other, "there is no lack of misfortune in
France. But we must have patience, my good fellow, and hope for
better times."</p>

<p>"I have heard that said ever since I can remember," replied
the baker. "Whether I have patience or not it seems to make very
little difference. I must continue to bake my loaves and to try
to sell them to collect my money and pay my taxes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps this winter," said the stranger, "we shall get the
English out of France."</p>

<p>Neither the young scholar nor the tradesman appeared very
interested in this. The new-comer, who was full of his subject,
continued with animation:</p>

<p>"The English Prince, this paragon, Duke of Aquitaine, as he
calls himself, has actually been persuaded to help put that
rascal Don Pedro back on the throne of Castile and has declared
that this very winter he will lead a force across the
Pyrenees."</p>

<p>"I do not see," said the baker, "that that will make very much
difference to us."</p>

<p>"It will make a great difference to you, my poor fellow, if we
can get the English out of the country. It is certain that as
soon as the Englishman's back is turned Aquitaine will
revolt."</p>

<p>"Cross the Pyrenees in winter?" said Philippe Braye. "That
seems the act of a madman, but then these soldiers all seem to be
mad."</p>

<p>"They pursue glory," smiled the stranger.</p>

<p>"But Don Pedro is a blackguard, a cut-throat," said the
scholar, "and excommunicate by His Holiness. Wherefore should
this knight, who is considered the pattern of chivalry and called
the English Paragon, assist him?"</p>

<p>"He pursues glory," replied the stranger again with a
deepening smile. He looked shrewdly at the young clerk and said:
"Perhaps you, sir, also pursue glory, but in a different manner?
You look as if you had been sitting up all night, or at least
till very late. Perhaps you are writing a book, a poem, a
romance, or a philosophical treatise?"</p>

<p>Philippe Braye blushed and shook his head, nervously pulling
at the slice of new bread.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, nothing of the kind. I am but a miserable scribe
and have been copying for a livelihood some wretched law
documents."</p>

<p>The stranger looked round at the poor smoky house, to the
ladder of steps to the upper story, and at the great shabbiness
of the clerk's attire. He asked him if he wrote a fair hand and,
maybe, knew how to decorate a book with pictures and borders?</p>

<p>Philippe Braye replied that he had learnt something of this
but could find no employment.</p>

<p>"Maybe," remarked the stranger, "I can do you some service in
that direction. It is curious," he added, "that I should have met
you. I also had an ill night. My name is Peter of Blois. I am in
charge of the clerks who work for the King. They are writing in
painted books at the palace, and one of them has fallen ill with
a disease in his leg which gives him no rest, so that he cannot
work, and another has been overcast in his sight through too much
application to his study and there has been some trouble to
finish the book which was to be put before His Majesty to-morrow.
So I have much to think of," he added with a smile. "Fetch me
down your work and let me see if I may give you some
employment."</p>

<p>Philippe Braye ran up the ladder eagerly and into the small
room where lay his humble couch and where stood his humble table.
He carried down some sheets of the law vellum and, trembling with
excitement, showed them to Peter of Blois, who was still eating
his new bread.</p>

<p>The scholar took the work to the window. The mournful sunlight
was hidden by the high wintry clouds.</p>

<p>The lettering was neat, the flourishes exact, and Philippe
Braye had put in a sheet of drawings which he had done for love
in his short leisure when he was not too weary. It showed the
Virgin in a robe of ultramarine blue, seated on a hill of
Paradise, planted with little trees which were like those that
Philippe thought he could remember on the farm near Calais which
had been burnt by the English when he was a child. In the
background was a sea of a paler blue, much, he believed, as he
could recall of that beyond the great walled town before the
English landed. Beside it, a palace of pinkish coloured stone
with a standard above it, and a company of angels coming out
white-robed, with violet cloaks, bordered and studded with brown,
which would have been gold if Philippe Braye could have afforded
that precious metal.</p>

<p>He stood trembling with eagerness while the great man examined
his work. He believed that if nothing came of this chance he
would hardly be able to endure the grey chill day...</p>

<p>Raynold the baker began to pile up his loaves on the wooden
trestle. He too was rather excited. He thought that if the clerk
got some better employment he would be able to pay him, perhaps,
a higher rent.</p>

<p>"The work is good," said Peter of Blois gravely, "come with me
at once to the palace."</p>

<p>Philippe Braye had no preparation to make. He was too agitated
to finish his slice of new bread. But Peter of Blois had
leisurely consumed all his portion. He laid a piece of white
money on the board, and the two men passed out into the street,
which now began to fill with people, apprentices opening the
shutters of the shops and women going to and fro the chandlers
and mongers.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye had often seen the palace and never taken much
interest in it, for it seemed to him to belong to another
world.</p>

<p>Now he was actually passing the sentries wearing the Valois
colours who paced up and down and across the bleak neglected
gardens where the ground was layed with frost and the bare trees
hung forlorn boughs against the grey sky.</p>

<p>"All is ruined," said Peter of Blois sadly. "But if we can get
the English out of France we will build it up again. Yes, we will
once more see fountains and courtyards, statues and
<i>parterres</i> of flowers."</p>

<p>Philippe Braye thought, "But the present King is not likely to
accomplish this, he is but a weakling," and a sense of the great
misfortune of his country overcast with sadness the joy he had
felt at his own good luck.</p>

<p>They entered the palace which bore no signs whatever of
magnificence.</p>

<p>A few worn hangings were on the walls. The floors were bare
and cold. The furniture simple, as if it came from a poor
monastery. Everything of value had been sold to pay the ransom of
King John.</p>

<p>"The King," said Peter of Blois, "has no luxuries save his
books."</p>

<p>The young clerk was trembling with expectation, nervous as to
what he might be asked to do&mdash;supposing he was set some
trial task too difficult for his skill?... Supposing that in this
splendid opportunity he was to fail?</p>

<p>They entered a room that was very light even on this dull
winter day. The walls had been lime-washed and the tall windows
were unglazed.</p>

<p>Four men with rolled-back sleeves and tired eyes were sitting
at a long bench-like table. At either end of this were upright
desks with sloping fronts.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye's eyes glittered at the sight of the fine
brushes, pens and pans of pigment, at the sheets of parchment and
the shells of gold-leaf, at the fine knives for cutting, and the
fine needles and threads for sewing.</p>

<p>Early as it was all these men were intent upon their work.</p>

<p>One was copying on the margin of a page of vellum before him a
dead bee which, yesterday, had blundered out of some hiding-place
and died on the frozen earth of the palace garden.</p>

<p>On a stool by the window sat a young man turning over the
leaves of a volume already bound.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye was attracted to him for he had a remarkable
appearance.</p>

<p>He was of slight build, and humbly attired in a plain robe of
grey wool with a collar of lambskin which came up to his ears; a
plain silver chain from which depended a medal hung on his
breast. It was his face that arrested the instant attention of
Philippe Braye&mdash;a peculiar, long, smooth countenance, a
straight nose that overhung full lips curved into a perpetual
smile. His eyes were half-closed, dark and slanting. His
complexion very clear. His hands, as he turned over the leaves of
the book, were white and as fine as those of a dainty woman. He
was bareheaded and his dark hair hung in thin ringlets on to his
collar. This personage had an extraordinary air of still dignity.
The smile in his lips and eyes did not appear anything temporary
but as if it was an integral part of the whole peculiar
countenance.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said Peter of Blois, making a reverence.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye's knees trembled beneath him for he was in the
presence of Charles of Valois, whom he had so often spoken of
with contempt, and whom he had heard gossiped over with disdain,
as a weakling, no knight, and no fit Prince for a country in the
desperate state of France.</p>

<p>"Sire," added Peter of Blois, "by an odd chance I found this
young clerk who can write a seemly hand and has some talent for
painting. As we are short of two I have brought him to make a
trial of his skill."</p>

<p>Without speaking or changing his smiling aspect Charles of
Valois waved his hand towards the table.</p>

<p>"You can take your place without ceremony," said Peter of
Blois, "and work as if His Princely Grace were not
present&mdash;that is how he likes it. For the moment you will
mix colours and prepare the parchment. Presently, I will give you
further instructions.</p>

<p>The young clerk took the place assigned him. He was still
trembling with awe at being in the presence of the King of
France.</p>

<p>Yes, one might say what one would, but there was something at
once peculiar and sacred about this Valois. He was different from
all others, though he was attired with an almost ostentatious
meanness and in his proper person insignificant...</p>

<p>A young man seated beside him gave Philippe Braye whispered
instructions as to the pigments he was to mix in the little
saucers and the constituency they were to be...</p>

<p>The King and Peter of Blois spoke together in undertones in
the window-place.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye could not catch what they said.</p>

<p>Presently, the King rose. No one took any notice. They
continued their work. They had long since been instructed to
ignore the presence of Charles of Valois in the painting- and
writing-room.</p>

<p>To Philippe Braye's trembling confusion the young King paused
by his stool.</p>

<p>"What part of France do you come from, my son?"</p>

<p>This manner of address did not seem absurd from the grave
young Prince who was no older than the clerk.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye stammered, blushed and would have risen and
thrown himself on his knees, but Peter of Blois stayed him:</p>

<p>"Nay, remain where you are and answer His Princely Grace."</p>

<p>Philippe Braye then related what he could remember of his
childhood.</p>

<p>"The English," said the young Valois, "ay, always the English.
You are like me," he added, with a deepening of his peculiar
smile, which had in it nothing gay or joyous, "you cannot
remember a time when this country was not devastated and laid
waste with fire and rapine by the King of England. But perhaps
you, like myself, will live to see the time when all France has
returned to one Sceptre again."</p>

<p>He paused and his half-closed eyes sent a drowsy glance round
the young men diligently labouring at the book-making.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps, when we have got rid of these savage beasts
from among us, we may begin to build and plant and have a fair
library with pictures, furniture and hangings like our fathers
used. What do you think of that, my son? Tell me your mind."</p>

<p>Stammering with embarrassment and hardly knowing what he said,
Philippe Braye replied:</p>

<p>"How may this be got without fighting, sire?"</p>

<p>"Let us leave fighting to brutes," replied the young King.
"Men must gain their ends by other means. What have you heard of
me?" he added gently.</p>

<p>"Nay, do not stammer and blush so, my son, it is good to hear
what my people think of me."</p>

<p>But Philippe Braye could not tell him to his face how he had
heard him cried down as weakling, no knight, fool and even
coward, one who shut himself up with his clerks and painters, and
with Thomas of Pisa, his astrologer, and did nothing to help his
land, now almost bleeding to death. Nor could he tell him it was
said that the English Prince in Aquitaine treated him as a
creature of no account and despised him too much even to mention
him.</p>

<p>But the young King read his thoughts in his shamefaced
silence.</p>

<p>"You have heard nothing good about me," he answered placidly.
"It is said that I do not seek glory, that I do not know how to
lead a battle of men-at-arms on the field of honour. It is quite
true. Yet, without bloodshed, I hope to free France. When you go
abroad again, my son, and hear contempt of me, tell them that the
King has told you that."</p>

<p>"Sire," muttered Philippe Braye. "Sire, we must all have
patience."</p>

<p>"We must all accept contempt and monotony," said the King. He
made the sign of the Cross on his narrow chest. "Some men are
born to destroy, some men to organize and administer. All may
ruin a country in a few weeks, my son, and it may take centuries
to build it up again." He paused again and then added, in his
slow, sweet voice: "Do you love beauty, music and painting, and
carvings in stone and marble?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sire," said Philippe Braye eagerly, "I would gladly give
my life to these things."</p>

<p>"You are wise." Charles of Valois laid his hand on the arm of
Peter of Blois. "I believe that in the service of beauty, and not
in feats of arms, one may buy oneself a little place in
Paradise."</p>

<p>He left the room with his dreamy look and his meek dignity,
and Philippe Braye thought then that he had spoken with a man
greater than a mere adventuring soldier like the English Prince
in Aquitaine.</p>

<p>Charles of Valois went into his own small, private chamber
where Thomas of Pisa worked.</p>

<p>The King felt happier than he had felt for months, for the
news from Aquitaine was very good.</p>

<p>Prince Edward of England had summoned the Council of the
conquered French Provinces, and they had opposed the Spanish war.
Again and again he had appealed to them, but always their advice
had been against the costly and perilous adventure.</p>

<p>But the Prince had become more obstinately set on his own
desires and finally had published a manifesto in which he had
said "that he was perfectly acquainted with the faults of Don
Pedro, but he did not think it either decent or proper that a
bastard should possess a kingdom. Therefore he intended to help
him to the best of his power to recover Castile."</p>

<p>Don Pedro himself had arrived at the Abbey of St. Andrew and
King Charles had learnt of that from his trusty spies; there were
many knights and not a few lords in Aquitaine who seemed
subservient to Prince Edward but were really faithful to King
Charles and sent him careful information as to the proceedings in
the conquered Provinces; Don Pedro had been extravagant in his
promises.</p>

<p>The old King of England had sent from Westminster to say that
he would support his son in his championship of King Pedro. He
gave as his excuse his desire to protect a legitimate monarch
against the usurper. But King Charles knew that the old warrior
in London wished to have a hand in any quarrel where he might
again have a cast of fortune with France.</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos had gone to the Basques to try to induce some
of the Companies who had enlisted for Don Enriquez to return to
the Prince, and in King Charles' last advices it was said that
twelve thousand of these had agreed to return to Aquitaine.</p>

<p>Another English Prince, the Duke of Aquitaine's younger
brother, John, Duke of Lancaster, had been sent from Westminster
with six hundred men.</p>

<p>"All this will cost money," said Charles of Valois, "a great
deal of money, and Prince Edward is in financial difficulties
already." He smiled from one to another of his two
strangely-chosen counsellors, the Italian who called himself an
astrologer, and the Frenchman who appeared to be no more than a
scholarly clerk. But both, beneath their air of simplicity, were
acute, subtle men.</p>

<p>"Sire," said Thomas of Pisa, "the money you raised to help
towards the ransom of Bertrand du Guesclin was well worth the
effort."</p>

<p>"Will the King of Navarre open the passes across the
Pyrenees?" mused Charles. "Whether he does or not, I think Prince
Edward will find a difficulty in taking twenty thousand men over
those mountains in mid-winter, for mid-winter it will be before
his preparations are ready."</p>

<p>"Sire, the love of glory will inspire a man to do strange
things," smiled Peter of Blois. "He is swollen up with pride and
presumption with the vain promises of Don Pedro, who swears that
he has brought many waggon-loads of gold and jewels, and that he
will be responsible for the pay of the troops."</p>

<p>"But, meanwhile," said Charles of Valois, softly, "I have had
advices from Bordeaux that the Prince has been forced to melt
down some of his plate to obtain the money to give an earnest to
the troops. He has called up all the fighting men of the
Provinces and never reflected that he must keep and pay them
all."</p>

<p>The young man was silent for a space and so out of respect
were his two counsellors.</p>

<p>His lids lifted, showing their droop to be but an assumed
trick, and his eyes sparkled brightly. He glanced across the room
and out through the narrow window.</p>

<p>He could see nothing but a monotonous prospect of grey sky
over Paris and the bare trees. But, with his mind, he beheld much
more than this.</p>

<p>He saw the English Prince undertaking a foolhardy expedition,
passing out of the French Provinces with all the flower of his
chivalry, leaving them ready for the signal for revolt which he,
Charles of Valois, would immediately give.</p>

<p>Though he was outwardly at peace with England, Charles did not
see any treachery in this move. A beaten man himself he had a
right to any subterfuge. Besides, the Treaty of Bretigny had
never been ratified and Charles had been only waiting for the
right moment to point this out to the Court at Westminster.</p>

<p>"My good Peter," said the King at last, his face flushed with
the intensity of his vision, "how that great gross man despises
me because I am small and weak and cannot wear armour, or manage
a horse, or make men obey me in a battle! I believe he never
mentions me without contempt, but now we shall see&mdash;we shall
see! The Pope is very hopeful," he added. "He says the whole
countryside has put on new life now that the Free Companions have
gone. Pray God, Peter, and you, Ambrose, pray the good, just and
merciful God to send His angels to destroy these violent, bloody,
murdering men!"</p>

<p>The young King had never seen a country that had not been
devastated by war. He had always known France scarred across and
across with the track of a burning, pillaging and destroying
army.</p>

<p>Fair village after fair village, beautiful town after
beautiful town had been sacked and given to the flames by the
implacable Plantagenet Prince; at Carcassone the inhabitants had
offered a quarter of a million of gold crowns as a ransom for
their lovely city...</p>

<p>The English Prince had refused even to listen to their appeal
and the town had been razed to the ground.</p>

<p>Narbonne had shared this hideous fate. All Provence had been
beneath the heel of the English. The Pope himself had shivered in
Avignon.</p>

<p>All this to ruin the rich provinces from whom the King of
France drew much of his revenue, to terrorize the Valois into
kneeling and setting his crown at the feet of the
Plantagenet.</p>

<p>Such expeditions and such deeds as these had made up the sum
of King Charles' youth. Famine and drought he could remember too.
The bitter frost which lasted from December to March. Revolt,
starvation, misery.</p>

<p>But from his father, King John, Charles of Valois had heard of
another France before it had been subjected to the systematic
ravaging of the English. Then, his father had told him, France
had been very rich with plenty. Barns full of wheat, and houses
full of all manner of good plenishings, vessels of gold and
silver, many wealthy burgesses and contented labourers, carts and
waggons, horses, sheep, and the finest oxen in the world.</p>

<p>But the English had come and taken at their will all that they
wanted.</p>

<p>And what was the cause of this most fearful war, which had
caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives&mdash;men,
women, children, infants at the breast?</p>

<p>Nothing but an unwarrantable claim on the part of Edward
Plantagenet to the throne of France.</p>

<p>By the Salic law which he invoked, Charles of Navarre had a
better right. There was nothing in it but nonsense of the clerks
and the heralds trumping up a paper claim.</p>

<p>"I will not dismember France," said Charles of Valois,
nervously rubbing his thin hands together.</p>

<p>"God and the Pope helping me, I will recover Aquitaine. Pray
for me, Peter&mdash;pray for me, Thomas! Entreat God not to let
me see how difficult it all is, lest I should lose heart."</p>

<p>Philippe Braye worked steadily through the long grey day. The
other clerks were kind and encouraging. All of them, like
himself, had come from homes which had been ruined by the English
and had many horrible tales of the countryside laid waste by war
and pestilence.</p>

<p>They felt themselves safe, these gentle, quiet souls, like
birds in a tree in the light chamber of the neglected,
poverty-stricken palace. In painting their flowers and insects,
their pictures of saints and angels, they forgot the world about
them.</p>

<p>For the first time in many months Philippe Braye had work so
light, that he had leisure to dream.</p>

<p>The King was poor, the country was poor. The enemy were
triumphantly insolent and insulting. But, maybe, there might come
a time when France would be united again, great and even
resplendent. There might be a long space in which it would be
possible to paint pictures and write poems and build exquisite
churches.</p>

<p>Peter of Blois approved the young man's work. The King had
liked his drawings, though pointing out the lack of skill and
experience in the detail. Philippe Braye might stay and work for
the King and be paid a wage far higher than he had been earning
as a copyist of legal documents.</p>

<p>The young man went home elated in the evening, through the
dark Paris streets.</p>

<p>A little snow was falling and the shopkeepers were putting up
their shutters. The signs creaked and swung in a rising wind. The
ice was firm over the runnel of water in the gutter. Icicles were
forming on the canopies of the shrines at the street corners, and
the small lamps placed there in honour of the Virgin or a Saint,
flickered and were blown out by the cold gusts of wind.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye was happy. He had found his vocation. Already
his mind was planning design after design, picture after picture,
complicated foliated borders, magnificent initial letters, and
patterns in the precious gold-leaf which must be used so
sparingly.</p>

<p>His face flayed by the cold, his hands thrust into his thin
sleeves, but excited with his success, he turned into the dark,
smoky little house of the baker.</p>

<p>It was late and Raynold was already mixing the flour and the
leaven for the morrow's baking.</p>

<p>He tried to be sympathetic but was too oppressed by toil to
feel much pleasure in anything. What difference did any of this
make to him? Even if the young man was able to pay him a few
white pieces more, it would all go in taxes.</p>

<p>"So you saw the King?" he remarked. "A poor weakling, they say
he can't wear armour or guide a horse. God help us! this is not
the manner of man we want in this pass."</p>

<p>"I think he is subtle and clever," said Philippe Braye.
"Sometimes such are of more use in the world than great lusty
beasts like this Prince of Aquitaine."</p>

<p>The baker shook his head mournfully. He did not believe that
anything was any use in this period of the world's story save
brute force and plenty of that...</p>

<p>"We want armed men and powerful horses, swords, spears, cannon
and bombards." He sighed; what did any of it matter? He was
getting an old man, he would certainly be dead before France was
free of the English.</p>

<p>It was far more important to see that his dough was baked
properly, so that his customers did not complain.</p>

<p>Philippe Braye went upstairs to his dirty little room, cast
himself on his knees and timidly thanked God for his good
fortune.</p>

<p>It was cold and he could not afford a fire. But he did not
wish to follow his usual practice of sitting near the baker's
furnace. To-night he wished to be alone with gorgeous thoughts of
the future, so he drew round him his old coat, bed coverlets and,
huddling into them, fell into delicious drowsy dreams.</p>

<p>Below, Raynold the baker went on steadily with his monotonous
toil.</p>

<p>As another winter dawn broke over Paris, again the smell of
new loaves filled the dirty street.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; LITTLE BOYS</h2>

<p class="first">TWO little boys loitered about Westminster steps
hoping to catch a glimpse of the King.</p>

<p>London was grim with winter. The wan sky seemed to press over
the towers and roofs. The wide river had a sullen, heavy
look.</p>

<p>Several times the pacing archers and men-at-arms had driven
the boys off, but Wat and Williken had returned again and again
with the steady persistence of childish curiosity. The men ceased
to notice them or became weary of driving them away. They paced
about to keep themselves warm and smote their great, chapped, red
hands together, hunched up their shoulders and grumbled together
at the long peace. They wished they had been chosen for the
expedition that was to go to Spain, under the King's son, Prince
John of Lancaster... The boys were cold too, but hardy, and did
not much heed the chilly air and the grey light nor the deep,
gloomy flow of the wide river beneath the steps.</p>

<p>They played, up and down the grey steps, little quarrelling
games. Now and then they pried with quick curiosity up at the
windows of the pale stone palace, with the Standard of England
floating above, and beyond the church whose fine pinnacle seemed
to pierce the low thick clouds.</p>

<p>They did not see the King or any of the young Princes or a
great knight in armour, but presently they saw through the great
gate a lady walking from the palace towards the river, followed
by two women. She came heavily, for she was old and stout. Her
straight, thick robes increased her bulk. She paused now and then
to gather breath. Because of something uncommon and majestic
about this lady the little boys stopped their play and looked at
her, their lips parted.</p>

<p>The wind blew harder up the river from the sea. The archers,
standing together, said "there would be snow, but likely it would
not lie long." The clouds were breaking in a tinge of saffron
round the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>The lady saw the two boys the other side of the gate and
approached them. She had a very round smooth face framed in a
plain white coif. Her eyes were blue, candid and still
unwrinkled. Her complexion was a clear pink and white. The linen
of the coif lay in even folds beneath her chin. Everything about
her was precise and neat. There was nothing splendid or
magnificent.</p>

<p>"Little boys," she said, "oh, little boys, what a cold day for
you to be sitting on the steps above the river!"</p>

<p>They stood side by side stiff and shy, looking at the
lady.</p>

<p>She beckoned to one of the attendant women to bid men-at-arms
open the gate and let the little children in.</p>

<p>Wat whispered to his younger brother:</p>

<p>"It is the Queen."</p>

<p>The stout lady smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the Queen, come you with me, little boys." Hand in
hand, for the eldest was no more than five years old, the
children passed through the gateway. Queen Philippa looked at
them shrewdly&mdash;sturdy, healthy, upright little boys, with
hazel-coloured hair, fine as silk, eyes the colour of a bright
nut too, and cheeks bitten with cold.</p>

<p>The youngest stared up at her, but the eldest kept his glance
on the ground, then suddenly turned and caught her kirtle with
both hands and hid his face in the folds of the robe.</p>

<p>Queen Philippa felt a queer pang as if a little dart had gone
through her heart. She stood quite still. It was a good while now
since her youngest son had clung like that. She had grandchildren
now, but Philippa could not like Jeannette, she could only be
sorry for her&mdash;a frivolous, shallow, greedy woman. And the
elder boy, little Edward Plantagenet, was, to the Queen's mind,
spoilt and pampered. Her own sons had been different, hardy and
bold, like these here...</p>

<p>Well, well! she would never have little boys of her own again.
The elder were great knights now, riding huge horses, clattering
here and there, armed and noisy... even the youngest had been
given to the men.</p>

<p>"Come into the palace, my children." She gave a hand to each.
They ran and leapt beside her. No child was ever long embarrassed
in the presence of Philippa of Hainault. No one had ever said an
evil word of the Queen. Noble and simple, she had pleased all. A
gentle, soft, meek woman but with an implacable strength when she
was called upon for any effort in the cause of righteousness.</p>

<p>She had been not well of late and was easily tired. She moved
heavily and had not her former fleet activity in all household
matters for the comfort of others.</p>

<p>She took the boys into a room, which was the grandest place
they had ever seen&mdash;so wide, so high, with such gay
tapestries stretched on the walls, and such a huge ruddy fire on
the hearth, and such a mighty sideboard gleaming with silver
plate.</p>

<p>With a sigh the Queen seated herself at the side of the fire
and drew the little boys down on stools before her. She laughed
into their faces and they laughed back. Then she fumbled in her
pouch and drew out two pieces of sweetmeat and gave one to
each.</p>

<p>"Is not that good, is not that very good? Now, tell me who you
are and why you were sitting on the steps this cold day? See how
red your hands are, soon they will be chapped and that will be
very painful. You must get your mother to put oil or ointment on
them&mdash;see, too, where they have got wet in the river."</p>

<p>The elder boy, his mouth already sticky with the sweet, said
that their father was a boatman, that he often took them
travelling up and down the river. He left them sometimes to play
on the steps. "But this time we entreated that we might be left
on the palace steps, because we hoped we would see the King.
Father will come back for us in an hour or so."</p>

<p>"Well, well," smiled Queen Philippa, "so you were left there
in the wind and cold to see the King. Now you must do as I tell
you and warm your hands and I will give you something hot to
drink and some more sweets. Have you any toys?" she added.</p>

<p>The little boys shook their heads.</p>

<p>"I have some toys in a big chest&mdash;wooden knights, and
horses, and swords, and drums."</p>

<p>Queen Philippa's treasured chest of toys was nearly empty. She
so often gave some of them away to other children. Jeannette's
little Prince was too grand for the humble puppets which had
served the King's children.</p>

<p>Queen Philippa sighed again. She was usually very cheerful,
even now she was smiling. But to-day she had not felt anything
but ailing, nay, when she came to think of it, not for many days
past. She sat heavily, her large white hands outspread on her
knees. She had always been told, when she was a girl, that she
would think differently when she was a grown woman, and
differently still when she was old. Well, now her life must be
nearly over. She did not think differently. Everything seemed the
same to her as it had seemed when she had come out of Hainault to
marry the King of England.</p>

<p>She had followed him everywhere, even on his French marches,
even when she was bearing children. She had given him so many
fine sons. She had been a Queen whom everyone had admired, a
woman whom all had respected.</p>

<p>Now there seemed nothing much for her to do and, looking back
on her life, she could not see that she had ever done anything
worth while.</p>

<p>She called her woman and the toys were brought. The two little
boys played with them on the hearth, moving about rapidly on
hands and knees in the rich glow of the wide fire. So the Princes
Edward, and Thomas, John and Lionel had once played at Queen
Philippa's feet. Now they must have other diversions&mdash;
war-horses, and men-at-arms, and gay ladies, and foreign expeditions,
tourneys and arrays.</p>

<p>Well, well, she supposed it must be. Everyone was proud of
them. They were famous knights. But she wished there were not so
much fighting, sorrow and suffering in the world.</p>

<p>She could remember some of the things she had seen in France.
Such useless weeping through weary nights for other women and
other children! Such shudderings and turning away the eyes from
sights by the roadside!</p>

<p>War must be, she knew, it was just and right, and fighting was
the occupation of princes. But all that suffering!</p>

<p>The tears lay in her eyes as she looked at the two little
boys. Such frank lovely faces, such thick hazel hair, such
finely-turned little limbs and eager candid chatter!</p>

<p>Yes, those were her happiest days when she had sat in the
nursery before the children were taken from her and given to the
knights to train. How she had brushed their hair, how it had
shone, cunningly curled into their necks! How she had tried them
in their new doublets and coats, anxious as to the cut and fit,
watched their faces when she gave them some little gift or
indulgence. Almost it had been a pleasure&mdash;a wicked
pleasure, Queen Philippa thought in her heart&mdash;when one of
her little sons had some slight illness and had lain,
heavy-headed, in her lap. Then he had seemed wholly hers and the
utmost greed of love was satisfied.</p>

<p>Her large white hand went out timidly. She stroked the rough
head of little Wat. He went on playing, not noticing her
gesture.</p>

<p>So much suffering in the world! The priests and the nuns told
her about it&mdash;sickness, starvation and discontent among the
poor. And what could one woman do? Nothing it seemed. The world
was like that.</p>

<p>But she was bewildered. God surely meant it all to be so
different.</p>

<p>Her tender, generous spirit turned with the greatest joy to
the thought of God. How one clung to that. God was always there,
even if one did not understand, even if one became very
bewildered. God was there and some day, surely, He would put
things right.</p>

<p>The little boys pushed the toys, from which the paint had been
chipped, to and fro on the noble hearth.</p>

<p>Queen Philippa smiled. Her brave days were over. The King was
old, very old, and fallen into the hands of evil counsellors.</p>

<p>His faults had cost her many hours of sobbing prayer and
supplication. He was cruel, he was obstinate, he was lustful. She
had loved him from the moment she had first seen him. Tall,
superb, splendid, a head and shoulders above all other men.</p>

<p>With meek devotion she had followed him in his wars and tried
not to think his slayings and burnings crimes. She tried to say
it was the way of men and God must understand. "The cause is just
and that covers all."</p>

<p>But often she would lie awake by his side at night and wonder
why he wanted another crown? Why all these fair cities must be
burned, all these vineyards and orchards destroyed, and all these
poor peasants driven from their homes or massacred? For the sake
of another crown for one who was a great king already and had
everything.</p>

<p>Queen Philippa had always been bewildered. "The only thing,"
she said to herself, "is to do one's duty and not to think."</p>

<p>This last war in Spain now&mdash;if one thought about
that&mdash;a great campaign with the winter coming on, for the
sake of Don Pedro of Castile. She had heard terrible stories of
this man&mdash;if only half were true... She crossed herself in
horror. Yet her sons would fight for him. They said that he was
the rightful King and must be protected against a usurper.
Another war, and in the winter!</p>

<p>The gentle Queen sighed. She thought of all that hardship.
What things she had seen, what tales she had heard. Would there
never be an end of these wars about nothing?</p>

<p>The old King had been so pleased that his sons were willing to
engage on this adventure.</p>

<p>He had sent out Prince John with six hundred archers. Perhaps
she would never see him again. Her heart yearned over John,
although he was not loving, but hard, bold and independent, his
head full of wilful schemes.</p>

<p>A tray of cakes and cups of hot spiced essences was brought
in; Queen Philippa feasted the two little boys, and gravely wiped
the crumbs from their lips, the sugar from their fingers, and
patted their hazel-coloured hair again and again. She felt a
temporary happiness. She would liked to have wandered all over
the world making children and old and sick people happy,
preparing food and drink, keeping up goodly fires, and arranging
soft beds, seeing that clothes were aired and mended, wounds and
sores carefully dressed, people wrapped warmly and well-fed. This
was what would have given Queen Philippa the greatest happiness.
She had been able to do very little. She dare not recall how much
horror, misery and suffering she had seen.</p>

<p>The little boys were full of delight. When they had finished
their feast they ran to her knees and kissed her, holding up
their candid faces, fresh as English flowers, with the same
confidence they would have used to their own mother.</p>

<p>Everyone was soon at ease with Queen Philippa. She was so
placid, so gentle and never thought at all of herself.</p>

<p>She pulled the little boys' jerkins closer about their throat.
They were well clothed, she was glad to mark. They must have a
good, kind, careful mother. She fumbled in her pouch, and drew
out two pieces of money, and gave them one each, then took each
by the hand again, and walking heavily, labouring a little with
her breathing, she led them out into the garden. The hour, which
she had conscientiously marked, was nearly overpast.</p>

<p>"You must now go and wait for your father, little boys, and
tell him that though you have not seen the King&mdash;for he is
rather sick to-day&mdash;you have seen the Queen. Say she kissed
you and blessed you, little boys, and that she hopes you will
grow up to be fine Englishmen."</p>

<p>"Soldiers," said both the boys, and the elder added:</p>

<p>"I am to be an archer, but Williken would like to be a
spearman."</p>

<p>"Oh, not soldiers," cried the Queen on a quick breath, "oh,
dear no, not soldiers. You must think of something else. There
are enough soldiers in the world. And perhaps," she added,
without hope, "by the time you are grown up the wars will be
over."</p>

<p>When she reached the steps a few flakes of light snow were
falling. The saffron light had overspread the sky. The day was
about to end fairly.</p>

<p>A boat came up to the palace steps. The two little boys ran
down, leaping, and holding out their money to show to their
father.</p>

<p>The Queen looked at them wistfully, then returned with her
slow, ponderous gait to the palace. She sat down by the empty
hearth. She wished she could have kept the two little boys.
Strange that, old as she was, those early yearnings had not been
satisfied, even after she had seen all her sons grow up. She was
still eager for children to tend, to fondle and to watch. Life
had become lonely with the old, fierce, embittered King. All her
sons away or absorbed in their own lives. She felt so helpless.
There was so much to be done in the world and she could do none
of it, only pray, and she wondered if it was not presumptuous to
suppose that God heard her prayers.</p>

<p>The King had lately seemed estranged from her; once she could
do anything with him and had influenced him to many gentlenesses.
But now he was moody and difficult to manage, and turned to
others.</p>

<p>Even as she thought of him he passed along the gallery at the
end of the apartment. A woman was with him in a very fashionable
blue dress, too many jewels. Dame Alys Perrers, a comely clever
creature who was often in the King's company. She seemed to know
very well how to amuse him.</p>

<p>But he left her and came to where the Queen sat; Philippa rose
at her lord's entry. She stood heavily and rather awkwardly,
looking at him with eyes full of utter kindness and loyalty.</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet was still a magnificent figure. Lean and
tall, with tawny hair and beard mingled with grey, his golden
eyes sunk in his head, and the droop in one of the lids
exaggerated with age. Fierce, gaunt and proud as some old bird of
prey who has lost his strength and the sheen of his feathers, but
none of his dignity or arrogance.</p>

<p>When he had seated himself the Queen did so too and waited
meekly for him to speak.</p>

<p>Passing his jewelled hand over the silky ripple of his beard
Edward Plantagenet began to talk of the expedition into
Castile.</p>

<p>"That gives me real pleasure and joy, to think that my sons
are in the field again, and after this loathsome leisure they
have a chance to demean themselves as men. Edward too has a sharp
adversary in that Du Guesclin. 'Twill bring him much glory on the
field of honour if he defeat the Frenchman."</p>

<p>The Queen said meekly:</p>

<p>"It seems a pity there need be another war for this Pedro of
whom all speak so ill."</p>

<p>The King smiled compassionately. He was very tolerant with his
wife's womanish weaknesses. Since she had bred so many warriors,
it mattered little that she herself was so soft, nay, he even
found it becoming in a woman.</p>

<p>"And they will try to cross those high mountains in the
winter-time," sighed the Queen.</p>

<p>"'Twill be a famous feat of arms. I would to God I was there!"
replied Edward Plantagenet. His hands twitched impatiently and
his lips trembled.</p>

<p>She was quick to understand and sympathize with the enforced
idleness of the ageing knight.</p>

<p>He regretted his horse, his sword and his men. And she
regretted her children, their toys, their plays, and their little
ailments.</p>

<p>"Edward will gain much honour," added the King fiercely.
"Edward will show that he has not grown slothful nor his sword
rusty in Aquitaine."</p>

<p>"Is it safe to leave Aquitaine and draw off all the armed
force?" asked the Queen timidly. "They say the Province is
seething with revolt."</p>

<p>"Let Aquitaine or any other of my French possessions dare to
revolt!" exclaimed the King. "By my God and my soul I will smite
them as I smote France before. Do you think that if I could
overcome King John I cannot overcome this puny weakling who is
his heir? I wish by God and St. George that I were ten years
younger, and I would be beside Edward riding across the
Pyrenees."</p>

<p>"I would the cause were juster," said Queen Philippa, with
gentle obstinacy. "I do not like to think of even half the tales
I have heard of this Don Pedro and he is
excommunicate&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet did not love the Pope, nor much respect the
Papacy.</p>

<p>"Urban did that out of policy&mdash;to be rid of the Free
Companies. He is secretly leagued with France. He had better
beware."</p>

<p>"It will cost a great deal of money too," continued the Queen,
meekly persistent, "and money is so scarce now. The people
complain of the taxes. There is so much we need to do, Edward's
debts are higher than ever. John, too, is extravagant."</p>

<p>The King was sullenly silent. He had not been able to send
half the treasure he wished to his son in Aquitaine. It was
astonishingly difficult. With every year it seemed harder to
raise money. The Commons quibbled and haggled. Even the great
Lords seemed reluctant to part with their money. Men-at-arms were
greedy, clamorous for their pay. The peasants were continually
revolting. The great fat burgesses and opulent city merchants
clutched tighter than ever their pouches and their cash-bags.</p>

<p>"It shows," stormed Edward Plantagenet, "the mean, paltry
times we live in, that money cannot be found for a feat of
arms!"</p>

<p>Queen Philippa thought of the vast sums which had been wrested
from France, of the huge ransom for King John, and of all the
plunders and levies made on the conquered cities&mdash;all gone!
in tourneys, in displays, in lavish gifts to friends, in costly
suits of armour, in goldsmiths' and jewellers' work. How little
pleasure any of that had given her! All that proud, wanton
extravagance and waste. No, she had had no joy of any of it. It
had made no difference to her that her husband was a famous King,
a great conqueror, and had extracted huge sums from a defeated
country; it had not affected the only hours she cared to
remember&mdash;those brief enclosed hours with the little boys in
the nursery.</p>

<p>The King rose impatiently. If only he could feel armour on his
back again and a horse between his knees. As he grew older he
became more and more impatient with his wife's meekness and
gentleness. She had seemed of late dull or stupid; he thought her
ailing, and that she looked stout and old.</p>

<p>He left her without further speech and again sought the
company of Dame Alys Perrers, who flattered him and listened with
awe and delight to his tales of past feats of arms, his accounts
of the great battle of Crécy and Poictiers, of the burnings and
slayings in France, when he had razed city after
city&mdash;ramparted and citadeled&mdash;to the ground.</p>

<p>The still snowflakes ceased. The pale, mournful, yellow light
fell into the room where Queen Philippa sat alone, her hands
folded on her lap.</p>

<p>She tried to forget everything&mdash;to imagine again the
little boys with the heads of hazel hair, the sticky mouths and
the eager fingers playing with their toys on the hearth.</p>

<p>Little boys.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE LEPER</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER a long silence Charles of Navarre remarked
that "it would take a really clever man to get out of this with
credit."</p>

<p>His councillor and friend, Don Enriquez de la Cana,
agreed.</p>

<p>The two sat private and secret in the palace at Pampeluna.</p>

<p>Frozen snow outlined the great arches of the windows. The King
alternately turned to warm himself by the fire, and to arrange
various coloured counters on the table. De la Cana looked on
dubiously. He had come to the end of his advice.</p>

<p>"Yes," added the King thoughtfully, "one would need to be a
very clever man."</p>

<p>"If there is such a man in Europe who could extricate himself
from such a pass, it is Your Princely Grace," said the councillor
without flattery.</p>

<p>Charles I of Navarre was a French Prince who had inherited
Navarre from his mother. He had been involved in intrigues and
broils with his royal kinsman of France all his life. He had even
spent a good deal of time in a French prison. He had only
contrived to hold his own by the most careful exercise of the
most highly trained craft. There was no man in the world to
surpass him in cunning. He took no shame to himself for this. He
did not see how a King in his position could have existed on any
other terms... wedged on the French frontiers between the Basques
and Aragon.</p>

<p>"Let those whose frontiers are not in dispute and who have not
an enemy either side of them, play at honesty," he would
remark.</p>

<p>His kingdom lay directly between Aquitaine (where Edward of
England was arming for his adventure into Castile) and Spain,
where Don Enriquez of Transtamara and Bertrand du Guesclin were
rallying their forces to resist the English-Gascon invasion.</p>

<p>If Charles of Navarre kept his passes closed there would be no
war.</p>

<p>The King moved three red counters&mdash;to represent Enriquez
the usurping King of Castile, Pedro the King of Aragon who had
been won over to his side by the promise of Murcia, and Bertrand
du Guesclin the Frenchman. There they waited, uncertain, at
Burgos.</p>

<p>Charles made a chalk line across the table. That stood for the
mountains, the Pyrenees, with the famous passes like that of
Roncesvalles where the hero Roland had perished... the old story
that Charles was tired of hearing about and which he found very
stupid.</p>

<p>The other side of the chalk line he placed some green
counters&mdash;one for the Prince of Wales, one for Sir John
Chandos (who was well worth this distinction), and one for the
young Duke of Lancaster, who had come from England with some
archers.</p>

<p>Far away, beyond these, was a blue counter representing
Charles V, the cunning Valois, watching from Paris with his eyes
on the Provinces of Guienne, Gascony and Aquitaine.</p>

<p>To the south was a white counter&mdash;Urban V, also watching
from Avignon.</p>

<p>"There they all are," said the King of Navarre in his supple,
mellow voice; "there they all are, and may the Devil take the lot
of them," he added reflectively.</p>

<p>De la Cana said that he did not see how setting out the
counters on the table helped. One had already clearly in one's
mind the relative positions of these princes.</p>

<p>"While my fingers move my brain is working," smiled the
King.</p>

<p>He was under a treaty with Edward of England by which he was
sworn to do him service if ever occasion arose. At the same time
he had taken a hearty oath to Don Enriquez that he would not open
the passes to the invading army. The question now before him
was&mdash;how he should please both these powerful potentates and
earn the bribes they severally offered?</p>

<p>For guarding the passes of the Pyrenees Don Enriquez of
Transtamara had already paid the King of Navarre a substantial
sum.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Pedro of Castile had offered the towns of
Vittoria and Logrono as the price of a free passage.</p>

<p>De la Cana thought it indeed a difficult question. He had been
racking his own brains in vain for a good many anxious days and
nights.</p>

<p>"As Your Princely Grace has pocketed the money," remarked De
la Cana with a sigh, "it seems to me that you will have to forego
the towns."</p>

<p>"Yet apart from the towns," returned the King, "I do not wish
to offend the English. I think that they are decidedly the
stronger. Has not Sir Hugh Calverley, the last of those infernal
Free Companies (as they call themselves) to leave Spain, sacked
Miranda del Arga and Puenta la Reina?"</p>

<p>De la Cana, however, was of opinion that the destruction of
the two cities had been but a mere playful flourish on the part
of the returning mercenary and was by no means to be taken
seriously.</p>

<p>But Charles of Navarre remained thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Urban V has declared Don Enriquez of Transtamara to be
legitimate," he remarked.</p>

<p>"That is a queer piece of business," smiled De la Cana. "There
never was the least talk of a marriage between Alfonso the
Conqueror and Eleanora de Guzman."</p>

<p>"It is astonishing," said the King of Navarre, "how a
successful man can gloss over anything. The Church is certainly
very strongly behind Don Enriquez and Don Pedro has the worst of
reputations. He has done a good many foolish things&mdash;the
massacre of the King of Granada and his retinue, for instance,
what was the sense of that? It is stupid to get a bad name for
deeds of violence which earn one nothing."</p>

<p>He leant forward with his elbows on the table studying his
counters.</p>

<p>"Have you," he demanded, "no advice to give me?"</p>

<p>De la Cana said reluctantly that he feared they must side with
the English and open the passes to Prince Edward's army, which
would mean foregoing Don Enriquez' bribe.</p>

<p>Charles of Navarre sat silent.</p>

<p>He was a fair, elegant, handsome man, with a smooth, carefully
shaven face and thick blonde locks falling on to his shoulders.
He was always cheerful, affable and good-humoured. Some called
him "Charles the Fair," some "Charles the Bad," and all named him
the trickiest double-dealer in Europe.</p>

<p>De la Cana watched him anxiously but not without hope. He had
great faith in his master's ability to devise an expedient to
extricate himself from even the most difficult of situations.
After awhile Charles asked:</p>

<p>"Is Sir Oliver de Manny in the Palace?"</p>

<p>De la Cana said that he was.</p>

<p>The King bid this knight be brought to his presence.</p>

<p>Oliver de Manny was a French knight, cousin to Bertrand du
Guesclin, who was always ready to turn his hand to anything for
money. He attached himself mostly to the King of Navarre, who
often gave him well-paid secret employment. Both the King and the
knight were completely unscrupulous, and there was something in
their dispositions that suited each other.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver de Manny came eagerly, expectant of a gainful
adventure.</p>

<p>The King, still with his elbows on the table, his fine hands
cupping his smooth face, smiled at the knight and bid him look at
the counters on the table. He gave the names of them and remarked
on his predicament.</p>

<p>"Good Sir Oliver, I would win the towns and the money too, and
keep fair with all these braggarts. You know my sad situation. My
cousin in France intrigues against me and the English only use me
for their own ends. As for these devils of Spaniards, they think
of nothing but getting at each other's throats. I must endeavour
to protect myself from all of them, ay, and make my profit
too."</p>

<p>"How is it to be done?" asked Sir Oliver keenly. De la Cana
put in mournfully:</p>

<p>"Indeed, good Sir Oliver, I do not see how it can be done,
even by one as quick-witted as His Princely Grace."</p>

<p>"You were not used to be so faint-hearted," smiled the King of
Navarre. "Come, De la Cana, what makes you so downcast?"</p>

<p>"I am not downcast, sire, but I think 'twere better for you to
keep faithful to the oath you swore to John Chandos at
Dax&mdash;to open the passes and let these English through. After
all, I am sure they are the stronger. The English Prince has
never been defeated in battle yet."</p>

<p>"He had never," replied Charles of Navarre, "met Bertrand du
Guesclin face to face. I should say it is even betting. Don
Enriquez must have, with the mercenaries, a hundred thousand men.
All Sir John Chandos's promises made in the Basques could only
detach twelve thousand."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said De la Cana with some impatience, "if Your
Princely Grace can see a way out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have seen a way out. And that is why I have sent for good
Sir Oliver. Listen," said he, addressing that knight, who stood
keen-eyed and wary, "you will take me prisoner as if in a sudden
revolt or affray and hold me, as it were, to ransom in your
castle of Borja."</p>

<p>He paused and Sir Oliver put in eagerly:</p>

<p>"And then, sire?"</p>

<p>"And then, of course," smiled the King, "it will be impossible
for me to fulfil my obligations to Don Enriquez of defending the
passes. Prince Edward and Don Pedro will get across the Pyrenees,
unless they all perish of cold and hunger, in which case no one
need trouble about them any more, and then you will release me. I
shall demand the two towns from Don Pedro because he has passed
the Pyrenees, and I shall demand the money from Don Enriquez
because I would have defended the passes if I had not been
captured."</p>

<p>De la Cana looked doubtful. He thought that this was almost
too tricky, but Sir Oliver accepted the suggestion at once and
began to haggle about the price.</p>

<p>"You should not require very much," said Charles, in his meek,
mellow voice. "It is, after all, a perfectly easy thing for you
to do, and it will be a great honour for you to have my company
in your castle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I shall have to maintain you and your retinue."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall only have a few knights with me, just enough to
make a show of resistance when you capture me." Softly, but with
an air of complete finality, he added: "I will pay you five
thousand crowns&mdash;not a white piece more."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver made a wry face and glanced across at De la Cana,
who remained impassive and stared blankly at the drifts of snow
outlining the grey stone window-frame.</p>

<p>"It is not enough," protested Sir Oliver.</p>

<p>"It is all I will offer," said the King.</p>

<p>"But Your Princely Grace by my means will get two wealthy
towns and a large sum of money, besides credit and the gratitude
of both these opposing Princes."</p>

<p>Charles did not deny this. He merely said:</p>

<p>"If you will not undertake the business, Sir Oliver, there are
many who will, and for even less than five thousand crowns."</p>

<p>He rose and moved gracefully nearer the fire.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver scowled at his lithe figure, his smooth, smiling
face. In his ankle-length furred robe he looked almost womanish.
But Sir Oliver knew well with whom he dealt.</p>

<p>"'Tis a bargain," he agreed sullenly, "and I would like Your
Grace's hand and seal to it, and Don Enriquez de la Cana's as a
witness."</p>

<p>Charles of Navarre made not the least objection to this. He
agreed, then added pleasantly:</p>

<p>"This must be done at once. It should have a sudden air. I
will ride out to-morrow as if I were hunting for a wolf. I will
have no more than ten or twelve knights with me. You must have at
least double that number."</p>

<p>"All this will be very expensive," grumbled Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"Good night," remarked the King cheerfully, "I do dislike one
who strikes a bargain and then laments it."</p>

<p>He spoke with almost lisping softness, but his large clear
grey eyes looked hard as metal, and Sir Oliver de Manny was
silent. He knew that it was difficult and dangerous to endeavour
to cross Charles of Navarre. He had, however, secretly resolved
to try to do so. He left the King without more ado. He set
himself to work in a businesslike way to prepare for the capture
on the morrow.</p>

<p>King Charles turned to De la Cana.</p>

<p>"You see, I can manage to earn both bribes," he remarked.</p>

<p>The councillor admitted that the scheme appeared brilliant but
added dubiously:</p>

<p>"Can you trust De Manny?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Charles of Navarre, "I can trust nobody,
not even you, my good counsellor."</p>

<p>But the plan was carried out without a hitch, and Charles of
Navarre was taken prisoner to the lonely and formidable castle of
Borja. He had with him his young son and two or three attendants.
He would not, after all, take any knights, for he knew that he
would have to pay De Manny heavily for their maintenance.</p>

<p>The King's smooth and cheerful disposition and his philosophic
turn of mind allowed him to put through the winter days in the
lonely castle without impatience.</p>

<p>He played with his counters, exercised in the courtyard and on
the ramparts, and was civil to all.</p>

<p>At the end of two weeks he told De Manny that there was no
longer any purpose in his continued captivity. The passes had
been open quite long enough for any army to get through if they
were to do it at all. He would be able now to return to his
capital and declare, with a good grace, that he had been unable,
owing to his sudden capture, to defend the passes of the
Pyrenees, the which he had promised Don Enriquez.</p>

<p>"Have out my horse and my little son's horse and tell our
squires and grooms to be ready, Sir Oliver, and give us an escort
of knights."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver de Manny smiled grimly. He had been waiting for
this moment, as a dog may wait for a bone, patient and
hungry.</p>

<p>Charles of Navarre, appearing to take no notice of his host's
hostile demeanour, gave him the five thousand crowns in a metal
casket.</p>

<p>"You see, I am a man of my word, good Sir Oliver, here is your
money."</p>

<p>"'Tis not enough," replied the French knight.</p>

<p>"I said so before."</p>

<p>"And I said that it was all you would get," smiled the King.
"Come, let us go on our way. The snow is gathering again in the
heavens and the wind is chill. I have no mind to be riding long
in such weather."</p>

<p>"Nor need Your Princely Grace go abroad at all," grinned Sir
Oliver, "for I intend to keep you here until you offer a far
larger ransom than those paltry five thousand crowns. What! Do
you put no greater value on yourself than that, King Charles? Is
that a ransom for a royal knight?"</p>

<p>The King's clear grey eyes looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the sum is somewhat small," he admitted. Sir Oliver
laughed boisterously, with his hands on his hips, straddling his
feet far apart, absorbed in coarse merriment.</p>

<p>"Did you really think, sire, that I was going to let you go on
such a payment? Was it likely? You will now remain in my castle,
which is tolerably strong and tolerably well fortified, until you
have paid me four times that sum. And even that will be but a
paltry ransom and shows my generosity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or your knowledge of my poverty," smiled the King of Navarre,
not in the least abashed or put out by Sir Oliver's demands.
"Indeed, I am so poor, as you should know, good Sir Oliver, that
perhaps I would prefer to remain here to raising this money."</p>

<p>"No one will rescue you, sire," the French knight reminded
him. "You are not greatly loved in Navarre and the King of France
would be very glad to see you safely out of the way for ever. I
dare say I might get a fair round sum from him for keeping you
here as long as you live. Neither Prince Edward nor Don Enriquez
will regret you either, sire. You have given them a great deal of
trouble over this matter of the passes."</p>

<p>Charles of Navarre looked down at the ground and stroked his
elegant face. He appeared meek, composed and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"All you say is quite true," he remarked, "and it does indeed
now seem to me that the sum I offered you is not sufficient. Yes,
you are quite right. I was guided by my own lack of money, not by
your merits. Poor as I am, I can afford you a higher reward."</p>

<p>He looked up and his large eyes were blank of meaning.</p>

<p>"I will certainly pay whatever you ask if it is within my
means to do so."</p>

<p>"I want twenty-five thousand crowns," said Sir Oliver
sullenly.</p>

<p>He was a little abashed that the King made no difficulty about
the increased ransom.</p>

<p>"It is well, I will pay that. But you must come with me to
Tudela, where I have all I possess in the way of treasure. With
me, as you may see for yourself&mdash;and I am in your power for
you to search my person and my baggage&mdash;I have nothing but
the five thousand crowns I brought wherewith to pay you."</p>

<p>The two men faced each other for a second in silence. Charles
of Navarre still smiled. Sir Oliver de Manny still frowned.</p>

<p>"Very well, sire," said the knight at last, "I will come with
you to Tudela, but you must leave the young boy, your son, here
as an earnest of your good faith."</p>

<p>Not the slightest change showed in the King's smooth face. His
smile was pleasant, his eyes without guile.</p>

<p>"That is but reasonable," he conceded. "I am sure you will
take good care of the boy. Let us ride at once, Sir Oliver, and
conclude this business."</p>

<p>The King of Navarre bade good-bye to his son without evincing
the slightest emotion, though the boy was reluctant to remain
behind, almost frightened at being separated from his father.</p>

<p>"Do you think I would forsake you in any peril, my son? All
will be well, you shall be released in a day or so."</p>

<p>Through the stinging wind and the drab grey of winter they
rode to the castle of Tudela.</p>

<p>At various pot-houses and stopping places they heard news.</p>

<p>The Count de Foix&mdash;nearly as slippery as Charles of
Navarre himself&mdash;had gone into the camp of Prince Edward,
where he was being fêted.</p>

<p>Don Jayme, the exiled King of Majorca, had also joined the
English standard.</p>

<p>"Fools! to fight," said Charles of Navarre, shuddering into
his fur-lined mantle, "when they might all be warm and
comfortable at home. A little diplomacy would have arranged the
whole quarrel. These feats of arms are senseless."</p>

<p>But Sir Oliver de Manny was thinking of the booty that might
be gained in such a campaign as was about to be commenced. He had
licked his lips already on hearing of the Free Companies who had
been quartered in Aragon and been given leave by the King to
plunder how they liked among his subjects. "There must have been
a good picking there."</p>

<p>Then again in Castile, Don Enriquez had entertained them most
lavishly. Nothing had been lacking for their complete enjoyment.
Then again there were those who had returned to their old leader,
Prince Edward. They too had been finely paid. Why, even a common
archer got as much as a penny a day, and a captain a shilling. He
wondered if he should not join one of these armies, and, if he
did, which?</p>

<p>Du Guesclin was his cousin and he might look for some
promotion here. On the other hand, Sir Bertrand disliked him. He
accused him of unknightly and mercenary actions. He scorned his
own association with the King of Navarre.</p>

<p>"The Prince of Wales," jeered Charles, as they rode along side
by side through the wintry weather, "is not a wise man. Have you
heard how he has treated the Seigneur d'Albret? He bid him come
along with two thousand lances, all to be at his charge, and
never thought what the cost would be. Then, when 'twas put to him
by the Council, wrote and bid d'Albret come with but two hundred.
With that my lord was so furious that he was minded to disobey
him. But he was afraid of the Englishman's cruelty, he is most
vindictive when roused, and so agreed at length to come with but
the two hundred, yet he is his enemy for ever."</p>

<p>"He recks of nothing but what he calls glory," mocked Sir
Oliver de Manny, "yet 'tis as well there are such in the world,
for a wise, prudent man may make something out of following
such."</p>

<p>"Well, out of this stupid war I shall have got two towns and a
large sum of money," smiled Charles of Navarre. "And you, good
Sir Oliver, will have done quite well too. The King of Aragon
will have got Murcia. And the Devil, I doubt not, will have got
for his share many poor souls that will come to him before their
time."</p>

<p>Weary and chilled they arrived at Tudela, which was heavily
garrisoned by the King of Navarre's soldiers.</p>

<p>Welcoming Sir Oliver de Manny with agreeable smiles, King
Charles led him into a large chamber, where the fire burned and
the lamps were lit and supper laid on the table.</p>

<p>"Will you have food with me, good Sir Oliver, and rest here
the night, take your money and go in the morning? Or will you
have the ransom at once and depart?"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver replied that he would depart at once.</p>

<p>"What! You have ridden so far through the cold," cried the
King of Navarre, "and you would turn round at once and go back
again to Borja?"</p>

<p>"I intend, I think, to join the English Prince," replied Sir
Oliver de Manny. "I must find out where he camps and where I may
catch him up."</p>

<p>This was not the real reason for his wishing a hasty departure
with his booty. The castle was very strong and he was a man
alone, with no more than his own arms.</p>

<p>The King of Navarre's soldiers stood about the doorways and
the stairs.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver, carefully watching the King, from whom, indeed, he
scarcely took his eyes, thought that he had turned aside for a
second to whisper some command to an officer. Charles pulled off
his great gloves that were partially frozen and moved his stiff
fingers up and down, then threw off his furred mantle rimed with
frost and stood graceful, elegant in his blue steel. His thick
blonde hair, usually so carefully curled, was a little
disarranged by the wind. His fair face nipped and coloured by the
frost.</p>

<p>"It is the same to me," he smiled, "whether you decide to go
or stay."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver de Manny straddled by the fireplace, sullen, ill at
ease and eager to be gone.</p>

<p>Charles raised his hand in what seemed a careless manner.</p>

<p>Four soldiers came into the room, behind were others, so that
the door was crowded.</p>

<p>"Kill me this man," said Charles of Navarre.</p>

<p>He no longer looked soft or agreeable or womanish. His face
was hard with implacable cruelty. His eyes darkened and flashed
like the steel on his breast.</p>

<p>The doomed man gave a horrible, raucous cry.</p>

<p>"Saint Mary! Holy Jesu! How could I have trusted the sly
beast?"</p>

<p>Charles of Navarre leant against the table, flicking his great
gloves against his cold hand and watching with zest while the
strong armed man was overpowered and slain.</p>

<p>"A pity," he remarked, "that he had to play the fool, for he
was useful, but I knew that one day he would become too insolent.
Take him out and, when the ground becomes soft enough, bury him
in a ditch. While the cold endures he will keep."</p>

<p>As the murdered man was dragged out, pages came in to wipe up
the blood on the hearth.</p>

<p>Charles of Navarre called up one of his knights.</p>

<p>"Was he not a fool? See, he has lost his life and five
thousand crowns, for I intended to pay him. Now I am that much
richer. But my son is at Borja. We will ride at once, if you
please, and release him."</p>

<p>"But, sire, shall we not go more cautiously? Perhaps Sir
Oliver de Manny's men will do the child a harm."</p>

<p>"We will say that Sir Oliver is with us. We will send a
message in his name, bidding them deliver up my son."</p>

<p>The knight said no more. His immediate followers always obeyed
the King of Navarre.</p>

<p>Charles drank a cup of wine, swallowed a morsel of bread. He
was, in such things, temperate.</p>

<p>He strode out of Tudela again, mounted and took the weary,
winter road to the fortress where his little son was
prisoner.</p>

<p>The stratagem was successful.</p>

<p>The King of Navarre reflected that he could not recall a
stratagem of his that had not been successful.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver de Manny's men, alarmed at the armed force which
surrounded the castle and by the message which said their lord
bid them deliver up the little Prince, admitted the King and all
his knights. Upon his stern revelation of the truth all, in
alarm, swore allegiance to the King of Navarre.</p>

<p>Charles triumphantly greeted his boy, weary and spirit-broken
but unharmed, who rushed to meet him.</p>

<p>The severity of the weather had rapidly increased. It was a
terrible night. Wind and snow beat against the heavy walls of the
castle of Borja, where Charles of Navarre sat snug over the fire.
He was a man who liked to be alone, and since he asked company of
none that evening, he was left solitary.</p>

<p>He had taken off his armour and all his heavy garments, and
stretched himself, much at ease but not drowsy&mdash;for he was a
man with a mind ever alert&mdash;before the delicious warmth of
the beautiful tawny flames. He smiled to himself, drinking his
hot wine.</p>

<p>How well everything had gone! How easy, after all, it was to
have one's own way when one dealt with brutes or fools! He had
sent messengers to the English camp, pointing out to Prince
Edward that the passes had been left unguarded, but that it was
not his fault; it was that of the good God that he had been
unable to pass the Pyrenees in the winter. "Unless he is frozen
to death, as he deserves to be, he will have to give me the two
towns."</p>

<p>King Charles had also sent to Don Enriquez at Burgos,
reminding him that he would have done his best to fulfil his
promise to defend the passes had he not, unfortunately, been
captured by the rebellious Sir Oliver de Manny, from whom,
however, he had managed to escape and even to slay&mdash;"Yes,
even to slay," said the King of Navarre, half aloud. "How well
everything fits in!" Life was agreeable when things went well
like this. It was very pleasant to be able to outwit other
people. It was a good game when one won. The King of Navarre had
begun to count on his luck in winning. He might get those
disputed Provinces from the foxy Valois yet. On his other
frontiers he might extend bit by bit, by the use of craft and
cunning, mile after mile into Aragon. Without risking his life or
giving himself great fatigue, like Don Enriquez, or Du Guesclin,
or the English Prince, he might gain far more than they ever
would. Why, it was almost certain that Edward would lose
Aquitaine, Gascony and Guienne&mdash;they were only waiting the
signal to return to France. He admired his namesake, Charles of
Valois, small, insignificant, overlooked, in his Parisian palace,
but working slowly, craftily, secretly, like he was working, for
his own ends.</p>

<p>Charles of Navarre stretched himself luxuriously. He was glad
that he was rid of Sir Oliver de Manny. There were other men who
would do the work in which he had employed that knight, do it
better and not demand so much pay, nor become so insolent. This
would be a lesson to all of them.</p>

<p>He felt very pleased with himself. A good life, a good game.
He could not think of any man in Europe who was likely to outwit
him, unless it was that other King Charles in Paris, and even for
him he felt himself a match. Some day he might even make a push
for those French Provinces for which Charles and Edward
quarrelled and contended. He had a better claim than the English
King, and all just men knew it. Yes, perhaps some day he might
find himself in that palace on the banks of the Seine, the most
considerable monarch in Europe.</p>

<p>How pleasant and rosy the future seemed. How secure he was in
his own good luck and his own sharp wits! He had great gifts and
he knew the value of them. A pleasing person, a perfect command
of his passions, an affable address, an ability to read the minds
of men, a faculty of making others obey him, a hard heart and
good health.</p>

<p>He smiled to himself. "What rubbish it was the priests spoke
about God and the saints and angels! What a lot of old
fables&mdash;stuff for the ears of idiots and children! Why, a
man is sufficient in himself&mdash;at least a man like Charles of
Navarre&mdash;and need not regard either Hell or Heaven."</p>

<p>He smiled in complete self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>A log fell out of the fire and rolled near his scarlet shoe.
He stooped, his fair face still smiling with pleasure, and pushed
the log by the yet unconsumed end back on to the hearth. Another
log fell. The slight start he made caused his hand to catch the
glowing part of the wood. He withdrew it with an exclamation, but
not of pain. He had felt nothing on the palm of his hand. He
stared at his own flesh, smooth, white and hard. He picked up a
twig which had fallen free of the fire, thrust it into the flame
and, when it flared, put it against his palm. He felt
nothing.</p>

<p>Well did he, the self-confident man, indifferent to all his
fellows, to God and the Devil, know what this meant.</p>

<p>A leper.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; A SNOWSTORM</h2>

<p class="first">"ON my faith!" said Edward of Wales, "we have
done what all Europe said we could not do, and there is some
satisfaction in that."</p>

<p>The English-Gascon army, to the number of thirty thousand, of
which twenty thousand were fighting men, lay encamped round
Pampeluna.</p>

<p>"A difficult thing," replied Chandos, "is always worth doing,
sire, for its own sake. As a matter of common sense, it would
have been better if we were delayed in passing the Pyrenees in
the autumn, to have waited till the spring."</p>

<p>Prince Edward did not answer. He was endeavouring, somewhat
sullenly, to suck what satisfaction he could from his
extraordinary feat in having brought so many men in mid-winter
over the Pyrenees. He knew that it would have been far better to
have started in the easy days of autumn. But he had to wait the
arrival of his brother, John of Lancaster, from England, who had
not landed in the Cotentin until winter had already gripped the
land.</p>

<p>Then there had been those wearisome negotiations with Charles
of Navarre, Count de Foix, slippery and treacherous both of them,
haggling over their price and delaying their decision to the last
possible moment.</p>

<p>The Count de Foix had, finally, arranged for Prince Edward's
forces to pass over his land, and Charles of Navarre had left the
passes of the Pyrenees open.</p>

<p>But, when Edward had arrived in Navarre, he had been met by
the news that the King had been captured by Sir Oliver de Manny,
that therefore there were no orders for the provisioning of his
troops.</p>

<p>Later news had related how the double-dealing King had killed
Sir Oliver de Manny and ridden fast to the latter's castle at
Borja to release his son, left there as hostage. After that there
was no further tale of him. He was shut up in that fastness and
would answer no messengers.</p>

<p>So the English-Gascon army ravaged Navarre at their will, but
found little, for the weather was fierce.</p>

<p>"Still," persisted Edward, "by the grace of God we have gotten
over the Pyrenees."</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos saw how he was endeavouring to hearten
himself by the remembrance of that exploit, and so dwelt on it.
Yes, it had been extraordinary. How had they done it? Thirty
thousand men&mdash;ten thousand men-at-arms, ten thousand mounted
archers, and ten thousand unarmed grooms. If the Prince had not
been the greatest organizer in Europe it could not have been
done. There had been a time when, in the most narrow of the
passes, it seemed that they would all perish in the dense storms
of snow and hail, blinded by the tempest, frozen by the intense
cold, weighed down by their heavy armour.</p>

<p>How sharp and cutting had been the wind&mdash;how gloomy and
cheerless those lofty passes, so high up in the sombre
snow-clouds!</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos himself had passed first with the young Duke
of Lancaster, for whom he acted as Chief-of-Staff.</p>

<p>With the Prince had come Don Pedro, the leaders of the
Companies and Don Pedro's brother-in-law, the exiled King of
Majorca, whom the Prince (already burdened with so many expenses)
had yet taken under his protection. Well, many a heap of steel
and bones had been left on the lonely passes, but the bulk of the
army was down in Navarre and ready for battle.</p>

<p>"No one in Europe expected it," said the Prince. He stood
before a small fire in a mean farmhouse. His comely face was
chapped and frost-bitten. His flat cheeks flamed purple, his
hands were red and cracked.</p>

<p>"Do you think this Don Enriquez will give us battle?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"If he does not, we will advance and face him. But, first, we
must get provisions, and it seems," he added gloomily, "that will
be difficult."</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos thought that the whole affair was, like so
many of the actions of men, not only difficult but ridiculous.
Why had they left Aquitaine at the mercy of France? Why had they
left their comfortable homes, their easy, pleasant days, for this
misery and discomfort, this bottomless adventure where they might
lose all, even credit, and become the laughter of Europe?</p>

<p>In his youth Sir John Chandos had been impetuous and eager for
any wild affray that promised excitement. Now, he was often
overborne by a sense of the futility of aimless violence, and he
loathed Don Pedro. It seemed to him there could be no blessing on
those who fought for such a man.</p>

<p>"How do the roads go to Burgos?" asked Edward.</p>

<p>"Tell me again, Sir John."</p>

<p>And Chandos repeated, tracing the lines with his finger on the
rough walls of the farm:</p>

<p>"One passes through Guiciscoa and Avila over the mountains to
Vittoria. At Miranda one may pass the Ebro. The other is south
towards Logrono. There is a bridge. The way goes straight to
Burgos. That, sire, is the way the two Feltons have taken with
their scouting party."</p>

<p>"The last news," said Edward, still gloomy, "is that this Don
Enriquez camps at San Domenico de la Calzada."</p>

<p>"That, sire, is our last advice. The whole country is
deserted, for all&mdash;knights and peasants&mdash;have gone to
join this bastard, who, it seems, is greatly beloved by the
Castilians." Sir John Chandos spoke with some bitterness and his
handsome face hardened, for he knew that the Castilians had every
reason to love the usurper as he was called, and to detest the
man for whom the English fought. For fear of disheartening his
master, he said no word of this.</p>

<p>Prince Edward went to the door, opened it and looked out on to
the wintry landscape. The snow was falling thickly on the tents
of the Gascons and the English. All was arranged in very good
order, the troops were in proper disposition ready to march,
except for the unpacking of pots and barrels from the carts and
lighting of fires under the orders of the marshals, each man had
his helmet and bow in its place, lying on the ground.</p>

<p>The knights had raised their pennons and standards above their
pavilions. These hung straight and colourless in the dun air.</p>

<p>The snow outlined tents, waggons and piled baggage, and lay on
the saddles of the picketed horses and on the shoulders of the
men moving about heavily from fatigue and the weight of their
armour, for few had laid aside their mail, but held themselves in
readiness for sudden orders to march.</p>

<p>The little feeble fires fluttering here and there made
difficult way against the falling snow. Men built up shelters to
protect them.</p>

<p>The distance was blocked by the storm-clouds. Edward could see
no further than the edges of his own camp. He felt hemmed in and
oppressed, as if he was in a besieged town, assaulted by
invisible foes. In his mind he cursed the King of Navarre and
Gaston de Foix whose treacherous delay had caused him to cross
the Pyrenees in mid-winter. He even thought impatiently of his
father, the old King, and his young and favourite brother, John
of Lancaster, who had been so long in bringing the English
archers to his assistance. He dwelt uneasily on how he was to
feed all these men in this poor country which yielded so little
plunder.</p>

<p>Chandos, looking at him anxiously, saw that he was on the
verge of one of his fits of violent, fierce, cruel temper.</p>

<p>At this evil moment Don Pedro came spurring up through the
snow, accompanied by two of his Castilian knights.</p>

<p>Prince Edward greeted him shortly. Chandos turned away to the
fire without a salutation. Don Pedro did not appear to notice
this coldness on the part of the two Englishmen.</p>

<p>He was a monstrous figure, wrapped in harsh, grey and black
wolfskins over his chain-mail. A turban round his steel cap gave
him, in the eyes of Chandos, a heathen appearance. Chains of
jewels shone blue and red on his massive chest. His huge
war-gloves were enamelled on the back. His teeth shone sharp and
white as a beast's fangs. His flat, powerful face was whipped
purple-bronze by the cold, the curled ends of his black hair were
stiff with frost. His whole person was thickly powdered with
snow.</p>

<p>Staring at Edward, he demanded why the army did not
immediately advance, using a halting French that added to the
peremptoriness of his tone.</p>

<p>"By my faith," replied Edward softly, "here we are gotten over
the Pyrenees in mid-winter and with but little loss, and you ask
why we do not advance! How am I to feed these men?"</p>

<p>"They will be well fed when we have taken Burgos," replied Don
Pedro.</p>

<p>"Will the plunder of Burgos," asked Edward, with a dangerous
smile, "feed my thirty thousand men and pay all my engagements?
Nay, I believe to satisfy those obligations would strain the
whole resources of Castile."</p>

<p>"It is not becoming," said Don Pedro, "to talk of money before
we have come to any matter of battle or engagement."</p>

<p>Prince Edward flung himself on to a wooden stool by the table
and thrust his cold knuckles into his frost-bitten cheek, while
his tawny eyes glared angrily at the man whom he had undertaken
to replace on the throne of Castile. He remembered all the
atrocious tales he had heard of Don Pedro and how every man of
honour had advised him not to undertake his cause. For this man's
sake he had broken the peace of Europe and divided the knighthood
of all countries. For, while all valiant men-at-arms had wished
to follow him, the greatest leader of the moment, all men of
justice and sense had known that every right, save that of name,
was with Don Enriquez.</p>

<p>Speaking in a sullen voice, Prince Edward said:</p>

<p>"Don Pedro, I have undertaken to support you and to help you
to recover the inheritance of your fathers, for I think it highly
unbecoming for a bastard to hold a kingdom or to bear the name of
King. But I would have you bear yourself quietly and not question
me or my actions. Remember what I have undertaken for your sake,
what lavish promises I have had to make to the Companies, what a
heavy subsidy I have had to make to the Count de Foix, ay, and to
promise to pay him double the value of any damage my troops do in
passing through his lands," added the Prince with increasing
bitterness. "On every side I have had to make hard bargains. This
Charles of Navarre has seen much of my money, and every lance who
serves with me serves at my expense."</p>

<p>"All this I know," said Don Pedro indifferently.</p>

<p>"You know also," returned Edward, "that I have had to melt
down my plate to pay for this army gathered together to place you
upon the throne of Castile. Ay, and it goes ill with me to take
my personal effects&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had you been more powerful in Aquitaine," replied Don Pedro
insolently, "you could have taxed your subjects for these
expenses."</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet beat his clenched fist upon his mouth to
keep back the fury of impetuous words with which he would have
answered this insolence. But seldom even in his fury did he lose
complete command of himself, and he reasoned, even now, that if
he were to quarrel with the man whose cause he had so
extravagantly championed, he would make himself the butt of the
laughter even of fools.</p>

<p>But Sir John Chandos, turning, spoke for the first time, and
with an impressive sternness.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, Don Pedro, conduct yourself gently
towards my master. And consider how you stand towards him."</p>

<p>Don Pedro changed his demeanour. He never ventured far in
arrogance towards Sir John Chandos. He at once adopted that tone
of almost humble servility which was so detestable to the
Englishmen.</p>

<p>"Sire, have I not undertaken to pay all these Companies, as
long as my gold, my silver and my treasure last, which I have
brought from Spain, but which is not so great by twenty times as
that which I have left behind?"</p>

<p>"I have heard these promises before," said Edward Plantagenet.
"This gold and silver of which you speak, that you had with you,
Don Pedro, came to very little, and, for the rest, I have
advanced you loan after loan. Did I not pay the two hundred
thousand crowns to the King of Navarre? Have I not ever paid all
solely on your pledge that you would repay when we reached
Castile? On your name and your liability I advanced a further
twenty-six thousand florins to the King of Navarre as the first
month's pay for the contingent that he promised should meet us
here at Pampeluna. He had the money but the men have not arrived,
and the King himself is shut up in some distant fortress."</p>

<p>Still with his air of humility, but with a sly smile, Don
Pedro replied:</p>

<p>"But you, sire, are most unbusinesslike. You pay away money
far too easily." Then, checking himself as he caught the glare in
the Englishman's tawny eye, he added: "Have I not bound myself
under the most solemn oath to repay these huge sums, and did I
not leave my two daughters at Bordeaux as hostages?"</p>

<p>Neither of the Englishmen answered and the Castilian looked
furtively from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Have I not sworn to give you the provinces of Biscay and
Castro Urdiales in free sovereignty? Have I not sworn that all
your subjects shall be quit of payment of taxes and customs when
in my dominion?"</p>

<p>Still the Englishmen did not speak. They had heard these
promises so often.</p>

<p>"Have I not promised to mark my gratitude to the mighty King
your father," continued Don Pedro, "that all the heirs of
Plantagenet should have the right of leading the armies of
Castile, and that if they be not there the Standard of England
should be borne along beside mine own?"</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>Prince Edward stared across the mean room at the huge flakes
of snow falling against the window.</p>

<p>"All this you have promised," he remarked sombrely, "and I
hope to God, Don Pedro, you be not forsworn."</p>

<p>"I hope," replied the King of Castile, "that you, sire, do not
lose heart in the adventure. For it seems to me that idling here
smacks of sloth, and that we should even push on to Burgos."
Prince Edward rose.</p>

<p>"Whatever it seems to you, Don Pedro, I act on my own
judgment." With a flash of haughty violence which almost broke
control he added:</p>

<p>"Return, sire, to your pavilion, and do not importune me
further."</p>

<p>Don Pedro's dark hand went swiftly round the dagger, studded
with opals and rubies, thrust into his gilt leather belt.</p>

<p>"If any lesser man spoke so to me&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>But Sir John Chandos flung himself in front of him and before
the contempt in the Englishman's grey eyes the Castilian turned
away, choking his curses back in his throat.</p>

<p>As he flung out of the doorway a young knight, who was just
entering, passed him and, staring back at his angry figure,
laughed.</p>

<p>"Brother, your royal ally is a rude, uncivil fellow. I would
we had a better excuse for this quarrel."</p>

<p>This was so exactly Edward Plantagenet's own secret bitter
thought that it inflamed his already exasperated humour and he
turned in uncontrolled fury on his younger brother.</p>

<p>"Am I to be jeered at and questioned even by you? Would you
had stayed in England and our father had sent another to lead the
archers. If, on every excuse, I am to have these disloyal jeers
and jests&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young Prince only smiled in reply. He had a serenity in
his humour and a smoothness in his demeanour which were often
exasperating to his elder, though Edward loved John well.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lancaster, Prince John, called John of Ghent, or
Gaunt, as the English named the Flanders town where he was born,
was a handsome and accomplished knight, a true Plantagenet for
courage and extravagance, for obstinacy and cruelty, for
generosity to friends and tyranny towards the poor, but not a
Plantagenet in this that he had a composure in his manner and a
secrecy in his designs which made men fear him more than they
feared the open violence of Prince Edward. He was tall, slim and
lissom, with a long smooth face and hair of a paler shade than
Edward's, with well-set grey eyes, in which the squint inherited
from Fulk of Anjou was scarcely noticeable. He dressed with great
ostentation and lived very splendidly, yet his active and supple
mind seemed little occupied with things of the moment, but ever
to be casting ahead for future achievements.</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos, who did not like him, yet had to commend his
patience with the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>"Good Edward, do not shout at me and be angered. I come on
business. There is a herald arrived from Don Enriquez calling
himself Duque de Transtamara."</p>

<p>"Calling himself King of Castile," said Edward sullenly. "Has
he the impudence to send me a herald? What is his message? I'll
not see him."</p>

<p>"So I thought," said John of Lancaster serenely. "Therefore I
questioned the fellow myself. And this was all he had to say,
only a formal demand for the reason of our coming. For, says this
bastard, he has never injured any Plantagenet. And he is quite
ready to offer battle and wishes to know by what road you will
advance&mdash;by Avila or Logrono."</p>

<p>"By the laws of chivalry," said Edward sullenly and with some
uneasiness, "we should give him this information."</p>

<p>"But, by the laws of strategy, we should not," replied John of
Lancaster serenely. "For that reason I have ordered the herald
into captivity. Even if we send him back without the information
he will be able to tell his master something of the disposition
and the number of our troops."</p>

<p>"That was not well done. You took too much on yourself, John,"
replied Edward gloomily, pacing up and down.</p>

<p>The young Duke of Lancaster's cool grey eyes turned to Sir
John Chandos.</p>

<p>"Did I do ill, Sir John?" he asked, with a fine deference to
the opinion of an older man. "Can we afford to give this bastard
any advantage? By St. George! little entertainment have we, for
many there are who have neither bread nor wine already. Consider
we are here in a strange and barren country in the worst
season."</p>

<p>"It is true," said Sir John Chandos.</p>

<p>"Consider, too," urged the Duke of Lancaster, now looking at
his brother, "that it may be a great feat of arms to bring thirty
thousand men across the Pyrenees, but that is not sufficient. We
must now use our utmost endeavours to gain a battle and reach
Burgos, where we may hope for refreshment and plunder, and to
keep this Don Pedro&mdash;whom I neither like nor trust&mdash;to
his high promises."</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Sir John, who had a great respect for
the young Prince's sagacity, "that this Castilian will endeavour
to evade those same promises?"</p>

<p>"By St. George!" replied John Plantagenet, "I believe nothing
of what he says. I have no trust in his faith or his honour. But
once we are in Burgos we may help ourselves from the treasury. I
tell you, Sir John, that unless we take some such resolute
action, we and all this great flower of knighthood that follows
us are but lost and ruined, and there will be no more money come
from England further than that little my father sent with me. And
I hear that Edward may no more tax Aquitaine, nor have we any
more plate to melt. And we know," he added with his cool smile,
certain of his facts, "that in a few months the pay of the
mercenaries amounts to five hundred and fifty thousand
florins."</p>

<p>"You were ever cautious and prudent," replied Edward
Plantagenet bitterly, "and ever in the right, no doubt. Let the
herald be detained and let us break camp as soon as may be,
penetrate the passes by Vittoria and cross the Ebro, so falling
on this bastard who is so bold as to ask the reason of our
coming." In a burst of irritation he added violently: "Would to
God this snow would cease! 'Tis like a bewilderment to a man's
senses to be so confused and put about by this foul weather."</p>

<p>"Many die of it," replied Prince John composedly, "and that is
another good reason, Edward, for pressing on at once for
Burgos."</p>

<p>"You talk so confidently of Burgos, John," replied Edward in
an exasperated tone. "Don Enriquez with all Castile gathered
under his banner lies between us and Burgos. But, come, we waste
too much time in words. By St. George! I have stood here for an
hour or more and talked of nothing but money."</p>

<p>Affectionately, but sadly, Sir John Chandos said:</p>

<p>"Full of the lust of adventure as you are, sire, you do not
think enough of money, which is the basis even of famous feats of
arms."</p>

<p>"Nay, Edward was never practical," added the young Duke of
Lancaster serenely. "But I will get out of this affair with some
credit. When a man is on the wrong side it behoves him to move
carefully, for the least slip will make him ridiculous. Only a
great and glorious victory can extricate us from the contempt of
Europe."</p>

<p>"This to my face!" cried Edward furiously.</p>

<p>"This to any man's face," replied John of Lancaster, not in
the least losing his composure. "Will you blind yourself to what
manner of wretch Don Pedro of Castile is?"</p>

<p>"Yet you are willing to fight for him," stormed Edward.</p>

<p>John replied coolly:</p>

<p>"I am more than willing. I am eager to fight, for I see my own
advantage in it. I also see the peril. I wish to be
forearmed."</p>

<p>Edward studied his young brother's smooth, serene, proud face.
He seemed checked in his own anger by another thought.</p>

<p>"What is it you aim for, John?" he asked in a musing tone.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lancaster smiled without replying and the elder
brother felt a sudden stab of uneasiness, almost of dread,
remembering his own two young sons. How many times had it been
whispered to him that this brilliant and ambitious young Prince
aimed at a Crown?</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the dark and dead of night, there had come to
Prince Edward a great fear of dying while his sons were yet
children. Who then would protect their heritage from John of
Lancaster?</p>

<p>As if he guessed his brother's thoughts, the young Prince
smiled, and smote his long hands lightly on his hips.</p>

<p>"There have been enough words for to-day," he said coolly,
"but console yourself, Edward, apart from love and duty, loyalty
and affection, maybe the Crown I hanker after is not that of
England, but of Castile. This villain is heirless. Think of that,
Edward, but say nothing of it. I will to my post," he added
smoothly, ignoring Edward's stare of amazement. "It is good that
the men should see us riding about, with bright and cheerful
countenances&mdash;not shut up in houses in anxious
consultation."</p>

<p>When he had left Edward broke out at Sir John Chandos:</p>

<p>"John is for ever scheming. He has not come here for the
adventure, but to snatch at a kingdom."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Sir John Chandos. "I have suspected it since
he landed. It were better for you, sire, that he were in Castile
than in England. In the name of God, let him become heir to Don
Pedro."</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet flung to the window. Like an animal
savagely peering through the bars of his cage, he glared out at
the monotony of the snow, blotting out the slow movements of the
camp.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother of God! What is this?" he cried violently. "Why
is such weather allowed? Have I not prayed and given good
offerings? On all other occasions, have I not had fair weather
for my enterprises? Holy Mother of God! Why am I treated like
this?"</p>

<p>"It is the weather to be expected in mid-winter," remarked Sir
John Chandos.</p>

<p>"But I," cried Edward impetuously, "demanded a miracle of Our
Lady, and what has She done for me? To land me thus on the plains
of Navarre in this damnable weather, which is no gift from
Heaven, but seems rather as if the Devil had a hand in it."</p>

<p>He crossed to the fire and stood there lingering, with the air
of a man who makes delays.</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos was surprised that he did not haste to arm
himself and ride out.</p>

<p>Blacksmiths, pages, marshals, bachelors and knights were
crowded in the outer room of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>But Prince Edward Plantagenet gave no summons to any of them.
He stood with his hands pressed on his side and said at
length:</p>

<p>"Sir John, I have again that pain which is at times of an
intensity that seems to tear my very entrails. It brings with it
a staggering in my senses, as if I could not rightly think or
command myself. What may it be?"</p>

<p>The glance of the two friends met. Sir John Chandos made the
sign of the Cross.</p>

<p>"I will see again," said Edward, "that monk who came with Don
Pedro&mdash;that last medicine he gave me eased me."</p>

<p>"God help us," thought Sir John Chandos, with a sinking heart,
"if you should become a sick man."</p>

<p>And Edward Plantagenet began instantly to speak of other
things. He talked of the pass at Roncesvalles which they had come
through when they had crossed the Pyrenees, and recalled the
story of Roland.</p>

<p>"That was the Golden Age, Sir John; that was the blooming time
of chivalry and knighthood. Would I had lived then&mdash;not in
these days when all is business, and money, and intrigues."</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder, glaring angrily at the snow
beyond the small window.</p>

<p>"Would to God I had lived then!" he repeated.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; NAJERA</h2>

<h3>THE CAMP OF DON ENRIQUEZ</h3>

<p class="first">Don Enriquez, Duque de Transtamara, by the will
of the people of Castile, the Pope at Avignon and the King of
France&mdash;King of Castile and Leon&mdash;read the letter which
Prince Edward had sent him, after many weeks, by his
long-detained herald.</p>

<p>With him were his two brothers, Don Sancho and Don Tello (whom
he had lately created Counts), and Bertrand du Guesclin the
French captain, who, anxiously and even desperately expected, had
at last made his way up from Provence.</p>

<p>Don Enriquez sat in a pavilion of saffron-coloured silk.</p>

<p>It was early April. The fierce boisterousness of the winter
had a little departed. There was pale sunshine in the air and the
snow was melting in the valleys.</p>

<p>Don Enriquez turned his letter about, then read it aloud to
the three men standing behind him, smiling a little sadly the
while as a man who gets no more than he had expected, and not so
much as he had hoped.</p>

<p>This was the letter that Edward Prince of Wales, Duke of
Aquitaine, sent to the Castilian Pretender:</p>

<p><br>
"<i>Right-puissant and right-honoured Enriquez, who are called
Duque de Tanstamara, also called in your present letter, King of
Castile,&mdash; </i></p>

<p><i>We have well heard the contents of your noble letter that
are both gracious and gentle of which the tenor is for the truth,
that you would willingly know why we are in alliance and have
pledged our faith with your enemy whom we hold as our friend.
Know that we ought to do this to uphold the old alliances which
have been in times past, and for love, and for pity, and to
maintain the right, for you ought to understand in your heart
that it is not right that a bastard should be King. Nor should
men agree to the disinheriting of a rightful heir who is of
lawful wedlock. </i></p>

<p><i>Let me advise you on another point, since you are so highly
esteemed and held to be so valiant, that you should on each side
come to terms to which I would willingly lend assistance and
would agree, for my part, that in Castile you should have a
share. But reason and justice demand that you should give up the
Crown. Thus might then be fostered a good peace between you. And
as to my entering Spain know that myself and my Company will, by
the help of God, enter just in that place which it shall please
us to enter without asking leave."</i></p>

<p><br>
SAVE for the sudden arrogance of that last sentence, the
letter was all courtesy and seemed to show moderation and a
desire for peace. But Don Enriquez could not avoid remarking that
Prince Edward had refrained from sending his reply until he had
accomplished all his strategy and the two armies were face to
face, so that no man with blood in his body could refuse to
fight.</p>

<p>The Castilian sat silent and Don Sancho, his younger brother,
picked up the letter and read it through to himself. The three
young men were stung by the cruel reference to their birth, and
Don Enriquez began to defend himself before Bertrand du
Guesclin.</p>

<p>"The Pope has acknowledged that I am legitimate, and who is
this Don Pedro? Everyone knows that he is but a Jew who calls
himself King of Castile. Is he to be placed by foreign force on
our throne? What say you to this?" And he turned round in his
seat and looked sharply at the French knight.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin, who cared nothing for either of the pretenders to
the Castilian throne, base-born or not, replied easily:</p>

<p>"What matters for what he puts in his letter, sire? Myself,
who am a Frenchman and for all French knights who follow me, that
has nothing to do with the matter. You know very well, sire, that
it is only by chance we fight for Castile. Deep in our hearts is
a long hatred of the English. This, for us, is but an episode in
a war of many years. It is because of this that you have the
assistance of so many French knights who are happy to serve
you."</p>

<p>Don Enriquez sighed.</p>

<p>"What evil fortune have I had," he complained, "that this
Pedro should receive such help from so valiant and determined a
knight as the Prince of Wales, when he might have gone begging
over all Europe and returned barehanded, finding none to second
so vile a cause? What can be the motives of this high
Prince?"</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Bertrand du Guesclin, "all Europe wonders as
to his motives. Some say he does it for pure lust of adventure
and weariness of his long inactivity in Aquitaine, and some,"
added the Frenchman with a deepening smile on his frog-like face
and a brightening gleam in his small, intelligent eyes, "say he
does it out of joy to have a trial of arms with me."</p>

<p>"He is crafty as well as valiant," mused Don Enriquez. "See
how he has outmanoeuvred us and kept us under the watchful eyes of
his scouts, and we have not been able to discover what are his
devices. Not only has he been able to turn my line of passes, but
he has menaced my communications with Burgos and made himself
master of the most rich valleys of the Najerilla, where, by my
faith! I think that his men will not lack good feeding and fair
plunder."</p>

<p>"If I had joined you sooner, sire," remarked Bertrand du
Guesclin with regret, "I would have warned you that while he
seemed perpetually to be drawing himself up in battle array to
tempt you he was secretly making preparations to surprise you.
But now there is no need to talk further. We are face to face and
must fight."</p>

<p>But Don Enriquez did not at once accede to this. He was not a
man of war and a battle for battle's sake had no attraction for
him.</p>

<p>It had been his keen desire to enjoy his crown in peace, to
protect and improve his country, and to gain the love of his
subjects by a wise ministration of the law.</p>

<p>Don Enriquez of Transtamara was just, wise, valiant and
honourable, and it seemed to him horrible that this foreign
Prince should endeavour to thrust upon Castile the bloody tyrant
who had once with loathing been cast out. Well did he
know&mdash;for often had Du Guesclin warned him&mdash;of the
might and power of the Prince of Wales and of the rich flower of
Gascon and English knighthood that followed him, and of the fame
and force of the English bowmen and lancers, and he pondered what
the result would be if the invincible Edward added one more
victory to his record, and Don Pedro be again master in
Castile.</p>

<p>Hideous and fell would be his revenge, and all who had
supported Don Enriquez would expect a bloody death.</p>

<p>Therefore Don Enriquez, rising up between his two brothers,
said slowly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps we might take this noble Prince's advice and try to
come to some compromise which will spare devastation and the loss
by war. I have no mind to see men slaughtered in my quarrel.
Perhaps we can obtain from this villain, Don Pedro, such
guarantees as will ease the country from his tyrannies in
future."</p>

<p>The two young brothers, who were also earnest and
conscientious and by no means avid for vainglory, gave a
murmuring support to these views, but Bertrand du Guesclin
laughed in the King's face.</p>

<p>"Have I come, spending myself in toilsome marches from
Provence, have I wrung a blessing from the old Pope, have I
engaged with extravagant promises the services of the Free
Companies, to turn back in the face of the enemy? Sire, you do
not think of what you say. No doubt you are downcast by the fame
of the Prince of Wales. But, think you, sire, you have behind you
the Pope of Rome, the King of France and myself. Your subjects
love you and have all rallied to your standard."</p>

<p>"My cause, at least, is just," said Don Enriquez doubtfully,
and crossed himself on brow and breast.</p>

<p>"Confound the justness of the cause," replied Du Guesclin
good-humouredly. "What is more important is that your men
outnumber his by several thousands, and if, with all these
advantages, sire, you decide to resign your crown without a fight
for it, why, I am sorry I put myself to the trouble of being
ransomed to the help of such a Prince.</p>

<p>He spoke in a tone of rallying good-humour and Don Enriquez
could not avoid smiling in return.</p>

<p>"We will offer battle, Du Guesclin," he conceded simply. "You
know that I have always been guided by you in everything."</p>

<p>"You will consider, sire," replied Du Guesclin candidly and
earnestly, "that I do not presage a complete victory. Nay, I
would not be over-confident, but if we fail, it will at least be
said that we have striven valiantly. Nay, bear witness," and he
smiled into the faces of the three Princes, "that I would make no
great boast, for well I know who rides with the Prince of
Wales&mdash;in truth he has the flower of chivalry, the flower of
bachelry, the best men-at-arms in the world."</p>

<p>"Would you make me fearful, Monsieur Bertrand, before we come
to the proof?" smiled Don Enriquez.</p>

<p>And the Frenchman replied:</p>

<p>"It matters not if you are fearful or no, sire, for in honest
truth you have no choice but to give this battle. None but a fool
would be for a compromise. For whatever promises Don Pedro may
make, well you know he would not keep them. Nay, not even with
the Prince of Wales to overplead him. Therefore, we must even
fight for it. And I would have it, sire, that we offer battle in
front of the little river, Najerilla. For that reason I will put
your army in battle array. Prince Edward's scouts watch us, and
that keenly."</p>

<p>The French Captain left the three brothers and went about his
work.</p>

<p>Don Enriquez turned to the other two and remarked:</p>

<p>"You see, we are as naught; it lies between Du Guesclin and
Edward of Wales."</p>

<p>"It is no matter who gets the glory," said Don Sancho, "if
Castile may be relieved of this tyrant."</p>

<p>They could scarce bring themselves to give Don Pedro his name,
for it was accursèd on their lips, he having slain their mother,
the beautiful Eleanora de Guzman, and many of their brethren,
besides having committed deeds of so black a horror that scarcely
they might be told in the light of day.</p>

<p>Well the three brothers knew what would be in store for them
should they by the chance of battle fall into the hands of Don
Pedro, who had even now with him the cursed witch-woman, Maria de
Padilla, who, helped doubtless by the Devil, had survived even
the perils of the icy passage across the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>They were handsome, slim, upright young men, full of grace and
fire, with sensitive lips, hair and eyes black as the raven's
wing.</p>

<p>All of them had spent the night in prayer to the amused
disapproval of Bertrand du Guesclin, who said that on such an
occasion&mdash;that is, the night before a battle&mdash;hours of
good sleep served a man better than wearing out his strength upon
his knees. And that if Almighty God had half the sense with which
one might credit an average human being He would understand as
much.</p>

<p>The three brothers embraced, not without sincere affection,
and exchanged the amulets containing holy relics that hung round
their necks, and swore on the hilt of their swords to be true to
each other in the coming engagement, and each further vowed that
if one fell to avenge him. Then they left the saffron silk
pavilion and were comforted by the sweetness of the April air and
the day which became warmer with the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>The fields and the orchards and the heath about them were
fragrant with the first blooms. Tufts of flowers, small and
exquisite, rose among the patches of dry grass and the still
half-melted snow.</p>

<p>At daybreak the Castilian force crossed the little river and
was drawn up by Du Guesclin in full battle array, two leagues
before the small town of Najera. In the vaward Du Guesclin
commanded fifteen hundred picked French knights and a fine body
of Castilian men-at-arms, among which were the famous Knights of
the Scarf under the command of Don Sancho, Enriquez's brother.
This first line was supported by two thousand men-at-arms, with a
strong detachment of Genoese bowmen, on the flank. The second
line was under the command of Don Enriquez himself and was
composed of three divisions of cavalry. To the left, under the
King's other brother, Don Tello, were some thousand men-at-arms
and two thousand genetors, or light horsemen.</p>

<p>Under Don Enriquez's own command were some fifteen hundred
chosen knights, and the right division was led by the High
Chamberlain of Castile, that Gomez Carillo de Quintania who had
betrayed Don Pedro; he commanded a thousand men-at-arms and two
thousand light horsemen.</p>

<p>The third line or reserve was composed of Spanish infantry at
least ten thousand strong, but ill-trained and unreliable. This
army was summoned to arms at midnight on the Friday, 2nd April,
and at daybreak their advance commenced, for Du Guesclin was
eager to get clear of the orchards, farms and undulating woods
round Najera and out on to the open heath, so that his cavalry
might have good scope for action.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were all in good fettle. Du Guesclin had ordered
that the men be rationed well and rested. They were full fed,
finely clothed and armed, the horsemen handsomely mounted on
magnificent Spanish stallions; the silk cloth, velvet and gilded
poles of the pennons, standards and banners made an imposing
array with the devices of the chivalry of France, Castile and
Leon, and those of the Free Companies.</p>

<p>The pale light of the feeble daybreak flashed from armour and
helm. The Spaniards' mail was light, after the Moorish fashion.
And their imposing ranks were rendered gay by the gauze and silk
scarves worn by the knights, either tied across breast and
shoulder over the jupon, or wound round the bottom of the
helm.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin, mounted on a heavy grey war-horse (it was
difficult to find a charger that could bear his full weight when
he was in mail), looked a monstrous figure in the faint grey of
dawn-light, as he rode ahead of the gallant pomp of France and
Castile. The Breton was indifferent to his appearance. His
armour, though well-cleaned and scoured, was dented and
unornamented. He wore on his helm nothing but a wreath of his
colours, but his gigantic size and majestic bearing well fitted
him to lead this magnificent army, and all eyes turned to him
with confidence.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin's heart was high and behind his vizor he smiled
with pleasure as he thought of the conflict to come, when he
should at last try conclusions with the famous Prince of
Wales.</p>

<p>Pleasant in his nostrils was the fragrance of the budding
orchard, the perfume of the heath and the odour of fresh green
growing weeds in the fields near by&mdash;gracious and pleasant
all this, although he was eager to destroy, in the tumult of a
bloody conflict, all these fair evidences of a peaceful
countryside offering rest, refreshment and joy to man.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin received from his scouts information of the
movements of the Prince of Wales, who was advancing cautiously
(his approach covered by parties of light horsemen), not along
the direct road to Najera, but behind rolling heathland which
screened his advance on the right of the highway.</p>

<p>The sun broke through veils of light chill clouds, a fair
breeze passed through the blossoms of the trees in the orchards.
Nearly all the snow had melted during the night, but here and
there, in pits and hollows, thin crackles of ice remained. The
scene was pale, peaceful and silent, save only for the tramp of
men's feet and the noise of the advance of the armoured
horsemen.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin, leaning forward in the saddle, peered through the
slits in his vizor at the low swelling hills above which the
enemy must appear.</p>

<p>He had dressed his ranks, and sent his marshals to bid all the
knights adjust their armour. He had bid the banners advance and
the trumpets sound. He was confident that Don Enriquez and Don
Tello behind him would support him well, though he looked upon
the ten thousand Spanish infantry as little better than useless,
knowing them to be sudden and frantic in action, but soon
discouraged.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin bid his standard-bearer lift higher the great
banner of France which, side by side with that of Castile, rode a
pace or two ahead of him. He wished the breeze were stronger to
blow out defiantly the heavy folds of silk.</p>

<p>The light clouds suddenly dispersed about the sun. At that
moment Du Guesclin saw, coming over the crest of the hill, the
spearheads of the English banners and lances.</p>


<h3>THE CAMP OF PRINCE EDWARD</h3>

<p class="first">THE English Prince had maoeuvred most skilfully
to bring his troops down from the bleak and barren uplands, into
the flat valley by the river of Najerilla.</p>

<p>When he had seen that Don Enriquez could not be tempted from a
position which was far too redoubtable to be attacked, he had
broken up his camp at Vittoria and marched south, crossing the
Sierra de Cantabria at La Guardia, and after forty-eight hours
forced marching, had reached the Ebro at Viana. Hence he had
moved to Logrono, crossed the river by the bridge, shaken off the
Spanish scouts, encamped at his ease and in the position where he
wished to be, at Navarette.</p>

<p>From there he had dispatched the long-imprisoned herald of Don
Enriquez with his answer. When he received no reply he knew that
the Castilian usurper, as he named him, meant to fight. The two
armies took their brief rest but a couple of leagues apart, and
all knew that there must be a great battle on the morrow.</p>

<p>It was during that short night that Prince Edward sent for the
monk, who remained in close attendance on Don Pedro, and bade all
men leave his tent while he interviewed the holy friar. For
neither Edward Plantagenet nor any other had penetrated the
disguise of Nunreddin, the Eastern doctor.</p>

<p>The Oriental traversed carefully the English camp where all
was making ready for the morrow.</p>

<p>The men were eager to fight, for they were short of
provisions, and shorter yet of drink, and each man stayed his
appetite by thinking of the fighting and the plunder to come. For
it was well known that the Spanish camp was rich in everything
and that behind their lines lay a country richer still, with fine
treasure at Burgos and ease and plunder throughout Seville and
Aragon, to say nought of Don Pedro and his promises of lavish pay
and rich preferment.</p>

<p>So the English and the Gascons, the Welsh and the Scotch, were
high-hearted, despite their privations, and made them ready; the
knights were buckling on and adjusting their armour and seeing to
the defences of their great horses. The wisest of them oversaw
this themselves, leaving nothing entirely to bachelors or
pages.</p>

<p>The men-at-arms sharpened their arrowheads, tested their bows
and put their steel caps in readiness.</p>

<p>Nunreddin looked above this grim human activity at the pale
starry heavens which hung like a loose veil spangled with silver
sequins above the sleeping orchards.</p>

<p>A cock crowed and a dog barked at a distant farm. Light clouds
blew above the trees and seemed to struggle in the keen night
breeze. Nunreddin heard the thin voices of monks chanting hymns,
the rude lusty tones of archers and the men-at-arms joining in
with zesty goodwill. The marshal who conducted him left him at
the entrance of the Prince's pavilion, and when Nunreddin entered
he was surprised to find that the Plantagenet was alone.</p>

<p>The Englishman sat on the low portable couch covered with silk
rugs which formed his bed. He wore but a shirt which was open on
his neck and chest, close breeched-hose and ankle-boots. The
colour of his face was as grey as the handful of ashes of the
spent fire on the hearth, and drops of sweat glistened on his low
forehead.</p>

<p>When he saw Nunreddin he beckoned to him without speaking.</p>

<p>The Oriental met the Prince's tense, blank stare. He thought
to himself, "So soon! I thought a man of his physique had
resisted longer." In silence he approached the couch, placed his
long, cool, brown fingers on the Englishman's massive wrist. He
noticed that Edward's fingers clutched deeply into the silk
coverlet and his teeth were set behind his pale, parted lips.</p>

<p>"You are in pain, sire?"</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet nodded.</p>

<p>Nunreddin drew from his bosom the little wallet in which he
carried his phial of medicine.</p>

<p>Prince Edward's tawny eyes turned to this, and he said in a
low, yet steady, whisper:</p>

<p>"Give me something as you did before to a little ease me, for
I must lead the action in a few hours."</p>

<p>Without replying Nunreddin turned to a small table where stood
a small flare, cups, and bottles.</p>

<p>The Prince's whisper came insistently:</p>

<p>"You have told no one&mdash;you have kept this a secret?"</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Nunreddin, "do not bring yourself so low as to
ask secrecy of such as I, who am but a dog for your service."</p>

<p>"I am come low indeed," came the whisper of Edward
Plantagenet, "and since you know it, and you alone, you only can
help me, I must even ask your grace for this secrecy."</p>

<p>Nunreddin mixed the medicine slowly and precisely. He heard a
sigh from the obscure corner where Edward Plantagenet lay. When
he turned with the draught the Prince snatched the glass and
drank it at a gulp, then sank back on the coverlet, his limbs
extended like one felled by a mighty blow.</p>

<p>Nunreddin with his delicate, soft tread crossed to the flap of
the pavilion, and looked out on to the misty, star-strewn
sky.</p>

<p>The usual sentries stood some way apart from the Prince's
pavilions. Nunreddin could see the tall figure and white mantle
of a knight standing close by the entrance, in the attitude of
one who keeps guard. Nunreddin knew this noble outline for that
of Sir John Chandos.</p>

<p>The knight came to the flaps of the tent, his face was deeply
troubled.</p>

<p>"How is it with the Prince?" he asked, in the lowest of
whispers. "There is but an hour or so. Can he mount? Can he
arm?"</p>

<p>"The time has not yet come," replied Nunreddin, "when he will
be unable to do any of these things."</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos replied earnestly and wistfully:</p>

<p>"Who are you that alone of all the surgeons have the power to
give him ease?"</p>

<p>"I have learnt painfully," replied Nunreddin, "some skill in
medicine."</p>

<p>"You must leave this Pedro of Castile," said Sir John, "and
follow my master."</p>

<p>The Oriental did not reply. It was not his intention to attach
his fortunes permanently to those of any other man, and he
believed he preferred the life he might have with Don Pedro to
that which he might have with Edward of Wales.</p>

<p>The knight laid his hand on the monk's coarse robe which
disguised the Oriental and said earnestly:</p>

<p>"I, and I only, know the secret of the Prince's illness; even
his brother, Prince John, is not aware of it. Do you be careful,
monk, and keep this matter private."</p>

<p>"I exist by keeping matters private," replied Nunreddin, and
returned to his patient.</p>

<p>The paroxysm of pain had passed.</p>

<p>The great frame of Edward Plantagenet lay stretched in an
exhausted attitude on the silk coverlet. A slight colour had
returned to his face, still scarred with frostbite, and his tawny
eyes gleamed fiercely under the drooping lids.</p>

<p>"Will this cease, monk?" he muttered. "Shall I soon be
cured?"</p>

<p>"All will cease," replied the Oriental; "all will in time be
cured."</p>

<p>"Answer me not in riddles. Tell me if this illness of mine
will pass."</p>

<p>"Prince, it will pass, together with all human disease and
trouble."</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet sat upright on the couch and with a large
linen napkin wiped the sweat from his brow and face.</p>

<p>"Strange that you," he said bitterly, "a wretched monk in the
train of this detested Pedro, should be the only one to surprise
my secret and give me ease. But do not think that I shall fail to
reward you."</p>

<p>"But I am a wanderer," smiled Nunreddin. "I pass from place to
place and find my amusement watching the follies of mankind. It
is difficult to reward such a one."</p>

<p>"You speak like a holy man," muttered Edward, crossing
himself. "Sometimes I have doubts as to who you may be; but you
must stay with me," he added with a rising vehemence, "for there
is none other can give me relief when the pain seizes me. Tell
me," he added, getting up from the couch and speaking
imperiously, "this will pass&mdash;my illness? I shall be strong
again? What is it, this horror that claws at my body and seems to
sap my blood and break my bones? Am I under an enchantment? Has
some devil got hold of me?"</p>

<p>"Question not the mysteries of God," replied Nunreddin. "For
the while, Prince, you are cured and may lead your battle, and,
whatever your fate, are you not the English Paragon who must bear
all without lamentation? It is easier, Prince, to win battles and
to endure bitter marches in winter and all the toilsome hardships
of a campaign than in times of peace to bear the long withering
of the body, the blasting of health in the prime of manhood."</p>

<p>"Is that to be my destiny?" asked the Prince.</p>

<p>"I have not said so, sire."</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet crossed himself again.</p>

<p>"Nor have I done anything to deserve it," he muttered. "I have
always been very humble and obedient before God. I have spent
much treasure on Masses, on building churches and feeing priests,
and clerks and singers for the glory of God. Nay, Our Lady and
Her gentle Son would not deliver me so over to the Devil."</p>

<p>"It is good," said Nunreddin, "to be confident in the mercy of
God. But, as I understand the mysteries of the Christian
religion, the angels are not so busy in the protection of those
who live with all the lust and pomp and extravagances of the
world, who are swollen up with pride, consumed by vanity, exulted
in their brief strength, their transient beauty and their passing
power, in those who live, Prince, as you have lived."</p>

<p>"As I have lived," muttered the Plantagenet. "I have lived
according to chivalry and wronged none."</p>

<p>Nunreddin laughed. The Prince looked at him in startled
horror.</p>

<p>A monk laughing, and at such a moment! It seemed a devil's
cackle in the obscurity of the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Chivalry," said Nunreddin, still smiling. "Was it not said
that he who lived by the sword shall perish by the sword?"</p>

<p>"I would," replied the Prince moodily, "it might be so. I have
confessed. I have forgiven all my enemies. I have repented all my
sins. I would that to-morrow might be my last battle, rather than
live to endure what I must endure if a long mortal disease grip
me. But it is not possible," he added vehemently and impetuously,
"I have ever been so strong. Do you know, monk, that I have never
met a man who could bear the weight of steel that I could? Now
throw the six-foot lance with such agility? Nay, none, unless it
be Du Guesclin. But I have heard that even he tires sooner." Sir
John Chandos entered the tent.</p>

<p>"Sire, we may not delay forming the attack. Prince John is
already apparelled."</p>

<p>"I am prepared," said Prince Edward, dashing the thick yellow
hair out of his eyes. "Now let no word of this go abroad, Sir
John. Say I have been shut up with my confessor."</p>

<p>Sir John Chandos gazed at his friend and master with great
relief, then flashed a glance of gratitude at Nunreddin, who
waited no more for either of them but slipped out of the tent as
the pages, armourers and bachelors came in to arm the Prince.</p>

<p>The night was very fair, the air chill and sweet. The light,
swiftly moving clouds gave a misty tenderness to the sparkling
stars.</p>

<p>Nunreddin picked his way through the half-hushed tumult and
defilements of the camp, to an orchard some careful hand had
uselessly planted which lay between the two armies.</p>

<p>The white cat came bounding out of the dusk and rubbed against
his robe. As he picked it up and caressed it to his lean bosom,
the trumpets sounded from the English camp.</p>

<p>In the faint reluctant dawn-light showed the timid pink of the
apple-blossom, not yet unfolded from the pale leaf.</p>

<p>He moved swiftly away from the line of march and the open
space of heath where the two armies designed to meet, penetrating
deep into the orchard until he came to a deserted farmhouse which
stood upon a little eminence that overlooked a wide prospect.</p>

<p>The house, which seemed to have belonged to prosperous people,
had been left hastily. The men had ridden off to join Don
Enriquez. What had become of the women and children Nunreddin did
not need to ask himself.</p>

<p>There were wooden toys on the floor and women's garments
across an unmade bed.</p>

<p>Pigeons cooed on the roof and at the back cocks and hens
clucked. The barn had been overlooked by the soldiers.</p>

<p>There was food in the kitchen, the last of the winter stores
in the cupboards.</p>

<p>Nunreddin made himself a breakfast of this, and fed the dainty
white cat with small gobbets of dried meat. He then went upstairs
and stared out from the highest window to watch across the
orchard the advance of the English&mdash;a magnificent sight, no
doubt, but to the Oriental the whole affair was one of
unutterable folly. He had hardly been able to forbear laughing
not long since when, with solemn pomp, the Prince of Wales had
knighted Don Pedro and two hundred English and Gascon squires
before the assembled ranks. To the Oriental, there had been
something ludicrous in that ceremony. He had laughed, too, when
Don Tello, the usurper's brother, had attempted to surprise the
vaward of the English camp and fallen in with the convoys which
Sir Hugh Calverley was escorting; the surprise had been nearly
successful, many of the Prince's knights and squires were slain
in their beds. But what had caused the amusement of Nunreddin was
the young Prince John rushing out in his nightshirt, planting his
standard on a hill, and there endeavouring in that strange garb
to rally the flying English and Gascons. Yes, there had been
something ridiculous and grotesque about that&mdash;the men half
clothed rushing here and there, the startled sentries, the
shouts, and the young Prince, unarmed and in his shirt, yelling
up his disordered men.</p>

<p>But Nunreddin had not laughed when he had heard the news of
the little scouting-party led by the two Feltons, only two
hundred lancers and the same number of archers, being surrounded
by Don Tello in his homeward ride on the little hill of Arniz,
and for a hundred times hurling back the attacking-party which
amounted to more than three times their number, and refusing to
surrender till nearly every man of them was slain. It took a
thousand mounted Spanish knights to overcome the handful of
valiant Englishmen who had fallen, bitten through and through
with lance and javelin, hail beating on them, a bitter wind
biting them, and their blood freezing as it gushed forth.</p>

<p>"Futility," thought Nunreddin, "all for nothing. Yet there is
something even in such an action which elevates mankind."</p>

<p>He now watched the English forces deploying over the slope. It
would have been difficult to recognize in their leader the man he
had attended an hour ago in the pavilion.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, like all the Plantagenets but to an
excessive degree, valued pomp and magnificence, and well knew the
effect of superb spectacle on the minds of men. He had never
neglected anything in his person or his surroundings that would
overawe or move to admiration those who beheld him. Much of his
success and fame was due to the way in which he had enhanced his
great qualities by imposing and extravagant display.</p>

<p>He always affected black armour, polished till it reflected a
cold light like the gleam of midnight stars in dark water. In
contrast, a princely coronet of finest gold, studded with rubies,
pearls and sapphires, surrounded his steel helm. He had his vizor
up now and the links of fine steel, so exquisitely wrought as to
be supple as a veil of silk that formed his coif of mail, fell on
to his shoulders, framed his face close to the corners of the
eyes and lips. His close-fitting jupon bore the Leopards of
England and the Lilies of France, silver and blue, gold and
white, and was buckled low round the hips with a belt of massive
plates of gold. At his breast was the label of the eldest son of
England, the heavy chain of knots and roses of the Garter, on his
shield the royal arms of England repeated. His herald rode beside
him and on his standard again showed the Leopard and the Lily, so
that the Prince blazed with his own famous coat-of-arms. The
nobility and terror of his presence was further enhanced by the
three upright plumes which rose from his helm and added another
two feet to his stature. These were his favourite cognizance and
were scattered again alternately with the royal arms on the
flowing bardings of his horse. This was a gigantic beast, by name
<i>Dun Crump</i>, one of the most beloved of the Prince's
warrior-steeds, black as a raven, massive as a war-tower.</p>

<p>Man and horse loomed monstrous in the uncertain light. Man and
animal both armoured, both trapped with the same devices, the
same rich colours, appeared one creature, an embodiment of
strength, might and power.</p>

<p>The Prince was a magnificent horseman and could manage his
mighty steed so that even when both were, as now, fully equipped
for war, they had an air of ease and grace.</p>

<p>Close behind the Prince came other splendid knights, his
closest friends and companions of the Order of the Blue Garter,
and his faithful Gascon lords, like the Captal de Buch.</p>

<p>"He is not thinking," said Nunreddin to himself, "of the cause
for which he fights, nor of the results of this battle, but only
of his personal honour and achievements. And that little King in
Paris, who will never show his face on a field of battle, will
beat him in the end."</p>

<p>The Oriental, descrying from the deserted farmhouse window,
admitted however, that what the Prince did, he did very well. No
man could have given a better example of a gallant
knight-at-arms&mdash;an example of chivalry and princely
accomplishments.</p>

<p>As the light strengthened and the army came more into view
Nunreddin was able to observe the order of battle.</p>

<p>The condition of the Anglo-Gascon troops was by no means equal
to that of those led by Du Guesclin. The perils of the icy
crossing of the Pyrenees, disease, losses incurred through
skirmishes and scouting-parties, had heavily reduced the numbers
of Prince Edward's men. He had not under his command now more
than twenty thousand&mdash;ten thousand less than with which he
had set out from the Camp at Dax.</p>

<p>The veterans of the Free Companies (many of these had left Don
Enriquez to return to their old leader, though some still
remained with Castile), men-at-arms and archers, formed the first
command which was under the young Prince John of Lancaster and
Sir John Chandos. Prince Edward led the main body of some five
thousand men-at-arms and five thousand archers. Under him were
many famous leaders: Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Oliver de Clisson and
Sir Walter Shewett. The rearguard was led by the King of Majorca
and consisted of the remainder of the Free Companies under Sir
Hugh Calverley.</p>

<p>Sir Perducas d'Albret led a large force of Gascons. The
advance, still concealed by the undulating hill, the Prince drew
up in battle array. Dismounting some of his horse, he ordered the
chargers to the care of the King of Majorca.</p>

<p>Whilst this was being done Sir John Chandos came up to the
Prince and craved the rank of Knight-banneret which had long been
his due, but he had desired that it might be granted on the field
of battle.</p>

<p>The Prince received the Chandos pennon and with his dagger cut
off the end, so that it became the square banner of a
knight-banneret.</p>

<p>As he returned this to the hand of his faithful friend he
thought of the dark and loneliness but a few hours ago, when Sir
John had faithfully watched with him in the tent, and he had been
unmanned by pain.</p>

<p>"Sir John, I return you your banner. God give you strength and
power to preserve it."</p>

<p>He then turned to King Pedro, who stood beside him, dark, half
mocking, half sullen, blazing with Oriental splendour, and took
the Spaniard's hand with a display of feeling unusual to his
controlled pride.</p>

<p>"You shall soon see, sire, this very day you shall know
whether you will have anything in the Kingdom of Castile or
not."</p>

<p>The Castilian answered in a flattering tone:</p>

<p>"I have good hopes in the justice of my cause and in your
prowess, Prince."</p>

<p>At that the Plantagenet dropped his hand and turned away
again, making the sign of the Cross on his broad mailed breast.
"Thus do I commend myself and my battle into the hands of
God."</p>

<p>He looked up into the pale, sweet April sky, looked above the
tops of the loftiest pennant, the highest standard, into the free
untainted upper air.</p>

<p>"This battle may be the last battle."</p>

<p>He folded his hands, stiff in the stiff-jointed steel
war-gloves, across the arms of England, and his head, massive
with the steel helm and the huge upright feathers, drooped
forward in an attitude of prayer.</p>

<p>The marshals rode up and reported that all was ready. So the
Prince gave the order to advance in the Name of God and of St.
George.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin, coming steadily across the heath, saw the
spearheads and pennants appear above the slope of the little
hill.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE</h3>

<p class="first">THE peace of the early day filled with the
murmur of the breeze in the trees, the chatter of birds, and the
ripple of the busy little stream was broken by the terrific clash
as the two vawards of the armies hurled themselves together, Du
Guesclin's crossbowmen and the English archers of Lancaster
advanced with a force so great that the English reeled back the
length of a lance.</p>

<p>"Forward!" shouted Lancaster, himself in the front of the
fray.</p>

<p>And the English, quick as the spring forward of a wave after a
recoil, hurled themselves again on the French and Castilians. A
cruel, relentless struggle&mdash;breast to breast, knee to knee,
arm to arm&mdash;followed. The men pressed close, the English
ranks coming forward, whilst French and Castilians were standing
firm round the huge bulk of Du Guesclin. Lancaster shouted when
he saw Chandos down. A gigantic Spaniard had borne him, by sheer
weight, to the ground. But Sir John had snatched a knife from his
bosom and driven it home into the Castilian's side, shaken
himself free from the writhing body of the dying man, and
contrived, loaded as he was with mail, to stagger to his
feet.</p>

<p>The Spanish men-at-arms then began to hurl large stones from
slings, and at this unaccustomed mode of warfare the English
were, for awhile, daunted and thrown into some confusion; but,
immediately recovering, sent such a shower of arrows into the
enemy's ranks that no more stones were hurled, nor was order kept
in the Spanish ranks.</p>

<p>Thus, while the vaward was pressing an initial advantage, the
light horsemen of Don Tello and the Grand Chamberlain Gomez
Carillo were retreating from the field in piteous confusion
before the onslaught of the Captal de Buch and Sir Thomas
Percy.</p>

<p>These two great Captains, seeing the Spanish wings thus flying
down the valley, made no effort to pursue them (they being
already out of the battle), but turned their divisions inwards
and pressed on the flanks at the centre led by Du Guesclin and
Don Enriquez who had most dauntlessly flung himself forward to
support the French, thrice leading his knights to the charge,
thrice being beaten back, till he snatched the flag of Castile
from the standard-bearer and, holding it aloft, cried desperately
to his followers, reminding them of their oath of allegiance and
the hatred they bore to Don Pedro the tyrant, ay, and of the fate
that would be likely theirs were they not victors in this
fight.</p>

<p>But the English arrows flew so thick there was no avoiding
them.</p>

<p>Horse and man were pierced through and through, and the
Spaniards could no longer advance, but must stand exposed to this
strong attack, for they were surrounded by the men-at-arms in a
gigantic circle of iron who pressed on them closer and closer,
the Prince, the Duke, the Captal and Sir Thomas Percy bearing in
with deadly persistency round Don Enriquez and Bertrand du
Guesclin, who held their ground with a handful of French Bretons
and Norman knights.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin saw himself surrounded, and though he killed many
with his own hands his knights fell thickly about his feet, and
he doubted if he might save the day.</p>

<p>He was defeated, bested in strategy and arms. But he remained
good-humoured. He was never one to stake his all on a single
battle, or to consider it a glorious thing to die fighting
bravely.</p>

<p>War to him was not the sport it was to Edward of Wales&mdash;a
game in which honour and glory and riches were the stakes.
Bertrand du Guesclin fought for France.</p>

<p>He had in his mind the young King, watchful and quiet in
Paris, who was so despised by the fighting English.</p>

<p>He had in his mind too those wasted devastated Provinces, the
burnt mills and bridges, the destroyed towns, slain women and
children, the ruined merchants, the confiscated revenues. Even in
the midst of the heat and noise of battle Bertrand du Guesclin
thought of these things, and he called out to his knights round
him that they had better surrender and live to contest this cause
on another field:</p>

<p>"For, by my faith, are we outmatched and outwitted, and these
Spaniards have fled, it is no shame to surrender."</p>

<p>But the great Breton had pity for Don Enriquez who had made
the most desperate efforts to rescue him. It was no fault of his
that the day had gone ill for Castile.</p>

<p>But all had been for nothing.</p>

<p>Borne down by the showers of English arrows, even the stoutest
ranks of Castilian chivalry had scattered and fled.</p>

<p>"Look ye," said Bertrand du Guesclin, resting for a second on
his bloody sword, as a band of Bretons kept back the English
charge, "'twere best you fled, Don Enriquez. Mount your horse and
speed down the valley. I have seen Don Pedro riding here and
there through the fray. There can be no doubt he searches for
you."</p>

<p>"And I would meet him face to face," cried Don Enriquez, his
dark countenance flushed with passion. "Am I not the cause of
this battle and slaughter?"</p>

<p>Du Guesclin grinned.</p>

<p>"What mercy will you get in the hands of a murderer? Fly down
the valley, Don Enriquez. It may be, on another occasion, we will
make another try for the Crown of Castile."</p>

<p>But Don Enriquez gave no heed to this. He turned about and
cried to the remaining knights:</p>

<p>"Sirs, in the name of God you have made me King and you have
taken me an oath to assist me by your loyalty."</p>

<p>But Du Guesclin's voice shouted down his desperate appeal.</p>

<p>"See, we are being pressed back. They are forcing us to the
banks of the river. I see that this day there will be many
unfortunates slain. Don Enriquez, mount and fly."</p>

<p>The steady pressure of the English and the Gascons had indeed
driven the Castilians to the Najerilla which was in spate and
unfordable, being a narrow but deep and swift stream.</p>

<p>Mad panic which ever rides on the wings of defeat then struck
the defeated Castilians as with a thousand stinging whips. One
crying rout they pressed on to the bridge which soon was blocked,
and the English men-at-arms, backed by the archers, drove forward
into the river the heavy Spanish cavalry, the light horsemen and
the rabble of infantry.</p>

<p>To escape the arrows, the lances and the swords the Castilians
leapt into the river. The maddened horses followed them in many a
desperate plunge, and by noon the wounded men had dyed the
beautiful water crimson.</p>

<p>When the sun was at its highest Nunreddin, looking from his
high window, saw the English Standard raised upon a hillock and
the victors rallying round the unstained, untorn folds of gold,
blue and crimson.</p>

<p>But over the plain roamed Don Pedro, in bloody furs, his Arab
steed foam-flecked, searching here and there for his brother,
wishing for nothing but to slay him with his own hand.</p>

<p>Nunreddin left the deserted farm and proceeded carefully
through the orchards to the verge of the plain where the battle
had been fought, and picked up from the first English archer he
met, news of the great engagement.</p>

<p>Bertrand du Guesclin had been captured, so had Gomez Carillo,
the Lord High Chamberlain of Castile...</p>

<p>No one knew what the English losses were as yet, but very
small, less than a hundred, while thousands of the enemy lay
choked, drowned and dying in the river, besides hundreds
scattered upon the plain. "A great victory," remarked
Nunreddin.</p>

<p>The English were well-pleased. Everything was as it should be.
They now had plunder, wine, good provisions, and all that they
expected after a battle, besides the prospect of a triumphant
entry into Burgos and Castile, and the payment by Don Pedro of
all the promises he had made when he had come as a supplicant to
Bordeaux. Their losses had been small and their fatigue but
slight. Their ease and content were the greater because it came
after a time of scarcity and peril. Yesterday they had been
approaching famine&mdash;now they had plenty of good
entertainment.</p>

<p>Don Pedro, finding that his brother had escaped down the
valley, returned reluctantly to where the Standard of England was
set high above the victorious forces and, with some sullenness,
thanked the Prince for the victory.</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet had taken off his helm, his fair hair, dark
with sweat, lay pressed close to his brow. His breath laboured a
little as if he felt the weight of his armour. He looked at the
Castilian coldly and replied:</p>

<p>"Sir, give your thanks to God. To Him alone belongs
strength&mdash;this victory came from Him and not from me."</p>

<p>These words of conventional piety that masked boundless
arrogance, disgusted Don Pedro who muttered in a tone that he
scarcely troubled to render inaudible:</p>

<p>"You would not be pleased if I were to act on that."</p>

<p>But, smothering his impatience, he constrained himself to make
a request.</p>

<p>"Dear cousin and fair lord, will you deliver up to me the
traitors of Castile&mdash;my bastard brother Sancho and the
others&mdash;that I may cut off their heads? They have done me
much injury."</p>

<p>The Prince was about to answer him violently. But Sir John
Chandos lightly laid his hand on his master's arm and whispered
in his ear:</p>

<p>"My lord, have we not known from the first that we dealt with
a savage? Be careful, and remember the loans you have made this
Don Pedro, and how you must study to have them repaid."</p>

<p>Edward had turned aside to listen to Sir John, and it gave him
a moment in which to curb his angry disgust.</p>

<p>Don Pedro waited impatiently on his graceful weary horse.</p>

<p>Edward Plantagenet exerted all that courtesy which had made
him beloved among his intimates, indeed among all with whom he
had dealings. He smiled and said:</p>

<p>"Don Pedro, you have thanked me just now for the victory which
comes indeed from heaven, but we have fought together in fair
fellowship, and if you have a wish to pleasure me I ask a favour
of you and beg you, in the name of friendship, that you will not
deny it."</p>

<p>Don Pedro was forced to reply in terms of conventional
courtesy.</p>

<p>"My lord and fair cousin, whatever I have is yours," and he
added under his breath, "and that is as true as your assertion
that the victory is owing to God and you require no praise for
it."</p>

<p>"Well then," urged Edward Plantagenet, with a certain fatigue
behind his graciousness, "I beg and entreat of you to pardon all
the ills which your rebellious subjects have done against
you."</p>

<p>Pedro had been expecting something like this, and as he was a
man on whom a promise rested lightly he agreed. It was by no
means to his interest to quarrel with Edward Plantagenet.</p>

<p>Speaking in a quiet and gentle manner he begged that Gomez
Carillo might be excepted from his mercy&mdash;"For he has played
the traitor to me, he was my own Chamberlain, ay, in my
confidence, in my palace, in the night-time he would have
delivered me into the hands of the bastard." Edward Plantagenet
glanced at Chandos, and Sir John said:</p>

<p>"My lord, it seems to me that such treachery ought to be
punished and that we may deliver Gomez Carillo to the justice of
King Pedro."</p>

<p>"Even though you entreat me for the others, sire, and for your
interest Sir John, I feel I cannot pardon Gomez Carillo. He is
the traitor who has done me the greatest dishonour."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Prince, with an air of weariness, "I so
surrender to you the High Chamberlain of Castile."</p>

<p>At this and without waiting for more Don Pedro sped across the
trampled plain to the guards' tent where the prisoners were
dressing their wounds and being pleasantly and courteously
entertained and refreshed.</p>

<p>Gomez Carillo was unarmed and standing in his fine silk jupon
and hose, having his arm bound up by an esquire.</p>

<p>Don Pedro tore aside the flaps of the tent.</p>

<p>Four of his own personal attendants chosen for their size,
unscrupulousness and ferocity, were close behind him, and to them
he shouted:</p>

<p>"Drag out that accursed traitor!"</p>

<p>Seeing the contorted face of his betrayed master bearing down
on him the Grand Chamberlain cried out and turned about for a
weapon. But before as much as a knife could be put into his hand
Pedro's men had dragged him out of the tent. The startled English
and Gascons had no time to interfere. Pedro's men well understood
their instructions. Before all the gathered troops the
Chamberlain's throat was gashed from ear to ear, and his body
flung at the feet of King Pedro who only waited to assure himself
that his enemy was dead, before mounting a fresh horse and
galloping off towards Burgos to enjoy his triumph.</p>

<p>When the news of the murder of the Grand Chamberlain was
brought to Edward Plantagenet he fell into an anger against Don
Pedro that Sir John Chandos could scarce restrain him&mdash;it
was not for the cruelty of the thing, nor the cold-bloodedness,
for many a murder and massacre had he witnessed&mdash;but this
was an affront to the laws of chivalry, and seemed to make a mock
of the promise he had obtained from the Castilian.</p>

<p>"We too will go to Burgos," he declared when he could control
himself. "We will hold our court there and let all men know who
has gotten this victory." "Ay, and who must be paid for it,"
added Sir John Chandos gravely. For he was one as prudent as
valiant, and knew his master's reckless habit and thoughtless
ways. He could foresee that they were as good as ruined if Don
Pedro did not keep his promise to repay the money advanced to him
and to satisfy the troops.</p>

<p>The following day was the festival of Easter and the morning
was one of fair sunshine.</p>

<p>Nunreddin smiled in his cowl to see the Christian priest
celebrating the Resurrection of the God of Love amid the corpses
of the fallen and the writhing bodies of the dying, slain
hideously by their fellow-creatures on a sweet day of Spring, for
no reason whatever.</p>

<p>Most of all Nunreddin pitied the mangled horses who had had no
choice in this quarrel.</p>

<p>The air was full of chants and bells, and Edward Plantagenet
took his part in the holy service very piously.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE POT OF GREEN GINGER</h2>

<p class="first">THE councillors of Rodez looked at each other
forlornly with the air of men at a loss, almost at the end of
their resources.</p>

<p>At their modest council-board was a noble and unexpected
visitor, the Count of Armagnac who, before the Treaty of
Bretigny, had been the Lieutenant of the King of France in
Languedoc. But, with the final delivery of Aquitaine to the
English, this great noble and mighty baron had sworn allegiance
to the Prince of Wales. He had then helped him in the Spanish
campaign and been one of the captains at Najera. Now he had come
to the council-chamber of the town of Rodez, and, cautious and
prudent as he was, he was giving advice which did not seem to be
the advice of a friend of the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>"If you cannot pay such a tax," he said smiling, "you must say
so."</p>

<p>"But the three estates have voted it," replied one of the
councillors timidly.</p>

<p>Armagnac answered immediately:</p>

<p>"Yes, under pressure and fear of the Prince. They have to be
convoked twice, and I myself and other of the great barons have
entered a protest and said that we will not pay without further
advice. Nay, Sir John Chandos, the Englishman himself, protested.
I myself saw him entreat his master, with tears in his eyes, to
forego this tax, and when the Plantagenet turned from him he
asked leave, which was granted coldly enough, to visit his
estates in the Cotentin. Sire," added Armagnac, with emphasis, "I
tell you this tax will be resisted throughout the whole of
Aquitaine&mdash;not only by the knights, but by the merchants and
common people."</p>

<p>The tax of which Armagnac spoke was the hearth tax, or
<i>fouage</i>, which the Prince had lain upon Aquitaine on his
return from Castile, and which was even more bitterly unpopular
than the Spanish war.</p>

<p>The councillors sat drooping, dubious, reluctant. How dare
they offend this great Prince who had won three such glorious
victories? Who everyone said was the mirror and pattern of
chivalry! What did they know of all these underhand intrigues
going on among the knights and barons? What indeed did they
greatly care if they were governed by Charles of France or Edward
of England? They dreaded war, but peace also seemed full of
dangers and difficulties.</p>

<p>"Alack, sir," cried one, fixing his small timorous eyes on
Armagnac, "how may one refuse a mighty Prince like this Edward
Plantagenet? If we will not pay his taxes we may all go to
prison."</p>

<p>Another, looking at the lord with deep respect, said:</p>

<p>"Sir, enlighten our dullness by a true state of the affair.
You were with Prince Edward in Castile, perhaps you may tell us
if it be true, as we have heard it asserted, that this Don Pedro
will by no means repay the funds that were advanced him nor
indeed any of his debts?"</p>

<p>"So much is true," replied Armagnac dryly. "Although he took
oath in the great church at Burgos to repay every white piece
which had been advanced to him, yet soon after he escaped to
Seville and from there defied us all, saying he could pay nothing
because the Free Companies were ravaging his country and had
already attacked and overthrown three convoys of treasure he was
sending to our camp. Sirs, it was a lie."</p>

<p>"We can expect then," lamented another councillor dismally,
"nothing from this King, and there is no hope of obtaining from
him any of the huge sums spent on this most accursed
expedition?"</p>

<p>"There is none," said Armagnac definitely, "and we all hold
ourselves deceived, inasmuch as we undertook to arm our men and
place them at the disposal of Prince Edward for a given sum,
which none of us have as yet received. And to tax the country to
pay us is not what was in the bargain. It should come from other
sources."</p>

<p>"But if Prince Edward has no other means?" objected one of the
councillors, "they say he has no more gold or silver left in his
household."</p>

<p>"But he goes very magnificently," sneered the Count, "nor does
the Princess, his wife, stint herself with her jewels and
display. It seems that he will keep up his reputation for being
expensive and extravagant, even though we in Gascony have no beds
to sleep on, nor anything but dry bread to put in our mouths. It
was all very well when the old King governed us from Westminster,
but since we have had this Paragon amongst us, things have gone
very ill. And I tell you, sirs, for your better guidance in the
paying of these taxes, that I and other of the barons mean to
raise the question as to who is the actual suzerain of
Aquitaine."</p>

<p>Biting their lips nervously the councillors glanced at each
other. They well knew what this meant. The noblemen of Aquitaine
and Gascony had entered into a secret negotiation with Charles of
France. They had heard this already rumoured.</p>

<p>"No doubt," smiled Armagnac, "a certain quip made by Prince
John of Lancaster has come to your notice, when he said there was
nothing to be feared from Charles of Valois, that he was but a
craven cowering in a castle, an advocate busy with scraps of
paper. This reached the ears of Charles, and he replied, 'If I am
an advocate I will dish up a cause that will make them
smart.'"</p>

<p>One of the councillors ventured to laugh. But there was no
merriment in the assembly.</p>

<p>"We are men of peace, not war, sire," protested one. "Though
we, as Frenchmen, have a natural inclination towards the King of
France, that is not the pressing question of the moment, but how
we are to make our revenues meet our expenses."</p>

<p>"Such a question would not arise," declared Armagnac, "if we
could be rid of this Prince of Wales."</p>

<p>At this bold declaration, coming from a knight who had fought
with the English Prince, the councillors looked at each other
nervously with an intensified dread in their eyes. It was all
very well to talk of defying the Prince of Wales, but he was the
man in possession, and they in his power.</p>

<p>Several speaking at once asked dismally, if there was not some
hope still of squeezing from Don Pedro some of the huge loans
advanced to him?</p>

<p>But Armagnac, rising, said: Certainly there was none. They
dealt there with a villain and a traitor. It had been a great
mistake to undertake his quarrel. He had no right or justice in
him, nor it seemed any money either. It had been foolish to give
him so much treasure without any guarantee. What were the three
puling girls left behind in Bordeaux? No use to any man. The
eldest who had been repudiated by the King of Portugal, her
promised husband, had already gone into a convent...</p>

<p>"The treasure," ventured one councillor, "the treasure that
Don Pedro brought with him&mdash;is that of no worth?"</p>

<p>"Not of half the worth he would have it valued at," replied
Armagnac. "He swore even on the altar that it was of far higher
worth than it proved to be when sold. Talk not, sirs, of Don
Pedro. Let us dismiss him from our minds. Let us talk no more
either of the honour of the Prince of Wales, who is the mirror of
knighthood and the English Paragon and who has by personal
prowess gained such victories! Let us rather consider other
matters. Don Enriquez of Transtamara has gone to the Count of
Foix and His Holiness the Pope Urban and brought them keenly to
his side. Let us consider too that he has been secretly aided by
Louis, Duke of Anjou, our lord King Charles's lieutenant in
Langudoc, that he is collecting many mercenaries to harry
Aquitaine from Bigorre."</p>

<p>To these evil tidings a councillor added more gloomy news.</p>

<p>"I have heard too that the Prince's army was laid waste in
Spain. Fever and plague have destroyed whole companies."</p>

<p>"It is so," agreed Armagnac. "Edward of Wales would not be
able again to gather together the forces he had led across the
Pyrenees. If King Charles of Valois were to fall on
Aquitaine&mdash;"</p>

<p>The councillors interrupted, they would not hear of this. With
timorous gestures and excited words they stopped the Count...
Dangerous talk... treason... eh, not for them!</p>

<p>"Well," said he smiling dryly, "'tis news you must hear
presently. The King of Aragon too has deserted his old alliance
with the Prince of Wales and he will be a useful friend to
us."</p>

<p>Cool and thoughtful Armagnac looked round at the agitated
faces of the councillors. He was an elegant man, precise and neat
in his person, richly but not ostentatiously dressed, dark and of
middle age, the lines of his worn face were hard, the close-cut
hair iron grey.</p>

<p>"Do not pay these taxes," he urged. "Sirs, let us be rid of
these English."</p>

<p>"But if we do not pay the Companies? They will not disband
until they have their pay!" objected one councillor. "How are we
to endure them? They overrun the country. No honest traveller may
pass through the valley of the Dordogne. They are plundering and
ravaging with shameless effrontery. Neither property nor life is
safe from them."</p>

<p>"Let us be rid of them," said Armagnac, with narrowing eyes,
"by force. Why should we pay these thieves and brigands to cease
cutting our throats? Let us rather drive them out of the
country."</p>

<p>"The King of France has no army," replied one of the
councillors with a sigh. "He is burdened with the huge sum he has
to pay for his father's ransom."</p>

<p>"Ay, money is at the bottom of it all," said Armagnac, "Money,
money&mdash;always that. What is the good of this talk of
chivalry and brave deeds, of the flaunting prowess of war, honour
and glory? We come always to money, and therefore I say, sirs, do
not pay this tax. Your example will be followed by other towns,
and 'twill be the signal for which Charles of Valois waits."</p>

<p>"But his Princely Grace the King of France is no warrior,"
sighed one of the good men of Rodez. "He never goes fifty miles
from Paris, but remains shut up with his clerks and books."</p>

<p>"He does not make the show of the Prince of Wales," replied
the Count, "but he is a more useful man to serve. Do not despise
him. He is very powerful, for all his books, his pieces of
parchment, his clerks and his hymns and prayers. I know the
English call him coward and craven, and say he is not to be
feared. But surely you may trust me and the other knights of
Aquitaine when we say we will serve this King&mdash;surely you
believe that we would not put our fortunes behind any who is a
fool?"</p>

<p>Still the council sat doubtful and irresolute, and Armagnac
walked up and down the modest chamber.</p>

<p>Looking out with pleasure through the lancet-shaped window on
to the spring greenery in the square below, still endeavouring to
persuade these good, fat, timid, cautious burgesses to his way he
told them that the sister of the Queen of France, Margaret of
Bourbon, was to marry d'Albret, the great Aquitaine knight who
had quarrelled with the Prince of Wales over the two thousand
lancers that he was to lead into Castile.</p>

<p>"See how close that alliance brings us with the royal house of
France. See too how this Prince of Wales puts himself in the
wrong even with his own father, by allowing the Free Companies to
commit the ravages they do. When they have exhausted Aquitaine
they will begin to pour into France and lay waste right and
left."</p>

<p>"If we do not pay the taxes," argued one of the councillors,
"how can the Prince of Wales pay the Free Companies and so keep
his bond with the King of France not to allow these ruffians to
ravage his land?"</p>

<p>"'Tis all the better for us if he cannot do it," cried
Armagnac, "but if by skilful treaty they put him in the wrong
with his father. King Charles has very skilful Envoys at
Westminster. He pays highly a woman, one Dame Alys Perrers, who
has the doting old King in her power."</p>

<p>"But," cried one of the wealthiest and most important of the
councillors, "all these deep intrigues and shiftings to and fro
of policies and underhand dealings are not for plain men like us.
With all the quarrels and treacheries of these great ones we have
much ado to keep our roofs over our heads, meat in our bellies,
and a few coins in our chests. The question remains, shall we or
shall we not pay these taxes?"</p>

<p>"I'll put it clear," said Armagnac, striding to the head of
the table. "If this hearth tax&mdash;which is surely the most
odious ever imposed&mdash;is not paid, the Prince of Wales is
ruined. He can get no more money from England, I am well assured.
Gone are the days when he could boast 'I have my father's
treasury behind me into which I may dip my hand when I will, I
lack nothing.' Nay, I say there will be no money sent from
England nor any men-at-arms, and as for this Prince John he
hankers for a Crown. He pays his court to King Pedro's daughter,
and sees himself enthroned in Castile and Leon. The third Prince,
too, Edmund of Langley, has cast his eyes on the other Castilian
princess. So now, when they are all much entangled with their own
private ambitions, and the old King of England sinks into his
dotage, is the time for us to cast them off."</p>

<p>"But," one of the councillors objected, "a revolt would be
fiercely punished."</p>

<p>Armagnac answered haughtily and swiftly:</p>

<p>"Submission to the English will be fiercely punished." And
with that he left them with an impressive abruptness, his spurs
ringing on the narrow stone stairs.</p>

<p>The councillors sat silent and undecided.</p>

<p>Some pulled at the tags and buttons on their sleeves. Some
drew designs with quills on the parchment before them. Some
stroked their chins and stared at the table.</p>

<p>In their hearts they cursed all princes, men of war and
politicians. They were peaceful traders, men who liked to live
cosily and make their gains by labour, not through
peril&mdash;men who enjoyed the thought of piling up fortunes for
sons and daughters, of going to Mass regularly and feeing the
priest generously, of perhaps endowing some hospital or chapel
when they died and leaving money to pay for comfortable Masses to
be said for their souls.</p>

<p>The Spanish campaign had seemed to all of them an act of
stupid, futile folly, but none of them dared to say so. For was
not Edward of Wales the Paragon of knighthood, did not everyone
sing his praises?</p>

<p>They all liked their little town, the streets, the houses, the
churches, the shops, the markets. They enjoyed their daily life
there. Nothing seemed wrong to them but this perpetual intriguing
and fighting of the great ones of the earth. Yet it seemed
impossible for them to extricate themselves from the clutching
claws of these same great ones who were always calling out for
money, money, money!</p>

<p>If they revolted against the Prince of Wales and gave their
allegiance to the King of France (to whom they were more
naturally inclined) they would still have to pay, if not the
hearth tax, another no doubt as odious.</p>

<p>"Unless," as one of them suggested, "they could drive a
bargain with the Valois who seemed far more reasonable and
sensible than Edward Plantagenet&mdash;to give them ten years
free from any but the lightest taxes?"</p>

<p>For awhile they considered this suggestion hopefully,
discussing among themselves how they would send a messenger after
Armagnac and tell him they were resolute to refuse paying the
taxes to the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>Then fear overcame them again. Cruel, revengeful and
unrestrained in his violence was this Plantagenet when he was
opposed. Generous he might be to his friends and flatterers and
make a great parade of munificence. When he had returned to
Bordeaux, for instance, did they not all know how he had thanked
the Gascon barons and the English knights when they had gone back
to their governments or stewardships, making them splendid gifts
of gold, silver and jewels, no doubt the very last he had in his
coffers, and giving them the fairest words too?</p>

<p>"Good sirs, by my faith, with all my heart I ought to love
you, for you have served me right well. From my heart I thank
you." He had added oaths that though Don Pedro had not kept his
engagements it was not becoming for him to act in like manner to
those who had served him so valiantly.</p>

<p>Yet, the councillors reminded each other, what had these been
but mere words, for while the Prince spoke so, he meditated the
odious hearth tax to meet his obligations, and while he refused
to economize in his own household he had left the Free Companions
to pay themselves by battening upon poor honest men.</p>

<p>All very well to talk of honour, glory, chivalry&mdash;those
were terms amongst the great ones of the earth, and no doubt were
coins that were very readily exchanged among the nobility.</p>

<p>But for men like the councillors of Rodez they had no
meaning.</p>

<p>A little dry man leaning forward spoke with a cunning, yet
alarmed, air, as if he feared even the sound of his own words. "I
have heard it said it is gossip, you too may have heard the
rumour&mdash;" He paused. Leaning forward also the others urged
him to continue.</p>

<p>"Well, it is said that this English Paragon is not so well in
his health. Nay, it is even rumoured&mdash;I met one who came
from Bordeaux and another from Bayonne&mdash;they had the same
tale. It's got abroad so now that it may not be kept from the man
in the street. He often spends the entire day in bed, he who was
so active and used to boast so of his strength. They say that he
caught some fever in Spain."</p>

<p>And the other councillors, in eager, furtive whispers,
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we heard something of the kind. There was supposed
to be a monk who came from Seville with Don Pedro and was
attached to his person who would give him drugs."</p>

<p>"We know nothing," said another, "these are but tales."</p>

<p>"Still," urged the first speaker, "I believe King Charles's
spies have put a report before him as to the health of this
redoubtable Englishman, and they say he has some illness&mdash;a
dropsy, or a fever, that he is not the man he was."</p>

<p>"That may not be true," said another doubtfully. The first
speaker insisted:</p>

<p>"We know from the relation of all who come from Bordeaux that
the Prince is no longer gay and courteous, therefore does not win
so many hearts, but is often morose and moody. That he has lost
his colour and seems to wear his armour very seldom, and does not
any longer joust in the tourneys as was once his delight."</p>

<p>A large fat man interrupted and demanded impatiently:</p>

<p>"What would you with these hints? Do you mean that the Prince
of Wales being ill it is safe for us to defy him?"</p>

<p>And the first speaker leant back in his chair and said:</p>

<p>"That is my meaning."</p>

<p>A look of relief passed over their faces. They wished it might
be true. That this terrible man of war, this costly hero might
really bear in his breast the seeds of some dreadful disease,
which would render him weak, feeble, easy to be coped with, which
would finally take him to his native land.</p>

<p>None of them had dared to mention the subject to the Count of
Armagnac, but now that one had been bold enough to put the matter
forward they discussed it freely.</p>

<p>If only they could be sure! As they talked eagerly among
themselves they began, little by little, to be less afraid of the
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>By all accounts he was almost bankrupt. His old allies were
falling away from him and he could no longer pay an army. His
younger brother was ambitious and not likely to second him in any
of his designs. The old man in Westminster, who had been so
feared, was senile and fallen under the sway of a vile woman, who
was no doubt in the pay of France. And then Charles V, instead of
being a person to be despised, was showing himself careful and
prudent, and full of a kingly wisdom. Yes, it might be considered
safe to side with him. After all they were Frenchmen. Patriotism
awoke in their placid breasts. It was absurd any longer to
consider Aquitaine as a feoff or heritage of the Crown of
England. They were French, and their hearts turned to Charles of
Valois.</p>

<p>The result of their deliberations was a humble letter to the
Prince at Aquitaine begging him to excuse them from paying the
hearth tax, for the money could be by no means found. Yet, to
placate him and escape from the effects of his wrath, they sent
as a voluntary present six hundred crowns which was the best,
they declared, they could do. It had been contributed from their
private fortunes, since the poor had nothing. And to give a grace
to this gift they added a pot of green ginger, hoping that the
offering of this costly rarity might a little turn aside the
wrath of the Plantagenet.</p>

<p class="first">THE women chattered together about the affairs
of the men.</p>

<p>They were half-spiteful, half-loving, at once critical of, and
fearful for, their lords.</p>

<p>Matters went very ill for England in the French Provinces.
Even the women who knew little of business and did not care to be
concerned in such dull affairs sensed this and became
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>For the men were distracted. There was much riding to and fro.
There was a shortage of money. The tourneys, the festivals, the
displays which had welcomed home the victor of Najera had ceased
abruptly. There was even talk of a revolt. It was said that some
of the towns had refused to pay the <i>fouage</i> or hearth tax.
It was said that many of the Gascony baronies had a secret treaty
with Charles V. It was known that Don Enriquez was hovering on
the borders with a growing band of mercenaries. It was a fact too
that the Free Companies were ravaging the country in a manner so
fearful that women did not dare travel far from the confines of
the city. The Companions had quite got out of hand, and refused
to obey the authority of the Prince of Wales when he bade them
respect property.</p>

<p>They had not been paid, that was their answer, and they must
live. They had swept into France leaving desolation behind them,
and the King of France had complained to Edward Plantagenet at
Westminster. He regularly paid the instalments of his father's
enormous ransom and the old King listened to his complaint, and
sent angrily to his son, bidding him keep to the terms of the
Treaty and restrain the Free Companies.</p>

<p>But Edward of Wales had no power to do this.</p>

<p>Money. Everything turned on that&mdash;the shortage of
money.</p>

<p>Jeannette of Wales refused to economize in her household, and
her husband supported her in her extravagance. But even she found
here and there a pinch.</p>

<p>She grew listless and pettish, and she, like many of the other
English ladies, would like to have snatched up her children and
treasures and have returned to England.</p>

<p>But Edward of Wales had said that they must all stay, or it
would look like a flight.</p>

<p>All these matters the women chatted over, finding relief in
talk as men find relief in action.</p>

<p>The greatest grievance which evoked their loudest complaints
was the behaviour of Don Pedro, who had so shamelessly and
sacrilegiously broken all his promises, even those sworn before
the High Altar in the cathedral at Burgos.</p>

<p>Jeannette prided herself on the fact that she had disliked the
Castilian monarch from the first. Nay, she, who as a rule took no
interest in such matters, had even endeavoured to persuade her
husband against helping him.</p>

<p>"And see how right I was! The man is no better than a villain.
And now through him we have lost Sir John who has left the Court
because of the hearth tax!"</p>

<p>Sir John had been the Prince's best companion and wisest
counsellor, and Jeannette spoke more truly than she knew.</p>

<p>She sighed and looked round the room for some diversion from
her complaining idleness, but there was none. Even the bachelors,
pages and esquires were away, kept busy on manly matters.</p>

<p>She smoothed down her full skirt of stiff interchanging silk
which had cost an incredible price, and then fingered daintily
the ermine bands on her bodice.</p>

<p>With every day she grew less beautiful and more costly. She
piled up frantic defences against Time&mdash;luxurious garments
and jewellery, perfumings, dyeings and paintings of hair and
face. She had become more haggard since the birth of Richard at
Bordeaux, and this exasperated her. It was a fine thing, no
doubt, for her to have given England two princes, but this last
was a sickly child, and the elder of late had been peevish and
drooping, too.</p>

<p>"I want to return to England," pouted Jeannette, "it is stupid
for us to remain here."</p>

<p>But one of the ladies reminded her that the Black Death was
now abroad in England, that hideous plague which had already
slain the Duchess Blanche and entered palaces as easily as it
entered hovels.</p>

<p>"Everywhere we are unfortunate," complained Jeannette.</p>

<p>Queen Philippa, too, was lately dead, and though Jeannette had
not loved her overmuch, she was annoyed because the loss had made
her husband grieve so sorely. And, thinking of this grief of
Edward Plantagenet, her small discontented face, still fine and
exquisite, clouded with a deeper discontent.</p>

<p>The Prince was not well. He was not the man she had married,
nor even the man of a year ago. It was as strange as hateful to
see him surrounded by physicians, to know that some days he would
not rise at all, that other days he sat inactive, gloomy, in a
chair. He was moody and violent, he had lost much of his amiable
courtesy which had made him so beloved.</p>

<p>She had been frightened, too, by his withdrawal from her.
Sometimes for days together she had scarcely seen him. She
believed, though she thrust this knowledge from her, that he
suffered great pain, and the careless, shallow, selfish woman was
terrified and impatient at the thought of pain or illness. She
felt an unreasonable anger against her husband for thus losing
the beauty, the strength and the power which she had so admired
in him.</p>

<p>"Why need he have gone on that foolish Castilian campaign? He
had taken some fever or disease there among the filth of the
camp, or the fatigue of the marches."</p>

<p>Clasping her hands behind her head, close-bound with gold and
silk, she thought of Westminster.</p>

<p>She wished the old senile King, so tiresome in his dotage,
would die, then Edward would be King and she Queen.</p>

<p>Her lips curled cruelly as she went over in her mind how she
would dismiss Dame Alys Perrers when she was mistress of England.
That would solve everything&mdash;if the old King would die...
They could then return to London with renewed pomp and dignity,
and give up this tedious governorship of Aquitaine. John might
have that&mdash;it would be as well to keep John at a distance.
He loved Edward, no doubt, but he was quiet and cunning and
ambitious.</p>

<p>Thinking of John, Jeannette's beautiful eyes stirred towards
the tall dark girl who sat apart from all the other women in a
brooding attitude. Jeannette viewed her with dislike.</p>

<p>This was Constancia, one of Don Pedro's daughters whom he had
left as hostages in Bordeaux.</p>

<p>"A gesture of contempt to offer these three feeble, stupid
women as hostages," Jeannette thought. She knew that they were
useless, and that her husband would never harm them, nor would
he, the savage Castilian, have been much afflicted if they had
been put to death in return for his lack of faith.</p>

<p>The eldest, Beatrice, had already done what Jeannette thought
was the wisest thing, she had gone into a convent.</p>

<p>But these two, Constancia and Ysabella, remained about her
person&mdash;foreign, sullen, haughty, accepting charity and
making themselves disagreeable.</p>

<p>"Pride," Jeannette thought, "ill became two dowerless maidens,
two disinherited Princesses whose father had brought almost ruin,
almost dishonour on the greatest knight in the world by his
treacherous lying and loathsome breaking of promises."</p>

<p>But Constancia, in particular (Ysabella was of a meeker
temper), though she must hear her father daily abused, yet bore
herself with a fierce haughtiness ill-befitting her condition.
She kept apart from the other women, and, though she had learnt
English, refused to take part in their games, their gossip, or
their work. She seemed to realize nothing, save that she was, by
right, the last heiress of the House of Burgundy and should be
the future Queen of Castile and Leon.</p>

<p>She was no beauty, but lean and swarthy, with her father's
smoky-coloured black eyes and heavy tresses of harsh black hair,
which she took little trouble to dress.</p>

<p>"Poor bait to catch any man's fancy," Jeannette had sneered.
And yet she knew that Constancia had caught John of Lancaster,
even in the first month of his widowerhood when he had lost his
sweet Duchess Blanche to whom he claimed to be attached with such
a tender and chivalrous affection.</p>

<p>Jeannette despised her young brother-in-law for that, but she
knew what was the temptation that would make John of Lancaster
overlook the sullenness, the swarthiness, the haughtiness of
Constancia. If he married her he might hope to get the Crown in
Europe he would never achieve in England. He might quarter the
Castles and the Lion, give himself a regal style, term himself
King of Castile and Leon...</p>

<p>Brooding over these things Jeannette became further
discontented and annoyed.</p>

<p>How exasperating it was that John, for all his toilsome
journeys to and fro England, the loss of his wife and the
fatigues of war, remained in superb, easy health, while Edward
daily failed. How irritating it was to have to sit there idle and
watch John intrigue!</p>

<p>Edward swore that he was faithful and would listen to no word
against him. But Jeannette was apt to believe the worst of
everyone.</p>

<p>Out of a desire to torment and vent on another her own secret
fears and griefs, the Princess called up the Spanish girl.</p>

<p>"Come here, Constancia, sit by me. Why are you so sullen and
apart?"</p>

<p>Constancia looked round without rising.</p>

<p>"What do you wish, Madame? That I should come nearer the
better that I may overhear abuse of my father? Indeed, Madame, I
believe there is nothing new I can hear on that matter," she
added rapidly. "How often have I not heard related the tale of
his treachery, of the ruin it has brought on you all!"</p>

<p>"We are not ruined," said Jeannette, with a haughty smile.
"Nay, nor even troubled. My husband did what he undertook to
do&mdash;placed your father on the throne of Castile."</p>

<p>"That also I have heard before,' sneered Constancia. "Do you
wish to remind me, Madame, that your husband&mdash;" The Spanish
girl rose here and came towards the English Princess with the
same catlike tread her father used&mdash;"Do you mean to remind
me, Madame, that your husband was but a hired mercenary to my
father, and now laments he cannot get his pay?"</p>

<p>This was the excuse Jeannette had for the last hour wanted.
Her temper vented itself in action. She too rose, leaned forward
and, with adroit precision, slapped the Spanish Princess across
the face. The English ladies giggled, discreetly applauding their
mistress.</p>

<p>Constancia, paling, said carefully:</p>

<p>"It is as fine an action, Madame, to maltreat a helpless
captive as it is to break a knightly oath."</p>

<p>"But we are women," sneered Jeannette, "and are not bound by
these laws of chivalry. If you speak against my husband again I
will even more severely reprove your insolence!"</p>

<p>Constancia was not easily silenced.</p>

<p>"If the Prince helped my father because of the laws of
chivalry," she remarked bitterly, "why is it we hear so much of
this talk of money?"</p>

<p>On that word, John of Lancaster entered, coming into the
women's apartment with an unheralded abruptness which Jeannette
instantly reproved.</p>

<p>But the news was important. Edward was taken with a sudden fit
of his illness. He wanted his wife. Jeannette stood startled.
This was the first time since he had been stricken that he had
asked for her while in his seizures. A thousand terrible
possibilities crowded into her distracted mind.</p>

<p>The women went after their mistress, crying, gossiping,
lamenting, but John of Lancaster remained with Constancia of
Castile, who stood in the window-place, scornful of this emotion
in which she had no part.</p>

<p>She looked at the young English Prince sullenly, yet he was
her sole hope in her wretched position. Well she knew his secret
ambition.</p>

<p>"Have you come to abuse my father to me, Sir John of
Lancaster?"</p>

<p>"Nay," he gave her his cold smile, "I never waste time on
words. I do hope yet to get something from this adventure."</p>

<p>"You have a mind to a Crown," said she slyly.</p>

<p>"Maybe, I alone," he replied composedly, "of my father's sons
am worthy of it, save the Prince, and he is a sick man. I
believe," he added, "I shall be offered his post of Governor of
Aquitaine."</p>

<p>"Now, when the troubles come?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"He is a sick man," repeated John sombrely.</p>

<p>"You must have seen as much. When he was in Spain some foul
disease seized on him. The doctors say he sickens of a dropsy and
may never be able to mount a horse again. And, what is worse, the
King of France knows as much."</p>

<p>"Your affairs go very ill," remarked Constancia, "and no doubt
you blame my father for it all."</p>

<p>"You have no great cause to love your father," he smiled; "he
has abandoned you here with little care for your future."</p>

<p>The dark girl replied with an angry flash:</p>

<p>"He is a man much wronged and hurried. Whatever his sins he is
the true heir of the House of Burgundy and rightful King of
Castile and Leon. Would to God he had killed the bastard on the
field of Najera!"</p>

<p>"And you are the rightful Queen," declared Prince John, taking
her hand, "and much distressed I think and will need a knight,
one who is a good man-at-arms and a valiant leader to further
your cause. Could you think of me?"</p>

<p>He made no disguise of his burning ambition, nor of his
disinterest in her person, and she replied scornfully:</p>

<p>"Had you not a wife whom you greatly loved and who is but
lately dead?"</p>

<p>His grey eyes held her steadily. He cared nothing for her
contempt. His love for the dead Blanche was a thing apart from
all this and not to be spoken of...</p>

<p>He was a man who was never stayed by private grief, but must
go ever onwards, full of energy in the quick sweep of human
activity.</p>

<p>"I would take you," he said, as if he discussed a business
matter, "and Edmund who will never trouble any will take
Ysabella, and then I shall be your father's heir, and may call
myself King, without troubling England."</p>

<p>"I bring you no dowry," Constancia reminded him," and you will
have to fight for your kingdom. But the bargain is a good one for
me and I will take it. I have long sickened at being a pensioner
on your brother's charity and the butt of his dame's
complainings. As your wife, and one who may bring you a Crown, I
hope I shall be better entreated."</p>

<p>"My wife," cried John of Lancaster, "will never lack state and
respect. I swear, if God aid me, to slay this bastard Don
Enriquez who troubles your father and Castile!"</p>

<p>"It is enough," said Constancia.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, which he kissed with well-bred
courtesy.</p>

<p>They were at one in nothing save ambition.</p>

<p>She had all the fierce pride of a wronged and outcast
Princess, and he all the restlessness and discontent of a younger
son. There was no affection between them, scarce even liking. But
there was this bond, and it made them more than tolerant towards
each other.</p>

<p>"Do not think," said John of Lancaster, "that I have come here
wishing to supplant my brother. To him I am and ever must be
loyal. But the King my father is no longer fit to govern, and
there are great troubles about to roll over Aquitaine. We cannot
trust Charles of France, he works underground. This last tax has
been detested and mighty revolts are to be feared. My brother,"
he added proudly, "who was the greatest knight in the world, the
paragon of chivalry, is no more able to deal with war and
politics. But I am very well fitted to take his place."</p>

<p>"I believe you are," she replied. "I have admired you since
first I saw you," she added dryly, "you are accomplished in many
things and have your passions well in hand. I will do my part,
such as a woman may, to help you. I will gladly sit on the throne
of Castile, if my heritage ever comes to me, beside you."</p>

<p>And the embittered, disinherited woman, to whom no man had
ever spoken words of love, turned away abruptly and went into an
inner apartment, where her young sister yawned and idled away a
heavy day.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster returned to his brother's chamber. The
Prince had recovered from his paroxysm of pain and bid the women
away again. He often lost his courtesy now, and showed temper
even to Jeannette. She had left him weeping.</p>

<p>"The Devil take these doctors and their drugs!" he cried as
his brother came into his chamber.</p>

<p>"None of them can ease my pain!"</p>

<p>The disease had now got such a hold on him that even
Nunreddin's potions were of little use to help him in his agony
and distress.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster loved his brother, and for all his cool
composure there was misery and even terror in his eyes as he
looked at the mighty Prince brought so low by this invisible
foe.</p>

<p>Edward lay stretched on his couch, his hands hanging by his
sides, a light silk coverlet over his limbs, two down pillows at
his head, his tawny hair tangled on his brow, his face
ash-coloured and furrowed, the droop of his lid and the cast in
his eye appeared accentuated to the point of deformity.</p>

<p>Raging against his helplessness he broke out violently with
many bitter lamentations and fierce oaths.</p>

<p>"Armagnac is at the bottom of this! He goes from town to town
advising the Councils not to pay the taxes. What did I get from
Rodez but a few florins and a pot of green ginger?" With a
shaking finger he pointed to the sideboard on which stood the
costly gift. "All the baronage and the knighthood of these
provinces, yea, the very men who rode behind me across the
Pyrenees are now in secret treaty with Charles of France! But I
have this comfort, that de Valois is a craven. Never will he meet
me in the field."</p>

<p>"Nor you any prince again," thought John of Lancaster
mournfully. Aloud he said: "Do not despise de Valois because he
is a coward, brother. Such know how to strike. Greatly I fear his
cunning and dread his treachery. Why has he sent our father fifty
pipes of wine and a magnificent embassage? Why does he flatter
the old man, pay punctually his father's ransom, and ever
complain of you and the ravages of the Free Companies?"</p>

<p>"Because he is afraid," said Edward of
Wales&mdash;"afraid."</p>

<p>He sat up, put his hand to his side and fetched a groan.</p>

<p>"I am recovered now, John, I will go meet the Council."</p>

<p>The younger brother said firmly that this was useless and
meant nothing but a loss of prestige and dignity.</p>

<p>"When we have no good news to give, let us be silent."</p>

<p>"But if Aquitaine breaks into revolt and King Charles supports
the rebels?" asked Edward, with a flash from his blood-stained
eyes.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster answered:</p>

<p>"We can fight. We do not lack knights or loyal English
men-at-arms."</p>

<p>"I have offended Sir John Chandos, my truest friend," replied
the Prince gloomily. "He was against the hearth
tax&mdash;besides, he grows old. Chandos old and I sick! We are
good lieutenants for England, John."</p>

<p>John of Lancaster, prudent as he was and eager to spare his
brother any pain, could not forbear from exclaiming here against
the imprudence of the Prince in, for the second time, allowing
Bertrand du Guesclin to be ransomed.</p>

<p>"It was a hundred thousand crowns I got for him," said the
Prince of Wales sombrely, "and with it I was able to pay at least
some of the Free Companions."</p>

<p>"Not all," said John of Lancaster, "and far better had it been
for us to have had Bertrand du Guesclin in our power than to pay
even all of the Free Companions. Has he not gone straight to Don
Enriquez? Is he not, after yourself, the greatest Captain in
Europe?"</p>

<p>John spoke thus vehemently because he knew that Bertrand du
Guesclin had for the second time played upon his brother's secret
vanity and obtained his liberty by the old device&mdash;to John
very transparent&mdash;by exclaiming that he must be indeed of
inestimable value, and the Prince of Wales privately afeared of
him if he would not accept a hundred thousand crowns for his
release, and Edward's pride had clinched the bargain.</p>

<p>The King of France, Don Enriquez and the Pope had raised this
sum with a briskness that had proved to John of Lancaster how
they valued Bertrand du Guesclin. And he felt secretly infuriated
every time he thought of what his loyalty could not prevent him
from calling the folly of his brother. And John of Lancaster was
the more angry that he had now this direct and personal interest
in the fortunes of Pedro of Castile.</p>

<p>The last news had been that Du Guesclin and Don Enriquez were
advancing through Aragon, whose King had now taken their side,
and were about to fall on Don Pedro at Monthiel.</p>

<p>How he wished he had been able to deal with the cunning Breton
as he deserved! With what annoyance he recalled the flat
frog-like face when he had said, smiling with his complacent grin
into the English Prince's face:</p>

<p>"They say in France, as they say in other countries, that you
are so afraid of me, sire, that you dare not set me free."</p>

<p>And Edward's impetuous reply, as he fell straight into the
trap:</p>

<p>"What, Sire Bertrand, do you imagine we keep you a prisoner
for fear of your prowess? By St. George! it is not so. And, my
good sire, if you will pay me one hundred thousand crowns you
shall be free."</p>

<p>Then Bertrand, with the swiftness of a cat's blow upon a
mouse, replying:</p>

<p>"My lord, through God's will, I will never pay a less
sum."</p>

<p>The brothers were interrupted by the entry of one of the
Prince's knights. He had a curious matter to report.</p>

<p>An embassy from Paris had arrived at Bordeaux. This consisted
of but a knight and a lawyer who had put up at an inn. They had
come yesterday at the hour of Vespers and now had presented
themselves at the Abbey gates, declaring they were the
ambassadors of the King of France.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster was alert, taut, wary on the instant.</p>

<p>He said incautiously:</p>

<p>"I will receive them."</p>

<p>Edward of Wales got instantly to his feet.</p>

<p>"I have not yet relegated my authority to you," he said
impetuously. "<i>I</i> will receive France's embassy."</p>

<p>"In truth, brother, you are well able to do so," said John. "I
spoke without thought. Indeed, it is better that you yourself
should see these gentlemen, for I take it that they come with no
less than a declaration of war. Now we shall see the true temper
of Charles."</p>

<p>But Edward of Wales could not believe that the French King
would dare defy him. Since he was a child he had got into the
habit of thinking himself invincible, and neither his
difficulties, his debts nor the state of his health could lower
his superb confidence. He ordered the knight to have the two
Envoys courteously treated and received. They were to be held in
all respect and taken to the audience-chamber.</p>

<p>News of the arrival of this strange and unexpected embassy
from Paris roused the Prince into a semblance of his usual
strength and spirit.</p>

<p>"No doubt," he whispered to John, "Charles has heard some
lies, for he has his spies everywhere, some tales that I am ill
or even dying. But I will show him that I know how to receive his
messengers."</p>

<p>It was a magnificent figure who an hour or so later walked
into the audience-chamber where the knight and the lawyer stood
by the wide fireplace.</p>

<p>The Prince's purple velvet, edged with ermine, was of the most
costly description, and rich beyond valuation were the chains and
girdles of gold and gems, rings, buckles and brooches. His great
height was accentuated by a coif of folded azure and gold silk.
His bright hair was smoothly combed and cunningly curled to meet
the high collar that reached his ears. He held himself very
upright with a most noble carriage. But he had not been able to
disguise the sunken outline or the uncommon pallor of his face.
This, John of Lancaster thought, looking at him with anxious
affection, might pass for but a common fatigue or a slight
sickness; at least these two Envoys would be able to report in
Paris that Edward of Wales was not overthrown by illness.</p>

<p>The Embassy from Paris was lean enough, for Charles made
rather a parade of his poverty, emphasizing at every turn the
straits he was in to pay the instalments of his father's ransom
and how his revenues were cramped by the devastations of the
English in France and the seizure of his various provinces and
towns.</p>

<p>Both the knight and the lawyer were men of middle age and
insignificant appearance, shabbily attired, lightly armed, and
unattended.</p>

<p>Edward greeted them with all his habitual affable courtesy and
mounted the steps of the dais at the end of the room, taking his
seat under a canopy rich with the arms of England and France.
Round him were gathered the finest and most imposing of his
knights and companions&mdash;the Captal de Buch, Sir Robert
Knolles, Audeley, Sir Robert Felton and many English and loyal
Gascons.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster stood close to his brother, watchful and
anxious.</p>

<p>Both the Princes missed Sir John Chandos, to whom they usually
looked on such occasions.</p>

<p>The French lawyer advanced and, bending one knee, presented to
the Prince his credentials.</p>

<p>He remained kneeling while Edward read these, holding them
carefully on his knee and turning them over as if he would not
miss a word, but rather, John of Lancaster thought, to gain time
than because he was doubtful of the contents of the
documents.</p>

<p>At last he rolled them up, kept them in his hand like a baton,
and said very civilly:</p>

<p>"You are both, sirs, welcome, as coming from the King of
France. But I remain in doubt as to your message. Speak. Tell me
what the King of France requires of me." And he made a sign for
the lawyer to rise.</p>

<p>The knight now came forward to the foot of the dais. The two
messengers from Charles of Valois stood humbly before the Prince
of Wales.</p>

<p>"Great and honoured sir," said the lawyer, "here are letters
which were given to us by our honoured lord the King of France,
which letters we are engaged on our faith to publish in your
presence as they mainly relate to you."</p>

<p>With that the dry, withered, mean-looking man took some
documents from his pouch and the Prince glanced round at his
knights and barons, who pressed closer round the dais, exchanging
looks of amaze and apprehension.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster bit his lip and his long fine hands fell to
his sword-hilt. He believed that Charles of Valois, who had been
so long secretly working against them, was about to declare
himself.</p>

<p>"Great sir," said the lawyer, bowing again, "it is a summons
we have to read."</p>

<p>At that the Prince flushed, the blood darkening his face to
the very temples; he seemed about to leap to his feet with some
vehement reply, but restrained himself and merely said:</p>

<p>"Speak, speak, for good news we shall cheerfully hear."</p>

<p>At this the little lawyer, with the knight close behind him,
began to read out in a shrill, almost piping, voice which seemed
in ill-accordance with the gravity of his mission:</p>

<p><br>
"<i>Charles, by the Grace of God, King of France, to our
nephew, the Princes of Wales and Aquitaine, health! Whereas,
several prelates, barons, knights, universities, fraternities and
colleges in the County and District of Gascony, residing and
inhabiting upon the borders of our realm, together with many
others in the County and Duchy of Aquitaine, have come before us
in our Court to obtain justice for certain grievances and unjust
oppressions which you, through weak counsel and foolish advice,
have been induced to do them, and at which we are much
astonished. Therefore, in order to obviate and remedy such
things, we do take cognizance of their cause, inasmuch as we of
our Royal Majesty and Sovereignty order and command you to appear
in our city of Paris in person and that you show and present
yourself before us in our Chamber of Peers to hear judgment
pronounced on the complaints aforesaid and the grievances that
are done by you to your subjects who claim to be heard and have
the jurisdiction of our Court. Let there be no delay in obeying
this summons. Set out as speedily as possible after hearing this
Order read. In Witness whereof we have affixed our Seals to these
presents. </i></p>

<p>"<i>Given at Paris the twenty-sixth day of January,
1369."#</i></p>

<p><br>
John of Lancaster had not dared to look at his brother while
this letter was being read. In his own heart rage, shame and
humiliation at this insolence struggled with a growing fear, for
he was shrewd enough to realize Charles would never have dared
this had he not been strong indeed in Gascony and Aquitaine.</p>

<p>When the lawyer had ceased, the indignation, which the knights
and barons had felt waxing greater during the reading, could
scarcely be restrained. They broke into angry murmurs.</p>

<p>The Prince rose from his seat and silenced them all.</p>

<p>In a loud, hoarse voice he cried, staring at the Frenchmen and
shaking his head:</p>

<p>"We shall willingly attend on the appointed day at Paris since
the King of France sends for us, but it will be with our helmet
on our head and accompanied by sixty thousand men!"</p>

<p>His aspect was as terrible as that of a lion at bay. His
pallor had become ghastly and there was a distortion on his
features as if he had been struck by a convulsive fit. He stood
erect and rigid, grasping the arms of his chair. The lawyer and
the knight both fell on their knees, clasping their hands towards
him in an attitude of supplication.</p>

<p>"Great sir, visit not your anger upon us! We are but the
miserable instruments of the King of France and are bound to do
his bidding!"</p>

<p>At this appeal to chivalry the Prince made a great effort over
his amazed wrath. He was very careful to keep the only code in
which he believed, that of knighthood.</p>

<p>"My anger," he muttered, in a trembling voice, "is not against
you, but against he who sent you. Your King has been ill-advised
to meddle in the affairs of Aquitaine and to make himself a judge
of what he has nothing to do with, nor any right to interfere in.
It shall be clearly demonstrated to him that when he gave
possession and seizing of the whole Duchy of Aquitaine to our
lord and father by his Commissioners, he surrendered also all
jurisdiction."</p>

<p>His anger deepened and nearly got the better of him. He put
his right hand to his heavy ermine collar and fumbled at the
massive gold clasps of his mantle, as if he stifled for lack of
air.</p>

<p>"All those," he cried, "who have appealed against us have no
other court to apply to but England, that of our lord and
father!" He paused and added with a violence he could by no means
check: "It shall cost a hundred thousand lives before it shall be
otherwise!"</p>

<p>John of Lancaster ventured to address his brother.</p>

<p>"Sir, is it your pleasure that I should question these men and
get a little deeper into their designs?"</p>

<p>Edward of Wales seated himself, rested his elbow on the arm of
his throne and his face in his hand.</p>

<p>"Ask what you will," he said briefly.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster then turned to the two trembling Envoys.</p>

<p>"The Count of Armagnac is behind this," he said sternly," as
my brother can well perceive. Ay, and the Lord d'Albret, besides
other treacherous and rebellious barons. You must be taken, not
so much as the mouthpiece of the King of France, as theirs. To
whom do you go to make your report when you leave Bordeaux?"</p>

<p>The lawyer replied that he was to go to the Duke of Anjou, who
waited them at Toulouse.</p>

<p>"Ay, the Duke of Anjou is as impatient for war as I am," said
John of Lancaster, "but will not have so good a cause to rejoice
in the result. As for yourselves, you are mean-looking men to be
thus bold. Know you not you have insulted my brother in his own
palace?"</p>

<p>At these words of John of Lancaster, and several of the
English knights, with bitter curses on the head of the King of
France, Armagnac and the other rebelling barons, demanded that
the ambassadors should be put to death immediately.</p>

<p>But the Prince silenced them and, rising again, looked at the
two men whom Charles of Valois had thus chosen as the means of
his humiliation.</p>

<p>"Get you to your inn," he said hoarsely. "Infringe no more on
our hospitality. For the message you have given there shall be a
fitting reply at a fitting time."</p>

<p>The knight and the lawyer turned and with undignified haste
left the audience-chamber, thankful to have acquitted their
dangerous mission, and again the English fiercely demanded that
these two wretches should be killed.</p>

<p>"No," said the Prince, "that cannot be. They come as envoys in
a time of peace."</p>

<p>He looked round at the angry faces of his friends and
followers, and added with the deepest bitterness:</p>

<p>"Good sirs, by my faith, it seems from what I can see the
French hold me as dead."</p>

<p>There were few of them who had the courage to meet his eye,
for well they knew that in spite of the good front he had put on
it to-day he was not the man of Crécy and Poictiers, nay, even of
Najera.</p>

<p>"Chandos must return," muttered the Prince of Wales. "I will
summon Chandos."</p>

<p>John of Lancaster put his hand over that of his brother's,
which still rested on the arm of the chair, and said:</p>

<p>"What of these two messengers? They have gone without waiting
to receive warrants. They declared that they would go to Toulouse
to rejoice the Duke of Anjou, our enemy, with an account of how
they have insulted you even in your house in Bordeaux."</p>

<p>The Prince replied moodily:</p>

<p>"It is not right that they should so easily leave our country
to go and relate their prattle to Anjou who loves us little, as
you say, John, and declare how they have summoned us personally
in our own palace. Indeed, it seems to me that they are
messengers from the Count of Armagnac, the Lord d'Albret, the
Count of Perigord-Commines and Carmaign, rather than from the
King of France."</p>

<p>He added with a deep sigh of rage and pain: "I will, for the
vexation they have given us, that they be detained and thrown in
prison."</p>

<p>Two of the knights instantly left the audience-room.</p>

<p>"'Tis Armagnac," burst out the Prince of Wales, with a furious
bitterness. "Would I had left him languishing in the prison of
the Count of Foix! He will cause war once again between England
and France, which will be a greater ill than all the good he is
ever likely to do in his life!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed Armagnac," said Prince John of Lancaster
sombrely; "he is bold, unprincipled and cunning, but more
important than he is this Charles of Valois."</p>

<p>Edward of Wales sat still, thinking of all the forces arrayed
against him, of his father, old and bedridden in Westminster, and
of his own body, day by day failing, and his sons who were but
children. He gripped his brother's hand and said:</p>

<p>"Send for Sir John Chandos."</p>

<p>But John of Lancaster thought: "Chandos is also old and not
the man he was."</p>

<p>Yet he left the room at once, active and alert as always, to
send a messenger to fetch Sir John Chandos from his estates in
the Cotentin, bidding him to come at once to Angoulême, bidding
the Constable be prepared to take measures to meet a rebellion
and possibly a renewal of the great war with France.</p>

<p>Without loss of time John of Lancaster also wrote to the old
King at Westminster, bidding him not to be deceived by any smooth
embassies from Charles of Valois, nor gifts of fifty pipes of
wine, which indeed he would do well to return, since Edward had
been grievously insulted by the King of France... But, on the
other hand, he should send what aid he could to Aquitaine, in the
way of men and money. "'Twere best that the Earl of Cambridge,
the Earl of Pembroke and other great knights came at once."</p>

<p>John of Lancaster, ever quick and lively in his mind and in
his person, began to cast about how the Free Companies might be
engaged and brought back to their old allegiance to the Prince.
It was true that few of them had been paid, but promises might
again serve their turn. At least it would be as well to prevent
them possibly joining the King of France.</p>

<p>Anjou and Berri, those Princes of the French blood royal, were
both very cunning knights. John of Lancaster knew that he would
need all his wits to prevail against them.</p>

<p>The energetic Prince had seen written, had signed and
dispatched all these letters, and it was again the hour of
Vespers. And, with the ringing of the church bells into the cold
winter air, came more news, and this of the very worst.</p>

<p>There had been a great battle at Monthiel.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin and Don Enriquez had defeated Don Pedro. The
latter had been captured and slain by his brother's own hand
during a skirmish in the tent after the battle.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster crossed himself at the sound of the vesper
bell. No doubt prayers and Masses could so something even for the
soul of such as Don Pedro, the man of blood who had perished
bloodily.</p>

<p>Then he flushed and forgot God and the vesper bell and the
soul of Don Pedro, for he remembered that now Constancia was the
rightful Queen of Castile and that he might call himself King and
quarter the Castle and the Lion.</p>

<p>It fell to him to take this news to the Princess Constancia,
his promised wife.</p>

<p>He found the dark, fierce girl with Jeannette, who was playing
in a half-peevish, half-teasing fashion with her elder son.</p>

<p>Jeannette sprang up when the young Prince entered, demanding
his news before he could say a word to Constancia.</p>

<p>"What is all this turmoil and trouble? I have been mewed up
here all day and have heard nothing. Edward still refuses to see
me. He is shut up again with the old monk who came with Don
Pedro. Tell him not to do this, John; it is not liked. People
talk of magic and a fiend in disguise."</p>

<p>She gave her silly shallow laugh, but her eyes were
frightened.</p>

<p>"There is a great stirring abroad and trouble in the air,"
said the young Prince gravely, "and matters are not helped by
chattering with women. But, for Constancia here, who is to be my
wife, I have news&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But for me nothing," interrupted Jeannette. "Am I always to
be left playing with children? Is Edward sick, or only moody? How
do affairs go? Is it true there is to be a revolt, and even a
war? I would I could return to Westminster."</p>

<p>John of Lancaster took no heed of any of this.</p>

<p>He turned to Constancia, took her small brown hand and said,
with some kindness:</p>

<p>"Princess, there has been a battle between Du Guesclin and
your father at Monthiel. I had the news half an hour ago. Don
Pedro was slain."</p>

<p>Her swarthy face quivered a little and she drooped her lids
over her huge dark eyes. But her manner had the calm of one who
receives expected news.</p>

<p>"Did he die unshriven?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That I know not." John of Lancaster crossed himself. "I will
expend much in Masses for his soul, Constancia."</p>

<p>"It would become you," replied the girl, "since you are his
heir."</p>

<p>"By God," he swore, "and by St. George, I will make you
Queen!"</p>

<p>Jeannette broke out bitterly:</p>

<p>"Ay, you were ever ambitious to be King before your brother,
John. This galloping ambition is not becoming!" She wondered
curiously if there would ever be a crown on her own head. If that
old man at Westminster would not die and her husband sickened so
the future looked dreary to Jeannette... Daughter-in-law of a
king, descended from a king, mother of a king, but never a queen.
She eyed the Spanish girl maliciously.</p>

<p>"Set me down as you will," John of Lancaster reminded her
calmly, "it is as well there is one man in Aquitaine who is ready
to bear himself valiantly for King Edward and England."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; LIMOGES</h2>

<p class="first">BROTHER FRANCIS had always intended to be a
saint like his namesake of a hundred years ago, but found the
times ill-suited to this ambition. He thought that the gentle
monk of Assisi would not have made so fine a business of his
saintship had he lived in a convent outside Angoulême during the
revolt in Aquitaine.</p>

<p>Brother Francis had watched for many months now, parties of
men-at-arms tramping or riding to and fro the Bourbonnais and the
Limousine, and despite his efforts at pious abstraction, he had
been very interested in these worldly matters.</p>

<p>As a good Frenchman he wished the dowry of Eleanor of
Aquitaine and the provinces wrested from France by the Treaty of
Bretigny to return to the King of France, and as a quiet
scholarly man he wished that the other quiet scholarly man,
Charles of Valois, would succeed in his struggle against these
terrible boasting Plantagenets who were feared in France like
ogres or monsters.</p>

<p>Brother Francis, in common with the other monks of his Order,
had been often distracted from his prayers by news of the war
which had become inevitable from the moment that Edward of Wales
had arrested King Charles's ambassadors at Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Those two fiery knights and Princes&mdash;the Dukes of Anjou
and Berri&mdash;had wished to declare war immediately after that.
And Brother Francis had applauded the tact and cunning with which
Charles of Valois had restrained them till he had, by his
diplomatic machinations separated England from her ally.</p>

<p>But, without awaiting the authority of the King of France, the
rebellious barons had commenced petty sallies and acts of warfare
on their own authority... and the Count of Armagnac, safe in the
fortified town of Rodez, had definitely flung down the gage when
he captured Sir Thomas Wake, who was riding through the Garonne
Valley...</p>

<p>With a shiver of excitement the monks had heard how Sir John
Chandos, the English Prince's Constable, old as he was and
hostile to the acts which had caused the rebellion, had hastened
to the Prince's side, and assisted him in drawing up a scheme of
the campaign.</p>

<p>In the church of the abbey, Brother Francis and his
fellow-monks had listened to a recital of a copy of the Prince's
manifesto which, addressed to the prelates, barons and commons of
Aquitaine, had been read aloud by the Precentor. The point of
this proclamation had been a bitter invective against the Count
of Armagnac, who, said the Prince, in spite of all favours
showered on him, had fermented a revolt and given an opportunity
to the Princes of the blood of France, the Dukes of Anjou and
Bern, to overrun Aquitaine, plunder and ravage the peaceful
inhabitants...</p>

<p>The monks had looked at each other and laughed:</p>

<p>"It's a fine thing for the Prince of Wales to talk of
plundering and ravaging when he has let loose the Free Companies
unpaid on the country!"</p>

<p>And with a good deal of zest and relish they read the
counter-proclamation which Armagnac immediately issued from
Rodez.</p>

<p>In this the rebel claimed that he had sacrificed his person
and his money to the Prince, and had spent no less than six
hundred thousand golden florins on the fatal Spanish expedition,
of which the Prince still owed him two hundred thousand. That as
regards the ransom Edward had paid the Count of Foix, he had
already reimbursed the Prince. He explained, too, that the
principal officials in Rouergue had annexed his jurisdiction, and
confiscated his possessions, and he complained vehemently of the
<i>fouage</i> which he declared was impossible since the poor
were so oppressed they had no means to pay it, and he added
fiercely that he could not get justice either at Bordeaux or at
Westminster, and therefore had appealed to his legitimate
sovereign, the King of France.</p>

<p>The monks, although they tried to keep themselves detached
from worldly affairs, could not but rejoice to know that a little
more than a month after this manifesto nine hundred and
twenty-one castles, towns or fortified places in the counties of
Armagnac, Rodez, Limoges, Quercy and Agenais had deserted England
and her lieutenant, Edward of Wales.</p>

<p>The Prince and Chandos remained immobile at their headquarters
at Angoulême, while on the southwest the Duke of Berri overran
Auvergne, invaded Rouergue, and took La Roche Valsergue, while
the Duke of Anjou and the Count of Perigord flung themselves
forward from their base at Toulouse and invaded Aquitaine and the
valley of the Garonne. Along the North frontier of Poitou,
Touraine and Anjou, Jean de Beuil, William des Bordes and Louis
St. Julien succeeded in driving back the English.</p>

<p>The monks chattered over these events in much excitement. They
were depressed when they heard that Chandos, the famous veteran,
had re-established the English cause in the South, and delighted
when they heard that the valiant Burley had been captured at La
Roche Posay, which was a great vexation to the Prince of Wales
who regarded him "as worth a hundred men."</p>

<p>Soon after this came a real disaster to the English cause,
which Brother Francis, who was an enthusiast, was inclined to
regard as an answer to his prayers.</p>

<p>After hastening to rescue the impetuous and foolish Earl of
Pembroke from an ambuscade, Chandos had been surprised himself
and slain at Chauvigny, at the bridge of Lussac.</p>

<p>The Abbot told the monks that, greatly as they might rejoice
at the loss of this redoubtable enemy of France, they must regret
"a noble man and a gentle knight, who was full of wisdom and
devices, and might yet have found some means of establishing a
peace between England and France."</p>

<p>"God hath his soul in keeping," added the Abbot, "for the sake
of his goodness. For three hundred years past there was no one
more gentle nor more distinguished by every noble virtue than
he."</p>

<p>Yet, in his heart, Brother Francis was pleased that this great
knight had been taken to heaven and left France to the
French.</p>

<p>More good news came to the convent at Angoulême. Anjou and
Berri came like a tempest into the Agenais and the Limousine,
Anjou dashing to within five leagues of Bordeaux.</p>

<p>"The English Prince," chattered the monks to each other, "must
be a very sick man, if he does not stir now!"</p>

<p>From January to September nothing but disaster had fallen on
the English arms, and still the Prince of Wales lay, without
making a sign, at Angoulême.</p>

<p>Brother Francis heard from the passers-by&mdash;the convent in
those days often had to give refreshment and hospitality to
hastening wayfarers, knights, squires and bachelors and citizens
driven from their homes&mdash;that the two French Princes
intended to make a march on Angoulême and capture this famous
paragon of chivalry in his bed.</p>

<p>But this last misfortune seemed to put some new life into
Prince Edward, and he was heartened by reinforcements from
England which his brother John of Lancaster had gone to fetch,
and began to concentrate his armies at Cognac.</p>

<p>Lancaster had brought with him but three hundred men-at-arms
and five hundred archers. He had been entrusted by the old King
at Westminster with orders to remit the hateful hearth tax, and
to pardon all rebels who would submit at once. Also, to arrogate
to himself all powers "which my eldest son," said the old King
bitterly, "is not fit to exercise."</p>

<p>This was the fierce Plantagenet's last move to retain the
escaping provinces.</p>

<p>England was again in a state of war with France, and the monks
laughed among themselves in great amusement when they had heard
how the King of France, throwing off the mask at last, had sent
his defiance to Edward.</p>

<p>This was by the mouth of a scullion who travelled from Paris
to Westminster with the Valois's defiance to the old
Plantagenet!</p>

<p>The capture of Limoges by the Duke of Berri provided further
excitement for the monks. Their abbey stood directly on the high
road between Limoges and Cognac, the Prince of Wales' base.</p>

<p>This fine and handsome town had fallen easily to the French
duke through the connivance of the Bishop Jean de Gros, and the
Abbot was not pleased at this news, for the Bishop had been a
friend, even an adviser, of the Prince of Wales, and he did not
like his cause to prosper through treachery.</p>

<p>"You will see too," he said to Brother Francis as they walked
together in the September evening, "that it will throw the
English Prince into a very great rage and he will meditate some
terrible vengeance."</p>

<p>And indeed the monks heard from the affrighted lips of
travellers that the Prince on hearing of the surrender of Limoges
had sunk into an apathy of rage. Then, when he had been able to
speak, had sworn his most terrible oath "by the soul of his
father," which he had never perjured, that he would have Limoges
back again, that he would not attend to anything until he had
done this! He would make the inhabitants pay dearly for their
treachery!</p>

<p>On a beautiful autumn day the trembling monks gathered round
their abbey walls and gates and saw the English force pass by to
besiege Limoges... Three thousand men-at-arms, a thousand
archers, a thousand footmen&mdash;English, Gascons, and veterans
of the Free Companies.</p>

<p>The army took no heed of the monastery nor of the monks
gathered about it, nor did they even pause to plunder the
country-side, though it was their rule systematically to
devastate all the lands through which they passed. But, on this
occasion, they pushed forward with the relentless force of those
fulfilling a relentless purpose.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales had sworn an oath, and one that he had
never been known to perjure.</p>

<p>The monks believed that Limoges would at once surrender when
this terrible warrior in his wrath appeared before the gates.</p>

<p>And so indeed the Bishop and the poor townsfolk would have
done, and rushed out and thrown themselves at his feet demanding
mercy of their injured master.</p>

<p>But the French knights, Sir Jean de Villemar, Sir Hugh de la
Roche, and Sir Roger de Beaufort refused what they called "these
craven counsels." They said the town was well provided with food
and with artillery, and that they would hold the fort until they
were relieved by the Duke of Bern, who was hovering near with a
considerable army.</p>

<p>As the days and weeks passed by and still the English did not
take Limoges, the monks began to think that after all the dreaded
Prince was not so terrible, that the town might hold out until
the French King could succeed in hacking his way through the
English lines.</p>

<p>Then, when the siege had endured for about a month, there came
no further news from Limoges. For several days the long high road
was bare of travellers. The monks seem isolated in their own
world of the convent building, church and gardens set so
agreeably in the pleasant autumn fields.</p>

<p>Brother Francis tried to write a chronicle of these events and
all the stormy happenings of his times, but gave up the task with
a sigh of despairing weariness, for what might he, a simple monk,
know of the truth, when he heard first this rumour and then that
and everything was contradicted and all was in a confusion? The
events that he could see with his own eyes were so small and
trifling, the large ones always enacted beyond his ken.</p>

<p>Through some mischance or stupidity of his own, for instance,
he had not been able to see the Prince of Wales when that warrior
had passed from Cognac to Limoges. No, not though he had hung for
hours at the convent gate, studying eagerly all the passing
company with their great bravery of pennon and banner, of armour
and scarf. He could not even say whether Prince Edward had gone
on horseback or in a litter... For, of the Prince's health there
were many different stories told. Some said that he was a sick
man for whom the doctors could do nothing more. Others declared
he was well again. "I would like to see him," thought Brother
Francis regretfully. "A man like that, whose fame has spread over
the whole world, who is feared by his enemies and adored by his
friends, who has all worldly power and valiancy. Yes, I should
like to see this English Paragon."</p>

<p>He walked in the cloister garden with little Hugh&mdash;a boy
the monks had rescued a year ago from the ruins of one of the
burnt farms which had been destroyed in a foray.</p>

<p>The child was too young to know to the full his loss and his
misery. He seemed happy with the monks, and would play for hours
in the garden or in the long, whitewashed hall and cloisters.</p>

<p>But sometimes he would have a fit of crying for nothing, as it
appeared, and often in the night he would wake and call out for
his mother and his little sister, for his father and the elder
brother whose bodies had long since been trampled into the soil
they had so carefully tended.</p>

<p>There was a multitude of bright flowers in the convent garden,
and the air was very sweet with that honey-like fragrance of
autumn which is as delicious and more opulent than the fragrance
of the spring.</p>

<p>The sky was a tender blue beyond the scarlet and amber of the
autumn leaves. The sunshine was tawny and luscious, and warm
without the fierceness of summer heat.</p>

<p>Brother Francis gathered herbs in the herb garden, putting his
aromatic bunches into a flat rush-basket, while little Hugh sat
on the path and made himself bows and arrows from hedgerow twigs
and boughs.</p>

<p>The sun was setting in a soft haze of purple-gold, and it
lacked about an hour to Vespers.</p>

<p>Brother Francis felt in a peaceful, happy mood. He looked with
loving pleasure on the little child. He was pleased to think how
fat and comely he had grown under his care, and how contented he
was with his little mimic weapons. And then he was distressed
that he had allowed the child to have these fierce toys, and not
given him a gentler diversion. For Brother Francis did not care
to think that little Hugh would grow to be a lusty savage man,
even as those who had slain his father and burnt his home. He
wished he could keep him always so happy and innocent among the
flowers of the garden...</p>

<p>He crossed to the sun-flushed wall and picked a large ripe
pear which, with a little device of muslin, he had guarded from
wasps and flies, and gave it to the child, as he sat among his
bows and arrows.</p>

<p>When little Hugh, with a clap of his hands, had dropped the
sticks and seized the fruit, Brother Francis was pleased.</p>

<p>While he stood, with his basket of herbs on his arm,
thoughtfully and pleasantly watching the child, another monk came
hurrying out from the low buildings of the abbey, and on his
pinched lips was breathless news.</p>

<p>"I have seen the vaward of the English army coming along the
road, hastening with all speed back to Cognac!"</p>

<p>"Then Limoges has fallen," said Brother Francis.</p>

<p>"What else? It must be so," replied the other fearfully. "They
had not a defeated air."</p>

<p>Brother Francis snatched up the child and carried him into the
front of the garden and so to the gates of the monastery, where
the other monks had crowded to watch the English go by again.</p>

<p>Edward of Wales's army marched as it had marched before,
steadily, swiftly, without pause or glance to right or left.</p>

<p>The monks pointed out to each other the banners of England
aloft and unstained, the bright armour of the knights, the
splendid equipment of the archers and men-at-arms...</p>

<p>With excitement they singled out the noble figure of John of
Lancaster in his costly mail on his magnificent black horse.</p>

<p>And then Brother Francis saw the English Paragon. A long
litter carried by six mighty men who walked slowly. And on the
litter one who seemed a giant in stature, whose hands were folded
on his breast, who was covered with a mantle of violet and
ermine, before whom went the Royal Standard of England.</p>

<p>The monks, shivering together in the warm autumn twilight,
gazed after this terrible figure. For a few moments it was
outlined against the sky&mdash;the gigantic man prone on the
litter, the six tall men bearing the litter, the escort of
knights and squires&mdash;and then it was gone, lost in the
glittering winding of the broken column.</p>

<p>The monks chattered together.</p>

<p>"So he is ill&mdash;so he cannot mount a horse&mdash;what has
happened at Limoges?"</p>

<p>No one took any heed of them. There was no one whom they dare
ask. Brother Francis held little Hugh close to his breast. The
Vesper bell brought them into the chapel. They said their prayers
that day with a deeper fervency.</p>

<p>And when Brother Francis put the friendless orphan child in
his bed he blessed him in a voice that shook with fear, and
turned in passionate appeal to the crucifix on the white wall,
imploring the Lord of mercy and of tenderness to have pity on
these little ones...</p>

<p>Troubled in his mind and uneasy in his soul Brother Francis,
later that evening, left the gate and looked up and down the long
high road between Cognac and Limoges. He hoped that he might see
some straggler from whom he could get news. But the great army
had passed like a vision in a dream. The wide landscape lay
placid and untroubled beneath the evening sky.</p>

<p>Yet presently Brother Francis heard a groan, a broken prayer,
and, running eagerly along the highway, he found but a few paces
from the abbey walls an English man-at-arms, who had dragged
himself out of the line of march and fallen there overcome by his
wounds.</p>

<p>Brother Francis quickly called for help, and four or five of
the old and feeble monks were able to drag the heavy soldier into
their holy sanctuary.</p>

<p>They bathed his wounds which were on breast and arms. It gave
Brother Francis pleasure to wash away the blood and dirt and
sweat.</p>

<p>They were not dangerous wounds, the man was not like to die of
them. Yet he seemed as one stricken to death.</p>

<p>Even the monks' most cherished and prized cordials failed to
put any life into him. He lay motionless on the pallet-bed, and
when he found the strength to speak he begged them all in piteous
tones to pray for him. Now and then strong shudders shook him,
and he groaned and cried out like one oppressed by terrible
sights and sounds.</p>

<p>At last the Abbot asked what disease plagued him, and bid him
speak and unburden his spirit, for he thought that the man had
done some fearful deed of war which lay heavy even upon a
soldier's conscience.</p>

<p>At that the man-at-arms seemed to regain a little of his
senses and asked them to raise him up, which they did, propping
him with a rolled mattress.</p>

<p>"I have seen," he said, "the sack of Limoges."</p>

<p>"Limoges is taken then," the whisper went round the monks.</p>

<p>The man-at-arms, whose pale eyes stared from face to face,
repeated:</p>

<p>"Limoges fell."</p>

<p>The Abbot found the courage to ask:</p>

<p>"And what vengeance had the Prince of Wales?"</p>

<p>With a grin of anguish the English man-at-arms replied:</p>

<p>"We mined and they countermined. They had good artillery and
brave knights. But the Duke of Lancaster blew up their defences.
The Prince of Wales was carried across the breach. And there, sir
Abbot, he redeemed his vow. Limoges was sacked. All were put to
the sword. Ay, had you seen it... a piteous sight."</p>

<p>"All were put to the sword?" shuddered Brother Francis,
thinking of little Hugh asleep upstairs beneath the crucifix.</p>

<p>"Men, women and children," whispered the English soldier,
"even those poor helpless ones who had done no harm and knew
nothing of the treason. All these poor creatures imploring mercy
and finding it not. Although they threw themselves before the
Prince of Wales with many tears and supplications, yet he ordered
that they should be massacred. And so they were. And I, who have
seen many sights, have seen none so terrible as this, which made
me think of God and hell and vengeance&mdash;to see little
children, old women, and mothers who had done no wrong thus
foully slain and crying out in their torment!"</p>

<p>"They were martyrs," muttered the Abbot, crossing himself,
"and by now in heaven."</p>

<p>"This," shivered Brother Francis, "is your English Paragon!
This is your pattern of chivalry!"</p>

<p>"He had no mercy," said the man-at-arms, as if speaking to
himself. "He had sworn his oath. He kept his vow. The Bishop was
dragged before him. He eyed him terribly and would have had him
put to death, but the Duke of Lancaster stayed him. The Duke
would have stopped the massacre, but the Prince would have no
mercy. No mercy," repeated the man-at-arms, monotonously.</p>

<p>"Did they never stop?" asked the Abbot. "Is there no living
soul left in Limoges? God have mercy upon our souls!"</p>

<p>"It was stopped," said the man-at-arms, "through the Prince's
chivalry. He regarded as nothing the poor folk, but when he heard
that the French knights in the citadel were defending themselves
with a last valiancy he was moved because of their condition and
gentlehood and gave orders that the slaughter should cease."</p>

<p>The bowed Abbot again crossed himself:</p>

<p>"And you, my son, are a man of war yourself, and yet you were
stirred by this?"</p>

<p>"It was as if God spoke to me," whispered the Englishman
earnestly. "I come from Lincolnshire and my father was a peaceful
man. I thought of the Fens and the labour we made to drain them
and to grow there food and fruit. And it seemed to me that I had
been nothing but the instrument of a tyrant's fury. I too am a
poor man, humbly of the people. And I have slain at this Prince's
bidding others of my kind. Yes, Father, it was as if the skies
opened above all that blood and terror and I could see the scorn
and pity of heaven."</p>

<p>He lay back on his pallet and the tears stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>"How may I make amends?" he muttered. "If I live, I too will
be a monk. But I shall never forget Limoges."</p>

<p>"Terrible and vile are the powers of darkness," said the
Abbot, "and so little may man do against them, yet always
something! Here in this cloister we have one small child saved
from a whole waste of war. And you have seen many children slain.
Yet, if God gave you life it might be that you could also save
one. Kindness, charity and pity find it difficult to take root in
this world. Yet, like weeds in a hard stone wall, here and there
they flower."</p>

<p>"Christ died to save such as they," sobbed the English
man-at-arms, "so many hundred years ago&mdash;and still, this.
Give me a crucifix."</p>

<p>When he had this in his hand he whispered strangely:</p>

<p>"Thank God for Christ!"</p>

<p>Brother Francis said:</p>

<p>"Shall we not all go pray for these poor souls who were
murdered in Limoges?"</p>

<p>The Abbot replied:</p>

<p>"We will pray for them, but let us not forget the English
Prince. It is the tyrant, not the oppressed, who stands most in
need of pity. They whom he caused to be slain are at peace in
Paradise, but he must live to take his punishment."</p>

<p>"He is a sick man," murmured the soldier. "Saw you not how he
went by on a litter? He is punished."</p>

<p>The monks all said:</p>

<p>"God have mercy on Edward Prince of Wales and Duke of
Aquitaine! God forgive his sins!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; LEAVE-TAKING</h2>

<p class="first">NUNREDDIN the Oriental was weary of watching in
the sick chamber and of the weight of his monk's habit. His lean,
hollowed, yellow face, which had long since ceased to express any
emotion, was sunk on his breast. His deep-set eyes with their
impressive stare were hidden by the heavy lids.</p>

<p>He detested this cold. He longed for Egypt, for Persia, for
Mesopotamia, where he could hold out his hands and feel heat,
like waves flowing over them. He yearned for the harsh sand burnt
to silver by the sun, for the crude green of dry palm trees, for
the little white houses with the green blinds and shutters, so
glaring without, so cool within.</p>

<p>He had had enough of Europe. He was weary even of his own
skill which had proved so useless.</p>

<p>Edward of Wales he had known to be a dying man when he had
first met him. Day by day he had watched his ruined body
withering.</p>

<p>The effort which the English Paragon had made to wreak his
vengeance on Limoges, had hastened his fatal disease. He could
not stand upright even for half an hour of the day.</p>

<p>Nunreddin's drugs were no longer of any avail in his bouts of
pain.</p>

<p>Nor had the Oriental been able to save the child. The youngest
Edward Plantagenet had sickened suddenly of some foul disease
engendered by war. The Oriental, disguised in his Christian
monk's robe, had watched by the little Prince's bed for three
days and three nights, and then he had died between his
hands.</p>

<p>The mother, seeing her brightest hope thus snatched from her,
her husband sick, nay even dying, and her other son but a babe in
arms, had fallen into shrieking despair. Dishevelled, without her
paint, in the bitter light of the winter daybreak, she had looked
an old woman. She knew now she never would be Queen. Edward of
Wales had not been near his dead son. When he had heard of the
end of the illness he had said nothing.</p>

<p>And Nunreddin had mused:</p>

<p>"Does he think of all those other children slain in Limoges,
and wonder that God should demand this one of him?"</p>

<p>Now he would leave for England without even waiting for his
child's funeral rites.</p>

<p>By elaborate and stately ceremonies he had relegated all his
authority to John of Lancaster. But, put what gloss on it the
English could, the French Provinces were lost. Charles of Valois
had triumphed.</p>

<p>This so-called craven and coward, who never left his palace on
the Seine, but spent his time with astrologers, monks, and
bookish scholars, had now by cunning diplomacy outwitted the
famous Plantagenet.</p>

<p>Nunreddin looked out from a window of the Abbey of St.
Andrew.</p>

<p>The day was so cold, so without radiance, it was difficult to
believe that the sun would ever shine again. It was the very
stillness of the depth of winter, when the heart of nature seems
to stop.</p>

<p>The courtyard was full of men-at-arms and all the flaunting
colours of the English chivalry, but these hung heavy and idle in
the heavy air, ruffled now and then by a rising wind.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster was there predominant in great bravery. He
was full of grief for his brother's sickness, for his brother's
loss, and yet a man not discontent. He had authority. He was
invested with all the remnants of English power in Aquitaine,
Guienne and Gascony. With his dark, bitter wife, he had invested
himself with the title of King of Castile and Leon.</p>

<p>Nunreddin guessed most of his thoughts, yes, and guessed still
another, which he was sure lay deep in the young man's ambitious
secret soul. Now that the young boy was dead, there was but a
sickly infant between himself and the throne of England. Fourth
son as he was, he named his brothers of little account. Six stout
knights slowly bore out the litter of the sick Edward of Wales
through the Abbey doorway.</p>

<p>Nunreddin peered curiously down at the man who had lost
everything&mdash;his health, his reputation, his heir. Edward of
Wales would never look splendid again until his effigy, encased
in full armour, lay on his tomb in the great Cathedral at
Canterbury.</p>

<p>Nothing remained of his magnificence, save his great height.
His hands were folded on his breast in an attitude of fatigue,
defeat and resignation. Fur and silk coverlets were piled over
him to keep his shivering sick body from the sharp January
air.</p>

<p>The Prince's litter halted amid his escort.</p>

<p>One of the knights, looking up and seeing Nunreddin at the
window, beckoned to him to come down. The Prince had asked for
him. The Oriental went reluctantly. He had already refused the
Prince's invitation to return with him to England. He loathed the
thought of that grey, distant, fogbound island, the senile King
and his rapacious mistress.</p>

<p>He went slowly, halting on the stairs to allow the Princess
Jeannette to pass, holding close to her the young Richard,
England's heir, a puling child.</p>

<p>Arrived at the litter, Nunreddin bowed low and waited for the
Prince to speak.</p>

<p>Edward exerted himself to turn his head on his pillow and look
down at the man standing humbly in his monk's robe.</p>

<p>In a feeble voice he said that he wished to reward him for his
services, for his attendance on the young Prince lately dead.</p>

<p>"I am not yet so poor but that I can pay those who serve me."
And he added on a note of appeal:</p>

<p>"Come to England and I will entreat you well."</p>

<p>Nunreddin courteously refused.</p>

<p>"Sire, I must to Africa. I am under vows," he added, knowing
that that would silence the Prince's importunities.</p>

<p>Edward sighed.</p>

<p>"You are a strange wandering man. I would pay you very well to
stay by me. You know rarer secrets than any of my doctors.
Perhaps," he added, "you have been bribed to go to the King of
Navarre who, I hear, sickens daily. God help us all!" The prone
man crossed himself. "They say he is smitten with the
leprosy."</p>

<p>"No," said Nunreddin, "I do not go to the King of Navarre.
Sire, I have had enough of Europe."</p>

<p>"Have you warrants?" asked the Prince courteously.</p>

<p>Nunreddin smiled.</p>

<p>"I go by by-ways, by secret paths where no man demands
authority," he replied.</p>

<p>"Your reward then? I would not leave you unfee'd."</p>

<p>Nunreddin considered if there was anything that he really
wished for from Edward of Wales. Neither money nor treasure was
of any use to him. He could make his way anywhere, get his living
either honestly or by cunning. He was always sure of shelter and
good companionship.</p>

<p>"There is nothing, sire," he replied sincerely.</p>

<p>But Edward of Wales could not endure, on top of all the other
affronts and stings of fortune, to be in the debt of an inferior.
He pulled a large ruby ring off his finger and dropped it over
the side of the litter.</p>

<p>"Farewell," he said abruptly, and turned his head aside.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster, who was watching him anxiously, took this
as a signal and the cavalcade moved off to the stately clatter of
the hoofs of war-horses, the rise and fall of beautiful standards
and pennants, the clank of armour and weapons.</p>

<p>Nunreddin picked up the ruby ring from the cobbles. It was of
great value.</p>

<p>A malformed beggar was creeping about the gateway, exposing
his filthy sores and disgusting rags to the departing knights and
whining for alms.</p>

<p>Nunreddin flung to him the jewel and, returning to his
apartments, picked up the white cat of Seville which was sleeping
in a voluptuous attitude of ease before the small brazier.</p>

<p>"Come, my beauty, come, my sweet," smiled Nunreddin, "we will
away from these sorry happenings. Into the sunshine, my friend,
where you can sleep and I can muse for hours, with nothing to
do."</p>

<p>The soft creature snuggled into his bosom behind the coarse
folds of the monk's garment.</p>

<p>"You are not troubled," said Nunreddin, "with sins or
penances, triumph or failure. You are the best company in the
world."</p>

<p>He went down to the harbour where the great ships, some of the
most proud and lovely of the works of man, rested on the sullen
ocean; the violent colours of the English Standard were vivid
against the bitter ash-hued sky.</p>

<p>Very gorgeous and magnificently manned was the mighty vessel
which had come to carry Edward of Wales home to die.</p>

<p>Nunreddin watched the splendid knights embark. He waited till
the litter bearing the English Paragon went slowly and painfully
across the gangway. For a moment the huge and superbly-apparelled
figure of the dying man prone on his litter was outlined against
the sad grey of winter. A few flakes of snow fell.</p>

<p>Nunreddin turned away, his face set towards the East. The
sudden wind blew slantwise the snowflakes and filled out the
sails, radiant with the English Leopards.</p>

<p>John of Lancaster sat his black horse amid his knights on the
quayside, he was dim-eyed at this sad parting from his
brother.</p>

<p>Nunreddin went on his way gladly, leaving all these things
behind him. He caressed the white cat which lay snug in his bosom
and seemed content.</p>

<h2><a id="notes"></a>NOTES</h2>

<h3>The actual period covered is from 1366-1371.</h3>

<p class="first">What is now known as the Kingdom of Spain, at
this time was divided into the Moorish realm of Granada and the
kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Leon and Navarre, this last was
ruled by a French Prince, Charles I, who inherited through his
mother, Jeanne II. Edward of Wales ruled in his father's name the
Provinces ceded to England at the Treaty of Bretigny, 1360, which
gave to Edward III Guienne, Gascony, Ponthieu and Calais;
Aquitaine already belonged (nominally) to England through the
marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine with Henry II; since that period
the Kings of England had been Dukes of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>By the Treaty of Bretigny, Edward III waived his claims to
the Crown of France and his feudal rights over Normandy, etc.,
this caused a break or truce in the Hundred Years War.</p>

<p>Urban V was one of the last of the French Popes to reside
in Avignon under the protection of France. On 16th October, 1367,
Urban made his public entry into Rome before the wondering gaze
of multitudes of eager spectators. For nearly sixty-five years no
pope had been seen in the Eternal City and only the aged among
the spectators could recall the memory of Benedict XI. The Pope
rode on a white mule, and was attended in the procession by about
four thousand cavalry, a great number of infantry and over two
thousand bishops, abbots and clergy of all ranks.</p>

<p>At the end of his life he returned to Avignon on the plea
that he desired to negotiate for peace between the Kings of
France and England. Some writers suppose that Urban, knowing
himself to be in failing health, wished to die in his own
country.</p>

<p>On reaching Avignon where he was received with great joy,
Pope Urban sent messages to the Kings of France and England,
inviting them to an interview. Meantime, however, his illness
increased and he caused himself to be carried to the church of
St. Peter in Avignon. There, in front of the high altar, he died
on 19th December, 1370. He was buried in the cathedral at
Avignon, but two years later his remains were translated to the
church of St. Victor at Marseilles, where he had been abbot.</p>

<p>It is recorded of Pope Urban V that he encouraged learning,
and during his pontificate he maintained at his own expense and
supplied with books, a thousand poor students at the
universities. (See A Chronicle of the Popes by A. E. McKilliam,
M.A., 1912.</p>

<p>The splendours of Papal Avignon came to an end under the
last Avignon Pope, Benedict XIII (Pietro de Luna), during the
siege of 1411, when the gorgeous palaces of Clement VI and
Benedict XII and the superb gardens of Urban V were reduced to
ruins.</p>
