<p>To her who, cast with me in trying days, <br>
  Stood in the place of health and power and praise;&mdash; <br>
  Who, when I thought all light was out, became <br>
  A lamp of hope that put my fears to shame;&mdash; <br>
  Who faced for love&rsquo;s sole sake the life austere <br>
  That waits upon the man of letters here;&mdash; <br>
  Who, unawares, her deep affection showed, <br>
  By many a touching little wifely mode;&mdash; <br>
  Whose spirit, self-denying, dear, divine, <br>
  Its sorrows hid, so it might lessen mine, &mdash; <br>
  To her, my bright, best friend, I dedicate <br>
  This book of songs. &rsquo;Twill help to compensate <br>
  For much neglect. The act, if not the rhyme, <br>
  Will touch her heart, and lead her to the time <br>
  Of trials past. That which is most intense <br>
  Within these leaves is of her influence; <br>
  And if aught here is sweetened with a tone <br>
  Sincere, like love, it came of love alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PrefatorySonnets"></a>Prefatory Sonnets</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>I.</b></h3>
<p>I purposed once to take my pen and write, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not songs, like some, tormented and awry <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With passion, but a cunning harmony <br>
  Of words and music caught from glen and height, <br>
  And lucid colours born of woodland light <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shining places where the sea-streams lie. <br>
  But this was when the heat of youth glowed white, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since I&rsquo;ve put the faded purpose by. <br>
  I have no faultless fruits to offer you <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who read this book; but certain syllables <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein are borrowed from unfooted dells <br>
  And secret hollows dear to noontide dew; <br>
  And these at least, though far between and few, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May catch the sense like subtle forest spells. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b>II.</b></h3>
<p>So take these kindly, even though there be <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some notes that unto other lyres belong, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stray echoes from the elder sons of song; <br>
  And think how from its neighbouring native sea<br>
  The pensive shell doth borrow melody. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not do the lordly masters wrong <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By filching fair words from the shining throng<br>
  Whose music haunts me as the wind a tree.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, when a stranger in soft Syrian glooms <br>
  Shot through with sunset, treads the cedar dells, <br>
  And hears the breezy ring of elfin bells <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far down be where the white-haired cataract booms, <br>
  He, faint with sweetness caught from forest smells, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bears thence, unwitting, plunder of perfumes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHutByTheBlackSwamp"></a>The Hut By The Black Swamp</b></h2>
<p>Now comes the fierce North-Easter, bound <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About with clouds and racks of rain, <br>
  And dry, dead leaves go whirling round <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rings of dust, and sigh like pain <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the plain. </p>
<p>Now Twilight, with a shadowy hand <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wild dominionship, doth keep <br>
  Strong hold of hollow straits of land, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watery sounds are loud and deep <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By gap and steep. </p>
<p>Keen fitful gusts that fly before <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of storm when day hath shut <br>
  Its eyes on mountains, flaw by flaw, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet down by whistling boxtree-but <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the hut. </p>
<p>And ringed and girt with lurid pomp, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far eastern cliffs start up and take <br>
  Thick steaming vapours from a swamp <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lieth like a great blind lake <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of face opaque. </p>
<p>The moss that like a tender grief, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About an English ruin clings &mdash; <br>
  What time the wan autumnal leaf <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faints, after many wanderings <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On windy wings &mdash; </p>
<p>That gracious growth, whose quiet green <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is as a love in days austere, <br>
  Was never seen &mdash; hath never been &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On slab or roof, deserted here <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many a year. </p>
<p>Nor comes the bird whose speech is song &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose songs are silvery syllables <br>
  That unto glimmering woods belong, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deep, meandering mountain dells <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By yellow wells. </p>
<p>But rather here the wild-dog halts, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lifts the paw, and looks, and howls; <br>
  And here, in ruined forest-vaults, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abide dim, dark, death-featured owls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like monks in cowls. </p>
<p>Across this hut the nettle runs; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And livid adders make their lair <br>
  In corners dank from lack of suns; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of foetid furrows stare <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growths that scare. </p>
<p>Here Summer&rsquo;s grasp of fire is laid <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bark and slabs that rot, and breed <br>
  Squat ugly things of deadly shade&mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorpion, and the spiteful seed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of centipede. </p>
<p>Unhallowed thunders harsh and dry, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flaming noontides mute with heat, <br>
  Beneath the breathless, brazen sky, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon these rifted rafters beat <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With torrid feet. </p>
<p>And night by night, the fitful gale <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth carry past the bittern&rsquo;s boom, <br>
  The dingo&rsquo;s yell, the plover&rsquo;s wail, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While lumbering shadows start, and loom, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hiss through gloom. </p>
<p>No sign of grace &mdash; no hope of green, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool-blossomed seasons marks the spot; <br>
  But, chained to iron doom, I ween, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis left, like skeleton, to rot <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where ruth is not. </p>
<p>For on this Hut hath Murder writ, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bloody fingers hellish things; <br>
  And God will never visit it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flower or leaf of sweet-faced Springs, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or gentle wings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SeptemberInAustralia"></a>September In Australia</b></h2>
<p>Grey Winter hath gone, like a wearisome guest, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, behold, for repayment,<br>
  September comes in with the wind of the West <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Spring in her raiment!<br>
  The ways of the frost have been filled of the flowers <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the forest discovers<br>
  Wild wings with the halo of hyaline hours, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the music of lovers. </p>
<p>September, the maid with the swift, silver feet! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glides, and she graces <br>
  The valleys of coolness, the slopes of the heat, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her blossomy traces. <br>
  Sweet month with a mouth that is made of a rose, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lightens and lingers <br>
  In spots where the harp of the evening glows, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attuned by her fingers. </p>
<p>The stream from its home in the hollow hill slips <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a darling old fashion; <br>
  And the day goeth down with a song on its lips, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose key-note is passion.<br>
  Far out in the fierce, bitter front of the sea <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand and remember <br>
  Dead things that were brothers and sisters of thee, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resplendent September! </p>
<p>The West, when it blows at the fall of the noon, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beats on the beaches, <br>
  Is filled with a tender and tremulous tune <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That touches and teaches: <br>
  The stories of Youth, of the burden of Time, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the death of Devotion, <br>
  Come back with the wind, and are themes of the rhyme <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the waves of the ocean. </p>
<p>We, having a secret to others unknown, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cool mountain-mosses, <br>
  May whisper together, September, alone <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our loves and our losses! <br>
  One word for her beauty, and one for the grace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave to the hours; <br>
  And then we may kiss her, and suffer her face <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep with the flowers. </p>
<p>High places that knew of the gold and the white <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the forehead of Morning, <br>
  Now darken and quake, and the steps of the Night <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are heavy with warning! <br>
  Her voice in the distance is lofty and loud, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the echoing gorges; <br>
  She hath hidden her eyes in a mantle of cloud, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her feet in the surges! </p>
<p>On the tops of the hills; on the turreted cones &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief temples of thunder &mdash; <br>
  The gale, like a ghost, in the middle watch moans, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gliding over and under. <br>
  The sea, flying white through the rack and the rain, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leapeth wild at the forelands; <br>
  And the plover, whose cry is like passion with pain, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complains in the moorlands. </p>
<p>Oh, season of changes &mdash; of shadow and shine &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September the splendid! <br>
  My song hath no music to mingle with thine, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its burden is ended: <br>
  But thou, being born of the winds and the sun, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mountain, by river, <br>
  Mayst lighten and listen, and loiter and run, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thy voices for ever. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="GhostGlen"></a>Ghost Glen</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your ears, stranger, or turn from Ghost Glen now, <br>
  For the paths are grown over, untrodden by men now&mdash; <br>
  Shut your ears, stranger,&rdquo; saith the grey mother, crooning <br>
  Her sorcery runic, when sets the half-moon in. </p>
<p>To-night the North-Easter goes travelling slowly, <br>
  But it never stoops down to that Hollow unholy; <br>
  To-night it rolls loud on the ridges red-litten, <br>
  But it <i>canno</i>t abide in that forest,  sin-smitten. </p>
<p>For over the pitfall the moon-dew is thawing, <br>
  And, with never a body, two shadows stand sawing! <br>
  The wraiths of two sawyers <i>(step under  and under)</i>, <br>
  Who did a foul murder and were blackened with thunder! </p>
<p>Whenever the storm-wind comes driven and driving, <br>
  Through the blood-spattered timber you may see the saw striving &mdash; <br>
  You may see the saw heaving, and falling, and heaving, <br>
  Whenever the sea-creek is chafing and grieving! </p>
<p>And across a burnt body, as black as an adder, <br>
  Sits the sprite of a sheep-dog (was ever sight sadder?) <br>
  For, as the dry thunder splits louder and faster, <br>
  This sprite of a sheep-dog howls for his master. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, count your beads deftly,&rdquo; saith the grey mother,  crooning <br>
  Her sorcery runic, when sets the half-moon in. <br>
  And well may she mutter, for the dark, hollow laughter <br>
  You will hear in the sawpits and the bloody logs after. </p>
<p>Ay, count your beads deftly, and keep your ways wary, <br>
  For the sake of the Saviour and sweet Mother Mary! <br>
  Pray for your peace in these perilous places, <br>
  And pray for the laying of horrible faces! </p>
<p>One starts, with a forehead wrinkled and livid, <br>
  Aghast at the lightnings sudden and vivid! <br>
  One telleth, with curses, the gold that they drew there <br>
  (Ah! cross your breast humbly) from him whom they slew there! </p>
<p>The stranger, who came from the loved &mdash; the romantic <br>
  Island that sleeps on the moaning Atlantic; <br>
  Leaving behind him a patient home yearning <br>
  For the steps in the distance, never returning;&mdash; </p>
<p>Who was left in the Forest, shrunken and starkly <br>
  Burnt by his slayers (so men have said, darkly): <br>
  With the half-crazy sheep-dog, who cowered beside there, <br>
  And yelled at the silence, and marvelled, and died there! </p>
<p>Yea, cross your breast humbly, and hold your breath  tightly, <br>
  Or fly for your life from those shadows unsightly; <br>
  From the set staring features (cold, and so young too!) <br>
  And the death on the lips that a mother hath clung to. </p>
<p>I tell you, that bushman is braver than most men, <br>
  Who even in daylight doth go through the Ghost Glen, <br>
  Although in that Hollow, unholy and lonely, <br>
  He sees the dank sawpits and bloody logs only. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Daphne"></a>Daphne</b></h2>
<p>Daphne! Ladon&rsquo;s daughter, Daphne! Set thyself in silver  light, <br>
  Take thy thoughts of fairest texture, weave them into words of white &mdash; <br>
  Weave the rhyme of rose-lipped Daphne, nymph of wooded stream and shade, <br>
  Flying love of bright Apollo, &mdash; fleeting type of faultless maid! <br>
  She, when followed from the forelands by the lord of lyre and lute, <br>
  Sped towards far-singing waters, past deep gardens flushed with fruit; <br>
  Took the path against Peneus, panted by its yellow banks; <br>
  Turned, and looked, and flew the faster through grey-tufted thicket ranks; <br>
  Flashed amongst high flowered sedges: leaped across the brook, and ran <br>
  Down to where the fourfold shadows of a nether glade began; <br>
  There she dropped, like falling Hesper, heavy hair of radiant head <br>
  Hiding all the young abundance of her beauty&rsquo;s white and red. </p>
<p>Came the yellow-tressed Far-darter &mdash; came the god whose  feet are fire, <br>
  On his lips the name of Daphne, in his eyes a great desire; <br>
  Fond, full lips of lord and lover, sad because of suit denied; <br>
  Clear, grey eyes made keen by passion, panting, pained, unsatisfied. <br>
  Here he turned, and there he halted, now he paused, and now he flew, <br>
  Swifter than his sister&rsquo;s arrows, through soft dells of dreamy dew. <br>
  Vext with gleams of Ladon&rsquo;s daughter, dashed along the son of Jove, <br>
  Fast upon flower-trammelled Daphne fleeting on from grove to grove; <br>
  Flights of seawind hard behind him, breaths of bleak and whistling straits; <br>
  Drifts of driving cloud above him, like a troop of fierce-eyed fates! <br>
  So he reached the water-shallows; then he stayed his steps, and heard <br>
  Daphne drop upon the grasses, fluttering like a wounded bird. </p>
<p>Was there help for Ladon&rsquo;s daughter? Saturn&rsquo;s son is high  and just: <br>
  Did he come between her beauty and the fierce Far-darter&rsquo;s lust? <br>
  As she lay, the helpless maiden, caught and bound in fast eclipse, <br>
  Did the lips of god drain pleasure from her sweet and swooning lips? <br>
  Now that these and all Love&rsquo;s treasures blushed, before the spoiler, bare, <br>
  Was the wrong that shall be nameless done, and seen, and suffered there? <br>
  No! for Zeus is King and Father. Weary nymph and fiery god, <br>
  Bend the knee alike before him &mdash; he is kind, and he is lord! <br>
  Therefore sing how clear-browed Pallas &mdash; Pallas, friend of prayerful maid, <br>
  Lifted dazzling Daphne lightly, bore her down the breathless glade, <br>
  Did the thing that Zeus commanded: so it came to pass that he <br>
  Who had chased a white-armed virgin, caught at her, and clasped a tree. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheWarrigal"></a>The Warrigal</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>The Wild Dog</i></p>
<p>Through forest boles the storm-wind rolls, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vext of the sea-driv&rsquo;n rain,<br>
  And, up in the clift, through many a rift, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of torrents complain. <br>
  The sad marsh-fowl and the lonely owl <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are heard in the fog-wreaths grey,<br>
  When the warrigal wakes, and listens, and takes <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the woods that shelter the prey. </p>
<p>In the gully-deeps the blind creek sleeps, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the silver, showery moon<br>
  Glides over the hills, and floats, and fills, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreams in the dark lagoon;<br>
  While halting hard by the station yard, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aghast at the hut-flame nigh,<br>
  The Warrigal yells &mdash; and the flats and fells <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are loud with his dismal cry. </p>
<p>On the topmost peak of mountains bleak, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The south wind sobs, and strays<br>
  Through moaning pine, and turpentine, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rippling runnel ways;<br>
  And strong streams flow, and great mists go, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Warrigal starts to hear<br>
  The watch-dog&rsquo;s bark break sharp in the dark, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flees like a phantom of Fear! </p>
<p>The swift rains beat, and the thunders fleet <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wings of the fiery gale,<br>
  And down in the glen of pool and fen, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild gums whistle and wail, <br>
  As over the plains, and past the chains <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of waterholes glimmering deep,<br>
  The Warrigal flies from the Shepherd&rsquo;s cries, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the clamour of dogs and sheep. </p>
<p>The Warrigal&rsquo;s lair is pent in bare <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black rocks at the gorge&rsquo;s mouth:<br>
  It is set in ways where Summer strays <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sprites of flame and drouth;<br>
  But when the heights are touched with lights <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hoar-frost, sleet, and shine,<br>
  His bed is made of the dead grass-blade <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the leaves of the windy pine. </p>
<p>He roves through the lands of sultry sands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hunts in the iron range, <br>
  Untamed as surge of the far sea verge, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fierce and fickle and strange. <br>
  The white man&rsquo;s track and the haunts of the black <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shuns, and shudders to see; <br>
  For his joy he tastes in lonely wastes <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where his mates are torrent and tree. </p>

<p>River, myrtle rimmed, and set <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep amongst unfooted dells &mdash; <br>
  Daughter of grey hills of wet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born by mossed and yellow wells &mdash; </p>
<p>Now that soft September lays <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender hands on thee and thine, <br>
  Let me think of blue-eyed days, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star-like flowers and leaves of shine! </p>
<p>Cities soil the life with rust: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water banks are cool and sweet: <br>
  River, tired of noise and dust <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I come to rest my feet. </p>
<p>Now the month from shade to sun <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleets and sings supremest songs, <br>
  Now the wilful woodwinds run <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the tangled cedar throngs. </p>
<p>Here are cushioned tufts and turns <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sumptuous noontide lies. <br>
  Here are seen by flags and ferns <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer&rsquo;s large, luxurious eyes. </p>
<p>On this spot wan Winter casts <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes of ruth, and spares its green <br>
  From his bitter sea-nursed blasts, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spears of rain and hailstones keen. </p>
<p>Rather here abideth Spring, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady of a lovely land, <br>
  Dear to leaf and fluttering wing, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in blooms &mdash; by breezes fanned. </p>
<p>Faithful friend beyond the main &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend that time nor change makes cold &mdash; <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallid perished days of old. </p>
<p>Ah, the days! &mdash; the old, old theme <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never stale, but never new, <br>
  Floating, like a pleasant dream, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to me and back to you. </p>
<p>Since we rested on these slopes, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seasons fierce have beaten down <br>
  Ardent loves and blossoming hopes &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loves that lift, and hopes that crown. </p>
<p>But, believe me, still mine eyes <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often fill with light that springs <br>
  From divinity, which lies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever at the heart of things. </p>
<p>Solace do I sometimes find <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you used to hear with me <br>
  Songs of stream and forest-wind, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tones of wave and harp-like tree. </p>
<p>Araluen &mdash; home of dreams, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairer for its flowerful glade <br>
  Than the face of Persian streams <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the slopes of Syrian shade; </p>
<p>Why should I still love it so? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend and brother far away, <br>
  Ask the winds that come and go, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What hath brought me here to-day. </p>
<p>Evermore of you I think, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the leaves begin to fall, <br>
  Where our river breaks its brink, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a rest is over all. </p>
<p>Evermore in quiet lands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend of mine beyond the sea, <br>
  Memory comes with cunning hands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stays, and paints your face for me. </p>

<p align="center" class="note"><i>Charles Harpur was buried at Euroma, N.S.W., but this poem refers to
the grave of a stranger whose name is unknown.</i></p>
<p>They built his mound of the rough, red ground, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the dip of a desert dell, <br>
  Where all things sweet are killed by the heat, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scattered o&rsquo;er flat and fell. <br>
  In a burning zone they left him alone, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the uttermost western plain; <br>
  And the nightfall dim heard his funeral hymn <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voices of wind and rain. </p>
<p>The songs austere of the forests drear, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the echoes of clift and cave, <br>
  When the dark is keen where the storm hath been, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet over the far-away grave. <br>
  And through the days when the torrid rays <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike down on a coppery gloom, <br>
  Some spirit grieves in the perished leaves <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose theme is that desolate tomb. </p>
<p>No human foot, or paw of brute, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halts now where the stranger sleeps; <br>
  But cloud and star his fellows are, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rain that sobs and weeps. <br>
  The dingo yells by the far iron fells, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plover is loud in the range, <br>
  But they never come near to the slumberer here, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose rest is a rest without change. </p>
<p>Ah! in his life, had he mother or wife, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wait for his step on the floor? <br>
  Did beauty wax dim while watching for him <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who passed through the threshold no more? <br>
  Doth it trouble his head? He is one with the dead; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lies by the alien streams; <br>
  And sweeter than sleep is death that is deep <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unvexed by the lordship of dreams. </p>

  Whose stormy echo runs and rings <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like bells in wild disorder. </p>
<p>Fierce breath hath vexed the foreland&rsquo;s face, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It glistens, glooms, and glistens; <br>
  But deep within this quiet place <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Illa lies and listens. </p>
<p>Sweet Illa of the shining sands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sleeps in shady hollows <br>
  Where August flits with flowerful hands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silver Summer follows. </p>
<p>Far up the naked hills is heard <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noise of many waters; <br>
  But green-haired Illa lies unstirred <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst her star-like daughters. </p>
<p>The tempest pent in moaning ways <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakes the shepherd yonder, <br>
  But Illa dreams, unknown to days <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose wings are wind and thunder. </p>
<p>Here fairy hands and floral feet <br>

  Here, stained with grapes and smit with heat, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes Autumn, sweet and sober. </p>
<p>Here lovers rest, what time the red <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yellow colours mingle, <br>
  And daylight droops with dying head <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the western dingle. </p>
<p>And here, from month to month, the time <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is kissed by Peace and Pleasure, <br>
  While Nature sings her woodland rhyme <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hoards her woodland treasure. </p>
<p>Ah, Illa Creek! ere Evening spreads <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wings o&rsquo;er towns unshaded, <br>
  How oft we seek thy mossy beds <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lave our foreheads faded! </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength that lives, nor falters, <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touching tone because it dwells <br>

<p>Deep hidden in delicious floss <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It nestles, sister, from the heat: <br>
  A gracious growth of tender moss <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose nights are soft, whose days are sweet. </p>
<p>Swift gleams across its petals run, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With winds that hum a pleasant tune: <br>
  Serene surprises of the sun, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispers from the lips of Noon. </p>
<p>The evening-coloured apple-trees <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are faint with July&rsquo;s frosty breath; <br>
  But lo! this stranger getteth ease, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shines amidst the strays of Death! </p>
<p>And at the turning of the year, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When August wanders in the cold, <br>
  The raiment of the nursling here <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is rich with green and glad with gold. </p>
<p>Oh, friend of mine, to one whose eyes <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are vexed because of alien things, <br>
  For ever in the wall moss lies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace of hills and hidden springs. </p>
<p>From faithless lips and fickle lights <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tired pilgrim sets his face, <br>
  And thinketh here of sounds and sights <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many a lovely forest-place. </p>
<p>And when by sudden fits and starts <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset on the moss doth burn, <br>
  He often dreams, and lo, the marts <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And streets are changed to dells of fern! </p>
<p>For, let me say, the wilding placed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By hands unseen amongst these stones, <br>
  Restores a Past by Time effaced, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost loves and long-forgotten tones! </p>
<p>As sometimes songs and scenes of old <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come faintly unto you and me, <br>
  When winds are wailing in the cold, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rains are sobbing on the sea. </p>

<p>Turn from the ways of this Woman! Campaspe we call her by  name &mdash; <br>
  She is fairer than flowers of the fire &mdash; she is brighter than brightness of  flame. <br>
  As a song that strikes swift to the heart with the beat of the blood of the  South, <br>
  And a light and a leap and a smart, is the play of her perilous mouth. <br>
  Her eyes are as splendours that break in the rain at the set of the sun, <br>
  But turn from the steps of Campaspe &mdash; a Woman to look at and shun! </p>
<p>Dost thou know of the cunning of Beauty? Take heed to thyself  and beware <br>
  Of the trap in the droop in the raiment &mdash; the snare in the folds of the hair! <br>
  She is fulgent in flashes of pearl, the breeze with her breathing is sweet, <br>
  But fly from the face of the girl &mdash; there is death in the fall of her feet! <br>
  Is she maiden or marvel of marble? Oh, rather a tigress at wait <br>
  To pounce on thy soul for her pastime &mdash; a leopard for love or for hate. </p>
<p>Woman of shadow and furnace! She biteth her lips to  restrain <br>
  Speech that springs out when she sleepeth, by the stirs and the starts of her  pain. <br>
  As music half-shapen of sorrow, with its wants and its infinite wail, <br>
  Is the voice of Campaspe, the beauty at bay with her passion dead-pale. <br>
  Go out from the courts of her loving, nor tempt the fierce dance of desire <br>
  Where thy life would be shrivelled like stubble in the stress and the fervour  of fire! </p>
<p>I know of one, gentle as moonlight &mdash; she is sad as the  shine of the moon, <br>
  But touching the ways of her eyes are: she comes to my soul like a tune &mdash; <br>
  Like a tune that is filled with faint voices of the loved and the lost and the  lone, <br>
  Doth this stranger abide with my silence: like a tune with a tremulous tone. <br>
  The leopard, we call her, Campaspe! I pluck at a rose and I stir <br>
  To think of this sweet-hearted maiden &mdash; what name is too tender for her? </p>

<p>Where the strength of dry thunder splits hill-rocks  asunder, <br>

  By the gullies of deepness and ridges of steepness, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, the cattle track twists like a snake! <br>
  Like a sea of dead embers, burnt white by Decembers, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plain to the left of it lies; <br>
  And six fleeting horses dash down the creek courses <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the terror of thirst in their eyes. </p>
<p>The false strength of fever, that deadly deceiver, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives foot to each famishing beast; <br>
  And over lands rotten, by rain-winds forgotten, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirage gleams out in the east. <br>
  Ah! the waters are hidden from riders and ridden <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a stream where the cattle track dips; <br>
  And Death on their faces is scoring fierce traces, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the drouth is a fire on their lips. </p>
<p>It is far to the Station, and gaunt Desolation <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a spectre that glooms in the way; <br>
  Like a <i>red</i> smoke the air is, like a  hell-light its glare is, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as flame are the feet of the day. <br>
  The wastes are like metal that forges unsettle <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heat of the furnace is white; <br>
  And the cool breeze that bloweth when an English sun goeth, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is unknown to the wild Desert Night. </p>
<p>A cry of distress there! a horseman the less there! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mock-waters shine like a moon! <br>
  It is &ldquo;Speed, and speed faster from this hole of disaster! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And hurrah for yon God-sent lagoon!&rdquo; <br>
  Doth a devil deceive them? Ah, now let us leave them &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are burdened in life with the sad; <br>
  Our portion is trouble, our joy is a bubble, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gladdest is never too glad. </p>
<p>From the pale tracts of peril, past mountain heads  sterile, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a sweet river shadowed with reeds <br>
  Where Summer steps lightly, and Winter beams brightly, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoof-rutted cattle-track leads. <br>
  There soft is the moonlight, and tender the noon-light; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There fiery things falter and fall; <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wings of a peace over all. </p>
<p>Hush, bittern and plover! Go, wind, to thy cover <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away by the snow-smitten Pole! <br>

  Some men are successful after seasons distressful <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Now, masters, the drift of my tale] <br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ToDamascus"></a>To Damascus</b></h2>
<p>Where the sinister sun of the Syrians beat <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the brittle, bright stubble, <br>
  And the camels fell back from the swords of the heat, <br>
  Came Saul with a fire in the soles of his feet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a forehead of trouble. </p>
<p>And terrified faces to left and to right, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before and behind him, <br>
  Fled away with the speed of a maddening fright <br>
  To the cloughs of the bat and the chasms of night, <br>
  Each hoping the zealot would fail in his flight <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find him and bind him. </p>
<p>For, behold you! the strong man of Tarsus came down <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With breathings of slaughter, <br>
  From the priests of the city, the chiefs of the town <br>
  (The lords with the sword, and the sires with the gown), <br>
  To harry the Christians, and trample, and drown, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waste them like water. </p>
<p>He was <i>ever</i> a  fighter, this son of the Jews &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fighter in earnest; <br>
  And the Lord took delight in the strength of his thews, <br>
  For He knew he was one of the few He could choose <br>
  To fight out His battles and carry His news <br>
  Of a marvellous Truth through the dark and the dews, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the desert-lands furnaced! </p>
<p>He knew he was one of the few He could take <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For His mission supernal, <br>
  Whose feet would not falter, whose limbs would not ache, <br>
  Through the waterless lands of the thorn and the snake, <br>
  And the ways of the wild &mdash; bearing up for the sake <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a Beauty eternal. </p>
<p>And therefore the road to Damascus was burned <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a swift, sudden brightness; <br>
  While Saul, with his face in the bitter dust, learned <br>
  Of the sin which he did ere he tumbled, and turned <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aghast at God&rsquo;s whiteness! </p>
<p>Of the sin which he did ere he covered his head <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the strange revelation. <br>
  But, thereafter, you know of the life that he led; <br>
  How he preached to the peoples, and suffered, and sped <br>
  With the wonderful words which his Master had said, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From nation to nation. </p>
<p>Now would we be like him, who suffer and see, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Chooser should choose us! <br>
  For I tell you, brave brothers, whoever you be, <br>
  It is right, till all learn to look further, and see, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That our Master should use us! </p>
<p>It is right, till all learn to discover and class, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That our Master should task us: <br>
  For now we may judge of the Truth through a glass; <br>
  And the road over which they must evermore pass, <br>
  Who would think for the many, and fight for the mass, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the road to Damascus. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BellBirds"></a>Bell Birds</b></h2>
<p>By channels of coolness the echoes are calling, <br>
  And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling; <br>
  It lives in the mountain where moss and the sedges <br>
  Touch with their beauty the banks and the ledges. <br>
  Through brakes of the cedar and sycamore bowers <br>
  Struggles the light that is love to the flowers. <br>
  And, softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing, <br>
  The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing. </p>
<p>The silver-voiced bell-birds, the darlings of day-time! <br>
  They sing in September their songs of the May-time; <br>
  When shadows wax strong and the thunder-bolts hurtle, <br>
  They hide with their fear in the leaves of the myrtle; <br>
  When rain and the sunbeams shine mingled together, <br>
  They start up like fairies that follow fair weather; <br>
  And straightway the hues of their feathers unfolden <br>
  Are the green and the purple, the blue and the golden. </p>
<p>October, the maiden of bright yellow tresses, <br>
  Loiters for love in these cool wildernesses; <br>
  Loiters, knee-deep, in the grasses, to listen, <br>
  Where dripping rocks gleam and the leafy pools glisten: <br>
  Then is the time when the water-moons splendid <br>
  Break with their gold, and are scattered or blended <br>
  Over the creeks, till the woodlands have warning <br>
  Of songs of the bell-bird and wings of the Morning. </p>
<p>Welcome as waters unkissed by the summers <br>
  Are the voices of bell-birds to thirsty far-comers. <br>
  When fiery December sets foot in the forest, <br>
  And the need of the wayfarer presses the sorest, <br>
  Pent in the ridges for ever and ever <br>
  The bell-birds direct him to spring and to river, <br>
  With ring and with ripple, like runnels whose torrents <br>
  Are toned by the pebbles and leaves in the currents. </p>
<p>Often I sit, looking back to a childhood, <br>
  Mixt with the sights and the sounds of the wildwood, <br>
  Longing for power and the sweetness to fashion, <br>
  Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of Passion;&mdash; <br>
  Songs interwoven of lights and of laughters <br>
  Borrowed from bell-birds in far forest-rafters; <br>
  So I might keep in the city and alleys <br>
  The beauty and strength of the deep mountain valleys, <br>
  Charming to slumber the pain of my losses <br>
  With glimpses of creeks and a vision of mosses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADeathInTheBush"></a>A Death In The Bush</b></h2>
<p>The hut was built of bark and shrunken slabs <br>
  That wore the marks of many rains, and showed <br>
  Dry flaws wherein had crept and nestled rot. <br>
  Moreover, round the bases of the bark <br>
  Were left the tracks of flying forest-fires, <br>
  As you may see them on the lower bole <br>
  Of every elder of the native woods. </p>
<p>For, ere the early settlers came and stocked <br>
  These wilds with sheep and kine, the grasses grew <br>
  So that they took the passing pilgrim in, <br>
  And whelmed him, like a running sea, from sight. </p>
<p>And therefore, through the fiercer summer months, <br>
  While all the swamps were rotten &mdash; while the flats <br>
  Were baked and broken; when the clayey rifts <br>
  Yawned wide, half-choked with drifted herbage past, <br>
  Spontaneous flames would burst from thence, and race <br>
  Across the prairies all day long. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At  night <br>
  The winds were up, and then, with four-fold speed, <br>
  A harsh gigantic growth of smoke and fire <br>
  Would roar along the bottoms, in the wake <br>
  Of fainting flocks of parrots, wallaroos, <br>
  And &rsquo;wildered wild things, scattering right and left, <br>
  For safety vague, throughout the general gloom. </p>
<p>Anon the nearer hillside-growing trees <br>
  Would take the surges; thus from bough to bough <br>
  Was borne the flaming terror! Bole and spire, <br>
  Rank after rank, now pillared, ringed, and rolled <br>
  In blinding blaze, stood out against the dead, <br>
  Down-smothered dark, for fifty leagues away. </p>
<p>For fifty leagues! and when the winds were strong <br>
  For fifty more! But in the olden time <br>
  These fires were counted as the harbingers <br>
  Of life-essential storms; since out of smoke <br>
  And heat there came across the midnight ways <br>
  Abundant comfort, with upgathered clouds, <br>
  And runnels babbling of a plenteous fall. </p>
<p>So comes the Southern gale at evenfall <br>
  (The swift &ldquo;brick-fielder&rdquo; of the local folk) <br>
  About the streets of Sydney, when the dust <br>
  Lies burnt on glaring windows, and the men <br>
  Look forth from doors of drouth, and drink the change <br>
  With thirsty haste and that most thankful cry <br>
  Of, &ldquo;Here it is &mdash; the cool, bright, blessed rain!&rdquo; </p>
<p>The hut, I say, was built of bark and slabs, <br>
  And stood, the centre of a clearing, hemmed <br>
  By hurdle-yards, and ancients of the blacks; <br>
  These moped about their lazy fires, and sang <br>
  Wild ditties of the old days, with a sound <br>
  Of sorrow, like an everlasting wind, <br>
  Which mingled with the echoes of the noon, <br>
  And moaned amongst the noises of the night. </p>
<p>From thence a cattle track, with link to link, <br>
  Ran off against the fish-pools, to the gap <br>
  Which sets you face to face with gleaming miles <br>
  Of broad Orara, winding in amongst <br>
  Black, barren ridges, where the nether spurs <br>
  Are fenced about by cotton scrub, and grass <br>
  Blue-bitten with the salt of many droughts. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas here the shepherd housed him every night, <br>
  And faced the prospect like a patient soul; <br>
  Borne up by some vague hope of better days, <br>
  And God&rsquo;s fine blessing in his faithful wife, <br>
  Until the humour of his malady <br>
  Took cunning changes from the good to bad, <br>
  And laid him lastly on a bed of death. </p>
<p>Two months thereafter, when the summer heat <br>
  Had roused the serpent from his rotten lair, <br>
  And made a noise of locusts in the boughs, <br>
  It came to this, that as the blood-red sun <br>
  Of one fierce day of many slanted down <br>
  Obliquely past the nether jags of peaks <br>
  And gulfs of mist, the tardy night came vexed <br>
  By belted clouds, and scuds that wheeled and whirled <br>
  To left and right about the brazen clifts <br>
  Of ridges, rigid with a leaden gloom. </p>
<p>Then took the cattle to the forest camps <br>
  With vacant terror, and the hustled sheep <br>
  Stood dumb against the hurdles, even like <br>
  A fallen patch of shadowed mountain snow; <br>
  And ever through the curlew&rsquo;s call afar <br>
  The storm grew on, while round the stinted slabs <br>
  Sharp snaps and hisses came, and went, and came, <br>
  The huddled tokens of a mighty blast <br>
  Which ran with an exceeding bitter cry <br>
  Across the tumbled fragments of the hills, <br>
  And through the sluices of the gorge and glen. </p>
<p>So, therefore, all about the shepherd&rsquo;s hut <br>
  That space was mute, save when the fastened dog, <br>
  Without a kennel, caught a passing glimpse <br>
  Of firelight moving through the lighted chinks; <br>
  For then he knew the hints of warmth within, <br>
  And stood and set his great pathetic eyes, <br>
  In wind and wet, imploring to be loosed. </p>
<p>Not often now the watcher left the couch <br>
  Of him she watched; since in his fitful sleep <br>
  His lips would stir to wayward themes, and close <br>
  With bodeful catches. Once she moved away, <br>
  Half-deafened by terrific claps, and stooped, <br>
  And looked without; to see a pillar dim <br>
  Of gathered gusts and fiery rain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon <br>
  The sick man woke, and, startled by the noise, <br>
  Stared round the room, with dull delirious sight, <br>
  At this wild thing and that; for through his eyes <br>
  The place took fearful shapes, and fever showed <br>
  Strange crosswise lights about his pillow-head. <br>
  He, catching there at some phantasmic help, <br>
  Sat upright on the bolster with a cry <br>
  Of &ldquo;Where is Jesus? It is bitter cold!&rdquo; <br>
  And then, because the thundercalls outside <br>
  Were mixed for him with slanders of the Past, <br>
  He called his weeping wife by name, and said, <br>
  &ldquo;Come closer, darling! We shall speed away <br>
  Across the seas, and seek some mountain home, <br>
  Shut in from liars, and the wicked words <br>
  That track us day and night and night and day.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So waned the sad refrain. And those poor lips, <br>
  Whose latest phrases were for peace, grew mute, <br>
  And into everlasting silence passed. </p>
<p>As fares a swimmer who hath lost his breath <br>
  In &rsquo;wildering seas afar from any help &mdash; <br>
  Who, fronting Death, can never realise <br>
  The dreadful Presence, but is prone to clutch <br>
  At every weed upon the weltering wave; <br>
  So fared the watcher, poring o&rsquo;er the last <br>
  Of him she loved, with dazed and stupid stare; <br>
  Half conscious of the sudden loss and lack <br>
  Of all that bound her life, but yet without <br>
  The power to take her mighty sorrow in. </p>
<p>Then came a patch or two of starry sky; <br>
  And through a reef of cloven thunder-cloud <br>
  The soft moon looked: a patient face beyond <br>
  The fierce impatient shadows of the slopes, <br>
  And the harsh voices of the broken hills! <br>
  A patient face, and one which came and wrought <br>
  A lovely silence, like a silver mist, <br>
  Across the rainy relics of the storm. </p>
<p>For in the breaks and pauses of her light <br>
  The gale died out in gusts: yet, evermore <br>
  About the roof-tree on the dripping eaves, <br>
  The damp wind loitered; and a fitful drift <br>
  Sloped through the silent curtains, and athwart <br>
  The dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, when the glare  had dropped behind <br>
  A mighty ridge of gloom, the woman turned <br>
  And sat in darkness, face to face with God, <br>
  And said, &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that Thou art wise; <br>
  That when we build and hope, and hope and build, <br>
  And see our best things fall, it comes to pass <br>
  For evermore that we must turn to Thee! <br>
  And therefore, now, because I cannot find <br>
  The faintest token of Divinity <br>
  In this my latest sorrow, let Thy light <br>
  Inform mine eyes, so I may learn to look <br>
  On something past the sight which shuts, and blinds <br>
  And seems to drive me wholly, Lord, from Thee.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Now waned the moon beyond complaining depths; <br>
  And as the dawn looked forth from showery woods <br>
  (Whereon had dropped a hint of red and gold), <br>
  There went about the crooked cavern-eaves <br>
  Low flute-like echoes, with a noise of wings, <br>
  And waters flying down far-hidden fells. <br>
  Then might be seen the solitary owl, <br>
  Perched in the clefts, scared at the coming light, <br>
  And staring outward (like a sea-shelled thing <br>
  Chased to his cover by some bright, fierce foe), <br>
  As at a monster in the middle waste. </p>
<p>At last the great kingfisher came, and called <br>
  Across the hollows, loud with early whips, <br>
  And lighted, laughing, on the shepherd&rsquo;s hut, <br>
  And roused the widow from a swoon like death. </p>
<p>This day, and after it was noised abroad, <br>
  By blacks, and straggling horsemen on the roads, <br>
  That he was dead &ldquo;who had been sick so long&rdquo;, <br>
  There flocked a troop from far-surrounding runs, <br>
  To see their neighbour, and to bury him. <br>
  And men who had forgotten how to cry <br>
  (Rough, flinty fellows of the native bush) <br>
  Now learned the bitter way, beholding there <br>
  The wasted shadow of an iron frame <br>
  Brought down so low by years of fearful pain, <br>
  And marking, too, the woman&rsquo;s gentle face, <br>
  And all the pathos in her moaned reply <br>
  Of &ldquo;Masters, we have lived in better days.&rdquo; </p>
<p>One stooped &mdash; a stockman from the nearer hills &mdash; <br>
  To loose his wallet-strings, from whence he took <br>
  A bag of tea, and laid it on her lap; <br>
  Then sobbing, &ldquo;God will help you, missus, yet,&rdquo; <br>
  He sought his horse, with most bewildered eyes, <br>
  And, spurring swiftly, galloped down the glen. </p>
<p>Where black Orara nightly chafes his brink, <br>
  Midway between lamenting lines of oak <br>
  And Warra&rsquo;s Gap, the shepherd&rsquo;s grave was built. <br>
  And there the wild dog pauses, in the midst <br>
  Of moonless watches, howling through the gloom <br>
  At hopeless shadows flitting to and fro, <br>
  What time the East Wind hums his darkest hymn, <br>
  And rains beat heavy on the ruined leaf. </p>
<p>There, while the Autumn in the cedar trees <br>
  Sat cooped about by cloudy evergreens, <br>
  The widow sojourned on the silent road, <br>
  And mutely faced the barren mound, and plucked <br>
  A straggling shrub from thence, and passed away, <br>
  Heart-broken on to Sydney, where she took <br>
  Her passage in an English vessel bound <br>
  To London, for her home of other years. </p>
<p>At rest! Not near, with Sorrow on his grave, <br>
  And roses quickened into beauty &mdash; wrapt <br>
  In all the pathos of perennial bloom; <br>
  But far from these, beneath the fretful clay <br>
  Of lands within the lone perpetual cry <br>
  Of hermit plovers and the night-like oaks, <br>
  All moaning for the peace which never comes. </p>
<p>At rest! And she who sits and waits behind <br>
  Is in the shadows; but her faith is sure, <br>
  And <i>one</i> fine promise of the coming  days <br>
  Is breaking, like a blessed morning, far <br>
  On hills that &ldquo;slope through darkness up to God.&rdquo; </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content I am to be. <br>
  You will not turn, my Darling, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor answer when I call; <br>
  But yours are soul are body <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love of mine and all! </p>
<p>You splendid Spaniard! listen &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion leaps to flame <br>
  For neck, and cheek, and dimple, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cunning shades of shame! <br>
  I tell you, I would gladly <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give Hell myself to keep, <br>
  To cling to, half a moment, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lips I taste in sleep. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hides in the dark of his hair; <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sound of a wonderful  song. </p>
<p>And he sees, through the rents of the scattering fogs, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corroboree warlike and grim, <br>

<p>Ill fares it with the man whose lips are set <br>
  To bitter themes and words that spite the gods: <br>
  For, seeing how the son of Saturn sways <br>
  With eyes and ears for all, this one shall halt <br>
  As on hard, hurtful hills; his days shall know <br>
  The plaintive front of Sorrow; level looks <br>
  With cries ill-favoured shall be dealt to him; <br>
  And <i>this</i> shall be that he may think  of peace <br>
  As one might think of alienated lips <br>
  Of sweetness touched for once in kind warm dreams. <br>
  Yea, fathers of the high and holy face, <br>
  This soul thus sinning shall have cause to sob <br>
  &ldquo;Ah, ah,&rdquo; for sleep, and space enough to learn <br>
  The wan, wild Hyrie&rsquo;s aggregated song <br>
  That starts the dwellers in distorted heights, <br>
  With all the meaning of perpetual sighs <br>
  Heard in the mountain deserts of the world, <br>
  And where the green-haired waters glide between <br>
  The thin, lank weeds and mallows of the marsh. </p>
<p>But thou to whom these things are like to shapes <br>
  That come of darkness &mdash; thou whose life slips past <br>
  Regarding rather these with mute fast mouth &mdash; <br>
  Hear none the less how fleet Telegonus, <br>
  The brass-clad hunter, first took oar and smote <br>
  Swift eastward-going seas, with face direct <br>
  For narrowing channels and the twofold coasts <br>
  Past Colchis and the fierce Symplegades, <br>
  And utmost islands, washed by streams unknown. </p>
<p>For in a time when Phasis whitened wide <br>
  And drove with violent waters blown of wind <br>
  Against the bare salt limits of the land, <br>
  It came to pass that, joined with Cytheraea, <br>
  The black-browed Ares, chafing for the wrong <br>
  Ulysses did him on the plains of Troy, <br>
  Set heart against the king; and when the storms <br>
  Sang high in thunder and the Thracian rain, <br>
  The god bethought him of a pale-mouthed priest <br>
  Of Thebae, kin to ancient Chariclo, <br>
  And of an omen which the prophet gave <br>
  That touched on death and grief to Ithaca; <br>
  Then, knowing how a heavy-handed fate <br>
  Had laid itself on Circe&rsquo;s brass-clad son, <br>
  He pricked the hunter with a lust that turned <br>
  All thoughts to travel and the seas remote; <br>
  But chiefly now he stirred Telegonus <br>
  To longings for his father&rsquo;s exiled face, <br>
  And dreams of rest and honey-hearted love, <br>
  And quiet death with much of funeral flame <br>
  Far in the mountains of a favoured land <br>
  Beyond the wars and wailings of the waves. </p>
<p>So past the ridges where the coast abrupt <br>
  Dips greyly westward, Circe&rsquo;s strong-armed son <br>
  Swept down the foam of sharp-divided straits <br>
  And faced the stress of opening seas. Sheer out <br>
  The vessel drave; but three long moons the gale <br>
  Moaned round; and swift, strong streams of fire revealed <br>
  The labouring rowers and the lightening surf, <br>
  Pale watchers deafened of sonorous storm, <br>
  And dipping decks and rents of ruined sails. <br>
  Yea, when the hollow ocean-driven ship <br>
  Wheeled sideways, like a chariot cloven through <br>
  In hard hot battle, and the night came up <br>
  Against strange headlands lying East and North, <br>
  Behold a black, wild wind with death to all <br>
  Ran shoreward, charged with flame and thunder-smoke, <br>
  Which blew the waters into wastes of white <br>
  And broke the bark, as lightning breaks the pine; <br>
  Whereat the sea in fearful circles showed <br>
  Unpitied faces turned from Zeus and light, <br>
  Wan swimmers wasted with their agony, <br>
  And hopeless eyes and moaning mouths of men. <br>
  But one held by the fragments of the wreck, <br>
  And Ares knew him for Telegonus, <br>
  Whom heavy-handed Fate had chained to deeds <br>
  Of dreadful note with sin beyond a name. <br>
  So, seeing this, the black-browed lord of war, <br>
  Arrayed about by Jove&rsquo;s authentic light, <br>
  Shot down amongst the shattered clouds and called <br>
  With mighty strain, betwixt the gaps of storm <br>
  &ldquo;Oceanus! Oceanus!&rdquo; Whereat <br>
  The surf sprang white, as when a keel divides <br>
  The gleaming centre of a gathered wave; <br>
  And, ringed with flakes of splendid fire of foam, <br>
  The son of Terra rose half-way and blew <br>
  The triple trumpet of the water-gods, <br>
  At which great winds fell back and all the sea <br>
  Grew dumb, as on the land a war-feast breaks <br>
  When deep sleep falls upon the souls of men. <br>
  Then Ares of the night-like brow made known <br>
  The brass-clad hunter of the facile feet, <br>
  Hard clinging to the slippery logs of pine, <br>
  And told the omen to the hoary god <br>
  That touched on Death and grief to Ithaca; <br>
  Wherefore Oceanus, with help of hand, <br>
  Bore by the chin the warrior of the North, <br>
  A moaning mass, across the shallowing surge, <br>
  And cast him on the rocks of alien shores <br>
  Against a wintry morning shot with storm. </p>
<p>Hear also, thou, how mighty gods sustain <br>
  The men set out to work the ends of Fate <br>
  Which fill the world with tales of many tears <br>
  And vex the sad face of Humanity: <br>
  Six days and nights the brass-clad chief abode <br>
  Pent up in caverns by the straitening seas, <br>
  And fed on ferns and limpets; but the dawn, <br>
  Before the strong sun of the seventh, brought <br>
  A fume of fire and smells of savoury meat <br>
  And much rejoicing, as from neighbouring feasts; <br>
  At which the hunter, seized with sudden lust, <br>
  Sprang up the crags, and, like a dream of Fear, <br>
  Leapt, shouting, at a huddled host of hinds <br>
  Amongst the fragments of their steaming food; <br>
  And as the hoarse wood-wind in Autumn sweeps <br>
  To every zone the hissing latter leaves, <br>
  So fleet Telegonus, by dint of spear <br>
  And strain of thunderous voice, did scatter these <br>
  East, South, and North: &rsquo;twas then the chief had rest, <br>
  Hard by the outer coast of Ithaca, <br>
  Unknown to him who ate the spoil and slept. <br>
  Nor stayed he hand thereafter; but when noon <br>
  Burned dead on misty hills of stunted fir, <br>
  This man shook slumber from his limbs, and sped <br>
  Against hoar beaches and the kindled cliffs <br>
  Of falling waters; these he waded through, <br>
  Beholding, past the forests of the West, <br>
  A break of light and homes of many men, <br>
  And shining corn, and flowers, and fruits of flowers. <br>
  Yea, seeing these, the facile-footed chief <br>
  Grasped by the knot the huge &AElig;aean lance <br>
  And fell upon the farmers; wherefore they <br>
  Left hoe and plough, and crouched in heights remote, <br>
  Companioned with the grey-winged fogs; but he <br>
  Made waste their fields and throve upon their toil &mdash; <br>
  As throve the boar, the fierce four-footed curse <br>
  Which Artemis did raise in Calydon <br>
  To make stern mouths wax white with foreign fear, <br>
  All in the wild beginning of the World. </p>
<p>So one went down and told Laertes&rsquo; son <br>
  Of what the brass-clad stranger from the straits <br>
  Had worked in Ithaca: whereat the King <br>
  Rose, like a god, and called his mighty heir, <br>
  Telemachus, the wisest of the wise; <br>
  And these two, having counsel, strode without, <br>
  And armed them with the arms of warlike days &mdash; <br>
  The helm, the javelin, and the sun-like shield, <br>
  And glancing greaves and quivering stars of steel! <br>
  Yea, stern Ulysses, rusted not with rest, <br>
  But dread as Ares, gleaming on his car <br>
  Gave out the reins; and straightway all the lands <br>
  Were struck by noise of steed and shouts of men, <br>
  And furious dust, and splendid wheels of flame. <br>
  Meanwhile the hunter (starting from a sleep <br>
  In which the pieces of a broken dream <br>
  Had shown him Circe with most tearful face), <br>
  Caught at his spear, and stood like one at bay <br>
  When Summer brings about Arcadian horns <br>
  And headlong horses mixt with maddened hounds; <br>
  Then huge Ulysses, like a fire of fight, <br>
  Sprang sideways on the flying car, and drave <br>
  Full at the brass-clad warrior of the North <br>
  His massive spear; but fleet Telegonus <br>
  Stooped from the death, but heard the speedy lance <br>
  Sing like a thin wind through the steaming air; <br>
  Yet he, dismayed not by the dreadful foe &mdash; <br>
  Unknown to him &mdash; dealt out his strength, and aimed <br>
  A strenuous stroke at great Laertes&rsquo; son, <br>
  Which missed the shield, but bit through flesh and bone, <br>
  And drank the blood, and dragged the soul from thence. <br>
  So fell the King! And one cried &ldquo;Ithaca! <br>
  Ah, Ithaca!&rdquo; and turned his face and wept. <br>
  Then came another &mdash; wise Telemachus &mdash; <br>
  Who knelt beside the man of many days <br>
  And pored upon the face; but lo, the life <br>
  Was like bright water spilt in sands of thirst, <br>
  A wasted splendour swiftly drawn away. <br>
  Yet held he by the dead: he heeded not <br>
  The moaning warrior who had learnt his sin &mdash; <br>
  Who waited now, like one in lairs of pain, <br>
  Apart with darkness hungry for his fate; <br>
  For had not wise Telemachus the lore <br>
  Which makes the pale-mouthed seer content to sleep <br>
  Amidst the desolations of the world? <br>
  So therefore he, who knew Telegonus, <br>
  The child of Circe by Laertes&rsquo; son, <br>
  Was set to be a scourge of Zeus, smote not, <br>
  But rather sat with moody eyes, and mused, <br>
  And watched the dead. For who may brave the gods? </p>
<p>Yet, O my fathers, when the people came, <br>
  And brought the holy oils and perfect fire, <br>
  And built the pile, and sang the tales of Troy &mdash; <br>
  Of desperate travels in the olden time, <br>
  By shadowy mountains and the roaring sea, <br>
  Near windy sands and past the Thracian snows &mdash; <br>
  The man who crossed them all to see his sire, <br>
  And had a loyal heart to give the King, <br>
  Instead of blows &mdash; this man did little more <br>
  Than moan outside the fume of funeral rites, <br>
  All in a rushing twilight full of rain, <br>
  And clap his palms for sharper pains than swords. <br>
  Yea, when the night broke out against the flame, <br>
  And lonely noises loitered in the fens, <br>
  This man nor stirred nor slept, but lay at wait, <br>
  With fastened mouth. For who may brave the gods? </p>

  Where a watery sound goeth moaning around &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God help our men at sea!</p>
<p>Oh! never a tempest blew on the shore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that some heart did moan<br>
  For a darling voice it would hear no more<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a face that had left it lone, lone, lone &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A face that had left it lone!<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy hand within the gale;<br>
  And cries may rise on the wings of the wind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mariners weary and pale, pale, pale &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mariners weary and pale!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis a fearful thing to know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the storm-winds loudly  blow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a man can sometimes come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too near to his father&rsquo;s home;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that he shall kneel and say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lord, I would be far away!&rdquo;<br>
  Ho! the hurricanes roar round a dangerous shore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ledges and over the lea;<br>
  And there twinkles a light on the billows so white &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God help our men at sea!</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Coogee"></a>Coogee</b></h2>
<p>Sing the song of wave-worn Coogee, Coogee in the distance  white, <br>
  With its jags and points disrupted, gaps and fractures fringed with light; <br>
  Haunt of gledes, and restless plovers of the melancholy wail <br>
  Ever lending deeper pathos to the melancholy gale. <br>
  There, my brothers, down the fissures, chasms deep and wan and wild, <br>
  Grows the sea-bloom, one that blushes like a shrinking fair blind child; <br>
  And amongst the oozing forelands many a glad, green rock-vine runs, <br>
  Getting ease on earthy ledges, sheltered from December suns. </p>
<p>Often, when a gusty morning, rising cold and gray and  strange, <br>
  Lifts its face from watery spaces, vistas full with cloudy change; <br>
  Bearing up a gloomy burden which anon begins to wane, <br>
  Fading in the sudden shadow of a dark, determined rain; <br>
  Do I seek an eastern window, so to watch the breakers beat <br>
  Round the steadfast crags of Coogee, dim with drifts of driving sleet: <br>
  Hearing hollow mournful noises sweeping down a solemn shore <br>
  While the grim sea-caves are tideless, and the storm strives at their core. </p>
<p>Often when the floating vapours fill the silent autumn  leas, <br>
  Dreaming memories fall like moonlight over silver sleeping seas, <br>
  Youth and I and Love together! &mdash; Other times and other themes <br>
  Come to me unsung, unwept for, through the faded evening gleams: <br>
  Come to me and touch me mutely &mdash; I that looked and longed so well, <br>
  Shall I look and yet forget them? who may know or who foretell? <br>
  Though the southern wind roams, shadowed with its immemorial grief, <br>
  Where the frosty wings of Winter leave their whiteness on the leaf. </p>
<p>Friend of mine beyond the waters, here and here these  perished days <br>
  Haunt me with their sweet dead faces and their old divided ways. <br>
  You that helped and you that loved me, take this song, and when you read, <br>
  Let the lost things come about you, set your thoughts and hear and heed. <br>
  Time has laid his burden on us: we who wear our manhood now, <br>
  We would be the boys we have been, free of heart and bright of brow &mdash; <br>
  Be the boys for just an hour, with the splendour and the speech <br>
  Of thy lights and thunders, Coogee, flying up thy gleaming beach. </p>
<p>Heart&rsquo;s desire and heart&rsquo;s division! who would come and  say to me <br>
  With the eyes of far-off friendship, &ldquo;You are as you used to be&rdquo;? <br>
  Something glad and good has left me here with sickening discontent, <br>
  Tired of looking, neither knowing what it was or where it went. <br>
  So it is this sight of Coogee, shining in the morning dew, <br>
  Sets me stumbling through dim summers once on fire with youth and you. <br>
  Summers pale as southern evenings when the year has lost its power, <br>
  And the wasted face of April weeps above the withered flower. </p>
<p>Not that seasons bring no solace &mdash; not that time lacks  light and rest; <br>
  But the old things were the dearest and the old loves seem the best. <br>
  We that start at songs familiar &mdash; we that tremble at a tone, <br>
  Floating down the ways of music, like a sigh of sweetness flown, <br>
  We can never feel the freshness, never find again the mood <br>
  Left among fair-featured places, brightened of our brotherhood; <br>
  This and this we have to think of when the night is over all, <br>
  And the woods begin to perish, and the rains begin to fall. </p>

<p>Stand out, swift-footed leaders of the horns, <br>
  And draw strong breath, and fill the hollowy cliff <br>
  With shocks of clamour, &mdash; let the chasm take <br>
  The noise of many trumpets, lest the hunt <br>
  Should die across the dim Aonian hills, <br>
  Nor break through thunder and the surf-white cave <br>
  That hems about the old-eyed Ogyges <br>
  And bars the sea-wind, rain-wind, and the sea! </p>
<p>Much fierce delight hath old-eyed Ogyges <br>
  (A hairless shadow in a lion&rsquo;s skin) <br>
  In tumult, and the gleam of flying spears, <br>
  And wild beasts vexed to death; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; sayeth he, <br>
  &ldquo;Here lying broken, do I count the days <br>
  For every trouble; being like the tree &mdash; <br>
  The many-wintered father of the trunks <br>
  On yonder ridges: wherefore it is well <br>
  To feel the dead blood kindling in my veins <br>
  At sound of boar or battle; yea to find <br>
  A sudden stir, like life, about my feet, <br>
  And tingling pulses through this frame of mine <br>
  What time the cold clear dayspring, like a bird <br>
  Afar off, settles on the frost-bound peaks, <br>
  And all the deep blue gorges, darkening down, <br>
  Are filled with men and dogs and furious dust!&rdquo; </p>
<p>So in the time whereof thou weetest well &mdash; <br>
  The melancholy morning of the World &mdash; <br>
  He mopes or mumbles, sleeps or shouts for glee, <br>
  And shakes his sides &mdash; a cavern-hutted King! <br>
  But when the ouzel in the gaps at eve <br>
  Doth pipe her dreary ditty to the surge <br>
  All tumbling in the soft green level light, <br>
  He sits as quiet as a thick-mossed rock, <br>
  And dreameth in his cold old savage way <br>
  Of gliding barges on the wine-dark waves, <br>
  And glowing shapes, and sweeter things than sleep, <br>
  But chiefly, while the restless twofold bat <br>
  Goes flapping round the rainy eaves above, <br>
  Where one broad opening letteth in the moon, <br>
  He starteth, thinking of that grey-haired man, <br>
  His sire: then oftentimes the white-armed child <br>
  Of thunder-bearing Jove, young Thebe, comes <br>
  And droops above him with her short sweet sighs <br>
  For Love distraught &mdash; for dear Love&rsquo;s faded sake <br>
  That weeps and sings and weeps itself to death <br>
  Because of casual eyes, and lips of frost, <br>
  And careless mutterings, and most weary years. </p>
<p>Bethink you, doth the wan &AElig;gyptian count <br>
  This passion, wasting like an unfed flame, <br>
  Of any worth now; seeing that his thighs <br>
  Are shrunken to a span and that the blood, <br>
  Which used to spin tumultuous down his sides <br>
  Of life in leaping moments of desire, <br>
  Is drying like a thin and sluggish stream <br>
  In withered channels &mdash; think you, doth he pause <br>
  For golden Thebe and her red young mouth? </p>
<p>Ah, golden Thebe &mdash; Thebe, weeping there, <br>
  Like some sweet wood-nymph wailing for a rock, <br>
  If Octis with the Apollonian face &mdash; <br>
  That fair-haired prophet of the sun and stars &mdash; <br>
  Could take a mist and dip it in the West <br>
  To clothe thy limbs of shine about with shine <br>
  And all the wonder of the amethyst, <br>
  He&rsquo;d do it &mdash; kneeling like a slave for thee! <br>
  If he could find a dream to comfort thee, <br>
  He&rsquo;d bring it: thinking little of his lore, <br>
  But marvelling greatly at those eyes of thine. <br>
  Yea, if the Shepherd waiting for thy steps, <br>
  Pent down amongst the dank black-weeded rims, <br>
  Could shed his life like rain about thy feet, <br>
  He&rsquo;d count it sweetness past all sweets of love <br>
  To die by thee &mdash; his life&rsquo;s end in thy sight. </p>
<p>Oh, but he loves the hunt, doth Ogyges! <br>
  And therefore should we blow the horn for him: <br>
  He, sitting mumbling in his surf-white cave <br>
  With helpless feet and alienated eyes, <br>
  Should hear the noises nathless dawn by dawn <br>
  Which send him wandering swiftly through the days <br>
  When like a springing cataract he leapt <br>
  From crag to crag, the strongest in the chase <br>
  To spear the lion, leopard, or the boar! <br>
  Oh, but he loves the hunt; and, while the shouts <br>
  Of mighty winds are in this mountained World, <br>
  Behold the white bleak woodman, Winter, halts <br>
  And bends to him across a beard of snow <br>
  For wonder; seeing Summer in his looks <br>
  Because of dogs and calls from throats of hair <br>
  All in the savage hills of Hyria! <br>
  And, through the yellow evenings of the year, <br>
  What time September shows her mooned front <br>
  And poppies burnt to blackness droop for drouth, <br>
  The dear Demeter, splashed from heel to thigh <br>
  With spinning vine-blood, often stoops to him <br>
  To crush the grape against his wrinkled lips <br>
  Which sets him dreaming of the thickening wolves <br>
  In darkness, and the sound of moaning seas. <br>
  So with the blustering tempest doth he find <br>
  A stormy fellowship: for when the North <br>
  Comes reeling downwards with a breath like spears, <br>
  Where Dryope the lonely sits all night <br>
  And holds her sorrow crushed betwixt her palms, <br>
  He thinketh mostly of that time of times <br>
  When Zeus the Thunderer &mdash; broadly-blazing King &mdash; <br>
  Like some wild comet beautiful but fierce, <br>
  Leapt out of cloud and fire and smote the tops <br>
  Of black Ogygia with his red right hand, <br>
  At which great fragments tumbled to the Deeps &mdash; <br>
  The mighty fragments of a mountain-land &mdash; <br>
  And all the World became an awful Sea! </p>
<p>But, being tired, the hairless Ogyges <br>
  Best loveth night and dim forgetfulness! <br>
  &ldquo;For,&rdquo; sayeth he, &ldquo;to look for sleep is good <br>
  When every sleep is as a sleep of death <br>
  To men who live, yet know not why they live, <br>
  Nor how they live! I have no thought to tell <br>
  The people when this time of mine began; <br>
  But forest after forest grows and falls, <br>
  And rock by rock is wasted with the rime, <br>
  While I sit on and wait the end of all; <br>
  Here taking every footstep for a sign; <br>
  An ancient shadow whiter than the foam!&rdquo; </p>

<p>The caves of the sea have been troubled to-day <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a wind that came down from the tops of the hills. <br>
  Behold I have seen on the threshold again <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A face in a dazzle of hair! <br>
  Do you know that she watches the rain, and the main, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the waves which are moaning there? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, moaning and moaning there! </p>
<p>Now turn from your casements, and fasten your doors, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cover your faces, and pray, if you can; <br>
  There are wails in the wind, there are sighs on the shores, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And alas, for the fate of a storm-beaten man! <br>
  Oh, dark falls the night on the rain-rutted verge, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sad with the sound of the foam! <br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="KingSaulAtGilboa"></a>King Saul At Gilboa</b></h2>
<p>With noise of battle and the dust of fray, <br>
  Half-hid in fog, the gloomy mountain lay; <br>
  But Succoth&rsquo;s watchers from their outer fields, <br>
  Saw fits of flame and gleams of clashing shields <br>
  For, where the yellow river draws its spring, <br>
  The hosts of Israel travelled thundering! <br>
  There, beating like the storm that sweeps to sea <br>
  Across the reefs of chafing Galilee, <br>
  The car of Abner and the sword of Saul <br>
  Drave Gaza down Gilboa&rsquo;s southern wall; <br>
  But swift and sure the spears of Ekron flew, <br>
  Till peak and slope were drenched with bloody dew! <br>
  &ldquo;Shout, Timnath, shout!&rdquo; the blazing leaders cried, <br>
  And hurled the stone and dashed the stave aside: <br>
  &ldquo;Shout, Timnath, shout! Let Hazor hold the height, <br>
  Bend the long bow and break the lords of fight!&rdquo; <br>
  From every hand the swarthy strangers sprang, <br>
  Chief leaped on chief, with buckler buckler rang! <br>
  The flower of armies! Set in Syrian heat, <br>
  The ridges clamoured under labouring feet; <br>
  Nor stayed the warriors till, from Salem&rsquo;s road, <br>
  The crescent horns of Abner&rsquo;s squadrons glowed. <br>
  Then, like a shooting splendour on the wing, <br>
  The strong-armed son of Kish came thundering; <br>
  And as in Autumn&rsquo;s fall, when woods are bare, <br>
  Two adverse tempests meet in middle air, <br>
  So Saul and Achish, grim with heat and hate, <br>
  Met by the brook and shook the scales of Fate. <br>
  For now the struggle swayed, and, firm as rocks <br>
  Against the storm-wind of the equinox, <br>
  The rallied lords of Judah stood and bore <br>
  All day the fiery tides of fourfold war. </p>
<p>But he that fasted in the secret cave, <br>
  And called up Samuel from the quiet grave, <br>
  And stood with darkness and the mantled ghosts <br>
  A bitter night on shrill Samarian coasts, <br>
  Knew well the end &mdash; of how the futile sword <br>
  Of Israel would be broken by the Lord; <br>
  How Gath would triumph, with the tawny line <br>
  That bend the knee at Dagon&rsquo;s brittle shrine; <br>
  And how the race of Kish would fall to wreck, <br>
  Because of vengeance stayed at Amalek; <br>
  Yet strove the sun-like king, nor rested hand <br>
  Till yellow evening filled the level land; <br>
  Then Judah reeled before a biting hail <br>
  Of sudden arrows shot from Akor&rsquo;s vale, <br>
  Where Libnah, lapped in blood from thigh to heel, <br>
  Drew the tense string, and pierced the quivering steel. <br>
  There fell the sons of Saul, and, man by man, <br>
  The chiefs of Israel, up to Jonathan; <br>
  And while swift Achish stooped and caught the spoil, <br>
  Ten chosen archers, red with sanguine toil <br>
  Sped after Saul, who, faint and sick, and sore <br>
  With many wounds, had left the thick of war: <br>
  He, like a baffled bull by hunters prest, <br>
  Turned sharp about, and faced the flooded west, <br>
  And saw the star-like spears and moony spokes <br>
  Gleam from the rocks and lighten through the oaks&mdash; <br>
  A sea of splendour! How the chariots rolled <br>
  On wheels of blinding brightness manifold! <br>
  While stumbling over spike and spine and spur <br>
  Of sultry lands, escaped the son of Ner <br>
  With smitten men. At this the front of Saul <br>
  Grew darker than a blasted tower wall; <br>
  And seeing how there crouched upon his right, <br>
  Aghast with fear, a black Amalekite, <br>
  He called, and said: &ldquo;I pray thee, man of pain, <br>
  Red from the scourge, and recent from the chain, <br>
  Set thou thy face to mine, and stoutly stand <br>
  With yonder bloody sword-hilt in thy hand, <br>
  And fall upon me.&rdquo; But the faltering hind <br>
  Stood trembling, like a willow in the wind. <br>
  Then further Saul: &ldquo;Lest Ashdod&rsquo;s vaunting hosts <br>
  Should bear me captive to their bleak-blown coasts, <br>
  I pray thee, smite me: seeing peace has fled, <br>
  And rest lies wholly with the quiet dead.&rdquo; <br>
  At this a flood of sunset broke, and smote <br>
  Keen, blazing sapphires round a kingly throat, <br>
  Touched arm and shoulder, glittered in the crest, <br>
  And made swift starlights on a jewelled breast! <br>
  So, starting forward, like a loosened hound, <br>
  The stranger clutched the sword and wheeled it round, <br>
  And struck the Lord&rsquo;s Anointed. Fierce and fleet <br>
  Philistia came, with shouts and clattering feet; <br>
  By gaping gorges and by rough defile, <br>
  Dark Ashdod beat across a dusty mile; <br>
  Hot Hazor&rsquo;s bowmen toiled from spire to spire, <br>
  And Gath sprang upwards, like a gust of fire; <br>
  On either side did Libnah&rsquo;s lords appear, <br>
  And brass-clad Timnath thundered in the rear. <br>
  &ldquo;Mark, Achish, mark!&rdquo; &mdash; South-west and south there sped <br>
  A dabbled hireling from the dreadful dead! <br>
  &ldquo;Mark, Achish, mark!&rdquo; &mdash; The mighty front of Saul, <br>
  Great in his life and god-like in his fall! <br>
  This was the arm that broke Philistia&rsquo;s pride, <br>
  Where Kishon chafes his seaward-going tide; <br>
  This was the sword that smote till set of sun <br>
  Red Gath, from Michmash unto Ajalon, <br>
  Low in the dust. And Israel scattered far! <br>
  And dead the trumps and crushed the hoofs of war! </p>
<p>So fell the king, as it was said by him <br>
  Who hid his forehead in a mantle dim <br>
  At bleak Endor, what time unholy rites <br>
  Vexed the long sleep of still Samarian heights: <br>
  For bowed to earth before the hoary Priest, <br>
  Did he of Kish withstand the smoking feast, <br>
  To fast, in darkness and in sackcloth rolled, <br>
  And house with wild things in the biting cold; <br>
  Because of sharpness lent to Gaza&rsquo;s sword, <br>
  And Judah widowed by the angry Lord. </p>
<p>So silence came! As when the outer verge <br>
  Of Carmel takes the white and whistling surge, <br>
  Hoarse hollow noises fill the caves and roar <br>
  Along the margin of the echoing shore, <br>
  Thus War had thundered! But as evening breaks <br>
  Across the silver of Assyrian lakes, <br>
  When reapers rest, and through the level red <br>
  Of sunset, peace like holy oil is shed, <br>
  Thus Silence fell; but Israel&rsquo;s daughters crept <br>
  Outside their thresholds, waited, watched, and wept. </p>
<p>Then they that dwell beyond the flats and fens <br>
  Of sullen Jordan, and in gelid glens <br>
  Of Jabesh-Gilead, chosen chiefs and few, <br>
  Around their loins the hasty girdle drew, <br>
  And faced the forests huddled fold on fold, <br>
  And dells of glimmering greenness manifold, <br>
  What time Orion in the west did set <br>
  A shining foot on hills of wind and wet: <br>
  These journeyed nightly till they reached the capes <br>
  Where Ashdod revelled over heated grapes; <br>
  And, while the feast was loud and scouts were turned, <br>
  From Saul&rsquo;s bound body cord by cord they burned, <br>
  And bore the king athwart the place of tombs, <br>
  And hasted eastward through the tufted glooms; <br>
  Nor broke the cake nor stayed the step till Morn <br>
  Shot over Debir&rsquo;s cones and crags forlorn. </p>
<p>From Jabesh then the weeping virgins came; <br>
  In Jabesh then they built the funeral flame; <br>
  With costly woods they piled the lordly pyre, <br>
  Brought yellow oils and fed the perfect fire; <br>
  While round the crescent stately elders spread <br>
  The flashing armour of the mighty dead, <br>
  With crown and spear, and all the trophies won <br>
  From many wars by Israel&rsquo;s dreadful son. <br>
  Thence, when the feet of Evening paused and stood <br>
  On shadowy mountains and the roaring flood, <br>
  (As through a rushing twilight full of rain, <br>
  The weak moon looked athwart Gadara&rsquo;s plain), <br>
  The younger warriors bore the urn, and broke <br>
  The humid turf about a wintering oak, <br>
  And buried Saul; and, fasting, went their ways, <br>
  And hid their faces seven nights and days. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it sad to be emptied of love?&rdquo; <br>
  And the voice of the flower of the peach <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tender and touching in tone, <br>
  &ldquo;When each has been grafted on each, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sorrow to live on alone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then the leaves of the flower of the vine <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, &ldquo;what will there be in the day <br>
  When the reapers are red with my wine, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the forests are yellow and grey?&rdquo; <br>
  And the tremulous flower of the quince <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made answer, &ldquo;three seasons ago <br>
  My sisters were star-like, but since, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their graves have been made in the snow.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then the whispering flower of the fern <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, &ldquo;who will be sad at the death, <br>
  When Summer blows over the burn, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fierceness of fire in her breath?&rdquo; <br>
  And the mouth of the flower of the sedge <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was opened to murmur and sigh, <br>
  &ldquo;Sweet wind-breaths that pause at the edge <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the nightfall, and falter, and die.&rdquo; </p>

<h3><b>1 - A Mountain  Spring</b></h3>
<p>Peace hath an altar there. The sounding feet <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thunder and the &rsquo;wildering wings of rain <br>
  Against fire-rifted summits flash and beat, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through grey upper gorges swoop and strain; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But round that hallowed mountain-spring remain, <br>
  Year after year, the days of tender heat, <br>
  And gracious nights whose lips with flowers are sweet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filtered lights, and lutes of soft refrain. <br>
  A still bright pool. To men I may not tell <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret that its heart of water knows &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of a loved and lost repose; <br>
  Yet <i>this</i> I say to cliff and  close-leaved dell: <br>
  A fitful spirit haunts yon limpid well, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose likeness is the faithless face of Rose. </p>
<h3><b>2 - Laura </b></h3>
<p>If Laura &mdash; lady of the flower-soft face &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should light upon these verses, she may take <br>
  The tenderest line, and through its pulses trace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What man can suffer for a woman&rsquo;s sake. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For in the nights that burn, the days that break, <br>
  A thin pale figure stands in Passion&rsquo;s place, <br>
  And peace comes not, nor yet the perished grace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of youth, to keep old faiths and fires awake. <br>
  Ah! marvellous maid. Life sobs, and sighing saith, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She left me, fleeting like a fluttered dove; <br>
  But I would have a moment of her breath, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I might taste the sweetest sense thereof, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch from blossoming, honeyed lips of love <br>
  Some faint, some fair, some dim delicious death.&rdquo; </p>
<h3><b>3 - By A River </b></h3>
<p>By red ripe mouth and brown luxurious eyes <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her I love, by all your sweetness shed <br>
  In far fair days, on one whose memory flies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To faithless lights, and gracious speech gainsaid, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray you, when yon river-path I tread, <br>
  Make with the woodlands some soft compromise <br>
  Lest they should vex me into fruitless sighs <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With visions of a woman&rsquo;s gleaming head! <br>
  For every green and golden-hearted thing <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gathers beauty in that shining place, <br>
  Beloved of beams and wooed by wind and wing, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is rife with glimpses of her marvellous face; <br>
  And in the whispers of the lips of Spring <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of her lute-like voice I trace. </p>
<h3><b>4 - Attila</b></h3>
<p>What though his feet were shod with sharp fierce flame, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Death and Ruin were his daily squires, <br>
  The Scythian helped by Heaven&rsquo;s thunders came: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time was ripe for God&rsquo;s avenging fires. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, loose lewd trulls and lean luxurious liars <br>
  Had brought the fair fine face of Rome to shame <br>
  And made her one with sins beyond a name &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That queenly daughter of imperial sires! <br>
  The blood of elders like the blood of sheep <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was dashed across the circus! Once while din <br>
  And dust and lightnings, and a draggled heap <br>
  Of beast-slain men made lords with laughter leap, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night fell, with rain. The Earth so sick of sin <br>
  Had turned her face into the dark to weep. </p>
<h3><b>5 - A Reward</b></h3>
<p>Because a steadfast flame of clear intent <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave force and beauty to full-actioned life; <br>
  Because his way was one of firm ascent, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose stepping-stones were hewn of change and strife; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because as husband loveth noble wife <br>
  He loved fair Truth; because the thing he meant <br>
  To do, that thing he did, nor paused, nor bent, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In face of poor and pale conclusions; yea, <br>
  Because of this, how fares the Leader dead? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of mourners weep for him to-day? <br>
  What golden shroud is at his funeral spread? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his brow what leaves of laurel, say? <br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About his breast  is tied a sackcloth grey, <br>
    And knots of thorns deface his lordly head. </i></p>
<h3><b>6 - To &mdash;&mdash;</b></h3>
<p>A handmaid to the Genius of thy song <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sweet fair Scholarship. &rsquo;Tis she supplies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery Spirit of the passioned eyes <br>
  With subtle syllables whose notes belong <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some chief source of perfect melodies. <br>
  And glancing through a laurelled lordly throng <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shining singers, lo, my vision flies <br>
  To William Shakespeare! he it is whose strong <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full flute-like music haunts thy stately Verse. <br>
  A worthy Levite of his court thou art! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sent among us to defeat the curse <br>
  That binds us to the Actual. Yea, thy part, <br>
  Oh, lute-voiced lover! is to lull the heart <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love repelled: its darkness to disperse. </p>
<h3><b>7 - The Stanza Of  Childe Harold</b></h3>
<p>Who framed the stanza of Childe Harold? He <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was who, halting on a stormy shore, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew well the lofty Voice which evermore, <br>
  In grand distress, doth haunt the sleepless sea <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With solemn sounds! And as each wave did roll <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till one came up, the mightiest of the whole, <br>
  To sweep and surge across the vacant lea, <br>
  Wild words were wedded to wild melody. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poet must have had a speechless sense <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some dead summer&rsquo;s boundless affluence! <br>
  Else, whither can we trace the passioned lore <br>
  Of Beauty, steeping to the very core <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His royal verse? And that rare light which lies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About it like a Sunset in the skies? </p>
<h3><b>8 - A Living Poet</b></h3>
<p>He knows the sweet vexation in the strife <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Love with Time, this bard who fain would stray <br>
  To fairer place beyond the storms of Life, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With astral faces near him day by day. <br>
  In deep-mossed dells the mellow waters flow <br>
  Which best he loves; for there the echoes, rife <br>
  With rich suggestions of his Long Ago, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astarte! pass with thee. And, far away, <br>
  Dear Southern Seasons haunt the dreamy eye: <br>
  Spring, flower-zoned, and Summer, warbling low <br>
  In tasselled corn, alternate come and go; <br>
  While gypsy Autumn, splashed from heel to thigh <br>
  With vine-blood, treads the leaves; and, halting nigh, <br>
  Wild Winter bends across a beard of snow. </p>
<h3><b>9 - Dante And Virgil</b></h3>
<p>When lost Francesca sobbed her broken tale <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Love, and Sin, and boundless Agony; <br>
  While that wan spirit by her side did wail <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bite his lips for utter misery &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grief which could not speak, nor hear, nor see; <br>
  So tender grew the superhuman face <br>
  Of one who listened, that a mighty trace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of superhuman woe gave way, and pale, <br>
  The sudden light upstruggled to its place; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all his limbs began to faint and fail <br>
  With such excess of Pity. But, behind, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roman Virgil stood &mdash; the calm, the wise &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With not a shadow in his regal eyes, <br>
  A stately type of all his stately kind! </p>
<h3><b>10 - Rest</b></h3>
<p>Sometimes we feel so spent for want of rest, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no thought beyond. I know to-day, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When tired of bitter lips and dull delay <br>
  With faithless words, I cast mine eyes upon <br>
  The shadows of a distant mountain-crest, <br>
  And said, &ldquo;That hill must hide within its breast <br>
  Some secret glen secluded from the sun. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, mother Nature! would that I could run <br>
  Outside to thee, and, like a wearied guest <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half blind with lamps, and sick of feasting, lay <br>
  An aching head on thee. Then down the streams <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon might swim; and I should feel her grace, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While soft winds blew the sorrows from my face <br>
  So quiet in the fellowship of dreams.&rdquo; </p>
<h3><b>11 - After Parting</b></h3>
<p>I cannot tell what change hath come to you <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To vex your splendid hair. I only know <br>
  <i>One</i> grief: The Passion left betwixt  us two, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some forsaken watchfire, burneth low. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis sad to turn and find it dying so <br>
  Without a hope of resurrection! Yet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O radiant face that found me tired and lone, <br>
  I shall not for the dear dead past forget <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetest looks of all the Summers gone. <br>
  Ah! time hath made familiar wild Regret; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now the leaves are white in last year&rsquo;s bowers; <br>
  And now doth sob along the ruined leas <br>
  The homeless storm from saddened southern seas, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While March sits weeping over withered flowers. </p>
<h3><b>12 - Alfred Tennyson</b></h3>
<p>The silvery dimness of a happy dream <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve known of late. Methought where Byron moans, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some wild gulf in melancholy zones, <br>
  I passed tear-blinded! Once a lurid gleam <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of stormy sunset loitered on the sea <br>
  While, travelling troubled, like a straitened stream, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Shelley died away from me. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still sore at heart I reached a lake-lit lea. <br>
  And then the green-mossed glades with many a grove <br>
  Where lies the calm which Wordsworth used to love; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lastly, Locksley Hall! from whence did rise <br>
  A haunting Song that blew, and breathed, and blew, <br>
  With rare delights: &rsquo;twas <i>there</i> I  woke and knew <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sumptuous comfort left in drowsy eyes. </p>

<p>All night long the sea out yonder &mdash; all night long the  wailful sea, <br>
  Vext of winds and many thunders, seeketh rest unceasingly! <br>
  Seeketh rest in dens of tempest where, like one distraught with pain, <br>
  Shouts the wild-eyed sprite, Confusion: seeketh rest, and moans in vain! <br>
  Ah! but you should hear it calling, calling when the haggard sky <br>
  Takes the darks and damps of Winter with the mournful marsh-fowl&rsquo;s cry; <br>
  Even while the strong, swift torrents from the rainy ridges come <br>
  Leaping down and breaking backwards &mdash; million-coloured shapes of foam! <br>
  Then, and then, the sea out yonder chiefly looketh for the boon <br>
  Portioned to the pleasant valleys and the grave sweet summer moon: <br>
  Boon of Peace, the still, the saintly spirit of the dew-dells deep &mdash; <br>
  Yellow dells, and hollows haunted by the soft dim dreams of sleep. </p>
<p>All night long the flying water breaks upon the stubborn  rocks &mdash; <br>
  Ooze-filled forelands burnt and blackened, smit and scarred with lightning  shocks; <br>
  But above the tender sea-thrift, but beyond the flowering fern, <br>
  Runs a little pathway westward &mdash; pathway quaint with turn on turn &mdash; <br>
  Westward trending, thus it leads to shelving shores and slopes of mist: <br>
  Sleeping shores, and glassy bays of green and gold and amethyst! <br>
  <i>There</i> tread gently &mdash; <i>gently</i>, pilgrim; <i>there</i> with thoughtful eyes look round; <br>
  Cross thy breast and bless the silence: lo, the place is holy ground! <br>
  Holy ground for ever, stranger! All the quiet silver lights <br>
  Dropping from the starry heavens through the soft Australian nights &mdash; <br>
  Dropping on those lone grave-grasses &mdash; come serene, unbroken, clear, <br>
  Like the love of God the Father, falling, falling, year by year! <br>
  Yea, and like a Voice supernal, <i>there</i> the daily wind doth blow <br>
  In the leaves above the Sailor buried ninety years ago. </p>

<p>The flying Syrinx turned and sped <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By dim mysterious hollows, <br>
  Where night is black, and day is red, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And frost the fire-wind follows. </p>
<p>Strong heavy footfalls in the wake <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came up with flights of water: <br>
  The gods were mournful for the sake <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Ladon&rsquo;s lovely daughter. </p>
<p>For when she came to spike and spine, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where reef and river gather, <br>
  Her feet were sore with shell and chine; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not travel farther. </p>
<p>Across a naked strait of land, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown sleet and surge were humming; <br>
  But trammelled with the shifting sand, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard the monster coming! </p>
<p>A thing of hoofs and horns and lust! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gaunt goat-footed stranger! <br>
  She bowed her body in the dust, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And called on Zeus to change her. </p>
<p>And called on Hermes fair and fleet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her of hounds and quiver, <br>
  To hide her in the thickets sweet <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sighed above the river. </p>
<p>So he that sits on flaming wheels, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rules the sea and thunder, <br>
  Caught up the satyr by the heels, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tore his skirts asunder. </p>
<p>While Arcas of the glittering plumes <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took Ladon&rsquo;s daughter lightly, <br>
  And set her in the gracious glooms <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mix with moon-mist nightly. </p>
<p>And touched her lips with wild-flower wine; <br>

<p align="center" class="note"><i>The name of the watercourse, often dry, which in flood-time reaches  the
river Darling.</i></p>
<p>As when the strong stream of a wintering sea <br>
  Rolls round our coast, with bodeful breaks of storm, <br>
  And swift salt rain, and bitter wind that saith <br>
  Wild things and woeful of the White South Land <br>
  Alone with God and Silence in the cold &mdash; <br>
  As when this cometh, men from dripping doors <br>
  Look forth, and shudder for the mariners <br>
  Abroad, so we for absent brothers looked <br>
  In days of drought, and when the flying floods <br>
  Swept boundless: roaring down the bald, black plains <br>
  Beyond the farthest spur of western hills. </p>
<p>For where the Barwon cuts a rotten land, <br>
  Or lies unshaken, like a great blind creek, <br>
  Between hot mouldering banks, it came to this, <br>
  All in a time of short and thirsty sighs, <br>
  That thirty rainless months had left the pools <br>
  And grass as dry as ashes: then it was <br>
  Our kinsmen started for the lone Paroo, <br>
  From point to point, with patient strivings, sheer <br>
  Across the horrors of the windless downs, <br>
  Blue-gleaming like a sea of molten steel. </p>
<p>But never drought had broke them: never flood <br>
  Had quenched them: they with mighty youth and health, <br>
  And thews and sinews knotted like the trees &mdash; <br>
  <i>They</i>, like the children of the native  woods, <br>
  Could stem the strenuous waters, or outlive <br>
  The crimson days and dull dead nights of thirst <br>
  Like camels! yet of what avail was strength <br>
  Alone to them &mdash; though it was like the rocks <br>
  On stormy mountains &mdash; in the bloody time <br>
  When fierce sleep caught them in the camps at rest, <br>
  And violent darkness gripped the life in them <br>
  And whelmed them, as an eagle unawares <br>
  Is whelmed and slaughtered in a sudden snare. </p>
<p>All murdered by the blacks! smit while they lay <br>
  In silver dreams, and with the far faint fall <br>
  Of many waters breaking on their sleep! <br>
  Yea, in the tracts unknown of any man <br>
  Save savages &mdash; the dim-discovered ways <br>
  Of footless silence or unhappy winds &mdash; <br>
  The wild men came upon them, like a fire <br>
  Of desert thunder; and the fine firm lips <br>
  That touched a mother&rsquo;s lips a year before, <br>
  And hands that knew a dearer hand than life, <br>
  Were hewn like sacrifice before the stars, <br>
  And left with hooting owls, and blowing clouds, <br>
  And falling leaves, and solitary wings! </p>
<p>Aye, you may see their graves &mdash; you who have toiled, <br>
  And tripped and thirsted, like these men of ours; <br>
  For verily I say that <i>not</i> so deep <br>
  Their bones are that the scattered drift and dust <br>
  Of gusty days will never leave them bare. <br>
  O dear, dead, bleaching bones! I know of those <br>
  Who have the wild strong will to go and sit <br>
  Outside all things with you, and keep the ways <br>
  Aloof from bats, and snakes, and trampling feet <br>
  That smite your peace and theirs &mdash; who have the heart <br>
  Without the lusty limbs to face the fire, <br>
  And moonless midnights, and to be indeed, <br>
  For very sorrow, like a moaning wind <br>
  In wintry forests with perpetual rain. </p>
<p>Because of this &mdash; because of sisters left <br>
  With desperate purpose and dishevelled hair, <br>
  And broken breath, and sweetness quenched in tears &mdash; <br>
  Because of swifter silver for the head, <br>
  And furrows for the face &mdash; because of these <br>
  That should have come with Age, that come with Pain, <br>
  O Master! Father! sitting where our eyes <br>
  Are tired of looking, say for once are we &mdash; <br>

  For breaking of the loins, for melting eyes, <br>
  And knees as weak as water? &mdash; any peace, <br>
  Or hope for casual breath, and labouring lips, <br>
  For clapping of the palms, and sharper sighs <br>
  Than frost; or any light to come for those <br>
  Who stand and mumble in the alien streets <br>
  With heads as grey as Winter? &mdash; any balm <br>

  Unknown of dreams, these darling friends of ours. <br>
  And we who taste the core of many tales <br>
  Of tribulation &mdash; we whose lives are salt <br>
  With tears indeed &mdash; <i>we</i> therefore hide  our eyes <br>

  Why shape specific sorrows, though the real <br>

<p>A little patch of dark-green moss, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose softness grew of quiet ways, <br>
  (With all its deep, delicious floss,) <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In slumb&rsquo;rous suns of summer days. </p>
<p>You know the place? With pleasant tints <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken sunset lights the bowers; <br>
  And then the woods are full with hints <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of distant, dear, voluptuous flowers! </p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis often now the pilgrim turns <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faded face towards that seat, <br>
  And cools his brow amongst the ferns: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The runnel dabbling at his feet. </p>
<p>There fierce December seldom goes, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scorching step and dust and drouth; <br>
  But, soft and low, October blows <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet odours from her dewy mouth. </p>
<p>And Autumn, like a gipsy bold, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth gather near it grapes and grain, <br>
  Ere Winter comes, the woodman old, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lop the leaves in wind and rain. </p>
<p>O, greenest moss of mountain glen, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Rose is known to thee; <br>
  But we shall never share with men <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knowledge dear to Love and me! </p>
<p>For are they not between us saved, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words my darling used to say; <br>
  What time the western waters laved <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forehead of the fainting Day? </p>
<p>Cool comfort had we on your breast <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet the fervid noon burned mute <br>
  O&rsquo;er barley field and barren crest, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leagues of gardens flushed with fruit. </p>
<p>Oh! sweet and low, we whispered so; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sucked the pulp of plum and peach: <br>
  But it was many years ago, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When each, you know, was loved of each. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGlenOfArrawatta"></a>The Glen Of Arrawatta</b></h2>
<p>A sky of wind! And while these fitful gusts <br>
  Are beating round the windows in the cold, <br>
  With sullen sobs of rain, behold I shape <br>
  A settler&rsquo;s story of the wild old times: <br>
  One told by camp-fires when the station-drays <br>
  Were housed and hidden, forty years ago; <br>
  While swarthy drivers smoked their pipes, and drew, <br>
  And crowded round the friendly-gleaming flame <br>
  That lured the dingo howling from his caves <br>
  And brought sharp sudden feet about the brakes. </p>
<p>A tale of Love and Death. And shall I say <br>
  A tale of Love <i>in</i> Death &mdash; for all the  patient eyes <br>
  That gathered darkness, watching for a son <br>
  And brother, never dreaming of the fate &mdash; <br>
  The fearful fate he met alone, unknown, <br>
  Within the ruthless Australasian wastes? <br>
  For in a far-off sultry Summer rimmed <br>
  With thundercloud and red with forest-fires, <br>
  All day, by ways uncouth and ledges rude, <br>
  The wild men held upon a stranger&rsquo;s trail <br>
  Which ran against the rivers and athwart <br>
  The gorges of the deep blue western hills. </p>
<p>And when a cloudy sunset, like the flame <br>
  In windy evenings on the Plains of Thirst <br>
  Beyond the dead banks of the far Barcoo, <br>
  Lay heavy down the topmost peaks, they came <br>
  With pent-in breath and stealthy steps, and crouched, <br>
  Like snakes, amongst the grasses, till the Night <br>
  Had covered face from face and thrown the gloom <br>
  Of many shadows on the front of things. </p>
<p>There, in the shelter of a nameless glen <br>
  Fenced round by cedars and the tangled growths <br>
  Of blackwood, stained with brown and shot with grey, <br>
  The jaded white man built his fire, and turned <br>
  His horse adrift amongst the water-pools <br>
  That trickled underneath the yellow leaves <br>
  And made a pleasant murmur, like the brooks <br>
  Of England through the sweet autumnal noons. </p>
<p>Then, after he had slaked his thirst, and used <br>
  The forest-fare, for which a healthful day <br>
  Of mountain life had brought a zest, he took <br>
  His axe, and shaped with boughs and wattle-forks <br>
  A wurley, fashioned like a bushman&rsquo;s roof: <br>
  The door brought out athwart the strenuous flame: <br>
  The back thatched in against a rising wind. </p>
<p>And, while the sturdy hatchet filled the clifts <br>
  With sounds unknown, the immemorial haunts <br>
  Of echoes sent their lonely dwellers forth <br>
  Who lived a life of wonder: flying round <br>
  And round the glen &mdash; what time the kangaroo <br>
  Leapt from his lair and huddled with the bats &mdash; <br>
  Far-scattering down the wildly startled fells. <br>
  Then came the doleful owl; and evermore <br>
  The bleak morass gave out the bittern&rsquo;s call; <br>
  The plover&rsquo;s cry; and many a fitful wail <br>
  Of chilly omen, falling on the ear <br>
  Like those cold flaws of wind that come and go <br>
  An hour before the break of day. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon <br>
  The stranger held from toil, and, settling down, <br>
  He drew rough solace from his well-filled pipe <br>
  And smoked into the night: revolving there <br>
  The primal questions of a squatter&rsquo;s life; <br>
  For in the flats, a short day&rsquo;s journey past <br>
  His present camp, his station yards were kept <br>
  With many a lodge and paddock jutting forth <br>
  Across the heart of unnamed prairie-lands, <br>
  Now loud with bleating and the cattle bells <br>
  And misty with the hut-fire&rsquo;s daily smoke. </p>
<p>Wide spreading flats, and western spurs of hills <br>
  That dipped to plains of dim perpetual blue; <br>
  Bold summits set against the thunder-heaps; <br>
  And slopes behacked and crushed by battling kine! <br>
  Where now the furious tumult of their feet <br>
  Gives back the dust and up from glen and brake <br>
  Evokes fierce clamour, and becomes indeed <br>
  A token of the squatter&rsquo;s daring life, <br>
  Which growing inland &mdash; growing year by year, <br>
  Doth set us thinking in these latter days, <br>
  And makes one ponder of the lonely lands <br>
  Beyond the lonely tracks of Burke and Wills, <br>
  Where, when the wandering Stuart fixed his camps <br>
  In central wastes, afar from any home <br>
  Or haunt of man, and in the changeless midst <br>
  Of sullen deserts and the footless miles <br>
  Of sultry silence, all the ways about <br>
  Grew strangely vocal and a marvellous noise <br>
  Became the wonder of the waxing glooms. </p>
<p>Now, after darkness, like a mighty spell <br>
  Amongst the hills and dim dispeopled dells, <br>
  Had brought a stillness to the soul of things, <br>
  It came to pass that, from the secret depths <br>
  Of dripping gorges, many a runnel-voice <br>
  Came, mellowed with the silence, and remained <br>
  About the caves, a sweet though alien sound: <br>
  Now rising ever, like a fervent flute <br>
  In moony evenings, when the theme is love: <br>
  Now falling, as ye hear the Sunday bells <br>
  While hastening fieldward from the gleaming town. </p>
<p>Then fell a softer mood, and Memory paused <br>
  With faithful Love, amidst the sainted shrines <br>
  Of Youth and Passion in the valleys past <br>
  Of dear delights which never grow again. <br>
  And if the stranger (who had left behind <br>
  Far anxious homesteads in a wave-swept isle <br>
  To face a fierce sea-circle day by day, <br>
  And hear at night the dark Atlantic&rsquo;s moan) <br>
  <i>Now</i> took a hope and planned a swift  return, <br>
  With wealth and health and with a youth unspent, <br>
  To those sweet ones that stayed with Want at home, <br>
  Say <i>who</i> shall blame him &mdash; though the  years are long, <br>
  And Life is hard, and waiting makes the heart grow old? </p>
<p>Thus passed the time, until the moon serene <br>
  Stood over high dominion like a dream <br>
  Of Peace: within the white-transfigured woods; <br>
  And o&rsquo;er the vast dew-dripping wilderness <br>
  Of slopes illumined with her silent fires. <br>
  Then far beyond the home of pale red leaves <br>
  And silver sluices, and the shining stems <br>
  Of runnel-blooms, the dreamy wanderer saw, <br>
  The wilder for the vision of the Moon, <br>
  Stark desolations and a waste of plain <br>
  All smit by flame and broken with the storms: <br>
  Black ghosts of trees, and sapless trunks that stood <br>
  Harsh hollow channels of the fiery noise <br>
  Which ran from bole to bole a year before, <br>
  And grew with ruin, and was like, indeed, <br>
  The roar of mighty winds with wintering streams <br>
  That foam about the limits of the land, <br>
  And mix their swiftness with the flying seas. </p>
<p>Now, when the man had turned his face about <br>
  To take his rest, behold the gem-like eyes <br>
  Of ambushed wild things stared from bole and brake <br>
  With dumb amaze and faint-recurring glance, <br>
  And fear anon that drove them down the brush; <br>
  While from his den the dingo, like a scout <br>
  In sheltered ways, crept out and cowered near <br>
  To sniff the tokens of the stranger&rsquo;s feast <br>
  And marvel at the shadows of the flame. </p>
<p>Thereafter grew the wind; and chafing depths <br>
  In distant waters sent a troubled cry <br>
  Across the slumb&rsquo;rous Forest; and the chill <br>
  Of coming rain was on the sleeper&rsquo;s brow, <br>
  When, flat as reptiles hutted in the scrub, <br>
  A deadly crescent crawled to where he lay &mdash; <br>
  A band of fierce fantastic savages <br>
  That, starting naked round the faded fire, <br>
  With sudden spears and swift terrific yells, <br>
  Came bounding wildly at the white man&rsquo;s head, <br>
  And faced him, staring like a dream of Hell! </p>
<p>Here let me pass! I would not stay to tell <br>
  Of hopeless struggles under crushing blows; <br>
  Of how the surging fiends with thickening strokes <br>
  Howled round the stranger till they drained his strength; <br>
  How Love and Life stood face to face with Hate <br>
  And Death; and then how Death was left alone <br>
  With Night and Silence in the sobbing rains. </p>
<p>So, after many moons, the searchers found <br>
  The body mouldering in the mouldering dell <br>
  Amidst the fungi and the bleaching leaves, <br>
  And buried it; and raised a stony mound <br>
  Which took the mosses: Then the place became <br>
  The haunt of fearful legends and the lair <br>
  Of bats and adders. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  he lies and sleeps <br>
  From year to year: in soft Australian nights; <br>
  And through the furnaced noons; and in the times <br>
  Of wind and wet! yet never mourner comes <br>
  To drop upon that grave the Christian&rsquo;s tear <br>
  Or pluck the foul dank weeds of death away. </p>
<p>But while the English Autumn filled her lap <br>
  With faded gold, and while the reapers cooled <br>
  Their flame-red faces in the clover grass, <br>
  They looked for him at home; and when the frost <br>
  Had made a silence in the mourning lanes <br>
  And cooped the farmers by December fires, <br>
  They looked for him at home: and through the days <br>
  Which brought about the million-coloured Spring, <br>
  With moon-like splendours in the garden plots, <br>
  They looked for him at home: while Summer danced, <br>
  A shining singer, through the tasselled corn, <br>
  They looked for him at home. From sun to sun <br>
  They waited. Season after season went, <br>
  And Memory wept upon the lonely moors, <br>
  And Hope grew voiceless, and the watchers passed, <br>
  Like shadows, one by one away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  he <br>
  Whose fate was hidden under forest leaves, <br>
  And in the darkness of untrodden dells <br>
  Became a marvel. Often by the hearths <br>
  In winter nights, and when the wind was wild <br>
  Outside the casements, children heard the tale <br>
  Of how he left their native vales behind <br>
  (Where he had been a child himself) to shape <br>
  New fortunes for his father&rsquo;s fallen house; <br>
  Of how he struggled &mdash; how his name became, <br>
  By fine devotion and unselfish zeal, <br>
  A name of beauty in a selfish land; <br>
  And then of how the aching hours went by, <br>
  With patient listeners praying for the step <br>
  Which never crossed the floor again. So passed <br>
  The tale to children; but the bitter end <br>
  Remained a wonder, like the unknown grave, <br>
  Alone with God and Silence in the hills. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Euterpe"></a>Euterpe</b></h2>
<p>Child of Light, the bright, the bird-like! wilt thou float  and float to me, <br>
  Facing winds and sleets and waters, flying glimpses of the sea? <br>
  Down amongst the hills of tempest where the elves of tumult roam &mdash; <br>
  Blown wet shadows of the summits, dim sonorous sprites of foam? <br>
  Here and here my days are wasted, shorn of leaf, and stript of fruit: <br>
  Vexed because of speech half-spoken, maiden with the marvellous lute! <br>
  Vexed because of songs half-shapen, smit with fire and mixed with pain: <br>
  Part of thee, and part of Sorrow, like a sunset pale with rain. <br>
  Child of Light, the bright, the bird-like! wilt thou float and float to me <br>
  Facing winds, and sleets, and waters, flying glimpses of the sea? </p>
<p>All night long, in fluent pauses, falling far, but full,  but fine, <br>
  Faultless friend of flowers and fountains, do I hear that voice of thine &mdash; <br>
  All night long, amidst the burden of the lordly storm, that sings <br>
  High above the tumbled forelands, fleet and fierce with thunderings! <br>
  Then and then, my love, Euterpe, lips of life replete with dreams <br>
  Murmur for thy sweet sharp fragments dying down Lethean streams: <br>
  Murmur for thy mouth&rsquo;s marred music, splendid hints that burn and break, <br>
  Heavy with excess of beauty: murmur for thy music&rsquo;s sake. <br>
  All night long in fluent pauses, falling far, but full, but fine, <br>
  Faultless friend of flowers and fountains, do I hear that voice of thine. </p>
<p>In the yellow flame of evening, sound of thee doth come  and go <br>
  Through the noises of the river and the drifting of the snow: <br>
  In the yellow flame of evening &mdash; at the setting of the day &mdash; <br>
  Sound that lightens, falls, and lightens, flickers, faints, and fades away. <br>
  I am famished of thy silence &mdash; broken for the tender note <br>
  Caught with its surpassing passion &mdash; caught and strangled in thy throat! <br>
  We have nought to help thy trouble &mdash; nought for that which lieth mute <br>
  On the harpstring and the lutestring and the spirit of the lute. <br>
  In the yellow flame of evening sound of thee doth come and go <br>
  Through the noises of the river and the drifting of the snow. </p>
<p>Daughter of the dead red summers! men that laugh and men  that weep, <br>
  Call thee Music &mdash; shall I follow, choose their name, and turn and sleep? <br>
  What thou art, behold, I know not; but thy honey slakes and slays <br>
  Half the want which whitens manhood in the stress of alien days! <br>
  Even as a wondrous woman struck with love and great desire, <br>
  Hast thou been to me, Euterpe! half of tears and half of fire. <br>
  But thy joy is swift and fitful; and a subtle sense of pain <br>
  Sighs through thy melodious breathing, takes the rapture from thy strain. <br>
  Daughter of the dead red summers! Men that laugh and men that weep, <br>
  Call thee Music &mdash; shall I follow, choose their name, and turn and sleep? </p>

<p>A quiet song for Ellen &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient Ellen Ray, <br>
  A dreamer in the nightfall, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A watcher in the day. <br>
  The wedded of the sailor <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who keeps so far away: <br>
  A shadow on his forehead <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For patient Ellen Ray. </p>
<p>When autumn winds were driving <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the chafing bay, <br>
  He said the words of anger <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wasted Ellen Ray: <br>
  He said the words of anger <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went his bitter way: <br>
  Her dower was the darkness &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient Ellen Ray. </p>
<p>Your comfort is a phantom, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My patient Ellen Ray; <br>
  You house it in the night-time <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fronts you in the day; <br>
  And when the moon is very low <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the lights are grey, <br>

<p>At dusk, like flowers that shun the day, <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your sweet sake. </p>
<p>My early love! my first, my last! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistakes have been that both must rue, <br>
  But all the passion of the past <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survives for you. </p>
<p>The tender message Hope might send <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinks fainting at the lips of speech, <br>
  For, are you lover &mdash; are you friend, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I would reach? </p>
<p>How much to-night I&rsquo;d give to win <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A banished peace &mdash; an old repose! <br>
  But here I sit, and sigh, and sin <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When no one knows. </p>
<p>The stern, the steadfast reticence, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made the dearest phrases halt, <br>
  And checked a first and finest sense, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not my fault. </p>
<p>I held my words because there grew <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About my life persistent pride; <br>
  And you were loved, who never knew <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What love could hide! </p>
<p>This purpose filled my soul like flame <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win you wealth and take the place <br>
  Where care is not, nor any shame <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To vex your face. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its secrets safe and unconfest;&rdquo; <br>
  And days and nights unknown to sleep <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vow attest. </p>
<p>Yet, O my Sweet, it seems so long <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you were near, and fates retard <br>
  The sequel of a struggle strong, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Life is hard! </p>
<p>Too hard, when one is left alone <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrestle Passion, never free <br>

<p>Strong pinions bore Safi, the Dreamer, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dazzle and whirl of a race; <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sea thundered under his face! </p>
<p>And the Earth, raying up in confusion <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed flying and flying afar, <br>
  Till it dropped like a moon into silence, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waned from a moon to a star. </p>
<p>Was it light, was it shadow he followed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he swept through those desperate tracts <br>
  With his hair beating back on his shoulders <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the tops of the wind-hackled flax? </p>
<p>&ldquo;I come,&rdquo; murmured Safi, the Dreamer, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I come, but thou fliest before! <br>
  But thy way hath the breath of the honey, <br>

<p>His eyes were the eyes of a watcher <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held on by luxurious faith, <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazed with the beauty of Death. </p>

<p>And, fronting the furthermost spaces, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept through the distances dim, <br>
  Till the days, and the years, and the cycles <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were lost and forgotten by him. </p>

<p>When he came to the silver star-portals, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of that wonderful place <br>
  Looked forth from her towers resplendent, <br>

<p>And one said, &ldquo;This is Safi the Only, <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A million of ages ago. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He erred, if he suffers, to clutch at <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High lights from the wood and the street; <br>
  Not caring to see how his brothers <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He hunteth a perilous wraith, <br>
  Arrayed with voluptuous fancies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ringed with tyrannical faith. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Wound up in the heart of his error <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must sweep through the silences dire, <br>
  Like one in the dark of a desert <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allured by fallacious fire.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * * * * * </p>
<p>And she faltered, and asked, like a doubter, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When he hangs on those Spaces sublime <br>
  With the Terror that knoweth no limit, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And holdeth no record of Time,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten of God and the demons &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he keep to his fancy amain? <br>
  Can he live for that horrible Chaos <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flame and perpetual rain?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * * * * * </p>
<p>But an answer as soft as a prayer <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell down from a high hidden Land, <br>
  And the words were the words of a language <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which none but the gods understand. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="DanielHenryDeniehy"></a>In Memoriam <br>
Daniel Henry Deniehy</b></h2>
<p>Take the harp, but very softly for our brother touch the  strings: <br>
  Wind and wood shall help to wail him, waves and mournful mountain-springs. <br>
  Take the harp, but very softly, for the friend who grew so old <br>
  Through the hours we would not hear of &mdash; nights we would not fain behold! <br>
  Other voices, sweeter voices, shall lament him year by year, <br>
  Though the morning finds us lonely, though we sit and marvel here: <br>
  Marvel much while Summer cometh, trammelled with November wheat, <br>
  Gold about her forehead gleaming, green and gold about her feet; <br>
  Yea, and while the land is dark with plover, gull, and gloomy glede, <br>
  Where the cold, swift songs of Winter fill the interlucent reed. </p>
<p>Yet, my harp, and O, my fathers, never look for Sorrow&rsquo;s  lay, <br>
  Making life a mighty darkness in the patient noon of day; <br>
  Since he resteth whom we loved so, out beyond these fleeting seas, <br>
  Blowing clouds, and restless regions paved with old perplexities, <br>
  In a land where thunder breaks not, in a place unknown of snow, <br>
  Where the rain is mute for ever, where the wild winds never go: <br>
  Home of far-forgotten phantoms &mdash; genii of our peaceful prime, <br>
  Shining by perpetual waters past the ways of Change and Time: <br>
  Haven of the harried spirit, where it folds its wearied wings, <br>
  Turns its face and sleeps a sleep with deep forgetfulness of things. </p>
<p>His should be a grave by mountains, in a cool and  thick-mossed lea, <br>
  With the lone creek falling past it &mdash; falling ever to the sea. <br>
  <i>His</i> should be a grave by waters, by a  bright and broad lagoon, <br>
  Making steadfast splendours hallowed of the quiet-shining moon. <br>
  There the elves of many forests &mdash; wandering winds and flying lights &mdash; <br>
  Born of green, of happy mornings, dear to yellow summer nights, <br>
  Full of dole for him that loved them, then might halt, and then might go, <br>
  Finding fathers of the people to their children speaking low &mdash; <br>
  Speaking low of one who, failing, suffered all the poet&rsquo;s pain, <br>
  Dying with the dead leaves round him &mdash; hopes which never grow again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Merope"></a>Merope</b></h2>
<p>Far in the ways of the hyaline wastes &mdash; in the face of the  splendid <br>
  Six of the sisters &mdash; the star-dowered sisters ineffably bright, <br>
  Merope sitteth, the shadow-like wife of a monarch unfriended <br>
  Of Ades &mdash; of Orcus, the fierce, the implacable god of the night. <br>
  Merope &mdash; fugitive Merope! lost to thyself and thy lover, <br>
  Cast, like a dream, out of thought, with the moons which have passed into  sleep, <br>
  What shall avail thee? Alcyone&rsquo;s tears, or the sight to discover <br>
  Of Sisyphus pallid for thee by the blue, bitter lights of the deep? <br>
  Pallid, but patient for sorrow? Oh, thou of the fire and the water, <br>
  Half with the flame of the sunset and kin to the streams of the sea, <br>
  Hast thou the songs of old times for desire of thy dark-featured daughter, <br>
  Sweet with the lips of thy yearning, O &AElig;thra! with tokens of thee &mdash; <br>
  Songs that would lull her, like kisses forgotten of silence where speech was <br>
  Less than the silence that bound it as passion is bound by a ban; <br>
  Seeing we know of thee, Mother, we turning and hearing how each was <br>
  Wrapt in the other ere Merope faltered and fell for a man? <br>
  Mortal she clave to, forgetting her birthright, forgetting the lordlike <br>
  Sons of the Many-winged Father, and chiefs of the plume and the star, <br>
  Therefore, because that her sin was the grief of the grand and the godlike, <br>
  Sitteth thy child than a morning-moon bleaker, the faded, and far. <br>
  Ringed with the flowerlike Six of the Seven, arrayed and anointed <br>
  Ever with beautiful pity, she watches, she weeps, and she wanes, <br>
  Blind as a flame on the hills of the Winter in hours appointed <br>
  For the life of the foam and the thunder &mdash; the strength of the imminent rains. <br>
  Who hath a portion, Alcyone, like her? Asterope, fairer <br>
  Than sunset on snow, and beloved of all brightness, say what is there left <br>
  Sadder and paler than Pleione&rsquo;s daughter, disconsolate bearer <br>
  Of trouble that smites like a sword of the gods to the break of the heft? <br>
  Demeter, and Dryope, known to the forests, the falls, and the fountains, <br>
  Yearly, because of their walking, and wailing, and wringing of hands, <br>
  <i>Are</i> they as one with this woman? &mdash; or  Hyrie wild in the mountains, <br>
  Breaking her heart in the frosts and the fires of the uttermost lands? <br>
  <i>These</i> have their bitterness. This,  for Persephone, that for Oechalian <br>
  Homes, and the lights of a kindness blown out with the stress of her shame: <br>
  One for her child, and one for her sin; but thou above all art an alien, <br>
  Girt with the halos that vex thee, and wrapt in a grief beyond name. <br>
  Yet sayeth Sisyphus &mdash; Sisyphus, stricken and chained of the Minioned <br>
  Kings of great darkness, and trodden in dust by the feet of the fates &mdash; <br>
  &ldquo;Sweet are the ways of thy watching, and pallid and perished and pinioned, <br>
  Moon amongst maidens, I leap for thy love like a god at the gates &mdash; <br>
  Leap for the dreams of a rose of the heavens, and beat at the portals <br>
  Paved with the pain of unsatisfied pleadings for thee and for thine, <br>
  But Zeus is immutable Master, and these are the walls the Immortals <br>
  Build for our sighing, and who may set lips at the lords and repine? <br>
  Therefore,&rdquo; he saith, &ldquo;I am sick for thee, Merope, faint for the tender <br>
  Touch of thy mouth, and the eyes like the lights of an altar to me; <br>
  But lo, thou art far, and thy face is a still and a sorrowful splendour! <br>
  And the storm is abroad with the rain on the perilous straits of the sea.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AfterTheHunt"></a>After The Hunt</b></h2>
<p>Underneath the windy mountain walls <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth we rode, an eager band, <br>
  By the surges, and the verges, and the gorges, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the night was on the land &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hazy, mazy land! <br>
  Far away the bounding prey <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leapt across the ruts and logs, <br>
  But we galloped, galloped, galloped on, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till we heard the yapping of the dogs! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yapping and the yelping of the dogs. </p>
<p>Oh! it was a madly merry day <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not so soon forget, <br>
  And the edges, and the ledges, and the ridges, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunt us with their echoes yet &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoes, echoes, echoes yet! <br>
  While the moon is on the hill <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleaming through the streaming fogs, <br>
  Don&rsquo;t you gallop, gallop, gallop still?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you hear the yapping of the dogs &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yapping and the yelping of the dogs? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="RoseLorraine"></a>Rose Lorraine</b></h2>
<p>Sweet water-moons, blown into lights <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flying gold on pool and creek, <br>
  And many sounds and many sights, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of younger days are back this week. <br>
  I cannot say I sought to face, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or greatly cared to cross again, <br>
  The subtle spirit of the place <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose life is mixed with Rose Lorraine. </p>
<p>What though her voice rings clearly through <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nightly dream I gladly keep, <br>
  No wish have I to start anew <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart-fountains that have ceased to leap. <br>
  Here, face to face with different days, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And later things that plead for love, <br>
  It would be worse than wrong to raise <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom far too fain to move. </p>
<p>But, Rose Lorraine &mdash; ah, Rose Lorraine, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll whisper now where no one hears. <br>
  If you should chance to meet again <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man you kissed in soft dead years, <br>
  Just say for once &ldquo;he suffered much,&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And add to this &ldquo;his fate was worst <br>
  Because of me, my voice, my touch,&rdquo;&mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no passion like the first! </p>
<p>If I that breathe your slow sweet name <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one breathes low notes on a flute, <br>
  Have vext your peace with word of blame, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase is dead &mdash; the lips are mute. <br>
  Yet when I turn towards the wall, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stormy nights, in times of rain, <br>
  I often wish you could recall <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your tender speeches, Rose Lorraine. </p>
<p>Because, you see, I thought them true, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did not count you self-deceived, <br>
  And gave myself in all to you, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked on Love as Life achieved. <br>
  Then came the bitter, sudden change, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastened lips, the dumb despair: <br>
  The first few weeks were very strange, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long, and sad, and hard to bear. </p>
<p>No woman lives with power to burst <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion&rsquo;s bonds, and set me free; <br>
  For Rose is last where Rose was first, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only Rose is fair to me. <br>
  The faintest memory of her face, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilful face that hurt me so, <br>
  Is followed by a fiery trace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Rose Lorraine must never know. </p>
<p>I keep a faded ribbon string <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You used to wear about your throat; <br>
  And of this pale, this perished thing, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I know the threads by rote. <br>
  God help such love! To touch your hand, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To loiter where your feet might fall, <br>
  You marvellous girl, my soul would stand <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst of hell &mdash; its fires and all! </p>
