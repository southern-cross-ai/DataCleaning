<p class="first">APTAIN ALLAN WEDDERBURN, of His Highness the
Duke of Cumberland's Regiment, sat in his private room in the
dismantled Highland castle that had become the temporary
headquarters of himself and his men.

<p>He looked from the narrow lancet window at the wild Highland
scenery, and his handsome face wore an expression of discontent.
He was a loyal Government man, a keen soldier, and he longed to
be distinguishing himself in some active service, instead of
lounging here in charge of an unimportant position and an even
more unimportant prisoner, a son of one of the chiefs concerned
in the late Rising, who had been captured straggling from the
Culloden rout, and now awaited execution in Edinburgh or London.

<p>Captain Wedderburn was disgusted with such small prey; he, in
common with all the Government officers, longed to make the
notable capture of that illustrious rebel, the Young Pretender,
as the English called him, the Chevalier St. George, the son of
him whom the Jacks styled James III.

<p>It vexed Allan Wedderburn to the heart that he was tied to
this irksome and trifling duty when he might have been engaged in
the pursuit for the great prize which would bring honour and
renown and substantial reward. His grey eyes gazed at the distant
strip of sea, veiled by the afternoon mist of a dull day, and he
speculated bitterly as to the likelihood of Charles Stuart
slipping down to the coast, under cover of some such mist, and
escaping in the French barque that was sure to be lying in wait
in the offing.

<p>"Not if I had a free hand," he thought; "not if I was able to
scour the country!"

<p>And he reflected bitterly on the authorities who kept him thus
idle when he felt within him the capacity for greater service.

<p>True, he had been told to keep a sharp look-out and to guard
the coast, but that, he told himself, was foolishness the
fugitive would never choose as his point of escape this spot, so
well guarded by the redcoats, when miles of the sea were
unwatched.

<p>Captain Wedderburn yawned with boredom and vexation, and
turned over for the hundredth time the letter sent him by one of
his lieutenants, describing the disguise in which the unfortunate
aspirant to the throne of England was known to be travelling: "He
goes as a man-servant to Mrs. Grace Hume, a lady of a most
precise, puritanical demeanour, who is travelling with her
brother. They were lost sight of a week ago, but there is little
chance of the Prince having changed his guise. Keep, therefore, a
steady look-out for any such."

<p>Allan Wedderburn folded up the letter with a gesture of
annoyance.

<p>He felt a great vexation against Mrs. Grace Hume, the lady of
the precise, puritanical demeanour, who was so successfully
outwitting His Majesty's officers. Neither she nor her party had
been traced; Captain Wedderburn felt sourly certain that they
never would be. He yawned again and rose; it was the hour when he
had to pay his formal and useless visit to his prisoner and see
the guards changed about his prison.

<p>As he sauntered across the fine but rather bare and dreary
room, which was hung with antique tapestry and furnished with
handsome but worn pieces, his soldier-servant entered.

<p>"A lady wishes to see you, sir, with most urgent and important
news."

<p>Allan Wedderburn disguised his curiosity.

<p>"Let her send her message up."

<p>"She has already, sir, declined to do that."

<p>"It is impossible for me to see anyone now," said the officer
curtly. Then he wavered. "Of what deportment is she?"

<p>"Of the quality, sir, and handsome."

<p>Allan Wedderburn raised his eyebrows.

<p>"Is it possible, in this wilderness? I will see her, Saunders,
for a few minutes, and no more."

<p>When he was alone, the Captain glanced carelessly at himself
in the tortoiseshell-framed mirror that hung over the low
fireplace. In London he had been considered a personable man, and
no ill favourite with the ladies. For a moment he forgot his
dullness and his vexation, and pulled out his neat cravat with an
air of some complacency.

<p>When the lady entered he was standing at attention, very
courteous, smart, and elegant, from his powdered military
side-curls to his polished boots.

<p>She came in swiftly, closed the door, hesitated a moment, then
advanced, removing, as she did so, the riding-mask she wore, and
looking round it with a rather breathless eagerness.

<p>She was indeed handsome and of the quality. In one glance the
Captain saw that. She wore a square riding-jacket of a dark
emerald green colour, a full skirt of a deep violet-coloured
silk, and a long scarf of a rich tartan in which was much orange
and violet-purple.

<p>A wide hat of black felt, with a black feather, shaded a
charming brunette face and loose curls of a deep and glowing
brown.

<p>Allan Wedderburn bowed very low.

<p>The lady's full lips parted, and her eyes, that were the brown
of a dead leaf, yet bright, fluttered a glance over the person of
the Captain.

<p>"You will be wondering who I am," she said.

<p>"Something more than mortal, madam," responded the Captain
gallantly, putting forward the tapestry-covered chair he had been
using himself.

<p>The lady sank into it, billowing her skirts.

<p>"I'm the sister of Hector Clanronald," she stated. "You will
have been hearing of Hector Clanronald?"

<p>He had indeed, and his manner became even more respectful and
deferential.

<p>"The gentleman is the most powerful of the loyal chieftains.
As such, all His Majesty's soldiers have heard of him," he
replied. "I am honoured by the acquaintance of Miss Clanronald."

<p>He ventured a smile, and she responded with a delicious look,
shy and yet provoking.

<p>"Ah, Captain," she said, "it is a dull life you are leading
here, isn't it, now?"

<p>"It was till you entered, madam."

<p>"Ah, be done with your compliments; it is not them I'm after."

<p>She gave a little sigh and pressed a scrap of a handkerchief
like a silk cobweb to her full and rosy lips.

<p>"You will be marvelling at Nancy Clanronald coming to you like
this, Captain Wedderburn?" she added.

<p>"I marvel at nothing, madam, save my good fortune."

<p>"You've the London manner, sir. Pray consider I am a Highland
maiden, and spare me your flattery." And she smiled again in a
way that belied her words.

<p>"You have not spent your life among these barbarous hills," he
declared.

<p>"No," she admitted, playing with her mask. "I've been as far
as Edinburgh."

<p>The clock struck the half-hour.

<p>"Heaven help me!" exclaimed the Captain, thinking of his visit
of inspection. "I'm late for a duty of&mdash;If you will spare my
company for half an hour&mdash;"

<p>"I have not told you my errand yet," she remarked calmly.

<p>He stood divided between his duty and desire to prolong the
interview.

<p>"If you could await my return&mdash;"

<p>"What I have to say is a matter of moments," said Miss
Clanronald.

<p>"I am the most unfortunate of men, but my affair is urgent."

<p>She frowned.

<p>"So urgent?"

<p>"I have a prisoner."

<p>"A Jacobite?"

<p>"Yes. I am due to visit him."

<p>"Is he so important?" she smiled.

<p>He blushed at her slight air of mockery.

<p>"No, but my duty&mdash;"

<p>She rose with a little air of laughter.

<p>"Oh, your duty, Captain Wedderburn! What is your duty?"

<p>"At present to look after this silly young man, and to search
for the Pretender."

<p>He turned resolutely towards the door.

<p>"The Pretender!" cried Miss Clanronald. "Why, that is a
romantic story, is it not? They say he travels disguised as a
woman."

<p>"No, as groom to a Mrs. Grace Hume, madam."

<p>"Ah, you have heard that? We were told that story, too."

<p>"I have reason to believe it is true."

<p>She fixed her fine eyes on him.

<p>"Would you like to capture Charles Stuart, Captain
Wedderburn?"

<p>"I would give half my income to do so!" he declared, with
energy.

<p>"Do you think he will be caught?"

<p>"Certainly. He is a young hot-head, a fool, and his partisans
are now only a few silly women as this Mrs. Hume."

<p>She laughed.

<p>"I hope you will capture the Prince," she said.

<p>He had his hand out to the door.

<p>"You have any news, madam?" he asked, pausing.

<p>"Alas, none!"

<p>"Then, if you will forgive me&mdash;"

<p>"One moment!"

<p>She was suddenly imperative, commanding, in earnest; she
stretched out her hand to stay his going.

<p>He came back into the room.

<p>"Have you ever seen me before, Allan Wedderburn?" she asked.

<p>He was amazed to see that she was pale, and that tears were in
her beautiful eyes.

<p>"Why, never, madam!"

<p>"Look at me earnestly, sir."

<p>She came nearer to him and held up her face. He gazed at her a
little bewildered, a little enamoured by her charm and her
nearness. He marked the strands of hair across her brow, the
faint blue veins showing at her temples, the moisture on her
parted lips, his own reflection in her eyes.

<p>"Have you ever seen me before?" she repeated gravely.

<p>"Why, never!" he stammered.

<p>Her manner suddenly changed; she moved away with a gay smile.

<p>"Why, I was sure you had seen me, Captain Wedderburn. When you
have been out for your lonely rides, I have been near you more
than once."

<p>"On my soul, madam&mdash;"

<p>"Have you never seen a horsewoman coming through the mist in
the afternoon, when you have been abroad, sir?"

<p>"Never, madam."

<p>"Why, you must be in love to notice so little as that! Why, it
is a bad look-out for the Prince you'll be!"

<p>He blushed with vexation, but, beat his brains as he would, he
could not recall having seen any horsewomen when he had been
abroad.

<p>"If you will come to your errand, madam," he said a little
stiffly, pulling out his watch.

<p>"You are thinking of your prisoner, poor wretch?"

<p>"Of my duty, madam."

<p>"Oh, la, you are so stern, and what I have to say is so
difficult!"

<p>"Difficult?"

<p>He saw tears again in her eyes, and noticed that she was
trembling.

<p>"Are you married, sir?" she asked.

<p>He stared, confounded for a moment.

<p>"Married?"

<p>"That was what I asked you."

<p>"I am neither married nor betrothed, Miss Clanronald."

<p>"In love, perhaps?" she asked softly.

<p>"Why, madam, I hardly understand. I must leave you."

<p>"Ah, don't go. Captain Wedderburn!" she cried coaxingly.
"Listen to me, won't you? Sure, I shall be thinking your prisoner
is but an excuse to be rid of me. Ah, can't you be staying?"

<p>He stopped; once more his hand dropped from the door.

<p>"Miss Clanronald," he said, in some agitation, "if you would
tell me your errand&mdash;"

<p>"Take my hand," she answered.

<p>She held it out to him, a slim hand in a glove of white
doeskin, then withdrew it and gave it to him bare, slipping off
the gauntlet with nervous fingers. He took it, felt it quiver in
his grasp, and was strangely abashed.

<p>She looked at him very gravely, then suddenly gave a heartless
laugh.

<p>"Are you not curious?" she demanded.

<p>"You fool me, madam!" he answered haughtily, and withdrew his
hand.

<p>Resolutely he turned towards the door.

<p>"Oh, listen to me, sir!" she cried, and there was a note like
desperation in her voice.

<p>"Madam, I believe that I have listened long enough. You must
excuse me."

<p>He had the door open.

<p>"Captain Wedderburn," said the lady, very pale, "I bring you a
proposal of marriage!"

<p>The door-handle slipped through his fingers.

<p>"A proposal of marriage?"

<p>He came back towards her chair.

<p>"Ah, there, now," she laughed, "if you are not frightened,
sir!"

<p>"You are a very charming woman, Miss Clanronald, but mighty
provoking!"

<p>She rose, hands clasped on her bosom.

<p>"Listen. The lady is young, passable, very wealthy, very well
born, free, and very enamoured of you."

<p>"Of me?" He coloured, despite his composure. "But this is
impossible!"

<p>"Fie! Are you so modest as that? Yet she is not the first,
I'll swear. Come, sir, don't stand so dumb. Don't you take me?"

<p>"By Heaven, I do not!" he cried, bewildered. "And I have my
duty&mdash;"

<p>"Oh, sir, 'tis myself who admire you! And if you will ask
Clanronald for my hand&mdash;Why, you are amazed! Am I so
hideous? The best match in the Highlands, sir!" He stood
dumbfounded, unable to speak. "I've been in love with you so
long," she smiled, holding out her hands to him "ever since you
came here!"

<p>"But three weeks!" he gasped.

<p>"Long enough. What have you to say to me, Captain Wedderburn?"

<p>He sank into a chair and stared at her. Very lovely she was,
without a doubt, and the sister of Clanronald, wealthy, noble.

<p>"You abash me," he stammered, "you overwhelm me. Forgive
me&mdash;"

<p>A distant boom of a gun broke the pause. The lady raised her
downcast head, and a flash came into her eyes.

<p>"What is that?" asked the Captain, rising to his feet. She
rose, too, and seemed about to answer, when the door was hastily
opened and another officer entered. The lady raised her mask
before her face and stepped into the window embrasure.

<p>"Wedderburn," cried the new-comer, "we have the Prince!"

<p>"Captured?"

<p>"Safe&mdash;here in this house! I have just galloped with the
news. Wyndham Brew told me to ride for my life and tell you. Man,
'tis your prisoner!"

<p>"My prisoner?" shrieked the Captain.

<p>"The very same. The youth he changed with has been
captured&mdash;the truth is out. You are to take him to London."

<p>"His companions?"

<p>"Parted from him when they heard the disguise was known. Ah, a
lady!"

<p>He bowed.

<p>"The sister of Hector Clanronald," said the Captain, still
giddy and bewildered.

<p>"The sister of Hector Clanronald?" repeated the other. "Why,
he has no sister! I know the family well."

<p>"Has no sister?"

<p>"My life on it!"

<p>The lady came forward, dropping the mask.

<p>"Mrs. Grace Hume, at your service," she said. "You will
remember me, Major Murray?"

<p>"Mrs. Hume it is," said that officer. "What is the meaning of
this, Wedderburn?"

<p>"I'll tell you," said she, very soft. "It means we snap our
fingers at you once more. The Prince has escaped you!"

<p>"Escaped?" cried both men at once.

<p>"I heard just now the gun, the signal that he was safe on
board the French boat," she replied, "and my part is at an
end&mdash;an end!"

<p>"You came to fool me!" exclaimed Allan Wedderburn fiercely.

<p>"We tampered with the Highland guard you set on His Highness.
The two of them escaped hours ago. I came to distract you and
give them more time, that is all."

<p>He eyed her. Pale he was and frowning.

<p>"Arrest her!" said the other man, in a fury.

<p>She shivered! She looked very tired and grave.

<p>"And you such a puritanical, precise lady!" murmured Allan
Wedderburn.

<p>"Think the more of what I did, then," she answered him. "Think
the more of these silly women who are loyal to Charles Stuart."
She looked from one to another. "I am under arrest?" she added.

<p>"Take your liberty," said the Captain.

<p>She moved towards the door. The boom of another gun gave the
last defiance of the French frigate that took Charles Stuart from
England for ever, and the woman who had saved him, and who would
never see him again, listened, then left the castle and rode into
the mists of the Scottish afternoon.</p>
