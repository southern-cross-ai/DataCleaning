<p class="first">
AMBROSE MORNAY cautiously crept between the bare vine poles
which had just been planted in the soft newly-turned ground,
jumped a low wall of red brick which separated the vineyard and
the fruit garden from the flower garden, and so stood at the
bottom of the lawn and terraces of the Château Mornay, looking up
at that building that had been his home and, by inheritance, was
his property, but which he had not seen since he had fled from
the château and the country, fled for his life in the Revolution,
the first of those terrible days of blood and desolation, the
first fury of that storm which had afterwards swept away king,
queen, princes, nobility, as a scythe sweeps off the heads of the
flowers among the corn, and had levelled with the dust the old
order of things in France as a sea wave will level a sand castle
built by the hands of a child.</p>

<p>So he had fled, he and his family, with no more than they
could carry with them, and had escaped in the boat of a fisher
from the neighbouring fishing village, whose father had been one
of their peasants, and so had tossed into Calais roads and
finally on to the friendly coast of England. There they had
lived, in exile and in poverty, but in peace.</p>

<p>The father had a few securities in England which brought them
in a modest income, the two daughters taught the French language
and the fine French embroidery learnt at the Ursuline convent. He
(Ambrose) had taught fencing, and tried hard to forget the past
and his bitter yearning for the old life and his own land.</p>

<p>Then one day he had found his elder sister in bitter, silent
tears. She had only a sad mystery to offer to his eager
questions, but presently he drew the truth from his mother.</p>

<p>Hélène was in love. What would you? She was twenty-five and
beautiful. If misfortune had not happened, she would have been
wedded long ago. It was another emigré, a young count, who made
his living by his fine handwriting, copying for a great London
bank. Between them they had not enough to buy a wedding-ring, and
there was the tragedy. Again, what would you?</p>

<p>And Ambrose had suddenly revolted against exile and misfortune
and poverty. Here was one woman's life blighted, and another fair
girl growing up uselessly, hopelessly.</p>

<p>So it came that he took the price of his last series of
fencing lessons, travelled to Dover in the boot of the public
stage, grimly enduring discomfort, crossed the Channel in one of
the English fishing fleet, and made his way along the coast to
his old home.</p>

<p>At the tiny village near by he found the man who had rescued
them three years before, and with him made a compact that he was
again to be taken to England in the little fishing barque.</p>

<p>From this man Ambrose also gathered details of the château. It
had been confiscated, of course, but who was the present owner
the fisher did not know. Several deputies, members of the
Committee of Public Safety and great ones of the Revolution, had
stayed there for a day or two when coming down to terrorise the
countryside or hunt for aristocrats or emigrés. The place was
well kept, the fellow had added, and now Ambrose stood at the
foot of the château he saw for himself that this was true.</p>

<p>He passed slowly behind the thick hedge of shrubs which
bordered the lawn that swept in smooth green grass up to an
ancient cypress, black and spreading, which stood below the
terraces. It seemed to Ambrose that this was another of his
exile's dreams, and that presently the scene would vanish, and
the dreary houses of Bed Lion Square close round him again.</p>

<p>The château stood on ground slightly rising, four walls and
four rounded tourelles ending in delicate spires. The wide door,
the green-shuttered windows, the bridge over what had once been
the moat, the two formal stone terraces with the stone seats and
the great vases of flowers at the top of the steps, the
outbuildings, the stables, the farms beyond, with the gilded
weathercock, the meadows sloping to the woods, the woods
darkening into the distance&mdash;all was unchanged as it had
been unchanged since the days when the château was built in the
reign of King Francis I.</p>

<p>Ambrose had satisfied himself that the château was empty and
that no one was about, but he still moved cautiously, keeping
himself within the shadows of the laurels.</p>

<p>It was early April and intensely still. When he turned and
looked behind him, he could see the ocean blue between the bare
trees, low and still, melting into the paler sky, but the murmur
of it was faintly in his ears and filled the air persistently as
a perfume.</p>

<p>No trees were green save the olives which sloped down to the
sea, but all had a look of life, of vitality, as if they were but
waiting to break into bloom. Here and there the violets and
primroses still lingered, and in the meadows blew the purple
wind-flowers and the white-and-yellow clusters of the
narcissi.</p>

<p>Ambrose drew in the air in great breaths, it was so sweet, so
sweet! And it was his&mdash;his father's and his. Here his life
had been spent, here he had meant to die. And now he was creeping
back, an outcast, an exile, creeping back, like a thief, to his
own!</p>

<p>The angry tears rushed to his eyes, his shoulders heaved. He
set his teeth and hastened on towards the château. White pigeons
were wheeling before it, but there was no other sign of
life&mdash;no horse, no dog, no open window, no smoke from any
chimney.</p>

<p>Ambrose came boldly out on to the terrace, and the sun met him
and enclosed him in warmth like a generous embrace of welcome. He
noticed that grass grew on the terrace and before the door, that
the windows were all shuttered and bolted across, and that the
bolts were rusty from the sea air, as if they had been in that
position for some time.</p>

<p>Ambrose quickly and lightly crossed the terrace and gained the
right side of the château, which was in shadow. There he paused,
listening. There were only two sounds&mdash;that universal murmur
of the sea and the cooing of the strutting pigeons.</p>

<p>Through the bare trees he could see a long way to right and
left, before and behind, and his eyes searched keenly. There was
no one. Looking before him, a line of peach trees bordered the
vine poles; the deep pink of the blossoms against the blue sea
and the bare trees awakened a sudden memory that was like a pain
in his heart.</p>

<p>A memory of such another day of peace, of stillness, of clear
sunshine, a memory of a girl, bare-headed, bare-footed, in a
white cotton frock, creeping in among the peach trees and
breaking off branches of the blossom.</p>

<p>So he had found her, a daring peasant child, robbing the trees
of the flowers which would become his father's fruit. If it had
been a boy, Ambrose would have used the whip he carried. Even
though it was a girl, his anger had flared, and he had ordered
her off in angry tones.</p>

<p>But she had shown defiance; she had grasped the peach boughs
tight against the bosom of her ragged gown and faced him. And
then, because he had seen that she was more than pretty, he fell
to laughing at her spirit, and, barring her way, asked her
name.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline," she had answered hotly, staring at him, lowering
and fierce, a fair thing, brown and gold, flushed and panting,
with dishevelled strands of auburn hair blowing about her face,
and for her background the blue sea and the dark pink masses of
the peach blossoms. "Jacqueline of the Peach Blossoms," he had
named her in mockery, and, taking her arm, had offered to let her
go with her plunder for a kiss.</p>

<p>She had fiercely refused, wounding his pride, and he had taken
his kiss by force with a laugh that was not gentle.</p>

<p>How clearly he remembered now the feel of her warm, sunburnt
cheek, the gesture of wrath with which she had flung down the
disputed blossoms at his feet, broken away and beaten through the
bushes like an angry, hunted animal.</p>

<p>Afterwards he had met her many times on the sea-shore, among
the olive slopes in the white street of the village, or in the
meadows.</p>

<p>She had had no curtsey for him, though he was the heir of
Mornay, and he had always had his jest of her, greeting her
laughingly as "Jacqueline of the Peach Blossoms."</p>

<p>How long ago it all seemed now, how remote, how foolish! And
yet with what painful distinctness the little incident came back
as he stared at the same peach trees rosy against the same
sea!</p>

<p>With an effort he shook the memories from him and turned to
his business. Following the side of the château, he came to the
window of the room he wanted&mdash;the long window of the
library, which opened like a door on to the terrace.</p>

<p>The beating of his heart increased as, taking from their case
the tools he had brought with him, he proceeded to unfasten the
bolts and lift the bars which held the faded green shutter in
place. The fastenings were not very elaborate nor very difficult,
and he soon had the shutters swinging loose in his hands.</p>

<p>The tall glass windows were bolted again from the inside, but
Ambrose shivered the glass, put his hand through the aperture,
and slipped back the fastenings. Creaking from rust, they gave
way, and Ambrose stepped into the library, behind him a stream of
sunlight that showed the motes in the close atmosphere of the
room.</p>

<p>Ambrose moved stealthily, saw that the room was empty, saw
that it was much as he had left it, and leant against the wall,
suddenly weak with a sense of homesickness. Evidently there had
been nothing in the library that had attracted the cupidity of
the mob, nothing that roused their lust of destruction. The
smooth waxed walls, the colour of dark amber, were undefaced, the
portraits of dead Mornays, in ruff or wimple, armour or periwig,
had been respected; they still hung in a level row above the low
bookcases, and looked out, calmly smiling or calmly grave, from
the dimmed gold of their frames. The very books were untouched,
the Greeks and Latins, the ancient French, stood erect and well
ordered. There were the desks, dark and yet shining, with their
drooping handles shaped like fuchsia blossoms, the leather chairs
with brass nails, the shining floor&mdash;all was well kept.
Ambrose thought the place looked exactly as it had looked when he
left it three years ago.</p>

<p>Hope sprang up brilliant in his heart. If all was untouched,
then what he had come for must be untouched, too. Above the wide
open hearth and beneath the antique stone mantelpiece was a long,
low panel of wood deeply and finely carved with the arms of
Mornay. Ambrose went to this and gently touched it with his
forefinger. He had reached the end of his quest.</p>

<p>The scene when he had last stood on this spot was very vividly
before his mind. His two sisters, clinging together and trying
not to weep; from without his father's voice urging them to
haste, rising out of the turmoil of fierce noises which came from
the peasantry, who were attacking the château in front; his
mother trying with nervous fingers to wrench back this panel
behind which all the family treasures were hidden; then the
bursting open of the doors, the entrance of the red-capped sans
culotte who had discharged his pistol at the lady&mdash;there was
the lead still deep-embedded in the wall behind where Madame
Mornay had stood&mdash;the wild flight of all through the window
into the merciful half dark which had protected them.</p>

<p>And now Ambrose Mornay stood again before that panel which
hid, he believed, what would for ever relieve their poverty, that
which would dower his sisters and give comfort to his parents and
himself.</p>

<p>If only it had not been tampered with! On which side were the
gods to-day? It was some time before he could sufficiently steady
himself to touch the secret spring which was concealed in a rose
of the foliated border. At last he nerved himself and put his
finger on the button.</p>

<p>The beautiful mechanism instantly responded, the panel slid
noiselessly back, and a deep cavity in the wall was
visible&mdash;a deep cavity filled with boxes, cases, bundles of
papers and rolls of documents all kept fresh, dry and free from
moth or rat by the steel-lined walls.</p>

<p>Ambrose put his hand over his heart and blessed God with tears
in his eyes. First he took out all the family papers and put them
carefully into his pockets. Over the rolls of bank bills he
hesitated; they were, he feared, of little use now, though
amounting in face value to many thousands of livres, but there
were contracts, bills of purchase, receipts, title-deeds relating
to property in Spain and the East, which he eagerly seized.</p>

<p>Then, having disposed of these matters, he took out the
caskets and boxes one at a time and placed them on the floor
beside him.</p>

<p>The largest, a casket of dull grey satin embroidered with seed
pearls stretched over a frame of cedar-wood, he quickly
opened&mdash;as all the others, it was not locked. Within,
enclosed in a bag of mauve velvet, he found what he sought. The
famous Mornay diamonds, the homage of a former King of France to
a long-dead mistress of the château&mdash;they were all intact,
strings of flashing brilliancy for neck and wrist, a star for the
bosom, long pendants for the ears, all like frozen crystal with
liquid gold and molten fire, the tumultuous blue of the sea, the
passionate red of live blood, the vivid green of imprisoned water
flashing in their hearts and striving to be free of their white
prison, all beautiful with the beauty of things eternal and
unchangeable.</p>

<p>Ambrose put them back softly into the casket and opened the
others. In one was a parure of pearls and emeralds fitting each
piece into its own piece in the velvet-lined tray, old-fashioned
in design and exquisite in the quality of the stones; in another
was a gentleman's solitaire diamond and waistcoat buttons of
jasper and topaz, together with shoe buckles of gold and
brilliants; in another more women's ornaments of rubies
sapphires, and fine silver, while a tall box of sandalwood
contained all manner of rings, cameos, intaglios, cut gem and
seal rings and ladies' rings of precious and sparkling
stones.</p>

<p>There still remained in the back of the recess several
valuable sword hilts and pistols, together with some parcels of
gold plate and a few articles of rock crystal. These were,
however, too heavy for Ambrose to contemplate taking them with
him; nor did he even dare to waste time in regrets.</p>

<p>Spreading his silk handkerchief on the polished floor, he
emptied one casket after the other on to it, the diamonds on top
of all, so that the whole gleamed like a cluster of fallen stars
in the broad beam that fell from the open window.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, as he was preparing to knot the handkerchief
together and conceal his treasure about his person, this sunlight
was obscured, and the jewels flashed more dimly in shadow.</p>

<p>Ambrose looked up instantly, then rose to his feet and stood
erect. A woman stood in the long window. She had come so softly
that only her shadow had betrayed her. She stood now with an air
of softness and lightness, her hands hanging at her side, her
eyes very observant.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a full gown the colour of sea-lavender, a
hue between sharp blue and misty grey; she wore a cap of fine
muslin&mdash;through which her autumn hair gleamed as sunlight
behind a cloud&mdash;and an apron of silvered silk.</p>

<p>She was beautiful and brown and rosy, her face was thoughtful
and yet gay. In her ears hung the large gold hoops loved by the
peasantry. Her black latchet shoes were low enough to show a
white silk stocking encasing a slender ankle.</p>

<p>Ambrose saw all these details as clearly as he had once seen
the details of a flower through a magnifying glass. He stood
bewildered, dumb, then suddenly his voice and his memory served
him.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline of the Peach Blossoms!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She flushed deeper and her eyes darkened into a sombre
brilliancy. But she said nothing. Perhaps she was trying to
recall in this quiet young man, in the rather worn olive-coloured
travelling suit, with the plain turned back hair and the simple
neckcloth, the gorgeous young gentleman who had kissed her under
the peach trees.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" he challenged her silence.</p>

<p>"Ah," she answered, "what do I mean to do? This time it is I
who catch the great seigneur stealing&mdash;and stealing what is
more valuable than peach blossoms!"</p>

<p>"I take what is my own!" he flashed back.</p>

<p>"Nothing here is your own," she said calmly and with force.
"The château belongs now to a certain Monsieur Fabre."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I am his housekeeper," she replied serenely.</p>

<p>"He is here now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He is an old gentleman, and uses a few rooms only. He
never comes here; that is why I knew, when I saw the window open,
that there was some thief here, Monsieur Mornay."</p>

<p>She still spoke with level quietness and still retained her
post in the window, blocking out the sun from him. He, too, was
calm, in desperation and despair.</p>

<p>"M. Fabre's son is in the house, too, to-day," she continued
with an air of triumph, "or soon will be, and if I clap my hands
or ring this"&mdash;she stepped suddenly into the room and under
the long bell-rope&mdash;"he will come and deal with you."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid," breathed Ambrose, "that I might wring
your pretty neck, Jacqueline, first?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she mocked. "You are a great seigneur, Monsieur
Mornay!"</p>

<p>"So you trade on that," he smiled with pallid lips,
"These&mdash;these Fabres"&mdash;his tone was bitter as he spoke
the name of the usurpers&mdash;"are of the people?"</p>

<p>She smiled with a pride equal to his own.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur. The son is a great soldier&mdash;he has done
much in La Vendée."</p>

<p>Ambrose folded his arms and leant back against the wall. "The
Revolution has changed you," he remarked, glancing at her from
head to foot; "you have flourished in these years of
liberty."</p>

<p>She gave him look for look. "You, too, have changed."</p>

<p>"I know. Does it please you? You have a pretty face, but a
vulgar little heart, I doubt not." So said he in his wrath and
bitterness.</p>

<p>Her blush deepened again, but she answered quietly: "Oh, I
have my revenge! You humiliated me when I was a silly child, and
now I humiliate you."</p>

<p>Ambrose answered gravely: "Nay, you do not humiliate me. You
find me taking what is my own, what I have great and pressing
need of."</p>

<p>Her eyes flickered to the bell-rope.</p>

<p>"Oh, ring!" said Ambrose. "Ring, my child, and let us end this
foolish conversation. What will your master do with me, eh?"</p>

<p>"Shoot you in the ditch," she replied. "Oh, yes, and bury you
like a dog, of course. Oh, yes! Say your prayers, Monsieur
Mornay!" And she stamped her foot in some kind of fury. "Why do
you think me so hateful?" she suddenly demanded. "Once you
thought I was too mean to refuse your kiss, and now you think I
am too mean to be anything but your executioner."</p>

<p>He thought, perhaps, she might want his entreaties, his
flatteries, but it was not in him to give her those. "I think you
will serve your own kind," he replied coldly. "Why do you not
ring?"</p>

<p>For reply, she picked up the handkerchief full of jewels.
Casting it on the desk beside her she picked up the ornaments one
at a time and, gazing at them, she gave a mocking laugh.</p>

<p>"So you had your secret treasures there all the time. Who is
the lady whose charms have driven you to this dangerous
enterprise, Monsieur Mornay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jacqueline, little Jacqueline," he answered, "because I
once kissed you against your will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are bold to remind me of it!" cried she, flaming.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Must you insult me when I am at your mercy, you poor,
silly child? I wanted the jewels to redeem us from poverty and,
most of all, to dower my dear sister. Now they will adorn the
neck of this upstart's wife, and I had rather that they had been
flung into the sea. As for the papers they will find on me
afterwards, I pray you, for charity, ask them to burn them or
fling them with me in the ditch, for I know it is useless to ask
you to send them to my parents."</p>

<p>She did not reply; she bent her head and, crossing the room,
stooped and picked up all the empty caskets, flung them into the
secret recess, and drew the sliding panel into place. Then she
returned to the handkerchief of jewels and knotted the four
corners of the silk together crossways, like a peasant's
bundle.</p>

<p>"Those are her spoils," he thought; "she will not share
them."</p>

<p>Jacqueline had hardly drawn the last knot tight before the
door was rather violently opened and a tall man stepped into the
apartment.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300721h-images/Jacqueline-2.png" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">The door was rather violently opened.</p>

<p>The girl seemed more surprised than Ambrose; she with
difficulty suppressed a scream, and leant back against the wall,
her face suddenly frightened. Ambrose stood quite still, quite
colourless, quite fearless.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300721h-images/Jacqueline-3.png" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">She with difficulty
suppressed a scream, and leant back against the wall.</p>

<p>The newcomer was handsome in a dark, heavy fashion, and
richly, though plainly, dressed. Ambrose at once guessed him to
be the son of the present owner of the château.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he cried, glancing from one to the other. "I
heard voices. I know there should be no one here. What is it, eh,
Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>She came forward. "Chut!" she cried. "You frightened me! I
thought you were out."</p>

<p>"Nay, I am here, as you see," he answered keenly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jacqueline, "I suppose you will be angry."</p>

<p>She looked straightly at the man who was waiting to hear his
death sentence from her lips. Not the least sign of dread nor
terror, agitation nor fear, did Ambrose Mornay show. He stood
completely at his ease, a man in his own house. He glanced once
sideways out of the broken window at the peach trees, and he
smiled a little ironically at a memory. The other man waited.</p>

<p>"Oh, how grim you look!" cried Jacqueline. "What do you think
I have to tell you? This fellow is one of those strolling pedlars
who are always coming, and whom you forbade me to see. These are
his samples"&mdash;she calmly held up the handkerchief of
jewels&mdash;"and&mdash;oh, what is a girl to do who never sees
Paris? I let him in here, thinking you would not find us."</p>

<p>Ambrose felt suddenly sick and giddy, the branches of the
distant peach blossoms danced madly before his eyes. Now she had
given him his life, or a chance of life, he knew how terrible had
been the near approach of death.</p>

<p>"And the broken window?" asked the other man.</p>

<p>"Why, the shutter was rusty and I was in a hurry, and so it
broke, Monsieur Fabre." Jacqueline shrugged her shoulders. She
turned to Ambrose. "And now you had better go, fellow; your goods
are too dear, and you are getting me into trouble with my
master."</p>

<p>Ambrose rallied. "Although you have purchased nothing," he
said, with a very low bow, "I shall never forget my kind
reception here. I pray for our future meeting."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall," she said carelessly. "But do not come here
again, friend, for we are strictly kept."</p>

<p>"Let me see the samples," demanded M. Fabre quietly.</p>

<p>"No," answered Jacqueline. "If we once untie his bundles, we
must buy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might buy you a fairing, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>She faced him straightly. "There is nothing there I care for,"
she said, and handed the handkerchief to Ambrose. He was still
giddy, still dazed as he took it from her. He picked up his hat
and cloak, gave her one look as he uttered his conventional
farewells, and was gone through the broken window.</p>

<p>Man and girl stood silent, watching his figure disappear
across the terraces. It was the man who spoke first.</p>

<p>"That was young Mornay. Why did you let him go?"</p>

<p>She paled but smiled. "For honour's sake."</p>

<p>"Why did you lie to me? Did you think I believed that foolish
story?"</p>

<p>"At least it served."</p>

<p>"Why was he here?"</p>

<p>"He had some family treasures hidden here," answered
Jacqueline. "He needed them&mdash;they are poor."</p>

<p>"So am I," said M. Fabre grimly.</p>

<p>"Ah, you do not need money!" she flashed.</p>

<p>"I might want jewels."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"For the wife I may marry."</p>

<p>"Your wife," said Jacqueline, "will only want the jewels you
can earn for her yourself, monsieur."</p>

<p>He stepped forward suddenly and caught her by the shoulders.
"Do you know that I love you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacqueline, bravely holding up her face.</p>

<p>"Why did you let him go?" he asked passionately.</p>

<p>"Listen! In the old days he caught me stealing peach blossoms.
Before he let me go he kissed me against my will. I hated him.
Then he named me 'Jacqueline of the Peach Blossoms.' People took
that name for me. When you took the château you heard it and
liked it, and sought me out for your servant, and it was under
the peach trees we met, the first time a year ago&mdash;do you
remember?&mdash;when I was coming up to the château, with my
bundle, to be your servant. And after a little I no longer hated
the man who had given me the name you liked. Do you understand? I
owed him something&mdash;I paid that debt to-day."</p>

<p>At the end of her breathless recital she drooped her flushed
face, and to kiss left only the muslin cap that veiled the
gleaming hair.</p>

<p>"Oh, sweet," he said, "I love you so!" And after a little he
added: "But if I had not loved you, I should never have let you
fool me!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Charles," she answered shyly, looking up and lifting her
face, "had I not known that you loved me, I should never have
tried!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IN after-times the château returned to the
possession of the Mornay family, and Ambrose Mornay lived there
with an English bride who wore his mother's jewels; but the
finest of the Mornay diamonds sparkled on the throat of Madame
Fabre, a wedding gift from him who had named her "Jacqueline of
the Peach Blossoms." And when her husband was one of the famous
