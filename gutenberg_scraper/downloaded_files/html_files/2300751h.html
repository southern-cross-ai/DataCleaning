<p class="first">"DON'T look at those drawings."</p>

<p>Bearden spoke so sharply that his wife dropped the folio she
had just taken from the tall carved bureau in the corner of the
spacious office, and turned, alarmed, at the strange tone in that
familiar voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, you startled me," she said in confusion; and, stooping,
gathered the drawings and replaced them in the portfolio, adding:
"Why shouldn't I look at them? I came on them by chance...you're
late. You said you'd be back half an hour ago. I've been
waiting."</p>

<p>John Bearden had again assumed his usual quiet manner.</p>

<p>"Of course," he answered, "there is no reason why you should
not look at the drawings. They are old things. I am rather
ashamed of them, I suppose, and it startled me a little to see
you at that bureau; I can't remember when it was last unlocked.
It's a long time ago, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I don't know why I went to it, except&mdash;well, chance.
Just because I was rather idle and bored, I suppose, waiting here
for you. You know, I thought about something for our house,
'Bellflowers.'"</p>

<p>He heard, but he did not respond to this remark, which she
tried to make very animated and enthusiastic. Being a most
sensitive woman, she said at once:</p>

<p>"Of course you are tired of 'Bellflowers.' I have made too
many suggestions and alterations."</p>

<p>"Bellflowers" was the house he was building for her&mdash;for
them both. Their marriage was commonly called an ideal marriage,
and this was to be an ideal house, a material realisation of
those castles in the air so romantically and consistently
cherished by many, achieved by so few.</p>

<p>Two years they had been employed&mdash;she for nearly all her
time, he for nearly all his leisure&mdash;in this building of
"Bellflowers."</p>

<p>He was an architect, famous as well as successful. She was a
woman with both money and taste, who lived in a fastidious,
elegant world of her own creation; and herself created a
fastidious and elegant world for others by the sheer radiance of
her presence, which was at once still and lovely, delicate and
strong. She had always created a rich world for her husband. They
faced each other rather awkwardly in he luxurious room of his own
designing, which was part of the office suite which he had in
this old and gracious house.</p>

<p>She so seldom came to his office, and now she had come and
waited for him, and been moved to look in the bureau which he
kept there, for the sake of its beauty of line and the dark,
richly orange colour of the ancient lacquer; and he, though he
stood so quiet, did not know how to deal with this meeting.</p>

<p>She, too, felt ill at ease, holding the old drawings in the
worn green marble portfolio, and she looked at him shyly,
wondering why he had been displeased to find her there, why he
had made that explanation.</p>

<p>"I've been glancing at your old stuff," she confessed, making
an agreeable effort to rid the moment of its awkward strain, "and
I liked the drawings very much. Please, John, cannot I still look
at them?"</p>

<p>He repeated sullenly:</p>

<p>"They're old stuff, don't bother with them. I did them years
ago, before we met."</p>

<p>"Designed for gardens," she said, "designed for houses."</p>

<p>"Of course, I never did anything else, did I?"</p>

<p>"But it looks like <i>the</i> garden and <i>the</i> house,"
smiled Aurelia Bearden.</p>

<p>Her husband turned away to his desk, and bent over some
letters which waited there for him to sign.</p>

<p>"What made you come down here, Aurelia?" he asked, not looking
at her. "Couldn't you have waited till this evening about the
house?"</p>

<p>"I'm worrying you, I suppose." Her smile was rather faint. She
had the presumptuous vanity to believe she could never worry
anyone. "Now I have this idea in my head, the house doesn't seem
quite right."</p>

<p>"Not even after all the trouble?" he replied as lightly as
possible, and yet it seemed a lightness that cost him an effort.
"Not quite right yet?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it never will be," she conceded. "I don't know.
There is something a little wrong&mdash;one does worry, I
suppose...too much...and seeing those drawings..." A note of
excitement crept into her delicious voice. "I thought I'd found
it. These old drawings of yours...who knows, John...?" She put
forward her plea very delicately and diffidently. "Perhaps before
you were quite successful and famous, there was something&mdash;I
don't know&mdash;something about your work&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's missing now, I suppose." He finished the sentence for
her, and finished it perfectly. "Don't tell me that, Aurelia.
There is nothing more irritating for a man than to be told that
his work has gone off. Success is nothing at all if you feel that
you are not doing as well as you did at first."</p>

<p>"Why, of course I know that," she said hurriedly. "But it
wasn't at all what I meant to imply&mdash;do look at them,
John&mdash;I expect you have forgotten all about them, and they
really are odd&mdash;beautiful drawings."</p>

<p>He brought the portfolio to his desk and laid it open before
him, and with fine elegant fingers turned over the drawings and
sketches in water-colour and in pencil, and the designs on blue
paper traced in white and red; formal architectural designs,
which all seemed to be intended for one house.</p>

<p>There were studies in water-colour for a garden quidnunc; a
pleached walk, a walk that looked dark, haunted with melancholy
and had a white, remote statue in the midst of the shadows; a
terrace and the interior of a low chamber which looked out on to
the moonlight over the wide park.</p>

<p>"Fantasies," remarked John Bearden, "a boy's
fancies&mdash;nothing in them&mdash;not practical."</p>

<p>"But you made your name," she reminded him, "on fantasies like
these...."</p>

<p>"Don't remind me of that prize," he smiled rather dryly. "One
never gets away from these things; if I hadn't done it on that I
should have done it on something else."</p>

<p>"Of course," she conceded, but not with conviction. She wished
that he would not so often belittle that extraordinary piece of
luck which had made his career when he had won the great prize
offered by a very wealthy, eccentric man, for a castle to be
built in the Tyrol, crowning a mountain, overhanging a
valley.</p>

<p>The prize had been so handsome and so well advertised that
architects from all over the world had competed. And it had been
John Bearden&mdash;then a very young and very obscure
man&mdash;who had won the glittering trophy of money and
fame.</p>

<p>His design, and the manifold drawings that accompanied it, had
been so beautiful, so lively and stately, so practical and yet so
original, an artist's dream materialised, that he had touched, at
once, those ambitious summits that most men deem themselves happy
to achieve in old age.</p>

<p>But more than this&mdash;it was through the prize drawings
that he had met Aurelia. All the designs that had competed had
been exhibited in a London gallery, and Aurelia&mdash;fine,
fastidious, difficult to please&mdash;had gone to see them and
paused before the winning drawing, not knowing even that it had
procured the prize, but fascinated entirely by this
house&mdash;this palace&mdash;rising from garden and woods.</p>

<p>"Why, I dreamt about that place," she had exclaimed at once.
"I've been there in dreams." And then she tried to laugh away the
commonplace remark. "We've all had that feeling, haven't we?" she
added lightly to her companion. But it was not lightly that she
gazed at the pictured house which she felt that she knew so well;
surely she had once wandered from one room to another, yes, and
over the gardens too. "Isn't it extraordinary?" she was forced to
murmur. And her companion had told her, rather dryly, that
everyone thought it "extraordinary."</p>

<p>For this was the winning drawing, which had brought, not only
the prize of several thousands of pounds to the lucky young man
who had conceived it, but also a substantial and brilliant
future.</p>

<p>"I must meet that young man," mused Aurelia. And she had met
him and married him within a few months.</p>

<p>She could never think of him as a stranger&mdash;the man who
could design that house must have had some entry into her soul
long before they had met in the flesh. Hand in hand they had
walked through that castle in the air, of that she was convinced.
His dream and her dream had been identical&mdash;one
dream&mdash;she was certain. He had been able to put his dream on
paper&mdash;so to arrange it that it could be reared in stone and
brick and marble, among trees and rocks. Her dream had been held
in her heart secretly; but they had met because of
it&mdash;nothing could shake her faith in that...the dream they
had shared in spirit so long before they knew of the existence of
each other.</p>

<p>He told her that the prize drawings were the result of years
of meditation on that particular house or palace which had
haunted him, and she said that she also had meditated on such a
house and walked through it with him&mdash;she was sure...yes,
there had always been someone with her in those dreams, though
shadowy, impersonal.</p>

<p>This was the sort of marriage that kind people liked to talk
about&mdash;in every way happy and delightful&mdash;both of them
so intelligent, so enthusiastic, so keen to enjoy every aspect of
life, so gifted, and in their quiet fashion, so handsome to look
at&mdash;he thin and dark, she slight and fair&mdash;both tall
and graceful&mdash;both so delighted each in the other...and in
their odd, mutual fantasy.</p>

<p>That was ten years ago; and if there was a lessening in the
lustre of their glittering happiness, it was due to the fact that
John Bearden had never accomplished any masterpiece equal to that
first one. If he had not begun his career with such a glittering
success, he would have been no more than a competent,
accomplished architect. Everyone knew this, though no one said it
to his face. No one was quite sure whether Aurelia knew it. She
always talked of her husband in terms of the most enthusiastic
loyalty.</p>

<p>His work was highly paid and highly prized. Perhaps his
patrons, confused by the splendour of that first success, never
realised how far his subsequent creation had fallen short of that
first superb achievement.</p>

<p>Now it was all endeavour&mdash;yes, for years it had been
endeavour on the part of John Bearden; but that first design had
been achievement...</p>

<p>He was hard-working, energetic, accomplished, and he had
contrived to hold the place which at one prodigious leap he had
attained, but he had done no more than hold it; and when Aurelia
had said, "Build me a house, build our castle in the
air&mdash;you've done it once, do it again&mdash;for me," they
had between them designed "Bellflowers" and it had not "come out
right"&mdash;it was not the house of Aurelia's dreams.</p>

<p>She could not talk about this. After ten years it would be
childish to talk of dreams. By then, dreams should have been
interwoven with reality into one shining texture of life. She
never referred to the prize drawings through which they had met.
Never till to-day, when she stood with the portfolio of sketches
before her on the desk and was so delighted and so entranced to
see them that she must speak to him about them, must hope that he
would share this delight and entrancement.</p>

<p>"This is the house," she said confidently; her fine face was
flushed beneath her plumed and shady hat. "Can't you see it,
John? This is our house where we've been together."</p>

<p>"Where we've been together?" he repeated sharply, and his tone
made her feel childish.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," she continued nervously, "the same
house&mdash;the house you drew for the prize ten years ago. Here
are the drafts, they are what I recognised, when I saw them in
the exhibition&mdash;you know what I mean, John,&mdash;don't make
me feel foolish."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I know what you mean," he replied hurriedly;
"you see, this is old stuff, just things I did and tossed
away&mdash;there is nothing in them really."</p>

<p>"But there's everything in them to me," said Aurelia. She
added impulsively and injudiciously: "I like them better than
anything you've done since."</p>

<p>John Bearden began to walk up and down the wide spacious
room.</p>

<p>"That's nonsense," he said, drawing his fine dark brows
together in a sharp frown. "It really is, Aurelia; it's childish.
After ten years of hard work, of successful work&mdash;well, I
think I can say, of brilliant work&mdash;you get hold of some old
sketches that I've hidden away in a bureau and forgotten, and
tell me they're better than anything I've done since."</p>

<p>To her surprise, and almost to her horror, he began in a high
rather shrill voice to run over all the buildings he had erected
since they had been married, almost as if he were justifying
himself&mdash;theatres, town-halls, private houses, official
buildings, bridges&mdash;all successful, all praised, all
admired&mdash;and then, she had to take out these few rough
drawings and extol them above them all...it was stupid, it was
exasperating, she ought not to be so annoying...</p>

<p>"Why, you never <i>will</i> be satisfied, Aurelia. You'd
better give up 'Bellflowers,' you don't like it&mdash;I can't
please you, so let's stop it, let's buy something&mdash;something
old that you can turn about to your taste&mdash;I can't do what
you want, it seems."</p>

<p>Aurelia was silent, her lip quivered, she felt stung to the
soul. Of course, she had been childish and stupid&mdash;it was
above everything foolish to insist on dreams&mdash;she ought to
have seen that he was tired of the house. The name was
futile&mdash;"Bellflowers"&mdash;she did not know why she had
chosen it; it wasn't really the right name, anyhow&mdash;the only
one she could think of...even after all the teasing effort to get
the right name...</p>

<p>And what was the matter with the house? The numerous friends
whom she had taken to see it all declared it "perfect." There was
something wrong in her, not in the building, and she looked
clearly at her husband through eyes that were full of tears, and
a sharp unbidden thought came stealing into her mind&mdash;"My
fault, not his, that our marriage isn't quite a success any more
than 'Bellflowers'&mdash;any more than his career&mdash;there's
something wrong...with me."</p>

<p>This was an extraordinary thought to come into Aurelia's mind,
for until that moment she had believed herself a completely happy
woman. Never to anyone would she have admitted that anything was
wrong, either with her marriage or with her husband's work or
with the house he was building for her&mdash;and now, in a
second, this conviction had come to her, that there was something
wrong with all three, nothing quite had come up to her
expectation&mdash;he had never performed the work which she had
expected after that first extraordinary success, and he had never
been quite the husband that she thought he must be on the
strength of that extraordinary dream meeting in a house which
they had both known, both conceived, which she had kept in her
mind, and he had put on paper...no, never quite that perfect
lover, that perfect companion.</p>

<p>He was tying up the portfolio now, drawing sharply together
the dusty ties, and she felt that the action was somehow brutal,
as if he were shutting away the past, a past that was dear to
her...but which to him had never been dear.</p>

<p>"Why are you doing that, John?" she asked instinctively. "I
really like them, you know&mdash;I'm going to have them for my
own&mdash;to put them in my room&mdash;they give me great
pleasure."</p>

<p>"No," said John Bearden harshly, "I can't endure that. It's
bad enough that you've got that wretched prize drawing there, the
most conspicuous thing in the house&mdash;and every little sketch
I did for it framed."</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" Despite her wish, her voice was sharp and
challenging. "Why not, John, if it gives me pleasure&mdash;the
greatest pleasure I have?"</p>

<p>"After ten years?" he muttered. "Your greatest pleasure?"</p>

<p>"What are years?" asked Aurelia, still on that note of
challenge. "We haven't changed."</p>

<p>"No," he admitted dryly, "we haven't changed&mdash;you're
still living in a dream, and I'm still trying to make that dream
come true...or have given it up, perhaps, as I gave it up from
the first."</p>

<p>"The dreams are true in themselves," she protested, "and
<i>you</i> were dreaming then, when we first met." She took the
portfolio from him and opened it again. "How can you be so rough
with yourself, even if you've changed, John?" Her beautiful voice
was full of tenderness. "Think of yourself then&mdash;that poor
young man&mdash;with so little money and so little hope, sending
in the drawings for that great competition, and getting the
prize, getting fame and money, and if that's any value, John,
getting me, all at once. Haven't you any sympathy with him and
that effort?"</p>

<p>"You talk as if it were another person," muttered Bearden. "I
don't know what we're talking about. I don't want you to have the
sketches&mdash;that ought to be enough, Aurelia it's all castles
in the air."</p>

<p>"No, no," she protested, "not castles in the air&mdash;didn't
we meet?&mdash;aren't we married?" Her words seemed in some way
to unnerve her husband; he made an attempt, awkward for him, for
usually he was most even in his demeanour, to change the
subject.</p>

<p>"What did you want to ask about 'Bellflowers'?" he asked with
an attempt at a smile. "Why did you come up here? Is it so
important?" He tried to speak tenderly, but she shrank away as if
he had used harsh words.</p>

<p>"Never mind about 'Bellflowers.' It's a silly name, isn't it?
That's one thing&mdash;I wanted to change that&mdash;I don't know
why flowers with bells and bells with flowers have always
foolishly fascinated me, of course, but somehow&mdash;no, it's
silly, a pretence, it isn't real."</p>

<p>"And yet you were talking about dreams," he smiled, "and now
you complain about something that isn't real. What is it you
<i>do</i> want, Aurelia?"</p>

<p>"But dreams are real, the dreams are the one reality," she
insisted. "You must see that; but this house isn't a dream, it's
an imitation of a dream&mdash;I don't know, it's all
wrong&mdash;those sketches are all right, and you won't let me
see them."</p>

<p>"A man doesn't want to go backwards," he protested. "I was
only a boy then, almost a child&mdash;those were just rough
stupid attempts&mdash;they're not practical, any of them, wild
designs like illustrations to a fairy tale&mdash;extravagant,
unpractical. I wish you would take more interest in what I am
doing now, Aurelia&mdash;you never really have, you know."</p>

<p>Talk about pretence&mdash;there was pretence there, and now
this grievance was out and growing between them like a tangible
creature.</p>

<p>She made her protest quickly and ineffectively. "But, of
course, I'm interested&mdash;of course I care&mdash;what a stupid
mood we both seem in, just because I admired those old
drawings."</p>

<p>He looked obliquely at the shabby worn portfolio, and said, as
if to himself, "I ought to have destroyed them years ago, but
somehow I never could."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Aurelia.</p>

<p>He took up the portfolio to the Spanish bureau, and his
fingers seemed to shake and be clumsy as he did so, for a small
card fell out of the portfolio on to the floor and Aurelia picked
it up. It was a worn, cheap and faded photograph of a young
man.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" she asked.</p>

<p>John Bearden was carefully returning the portfolio to the
bureau in the corner. He looked over his shoulder and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, that&mdash;that's poor Carstairs, that young Scotsman I
used to share rooms with&mdash;you never met him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Aurelia, "I never met him, and I never saw his
photograph before. Isn't he like Johnny?"</p>

<p>"Like Johnny?" cried Bearden. "What do you mean, Aurelia?"</p>

<p>Johnny was their little boy, their only child. Her remark
seemed most fantastic.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "As soon as I looked at it, I
thought&mdash;how like Johnny, like Johnny will be at his
age&mdash;about how old?&mdash;nineteen, twenty?"</p>

<p>"About that," agreed Bearden sullenly. "You didn't like him?"
she asked, quick to catch his inflection of disinterest.</p>

<p>"Like him? Oh, I don't know, we were great friends&mdash;he
was a queer sort of fellow, a rather raw Scotsman&mdash;he seemed
to have no kith or kin, but just his keenness for art and
architecture, and he wasn't bad either. You remember he was
killed."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered softly, "I remember you told me that and I
didn't care to hear about it. It was really dreadful, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Just a street accident, that's all," said John Bearden
grimly. "I haven't spoken of it for years. How badly it comes
back. I was telephoned for...to go to the hospital. There he was
lying all smashed up&mdash;just knocked down in the street,
hurrying along, with his head full of schemes and plans and
hopes&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't," interrupted Aurelia, "don't!"</p>

<p>"I sat up with him all night," said Bearden, turning towards
the bureau. "Yes, all night, hoping that he would be able to
speak&mdash;they had to give him drugs, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did that," said Aurelia, still looking at the
faded photograph.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have done anything else. I was the only friend he
had in London."</p>

<p>"He was competing for the prize, too, for the drawing of the
castle of the Tyrol, wasn't he?" said Aurelia. "I seem to
remember that."</p>

<p>"Yes, he was competing. He told me to send his drawing in.
Just before he died he came out of his trance or stupor&mdash;God
help us! I don't know whether he knew what he was saying or not,
but he seemed to recognise me, and he said: 'The drawing's
yours&mdash;do what you like with it.'"</p>

<p>"You sent it in, of course?" remarked Aurelia, quickly.</p>

<p>"Of course," answered John Bearden. "Poor fellow, I suppose it
wasn't very good&mdash;I never noticed it. I don't think anyone
else did. It was a very ordinary sort of drawing, I suppose; but
he had taken very great pains with it. He lived for it, for
months, quite sure that he would get the prize."</p>

<p>"The irony of it," sighed Aurelia. "Poor fellow; but he
<i>is</i> like Johnny&mdash;do come and look."</p>

<p>She drew the photograph out, and her husband had to turn and
look at it.</p>

<p>"The same eyes as Johnny, and the same mouth. He was
good-looking, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>She put the photograph down on the desk.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go now&mdash;somehow things have gone wrong this
afternoon. I haven't said what I meant to say&mdash;I am afraid
I've bothered you. I wish you'd let me have the drawings. I
think, you know&mdash;" She paused, and John Bearden asked:</p>

<p>"What do you think, Aurelia?"</p>

<p>"I think that if I'd looked at them long enough I should have
got the name of the house, which isn't 'Bellflowers.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't," cried Bearden suddenly, "don't, Aurelia! You
don't know what you're saying...I don't know what's happening to
us; you had better go home."</p>

<p>"I have disturbed you?" she asked quickly. "You feel
bothered&mdash;worried?"</p>

<p>"I am all right, Aurelia, but you know it wounds me&mdash;what
you said about my work..."</p>

<p>"But I didn't say anything about your work; I don't know what
you mean. Well, I'll go home. I wish that photograph weren't so
like Johnny&mdash;it's uncanny, and you've had it hidden away
there so long. Oh, John, what was his name?"</p>

<p>"Hilary Carstairs," replied Bearden.</p>

<p>"I have thought of the name of the place. It isn't
'Bellflowers,' of course it's 'Little Pomeroy'&mdash;I think that
was the name of an apple&mdash;there were three apple trees of
that kind somewhere in the garden."</p>

<p>"'Little Pomeroy,' that's a stupid name," stammered John
Bearden. "You don't think of very good names, Aurelia. I can't
imagine a house called 'Little Pomeroy.'"</p>

<p>"No, no," she said. "I suppose I'm foolish; but that seemed to
me to be the name. It is stupid, but it's the right name. Well,
I'll see you this evening. Good-bye."</p>

<p>She did not move, though she spoke these words of
leave-taking, but stood gazing at him. He could do no other than
gaze at her. And so they stared at each other, each conscious of
something between them, but only he knew what it was.</p>

<p>She was still the tall, graceful woman&mdash;not beautiful,
but perfect, like a light transfiguring all on which her radiance
fell, with whom he had fallen in love in such an ecstasy...ten
years ago. Finer, and more melancholy, perhaps, but little
changed.</p>

<p>"I'll bring the sketches that you've found," he said with an
effort, "when I've just been through them."</p>

<p>And then she left him, but looking back over her shoulder,
not, he thought, at him, but at that something which had stood
between them and which he knew for what it was, but that she did
not and must never know.</p>

<p>When she had gone, John Bearden set up before him on his
handsome desk that cheap and faded photograph, and then he went
to the bureau and brought out the portfolio which, but a few
moments before, he had carefully locked away. Had she seen what
was written on them, or had she spoken because of some terrible
intuition? He turned over the drawings. No, she could scarcely
have seen, for it was written only on the back, and that in a
small, neat hand&mdash;"Designs for a house to be called
'Pomeroy,' by Hilary Carstairs."</p>

<p>"I ought to have destroyed them with all the others," mused
John Bearden to himself. "I wonder why I didn't," and he turned
them over one by one&mdash;water-colours, pencil drawings,
architectural designs for an extravagant and fantastic house or
palace to be called "Pomeroy." His mind went back ten years to
those dingy rooms which he and this boy, so much younger than
himself, had shared. He could see the bare table and the youth
stooping over it&mdash;the paper, the water-colour, the pencil,
the hard white electric light sweeping down on it all, and the
firm young face frowning with absorption in his work, the
vigorous young figure, the supple young hand&mdash;all came back
to him, not for the first time. Hilary Carstairs had cared for
nothing but his work. He had a passion for architecture, and
above all, a passion for this particular house, this palace in
the mountains among the woods, set in luxurious gardens. It had
haunted him, he had often said, all his short life.</p>

<p>"I've not invented it," he used to say. "I've been there; it's
something I've seen in dreams, of course."</p>

<p>And when the great competition had been announced for a
wealthy man's luxurious palace, Hilary Carstairs had laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>"Why, I could do that, of course," he had cried; "it's my
palace&mdash;my 'castle in the air' come true."</p>

<p>And John Bearden had watched him day by day evolving his
drawings, his plans, his description; while he also, entering
with ardour and with tempestuous ambition into the same
competition, clutching desperately at this same great chance, had
been able to do no more than an able, accomplished design.</p>

<p>The day that Hilary Carstairs had died in the hospital, John
Bearden had gone back to their rooms and looked at the two sets
of designs lying on the work-table side by the side.</p>

<p>"It's yours to do what you like with," the dying boy had said,
and Bearden had rubbed out the signature and put his own in place
of it...coldly, carefully.</p>

<p>He effaced Hilary Carstairs for ever and set John Bearden in
his place. He knew that these drawings showed genius and must
reap the inevitable reward of genius, and that his own showed no
more than painstaking talent, which so often goes unrewarded, and
he sent in Hilary Carstairs' drawings under his own name, and his
own inferior drawings under that of Hilary Carstairs.</p>

<p>No one guessed&mdash;why should anyone? And he had done no
wrong. Of that he again and again solemnly assured
himself&mdash;he had done no wrong. What would youthful fame and
money and Aurelia have been to that poor dead boy? He wanted all
three&mdash;he was alive and avid for all that life could give;
while that poor broken clay&mdash;what did that want with any of
it? And if there was a spirit separate from the clay, what did
that want, either? "Render unto Caesar the things that are
Caesar's," he had quoted to himself. "I am of the world, and want
what the world offers."</p>

<p>And he had taken Hilary Carstairs' fame and money, and
Aurelia, who had come to him through that drawing of the castle
where he said he had walked in dreams. "I wonder if they ever
met," he mused, looking at the faded photograph in front of
him.</p>

<p>"And he is like Johnny&mdash;dreadfully like Johnny."</p>

<p>John Bearden put his worn face in his lean hands. Just now it
had been as if Hilary Carstairs had stood between them&mdash;a
poor definite shade dividing them. He had robbed him, this dead
boy, of everything; but no one had ever known. They had both been
so poor and obscure that there was very little evidence of the
genius of Hilary Carstairs, and what little there had been had
been most carefully and thoughtfully destroyed. All but these
sketches, and from their destruction, through some superstitious
horror, he had refrained, but now they should go. And the
photograph with them&mdash;that photograph with the horrible
grotesque likeness to his son.</p>

<p>How would he feel when Johnny was nineteen, looking at him
with the eager eyes of Hilary Carstairs? Yes, the photograph must
go. He wished he had destroyed it long since, for he had begun to
forget the likeness which he had seen growing day by day in the
child's face. Now he had been reminded of it, so harshly and so
fiercely.</p>

<p>He found himself talking out loud addressing the photograph
and striking his hand on the desk.</p>

<p>"My work," he cried, "I've built it all up by my own efforts;
all has been my own work, and good work, work that has been
highly praised, well paid for; it's been my own life, and my own
wife. I've made Aurelia happy&mdash;not you; you never even saw
her."</p>

<p>Then he paused, frightened at having been provoked into this
passionate speech, and put his nervous fingers to his shuddering
lips.</p>

<p>"I could have succeeded without that chance," he muttered to
himself, "and she'll never know&mdash;never, never. And yet
hadn't she always known that there was just something wrong?
Their life in this work, in the child. I'm losing myself in
fancies. I ought to have lived this down years ago."</p>

<p>He effaced the name from all the drawings, he had torn the
photograph into small pieces. He put all back into the portfolio
and locked it in the bureau. There was no fire in the room, he
must find another means of destruction.</p>

<p>He couldn't go on building for her the house that she wished
to call "Little Pomeroy." He couldn't take those designs home to
her. There was a limit. He must find some excuse&mdash;he would
forget; she would be content with a substitute&mdash;she was well
used to that, was Aurelia; for all her life she had had to be
content with a substitute&mdash;all their life together.</p>

<p>He went home and found her in an amiable and tender mood. She
was sorry for something&mdash;she did not know
what&mdash;something that had happened at his office that
afternoon. She accepted his excuses, cold and dry excuses, about
the drawings. His mood did not seem in any way to annoy or
disturb her. She said that they would call the house
"Bellflowers," and he must finish it as he wished...</p>

<p>"That's the end," thought John Bearden. "I'm free, I shall
never hear any more of it. I've robbed him of everything now,
there's nothing left to take."</p>

<p>In this he was mistaken.</p>

<p>After dinner, Aurelia, who had been musing over an old book,
said:</p>

<p>"Where is that poor young man buried, John? Hilary Carstairs,
I mean. He seems to have been so lonely, I should like to send
some flowers to his grave."</p>

<p>Bitter jealousy shook John Bearden's soul. After all these
years, to be haunted like this. There was still something of
which he could rob Hilary Carstairs. He knew where that neglected
grave was. He had stood beside it when the coffin was lowered
into the yellow clay. He had put a stone over it, out of the
stolen prize-money, and never anything else.</p>

<p>And now Aurelia wanted to go there and put flowers on it. She
knew, of course, she knew! But he would take good care that she
should never know that he knew...</p>

<p>"His people came and took him away," he answered quietly. "I
don't know where&mdash;somewhere in Scotland, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," mused Aurelia quietly, turning over the pages of
her book.</p>

<p>"Sorry for whom?"</p>

<p>John Bearden could not forbear this dangerous remark.</p>

<p>"I don't know," smiled Aurelia, "but I should have liked to
take the flowers, that's all."</p>

<p>"Sorry for whom?" he repeated with deeper nervousness.</p>

<p>"Oh," she replied vaguely, "for all of us, I suppose."</p>
