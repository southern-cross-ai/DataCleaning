<p class="first">"I'M sure," said Camilla, "that I'm not a bit
ungrateful, or cynical, or anything of that
kind&mdash;but&mdash;oh, well!"</p>

<p>"Which means, I suppose," replied Mrs. Battishill, "that you
find life dull, wearisome, boring, tiresome&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no," protested Camilla. "How could I?"</p>

<p>"How, indeed?" responded her friend with just an inflexion of
hardness in her careful voice. "But it is you fortunate people
who do get bored."</p>

<p>"I'm not bored. I'm not, I'm not," said Camilla
vehemently.</p>

<p>"You're ashamed to say it, anyhow," smiled Mrs. Battishill. "I
suppose that is a saving grace. Bored? You've had a fairytale
life. And you've the whole world before you. Think of it, my
dear, the whole world."</p>

<p>"It doesn't mean anything, really," said Camilla quickly.</p>

<p>"It does." The visitor was drawing on her long soft gloves.
"You know it does. But I can quite understand that you are bored.
People like you, who have everything, always are."</p>

<p>Camilla reflected a second, with white wrinkled brows.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want a new sensation," remarked Mrs.
Battishill.</p>

Camilla reflected a second, with white wrinkled brows.<br>
"I suppose you want a new sensation," remarked Mrs.
Battishill.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"There aren't any," smiled Camilla.</p>

<p>To anyone who knew her, it might seem that she was right;
wealth, beauty, culture, luxury, love, all the joys and glories
of the earth, had always been hers. Camilla Attwood was not only
of immensely rich people; she was in herself lovely, gifted,
fascinating and popular. Wherever she went, she "queened it"; her
friends were like a court about her; she had shone and dazzled
through Europe and America; she was both exclusive and popular,
adored by the elect, worshipped by the people.</p>

<p>She was really lovely, the culmination, as it were, of a type;
and she was really clever, not in any superficial manner, or on
merely "smart" lines. She had genuine gifts, and money had been
poured out lavishly on the cultivation of them.</p>

<p>There was very little that she had not done, there were very
few places that she had not seen, very few notable people she had
not met, absolutely no accomplishment that she could not claim
proficiency in; and now she was engaged to Sir Michael
Warrington, an enormously rich banker and a finished cosmopolitan
of admired intellect, pervading charm, and universal
popularity.</p>

<p>As Lady Warrington, her life would be, if possible, even more
delightful, varied, and dominant than it was now. She had chosen
Sir Michael from literally a "crowd" of suitors, and as she had
no reason for consulting anything but her heart in her choice, it
was generally believed that she was extremely happy in her
imposing lover's adoration.</p>

<p>Mrs. Battishill, however, as she rose to take her leave,
wondered. She had known Camilla since she was a baby, and never
before had she seen any hint of this restless boredom, this
dissatisfied melancholy, that Camilla showed now. Oh, just a
faint hint, but there it was.</p>

<p>"You're overwhelmed by the gifts of the gods," smiled Mrs.
Battishill. "Too much has happened to you&mdash;you're only
twenty-five, Camilla!"</p>

<p>"How long that makes the rest of life seem," answered the
girl. "How strange to look ahead and see years and years of
repetition and every year, I suppose, things getting more and
more stale."</p>

<p>"What a horrible way of looking at it!" exclaimed the elder
woman. "I don't want to throw truisms at you&mdash;but
really!"</p>

<p>"I know," smiled Camilla. "Count my blessings and all
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It would take you a long time to count them," said Mrs.
Battishill dryly.</p>

<p>Camilla, pulling at a chain slung with diamonds, Sir Michael's
last gift, looked, up earnestly; the fire-glow was vivid over her
slimness and the gold and violet cushions behind her in the satin
chair.</p>

<p>"This is what frightens me," she said seriously. "I don't see
what can happen&mdash;that hasn't happened before&mdash;one knows
life so well, every turn of it; one knows people, one knows
places&mdash;it's awful, I know. Why should we crave for
something fresh? Yet <i>we do</i>."</p>

<p>"She's not in love!" thought Mrs. Battishill. "Poor Sir
Michael!"</p>

<p>Aloud she said:</p>

<p>"It seems to me there is a novelty every day, in
everything&mdash;from religions to chocolates&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's only the old flavours, the old dogmas turned about a
bit," said Camilla quickly. "One is so tired of
sampling&mdash;new religions and new chocolates!"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mrs. Battishill, "you don't know what you
want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing. This is idle talk. I'm tired, I think. Oh,
I don't know! I''m going down to Kitty Groves' to-night&mdash;and
then&mdash;oh, I'm sick of London&mdash;the Riviera, I think. I
like to break up seasons; the old round becomes like, a
treadmill."</p>

<p>She was to be married in the spring, and this was late autumn.
Mrs. Battishill wondered if she looked on the future as a
"treadmill."</p>

<p>"Well, Camilla," she said, kissing her blooming cheeks, "keep
up your courage&mdash;any day you may come upon something really
new. There's the old tag, you know: 'There are more things in
heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your
philosophy.' You might find one of them yet!"</p>

<p>Camilla smiled, in rather a listless fashion.</p>

<p><br>Kitty Groves had a queer little place in Sussex. She was
there only for a few weeks in the year. It was near some rather
famous golf-links, and the beautiful sea air was particularly
soothing to Kitty's famous "nerves." She had a few people with
her now, all come either for the golf or their nerves, except
Camilla Attwood, who was there with rather the air of an
incognita princess, weary of homage and festival.</p>

<p>She caused a certain amount of awe even among this choice
gathering of witty, worldly people.</p>

<p>Her beauty, her fame and her wealth made her delicately
overwhelming.</p>

<p>Wherever she went there was a slight atmosphere of
withdrawal.</p>

<p>Camilla was scarcely aware of this, she was so used to it. She
felt lonely, and this gave a slight haughtiness to her
accomplished manners. She tried to write a long letter to Sir
Michael, then in Paris on some very portentous business; but her
efforts all disgusted her, and one by one were torn up and cast
into her bedroom fire.</p>

<p>"Of course she's too wonderful," sighed Kitty Groves. "How Sir
Michael ever had the courage&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was early October and a wet and windy season.</p>

<p>From her window Camilla could see five miles across the marsh
to the sea, when the scudding rain and wind-driven mist lifted.
This blue line of ocean with the faint shapes of ships gave her a
faint pang of homesickness, an absurd feeling, she considered,
since she had gazed unmoved on many fairer, more strange aspects
of the ocean than the wistful homely view across the Sussex
marsh.</p>

<p>There came one perfect day that seemed washed in liquid gold.
There was a chill in the glorious air, but it was fresh and
exquisite; the azure heavens were filled with swift clouds, full
of colour, shot with sunshine; there were a few stinging showers,
and in the afternoon a great rainbow.</p>

<p>Kitty Groves' "cottage" was really an old Tudor farm-house
most carefully and extensively "restored" and fitted up like a
luxurious little toy.</p>

<p>On the close-shaven lawn to-day the wind-flung apples lay
round and red, glistening from the rain, and long yellow leaves
from the cherry trees scattered over the still bright grass.</p>

<p>Camilla stood on the wet brick path and watched the piled-up
clouds that raced across the beautiful expanse of sky.</p>

<p>And again something caught at the heart as it had when she
looked at those dim distant sails.</p>

<p>Kitty Groves had lamented "the horrible weather." Camilla
somehow was rejoicing in it.</p>

<p>The artless but costly garden ran down to the sloping pastures
that ran down to the marsh and was divided from these by a mere
hawthorn hedge now vivid with scarlet berries.</p>

<p>Several of Kitty's guests were wandering idly here looking at
a new lead statue that had been set up in a lily pond; they had
just motored back from the links and were waiting for tea.</p>

<p>A man came across the fields, leant over the hedge and spoke
to them.</p>

<p>"I've lost a sheep," he said. "Have you seen a stray
sheep?"</p>

<p>They told him, civil and slightly amused, that they had
not.</p>

<p>Camilla heard the question and the reply; she lowered her gaze
from the mighty clouds, and came slowly towards the hedge of
thorn trees.</p>

<p>She looked at the farmer, who lingered, as if at a loss, and
she had the impression of a tall, heavy man, red, gold and brown,
lit by the flecks of shifting sunlight and somehow the colour of
the warm, rich marsh landscape.</p>

<p>"You've lost a sheep?" she asked, humouring him.</p>

<p>She could not help it that she felt that she was conferring a
vast favour on him by merely speaking to him, nor that her
sweetness covered a boundless pride; she was Camilla Attwood and
used to her courtiers.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the farmer.</p>

<p>Camilla caught the flying end of her flame-coloured silk
scarf; the wind was up and blowing in an exhilarating
fashion.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said&mdash;she smiled in a deliberately
dazzling fashion. "I suppose it has strayed&mdash;that is what
sheep do, don't they?"</p>

<p>She felt that he ought to be absolutely amazed by her
graciousness; however condescending queens may deign to be, they
like to have the fact noticed.</p>

<p>But this young man merely glanced at Camilla and away again in
the most indifferent fashion she had ever been fronted with.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to have disturbed you," he said. "I thought it
might have wandered into your garden."</p>

<p>He lifted his rough cap and turned away. The wind was blowing
away from Camilla; she loosened the flame-coloured wisp of silk;
it flew out of her hand and was hurled against his arm.</p>

<p>He had to bring it back to her; he wasn't a rustic, as she had
noted.</p>

<p>As she took it from him she again smiled vividly.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll find the sheep. How do you know you've lost
one?" she added with an infantile air of melting sweetness.</p>

<p>Without the least flicker of a smile he replied</p>

<p>"I come every day and count them."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Camilla.</p>

<p>She took in with her lovely practised glance his broad
shoulders, deep chest and red hands; he was a new type to her.
She had known athletes, sportsmen, nothing so rough and crude as
this; yet he was, in the old much-abused term, "a gentleman."</p>

<p>"I should like to help you find the sheep," said Camilla, who
was used to having her lightest caprices not only indulged but
taken seriously.</p>

<p>Now the stranger did laugh, in the shortest, most vexatious
fashion.</p>

<p>"It would be hardly a job for you," he answered, and lifted
his cap again and turned away, the eager ragged blue sheep-dog at
his heels.</p>

<p>Now Camilla prided herself, among many other things, on not
being silly or effeminate or in any way the "fluffy" type.</p>

<p>Though she was neither athletic nor "mannish" in her tastes or
pursuits, still she was a fine horsewoman, fencer, swimmer, and
she had often deliberately undertaken adventures, camping out,
roughing it, and so on, and she was most workmanlike in her
clothes.</p>

<p>Therefore the young man's obvious contempt was peculiarly
annoying to Camilla.</p>

<p>"As if I was a chorus girl in high heels and a satin frock,"
she thought indignantly.</p>

<p>The wind blew fiercely in a mad race towards the sea; the long
yellow leaves were whirled off the cherry tree; round and red and
glistening the apples lay on the vivid wet green lawn.</p>

<p>A big blue wain drawn by big brown horses and piled high with
straw went by.</p>

<p>There was a smell of burning weeds and a thin veil of bluish
smoke tossed on the speeding wind.</p>

<p>A few yet unfurled roses drooped on the bare bushes, sodden,
brown at the tips, never to bloom now.</p>

<p>Camilla went into the house and gloomed over her tea.</p>

<p>The little house, so pretentiously "rustic," so carefully
"restored," so altogether "artistic" and "picturesque," the
ostentatious luxuries of service, food, and every possible modern
device, seemed to her paltry. Kitty Groves, she thought wearily,
had always been the kind of fool to imitate other fools.</p>

<p>By the time tea was finished, the electric lights, disguised
as lanterns, and candles were diffusing their becoming rosy
glow.</p>

<p>Camilla reflected on all the plans proposed for her
amusement.</p>

<p>She went upstairs, put on her warmest coat, her closest
motoring cap, her stoutest brogues, watched her opportunity and
quietly ran down the garden, opened the little gate in the thorn
hedge and hastened across the field.</p>

<p>It was raining now and nearly dark; the wind blew
intermittently. In the constant big rifts of the scudding clouds
the mounting moon showed in the first quarter, sailing in a mist
of pallid silver stained with a faint red like old, washed-out
blood.</p>

<p>Camilla stood still a moment on the little upland.</p>

<p>She enjoyed the chill wind rushing past her, the sense of
space, of immensity, the silence, the sting of the rain, the vast
space of moving cloud above her, that dead light of the ancient
moon.</p>

<p>She walked on, down the field that sloped to the marsh. The
pasture grass was thick and wet about her ankles; she soon had to
climb a fence that was surrounded with clay-like mud.</p>

<p>Across another field more steeply sloping and then a belt of
wood crossed her way.</p>

<p>This was broken by a little stream, crossed by a few planks
with a stile at either end.</p>

<p>Camilla paused.</p>

<p>She could smell the rather rank odours of the soaked
undergrowth and rotting leaves, and hear the drip of the
raindrops in the wood that had a steady ordered sound, like the
prelude to stately music.</p>

<p>Overhead a flight of rooks went past, cawing on their homeward
way.</p>

<p>Camilla could hear the noise of their wings. She climbed the
stile, crossed the bridge, and by the other stile paused.</p>

<p>In front of her was another open field, bordered all along the
right side by the little wood, on the left rising up like a
humped shoulder, clear against the cloudy heavens, and then
running straight down to the sheer flatness of the marsh.</p>

<p>Crossing this uplifted line of the field was the man of this
afternoon's adventure&mdash;thus Camilla called those few words
with the farmer&mdash;an emotional adventure, she would have
defined it, because of the type of the man, and his rudeness and
the "queerness" of the whole little incident.</p>

<p>And of course the queerest part of the whole thing was that
she, Camilla Attwood, should have taken any interest at all in so
absolutely trivial an affair.</p>

<p>"Have you found the lost sheep?" she called.</p>

<p>Her voice sounded clear and sweet in the lonely twilight.</p>

<p>He turned quickly, amazed she was sure, and that he should be
amazed, amused and pleased her.</p>

<p>Yet he answered as if she had been a farm boy who was
questioning him.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;she must have got on the marsh," he said
shortly.</p>

<p>"Are you going on the marsh?" Her voice was blown to him.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'd like to come too."</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>She laughed, swaying with the wind that was buffeting her
whole body towards the sea.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'm bored indoors. I've never been really on the
marsh."</p>

<p>She had crossed the cold wet field to where he stood, pausing,
hesitant.</p>

<p>Camilla was almost afraid that he was going to say something
about long-defunct conventions.</p>

<p>Would she have to remind the man that women did exactly as
they liked nowadays? And that such a woman as she was, always did
as she liked in any age, and under any conditions?</p>

<p>But he gave her no opportunity of any such remarks.</p>

<p>"All right, come along," he said. Camilla was swiftly
elated.</p>

<p>Here at least was something new in her experience&mdash;the
man, the place, the time, all had a tang, a freshness, invaluable
to Camilla.</p>

<p>Side by side the man and woman tramped down the field.</p>

<p>It was quite queer enough to satisfy even Camilla Attwood's
most wayward fancy, as marvellous to her as the loaf of home-made
bread was to the king in the fairy-tale, who was gorged with rich
dainties.</p>

<p>Her companion seemed to accept her as a matter of course, with
no sense of amaze, honour, or excitement.</p>

<p>Never had she been taken quite so much for granted as by this
casual stranger.</p>

<p>She wondered if he had <i>looked </i>at her; it was too dark
now even if he had turned to look at her, which he did not.</p>

<p>The wind was veering wildly; the clouds were clotting closer
over the stars; the moon struggled through these high embanking
vapours only occasionally.</p>

<p>The dark was falling rapidly, closing in, it seemed to
Camilla, shutting out earth and sky, isolating her with her
companion.</p>

<p>"There's a gale coming up and it will soon be dark," he said.
"You had really better go back."</p>

<p>"I'm enjoying it," she answered, bent to the wind that now was
rushing up from the sea. "I don't bother you, do I? My name's
Camilla Attwood."</p>

<p>He did not show any interest in her famous name. She was
rather piqued at that; she had never known it not produce an
effect before. There was piquancy in the experience.</p>

<p>"My name's George Lorimer&mdash;and if you don't mind not
being conventional, it doesn't trouble me," he replied
casually.</p>

<p>Camilla pounced on his words.</p>

<p>"My dear man," she said sweetly, "where do you come from? Do
you really think that such a thing as conventionality exists any
longer?"</p>

<p>"I believe in it&mdash;for women," he answered shortly.</p>

<p>"How nice of you to be so rude," smiled Camilla. "It fits in
with the novelty of the whole thing. I really believe I've
shocked you. Isn't that delicious? I've always lived with people
you couldn't shock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said indifferently.</p>

<p>They were nearly on the marsh now, and Camilla had a struggle
to keep her feet. The wind was simply buffeting against the
cliff; the volume of the rain was increasing, and the icy slash
of it against her face was blinding and deafening.</p>

<p>Also she had already found that the garments that had seemed
so trustworthy were not meant for this kind of work; the gorgeous
motor-coat was uncomfortably clinging and twisting, the wet was
squelching in round the tops of her shoes, her skirts impeded
her. She wished that she was in the breeches and leathern jerkin
she had often worn as Rosalind, her favourite amateur actress
part; she maliciously wished her companion had seen her in that
kit.</p>

<p>"The marsh is half under water," he said suddenly. "You had
really better go back."</p>

<p>"No," said Camilla.</p>

<p>"You really ought to."</p>

<p>"I've never done the things that I really ought to&mdash;on
principle. You're refreshingly old-fashioned, aren't you?"</p>

<p>She lightly climbed the last fence that divided them from the
great stretch of marsh.</p>

<p>"Where is the sheep likely to be?" she asked in matter-of-fact
tones.</p>

<p>"It may have got into one of the dykes. I've been all over
Hither Marsh and didn't find it.</p>

<p>"Is it valuable?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So this is pure humanitarianism?" smiled Camilla.</p>

<p>"I should call it doing one's job."</p>

<p>They were tramping across the marsh towards the first
dyke.</p>

<p>"Have you got a farm near here?" asked Camilla.</p>

<p>"Oh, a little place."</p>

<p>"You do all this sort of thing yourself always?"</p>

<p>"I do my job," he repeated, as if she amused him. "I suppose
you never had one?" he added.</p>

<p>"I have done everything there is to do!" laughed Camilla.</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>He was not to be drawn into as much as a glance at her. They
were down on the marsh's lowest level now, battling against the
wind and rain, their feet sinking into the spongy ground.</p>

<p>Camilla's coat was torn, her skirts were draggled, her cap was
becoming plastered to her head, hair and veil were twisted in wet
strands behind her.</p>

<p>"Listen," said the farmer brusquely.</p>

<p>Camilla paused, breathing hard from the struggling effort of
her progress.</p>

<p>Through the bleak, stormy twilight came a faint distressful
cry.</p>

<p>This sound gave Camilla a sharp thrill; without a word she
trudged behind George, Lorimer as he plunged forward in the
direction of the plaintive sound.</p>

<p>When they reached the steep sides of the first dyke it was
still light enough to see the dim white shape at the bottom, amid
the harsh reeds, struggling piteously.</p>

<p>Camilla stood at a loss; she really did not know what to do to
help, though she wanted to help more than she had ever wanted to
do anything.</p>

<p>She made an instinctive plunge forward, but he put her back
with a decision that showed his strength of wrist, and himself
scrambled down the wet bank.</p>

<p>He got the sheep without much difficulty, but the animal was
heavy, frightened and awkward, and there was one moment when it
seemed likely to slip back again. Then Camilla had her chance;
she eagerly knelt down and clutched the wet wool and dragged at
the struggling body, while the man heaved the creature up from
below.</p>

<p>When the sheep was at last pulled and pushed on to the bank,
where it flung itself down, quivering with exhaustion, the two
rescuers stood panting either side, with torn clothing, mud to
the waist, dishevelled and violently buffeted by the great slaps
of the icy north-easter.</p>

<p>Camilla remembered Mrs. Battishill&mdash;"There are more
things..." that lady had quoted&mdash;and Camilla now admitted
that she was right. How undreamed of such a thing as this had
been only yesterday!</p>

<p>Her whole being thrilled and tingled as it had never thrilled
or tingled before&mdash;the wind, the rain, the racing clouds
overhead, the moon so high above her, the vast loneliness of sky
and marsh, the sense of real fatigue and exertion, and at her
feet the panting live thing she had helped to save from
death...and, as it were, crowning and completing all, the
presence of the man, engaged in man's work, conveying, in his
indifferent simplicity, strength, resource and fearlessness.</p>

<p>"I shall have to see you home now," remarked the farmer.</p>

<p>"Do you mean me or the sheep?" asked Camilla.</p>

<p>"Both of you."</p>

<p>"I could find my way," said Camilla.</p>

<p>"Could you? You've come farther than you know&mdash;the marsh
is dangerous too."</p>

<p>"You've got to look after this poor beast first," she
answered.</p>

<p>He had already gently put the animal on its feet and felt its
limbs carefully.</p>

<p>"No bones broken&mdash;she'll do&mdash;good thing I found her
before it got dark; she would have been dead by the morning."</p>

<p>Camilla meekly followed him, this time along the edge of the
dyke. They went slowly, he driving the sheep, and by the time
they had reached the road it was quite dark save for the fitful,
pallid gleams of the moon.</p>

<p>Mr. Lorimer began to talk now, quite cheerfully and
indifferently, about commonplace objects, and Camilla understood
that he had been silent before not out of embarrassment at her
company, but because of anxiety about his lost animal.</p>

<p>Camilla was still young enough to remember fairy-tales
vividly, and presently they came upon a cottage that at once
reminded her of a fairy-tale. It stood back from the road by just
the space of a little garden and the vague moonbeams showed the
shape of it; every window was uncurtained and glowed a yellow
square of warm light. In one of the downstair rooms stood a table
laid with a white cloth; there were the hearty flicker of a great
fire, the gleam of pots and pans on the walls, a clean old woman
moving about, and the savoury smell of cooking floating into the
wet night. The farmer opened a gate in the hedge near the house
and turned the sheep in.</p>

<p>"Is this your house?" asked Camilla eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"May I come in? Do give me some supper."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is like a new toy to you, Miss Attwood."</p>

<p>His tone made Camilla say:</p>

<p>"You do know who I am?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;may I come in?"</p>

<p>"It is hardly worth while&mdash;it's such an awfully poor
show. And Mrs. Martin would be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;shocked?" finished Camilla.</p>

<p>"You'd like to see her&mdash;as a curiosity?" he asked.</p>

<p>Camilla, battling against the wind, made a sudden pause by the
dripping gate and glossy privet hedge.</p>

<p>"Please let me come in," she said.</p>

<p>The big man answered with pleasant indifference:</p>

<p>"I really think you've had the full flavour out of this
adventure, Miss Attwood&mdash;it ends here."</p>

<p>It was the first favour she had ever asked anyone and she had
been refused; her mind spun a little. She was about to reply, and
without her usual poise, when they were both blinded by the white
headlights of an oncoming car that was ripping out along the wet
road; the heavy throb of powerful engines rose above the
storm.</p>

<p>Camilla felt her arm clutched; she was pulled aside as the car
stopped with a groan of protesting brakes.</p>

<p>The man driving stared into the pool of white light made by
his own lamps.</p>

<p>"I say, can you tell me the way?" he began; then his glance
fell on the dishevelled muddy girl behind the dishevelled muddy
man. "Camilla!" he cried in sheer amaze.</p>

<p>Camilla smiled wanly; it was Sir Michael Warrington.</p>

<p>"You can take me home, Michael," she said. "Good night, Mr.
Lorimer. I hope the sheep will be all right."</p>

"You can take me home, Michael," she said. "Good<br>
night, Mr. Lorimer. I hope the sheep will be all right."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Sir Michael sprang from his car, a slight figure in leather
and goggles.</p>

<p>"I got away sooner than I thought," he stammered. "I've driven
up from Dover&mdash;crossed to-day&mdash;thought I'd look you up
at Kitty's."</p>

<p>Camilla stepped into the luxurious car. George Lorimer had
already disappeared inside his own gate. She noticed a curtain
being drawn over the window of the front room, shutting out the
prospect of the cosy firelight and homely supper.</p>

<p>She was wet, her teeth were chattering, the water was
streaming down her face, her clothes were muddy and torn; in her
ears was the rush of the wind, before her eyes the moon swinging
in the vast cloudy heavens&mdash;"There are more things..."</p>

<p>Lifting the speaking tube, she gave Sir Michael directions to
Kitty Groves' toy house. When they reached it and he assisted her
out, she looked at him as if he was a stranger; he seemed somehow
wizened and mean and paltry.</p>

<p>And he on his side was plainly vexed and disturbed.</p>

<p>As they walked up the wet brick path he said:</p>

<p>"I don't like escapades, Camilla. I always thought that so
wonderful about you&mdash;you were so modern, but
so&mdash;so&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he hesitated for a word, she supplied it:</p>

<p>"Safe?&mdash;Conventional?"</p>

<p>She did not wait for his answer but ran upstairs and stripped
off her wet coat and cap and laughed at herself in the
mirror.</p>

<p>It was really very late; she had been gone quite a long time.
Sir Michael was perhaps justified at the anger he showed at her
indifference to his rebukes as she sat, radiant and lovely, in
Venetian blue chiffon, before the blazing log-fire in the little
music-room discreetly abandoned to them.</p>

<p>Camilla was not angry. She merely said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Michael."</p>

<p>And her engagement ended with the interview.</p>

<p>The next morning when the storm was over and the sun shining
into ruddy autumn clearness the great banker took his leave of
Kitty Groves. Before he went he had another brief interview with
Camilla.</p>

<p>He informed her, not without the malice of a bitterly wounded
man, of his private information of a financial disaster abroad
that would involve nearly her whole fortune; her father would
remain a comparatively wealthy man, but she would be
penniless.</p>

<p>"That means, if you don't marry me, that you must give up
everything you care for," he finished grimly.</p>

<p>Camilla did not answer; she looked radiant.</p>

<p>"You've lost everything," he repeated angrily. "I came over to
tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That it didn't make any difference?" smiled Camilla. "That's
good of you, Michael&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You seem pleased," he frowned, puzzled.</p>

<p>"I am," said Camilla.</p>

<p>She stood still, smiling, while he continued to press on her
the dreary recital of her misfortunes. He had always known these
fantastic foreign investments of hers would go wrong; a big
concern had gone simply smash&mdash;of course "penniless" was a
figure of speech&mdash;but doubtless she had debts, and her
father had got her brothers to think of&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wanted to break it to you myself," he finished, "but last
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I made you angry," agreed Camilla.</p>

<p>He faced her squarely.</p>

<p>"Look here, Camilla, hadn't you better think it over a
bit?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"What has happened to you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You couldn't guess, you couldn't understand," smiled Camilla.
"You know, there <i>are</i> more things in heaven and
earth..."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Sir Michael's swift little car ripped away
along the London road.</p>

<p>Camilla put on her plainest cloak and went out to find the
cottage of last night.</p>

<p>The sun was unclouded, the thinnest, clearest gold overlaid
the rich tinted landscape.</p>

<p>The big man was in the cottage garden, tying up big heads of
dahlias and Michaelmas daisies that last night's rain had blown
down.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Camilla, leaning over the gate. "How is
the sheep?"</p>

<p>He looked at her, standing with the sheaf of flowers in his
hands.</p>

<p>And then they both laughed.</p>

<p>"Please, may I come in?" said Camilla meekly. "I'm very good
now. I've lost all my money and I've sent away Sir
Michael&mdash;and, please, I'm not quite spoilt. I can cook and
sew and garden&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked in a queer voice.</p>

<p>They gazed at each other with dancing eyes.</p>

<p>"You knew I'd come back," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that was why I was tidying up&mdash;"</p>

<p>He came down the path and opened the gate.</p>

<p>"It is like a fairy-tale," whispered Camilla.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a fairy-tale," said the big man. "You
darling!"</p>
