<p class="first">
<i>A story of one of the world's most remarkable men. One who
was envied and praised by two kings and an Emperor for his great
gifts, but who, in his heroic end, found himself without a country
or hope, and being thus desperate, collected all his old soldiers
and mercenaries and marched against Rome. Duke Charles of Bourbon,
Constable of France, was so extraordinary a man that it is
surprising how few are the novels about him. Miss Bowen, who knows
all the by-ways of history and can put them before her readers with
such remarkable force, has in "Trumpets at Rome" produced a
memorable work.</i></p>

<p><i>Among the characters appearing throughout the novel are the
beautiful Louise of Savoy, King François I of France, the
Emperor Charles V, and many other famous personages. It is a story
of magnificence, courage, and ambition, and apart from historical
interest can stand on its own merits as a moving and splendid
narrative.</i></p>

<p class="verse">Though these whispers stir and trouble<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Like a bright, unfinished dream,<br>
They are as lost as the spent bubble<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At the verge of the shallow stream;<br>
From dead lips these lost echoes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have died in the listening ear,<br>
Lost is the last of the echoes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That only the dead can hear.<br>
<br>
But I in that quiet listening<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes to a brooding mind<br>
At eve, when the marsh flares glistening<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show where the false tracks wind,<br>
Think that I hear these echoes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I peer through my window pane<br>
At the ghosts that follow the echoes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dusk, the swamp and the rain.</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>ONE.<br>
Infernal Masquerade.<br>
Winter 1515.</h2>
<br>

<p class="verse">The traveller mused above the gates of Rome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallen, amber gates of Rome,<br>
He saw the fallen Panes, the thorny briars,<br>
He drank the chilled Lethe foam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amber, dreadful foam<br>
From out the agate cup where rising fires<br>
Of stars that rose above the ilex leaves<br>
Glittered through the enchanted wine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bitter, soothing wine,<br>
The wine that brings oblivion with the lees.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
A YOUNG man was hastening with a buoyant step and an air of
expectancy up the Palatine Hill at the hour of a tranquil, warm
dawn.</p>

<p>It was December; but there was no touch of winter in the balmy
atmosphere, and among the heavy blocks of marble that strewed his
way were tufts of freshly budding grasses, and beneath the boulders
of tawny stone deep-pink cyclamen and densely blue violets showed
in knots of dark colour.</p>

<p>The traveller now and then glanced backwards at the view of the
Imperial and Holy City that he saw beneath him; but he did not stay
his steps, and walking with trained brace soon gained the summit of
the Roman hill, where, amid the scattered ruins of ancient temples,
were groves of ilex, palm, and laurel trees among the white
façades of convents and monasteries and fair, delicate
churches with bell-towers of red brick beside them.</p>

<p>When he had gained what he considered the highest point, he
turned deliberately and seated himself upon a block of fallen
masonry, round which grew a coronal of sweet briar, and, folding
his arms on his breast, gazed down at the great city.</p>

<p>He was about five-and-twenty years of age, tall, fair, with
spare, athletic limbs; he was dressed with the greatest possible
precision and care&mdash;the garments and colours of them being
balanced one against the other; his cloak was of a dark violet
colour, lined with black, the hood was quilted, fastened by a clasp
of very pale gold, his doublet and breeches were of white wool, his
boots were of finely tanned skin, his gloves were embroidered with
a monogram worked in gold thread; he wore in his belt a short
dagger with a crystal handle, and a reliquary, enclosed in a small
case also of rock crystal enfoiled with gold, hung at his neck; his
hair was brushed into a black net.</p>

<p>The scene at which he gazed with enthusiastic interest might
have been taken to be that of the crown of the world, for he looked
down on Rome&mdash;the Rome of the Caesars and the
Pontiffs&mdash;lying serene in the pallid gold of the early
morning.</p>

<p>The penetrating and concentrated glance of the traveller's keen
eyes could see the entire irregular circle of the thick walls, now
rising, now sinking, there broken, there repaired&mdash;the walls
of Rome, in some places mouldered to a heap of bricks and rubble,
in other places still strong enough to defy an invader, and
everywhere tufted with small ferns, grasses, and budding wild pinks
and wallflowers.</p>

<p>The ancient city had shrunk in its ancient bulwarks; the walls
did not enclose streets and houses only, but vineyards, where the
vines were cultivated on artificial terraces, pastures where goats
and cows wandered among sweet grasses broken by the half-buried
acanthus-crowned columns of a temple, groves which had a sacred air
and where deserted altars still stood in the myrtle shades, rich
gardens laid out with alabaster fountains, dusky grottoes and
painted summer-houses. In between were stretches of undergrowth,
bramble, wild rose, and ferns, out of which sprang the smooth boles
and the dark foliage of ilex and laurel; hard, glossy trails of ivy
and the lighter garlands of the eglantine hung over the massy
outlines of the classical ruins which were stained by the suns of
centuries into hues of dusky gold and honeyed yellow.</p>

<p>As the young man gazed, entirely absorbed in the spectacle, the
rising sun shot long brilliant rays across a heaven of pellucid
azure, and flocks of pigeons and doves, as if obeying a signal,
rose from amidst the whispering creepers of the golden ruins and
raised their blue and purple plumes into the pure upper air.</p>

<p>This was the first time that the stranger had looked upon Rome.
He had received a severe education, was a tolerable Latinist, and
amused himself by trying to name the different parts of the city
below him. He wished to trace the outline of the <i>Via Sacra</i>,
but could not find it; that strip of marsh covered with stunted
shrubs, above which a few groups of elegant, broken pillars still
rose, was, he thought, the Forum.</p>

<p>He frowned at the neglected desolation of this spot; it looked
as if it were used for a cattle-market: there Were the wattle pens
beneath the shattered marble shafts and trampled filth along what
might have been, he supposed, the Via Sacra. Behind this, clearly
outlined in the strengthening sun, was the superb magnificence of
what the stranger believed to be the Flavian amphitheatre.
Everywhere were remains of the ancient world: on the hill that he
had climbed, amid the new convents and churches, amid the
pasturages and vineyards; on those other hills that he could see,
the Coelian and the Aventine, where the neglected pagan temples
showed through the thick woods of dark pine, cedar, oak, and ilex,
the huge modern fortress on the Capitol was standing on foundations
laid down when Rome was at the height of her heathen pride.</p>

<p>Beside the Capitol a bleak cliff was outlined sharply against
the thin air; white-bearded goats were climbing on it, balancing in
the clefts and ridges and snatching at the small tufts of grass it
bore: the Tarpeian Rock. The young man smiled with that sharp
mingling of pleasure and disillusionment that comes from beholding
a famous object for the first time.</p>

<p>He was partly pleased to recognize these famous places so well
known to him from books, and partly disappointed to see how they
had been changed and in some cases desecrated by modern needs,
ambitions, and greeds. He had taken, the day before, a severe
delight in wandering over Rome by himself; in passing in and out of
the huddled and filthy streets between the Capitol and the thick
yellow river, which ran so rapidly through the city; in walking
through Trastevere, where the glittering coloured-marble basilicas
and palaces rose out of narrow, dark alleys packed close with
small, dirty houses, many of which overhung the polluted waters of
the Tiber and could be reached only by boat.</p>

<p>He had been, this eager and inquisitive stranger, through the
new Papal quarter of the Vatican, which the Borgia Pontiff, not
long since dead, had greatly improved and strengthened, by
beautifying the façades, raising a tower, and casting out a
bridge from the Papal residence to the enormous castle of Sant'
Angelo, which seemed impregnable&mdash;that massive fortress
crowned with a glittering angel, which had been built on the tomb
of the Emperor Hadrian.</p>

<p>The young man had entered the ancient Basilica and had
discovered that, behind the brilliant pretence of the new
façade, it was but a ruin, which had half fallen down and
half been purposely demolished. Workmen's huts and scaffolding
poles were about the walls of the first church in Christendom,
whilst amidst the trampled mud lay split columns of marble,
alabaster, and stone, which the straining oxen had dragged with
infinite toil from despoiled temples and palaces of the Ancient
World.</p>

<p>The stranger had turned his errant steps towards San Giovanni
Laterano, where the first Christian Emperor, Constantine, had been
baptized, and which was the Mother and Head of all the churches in
Christendom.</p>

<p>He brought his mind back from yesterday's wandering he had found
his rest in a place that was very strange to him, a humble
<i>osteria</i> where he had slept on hay and eaten black bread and
winter apples for his breakfast; and where he had had great
difficulty in procuring the ewer of fresh water and the finely
laundered white linen napkins that were to him a necessity. He had
had to pay gold at last and they had gone out and bought the linen
and the <i>acqua dolce</i>. Laughingly they had told him, as far as
he could understand their tongue, to be careful how he showed his
money or was so lavish with his gold; and they had looked, half
mocking, half good-humoured, at the ornaments at his throat and on
the backs of his gloves.</p>

<p>The flight of pigeons and doves, with glittering breasts and
sharp-cut wings, filled the blue air with movement. Pure and thin
the violet wood-smoke mounted above the huddled roof-tops, and the
scent of small green plants, growing amid the fallen stones about
him, seemed to sting his nostrils with the intense perfume of
Weeds. The bells from the different towers began to peal, suddenly,
harshly, as if the harmonious pattern of the early morning were
broken. The young man could see some of the bronze bells moving
from side to side in their latticed turrets. The pigeons, startled,
sped higher into the heavens, until they might have been a flight
of angels, flashing purple wings, returning to Paradise.</p>

<p>The young man heard a tinkle behind him and turned his head. An
old bent fellow in a girdled, drab-coloured smock, who seemed a
beggar or Anchorite, was guiding a small herd of goats along the
crest of the hill&mdash;or so it seemed to the stranger. The old
man was walking slowly, leaning on his staff, and the beasts,
handsome with their rough white coats, pink faces, slant eyes, and
shining horns, were following him patiently.</p>

<p>The traveller walked slowly over to the old man, who was making
but tedious progress across the rough ground.</p>

<p>Carefully picking his words and using an admixture of Italian
and Latin, in a French accent the young man asked if he might rest
in the goat-herd's cottage or farm and study at his ease the noble
prospect of Rome which was to him so odd and inspiring.</p>

<p>The other looked the traveller over quickly; his small, deep-set
eyes were sparkling with good humour and intelligence; his brown
features were twisted like those of a mask in a grotto.</p>

<p>"They are not my goats. They follow me because sometimes I give
them a morsel of salt to lick. It amuses me, too, to attach a
little bell to my staff&mdash;they will come after that, you know.
This is very early for travellers to be on Monte Palatino," he
added with a civil curiosity. "Naturally, everybody comes to Rome
sooner or later, but they don't usually come up as high as this so
early in the morning."</p>

<p>"I have very little time. I am with the French King at Bologna;
you know that he has come there to meet the Pope? Eh, well, there
is so much feasting, pageantry, play-acting, and church ceremony
there that I had a mind to get away from it all for a little and to
See Rome for myself, as I have seen it."</p>

<p>"Though I have neither cottage nor farm," said the old man, who
appeared extremely interested in the stranger, "you may, if you
will, come to my hut. I am what they call a hermit; that is, I do
nothing, observe my fellows, and, when anyone comes near me, appear
to be communing with heaven."</p>

<p>"I see you do not hesitate to give away the secret of your trade
to me."</p>

<p>"It is only," replied the hermit with great simplicity, "the
peasants, and sometimes the women, on whom one seeks to impose, and
that for their good. For the rest I lead a harmless life, and even
do a little good now and then."</p>

<p>The young man followed him along the wall of the convent and
past the nuns' kitchen-garden; there the goats left them and,
sticking their beards into the newly sprouting grass, munched and
bleated contentedly.</p>

<p>The abode of the hermit was in a wood of ilexes on the summit of
the hill, close beneath the majestic ruins of the Palace of the
Caesars. It was the hermit's opinion, warmly expressed to the
stranger, that this had been a sacred grove and that this dwelling
had once been a temple, dedicated, he believed, to the Four Winds
of Heaven; but the young Frenchman thought that this was perhaps an
ancient glade in the Imperial Garden and that the place where the
hermit had made his rude dwelling had once been a summerhouse where
the ladies of the Imperial household had sat to take the cool airs
of evening.</p>

<p>It was a circular building with pale-yellow, fluted marble
pillars and had been built round three parts of its circumference
with clay and wattle. The interior floor was covered with dry
branches and leaves, there were a hay mattress with two thick
blankets, some wooden receptacles for food, a tall red pottery jar
for water; on a table stood a wooden crucifix delicately carved and
several little amulets and charms, including a sprig of yew tied
with a scarlet thread. In front of this abode sat a short,
dark-haired man in worn but comfortable Clothing, who was cooking
small, spitted birds over a pan of charcoal.</p>

<p>"This is my guest, Testard," remarked the hermit without
embarrassment. "He, too, has left the train of the King of France
at Bologna, and does not mean to return&mdash;like yourself,
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall return today, or at the least tomorrow," the
traveller replied. "This adventure is but a brief interlude in my
life."</p>

<p>"Ah, I can see you are rich," grinned Testard, leering up from
his cooking and speaking in French. "You have good clothes on and
gold ornaments and a sword by your side. As for me, I am nothing
but a miniature painter, and I have very little to gain by dancing
attendance on the King of France."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed the other, with a slightly severe accent of
surprise, "the King of France is very magnificent, and employs all
manner of talents. You should do very well in his train, Monsieur
Testard."</p>

<p>"I dare say&mdash;one earns one's keep, and perhaps a little
money besides. But think of the work one has to do, always to
order! If one gets a book to illuminate, one must put in the
exploits of His Majesty and all his ancestors. One must show him as
Jove, as Jason, as Hercules&mdash;as God Himself! one must sit all
day working out his mottoes and emblems, one must work in all his
armorial bearings, and see they are right, too! And, perhaps," he
added, giving the birds a dexterous twist of the stick, "all the
while one is wishing to do something else&mdash;perhaps a landscape
or a simple bunch of pinks or a girl one likes, or an old man, a
charming old man whom one loves."</p>

<p>This protest seemed to open up a new point of view to the young
stranger. He pushed back his hood and looked thoughtfully at the
painter.</p>

<p>"But art must always be at the service of&mdash;" he hesitated
for a word&mdash;"of great people, of kings and nobles."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think so," replied Testard cheerfully. "No doubt
you can afford to employ some poor wretched devil yourself; but as
for me, I have done with it. I intend to live up here with our
friend and do what I like, for a while at least."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said the hermit gently, "the day is not far distant
when you will be driven down to beg for work from His Holiness,
from some of the Cardinals, or some of the great Roman nobles.
Perhaps you will be even glad, before you have finished, to get
some scene-painting, daubing a backcloth, or putting up one of
those canvas triumphal arches that they are so fond of spending
their money on when some king or prince comes into Rome. You know
that Calvo, who used to live as I do, has been dragged into the
service of the Pope and is now translating Vitruvius."</p>

<p>He put out platters, knives, bread, and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>"I've had my breakfast," said the stranger negligently. "This is
a curious place, I've never seen anything like it before. Rome!
Well, I dreamed of it differently."</p>

<p>"I suppose it will be different," replied the hermit in a
practical tone, "when the Pope has finished with it. Every Pope
does something, you know. The Borgia spent a great deal of money.
Then there was Julius&mdash;he did something too, although it was
all to be a tomb for himself. And now we've this Leo, the Medici.
Have you seen him? He is a most commonplace-looking fellow," the
old man chattered on, "but magnificent, magnificent! Have you seen
what he is building&mdash;the Vatican down there, St. Peter's? He
employs the very best artists."</p>

<p>"But," put in the miniaturist bitterly, "they have to do as he
says, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Well, that, of course. But they work under Raffaello Sanzio,
who is appointed keeper of the antiquities of Rome. What money he
makes! What fame he has!" The hermit raised his twinkling eyes to
the young Frenchman's face. "My name is Ottavo&mdash;the eighth
child. That's easy to remember, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The stranger refused the breakfast which the miniature painter
and the hermit shared with a good deal of relish. They asked him
his name and station and seemed a little overawed by his aloof
bearing and fine clothes.</p>

<p>"I seem to know your face," said the Frenchman. "I have seen
you, have I not, in the train of the King&mdash;or perhaps in that
of Charles Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"You must call him," replied the young man, with a faint ironic
smile, "the Conn&eacute;table de Bourbon now. The King gave him
that honour when he came to the throne. Yes, you may have seen me
there. My name is also Charles."</p>

<p>He had not removed his quilted hood; the early air was sharp; he
kept on his padded gloves also and sat back stiffly in the attitude
of one well trained, a hand on each knee; he had an air of
incomparable distinction in his graceful precision. He was so fine
and well bred and severe that he seemed out of place in that rich,
romantic scene.</p>

<p>Testard peered with tired eyes, which had become lined with much
fine brushwork, at the young man's dark face, which he felt sure he
had seen before. But it was not a very individual face, rather that
of a typical, patrician Frenchman, lean and dark, with straight
clipped hair, hollow cheek-bones, and large eyes, clear grey-brown,
light as agate under heavy lids; as this elegant stranger did not
seem disposed to disclose himself further, but sat apart from the
others, absorbed in gazing at the prospect of Rome, Testard
shrugged his plump shoulders and began to engage the hermit in a
lively conversation. Ottavo was ready to gossip.</p>

<p>The little painter had been for twenty-four hours living in this
strange retreat, which he had found by chance; he was delighted
with his circumstances and had not yet finished regaling Ottavo,
who was only too willing to listen, with all the gossip of
Bologna&mdash;how Leo had given a Scarlet Hat to Adrian de Boissy,
the King's tutor, and how François had created Giuliano de'
Medici Duke of Nemours. At the same time, he added with a leer,
though there were many fine sentiments passing and both the King
and the Pontiff pretended to nothing but the general good of
mankind and the service of God, there was a great deal of trickery
going on and it was a question of which was the sharper&mdash;the
Pope or the King. Of course, after the great victory that the
French had had, the Pope could not say much; it was amusing to see
what a good face he put on the situation. The sly Medici!</p>

<p>The hermit interrupted: "Do you know that His Holiness sent his
troops to Marignano under his nephew Lorenzo and told him to hold
off from the engagement until he saw which side was winning, and
then to join that?"</p>

<p>"Is that known?" asked the elegant stranger sharply.</p>

<p>"Of course it is known," replied the hermit with a comfortable
smile. "After all, it was quite a wise precaution to take."</p>

<p>"Yet he made a mistake after all," remarked Charles Monsieur
with a thin smile, "and threw his thirty thousand Switzers into the
losing side."</p>

<p>"Of course, there will be trouble about that," grinned Ottavo.
"Lorenzo is not a very good general, he could not see in the
confusion who was winning."</p>

<p>"And I could not see either at Bologna," said Testard. "There
were meetings and conferences and banquets and great church
services till one's eyes ached with the glitter and one's ears
ached with the noise. I heard that Leo had to give up Parma and
Modena, but François could not get the kingdom of Naples out
of him. But I'll tell you what was amusing. There were exchanges of
gifts, of course, and the Pope gave François a diamond as
large as a pigeon's egg and a golden reliquary with a piece of the
true Cross. But the King was not satisfied. What do you think he
asked for?"</p>

<p>"Is he is a good Christian," said the hermit slyly, "what could
he have that would please him better than a morsel of the true
Cross, eh?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he knows," said Testard, "that there is enough of the
true Cross in Rome to build a large house. In any case, His Majesty
asked for a piece of antique statuary."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's enough of that here," said Ottavo. "I dare say
there are several good pieces lying beneath us now if we cared to
dig."</p>

<p>"But he wanted one in particular, that which Felice de Fredis
dug up on his vineyard, which was on the site of the Baths of
Titus. That piece of breathing marble as it's called, 'The
Laocoön.'"</p>

<p>"And do you think that is a very impertinent request for the
King of France to make of the Pope of Rome?" asked Charles
Monsieur.</p>

<p>"The Pope was speechless. I believe that neither he nor any of
his Cardinals had ever heard of such audacity. But he consented, of
course. He said that the group should be sent to France at the
first opportunity. Did you," he asked, addressing the young man,
"visit the galleries in the Vatican?"</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur shook his head. "I should like to have seen
some of the frescoes in the Pope's apartments."</p>

<p>"It is difficult to get into them. The painters do not like to
be disturbed at their work. I expect this meeting at Bologna will
be one of the subjects they will paint&mdash;I believe that was
arranged before His Holiness set out from Rome. The painters had
already begun on the Coronation of Charlemagne, and he, the
Emperor, is to have the features of your François, while the
Pope is to have the countenance of the Medici." The hermit added
abruptly, wiping his fingers, greasy from eating the roasted bird,
on the grass: "He is very handsome, is he not, your King?"</p>

<p>The young Frenchman slightly raised his thin upper lip.</p>

<p>"He is very expensive, he pleases everybody. They think him
handsome, they know him gay&mdash;at least he has avenged all the
defeats we suffered in Italy.</p>

<p>"But," said the painter, "I do not think it was his generalship
that won at Marignano. The Conn&eacute;table de Bourbon is the
better soldier. It was he who gained that victory. After all, what
can you expect? François de Valois is only twenty years of
age, but shrewd as a fox cub. Those narrow eyes of his and that
long nose! Who would trust him? Why, he will even be a match for
the Medici. And so extravagant! Everything he touches must be of
gold."</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur rose slowly and flicked some scraps of dry moss
and marble dust from his black and violet mantle.</p>

<p>"I thank you for your hospitality," he said gravely. "I cannot
remain here any longer. This evening I must return to Bologna. Now
what would you, wise man, suggest that I do with my one day in
Rome?"</p>

<p>He opened his purse, which was carefully embroidered in scarlet
and golden thread, and put a piece of money on the stone. "This is
for your patron saint," he added with an accent of light irony, "or
for your poor. Now, give me your advice, venerable father."</p>

<p>The old man did not disdain the gold piece, which he picked up
with a thoughtful air.</p>

<p>"My advice depends on your tastes," he said, "yet I think I can
guess them from your appearance. There is everything in Rome, in
those marble palaces, in those glittering churches. Everywhere they
are building, The Pope is very splendid, even more splendid than
your King. But if you were to go to the Campo dei Fiori and knock
at the little crooked door beside the inn that has the sign of the
<i>Corona Triumphalis</i> and ask for one Gian Battista Vercelli, a
charlatan, you would find there something that would interest and
perhaps please you, though I am sure you are difficult."</p>

<p>"And who is this Vercelli?" asked the Frenchman negligently, as
if he had already forgotten his own request and was again absorbed
in the prospect of Rome, which began to glitter from the gilt of a
hundred fanes in the strengthening light of the winter sun.</p>

<p>"He is an astrologer," replied the hermit. "He has been in the
East for twenty years and has learnt much there from the Magi and
mathematicians. He does not work for money. He will tell you a
great deal if he thinks you are interested. He is a doctor,
too&mdash;he can heal the body and the soul. He lives there in
poverty in that vile quarter, because he despises everything in
this world&mdash;or perhaps because he has never had a chance of
attracting the attention of the great."</p>

<p>"I would rather," replied the Frenchman, "see something
beautiful. Why do you send me to some filthy charlatan, a wizard or
a quack? Yet, after all," he added with a sudden change of tone as
if mocking at himself, "no doubt I shall go there."</p>

<p>His unexpected, gay smile at the miniature painter much changed
his face.</p>

<p>"Adieu, Monsieur Testard. I wish you good luck with your
experiment&mdash;freedom in art! But if you disdain all patronage
you may yet come to painting doors."</p>

<p>He made his way quickly, with precision and grace, down the
turfy slope encumbered with the blocks of yellow masonry, many of
which bore elaborate carvings, and down the path, darkened by
clusters of bramble and groups of ilex and laurel trees, which
showed their dull greenish-black leaves in the blue air.</p>

<p>"He is a great lord," said the painter, looking after him, "I
wish I could remember who he is. After all, his face is very much
like that of all the others. But see how richly he is
dressed&mdash;it is a common caprice of the nobles, too, to go
wandering about in disguise. He was wearied with all that pageantry
at Bologna, sickened, perhaps, by the lies and hypocrisy. Do you
think that he will be safe in your dome, that they will not beguile
him into some den and murder him for the sake of his gold and
appointments?"</p>

<p>The hermit reached out a withered hand and clutched the
broad-leaved hat trimmed with a few dirty cockle-shells, and the
worn wooden bowl that hung inside the door of his hut. It was his
custom to go down every day into Rome and to beg outside the inns
where the wealthy foreigners lodged. He had not much need of money
himself and was quite happy in his retreat on the Palatine, but his
sons were respectable small farmers, and one of them wanted to
dower a daughter. "He is shrewd and he is armed, your countryman,"
he said, "and I don't suppose anyone in Rome would care to touch a
Frenchman just now. Let him be."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles Monsieur made his way leisurely through the awakened
city. He was not remarked among that crowd of pilgrims, of
foreigners, of sight-seers, of painters, architects, sculptors, and
their students. He looked on this busy scene with the mingled
enthusiasm and disappointment of the man who expects too much from
life, and who is, therefore, never quite satisfied. He was
searching for something far beyond common pleasures or common
success, and the sense of his own inadequacy lay upon him like a
weight; he was conscious of weakness in himself, of his own
indecision, of his own confusion of belief; he knew that he was
passionately drawn towards beauty, and mysteriously drawn towards
God, and he could hardly separate in his mind the old pagan deities
so richly alluring in their strength and loveliness from the worn,
diseased, hideous figures of the emaciated saints and martyrs who
had driven the pagan gods and goddesses back to hell.</p>

<p>Both seemed deserving of his belief and of his worship. He had
seen images of these gods and saints, standing side by side on the
arches, beautifully designed and painted, made by the best
architects and artists of Italy, which had been set up to welcome
the King of France, that glorious young conqueror, into There they
had stood, the pictures of the filthy, bleeding men and women
bearing the martyr's palms, next to the radiant forms of nymphs and
fauns, and shoulder to shoulder with the most formidable Christian
virtues&mdash;Prudence, Temperance, and Chastity; while above them
all had towered the gigantic symbolic figures with wings and
swords&mdash;Philosophy, Rhetoric, Resolution, and Fortitude.</p>

<p>If even the Pope, the head of the Christian Church, thus
intermingled his gods and his symbols, was there not created a
confusion for all sons of Holy Church and all worshippers of pagan
beauty?</p>

<p>The young man's serious mind held tenaciously to that word,
beauty; he wished, he thought, for nothing else&mdash;not beauty
that could be purchased, hoarded and looked at occasionally, but
beauty that would be continuous, about him always, like the air and
the sunshine; and not a spendthrift, gorgeous extravagance, like
that of the young King of France, but something choice, austere,
difficult of attainment.</p>

<p>Ay, that was it&mdash;too difficult of attainment. How could one
exist in this coarse, bloody world and yet attain daily loveliness
of life? He was too fine-bred, too fastidious, too carefully
trained, too thin of blood, perhaps, and reserved in nature to
enjoy anything that was not orderly and precise and delicate. It
distressed him to hate anyone; he was afraid of hatred, it seemed
to mar the serenity of his thoughts, as a festering wound would mar
the smoothness of his well-kept body. But he hated the young King
of France, and it was because of that passion that he had come away
from Bologna where his master was wheedling, beguiling, and
deceiving the crafty Pope.</p>

<p>To ease his mind from hatred he thought of love. He had an
austere, loyal affection for his brothers and sisters, all younger
than himself, and for the memory of his father and his elder
brother, both of whom had died outside Naples, fighting for
France.</p>

<p>They were buried in one ornate mausoleum, and he wished that it
might be possible for him to go southwards to say prayers beside
this tomb.</p>

<p>But there were two others, whom he loved with that strong,
serene passion which he held to be the highest form of human
felicity, his young wife and her mother. These women seemed to him
holy in their fragrant piety, in their austere self-denial, in
their cheerful and diligent application to the little things of
everyday, in their fastidious breeding and in their loyalty, their
fidelity, their affection towards him. When he thought of them, he
thought of pearls and daisies, of cool spring water in crystal
flagons, and fine, laborious embroidery on pure linen and white
woollens; of prayers rising upwards to the Virgin's foot-stool.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>He made his way, walking daintily, across the slums and the
market-places where the peasantry were selling their wares, the
quacks shouting their nostrums, and the bare-footed friars, whose
rough gowns were girdled with rope, were incessantly threading
through the crowds.</p>

<p>He found the inn in the Field of Flowers; a battered sign hung
out, on which was a defaced painting of a Roman general's triumphal
crown. Smiling in his hood, the young Frenchman knocked at the
humble door. It was opened by a small negro, whose beautifully
modelled face, of a bluish-grey tinge, expressed an intelligent
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Is your master one Vercelli, a wise man?"</p>

<p>The negro nodded and beckoned the stranger inside the narrow,
tiled corridor.</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur, who was utterly fearless and who never thought
of treachery or danger, followed the black by up a narrow spiral,
darkish staircase, which led to an upper room that looked upon a
small courtyard, in which grew an immense cypress tree.</p>

<p>It was the chamber of a student: books, some in manuscript and
some printed, were carefully arranged upon the shelves; there was a
desk with a lamp, paper, ink, and mathematical instruments beneath
a high-set window; a long couch piled with several Eastern shawls
and rugs, their bright colours fading, their fringes worn. There
was an ebony cabinet adorned with ivory masks, on which stood
various bottles of coloured glass; the window, which looked north,
escaped the sun, and a stream of colourless light fell into the
melancholy chamber.</p>

<p>Vercelli, a man neither young nor old, who wore a doctor's robe,
greeted his visitor without surprise, for every morning he held
consultations, and his presence and his advice were free to any who
chose to ask for them. Some of the Cardinals considered him a
dangerous man, one who indulged in perilous speculations and whose
opinions were tinged with scepticism; others thought he was the spy
of a foreign power or a Roman faction and powerfully protected.</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur was depressed when he saw the
apartment&mdash;he had seen so many like it in his own country but
Vercelli looked at him with great interest and courteously offered
him a seat.</p>

<p>"I wonder why I have intruded on you," said the Frenchman with
his thin smile. "I have no good introductions either. I was sent
here by one&mdash;an old hermit&mdash;a beggar man, who lives on
the Palatine. I came with King François to Bologna and I had
the great desire to see Rome."</p>

<p>"You will not," replied Vercelli civilly, "see much of it, sir,
from my chamber window. It is plain then that Rome does not satisfy
you. You, like everyone else who comes here, seek something. You
are discontented and yet you have many gifts."</p>

<p>"You do not know me," smiled the Frenchman; he sat as he had sat
on the block of golden stone on the Palatine, precise and graceful,
his athletic figure erect, his mantle falling in smooth folds. As
he spoke he pushed back the quilted hood, and the pallid light fell
upon his composed face, which, though hollowed and lined for his
age, had a grave beauty.</p>

<p>"I can say with the young man who could not bring himself to
follow our Lord, 'I have great possessions'. I can say also that I
am something of a fool, or I should not be here now."</p>

<p>"What is it that you dread?" asked the Italian quietly.</p>

<p>As if he had not heard the question, the Frenchman continued in
his low, pleasing voice: "I am happy in my love. I was married when
I was fifteen years old. She is most dear to me, we live together
in great harmony&mdash;and her mother is as close to me as my own
mother, whom I lost when I was a child. I have power over a large
number of people and I try to be just and generous, and I know I am
liked, sometimes blessed. I hate a man whom I think in every way my
inferior, yet he is placed by a whim of birth above me. I am
strong, healthy, and never afraid, but four or five times in the
year I have attacks of fever that bring me very low&mdash;during
which I have dreams."</p>

<p>"Ah! Dreams!"</p>

<p>"I am restless and undecided. All my fortunes are pledged to the
world, yet I would not be of the world."</p>

<p>"You want, I suppose, to live in an enchanted castle on a magic
mountain, undisturbed even by the winds of heaven?"</p>

<p>"You laugh at me, and with good reason. I do not know why I came
to interrupt your studies, learned doctor. Take it that I indulge a
mood."</p>

<p>"I take it, sir, that you are one who can afford to indulge
moods. What have you seen in Rome?"</p>

<p>"Much that makes me homesick," replied the young man with sudden
vehemence rising. "I would that I had been born in that golden age
before the shadow of the Cross fell over all the beauty of the
world!"</p>

<p>"I can tell you this," said Vercelli. "The vase of fine
porcelain is broken when it is jostled against vases of clay and
iron. If you and fastidious, difficult, and wish to keep clean
hands and a serene soul, and loathe any befoulments of mind or
body, leave the world to those who do not care how they soil their
fingers as long as they rake up golden pieces from the mud. Leave
the world to men like your King François, to the Pope, the
Medici and all their parasites. It is for them it is made. They
know the game and they will win the stakes."</p>

<p>"But I have much worldly stuff&mdash;almost everything a man may
have. I own almost as much as King or Pope, and might have had
quite as much could I act more boldly."</p>

<p>"And in that boldness you lack all," said Vercelli. "This is no
age nor place for fine-drawn scruples. If you are of the world you
must behave as the world behaves. If you try to be with them and
not of them you will do more evil than the biggest rogue among
them."</p>

<p>"Do evil?" sighed the young Frenchman. "It never occurred to me
that I could do evil."</p>

<p>"You will do harm&mdash;you are weak, and you hesitate and
meddle." He rose and took down a bottle of pale, rosy wine from the
cabinet of ebony and ivory, poured some of the liquid into a
long-stemmed glass, and offered it to his guest.</p>

<p>"Drink that and rest a little while on my couch. Your hands are
trembling and there is sweat on your brow. It is easy for the blood
to be chilled in these Roman evenings and mornings. The miasma
comes up from the marshes and sickens a man's spirit."</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur did as he was bid. He felt drowsy and fatigued,
a heaviness in his limbs and a weariness on his spirit.</p>

<p>"You trust me," said Vercelli, smiling at him curiously.</p>

<p>"I trust everyone but the King of France and his mother," said
the young man, throwing himself down with a sigh on the Eastern
rug, which had a dry but pleasing perfume.</p>

<p>He felt already tired and slightly ashamed of his adventure,
which had seemed so charming at the outset. It was probable that he
would be missed at Bologna and that his absence would be the
occasion for comment and even mocks. He would have to ride hard if
he was to get back in time for the comedy that the Pope was
offering the King of France, and if he were not there his absence
would be taken ill.</p>

<p>He stretched his long, slim limbs on that strange couch;
Vercelli put into his hand a mirror of polished steel, telling him
to stare into it.</p>

<p>"There is no magic in it," he said with his pleasant, slightly
tired smile. "You will see there your own dreams, your own soul,
and when you have dreamed away what now oppresses you, you will be
more at ease."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles Monsieur fell asleep, as he supposed, almost at
once&mdash;lying there with the perfume of the dead iris and violet
roots in his nostrils, and before him the dim yet gleaming surface
of the mirror, which seemed to expand until it filled the entire
room, blocking out the homely furnishings and the shabby figure of
the doctor in his darned and faded gown.</p>

<p>Waves of light passed over the monstrous surface of the mirror
and these shook into the glittering form of a woman&mdash;the woman
whose name the young man had just taken on his lips, the Queen
Mother, Louise. She wore the colours of her House of Savoy, which
she always affected, the scarlet of carnations and that small
hedgerow flower called "the eye of day"; this pure scarlet is a
rare colour in nature and the Heralds were put to it to find
symbols for the hue of Savoy; for the other hue it was easy; she
had everything that was white, from the ermine to the snowdrop; all
her luxurious books, her handsome apartments, her gorgeous robes,
her horses, her pages, her musicians, and her ladies were clad and
emblazoned in these two hues.</p>

<p>So Charles Monsieur saw her now, with the tight scarlet dress,
the white veil, the hard little face bleached to the colour of a
pearl, the narrow, vermilion painted lips, the plucked eyebrows,
and eyes green-grey as glass beads or bubbles of sea water. He had
not believed that he had had her in his mind at all&mdash;he was
always striving to forget her very existence; but there she was,
and soon he was following her through a thick wood of pines where
the needles were close packed underfoot, and the sky made little
bright patches between the dense flat boughs overhead. Louise rode
a white palfrey trapped in scarlet net&mdash;the long braided
tassels touched the ground; and he, Charles Monsieur, was leading
the bridle; the thick, scarlet, twisted silk of it showed across
his white hand.</p>

<p>Louise was singing&mdash;she had a low, rather harsh voice,
which gave her words spirit and meaning. Charles Monsieur wished to
turn back, to leave her, but was impelled to go forward. She took
no heed of him, but he knew she was leading him like a captive to
some destination of her own choosing; her song was echoed in the
upper boughs of the pine trees, in the jingle of the pony's
harness.</p>

<p>They came out on to a large meadow and it was twilight, that
pale and sinister colour of dreams which may be between dawn and
day or between evening and night. A large palace stood on the
meadow and it was lit up from within so that every window was a
patch of brightness. Above the palace hung the banner of Savoy,
white and scarlet in the dusk. The ground was enamelled with
flowers; as the borders of a jewel are studded with smaller stones
set in gold, so the borders of this castle, the green swards, were
strewn with flowers, strewn as a miniature painter strews the
borders of his picture; there were daisies, violets and cyclamen,
primroses, pinks, wallflowers, and little bright and starry wreaths
and everything that grows low and humbly in the open fields in the
thick grass.</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur thought of Testard the painter, of how he would
spend one morning collecting the tiny flowers and tiny leaves and
one afternoon in copying them carefully on to the vellum
surrounding a great letter L, in which would be a picture of Louise
seated at the table playing cards with a blond page.</p>

<p>A wind blew from inside the silent palace and cast out into the
dusk the scarlet-and-white curtains hanging at the open door.
Louise dismounted, Charles gave her his hand and led her up the
steps into the palace. A masquerade was in progress. The hall was
the largest he had ever seen; it seemed to have no limit, and the
lights that were suspended from the ceiling in clusters appeared to
be one with the stars, save that they gave out a brilliant
illumination. Music came from a half-seen orchestra that appeared
to be set up high and surrounded by clouds. Here air smelt dank and
rotten as if there were dank dead leaves mouldering. A large,
silent company was moving gravely in the intricate figures of a
dance.</p>

<p>Charles, against his own volition, put his arm round Madame
Louise's brocaded waist, and joined in the measure. The music was
drumming in his ears monotonously, like the beating of his own
blood when he had fever; he seemed to have a veil before his eyes,
for he saw everything dimly; the shapes seemed to shift and move
one into another; a cavalier in pearl-coloured satin passed him and
the next second had changed into a huge white beast with blunt
horns; many of the ladies had the faces of does or vixens, which,
even as he looked, changed into some other more terrifying mask;
through the persistent thudding of the music was a thin fluting,
which rose and fell on two notes with a monotony maddening to the
nerves.</p>

<p>At the end of the vast ballroom in an alcove, lit by a shifting
and uncertain light, a group of gigantic statuary&mdash;a man and
his two sons in their death agonies, being crushed and poisoned by
powerful snakes, which moved and writhed with the rhythm of the
music. A faint perfume of staled church incense penetrated the
fetid odours of the masquerade.</p>

<p>The head of Charles Monsieur ached&mdash;he would willingly have
been gone, he would willingly have left the dance, but his partner
drew him on and on. It seemed as if there were no floor beneath
their feet, no ceiling above their heads. Hooded figures sat
gloomily beyond the dancers; their faces were unseen and their
hands moved busily with a long thread and shuttle; the dancers
moved aside as a procession entered the room; it was that of the
baptism of a Princess of France; all the ladies were in white; they
had come in from the winter weather, for there was snow on their
cloaks and hoods. The baby Princess was swaddled in white and
silver, with the <i>fleurs de lis</i> on her mantle; her little
sister, undersized, pale, her thin yellow hair combed straight on
to the ermine, walked beside the nurse.</p>

<p>This procession, which seemed composed of frost and icicles,
melted like snow before a fire in the sullen warmth of the infernal
masquerade; its place was taken by another the funeral processions
of two royal infants and their mother, all white and pallid,
colourless and helpless as tears, yet blotted all over with the
royal splendour of Valois.</p>

<p>As this white procession of the dead children of France passed
across and vanished into the infernal masquerade, the melody of the
high-placed, cloud-swept orchestra changed; the strings of harp and
violin were muted, the flutes hushed, and drums and trumpets
sounded harshly. It was a painted show of war enacted by ghosts,
who rose and fell without a sound like a cloud of coloured vapour
across the ballroom.</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur, dancing mechanically with the red and white
woman in his arms, stared up at this image of all the wars whereby
the French had surged to and fro the Alps on to the voluptuous
plains of Italy; forests of spears from which fluttered
multi-coloured pennons with a variety of grotesque
devices&mdash;golden spurs and silver armour and white horses
armoured and caparisoned in leather and metal. These figures rode
at each other, fell back, returned, and so continued their
ceaseless charges in a wordless show.</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur was oppressed by the monotony of this show;
there were grins of stiff agony on the faces of the soldiers, it
seemed as if they were under an enchantment and could neither
forbear the combat nor die and be at peace. He saw the Switzers
tramping down from their mountains, where the perpetual snow hung
in white avalanches along the purple ravines and between the giant
pines; he saw Cardinal Matthew Schinner coming up from the Valaise
with his body-guard of mountaineers in their parti-coloured
uniforms, which seemed to be of gold and flame, which had been
designed by the painter Michael Angelo; as Charles Monsieur looked
at this show he thought that he looked at a painting by this same
painter where monstrous figures of giants were for ever interlinked
in sombre combat or moody meditation; he tried to speak, to call
aloud, "Ho, why have we all this fighting and contending? Who is a
whit the better for it, and is not the whole world weary of the
tramp of armed feet?"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In the vision, which seemed to shrink and compose itself into
the form of a whirling globe, he saw the map of Europe scattered
with little towns like those mock structures of wood used at jousts
and plays that go down at the touch of a toy lance; he saw that
these were real towns, falling as the phantom knight charged them
and going up into thin flames that turned the stars blood-red. He
moved, he struggled against the strength of his dream, but it held
him firmly, as a manacle about his wrists, as a rope about his feet
and yet he knew he was dreaming and puzzled over the meaning of
much that he saw; why two dead children? only one had died; he
remembered it, only a few years ago, the old, ill, sad Kind, the
ugly, ill, sad Queen; and that battering at the gate of heaven for
a child, for an heir to the throne of France, an heir for the House
of Valois. And one had come, and it was a girl&mdash;and another
had come, and it was dead; and then the Queen had folded her hands
and died too, even as he had just seen in his vision.</p>

<p>But a tomb, with twin infants side by side, swaddled in white
and silver&mdash;that had not been; he tried to piece this dream
within a dream and find out the meaning of it; a great weariness
consumed him, fatigue crept into his marrow, that he must dance and
dance with the woman in red and white; her face was very close to
his and presently seemed to expand and fill the whole smoky
atmosphere&mdash;the plucked eyebrows, the narrow painted lips, the
close nostrils, the pale hair and, round the eyes and under the
throat, little wrinkles.</p>

<p>She was talking about her son, her Caesar, her Apollo, who was
now King of France; she was striking Charles Monsieur on the breast
with her thin, ringed hands till the jewels rattled against her
delicate bones, and telling him that he must go on his knees and do
homage to her Caesar, and he struggled and cried out for his gentle
wife Suzanne, and for her mother, Anne of France, who had been
Regent of that realm in her young brother's time.</p>

<p>He cried out to them to save him from these phantoms of war,
from the white-and-scarlet woman, from all the figures of the
infernal masquerade, who plucked at his black-and-violet cloak, who
put filthy fingers on his fine linen and soiled it, who flicked him
with their dank tresses as they passed, who glared at him with
livid eyes through the holes in their detestable masks.</p>

<p>He longed passionately, desperately, for serenity, for a cool
mead at dawn, for the new grass, for daisies, for the tall, narrow
chapel with the pure crimson and blue windows that was at Moulins,
for clear water in crystal flagons and green apples folded in a
white napkin, for all that was dainty and precise and fresh from
the earth. The woman in white and scarlet pouted out her thin lips,
stretched forward her slim neck as if about to kiss him.</p>

<p>He twisted back his head in sick disgust and woke, to find
himself on that bed, scented with orris and violet root, in the
commonplace chamber of Vercelli, the doctor, in Rome.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It was midday; a wan light filled the chamber and glittered
through the rows of coloured bottles on the ebony and ivory
cabinet. The negro was standing at a desk, pounding herbs in a
stone mortar, camomile daisies surely, from the acrid perfume.
Charles Monsieur sat up and turned his drowsy eyes towards the
doctor.</p>

<p>"You gave me some drug. I dreamt heavily."</p>

<p>"You had nothing. Your dreams were of your own making."</p>

<p>"So," said the Frenchman, carefully adjusting his tumbled
garments, "that is all you have to give me&mdash;a dream, which you
admit is of my own making, and some advice. Yes, you gave me some
advice, but I forget what it was."</p>

<p>Only this: do not meddle with the world unless you are a
worldling. If you are a philosopher or an artist, you must dwell
apart and take the crusts that are thrown you&mdash;but if you want
the prizes, you must be of them who compete.</p>

<p>He put his hands in the pockets of his worn coat and then added,
in an indifferent voice:</p>

<p>"Have you seen the statues in San Lorenzo which Michael Angelo
hewed? The Pope is building a mausoleum there for the Medici
family&mdash;all in <i>pietra serena</i>&mdash;you know, of a grey
colour, and cold and chill. The statues are very wonderful. They
say, though, that he does not like making them&mdash;he thinks he
is wasting his time; he spends months at the quarries watching the
stone being cut."</p>

<p>"I wish he would come to France and work for me," said Charles
Monsieur. "And yet I do not know. There is something fiendish and
monstrous about his figures, they disturb and excite me."</p>

<p>He put a gold piece carefully and precisely on the table, as he
had placed a gold piece carefully and precisely on the tawny rock
outside the beggar-hermit's hut.</p>

<p>"If you will take nothing for yourself, I suppose you know those
who are in need. My head aches a little. I would I had not seen
what I saw in my dream, although I have already forgotten it."</p>

<p>The doctor bowed courteously without replying, and looked at the
coin on which was the image of the twelfth Louis.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles Monsieur went down the twisting staircase into the
square, which was now hot and dusty, smelling of stale country
products and of dried winter fruits which were brought there for
disposal, sticky figs, raisins, preserves, spices, and lees of
wine. The battered sign, "The Triumphal Crown", hung directly above
his head. He wondered why he had come to this place and greatly
blamed himself for the restless irresolution that had brought him
to Rome.</p>

<p>The press of the parti-coloured passers-by affected him almost
with nausea. They irritated him, all these different
people&mdash;the monks with smug or cadaverous faces, in black or
white or brown, with girdles hanging to their feet; these peasants,
in from the campagna, dressed in goats' skins and small black hats
from which fluttered ribbons; the handsome, dark-eyed women with
their winter hoods, who glanced at him with the bold stare of birds
of prey, marking his gold chain and embroidered gloves with envy;
these pilgrims and deformed beggars, even the little golden-brown
children, hardy and bold-eyed; he disliked them all because they
made him feel weak and compassionate, desirous of saving them from
tyrants and scoundrels, from the ambitions and lusts of men like
François the King, and Leo the Pope.</p>

<p>As he made his way to the inn where he had left his horse he was
impressed&mdash;nay, more than that&mdash;his whole soul was caught
up in an enthusiasm at the splendour and beauty of the ruined city
that seemed in herself so much greater and more magnificent than
any tyrant who had ever ruled within her mouldering walls.</p>

<p>Rome&mdash;the colour of dead flowers and of summer dusk
seeming, even in the winter, to be powdered with gold; with her
massive towers, triumphal arches, glittering fanes, and superb
palaces that rose from amidst the dark tresses of ilex, bay, and
laurel, the flat blue-black boughs of cypress, the metallic leaves
of palms&mdash;affected this foreigner with painful pleasure. From
great fountains of golden stone, placed at the corners of the
streets, water, pure and cold as diamonds, glittered in shallow
basins. Flocks of doves and pigeons rose from the ruined pillars of
broken palaces and temples&mdash;the temples of Jove the Thunderer
and Mars the Avenger, now clear in the noonday sun; they had lost
their morning colours of blue, lilac, and green and appeared as
white as the sails of a distant ship at sea.</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur, though it was urgent for him to be on his way,
paused by the low parapet of the river and looked down on that
turgid flood which, thick and yellow, hurried towards the sea at
Ostia. He gazed at the mighty circular outline of Hadrian's tomb,
the Castello Sant' Angelo that was supposed to house the fabulous
treasures of the Pope, and he smiled to himself when he noticed
again the light, newly constructed bridge that connected the Papal
apartments in the Vatican with this impregnable fortress.</p>

<p>Did even His Holiness fear war, and think the day might come
when he would be glad to take refuge in the tomb of the heathen
Emperor? What had the tiara'd Medici to fear? thought Charles
Monsieur, in light irony. Leo X, who was protected by all the
superstition of all mankind! Then the Frenchman crossed himself
humbly&mdash;surely the thought had been blasphemous; one must not,
even for an instant, confuse Almighty God with his Vicegerent, de'
Medici.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The Pope had ordered a comedy to be presented in Bologna for the
entertainment of King François; His Holiness was not in a
good humour and his habitual courtesy had become nervously
strained. The French victory had meant a defeat of his policy and
he was ill-pleased to see a conqueror on Italian soil. He had had
many small personal vexations of late also: it had been delightful,
and had caused him to weep sentimental tears, when he had been
received with such loyal enthusiasm by his countrymen in Florence;
but in painful contrast had been his reception in Bologna, when he
and his eighteen scarlet clad Cardinals, riding on mules, had been
forced to proceed through undecorated streets without one triumphal
arch and with only one poor canopy of silk and another of worn and
stained cloth&mdash;Leo had ordered the first to be borne over the
Host and had himself refused the second. Then there had been the
effort required to get together a State procession for the King,
whose impetuous and unexpected victory had so spoiled all his,
Leo's, long-conceived and far-reaching schemes; yes, they had been
very tedious, all those formal ceremonies, and he would be glad of
the comedy&mdash;it would be a chance of relaxing, of laughing a
little, perhaps of forgetting himself.</p>

<p>François was so young and so charming, Leo would like to
have had his portrait painted by Raffaello or his bust carved by
Michael Angelo; yet he disliked him, because he was no mere
beautiful, empty-headed youth but a shrewd and, as the Pope feared,
treacherous diplomat; it had taken all Leo's art, courtesies,
blandishments, and tricks to prevent this young conqueror from
marching southward and seizing what he most coveted&mdash;the
Kingdom of Naples; but the Pope had been able to prevent
that&mdash;he sighed with relief when he thought of that success.
There had been many pageants and ceremonies, and Leo had been able,
he hoped, to impress the young French King, who had always stood
bareheaded in his presence and had knelt before him at his first
reception; neither had François disdained, when Leo held
High Mass at San Petronio, to hold the water used at the lavabo;
but all this and all these insincere expressions of goodwill and
delight in the virtues of Christian peace and charity had been most
exhausting, and Leo, who had not been well when he left Rome, felt
himself at the end of his nerves.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>What had really upset him more than anything else was that
insolent request for the Laocoön group; he trembled with rage
whenever he thought of that&mdash;he must not think of it, for it
would not do to be angry with François before they had
parted more or less on good terms, and he had driven with the
astute Frenchman as good a bargain as was, under the circumstances,
possible.</p>

<p>A stage had been arranged in the magnificent hall of the Piazza
Pubblica and though the Pope had brought the architect and
painters, sculptors, actors, poets, and splendid paraphernalia from
Rome he regretted the lack of the handsome theatre in the Holy
City. The news of the French victory had been so unexpected that
everything had been done in a hurry and some of the choicest
buffoons and musicians, dwarfs and jesters, had not yet arrived at
Bologna.</p>

<p>Moreover Leo had wished to show the King of France the elephant
that had been sent him by the King of Portugal and that was
considered the greatest curiosity in Europe; but the monstrous
beast refused to leave its stable in the Vatican. There was another
pleasure that the Pope had been forced to forgo; he loved above
everything practical jests and he did not dare to play any of these
on François de Valois. Still, such as it was&mdash;and to
one of his lavish tastes, his supreme extravagance, it was not very
magnificent&mdash;the pageantry went forward. The Pope took his
place on his golden throne with the King of France on his right and
a chair placed for the Conn&eacute;table de Bourbon on his left;
his spirits rose when he saw the elegant circles of wax lights and
heard the scarlet-clad musicians tuning their elegant, shining
instruments; he could never resist, even in a moment of difficulty
and depression, the joy of a spectacle.</p>

<p>He sat heavily in his white brocade rochet and red mozzetta; his
crimson cap with its tiny edging of white fur came to his ears so
that he appeared bald. He was forty years of age, gross in his
person, bloated with disease, his huge paunch borne on weak,
spindly legs; his profile rolled in fat to his throat, but was
dignified by a massive nose; his eyes were pale, close-set,
penetrating and shrewd in expression; he was so short-sighted that
a spy-glass was constantly in his hand&mdash;without it he was
almost blind; he bore himself with an easy majesty, and despite his
clumsy figure his air was one of both grace and dignity.</p>

<p>The Pope's courtesy was magnificent, bland, smiling, and
exquisitely adjusted to people and to circumstances. Behind him
stood two priests, Giulio de' Medici, the bastard son of the Pope's
elder brother, whose black, almond eyes expressed haughty reserve,
and Luigi de' Rossi.</p>

<p>The Medici Cardinal was forbidding in aspect, with handsome
features and heavy black hair combed straight round the tonsure. He
was hand-in-glove with his uncle; they worked together for the
power of the House of Medici.</p>

<p>The young King of France was a charming figure, what his
countrymen called <i>beau chevalier</i>; he was tall, with wide
shoulders and narrow hips, slim and active; his long, peculiar
face, which the French considered extremely attractive, was
continually smiling with an expression of insolent gaiety, with
upward lines of nostrils, lips, and eyes; his nose was very long
with fine flat nostrils, his eyes black and sparkling with
inexpressible animation and enthusiasm; lank black hair fell on
either side of his narrow cheeks; and he was dressed in gold, very
carefully tailored. With his large white hands set upon his knees
he leaned forward in his throne, looked with the greatest interest
at the company, and waited in expectancy for the spectacle to
begin.</p>

<p>Immediately before the brocaded and flowered curtains were
drawn, there was a stir in the closely packed audience. The third
most important figure in this splendid pageant arrived: Charles de
Montpensier, Duc de Bourbon, Conn&eacute;table de France, who took
the third chair, put a little lower than those of King and Pope,
which had been placed with due pomp for the conqueror of
Marignano.</p>

<p>This young Prince, descended from Saint Louis, was the greatest
subject in the world, a feudal lord who held unlimited power over a
third of France; he was the first soldier in that kingdom, and to
him François owed the late victory, the golden fruits of
which he was now enjoying.</p>

<p>The King ignored his entry, but the Pope greeted him with
unblemished courtesy. Charles Monsieur answered with cold
reverence: he had ridden hard to be in time for the spectacle, he
was fatigued; the dream that had disturbed his sleep in the chamber
of Vercelli, the Roman charlatan, still troubled his mind; he did
not wish to view this obscene and glittering comedy, which was
supposed to be one of the rewards of his victory, and he glanced
with hatred at the lascivious, cunning face of the King, who, at
twenty-one years of age, was an expert at what he termed love, and
was forever seeking some beautiful and easy woman; the brilliant
rings of pure wax candles made the eyes of Charles ache; the air
was tainted from the great press on the floor below the dais.</p>

<p>It had been said of the Pope that he could no more save a
thousand ducats than a stone could fly up into the sky, and though
without the help of the great Florentine bankers he would long ago
have been bankrupt, though he often had to raise money at forty per
cent, he lived in a state of splendour never equalled outside an
Eastern fairy tale.</p>

<p>As a dance melody was being played by the Papal musicians on
their gilded platform a crowd of buffoons in animal masks scampered
in, in front of the great painted curtains; as these were drawn
aside a cleverly lit drop-scene painted by Raffaello was disclosed
and the close-packed audience of bishops, priests, courtiers, and
nobles gave a murmur of gratification and astonishment as they saw
the stage lit by clusters of coloured lamps which formed the Papal
cypher and that of the King of France.</p>

<p>The scene was a marvellous perspective of a street. Before this
appeared a herald who, in the Medici livery, advancing to the
footlights, recited an obscene prologue which sent the Pope into
laughter that shook his huge stomach; the King of France also
enjoyed this unseemly wit, which, for his benefit, was partly
expressed in French; but some of those present&mdash;Ambassadors
from some of the Italian states and the Imperial
Envoy&mdash;thought the verses too free to be given before His
Holiness, and grimaced in disgust at one another behind their
hands.</p>

<p>The play was the work of Ludovico Ariosto; and Innocenzo Cybo,
Leo's nephew and the youngest Cardinal, was taking the leading
part. The spectacle was enriched by several ballets and some
beautiful incidental music&mdash;some of this was performed on an
organ which had lately been presented to the Pope by the Cardinal
of Aragon.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>A pavilion of sad coloured cloth at the back of the stage
suddenly opened and out stepped a beautiful young woman, whose
smooth, white limbs were scarcely concealed by a thin gauze drapery
spangled with stars; her crisp, blonde locks were piled high above
her head and intertwined with pearls, which spread into an enormous
coronet stuck with white roses.</p>

<p>In correct Latin verses, which had been written for her by
Cardinal Cybo, the young actress besought Venus to provide her with
a husband; trumpets sounded from the wings and eight Anchorites in
dismal robes of dusty grey rushed upon the scene from the left, to
stop short, while from the right strutted on a rosy youth in gilt
buskins with tinsel wings and red roses among his gold sprinkled
tresses, who announced that his mother had granted the Fair
Supplicant's request.</p>

<p>The indignant hermits thereupon discharged arrows at the God of
Love, who was protected by Venus, who now appeared upon the stage
in a silver chariot of antique design, drawn by white mules, led by
black pages in green costumes. The splendour of this vision cast
the hermits unconscious upon the ground, and while they were thus
defenceless the God of Love transfixed them with their own arrows.
These wounds at once awakened them&mdash;they sprang up and
executed an intricate dance round Venus and the Fair Supplicant, to
whom they declared their passionate love. Soft and graceful music
was played as the hermits cast aside their sad-coloured robes and
appeared as handsome youths who wore long, tight-fitting purple
hose, quilted white doublets, and lawn shirts cut low and open on
their necks and bosoms.</p>

<p>The Pope with easy courtesy explained the moral of this
spectacle to the Duc de Bourbon.</p>

<p>"They mean to say that it is better for a young man to be dead
than to live as a cloistered monk."</p>

<p>Charles Monsieur praised civilly the magnificence of the show,
but it was for him all too luscious, too heavy with lustful hints
and provocations, and, tired as he was, his blood a little inflamed
by his recurrent fever, he could scarcely tell this spectacle from
the infernal masquerade in which he had dreamt he had taken part
when he had slept in Vercelli's chamber in Rome.</p>

<p>He thought that both the Fair Supplicant, with smooth limbs so
perfectly proportioned, looking as if she might have been one of
Angelo Bronzino's models, and the Venus, who had been chosen for
her likeness to the most exquisite classic statues, might have been
sisters or handmaidens of Louise of Savoy, the woman in white and
scarlet who had clung to him in that infernal ballroom and whose
proffered kiss had awakened him from his nightmare.</p>

<p>He remained for a while in his place after the Pope had risen
and escorted the King of France to the salon with the frescoes,
where long tables covered with pearly damask were set with almond
cakes, jellies, winter fruits, and wine of golden, white, and
crimson hue in crystal flagons encased in silver.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In the great hall below there was a sudden scramble towards the
door into the room where the refreshments were laid out; a
prelate's leg was broken in the press and several people were
trampled underfoot.</p>

<p>The Pope laughed heartily when told of this; he liked any jest
founded on the misfortunes of another, and he began easily to tell
the King of France the story of Barbello, his buffoon poet, who, to
amuse the Papal Court, had been taken on the King of Portugal's
elephant to the Capitol, there to be crowned with laurel; the
elephant had refused to cross the bridge despite the blows rained
upon his head by the poor, disappointed poet, who had been tipsy
with vanity and wine.</p>

<p>François, leaning against the buffet, laughed, but his
eyes were restless and his long fingers fidgeted with the thick
links of red gold round his neck. Everything was settled between
himself and the Pope as far as it could be settled; he was tired of
diplomacy and of pageantry, he wished to get away to his frivolous
pleasures but the Pope, who also knew that there was nothing more
to be done in the way of serious business between them, continued
to tell amusing stories and to flatter the King, whom he addressed
as Caesar. François was used to this term, which was
employed in reference to him by his mother, Louise, and his sister,
Marguerite.</p>

<p>The Pope also turned with soft words to the young Duc de
Bourbon; he was glad, he said, that so great a soldier and so
courteous a gentleman was to be left in command of Milan, which had
been handed over to the King of France by the indolent and timorous
Sforza, and he asked about the health of Charles Monsieur's young
wife, Suzanne, and hoped that she would soon bear him an heir to
inherit his great estates.</p>

<p>They all politely discussed the play and Leo regretted that he
had not his more elaborate stage machinery with him, and described
some of the spectacles he had contrived in the theatre in the
Vatican; he added that the two beautiful women who had taken the
parts of Venus and the Fair Supplicant had both sat as models to
his famous painter, Raffaello San Zio.</p>

<p>These exquisite creatures were, smiled Leo, having supper in the
chamber behind the stage, and if His Christian Majesty wished he
could send for them and receive their personal homage.
François laughed, careless, distracted by excitement and
success. The forced, civil talk came to an end; the last glass of
valerian was drunk, the last almond <i>pâté</i> broken; and
the two young French conquerors at length took their reverent leave
of His Holiness the Pope.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>When everyone else had gone the Pope remained alone in his
bed-chamber with his nephew, Cardinal Giulio de' Medici. Leo at
once ordered another supper to be brought in, for he had a
capricious appetite: sometimes for days he would eat nothing but
pulse and drink nothing but water, and then he would indulge in
gluttony for a long period.</p>

<p>He sighed, rubbed his weak, short-sighted eyes with his
handkerchief, and then dabbed at his flabby, trembling mouth. He
was irritated and disappointed; he would gladly have seen the two
insolent Frenchmen's heads cut off and bouncing neatly into the
Tiber. He wanted to discuss the whole unpleasant business with
Giulio, but controlled himself; it was getting late and he had his
health to think of&mdash;he had been in pain with horrible attacks
of nausea and retching ever since he came to Bologna, and his sight
had dazzled so much that he had hardly been able to see the stage
play.</p>

<p>"François is a fox and a viper," he muttered, with
unsteady fingers reaching out towards the silver dish of ortolans
that was brought him. "And I should like to have a painting of that
peculiar face of his. Did you ever, my Giulio, see so long a nose?
And his eyes appeared just under his cap as if he had no forehead.
The young Connétable is a handsomer man, and, as I think, a
more honest&mdash;but weak, and that is worse."</p>

<p>Leo sighed and ate, thinking of what was, after extravagant
splendour, his greatest pleasure&mdash;the chase. This had been
considered an unseemly diversion in a Pontiff, but he had been
unable to control his lustful joy in the hunt. Most of all he liked
to kill the prey; when the trembling, exhausted beasts were taken
and lying helpless in the net, it was the Pope's great joy to be
helped off his white palfrey, to walk to the victims, and to draw a
sharp knife across the smooth, shuddering throats.</p>

<p>He would like to have been at the hunt now as he sliced the legs
off the ortolans, and he thought, not of the throat of a wild
animal, but of the slim neck of François&mdash;ay, and of
that of the Duc de Bourbon, the victor of Marignano.</p>

<p>How insolent they both were! It was clear that they considered
themselves conquerors of the whole of Italy, and François
had nearly outwitted him and secured Naples&mdash;ay, that would
have been a blow!</p>

<p>Leo peered up at Giulio de' Medici, who, with a detached and
slightly disagreeable air, stood beside his chair. There was much
in his nephew that Leo regretted&mdash;what a pity, for instance,
that he was a bastard! It had been very tedious making that
pretence of a marriage between his murdered father, Giuliano, and
some unknown woman, a secret, unwitnessed, unregistered marriage,
but this fraud had been necessary before it had been possible for
Giulio to become a Cardinal; of course, nobody had believed in the
lie and it had lowered the Pope's repute, not only for holiness but
for common sense.</p>

<p>The sly, subtle Italians had laughed in their sleeves and Leo
had known it; yet Giulio was necessary to him, bastard or no; this
man must support the splendour of the House of Medici&mdash;perhaps
some day Giulio would be Pope; and Leo did not think his own life
was likely to be a long one. When he had received the usual solemn
warning on the day of his coronation "Thou shalt reign less days
than St. Peter", he had thought through his triumph, "I am the
youngest Pope that has ever been elected, I am only thirty-seven
rears of age"&mdash;but now he wondered. He was so often ill; his
body was feeble, racked with ignoble pain; he suffered from
recurrent malaria, from deep ulcers, from
indigestion&mdash;perhaps, after all, he would not live longer than
most of his predecessors had lived, old men as they all had
been.</p>

<p>Leo picked up his spy-glass and peered at his nephew; Giulio was
strong, tall and lean, with long handsome Medici eyes and a fine,
classic profile. It was a pity, regretted the suave and courteous
Leo, that he had such a disagreeable exterior&mdash;so haughty an
air, so Harsh a voice.</p>

<p>The Cardinal, looking at him sideways, spoke:</p>

<p>"The King of France is of no use to anyone. He will lie and
cheat and deceive and always be laughing and gay. His word is
worthless, he is always playing a double game."</p>

<p>Leo thought of the last dispatches from the Emperor&mdash;bitter
foe of François, with whom he was keeping in constant
touch&mdash;and sucked in his loose lips.</p>

<p>"We all do that, my Giulio&mdash;there is no living on other
terms. The question is how cleverly can you do it. You, for
instance, I think, could be very clumsy."</p>

<p>He set his elbows on the table and put his fat hands before his
aching, bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell the pages to come and take away the food. I want to sleep,
yet I know it is of no use laying my head on the pillow&mdash;my
mind is too full of stupid matters. Why are we plagued with all
this intricacy of policy? Can you or I, or that King of France, or
that young Bourbon who commands thousands of men, or any of us,
really understand what we should be at, what other people are at?
What is the malady that ails Europe?"</p>

<p>"We all want our own way," replied Giulio de Medici dryly. "No
man will give up what he has and every man wants more than he has.
You at least should be satisfied&mdash;you are at the summit of all
ambition."</p>

<p>"But I wonder if I were not happier," mused Leo, "when I was in
Florence, a young boy. It is true that I was a Cardinal by the time
I was thirteen, but then I understood very little about
anything&mdash;the world seemed free and joyous&mdash;yes, one did
seem really free, as if one could do and say what one liked, as if
it didn't matter about deceiving people or making a good
impression. I did not have much money, but what I had I could spend
as I wished. I did not think of the Jews and the bankers, and how
my debts were piling up. It has always, you know, Giulio," he added
rapidly, "been impossible for me to save. If life is not splendid
it is to me meaningless. I am glad that I shall see Florence again
in a few days when we return to Rome. But perhaps," he added with a
sigh, "it will be for the last time."</p>

<p>In this moment of fatigue he was deeply homesick for his
father's country house at Caffagiolo. He had often stayed there
with his brothers and sisters&mdash;two gay, brilliant brothers and
four charming little sisters, Lucrezia, Maddalena, Contessina, and
Luisa. They had once been in that retreat a long time, quietly
living like the children of a country gentleman after the
conspiracy of the Pazzi, when Giuliano, his uncle, and this
Cardinal Guilio's father, had been murdered.</p>

<p>How high and tranquil it was up there in the Tuscan
mountain!</p>

<p>The Pope recalled the thin, keen air of the Apennines&mdash;the
shepherds and their white, curled flocks; the dark, dry, fragrant
pine trees tossing against the clear sky, or the pure, thick
curdling Clouds, the distant azure mountain; the elegant
grandmother and the tutor, Messer Angelo Poliziano, in his great
coat and slippers by thy sweet wood fire discussing the rival
merits of a biblical and a classical education, and he, Giovanni,
coming in hungry and smelling the good soup&mdash;ah, well, it was
gone!</p>

<p>Leo took his hands from his puffy eyes and rose heavily, leaning
at once upon the arm of the page in the Medici livery who stood
ready to support his gross weight. Indigestion had followed the
rapid eating of his late meal, his forehead was pearled with sweat,
and his gross features trembled; but Giulio looked at him with
understanding and sympathy, for he knew his cousin to be, in his
way, a great man; one who had worked hard, behaved well, and always
been loyal to his House.</p>

<p>"Giulio," sighed the Pope, "I wish that those two&mdash;the King
of France and the Emperor, who are continually provoking wars out
of pride and spite&mdash;would destroy each other, and leave us in
peace. Peace, peace, Giulio what could we not do if we had an
eternal peace! Think of the money there would be to spend on
spectacles, feasting, and building some churches and palaces, and
on our monument in San Lorenzo."</p>

<p>"That goes on very slowly," replied the Cardinal. "Michael
Angelo does not like the work. He is always grumbling, and I think
he does not make the haste he might. It is costing a great deal of
money. The last time I went there it looked empty as a northern
dawn."</p>

<p>"It must be the grey stone," sighed Leo, moving slowly and
painfully towards his bed with the emblazoned tester, still leaning
on the slim and upright form of the page. "It must be that grey
stone, Giulio, the <i>pietra serena</i>, that is rarely found. I
wonder who will be the first to lie there. I wonder whose funeral
statue Michael Angelo will carve first."</p>

<p>He seated himself on the chair beside his canopied bed, and the
page, dropping on one knee, removed his loose, easy slippers and
the fine wool stockings from his cold, spindly legs.
"François wanted 'The Laocoön'," gasped the Pope, Whose
breath had become short. "Consider, he had that insolence! Remember
that we send tomorrow to Rome to Bandinelli, to make a copy of it,
exact as possible, to be sent immediately to France. Of course, I
intended to do that from the first&mdash;the insolence of it! And I
shall have to hide the original group so that no one sees it who
comes here to the Vatican." sighed and with his own hands pulled
off his cap, revealing his large pink head faintly covered with
golden hairs. "Giulio, do not you wish we were in Rome watching
Raffaello paint his frescoes? Ah, me! They say haggling is in our
blood, but I do not like it. After all, what are we bargaining for
with these upstart conquerors, as they call themselves?"</p>

<p>"We are bargaining and haggling, I suppose," said Giulio
harshly, "just in order that we may go back to Rome and watch
Raffaello paint his frescoes, and have a palace in which he can
paint and some credit on which to draw the money to pay him and his
assistants and for all their materials."</p>

<p>"Those, Raffaello and Michael Angelo Buonarroti, are the really
great men, and we are nothing compared to them," said Leo. He swung
his clumsy body into the bed and drew the fine linen sheets and
thick wool blankets and embroidered quilts up to his chin.
"Nothing, I tell you, nothing!"</p>

<p>"But if we did not provide the means, what would happen to them?
They would have no walls to paint, no one for whom to build a
mausoleum, they would not be able even to buy paints or
marble."</p>

<p>"I will try to sleep now, Giulio. Leave the night-light burning.
My Laocoön group! Imagine, he had the insolence to ask for
that!"</p>

<p>The Pope tried to console himself by staring at the splendour of
the female griffins who, holding up shields with the arms of the
Medici, supported his crimson Canopies.</p>

<p>The Duc de Bourbon dismissed all his attendants and sat alone in
the handsome room assigned to him in the Piazza Pubblica in
Bologna. The King would return to Paris; he, the Connétable,
would be left in Milan, shut up there in the stern Northern city
with the white cathedral, that looked like frost flowers in the
centre and the white frontier mountains round it, far away from his
own domain, from those two women whom he loved, who loved him.</p>

<p>As Leo had felt homesick for Florence, so Charles felt homesick
for the Bourbonnais; but he remembered his childhood with
dislike&mdash;there had been so much to learn, the toil had been
incessant; tutors and masters all day long, everything done by the
clock, half an hour for Latin, half an hour for Humanism, an hour's
riding, an hour's fencing, a meal where he had to sit silent while
someone read a learned book aloud to him, the laws of France and
the laws of the Bourbonnais to get by rote, elaborate games to
learn and all the intricate laws of hunting and falconry, the
rituals of the Church to learn, the lives of the saints and long
Latin prayers.</p>

<p>Charles had been taught patiently, sedulously, how to dress, how
to walk, how to ride, how to defend himself, courtesy towards
women, civility towards his inferiors, pride towards his superiors;
since he had been a few years old the greatest possible trouble had
been taken with him because he was heir to such great
possessions.</p>

<p>Chiara Gonzaga, his Italian mother, sister of the Marchese of
Mantua, had early found this task too difficult; she had returned
to her pleasant Southern home leaving him in the hands of the old
Duke and Duchess of Bourbon, whose estates he was to inherit, and
they had never faltered from what they considered their severe
duty&mdash;that of training, training, training this young man to
be great and set high over other men.</p>

<p>In this bedroom in a foreign town he threw off all festival
garments and stood in a brown chamber-robe edged with fur, and
stretched his long limbs and wondered if he had been educated only
that he might come to Italy as a conqueror to destroy.</p>

<p>All he cared about was beauty, and he had been destroying beauty
ever since he was fifteen years of age, leading armies over
devastated fields, watching men sack and plunder towns, leading men
in battle where many were slain and mutilated, men, animals, and
the women and children who followed the warriors.</p>

<p>Charles went to the window and pulled aside the saffron-coloured
curtains suspended from ivory rings, hung in front of clustered
marble pillars; he looked out into the street, which was lit by a
winter moon, and a wild longing for another life than his own life,
or perhaps for another death than his own death would be, absorbed
him; he wished he were back in Rome; this longing was the same as
the longing expressed by the Pope, who slept in the other chamber
near at hand&mdash;to be away in Rome, watching Raffaello paint his
frescoes and Michael Angelo chip his marble.</p>

<p>The young Frenchman yearned for Rome, for those gold and tawny
ruins, that yellow river, the dark foliage of laurel and ilex
rising above broken pillars twisted with the eglantine and
clematis, the ivy and the bryony, those flocks of birds which, when
they rose high overhead, seemed angels returning to Paradise, those
airy churches and palaces where the architects and painters played
with space as lesser men played with ornaments, arranging space,
dividing it, setting it there between arches and colonnades to the
infinite peace and comfort of the spectator; he wished that he
could return to the beggar man who played at being a hermit on the
hills of the Palatine close to the Caesars' ancient palace, whose
hut was a wattle wall round a summer-house where ancient Patrician
ladies had once sat and smiled away the golden evenings.</p>

<p>What a delicious sensation that had been, climbing up, up past
the fallen blocks of marble, past the fresh and clustered weeds,
past the feeding goats with their tinkling bells, until he had
reached the summit&mdash;that grove of trees whose tops seemed to
touch the sky, that fragment of yellow masonry, where he had sat
and seen Rome, the half-fabulous city, the crown of the world!</p>

<p>Charles envied the Pope, who would return to Rome and live in
his sumptuous palace directing his painters and his architects,
watching his clear, grey tomb grow from day to day, precise,
slow-forming, and delicate as a lily standing under water.</p>

<p>But these were sick dreams; Charles must take his archers, his
Switzers, his cavalry, his men-at-arms, and ride to Milan, to hold
it against the Emperor, who, he had heard, was a man like himself,
caring nothing for war but absorbed in all the arts that
please.</p>

<p>Charles clasped his thin hands in prayer and dropped on his
knees on the <i>prie-dieu</i> that had been placed between the
windows; the night air blowing in where he had drawn the curtains
lifted back his heavy locks as he prayed, the prayer of one who
does not believe, yet for his soul's sake must try to do so:</p>

<p>"O God, why must we fight, why must we have these wars and
battles, building up only to trample down, sowing only to tear up
the harvest, making beauty only to defile it?"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It was late before François returned to his chamber; he
had been behind the stage set up in the great painted <i>salon</i>,
where, seated amidst gauzy curtains which fell from the flies, was
the Fair Supplicant and Venus, clothed in the tenderest, rosiest
purple gauzes with imitation pearls and silver horns in their fair
hair; they were expecting him and greeted him with little amused
signs of laughter and pale, outstretched hands.</p>

<p>The woman from Siena with the amber-coloured hair, who had taken
the part of Venus, reminded François of Mademoiselle de
Pissleu, one of the mistresses who had been found and trained for
him by his adroit mother Louise, and who was one of the most
charming creatures that he had ever seen. The other, who had taken
the part of the Fair Supplicant, was merry and bold and asked him
impertinent questions about his Queen, Claude; everyone knew that
she was plain, silly, and deformed, and that he had only married
her because she was the daughter of old, sad Bing Louis, who had
hated him; who was dead at last.</p>

<p>Behind his brilliant smiling he was quietly vexed because the
Italian women seemed to make but small account of his regal favours
and to regard him as some forward, amusing boy. They talked
continually of Rome, where they wished to return; they were both
posing as models for the nymphs in the bathroom of Cardinal
Bibbiena, which was to be one of the most gorgeous of the smaller
chambers in the sumptuous new palace in the Vatican. They talked of
Rome in their sweet language, in their sweet voices, until the
young conqueror himself became discontented and wanted to see the
Golden City and to live there.</p>

<p>But he consoled himself, with his fingers to his long nose, by
saying:</p>

<p>"I am to have 'The Laocoön', you know&mdash;the most
beautiful piece of statuary that has ever been discovered in Rome
is to be mine. I shall put it in my palace at Fontainebleau."</p>

<p>The pale, round-faced girls had laughed merrily so that the
false pearls, dripping like dew-drops, like lily-bells on their
piled tresses, had mingled delicately together. François did
not like to recall that laughter; once or twice amid all the
feasting and the flattery he had thought that these sly Italians
had laughed at him. Yet he was the victor, the conqueror. No, that
was not true: Charles the Connétable had won Marignano, and
everyone knew it; it was Charles who had forced young Massimiliano
Sforza to surrender the famous <i>castello</i> of <i>Il Moro</i>
and Cremona. Yes, he, the King, had been much praised when he had
established his Court in Milan, but everyone had known that it was
Charles who had gained the city that had been the lure to bring
three Kings of France into Italy. François reflected, as his
page unlaced his shirt of gold tissue, that he did not like, nay,
that he hated, Charles, who was too great for a subject, too
wealthy, too magnificent, too haughty and handsome.</p>

<p>François yawned as he kicked off his purple shoes; he had
wanted to be a hero, like Gaston de Foix, a peerless knight like
Bayard, and Charles had stolen his fame, his renown, his title of
conqueror.</p>

<p>Some incidents stuck in the King's mind, as thorns will stick in
the tender flesh. When in Milan he had tried to lure Donna Brogina
from the Convent of Gioto, believed to be the fairest woman in
Italy, and she had returned an insolent message to his entreaties:
"If I came to Milan for anyone, it would not be for François
de Valois, but for the victor of Marignano, the Connétable
of France." François bathed his hands and face with
rose-water. There was winter silence in the streets of Bologna; the
leaning towers, their shadows dark in the moonlight, rose against
the snow clouds. In the palace was silence also, the silence of
fatigue, of brooding uneasy thought, of disturbed sleep.</p>

<p>"Charles must go," said François suddenly, looking up
from the fine linen and smiling at his long face, hung with drops
of rose-water, reflected in the round steel mirror; then he laughed
gaily at himself. How could he rid himself of Charles, who was his
most able general, his most powerful subject? It was not to be
thought of. Charles would remain in Italy as Governor of Milan; but
the two women&mdash;Louise, the King's mother, Marguerite, the
King's sister&mdash;would think of some way whereby their Caesar,
their Phoebus, their Jason, their demigod, could rid himself of
Charles Monsieur. François slept on his down pillows,
breathing lightly, his curled mouth twitching under his long nose;
at the end of the tall bed the French pages slept, before the door
the French sentries paced, in the antechamber the guards kept
watch, alert, for this was treacherous Italy.</p>

<p>Under the red canopy, upheld by the elegant female griffins, the
Pope snored and tossed; the air of his room was that of a
sick-chamber sharpened by drugs and spices; in his ante-rooms the
physicians nodded over the charcoal fire that a black boy kept
fanning with an eagle's wing.</p>

<p>On a low couch, in an alcove near, slept Giulio de' Medici. On
the tasselled stool beside him was a costly toy: a crystal-bodied
mermaid with a pearl tail, enamelled face and hair, and a belt of
star stones; the Cardinal had bought this from the work-shop of
Benvenuto Cellini before he left Rome. The stage stood empty before
the empty thrones in the great <i>salon</i>; Raffaello's painted
perspective scene, canvas and linen, fluttered in the night air;
torn paper, tinsel, broken sweets and cakes lay along the floor; in
the circular stands were gathered stumps of candles; shadows lay
where the crowd had pressed, mice ran over the boards where the
fair, half-nude women had posed; some paper flowers had been cast
down on the Papal throne, and on that of the King of France was a
paper of comfits.</p>

<p>In closets off the stage slept the models for Venus and Diana,
for Juno and the Virgin, with coverlets pulled up to their chins,
their amber Siennese locks falling down under the crushed coronals
of false pearls and silver-tissue roses and stars.</p>

<p>Between his windows with saffron curtains Charles knelt at his
<i>prie-dieu</i> and shivered in the chill wind that crept in
between the clustered pillars, under the folds of silk; his hollow
face was serene, his large eyes closed as he prayed, as he had been
taught to pray, to a God who sat beyond the sun and guided the
affairs of men.</p>

<p>Charles prayed that he might have an heir, that he might be
healed of his hatred for the King, that he might find peace.
Suddenly he opened his eyes and turned his head sharply; he thought
that he had heard his door open, and as he stared across the
strange chamber lit only by the single night taper, it seemed as if
that white funeral procession of dead children, ermine lilies, ice,
satin, entered the room and, passing upwards, vanished.</p>

<p class="first">
THE snow had fallen heavily at Moulins. The massive round towers
and sloping roofs of the great château, covered with sparkling
crystal-white, seemed to be absorbed into the blankness of the
colourless sky. The white Bourbon flag with the motto
<i>Espérance</i> hung heavily rimed with frost from the
highest turret. The wide landscape was frozen, there was neither
light, colour, nor movement on the earth, and from the heavens only
the pale glow that fell from a sky dappled like the breast of a
pale-grey goose.</p>

<p>The bedchamber of the <i>Châtelaine</i> was white also. Suzanne
de Bourbon lay in a tall, silver bed, draped with the finest linens
and silks innocent of dye or pattern; her pallid face was swathed
in white lawn, which hid all her hair; she wore a white silk robe,
which covered her thin throat and slightly deformed shoulders. The
hood of the alabaster chimney-piece rose to the roof and bore the
arms of Bourbon; on the hearth the thick, orange-coloured logs
sprinkled with aromatics gave out a delicious perfume and clear,
ragged flames, which brightly lit and tinged with gold the pale
furnishings of the chamber.</p>

<p>In a silver cradle on a little brocade-covered dais at the foot
of the bed lay the heir of the House of Bourbon who would unite the
claims of Suzanne and her husband Charles to the greatest property
in Europe that was not an empire or a kingdom.</p>

<p>Everything in the chamber was pure, clean, and precise; nothing
disorderly or offensive was permitted, nothing loud or harsh or
unseemly.</p>

<p>Suzanne de Bourbon was as well trained as her husband; she
filled her high place as gracefully as a stone statue occupied its
niche high on the façade of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Her husband sat by her bedside holding his thin hands open on
the soft coverlet; they were full of pearls that he had brought for
the mother of his little son. She sat propped up against linen
pillows and looked from the pearls to her husband with a deep and
gentle tenderness; she loved him for everything he had and was, for
his valiant soul, for his fine nature touched with weakness, for
his fastidious taste, for all his graces and accomplishments, for
his lean dark face with the lean cheeks and straight black eyebrows
and the long locks of lank black hair.</p>

<p>"There is no reason," she mused, "why we should not be happy for
ever and ever."</p>

<p>Her mother sat on the other side of the bed, Anne de Beaujeu,
daughter of Louis XI, and Duchess of Bourbon, who had ruled the
whole kingdom wisely, patiently, graciously. In her pale, clear-cut
garments she had the dignity of a nun or a saint, but her smiling,
haggard face had the grace and charm of worldliness. For three
years the two women and the man had lived in reserved contentment
on their wide lands, going in stately procession from one castle to
another, looking to their revenues, administering justice, running
their great households carefully, with economy and dignity.</p>

<p>It was three years since Charles had been suddenly recalled by
the King from Milan, ordered to lay down his command, his
governorship, and come home; the thing had been unprecedented, an
unexplained affront but, without protest, Charles, no longer
holding any post save the nominal one of Connétable, had
withdrawn silently to his own estates, which comprised almost a
third of France, and so had lived unmolested. Now there was the
male child, some months old, it seemed that none of them had
anything else to wish for.</p>

<p>There had been some doubt, some question, some parley about the
claim of Charles to the Bourbonnais; some thought that Suzanne had
had the better right, being daughter of the last Duke of
Bourbon&mdash;and so her wise parents had married her to Charles
and trained him to be her lord and master of her lands. That little
pricking fear, like an unseen flame spitting in the dark, was now
gone; there lay the heir in his silver cradle&mdash;none could
dispute his right. The King was coming to the festival of
Christmas. They began to discuss that, the three of them, in low
tones. Suzanne put her perfumed hands out for the pearls, and
turned them over on the coverlet.</p>

<p>These three people were in perfect harmony; they were of the
same race, the same caste, the same great House; identical
traditions, hopes, likes, dislikes, loves, and hatreds influenced
them. They understood each other without many words being used;
Charles spoke slowly, easing his mind by a delicate pattern of
sentences that seemed to weave to and fro between his wife and his
wife's mother as a shuttle charged with fine silk is thrown across
the loom.</p>

<p>The burden of his discourse was, "I hate François and
François hates me, and he is the King."</p>

<p>Both the women knew the bitterness that could be added to that.
François was King by chance, not King in the direct line;
they all of them thought of those white regal christenings and
white funerals that Charles had seen in the vision of the infernal
masquerade in Rome. How different it would have been for all of
them if King Louis had had a living son! They could not rid their
minds of the feeling that François de Valois, bred in
poverty, in doubt and apprehension, trained by a frivolous,
vicious, unscrupulous woman, was an upstart and no true heir to
King Louis.</p>

<p>Charles poured the pearls in and out of his fingers on his
wife's coverlet.</p>

<p>"I sometimes think," he said, "that one of us must go, but
perhaps when I say that I put it too subtly. What I mean is that he
is determined that I shall go."</p>

<p>Suzanne sighed on her swan's-down pillow.</p>

<p>Anne de Beaujeu said with an ironic smile:</p>

<p>"It is certainly dangerous for us to be placed so high and to
have such great possessions."</p>

<p>"The King owes me," said Charles, "an immense fortune. I have
asked for it again and again. How many times does he think I am to
equip his armies at my expense? I have never even had the sixty
thousand livres the old King owed me. He would have paid had he
lived."</p>

<p>"So much fatigue for nothing," whispered Suzanne, "fighting
other men's quarrels! You are too fine for that, Charles."</p>

<p>Her young husband did not answer. His mind went back to the
great festivities held at Tours, soon after his own marriage, when
he had been a boy of fifteen. The pageantry had been to celebrate
the betrothal of François d'Angoulême to the daughter of the
King, and he, Charles, had been wounded in a tournament; there had
been rivalries between the two boys then and they had never
ceased.</p>

<p>Two years later Charles, at seventeen years of age, had joined
the ageing King in the Italian expedition. They had started at
Eastertide, he remembered; it had been a fine year, the land had
seemed like a bouquet of flowers.</p>

<p>It had been interesting to learn the art of war; but he had been
plagued for the first time by fits of tertian ague. Another two
years and he had been a general in the League of Cambrai against
Venice; he was victorious at the battle of Agnadello. It was during
that expedition that he had spent the sixty thousand livres which
King Louis did not offer to repay. He was too disinterested and in
his mind too fastidious to dwell on the quarrels that had followed
with the fierce old Pope, the Spanish, and the insolent
English.</p>

<p>He recalled the sharp disappointment with which he had
discovered the hollowness of King Louis' affection; the old King
had asked him to lead eight hundred lances and seven thousand
infantry to regain lost Italy&mdash;it was a suggestion of suicide
for himself and his men, and there had been cold looks from the
King and ungracious slights when he had refused to lead so many
soldiers to humiliation and disaster.</p>

<p>Soon after the King had been broken down by the news of the
battle of Novara and the flight of the French across the Mont
Cenis, and then he, Charles, had been blamed because he had not
gone to Italy...</p>

<p>Charles checked himself nervously:</p>

<p>"My mind keeps dwelling on the past." He smiled to his wife. "It
is useless now to think of these things.</p>

<p>"Anne of France said:</p>

<p>"Does not this give you comfort?" She pointed her thin, white
hand down to the silver cradle where his heir lay swaddled in silk
and covered with cloth.</p>

<p>Charles smiled and pressed his wife's finger, which lay over the
pearls on the coverlet. It was a marvel, the doctors and the wise
women had said, that the slight, twisted, almost deformed body of
Suzanne de Bourbon had been able to bear one child. If he lost the
infant! To his anxious eyes the little creature seemed frail and
silent; he could hardly believe the eager reassurances of the women
that the little Comte de Clermont was really a fine, healthy child,
that his fragile Suzanne would ever bear another infant.</p>

<p>"Do not look so sad," implored his wife. "Was not peace signed
last year? When all these noisy pageantries are over and the King
and his mother have gone, we will go to Chantelle, where it is
quiet&mdash;with the children."</p>

<p>"Would we could live there for ever!" sighed Charles, "would
that the peace could endure for ever! But look at Europe, as if it
were a peep-show, see all these strong yet helpless figures blown
about in the tumults of fear and greed, and wonder if there can be
peace! What of the young King of Spain, the Archduke Charles, the
Emperor's grandson&mdash;I think often of him. He is only a boy,
but wise; his mother is a madwoman, the worse for that!"</p>

<p>Charles picked the pearls up and then let them fall back again
on to the coverlet. They held the pale, fresh colours of the winter
skies and the untrodden snow without, the pallor of his wife's
exhausted face. Everything in the room was white, as if the winter
were inflected there&mdash;yes, even under the glow of the log fire
now sinking on the marble hearth that whiteness seemed
complete.</p>

<p>"The King has had no work for me since I was recalled from
Italy&mdash;and why was I recalled?" he asked moodily, with the air
of a man who turns over a bitter, half-understood grief. "Did I not
do well enough in Milan?"</p>

<p>"It was his jealousy," said Anne of France, "his spite, his
mother's vindictiveness, his sister's malice. You must be where the
King is, you must show you are as magnificent and as powerful as he
is, that you are as beloved in France, that you own nearly as much
land as he does, that your people are loyal to you, that you can
command everything, knights, men-at-arms, horses, treasure."</p>

<p>"Would it not be dangerous," pleaded Suzanne, "for Charles to
challenge the King? His mother? His sister?"</p>

<p>"It would be more dangerous for him to hide away. In the Valois
we deal with one who is swift, plausible, and utterly treacherous.
He will promise anything and never keep his word."</p>

<p>"Eh, I know! I know!" said Charles with a low laugh.</p>

<p>He rose, went to the window and pulled aside the thick woollen
curtains, and looked out on to the smooth fields of snow. "Add him,
add them to the figures you see in your peep-show, madame, this
dark fox from France, this astute young man in Spain trained to be
an Emperor! Maximilian is dead, they say And Charles has no grip on
affairs. And what do you see in England? Henry Tudor, a lusty,
arrogant, vain man with a mighty fortune behind him. Then the Pope!
Does he mean peace? I have never forgotten him&mdash;a powerful and
a treacherous man, with his Medici Cardinal for ever at his
ear."</p>

<p>Charles turned and looked at Anne of France, a person who
influenced him more than any other, in whom he believed and whom he
trusted above every other human being.</p>

<p>"I have no heart to take part in this game," he said; "let me
give it up, let me retreat to Chantelle, or some such place, and do
all that is Within my power to placate the King. Let me not solicit
for any more posts, either about the Court or in the Army. I will
not provoke François by magnificence or even by asking for
the money which he owes me..." His voice faltered and then ceased
under the pitying gaze of those clear pale eyes.</p>

<p>The old stateswoman sat grey and implacable.</p>

<p>"You cannot escape from your destiny, Charles. You are among
those who are born to rule. When you married Suzanne, when I
obtained for you the dignity of Duke of Bourbon, the head of my
family, you took on responsibilities which you must not evade."</p>

<p>Charles let the curtain fall across the snowy prospect and
turned back into the room:</p>

<p>"What then do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Put aside all your fantasies, Charles, and act the part that
has been assigned to you."</p>

<p>He laughed with that sudden gaiety which transformed his sombre
face into great charm, and lifting his slim shoulders kissed his
finger-tips to his wife, then to her mother, and left the white,
fire-lit chamber.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Suzanne lay very still. She too had her dreams, but stronger
than these was her desire to do her duty, to love and to serve her
husband and bear him children. More precious to her than all her
resplendent possessions was her little son; she hoped that she
might have many children to consolidate the great heritage she had
brought her lord; she had longed so passionately for this child;
she had prayed for him so constantly that she had been exhausted at
the hour of his birth and hardly able to rejoice in this great
blessing that had seemed to have been sent to her from the Mother
of Heaven, like a white flower, a white daisy, dropped from the
Virgin's coronal. She hoped and waited for other children, another
son, if God willed.</p>

<p>She half closed her tired eyes, and all the pearls on her bed
seemed to her to be changed to daisies; she thought of the spring
and fields and fields of daisies. They said that her foot, little
as it was, could cover three daisies at a time&mdash;how many
daisies were there then in all those acres she could see from her
window stretching to the horizon where, blending into the blue
veils of distance, they looked like snow! This vision was an
expression of her own soul, which was pure and precise like the
daisy that grows lowly and fragrant amid the clear-cut green leaves
and is trodden underfoot and raises its resilient head again.</p>

<p>She opened her large, pale-grey eyes. If only it would please
God to make her stronger from these constant illnesses; she felt
her spirit running through her body in a desperate urgency to
action and then flickering down again, leaving her exhausted on her
wide pillow.</p>

<p>"Tell me, mother, is the child really strong?"</p>

<p>Anne of France smiled compassionately.</p>

<p>"How often do you ask me that? You should ask the Madonna and
the Saints who sent the blessing&mdash;all have done what they
can."</p>

<p>"You mean that he is not strong. Sometimes weakly children have
lived. How seldom he moves or cries out! They say the Queen's boy
wails all day&mdash;the Queen is as feeble as I am."</p>

<p>Then Suzanne was silent, wondering why God, who took such pains
with the flowers, even little daisies, permitted some women to be
deformed, misshapen, pale, and twisted as a leaf stripped from a
rose that is cankered at the heart.</p>

<p>Anne rose and took the stool beside her daughter's bed. She
never sat in an easy chair nor assumed any but a rigid yet graceful
upright attitude. She began to talk to her daughter of the aviary
and menagerie, how the animals and birds were being kept warm
during the winter, and how impressed the King and his mother would
be when they saw the splendours of Moulins.</p>

<p>Suzanne did not listen.</p>

<p>"I had to be silent when you gave me that advice, mother, but I
too was fearful. I do not want Charles to compete with the King,
the Emperor, the Pope. I want us to be at peace always, to live
together in some pleasant place."</p>

<p>The mother put her hand over her daughter's trembling mouth,
silencing her with a serene, patient look.</p>

<p>"You are not well, Suzanne. See, I have brought you your
book&mdash;this always soothes you."</p>

<p>She laid on the bed the manuscript book <i>L'Enseignement</i>,
which had been made especially for the young Duchess, and adorned,
according to her instructions, with miniatures of herself and her
lord and the arms and mottoes of the House of Bourbon.</p>

<p>Anne of France put her long finger on one of these last,
<i>Espérance</i>.</p>

<p>"Hope," she said. "You are too fearful, and I am grieved that
Charles is fearful too."</p>

<p>Suzanne flushed and bit her lips, dry and ragged from fever.</p>

<p>"He has had great misfortune," she said hurriedly. "He has heavy
dreams, too, the fever&mdash;yes, we both have fever too often. I
dream of dead people&mdash;Charles's father Gilbert, and his
brother Louis, lying in the same tomb at Pozzuoli."</p>

<p>She raised herself up on her thin elbows and looked at her
mother with glittering eyes.</p>

<p>"Last night I dreamt of my father's funeral&mdash;all those
people, seventeen thousand of them, following his bier to
Sauvigny&mdash;and I thought some day I too must go that same
journey."</p>

<p>"Hush," said Anne of France, "no weakening! Have I trained you
to shudder at the thought of death? Yes, you and I and Charles,
that child in the cradle there, must all go to Sauvigny. And I must
go soon enough, I do not doubt&mdash;I am an old woman and I have
done my work. But you have many years&mdash;you should dream of
life, not of death. Remember you are my heiress, heiress of
Bourbon."</p>

<p>Suzanne looked curiously at her mother, so saintly, yet so
proud, the daughter of the great King, the eleventh Louis.</p>

<p>"You think a great deal of that, do you not, mother? our names,
our possessions? I can tell by the way you say them," she smiled.
"Valois, Bourbon&mdash;they are like jewels to you. And the titles
of our estates, the Bourbonnais, Auvergne, Le Forez, Beaujolais,
Les Dombes, Clermont en Beauvois, Marche, Gien, Ardèche! Ah, yes,
you like to see your dukedoms, countships, lordships
emblazoned!"</p>

<p>"You have never attached enough importance to these dignities
that were given to us that we might endeavour to merit them."</p>

<p>"I cannot feel it so. Sometimes it seems to me that I am no more
than the little peasant girl I see carrying sticks in the woods. I
rose from bed last night and peeped out of the window, and there
was the wood-cutter going home, warmly wrapped up, with his
children behind him and a little lantern hanging at the end of a
faggot. And I could see through the bare trees across the snow the
tiny light in their window, and I thought I would that I and
Charles and the baby were there&mdash;it seemed more like home than
this castle, more like home indeed than any of our castles. I never
feel so high up, mother, like an eagle in an eyrie next to the sun,
but rather as if I were one of those modest brown birds that hop
among the daisies."</p>

<p>She lifted the pearls from her coverlet and put them on the
large gold salver that stood on the table by her bed.</p>

<p>"I like those because Charles brought them&mdash;if they had
been daisies I had valued them as much."</p>

<p>The tired eyes of Anne of France gazed at her daughter keenly.
Suzanne de Bourbon was also the child of long expectancy, of
passionate prayer she was also the child of parents well on in age,
who had given up all hope of issue, the frail and feeble flower of
two Withered branches. As if a cold breath of the veering wind that
had risen outside had entered that white, golden apartment and
struck at her heart, Anne of France shivered. If Suzanne should
die! If the child should die! There would be only Charles; the next
heir was Louise, the King's mother.</p>

<p>"When does the King come?" sighed Suzanne.</p>

<p>"The harbingers were here today, some of the heralds, too.
Perhaps tomorrow. However ill you feel, my daughter, you must rise
and put on some gorgeous gown and make this festival splendid."</p>

<p>"I wish he would pay Charles all that money he owes him. It is
not easy for us to keep up this magnificence; even with our
revenue, are debts never to be paid?" Suzanne turned restlessly on
her pillow and again sat up, leaning on her elbows.</p>

<p>"You know, mother, that Louise, the King's mother, loves my
husband?"</p>

<p>"Love is not the word, Suzanne. I know that she desires him and
his fortune. But you, as far as she is concerned, are
invulnerable."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Suzanne simply, "and should be, even if I did
not bring these titles and these lands to him. Is not that curious,
mother, that he really loves me as much as if I were beautiful?
Every man who went to Italy, I think, found some woman fairer than
the wife or mistress he had left at home but Charles, no! All for
me!..."</p>

<p>"Some men are like that, with high heart and faithful mind."</p>

<p>"Yet he loves beauty, too."</p>

<p>"And you to him are beautiful. You must always understand that!
To him you are beautiful. Do not be too humble. You are his daisy,
his pearl, his angel, and his prayer."</p>

<p>"If we were not here, what could Louise not do to Charles! She
would have him or ruin him&mdash;the King can deny her
nothing."</p>

<p>"She has ruined the King, her Caesar, as she calls him. See how
spoilt, impulsive, impetuous, and false he is, idle and
vicious&mdash;woman-trained."</p>

<p>"But the people love him."</p>

<p>"Yes. He pleases the peasants and the traders because he is
bold, gay and lavish with his money. See what he has squandered on
Guillaume de Bonnivet, while Charles must beg in vain for his
dues!"</p>

<p>The two women sat silent, not noticing how chill dusk was
encroaching on the fading twilight. Everything in the white room
was faintly tinged by the dying flames on the wide hearth. Their
minds went to the past and forward to the future; they were both
heavy with the burdens of love and duty, each concerned and
troubled by the great affairs in which she had but little part.</p>

<p>What could they do, the women, among the monstrous figures of
Kings and Popes and Emperors? It was all very well to say that they
influenced the men, that the King of France was still tied to his
mother's apron strings, that the Connétable would not move
unless his wife or mother gave him leave; when it came to the
point, the men did exactly as they liked, they followed out their
own ambitions, lusts, and cruelties, and the women had to sit at
home and wait and pretend to be content.</p>

<p>That young man in Spain, the Archduke Charles, who was now
Emperor. He was free from all women now, but a woman, his aunt, had
trained him austerely, with infinite skill and patience, as Anne of
France had trained Charles de Montpensier. It was known that he,
the late Emperor's grandson, had spent huge sums of money to become
Emperor of the West&mdash;a high-sounding but empty title. What was
a peace signed on a scrap of paper against two such strong
ambitions?</p>

<p>The two women felt nervous and restless, as if the air were
already full of the sound of trumpets and the shouts of war, and
across the peaceful chamber in the flickering firelight passed the
shadows of hundreds of banners surging to and from the Alps down on
to the sunny plains of Italy where already so many Frenchmen had
rotted in their armour; back again into retreat, forward again into
revenge&mdash;all for nothing that women understood or valued.</p>

<p>Suzanne absently turned over the pages of her beautiful
hand-painted book, which seldom failed to give her pleasure but
which now she saw dimly as if through the tears that blur and
magnify.</p>

<p>A sudden harsh clangour of noise outside their room roused both
the women sharply. Anne of France went to the window and peered out
into the cold blueness of the night; the scarlet and orange flare
of flambeaux was in the courtyard. The wind tore out the flames
like banners and stirred the icy folds of the Bourbon flag on the
<i>Tour mal coiffée</i>.</p>

<p>"Someone is arriving," she said, "sooner than we expected. Yes,
it must be Madame Louise. Why has she come so early, even before
her son?"</p>

<p>"Louise is here?" asked Suzanne, putting down her rich book and
sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, those are her liveries, all that white and red&mdash;how
she plays upon it, making a frivolous elegance of her own colours!
She is there in her ermine and brocade, in her gilt litter. More
luxury than the King can afford! Will she never have done with
lovers and vanities? There is Madame Marguerite too, her daughter.
She is very elegant and very clever, but where her brother is
concerned she is a fool!"</p>

<p>Anne dropped the curtain and returned to her daughter's white
bedside.</p>

<p>"You shall not receive them tonight, Suzanne. They should not
have come unexpectedly. I Will entertain them&mdash;rest
tonight."</p>

<p>"Tell Charles to entertain them," smiled Suzanne from her
pillow. "I do not mind if Louise tries to enchant him. Put the
cradle close beside my bed, mother, and leave the book here under
my hand. I shall be strong tomorrow, but now I want to sleep. Tell
the women to be ready in case I have the fever again&mdash;and do
not go far away."</p>

<p>Anne of France touched her daughter's high brow. The frail,
white-swathed head sank into the pillow; Suzanne de Bourbon closed
her large eyes and mused upon the fields of daisies stretching away
to the horizon where, when the flowerets met the blue sky, they
were white as snow.</p>

<p class="first">
THE King and his mother came again to Moulins; not Christmas
now, but Easter, would they spend with Anne de France and the
Connétable. The little Comte de Clermont was dead and taken
to Sauvigny. Suzanne de Bourbon waited for her cherished hope to be
fulfilled&mdash;for her second child to be born; but
François did not stay for these things. Moulins was the most
magnificent establishment in France after Fontainebleau, and Madame
Louise was very economical, for all her splendour, and liked to
keep these great festivals at another's expense.</p>

<p>So again the harbingers and heralds in red and white came to
Moulins, and all the great rooms were opened, hung with tapestry,
and strewn with rushes or laid with carpets; Anne de Beaujeu saw to
the ordering of food and drink, to the setting out of plate and
linen, mattresses, pillows and coverlets, to the instructing of
servants, and to the adornment of the chapel; all the golden
trappings for Easter were ready to replace the black draperies of
Lent.</p>

<p>Suzanne de Bourbon lay tranquilly in her white room. She could
count on the fingers of one hand the weeks that she had been able
to leave the room, since her last child was born; now the masons
laboured at the stone shields round his tomb in Sauvigny, and the
woollen shroud his father had given him was shut away in a coffin,
with his toys and swaddling clothes; Suzanne de Bourbon waited.</p>

<p>An altar was arranged in her room, which was kept wreathed with
fresh spring flowers and before which light burnt continually from
crystal lamps and candles of pure wax.</p>

<p>Doctors came and went in their long, furred robes and the
bird-like masks that now and there they dropped over their faces,
afraid of contagion; servants went softly about the château with
downcast looks, the peasants and the woodmen gave one another sly
glances as they passed in the fields and forests, and all the men
on the estates at Moulins looked up constantly at the flag on the
<i>Tour mal coiffée</i> as if they expected to see it, by
some supernatural agency, cast to the ground with broken staff and
tattered edge. The deepest misfortune seemed presaged by the death
of the little heir to the House of Bourbon and by the illness of
the Duchess on the eve of the birth of her second child.</p>

<p>Anne de Beaujeu Held bier head high as if she said, "My daughter
will live, her heir will be born." In her grey gown and smooth
linen scented from the bunches of violets that lay in the press
with her clothes, she looked, as she aged, more like her father's
queer Valois face, with the large nose and screwed-up eyes and the
expression of kindliness and shrewdness.</p>

<p>She held her state with undiminished splendour and abated
nothing of the ceremonies that she prepared for the reception of
the King and his mother, though in her heart she scorned them for
the lack of courtesy that brought them to a house that was half-way
between a child's funeral and a child's birth.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>On a glittering May day the young Duchess sent for her husband;
she had asked him not to come unless she sent for him. He had
guessed her reason. She was much changed, even her poor remnant of
beauty further despoiled; she was always suffering and she did not
wish him to see her in her humiliation. Attiring himself in a
parti-coloured dress of white and silver, as if he went to a
festival, and without any weapon, Charles went into his wife's
chamber and, not looking at her, knelt on the bedstep beside the
high white bed, the lights from the altar flickering on his dark
hair. He felt her fingers on his brow and heard her speak.</p>

<p>"Charles, I have thought what my death might mean to you."</p>

<p>"The loss of everything," he murmured, and pulled those small
fingers down from his forehead to his lips.</p>

<p>"Do not speak, my love, till I have said all I have to say." Her
voice sounded like that of one who spoke from a sleep, a dream.
"Were I to die, my Charles, there is something beside my love that
you would lose."</p>

<p>"All I am is through you," he replied; the scene was to him so
strange, the pale room, the sunshine showing in lines of gold where
the white curtains did not quite meet at the long window, that
shimmering, steady, flickering light of those thick wax candles and
small crystal lamps before a white statue round which the May
lilies wreathed.</p>

<p>"All I am is through you," he repeated, "and all I have I hold
through you."</p>

<p>"Charles, I have made my will. My mother and I have often spoken
of this. We have passed many days together during my sickness. You
know, Charles, that the world is strange to women, to women like me
at least. One can never understand why so much must threaten those
whom one loves."</p>

<p>"Nothing threatens me," he protested, looking up at last at
Suzanne's tired face.</p>

<p>"No man can say that, and you least of all."</p>

<p>He bit his lip to steady it, for she looked lifeless as a
withered white rose, her long face surrounded by folds of the
finest cambric, her shoulders covered with a cape of royal ermine,
the linen of the bed folded high across her breast; her arms,
slender as the stems of flowers, in tight sleeves of silver, lay on
the coverlet.</p>

<p>"The King," she breathed, "the King and the King's
mother&mdash;you know what they designed against us, Charles. If I
were to die I think that Madame Louise might claim all the
inheritance of the House of Bourbon, even during my mother's
life."</p>

<p>He clasped her hands close.</p>

<p>"The child&mdash;and the child, Suzanne!"</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he said under his breath,</p>

<p>"The child shall be born alive and you shall Live!"</p>

<p>He looked down into her face, across which the light from the
holy lamps flickered; her eyes were closed. Presently she
murmured:</p>

<p>"I am so tired, Charles. There is no more to say. Fetch my
mother."</p>

<p>He kissed her hands and left her, hurrying into the antechamber
where Anne of France waited. She was attended by two notaries.
Before Charles could speak she put between his hands a scroll, from
which hung five large seals at the end of scarlet ribbon. It was
the will. He lost Control of his voice, his movements. He began to
roll up the parchment in his fingers; tears reddened his eyes.</p>

<p>"What is all of this to me if I lose her?"</p>

<p>The stately old woman put her thin hands on his shoulders,
kissed his cheeks without speaking, then passed into her daughter's
bedchamber.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Two sounds simultaneously broke the quiet of the château of
Moulins on that spring afternoon: the sound of a cavalcade arriving
with laughter, high speech, shouting, servitors and pages in the
courtyard; and the sound of the women and the doctors hurrying
through the corridors that led to the Duchess Suzanne's chamber,
hurrying with piles of fresh linen, ewers and bowls of water, with
unguents and perfumes and urns, the sound of the feet of the
priests and the acolytes bearing the Host to the dying woman.</p>

<p>Charles, in his gown of crimson velvet girdled with gold and a
chaplet of gold on his head, followed by all his household, was
going down the wide stairs to greet the King and his mother, when a
little chamber-page came to fetch him; the boy was crying from the
excitement of a half-understood misfortune. Charles, motioning to
his household to remain where they were to receive the royal party,
took the little boy by the hand and followed him to his wife's
apartment, the boy in his eagerness going a step or two ahead. The
young man looked down at the little fellow, so lusty and healthy,
with so rosy a face, crying for him in his misfortune. How happy he
would have been if this had been his son!</p>

<p>When he came to her door they would not let him go any further.
The doctor stood there and the priest, and beyond were the women.
The curtains were raised; he could see Anne of France's figure,
bowed, curved, in an attitude of mourning beside the tall, white
bed round which they were drawing the curtains.</p>

<p>She was dead, and the children&mdash;two boys&mdash;had never
drawn breath.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The King was vexed because he had been cheated of his
entertainment and his hunting, as not so long before he had been
cheated of the Imperial Crown, but he behaved good-humouredly and
courteously, saying he would not intrude into a house of mourning.
Yet for a few days he and his suite had to remain in Moulins; it
was not so easy to move so vast a train of people that he could at
once take his departure, and he tried to give a gracious excuse for
his delay in leaving Moulins by saying that he and his mother would
attend the funeral of the Duchess Suzanne at Sauvigny, where she
would be laid with her dead children, one in each arm, in a
gorgeous mausoleum close to that of her father and her infant
son.</p>

<p>The great household ran smoothly; the elaborate ceremonial of
death and mourning softened the sting of loss. Anne de Beaujeu
supervised everything; each official of the huge establishment
received his instructions from her. The pageantry of the sumptuous
funeral was of a stately splendour: the cool chorales hardly ceased
in the chapel; the perfume of incense, of bruised herbs, of spiced
wines, penetrated every chamber in the château; the heralds
arranged banners, armorial robes, shields with painted devices;
horses, mules, and ennets were trapped with mourning habits; pounds
of fair, sweet, fine, wax candles were distributed, while to and
from their hives in the clover fields flew the little insects on
whom mankind depended for sweetness and light, the golden
honeybees.</p>

<p>The kitchens were busy with the preparation of food for so many
people; the maids and pages went to and fro all day with piles of
clean linen, with ewers of fresh water, with flagons of wine and
baskets of candied sweets. Charles remained praying in his oratory
until he had to put on his mourning hood and mantle and go forth
out of that enclosed scented twilight into the brilliancy of May,
where the hedges were close-packed with almond-scented blossom,
the brown birds sang on the apple boughs, and the daisies whitened
the meadows beyond the woods where the young leaves quivered.</p>

<p>Anne de Beaujeu visited her daughter's chamber; it had been
swept and aired, the draperies taken down, the altar removed; the
cradles, the garments, the cushions, the bed furniture had all been
put away; clean, wide, and empty stood the pale chamber where the
sick woman had lain so long, where her three dead children had been
born.</p>

<p>The old woman swung her household keys in her withered hand and
smiled grimly at the sharpness of her own grief; she mourned the
loss of her life's work, the end of the younger branch of the House
of Bourbon. She mourned for Charles. Through the unshuttered,
narrow windows showed the lowly daisies, the delicate tracery of
the spring woods, the milky white vapours softly spread over the
May-day sky. Anne de Beaujeu left the room slowly, her slippered
feet shuffling on the cold floor. When she reached her little
closet where she conducted her business affairs, and which was now
hung with grey serge, she found Louise, the King's mother, seated
by the desk; the two women kissed lightly; Anne de Beaujeu had
educated Louise, her niece, when she had been poor, obscure, and
neglected.</p>

<p>"I have been weeping for your grief, madame. I hope that poor
Suzanne is happier in heaven than she ever was on earth."</p>

<p>"Suzanne was a very happy women."</p>

<p>"Ah, madame, she was so often ill!" lisped Louise, whose suit of
mourning was too splendid, whose face was too painted, to please
her aunt, the austere Princess of France. "And to love one's
children! I could not live without my Caesar, my
François."</p>

<p>Anne Beaujeu did not answer. She seated herself before a high
desk and turned over the pages of a little book that lay there:
<i>Les Heures de Madame la Duchesse de Bourbon</i>.</p>

<p>Louise began to chatter in her affected, lisping voice. She
lamented the failure of François the secure the Imperial
diadem&mdash;he had been willing to pay two millions of golden
crowns for it, but at the last moment the Fuggers, those insolent
Flemish bankers, had refused him credit!</p>

<p>"Which they gave to the Archduke Charles," smiled Anne. "You
should, Louise, teach your François to honour his debts. He
has the name of a bad pay-master."</p>

<p>"Ah, madame, you refer to the money we owe to Charles!"</p>

<p>"No, neither Charles has need of money nor have I. But the King
is very extravagant. You did not train him as I trained you,
Louise."</p>

<p>"Who can restrain a handsome young chevalier?" simpered Louise.
"The world is his, he must enjoy it! Ah, he ought to have been
Emperor! But there is that German heresy&mdash;perhaps it would
have been very difficult to struggle against that! Let the Emperor
deal with this Martin Luther and his hordes. François shall
have Milan."</p>

<p>"Take care how you promise cities as if they were toys. Milan is
a luxury to François, to the Emperor a necessity."</p>

<p>"François is a great conqueror&mdash;he won Milan
before."</p>

<p>"You talk like a child. It was Charles the Connétable
that won Milan."</p>

<p>Louise laughed slyly at the stern, old, bleached woman, but her
manner remained one of great respect.</p>

<p>She was very clever, adroit, and alert, she knew when to be
direct and when to be subtle; neither the atmosphere of the room
nor the cold contempt of the other woman discomposed her. Since her
son, her love, her idol, her Caesar, had been King of France,
nothing could provoke Louise of Savoy. She had waited so many years
for that supreme triumph, and a lifetime would not be too long for
her to enjoy it&mdash;nay, in a hundred years she would not be
tired of being the mother of the King of France.</p>

<p>"Madame," lisped her thin, light, high voice, "you have had
great misfortunes lately: the loss of a little child, the loss of
your daughter and her two infants. I should like to bring you some
joy and pleasure.</p>

<p>"Madame Louise, I am too old for either," replied the other
grimly. "I look for neither joy nor pleasure on this earth."</p>

<p>"And probably you would not expect to get either from me, whom
you remember as your tiresome Louise! Eh, well, who knows? Perhaps
what I have to say will startle you, perhaps you were expecting it.
We are both too high for pretences. Your sainted daughter, alas, is
dead, and you must be prepared for Charles Monsieur to marry
again."</p>

<p>"Suzanne wished him to marry again. I believe that she gave him
the name of the lady whom she desired to be her successor, but
Charles will make a long period of mourning."</p>

<p>"Not if he is wise," smiled Louise. "A Prince of his rank cannot
long remain unwed."</p>

<p>Anne de Beaujeu turned over the bright, smooth pages of the book
on the stand before her and passed her thin fingers over the gold
in the initial letter, as if the smooth glitter of the metal
adhering to the parchment gave her pleasure. She was breathing
hurriedly, there was a spot of colour on either cheek, and her
heavy-lidded eyes remained fixed with a challenging glance on the
smooth, hard features of the other woman.</p>

<p>"The question of the succession of the House of Bourbon will be
raised," continued Louise, lisping and sighing. "My son and I have
spoken of it. Forgive me, but we knew that your daughter could not
live; we knew that she was not likely to have any heirs. Many
People have thought it a wicked thing that Charles should have been
tied to a dying wife, a barren wife. Madame de Bourbon, you do not
need the lawyers or the heralds to tell you that my claim as niece
of your late husband, Monseigneur de Bourbon, is as good as that of
Charles, or that in default of heirs, male of your line, the Duchy
reverts to the Crown."</p>

<p>"That claim has been twice renounced, but we will not dispute. I
do, indeed, know what you might claim, what no one but you would
claim. What more have you to say?"</p>

<p>"I cannot stay here long now," said Louise. "The King and I must
return to Fontainebleau. But Charles will remain here, he will be
your close companion during your period of mourning. Therefore,
suggest to him, madame, that he asks the King for my hand."</p>

<p>Anne of France smiled sourly without appearing in the least
surprised.</p>

<p>"Did you expect that?" asked Louise sharply. "You should not be
astonished. Charles married the heiress of the House of Bourbon
before and might do so again."</p>

<p>"You are forty-five years old, Louise, and you have had many
chevaliers. Neither have you been discreet; you are spoken of very
lightly. But let that go. You are forty-five years old, I say."</p>

<p>"And Charles is thirty-one. Why do you not tell me that? I am
not here to debate. There are my terms."</p>

<p>"Your terms?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You remind me that I am forty-five years of age. I remind
you that I am the King's mother. I have a mind to have these
estates, the Bourbonnais, the Duchy&mdash;the man too. I like him.
You shall have your apanage during your lifetime and all due honour
and service&mdash;and I must have these estates. Consider what I
say; tell Charles."</p>

<p>"The King is behind this?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Louise, throwing back her small, neatly-shaped
head. "Did you, madame, not understand that Charles was too great
to be a subject? He holds a third of France and we must have it. I
give you the chance of surrendering it in a gay and pleasant way. I
like this Charles; he takes my fancies, my caprice, shall we say?
Tell him, you who were always so wise, madame, so adroit, so
well-trained, to ask for my hand, and it shall not be refused."</p>

<p>The other woman looked at the blank wall where the dark
draperies hung over the handsome tapestries. She thought of the
massive Abbey church at Sauvigny, and the masons who laboured there
and the new coffins in the vault. A spasm of pain distorted her
face. Was it possible that Suzanne was dead? She had had a lunatic
impulse to say, "I must ask Suzanne about this." But Suzanne had
known what was coming; she had said: "Louise will try to get the
estates, mother. Louise will try to get Charles." The old woman
brushed her hand across her brow, which was half hidden by the
mourning bands.</p>

<p>"I cannot speak for my son-in-law. This proposal must be put
direct to him. He is, whether he weds you or no, sole heir to the
estates of the House of Bourbon."</p>

<p>"That will have to be proved in a court of law."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you and the King would bring a lawsuit?"</p>

<p>"If we could not get justice any other way."</p>

<p>"So that is what you meant by your terms.</p>

<p>"That," said Madame Louise, rising and hastening to the door,
"is exactly what I mean by my terms, madame."</p>

<p>She opened the door herself and passed through it with a quick
step and her head held high and a gay little salutation to the
bleached woman in mourning who sat at the high desk.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Madame de Bourbon gave herself no respite. Never during her
long, arduous life had she spared herself any toil or avoided any
disagreeable duty. She took from her waist a little crystal cross
with knobs of pearl that hung on a gold chain, and kissed it. She
had taken it from her dead daughter's breast. Then she went through
the hushed corridors of the château, without page or attendant, to
find Charles.</p>

<p>He was in the oratory, kneeling before the altar in his full
suit of mourning, with his dark hair hanging over his clasped
hands; Anne de Beaujeu knelt beside him, then rested her head on
his shoulder; they bowed together before the altar. She held the
little reliquary that she had taken from the dead bosom of Suzanne.
The Connétable rose and raised the old, fatigued woman,
holding her close to his widowed heart. He saw the difficult tears
creep under her lids and led her away to his tall chamber beneath
the <i>Tour mal coiffée</i>, where they were shut away from
all the clatter of the King's departure.</p>

<p>A west wind had risen. It shook the blossoms from the apple
trees, the petals on the hawthorn hedge, and blew the slight trees
in the wood beyond the daisies and fro; it sent out straining into
the sun, the white Bourbon banner on the tower.</p>

<p>Anne de Beaujeu repeated what Louise had told her. Charles sat
silent, his hands clasped on the table before him. His mood was
mournful and bitter; his hatred for the King chilled his blood; the
thought of Louise filled him with nausea; because of her, so
fleshly, shallow, and greedy, he shuddered from all sensuality; he
longed to dedicate himself for ever to the memory of Suzanne; he
felt that he would sooner become an Anchorite than the husband of
that thin-lipped, grey eyed creature who had had so many lovers,
who adored with such fulsome passion her son the King, who hated
him. Old dreams returned to Charles, thickening in his mind like
the fumes of fever; he could hardly understand his own pain for a
little lame woman and three dead infants.</p>

<p>"Stay by me," he Whispered. He put out his cold hand and clasped
the old woman's bony fingers. "Stay by me always. Remember I have
no one now but you, and I shall always take your advice.</p>

<p>"I am here," she replied; and there was reluctant pity for his
weakness in the deep affection of her tone. "And I give you my
advice, either marry Louise or be prepared to defy the King."</p>

<p>"Madame, you Could not suggest that I should take that
woman?"</p>

<p>"No. But understand what it means to slight her: she has good
claims to&mdash;all you possess. I can do nothing more for you,
Charles. My desires, my will&mdash;what does Louise or her son care
for them? They want the towns, the forts, the lands, the treasure,
all that and you. He intends to try for Italy, to keep Milan."</p>

<p>"Always Italy! I won him Milan&mdash;why did he recall me?
Without me it will be lost."</p>

<p>"He must have money," continued Anne de Beaujeu. "You see how
expensive he is! He intends to struggle against this young Emperor.
Jealous, vainglorious, frivolous! He intends to have all you
possess."</p>

<p>"All I possess," repeated Charles, thinking of his great
lordships, of everything that was his, from the horses in his
stables to the clothes in his press, the books in his library.
"Would they strip me like a winter tree?"</p>

<p>The old woman's eyes, coloured like steel, turned on him a
pitiful glance.</p>

<p>"It is a pity that you are so fastidious," she said dryly, "or
you might marry her and break them both afterwards. She would be
wax in the hands of one who profess the passionate lover."</p>

<p>"I cannot. The very thought is so noisome, I sicken at it."</p>

<p>"You will pay a high price for that nicety&mdash;only a
worldling can win the world."</p>

<p>Charles frowned, seeking in his memory&mdash;when had he heard
those words before? With a sad frown he recalled the old man at
Rome, Vercelli, in the shabby apartments next door to the <i>Corona
Triumphalis</i> in the slum named the Field of Flowers.</p>

<p>"Madame, I should like to go again to Italy. You know, when we
were in Bologna, I rode to Rome." He caressed the tired fingers
fluttering under his strong hand. "I climbed up above the ruins and
the gardens, the vineyards and the houses&mdash;Rome! I had such
dreams there. Sometimes they return to me&mdash;an infernal
masquerade&mdash;and the daisies. How these fantasies cloud the
mind! Some day I shall go, a poor pilgrim, to Rome, to gaze on the
pictures Raffaello painted in the Pope's palace. She disturbed me
then, this Louise. I danced with her in her red and white&mdash;I
saw the processions of the dead children..."</p>

<p>"Moody, reserved, and dream-stricken!" thought Anne de Beaujeu
compassionately. She said aloud "While you brooded in Rome,
François bargained with the Pope and got Milan."</p>

<p>"And 'The Laocoön'," smiled Charles negligently&mdash;"a
copy, as all say. I kept Milan for him&mdash;without me he will
lose it. I can, when I will, rule cities and men, but there are
other things that I would rather do." He sighed, his thoughts all
at Sauvigny, and added: "For Madame Louise&mdash;no&mdash;no, I
shall go on and take my destiny."</p>

<p>A shower of sudden rain spattered against the painted glass in
the window, and hung with mournful drops the arms of Montpensier
and Bourbon emblazoned there.</p>

HIS HOLINESS leaned out of the window and watched the
men-at-arms building up a bonfire in the courtyard of his villa at
Magliana. He had just returned from the chase, heated, breathless,
spattered with blood, when he had been met by a messenger sent by
Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, who was awaiting him with news of the
fall of Milan.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more welcome to His Holiness; Parma and
Piacenza had been recovered by the Church, and now Milan by the
Emperor! Leo, when he had read the dispatches, had at once issued
his orders for an official celebration in Rome, but his Master of
the Ceremonies had told him that it was hardly fitting for the Holy
See to show open rejoicings at the victory of one Christian monarch
over another. The Pope, however, brushed this tedious objection
aside; he had every reason to be satisfied, he had said, that the
Emperor had won a victory over the King of France, and he had
ordered a full Consistory of the Cardinals to be summoned for the
next Wednesday. Then he had gone smiling, nodding to himself, to
his chamber to rest.</p>

<p>The excitement of this news, acting on his overheated blood, had
brought on the fever to which he was so subject; he decided that it
would be wise for him to rest, but found that he could not do so;
his mind was full of pictures that seemed to go round and round
inside his head and sparkling thoughts that prevented him from
easing his fatigue, and when he saw in his chamber the reflected
light of the first flames of the bonfire he had to hoist his heavy
body out of bed and go to the window. Sweat beaded his forehead,
and his unwieldy limbs trembled; the day had been close though
damp, but now a keen north wind was blowing the trees&mdash;still
green in winter&mdash;the ilex and the laurel, sideways above the
narrow brick walls of the courtyard of the villa where the Papal
servants in the Medici livery and the men-at-arms were piling up
wood round the bonfire. The flames blew out like scarlet ribbons
across the darkness of the Roman <i>Campagna</i>.</p>

<p>Never since that tremendous moment when he had known himself
elected Pope had Leo felt such a strong excitement. It had been a
day of great pleasure; he had been able to slaughter many beasts;
again and again he had been helped down from his horse and run his
sharp knife over warm, soft throats&mdash;a good day's sport! Then,
returning to news like this! Milan wrenched from France again,
Parma and Piacenza too, and that insolent, crafty François
humbled at last.</p>

<p>The Pope rubbed his white hands, wrinkling and curling into the
fatness of middle age, as he called out in his melodious voice to
the men-at-arms below to keep the bonfire piled high that it might
burn all the night. France should understand at last that he was a
Medici and the master of the world, he and that young Emperor whom
François had so despised&mdash;that chaste, austere, and
precocious boy who was the faithful son of the Holy Church.</p>

<p>"They should have sent Charles, the Connétable," he said
to himself, shivering in the strong wind that was like an angry
tooth in his soft flesh, but refusing to leave the window because
he did not wish to lose the pleasure of the sight below&mdash;the
bonfire, the men in his livery hurrying to and fro to feed it.
"But, no, that young French fool must quarrel with his one good
general and keep him idle, if not worse. Eh, I should not be
surprised if Bourbon did not leave the service of France. Do not
the King and the King's mother intend to bring a lawsuit to rob him
of all he has?"</p>

<p>Again he clapped his hands to call the attention of the men
below, who looked up and waved their caps and continued to pile on
the bonfire great logs of pine, of chestnut, and of cedar.</p>

<p>At last the Pope drew back into his chamber and let the curtain
fall across the casement. He was shivering violently; a slight
hallucination passed over his senses, usually so acute, for he
thought:</p>

<p>"Raffaello shall paint me this. It will make another great
picture for the frescoed rooms in the Vatican."</p>

<p>Leo had worked out all the details of the design, and dwelt with
much pleasure on the instructions that he would give the master,
before he remembered that Raffaello had been dead for a year.</p>

<p>"Oh, eh, me, the young Master was dead, but thirty-seven years
old, nearly ten years younger than I am, the Pope, who still
account myself young!" That was stupid that God should have taken
Raffaello with all his work unfinished&mdash;God or the Devil or
that blind chance which was more powerful than either. How charming
he was, that young Master, so courteous, excellent and graceful,
modest and good. Why had he died, with his winning charm and his
great, great genius? Eh, there were his pupils left, but they were
nothing without him!</p>

<p>Leo sighed bitterly when he thought of that studio, full of
unfinished sketches, uncompleted designs, of the canvases being
filled in by imitators, plans for villas being painfully completed
by copyists. Ah, well, Raffaello was dead and would not paint on
the walls of the chamber in the Vatican the victory of the Emperor
at Milan!</p>

<p>The Pope drew near the fire; the chamber-boy put Leo's feet,
which had suddenly become cold, into fur slippers and piled another
log on the hearth. Leo had ordered an extravagant supper, but now
he sickened at the thought of it and would have nothing but some
heated, sweetened milk. He felt a great uneasiness in his
body&mdash;the fever was surely increasing; he would not send for
the doctors, he would not admit that he was ill; he would sit there
in the cosy chamber where the walls reflected the light of the
bonfire without and the light of the fire on the hearth, and think
over his good fortune.</p>

<p>Always impulsive and extravagant in his ideas, he was minded now
to send François a message telling him that it was only a
copy of "The Laocoön" that he had at Fontainebleau. Why should
he, the conqueror, hide for fear the original marble and allow the
defeated King to keep in triumph a stupid copy?</p>

<p>"Not even a very good one," chuckled the Pope to himself. "That
was not a very fine piece of work that Bacio Bandinello did for
me."</p>

<p>His mind, which the fever jerked out of his control, travelled
to Michael Angelo and the great, grey mausoleum in San
Lorenzo...Two Medici were buried there, his brother Giuliano, his
nephew Lorenzo. Ah, that sent him off to joyous chuckling memories
of Lorenzo's embassy to France to marry the Princess Madeleine, the
King's cousin&mdash;that had startled the French.</p>

<p>They considered themselves luxurious, but the magnificence of
Lorenzo de' Medici, the Pope's nephew, had set them all chattering;
the haughty young Duke whom Leo himself did not greatly care for
had outdone even the magnificence of the Field of the Cloth of
Gold; and now all those French people, who considered themselves so
exquisite and so superb, had gaped when they had seen the bed that
the Pope had sent for bride and groom, tortoiseshell inlaid with
mother of pearl and set with coloured stones every one of which was
worthy to be in a royal crown!</p>

<p>The Pope's mind glanced away from the end of that
story&mdash;Lorenzo had died soon after his marriage, and a
fortnight later his frail wife had followed him, and they had not
left a male heir behind&mdash;only a dark and wizened little girl,
a dull, an ugly little brat; yes, only that female child, the
little Duchess to be the heir of the House of Medici.</p>

<p>The Pope's fat hand rose and fell impatiently on the arm of his
chair of sweet chestnut wood.</p>

<p>That was an unpleasant turn of fate; he was almost sorry that he
had made Giulio, the bastard, a Cardinal; it would have been better
for him to remain in the world and beget heirs for the glory of the
House of Medici; but now it was too late, for with a great deal of
craft, trouble, and expenditure of money and some loss of dignity
he had made Giulio a Cardinal. There was little Alessandro, a
Medici bastard reputed to be Lorenzo's son, but Giulio was the
father as Leo thought&mdash;what did it matter? Alessandro was as
coarse as a mule.</p>

<p>Leo's short-sighted eyes blinked at the flames; a pity that he
had always been chaste himself, better if he had had sons. What was
the use of building up all this magnificence and splendour if there
was nobody to inherit it? Giulio must be Pope, he must see to that
whatever it cost. If the Medici had Rome they could forgo Florence.
Ah, Rome, Rome, where one could be safe, like the pearl in an
oyster, a relic in a shrine. The Pope's whole being went out in
passionate love to Rome&mdash;Rome that he had beautified, Rome
that he almost felt he had built, Rome where his tomb was waiting
for him in the cool grey shadows of San Lorenzo.</p>

<p>He found that his milk had grown cold and called for more. His
sight was always bad, but never had he known the figures of those
about him waver as they did now, seeming to shake into impossible
shapes; thoughts that he did not wish to entertain pressed on him;
suddenly, and for no reason, he thought he was in that battle nine
years before where his countrymen had been butchered like the mice
that run out of the corn when it is being reaped; the room seemed
full of the horrid sounds made by the dying and the mutilated, and
he started up in his chair, crying out that they were to stop the
slaughter at Prato.</p>

<p>That had been only a wave of fever such as he ought to
expect&mdash;beside, there was nothing unusual in it, he always got
heated at the chase; and then the excitement of the news sent by
Giulio, and leaning out of the window to see the bonfire in that
clean, keen wind...</p>

<p>They helped him to bed and he smiled on them with many
courtesies. Several times he spoke of Raffaello as if he lived, and
often of the battle of Prato as if it were taking place in his
chamber.</p>

<p>In the morning his mind was clearer and he seemed to have
recovered from his illness; he spoke much of France and the King of
France, of humbling the pride of that long-nosed fox; he pressed
the hand of his secretary, the faithful Seratica. When he tried to
get up he found his head was more than usually choked with catarrh
and that he was sick and languid.</p>

<p>He would, he insisted, return to the Vatican for the official
rejoicings for the Imperial victory at Milan; his secretary
reminded him that the Papal treasury was almost empty, but he waved
that aside&mdash;was he not a Medici, did he ever fail to obtain
money even if he had to pay forty per cent for it?</p>

<p>"If only I could find another Raffaello!" he sighed as they
lifted him into the litter. The woollen curtains were drawn close
and the white horses paced with discreet care so that the unwieldy
body of the Pontiff might not be shaken. But such was his energy
that now and then he drew the stuff aside with unsteady fingers and
asked if those who rode beside him had any more news. Surely some
more messengers had come up from Rome, surely something more had
been heard of the victories in the North?</p>

<p>Leo wanted to talk about France too; had no one heard anything
of the great lawsuit that was being brought against the
Connétable?</p>

<p>"How long do you think," whispered the Pope from his pillows,
"he will endure such a treatment as the King of France gives him?
Do you know, Seratica, I am very much minded to sound him myself.
We can do with some such captains."</p>

<p>"We could not pay them," replied the quiet little secretary.
"Your Holiness knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, money, money! Seratica, you will always talk to me of that.
I like rather to think of the members of the House of Medici that
are living and well. Giuliano and Lorenzo are dead&mdash;but there
are Giulio, Alessandro, the little girl Caterina, and my nephew
Ippolito." He suddenly laughed and said: "If I were to die now
nearly all the Florentine bankers would be ruined, would they
not?"</p>

<p>His secretary peered at him with apprehension; he thought that
his master's mind was wandering and his reason perhaps was going;
he wrung his hands together in his fur cuffs.</p>

<p>The Pope settled on his pillows as the litter jolted along. It
was true that he had never felt so ill or so sick, as if all the
warm blood he had shed yesterday lay clotted on his chest; horrible
fears that he had never known before touched his mind; was
Bernardo Malespifla, his cupbearer, really to be trusted?</p>

<p>Supposing that he was in the pay of the King of France or the
Duke of Urbino!</p>

<p>"These fears are ignoble, they are unworthy of me." He tried to
drive them from his mind; he pulled aside the curtains again, not
this time to babble about news but to stare across the winter
landscape. Death began entirely to occupy his thoughts&mdash;the
murder of his uncle as he knelt at Mass, the death of Giuliano the
younger from a filthy consumption, the death of Lorenzo, rotten
from evil living, the death of all those men butchered by the
Spaniards at Prato.</p>

<p>"Eh, eh, o Fiend, in how many forms lost thou come!" muttered
the Pope, tossing his head on his pillows and trying to move his
clumsy body, for even the soft mattress began to irk his bones
aching from fever. The death of all those children too, that great
lawsuit that was rending France&mdash;that would never have
occurred if the Connétable had not lost his wife and his
infants.</p>

<p>"Eh, they die, young and old, and even I, Leo, some day must
die."</p>

<p>But why did such sombre thoughts possess him? This was the hour
of his triumph! He steadied his wavering mind with an effort and
turned his thoughts backwards to the conspiracy in the Papal
College last year&mdash;that had been a triumph, a personal
triumph, he must think of that; they had all been jealous, the red
hats, because of his favouritism towards Giulio, the bastard whom
he had raised to the purple.</p>

<p>They had been weary too of the long war of Urbino, on which he,
de' Medici, had spent so much money; and they had dared to plan a
conspiracy against him led by that dissolute boy the Cardinal of
Vienna, Alfonso Petrucci; that treacherous young fool had been
encouraged by the old Raffaele Riario, who had turned republican
and tried to steal his secrets; then there had been Cardinal Adrian
of Corneto, who had listened to some half-crazed soothsayer who had
told him that the next Pope's name would be Adrian. They were all
under obligations to him, all of them; they had conspired against
him and tried to kill him in a humiliating and contemptible manner.
Some of them had wished to stab him when he was hunting, to strike
him down as he struck down the animals, and then they had got hold
of a quack named Vercelli and introduced him into the Vatican as a
new skilled physician able to cure the Pope's continual disease.
When they had accomplished this, what did they intend to do? Why,
this wretched charlatan would poison him, Giovanni de' Medici, by
means of bandages he would apply to his ulcerous wound.</p>

<p>The Pope writhed on the litter; he pulled aside the curtains.
Seratica informed him nervously that they had nearly reached the
gates of Rome.</p>

<p>"Rome!" said the Pope. "Rome! The gates of Rome!"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes; he did not wish to think any more of the
conspiracy of the Cardinals. It came up into his mind again. Death
there once more, and death dealt by his hand; he had tried to save
this boy, Cardinal Petrucci, he had told him that he suspected
something, but no, the young viper would go on and then it had all
been discovered and he had had them arrested; two Cardinals of the
Church arrested in the courtyard of the Vatican! Leo could remember
that scene, which he had watched standing at a window with his
glass to his eye; even then he had observed it but dimly, little
figures moving violently, the two Princes of the Church with a
great train of servants, one of them tearing his rochet in a fury,
the other&mdash;the boy&mdash;cursing the pope shrilly until, like
a couple of street brawlers, they were forced away to the Castel
Sant' Angelo, down into the underground dungeons full of a
sickening stench.</p>

<p>Well, he had triumphed; even though the two had not been in the
conspiracy but had only uttered a few injudicious words against him
and been forced to beg his pardon on their knees, bowed and curved
before his seat. He had had them all except Corneto, who had
escaped, and who, hunted down by the Papal spies, died at last in
obscurity; then those two in the Castel Sant' Angelo...</p>

<p>He raised himself on his elbow and pulled aside the curtains of
the litter yet once more and stared out to where the dark circular
form of the mighty fortress rose out of the faint lilac winter
mist.</p>

<p>Eh, they had not proved heroes, these two would-be murderers,
for they had fallen into convulsions of terror at the very sight of
the rack; they had confessed everything without its being necessary
to turn a single screw; they had undergone the torture, however,
just the same&mdash;one of them, the Genoese, had claimed to be the
subject of the King of France and for diplomatic reasons had to be
released, but he died soon afterwards from what he had suffered in
the dungeons of Sant' Angelo; he, Leo, had seen to that.</p>

<p>But the boy Petrucci, the little Cardinal whom he had loved and
caressed, calling him his Cupid, his Phoebus, his Ganymede&mdash;he
had to die.</p>

<p>He had been Leo's playmate, his toy, his companion, and yet he
had plotted against him; with love and pity on his lips and
treachery in his heart he had hung over the Papal chair&mdash;and
he had to die. He must be damned, too, if there was anything in
Christianity; he had refused to make a confession or receive the
Sacrament; he had said, that Cardinal of twenty-two years of age,
that if he was doomed to lose his life he cared nothing of what
became of his soul; in the foul underground dungeon he had cursed
the Medici. Orlando, the Mohammedan hangman of the Papal Court, had
strangled the boy in his dark dungeon on a July night.</p>

<p>Leo put his hand to his throat as the litter approached the
Imperial gates of Rome. There were the others too, the little
villains, the underlings; they had suffered&mdash;pulled on hurdles
through the filthy streets of Rome and torn to pieces with red-hot
pincers, gibbeted on the parapet of the bridge of Sant' Angelo.
"Eh, that was a triumph," gasped Leo; he let the curtains fall
again from his slack fingers. Triumph! The word went to and fro in
his head.</p>

<p>He thought he was seated once more before one of his gilded,
obscene comedies, the King of France on one hand, the
Connétable on the other, and before him two fair
women&mdash;Venus, the mother of love, and the Fair Supplicant,
veiled only in silver gauze with crowns spiked with pearls on their
heads.</p>

<p>He wanted to tell Seratica to hurry the cavalcade, he wanted to
be in his splendid palace in the Vatican again with Giulio near
him&mdash;he wanted to make his Rome impregnable, the inviolable,
magnificent crown of Italy, superb diadem of the world.</p>

<p>Why did he think of the boy Cardinal, twenty-two years old, when
he was buried, like a dog, in a ditch outside the walls of the City
at night?</p>

<p>"'Tis a fearful thing to die without Sacraments, without
confession."</p>

<p>Leo wished that his favourite buffoon, Fra Mariano Fetti, were
with him&mdash;he always amused him, the poor, crazy, ape-like
creature.</p>

<p>A lion&mdash;was he not a lion? Had not his mother Clarice
dreamed before his birth that she was about to bring a lion into
the world and had he not for that reason chosen the name Leo when
he was made Supreme Pontiff? Ah, surely, the fever must be strong
in his veins; stupid and evil suggestions kept creeping into his
thoughts. What was that scurrilous distich which had been made on
Pope Boniface VIII?</p>

<p><i>Thou didst creep into our midst like a fox. Thou didst live
among us like a lion. Thou hast died like a dog.</i></p>

<p>"Do not let me recall that now. Not now."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Through the gates of Rome, along the streets of Rome to the yet
unfinished Palace of the 'Vatican, Pope Leo X was brought; they
carried him to his chamber, and his spirit rose at the sight of the
familiar splendours; nothing would satisfy him but, his unwieldy
body supported on either side by the two Medici Cardinals, Ippolito
and Giulio, he must walk once more through the great chambers
painted by Raffaello; he stood long looking at <i>The Deliverance
of Saint Peter</i>, the angel leading the apostle out of prison,
and he paused again, peering with his short-sighted and
fever-dimmed eyes in the Hall of the <i>Incendio</i>, and looked
upon <i>The Destruction of Ancient Troy by Fire</i>; he smiled to
see the painting of <i>The Coronation of Charlemagne</i>, which
brought to his mind his meeting with the French King at
Bologna.</p>

<p>"How beautiful they are, how beautiful!" he murmured, and his
face became transformed to a dignity and his diseased and bowed
figure into nobility as he straightened himself to gaze at the
superb compositions. "If Raffaello had lived, I would have had
another suite of apartments&mdash;as fine as this."</p>

<p>They set a padded chair and a footstool for him in front of the
<i>Disputa</i>; he gripped the velvet arms and wheezed and
coughed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Giulio Romano could do it," he muttered. Then he turned
over in his clouded mind what subjects he should set this painter.
The Turks, under that great pagan Soliman. They were menacing
Rhodes, harrying the borders of the Empire on the Hungarian
Marches. There were hundreds of thousands of these Infidels.
Christendom ought to unite against them&mdash;ay, there was matter
for one great painting! The Turks hurled backwards into the
East!</p>

<p>Martin Luther&mdash;that fat brown monk, clamouring, ignorant,
with his gross German followers; there should be a picture of the
heretic and his heresy being cast to hell. The Emperor was facing
him at the Diet of Worms&mdash;poor young Emperor, how much he had
to harass him! The Infidel, the heretic revolt in his
Empire&mdash;and lack of money.</p>

<p>The Pope said aloud, "Money"&mdash;so that his secretary and
Giulio de' Medici behind his chair bent down to listen.</p>

<p>"If Raffaello had lived," said Leo, "should I have been able to
pay him?"</p>

<p>He thought of the wealth dammed up in Germany by the heresy of
Luther, of all the gold possessed by Soliman, and he sighed
enviously.</p>

<p>"There is the New World," remarked Giulio de' Medici. "Every
year they find goldmines, or the value of goldmines.</p>

<p>"It is shipped to Spain or Portugal, not to Rome," answered Leo
drowsily his head sank on his wheezing chest. The New World! His
fingers twitched as if they dug deeply in quarries of golden ore
and precious stones. Why had God allowed this treasure to be for so
long hidden? "If I had had that, what a Rome I could have built!"
he muttered; the bridges, the palaces, the churches, the towers,
the streets that he might have built in Rome, crowded before him in
a phantasmagoria.</p>

<p>He tried to think out the great problems that tormented him: the
Infidels&mdash;the Heretic&mdash;the quarrel between
François I and Charles the Emperor&mdash;his own feud with
the Colonna&mdash;the power of the Fuggers which was behind the
Emperor; he tried to pierce beyond all this and to reach the
supreme, the eternal truth that must be hid behind these paltry
figures, these earthly puzzles, these cloudy symbols.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ or Plato? Neither or both? Were they not the same?
He blinked his blood-shot eyes open and stared at the
<i>Disputa</i>, then his mind closed to all these difficulties and
before it moved only the rounded figures, created by Raffaello,
with oval faces, pursed lips, serene eyes, and fair hair in little
spirals about their brows.</p>

<p>"I will go to my chamber," he whispered; four of his guards
raised the chair and carried him to his apartments. "I will order
Cellini to make me a model of the world in <i>lapis lazuli</i> with
agate and crystal ships crossing it, and lumps of gold where the
Indies are."</p>

<p>He was pleased to see the fine flames burning on his marble
hearth; the red gold came up like the plumes Giulio Romano loved to
paint. He was glad of the brazier of charcoal that they had ready
for him to hold his hands over, but when he peered at the table of
green marble by the window, he shuddered.</p>

<p>"What have you brought me?"</p>

<p>Giulio de' Medici lovingly touched the elaborate model.</p>

<p>"It is by Torrigiano, Holiness. A tomb for the late King of
England; a fair chapel is being built for it in the Church of St.
Peter in the City of Westminster."</p>

<p>"A tomb!" repeated the Pope uneasily, and he turned his back on
the table that held the beautiful design.</p>

<p>"How superstitious he is!" whispered Giulio de' Medici aloud; he
ordered the work to be taken away and rated the page, who, hoping
to give a pleasure to the Pope, had snatched the cover off the
model.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Leo lay in his high, ornate bed; he wished that they had not
shown him the tomb; all night he had dreamt of Lorenzo and
Giuliano, lying in the clear, chilly twilight of the grey church,
and of the boy Cardinal strangled by his orders and thrown into a
ditch outside Rome.</p>

<p>He was not ill; only his usual catarrh and a touch of fever,
that malaria which rose like the Devil's breath from the undrained
swamps about Rome.</p>

<p>The doctors had visited him, purged him, bled him, and given him
some medicine; the taste of this still lingered in his mouth; he
did not like nor trust the physicians, but he was glad of their
assurances that he was not ill&mdash;only a little fatigued, a
little excited and tormented by dreams. The night-lamp was burning
clearly: Leo could see the outlines of the heavy pieces of
furniture, each in a blur of shadow, and the shape of his buffoon,
Fra Mariano, sleeping on his little bed by the painted coffer, the
outline of the female griffins holding the shields with the arms of
the Medici&mdash;<i>Palle! Palle!</i>&mdash;on the columns of his
own bed.</p>

<p>Leo turned his dim eyes from the dimness of the room and stared
up at the darkness of his silken and brocade canopy.</p>

<p>Across this moved silent phantoms; a shadow play of the Italians
slain at Prato, of the boy strangled in his cell below the fortress
of Sant' Angelo, of all the wounded beasts panting in the net,
waiting for the knife.</p>

<p>Leo groaned; his fat, creased, white hand hung over the edge of
the bed; someone was slobbering over it&mdash;his whining, soft old
dog? No, Fra Mariano, the fool, who was kissing his hand. They were
alone together, the Pope and the fool.</p>

<p>Leo lay on his back, staring up.</p>

<p>"Think on God, Holy Father!" exclaimed the buffoon in a terrible
voice that did not seem to be his own.</p>

<p>The Pope stirred and struggled as if he lay chained, and without
lowering his eyes exclaimed, "God! God! God!"</p>

<p>"Is it so terrible to die without the Sacrament or a
confession?" asked the fool; he pulled his cowl over his face and
began to blubber like a beaten child. The Pope lay, after one
convulsion, as still as if he were on his grey stone pillow; his
heavy jaw dropped, and, mouth open, his glazed eyes continued to
stare up as if he looked through the canopy that expressed extreme
and worldly pomp into the cold night beyond the draperies, beyond
the ceiling, beyond the roof of the Vatican.</p>

<p>At that moment in the middle of the dead night Lucretia
Salviati, who had heard of her brother's illness, arrived at the
Vatican with a train of Florentines; the buffoon was hopping along
the corridors, screaming out that the Pope was dead.</p>

<p>Madonna Lucretia waited, breathless, in her brother's apartments
until she heard that he was dead; then with delicate precision she
went through his possessions, snatching up and hiding in her silken
skirts every small object of value she could find, diamonds in gold
boxes, strings of pearls, crystal buttons, and buckles of
agate.</p>

<p>Outside, the pale snow clouds gathered over Rome and the white
flakes fell crisp and delicate as the dawn brightened above on the
Seven Hills and on the black ashes of the bonfire in the courtyard
at the Papal villa.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>FIVE.<br>
Two Norman Esquires.<br>
Summer-Autumn 1523.</h2>
<br>

<p class="verse">Let us sit beneath the trees<br>
Here on the long grass<br>
And tell of old treacheries<br>
As the slow shadows pass<br>
Across the mill, the sheep, the stream<br>
And our hearts that drowse and dream.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
IN the inn of "The Three Kings" at Vendôme two young Norman
gentlemen waited to keep what was to them a mysterious
appointment.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Lurcy, one of the gentlemen most in favour with the
Connétable de Bourbon, had asked them to meet him in a
secluded room of this hostel; and they had each received a letter
from the Duke himself earnestly bidding them to wait on his agent.
Roth these gentlemen had been, before the death of the Duchess
Anne, attached to the Court of the Duke of Bourbon; they now
resided on their considerable estates in Normandy, but as they had
been treated with the greatest generosity and splendour by the
House of Bourbon, they made no demur to Monsieur de Lurcy's
request.</p>

<p>They were young men, neither more than thirty, tall, well made,
with straight features, fair hair, and grey eyes, and well clothed
in cloth and silk. One of them was the Sieur de Matignon, and the
other the Sieur d'Argouges. While they waited for the Bourbon agent
they discussed together, in a cosy, gossiping manner, the
possibilities there might be behind this command. Since the death
of the Duchess Anne the year before, the Connétable had been
much alone, without a woman to console him or a counsellor to
advise him, and it was now well known to these two young Normans,
and indeed to the whole of France, that he was on bad terms with
the King, as he had refused the hand of Madame Louise, who was
bringing a great lawsuit against him. He had been given no high
military command nor Court appointment, nor had he received the
vast sums of money due to him from François. He had not,
therefore, meddled in politics nor in the coming war against the
Emperor, but had lived in remote splendour in his magnificent
châteaux, those of Montbrison, Moulins, and Chantelle,
administering his Duchy with prudence, discretion, and justice. But
everyone knew that he was too great a man to be able to live thus
for long, and the two Norman gentlemen, discussing with glib
approbation the character and conduct of their splendid patron,
commended him for his unblemished if cool loyalty, though they eyed
each other slyly as they spoke, each searching the secret soul of
the other.</p>

<p>Why had Bourbon lately accepted the miserable task of going to
the borders of Champagne and Burgundy, to put down a band of
marauding adventurers, while the King was behind the legal action
that Madame Louise brought, which, if successful, would deprive him
of his estates, even of the means of livelihood?</p>

<p>"Can any man," asked de Matignon, "be so high and consent to
fall so low?"</p>

<p>"The King will see that he is not stripped," replied the other
gentleman. "Eh, do you not think so? But what has it to do with us?
Why have we been sent for?"</p>

<p>The shrewd, businesslike Normans, very loyal to the Duke of
Bourbon, declared, but in prudent undertones, that the King's
mother was the worst of women and that the whole lawsuit was a
scandal.</p>

<p>"But if she is minded to have the estates, she will have them,"
said d'Argouges; and they referred, briefly and half ashamed, to
the horrible affair of the Sieur de Semblançay, the
Treasurer of France, who had had four hundred thousand crowns to
send to Maréchal de Lautrec commanding the French troops in
France; but the money had never reached the De Lautrec, and for
lack of it there had been a defeat and a retreat; it was on the
Maréchal's return that the story had come out&mdash;Madame
Louise had taken the four hundred thousand crowns for herself; for
once the King had lost his temper with his mother and violently
accused her of being the cause of the loss of the Duchy of Milan.
Then the sly, cruel woman had given the lie to this de
Semblançay and declared that she had had the money, but it
had been her own savings, and the four hundred thousand crowns sent
for the Army had been stolen by the Treasurer himself. What was the
use of the unfortunate man's word against that of Louise? A
criminal suit was brought against him, he was imprisoned.</p>

<p>The two young Norman nobles, looking at each other with pursed
sips, said that he would not be likely to leave prison, save for
the scaffold. They did not think that the Connétable stood
in much better state. What chance had he now, for instance, when
the King was going to Italy to take command of his forces in
person, and Madame Louise was to be Regent? Would she not take
every opportunity her power afforded her of tormenting him?</p>

<p>They then again began to ask each other, eagerly and with a
touch of apprehension, what the Duke's agent was likely to want of
them, and it was with some anxiety that they welcomed de Lurcy when
he arrived.</p>

<p>During the meal nothing but formal courtesies was spoken. De
Lurcy gave the two Norman gentlemen accounts of the Duke's health
and habits; he had had a sharp touch of tertian fever, he had been
very melancholy and reserved since the death of the Duchess Anne,
and, though surrounded by so many courtiers and officers of his
great household, spent much of his time alone in his apartment or
his oratory; he was at present on a pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Puy
and was high up in the mountains at Montbrison, the capital of the
Hautforez.</p>

<p>His loneliness, said de Lurcy, was a piteous thing to see, and
he was much changed in his countenance, having grown pale and thin
and complaining often of a pain in his side; the insolent lawsuit
was enough to wear away any man's strength, and though the King
assured him constantly that it was not his intention to strip him
of his estates, what else could this persecution mean?</p>

<p>"I suppose," said d'Argouges, "Madame Louise still hopes to
obtain his hand? But this is a fine way to set about a wooing."</p>

<p>"The Duke will not have her," said de Lurcy earnestly. "Nay, not
for all the gold in Christendom. And he is wise. It were better to
be ruined than to marry such a one as this Madame Louise."</p>

<p>"Well, what is to be the next step?" asked de Matignon, who was
still nervous and uneasy as to what might be behind this mysterious
meeting. "His Highness the Duke has had the goodness to send you to
us. Well, we are at his service."</p>

<p>"So I hope," said de Lurcy, smiling.</p>

<p>The cloth had been drawn and they were alone in the room; the
Connétable's agent took the precaution of going to the door
and drawing the tapestry closely over it; he knew that his own
servant was watching without, and that the chamber was high-placed
so that no one could listen at the windows. He then went to the
hearth, where, under a large stone cowl that rose to the ceiling,
logs were piled on the andirons; the eyes of the two young men were
on him keenly and he on his part had a serious and earnest air, as
he spoke:</p>

<p>"I wish you to keep in your minds Moulins, that ancient city on
the Allier where the Bourbon princes have lived since their
ancestor, the son of Saint Louis, built the castle there&mdash;the
great fortress at Chantelle, the strongest in the country, which is
surrounded by a rocky precipice and a river as well as man-made
battlements. It is also," he added, "the most beautiful palace in
France. Think of some of the possessions of this great prince as
you have seen them yourself&mdash;you know how he loves all that is
choice and lovely, you have seen his furniture, his pictures, his
tapestry, his priceless library of books and of manuscripts. You
know the establishment he has, his chamberlain, his equerries,
squires, gentlemen and pensioners of his household, pages,
heralds-at-arms, cupbearers, stewards, secretaries; you know that
he has his own chancellor, the right to levy soldiers, that he has
in his pay both writers and artists. I need not tell you his
titles, the duchies, lordships, and countships that he holds. He is
a Sovereign Prince, he is First Subject of the Realm, and near to
the Throne itself."</p>

<p>"I do not know," said d'Argouges quietly, "why you bring this
picture before our minds? Have we not both lived in the households
you speak of! No doubt we hold ourselves very bounden to the Duke
and wish to serve him in every particular. If it is his desire to
have us back in his service, I at least can speak for myself and
say that I will go."</p>

<p>"I also," added de Matignon. "I will serve the Connétable
in any way possible. I and all my friends and household think that
an insolent injustice has been done him in the matter of the
lawsuit, and no one in France loves or respects Madame Louise."</p>

<p>"Those are the words I hoped to hear!" exclaimed de Lurcy with
enthusiasm. "You are under an obligation to this magnificent Prince
and in the time of his misfortune, his threatened misfortune, he
calls on you. His affairs reach a crisis. Madame Louise will soon
be in power in France, and the King, who might show some kindness,
some generosity, will be the other side of the Alps. He does not,
you notice, take Monseigneur de Bourbon, his best general, with
him. No, he trusts in unworthy favourites."</p>

<p>"Tell us what you want of us, de Lurcy, for if we are closeted
here too long it will seem like a conspiracy."</p>

<p>The agent of the Connétable then produced a large crystal
from his pocket foiled with gold and containing a lock of the
Virgin's hair. Placing this reverently on a handkerchief of lilac
silk he laid it on the table, and asked both the gentlemen to hold
their hands above it and swear not to reveal what he was about to
disclose to them.</p>

<p>The prudent Normans hesitated a second before taking this
oath&mdash;the fact that it was required of them proved the matter
in hand to be serious. But it was true that they were under great
obligations to Charles de Bourbon and both admired him and held him
in a certain affection; there was also an urgency in de Lurcy's
manner that was hard to withstand, so they held out their hands and
swore.</p>

<p>When they had done so there was a silence in the inn room while
the Duke's agent returned the relic to his pocket. Thin, again
taking up his stand by the hearth and looking at the two young men
sitting at the table, on which still stood the wine-bottles and
glasses, he said:</p>

<p>"I am trusting you with the lives of many men, the life and
honour of the Connétable. I must tell you that soon after
the death of the Duchess Suzanne, Phillibert Naturelli, the
Emperor's Ambassador, said to the Connétable: 'You are now
free to marry. The Emperor, my master, has a sister, about whom I
am commissioned to speak to you.' The Duke put him by with courtly
thanks; but as the matter of the lawsuit became more perilous to my
lord he began to reopen negotiations with the Spanish Minister. The
King heard of this, and one day when he was at the Louvre, standing
by the chair of Queen Claude, the King challenged him, saying, 'You
are on the point of being married.' My lord replied it was not so,
but the King said angrily that he knew it, and he added: 'I shall
remember you and your plottings with the Emperor.' This was before
the death of the Duchess Anne," continued de Lurcy. "I think the
King would have stopped the Duke then&mdash;had him arrested, I
mean&mdash;but so many noblemen went with him when he left the
Palace that the King durst not interfere with him. Well,
messeigneurs, you know how things have gone since then, and now it
seems that the King has the intention of reducing the
Connétable to the position of a poor gentleman with four
thousand livres a year."</p>

<p>"Where is this leading us?" asked d'Argouges anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am telling you as briefly as possible, but I must lead you
step by step to what I would tell you. I have said that the
Connétable is on a pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Puy. While he
has been on this journey or residing at Montbrison he has sent for
Adrian de Croy, Sieur de Beaurain, the Emperor's man, and they have
been shut up for several days together. Well, perhaps you can guess
of what they are talking."</p>

<p>"I would rather not," muttered de Matignon, putting his elbows
on the table and his hands over his face.</p>

<p>But de Lurcy, as if he had not seen the gesture or heard the
words, continued: "My master is surrounded by faithful adherents:
the Bishop of Puy, the Bishop of Autun, all the young nobility of
the Auvergne, of Forez, of the Beaujolais; with him is Jean de
Poitiers, lord of Saint Vallier."</p>

<p>"What do all these people do, shut up in the castle in the
mountains?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. They discuss letters from Charles V, the
Emperor, and Henry VIII, the King of England. A treaty has been
drawn up: the Connétable has been promised the hand of the
Emperor's sister, Eleanor, the Dowager Queen of Portugal, or else
the Infanta Catalina with a dowry of two hundred thousand crowns,
and he, on his side, has sworn that he will serve the Emperor, even
against the whole world."</p>

<p>The two young Normans crossed their breasts, glanced at each
other, and remained silent. De Lurcy continued:</p>

<p>"So far my trust goes in you that I will tell you everything.
There is to be a rising in the kingdom as soon as the King has
crossed the Alps; there is to be an invasion. The Emperor is to
enter France by Narbonne."</p>

<p>"England and the Emperor!" cried d'Argouges. "Has it gone as far
as that?"</p>

<p>"Further," smiled de Lurcy. "There is no possibility of failure.
The Emperor will have with him nearly twenty thousand Spaniards,
half that number of Switzers, ten thousand men-at-arms, and four
thousand horse. For his part, the King of England will descend on
the western coast with nearly twenty thousand foot-soldiers and
horse. As soon as the King has left Lyons on his way to Italy the
signal will be given for the revolt and the invasions."</p>

<p>"Has there been made a treaty for this?" asked d'Argouges.</p>

<p>"Yes; before I left Montbrison to come to you, Sieur Bonnet had
accompanied de Croy to Genoa with copies of the treaty that the
Connétable has signed. Dispatches in cipher have been sent
off to the King of England, to the Archduke Ferdinand, the
Emperor's brother. We must raise another ten thousand Switzers to
help&mdash;"</p>

<p>D'Argouges broke in: "Has the King had no inkling of this vast
conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he has his suspicions," smiled de Lurcy. "He does not
know anything certainly; it is clear that he would not leave the
kingdom if he had any sure knowledge."</p>

<p>D'Argouges, biting his narrow nether lip, said: "A revolt, you
said, Sieur de Lurcy. How many men does the Connétable hope
to be able to raise?"</p>

<p>"He cannot," replied de Lurcy, "be sure of the number, but at
least two thousand nobles have given their word to stand behind
him. He has fortified his two great strongholds Chantelle and
Carlat and sent the captain of his men-at-arms&mdash;you remember
him, La Glayette&mdash;to call to arms, exercise, and train the men
of the Bourbonnais, who are very loyal to His Highness. He has also
persuaded the Bishop of Puy to ask his kinsman, the Duke of Savoy,
to join them. The Connétable has perfect confidence in all
his friends and dependants; he has perfect confidence in you,
gentlemen, as you can understand by my candour."</p>

<p>"Most amazing candour!" muttered d'Argouges, slightly raising
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You think it is astonishing, but I know you, surely I know you?
The Duke told me to treat you as two knights who might be in
everything trusted."</p>

<p>"What does he want, sir?" asked the Sieur de Matignon,
rising.</p>

<p>"He wants you to prepare the way for the descent of the English
army on Normandy. After this has been successful he promises you,
between you, the government of that Province."</p>

<p>"We are to have that out of it&mdash;the governorship of
Normandy," said d'Argouges, rising also. "And what is the
Connétable to have?"</p>

<p>"He, with the English, and the Emperor if he is here in time,
will march to Paris. The country will be divided among the
conquerors. For himself, the Connétable hopes to revive
ancient Kingdom of Arles."</p>

<p>"And François de Valois?" exclaimed the two young men
together.</p>

<p>"François will be made prisoner between Moulins&mdash;you
know he proposes to pause there on his way to Italy&mdash;and
Lyons."</p>

<p>"And what is to become of him?"</p>

<p>"For my part," said de Lurcy, "I strongly recommend that he
should be put to death&mdash;an expensive fool, a wanton fripple
entirely under the dominion of his mother and his sister. What do
we want with this extravagant Valois who has involved the country
in one senseless war after another? But my lord would not have
that; he said that François was to be kept in honourable
captivity at Chantelle."</p>

<p>"You have told us enough!" exclaimed d'Argouges, throwing out
his hands. "Say no more. I will have no part in this. Your news has
astonished me. I had no suspicion of such a great, a treasonable
affair."</p>

<p>"What," cried de Lurcy, "you would draw back?"</p>

<p>"Nay," replied the Norman vehemently, "I have never been in it.
I thought that you meant that some service in full honour was
required of me&mdash;that, I owe the Duke&mdash;but nothing else,
nothing like this. What, you expect me to open Normandy to the
English that France may be dismembered? You say that king
François is worthless and extravagant&mdash;what are we to
expect from these foreigners? By God, no! My ancestors gave their
blood to defend France, I will not shed mine to betray her."</p>

<p>"That is my opinion also," cried the other Norman gentleman.
"I'll have nothing of this plot. God save France from such a King
as the Connétable would be, should he begin his reign by
such treachery as this!"</p>

<p>"What has he met but treachery and injustice?" cried de Lurcy
indignantly. "His right to the Throne is as good as that of
François or only by a hair's-breadth less."</p>

<p>"Say nothing more of it!" exclaimed d'Argouges. "I speak for my
friend also. We are Normans, we do not want the government of
Normandy on the terms on which you offer it, we do not want to see
the armies of King Harry of England marching across our fields. Say
no more. We have sworn; we shall try to forget what you have told
us. Go back to your master, de Lurcy, and tell him that we are
sorry indeed we have heard what we have heard."</p>

<p>The Connétable's agent stood silent, his arms folded on
his breast. He was amazed by this reception of his news, which he
had thought would have provoked enthusiastic loyalty.</p>

<p>How confident the Connétable had been when he had
arranged this meeting at Vendôme! He had said the two Norman
squires were to be absolutely trusted. He knew them, he had
declared, like his own brothers; he had covered them with benefits,
given them his love and friendship; he was sure of their
support&mdash;now this...</p>

<p>The two young men gathered up their swords, cloaks, and gloves
they had laid on the chair against the tapestried wall.</p>

<p>"Remember you have sworn," said de Lurcy, frowning on the ground
and seeing beyond the floor an ugly scene of the scaffold and the
headsman; what if these two young men were not to be trusted even
with the deadly secret he had so carelessly given them? He must
return at once to Moulins, where the Duke had been brought in a
litter from Montbrison.</p>

<p>"Remember you have sworn," he repeated harshly; he touched his
pocket where the relic lay wrapped in the lilac silk. "You will be
damned in this world and in the next if you betray us."</p>

<p>He then left the room abruptly, called up his servants, and
turned his train towards Moulins, riding fiercely.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The two shrewd, honourable, and patriotic Norman squires went to
the town of Lisieux in their native Normandy. They had discussed
together what they had better do in the terrible situation in which
they were placed, and they had soon devised a plan whereby they
could compromise with their oath, their obligation to the
Connétable, their loyalty to the King, and their loyalty to
Normandy.</p>

<p>Requesting an audience of the Bishop of Lisieux, they imparted
to him under the seal of confession the tale that de Lurcy had told
them in the inn of "The Three Kings" at Vendôme. The Bishop
listened, made no comment, offered the two gentlemen the
hospitality of his palace, and that night sent a messenger to the
Regent Louise with a close-writ paper containing the story of the
two Norman gentlemen; then, for greater security, he sent a
duplicate letter by another courier.</p>

<p>The King received these two letters at Saint Pierre de Moustier
after they had been read by the Regent Louise at Clery; he had been
on the eve of departing for Moulins, where he had heard that
Charles de Bourbon was lying sick with a tertian fever. This was
the second warning he had received about the Connétable's
conspiracy; the first was vague enough, but disquieting: one of his
household, the Sieur Descars, had said to him, "Sire, if I were
you, I should have an eye to the Connétable who, in his
solitary castle among the mountains, receives messages from the
Kind of England and the Emperor of Germany."</p>

<p>The King's long face took on a brooding and crafty expression as
he recalled this warning and read the two letters from the Bishop
of Lisieux.</p>

<p>His mother had, she wrote, taken all possible
precautions&mdash;she had sent out messengers on all the ways to
discover what was afoot in the Bourbonnais and the other estates of
the Connétable; she had written to Lisieux for the two
Norman gentlemen to be sent to her at once under a strong
escort.</p>

<p>François, after only a short hesitation, wrote his mother
a gay letter telling her that he had the matter well in hand and
knew perfectly well what to do. Then he sent another epistle to the
Connétable at Moulins saying that he could not visit him as
soon as he had hoped, as he had hurt his leg and must stay at Saint
Pierre till it was recovered. Having, through this pretence, gained
a certain delay, the King at once collected a company of Switzers
and four hundred archers. He also sent out directions that all the
roads were to be guarded, all the garrisons were to be strengthened
in Normandy, and the coast of that Duchy strongly defended so that
the King of England might receive a warm reception should he dare
to land there.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>When François had taken all these precautions, which he
did with cool alertness, he retired to his chamber in the best
house Saint Pierre de Moustier could afford, and, taking his long
face in his long white fingers, turned over in his mind what he
should do with Charles Bourbon.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a fortunate thing for himself that the
Connétable had engaged in this conspiracy. It made an
excellent excuse for ruining him, for stripping him of everything.
Since the arrogant Bourbon had refused the hand of Madame Louise,
François had intended to set down this subject, who had
always been too great and too haughty; now perhaps it could be done
immediately without any tedious delays of lawsuits; but there were
dangers too; how many were involved in this conspiracy and what of
the two great invading armies? And what of Charles himself, was he
really a man to be feared? François read over again the
letters that contained the confessions of the two Norman squires;
the scheme seemed well planned and detailed. De Lurcy had said that
Saint Vallier had urged Charles to give up the conspiracy, and the
Duke had replied:</p>

<p>"Cousin, what can I do? The King and Madame have done me much
wrong and wish to destroy me. They have already taken away my
property, and they wish to put me to death." And then, refusing to
discuss the matter any more, he had gone to play at the game of
flux.</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;the King smiled with foxy elegance to
himself&mdash;"I, too, must play my game."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles de Bourbon, waking out of the uneasy slumber of fever,
asked de Lurcy standing by his bed: "What is that great noise
without?" Then, confused in his mind, he answered: "Ah, I know, it
is the King arriving."</p>

<p>De Lurcy looked at him curiously. "Sire, why should you think it
is the King? He was to have come with but a small escort."</p>

<p>Charles smiled, more at his thoughts than at what de Lurcy said.
He remembered the Christmases and Easters that the King had spent
at Moulins; he had always arrived with so much noise and clatter,
the harsh light of torches, the jingle of horses' bells, the shouts
of the pages and the attendants, and always with, above everything,
the high laughter of Madame Louise.</p>

<p>De Lurcy had gone to the window and parted the curtains over the
strong blue of the summer night.</p>

<p>"It is indeed the King," he said after he had looked long and
steadily below. "His liveries without doubt. But he has with him
near a thousand men."</p>

<p>Charles raised himself on one elbow. "François comes to
Moulins with near a thousand men. Has something come out, have we
somewhere been indiscreet?" He could not think long or clearly; he
lay back again, shaken and bitten by the fever.</p>

<p>De Lurcy stood still at the window holding the curtains back
with his strong warrior's hands. If they had been betrayed there
was an end of this drama&mdash;death would come down like a black
curtain on all of them.</p>

<p>"Tell him," whispered the sick man from the high-set bed in the
alcove, "that I cannot see him now. Indeed, I am too ill. He may
send his own doctors to ascertain as much, if he doubts my word.
When I can, I will wait upon him."</p>

<p>De Lurcy left the room on this uneasy errand, and Charles lay
still, his hands folded on his breast, and thought himself in the
Abbey at Sauvigny with the two Duchesses, Anne and Suzanne, his two
beloved women, one either side of him. He had a great longing for
death, for the space and silence and enclosed light of the great
Dominican Abbey.</p>

<p>O to lie there, for ever and ever at peace, with the heart empty
and the mind closed and the hands clasped upon the breast in hopes
of the Resurrection&mdash;with a stone dog on which to rest his
feet and a stone angel to bend over his head!</p>

<p>He tossed into dreams; he thought his wife was there, in
crumpled white, her hunched shoulders showing under the veil, her
hands busy with garments for the children who would be born dead;
he thought that the other side of his bed was Anne of France urging
him to have nothing to do with the King of France or with the
King's mother, but to trust in the Emperor.</p>

<p>"And so I will," muttered Charles, suddenly twisting out of his
dream, half rising from the bed and setting his bare foot upon the
step, "so I will! I will have nothing to do with the King of
France."</p>

<p>The fever overcame him in surges; with difficulty he held
himself steady, sitting between his curtains.</p>

<p>De Lurcy had left the shutters open at the window&mdash;how blue
the night was, like the Virgin's robe, and faintly studded with
pin-pricks of stars! He thought of Rome, he longed for Rome almost
as deeply as he longed for death. To be there, on one of the Seven
Hills, seated on some of the golden-coloured masonry, among the
fallen pillars of antiquity, where the pigeons and the doves
circled their blue and violet pinions above the palaces, the
squares, and the churches. O, to be there seated in his black and
violet hood and robe, between the miniature painter and the
beggar-hermit, talking of everything and of nothing, but looking
down through the swathes of eglantine and ivy on to the Holy City,
the Eternal City.</p>

<p>Raffaello, the Umbrian painter, was dead, and he, Charles de
Bourbon, had never met him. But all the rooms that he had painted
could be seen, all those frescoed apartments&mdash;they were the
most beautiful in the world, people said, there was nothing like
them to be seen anywhere else; surely one day he, Charles, could go
in peace and gaze on them. There was the great Church of St. Peter
that was being raised with infinite labour on the ruins of the old
Basilica; there was the Library of priceless books, there were all
those things he wished to see; he believed that there too,
somewhere hidden, was the original group of "The Laocoön", for
surely that which François had showed so boastfully at
Fontainebleau was but a sham, as the gossips said. The word echoed
in the man's fevered mind&mdash;a sham, a pretence; what was
everything but that?</p>

<p>Nothing mattered but serving God by the way of beauty, and how
could that be achieved?</p>

<p>If he were only in Rome, a poor priest, a poor student, a singer
in the Vatican Chapel, a boy who ground the colours for whoever
painted in Raffaello's place; why, even a beggar sitting before one
of the leather mattresses at the top of the flights of golden steps
before the Basilica&mdash;surely there was peace!</p>

<p>How beautiful was Rome, how beautiful! He put his cold fingers
before his hot forehead and eyes, and saw the city pass, as it
were, in the palm of his hand&mdash;the thick, half-mouldering
walls where once the Emperor's sentinels had marched, and in
between the broken temples the façades with handsome
pillars, the goats browsing on the Tarpeian Rock, the huge
magnificence of the <i>Circus Maximus.</i></p>

<p>Leo was dead these two years, the man whom he, Charles, had sat
beside at the obscene, gay comedy at Bologna; dead, that stout man
who had peered with such avidity at the lewd scene behind the
gilded curtains on the raised, empurpled stage. He had died alone,
they said, without Sacraments or any company, no one being with him
but his buffoon. There was a different kind of man on the Papal
throne now, a Fleming of lowly birth, a saintly, peace-loving man
whom everybody despised and who was reported to be dying&mdash;when
the breath went out of his body surely the second Medici would
snatch the tiara that he had missed on his uncle's death?</p>

<p>There was no splendour, they said, now in the Vatican; the
beautiful rooms were empty, shuttered away, the designs of
Raffaello becoming covered with dust, the tapestries rolled up and
put aside, all the jewels packed for safety in the cellars. The
Pope Adrian was economical, careful, and pious, he despised all the
lures and gawds of the world, his life was one of humble simplicity
and virtuous sincerity&mdash;the Romans called him a barbarian.</p>

<p>Charles got out of bed, threw on his dark-violet chamber robe,
and began walking up and down the room. He remembered the infernal
masquerade that he had attended after the doctor Vercelli had given
him that draught, and those dancers seemed to be surging about him
now, with thick curling gilt horns and gilt-white masks, and necks
strung with blood-coloured stones and bosoms bare above corslets of
bronze.</p>

<p>He was still encircled by these visions of the fever when his
doctors entered and de Lurcy led him to his bed in the alcove.
There was a stranger among these physicians, one sent by the King,
for François believed that Charles might be feigning
sickness to avoid an unpleasant interview. But this man took back
such a report to François that the King's thin mouth curled
in a satyr-like smile. The doctor had said: "I would not be in the
position of Monsieur de Bourbon for anything&mdash;I believe that
his account is made."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>That night Charles was very ill, his soul almost loose from his
body, and he did not seem like a man who had worked long and
earnestly on a vast conspiracy, negotiating with a King and an
Emperor, trying to rouse a country against its monarch, organizing
here, contriving there, making all preparations for a revolt that
would send Europe into confusion; but rather like some poor pilgrim
who had travelled far and overcome his strength, and must lie down
and perish by the wayside long before he had reached his object,
the shrine of his adoration. For hours he was in delirium, and it
seemed to him that he was transported to Rome&mdash;it was the
Roman streets he walked, the Roman palaces he visited, and more
often than any other thing did he mount up that Roman hill and sit
upon the broken golden masonry and look down upon the yellow river
and the massive ruins.</p>

<p>Towards the dawn his mind cleared a little, and he saw de Lurcy
sitting there, two doctors behind him. They gave him a potion that
stung his throat, they propped him up in bed&mdash;his valet was
ready to comb his hair, wash his hands, and shave his face. When
all this had been done de Lurcy wave him his news. The King had
taken possession of the castle, he had posted sentinels at all the
doors, they had been changed twice in the night; he must know
something, if not everything.</p>

<p>"Who has betrayed me?" asked Charles wearily. De Lurcy answered
in a low voice, the doctors having withdrawn to the window space.
"I have thought much of those two Norman gentlemen&mdash;we were
too sure there. They seemed greatly astonished and dismayed."</p>

<p>"Did you not make their swear on a relic?" whispered Charles,
his head hanging on his pillows.</p>

<p>"Eh, but who knows they may have found a way? The King wishes to
see you. Will you let him come into your chamber?"</p>

<p>"Let him come."</p>

<p>At midday the King of France entered the Connétable's
chamber. His Majesty was attired in black satin cut over silver,
everything about him being ostentatiously splendid. A fine dark
beard in the Italian fashion now outlined his long, high-bred, and
crafty face, which the French so much admired; his black hair was
combed straight down either side of his slightly sunken cheeks. He
was now twenty-eight years of age, and his peculiar countenance had
become accentuated&mdash;the bony structure was very visible;
traces of disease, due to reckless ill-living, had marred that
manly beauty which his mother and sister still extolled&mdash;but
he remained a gay cavalier, very splendid and debonair, with a
mincing manner.</p>

<p>He spoke to the Connétable with the greatest
friendliness, resting on the bed his long hand, from the wrist of
which hung his black ruffles with a multitude of little cords. He
could see that the Connétable was a very sick man, and his
flickering smile was emphasized. Monseigneur de Bourbon was
certainly much changed: his face, almost thin, had the ugly grey
colour of sickness; his hair, carefully parted and combed and
hanging either side of his cheeks in the same fashion that the King
used, was lank and lustreless; the beautiful well-proportioned
contours of the face had a death-like sharpness; he maintained
himself with great dignity, though he had not the strength to sit
upright.</p>

<p>"I have heard," cried the King, with that apparent frankness
which covered his deepest duplicities, "that you have been engaged
with the Sieur de Croy in some plot against me, but of course I do
not believe anything so fantastic. Surely, cousin, you would not
have listened to any temptations from the Emperor, even for the
fear of losing your estates!"</p>

<p>"Have I not some reason," asked Charles with difficulty, raising
his head from the pillows, "to fear losing my estate, being reduced
to nothing? That is not easy, sire, when one has been placed
high."</p>

<p>"You need dread no such disaster," replied the King with easy
geniality. "Even if this lawsuit goes against you, my mother,
Madame Louise, and I will return you all you possess."</p>

<p>"It is strange, sire, that Madame Louise has been to the toil
and expense of this long lawsuit only to relinquish everything if
she wins it."</p>

<p>"It was a woman's caprice, and you, cousin, know on what it was
founded. Perhaps we can make a compromise there yet, eh? A wedding
instead of a lawsuit, fees for the priests instead of the
lawyers?"</p>

<p>Charles was silent; he closed his eyes, the corners of his pale
mouth set obstinately.</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the King, peering at him spitefully, "it is, I
Suppose, the Emperor's sister after all! Well, we shall see. The
real reason of my visit was not to talk of this stupid conspiracy,
in which of course I do not believe, but to urge you to come with
me to Italy."</p>

<p>"I am in no state to travel, sire."</p>

<p>"I mean, of course, when your illness is mended. Come cousin, do
you not wish to come with me to Italy, do you not wish to repeat
the successes of eight years ago, when we supped with the Pope at
Bologna?"</p>

<p>Charles contrived to raise himself on one elbow; he looked
straight at the Kind and replied:</p>

<p>"I wish very much to go with Your Majesty to Italy, and I give
you my word that as soon as I can bear to travel in my litter I
will set forth. This will probably be in a week's time."</p>

<p>"I would take you with me now," said the King; "I cannot delay,
my presence is urgently required at Lyons&mdash;but the doctors
tell me that I shall kill you if I move you."</p>

<p>François rose abruptly, pressed the sick man's hand in
his strong fingers, and strolled out of the room.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles soon learnt from de Lurcy that the King's fair words had
meant nothing&mdash;they were only spoken in order to effect his
arrest more securely; François had left Perault de Warthy in
charge of the castle with instructions to keep strict watch on the
Connétable, not to let him out of his sight until he had
brought him to Lyons, and to send constant reports of all that
happened at Moulins to Lyons.</p>

<p>Charles was thus no longer master in his own castle, which de
Warthy held for the King; the royal guard kept watch day and night,
and Perault de Warthy had all the keys.</p>

<p>For a fortnight Charles remained enclosed in his chamber,
admitting no one but his intimates; then de Warthy insisted on
seeing him, but was made to wait four or five hours in an
antechamber before he was admitted to the closet where the
Connétable lay, partly dressed in black and violet, reposing
on a couch at an open window looking out upon the rich field where
Susanne and Anne, the two Duchesses, had so often gazed, busy with
their women's work and talking of the children who never lived.</p>

<p>"I am here, de Warthy," smiled Charles, sitting up with an air
of animation. "You see that I am much recovered. I was abroad on my
mule for a few moments this morning in the park&mdash;I went out in
order to get accustomed to the air. I hope in a few days to be able
to travel to Lyons."</p>

<p>His looks belied his words; he was thin, hollow-faced, and spoke
with an unnatural nervousness. De Warthy believed that he had not
the strength to resist the royal orders any longer and so set out
for Lyons. The King waited there, upon de Warthy's report, another
five days for the coming of the Connétable, but as his
cousin still delayed, de Warthy was sent back to Moulins and
brought Charles in a litter as far as La Palice, when the
Connétable seemed in such great pain and was so feeble that
the doctors dare not take his pulse; nor could de Warthy get any
satisfaction out of the sick man himself, who sent for him to come
to his bedside and told him that it was not so much his illness as
his inability to obey the King that troubled him.</p>

<p>"My doctors advise me to try my native air&mdash;tell His
Majesty that when I am a little stronger I will go to him."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>When Perault de Warthy brought this news to the King,
François perceived that it was impossible to trap the
Connétable into his power, so he took extreme measures,
ordering the arrest of all the men whom he knew to be involved in
this conspiracy&mdash;Saint Vanier, who had supped with the King
that very night; Aymard Deprie, the Bishop of Puy; and several
others whose names had been given by de Lurcy to the Norman
squires, and by the Norman squires to the Bishop of Lisieux. And he
again sent Perault de Warthy to the Connétable with the
message that hitherto he, the king, had hesitated to believe in his
cousin's treachery, but that now he began to feel suspicious; the
royal message implored Monsieur de Bourbon to come to Lyons in
order to clear himself of all possible implication. With
unnecessary treachery François gaily added his royal promise
to forget any matter of dispute there might be between them and to
use mercy rather than justice in dealing with his beloved cousin.
But at the same time as he sent this message to lure the
Connétable into his power he sent the Bastard of Savoy and
the Maréchal de la Palice with four thousand footsoldiers to
take possession of the person of Charles de Montpensier, Duc de
Bourbon, Connétable of France.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles, on his side, was endeavouring to carry out the
engagements he had made with the Emperor and the King of England.
He sent his archer, Baudemarche, to bring up the four thousand
foot-soldiers that had been levied by the Seigneur de Saint
Saporin, and when de Warthy had left him at La Palice, he, throwing
off his largely feigned sickness, had hurried back to Gayete, where
he had seen Sir John Russell, sent by the King of England, a
Spanish captain, and a secretary of the Emperor, who had, by divers
secret ways and with much skill and circumspection, made their way
to this rendezvous.</p>

<p>That night another treaty was signed between the King of England
and Charles; it was decided that Henry should land in Picardy while
the Emperor invaded Languedoc; Henry was to send the hundred
thousand crowns which were to provide the first instalment of the
payment due to the Switzers whom the Connétable intended to
enrol; Sir John Russell suggested the addition of one clause to the
agreement that Charles steadily and even contemptuously
refused&mdash;this was that he should recognize Henry Tudor as King
of France, and as his vassal take an oath of allegiance to His
Britannic Majesty.</p>

<p>Charles put through this dull business with great energy. He had
in part recovered from his sickness, but still felt weak and was
troubled by the hallucinations of fever; he was, however,
stimulated by his danger. The fact that he had been betrayed had
almost ruined his plans; he did not know now if he would be able to
keep his engagements to the Emperor, and when he heard of the
arrest of his friends and allies he knew that he was playing for
more than the success of his conspiracy, but for his very life
itself.</p>

<p>"I can," he said to de Lurcy, "do nothing better than take
refuge in my strongest fortress, Chantelle. I might hold it until
the arrival of the Switzers."</p>

<p>He was carried from Gayete in a litter, but on learning from one
of his own men, who came up exhausted from hard riding, that
Perault de Warthy had been sent after him to bring him to the
King's presence by force, he, sick as he was, threw on a robe lined
with fur, a quilted silk hood, mounted a bay horse, and rode
eighteen miles without a pause until the great drawbridge of the
impregnable fortress of Chantelle was drawn up behind him; when the
King's messenger arrived, Charles ordered him to be admitted and
received him in the great hall, where a fire had been lit to
disperse the autumn airs. The Connétable's pale face in the
quilted violet hood was sunken and drawn, and there was an
unnatural gleam in the narrow eyes beneath the straight fringe of
lank hair, as he smiled with an expression that de Warthy had not
observed on his face before.</p>

<p>"Welcome, sieur; you have soon overtaken me."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, your spurs have served you well," replied King
François' man. "But why do you fly from me? I am come
nothing but to clear away the stain on your honour&mdash;"</p>

<p>Charles interrupted with a quick, nervous movement of his fine
hands.</p>

<p>"Have we not played that buffoonery to an end? I know how
eagerly I have been pursued, I know how many armed men have set out
to take me, I know how I have been betrayed. I have come to this
little house of mine to wait until the King will listen to me, but
now I am tired and wish to rest."</p>

<p>Then Perault de Warthy, who had but a few men with him, retired,
and hastened back to François to inform him that the
Connétable guessed his intention and could only be taken by
force.</p>

<p>No sooner had he gone than Charles summoned his friends, among
whom were those who had always been faithful to him and who desired
to share his fortunes to the end: Jean de l'Hôpital, his surgeon;
his two body-servants, Guinot and Bartholomé, and Monsieur de
Pompérant. There were also several captains of the guard and
of the archers, the Duke's chaplain, and many of those who had long
formed part of his household, and who were loyal not only to him
but to the memories of the two Duchesses, Suzanne and Anne.</p>

<p>Before he spoke with them the Duke dictated a letter, which he
sent by Monsieur d'Autan after Perault de Warthy. Thus it read:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">To my Sovereign Lord</span>,<br>
<br>
Monseigneur&mdash;I have written you fully by Perault de Warthy.
Now I send you Monsieur d'Autan in order that he may make you
understand the desire I have to serve you. I implore you,
Monseigneur, to believe what he will tell you from me, and I assure
you on my honour that I will not fail you, Monseigneur. I pray God
to give you a good and long life.<br>
<br>
Written in our house at Chantelle this 7th of September. Your very
humble and very obedient subject and servitor,<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">Charles</span>.</p>
<br>

<p>At the bottom of this letter Charles had written in his own
handwriting:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">But may it please the King to restore him his
properties, Monseigneur de Bourbon promises to serve the King with
all his heart wherever and whenever he pleases.</p>
<br>

<p>The Sieur de Lurcy was surprised, when the Duke showed him the
letters, and also at other epistles that he had written to Madame
Louise, and Madame Marguerite, the King's sister.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, do you write this to deceive the King? He knows
everything."</p>

<p>Charles did not reply; he was conscious of his own inner core of
weakness&mdash;or was it very fine honour, which a man downright
like de Lurcy could not possibly understand? He, Charles, Duc de
Bourbon, did not want war; he would rather live in peace on his
estates and be at least outward friends with François than
be forced to fight the lawsuit, to listen to the temptations of the
Emperor and of the King of England.</p>

<p>Betrayal! His head was not quite clear yet; the fever confused
him; yes, he had sent the letters out of weakness&mdash;touched
with treachery, perhaps, and spite. If Anne of France had been
there he would not have written them. He shrugged his shoulders,
refusing all explanation, and asked his friends if they thought he
could withstand a siege in Chantelle.</p>

<p>The captains who were in charge of the great fortress declared
that though it was accredited the most difficult place to take in
the whole of France, yet there were only fifteen pieces of
artillery and it was doubtful whether, if the King approached it
with all his force, it could long hold out; nor was it fully
provisioned&mdash;in the case of a long siege there would soon be a
scarcity of food, powder, and even water.</p>

<p>There was no news of the Switzers' coming up, and who knew how
long it might be before either the Emperor or the King of England
arrived in France?</p>

<p>"Everything has been ruined by this betrayal," said Charles with
a cold smile. "De Lurcy, was it your two Norman gentlemen? You see
what they have done."</p>

<p>"You see what I have done, monseigneur, in trusting them! It was
you who were so sure."</p>

<p>"The fault is my own," mused Charles. "I am not a man with a
single purpose."</p>

<p>None questioned him as to what he meant by this comment. They
said afterwards when they had left his presence that he was not the
same man since Anne of France had died.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The next morning, when the plans were still undecided, news
came, brought in by a peasant loyal to Charles, that the Bishop
with the Duke's letters to the King had been arrested by the
Bastard of Savoy at La Pacaudiere and taken prisoner with all his
escort; this move showed the King's hand plainly enough and that
his promises had all been false, the hopes he held out
fallacious.</p>

<p>"He intends to ruin me," smiled the Connétable.</p>

<p>How long was it since François had intended to ruin
Charles?</p>

<p>They had seemed, when they had been boys playing together,
equals, Princes both, little to choose between them, for pride,
presence, and great possessions and a fair future; yet
François had always perhaps intended to ruin Charles, who
was placed too high ever to be safe.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" said Charles, opening and shutting his
hand and looking down on the emptiness of his palm.</p>

<p>The answer was&mdash;in one word&mdash;flight.</p>

<p>The Connétable had himself spoken the shameful word, and
he took command of all the preparations for his departure from
Chantelle, yet it seemed to him insufferable that he should leave
this place; and, as he went from room to room giving his orders and
seeing that they were carried out, he was turning over in his heart
the things that he left behind, and it seemed to him that he could
not leave France as a proscribed man, as a hunted man, a man not
likely to return. In his head, still weakened with the fever, ran
the words of the story in the Bible&mdash;of the young man who was
exceedingly sorrowful because he had "great possessions".</p>

<p>Charles repeated to himself: "Great possessions." What were
they? A catalogue of them would have filled a large book.</p>

<p>Was it not truly worse than death to leave them? Why was it that
he could not stay to face the King and die? Even&mdash;if need
be&mdash;by the headsman's hand, kneeling on the scaffold in the
middle of the public square? His subtle, divided mind began to
wonder why it was men clung to life even when life was stripped of
all that made it worth the living.</p>

<p>Sauvigny, the great grey Abbey church full of peace and light,
where the Duchess Suzanne and the Duchess Anne, his dead children
and his ancestors, lay peacefully on the stone-tasselled
pillows&mdash;that must be left, and his castles, Moulins,
Chantelle&mdash;where he stood now&mdash;Montbrison, and all the
fields, those pastures that Suzanne had loved to see covered with
daisies, the blue horizon, the river that fed the capital of his
Duchy, the farms, and even the sheepfolds and the woodmen's huts,
the trees that made so rich a shade on the rising upland, all the
rich outline of the Bourbonnais and the Auvergne, the little walled
towns where walked the sentinels who wore his colours, the citadels
where his flag floated&mdash;all lost, all to be left behind to
feed the cruel extravagance of François de Valois and the
hard rapacity of Madame Louise.</p>

<p>There were his personal possessions, too; there were the
paintings that he had paid men large sums of money for, the
carvings, the great library of books, printed and
manuscript&mdash;nay, he would even have to leave behind the great
volume <i>L'Enseignement</i> that Suzanne had so loved, that she
had turned over with her pale hands on the white bed when he had
put the pearls beside her, the day that she had lain sick with the
little heir who had not lived, in the cradle at the foot of her
couch.</p>

<p>He had not that precious book with him at Chantelle, it was at
Moulins; it would have to be left behind. There were his dogs, his
horses and all his servitors, young men whom he was training, the
women of his household whom Suzanne and her mother Anne had
trained; there were the furniture, the tapestries, the silken and
fur garments&mdash;yea, even his dead wife's garments with the
small waists and the flowing over-robes and the tight sleeves, some
of them embroidered by her own hands; there were the musical
instruments, the flutes, the little portable organs, the violas,
some of them with great smooth bellies like autumn melons, some
with heads carved at the handles like swans, some set with amber
and agate, tortoiseshell and pearl; there were his own robes of
velvet lined with martin fur and vair; there were his caps and
hats, with chains of gold, with drops of jewels; but his mind went
again and again to his books.</p>

<p>Charles paused in the midst of the directions he was giving to
de Lurcy.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that I am to leave my library behind?" he asked,
and the grim man glanced at him sideways to see if he were sick and
weakening, But Charles thought only of the book as he had seen it
in the frail hands of Suzanne. On the flyleaf was written, <i>This
book is mine, Susanne de Bourbon</i>&mdash;beneath this some verses
that he had himself written for her, shortly before their marriage,
and then their initials intertwined, mottoes and palms. Then, most
precious of all, portraits of the two Duchesses, Anne and
Suzanne, seated at their reading, and the arms of Bourbon, the
three <i>fleurs de lis,</i> placed two and two...Charles felt that
if that volume had been in his possession now, he would have felt
the less pain even at leaving France.</p>

<p>De Lurcy touched his arm anxiously, and spoke in a tone of
reproach.</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking, monseigneur? our lives hang upon
quick action now.</p>

<p>"Why," answered Charles, "do we think so much of our lives when
we love other things of higher value?"</p>

<p>"I spoke as a man. If you escape now, you may yet return to
regain all your possessions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to lie beside my wife and kin in Sauvigny?" smiled
Charles.</p>

<p>He held up the lamp that he carried and looked round the large,
dusk-filled apartment; the light gleamed in the gold threads of the
bright tissues on the walls, on the gold in the spines of the
volumes in the tall cases, in the gilding of the angels' heads and
wings in the bosses of the ceiling. De Lurcy gazed mournfully at
the tall, hesitant, and dark figure of his master, whose thin face
was so brooding and overcast; had he not known Charles de
Montpensier, Duc de Bourbon, to be a great captain, he would have
thought him in that moment a weakling.</p>

<p>Charles lowered the lamp and gripped his friend's arm.</p>

<p>"Come, let us save our lives, since there is nothing else that
we can save!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In the warm, humid darkness the little party left Chantelle;
they were soon absorbed in the night, as they turned in the
direction of the valley of the Creuse. A few lanterns lit their
way; it was not possible for Charles, though he often looked back,
to see more than the massive outline of Chantelle, a shadow among
the shadows; from some of the upper windows a little brightness
gleamed; no flag floated above the keep.</p>

<p>"De Lurcy," said Charles, "it is one of the fairest most stately
homes in the world&mdash;containing some of the rarest
treasures&mdash;and it is but one of many that I leave behind!"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, you have your life and your sword."</p>

<p>"De Lurcy, do you think that one may trust the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"I should, where I in your place, monseigneur, trust no one save
yourself and those servitors who have risked something for your
sake."</p>

<p>"Myself! Had I been worthy of trust, de Lurcy, I had not been in
this shameful case now!"</p>

<p>As the soft night-wind blew on his face he felt bitterly
conscious of his own weakness and failure&mdash;as if he had
betrayed the love and trust of those two dead women who would
perhaps wait for him in vain in Sauvigny. He rode without state,
unarmed save for his sword, in civilian attire, wearing a red cap
under his black hat; his garment was a short robe of black cashmere
over a doublet of violet satin; two hundred and forty horsemen
followed him; thirty thousand gold crowns were divided amongst
them; this treasure was placed in the saddlebags; the Duke's own
body-servants carried caskets of jewels, among them the pearls of
the Duchess Suzanne. All his personal followers had some valuable
hidden in their sleeves, their chests, their pockets, some object
of gold or silver, of diamond, pearl, sapphire, ruby.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>As they rode through the night the Connétable thought of
the promises he had made the Emperor, none of which he would be
able to keep. It was not possible now for him to rouse a third of
France to support the invaders or to put any men into the field to
help the King of England; he would not be able to send any
treasure, or indeed to offer the Emperor anything at all save his
own person.</p>

<p>He thought, with austere simplicity, "I am glad I am a good
general&mdash;at least as good as any the Emperor has in his
service," and Charles smiled thinly in the dark to think it should
come to this, that he, the Connétable of France, should be
no better than one of the Switzers offering his services for
pay.</p>

<p>As the autumn dawn broke they entered the long valley of the
Creuse; at the little church of Montaigut, the Duke heard Mass.
They stopped again at the château of La Fayette, where the
Connétable made himself known to the lord and drank some
wine; he refused food and shivered often. His followers muttered
among themselves, anxious as to their safety, excited because of
the treasure that they carried. The country was peaceful, there was
no sign of any pursuit; the sky was the colour of a dead violet
behind the amber outline of the low, near hills; the men-at-arms
rode slowly at their ease, the mules and horses burdened with the
saddlebags weighted with gold. Twice the Duke fainted and had to be
lifted off his horse and set under a tree to rest; and each time
when he came back to his senses he thought to himself:</p>

<p>"It would have been better if I had died before worse
happened."</p>

<p>At nightfall they gained the little castle of Herment. The lord,
Henri Arnauld, received them courteously; the Duke, his friends,
and body-servants entered this place to pass the night, for there
seemed no fear of immediate pursuit; and the archers camped in the
sloping field and orchards where the little red apples were
tumbling into the dry grass, and picketed their horses under trees
full of plums drying in the autumn sun and covered with buzzing,
yellow wasps.</p>

<p>As soon as they were closeted together, the Sieur de Lurcy told
Charles that he believed the archers were not to be trusted; he
knew that some of the captains among them were secretly in the pay
or service of the King and were going about even now, bribing and
exhorting the men to make him prisoner.</p>

<p>He took the Duke to the uncurtained window and, holding him by
the arm, pointed out the scene in the orchards of apple trees and
plum trees where the horses were picketed, and showed him the dark
figures of the men moving about from one rude encampment to
another.</p>

<p>"Think how much money they have, my lord," he said, "and how
easy it would be for them to seize you and the few of us who are
faithful to you and take us to Lyons. Think what a reward they
would have from the king."</p>

<p>"Why should I not trust them?" asked Charles faintly. His limbs
could no longer support him; he sank down on the old high-backed
chair with arms.</p>

<p>"Trust them if you will," said de Lurcy, "but it is an ignoble
end to die on a scaffold, knowing that one's name is dishonoured
for ever."</p>

<p>The Duke made no answer but took off his sword, his black coat,
scarlet cap, and black woollen robe, and flung them down and
crossed himself on the bed where the bare rings hung on the bare
poles, the curtains having not yet been put in place; and there he
slept, half drowsed by fever, half unconscious from fatigue.</p>

<p>Then de Lurcy took the business into his own hands and sent out
one of the body-servants, Peloux, as soon as it was light, to
inform the archers in the orchard that the Duke had already gone on
his way.</p>

<p>Some of the men seemed to listen to this with relief, as if they
were glad to be rid of a difficult loyalty, while some seemed in
fear and trouble; and one of the captains demanded:</p>

<p>"But what, then, are we to do? To follow him or to turn back
across France?"</p>

<p>The servant shrugged his shoulders and said, "Let him save
himself who can," and turned back into the château.</p>

<p>Some of the archers and men-at-arms and their officers
dispersed, dividing among themselves the booty in the saddle-bags,
many returning across France to take service with the King and to
boast of their loyalty to the House of Valois, and some making
their way to their homes, and a few going towards Italy to make
their fortunes in the chances of war and travel. And when all had
gone and nothing was left in the despoiled orchard but the boughs
broken on the ground where the men had pulled down and plucked the
fruit, and the ashes of the fires where they had cooked with their
pannikins, and the sweet, trampled, broken grass where the horses
had been picketed, the Connétable sent for the five people
who remained with him&mdash;Jean de l'Hôpital, his surgeon; one
Goudinières; two body-servants, Guinot and Bartholomé; and
Monsieur de Pompérant.</p>

<p>This last gentleman had been condemned to death for slaying a
miserable <i>mignon</i> of the King's in a duel, and the
Connétable had saved his life. As for the servant Peloux, he
had not returned after his message to the archers, but had gone
with them.</p>

<p>Charles and these five, then, guided by the lord of Herment,
Henri Arnauld, who had promised to act as guide, set out on
horseback; the two body-servants led mules, which were laden with
bags of gold and caskets of jewels; all had received orders to
treat the Duke as if he were one of themselves.</p>

<p>They passed through La Tour and Saint Donnatt near Mount Dore.
There, at a rude inn, they took some food; Monsieur
Pompérant sat at the head of the table as if he were the
master and the others were his servants; the Connétable sat
in the ingle and watched the pale smoke go up from the wood
fire.</p>

<p>The night was passed at Coudat-en-Ferrières, but at dawn they
were on horseback again, and that night they reached the little
village of Ruines, which was in the mountains of Auvergne near the
old walled city of Saint Flour. They brought a guide with them from
the last village, a cobbler, for Monsieur Arnauld was no longer
sure of the path, but the cobbler soon lost his Way in these
trackless mountains.</p>

<p>At length when they came on to the highroad they encountered
fresh dangers, for they saw, close to Saint Flour, a company of
about eight thousand Garcon foot-soldiers marching from Lyons to
Bayonne to join Maréchal Lautrec in Italy.</p>

<p>Without any effort to disguise himself Charles rode forward, his
company surrounding him, and passed the soldiers without exciting
any attention. Thus they reached a small house belonging to
Monsieur Pompérant, which was named <i>La Garde,</i> and
there the Connétable lay for four days. He had been
travelling across his own lands and his subjects had all been
faithful&mdash;no one had betrayed him, though many had seen him
and many must have guessed his identity.</p>

<p>One of these loyal servants brought news to <i>La Garde</i> that
King François had, by the sound of trumpets, published the
rebellion of the Connétable of France throughout the
kingdom; he had also promised ten thousand gold crowns to anyone
who should deliver to him this Charles de Montpensier, Duc de
Bourbon. Charles then had to think of his future plans; his mind
and his body were sunk and weak. De Pompérant suggested that
he should go to his faithful town of Carlat, but he knew that this
place was not well fortified.</p>

<p>"If I could not hold Chantelle," he said, "I could not hold
Carlat"; and it seemed to him as he lay there in the peace of the
little country house that his only chance was to get across the
frontier, to make his way across the mountains&mdash;the Emperor
with his forces was at Roussillon. But de Pompérant, going
out to See how the land lay, came tack with the news that it would
be impossible to cross the mountains because the Maréchal
Foix was keeping watch and ward there and looking out for de
Bourbon, who was known to be somewhere in that district.</p>

<p>By one chance and another the Connétable had now with him
only de Pompérant and the valet Bartholomé, and they
turned back towards Lyons, passing by way of the village of
Vauquelles, where the woman at the inn recognized de
Pompérant but thought that Charles was only his servant.</p>

<p>They then went to Vienne. There they pretended to be three
archers of the King's guard and learnt that the whole
Dauphiné side of the river was guarded, because Charles was
known to be in the neighbourhood. So they avoided the bridge and
crossed by a ferry further on.</p>

<p>On this boat were twelve of those soldiers who were searching
for the Connétable, and they recognized de Pompérant
but took no notice of Monsieur de Bourbon, whom they regarded as a
servant, for he was now wearing his own livery and kept his quilted
hood over his face. After they had reached the opposite bank they
marched along the highroad to Grenoble, but presently slipped
across the fields towards the deeply wooded hills.</p>

<p>They found some rest and refreshment at the house of an ancient
widow who was known to Monsieur de Pompérant. In the middle
of the meal that she gave them one of the servants came in with the
news that the Provost with a large body of archers was about a
league off searching for the Duc de Bourbon. They affected to take
no notice of this intelligence but finished their food, slipped
away from the table, mounted their horses, and rode away up the
wildest part of the mountains, up the rough road that led towards
Chambéry.</p>

<p>That night they slept under the sky, and in the morning when
they started again they met many soldiers hunting for Monsieur de
Bourbon. They had meant to go to Susa, but they heard that Saint
Pol, one of the King's generals, was on that road, marching to join
Admiral Bonnivet. So again the way had to be altered and they
passed over the Mont du Chat near Aix-les-Bains, crossed the Rhône
about eight leagues above Lyons, and reached Sainte Claude in
Burgundy.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The Connétable was now out of the power of the King of
France; he was received with great respect and magnificence by the
Sovereign Bishop of Geneva, the partisan of the Emperor, who
honoured him by a large escort of cavalry and after he had rested
awhile in the care of this Prelate, he was joined by most of those
whom he had been forced to leave on the way&mdash;de Lurcy, Peloux,
and others.</p>

<p>Soon after came a messenger from the King of France with a
dispatch, in which François, who declared that he had heard
with amazement of the flight of the Connétable, offered to
restore to the fugitive all his dominions and to repay to him all
the amounts due to him for the costs that he had been put to for
his law-suit and his flight.</p>

<p>Charles saw nothing in this but a monstrous duplicity. He handed
the King's letter back to the messenger saying:</p>

<p>"It is too late."</p>

<p>Then the man demanded of him the Sword of Connétable of
France and the Collar of the order of St. Michael; Charles
replied:</p>

<p>"Tell the King that he took from me the Sword of
Connétable as he took from me the command of the vanguard
and gave it to Monsieur d'Alençon. As for the Collar of his
order, you will find it at Chantelle under the pillow of my
bed."</p>

<p>That night he sat up alone in the manor house where he stayed at
Besançon and changed the devices and mottoes that he had
used in the days of his splendours to those that he intended to use
in the days of his difficulties and perils. He wrote out on a sheet
of parchment his desires and then gave this to his secretary to
give to his armourer, for now, by the courtesy of the Emperor he
was surrounded by a handsome household again.</p>

<p>On his sword was to be cut the words <i>Omnis Spes in Ferro</i>,
and his device of the flying stag, with the motto
<i>Espérance</i>, was to be altered to <i>Victory or
Death</i>.</p>

<p>When he had done this, which seemed to him to strip him of all
connection with the past, he reviewed his position.</p>

<p>He had lost everything; he was a fugitive, a landless man; he
had lost his great possessions, his enormous wealth, his high
castles, splendid position; he had nothing to offer the young
Emperor but himself, his name for what it might still be worth, his
skill as a soldier. The old Pope, Adrian VI, was dead; the Conclave
was electing his successor, and no one doubted but that it would be
another Medici, who, by gigantic bribery and intricate art, would
contrive to snatch the Papal Tiara.</p>

<p>The Connétable's thoughts went to Rome and the Red Hats
sitting there and the prospect of another Medici's ruling in the
Vatican. He dropped his tired face in his hands; he had forced his
own character, done things against his better judgment and been
driven to desperate action, while his mind was misted by fever.</p>

<p>"I think," he mused, "I should have done none of it had I been
well."</p>

<p>He sat there out of all personal peril, ignominiously safe, with
the future before him like a confused web spun out of blood and
tears, and an odd unbidden picture came before his mind. It was of
that heretic German monk, who had, for some years, troubled the
world and had defied the great Pope Leo (now dead), calling, upon
God, and who now was a prisoner in the Wartburg, translating the
Latin Bible into the homely German tongue.</p>

<p>Charles had never thought much of this man, who seemed to him
partly ignorant, partly spiteful&mdash;a presumptuous, stupid
monk.</p>

<p>Now this figure of the coarse, heavy German who had dared to
defy Rome came into his mind; he thought of the Diet of Worms held
two years before and of the figure that this Martin Luther had made
there. What had he said, that lonely man, faced by two hundred and
four judges, the Emperor's six Electors, twenty-four Dukes, seven
Margraves, thirty Prelates, seven ambassadors, and crowds of
princes and deputies.</p>

<p>He was asked:</p>

<p>"Are these writings yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will you retract them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Begone, then."</p>

<p>And what had been his final words?</p>

<p>"Here am I. I cannot do otherwise, so help me God, Amen."</p>

<p>The Emperor, whom the Connétable of France was now bound
to serve, had styled this monk a fiend in human form; but Charles
de Bourbon, the weary fugitive, thought of him with envy and
admiration.</p>

<p>"Could I have done as much? Could I have stood like that and
defied them all? No, with my high position, my careful training, I
had to fly like a dog that fears the whip."</p>

<p>He crushed out his candle with nervous fingers, and flung his
arms across the table and rested his head on them so that the lank,
black hair fell over his violet coat; and all his kin seemed to
crowd about him&mdash;the women, the children and the old men, his
young warlike brother, who lay in his father's grave in
Naples&mdash;demanding of him what he had done with their heritage
and their name and their possessions.</p>

<p>"But what hope have I, what chance, when I scarcely know what it
is I wish to do? To serve the Emperor against the King of France,
to bring down the King of France and Madame Louise, his
mother?"</p>

<p>There was something ignoble about such ambitions&mdash;they did
not warm his chilled and lifeless heart.</p>

<p>He remembered, as one in mid-winter may remember the daisies and
the spring, those nobler hopes he had once had&mdash;to leave all
these worldly gawds and retire with his wife to some castle, high
among the pines end mountains that were his by long right; and to
live there in the pure thin air among painters, sculptors, and
writers of magnificent books, composing poetry, brooding over
philosophy, educating his son, riding abroad in the early morning
when the dew was on the firm grass, returning at night when the
light was level across the fields where the clean sheep browsed;
and so up to that mountain home where she, in her white gown with
her little malformed shoulder raised under her fine veil, would be
waiting.</p>

<p>It had not been such an impossible dream, but it had been
snatched from him as a glass of wine may be snatched from thirsty
lips and broken so that the liquor within is lost for ever.</p>

<p>"And so I must go on and take my place."</p>

<p>He thought with a stir about his heart of Rome, the golden
ruins, the purple sky, the flight of doves and pigeons. Perhaps
some day when all was over and he had kept his word to the Emperor,
and fought for him, perhaps won battles for him, he would retire to
Rome and live among those antique ruins within the sound of the
church bells, within sight of the massive theatres and palaces, of
the goats browsing on the Tarpeian Rock; live and die a hermit with
shells in his hat and sandals on his feet, and repent of his sins
with the memory of Suzanne in his heart&mdash;at peace, at peace
for ever, in Rome, the Eternal, the Sacred City, which lay at the
heart of the universe, as gold lies at the bottom of a
crucible.</p>

<p>He put the dream aside and, sighing, faced his uncertain and
toilsome future.</p>

The Cardinal's Bathroom.<br>
Summer 1524.</h2>
<br>

<p class="verse">Misspent, fair rose, your tiny day<br>

That fools may sniff and eat.<br>
<br>
Better far, your sister flower<br>

<p class="first">
THE great regret of Giulio de' Medici, Pope Clement VII, was
that Raffaello was dead. Michael Angelo lived, but was sullen and
out of humour with His Holiness, and only worked reluctantly to
complete the great mausoleum in San Lorenzo. But Clement had
Benvenuto Cellini in his service and Giulio Romano and other pupils
of the Umbrian, and the Pope began again to continue the decoration
of the Vatican apartments that had remained closed during the
short, sad Pontificate of Adrian VI.</p>

<p>All the artists and craftsmen of Rome, who had believed
themselves ruined while the ascetic Fleming who had abhorred art as
a satanic device was on the Papal throne, now hastened to begin
eagerly their beautiful labours.</p>

<p>Great chambers that Raffaello had begun were to be finished;
Clement ordered Romano and his assistant to paint <i>The Triumph of
Constantine</i> from the master's design.</p>

<p>The huge palace and the magnificent church that had been, under
the Fleming, silent, save for the sound of prayers and the singing
of holy chants, now resounded with the blows of hammers, the sound
of chisels, and the quick footsteps and loud voices of the workmen
hurrying to and fro with scaffolding, with carvings, with mortar
and plaster, with all the paraphernalia of the arts of the
decorator.</p>

<p>All Rome was glad that another Medici wore the Tiara in place of
that sad saint who had cared nothing for the Bawds of this
world.</p>

<p>Clement moved amid the splendour with his light step and his
high-held, handsome, disagreeable face, his long black eyes and
unpleasantly smiling lips, not altogether content though his
ambitions had been so strangely gratified. He might have thought it
beyond his furthest hopes that he, a bastard Medici, should have
contrived, however highly he had bribed, to reach this height; but
the thing was done and he was there, and he had no thought save to
hold his position by using every possible shifty intrigue and
treacherous device that he had learnt while in his uncle's service.
He cared nothing for either Emperor or King; he meant to hold the
balance between them and to see that if it tipped any way it would
be into that which would be to the benefit of the House of Medici.
No one trusted him and few liked him&mdash;but he was a Medici and
magnificent.</p>

<p>At first he remained, outwardly at least, allied with the young
Emperor, and it was with nervous dissatisfaction that he had learnt
of the failure of the two expeditions; that of the Imperial Forces
and that of the King of England, which had followed the conspiracy
of the Connétable.</p>

<p>While the fugitive Charles had been at the Court of his cousin,
the Marchese of Mantua, the English expedition had totally failed
and had been led back to Calais by Suffolk; the Emperor had led his
vast forces across the Pyrenees, but had been driven back by odet
de Foix, Maréchal de Lautrec, who had repulsed him to the
walls of Bayonne.</p>

<p>Irritated by having his mind distracted from his personal
pleasures by these dull politics, Clement had waited anxiously for
news of the movements of the French: François had remained
at Lyons to stamp out the Bourbon conspiracy; Admiral Bonnivet in
command of the French Army had crossed the Ticino; Bourbon, coming
down from Mantua, where his aunt thought him "very handsome and
very melancholy" and condoled with him in all his misfortunes, was
given the command of the Imperial troops.</p>

<p>The Duchy of Milan had been again lost to France, and when
Clement had found himself Pope, affairs had been going so well for
the Emperor that there had been no occasion for His Holiness to
hesitate as to which side he should secretly and not openly
support.</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon had been sent on an expedition into Provence
to take Marseilles, that spring of 1524, and while the Pope was
occupied with recommencing the work in the Vatican, he was waiting
for the dispatches which would inform him of the fall of the great
Provençal town.</p>

<p>Clement remembered the Frenchman at Bologna when they had
together watched the comedy in the painted <i>salon.</i> He felt no
sympathy for him, for he had no warm feelings to give any man,
being cold-hearted and wholly selfish; but he considered that the
Connétable was a good soldier and also a great noble who had
been deeply wronged, and that both his generalship and his hatred
might be useful to the Emperor and therefore to Rome.</p>

<p>When Clement looked abroad he saw many troubles that caused his
smooth and haughty brow to frown peevishly. There was that ex-monk
Martin Luther, who had at length thrown off his monk's habit and
defied the Church of Rome&mdash;little matter for that, Rome was
used to dealing with half-witted fanatics, but this Martin Luther
numbered his supporters by hundreds, by thousands; Papal envoys
placed all over Europe sent daily reports to Clement of the
intrigues of these heretics, who might be compared to locusts over
Europe, eating up the fresh green corn and sucking the sweet honey
that should have been the perquisites of Holy Church.</p>

<p>Clement suspected everyone; he felt hostile towards the young
Emperor&mdash;a strong, hard-working, sincere and simple man; he
disliked and envied the magnificent King of France with his long,
foxy face, and his sly, treacherous mother, and it had given him
some pleasure to bring out the marble group of "The Laocoön"
from the chamber where Leo had hidden it and so let the King know
that it was but a copy that he showed so boastfully at
Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>The Pope was vexed at the failure of the Bourbon conspiracy; it
had made the King of France so much more powerful, because he had
been able to annex, on the Connétable's flight, all his vast
estates thus destroying the last of the great feudal lords and
consolidating the Kingdom of France. Clement envied all the Bourbon
treasures, which François had confiscated, the superb
library, the gorgeous tapestry, the caskets of jewels, the carvings
and statues, the suits of armour, the horses and dogs&mdash;all the
accumulated grandeur that the House of Bourbon had gathered during
generations had been divided between the boastful, extravagant King
and his avaricious, wanton mother.</p>

<p>Clement had lifted his haughty lips at that news; he despised
the Connétable for not having been able to play the game
better.</p>

<p>"You have been trained so discreetly, you have been fooled so
utterly, you have fallen so low from such a height! You must have
been," thought de Medici coldly, "imprudent, foolish, weak."</p>

<p>Who was it that Charles had trusted too much; how had his plans,
devised so carefully with the King of England, with the
Emperor&mdash;gone so wrong?</p>

<p>The Medici pressed the tips of his long, delicate fingers
together, and thought with scorn of all these men; he was so safe
in Rome, so supreme; he was able to play them all off one against
another&mdash;King, Emperor, Connétable, and that Englishman
who meddled so clumsily in European affairs.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The Pope had left Cellini's workshop, where he had viewed with a
deep and serene satisfaction all the rich and gorgeous objects that
his goldsmith had completed&mdash;brooches as large as saucers,
goblets of rock crystal, a piece of unicorn's horn set with squares
of gold and silver, pins with emerald heads, daggers. One by one he
had taken them up in his delicate perfumed hands and put them down
again; he had said nothing, but through his mind had always gone
the triumphant thought: "I am the Medici, I am the Pope. Here in
Rome I am safe, creating my own splendour, spinning it out of my
own bowels as the spider spins the web, not to be harmed or
threatened, while outside the walls of Rome lesser men play their
stupid, bloody games."</p>

<p>Clement loved pageantry as much as Leo had loved it; anything in
the way of a show or a spectacle diverted him so that he forgot all
serious matters; he liked masquerades and costly suppers,
bullfights, processions of triumphal cars, and regattas on the
yellow waters of the Tiber; he even, like Leo too, enjoyed seeing
the diversions of the people, the rolling of barrels, with fat pigs
inside, down the long slope of the grass-grown mound near the Porta
San Sebastiano. How amusing it was to see the peasants fighting for
the casks and their contents as they bumped on the sward at the
bottom of this hill! Clement enjoyed every moment of Carnival-time
and had revived that Tuscan spectacle which had so pleased
Leo&mdash;a battle of oranges&mdash;when the Papal lackeys in a
wooden fortress defended themselves with the golden fruit against
another party who attacked them similarly armed.</p>

<p>The new Pope had himself designed cars for the triumphal
processions through the narrow streets of Rome&mdash;one of them
had shown in symbolic figures Italy, another the Tiber, another the
she-wolf of Rome, and yet another Alexander the Great.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo, Cellini, Giulio Romano, and other artists had
designed the costumes for these pageants. The Pope liked anything
that was scarlet and purple, that was clasped with jewels; he
admired handsome caps that had long feathers and diamonds or pearls
pendent on the forehead; he was passionately interested in the
grotesque and odd, and nothing pleased him better than a visit to
the Papal menagerie, where he kept the elephant sent by the King of
Portugal, and two camels, as well as lions and tigers beautiful as
Fame.</p>

<p><br>
On this glorious day of high summer the Pope, dismissing all
sordid cares from his mind, went to inspect the apartment which
contained Raffaello's pictures and where Giulio Romano was then
working. He knew them all by heart, these splendid frescoes that
contained representations of all the Pagan deities and all the
Christian virtues, and portraits of every notable personage who had
adorned the Court of Julius II or Leo X. Giulio Romano was
completing the great picture of <i>The Triumph of Constantine</i>
from the designs of the master. When the Pope, making a sign to the
workmen to take no notice of his presence, stepped behind the
artist, he thought again with a pang of deep emotion:</p>

<p>"If only Raffaello had lived!"</p>

<p>This friendship with the Umbrian painter seemed to him the most
beautiful event in his life&mdash;he was proud to think that it was
for him, when he had been Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, that
Raffaello had painted his last picture, <i>The Transfiguration,</i>
which had been carried in silent procession through the streets of
Rome to the painter's tomb in the Pantheon after it had stood in
his death-chamber; the Cardinal had ordered the picture for the
Cathedral Church at Narbonne, when he had been appointed to that
bishopric; now he intended that it should never leave Rome.</p>

<p>He stood, elegant and silent, leaning on his secretary's
shoulder and watching the glowing figures, still glistening with
wet paint, which seemed to move across the wall of the spacious
chamber known as the Hall of Constantine. He looked so earnestly at
that crowd of Christian and Pagan warriors mounted on their
prancing, feathered horses that he seemed to lose himself in those
ancient days. He identified himself with these ancient heroes and
thought of himself as greater than he was, as indeed greater than
any man could be. Giulio Romano was glorifying him in many
pictures&mdash;he was to be seen in the <i>Baptism of
Constantine,</i> disguised as Pope Sylvester; not only were these
unparalleled pictures to celebrate the secular pride and power of
the Pontiff, and the great glories of the House of Medici, but they
were to celebrate him&mdash;the bastard Giulio, Clement Septimus,
Pontifex Maximus.</p>

<p>How different were these days from those two miserable years
when the saintly old Adrian had lived on a ducat a day in one of
the most obscure of the apartments in the Vatican, attended by no
one but an old Flemish hag!</p>

<p>Clement looked round upon the splendid <i>salon,</i> and his
black, almond eyes became drowsy with pleasure. He was, like his
uncle, chaste, and had no vices; temperate in all his habits, he
loved only splendour; he intended that the Vatican should be again
as it once had been&mdash;the centre for hunts, for feasts, for
music, for jests, for everything that was gay and beautiful and
strange.</p>

<p>With a gracious sign to the artists to continue their work,
Clement proceeded to an antechamber and looked at the gorgeous pair
of carved doors on which were being cut his curious emblem the rays
of the sun falling in full splendour on a crystal globe that stood
on a pedestal marked with the words <i>Candor Illaesus,</i> and
passing hence so as to set fire to a tree in full leaf.</p>

<p>This device, which had been invented by the Pope's treasurer,
was to show that Clement's candour of mind would render him proof
against the slanders of his enemies. Clement's cold lips curved
into a little smile as he placed his strong fingers over the sharp
wood. He thought of the grey mausoleum in San Lorenzo, not with
dread or melancholy but with eagerness and delight; he wished to
erect a library near by to contain the magnificent collections of
books and manuscripts that had been left him by his uncle, Leo X.
He wished that Michael Angelo, whom he admired so deeply, would
show more interest in this work. As he had said in a letter of
instruction to the artist:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Thou art aware that Popes are short-lived, and we
are all eagerness to behold the chapel with the monument of our
race, or at least to learn of its completion. So also with the
library; therefore we rely on thy diligence to perform our
commands. Be assured that commissions and rewards will never be
lacking during our lifetime.</p>

<br>

<p>But he was yet young, not fifty years of age, and he intended to
see his own tomb completed by the hands of Michael Angelo in his
own lifetime; and Clement, as he touched his own armorial bearings,
thought with deep joy of the day when he would see put into place
the two great statues that Michael Angelo had already finished,
those of Lorenzo and Giuliano.</p>

<p>Dismissing this excitement from his mind, the Pope proceeded to
an apartment that he intended to see completed. It was the
bath-chamber of Cardinal Bibbiena, that witty, learned, charming
man who had been dead four years and whose bathroom, which was to
have been the most delicious of all the gorgeous chambers in the
Vatican, had never been completed. Bernardo Dovizi, Cardinal
Bibbiena, had begged of Raffaello to decorate for him a chamber on
the model of those that had been found in the Imperial Palace of
the Palatine, and the painter had taken great interest in the
bathroom, providing the designs, and even touching them with his
own hand.</p>

<p>Clement went to this apartment alone save for the secretary, on
whose shoulders he negligently leaned. He liked to look down on his
own hands, which lay on the young man's violet robe and on which
dully shone a large ring of sardonyx, designed by Cellini.</p>

<p>The bathroom of the Cardinal was adorned with Raffaello's most
exquisite art in paintings that represented the story of Venus and
Cupid. The bath itself was of translucent marble, and by the Pope's
orders large alabaster jars of roses had been placed beneath the
fair, fresh paintings; these flowers, trembling in the sunlight
that fell straight from the small windows, moved and fluttered like
butterflies at rest and seemed to pass in and out of the painted
flowers of the decoration; the figures of the beautiful women and
the lovely children seemed by this means to have a kind of
transient light also.</p>

<p>The Cardinal, who knew no fleshly lusts and was stirred by no
gross desires, was moved into a cold delight when he saw this
beauty, pure of line and pale of colour, that took his soul away
from the crudities, grossnesses, and troubles of everyday into
those Pagan times that he would like to have dwelt in.</p>

<p>Agostino Chigi, the most magnificent man in Rome, had been so
envious, when he saw this bath-chamber, that he had asked Raffaello
to design the story of Cupid, Psyche, and Venus for the frieze of
the hall in his villa on the Tiber; but the great Sienese banker
had not such a treasure in his possession as this bathroom of the
Cardinal. How lamentable it was that the master had died so
young!</p>

<p>"If I had been Pope then," thought Clement, "I should not have
worked him so hard. He should not have undertaken to do all those
villas, fountains, and designs for other men. He should have worked
for me, and me alone&mdash;he would have been alive now and he and
I should have sat for hours together planning other chambers in the
Vatican as beautiful as this."</p>

<p>The charm and harmony of the delicate figures on the walls
passed into the Pope's own being; he forgot the Emperor and the
King of France and the news that he was waiting for of the siege of
Marseilles. He forgot the constant necessity of scheming, of
plotting, of lying and setting one man against the other; he forgot
all his envious dislikes of those who crossed or questioned him;
and he stood there smiling, his long hand with the clean jewel
moving very faintly up and down to the rhythm of a man's deep
sighing.</p>

<p>How beautiful it was, how much beauty there was in the world! He
was surprised that men concerned themselves with anything
else&mdash;this bathroom, those paintings, Venus tying her sandal,
Cupid driving a snail, a butterfly, the water, the light through
the fine white pillars, the varieties of roses, their petals
scattered on the clear, tessellated pavements! Clement mused on
other works that he would undertake&mdash;yes, he would build more
bridges, he would drain marshes, he would excavate and restore some
of the ancient fanes and temples, he would set gilded angels above
the churches and gold and silver altars within them; the world
should remember that Giulio de' Medici had been Pontiff in Rome. He
thought of the city with a pride that was stronger than affection;
a Florentine himself, he had become Roman of the Romans in his
arrogant delight in the Papal City.</p>

<p>Bramante was dead, and Michael Angelo was sullen; Raffaello was
dead and Giulio Roman was not as fine an artist; Cellini lived, and
was a genius, but only worked at small things; ah, well, with what
he had, he, Clement VII, would create much splendour.</p>

<p>He continued to look at the fine and airy figures that moved in
their graceful chaste dignity round the wall of the Cardinal's
bathroom, and his long, black eyes behind the heavy fringed lashes
grew hard with nostalgia. It was curious not to belong to this
modern world, but always to walk in spirit the slopes of Parnassus
or of Mount Ida.</p>

<p>He sighed and walked negligently out of the bathroom, ordering
the door to be kept locked&mdash;locked, and special attention
given to the paintings, which were not to be touched by the hand of
pupil or copyist.</p>

<p>There were dispatches waiting for him when he reached his
closet. The Connétable, who had not been supported by either
the Emperor or the King of England, had raised the siege of
Marseilles and retreated into Italy.</p>

<p>The Pope looked out beyond his purple silk curtain at the
brilliant sunshine over Rome; the delicate figure of Venus tying
her sandal was present in his mind, blotting out the disagreeable
news from France.</p>

<p>"How weak he is!" he thought contemptuously of Charles. "What a
failure! Not even a good general Why could he not take
Marseilles?"</p>

<p>Clement went to the window. The summer air was lustrous; it
seemed to have a sheen like silk; it was perfumed with scents of
ripe fruit, of flowers opening their hearts to the sun.</p>

<p>Through such rich, sweet air had moved the Venus of Raffaello's
imagining, with her amber-coloured tresses in knots above her pale
brow, treading the blue violets and the pink cyclamen amid the
groves of the Palatine, when the yellow stone palaces and temples
had been unbroken and the sacred groves unprofaned.</p>

<p>The Pope sighed.</p>

<p class="first">
MEN and money&mdash;men and money. These three words were
imprinted on the Connétable's mind, they never left his
consciousness day or night, they marched through his dreams. Since
he had begun to lead a life of such energetic action, all his
former days, even his early campaign&mdash;vigorous enough in
themselves had seemed to be very far away.</p>

<p>He would pause suddenly in some of his toils&mdash;perhaps
riding a great warrior horse or a strong mule, or sitting at his
bureau, or reviewing his men&mdash;to see, as in a glimpse taken
slantwise through a narrow window, those old days: the Duchess
Anne, the Duchess Suzanne, the dead children, the fields of the
Bourbonnais covered with daisies; then again it would go and he
could hardly believe that it had ever been.</p>

<p>Locking down into the palm of his gloved hand it would be
sometimes as if he looked into a window and saw those two dead
women and himself, quiet, elegant figures in the library at
Moulins, turning over the great books enamelled with flowers and
armorial bearings; sometimes he would see it through a page of a
dispatch or flashed for a second on a sunset cloud&mdash;the old
days! He was fighting with every nerve to regain his ancient
possessions, his beautiful estates, his magnificent castles, his
furniture, his jewels. He had heard with a most bitter indignation
how Madame Louise with a cavalcade of wanton women had ridden down
to Moulins and amused themselves by taking out of the presses the
garments of his dead wife and mother-in-law, and attiring
themselves in the ermine and vair, and trying on the coronets and
pearls which the Duchess Suzanne had worn; and even, so he had been
told, amusing themselves by rocking with their elegant feet the
little cradle in which his son had slept for those few brief months
during which he had sojourned on earth.</p>

<p>Yes, he was working for the return of his possessions, but he
knew in his heart that even if by some stroke of fortune he wrested
everything back again from the King of France, he would never bring
back those old days of peace with the two women whom he had loved
and who had loved him.</p>

<p>He was astonished sometimes at his own coldness. Why was it
impossible for him to love any other woman beside Suzanne, with the
white linen round her head and the raised shoulder, the narrow
chest, and the thin, pinched face that was yet lovely as a pearl?
Pearls and daisies! They always mingled in his mind with thoughts
of his dead wife.</p>

<p>But these visions were fragmentary, seen now and then, and then
lost, as a petal thrust on a stormy ocean may be glimpsed for a
second, then disappear beneath the foam until a turn of the
wavelets casts it up further along the tempest-strewn coast.</p>

<p>But these three words&mdash;men and money, men and
money&mdash;were with him always.</p>

<p>François was besieging Pavia. All the fortune of the war
was gathered there, as once it had been gathered round Milan.
Things went ill for the Emperor, as if Bourbon had brought
misfortune instead of help to the Imperial cause: François
had made a secret alliance with the Pope, Venice, and Florence; and
the young Emperor, resolute, hard-living, chaste, impatient,
expressed himself with sharp wrath when he heard of the treachery
of the Medici, whom he had raised to the Papal throne.</p>

<p>To Charles V, well trained by his wise and virtuous, pious and
honourable aunt, Marguerite of Savoy, such behaviour as that of the
bastard Medici, who wore the Tiara, was incomprehensible. The
Connétable, cool and implacable as the master whom he had
never seen, resolved to raise the siege of Pavia, that great city
by the rapid waters of the Ticino that had defied the hordes of
Theodoric and Charlemagne.</p>

<p>The splendid, famous city occupied the imagination of Charles de
Montpensier as if she had been a woman, a queen, and he her lover;
he thought often of her, with her towers, her bastions, her moats,
her walls, her citadels and palaces, her fortified gates and
draw-bridges&mdash;and he vowed in his reserved soul that she
should not fall into the hands of France, whose gay army lay
encamped beyond the city walls, in those luxurious domains that
travellers had termed an earthly paradise: the grounds of the
splendid Abbey of San Lanfranco, the park of Bergaretto, and the
beautiful grounds of Mirabello with its charming
pleasure-houses&mdash;which were, however, strongly
fortified&mdash;which the Dukes of Milan had once used as a
hunting-box.</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon, working to gather men and money in Germany
and Switzerland, had spent many hours studying on paper the
position of the King of France as it had been brought to him by
spies. François lay to the west of the city between the
rapid river and the stout walls; with him was his favourite, the
luxurious and flattering Guillaume de Gouffier, Admiral de
Bonnivet, the Bastard of Savoy, and the major portion of his
forces.</p>

<p>In the suburb of San Antonio was the Maréchal de
Montmorency, who had with him three thousand Switzers, two thousand
Italians, a thousand Corsicans, and two thousand men-at-arms.</p>

<p>The gorgeous park at Mirabello was occupied by the King's
brother-in-law, the Duke d'Alençon; the forces of the King
thus completely invested the city; her proud churches, her splendid
University, her rich palaces rose from behind her walls clasped by
the conqueror yet still inviolate.</p>

<p>To save Pavia meant more to Charles de Bourbon than the mere
rescue of an Italian town from the French forces. He believed that
if he could defeat the King at this point it would mean the turn of
all his own fortune and be a long step towards the recovery of his
estates. He believed also, and this to his reserved proud and shy
soul was more important, that he would thus prove to the Emperor
that though he had come to him a beggar, a landless man, a
mercenary, he was not without his worth as a soldier and a
general.</p>

<p>The Connétable's great faith was in Antonio de Leyva, the
Spanish Governor of Pavia, who had sent him by one of his secret
messengers a dispatch declaring that he would never surrender. This
general was a man of great sagacity, courage, and resolution; he
had neglected no details that might help him in his task; to his
garrison of five thousand German mercenaries, five hundred Spanish
soldiers, three hundred men-at-arms, and two hundred light cavalry,
he had added all the male inhabitants, organized into a strong
Militia.</p>

<p>He had ably and energetically fortified the city, and&mdash;that
which gave Charles de Bourbon most satisfaction&mdash;he had driven
off the French attack when François had endeavoured to take
the place by assault, opening trenches, bringing up his big cannon,
and throwing all his forces on to the broken walls as his balls
demolished them.</p>

<p>Despite, however, the French cannon, the ramparts were manned by
the German mercenaries with pikes ten feet long, and so vigorous
was their defence that the French retired with devastating
loss.</p>

<p>Upon this failure the French King had thought of a daring plan;
it was to turn the Ticino from its bed, block up the water with
stones and earth, and enter Pavia by the south walls, which were
not fortified, as de Leyva had trusted at this point to the defence
of the river. This plan also came to nothing, for a great storm of
rain arose as the French engineers finished their labours; the
river rose in flood and carried away their earthwork and returned
once more to flow rapidly round the unconquered walls of Pavia.</p>

<p>It was after this setback that François had sat down to
reduce the garrison of Pavia by famine, and increased his
blockading forces by five thousand foot-soldiers from the
Grisons.</p>

<p>The Connétable knew that the French army was probably the
finest in Europe. The King had with him many notable captains;
among them was a poor Prince of the House of Medici, Giovanni delle
Bande Nere, a mercenary soldier of a high reputation. He served
anywhere that he thought his interests lay; and he had made a good
bargain with the King of France, who was paying him ten thousand
crowns a month and lavish pay for his Black Bands for his services
outside Pavia.</p>

<p>But the haughty prince had sent back the Collar of St. Michael
which the King of France had sent him, and torn up the agreement
that had made provision for himself and his soldiers and his wife
because he did not wish to bind himself for more than a short term
to serve any man; he was following in secret the wishes of the
Pope, who had told him to fight for the King of France.</p>

<p>In the Vatican was his skilful wife, Maria Salviati, with her
little son Cosimo; the Pope petted them and filled the ambitious
young woman with promises, while he gave the boy horses splendidly
equipped with purple silks, and presents of money. But what the
wife of Giovanni de Medici most needed&mdash;an estate for her
husband, herself, and her son&mdash;the Pope withheld.</p>

<p>This brutal young captain was with the King of France in the
palace of Mirabello, defending the Ticino on the west of the camp
and helping to drive back the sallies of the garrison. He had also,
for he was unscrupulous and callous, amused himself by burning all
the surrounding villages and slaying anything that might live on
the long marshes which undulated across the plains of Lombardy.</p>

<p>The Connétable was enduring every manner of personal
hardship while he heard of the extravagant gaiety which was taking
place in the royal camp outside Pavia; from the plains of Piedmont
and Lombardy supplies were continually arriving so that there was
no scarcity among the soldiers who followed the <i>oriflamme</i> of
France. The great park of the Dukes of Milan was like a fair and a
pleasure-ground in one; the Abbey was fitted up as apartments for
the princes and captains. The King of France lived with as much
splendour as if he had been in Fontainebleau, with his gold and his
silver vessels, his pages and his white horses trapped in white and
scarlet, with his masques, gambling, and plays of every kind; every
night there was some manner of entertainment or pageant, and de
Bourbon smiled to himself when he heard how Madame Clarice Visconti
had allowed herself to be carried down in a litter of
saffron-coloured silk and golden carving to be shown to the King of
France, to whom Bonnivet had boasted of her beauty.</p>

<p>Charles knew of the other scene that was taking place within the
splendid, besieged city; everyone there was starving, every horse,
mule and ass had been eaten. The winter was bitterly cold, but
there was no fuel for firing after every unoccupied house and even
some of the churches had been pulled down for the sake of the beams,
the planks, and the panelling.</p>

<p>The Switzers were on the verge of mutinying because their pay
was overdue; Antonio de Leyva, who had borrowed to the last
farthing from the wealthy inhabitants of the city, had sacrificed
his own one possession&mdash;the heavy gold chain he wore across
his breast.</p>

<p>Charles heard that even the sacred treasures in the churches had
been taken and melted down, that the famous silver maces of the
University had been sacrificed; still it was not enough, nay, not
even though on one occasion three thousand ducats had been smuggled
through the French forces, and on another occasion forty horsemen,
each with a bag of gunpowder, had managed to skirt the feasting and
the lights in the park of Mirabello to cross the wintry woods and
slip into the beleaguered town.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The keen cold held into February; the low clouds were
lead-coloured over the frozen marshy plains of Lombardy. Charles de
Bourbon heard now this news, that Giovanni de Medici had been
wounded in a <i>sortie,</i> shot by one of the modern firearms that
he so despised, and been carried down the Po from Pavia to
Piacenza.</p>

<p>But the loss of this captain made little difference to the
garrison of Pavia, now, as the Connétable knew, reduced to
the last extremity; but a little incident gained them a short
respite.</p>

<p>The Swiss from the Grisons who were in the service of the King
of France heard that their great fortress at Phiavenna on the lake
at Como had been taken by some of the Emperor's men. Summoned home
by this disaster, the Swiss turned at once, although
François had just paid them; no threat or appeal was of any
avail; they marched away from the gorgeous camp at Mirabello
towards their own threatened country.</p>

<p>De Leyva, having heard of this, made a sortie with his gaunt and
desperate horsemen and harried the Swiss as they left the French
camp, and even succeeded in carrying off some of their baggage,
which contained food and powder. This relief was sufficient to
enable him to hold out for another few days; he continued to pace
the battlements and to pray for the sight of the banners of Charles
de Bourbon.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Men and money, men and money. Charles had at length obtained
both. The hard-pressed young Emperor had sent him some supplies and
he had engaged the services of the famous Switzers under Georg
Frundsberg, Prince of Mindelheim, and those of the Archduke
Ferdinand, and with these men in the still, black cold of winter he
crossed the Alps and reached the camp at Lodi before the last day
of the year.</p>

<p>He had no hope in any man save himself and those whom he might
command. Again the King of England had failed to keep his promise
to invade the North of France. The Emperor, in whom Charles still
believed and trusted, could do no more than he had done.</p>

<p>The Connétable took an austere and poignant pleasure in
his own self-reliance, in the difficulty and peril of the things he
did; he had his moments of exaltation as he rode through those
narrow, rocky defiles where the snow lay thick, and saw the lines
of the sturdy men-at-arms, their faces blackened by dirt and frost,
their armour tarnished, their banners hanging limply in the thin
mountain air. Always before his mind was Pavia circled by the
luxurious, laughing armies of King François; in his brain
beat the words "Men and money. If I can only keep them together, if
I can only pay them, if I can only get there in time!"</p>

<p>He had not reached Lodi before his soldiers were clamouring for
pay that was already in arrears. Twelve thousand Germans! A force
almost equal to that which the King of France commanded! But if he
could not obtain the money to pay them...</p>

<p>He pushed on at once. A battle would be as good as pay, and if
there was a victory, the question of money would be decided. The
last message that had come from the commander of the garrison of
Pavia was shown by Bourbon to his fellow commander, Ferdinando
d'Alvalos, Marchese de Pescara.</p>

<p>"We are not ordinary men, nor in an ordinary situation," said
Charles de Bourbon, "and we must do an extraordinary thing."</p>

<p>So he broke up his camp at Lodi before the end of the month,
though the weather was ice-bound, the clouds low, grey, and looking
as cold, as heavy as iron, while the shrill wind whistled over the
icy marshes and the deep gloom of nature seemed reflected in all
this grim panoply of war.</p>

<p>The three generals, the Marchese de Pescara, Charles de Lannoy
(Viceroy of Naples), and Charles de Bourbon, reviewed their troops.
They had twenty thousand foot-soldiers, seven hundred men-at-arms,
and a few pieces of artillery. The Germans were under command of
Frundsberg, a princely giant, who was like one of his native
mountains, rugged, serene, majestic; whose men loved him and who
loved them; a fanatic Protestant, though a mercenary soldier who
would fight for anyone who paid him. Along train of baggage waggons
followed this stern, tired host as they moved across the bitter
marshes. On their way they took the town and fortress of Sant'
Angelo, then moved northward to Belgiojoso, and encamped on the
east of the city; short of food, of money, but determined and
inflexible.</p>

<p>François I did not lose his gay confidence; he did not
think that Charles de Bourbon and his Swiss mercenaries could
relieve Pavia. He wrote to his mother that the relieving army, by
merely marching round, could not make Pavia hold out, "as I know
that the besieged have not tasted wine, meat, or cheese for a month
and have exhausted all their powder".</p>

<p>For three weeks the two armies remained in camp close to each
other, wrapped in the harsh veils of winter sleet and snow, and
clouds that seemed to come so low that they touched the tent-poles
and the wet, sagging banners.</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon could not long avoid battle, for the German
mercenaries were brusquely demanding their pay; but it was to the
Imperialists' interests to fight and to the interests of
François not to fight, and the astute envoy of Clement VII
advised him to hold his hand. But the gay, subtle, and flattering
Bonnivet urged the King to go into battle and gain personal glory
and renown, as Louis XII did at Agnadello, as Charles VIII did at
Taro...</p>

<p>"And as you yourself, sacred Majesty, did at Marignano".</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>On February 4, 1525, which was the birthday of the Emperor, a
messenger from the Connétable contrived to get into Pavia in
the name of the Imperial Commanders; he asked de Leyva to second
the attack of the relieving force when he should hear two cannon
shots; he was asked to place five thousand men-at-arms ready for a
sortie; they were to put on white shirts or white cloths outside
their armour, that they might recognize each other in the murk of
the winter night.</p>

<p>That same night the Connétable, wearing a suit of silver,
which shone more brightly than any white of cloth, over his own
armour, rode along the ranks of the German mercenaries and Switzers
and told them that he had no longer food nor wine to give them, but
urged them for the honour of the Empire to fight well, and told
them that when they had won they would find everything in abundance
in the French camp; he reminded them that five thousand Germans
were shut up and starving in Pavia.</p>

<p>As he rode up and down, speaking these words, matters that had
nothing to do with what he said went through his mind; the
possibility that he might die tomorrow, the wonder if death meant
reunion with Suzanne, the sense of the blasting cold chilling his
blood, the sense of the wind, carried in the darkness, whistling in
his ears, a certain amazement that he should be here now doing
this.</p>

<p>He could not see Pavia that he had come so far to save, nor the
brilliant forces that beleaguered her, nor any star, for the
midnight clouds were dense; the torches and lanterns showed him the
ranks of the men whom he had brought through the winter to save
Pavia, their bearded faces, slashed and padded coats, polished
armour and heavy weapons. This yellow, flickering light showed him
also pockets of snow in the ruts of the trampled ground, flakes of
snow on the great gloves he wore, on his horse's ears and on his
saddle-bow.</p>

<p>A flare of tawny light through the bare trees showed where
François was encamped in Mirabello. When Charles paused to
listen he could hear the strains of music coming from the houses
where the French officers lay, and the sound of the Imperialist
engineers demolishing the massive walls of the park.</p>

<p>The snow increased; by the reluctant, grey dawn the air was full
of fine flakes that turned to water as they fell.</p>

<p>Charles learned that the breach in the walls was now large
enough for a column of men to pass through, and he ordered the
vanguard of three thousand men under Charles de Lannoy to advance
across the park towards the hunting-box and pavilions where the
French lodged.</p>

<p>These troops found these buildings deserted; empty and desolate
they stood in the colourless grey light. Beyond them, behind sturdy
fortifications, were the French and their allies in battle array,
Swiss, English, and the Black Bands under the Duke of Lorraine and
the Duke of Suffolk.</p>

<p>The French artillery threw back the vanguard and prevented their
making a junction with the sally expected from Pavia; but as the
Imperialists hesitated, de Lannoy, making the sign of the Cross on
his heart, stood up in his stirrups and shouted out "There is no
hope but in God! Follow me and do as I do!"</p>

<p>At this moment he was reinforced by the Marchese de Pescara with
some of the German mercenaries, and the wavering line of
Imperialists straightened and moved forward against the French
fire. The snow ceased, blown northward by a low wind that cast icy
drippings off the boughs of the bare poplar trees in the park and
fluttered the plumes and scarves of the soldiers; the Imperial
banner on the citadel of Pavia was lifted skyward and the lowering
clouds split across a pale golden sky.</p>

<p>Into the <i>mêlée</i> beneath the walls of Pavia moved
the King of France with all his chivalry, knights, men-at-arms, and
companies of foot. With dashing impetuosity and little cries of
excitement he set his lance in rest and drove at the enemy, his
feathers and wreath, his mantle and sash, streaming in the murky
air behind him; his thrust, skilfully directed, brought down the
leader of the light cavalry opposed to him, and as he saw through
his visor the plunging horses and reeling men, he cried out:</p>

<p>"Now indeed, I am Duke of Milan!"</p>

<p>Like a bolt of wild fire flying and flaring across a plain
brittle from drought, the chivalry of France flashed across the
ranks of the Imperialists in the park of Mirabello, while the rift
in the torn clouds widened and a wan sunlight slanted down on the
struggling hosts.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>A messenger brought the news to Charles de Bourbon when he
advanced with Georg Frundsberg and Swiss mercenaries:</p>

<p>"De Lannoy and Pescara fall back&mdash;the King of France drives
all before him!"</p>

<p>Defeat! Charles thought what defeat would men to him, a shameful
death if captured, or, if he fled across the ice-bound marshes to
safety, the cold young Emperor to face, who would receive him with
pity, possibly contempt. He looked up at the thick, grey clouds
that were falling apart either side of the yellow space of sky and,
riding beside Frundsberg, led the best-trained soldiers in Europe
towards the park of Mirabello.</p>

<p>The news of the French success had revived all his hatred of
François. He cried out to Frundsberg:</p>

<p>"I have heard much of your men; let me see how they fight!"</p>

<p>With the steady drive of a great engine of war, the famous Swiss
followed Frundsberg and the Connétable through the breach in
the walls of Mirabello and flung themselves straight at
François and his nearly victorious ranks, now increased by
the advance of the Black Bands under Lorraine and Suffolk.</p>

<p>As the Spanish arquebusiers brought down the French lancers, the
cold air became tainted with the smell of powder and flecked by the
flash of fire; Charles looked through the press for François
and saw him in his <i>surtout</i> with the <i>fleurs de lis</i>. He
had thrown away his lance and swung a great sword, while he shouted
to the gentlemen about him who tried to manage their snorting,
rearing horses with blood-filled nostrils.</p>

<p>The Connétable pressed on. Fighting every step of the
way, the Black Bands fell back before the onslaught of Frundsberg's
Swiss; the clouds, as if they too were in conflict, closed over the
yellow rift, extinguishing the pallid moon; the snow began to fall
again, outlining the branches of the bare trees, whirling in front
of the bleeding, furious faces of the fighting men, sinking into
the trampled, bloody ground.</p>

<p>Charles peered through his vizor at a little strip of brilliant
colour and violent movement; he was looking for the King. Through
the neighing of the horses, struggling in their armour, and the
shouts in many tongues, Charles heard distant trumpets.</p>

<p>"De Leyva!" he cried to Frundsberg, who, unmoved amid the
tumult, continued to urge on his men. The Spanish Captain, with the
entire garrison of Pavia, had flung himself out of the blockaded
town, full on the flanks of the French, whose forces were already
broken by the Imperialists.</p>

<p>"The King!" cried Charles, when he saw this turn. "Find the
King!"</p>

<p>He plunged his rearing horse forward into the scattered hosts of
France that now, doubly beset, retreated as best they could, some
taking to flight across the scattered dead and wounded, under the
wind-smitten trees, towards the icy river.</p>

<p>François shouted to his God and to his soldiers when he
heard the Spanish trumpets sounding from Pavia, when he saw the
Swiss closing round him; but the ranks of French chivalry that
pressed round him thinned; one great shining figure after another
fell from the startled and bleeding horses and was trampled into
the ground, encased in useless, stifling armour.</p>

<p>The King himself was wounded in hand and face, so that he saw
everything through blood and snow, and his own blood ran down his
sword. His great warrior-steed was shot beneath him and dropped,
pitching the King off the high, steel-protected saddle. The
Spaniards and Germans clustered round him, shouting out to him to
surrender. François, whose helmet had fallen off, shook his
head, smiling, and some of the Switzers, angry at his obstinacy,
pressed on him threateningly; the Spaniards seized him and tore his
surcoat of silver, embroidered with <i>fleurs de lis</i>, from his
armour and, rending it into shreds, divided it among themselves in
memory of the fight in the park of Mirabello.</p>

<p>Seeing this confusion and guessing its cause, the Viceroy de
Lannoy rode up, forcing his way through the shouting press and,
flinging himself from his horse, dragged the King from the ground,
where he lay, harried by the Switzers and holding his arm above his
face to protect it from the Spaniards, who shouted to him:</p>

<p>"Yield! Yield!"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" gasped François, struggling with his
captor.</p>

<p>"Charles de Lannoy, Viceroy of Naples. Sire, I receive you as
the Emperor's prisoner..."</p>

<p>François smiled round at the enemies who closed in on
him, then, exhausted and half fainting, fell on to the shoulder of
de Lannoy, who snatched his sword from his feeble hand. The shouts
of the Switzers, "Victory! Victory!" rose hoarsely above the cries
and groans of the battle. A scurry of snow fell, and the hurrying
clouds flew low as if they were pressing on the shuddering tops of
the bare trees.</p>

<p>"Do not take me into Pavia," said François, leaning
heavily on de Lannoy; his natural gaiety was overcast by his
extreme humiliation, his face twitched under the blood and dirt
that encrusted it. "Do not show me to those people whom I tried to
starve."</p>

<p>"Sire" replied de Lannoy, "I shall take you to the monastery of
Saint Pol, which is the best shelter our camp can afford."</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon, with an escort of Frundsberg's Switzers,
came riding up, searching here and there in the confusion for the
King of France. He halted when he saw de Lannoy on foot, holding up
the tall man on whose dinted armour hung the tattered <i>fleur de
lis</i> in shreds of silver.</p>

<p>The two met under a massive poplar that shook the snow from
erect branches. Charles the Connétable sprang from his
horse, threw the reins to one of the Switzers, and stammered: "The
Majesty of France!"</p>

<p>"Fallen low today, cousin," smiled François, clapping his
hand to his swordless side.</p>

<p>"Sire, it is the chance of battle," said Charles. "You are now
the Emperor's guest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His captive!" François moved away from de Lannoy, and
his long eyes glittered as he raised his high, wide shoulders in
the broken armour. A drummer, sprawled in the slush, lay dying
under the poplar tree; the furious sounds of the battle were fused
in one clamour above the trampled park; two riderless horses
galloped past, splashing the King, de Lannoy, and the
Connétable with cold mud and shreds of ice cast up from the
fouled ground.</p>

<p>"I am the Emperor's man," said Charles de Bourbon, not with
triumph, but with ironic acceptance of his destiny.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"We have caged the fox, not tamed him," said de Lannoy. "It is a
mighty stroke of good fortune; it remains for the Emperor to turn
it to account." He glanced at the melancholy reserve of the
Connétable. "You, at least, monseigneur, will be able to
dictate terms to François de Valois&mdash;all your
possessions and honours will be restored to you."</p>

<p>"I think of what he cannot restore to me," said Charles; he did
not voice his great longing for peace, for repose, but his elegant
hands, tired from the battle, newly washed and rubbed with
aromatics, closed together in an attitude of prayer. "I am glad
that I have now proved of some worth to the Emperor, that I brought
up the Switzers in time to save Pavia."</p>

<p>"You will have the Emperor's sister," said de Lannoy, "and the
Pope's blessing."</p>

<p>Charles thought how little he cared for either the strange woman
or the benediction of the Medici; he was angry with himself because
he could not value more all that it was possible for him to
gain.</p>

<p>"I shall be too well rewarded," he smiled. He put a napkin over
his arm and took up a flagon of silver-gilt that had come from
Pescara's baggage. "I must serve this King as cup-bearer."</p>

<p>"You will find him good company, he has recovered his spirits
and flatters everyone."</p>

<p>"How shallow he is! How frivolous!"</p>

<p>"Yet he has courage, too; he must know that he is ruined."</p>

<p>"Is he ruined?" asked Charles shrewdly. "He has those two subtle
women in France who work for him&mdash;and the Pope, this Medici,
will he be pleased if the Emperor grows too great?"</p>

<p>"Whatever comes," smiled de Lannoy, "we have gained the victory
at Pavia."</p>

<p>Across the narrow windows of the Abbey the snow fell in large
flakes, driven slantwise by the intermittent northern wind, as
Charles went down into the monks' refectory, where the captive King
supped before a great wood fire, and the light of church candles
wavered on the rough walls.</p>

<p>His Hatred of François was not lessened by his victory;
the laughing, easy, false Prince seemed to Charles as dangerous now
as he had ever been&mdash;"Yet he is ruined and must ransom himself
with whatever the Emperor asks."</p>

<p>The victor of Pavia mused in the cross-lights and shadows of the
monks' hall where the vanquished King sat amid his enemies at the
long trestle table.</p>

<p>François was laughing loudly, as if at a jest, and as
Charles looked at him he felt as if he were the defeated captain
and the gay young Valois triumphant. Charles looked at the cold
darkness beyond the window and wished himself away from this
victory.</p>

CHARLES DE BOURBON looked at the great lady with a poignant
curiosity and an interest that surprised himself. She had been
familiar to him since they had been children together, and often he
had entertained her at Moulins; but now she and circumstances were
changed. He, too, was another man, he thought, from the Prince who
had played the host to Marguerite d'Alençon, the King's
sister, the daughter of the woman who ruined the House of
Bourbon.</p>

<p>Louise of Savoy, as Regent of France, had sent her daughter to
Spain as Ambassadress to negotiate for the release of her son;
Charles could understand the motive behind this move. The Emperor,
twenty-five years of age, was to be flattered, seduced by the charm
and beauty of the famous Marguerite, lately widowed herself, and
one of the loveliest and most audacious ladies in Christendom.
Perhaps, too, Louise had calculated on her effect on another of the
victors of Pavia, the Connétable himself. She was lodged
with all honour in the Alcazar, the palace where her brother was
ill with chagrin, the long journey from Italy to Spain, and the
confinement to which he was so little used. The Emperor had treated
his prisoner with every courtesy; but François made nothing
of any civilities or pleasantries, and longed only for his freedom;
and it was to obtain this on the best possible terms that his
sister, Marguerite of Marguerites, pearl of pearls, had come to
Spain. Hardly resting, she had been borne across the level
highlands of Castile in her litter, taking less than a fortnight
for the tedious journey.</p>

<p>She had been met at the great gates of Madrid by the young
Emperor in his plain black frieze coat and flat looped hat. There
was never any ostentation about the fine breeding of Charles V, and
he treated the sister of his captive as if she had been a reigning
and a powerful queen.</p>

<p>She had hurried to the bedside of her brother, whose spirits
were much revived by the appearance of this beautiful and beloved
sister, and by the words which she quickly whispered to him as she
knelt on his bedstep and pressed his hand to her cheek, as also by
the letter which she gave him from Louise, his mother.</p>

<p>Now the bright lady, who was engaged to proceed to Toledo to
meet the Emperor again and discuss the terms for her brother's
release, had asked for an interview with Charles de Bourbon.</p>

<p>She greeted him with honey on her tongue and sweetness in her
eyes, yet the young man, standing beside the window with its
Moorish pillars and curtains of saffron silk, looked at her not
only with suspicion but almost with aversion. His hatred of
François, his loathing of Louise, tinged his feelings
towards this creature who was a little too radiant, too fine, too
elegant. She was, like her brother, extremely accomplished.
François had spent some of his leisure while he had been in
captivity in writing a rhymed account of the Battle of Pavia, and
Marguerite wrote poems and composed music and romances, and had all
the accomplishments possible to a high-born lady.</p>

<p>She had also, Charles suspected, many lovers, as had her mother
Louise. Ay, that was it, she was the daughter of the Serpent and
the sister of the Serpent. He had thought once, in the old days
before he had grown to love his wife so deeply, that he might
become enamoured of Marguerite de Valois, setting her in his
thoughts like a bright star never to be attained but always to be
worshipped; but now he thought that she was not so desirable.
Still, she fascinated him, and he looked at her keenly out of his
long eyes; he could see the change in her manner towards himself.
once she had treated him with a casual graciousness, now she
recognized in the victor of Pavia the man whom her brother had
pursued to slay.</p>

<p>She sat in the high chair of gilded Spanish leather, with her
long white hands on the knees of her black gown. Because of her
recent widowhood, though she had never loved her husband, and
because of the troubles of her brother, she was dressed in deep
mourning&mdash;plain black velvet without jewel or ornament, with a
long white veil falling over her shoulders and slightly obscuring
the stiff crimping of her tawny hair. Her face was fine as a
carving in pearl, with a slight vermilion in the lips and cheeks
and gold in the bright, slanting eyes, which had the look of her
mother's; and her smile was too much her brother's smile.</p>

<p>She praised the young Duke to his face, extolling his exploits
at the battle of Pavia, inducing him to talk of that event when in
two hours her brother's magnificent army in the park of Mirabello
had been utterly routed and almost annihilated.</p>

<p>She seemed to dwell with delicate zest on such details as the
ten thousand men who had been left to rot on the pleasure-park that
had become the battlefield, or had been drowned in the Ticino while
endeavouring to fly from the commander of the garrison, who had
come out and destroyed the bridge across which some of the
fugitives endeavoured to escape. She mentioned the names of the
noble captains who had been taken prisoner, the King of Navarre,
the Duc de Nemours, d'Aubigny, Montmorency, the Vidame of Chartres,
the Seigneur de Fleurange, who were held safely in prison. She did
not mention her own husband, who had been neither slain nor
captured on the battlefield, but had fled in a way shameful to a
man of breeding, and who had died shortly afterwards&mdash;of
chagrin and humiliation, it was believed.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, the Duc de Bourbon had the honours of that great
victory, and Marguerite de Valois did not hesitate to give them to
him. She named with reverence those who had fallen fighting round
their King. With tact and elegance she talked about the noble dead,
and her fine hands moved slightly on her black-clad knees, and her
liquid eyes were turned towards the young Duke; in her low,
pleasing voice she praised everyone, victor and defeated. She said
that it was good to live in a world that held so much nobility and
chivalry, and her sweet breath seemed to waft away all causes of
discord between her brother and the Connétable de
Bourbon.</p>

<p>"Do you not know that my brother, on the papers that the Emperor
has given him with his terms, had written 'Easy, easy' against all
the demands that relate to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Madame, my terms have been put before the Emperor, my master.
He knows what is owing to me and he has been pleased to say that he
will make my restoration to my dominions one of the conditions on
which he releases the King of France."</p>

<p>He saw her eyes glitter with spite behind the golden lashes. He
thought, "She must hate me, they all hate me, all the
Valois"&mdash;and he wondered how he could ever live in France
again with these people, mother, daughter, brother, in power.</p>

<p>He wished that the King of England could have invaded France as
he had promised and followed up the great success of Pavia. But
though he was not exultant and triumphant over the victory which
had set him so high, yet the hope revived in his heart to tumble
the House of Valois down and overset their throne; nor was he
softened because of this fair woman who sat there, hating him and
flattering him.</p>

<p>"You know the Emperor's terms," sighed Marguerite softly; "they
are very hard."</p>

<p>"It may be so, madame, but the Emperor has everything in his
power. Think of it as a game of chess, that he has taken your King,
and let the Queen, who is unsupported, go carefully."</p>

<p>"He desires the Duchy of Burgundy; it is almost impossible.
Cannot you, to whom he owes so much, persuade him that he asks too
much?"</p>

<p>"Burgundy is his hereditary land, and dearer to him than all the
gold-mines of the New World. The Emperor demands all that was once
ceded by the Treaties of Conflans and Péronne. He wishes the
King of France to give up his claims in Italy, the Duchy of Milan,
and he wishes him to restore everything to me&mdash;all that he
claims through Anne de France. There is also another rebel whom the
Emperor wishes forgiven, and that is Philibert Châlon, the Prince
of Orange, who is to receive back his dominions."</p>

<p>"Those then, as I heard, are the Emperor's terms!" sighed the
Duchess. "I wished to hear them from your lips, for all say you are
deep in his confidence, before I meet him at Toledo."</p>

<p>Her narrow, finely cut lips closed tightly together, and the
Duke saw her hands leave her lap and cross the arms of her chair.
She was angry, she was cornered; but he felt no compassion for
her&mdash;only a further leaping up of his hatred.</p>

<p>"My brother will refuse to give up Burgundy and his Flemish
possessions. As for the restoration of your estates, it is as I
told you, easy. You should be my friend because I tell you
that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the King will find another of the Emperor's terms easy:
that which stipulates that when the King is free he is to join the
Emperor in crusades against heresy and the Turks. I must also say
that besides and even before I require the restoration of my goods,
my palaces, my lands&mdash;I require a pardon for all my friends
and adherents. I have put them by name in the terms which I
submitted to the Emperor. I wish, too, that I may be allowed to
remain at the service of the Emperor during his life."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is easy, I have told you!" exclaimed Marguerite. "How
many times am I to tell you that it is easy? I will undertake that
the King will return to you your position, pension, and offices
nay, more than that he will give you in marriage one of his
daughters with a regal dowry."</p>

<p>"They are children," smiled the Connétable, "and the
Emperor has promised me the hand of his sister, the Dowager Queen
of Portugal."</p>

<p>"Queen Claude died last year," said Marguerite abruptly, "and it
was the hand of Queen Isabelle that I wished to ask for of the
Emperor for my brother."</p>

<p>"Now why that, madame?" asked the Connétable, smiling.
"Why that? of all the terms you might have demanded, of all the
marriages you might have contrived for your brother, why that? The
lady is promised to me, and I hold it a greater honour to be the
brother-in-law of the Emperor than to be the husband of a Princess
of France."</p>

<p>Marguerite smiled and lowered her eyes. He knew that she was
thinking of her mother, Louise, who had offered herself to him
again and again, directly, indirectly, for years. Perhaps she was
thinking of herself, for he was aware that since her coming to
Spain rumour and gossip had been busy with their names. He wondered
if she, unscrupulous and adroit as she was, would make that
suggestion now. If he would not take the mother, perhaps the
daughter would please him, and so the great estates of Bourbon
might remain in the possession of the House of Valois.</p>

<p>He almost wished that she would delicately offer herself that he
might as delicately refuse.</p>

<p>She rose from her chair and fingered the white veil that fell
down either side of her face and crossed her bosom, which heaved in
agitation.</p>

<p>He was not sorry for her; she had every resource, and he
despised her House and felt an aversion from that passionate
affection which she felt towards her brother, and which would, he
believed, prevent her giving a true love to any other man.</p>

<p>"For what has happened in the past," she said, "I have my
regrets; I am sorry that our House has lost such a servitor as
yourself. I hope that your next victory, Monseigneur de Bourbon,
will be gained under the banners of France."</p>

<p>"It is not possible, since I am engaged in the service of the
Emperor."</p>

<p>She looked at him sideways at that, and said:</p>

<p>"Do you like him, so young, so brave? So brave, so industrious?
Why, there is neither gaiety nor mirth, nor art nor letters, nor
any joy, in his Court!"</p>

<p>"He is high-minded and finely bred. He has a terrible heritage
which is like a burden on his back. I have seen few faults in him,
he has committed no errors yet. He will keep his word, he will do
his utmost to satisfy all demands on him. I have pledged to him a
lifetime of fidelity."</p>

<p>"So," said Marguerite, "so." She raised her hand and let it fall
again. "Well, I must go to Toledo, there to confirm the terms of my
brother's release."</p>

<p>He watched her go across the room to the group of ladies who
waited for her inside the door. He stood like her attendant, with
bowed head and his hands on his hips, waiting for the departure of
this Princess. The thick September sunshine falling through the
windows turned her white veil and black dress and pallid face for a
moment to warm gold. She was a rare and fascinating creature, but
not for him. At the door she paused, then dismissing her ladies
turned resolutely back with a sudden laugh.</p>

<p>"Do not let us disguise ourselves one from the other, Charles.
We have known each other as children. I shall not be able to do
anything with your Emperor, who is cold and dry, life a monk, and
betrothed to a woman whom he likes&mdash;loves perhaps."</p>

<p>"You speak truly," smiled Charles. "Not even Marguerite of
Alençon will be able to move Charles V to abate his just
demands."</p>

<p>"Impossible demands," whispered Marguerite. "You know that. Tell
your master&mdash;any ransom that he likes to name&mdash;but not a
foot of territory! Everything restored to you&mdash;but no
relinquishment of Milan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Madame, I will not be your go-between. The Emperor invites you
to Toledo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I shall go to Toledo. But I speak to you, Charles, the
victor of Pavia&mdash;a Frenchman..."</p>

<p>She came close to him, richly coloured in the slumbrous yellow
light of the Spanish autumn sunshine, and he admired her resource,
her energy and courage.</p>

<p>"How great is your love for your brother, madame, since it
forces you to flatter me!"</p>

<p>Even that did not penetrate her composure; she put her finger to
her lip, smiled, and shook her head.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Charles. I was never your enemy. I did not
advise the bringing of this lawsuit."</p>

<p>"You are too much your brother's friend ever to be mine."</p>

<p>"I never did you any harm."</p>

<p>"Did you not go to Moulins and Chantelle, my houses, and turn
over my books, garments, and treasures?"</p>

<p>"Everything you had shall be restored to you. Do not hate me
because I went to your houses, where once I was happy."</p>

<p>"Tell me, madame," asked Charles abruptly, as if he had not
heard her words, "did you, at Moulins, see a book of
mine&mdash;<i>L'Enseignement</i>&mdash;which I gave my
wife&mdash;long ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is safe at Fontainebleau. It shall be returned to
you&mdash;with everything else."</p>

<p>Charles bit his lip without replying. How they had plundered
him, the two women! And now she was here, trying to coax him, to
flatter him, to trick him into an instrument to serve that gaudy
idol she adored&mdash;her false, shallow brother.</p>

<p>"You must hate me," he declared brusquely. "You ought to hate
me. I betrayed you all and would have divided your kingdom among
your enemies."</p>

<p>"I could forgive that&mdash;treachery."</p>

<p>"I could not forgive what provoked it," cried Charles. "I am the
Emperor's man. I shall not ask him to abate his terms."</p>

<p>Marguerite sighed and opened her clear, golden eyes full on the
implacable young man. "You and I as enemies," she sighed. "Ah,
well&mdash;I must do what I can by myself. Good-bye, Charles, enemy
of France!"</p>

<p>She turned towards the door, walking slowly in her black and
white garments through the thick sunshine.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In November the King of France was taken to Barcelona and
Charles V met the Connétable de Bourbon on the bridge of the
Alcantara, where there was a great ceremony such as Charles V knew
how to contrive when he wished to do honour to the victor of Pavia.
There were over a hundred triumphal chariots hung with draperies
which glittered with the armorial bearings of the House of
Bourbon&mdash;the three golden <i>fleurs de lis</i> on an azure
shield.</p>

<p>The Emperor himself, in his usual plain clothes, riding a mule,
was on the centre of the bridge to greet the Frenchman, though the
rain was falling heavily like broken silver spears from a level
grey sky, drenching the brocades and soaking the tall feathers of
the attendants.</p>

<p>The Connétable appeared, the curious spectators thought,
of a very handsome figure and fine carriage; his thick black hair
was combed either side his thin face with a gilt coif which he wore
under a hat of black silk. He wore a surcoat of black velvet lined
with cloth and silver and trimmed with fox, and cuffs of cloth and
silver showing through the slashes. His horse was a splendid grey
with steel harness and black velvet saddle-cloth. When he saw the
Emperor he dismounted, but Charles spurred on his mule to stop his
doing so, but as the Duke had already reached the ground the
Emperor slipped from his mule and embraced him, saying that he was
worthy of all honour.</p>

<p>Charles, as he rode beside his new master, whom he had not yet
seen, looked at him with earnest, sidelong glances, while the
Emperor spoke in his slow, quiet voice, praising the Frenchman and
extolling him for the victory of Pavia.</p>

<p>He was modest in attire and manner, with wrinkled brows, tired
eyes, and an underhung jaw; he looked much older than his years,
and bowed and depressed by anxiety and fatigue. In person he was
tall, athletic, and finely made; his air was very well tired, his
hands white and fine.</p>

<p>The Connétable liked him because of his manifest
simplicity and sincerity.</p>

<p>When they reached the modest white, green-shuttered palace where
the Emperor lodged, Charles was bidden into a little closet lined
with dark wood where an ebony crucifix hung above a plain desk
covered with cases and papers.</p>

<p>A little fire spluttered on the hearth; the Emperor held out his
cold fingers to the warmth and cried pleasantly:</p>

<p>"How cold it is!" He leaned forward, the thick, fair hair
falling either side his high, peculiar profile. He added abruptly,
"Marguerite d'Alençon came to see you, Connétable, in
the Alcazar."</p>

<p>"Sire, I know her. She cares for nothing but her brother. I
refused to be her go-between."</p>

<p>"I never thought she would move you," replied the Emperor
quietly. "She is clever, but false. Nay, perhaps not so clever.
When she found that she could not get her terms from me, she tried
to plot her brother's escape disguised as a negro servant. But I,"
added the Emperor simply, "am better served than Madame
d'Alençon thinks. Her scheme&mdash;childish, was it
not?&mdash;was instantly betrayed to me."</p>

<p>"May Your Majesty always be as fortunate in discovering the
Valois intrigues."</p>

<p>Charles V sighed.</p>

<p>"King François has agreed to everything."</p>

<p>"Everything!" The Connétable was startled.</p>

<p>"Ay, I had a letter in his own hand today; he agrees,
unconditionally, to all my terms in exchange for his liberty."</p>

<p>"I mistrust such a sudden surrender, sire;
everything&mdash;Milan, Burgundy, my estates!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he will join me in a crusade against the Turks. Do not
fear, Monsieur de Bourbon, I shall bind him with such oaths before
God and man as he will never dare break."</p>

<p>"I would not trust him."</p>

<p>The emperor smiled.</p>

<p>"I do. I must. He cannot lie to me before all Christendom."
Charles V turned and laid his hand on the other young man's
embroidered sleeve. "There is one clause in this pact that will
displease you. I promised you the hand of my sister Isabelle. Now
she is asked of me for François, to seal our alliance, so,
Monsieur de Bourbon, you see," added the Emperor, almost timidly,
"why I cannot suppose that the King of France will break his word
to me."</p>

<p>Charles had never seen the Emperor's sister, but his sense of
loss, of affront, was profound; he crushed his hat against his side
in strong distress.</p>

<p>"I could not do otherwise," said the Emperor sadly.</p>

<p>Charles thought, with humiliation, "Woman's work!"&mdash;and he
asked the King if it was not Marguerite d'Alençon that had
suggested this match.</p>

<p>The Emperor, looking up with brilliant, troubled eyes, said:</p>

<p>"Yes. But, Monsieur de Bourbon, I will make up to you for the
loss of my sister's hand. I will give you the Duchy of Milan."</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon bent his head; this was a splendid offer, but
he was sorely hurt in his pride, as Marguerite de Valois had meant
he should be, and he sighed, "I would rather have had an alliance
with Your Majesty than any possession on earth."</p>

<p>The Emperor, clasping his hands nervously in front of him and
speaking with an emphasis and haste most unusual to him, tried to
justify himself, using all the argument that he could think of to
clear himself of the stain of breaking his promise; he could not
say that his sister had declared that she would rather be Queen of
France than wife of a landless rebel.</p>

<p>The Connétable made no reply; he knew that he was
powerless; he pulled his jewelled gloves in his strong fingers and
bit his underlip. This was a deliberate humiliation, a deliberate
breaking of a promise, and he could not forgive the
Emperor&mdash;who kept repeating in a troubled voice that
François had yielded on every both as regards Charles de
Bourbon and his friends and the Imperial demands; he would give up
all claims to Italy, Aragon, Catalonia, Roussillon; he would
abandon Flanders and Artois, he would yield up Arras and Tournai,
he would restore the Duchy of Burgundy...</p>

<p>"And you," said Charles V anxiously, "you shall have
Milan&mdash;the cause of all these wars."</p>

<p>"I must take," smiled the Connétable, "what Your Majesty
chooses to give me. Milan is too much&mdash;yet less than your
sister's hand, which was promised me."</p>

<p>The Emperor bit his full underlip; he had never broken his word
before, he liked de Bourbon and would gladly have united him to his
House; but the temptation to bind François to him by this
marriage was not to be withstood.</p>

<p>"I am not free to keep my word," he laid. "You must forgive me,
Monsieur de Bourbon."</p>

<p>The Emperor spoke humbly, as if he were the subject and the
Frenchman the monarch; but Charles de Bourbon felt humiliated by
the gentle courtesy. He thought of all the possessions of this
quiet young man&mdash;the old World, the New World, cities, forts,
territories, castles, palaces, towns, villages, mountains and
rivers&mdash;all belonging to the Emperor.</p>

<p>"While I have nothing but promises&mdash;Milan! Mercenary's
pay..."</p>

<p>The young Emperor looked up at the sombre crucifix on the dark
walls.</p>

<p>"We must&mdash;all of us who try to rule the world&mdash;bear a
heavy burden, even that of some dishonour," he said in his fatigued
voice. "I offer you Milan. I do what I can."</p>

<p>"Sire, I would rather have my estates than Milan; I would rather
have the Bourbonnais, Auvergne, Chantelle, Moulins, Montbrison,
Sauvigny&mdash;where my wife and children lie."</p>

<p>"All these François has promised to restore to you."</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon did not reply; he too looked at the crucifix,
fearing the betrayal of the man whom he had himself betrayed,
fearing that never again would he see France. The light of the
fluttering flames, the haggard face of the young Emperor&mdash;who,
as if speaking to himself, declared nervously:</p>

<p>"Yes, I will trust him; he is a Christian&mdash;a King. I must
hazard something on his honour. I pray that he will keep his
word."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Charles de Bourbon.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In the January of the next year François de Valois swore
on an altar arranged in his chamber after the Archbishop of Bembrum
had said Mass and the treaty had been read, swore on the Holy
Gospel to keep faith; he then signed the document on which the
terms were inscribed, and, as if this was not sufficient, he passed
his knightly word in a most binding manner, putting his hand in
that of the Viceroy of Naples, Charles de Lannoy.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">I, François de Valois, King of France, give
my word to the Emperor Charles that six weeks after I am set at
liberty I will restore to him Burgundy and all the places mentioned
in this Treaty of Peace, and that if all is not delivered up within
four months I will return within the power of the Emperor as his
prisoner of war.</p>

<p><br>
A month afterwards Charles and François met half-way
between Toledo and Madrid, and there François repeated
personally his promises to the Emperor; and the two Princes parted,
commending each other to the care of his Creator. The Emperor
returned to his labours and the King to freedom and his own
country, where, at Saint Jean de Luz, his mother and his sister
waited for him in triumph.</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon waited for the fulfilment of the King's
promise while, outwardly magnificent, he attended the marriage
festivities of the Emperor in Seville.</p>

<p>He felt an exile in the Spanish city, and he could not look upon
the Emperor's sister&mdash;the widowed Queen of Portugal, now
betrothed to François&mdash;without thinking of a broken
promise and the delicate malice of Marguerite de Valois and the
subtle hate of Louise of Savoy. Yet Charles seemed at the summit of
his fortune. The future was golden with promise; everything that
was lost would be his again&mdash;ay, and more besides. As Duke of
Milan he would be a sovereign prince, and if he was not the
Emperor's brother-in-law he was the Emperor's friend and trusted
general.</p>

<p>But something was amiss and out of harmony. His dreams were
continuous and heavy; he could hardly close his eyes without seeing
the pale face of Suzanne and that other pearl-like countenance of
Marguerite de Valois&mdash;one that seemed to warn and one that
seemed a menace; and too often he trod in visions the slopes above
Rome, sat upon the amber-coloured blocks of masonry, looked down
upon the yellow river, and looked up at the flight of
doves&mdash;whose coloured pinions of purple, blue, and green
seemed to beat like angels' wings under the blue dome of heaven.
Too much of the past impinged upon the present, and in the severe
yet splendid Spanish city he was not at home, and every day
increased his nostalgia for the Bourbonnais, the pearls, the
daisies, Chantelle and Moulins&mdash;the past that could never be
again.</p>

<p>"When will you be satisfied?" asked de Lurcy, who was nearer his
confidence than any man.</p>

<p>"When I rule in Moulins again," replied Charles. "Satisfied? No,
not then. De Lurcy, I have a great desire to see Rome again. I
should like to see the paintings of the Umbrian&mdash;the Tomb of
the Medici in San Lorenzo. I wonder what has happened to the old
beggar on the Palatine, and the poor little painter Testard. De
Lurcy, those Valois women have the book of Madame Suzanne.</p>

<p>"Truly, I never saw a man so homesick as you are,
monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Not many men have lost so much."</p>

<p>"Not many men have so much to gain, monseigneur. You stand at
the Emperor's right hand. When he crosses the Alps to receive the
Iron Crown of Lombardy you will be invested with the Duchy of
Milan."</p>

<p>"You speak as if I were a child to be amused by toys!" smiled
Charles. "Milan! I think a man must fight for that; and I am tired
of fighting, de Lurcy."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The Emperor sent for the Connétable suddenly in the heart
of a midsummer day, when the hot streets were full of dust and the
succulent flowers drooped for lack of water in the palace
courtyard.</p>

<p>Charles V was in his little closet that the Connétable
knew so well&mdash;that plain room where, with his industrious
secretaries, he spent hours of toil exhausting himself to rule his
Empire, planning to maintain Christendom against the Turk and the
heretic.</p>

<p>Contrary to his custom he was not bowed over his desk, but
standing in front of his chair as Charles de Bourbon entered; the
Frenchman saw that he was deeply moved, his face slightly distorted
as if he grimaced to keep his control, his long fine fingers were
clutched in the ruffles at his wrist, and his spare frame shook
under his black doublet with the silver points; but he spoke
unfalteringly and at once.</p>

<p>"You shall hear this news from no one save myself, Monsieur de
Bourbon."</p>

<p>"François de Valois!" exclaimed the
Connétable.</p>

<p>"Yes; the Pope&mdash;that bastard Medici, that lying,
huckstering Florentine&mdash;has absolved him from his oath?"</p>

<p>"From the treaty of Madrid, sire?</p>

<p>"Yes, from everything. François defies me. He declares
that the word of a prisoner is worthless&mdash;he will keep none of
the conditions.</p>

<p>"So much I feared!" exclaimed Charles de Bourbon, with exceeding
bitterness.</p>

<p>"There is more," said the Emperor deliberately. "They league
against me. A few hours ago I received the dispatches. An alliance
has been made at Cognac
between&mdash;this&mdash;this&mdash;liar&mdash;this forsworn
traitor, and Venice, the Sforza, the English King&mdash;and that
false Medici at Rome."</p>

<p>"War," smiled Charles de Bourbon.</p>

<p>"War between Christians, while the Turk harries our frontiers
and the heretic gnaws our vitals. Never would I have believed such
folly, such treachery. You, who knew him, did not trust him. I
should have listened to you."</p>

<p>"Sire, you are too high-minded to deal with François de
Valois."</p>

<p>The Emperor turned his wan face aside.</p>

<p>"A second time I break my promise to you. You will not have your
estates unless you win another victory like Pavia. You will never
have the Duchy of Milan unless you can win it by force of
arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, sire, is the object of this league?" asked Charles de
Bourbon.</p>

<p>"To destroy me," replied the Emperor with great simplicity.
"Because François would have had my place. The Pope thinks
that I grow too great, I suppose; but who knows what is the motive
of the Medici?"</p>

<p>"François de Valois intends to destroy me also,
sire."</p>

<p>"I think so. If he would forgive, the women will not."</p>

<p>"Farewell, the Bourbonnais, the Auvergne, Moulins,
Chantelle!"</p>

<p>"We must go on," said the Emperor, still looking aside. "I am
much shaken by this treachery&mdash;but we must go on. Perhaps you
despise me. You captured my enemy for me, and I lost him."</p>

<p>"I will fight for you, sire," replied the Connétable,
"against a world in arms."</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> it will be," smiled Charles V. "A world in arms."
He moved slowly, wearily, to his desk, and made a gesture towards
his heaped papers. "You in the field, Monsieur de Bourbon; I
here&mdash;to see if we can break this League of Cognac."</p>

<p>He put his hand on the other man's shoulder, seemed about to
speak, but said no more and turned to his desk.</p>

<p>"I must go on," thought Charles de Bourbon. "Ay, indeed I must
go on and follow a dark way."</p>

<p>As he stepped into the May sunshine it seemed as if he could
hear the laughter of Louise and Marguerite blowing past his
ears.</p>

The League of Cognac.<br>
Spring 1526.</h2>
<br>

<p class="verse">Dead Painter, whom I praised<br>
Caress'd and even fee'd<br>
What high hope hast thou raised<br>
To help my tedious need?<br>
only Beauty, who speaks no word<br>

What truth is it I never heard<br>

"WHAT says the Pope?" asked Charles de Bourbon. "Will he in no
way disclose his mind?"</p>

<p>The Imperial Envoy, returned from Rome, answered:</p>

<p>"When I spoke to His Holiness about this League of Cognac and
asked whether or no he was in it, he said, 'You may go or stay as
you please, but if I make war, you will hear the trumpets at
Rome.'"</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon replied:</p>

<p>"There is so much treachery that a man knows not how to
behave."</p>

<p>To those three words which had always tormented him&mdash;men
and money&mdash;was now added this fourth&mdash;treachery. How
could a man make any headway, take any definite action, attain any
worth-while achievement, when on every side was treachery? The
treachery of the King of France, that now! Who would have believed
that when he had been given his freedom with all honour and
courtesy he would have repudiated his knightly word, his solemn
oath, his signature to a pact? He had lied, that man, in the face
of his friends, his enemies, and God.</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon himself was stripped of everything, even
hope. He was now no more than was Giovanni delle Bande
Nere&mdash;who, disappointed of his pay by the King of France, had
joined the Imperial League against him. Ay, no more than a
mercenary, though his title was Generalissimo for His Imperial
Majesty in Italy.</p>

<p>Charles took up this high post with a sense of bitter irony,
which was as much for himself as for his fortune. A man who is
continually cheated and betrayed and left at last with nothing must
come to despise himself; and Charles looked back continually into
the past, spying out in his own actions those little traces of
weakness, of indecision, even of lying and of treachery, that had
at last&mdash;together with some ill luck&mdash;left him where he
was: a soldier of fortune fighting for his pay.</p>

<p>Milan was besieged again&mdash;he had to keep that fact before
his mind; he must save that city as he had saved Pavia. He sailed
from Barcelona with six ships laden with eight hundred soldiers,
and then, having landed, by forced marches arrived before the walls
in the first week of July, there taking command of the besieging
army, which amounted, with Spaniards and Germans, to nine thousand
men. He had brought some money from the Imperial bankers in Genoa,
a hundred thousand ducats, which he distributed at once among the
troops. This, with his reputation for audacity and courage and
magnificent appearance and great name, at once raised his prestige
high among the Imperial troops.</p>

<p>Charles had everything required to grace his position as
Generalissimo for the Emperor. Whatever was weak or faulty in his
character did not show in his person; he went splendidly, as bold
and as beautiful as his new banner, in his gilt hats and black
toques, and mantles of watered crimson and scarlet, and corslets of
silver, and with the jewels that he wore over his gloves and in his
belt and on his spurs; he rode only the finest horses, richly
caparisoned and armoured in wrought steel; attendants, pages, and
men-at-arms wearing his own liveries and carrying his own
banderoles accompanied him. He was very careful about all this
display, thus covering up by all the means in his power that he was
a landless man, a man without a wife or an establishment or an
heir; but when he was alone in the gorgeous tent above which
floated the white plumes of Bourbon, his dreams invaded him, and
the days given to action and stern labour gave place to nights
broken by many fancies.</p>

<p>War and destruction! These two things obsessed him. Sometimes he
would sit by his table with his helmet in front of him, and out of
the open vizor he would see small figures of men-at-arms and
wounded horses charging, fighting, returning and in this
phantasmagoria, like an infernal dance of war, the Turks advancing
on the Christians with diamonds blazing in their turbans and the
Crescent held high above their gleaming lances; the Christians
rending one another and so unable to combine against the Turks; the
heretics advancing in fanatic haste against the adherents of the
Church; the Church striking back not only with open weapons but
with all the devices of treachery; and above all, throned so high
that his head seemed in the clouds, the second Medici to wear the
Papal Tiara glittering darkly in the richness of the Vatican,
surrounded by Raffaello's pictures and Michael Angelo's statues and
the jewels of Benvenuto Cellini, with his music and his comedy and
his slim young pages and his cold face with the black almond eyes
and curling lips.</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon, in those brief moments when he was alone in
his tent, saw all these things passing round him, and they made
life seem foolish and flavouless as if he were but a puppet and
some unknown power were jerking the strings. He did not know why he
fought for the Emperor, who had not paid him the one price he had
asked&mdash;his sister's hand. He scarcely knew why he hated
François or Louise, his mother, nor why they pursued him
with such bitter fury.</p>

<p>When had begun that first spark of jealousy which now had been
turned into a flame that would surely destroy him?</p>

<p>The Duchy of Milan&mdash;he had been promised that rich lure;
the Duchy that had tempted François across the Alps and that
the Emperor had defended so passionately was to be his if he could
win it. Charles hardly knew whether that would please him or no,
and always his longings and his yearnings went back to the hill
outside Rome when he had sat on the golden stone and watched the
yellow river running beside the palaces and the slums below.</p>

<p>To escape from it all, to be at peace&mdash;if not in a
hermitage, then in a fine villa, high up, with the water trickling
over blue rocks and the ilex trees bending their grey branches
against the sky's faint azure; to sit there at leisure by a marble
table, leaning out of a window where the sharp leaves and yellow
fruit of the citron brushed against the sill; to turn over a book
or handle a gleaming musical instrument, perchance to write a
sonnet or leisurely, ironic memoirs; even to pass one's fingers
over a curling plume of white ostrich or over the raised design of
a Venetian brocade or Genoese damask.</p>

<p>Why could not life be so composed of these little delights? His
soul needed no more, those things and a gentle companion like his
Suzanne.</p>

<p>His face hardened when he thought of her. No other man had
desired her, she had not been loved by any save himself; why, then,
could she not have been spared if he alone valued her? He tried to
decide if he believed in the God who had taken his children and
Suzanne.</p>

<p>Often he was tormented by his old enemy the tertian fever, and
though in the daytime he kept it down, in the night it would master
him and colour his visions into bitter and alarming fancies;
sometimes in those feverish hours he was walking the corridor of
the Vatican, where he had never put his mortal foot, and gazing at
the group of "The Laocoön" which François had been
cheated into believing that he possessed at Fontainebleau, or
seated beside the dead Pope watching the comedy at Bologna, staring
at Leo, who, with bloodshot eyes, peered through his spy-glass at
the figures of the two half-naked women on the stage trailing
star-sprinkled gauzes against the dropcloth painted by
Raffaello.</p>

<p>Charles found a certain dullness and monotony in this siege,
though it was so full of high incident, of perils, and of the
chances of death. Urbino, commanding for Venice, retreated with his
artillery; but Giovanni de' Medici, who commanded the Black Bands
composing the Papal infantry, refused to withdraw until it was
broad daylight, when he moved his men back in sullen defiance; the
Imperial garrison in Milan, heartened by this, sent an appeal to
the Connétable to come more resolutely to their aid and to
attack the Citadel, which was held by Francesco Sforza for the
League.</p>

<p>By the end of July this Citadel was surrendered to the
Connétable; but no sooner had Charles found Himself in Milan
than the Duke of Urbino changed his mind and, instead of
retreating, came back, this time not to take Milan by assault but
to reduce it by famine. But Charles was not disheartened, for he
knew that the King of France was playing his usual game and
betraying the League as he had betrayed everyone else with whom he
had ever had any dealings. He had not sent the galleys that he had
promised to blockade the harbour of Genoa, nor had he sent across
the Alps the five hundred men-at-arms and four thousand
foot-soldiers that were to have joined the army of the League, nor
had he supplied the promised money that was to have paid the Swiss
levies. Both the Pope and Venice began to be irritated and to lose
courage.</p>

<p>In August, Urbino left Milan to besiege Cremona, leaving
Giovanni de' Medici in charge of the siege of Milan.</p>

<p>With an interest that was half sympathy and half scorn, Charles
de Bourbon heard how the young soldier of fortune who commanded the
besiegers employed his time and the great banquets that he gave
with five services of forty dishes: partridges, pheasants, wild
boars, peacocks, bustards, ducks garnished with macaroni, wines
from Lombardy and Piedmont, Tuscany and Sicily.</p>

<p>When the Connétable made his inspection of the walls he
could see the brilliant torchlight flaming and smoking from the
camp of the Medici. Courtesies were exchanged between the garrison
and the besiegers; once Giovanni de' Medici sent to Lombardy for
fresh pomegranates because he had heard that the Marquis del Vasto
was ill with fever and longed for fresh fruit, but he could not
refrain from sending under the disguise of courtesy news of the
fall of Cremona&mdash;to which de Leyva replied by sending the
Medici an account of the raid of Cardinal Pompeo Colonna on
Rome.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The figure of the Medici Pope took on fantastic proportions to
Charles, shut up in Milan in his harassed inactivity.</p>

<p>Clement had fled before Colonna and his eight thousand peasants
who sacked the Vatican quarter, and from the safety of Sant' Angelo
promised everything demanded&mdash;even to leaving the League.</p>

<p>Charles waited for the Papal levies to leave the walls of Milan,
but they remained, for the Pope continued to pay the Black Bands of
Giovanni de' Medici, recalling some of them to devastate the lands
of the Colonna, nor were his galleys withdrawn from Genoa.</p>

<p>"De Lurcy," said Charles de Bourbon, "I hope there may be some
rest in heaven, for there is none on earth&mdash;yet nothing else
seems good to me but rest."</p>

<p>He was weary of the alien city, sullen in the sweet autumn days,
full of discontented troops, dying men, and a hostile population;
his homesickness increased daily; even in the mighty Cathedral he
did not feel as near God as he had felt in his chapel at
Moulins.</p>

<p>He often reminded de Lurcy of that ride from Chantelle, that
rapid flight through the dark, the adventures they had had before
they reached Burgundy.</p>

<p>"I should never have fled like a hare, de Lurcy. I have never
been happy since."</p>

<p>By various devices dispatches from the Emperor were smuggled
through Giovanni de' Medici's men to Charles de Bourbon. They were
always precisely worded, expressing a quiet resolution, a steadfast
courage, cool and able.</p>

<p>"A great man, I think," thought Charles; "but what shall that
avail me?"</p>

<p>The Emperor's implacable anger fell most harshly on the Pope; he
wrote that he intended to summon Clement VII before a General
Council for his unworthy behaviour in interfering in the quarrels
of Christendom.</p>

<p>The Emperor wrote to Charles of other measures he had, with
obstinate energy, concerted against the League.</p>

<p>A fleet had been equipped on the Spanish coast to convey ten
thousand Spanish and German soldiers to Italy. A levy had been made
in Germany of <i>Landsknechte</i>, who were to be sent to Lombardy
under the command of Georg Frundsberg. But Charles de Bourbon
himself, heavy with fever and much oppressed by dreams, could send
but ill news in return.</p>

<p><i>During the last month there have been quite three thousand of
your men laid up with sickness. The money I have received from
Spain is not enough to pay the soldiers...</i></p>

<p>Men and money! Men and money! Again the burden of his thoughts
and the burden of his letters.</p>

<p><i>Send the Landsknechte, send the Switzers, send money,
I implore Your Majesty. I am reduced to the most terrible
extremities.</i></p>

<p>He was beaten in his mind, too, by the monotony, by the
inaction, by the constant fever, by the continual dreams. If only
there could be a battle like the fight outside Pavia in the park of
Mirabello, if only he could do something except rot in
idleness!</p>

<p><i>When this help arrives I hope by the Grace of God to prevent
your enemies from making war upon Your Majesty by gaining such a
victory as will be a perpetual settlement of your dominions.</i></p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles rode through the silent streets of Milan; the few
passers-by gave him looks of hatred, shutters were closed, women
retired from balconies as he passed with his little train of
officers, the monks going to and from the pesthouse glanced at him
and shuffled out of his way. The great city was drained of money,
almost of food; neither the bankers, nor the merchants, nor the
private citizens could give Charles any more pay or provisions for
his troops.</p>

<p>"De Lurcy," asked Charles, looking round the gloomy streets, "do
you think it possible that the Emperor will leave us here&mdash;to
starve surrounded by mutinying troops?"</p>

<p>"The Emperor will send the money if he has it," replied de
Lurcy. "But if the Fuggers will advance no more?"</p>

<p>"Dispatches&mdash;always dispatches, words, and promises!"
sighed Charles. "But without the money, del Vasto and de Leyva are
for breaking out through the Medici's men and trying to join
Frundsberg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two difficulties there, monseigneur," said de Lurcy. "The
troops will not leave Milan without pay, and Frundsberg will never
be able to cross the Alps with winter coming on."</p>

<p>"I know him&mdash;I think he will. As for the money, we must get
it somehow. Look at those children, de Lurcy, how listless they
are, and how often the church-bells toll!"</p>

<p>"The malaria comes up from the plain in winter; there are many
deaths, monseigneur."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles sent for Antonio de Leyva and the young Marchese del
Vasto, Pescara's nephew; a charcoal fire warmed the chamber lined
with gilt leather and cut velvet from Genoa. On the table of purple
marble, resting on the clawed feet of griffins, was a service of
silver gilt for wine and a basalt bowl of fruit, the last
half-withered harvest of the autumn. Beside this was a heap of
rings, chains, and brooches.</p>

<p>"We three," said Charles, smiling slightly, "have much to
decide."</p>

<p>"There is nothing that we can decide," replied the swarthy
Spanish soldier, "until the Emperor sends us money."</p>

<p>"The Emperor will send us no money, de Leyva, he will, indeed,
scarcely think of us at all. A disaster has occurred that will make
his Italian adventurer seem small to him."</p>

<p>"A disaster!" exclaimed del Vasto.</p>

<p>"One of the spies whom I sent out has contrived to return in the
disguise of a Franciscan. Giovanni de' Medici arrested him, but
allowed him to go without discovering who he was. Messieurs," added
Charles, "not long ago the Emperor told me in very simple words
news that destroyed all my hopes, the news that François had
broken the treaty of Madrid. Now I, in my turn, have to give horrid
tidings in a brief manner.</p>

<p>"What can there be," asked de Leyva grimly, "worse than we
know&mdash;that we are shut up here, besieged, with starving,
mutinous troops, an exhausted city, and no hope of help?"</p>

<p>"There is this," said Charles. "The Turk has broken across the
frontiers of Christendom and defeated the Hungarians at Mohàcs,
King Louis and all his force are slain; I suppose by now the
Infidel is at Buda."</p>

<p>The two soldiers crossed themselves; del Vasto, who loathed the
Medici, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is the Pope that has brought this disgrace on Christendom
with his meddling, his double dealing, his treachery!"</p>

<p>"It is François de Valois," declared de Leyva; "did not
all say that when he was a prisoner in Madrid his sister sent
letters to the Turk bidding him invade the Empire?"</p>

<p>"It is a great disaster," said Charles, "but one must consider
how it affects us. Remember that the widowed Queen of Hungary is
the Emperor's sister, remember how pious he is, how hot against the
Infidel! He will no longer have any concern for us. We are now but
the desperate end of a dead adventure&mdash;every ducat, every man
that the emperor can raise will be used for the defence of
Buda."</p>

<p>The young Italian Marchese laughed shortly and stared down at
his fingers outspread on his knees. "Santa Maria! but I am weary of
it all."</p>

<p>"Have you thought of anything we can do?" asked del Vasto
keenly.</p>

<p>"I have other news. My man brought a message from one of
Frundsberg's scouts who had got down into Italy. Frundsberg is
coming with thirteen thousand men. He asks me to send him
money."</p>

<p>De Leyva, who was stimulated by difficulty and danger, laughed
harshly.</p>

<p>"But Frundsberg is no longer needed in Italy, and we have not a
white piece to give him."</p>

<p>"Who can turn him back? He must be half across the Tyrolese
Alps. He was engaged, he comes to take his pay." Charles pulled
some of the dusky, withered grapes from the bowl and arranged them
in groups on the table.</p>

<p>"Has Frundsberg heard of Mohàcs?" asked del Vasto.</p>

<p>"I do not know. He has done as the Emperor bade him."</p>

<p>The three men were silent in the still room hung with gilded
leather; the thoughts of all of them were his on that valiant old
mercenary, Georg Frundsberg, Prince of Mindelheim, who was crossing
the Tyrolese Alps with his thirteen thousand Germans from Swabia,
Franconia, and Bavaria and the Tyrol; four thousand of these were
Lutherans who had served without pay in a crusade against the Pope
and were inspired by fanatic zeal.</p>

<p>Charles knew the quality of these men, who had so largely helped
in the victory of Pavia.</p>

<p>"The Pope and François," he said, "have brought the
Infidel into the Empire, and the Emperor has brought the heretic
into Italy."</p>

<p>"Let them live on the Papal estates," said del Vasto. "There
must be enough money in Florence to pay them."</p>

<p>"Urbino protects that; the forces of Venice are large, well
equipped, well paid;" said Charles. He played with his grapes,
thinking of Frundsberg leading his men over the Alps with winter
approaching; with their cumbrous baggage and provisions, with their
long pikes and massive two-handed swords, under falling stones,
avoiding avalanches, across untrodden snow with hidden glaciers,
over the icy summits of the untrodden mountains, along unfrequented
paths, through mists of blinding snow, the Lutherans were advancing
on the plains of Italy, as once the barbarians had made their way
to Rome&mdash;as Hannibal had crossed the mountains of Savoy.</p>

<p>"He is making for the Col di Sabbia. I suppose he should be
there by January. He has, I think, received nothing beyond the
fifty thousand ducats the Emperor sent by way of Flanders, and the
thirty-six thousand I raised here; by the time he reaches Italy at
least a hundred thousand ducats will be due to him, and there will
be the expense of maintaining his army."</p>

<p>"If he comes down between Brescia and Mantua," said de Leyva,
"he will be in the territory of the d'Este; which side does he
take?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" exclaimed del Vasto impatiently. "The Marchese
Frederico is prudent, he acknowledges the Emperor to be his feudal
lord, and he is Gonfalonière of the Pope; let him feed the
<i>Landsknechte</i>."</p>

<p>"He cannot for long do so," said Charles, "nor pay them.
Frundsberg considers himself employed by me, Imperial Generalissimo
in Italy." He smiled in self-mockery. "I am, as you know, without
orders, without money, in command of unpaid, mutinous troops. I
wish to fulfil my obligations to Prince Georg."</p>

<p>"Even when he gains Mantua how can you reach him?" asked del
Vasto. "Consider the rivers, the marshes between us and
Mantua&mdash;the floods of winter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you sit here and starve or rot with disease?" demanded
Charles with sudden passion. "What can be greater misery than to
sit here inactive in this city which, by sour jest, is mine by the
Emperor's gift?"</p>

<p>"How are we to get out?" asked de Leyva sharply.</p>

<p>"I know from spies that Giovanni de' Medici is as weary of this
siege as we are, and I think that Urbino will withdraw him to meet
Frundsberg. It is clear that, at all costs, they will try to save
Florence."</p>

<p>"The soldiers will not move without pay," said de Leyva.</p>

<p>Charles moved his hand towards the pile of chains, rings, and
brooches beside the bowl of fruit.</p>

<p>"That is all I have. I thought that if we could raise Forty
thousand ducats the men might march."</p>

<p>De Leyva took off the gold chain he wore and added it to the
heap of valuables.</p>

<p>"That is all I have of any value," he said. "I doubt if there
are forty thousand ducats in Milan."</p>

<p>The young Italian had little to give&mdash;he had already sold
almost everything he possessed for the maintenance of his own men;
he took off two rings, a buckle from his cloak, a brooch from his
shirt.</p>

<p>The three men smiled at each other; Charles poured wine for the
other two soldiers.</p>

<p>"I have taken every valuable that I could find in Milan," he
said, "even to the precious metals in the churches. For myself I
have nothing left but my personal equipment. There are many costly
things in Milan&mdash;pictures, furniture, stuffs, and
statuary&mdash;but it is impossible to turn these into ready
money."</p>

<p>Antonio de Leyva drank his wine slowly.</p>

<p>"Let us supper the impossible, Monsieur de Bourbon; imagine that
we have induced our men to move, that we have crossed these swollen
marshes, these rivers in spate, that we have joined Frundsberg and
his unpaid, desperate men at Mantua; what then?"</p>

<p>The Marchese del Vasto at Charles, who said with irony, crushing
his hand down on the withered grapes:</p>

<p>"Perhaps by then the Emperor will have sent some money."</p>

<p>"Why did the Emperor send for these men?" asked del Vasto
impatiently. "He must have known that he could never pay them."</p>

<p>"He did not know of Mohàcs," replied Charles.</p>

<p>"Let Frundsberg take Florence and pay his troops from the
coffers of the Medici," said de Leyva.</p>

<p>"Urbino will protect Florence," said Charles.</p>

<p>A bell tolled outside; the day was beginning to leave the dark
chamber where the three men sat round the bowl of withered fruit,
the pile of pale gold and jewels, the glasses of wine.</p>

<p>"Then," smiled de Leyva, "we must march on Rome. Let the Pope
pay Frundsberg's men."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Giovanni delle Bande Nere was ordered by the Duke of Urbino to
leave the walls of Milan and to advance against Frundsberg as he
descended into the Italian plains between Brescia and Mantua.</p>

<p>For months the cry of the weary young captain had been "Let me
depart". He was sickened by the long siege, by the sight of the
massive ramparts round Milan, of the flags of the Empire and of
Bourbon floating above them, of the poplars on the Lombard plain,
of the cold night mists, of the long idleness.</p>

<p>The Pope sent money regularly to pay his troops, but the Black
Bands wanted more than their pay; they required action, the chances
of victory, of spoil, the excitement of change and opportunity.</p>

<p>From one of the towers of the fortifications Charles watched the
Medici strike camp and so raise the long siege; as the dark train
moved away into the mists, horses, mules, standards,
baggage-wagons, bands of fighting men passing out of sight into the
colourless day, Charles knew that he was now free to join
Frundsberg&mdash;if he could. By straining every resource he had
raised from the stricken city by the sale of his personal effects
and those of de Leyva and del Vasto nearly forty thousand ducats;
this sum had been divided among his men and they had promised to
march towards Mantua. It was far away and the weather was severe;
every day the snow fell, and Charles shuddered in his furs. No
message came from the Emperor, and an increasing loneliness
enveloped his soul as he saluted the dark image of his enemy
passing across Italy with his long train; the shadows of war, pest,
and death were over the land, the skies were as dark as if black
wings covered them.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Giovanni de' Medici and his Black Bands moved heavily across the
Mantuan marshes; the hired fighting men from Italy nosed about for
the hired fighting men from beyond the Alps. They were weary and
dispirited from the long beleaguerment of Milan, from the black
winter, the foul mud that splashed to their knees, the icy wind
that blew on them continuously; they could not find out where
Frundsberg and his mercenaries were encamped, but a captured spy
told the Medici that the Duke of Ferrara, out of hatred for the
Pope, had sent Frundsberg some pieces of artillery and
provisions.</p>

<p>Giovanni cursed and pushed forward across the swamps; a
straggler from his rearguard came up one night to his desolate
encampment and found him melancholy in the tent where the wind
whistled in the cordage.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Giovanni, "the Frenchman, Charles de Bourbon, has
left Milan and is advancing to join Frundsberg."</p>

<p>"Let him come on&mdash;has the Emperor sent him any money?"
Giovanni put his rough hand to his cropped hair and stern brow; his
attitude, his look, were grim with tedium.</p>

<p>"Not that we have discovered. He has had everything out of Milan
to the last white piece."</p>

<p>Giovanni bent to trim the poor lamp. He lacked everything; the
Pope's supplies were barely sufficient to pay his men, and he was
himself a penniless cadet of his famous House. He sighed, thinking
of his wife and son who lived at the Vatican and importuned the
Pope in vain for favours.</p>

<p>"If I could meet Charles de Bourbon or Frundsberg I should be
satisfied. I wish that I had led these men over the Alps in winter.
Such feats are the only ones worth performing."</p>

<p>He stretched his powerful arms and muttered some complaints of
the Duke of Urbino, who was playing too prudent a game for the
liking of Giovanni de' Medici; why had he divided his army, leaving
half on the banks of the Adda?</p>

<p>"I should not marvel if he allowed Bourbon and Frundsberg to
meet," grumbled the stern captain. The tent flaps were torn aside;
one of the officers of the Black Bands, wet and wind-blown,
reported breathlessly that a column of Frundsberg's men had been
espied hastening with a train of artillery across the road through
the swamps towards Castiglione delle Stivere.</p>

<p>Within half an hour Giovanni de' Medici was in the saddle of his
great black horse and galloping with a body of his cavalry towards
the rearguard of the Germans.</p>

<p>Frundsberg's men, proceeding slowly with their falconets, which
Ferrara had given them, turned to face the attackers. Planting
their ragged yellow, red, and black standards in their midst they
fired their newly acquired artillery at the Italians.</p>

<p>The sharp onslaught of the Black Bands drove the gunners from
their posts, and after a short scuffle Frundsberg's mercenaries
retreated, leaving many of their number dying in the mud.</p>

<p>Giovanni de' Medici called his men off the pursuit, for the
bitter night was falling and the thick snow-storm increasing; but
as he rejoiced in blood and death, in all the horrid gages of
victory, he turned his sweating horse aside in order that he might
gaze at the Switzers and Germans sprawled in the icy mud. The
gunners with the last of the retreating breech-loading guns saw his
black figure gigantic against the break in the western clouds where
the sun was sinking behind snowy vapours.</p>

<p>The Germans fired at this mighty target, and with a shout of
rage Giovanni de' Medici fell down among the dead he had been
gazing at, while his neighing horse reared in the air.</p>

<p>His men rushed stumbling in the freezing mud, cursing the
Germans, whose clattering train was swallowed up into the cold murk
of the winter night.</p>

<p>Giovanni de' Medici had been shot in the thigh; the ball had
driven the light <i>cuissard</i> he wore round his thigh into the
bone, and the great captain lay helpless on the black Mantuan
marsh. It was impossible to move him, even though from the leaden
sky the snow was falling steadily. His soldiers sent for the Jewish
physician, Abraham, who had attended him after his wound at Pavia.
But this man could do nothing; the entire leg was crushed,
fragments of metal being embedded in the flesh. The old doctor, his
Eastern face pinched and yellow from the cold, his furred robe
blowing about his shrunken limbs, stood staring down at the young
man who smiled up at him from the purple cloaks they had put as his
pillow.</p>

<p>"Take him to Mantua," shivered Abraham. "An amputation might
save his life. Will they receive him in Mantua?"</p>

<p>"Ay, the Duke is neutral," smiled Giovanni. "So&mdash;I must
lose my leg! Damnation on their new-fangled weapons!"</p>

<p>The heavy man was raised on to a litter hastily made from spears
and horses' harness, and under the black sky was carried by his
men, eight and eight in turn, through the stinging snow eight weary
miles to Mantua. There the Captain of the Black Bands was taken to
the palace of Federico Gonzaga, and his dear friend Pietro the
Aretino was sent for.</p>

<p>When the cloths with which the doctor had bound the leg were
removed, the limb was found to be a mass of broken bone, fragments
of steel, and torn flesh. The Mantuan doctors declared that it must
be amputated, and old Abraham suggested that ten or twelve persons
should hold the powerful man during the agony of the operation.</p>

<p>The young Medici, hearing this, smiled.</p>

<p>"Twenty could not hold me if I wished to move."</p>

<p>The bed-chamber in the Gonzaga palace had red walls, with a
freize of angels; the winter hangings of the bed were of white
wool; under the wounded man lay three mattresses, blankets, and
piles of linen. The doctors took off his armour, his leather coat,
and he lay back against the pillows in his shirt. On his massive
breast, damp with sweat, hung a little silver reliquary given him
by his wife; his clean-shaven face with the small, frowning eyes
was as still as a mask. His favourite captain, Anibale Testa, stood
by the bedside with Pietro the Aretino. It was cold in the chamber
despite the Tastily lit fire of pine logs; the wind whistled in the
chimney and under the heavy door; outside the snow fell
heavily.</p>

<p>"Do it quickly," said Giovanni de' Medici.</p>

<p>The instruments were brought in and the warrior stretched out
his large, scarred hand for the candle in the stick of red
copper.</p>

<p>"No," whispered the Aretino, shuddering, "there is light enough
in the room.</p>

<p>"I shall hold it," smiled Giovanni. He heaved his huge,
half-naked torso up from the pillows and held the wax taper to
light the mangled mass of flesh, steel, and bone that the doctors
had uncovered.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The night passed heavily; in the antechamber the exhausted
doctors and pages slept uneasily; in the red chamber with the
angels hovering along the upper walls the fire burnt to ashes and
the ashes were scattered by the rising wind into the silent
room.</p>

<p>Half that night Giovanni seemed to Pietro the Aretino, who
anxiously watched him, to sleep well; but in the morning the pain
coiled round the body like a serpent, and the Medici, who had
nothing to leave, made his will, leaving to his beloved wife Maria
Salviati the guardianship of his beloved young son Cosimo. He owed
money, and he had no trust in the promises of his fickle uncle, the
Pope; he had delighted in slaughter, in blood and all that was
fierce and savage, but he believed in religion and mercy, and
confessed to the priest, whispering:</p>

<p>"Father, I have followed the profession of arms and I have lived
a soldier's life. If it were not forbidden, I could confess in the
presence of all that I have never done anything unworthy of
myself."</p>

<p>When the stooping, slippered priest and the neat lawyer had
gone, the sick man called his friends about him; the reluctant,
winter dawn had not penetrated this chamber, where only a lamp
dispelled the shadows. Giovanni de' Medici whispered of worldly
affairs.</p>

<p>"Will my uncle, the Pope, pay my men? Urbino will never prevent
Frundsberg and Bourbon from meeting. What does he, Bourbon, mean to
do? Attack Florence? These falconets on pivots are pestilent
weapons. How much did that ball weigh? Thirty pounds?" He clasped
Pietro's hand impulsively. "Comfort Maria. It is hard to lose one's
husband at twenty-eight years of age."</p>

<p>His sight began to fail and strong shoots of agony shook his
mutilated frame.</p>

<p>"I am at peace," he muttered. I have done no wrong.</p>

<p>But he was not resigned, and as he felt Death gaining on him, he
tried to fight him as he had fought so many other enemies; and
crying out, "I will not die in the midst of these plasters," he was
taken from his soft mattresses and down cushions and all the
devices of the doctors, and, raised in the arms of his friends,
laid on a camp bed in the antechamber, where he died suddenly,
twenty-eight years of age and the greatest captain of the Holy
League.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>When Charles de Bourbon heard of the death of his enemy, he said
to himself, "And who next?" and, glancing up, smiled at his own
stern face in the mirror of steel that hung in his tent.</p>

<p>Men and money! Men and money&mdash;and treachery! Further into
the background of his thoughts receded those ancient days of peace
when at Moulins he had sat beside the two women talking of a future
that then seemed happy and assured.</p>

<p>He was a good soldier, a good general, forcing himself, forcing
his character and his inclination, going on doggedly with set teeth
and sweating brow, as a man does who refuses to give up a race
though he knows that he is straining his heart to cracking. Before
him rose the picture of the dead Medici, a man even younger than
himself; he could see that procession across the icy Mantuan
marshes with the snow coming down from the funereal sky and the
strong limb crushed, the skin and bone and blood and flesh
together.</p>

<p>"I too," he thought, "I too. There is no other end
possible."</p>

<p>He knew that he was undertaking more than he could do, more
indeed than any man could do with the means at his disposal. The
Emperor was still absorbed in holding the Empire against the Turk
and in patiently endeavouring to detach the different members of
the League of Cognac from one another; he seemed to have forgotten
his armies of mercenaries in Italy, who were now useless to
him.</p>

<p>With the death of Giovanni de' Medici, the Duke of Urbino
withdrew to protect Florence and made no further effort to impede
the bitter, tedious marches whereby Charles was stumbling on with
his broken columns towards Mantua.</p>

<p>At Pavia he waited, hoping that the Emperor might send some
money&mdash;but nothing came. From a wealthy prisoner, Charles
extracted as ransom twenty thousand crowns, which served to keep
his grumbling men quiet for a short time longer.</p>

<p>Before he left Pavia he was joined by another landless
adventurer&mdash;a tall young man with a lean, beautiful face and
frowning brows&mdash;Philibert de Châlon, Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>This young Prince had been assured the return of all his
dominions by the treaty of Madrid, and had, like the
Connétable himself, received nothing.</p>

<p>These two noble and landless captains set out from the park of
Mirabello, still ruined from the battle, through the icy weather
towards the camp of the Lutherans.</p>

<p>Charles told the Prince that it was said among the Spanish
soldiers that Georg Frundsberg bore at his saddle-bow a gold chain
with which to strangle the pope of Rome.</p>

<p>"So we bring the heretic into Italy!" smiled Charles.</p>

<p>"The Emperor hired Frundsberg, not you or I," replied Philibert.
"Let him answer to God for what he has done. What are we but his
poor paid captains?"</p>

<p>"Where shall we lead these <i>Landsknechte</i> if Urbino covers
Florence?" asked Charles. "And still the Emperor sends no
money?"</p>

<p>"We must take them to Rome. Let the Pope pay them."</p>

<p>"So Antonio de Leyva said. Rome! To lead these fanatic Lutherans
on Rome! We speak as men who have lost everything when we speak of
that."</p>

<p>Yet the thought remained in his mind as he led his ragged,
fever-bitten, sullen men towards the place where Frundsberg waited
with his fierce, unpaid mercenaries.</p>

<p>When, from the fallen yellow columns of the Palatine, he had
looked down on Rome, he had seen heavy breaches in those great
walls where wild flowers and ferns grew. What manner of garrison
would a man like Giulio de' Medici, Pope Clement VII, have in Rome?
The rich fantasy of the adventure attracted his weary, unhappy
mind.</p>

<p>"Why not make the Pope pay the Emperor's mercenaries?" he
smiled. "There must be treasure enough in the Vatican." He laughed
at himself. "Then perhaps I&mdash;at last&mdash;shall see
Raffaello's paintings and Michael Angelo's statues&mdash;and 'The
Laocoön'."</p>

<p>"I, too, should like to see Rome," said the Prince of Orange. "I
should like to dictate terms to the Medici, even if he is
Pope."</p>

<p>The wind blew across their thin faces and tossed their banners
into the winter air.</p>

<p class="first">
CHARLES felt himself pushed forward as by some powerful,
invisible hand. Everything he did seemed to be done without his own
volition; though he followed in his laborious days a stern routine,
he was always confused and baffled by this sense of being but a
pawn, moved by the impassive fingers of Destiny or Providence or
God, or whatever name man might give to fate.</p>

<p>The Imperial Captain-General in Italy, with his high-sounding
title and brilliant fame and manifold gifts such as most men would
have envied, felt himself to be like one subtly entangled in a net
which by his most frantic efforts he tries to escape, yet draws
more closely round him.</p>

<p>Looking back over his career it seemed to him as if he could
trace when, where, and how this net had been cast over him. He had
gone forward, like a man blindfold and doomed, ever since the day
he had ridden out of Chantelle with the King's archers at his
heels. He had been given impossible tasks, and even his successes
like the great fight of Pavia had been fruitless through the
treachery of others.</p>

<p>Now, on the plains of Italy, where the spring broke at last
through the long grey winter, he felt himself trapped and taken.
With every day he had sent dispatches to the Emperor for help,
money to pay the troops&mdash;ay, here was the old saying, "Men and
money, men and money, men and money and treachery". He had squeezed
every drop out of his last resources before he had left Milan. He
had marched to join Frundsberg with murmuring, sullen troops; and
there was the German with his ten thousand unpaid
mercenaries&mdash;who, fierce, lean, and ragged from their long,
tedious march across the Alps, waited now like so many starving
wolves for their reward. And he&mdash;Charles de Bourbon, the
Emperor's representative&mdash;had no reward to give them. He and
his officers and captains were stripped; he had no jewels to put on
his finger or breast or in his bosom; even the last savings of his
wife and his mother-in-law had gone to the money-lenders and the
bankers in Milan; even the gifts that the Emperor had given him in
Spain had all been sold.</p>

<p>He was so used to wealth and splendour that he found it
difficult to realize that he was not only a landless but a
penniless man, whose credit was worth nothing among the Jews of
Italy. The forty thousand ducats which he had scraped together to
bring his troops to the rendezvous with Frundsberg represented his
last effort.</p>

<p>He told Frundsberg as much, sitting in the tent no longer now
splendid and costly, but plain as that which covered any hired
captain-at-arms set up on the plains of Lombardy, where his troops
and the German mercenaries were camped.</p>

<p>Charles, a general of long experience and one used to handling
large bodies of men, knew what it cost not only to pay a soldier
but to feed and maintain him, his equipment, and his horse.</p>

<p>Georg Frundsberg felt himself betrayed. He had brought his men
through incredible perils on the promise of the Emperor, but now it
seemed that that promise was worth nothing. He stared, breathing
heavily, grasping his sword.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" repeated Bourbon, raising his fine hand and letting
it fall. "It is not the Emperor's fault that his word is worth
nothing. He cannot get the money&mdash;and as far as we command it,
Italy is drained."</p>

<p>Looking; at Frundsberg's terrible face, he added "I wrote a
final appeal to Charles V. I said, 'We are all ruined if you do not
send the money for which you have made yourself responsible. These
soldiers must be paid or they will mutiny.' I ended my letter to
the Emperor with these words, 'As for us, we can only place our
lives at your service.'"</p>

<p>"My men," muttered Frundsberg. "My men&mdash;never have I failed
them."</p>

<p>"I have not failed you, Prince. I have done impossible things to
get here and tell you this news myself. I evade nothing. I flinch
from nothing."</p>

<p>"Florence," said Frundsberg. "Let us march on Florence."</p>

<p>"Urbino guards it&mdash;he has everything."</p>

<p>Georg Frundsberg sat mute; his scarred, withered, magnificent
face hardened until it seemed as if it were cast in iron.</p>

<p>"So," he muttered, "the Emperor has betrayed me&mdash;me and my
men."</p>

<p>"When the Emperor engaged you he did not foresee Mohàcs, he did
not know that the Fuggers would not be able to advance him any more
money. We are all in the same position." Charles smiled slightly.
"Del Vasto&mdash;Captain-General of the Spanish Foot&mdash;is
entirely without means to pay his troops; the commander of my
vanguard&mdash;my light cavalry and my men-at-arms&mdash;is the
Prince of Orange, like myself, a landless, penniless
Prince&mdash;like myself, a mercenary."</p>

<p>Frundsberg rose, a gigantic figure in his scarlet and orange
undress.</p>

<p>"My men, my men, they trust me; as if I were their father they
look to me. I brought them over the Alps in winter&mdash;for
this&mdash;this."</p>

<p>"Some of them&mdash;the Lutherans&mdash;serve without pay for
religious zeal?" asked Charles, still smiling.</p>

<p>"Ay," replied Frundsberg simply. "But even those must be
fed."</p>

<p>Charles de Bourbon, with an ironic smile at himself and his
destiny, put his plans as clearly as he could. The army must march
down into central Italy as long as it would hold together without
pay; as long as promises would induce the men to proceed, proceed
they must.</p>

<p>"Ferrara," he added, "who hates the Pope, has promised us
provisions. Let us move on to San Giovanni to obtain this help.
Charles de Lanfloy, the Viceroy of Naples, is invading the Papal
States from the south&mdash;that may cause a diversion in our
favour."</p>

<p>"Can you see no further than that?"</p>

<p>"No." Charles paused in front of Frundsberg. "But&mdash;my life
on this&mdash;I will stay by you." He put his hand into the
gnarled, dry fingers of Frundsberg. "The air is dark and confused
with treacheries&mdash;from what I can learn François has
betrayed the Pope, who waits desperately and in vain for the
promised French aid; we are like men crossing a swamp in the dark.
But we can remain today&mdash;you, I, del Vasto, de Leyva."</p>

<p>"God help us, I pray the good God to help us," said the old
mercenary simply, "the captains and my men."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>As Charles de Bourbon and his motley army were marching towards
Ferrara, Clement VII, awaking to a sense of his danger from amidst
his austere and refined pleasures&mdash;laying aside for a moment
Michael Angelo's sketches, Giulio Romano's designs, and Cellini's
jewels secretly implored the Emperor for peace. The treaty of
Madrid was again offered to him. In a panic His Holiness accepted
these humiliating terms and signed the treaty, but repudiated it
immediately on hearing of the victory of the Cardinal Legate
Trivulzi over the Viceroy of Naples and Pompeo Colonna at
Frosinone; thus, by his complicated duplicities, treacheries,
treaties made secretly and secretly denied, treaties made openly
and openly repudiated, the Pope had contrived to isolate himself
from every possible friend and ally in Europe.</p>

<p>His need, too, was men&mdash;men and money&mdash;as he began to
see the shadow of the Imperial Eagles across the Vatican, as he
heard with increasing dread of the march of those bold heretics
across the Alps, across Italy, as near as Ferrara. On the other
side Rome was menaced by the Viceroy of Naples and the Spaniards,
while Clement mourned the loss of his best Captain, Giovanni de'
Medici; he was also dubious of the loyalty of those who surrounded
him; there was no one man whom he could trust. The King of France
sent him promises and nothing more, and, amusing himself with the
gay hunting-party in Champagne, forgot the troubles of Italy while
he indulged his own frivolous pleasures.</p>

<p>Clement neglected even the beautiful apartments where Giulio
Romano and his assistants worked on the designs of Raffaello; he
troubled himself no more about the grey Medici chapel in San
Lorenzo; the bathroom of Cardinal Bibbiena remained
closed&mdash;Venus tied her sandals in the dark; the workshop of
Cellini was unvisited.</p>

<p>Brooding and fuming in his closet, the Pope's slender figure was
curved over his desk; his almond eyes were narrowed with anxiety as
he patiently tried to combine some intrigue against his
enemies.</p>

<p>Towards Buda swept the infidel forces of Soliman the
Magnificent, across Germany spread the doctrines of Martin Luther.
In the corridor of the Vatican palace "The Laocoön" twisted in
agony, men and snakes together frigid in the marble that seemed to
writhe.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Though affairs seemed to go thus flourishingly for the Emperor,
Charles de Bourbon and his captains holding together their sullen
troops outside Ferrara did not see where they could gain any
advantage from the weaknesses and treacheries of their enemies.
They felt their difficulties to be more than those which mortal
could affront; it was as if the gods themselves were preparing to
take a hand in their overthrow.</p>

<p>Day by day the haggard captains consulted together, Bourbon,
Frundsberg, Orange, del Vasto, Frederico, Gonzaga. What was to
become of this vast army of brutal soldiers, many of them fanatic
heretics, unless they were given a definite goal at which to aim,
precise work with which to employ themselves? Not one of the
leaders could answer.</p>

<p>The help that the Duke of Ferrara sent, in money, provisions,
and ammunition, was soon exhausted, as Charles de Bourbon knew it
must be among so many hungry mouths, so many empty firearms and
pouchs, so much artillery gaping for food. When Ferrara could give
nothing more, the mercenaries marched forward into Italy.</p>

<p>The leaders themselves had no concrete design; they could but
march from day to day over the Southern plains, beginning now to
brighten and flourish with leaf and flower, and let their men live
on the daily pillage which barely sufficed their fierce needs.</p>

<p>When he had marched out of Milan with his destitute and
rebellious forces, Charles had not obeyed his own instinct or
judgment; he had done all that was possible for him to do in making
a juncture with the German mercenaries in the desperate hope that
the Emperor might send the money&mdash;some money, enough to keep
his army together.</p>

<p>Frundsberg had no plan; Orange was only a bold, skilful
adventurer. Whom were they to attack? Against what rich city were
they to direct their starving soldiers? It was impossible even to
think of advancing without money and without supplies.</p>

<p>The fair, pearl-like days of early spring clouded over and heavy
rain tell, turning the low-lying fields to mud and soaking the
roads beneath the twisted forms of olive trees and the black boughs
of cypress.</p>

<p>At the first halt Charles rode among his men, thirty thousand
veterans, grim and stern as the steel and iron they wore. Their
affection, their trust&mdash;these combined to form his last hope.
Frundsberg, too, was adored by his German Lutherans, but even when
they saw their beloved leaders ride among them, the troops were
sullen and murmuring. They demanded their pay, all the money that
was owing to them, and even those fanatic heretics who were willing
to serve without pay, as long as they might strike a blow at the
Pope, demanded food and clothing and ammunition, or leave to go
abroad on their own across Italy and obtain these necessaries for
themselves.</p>

<p>Charles, spurring his great bay warrior-horse, rode about among
the men, saying a word here and a word there, repeating again and
again his promises. He told them that his necessities were as great
as theirs, that he would die in want or make them all rich, that
they must have a little patience, for he had no intention of
defrauding them of the just payments for their services and their
suffering.</p>

<p>When they did not seem satisfied, even by these eloquent
appeals, he gathered together some of the leading officers,
Germans, Swiss, Spanish, Italian, took them into his ragged tent,
and showed them what he had left of personal possessions&mdash;a
few silver vessels, some rings and buttons, some furnishing stuff
and rich clothes. He had left Milan with very little of his
personal belongings, but some few jewels that took up but little
room he had kept in his bosom or his pocket or fastened to the back
of a glove. These now he offered, casting them down on the floor of
his tent.</p>

<p>"I will keep for myself," he said, "only the clothes I stand up
in, and that coat of silver cloth which I wear above my armour. It
is necessary that I should have this that you may distinguish me in
battle."</p>

<p>He stood unarmed before them, his hand on his hip, his sword and
straps on the rough iron bed where he slept, his helm with the
white plumes on the cloak that served for his pillow; Philibert of
Orange sat on the end of this bed mending carefully the lacing of
the leather jerkins he wore under his mail; Frundsberg, heroic in
stature, stood in the shadow of the tent.</p>

<p>"Take," said Charles, "all I possess. Once I had nearly a
kingdom&mdash;castles, cities&mdash;all lost. All in the hands of
my enemies, ay, even to the tombs of my wife and children. I care
little what becomes of this body of mine, which is all that I have
to lose. But I mean to remain with you, to serve the Emperor with
honour." He pointed to the small pile of valuables. "All else that
was left I sold to give you the forty-thousand ducats you had,
before you left Milan."</p>

<p>The men, gaunt, scarred, marks of old frost-bite and Alpine
winds on their flayed, unshaved faces, muttered together inside the
entrance flaps of the tent; then the spokesman, a Spanish captain
who had seen a hundred fights, said, stepping forward:</p>

<p>"Excellency, we will stay with you and fight for you, even
against the Devil himself. Only lead us soon somewhere where we can
help ourselves to our necessaries. And you shall not be ashamed of
us. We will not take a ducat of your property."</p>

<p>When they had left the tent, the Prince of Orange laughed
grimly.</p>

<p>"That is all very well. But can they keep their men quiet?"</p>

<p>Charles sighed. "Who knows? I am so weary. Yet how long it is
since I slept!"</p>

<p>Frundsberg said nothing; he had implicit trust in his men. His
courage, like his stature, was heroic. With the greatest possible
audacity, resource, and energy he had led his men, who, when they
started on their journey, had but a single ducat each, across the
Alps, down into an enemy country; he had contrived to support them
through every kind of peril and suffering, and to keep them
together with no more than the hope of a possible and distant
victory; and even now he remained resolute and tranquil.</p>

<p>Charles also stood silent. He could not imagine what the end of
this desperate enterprise might be; he recounted over to himself
his position: he had no scouts nor pioneers, no provisions, no
money, no ammunition&mdash;nothing but the spirit of resolution,
fortitude, and fanatic enthusiasm among his men.</p>

<p>And against whom, he asked himself, should he direct this
terrible, reckless power?</p>

<p>Antonio de Leyva, lean, dark-faced, energetic, broke into the
tent; news had come through from Charles de Lannoy, the Viceroy. It
appeared that the Pope and his allies fared no better than the
Imperialists. The Papal army in Apulia, receiving neither pay nor
provisions, had disbanded; the Viceroy of Naples had crossed the
frontier, invaded the Papal State, and had thrust forward to the
midst of the Volscian hills.</p>

<p>"So you see," said de Leyva with his dark smile, "there is no
one to check us if we march forward."</p>

<p>"Urbino?" asked Frundsberg, glancing up from the dispatches he
had taken.</p>

<p>Charles remarked that the Duke of Urbino, cold, hesitating, and
following out the selfish policy of Venice that was at bottom
hostile to the Pope, would make no attempt to prevent the advance
of the mercenaries. "Nor," he added, half cheating himself with his
own pretended hopes, "is the position of the Pope good in other
ways&mdash;he can wring no more money either out of the Treasury of
St. Peter or from the States of his native Florence, which have
already advanced him eight hundred thousand ducats since the
beginning of the war."</p>

<p>"My correspondent in Rome," remarked the Prince of Orange,
rising, "tells me that Clement is negotiating with the Emperor
through Cesare Ferramosta. Suppose Emperor and Pope should make a
treaty and leave us with this unpaid, starving army on our hands!"
He laughed, stretching his fine young limbs.</p>

<p>"Let us camp here, still in touch with Ferrara, until we hear
from de Lannoy," said Charles. He too laughed, but not with the
vigour and ardour of the other young man; the night wind which
penetrated the flaps of his tent seemed to him to blow from another
world.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>By the middle of March, Charles, still encamped near Ferrara,
learned definite news from Rome. Cesare Ferramosta, after long
negotiations, had induced the exasperated and timorous Medici Pope
to make a treaty with the Emperor, by which he was to pay six
thousand ducats for the payment of Bourbon's army, which was first
to be sent into Venetian territory and then gradually disbanded and
sent home.</p>

<p>"My God," cried Charles, "this on paper and I here with these
men!"</p>

<p>The thing seemed to him incredible. Did the Emperor know what
Ferramosta had undertaken in his name? Impossible, surely! Sixty
thousand ducats to satisfy these fierce, these desperate
mercenaries, who had come so far, who had suffered so much!</p>

<p>Charles felt an insensate fury against the treacherous
Medici&mdash;as if he would have liked to throttle him, the core of
all this mischief, with his own hands.</p>

<p>A treaty! Well enough on paper, but it meant nothing to the
mercenaries whom Charles was leading. Ferrara's hatred of the Pope
induced him to strain every nerve to give this powerful army oxen,
provisions, and ammunition, but sufficient money to satisfy the
troops he would not give. AS the delays continued, the fury of the
soldiery would flame higher&mdash;what then?</p>

<p>Charles hurled himself out of his tent and rode away between the
fields that stretched towards the red walls of Ferrara; groves of
twisted, grey-leaved olives sent their fragile shadows over the
first sprouts of the wheat and maize; the roads that traversed the
farms were deeply rutted from the chariots that had brought powder
and bullets to the camp of the mercenaries.</p>

<p>The sky was a pallid blue, half covered with a curdle of white
clouds. Charles looked upwards, savouring the loveliness with an
acrid pleasure.</p>

<p>There was a bitter satisfaction in losing everything, in being
stripped of all earthly encumbrances, in standing face to face with
supreme disaster. He glanced down at his lean, finely shaped hands
holding the reins loosely; he glanced about him on the spring
fields where another crop was swelling slowly to the harvest.</p>

<p>He thought of his long, laborious training, of the hard lessons
he had diligently learned, of his gifts of mind and body, of his
heritage&mdash;to what end, all this?</p>

<p>"That I may die at thirty-seven, trying to do an impossible
task?" He looked upwards again. "If only God would give some sign
to show what it all means!"</p>

<p>He rode back to the camp and perceived that the open mutiny that
had long been expected had broken out. As he hastened past the
picketed horses and the sullen sentries, del Vasto came riding
towards him and caught his reins.</p>

<p>"Do not go to your quarters&mdash;the Spaniards are storming
them&mdash;de Lurcy has been killed."</p>

<p>"Ah!" A sigh broke from the Connétable; he turned in his
saddle and looked towards his tent, where the Bourbon flag still
floated, white in the first abrupt fading of the day. "What can I
do?"</p>

<p>"Come to Frundsberg&mdash;his men are in an uproar too."</p>

<p>"Even those?"</p>

<p>"Ay, some talk has got about that a peace has been signed, and
that they are to be disbanded."</p>

<p>"It is true. I had news from Rome an Hour ago&mdash;the Pope
will offer sixty thousand ducats."</p>

<p>The two young men grinned at each other, and the Italian cursed
the Medici roundly. Drums were sounding about them, short cries in
several languages, the rasp of steel on steel; here and there a
spurt of flame from torch or lantern broke the blue gloom as the
brief twilight fell.</p>

<p>"De Lurcy!" said Charles. "How many people have been ruined for
me&mdash;all my poor gentlemen and servants!..."</p>

<p>"We must think of Frundsberg," replied del Vasto. "He and de
Leyva are facing them alone."</p>

<p>Forcing their way through a press of Swiss and Germans, the two
captains came to the quarters of Georg Frundsberg, Prince of
Mindelheim, whose great voice they heard rising hoarsely above a
clamour of desperate sound.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" cried Charles, striking out with his glove and
forcing his rearing charger forward. Plunging through the soldiery,
he took his place beside Georg Frundsberg, who sat his black horse
like a rock in front of his tent, above which fluttered his arms in
black and scarlet; the Marchese del Vasto swerved his white horse
the other side of the old General, and when faced by the three
leaders the men drew back a little.</p>

<p>Georg Frundsberg was bare-headed; his thick grey hair, dark with
sweat, clung to his purpling brow; the cords of his neck were
swollen above his steel gorget; his huge frame, encased in metal
and crimson velvet, sat heavily on his great saddle and powerful
iron-grey horse. Famous for the valour proved in a hundred fights,
of the best blood in Europe, used to deference, respect, and
obedience, the stern old Lutheran had never known his soldiery
refuse to listen to him; now he found that his words of reproach
and appeal floated unheard into the din. Hoarsely he begged his
soldiers, his children, to serve the Emperor faithfully, to wait
for the money that must surely be now upon its way.</p>

<p>Harsh cries answered him: "We have been sold to the Pope! To
Antichrist! We starve! We die! You have deceived us!"</p>

<p>Gaunt faces stared from the blotting shadows; scarred,
frost-bitten arms and hands from which fell filthy rags were thrust
upwards amid the spear-heads and halberds. All the cries mingled
into one wail of despair as the Swiss pressed forward round their
leader.</p>

<p>"Poor beasts!" whispered Charles, and he smiled slightly,
thinking of the Pope.</p>

<p>Georg Frundsberg was suddenly silent; the sweat rolled down his
face; he shuddered.</p>

<p>"Soldiers!" cried Charles, raising his Band. "Listen to your
leader! If you suffer, does he not suffer too?"</p>

<p>"He deceived us!" groaned the Lutherans.</p>

<p>"We have all been deceived!" shouted Charles. "The Spaniards are
pillaging my tents, they have killed my friend to what end?"</p>

<p>The words, which were spoken in German, were caught in a rolling
echo from the heaving press of men&mdash;"To what end&mdash;to what
end? How many months since we left our homes!"</p>

<p>Like the last sigh of a dying man the word "home" rose from the
mercenaries.</p>

<p>"I too!" cried Charles. "Exiled, penniless, ruined!"</p>

<p>"Soldiers," said Georg Frundsberg in a gurgling voice, "men,
children! Listen to me! Did I not lead you over the Alps? Have I
ever forsaken you? Have I ever betrayed you? I have made no treaty
with the infernal Medici, the accursed Antichrist&mdash;"</p>

<p>A roar of rage drowned his words; the soldiers pressed closer to
the three horsemen.</p>

<p>Del Vasto drew his sword.</p>

<p>"Before you tear me to pieces I shall kill some of you dirty
heretics, filthy German swine!" he cried, showing his white teeth
in his dark face. "Where is Leyva?" he added fiercely.</p>

<p>"Gone," whispered Frundsberg, "to help Prince Philibert with his
Spaniards. My voice&mdash;my heart&mdash;God help me!" He turned
his massive head towards Charles. "They will not listen to me, they
are not listening!" he sighed. He stared at the Frenchman and saw
that he, too, was speaking in tones of authority which were not
heeded.</p>

<p>"My troops, my men, mutinying, refusing to listen to me!"</p>

<p>His powerful, gnarled and twitching hands loosened upon the
reins, his eyes turned in his head, and his gigantic mailed figure
slipped sideways off the prancing frightened horse and crashed on
to del Vasto, then on to a drum that stood at the side of the
half-spoiled tent.</p>

<p>Charles seized the bridle of the rearing, riderless horse, while
he held in his own steed with the left hand.</p>

<p>"Ay, you have killed him! What good has that done you?"</p>

<p>Cries of fury and anger turned to exclamations of remorse and
grief. Georg Frundsberg was truly beloved by his soldiery; some of
them rushed forward and raised him. The old man had been stricken
by an apoplexy; his massive frame and his noble heart, which had
weathered the passage of the Alps and the long, perilous hardships
of the sojourn in Italy, were both broken by the disobedience of
his mercenaries.</p>

<p>"You can do nothing more," said Charles, dismounting and freeing
himself from the horses, which some of the men took. "Make a
litter, take him up and carry him into Ferrara."</p>

<p>Charles rode, through the cold blue night where the first faint
perfumes of spring sweetened the air, to the city behind the litter
in which the old man lay dying. Before the mind of the Frenchman
was the picture of Giovanni de' Medici being borne thus to
Mantua.</p>

<p>"Who next?"</p>

<p>He thought of the Swiss and Germans swarming round their leader,
shouting out reproaches and&mdash;"Money! Money! Money!" Upright on
his great horse in his gleaming armour the valiant and magnificent
old soldier, who had trained these men for so long and who had led
them through so many hardships and perils, and who had never lost
his hold on them, had spoken to them by the light of the stars and
the torches with an enthusiasm and a fury equal to their own, now
appealing to them as his children, now rebuking them as if they had
been angry dogs...</p>

<p>All in vain; he was now low enough and silent enough.</p>

<p>Charles recalled how, when the soldiers saw him, they had sent
up another cry of rage and scorn, expressing their wolfish fury
with these leaders who could neither pay nor feed them nor give
them the means with which to obtain money and provisions for
themselves.</p>

<p>"Frundsberg will die," mused Charles. "And what can I do for
these wretches?"</p>

<p>His own thought answered him: Rome&mdash;Rome&mdash;Rome!</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>That night Georg Frundsberg died, muttering nothing of God or
heaven or of the heresy to which he had pledged his life, but only
now and then thickly from his twisted lips: "My children, my
soldiers, they would not listen to me."</p>

<p>There was no one now who was in command of the German
mercenaries, but Charles, with the indifference of a man so
burdened that a little more added to his load is no matter, decided
to tell the German captains that he would henceforth be their
leader.</p>

<p>To the Duke of Ferrara, in whose palace Frundsberg died, he said
ironically: "What do you advise? You know my situation; you see
what I command!"</p>

<p>And Alfonso of Ferrara answered without a pause:</p>

<p>"Lead them against Florence or against Rome."</p>

<p>"You know what that will mean. Most of these Germans are fanatic
heretics."</p>

<p>"What does that matter," replied the Italian Prince, "if they
can be used to destroy that bastard who usurps the throne of St.
Peter?"</p>

<p>"I am a Christian," said Bourbon, more to himself than to the
Duke. "I am a son of Holy Church. Is it for me to lead these wolves
against Rome?" Then he added abruptly: "Give me some money, but
enough to give a ducat to each soldier, and I will lead them."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Ferrara keenly.</p>

<p>"The Emperor has abandoned us," replied Charles. "Since
Frundsberg is dead, the bargain with him is void. What are we then
but <i>banditti</i>? As <i>banditti</i> I shall lead them."</p>

<p>"I will give you thirty thousand ducats," said Ferrara, "if you
will take the men out of my Duchy&mdash;and lead them against
Florence or Rome."</p>

<p>Charles looked down on the linen sheet that covered the massive
rigid form of Georg Frundsberg, at the dinted armour and worn,
red-velvet garments piled on the chair beside the bed, on the
two-edged sword lying beside the dead man.</p>

<p>"Give me the money and I will do it."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>With this money, carried in bags by two of his French gentlemen
behind him, Charles went out on the morning after Frundsberg's
death and, calling together the captains of the mercenaries, he
offered them a ducat each for every man.</p>

<p>"And," said he, with his hands on his hips and his uncovered
head held high, "I will lead you either to Florence, which is one
of the richest cities in the world, or to Rome, which may be called
the pearl of Europe&mdash;and there you may obtain what will be
your arrears of pay, and more."</p>

<p>This pleased both the mercenaries who served for sheer pay and
the fanatics who served for nothing against the Church of Rome; for
they had all been shaken by the death of their beloved leader,
which they imputed to themselves as little better than a murder,
and repented that, after they had shared so many perils and
hardships with him, they should at the last leave mutinied and
broken his heart. So they accepted the terms of the Duke of
Bourbon, who appointed twelve captains of their own nationality to
look after their interests but to be under his orders.</p>

<p>Thus far had Charles organized his affairs when Cesare
Ferramosta, the Imperial Envoy, with a small train of Papal guards,
rode up in haste on a sweating horse with official news of the
treaty made by the Emperor with the Pope. He brought a copy of
this, which he showed to the Duke of Bourbon, and offered him sixty
thousand ducats, which was to cover all the expenses of the
mercenaries.</p>

<p>"Let them," said Ferramosta, still panting from his ride, "take
this money and disband, and each man get back as best he may to his
own home or country."</p>

<p>Bourbon laughed in Ferramosta's face. "Have you seen my army? Do
you realize that these men have been six months in the field with
no pay, that at least two hundred thousand crowns are due to them,
that they are half starved, in rags, without shoes? Do you
understand, Ferramosta, that besides what is due to the Germans, I
have five or six thousand Spanish troops who have received no pay
since they left Milan? Do you know what it means to feed this army,
the horses of the cavalry and the baggage wagons? Do you understand
that I have had to borrow heavily from the Duke of Ferrara? And you
come here with these terms&mdash;which are not new to us: at the
very rumour of them the men mutinied."</p>

<p>Charles expressed himself with a violence that was contrary to
his usual manner and, taking the Envoy by the arm, bid him turn his
horse's head and come with him to the camp itself&mdash;Charles had
met Ferramosta a furlong from the walls of Ferrara, as the Envoy
had, by his messenger, asked.</p>

<p>"I serve the Emperor," Charles said, "and I will try to support
you in getting this treaty accepted, but I warn you that you ask an
impossible thing."</p>

<p>There being no tent large enough for the purpose, all the
leaders and captains of the mercenaries were summoned on to a
little knoll that was surrounded by olive and ilex trees, and there
they listened to the treaty of the Emperor and the Pope, which was
read aloud by Cesare Ferramosta in a clear, high voice, sharp with
anxiety, for the ragged soldiers looked hostile and fierce.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Envoy concluded than Charles spurred his horse
forward and tried to enforce some arguments for the acceptance of
this tremendous sacrifice.</p>

<p>He told the captains, Spanish, German, and Italian, that he had
but four small pieces of cannon; that they would have to cross
desolate and arid country, which would not be able to supply them
with food; that both Florence and Rome were powerfully fortified
cities, and that he had only suggested marching against them in a
moment of desperation; that now here was help and hope&mdash;here
were sixty thousand crowns in good cash and promise of more.</p>

<p>"The Emperor has made peace," repeated Charles in that
singularly winning voice which he usually kept low, and which was
powerful and penetrating when raised. "Peace, I say. I am no
politician to tell you the rights and wrongs of it, but only his
Imperial Majesty's Captain-General&mdash;and now there is no war
and no army for me to lead. For myself I have nothing, not so much
as a word of thanks or a single ducat. I bid you to take all that
Cesare Ferramosta has brought and make your way as best you can
back to your peoples and your homes."</p>

<p>The reception of his frank appeal was what Charles had known it
would be. The captains with one accord refused to listen further;
each turned to gallop back to his men, hardly deigning to glue an
answer to proposals that seemed to them infamous.</p>

<p>"You see, it is too late," said Charles, smiling at Ferramosta,
"and as for you, if you value your life, you will take the swiftest
horse you can find. I believe Fernando Gonzaga will give you
one&mdash;that is his tent there, close to mine&mdash;and ride for
your life back to Rome! When the soldiers learn what their captains
have gone to tell them, you are not safe here, not for an
instant."</p>

<p>"But what shall I tell His Holiness?" asked the Ambassador,
clutching up his reins in a panic.</p>

<p>"Tell him to commend himself and his city to God, whom he
represents," smiled Charles de Bourbon, "for I think from man he
can get no more help. Rome! Rome! It is strange how long that word
has echoed in my heart, Ferramosta. Perhaps it was this that all
the time I dimly foresaw, not knowing what I foresaw."</p>

<p>"You mean," cried the Imperial Envoy, "you would march on Rome!
But His Majesty has signed a peace with the Pope! And the thing is
unthinkable! The pearl of Christendom! The gem of the Church to be
the prey of these starving hordes of ruffians!"</p>

<p>"I have been so netted in, circumvented, and betrayed," replied
Bourbon, "that I cannot behave like a free man. There are others
with me in a like case. We are doomed, marked down one by one.
Frundsberg died yesterday; he was an old man. There are del Vasto,
Orange&mdash;both young. De Leyva too, I never heard him complain.
Well, no doubt my time will come soon." He smiled wildly and waved
his gauntleted band towards Gonzaga's tent. "Make haste, I say,
make haste!"</p>

<p>Up the slope through the ilex and olive trees the captains were
returning with the straggling ranks of angry mercenaries at their
horses' heels.</p>

<p>As Cesare Ferramosta saw these he gave a short cry and turned
his horse's head.</p>

<p>"Leave the money you brought," smiled Charles, "and that will
cover your escape&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Envoy galloped towards his waiting retinue who, on a word
from him, threw down under the quivering ilex trees most of the
bags of ducats they had brought from Rome, and took to the high
road, where a cloud of dust soon enveloped them.</p>

<p>"Another two ducats each," thought Charles. "How many miles to
Rome? Can I do it?"</p>

<p>The captains came sweating up the knoll where the young Duke sat
bare-headed on his great bay, outlined against the mounting clouds
that overtopped the distant walls of Ferrara.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "what do you say? As for the Imperial Envoy, he
has gone."</p>

<p>"It is as well," replied the great blond Swabian captain, who
was the first to gain the ilex trees. "For our men meant to have
torn him limb from limb for bringing proposals so shameful and so
degrading. The Emperor makes peace, does he, when he has brought us
down here across the Alps into Italy without a white piece of pay,
with nothing but empty promises! And you, too, Prince, you too are
betrayed, as was Georg Frundsberg, now at Heaven's Gate."</p>

<p>"I have always been betrayed," replied Charles de Bourbon, "as
much by myself as by any Emperor, or by any God." He raised his
voice. "Soldiers, tell me now what you wish me to do!"</p>

<p>And from the ranks rose the one cry: "To Rome Florence! We
desire to march forward. To Rome! To Florence!"</p>

<p>In the dialects of Swabia and Franconia and the Tyrol, in the
accents of Italy and Spain, of Naples and Genoa, rose the words:
Rome! To Rome! Florence! Let the Medici pay!</p>

<p>"So be it," replied Charles. "Tomorrow we, who no longer have
any Emperor or, as I think, any God, will march onwards."</p>

<p>He put himself at the head of the men, who, quick to realize
that he could have fled with Ferramosta, shouted for him with a
zeal that he found oddly piteous.</p>

<p>To the Frenchmen with him he said:</p>

<p>"Take up the money left under the ilex trees. I shall divide it
among the men tonight, and tomorrow morning we shall strike
camp."</p>

<p>To himself he reasoned: "To keep trust with these poor devils,
with that dead old man, with Ferrara who paid me to leave, with
myself&mdash;not to falter, not to turn back..."</p>

<p>He returned to his camp and ordered two of his French gentlemen
to fashion a new flag out of one of his remaining sheets and to
write, in any ink they might find, his motto
<i>Espérance</i> across it. "That which I have is so
blackened and ragged." He stumbled with fatigue when he dismounted,
and turned aside, sickened, when he noticed, untouched amid the
slush, a knot of daisies growing by his unfurled tent.</p>

<p class="first">
HIS HOLINESS, Pope Clement VII, bitterly regretted the sixty
thousand ducats that he had been forced to send out to pay off
Charles de Bourbon's force.</p>

<p>How much better this sum of money, desperately scraped up from
an exhausted treasury could have been spent! It was exactly the
amount that the late Pope Leo X, his revered and beloved uncle, had
laid out every year on the rebuilding of St. Peters Church, while
Raffaello, for each of his famous rooms, had received only one
thousand two hundred ducats. The tapestries of gold and silver
tissue that adorned the corridors of the Vatican library, and that
were considered one of the wonders of the world, had cost only
fifty thousand ducats; the most exquisite lute-player in Europe had
been purchased by the title of Count and a castle, neither of which
was worth anything near sixty thousand ducats. One thousand five
hundred ducats had been paid for a narwhal's horn, a unique
treasure, while a thousand ducats had purchased the marvellous
clock and the superb musical instrument made by Conrad Trompa of
Nuremberg, which the Pope could never look at without the greatest
pleasure. Even the sum spent on Cardinal Bibbiena's bathroom had
been but a very small portion of sixty thousand ducats.</p>

<p>The Pope raised his elegant hands in disgust, almost in
despair.</p>

<p>How wretched to be civilized in an age of barbarism, to be
forced to give money to these brutal hordes merely in order to
purchase a measure of safety!</p>

<p>He thought with bitter hatred of the young Emperor, who was the
cause of this misfortune, and already began turning over in his
mind how he could do him some injury, although he had only just
signed a treaty of alliance with him; the Medici's restless wits
began once more to shift into a fresh combination all the different
policies of Europe, and he checked off on his long fingers Urbino,
Ferrara, Venice, Milan, France, England&mdash;rapidly calculating
how one could be combined with the others to his advantage.</p>

<p>Then, in order to soothe himself, both by an illusion of peace
and by the contemplation of the grandeur of his House, he went to
the grey mausoleum in San Lorenzo, where the two statues of
Giuliano and Lorenzo had lately been put into position, and stood
there musing awhile on the splendour of the House of Medici, until
his mind was once more arrogantly at ease and he was no longer
troubled by fear of barbarians, heretics, or infidels, or any of
the Kings or potentates of Europe, but satisfied with being
Clement, Pope of Rome and Head of Christendom. His mind turned on
his heiress, the little sharp-faced, dark-eyed child
Catherine&mdash;he might marry her to the Royal House of
France...</p>

<p>When the Pope returned to the Vatican these soothing dreams were
speedily dispelled; Cesare Ferramosta had returned from the
mercenaries' camp, and he brought with him the news of the
rejection of the Pope's offer; he had contrived to carry away from
the camp twenty thousand of the sixty thousand ducats. There they
were in bags, standing on the Pope's desk; he had again some of the
money that he so bitterly regretted and could spend it on ordering
more crystal flagons and figures of sardonyx and agate from
Benvenuto Cellini, or in paying some of Giuliano Romano's workmen,
who were finishing the Hall of Constantine.</p>

<p>But Clement felt no pleasure in the return of this portion of
his gold; he stood by his desk with the green marble top and stared
like a stricken man at the bags of money while he listened to
Ferramosta's quick patter of frightened words: "They will not take
it, they will not stop. They left Ferrara shortly after I did."</p>

<p>"Where are they going?" asked Clement with slant black eyes
downcast. "What is their goal?"</p>

<p>"Florence or Rome," panted Ferramosta, "Florence or Rome."</p>

<p>"Bourbon is leading them on Rome!" exclaimed the Pope.</p>

<p>"Ay, what else can he do? He is a man driven by his army, not
controlling it. He seemed to me a man giving reins to his destiny.
He has suffered. He will try for Florence&mdash;but Urbino guards
it."</p>

<p>"But I have made peace with the Emperor," stammered Clement. "I
have signed a treaty, and Bourbon knows it."</p>

<p>"What is the use of treaties, Holiness? Pieces of paper,
signatures in ink! There is a large horde there of half-starving,
fanatic men. I only just escaped with my life; had I not seized
young Gonzaga's horse and thrown down most of the money, they had
seized me and torn me limb from limb, for bringing such terms."</p>

<p>"The money," said the Pope, pointing to the bags on the green
marble desk, "do these wretches then despise money?"</p>

<p>"It is not enough, Holiness, it is not enough. It would not pay
them one half of what is owed them. Besides, after the hardships
they have undergone, and the promises that have been made them,
will they be content with their mere pay?"</p>

<p>"What more do they need?" asked Clement, blanching.</p>

<p>"They need a city to plunder."</p>

<p>"But Rome!" exclaimed the Pope, clasping his elegant hands.
"That Bourbon should even dare to think of it!"</p>

<p>"I heard the words," said Ferramosta, "even before I left the
camp. 'Rome!' they all cried. 'Rome Lead us to Rome!'"</p>

<p>For a second the tall Pope stood rigid in sheer terror, his
quick craftiness supplied his lack of courage.</p>

<p>"They will not find it so easy to get to Rome," he whispered
rapidly. "There are the Appenines to cross, the snow will still be
on the hills&mdash;many of them will perish with cold and hunger.
Yes, yes, there are no harvests yet, and the granaries will be
empty&mdash;they will starve."</p>

<p>"But many may survive to march on Rome."</p>

<p>"The Viceroy of Naples," the Pope hurried on, "he knows that I
have made a pact with his master. You have failed, but another may
succeed. I will send Charles de Lannoy to Bourbon, let him take the
treaty with him, let him insist on these men's being disbanded on
their withdrawal."</p>

<p>"Another sixty thousand ducats," said Ferramosta, with a
sneering look at the bags on the green marble, "will not be
sufficient now, Holiness. It must be at least a hundred and fifty
thousand. Forty thousand they have, as it were, stolen&mdash;that
has gone, yes, two hundred thousand are needed."</p>

<p>"I cannot raise them," sighed Clement. "There is not that amount
of ready money in Rome."</p>

<p>He put his beautiful hands on either side of his long face and
closed his handsome, dark, narrow eyes; he knew that had his credit
been better he might have raised the money with some of the bankers
in Rome, for instance the great House of Chigi, with their insolent
extravagance.</p>

<p>He had always hated the Chigi with their vulgar ostentation. He
had been present at the banquet they had given to Pope Leo X, when
after every course they had flung the gold and silver plate into
the pond in the garden; of course, it was all a trick&mdash;when
the guests had departed the servants, with nets, had fished up the
vessels again.</p>

<p>Then that display when they had led the Pope and his train into
a gorgeously furnished hall and, after he had expressed his
admiration of it, they had let down the tapestries from the rollers
and shown that this was but the stables.</p>

<p>Clement spitefully remembered those tricks&mdash;but why? He
must clear his mind; this was not the moment to be considering the
vulgarity of the Chigi, but only how he could raise money from
them. There were things he would not sell, he would not even
pledge&mdash;Benvenuto Cellini's jewels, some of the pictures and
statuary, some of his tapestries, the Raffaello drawings and
cartoons, the picture of <i>The Transfiguration</i> that stood by
Raffaello's deathbed, "The Laocoön"; no, there must be some
other way!</p>

<p>"Florence," he said, opening his eyes and looking at Ferramosta,
who stood with his arms folded on his breast staring down at him;
"we will try Florence. I know the man to send and he will start
today. I must raise a loan there, even if I pledge the vessels of
Holy Church."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>When forced to action Clement was a good business man, quick and
punctual in his affairs, and that evening one of his stewards, with
a handsome train, fared from Rome to Florence to raise a loan of at
least a hundred thousand ducats to be sent at once to the Imperial
and Holy City. When he thought over his position Clement found
another hope besides that of bribing Bourbon's army to disband;
Florence was nearly as rich, nearly as famous as Rome, and though
it was his native city he hoped that the mercenaries might be
diverted by this rich prize in their way, and, if they must sack a
city, might plunder Florence instead of Rome.</p>

<p>Clement did not share his uncle Leo's love for the Florentines,
who, because they considered him a bastard, had often treated him
with disrespect and even insults; and his fine lips curled
unpleasantly as he thought of the barbarian hordes let loose upon
the wealthy and insolent Florentine burghers, upon those
purse-proud bankers who had so often refused him a loan or had
granted him one only at a ridiculously high rate of interest.</p>

<p>Charles de Lannoy, the Viceroy of Naples, and a trusted servant
of the Emperor, was soon at the Vatican and accepted the mission of
going to Bourbon's army and endeavouring to get him to respect the
treaty and accept the Pope's offer of a large sum of money, a
hundred and fifty thousand ducats at least.</p>

<p>Charles de Lannoy had not set out on his difficult mission
before the Deputies of Florence arrived with the hundred thousand
ducats in gold. The bankers had advanced this sum without much
difficulty, partly because the interest offered was high and the
securities no other than the gold and silver plate of St. Peter's,
and partly because they too wished to see this savage and fanatic
army disbanded before it was at their own city gates.</p>

<p>On Easter Day the Viceroy of Naples joined the Connétable
of Bourbon between Arezzo and Montevarchi, where the mercenaries,
further exasperated and exhausted by the miseries of crossing the
Apennines on empty stomachs and empty pockets through the last
severity of the late spring, were in camp. Charles de Lannoy had
always been jealous of Bourbon, and the two men had now less than
ever in common. Bourbon received the Viceroy grimly, with a scant
courtesy. On him, Bourbon alone, rested the entire responsibility
of this vast army of desperate and implacable men.</p>

<p>He told de Lannoy that, for himself, he was willing to respect
the treaty, but his first duty lay now not with the Emperor but
with his men, and that a larger sum of money than either Florence
or Rome could provide would be necessary to turn them from their
dream of receiving as their reward and prize and payment one of the
great cities of Italy, which in their minds were of almost fabulous
wealth and luxury.</p>

<p>De Lannoy found the Frenchman much changed since he had last
seen him outside Pavia; his powerful figure was gaunt, his nobly
shaped face lean to emaciation, but he still preserved a severe
elegance; he was carefully shaved, his hair cut straight across his
brow and on to his shoulders, his hands white and even, rubbed with
aromatics, but de Lannoy noticed that his clothes were simple, worn
and mended, that he did not wear a single jewel, that his soft
riding-boots were patched and his spurs of iron.</p>

<p>"Tell Ferramosta," said Bourbon grimly, "that he was stupid to
cheat me of twenty thousand ducats. I had promised my men two
ducats each and the sum was short."</p>

<p>"Ferramosta serves the Pope," replied de Lannoy, "as you and I,
monseigneur, serve the Emperor."</p>

<p>"The Pope! The Emperor! What have I to do with either? I serve
necessity."</p>

<p>"You cannot take Florence," declared the Viceroy brusquely. "It
is madness to think of Rome&mdash;impossible."</p>

<p>"Do not use that word to me," smiled Charles sternly. He
unrolled from his pocket a rough map that he had made himself. "See
where Frundsberg brought these men from, across the Tyrol to
Brescia&mdash;see where I led my starving garrison from Milan to
Mantua&mdash;then to where the Este helped us at Ferrara&mdash;see
where we are now, at Arezzo not so far from Florence, eh? Siena has
promised provisions&mdash;when I have left that Republic I shall be
in Umbria, the Patrimony of St. Peter&mdash;Viterbo&mdash;Cività
Castellana&mdash;Rome."</p>

<p>"You would not dare&mdash;such an outrage would amaze all
Christendom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Consider who I am, de Lannoy, and my position. What can daunt a
man who has lost everything save the trust of a few thousand
wretches, who look to him as their sole hope?"</p>

<p>"Ah, those vile wretches!" exclaimed de Lannoy disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Ay, vile enough, no doubt, but not viler than the Medici in
Rome, or the Valois in Paris. Return to the Pope de Lannoy, and
tell him that I demand immediately one hundred and fifty thousand
ducats in gold. Let it be sent to the walls of Siena, where I shall
encamp."</p>

<p>"You will, then, advance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I find Florence too well defended to attack."</p>

<p>"You put yourself in the position of a bandit," said de Lannoy.
"I hear that del Vasto does not follow you, nor de Leyva."</p>

<p>"No. I miss them," said Charles simply. "They returned to
Ferrara&mdash;knowing that I have no commands from the Emperor for
what I do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will have to answer to God and man for what you do."</p>

<p>"Ay, and for man I have my answer. As for God&mdash;let Him
answer me some questions."</p>

<p>As Charles de Lannoy rode away from the camp he heard the hoarse
voices of the Germans rising in Lutheran hymns.</p>

<p>Charles sat alone in his camp, gazing at his map, measuring off,
in his mind, the miles&mdash;Arezzo, Florence, Siena, Viterbo,
Civita Castellana&mdash;Rome.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Without waiting for a reply from Clement, Charles de Bourbon led
his mercenaries through the valley of the Arno towards Florence,
but when they were at San Giovanni, thirty miles from the Tuscan
capital, the light Spanish horse that acted as scouts brought news
back to the main body that two armies were converging on Florence:
one, that of the League commanded by the Genoese Marchese di
Saluces and, the other, that of Venice commanded by the Duke of
Urbino.</p>

<p>The Connétable, upon this news, called together his
captains, among whom was only one man of rank or importance,
Philibert de Châlon, Prince of Orange. He laconically pointed out
to them that it was useless to think of attacking Florence, now
protected by two powerful forces; only one possible prize now
remained for them, distant, glittering, perhaps
unattainable&mdash;Rome.</p>

<p>He told them that their one chance of success lay in the
rapidity of their movements; if, by a series of forced marches,
they could reach Rome before it was able to be put in a state of
defence, it was possible they might take it by assault; and he
suggested that they went to Siena, which had, by messengers lately
sent, promised the Imperial troops provisions.</p>

<p>The loud acclamations of the men, as the Connétable's
words were passed from rank to rank, buzzed in his ears; he smiled
at the Prince of Orange, who sat his white horse beside him.</p>

<p>"I have always wanted," he said, "to see Rome&mdash;the new
Church of St. Peter, the rooms painted by Raffaello and the group
of 'The Laocoön', of which King François has but a poor
copy. I have been to Rome, but I did not see these wonders."</p>

<p>"You have been to Rome?"</p>

<p>"Ay, when the King of France went to Bologna. I remember the
ruins. Raffaello then was the inspector of the ancient buildings
and had done much to preserve them. I found a hermit who was living
like that Calvo who translated Vitruvius for Raffaello. These
trifles come into my mind&mdash;I think I am a little broken,
though I still contrive to use my body and my mind."</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange glanced at him sharply. He was lean, his
cheeks sunken, his eyes shadowed; he had the air of a man stricken
by fever; he smiled sideways at his companion.</p>

<p>"The emperor knows what we shall have to do; like all these
great ones, he makes use of us. Do you suppose he was displeased
when the Colonna raided the quarters of the Vatican? We are but
pawns, my Prince, you and I, high-placed as we think ourselves.</p>

<p>"Ay," replied Philibert de Châlon, looking back over his
shoulder at the ragged hordes behind him, tramping on in disordered
columns, starving, ferocious, and implacable. "But whose pawns? Is
it God's hands or those of the Emperor that move us from one place
to another?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps when we are dead we shall know," replied Charles, "or
will that be but a dreamless sleep? If I could be rid of dreams,
Prince, I should be much easier in my waking hours. I have thought
so often of late that I was in the Abbey Church of Sauvigny, where
I think I shall never lie. I ride," he added, "every day nearer to
my father's and my brother's tombs in Naples. Where do one's dreams
go when one dies?"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>But though Charles was often light-headed with fever and from
dreams, he manoeuvred his terrible army with great skill and
precision.</p>

<p>The weather began to be hot and the plains of central Italy
between Umbria and the marshes of the Maremma were laden with
malarious mists; when the soldiers had struggled through these
swamps they encountered barren plains, but always they pressed on
with indomitable resolution, fortified by the sight of that leader
riding ahead, his sole possession the silver corslet, following the
ragged white banner on which was his self-chosen ironic
device&mdash;"By the sword alone."</p>

<p>When the rapid river, the Paglia, seemed to check their
progress, Charles had at once a device to ford it. He ordered his
foot-soldiers to arrange themselves in ranks of thirty or forty
abreast, and so with their arms interlaced, to wade across at the
moment that the cavalry, taking the ford a little higher, brake the
force of the current; even so, the water was so deep that it came
up to the chins even of the tallest men. They had been instructed
that, if one of them weakened and lost his foothold, the others
were to let him go, for further down the stream were stationed
Germans of special strength and stature whose duty was to snatch
their fellows as they drifted down the current.</p>

<p>The Pope had counted much on the River Paglia's stopping the
progress of the mercenaries, who were, as he knew, without boats
with which to make pontoons or any other devices whereby they might
cross a current swollen by the spring rains; and when he heard that
they had without any considerable loss got, as it were by a
miracle, across the river and had advanced on the little hill
towns&mdash;Montifiascone, Ronciglione&mdash;which they had sacked
without mercy after provisions had been refused, filling themselves
with food and wine, he began to shudder and tremble.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Partly from native duplicity, partly because he had in the hour
of his peril lost his head, Clement had signed another treaty with
the Holy League in the presence of the English Ambassador, his
object being to obtain money; he had demanded thirty thousand
ducats, to be paid monthly, from the King of France and the State
of Venice, fifteen thousand ducats and three thousand five hundred
foot-soldiers from the King of England, and stipulated that these
combined armies and these large sums of money should at once be
sent to protect him from the barbarian hordes of the Emperor. In
return for these benefits, and, as he believed, the security of
Rome, he had vowed that he would excommunicate Charles V and take
from him the kingdom of Naples.</p>

<p>When he had made this treaty the Pope felt a little ease of mind
and even had again begun to take pleasure in his buildings, his
tapestry, his statuary, and the workshop of Benvenuto Cellini; but
when he heard that Charles de Bourbon had crossed the Paglia he
became again oppressed by a sense of doom. How was it possible for
the men and money from Venice, France, and England to arrive in
time to save him from these ruffian mercenaries?</p>

<p>Clement could neither eat nor sleep for anxiety, and paced his
brilliant galleries restlessly, taking no interest in the workmen
who hurried to and fro with plaster, pricked cartoons, and pots of
colours to complete their work in the Hall of Constantine.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>On the second day of May, a footsore, sweating rustic came
running in from Viterbo bringing letters from the Commandant of
that town to say that the Imperial light cavalry, under Scianna
Colonna, were under the walls; the main body under Bourbon and
Orange were at Montifiascone and Ronciglione.</p>

<p>"Under the walls of Viterbo!" exclaimed the Pope, shrinking into
his silken garments, his face becoming the colour of one of his own
scented wax candles. Too late, then, his treaty with England and
France, his return to the Holy League!</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Clement sent for the most trustworthy captain he had in Rome,
Renzo da Ceri, and asked him to raise what force he could for the
defence of the city. Ceri, who was an able and experienced man, but
who yet scarcely believed that Bourbon would dare to attack Rome,
got together a garrison, composed partly of disbanded soldiers,
partly of clerks and shopmen, partly of the servants of the
Cardinals and the nobility, from pages to stable-boys.</p>

<p>These, who were neither disciplined nor trained, nor in many
cases armed, were placed in defence of the walls of the Borgo and
Trastevere; some of these fortifications were entirely neglected
and even crumbling to pieces, and the first task of the hastily
raised soldiery was to repair them and place some guns upon them.
The immediate pay of these men amounted to a thousand crowns, and
that, the Pope had not got, as he had already dissipated the
Florentine loan; after having pledged all the silver vessels,
chains, jewels, and rings in his personal possession, he fell back
on his last resource and made five new Cardinals at the price of
forty thousand ducats each.</p>

<p>Yet, even while he took these desperate precautions, the Pope
scarcely believed that Bourbon would dare to attack the Holy City.
He sent for the Marchesa d'Este, one of whose sons was in Bourbon's
army and the other of whom had been one of the purchasers of a
Cardinal's hat so lately set up for sale, and questioned her
anxiously as to what manner of man the Connétable, Duc de
Bourbon, might be&mdash;he was the son of her sister, Chiara di
Gonzaga...</p>

<p>The cool and clever lady answered adroitly that she had always
known her nephew to be a loyal, grave, handsome, and accomplished
cavalier, and that she had herself sent a messenger to him asking
him if he took Rome to spare her house, and that he had replied
promising to do so and telling her to provision and fortify her
palace. She added, with a flicker of contempt for Clement's panic
fear:</p>

<p>"While my nephew is in command of the Imperial forces, Your
Holiness need fear no outrage. While he lives he will be able to
control and restrain his troops, though I do not doubt it will take
the last ducat in your Treasury to be rid of them."</p>

<p>"I met him at Bologna," said Clement. "But I do not recall him
very well. He said very little&mdash;I observed a great jealousy
that King François had for him because of Marignato&mdash;a
good general. Ah, well, be has no cause to hate me."</p>

<p>"No cause, Holiness?" rebated the Marchesa. "Did you not absolve
King François from the oath he took to restore all to my
nephew Charles? But be assured he will not act from petty
motives."</p>

<p>Renzo da Ceri broke in upon the audience of the Marchesa to
declare bluntly that three thousand untrained men and a few
thousand ducats were not sufficient to put Rome in a state of
defence.</p>

<p>"You must do what you can," stammered the Pope. "Surely, surely
it is impossible that these ruffians will dare to march on
Rome."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," replied da Ceri shortly, "for me to defend
the city with a handful of scullions and stable-boys. The walls are
in a state of disrepair&mdash;in some places broken&mdash;the
breaches made by Pompeo Colonna have not been mended."</p>

<p>"Do what you can," repeated the Pope nervously, shrinking back
from the stern, angry soldier, who lifted his shoulders scornfully
and turned away on his difficult business.</p>

<p>"He knows his work," said Clement with a sigh. "He distinguished
himself at the siege of Marseilles&mdash;a capable man, everything
is safe in his hands."</p>

<p>"Even a capable man can do little without material," said the
Marchesa Isabella, waving her plume of ostrich feathers; "for my
part I am glad that the Duc de Bourbon is my sister's son. I have
taken his advice to fortify my house."</p>

<p>Clement gave the bright lady a disagreeable look.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, madame, you may be thankful for this threat to
Rome&mdash;only such a need of money would have forced me to give
your son a Cardinal's hat."</p>

<p>When the Marchesa had left him, the Pope, alone in his gorgeous
closet, turned over shrewdly and anxiously in his mind the chances
of the mercenaries' reaching Rome.</p>

<p>It was disturbing to know that they had crossed the Paglia been
supplied by Siena, sacked Ronciglione and Montifiascone, and were
under the walls of Viterbo&mdash;ay, since the first day of May the
had been in Papal territory and their rate of march was sixteen to
twenty miles a day&mdash;disturbing and incredible, all this. The
news from Florence was ugly too; the citizens, angry at the threat
of the mercenaries and blaming the Pope for their peril, had risen
in revolt against the House of Medici, and the young Ippolito de
Medici had left the city to join the Duke of Urbino.</p>

<p>Clement sighed: what a chance was lost! If only Bourbon could
have paid his troops by sacking ungrateful, rebellious
Florence&mdash;how unfortunate that the junction of the armies of
Urbino and Salutes should have forced Bourbon to turn towards
Rome.</p>

<p>But it was unthinkable!</p>

<p>Bourbon would not dare; his master the Emperor would not dare;
even the mercenaries themselves would not dare&mdash;no, de Lannoy
had said they wanted one hundred and fifty thousand ducats, and
that had been promised by Florentine bankers; it ought to arrive
before Bourbon reached San Giovanni, two days' march from Rome. The
mind of Giulio de' Medici could not long remain fixed on unpleasant
matters; he opened his beautiful, dark eyes with their cold,
unpleasant expression and looked round the magnificence of his
cabinet&mdash;the walls painted with brilliant figures; the
furniture of carved sweet-chestnut wood inlaid with mother of
pearl, the purple marble bust of a Caesar; the desk of green stone
and twisted gilding; the cushions of crushed Genoese and Venetian
velvet, the colours of peaches and grapes, with heavy bullion
fringes; the bowls of transparent alabaster filled with buckles and
brooches of pearl, emerald and turkis, wrought by Cellini. Clement
sighed and looked down at his own fine garments, his own perfumed
hands on which clustered the fires of costly diamonds; he thought
of "The Laocoön", the Venus tying her sandal, the cupidons
driving butterflies and snails in the bathroom of Cardinal Bibbiena,
of the glories of the Hall of Constantine, where Guilio Romano
worked with his pupils on the designs of Raffaello&mdash;surely all
this splendour, this beauty, was sacred, inviolate; no one would
dare...</p>

<p>The Pope went into the <i>loggia</i>, which was hung with the
first cascades of roses, damask and musk, crimson and white, and
set with terra-cotta vases, in which grew laurel, bay, and myrtle
trees; in between the glossy green of these sharp clusters of
leaves stood antique statues, rescued by the care of Raffaello and
Calvo from the vineyards and meadows of the Campagna Romana; the
mellow spring sun cast a golden hue over their rounded, still
earth-stained limbs and filled their hollow eyes and the curves of
their smiling lips with light.</p>

<p>The Pope sank into a low seat filled with violet silk cushions
and commanded a concert of music from the little page who always
followed him.</p>

<p>The players came in their Medici liveries, with their
instruments of gleaming, pale wood, lutes, flutes, violins, and a
little portable organ with golden pipes; seating themselves on gilt
stools in the blue shade of the <i>loggia</i>, they began to play
the overture to a comedy that was one of Clement's favourite
pieces.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the music, the Pope's fears vanished; the
antique statues, the roses, damask and musk, the sunlight falling
between the delicate pillars, the slim figures and fine dark faces
of the musicians, all of whom had been selected for their
comeliness, the plump grace of the little page who waited his
master's orders&mdash;all made a harmony delicious to Giulio de'
Medici.</p>

<p>"The only thing that is needed here," he mused, "is
water&mdash;falling water, yes, the sound and sight of that is
required. Cellini must design me a fountain. I shall grow
iris&mdash;white and yellow striped. I think I shall have it
between the two nymphs that Calvo found on the Janiculum."</p>

<p>Sixteen, twenty miles a day, Charles de Bourbon pressed on
towards Rome; he was very much alone amid his thirty thousand men.
Philibert of Orange was the only man of rank on whom he had to
rely; a fine man, a good soldier, a superb general, this young
Prince, but to Charles almost a stranger&mdash;at least, neither
kin nor friend, though now, perforce, a confidant.</p>

<p>"You are the second-in-command," he said.</p>

<p>"If I fall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not be able to control them," interrupted the Prince of
Orange. "They hardly know me. You are the Emperor's General in
Italy&mdash;while you live they are the Imperial army."</p>

<p>These words were echoed in the heart of the
Connétable.</p>

<p>"While I live," he thought, "I can control them." But if he did
not live? If he died as the Medici and Frundsberg had died?</p>

<p>"If I do not live?" He smiled at the other Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Then this army will be a rabble whom none can lead, master, or
control."</p>

<p>"The Emperor?" said Charles. "By now he knows what we
do&mdash;yet he gives no Sign. If I fail he will deny me&mdash;if I
succeed he will have the benefit. Yet I liked him. He, too, is not
master of his actions. You noticed that de Lannoy did nothing to
persuade the troops to accept the Pope's money, nothing to stay our
march&mdash;does he know t the Emperor's mind, or was he afraid of
the men?"</p>

<p>"Something of both, my Prince: he knows or guesses that the
Emperor will be pleased to see the Medici Pope humbled to the dust;
he had no wish to face the men."</p>

<p>Onward, still onward, under skies now clear and blue as a
hyacinth bell, over roads white with dust and by fields rich with
promise of harvest; when Charles looked back at those ragged,
obstinate, implacable columns, he marvelled how the thing had been
done&mdash;first by Frundsberg, then by himself&mdash;six months of
keeping these hordes together, by false promises, by food and
ducats begged or borrowed from Ferrara, from Siena; by sacking
those little hill towns, by sacrificing everything down to one's
finger-ring.</p>

<p>Then the garrison he had brought from Milan&mdash;how had they
survived?&mdash;those forced marches across the wintry swamps to
Mantua; the junction, at last, with Frundsberg; then this tramp
down Italy again...Charles did not know how many men Frundsberg had
lost; five thousand German and Swiss corpses at least must have
been left to litter the high passes of the Alps, the slopes into
Lombardy, the Duchy of Mantua; of his own men, a thousand had
perished of disease, of wounds received in skirmishes, of fatigue,
since he had led them from Milan.</p>

<p>The survivors were bent, scarred, ragged, frightful to see with
their weather-bitten faces blotched with sores, their filthy beards
and matted hair, their clothes knotted together with strips of
leather, with straw round their feet, some with the sandals of
murdered peasants, some with the brown robes of monks slit into
mantles, some with frayed rope for girdles, others with their legs
bound with linen stolen from the altars of wayside chapels...how
harshly the rough dialects of Franconia, Swabia, and the Tyrol
struck upon the delicate ear of Charles, how uncouth were the rude
hymns that the heretics howled out at night as they shared the
day's bloody plunder! Charles sickened when he thought of the hill
towns&mdash;left with their dead among the ashes; he winced at the
bodies of murdered men and women left along his line of march; he
could not save even the children&mdash;like a huge, foul beast
whose breath slays all it touches his army sprawled along the road
to Rome.</p>

<p>Charles ate little and slept little; he washed frequently; at
every stream, pool, or wayside freshet he paused to bathe his face
and hands; every night his French gentlemen shaved him and dressed
his long hair; when there were but two shirts left in his baggage
the Frenchmen washed these every day, so that he always went in
clean linen under his silver corslet. He was glad that Suzanne was
richly clad in her tomb; he had himself clasped the pearls round
her throat, the emeralds round her waist&mdash;laid the daisies of
silver in her empty hands.</p>

<p>His bay horse died; a Franconian gave him a white steed that had
been stolen from a villa outside Ferrara.</p>

<p>"It is well that it is not cold," smiled Charles, "since I have
no cloak."</p>

<p>He thought of all that he had once possessed; mantles of ermine,
vair, and purple velvet, of taffetas and sable, of satin and
brocade&mdash;no doubt Louise of Savoy had some of them now in her
wardrobe.</p>

<p>With the Prince of Orange and the captains who represented the
mercenaries, he made his plans: they would take the city by assault
and dictate terms to the Medici in the Vatican&mdash;not forty
thousand ducats now, nor two hundred and fifty thousand, but every
white piece that there was in Rome&mdash;no pay now, but prizes to
gorging for every desperate devil.</p>

<p>"Europe will stare when we take Rome," said the Prince of
Orange. "It will be a feat of arms unequaled. I would rather share
in this than have my estates again."</p>

<p>The air blew warm and sweet, the acacia trees strewed blossoms
on their way, the grasses grew tall for their horses, there were
bread and wine, meat and fowls, at every deserted villa, house, and
farm that they passed. The Lutherans overturned the wayside
crucifixes and polluted the wayside shrines, the Spaniards laughed
and told them that they would roast in hell for sacrilege.</p>

<p>On to thirty miles from Rome, past that&mdash;nothing from the
Emperor, nothing from the Pope.</p>

<p>Charles felt light-headed, his bones ached and his flesh
shuddered; he breathed in the pure air as a thirsty beast laps
water, and it brought him no ease; his armour galled and he was
weary of the saddle.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the fifth day of May, after four days' march through
Papal territory, Charles de Bourbon brought his mercenaries out on
to the height of Monte Mario; again the worn, lean man in the
silver corslet on the white horse looked down upon Rome, that he
had last seen twelve years ago when in his black-and-violet gown he
had mounted the Palatine and gazed upon the city that he now saw
spread before him in the sweet light of a spring day.</p>

<p>"Did not the Medici say," he asked of the Prince of Orange,
"that when he made war, we should hear the trumpets at Rome? Let us
sound them."</p>

<p>The orders were given and from the heights of Monte Mario the
ragged trumpeters sent their challenging blasts over the city.</p>

<p>Charles rode ahead of his troop and looked down at Rome.</p>

<p>Into the still, gold air rose those domes and bell-towers, those
magnificent palaces towering above the shadows of the narrow
streets; the Pantheon, the Coliseum, the sharp, dark lines of the
cypress trees, the grey leaves of oak and ilex and olive&mdash;all
as he remembered.</p>

<p>He leaned forward eagerly, trying to trace the line of the
rapid, yellow river now hidden by the outlines of the heavy houses
either side; he tried to trace the square where had been the house
of the old doctor, beside the inn named "The Triumphal Crown,"
where he had looked into the polished mirror and dreamed his
dream.</p>

<p>With his gauntleted hand shading his tired eyes from the level
rays of the sun, Charles stared down; he heard all around him the
rising murmurs from his ragged host, as they saw at length before
them the incredible reward of incredible toils and pain, of bitter
miseries, of hideous privation.</p>

<p>Rome! The golden pearl! The emerald jewel! Crown of
Christendom!</p>

<p>Once more, and after centuries, the barbarians were before Rome.
By a solemn impulse of deep fervour, the Lutheran ranks of heretic
Germany broke into a deep-throated hymn as they beheld below them
and, as they supposed, at their mercy, the city of abomination,
Babylon, the home of the Scarlet Woman.</p>

<p>With this hymn swelling up behind him, the sound of the bells of
Rome floating across the breeze in front of him, Charles thought of
the Pope with loathing and contempt, without a sparkle of pity or
compassion. It was this false, bastard Medici who had persuaded
François to break the treaty of Madrid, which would have
restored to him, Charles de Bourbon, his honours and possessions.
It was through this Pope of Rome that he now stood here a landless
leader of mercenaries; he intended to treat the Pontiff with
scornful severity and to force him to bring out of the Vatican
treasures every ducat that his troops demanded.</p>

<p>"And for myself," he thought, dreaming of success, "what shall I
have? I believe that I shall demand, for my new Duchy of Milan,
even that group of 'The Laocoön'."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>That night he laid his plans with the Prince of Orange and his
other captains. The city was to be taken by assault. The first
attack was to be made at the Borgo, where the ramparts were lower,
and the Connétable chose for this task three parties of
different nationalities&mdash;Spanish, German, and Italian&mdash;in
order that they might be stimulated by rivalry. At the same time
there was to be an attack on the walls of Trastevere; then the
three bridges across the Tiber, from which the Popes obtained their
name of Pontiff, were to be destroyed, and if these plans succeeded
the Imperial troops would find themselves in the centre of the
city&mdash;the Forum, the Capitol, the Palatine, and the Quirinal.
If these three separate assaults, which would have to be desperate
and magnificent, were successful, the Imperialists would find
themselves masters of Rome.</p>

<p>After he had worked his plans out with his captains to the least
detail, the Connétable led his men from Monte Mario across
the meadows towards the Vatican hill, near the quarters of the
Borgo and Trastevere.</p>

<p>He decided not to make the assault that night, but to give his
exhausted men a few hours' rest; he also wished once more to ride
among them, to raise their courage and ardour to the highest pitch,
by reminding them of their long hardships, of the pay due to them,
of the riches before them in Rome. As he rode in his silver corslet
from rank to rank, he could see, every time he turned his tired
eyes towards Rome, the outline of the Imperial City darkening
against the green pallor of the sunset sky, against which the dark
mass of Hadrian's tomb rose grim and formidable.</p>

<p>Charles exerted himself to raise his voice loudly,
clearly&mdash;he spoke in German, Spanish, Italian, repeating his
sentences as he rode among the expectant men.</p>

<p>"Your sufferings have been hideous! Hundreds of thousands of
crowns are due to you! The Emperor offers you Rome for your pay!
Remember, tomorrow, your sufferings, your fame, what is owing to
you&mdash;fight as you know how to fight&mdash;follow me&mdash;you
see this silver corslet which is my sole possession&mdash;follow
that through smoke, through fire, into the heart of Rome! You must
be quick! We have food for only two days!"</p>

<p>Charles heard these words repeated again and again, until he
could hardly believe that it was his own voice shouting them. The
Prince of Orange rode by his side and seconded him; he was
encouraging the already frenzied men by relating to them the
prowess of the Connétable, as he termed Charles.</p>

<p>"When three of the Imperial galleys were cast on the shore on
the banks of the Var, it was Charles de Bourbon that called Adrian
de Croy and Pescara to help him and rescued the galleys and the
artillery, under a fierce fire from the French fleet&mdash;ay, he
showed the way to the others as he will show you tomorrow!"</p>

<p>Charles rode along the lines of German mercenaries, saying:</p>

<p>"Remember Georg Frundsberg!"</p>

<p>A deep roar answered him.</p>

<p>As he rode away he said to Philibert:</p>

<p>"Why did you tell them about the galleys? I had forgotten that.
Have you heard who is in command in Rome?"</p>

<p>"Ay, those prisoners we made said it was Renzo da Ceri, of the
Princes of Orsini&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He will not have been able to do much&mdash;make mines or
trenches, or put gun-shelters on the walls."</p>

<p>"No, he will hardly have been able to repair the walls
themselves."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Charles, "noticing the great breaches in
them&mdash;that day I was on the Palatine. Was not Vercelli the
name of the quack who tried to poison Leo X? It was his house I
went to. My Prince, I have shouted myself hoarse, but these men
will fight tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Ay, and for my part, I shall be glad of a soft bed, some fresh
linen, and a rest from the saddle. I see the banner of St.
Peter&mdash;how the breeze lifts it!"</p>

<p>The mercenaries slept in shifts during that warm
night&mdash;some watched, some made scaling-ladders, some looked to
their firearms and their swords.</p>

<p>Charles, having done all that man could do, gave to one of those
few faithful gentlemen who had followed him from Chantelle, his
horse, his sword, his helmet, and the heavier portions of his
armour, and in his worn leather undress went to lie down for an
hour's repose under the group of tall pine trees that rose half-way
down the slopes of Monte Mario into the night; folding his short
cloak for a pillow, he closed his eyes, shutting out the starlight,
the torchlight, the outline of Sant' Angelo. His mind was oddly,
and much to his own discomfiture, detached from the tremendous
action of which he was part and leader.</p>

<p>He clasped his hands behind his neck underneath his long, dark
hair, trying to gain what ease he could; and he smiled to himself
to think that he was there, lying on the ground outside the walls
of Rome with the Italian pines murmuring overhead, and into his
mind came the thought of the field of daisies in the Bourbonnais,
and the pearls that he had put into the hands of his sick wife, and
the great book she had been reading emblazoned with all the arms of
the Bourbons.</p>

<p>"These toys and trifles must not come into my mind&mdash;let me
recall the situation of Rome, have I not learned it by heart? We
are on the right bank of the river&mdash;the quarters of the Borgo
and Trastevere lie before us&mdash;the walls will have to be
scaled, one after another&mdash;how much artillery has da Ceri? The
Leonine city is to our left&mdash;that contains the Vatican, St.
Peter's&mdash;Sant' Angelo&mdash;there will be two gates to take,
Santo-Spirito, Torrione&mdash;to the right two other gates, San
Pancrazio and Settimaria&mdash;when all these are taken, there are
the inner towers and ramparts to assault&mdash;those that lie along
the right bank of the Tiber&mdash;those that protect the Quirinal,
the Forum, the Capitol, the Palatine&mdash;yes, three different
attacks will have to be made&mdash;can the men do it? What
resources has the Orsini?"</p>

<p>Charles opened his eyes on the stars that sparkled through the
black boughs overhead; he could not sleep, he could not
rest&mdash;"No repose for me until I stand face to face with the
Medici and dictate my terms."</p>

<p>He raised himself on one elbow; the bruised grass smelt sweet
beneath him. He called out softly to the Frenchmen resting near
him; he liked to hear his own Language&mdash;he regretted De Lurcy,
murdered by the Spaniards.</p>

<p>A gentleman came with a little lantern.</p>

<p>"See all my mail is ready," whispered Charles. "I will lead them
to the ramparts between the Porta Torrione and the Porta
Santo-Spirito&mdash;is there a chapel near?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur, many captains have been there."</p>

<p>"I will go too&mdash;before I lead these heretics on Rome. I
wonder why!" He rose and leaned against the pine tree; everything
looked dark in the pearl-coloured air.</p>

<p>"Will it soon be dawn?" asked the Connétable.</p>

<p>One of his gentlemen said "yes" and that a mist was rising; the
page knew the way to the chapel.</p>

<p>"The mist will be better for our assault," replied Charles, and
he followed the boy round a little vineyard where the first leaves
were beginning to shoot and curl on the vines, and so to a small
roadside chapel built at the foot of the hill for the spiritual
refreshment of pilgrims to Rome and dedicated to All the Saints.
outside was a spring of water leaping from a rock, where grew
clusters of ferns, violets, and cyclamen unfolding amid the
drenched leaves.</p>

<p>Charles called up his page, bathed his hands and face, and wiped
them on a napkin that the boy carried.</p>

<p>Then he entered the chapel where there was a young priest with a
severe, haggard face and a little child serving at the altar, which
was hung with silver offerings that glittered in the light of the
cheap, yellow candles; the place was perfumed by the earthy smell
of the wildflowers, pulled up by their roots and laid as offerings
beneath the carved statues that stood either side the altar. Many
Spanish and Italian captains had come in that night to make
Confession and take the Sacrament; and the young priest did not
know who was this tall, lean man in the leathern coat, but accepted
his devotions and listened to his Confession with austere
indifference, while the little boy stood by, round-eyed and
round-mouthed, swinging a small censer from which the incense
floated in a blue cloud, while he wondered what was all this tumult
of armed men, neighing horses, tattered banners, and trumpets
sounding, with uncouth songs rising into the Roman air.</p>

<p>Charles came out again into the vineyard and saw that the sky
was becoming grey while all the ground was covered with a light
mist; then from the Castle of Sant' Angelo he heard the Papal
trumpets and saw the yellow splutter of artillery fire as the Papal
guns spat defiance. He looked back at the little chapel, smiling at
himself.</p>

<p>"Why did I go there? And has it brought me peace?"</p>

<p>With these two questions unanswered he went to where his squire
held his horse, stood still while his gentlemen buckled on all the
heavy pieces of his armour, and above his cuirass placed the worn
yet still glittering silver corslet that he designed as a mark for
his men. When his gentlemen had attired him, he stood with the
white plumes in his helmet seven feet high, and, when mounted on
the white horse, masked by the pointed visor, seemed gigantic and
inhuman. Placing himself in front of the Spanish cavalry that del
Vasto had once commanded, he gave the order for attacking the low
walls of the Borgo.</p>

<p>The advancing Spanish arquebusiers unslung and set
their weapons, then fired at the motley forces, which, behind
hastily improvised defences, guarded the walls of Rome.</p>

<p>As Charles de Bourbon rode at the head of the cavalry, he
thought of the day when he had climbed the hill of the Palatine and
seated himself on the amber-coloured masonry and looked across the
Tarpeian Rock, where the white goats had browsed among the ruins of
ancient grandeur.</p>

<p>He looked forward through the slit in his vizor on the great
city, and a second's wild exaltation touched him:</p>

<p>"I have at length achieved this incredible thing&mdash;I have
brought these ragged, starving, rebellious troops by sheer force of
one man's will-power to the wills of Rome."</p>

<p>The mist came down suddenly, heavily: the besiegers hastened
forward under this thick cover, evading the random fire from the
walls.</p>

<p>When Charles saw the brickwork of the ramparts a few yards
ahead, blurred by the white vapours, he sprang from his horse,
threw the reins to his esquire, from the lean hands of a Spaniard
snatched one of the scaling-ladders the men had made the previous
night and, calling to the men to follow him, ran forward, alert in
his armour, setting the ladder against the western wall of the
Borgo; the mist cleared away as if a sudden breath had been blown
from heaven, and his white plumes and silver corslet were
conspicuous in that gush of light.</p>

<p>"Follow," cried Charles, "follow!"&mdash;and glanced back over
his shoulder at the Spaniards as he put his foot on the first rung
of the scaling-ladder. A Cardinal's stable-man, who that day
handled an arquebus for the first time, saw, as he Peered down,
this brilliant figure and, grinning with excitement and fear,
fired from behind the shield on the wall that protected him.</p>

<p>Charles fell back with the ball in his groin, and the Spaniards
behind him bore swiftly out of the press towards the little chapel
where he had confessed an hour before; bullets, flaming torches,
stones, and boiling pitch were being hurled by Renzo da Ceri's
soldiers from the ramparts; but the Spaniards had seen the Duc de
Bourbon fall, and their furious onslaught was not to be resisted;
the Prince of Orange leaped forward to take the place of leader,
and with shouts of an inexpressible fury the assailants hurled
themselves on the ramparts of Rome, while the Duc de Bourbon,
unconscious in his heavy armour and sagging in the arms of six
Spaniards, was carried across the meadows and vineyards. The priest
and the boy had fled from the chapel. The candles still burnt upon
the altar; the wildflowers still wilted among their fresh earth at
the foot of the statues, and faint wreaths of incense still
lingered in the enclosed air.</p>

<p>The cursing men piled up their torn and soiled cloaks as a bed
for their leader; with love and fury and disappointment, they saw
him dying before their eyes, and crudely they tried to staunch the
wound in his thigh, from which the blood was running on to the
stone floor&mdash;no priest came, no doctor; he was bleeding to
death.</p>

<p>He moved once and threw up his eyes...his chaplain was by his
side now, held his twitching hand, bent down and tried to hear what
he muttered&mdash;something about loyalty to the Emperor, and if
matters were ever accommodated with the King of France, he wished
his nephew the Prince Roche-sur-Yon to be his heir, and might all
those who had suffered by following his crazy fortunes be
protected. He stared into the dark, sallow faces of the Spaniards
that were distorted with grief and rage, and then into the haggard
features of his chaplain, and seemed to know none of them, but
crossed his hands upon his breast and smiled and sighed in a
terrible whisper, "Rome! Rome!" and so died.</p>

<p>They laid his torn banner with the terrible inscription "By the
sword only" over him and ran out to tell his soldiery that he was
dead and that nothing remained now but to revenge him. It was his
name that the assailants shouted&mdash;"Bourbon! Bourbon!
Bourbon!"&mdash;as they took the walls and ramparts by assault, one
after another, and, forcing the Roman soldiers back into the heart
of the city, reached the base of the fortress of Sant' Angelo as
the portcullis was dropped.</p>

<p>The Pope, running wildly along the corridor that connected the
palace of the Vatican with the fortress, his purple train upheld by
Paolo Giovio, and followed by a press of Cardinals and Court
officials, had but just gained the safety of Sant' Angelo as the
frantic Imperialists swarmed round it; from all sides, from the
Ponte Sisto, from the Porta San Pancrazio, down the Janiculum
swarmed the Germans, the Spaniards, the Italians, shouting the name
of Bourbon and the word "blood". The heretics singing hoarsely
their grim Lutheran hymns, beating their drums, and blowing their
trumpets, the mercenaries crossed the yellow waters of the Tiber by
the Papal bridges, and entered the Piazza Navana and the Campo dei
Fiori.</p>

<p>When the swift darkness fell, the Prince of Orange was master of
Rome and his exultant, fanatic, half-bewildered hordes surged
through all the narrow streets, across all the great squares,
through every quarter; beating their drums, sounding their
trumpets.</p>

<p>In the Campo dei Fiori, where Charles had visited the charlatan
Vercelli, the Lutherans encamped. Only the great fortress&mdash;the
pagan tomb that had become a Christian castle, where the Pope
cowered amid his cardinals, his officials, and his
ambassadors&mdash;was safe from the Imperialists, who roared and
staggered through Rome, shouting, "Bourbon! Blood!"</p>

<p>Watched by those weary Frenchmen who had accompanied him from
Chantelle, Charles de Bourbon lay rigid on the floor of the little
chapel that opened on to the vineyards and the meadows, and where
the sounds of the tumult in Rome echoed faintly like the echo of
the sea heard in a shell.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>TWELVE.<br>
The Sack of Rome.<br>
(Continued).</h2>

<h3>COLOURS OF LOUISE</h3>

<p class="verse">Street and rampart, bridge and moat,<br>
With Roman blood is RED;<br>
Above the conquered city float<br>
WHITE banners of the dead.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
IN Cardinal Bibbiena's bathroom the painted Venus tied her
sandals in tranquillity, the little Loves guided their teams of
doves and snails; in Cellini's workroom the gems winked among the
beaten metals and the enameller's tools; in the cool galleries of
the Vatican the writhing group of "The Laocoön" grinned its
agony in silence and emptiness; in the grey, serene mausoleum of
San Lorenzo the two Medici Princes in their shadowed alcoves
pondered in unutterable loneliness; in Raffaello's painting, the
Pope, with a saintly gesture, stayed the fire in the Borgo: but no
power, human or Divine, stayed the sack of Rome; like a fine crown
of gems and flowers shattered by a brutal hammer-blow the city lay
broken, at the mercy of the barbarians.</p>

<p>The shrieks of the dying and the tortured mingled with the
shouts of triumph and derision, as the drunken mercenaries
staggered from house to house massacring, burning, pillaging. The
jangling church-bells beaten by frantic hands clanged against the
yells of the <i>Landsknechte</i>, as they ran from quarter to
quarter, from palace to palace; through the arcades of despoiled
mansions flashed the scarlet robes of Cardinals, brocades of great
ladies, the battered armour of great lords, as they took to
helpless flight; on winged stone steps and in courtyards beautiful
with palms and fountains lay the murdered pages and waiting-women,
their scented locks defiled with blood; the shopkeepers were slain
beside their goods, the bankers beside their desks; the tradesmen's
bodies lay across the counters which but yesterday had been heaped
with pretty fineries; children were speared at their mothers' knees
and women hung up by their hair; tapestries of gold and silver were
trailed in the bloody streets, and Greek and Latin manuscripts torn
up to light camp fires in the public square; mutilated corpses were
heaped up before the splendour of the church-doors; within, the
priests lay before their defiled altars, their brains beaten out by
statues of alabaster and silver, the sacred wine and wafers spilled
and trampled into the silk carpets on the altar steps.</p>

<p>"This is Bourbon's funeral-pyre!" cried the Prince of Orange,
riding from street to street through the smoke that blackened the
palaces and blotted out the sky; he could do nothing to stay the
sack. The Medici and three thousand people were safe in Sant'
Angelo. Renzo da Ceri and his soldiers, fighting inch by inch, had
been driven from the walls, the towers, the houses where they had
taken refuge; all of them were dead or dying save those who had
stampeded into Sant' Angelo. "If Bourbon had lived, he had
controlled them." Philibert de Châlons, like a leaf on a torrent,
was swept here and there by the rushes of the mercenaries he tried
to restrain as they flung themselves here and there in search of
fresh prey; never had they dreamt of such riches, such delights as
were now at their mercy, such vessels of gold, silver, and bronze,
set with gems, such vases and statues of basalt, porphyry, and
alabaster, such draperies of velvet, silk, and satin, such painted
chambers, such scented gardens&mdash;Rome, the treasure house of
the world.</p>

<p>The Lutherans destroyed and slew for fanaticism, the Spaniards
for cruelty, the Italians for wantonness, for they plundered even
the wretches in the slums, and all because they were mad with
sudden victory after long striving. In every quarter fires broke
out, flaring palely in the spring air, from which all perfume of
flower and leaf had been burnt away. Bridges were choked by flying
figures, who one by one were overcome, throttled, and cast into the
river below; the yellow waters of the Tiber moved slowly, impeded
by the burden of the dead, the bodies blocking their progress;
mingled with the amber wavelets were the amber locks of the two
women who had been Raffaello's models and who had played in the
worldly comedies for the Pope; their oval faces, staring in terror,
gleamed for a second beneath the muddy wavelets as their corpses
were carried down to Ostia.</p>

<p>Drunken Germans, whose slobbering lips were dripping with rich
wine from priestly cellars, staggered against the parapets, and
their sacks of plunder fell into the river, which glittered here
and there with gold and silver vessels, with jewelled bracelets and
brooches, before the precious metals sank into the mud; costly
books, illuminated with flowers and pictures of saints, floated on
the current; birds of delicate plumage, snatched from gilded
silver-wire cages and strangled, were swept down among the corpses
between the scarlet and blue draperies, the billowing folds of
white linen; boughs of oleander, of myrtle, of laurel and palm,
torn down in frantic struggles, were clasped in the stiffening
hands of the dead Roman women borne down the Tiber.</p>

<p>Roman patricians, who saw their families being massacred before
their eyes, mounted their horses and drove frantically through the
press and leaped into the river&mdash;beast and man struggling to
the mercy of oblivion. The grey and white, the black and brown
habits of monks strewed the spacious steps of the great churches
and the walled convent gardens; their blood soaked into the ground
which bore the herbs that yesterday they had been tending, and
stained the marbles and mosaics where yesterday they had knelt in
prayer.</p>

<p>Only the Vatican was spared, because the mercenaries hoped to
get, as a ransom from the Papal palace, an enormous sum of money,
worth more even than its contents. The band of drunken and fanatic
Lutherans would have sacked the Vatican library had not a young
Cardinal, protected by his armed retinue, beguiled them away by
leading them to his own cellars and rolling among them out of his
palace gates casks of Salarian and choice wines from Naples and
Greece.</p>

<p>With desperate valour the fortified palaces of the Colonna were
defended, the Cancelleria and the Apostoli held out even against
the onrush of the <i>Landsknechte</i>, but every other house, even
those of the ambassadors and Imperialist Cardinals, fell to the
mercenaries; and those who tried to resist the victors were
slaughtered where they stood.</p>

<p>The Cardinal of Gosta was seized by the Protestants and with a
fool's cap on his head paraded in front of Sant' Angelo for the
torment of the imprisoned Pope; the long-treasured relics snatched
from the churches&mdash;even from the most respected church in
Christendom, San Giovanni Laterano&mdash;were kicked into the
gutters and cast into the flaming ruins; women and priests had
their ears, arms, and fingers lopped off by German swords for the
sake of earrings, bracelets, and rings; the Italians descended even
to the ancient sewers in the search for treasure trove, the
Spaniards broke open the tombs, gorgeous in the cool spaces of the
churches; the corpse of Julius II was dragged into the light, and
the rich ornaments torn from his Papal robes; these, fiercely
fought for, finally reached the eager clutches of the Jews who ran
here and there, offering ready money for valuables. These gold and
silver pieces, these priestly vestments, these bloody ornaments
twisted from the writhing limbs of the living, this dimmed finery
dragged from the corruption of the grave, all went to pay and to
clothe the harlots who swarmed, like bees round the honey-pot,
about the triumphant barbarians.</p>

<p>These women, dishevelled, half mad, half naked, wholly drunk,
were dragged to the broken altar and, seated there by the
Lutherans, sang bawdy ditties, with their feet on a litter of
sacred manuscripts, and coronets torn from statues of the Virgin in
their hair.</p>

<p>The white flag of Bourbon, out of respect to the dead leader,
was raised in every quarter of the city, above the churches, above
the camps; some were the original standards <i>semés</i>
with lilies that Charles had brought from Milan, others were sheets
and table-cloths. "Bourbon! Bourbon!" cried the mercenaries as they
slew, tortured, plundered, drank, and gambled; never was dead
general avenged in a more terrible manner. Shouting the name of
Martin Luther in the accents of Franconia and Swabia the
<i>Landsknechte</i> hurtled round the impregnable fortress of
Sant' Angelo, the Pagan tomb that protected the Pope.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, who had shortly before ravaged the
Borgo himself, dashed into the city to triumph over the Medici, and
instead wept at the horrors he beheld; joining the Prince of Orange
in the Apostolic Palace, he helped this frantic young leader to
save the treasures of the Vatican, by riding among the mercenaries
and promising them heavy ransom, and full vengeance on the Pope,
whom the Lutherans and the Spaniards both wished to hang. Hideous
riches began to foul the May days; the weather was sweltering; the
slaughter, the fires, continued day and night.</p>

<p>The French gentlemen took off the armour from the long corpse of
Charles de Bourbon, washed his bloodless limbs, combed his straight
hair, wrapped him in one of his own flags, and buried him in the
ground beyond the chapel.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Frightened by the continuous cries of anguish, by the smoke and
flames, the doves flew so high above Rome that they were lost in
the lilac haze of the spring day. Ottavo, the beggar, remained
crouched in his hut on the Palatine; no fugitive could get out of
Rome, for the gates and walls were guarded, and so rich was the
plunder and so plentiful the victims in the quarters by the river
that none of the mercenaries troubled to mount the hills, which
appeared from a distance to be deserted.</p>

<p>So Ottavo was unmolested, and he looked down on the scene
below&mdash;red flame and white banner and the yellow river running
thickly with its rich burden of spoil and of dead&mdash;as one
might look through a hole in the curtain at the peepshow beyond.
The convent near by was deserted; the nuns had fled one by one and
in disguise became lost in the Campagna, making their way with
other fugitives from the suburbs towards the mountains.</p>

<p>The old man crept among the golden blocks of masonry till he had
reached a vantage point where he could see below. Everything seemed
far away there were tawny gleams here and there on the armour of
the soldiery as they marched or ran from street to street; here and
there the May sun gleamed on a gun or the line of a sword. Ottavo
could see little figures gaily clad, flying with their arms
outstretched and their hair flowing; he could hear the bells and
the shouts, but from this height it was difficult to distinguish
the cries of joyous, ferocious triumph from those of despair and
agony. Now and then a puff of smoke from a burning building veiled
his view; occasionally there was a dull explosion as some store of
powder blew up, and flames, livid and yet transparent, would rise
up in erect tongues into the blue. Round the old man's feet were
cyclamens and violets and little ferns growing undisturbed; the
leaves of the ilex and the olive trees shivered in the
reverberation of the violent noises from below.</p>

<p>Ottavo peered at the massive outline of Castel Sant' Angelo,
where the Pope shuddered in mortal peril and in mortal fear. He
saw, here and there, where there was an opening in the houses, a
white banner carried across from one street to another; he heard
snatches of uncouth hymns and trumpet-blasts.</p>

<p>At noon another old beggar-man, too insignificant to be
molested, came creeping up out of the city and told the hermit that
the Duc de Bourbon was dead and that his soldiers for a week had
been massacring in Rome. He sat down on a stone, getting his breath
after the steep ascent; he shuddered and whimpered, sucking in his
underlip. He would not talk of what he had seen; he believed that
by tomorrow there would be no one left alive in Rome save the
mercenaries. Then he began to laugh weakly and related how one of
the Cardinals had reached the castle of Sant' Angelo after the
portcullis had been drawn up and how he had had to be raised into
the fortress in a basket.</p>

<p>Then, out of his ragged bosom, he pulled a gold bracelet: "I
found this in the street." He wiped the dry blood off the metal
with the corner of his sleeve.</p>

<p>"What use is that to you or me?" said Ottavo.</p>

<p>"One never knows, things may change&mdash;the Jews are already
buying and selling again." The beggar added cunningly: "It is
almost worth while going back to Rome&mdash;it is easy to be
overlooked, and there is really a great deal to be picked up.
They're all mad and drunk and destroy as much as they take. I have
seen much thrown away that would have fetched a good price in any
market." The beggar added, grinning: "They are murdering everyone
in the Borgo. I saw some of the young masons and painters who were
working in the Vatican and who tried to escape. They were spitted
and thrown into the Tiber with the rest."</p>

<p>"Who has Bourbon's place?"</p>

<p>"The other Frenchman, the Prince of Orange, as I suppose, but he
can do little. I saw him in his yellow plumes and silver
armour&mdash;calling out like a madman on one of the bridges, he
was&mdash;it was chance he was not thrown over too. Ay, but you
should see the river&mdash;all those dead women being carried down
to the sea." The beggar laughed nervously with his fingers on his
toothless lips.</p>

<p>"And Bourbon is dead," grinned the hermit. "They say he was a
great man of war."</p>

<p>"Ay, he was the first to put a scaling-ladder against the
ramparts of the Borgo. He's dead. I heard he lay in a little chapel
with no one with him but his Frenchmen&mdash;but one sees his
banner everywhere in Rome."</p>

<p>"Come farther up the hill," whispered Ottavo, "come farther up
the hill, come farther away."</p>

<p>The two old men walked slowly through the ruins, keeping
themselves cunningly hidden behind the clumps of brambles, the
bushes, the broken pillars, the ancient overturned altars. They
kept together, and now and then halted to recover breath; the newly
arrived beggar had some broken scraps in his pocket and he
suggested supper. They crept into the shelter of the little temple
that Ottavo had plastered into the likeness of a hut. They ate
their meal in silence and waited for the coming out of the stars,
for in these remote and supernatural lights they found much
comfort.</p>

<p>The painted Venus in the Cardinal's bathroom tied up her
sandals, and in the grey mausoleum of San Lorenzo the two Medici
Princes remained pondering in unutterable loneliness.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>THIRTEEN.<br>
Yellow Doors.<br>
July 1527.</h2>

<h3>L'ENVOI</h3>

<p class="verse">Prince, farewell, the pipes are mute<br>
That once with tabor and with flute<br>
The dancers brought across the green<br>
Where now the naked willows lean<br>
Beside the winter bitten tomb<br>
Where thy shrunk frame has easy room.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
THAT summer the dead Connétable of France was tried for
high treason in the presence of King François. Louise of
Savoy enjoyed his treasure; she a little regretted the man so
comely, reserved, and brilliant; a man able to do difficult things,
to endure reverse of fortune, to live without women.</p>

<p>A pity, she thought, that he had wasted himself by defying her
wishes. She began to lack lovers, and it would have been amusing to
have taught him some of her tricks. What had he gained by his
foolish rebellion? He had merely become the Emperor's scapegoat.
The Emperor had benefited from the capture and sack of Rome, which
had made him the most powerful Prince in the world, and all the
blame of it had been put on Charles de Bourbon. Louise thought it
was all stupid. But none of it really mattered&mdash;and in her
mind she turned over greedily all this man's possessions, the rich
clothes he had worn, the jewels that hung on his neck and wrists,
the furniture and toys that had belonged to his dead wife and
children, all his horses, dogs, and houses; even the fields of the
Bourbonnais, which in the spring were covered with daisies that
melted into the horizon like snow.</p>

<p>Three times the dead man was summoned by the usher of the court
to the Bar of the Parliament&mdash;"Charles de Bourbon!" At the
marble table "Charles de Bourbon!" At the marble steps: "Charles de
Bourbon!"</p>

<p>There was no reply, and so the dead man was condemned, and all
his goods returned to the Crown. It was also ordered that the door
of his palace by the Louvre should be painted yellow as a mark that
the late master was a traitor.</p>

<p>Jacques Testard, once a miniature painter, was employed on this
work; with two assistants, one of whom swung a pot of paint while
the other carried a large brush, he set out for the
Connétable's handsome palace near the Louvre; a garrulous,
disappointed man, Testard talked incessantly to his two
discontented assistants.</p>

<p>"I met this Prince once outside Rome. He wore a black and violet
robe and seemed very melancholy. It was stupid of me not to
recognize him. I had seen him before, of course, but never dressed
like that&mdash;and after all one does not expect to find a great
Prince wandering alone. Ah, here's the palace&mdash;that great
door! Why, it will take us all the morning to paint it. What an
ugly shade of yellow they have given us&mdash;more like sulphur
than gold! I suppose he deserved it. This is a strange work for me
to have to do&mdash;for a man trained to do miniature-painting;
but, anyway, one is lucky to get anything at all these times. I
wish I had that Italian Cellini's luck. They say he was on the
ramparts during the assault, out of sheer curiosity."</p>

<p>Testard stood by the door, measured its breadth and height with
his eye, sighed, took off his outer garment and rolled up his
sleeves.</p>

<p>"Thousands of people were massacred in the sack of Rome," he
remarked. "It is astonishing how many people are killed one way and
another every year, and how hard it is for those who survive to get
a living."</p>

<p>With another sigh he dipped his brush into the pot of yellow
paint and proceeded to daub the colour of infamy over the dead
man's palace-door.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">
THIS book is a narrative of an event, the sack of Rome in 1527,
describing how it came to pass, the characters who took part in it,
and what it meant in the lives of many people. It forms the third
volume of a trilogy I planned some few years ago, dealing with
Europe just before and during the Renaissance. The first volume was
"The Golden Roof" (Das Goldene Dächl), written and published in
1928, which dealt with the dreams of the idealistic Emperor
Maximilian I of Hapsburg and the Europe of 1460-1520, the beginning
of the epoch called the Reformation.</p>

<p>The second novel of this trilogy, "The Triumphant Beast",
written and published in 1934, showed the rise of Neo-Platonism and
free-thinking in the person of Giordano Bruno, who was murdered by
the forces of reaction in 1600 on the Campo Fiorito; he was burnt
as a heretic, after appealing from the verdict of his jury to that
of Posterity, which has judged him to be one of the greatest names
of all time.</p>

<p>As already noted, this present novel, "Trumpets at Rome" (Il
Sacco di Roma), comes third in the trilogy and deals with the pomp
of the Medicean Popes, the French Renaissance under François
I, the internecine wars in Italy, culminating in that brutal and
grotesque climax, the sack of Rome.</p>

<p>To such men, the end of the century that spelt weariness and
disillusion to so many after the upheavals of the Reformation and
the Renaissance, was full of hope and promise; these men were the
forerunners of modern scientific knowledge and liberal thought.</p>

<p>The scenes of these novels are as widespread as the Renaissance
itself, and the stories are developed in terms of the everyday life
of the times depicted; no one of the characters in this trilogy
ever knew that he was living in a definite epoch&mdash;history
takes even the thoughtful unawares. Engrossed in their private
passions and interests, people do not notice that they are part of
a large movement which is to be definitely labelled by
posterity.</p>

<p>These three novels relate not only large events, but the details
of everyday, and they take into account that supernatural realm in
which the people of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries passed
much of their existence. The background and detail of the foregoing
novel are authentic for a history of these times; the reader,
however, can only be referred to the historians.</p>
