<p>A peaceful spot is Piper's Flat.<br>
  The folk that live around,<br>
  They keep themselves by keeping sheep and turning up the ground.<br>
  But the climate is erratic, and the consequences are<br>
  The struggle with the elements is everlasting war.<br>
  We plough, and sow, and harrow&mdash;then sit down and pray for rain;<br>
  And then we all get flooded out and have to start again.<br>
  But the folk are now rejoicing as they ne'er rejoiced before,<br>
  For we've played Molongo cricket, and McDougall topped the score!</p>
<p>Molongo had a head on it, and  challenged us to play<br>
  A single-innings match for lunch&mdash;the losing team to pay.<br>
  We were not great guns at cricket, but we couldn't well say No,<br>
  So we all began to practise, and we let the reaping go.<br>
  We scoured the Flat for ten miles round to muster up our men,<br>
  But when the list was totalled we could only number ten.<br>
  Then up spoke big Tim Brady, he was always slow to speak,<br>
  And he said&mdash;"What price McDougall, who lives down at Cooper's Creek?"</p>
<p>So we sent for old McDougall, and  he stated in reply<br>
  That "he'd never played at cricket, but he'd half a mind to try.<br>
  He couldn't come to practice&mdash;he was getting in his hay,<br>
  But he guessed he'd show the beggars from Molongo how to play."<br>
  Now, McDougall was a Scotchman, and a canny one at that,<br>
  So he started in to practise with a paling for a bat.<br>
  He got Mrs. Mac. to bowl him, but she couldn't run at all,<br>
  So he trained his sheep dog, Pincher, how to scout and fetch the ball.</p>
<p>Now, Pincher was no puppy; he was  old, and worn, and grey;<br>
  But he understood McDougall, and&mdash;accustomed to obey &mdash;<br>
  When McDougall cried out "Fetch it!" he would fetch it in a trice;<br>
  But until the word was "Drop it!" he would grip it like a vice.<br>
  And each succeeding night they played until the light grew dim;<br>
  Sometimes McDougall struck the ball&mdash;sometimes the ball struck him!<br>
  Each time he struck, the ball would plough a furrow in the ground,<br>
  And when he missed, the impetus would turn him three times round.</p>
<p>The fatal day at length  arrived&mdash;the day that was to see<br>
  Molongo bite the dust, or Piper's Flat knocked up a tree!<br>
  Molongo's captain won the toss, and sent his men to bat,<br>
  And they gave some leather-hunting to the men of Piper's Flat.<br>
  When the ball sped where McDougall stood, firm planted in his track,<br>
  He shut his eyes, and turned him round, and stopped it&mdash;with his back!<br>
  The highest score was twenty-two, the total sixty-six,<br>
  When Brady sent a yorker down that scattered Johnson's sticks.</p>
<p>Then Piper's Flat went in to bat,  for glory and renown,<br>
  But, like the grass before the scythe, our wickets tumbled down.<br>
  "Nine wickets down for seventeen, with fifty more to win!"<br>
  Our captain heaved a heavy sigh&mdash;and sent McDougall in.<br>
  "Ten pounds to one you lose it!" cried a barracker from town;<br>
  But McDougall said "I'll tak' it, mon!" and planked the money down.<br>
  Then he girded up his moleskins in a self-reliant style,<br>
  Threw off his hat and boots, and faced the bowler with a smile.</p>
<p>He held the bat the wrong side  out, and Johnson with a grin,<br>
  Stepped lightly to the bowling crease, and sent a "wobbler" in;<br>
  McDougall spooned it softly back, and Johnson waited there,<br>
  But McDougall, cryin. "Fetch it!" started running like a hare.<br>
  Molongo shouted "Victory! He's out as sure as eggs."<br>
  When Pincher started through the crowd, and ran through Johnson's legs. <br>
  He  seized the ball like lightning; then he ran behind a log,<br>
  And McDougall kept on running, while Molongo chased the dog.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300851h-images/page022.jpg" alt="page022" width="541" height="750"></h3>
<p>They chased him up, they chased  him down, they chased him round, and then<br>
  He darted through a slip-rail as the scorer shouted "Ten!"<br>
  McDougall puffed; Molongo swore; excitement was intense;<br>
  As the scorer marked down"Twenty," Pincher cleared a barbed-wire fence.<br>
  "Let us head him!" shrieked Molongo. "Brain the mongrel with a bat!"<br>
  "Run it out! Good old McDougal!" yelled the men of Piper's Flat.<br>
  And McDougall kept on jogging, and then Pincher doubled back,<br>
  And the scorer counted "Forty" as they raced across the track.</p>
<p>McDougall's legs were going fast,  Molongo's breath was gone&mdash;<br>
  But still Molongo chased the dog&mdash;McDougall struggled on.<br>
  When the scorer shouted "Fifty!" then they knew the chase could cease;<br>
  And McDougall gasped out "Drop it!" as he dropped within his crease.<br>
  Then Pincher dropped the ball, and, as instinctively he knew<br>
  Discretion was the wiser plan, he disappeared from view.<br>
  And as Molongo's beaten men exhausted lay around.<br>
  We raised McDougall shoulder-high, and bore him from the ground.</p>
<p>We bore him to M'Ginniss's, where  lunch was ready laid,<br>
  And filled him up with whisky-punch, for which Molongo paid.<br>
  We drank his health in bumpers, and we cheered him three times three,<br>
  And when Molongo got its breath, Molongo joined the spree.<br>
  And the critics say they never saw a cricket match like that,<br>
  When McDougall broke the record in the game at Piper's Flat.<br>
  And the folk are jubilating as they never did before;<br>
  For we played Molongo cricket&mdash;and McDougall topped the score!</p>

<p class="note">Given as an encore to "<i>How McDougall Topped the Score</i>," at the  public reception to Victor Trumper in Sydney Town Hall, 19th December, 1903&mdash;</p>
<p>One evening, just at sundown, I  was sitting on a rail,<br>
  When up rode big Tim Brady, who had been to fetch the mail.<br>
  Taking out a daily newspaper, he handed it to me,<br>
  And, pointing to a paragraph, "Just look at this," says he,<br>
  "Here's a cove called Victor Trumper, an Australian by birth,<br>
  Has been moppin' up the cricket records all around the earth,<br>
  Such centuries and aggregates were never known before,<br>
  And New South Wales is 'dotty' because Trumper's topped the score.</p>
<p>I says, when I had read it, "Yes,  I think I've heard his name,<br>
  And, accordin' to the cablegrams, he plays a decent game.<br>
  In breaking English records, he's been makin' fame for us,<br>
  And I think, in spite of Kipling, that a young man might do wuss;<br>
  But before he breaks all records, he has got to wait a bit,<br>
  For he hasn't broke McDougall's, who scored fifty in a hit.<br>
  I ain't the least bit jealous&mdash;I don't speak because of that,<br>
  But we'll let no bloomin' Trumpers take the cake from Piper's Flat.</p>
<p>"When McDougall piled his record  up, and knocked Molonglo dead,<br>
  He didn't play them with his bat, he played them with his head.<br>
  If Trumper comes to Piper's Flat he'll find we're not asleep,<br>
  For what we had the head to win we'll have the head to keep.<br>
  He'll meet with every kindness, he shall have a horse to ride,<br>
  But, if he rides the chestnut mare, he'll have to get inside.<br>
  She threw Flash Mat, the horse-breaker, and ruined his profile;<br>
  And the man will make a record that can ride her half a mile.</p>
<p>"We'll fill him up with ginger  wine, and cream, and nice fresh cheese,<br>
  And then, if he is fit to go, we'll show him Bowker's bees;<br>
  They're awfully fond of strangers, and if Trumper plays at all<br>
  After he's done inspecting them, he'll never see the ball.<br>
  He'll find the wicket bumpy, and the bowling rather wild,<br>
  And, then, we've still got Pincher left, and Pincher ain't no child.<br>
  He understands McDougall. If his master tells him so<br>
  He'll get a grip on Trumper's pants, and never let 'em go.</p>
<p>"When every man is equal, why &mdash;  then no man will be best,<br>
  And every score that's made will be same as all the rest.<br>
  In the socialistic language there is no such word as strife,<br>
  And the bloke that breaks a record will be put in gaol for life.<br>
  Then Trumper's and McDougall's fame will not be fame at all,<br>
  And perhaps we'll drop our record, just as Pincher dropped the ball.<br>
  But until then our record shall remain at Piper's Flat,<br>
  We've only one, but you may bet your boots we'll stick to that.</p>
<p>"If Trumper is contented with the  records he has got,<br>
  And don't come up to Piper's Flat to try to scoop the lot,<br>
  Then Brady and McDougall, and the men of Piper's Flat<br>
  Will wish good luck to Trumper, and they won't forget the hat.<br>
  They mean to keep their record, but they all acknowledge worth,<br>
  And hail him as the most accomplished cricketer on earth.<br>
  Their cheers will make the gum trees shake, they'll pledge him in a bumper.<br>
  While breath holds out they'll roar and shout, 'Long life to Victor Trumper.'"</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSongoftheSundowner"></a>The Song of the Sundowner</b></h2>
<p>I'm the monarch of valley, and  hill, and plain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king of this golden land.<br>
  A continent broad is my vast domain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its people at my command.<br>
  My tribute I levy on high and low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I chuckle at Fortune's frown;<br>
  No matter how far in the day I go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm at home when the sun goes down.</p>
<p>In the drought-stricken plains of  the lone Paroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rainless earth is bare,<br>
  I take toll from the shepherd and jackeroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I sample their humble fare.<br>
  Not a fig care I though the stock may die,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun-cracked plains be brown;<br>
  I can make for the east, where the grass is high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm at home when the sun goes down.</p>
<p>When river and creek their banks o'er  leap,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the flood rolls raging by;<br>
  When the settlers are mourning their crops and sheep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can watch them without a sigh.<br>
  What matter to me if their fences go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their horses and cattle drown?<br>
  I can find a good meal when the sun is low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a home when the sun goes down.</p>
<p>So I wander away at my own sweet  will,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it northerly, south or west;<br>
  When I'm hungry my paunch I can always fill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm tired I can always rest.<br>
  I care not what others may do or think,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a monarch without a crown;<br>
  I can always be sure of my food and drink,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a home when the sun goes down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ABushBredYoungster"></a>A Bush-Bred Youngster</b></h2>
<p>There's a lonely gorge in the  mountains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the lyre-bird builds its nest;<br>
  Where the mid-day sun scarce lingers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shadows love to rest;<br>
  Where, amid the rocks and boulders,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggling waters leap,<br>
  And there, 'mid the ferns and shadows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hero is laid to sleep.</p>
<p>He sought not for death or glory,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid the battle's pomp and din,<br>
  Where the grave awaits the vanquished,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the laurel those who win.<br>
  It was duty alone that called him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the sound of the drum or fife,<br>
  But he answered the call of duty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he gave &mdash; all he had &mdash; his life.</p>
<p>Little Bess was the widow's  darling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her solace and only joy,<br>
  Since Heaven had taken her other loves,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband and bright-eyed boy.<br>
  Little Bess was a fair-haired lassie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of five, and she used to play,<br>
  And sing, as she weaved her wild flowers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into posies bright and gay.</p>
<p>Young Jim was a bush-bred youngster,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a great, strong, awkward lad,<br>
  Very much like other mortals<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither very good nor bad.<br>
  But he loved the fair-haired Bessie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he cleared the gate at a bound<br>
  When the widow called that her darling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had strayed, and could not be found.</p>
<p>Jim vow'd that he'd seek and find  her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, with feverish eagerness,<br>
  He packed in a well-worn satchel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some food and some fruit for Bess.<br>
  Then he followed the path by the willows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he searched for her tracks, until<br>
  The shadows were long in the valleys<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun sank behind the hill.</p>
<p>But just as the day was waning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the vanishing light grew less,<br>
  Jim found a small posy of wild flowers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he knew had been plucked by Bess.<br>
  Then he eagerly searched the gully,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose every path he knew,<br>
  And he spied near a stunted fern-tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The print of a tiny shoe.</p>
<p>And the night crept down the  valley<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its solitude and its gloom,<br>
  And the breeze that swayed the tree-tops<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed like murmurings from a tomb.<br>
  In vain did Jim call and "Cooey",<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shout through the gathering night,<br>
  For the rocks replied to his calling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the voice of a mocking sprite.</p>
<p>Jim was only a bush-bred  youngster,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had never been taught to pray,<br>
  Yet, never was prayer more earnest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Jim's, for the light of day.<br>
  And never more pure thanksgiving<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascended the Throne of Grace,<br>
  Than his, when he saw the first grey dawn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumine the lonesome place.</p>
<p>Then step by step he tracked her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through many a rocky dell,<br>
  Through bush, and fern he traced her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the signs that he knew so well.<br>
  Sometimes would the footprints vanish<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the signs wax faint and dim,<br>
  But a broken twig, or a grass blade bent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sufficient guide for him.</p>
<p>He was footsore and tired and  weary,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was hungry and dinnerless,<br>
  For the food that he bore in the satchel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had sacredly kept for Bess.<br>
  His fingers were scratched and bleeding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knew he was on her track,<br>
  And he cared not for wounds nor hunger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he carried his darling back.</p>
<p>There's a spot in the Corang  Mountains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the cliff hangs high and steep,<br>
  And frowns o'er a rocky basin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose waters are cold and deep,<br>
  And Jim as he scanned the valley,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Espied near a moss-grown rock,<br>
  The glint of a white sun-bonnet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gleam of a scarlet frock.</p>
<p>Then he called again to his  darling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his eyes grew moist and dim,<br>
  When, instead of the mocking echoes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her baby voice called "Jim!"<br>
  Then from rock to rock he bounded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the speed of a mountain deer,<br>
  What mattered the cuts and scratches<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now dear little Bess was near?</p>
<p>She rose from her sweet child  slumbers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clapped her small hands with glee,<br>
  And she cried "I've been lost so long, Jim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I knew you would come for me.<br>
  I was tired, and I fell asleep, Jim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while sleeping I dreamt of you,<br>
  And I thought I could hear you 'Cooey',<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I woke, and my dream was true!"</p>
<p>But her wee voice froze with  horror,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the smile died on her face,<br>
  For a rock that Jim had leapt on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tumbling from its place.<br>
  She saw him clutching madly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a fern. She saw him cling<br>
  To stones and grass and creepers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to every fragile thing.</p>
<p>She heard his cry of anguish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then &mdash; rocks and stones and grass,<br>
  Came crashing down the hill-side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one commingling mass.<br>
  She saw him fall beside her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard a crushing sound,<br>
  And the stone had rolled across his knees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pinned him to the ground.</p>
<p>Three long and weary days and  nights<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim lay in helplessness.<br>
  Though faint for food he would not eat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But gave it all to Bess.<br>
  He was only a rough, bush youngster,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hunger is hard to bear,<br>
  But Jim preferred to starve outright<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than eat of her scanty fare.</p>
<p>And at length, when the searchers  found them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Bessie sat close to him,<br>
  And raising her tiny finger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, "Hush! you'll awaken Jim!"<br>
  But Jim was beyond awakening,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jim's was the greater gain,<br>
  For, as love had subdued his hunger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So death had now vanquished pain.</p>
<p>There are cenotaphs, grand and  stately,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many a sacred fane,<br>
  Recording the deeds of heroes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the turmoil of battle slain.<br>
  To kill men may be heroic,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as noble and good and brave,<br>
  Is the hero who freely gives his life,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another's life to save.</p>
<p>Jim was only a bush-bred  youngster,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his courage was strong and real;<br>
  His head was not crammed with knowledge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his heart was as true as steel.<br>
  And when God shall command his heroes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To appear and be judged by Him,<br>
  We shall find engrossed on the Sacred Scroll<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the bush-bred Jim.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SimpleSam"></a>Simple Sam</b></h2>
<p>Sam Fallow was a farming man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of substance and sobriety,<br>
  Who lived near Coonabarabran<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comfort and propriety.</p>
<p>For twenty years from morn till  night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd worked with willing cheeriness;<br>
  For twenty years from dark till light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd rested from his weariness.</p>
<p>His intellect was calm and free<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From falsehood or duplicity;<br>
  And what his neighbours told him he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believed with sweet simplicity.</p>
<p>But though his mental calibre<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was babylike and innocent,<br>
  His physical proportions were<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both mighty and magnificent.</p>
<p>His mind was like the virgin soil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of great potentiality;<br>
  His thews and sinews, tough with toil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultured actuality.</p>
<p>And Sam came down to Sydney town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spend his Christmas holiday;<br>
  And there he met with William Brown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with him spent a jolly day.</p>
<p>Now, William Brown was bad and  bold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sam was all simplicity,<br>
  And all the tales that William told<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam swallowed with felicity.</p>
<p>When introduced to William's  friend,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And William's friend predicted him<br>
  Long life and money without end,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam never contradicted him.</p>
<p>When they performed some little  trick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And challenged Sam to do it, he<br>
  At once confessed his head was thick<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And void of ingenuity.</p>
<p>Then William Brown grew sad and  sighed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmured quite dejectedly:&mdash;<br>
  "My rich old Uncle James has died<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fiji, unexpectedly."</p>
<p>As beat of drums and trumpet tones<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arouse a camp from sleepiness,<br>
  So these few words through Samuel's bones<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Produced a kind of creepiness.</p>
<p>Some message from the distant past<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Sam's dull brain seemed hammering,<br>
  He thought a moment, then at last<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognised its clamouring.</p>
<p>"Why now I know," at length he  cried&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I was near deluded too&mdash;<br>
  The chap, when poor old grand-dad died,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His latest words alluded to.</p>
<p>"Before he breathed his last, says  he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Remember, though I'm leaving you,<br>
  That coves with uncles in Fiji<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are frauds who are deceiving you.</p>
<p>" 'When Noah on his ancient deck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met such a one who sounded him,<br>
  He caught the beggar by the neck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chucked him out and drownded him.</p>
<p>" 'I'm peggin' out without a  doubt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you meet 'em score with 'em;<br>
  Just turn the wasters inside out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wipe the bloomin' floor with 'em.'</p>
<p>"And then poor grand-dad died; and  so<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dying words affected me,<br>
  I've got to do, before I go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As poor grand-dad directed me."</p>
<p>Sam caught a spieler in each hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain was all their battling;<br>
  For miles around, I understand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folks heard their bones a-rattling.</p>
<p>He swung those spielers round and  round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was deaf to all their squealing, too;<br>
  And Sam not only swept the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wiped the walls and ceiling too.</p>
<p>And when he dropped them on the  floor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere remnants of humanity,<br>
  The room was filled with hair and gore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With garments and profanity.</p>
<p>Now, when the festive times come  round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for Jays and Jugginses,<br>
  Two battered spielers still are found<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of Mugs and Mugginses.</p>
<p>But if perchance they meet a man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of simple amiability,<br>
  And he says, "Coonabarabran,"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They vanish with agility.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought refreshment at the "Digger's Rest."<br>
  The house was with its title quite in keeping,<br>
  Behind the bar two pigs were soundly sleeping.</p>
<p>I took my lunch, some eggs just  newly laid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corned beef and damper and a cup of tea,<br>
  Then, while my horse was feeding in the shade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat and smoked beneath a myall tree. <br>
  When, near at hand I heard a dismal droning,<br>
  Like some afflicted mortal, sadly groaning.</p>
<p>Seeking the cause, I spied an aged  man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose gaping boots revealed his socks of rag.<br>
  He sat beside a battered billy-can,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaned upon a weather-beaten swag.<br>

  Are you in pain, or are they signs of madness?"</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That make me groan so sadly,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a conscience stricken badly.</p>
<p>"From the time that I learned to  walk,<br>

<p>"Ah! many's the ounce of gold<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Was the blooming  lot I missed.</i></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an unlucky sort of coon,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>"And I saw Jim was fast asleep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I let him sleep away,<br>

<p>"But next day at the 'Miner's  Arms,'<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the story told,<br>
  That Jimmy was drunk, and hid under his bunk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Were two hundred  ounces of gold.</i></p>
<p>"So I crept to the old camp fire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I found that the yarn was true,<br>
  And I cussed at the flames, and I called myself names,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I kicked myself black and blue.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chance that I let slip by.</p>

  That he hadn't been nearly so good as he ought,<br>
  In dispensing good cheer to his neighbours and friends,<br>
  So he hit on a scheme that would make them amends.<br>
  He said, "Molly, me darlin', we'll go the whole hog,<br>
  You must lay in a stock of provisions and grog.<br>
  We'll invite all the neighbours, and try to contrive<br>
  Just to give them an iligant wallaby drive.</p>
<p>He invited the Murphy's, both  Johnny and Mat,<br>
  And old Sandy McDougall from Tumble Down Flat;<br>
  There was Barney O'Grady, and Jones from the Mill,<br>
  And old Paddy the stockman, from Cabbage Tree Hill.<br>
  And they came with their wives, and their sweethearts, and some<br>
  Came alone, and a few were unable to come.<br>
  But it did Molly's heart good to see them arrive<br>
  To Peter O'Mulligan's wallaby drive.</p>
<p>There was game in abundance, and  plenty of sport,<br>
  And the old gum trees shook with the rattling report<br>
  Of old Paddy's big musket, as furious and fast,<br>
  He blazed, with his eyes shut, at all that went past.<br>
  At the end of the day, when they counted the score,<br>
  Paddy hadn't shot one, while McDougall had four.<br>
  Johnny Murphy was top, for he shot twenty-five<br>
  At Peter O'Mulligan's wallaby drive.</p>
<p>When the sun had gone down, and  the shooting was done,<br>
  There was dancing and feasting and flirting and fun.<br>
  Johnny Murphy got drunk, while his young brother Mat<br>
  Courted Kitty McDougall, from Tumble Down Flat.<br>
  While Peter himself, quite unknown to his lady,<br>
  Sat on the verandah with Biddy O'Grady.<br>

  While O'Mulligan's missus made Biddy look white.<br>
  In a moment the house was like Donnybrook Fair;<br>
  There were heads in the fireplace, and heels in the air.<br>
  And though Paddy, the stockman, to part them did strive,<br>
  He got floored &mdash; at O'Mulligan's wallaby drive.</p>
<p>Poor Kitty McDougall lost all her  false hair,<br>
  While O'Grady got scalped with the leg of a chair;<br>
  Johnny Murphy struck Paddy, who called him a liar,<br>
  And, upsetting the lamp, set the whole house on fire.<br>
  There was fire in the parlour, and smoke in the hall,<br>
  And a blaze in the room that was cleared for the ball,<br>
  And the ladies who'd fainted, they had to revive<br>
  Or be baked &mdash; at O'Mulligan's wallaby drive.</p>
<p>Then they rallied round Peter,  their friendship returning,<br>
  And they pulled down his house, to prevent it from burning;<br>
  When the fire was put out, they all shouted, "Good night!"<br>
  And then saddling their horses, were soon out of sight.<br>
  When the last one was gone, Mrs. Mulligan rose<br>
  And she said, as she wiped a big tear from her nose,<br>
  "When ye want more divarsion to kape you alive,<br>
  I presume, faith! ye'll get up a wallaby drive."</p>
<p>Then, as phoenix-like, Peter arose  from the ashes,<br>
  With his whiskers all singed, and his eyebrows and lashes,<br>
  He exclaimed, "By the ghost of Saint Patrick, I swear &mdash;<br>
  If I ever recover my eyebrows and hair,<br>
  That there's only one small piece of hunting I'll do,<br>
  Faith! I'll hunt for O'Grady, and give him his due.<br>
  As for you, Divil take you! I'll skin you alive,<br>
  If you ever more mention a wallaby drive!"</p>

<p>A time has been, in nearly every  nation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Freedom, crushed beneath a tyrant's heel,<br>
  Hast burst her bonds, and, mad to desperation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has struck a blow which made the tyrant reel.<br>
  Oppression's chains, with tyrant hands to bind them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May doom to servile bonds a slavish race;<br>
  But patriot hands, with manly hearts behind them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will snap those chains before the tyrant's face.</p>
<p>We reverence the men, renowned in  story,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose gallant blood was poured on Freedom's shrine;<br>
  Their sole ambition was a patriot's glory,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Freedom's triumph was their sole design.<br>
  But now, alas! is Freedom's cause degrading,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of those of whom the bards have sung,<br>
  We now have Patriots (?) openly parading,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sole reliance is their strength of lung.</p>
<p>With noise and bluster they would  rule the nation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crush opponents with their foul remarks,<br>
  Their trusty weapon, vile vituperation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their chosen battle ground, our public parks.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of peddling patriots, with leather lungs.</p>
<p>One has a nostrum for each fiscal  evil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another preaches socialistic rot,<br>
  A third attacks religion and the devil,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each prates on that he thinks he prates on best,<br>
  Each fills with dust the eyes of the elector,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to advance himself would hang the rest.</p>
<p>Yet all are patriots, for they  love the nation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose laws and rulers treat them all so queer,<br>
  And are prepared to work out its salvation&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ease it of three hundred pounds a year.<br>
  They want a seat and its attendant glories,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For its emoluments their throats they tear;<br>
  And, sad to say, <i>O tempora, O mores</i>,<br>

  Frae out the stump a heid appeared,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' on the heid "an auld blue bonnet,"<br>
  &nbsp;Then cam a figure, strange an' weird,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That "crooned awa' an auld Scots' sonnet."</p>
<p>His withered hauns he waved on  high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ane, new-risen frae the deid;<br>

<p>In a humble hut, on a scrubby  flat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the land of the setting sun,<br>
  Lived a simple but honest rouseabout,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who rejoiced in the name of Dunn.<br>
  He could warble as sweet as a bandicoot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could dance like a kangaroo,<br>
  His age, it was just about four feet-ten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his height about thirty-two.</p>
<p>He worshipped a beautiful female  maid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lived on a distant plain;<br>
  Whose husband had gone to a far-off land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had never come back again.<br>
  She had bright blue hair, she had rosy eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her cheeks were of golden hue.<br>
  So Tommy set off, as the sun went down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell her he loved her true.</p>
<p>He traversed the hills and the  mountain peaks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed up a rugged plain,<br>
  He swam the beds of the dried-up creeks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he tramped o'er the raging main.<br>
  He saw not the wind on the distant hills,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard not the rising moon,<br>
  For his soul was dead, and his burning head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was as calm as a big monsoon.</p>
<p>His eye, like a hurricane, roared  aloud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice, like the lightning flashed,<br>
  The blustering blizzard it boomed and burst<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on through the dust he splashed.<br>
  He rode on a flea-bitten chestnut mare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a patent pneumatic tyre;<br>
  And the sparks from the feet of his flying steed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set Billabong Creek on fire.</p>
<p>He leapt from the train at the  half-way house,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood at the maiden's door;<br>
  He wept at the sight of that dear old spot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he never had seen before;<br>
  He stood on his head at the maiden's feet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he begged her his lot to share,<br>
  Then, brushing a tear from his glist'ning ear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke of his dumb despair.</p>
<p>"See! see!" he exclaimed to the  winsome maid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In syllables tall and sweet,<br>
  "The whole of my expectations I cast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At thy beautiful, blushing feet.<br>
  For you I would live &mdash; through Eternity!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say 'yes' &mdash; for my own sweet sake,<br>
  And without a murmur I'll sacrifice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the millions I hope to make."</p>
<p>Then the maiden rested her  blushing nose<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment on Tommy's chest,<br>
  And she said, as she cuddled his crumpled form<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her soft and capacious breast,<br>
  "As I have been true in the years to come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll be true in the past," said she.<br>
  And she winked her ear at a native bear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was perched on a pumpkin tree.</p>

  Can rive the solid rocks asunder;<br>

  Till tier on tier, rough-hewn they stand,<br>
  Waiting the expert craftsman's hand.<br>

  (Cunning to judge both stones and men),<br>
  Examines keenly every stone,<br>
  Selects the good and sound alone,<br>
  Distributes all his work with care &mdash;<br>
  A column here, an arch-stone there &mdash;<br>
  Directing so that all combine<br>
  To harmonise one grand design.</p>

<p>"The firm foundation next is made,<br>
  Each stone is well and truly laid<br>
  (The finest building could not stand<br>
  If built on mud or shifting sand).<br>
  Then stone on stone is fixed in place,<br>
  Each massive, strong, yet full of grace;<br>
  Whilst each its separate burden bears,<br>
  It helps its mates to carry theirs.<br>
  The pillars, rising from the ground,<br>
  With sculptured capitals are crowned.<br>
  Each product of the craftsman's skill<br>
  Has its allotted space to fill,<br>
  Just as, on earth, the humblest man<br>
  Is part of God's almighty plan.</p>
<p>And the mallets and the hammers on  the chisels ring,<br>
  And the groaning blocks are creaking as the derricks swing;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Master cries 'Well done,'<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his work is well begun,<br>
  And the chips and spawls are flying as the Masons sing.</p>

  Are filled with flowing tracery;<br>
  From groin&eacute;d ceilings angels weep,<br>
  And from quaint corners gargoyles peep,<br>
  So queer are some, they almost seem<br>
  To have been drawn from some mad dream.<br>
  Now, cunning men the spandrails fill<br>
  With foliage, carved with wondrous skill.<br>
  The Master's cheery accents tell<br>
  That all is orderly and well;<br>
  For, as his men he moves among,<br>
  He hums aloud the Mason's song.</p>
<p>Oh, the hammers and the mallets on  the chisels ring,<br>
  And the heavy stones are rising as the derricks swing,<br>
  And the building slowly grows<br>
  'Neath the craftsman's skilful blows,<br>
  And the chips and spawls keep flying as the Masons sing.</p>
<p>"Yet still more high the building  grows,<br>
  Each tier some added beauty shows;<br>
  A flying buttress, quoin or label,<br>
  Coping stone or pointed gable;<br>
  Sculptured bosses, Gothic knees,<br>
  Or richly foliated frieze.<br>
  While within, the eye may roam<br>
  From altar step to stately dome;<br>
  Higher still, and yet more high,<br>
  Till pinnacles approach the sky.<br>
  The gilded finial stands alone,<br>
  And seems to kiss the setting sun;<br>
  Erect and plumb, it seems to say,<br>
  'From earth to heaven I point the way.'</p>
<p>And the mallets and the hammers  now no more will ring,<br>
  And the blocks will creak no longer as the derricks swing,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can I e'er forget<br>
  The feelings of joy and rapture<br>

<p>The Albatross sailed to the  Southern Seas,<br>
  Amidst coral islands and banyan trees,<br>
  Where the scent-laden puffs of the torrid breeze<br>
  Go up to a hundred and forty degrees.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the heat in the hole<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  replenish the fires below,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is  exactly the same<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As  that region of flame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where  unorthodox people go.</p>
<p>Benjamin Buckle was stout and  strong,<br>
  His hands were horny, his arms were long,<br>
  He sang as he shovelled the coals among,<br>
  And this was the text of the Stoker's song:&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh,  we've shovelled and stoked<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  been bothered and smoked<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till  you can't tell the coal from us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've  been frizzled and fried<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a  Rhino-popotamus."</p>
<p>But one afternoon, about four  o'clock,<br>
  The Albatross struck on a sunken rock;<br>
  And she struck it with such a tremendous knock<br>
  That she broke in halves with the sudden shock.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  she fractured her back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben  leaped through the crack,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  struck manfully out for land.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At  a quarter to five<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  was lying alive&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  alone &mdash; on the coral strand.</p>
<p>Now, His Majesty King  Kookabudgerie,<br>
  The King of the island of Fi-fo-fee,<br>
  Was wondering what he would have for tea,<br>
  When he spotted Ben, and he danced with glee.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  was tired of yams,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  detested clams,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had  little else to eat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  Ben was a prize<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  abnormal size,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the  daintiest kind of meat.</p>
<p>So the King gave vent to a  cheerful roar,<br>
  He called for his cooks and his wives a score;<br>
  They gathered up firewood and sticks galore,<br>
  And they kindled a fire on the sandy shore.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  the embers then<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They  lifted Ben,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so  chubby and plump he looked,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  they all agreed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  a splendid feed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  would make them when nicely cooked.</p>
<p>They stirred up the fire till the  sun went down,<br>
  Then His Majesty frowned with an awful frown,<br>
  And the feathers he tore from his royal crown,<br>
  For Benjamin hadn't begun to brown.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  they poked up the fire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the flames shot higher<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben  waked from his sleep and smiled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  said, "Stupid old joker,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You  can't cook a stoker,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll  neither make roast nor biled."</p>
<p>"Wot are yer givin' us," shouted  Ben,<br>
  "Do you think I'm as soft as a new-laid hen?<br>
  I ain't a poor beggar wot drives a pen,<br>
  I'm one of His Majesty's fire-proof men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who  have shovelled and stoked,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  smothered and smoked,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a  Hippo-Rhinoceros."</p>
<p>Then the cannibal King,  Kookabudgerie,<br>
  He welcomed Ben Buckle on bended knee;<br>
  "I make you from this very hour," said he,<br>
  "Controller of Customs for Fi-fo-fee.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since  my reign began<br>

<p>It wasn't quite the spot an  average person would select<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To study classic architecture in,<br>
  For every man in Brogan's Flat was his own architect,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And materialised his plans in slabs and tin.<br>
  The sun-baked street was crooked, and the houses wide apart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a patch of bush between them now and then;<br>
  But the township didn't pride itself on literature or art &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its pride was concentrated on its men.</p>
<p>As I don't hail from Brogan's  Flat, it don't apply to me;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you can take my word this tale is true.<br>
  The people there possessed in a superlative degree<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faculty to go for all they knew.<br>
  If a Brogan's Flat inhabitant played cards, he played to win;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he always held the joker and the bower;<br>
  But if he didn't play at cards, then cards were deadly sin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a shocking waste of energy and power.</p>
<p>The good men there were extra  good, the bad ones very bad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall men always grew extremely tall;<br>
  And every man was jolly or superlatively sad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they always smoked or never smoked at all.<br>
  The pious men at Brogan's Flat spent all their time in prayer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gossips spent the whole of theirs in chat;<br>
  And the teamsters on the Namoi never quite knew how to swear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they had a final course at Brogan's Flat.</p>
<p>Bill Peters kept the smithy at the  west end of the town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he couldn't fit a shoe or weld a link,<br>
  Fix a bolt for Jimmy Thompson or a nut for Johnny Brown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his shibboleth was "Comanavadrink."<br>
  Then sounds of noisy revelry would float from Murphy's bar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be followed by a simple old refrain,<br>
  The melodies were various, but as constant as a star<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the chorus &mdash; it was "Fillemupagain."</p>
<p>Beyond the mill, where Brogan's  Flat extended to the east,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the forge of Jock McTavish, who would swear<br>
  That the man who touched strong drink was more degraded than a beast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that wine was a delusion and a snare.<br>
  While McTavish made a horse-shoe 'twas his custom to inveigh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against publicans and whisky, rum and gin,<br>
  And his preaching was as powerful while riveting a stay<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the blows with which he drove the rivets in.</p>
<p>While Peters sang a roaring song  in praise of rosy wine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled himself with whisky from the still,<br>
  McTavish used to preach in praise of abstinence divine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing of sparkling water from the rill.<br>
  If a stranger came to Brogan's Flat, and entered from the west,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place seemed full of drunkenness and mirth,<br>
  While the stranger from the eastward always thought the town was blessed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And imagined it the soberest spot on earth.</p>
<p>Now, although the temperance  question was decided east and west,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle Brogan's Flat was still in doubt;<br>
  And the middle folks consulted and decided it was best<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to meet and thrash the troubled problem out.<br>
  So they called a public meeting and arranged for a debate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the subject for discussion it was this:<br>
  "Does the cup what's said to cheer us, and what don't inebriate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or does whisky, give the greatest share of bliss?"</p>
<p>Jock McTavish championed  temperance with eloquence and skill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his reasons were convincing and profound;<br>
  While Peters fought for alcohol and whisky from the still,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his arguments were logical and sound.<br>
  And every point McTavish made was driven home with force<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like his mighty sledge, his blows were hard and true;<br>
  While the arguments that Peters used, he clinched without remorse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he clinched the nails when nailing on a shoe.</p>
<p>When the chairman put the  question, he announced, 'mid great applause,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the voting had resulted in a tie;<br>
  And he couldn't give a casting vote on either side, because<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was at a loss to give a reason why.<br>
  He had listened to the various points the speakers dwelt upon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he felt convinced the meeting would agree<br>
  That the intellectual arguments delivered pro and con.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were just about as equal as could be.</p>
<p>When Peters rose to move a vote of  thanks unto the chair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "I'd like to make this one remark &mdash;<br>
  The arguments of friend McTavish lead me to declare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I've always been a-gropin' in the dark.<br>
  I've been like one benighted, and I'm certain as can be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I've always been mistaken heretofore;<br>
  From to-night I'll stick to water, varied now and then with tea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll never touch the whisky any more."</p>
<p>Then McTavish rose to second it,  and briefly he announced,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Peters has converted me outright;<br>
  And, although my love for water has been ardent and pronounced,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never touch cold water from to-night.<br>
  I feel to William Peters gratitude that's quite intense,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words fail me to express the thoughts I think,<br>
  But I can't resist his eloquence, his wit, and common sense&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, my brethren, Comanavadrink."</p>
<p>McTavish now sings roaring songs  in praise of rosy wine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fills himself with whisky from the still;<br>
  While Peters preaches temperance and abstinence divine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sings of sparkling water from the rill.<br>
  Now, the stranger entering Brogan's Flat, and coming from the west,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never hears the sounds of revelry and mirth;<br>
  And the stranger from the eastward never marks the place as blest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he thinks he's struck the drunkest spot on earth.</p>

<p>You needn't think a man's a mouse,  because he looks forlorn,<br>
  'Cause his pants are out at elbows, and his linen's frayed and torn;<br>
  Because his coat's seen better days, and his waistcoat ain't quite new,<br>
  And his hat's a ventilating one and lets the air come through.<br>
  A man is easy sat upon when Fortune's done its worst,<br>
  And the only asset left him is unliquidated thirst.<br>
  I'm the shuttle-cock of Fortune, and the boomerang of Fate,<br>
  I'm a blighted politician, who got plucked for voting straight.</p>
<p>When first I entered parliament I  knew a thing or two,<br>
  I used to trim my flowing sails to every wind that blew;<br>
  Though I didn't have much learning I possessed some common sense,<br>
  And could hold my own at sitting on or sliding off a fence.<br>
  My opinions were elastic, but my principles were sound,<br>
  For if they caught an adverse wind, they always twisted round.<br>
  So Fortune smiled upon me, and I proved from day to day,<br>
  That the politics that wobble are the politics that pay.</p>
<p>One night when party strife was  keen, I was an absentee,<br>
  So when they counted noses they could count on all but me;<br>
  My vote was worth the fattest prize the Ministry could give,<br>
  For I could kill the Government or I could let it live.<br>
  The party whip soon found me out and I remarked that I<br>
  Was conscientiously inclined to let the Government die.<br>
  Said he "What price your conscience?" Then I whispered in his ear,<br>
  And the party when I took my seat received me with a cheer.</p>
<p>Alas! for fickle Fortune that will  sometimes kick the beam,<br>
  While members droned I slumbered, and I dreamt a blissful dream.<br>
  The division bell awoke me; then I started from my doze,<br>
  And cast the vote among the "Ayes," I'd promised to the "Noes."<br>
  I discovered when I rubbed my eyes, and turned to look about,<br>
  That I'd voted with my conscience, but I'd put the Government out.<br>
  So a dissolution followed, and I found out when too late,<br>
  That people thought I'd lost my head, because I voted straight.</p>
<p>On polling day I faced the crowd,  I argued north and south,<br>
  But talking's hard when half-hatched eggs keep dropping in one's mouth;<br>
  I could argue against men but not against bubonic rats,<br>
  Bits of pumpkin, rotten apples, and resuscitated cats.<br>
  I could raise my voice with resonance above the surging sea,<br>
  But a thousand braying asses were a bit too strong for me;<br>
  So the boys sang "Rule Britannia," and the men threw up their hats,<br>
  And when I tried to soothe the crowd, the crowd just shouted "Rats!"</p>
<p>I promised to do anything, to vote  just as they chose,<br>
  But the ancient eggs came faster, then a furious yell arose;<br>
  My platform swayed, and then gave way, and then I lost my feet,<br>
  And when I found my head again I found I'd lost my seat.<br>
  I'm a blighted politician, crushed beneath the wheels of fate,<br>
  Minus my golden railway pass, because I voted straight.<br>

<p>Stifling was the air, and heavy;  blowflies buzzed and held a levee,<br>

  As Tobias Mathew Carey, a devout bush missionary,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged his broken-winded horse towards the township of  Warhoo.<br>
  He was visiting the stations, and delivering orations<br>

  It was bearded, bronzed, and hairy, and Tobias Mathew Carey<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a very shrewd suspicion as the object he espied,<br>

  Gave his horse a spell much needed, and immediately proceeded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pour down, on Jake the Spieler, an admonitory  shower.</p>
<p>He commenced his exhortation with  a striking illustration<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the physical and moral degradation that must come<br>
  To the unrepentant sinner who takes whiskey with his dinner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And converts his stomach into a receptacle for rum.<br>
  "Give attention to my query," said the ardent missionary:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not perceive that Satan is this moment calling  you?<br>
  He is shouting! he is calling, in a voice that is appalling:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you hear him?" And the spieler answered sadly &mdash; "Yes!  I do."</p>
<p>"I can prove it is impious," said  the eloquent Tobias,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To drink stuff containing alcohol, and liquors that  are strong,<br>
  And I'll prove to demonstration that your guzzling inclination<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is quite morally, and socially, and physically wrong.<br>
  When about to drain a bottle, or pour whiskey down your throttle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should think upon the thousands who have perished  for its sake.<br>
  Gone! to Davey Jones's locker, through the wine that is a mocker,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And which biteth like a serpent's tooth, and stingeth  like a snake."</p>
<p>Toby paused, and Jake replying,  said: "It ain't no use denying<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That your logic is convincing, and your arguments are  sound.<br>
  I have heard with admiration your remarks and peroration,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your knowledge of the subject seems extensive and  profound.<br>
  Yet, in spite of all your spouting, there is just one thing I'm doubting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm open to conviction, so convince me if you can;<br>
  As the iron's hot now strike it, just convince me <i>I don't like it</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll chuck the grog, and sign the pledge, and keep  it, like a man."</p>
<p>Then Tobias Mathew Carey eyed the  spieler bronzed and hairy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his tongue no word could utter, and the silence was  intense,<br>
  As the spieler, slowly rising, in a style quite patronising,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blandly smiled upon Tobias, and continued his defence.<br>
  "In your arguments I noted that the scriptures you misquoted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you know, Old Nick proved long ago that two could  play at that.<br>
  Which has caused the greatest slaughter? Was it rum? or was it water?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say it was the former, why I'll contradict it  flat.</p>
<p>"When old Noah at the deluge, in  the Ark was taking refuge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the other people in the world by water met their  fate.<br>
  And King Pharaoh's countless army! &mdash; Did they drink and all go balmy?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! You'll find they died by water if you'll just  investigate.<br>
  All the records of the ages, mentioned in the sacred pages,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only tell of one example, and the fact you know full  well,<br>
  Where a cove a drink was craving and for <i>water</i> started raving,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that beggar was located &mdash; where he ought to be &mdash; in  Hell!"</p>
<p>Jake then dropped the tone  effusive, and began to be abusive,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swore he'd "pick the missionary up and drop him in the  dirt,"<br>
  Vowed he'd "twist his blooming nose up, make him turn his blinded toes up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing him for a dusty fiver, or else fight him for his  shirt."<br>
  And the air was hot and heavy, and the blowflies held their levee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the evening sun shone red upon the plains of  Bungaroo;<br>
  As Tobias Mathew Carey, a disgusted missionary,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spurred his broken-winded steed towards the township of  Warhoo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tim Turpin by trade was a saddler,<br>

<p>He feel deep in love with a  maiden,<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLegendofDeadMansGully"></a>The Legend of "Dead Man's Gully"</b></h2>
<p class="note">At Wheeo, in the county of King,  is a lonely spot which bears the euphonious appellation of "Dead Man's Gully."  It derived its name and subsequent unenviable reputation from the incident  related in the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<p>As Sol sank smiling in the west,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows lengthened on the plain,<br>
  Each blushing hill and mountain crest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His rays reflected back again.</p>
<p>The waving wattles softly sighed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From scented shrubs the perfume rose,<br>
  The tiny streamlet's murmuring tide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered of peace and calm repose.</p>
<p>The magpie's vesper song was o'er&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her farewell to the setting sun,<br>
  The curlew in its lonely bower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its plaintive cry had not begun.</p>
<p>And as the shadows longer grew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twilight took the place of day,<br>
  A wayworn traveller came in view,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wearily pursued his way.</p>
<p>A broken, battered wreck was he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose active cruising days were o'er;<br>
  A flotsam on Life's troubled sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A derelict on Fate's lee shore.</p>
<p>His bloodshot eye and haggard  face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hungry look and unkempt hair,<br>
  His tottering limbs and faltering pace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All spoke of want and dull despair.</p>
<p>But suddenly erect he stood&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lonely hut had met his view,<br>
  And thoughts of succour and of food<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had given him life and strength anew.</p>
<p>He reached the door, for food he  craved.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its tenant was a lonely dame,<br>
  Who deemed him mad; she thought he raved,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade him go &mdash; to whence he came.</p>
<p>The haggard look returned once  more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His chin drooped heavy on his breast;<br>
  He staggered, fainting, from the door<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek some lonely spot to rest.</p>
<p>He reached a gully, drear and lone&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His weary pilgrimage was o'er&mdash;<br>
  And, with a last despairing groan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sank and fell to rise no more.</p>
<p>And when the moon's pale silvery  light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came shimmering through the dreary place,<br>
  The bright and beauteous orb of night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was shining on a dead man's face.</p>
<p>He had obeyed the timid dame &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head lay resting on a clod;<br>
  The earth had gone to whence it came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit had returned to God.</p>
<p>They dug a rude and humble grave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crossed his hands upon his breast;<br>
  And there, where golden wattles wave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They left his weary bones to rest.</p>
<p>And shivering clowns, with pallid  face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bated breath and straining eyes,<br>
  Still to the stranger show the place<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Dead Man's Gully where he lies.</p>
<p>They tell of many a fearsome  sight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a weird uncanny sound,<br>
  And say that in the gloom of night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead man's spirit hovers round.</p>
<p>They say that 'midst the lightning  flash<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is seen a blue and spectral gleam,<br>
  And how amid the thunder's crash<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heard a wild unearthly scream.</p>
<p>The boldest rider past the spot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fears no foe of mortal kind,<br>
  Will spur his steed and tarry not<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Dead Man's Gully's far behind.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHauntedLagoon"></a>The Haunted Lagoon</b></h2>
<p>There was once a man who came from  Bundanoon,<br>
  And a maiden from the town of Kangaloon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each evening in the gloaming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would go together roaming<br>
  Down a winding track that led to a lagoon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they'd spoon,<br>
  And talk nonsense by the glimmer of the moon.</p>
<p>He was wood-and-water Joey at the  "Star"<br>
  Where she waited, and assisted at the bar;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was fair, and tall, and slender,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was dark, and plump, and tender;<br>
  And he told her that her eyes were brighter far<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a star,<br>
  Which remark just proves how stupid lovers are.</p>
<p>But, through sitting in the  moonlight on a log,<br>
  Or meandering 'mid the bracken in a fog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the glass approaching zero,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influenza gripped our hero,<br>
  Which resulted in his talking like a frog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a hog,<br>
  Whilst his cough was like the barking of a dog.</p>
<p>And the falling dew descending  from the trees,<br>
  With the moisture that was borne upon the breeze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caused a bronchial inflammation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our hero's conversation<br>
  Was a cross between a snuffle and a wheeze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst his sneeze<br>
  Used to shake him from his elbows to his knees.</p>
<p>And he'd sit, and court, and spoon  until he froze,<br>
  'Till he couldn't tell his fingers from his toes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he'd plead with her and flatter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst his teeth would snap and chatter,<br>
  And his speech was punctuated by the blows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his nose.<br>
  (In his wretched state he called his nose his "dose".)</p>
<p>So he said to her "Sweet baid &mdash; <i>Atchoo!</i> &mdash; be bide,<br>
  Let us dwell for ever side &mdash; <i>Atchoo!</i> &mdash; by side.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say the word, you dearest pet, you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall &mdash; bake you &mdash; you &mdash;<i>U-retchoo!<br>
  </i>That shall bake you&mdash;bake you by&mdash;<i>Atchoo!</i>&mdash;by  bride,<br>

  Add for everbore I'll be&mdash;<i>U-retchoo!</i> &mdash;  thide.</p>
<p>Let be steal frob those sweet lips  wud fodd caress,<br>
  Let theb speak that wud sweet word &mdash;<i>Ah-tishoo!</i> Yes.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bake by burdig heart&mdash;<i>Ah-ticher!<br>
  </i>Bake by burdig heart this blissful bobedt bless,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do say yes.<br>
  Say&mdash;<i>At-choo! Atchoo!</i>&mdash;you'll crowd by  happidess."</p>
<p>But she positively spurned his  fond refrain,<br>
  Though she said she didn't wish to give him pain.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot-baked hearts she'd seen a-many,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she wasn't taking any,<br>
  Then she added that he'd water on the brain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was plain.<br>
  And she cocked her little nose up in disdain.</p>
<p>So the man from Bundanoon, in his  despair<br>
  Cried "Cads't thou be false add yet &mdash;<i>Atchoo!</i> &mdash; so fair?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst&mdash;<i>Atchoo!</i>&mdash;ye  clouds asudder!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash ye lightdigs! Boob thou thudder!<br>
  It's edough to bake a bortal&mdash;<i>Tishoo!</i>&mdash;swear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declare."<br>
  And the man from Bundanoon then tore his hair.</p>
<p>And they parted by the germ-infested  shore<br>
  Of the lake that "skylark never warbled o'er."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wild fowl left its waters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the 'possum changed its quarters,<br>
  So the pool became more silent than before,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the roar<br>
  Of that sneeze, disturbed the echoes&mdash;never more.</p>
<p>For they found his sodden corpse  in the lagoon,<br>
  Where he floated, calmly staring at the moon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some folks who went there boating<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said they heard, <i>Ah-tishoo!</i> floating<br>
  O'er its waters; so they ceased to go and spoon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very soon,<br>
  And especially the maid from Kangaloon.</p>

<p>The judges are sitting in solemn  array,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties are stern and unbending,<br>
  The issues that have to be fought out to-day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be fought to the bitterest ending.<br>
  The miners are seeking to better their lot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to ease the stern fight for existence:<br>
  While the masters assert that the coal trade will not<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justify any course but resistance.</p>
<p>"We delve in the earth," cry the  children of toil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We labour with vigour unceasing,<br>
  While you sit at ease, and grow fat on the spoil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your fatness is ever increasing.<br>
  While we spend our lives in the effort to live,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fruits of our labour you flourish;<br>
  So we claim, as a right, that a portion you give,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That our bodies and souls we may nourish."</p>
<p>The masters declare that the men are  well paid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to prove it bring yards of statistics;<br>
  That a fondness for rest, and a wish to kill trade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the miners' chief characteristics.<br>
  "They are slothful," they say, "and are fond of disputes;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are thriftless, depraved, and unsteady,<br>
  With the bodies of men, but the passions of brutes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are getting too well paid already."</p>
<p>So they wrangle and argue, protest  and declare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics come thicker and faster,<br>
  Till it seems that a miner is nought but a bear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a ravenous shark for a master.<br>
  The chasm between them's so deep and so wide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould appear there is naught that is human<br>
  Could ever induce them to stand side by side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to share one small feeling in common.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * *</p>
<p>But, hark! A sound comes rumbling  through the town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound that causes every nerve to thrill;<br>
  It shakes the mighty mountain to its crown!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its deep vibrations roll from hill to hill.<br>
  A few brief moments of suspense expire&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspense, now shared alike by man and master;<br>
  Then the dread words come trembling through the wire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tell of deadly terror and disaster.</p>
<p>Below &mdash; the sea is rippling in the  breeze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each wavelet dancing at the zephyr's breath,<br>
  Above &mdash; a wail is echoing through the trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling of homes made desolate by death.<br>
  Of loved ones stricken low, of broken hearts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of weeping children, and of wives forlorn;<br>
  Of all the horrors sudden death imparts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tells of orphan children yet unborn.</p>
<p>Then speaks a hero, "Miners of the  south,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men lie entombed, and some, perchance, yet live!<br>
  Within th' inferno of that tunnel's mouth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men lack the succour we alone can give.<br>
  Let each man speak who has the pluck to dare;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will any follow me? If so, reply!"<br>
  But not a craven heart is beating there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masters and men, with one accord, say, "Aye!"</p>
<p>The rescue party formed, they  enter then<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek survivors from the dread disaster.<br>
  A trusty band of picked and faithful men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of an expert master.<br>
  Through the black tunnels plunge the plucky band,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the dull flicker of the safety lamp<br>
  They note destruction's work on every hand;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They find, alas! the dreaded afterdamp.</p>
<p>"Back!" cries the leader. "Boys,  go back!" he calls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back, for your lives, or it will be too late."<br>
  He struggles manfully, then staggers&mdash;falls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But bids them go, and leave him to his fate.<br>
  The afterdamp engulfs them; like a wave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It rushes on them with its fatal breath;<br>
  Like drowning men, they seek their lives to save,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each, for the moment, face to face with death.</p>
<p>As one band, baffled by the  poisonous air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is led or carried from that awful space,<br>
  Another band of heroes gathers there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eager and resolute, to take its place.<br>
  And who can paint the utter, helpless woe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that grief-stricken crowd who hear the tread,<br>
  On the rough mountain paths, of those who go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing, with reverence, their comrades, dead?</p>
<p>Among the lifeless burdens there  are two<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whom the melancholy crowd divide,<br>
  For they are those who to the rescue flew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, fighting for their fellow-creatures, died.</p>
<p>Master and man! could sympathetic  tie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'er bind such men in mutual interest?<br>
  Thank heaven, yes! At sorrow's helpless cry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rushed, and died, each on the other's breast.</p>
<p>The morning saw them, full of vital  power,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masters and men, opposed in stern array;<br>
  No thought in common, yet the evening hour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found, in a last embrace, their lifeless clay.<br>
  Their latest breath they shared; with struggling feet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying, the same square yard of earth they trod.<br>
  Their souls, released, will at the judgment seat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same moment, stand before their God.</p>
<p>And shall they die in vain? Has  not their fate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some heaven-born meaning, as a sign of peace?<br>
  That men should foster love, and conquer hate?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That strife and discord may for ever cease?<br>
  God send the time, and grant that it be nigh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When men no more with hatred shall be riven;<br>
  When they, like brethren, shall both live and die,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus make earth a stepping-stone to heaven.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheWeddingofWinona"></a>The Wedding of Winona</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>An Indian Legend</i></p>
<p>In the dim remote antiquity<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of very long ago,<br>
  When the warriors of Wabasha<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chased the roving buffalo;<br>
  Near the mighty Mississippi<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived a chieftain, old and grey;<br>
  And he ruled the wild Wabashas<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an energetic way.</p>
<p>He could hunt and fight no longer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his hunting days were gone;<br>
  But he used to talk for hours about<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeds he once had done;<br>
  His once mighty arm was feeble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age had dimmed his vision keen,<br>
  So he lived upon the memory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what he once had been.</p>
<p>And the darling of his wigwam&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was dearer than his life,<br>
  Was not, as perhaps it should have been,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That aged Chieftain's wife,<br>
  'Twas his sweet and loving daughter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was supple, strong, and trim,<br>
  For the beautiful Winona<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the salt of life to him.</p>
<p>Lithe and active was Winona,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sparkle of her eyes<br>
  Was like dewdrops on the lilies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun begins to rise.<br>
  Like the bosom of the robin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were her lips, so rosy red,<br>
  And her laugh like sound of water<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rippling o'er its pebbly bed.</p>
<p>In the tribe of the Wabashas<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a warrior, brave and young;<br>
  And the praises of Winona<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were for ever on his tongue.<br>
  He declared he loved her dearly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath the twilight dim,<br>
  She vowed, by the Great Spirit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would love no man but him.</p>
<p>Alas! for lovers' promises;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! for lovers' dreams;<br>
  Too often are they shattered<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a parent's sordid schemes.<br>
  Soon the aged Chief, her father,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wigwam caused a stir,<br>
  When he quietly announced, that he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had other views for her.</p>
<p>Then, he told her how another  chief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out another band,<br>
  Whose warriors were invincible,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had asked him for her hand.<br>
  Said he, "You'll be obedient<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marry him, I trust;<br>
  In short, the day and hour are fixed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So marry him you must."</p>
<p>There's commotion in a dovecot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an eagle-hawk appears,<br>
  We are startled when a sudden clap<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thunder greets our ears;<br>
  But neither ever caused such dire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perplexity, as stirred<br>
  Poor Winona's gentle bosom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the horrid news she heard.</p>
<p>Yet, for filial obedience,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winona was renowned;<br>
  So she hung her head and answered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she knelt upon the ground,<br>
  "I must do my father's bidding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my aching heart may burst;"<br>
  But, she added, <i>sotto voce</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will see you smothered first."</p>
<p>Upon the wedding morning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sun rose in the east,<br>
  She wandered forth to gather flowers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deck the bridal feast.<br>
  She climbed a rock, and standing there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in the morning glow,<br>
  She saw her aged ancestor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the ground below.</p>
<p>He gazed upon her, as she stood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all a father's pride,<br>
  "My lovely eldest born," cried he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So soon to be a bride."<br>
  She laughed a wild, unearthly laugh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his words to mock,<br>
  Then, with one loud heartrending scream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leapt from off the rock.</p>
<p>It chanced that soon Winona's own<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wabasha man came round,<br>
  He clasped Winona's senseless form<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And raised it from the ground.<br>
  She soon unclosed her lovely eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiling sweetly said,<br>
  "I'm just a little shaken up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lit on father's head."</p>
<p>They turned the aged Chieftain  o'er,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a word he spoke;<br>
  Winona, was a solid girl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spinal cord was broke.<br>
  Winona and her lover then<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So lightly skipped away,<br>
  To seek fresh fields and pastures new,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spend their wedding day.</p>
<p>Now, Indians in their birch  canoes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At twilight paddle by,<br>
  And pause beneath the "Maiden's Rock"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear Winona's cry.<br>
  The dusky paddlers softly sing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as they glide along,<br>
  The "Wedding of Winona,"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the burden of their song.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Lachlan,  where the perfume from the pines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fills the glowing summer air, like incense spreading,<br>
  Where the silent, flowing river, like a bar of silver, shines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the winter moon its pallid beams is shedding.<br>
  In a hut on a selection, near a still and silent pool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived two mates, who used to shear, and fence, and  carry,<br>
  The one was known, both near and far, as Dandy Dan O'Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other, as Cornelius McSharry.</p>
<p>And they'd share each others blankets,  and each others horses ride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And go off together, shearing, in the summer;<br>
  They would canter off, from sunrise to the gloaming, side by side;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While McSharry rode the "Barb" and Dan the "Drummer."<br>
  And the boys about the Lachlan recognised it as a rule,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Eugowra to the plains of Wanandarry,<br>
  That, if ever love was stronger than McSharry's for O'Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas the love O'Toole extended to McSharry.</p>
<p>And their love might have  continued and been constant to the end,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they might have still been affable and jolly;<br>
  But they halted at a shanty, where the river takes a bend,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were waited on by Doolan's daughter, Polly.<br>
  Now, the pretty Polly Doolan was so natty, neat and cool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so pleasant, that they both agreed to tarry,<br>
  For she winked her dexter eye-lid at susceptible O'Toole<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she slyly winked the other at McSharry.</p>
<p>So they drank her health in  bumpers, till the rising of the moon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she had them both in bondage so completely,<br>
  That, each time they talked of going, she said "Must you go so soon?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they couldn't go: She smiled at them so sweetly.<br>
  Dan O'Toole grew sentimental, and McSharry played the fool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they both had sworn on oath they'd never marry.<br>
  Yet the selfsame dart from Cupid's bow that vanquished Dan O'Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had gone through the heart of honest Con McSharry.</p>
<p>Then McSharry thought, if Dandy  Dan got drunk and went to bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He (McSharry) could indulge his little folly.<br>
  And Dan thought, if McSharry once in drunken sleep lay spread,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have a little flirt with pretty Polly.<br>
  So they kept the bottle going, till they both were pretty full,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet each rival seemed inclined to tarry;<br>
  The precise amount of pain-killer it took to fill O'Toole<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was required to close the optics of McSharry.</p>
<p>So the rivals lost their tempers,  and they called each other names,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And disturbed the Doolan children from their pillows,<br>
  And so Doolan came and told them that he wouldn't have such games,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must go and fight it out beneath the willows.<br>
  So they went beneath the willows, near a deep and shady pool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With as much inside as each of them could carry,<br>
  And McSharry started thumping the proboscis of O'Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While O'Toole retaliated on McSharry.</p>
<p>And they fought till they were winded,  and yet neither had the best,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though, from each of them the blood was freely flowing;<br>
  And they paused at last to breathe a while, and take a moment's rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But O'Toole's two eyes with rage were faily glowing.<br>
  Then, without a moment's warning, he charged forward like a bull,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before poor Con had time to run or parry,<br>
  With a terrible momentum the big head of Dan O'Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went bump! into the stomach of McSharry.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300851h-images/page157.jpg" alt="page157" width="508" height="750"></h3>
<p>And the force of the concussion  laid McSharry out quite still,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his feet above his head among the bushes;<br>
  While O'Toole, with the momentum, cannoned madly down the hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fell plump in the lagoon among the rushes.<br>
  Like a weedy river-god he climbed the far side of the pool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he did not for one single moment tarry,<br>
  For the curse of Cain was in the brain of Dandy Dan O'Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who felt certain that he'd settled poor McSharry.</p>
<p>Now, while Dan O'Toole was  stealing through the still and silent night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his aching brain with pain-killer was throbbing,<br>
  McSharry lay and listened, till his heart grew sick with fright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he eased his guilty soul with silent sobbing.<br>
  For he heard his boon companion falling headlong in the pool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he thought he was as dead as poor old Harry.<br>
  And McSharry mourned the drowning of poor Dandy Dan O'Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While O'Toole was sadly weeping for McSharry.</p>
<p>And the valley of the Lachlan  never more will know the men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were once so loving, frolicsome and frisky,<br>
  For O'Toole cleared out to Queensland and was never seen again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While McSharry started South and took to whiskey.<br>
  And McSharry, in his nightmare, often sees the fatal pool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pricks of guilty conscience tries to parry;<br>
  While away among the back blocks wanders Dandy Dan O'Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always flying from the ghost of Con McSharry.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDreamofHarumScarum"></a>The Dream of Harum-Scarum</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>(With profuse apologies to the shade of Tom  Hood.)</i></p>
<p>'Twas near the chime of supper  time, the night was calm and cool,<br>
  As five and-twenty legislators bounded out of school.<br>
  And they sought the snug refreshment-room as tadpoles seek a pool.</p>
<p>And as they passed the jovial  glass their tongues all glibly ran,<br>
  Stones of the Democratic Arch, they gloried in its span,<br>
  But the "Keystone" sat remote from all, a melancholy man.</p>
<p>He wore a meek and crumpled look,  his voice was but a wheeze,<br>
  An air of care was on his brow, for his mind was ill at ease;<br>
  So he leaned his head on his hand and read the papers on his knees.</p>
<p>Sheaf after sheaf he turned them  o'er, nor ever glanced aside,<br>
  He read the cost of wild-cat schemes and the price of humbled pride;<br>
  He saw the ghosts of buried hopes, and wondered why they died.</p>
<p>Then leaping to his feet upright,  some moody turns he took,<br>
  He sought the Labour Members' room to find a quiet nook;<br>
  And, lo! he saw a swarthy man, who pored upon a book.</p>
<p>"Jimmy, my boy, what is't you  read? Some tale of bygone ages?<br>
  Or is it some new scheme to get less work for bigger wages?"<br>
  But Jimmy gave an upward glance: "'Tis Hansard's classic pages."</p>
<p>Six hasty strides the "Keystone"  took, as smit by Jimmy's glance,<br>
  Then slowly he came back to talk political romance;<br>
  And sitting down by Jimmy's side, he spoke about finance.</p>
<p>He told how Fat Men walk the earth  with stores of wealth untold,<br>
  All eager to invest it in a policy that's bold;<br>
  And how to prop the Sacred Arch he'd spent the Fat Man's gold.</p>
<p>"Ah, well," quoth he, "I know for  truth their wealth must be extreme;<br>
  It ought to keep on flowing in a vast perennial stream.<br>
  But, Jim, methought last night I killed the Fat Man in a dream.</p>
<p>"I did not use a knife or gun to  strike him stiff and cold,<br>
  I hit him with a policy that was both new and bold;<br>
  I guessed that that would lay him flat, and I could spend his gold.</p>
<p>"Two sudden blows with the Income  Tax and one with a Heavy Loan,<br>
  One extra squeeze with the Day-Work stroke and then the deed was done;<br>
  There was nothing lying at my feet but lifeless flesh and bone.</p>
<p>"Methought a crowd then gathered  round, from town and bush they came,<br>
  Ten thousand thousand unemployed, all crying out with blame;<br>
  I took the Fat Man by the hand and called upon his name.</p>
<p>"And, lo! from forth the famished  crowd, from starving child and wife,<br>
  There came a bitter, mournful cry that filled my ears with strife:<br>
  'Thou foolish man, take up thy dead and bring it back to life!'</p>
<p>"I took the Fat Man's body up and  bore it to a stream,<br>
  I bathed his brow with <i>Common Sense!</i> my fright was so extreme;<br>
  But Jim, my boy, remember this was nothing but a dream.</p>
<p>"For months I lived in agony, from  weary chime to chime,<br>
  The Arch, that stood so solid once was shaking all the time;<br>
  The very rock on which it stood seemed changing into slime.</p>
<p>"My only hope was now a loan, and  I resolved to try,<br>
  I called upon the Fat Man with a wild despairing cry;<br>
  But the Fat Man lay a heap of clay, and the stream of gold was dry.</p>
<p>"Then down I cast me on my face,  and first began to weep,<br>
  For I felt my billet then was one I could not hope to keep;<br>
  And I cursed the howling unemployed with curses loud and deep.</p>
<p>"And now that wretched, horrid  dream, pursues me while awake,<br>
  Again, again, with frenzied brain, the Fat Man's life I take;<br>
  And the constant wobbling of the Arch makes e'en the 'Keystone' shake.</p>
<p>"And still no peace from the  hungry throng will night or day allow;<br>
  The unemployed pursue my soul. They stand before me now!"<br>
  The frightened Jim looked up, and saw huge drops upon his brow.</p>
<p>That very night, while gentle  sleep Jim's tired eyes caressed,<br>
  The "Keystone" tumbled from the Arch, then down fell all the rest;<br>
  And Harum-Scarum lay beneath with the ruins on his chest.</p>

<p>As we travel Life's weary journey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plod through the gathering years,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er a pathway bedewed with tears.<br>
  If, perchance, for a fleeting moment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts should with rapture swell,<br>
  We have added but one more sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we bid the glad time "Farewell."</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispelled the dark gloom of night.<br>
  I have welcomed its bright rays stealing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over hill-top, and wood, and dell;<br>
  Yet, my joy was alloyed with sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I bade the bright stars "Farewell."</p>
<p>I have seen the red sun descending<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To its home in the glowing west,<br>
  Whilst the tremulous voice of nature<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was solemnly lulled to rest.<br>
  I have welcomed the stars, appearing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And greeted them one by one,<br>

  Farewell to the trees, and flowers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mountain, and stream, and dell,<br>

<p>Farewell to each earthly passion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To vanity, pride, and strife,<br>
  To jealousy, hate, and discord,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this vanishing dream, called life.<br>
  Ambition, nor glory, tempts me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To yield to their magic spell,<br>

<b>The Reflections and Reminiscences of Mrs. Bridget McSweeney</b></p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneysChristmas"></a>Mrs. McSweeney's Christmas</b></h2>
<p>"The great dhrawback to this  climate," said Mrs. McSweeney, as she ushered Mrs. Tacitus into the  drawing-room, "is that the hottest days all come in the summer, whin we could  do without 'em, and the cold ones in the winter, whin we don't want 'em. The  man at the conservatory that the Government pays to look afther the weather  just lets it do as it loikes, and thin we have cyclopses and torpedoes waltzing  round the counthry, blowin' people's houses down and ruinin' their complexions,  till we have as many koinds of weather in a day as would make the whole four  saysons and a bit over."</p>
<p>"And how did you spend your  Christmas?" said Mrs. Tacitus, as she seated herself on the couch, and made a  mental note of the cut of Mrs. McSweeney's new blouse.</p>
<p>"Don't ask me!" said Mrs.  McSweeney, "I've been that worried and upset, to say nothin' of me trouble and  expinse, that I don't care if we didn't have another Christmas fur the next six  months! Afther all me bother, to have me cake all dough is enough to vex me if  I was Saint Bridget herself. I shpared no expinse, and I put in nearly  everything that could be put into a cake, and I was tould thin that all I  wanted was a good slow fire. I put it in the oven to make shure before I lit  the fire, and thin I only lit a shmall one, and no fire could be much slower  nor that, unless it was out altogether.</p>
<p>"Me feelin's will not allow me to  tell you how I watched that cake, and me twins that throublesome that I was  nigh disthracted. It never rose a bit, and afther wastin' all the mornin' I  found it that heavy that you might have thought it was a fire brick. Pat seen  it, and felt the weight ov it, and says that he's considerin' whether he'll send  it to the Mines Departmint to get it assayed, or make a grindstone av it. I  thried to get hould of it, but he locked it up, and every person that has come  to me house this wake Pat says, afther wishin' thim the toime of day.</p>
<p>"'Come into me worrkshop till I  show ye the cake me ould woman made!'</p>
<p>"Thin away they go, and I hear him  say,</p>
<p>"'Phwat do ye think ov it? Fale  the weight ov it!'</p>
<p>"Just the remark he used to say  about one of me twins.</p>
<p>"'Fale the weight of it," says he,  and thin I can hear them laugh, and they come in and say,</p>
<p>"'Faith! it's a foine cake ye  made, Mrs. McSweeney.'</p>
<p>"One impudent puppy asked Pat how  he was going to divide it.</p>
<p>"'Sure,' says he, 'I suppose if we  have to break it up, a couple of wedges and a hammer would do it.'</p>
<p>"But the son of a witch said:</p>
<p>"'I don't think anything wud do it  except a charge of dianimite.'</p>
<p>"And there's Mrs. Maloney  a-sittin' on her balkinny, and to everybody that passes she says:</p>
<p>"'Good mornin'. It's a foine  mornin' don't ye think?' says she. 'Did ye hear about Mrs. McSweeney's cake?'</p>
<p>"I furrumly belave that she put a  gossoon that sells fruit up to throw me cake in me face. He knocked at me door  yesterday mornin', and he says, says he,</p>
<p>"'Any peaches or apricots? A penny  a dozen!'</p>
<p>"'No!' says I. 'I don't want yer  peaches, and it's loike yer chake to be knockin' at paple's doors widout bein'  asked.'</p>
<p>"'Ah! go on,' says he, 'Yer cake's  all dough!'</p>
<p>"'If you don't git outer me gate,'  says I, 'I'll throw the bucket at ye.'</p>
<p>"'I don't care so long as you  don't throw yer cake,' says he.</p>
<p>"We caught two rats in the thrap  last night. They both had their front tathe broken. Pat said they'd been  thrying to nibble me cake. It upset me that way that I lost me interest in the  festive sayson. I'm thankful to say that the Christmas holidays is over, and  barrin' a slight attack of biliousniss and the shkin palin' off me nose, I fale  none the worse of it.</p>
<p>"We had a quoite day on Christmas,  and nothin' out of the common, except the puddin' and the goose, which I bought  for a young wan, and which Pat said I must have got out of the Ark, as it was  the same goose that cackled when Nero was burnin' and Rome played the fiddle. I  didn't belave a word of it, as I put it down to Pat's awkwardness, he not bein'  used to carvin' poultry. He said the legs was as tough as if the goose was a  champion bicycle ridher, but he only said that becase I shcolded him for  shpillin' the gravy all over me best clane cloth, that caused a coldness  between us all the rist of the day.</p>
<p>"But the picnic was the thing!  Faith! We had a foine time at the picnic. It was on Boxing Day we had the  picnic. We left the twins at home with Mrs. O'Reilly. I put on me white muslin,  and the slaves were that thin that the sun burnt me arrums true it, though say  nothin' of the muskeeters. Pat had on a new soot, and a big basket full of all  sorts of things to ate and dhrink, and we were to mate Mr. and Mrs. Regan at  the Railway Stashion.</p>
<p>"Oh, the crowds that were there!  What wid the crowds a-comin' in and the crowds a-comin' out, and the railway  porthers takin' the skin off me shins wid the portmantels, and the hate, and  Pat upsettin' the basket on the platform, and wantin' to foight an old  gintleman that throd on a mate pie with grane shpeckles and made it onsightly,  besides awkward to carry, I was glad when we got to the Nashunel Park.</p>
<p>"We thried to find a shady place  to have lunch, but all the shady places were taken up by a lot of people, wid  no perliteness, mostly boys and girls that were carryin' on that way that they  ought to have been kept at home. We found a place at last, and Con Regan took  the billy to get some hot wather; but he had a long way to go, and he forgot to  take the tay and sugar wid him, so whin he got back the wather was too cold to  make tay, and it was too hot to drink it cold, and me dying for a dhrink tha  way that the sweat was pourin' out of me.</p>
<p>"The lunch was lovely, except that  the jam had got into the mate pie, and the gravy from the mate pie had got into  the plum pudden, and the cork had come out of the pickle bottle, and the  pickles was all mixed wid the bluemange. But, as Con Regan remarked, it had all  to go one way, and as we were all hungry, it was very good.</p>
<p>"Pat had brought a couple of  bottles of beer for himself and Con, and as we couldn't get any tay, I had just  a sup of the beer, which I'm not in the habit of, and between the sun and the  beer, Pat said I had two chakes on me loike the loights of a Glabe Point thram,  whoile he said me nose looked loike a Paddington thram.</p>
<p>"However, we gathered wild flowers  in the afthernoon, and got home at noight all roight, and Pat was a bit grumpy  because Con Regan asked me did I remimber the fun we had at the fair of  Ballyragin. However, Con sung 'Paddy Hagarthy's Leather Breeches,' and then I  gave them a bit of a jig while Con whistled 'The Wind that Shook the Barley,'  and we parted as good friends as ever, and after puttin' some vaseline on me  nose we wint to bed, and I dhreamed that I was dhrinkin' tay out of a beer  bottle in the Nashunel Park, and that all the sugar we had was mustard."</p>
<p>And Mrs. McSweeney went out to  make a cup of afternoon tea, while Mrs. Tacitus, glancing at Mrs. McSweeney's  new lace curtains, remarked <i>sotto voce</i>,  "Two and eleven the pair."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneysBike"></a>Mrs. McSweeney's Bike</b></h2>
<p>"The bane of middle loife," said  Mrs. McSweeney, as she passed the sugar to Mrs. Tacitus, "is fat."</p>
<p>"It is," said Mrs. Tacitus, as she  took two pieces of sugar, and noticed that Mrs. McSweeney was wearing a new  collarette.</p>
<p>"But is there no cure for it?"</p>
<p>"Well," replied Mrs. McSweeney,  "it is a long toime since I turned me thoughts to the devilopmint of me figger.  The bane of a perfect figger is fat, the remedy for fat is calesthanics, and  the best calesthanics is the bike. Now, you know, me dear, silf praise is not  me wakeness, but I may say that me physic is good, though me devilopmint is  such that I find it hard to presarve me cemetery. I have heard lately that all  the noicest people are takin' to the bicycle, and shure am I that an exorcise  that is fit for the King's daughters&mdash;God bless him! &mdash; is not unbecomin' to your  humble servant. So I sat down the other wake and indoited a small billydoo to a  firm in Sydney, asking for prices of a bicycle fit for a dacent female to ride.  I resaved in reply a catalog, and to me surprise I was tould to sind the lingth  of me leg and weight. The lingth of me leg I would reveal to no man, and I  think it the height of impidence to ask it; and as for the lingth of me weight  I did not know how to sind that, but shpeakin' to Mrs. Jackson on the subject,  she said it was me weight itself she required. I consulted me butcher, but he  said that his scales would only weigh twenty-eight pound of mate at a toime,  but the produce man weighed me, and found me corrict weight to be a thrifle  over two hundred and ten pounds aver-de-poy.</p>
<p>"I was waited on soon afther by a  smart young man, who said he came from the firm to see if he could git me  ordher. I informed him, wid the stoyle of dignity I can ashume so well, that if  the lingth of me leg was indispinsible I should renounce the idea. He tould me,  however, it was of no consequince, so we come to turms. I got me machane the  following day on toime paymint. Shure, it was a beautiful machane, and I  pictured the look that would be on Mrs. Maloney's face when she, would see me  glidin' gracefully down the sthrate. Sure, it was a proud day to me whin it was  delivered at me residence, wid its nickel-plated handles and patent rheumatic  toyres.</p>
<p>"I consulted wid me friend, Mrs.  Jackson, as to me costhume, and she said that the devoided skirt was  anasthetic, but that bloomers was the most <i>rekerky</i> (that's Frinch, ye know). So I wint wid her to a shop in town, and ordhered a  fine, light-blue bloomer costhume, thrimmed wid pink ribbins. Mrs. Jackson came  to help me dress, and I was rather surprised whin she said I was finished."</p>
<p>"'Where's the rist?' says I.</p>
<p>"'There is no rist,' says she,  'you've got 'em all on.'</p>
<p>"I felt as if there was something  wantin' about me lower extremities, but when I gazed at me profile in the glass  it was not bad. Mrs. Jackson said that the bould outline of me limbs would  dhrive Mrs. Moloney green wid envy, so I was satisfied. Her youngest boy,  Antonius, was houldin' me machane in front of the door, and I paused on me step  to fasten me gloves, bekase I knew that Mrs. Moloney &mdash;bad cess to her &mdash;was  papin' through her balkinny blind. I then tuk me green parasol from Mrs.  Jackson, and prepared to start. I whispered to Tony to hould her tight, and I  tuk me sate.</p>
<p>"'How do ye do it, Tony?' says I.</p>
<p>"'Jest put ye're fate on the threddles,  and let her go,' says he.</p>
<p>"'Hould on,' says I, for I had  dhropped me parasol.</p>
<p>"'Now,' says he, when I had got me  parasol, 'look out whin I give her a push.'</p>
<p>"'Hould on a minute,' says I.</p>
<p>"'Hould on you,' says he, and he  started the machane rollin'.</p>
<p>"Just then I seen young Moloney,  wid the red hair, standin' forninst me, like a danger-signal.</p>
<p>"'Git out o' me road,' says I.</p>
<p>"'Be the holy post, 'tis the  missin' link!' says he.</p>
<p>"Jist as he shpoke me machane took  a sudden turn, and before I could sthop I was layin' on the broad of me back  inside Mrs. Moloney's gate, and me limbs and me machane was that way entangled,  that if it hadn't been that Pat at that moment came up the sthrate, I don't  belave that I'd ever have been able to perform the operation of exthrication.  If I live to be a centurion I'll never forgit the look on Pat's face whin he  sthopped in front of Moloney's gate.</p>
<p>"'Phwat blatherin' nonsense is  this?' says he.</p>
<p>"'Sure,' says I, 'help me up, and  don't sthand stharin' like a pig in a fit.'</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300851h-images/page188.jpg" alt="page188" width="497" height="750"></h3>
<p>"Wid that he guv the machane a  wrinch, and I thought one of me limbs was broke. He banged the machane in the  gutter, and in a tone of acrimoniousness he said 'Go indoors and dhress  yerself.'</p>
<p>"'Pat,' says I, rising to me fate,  'is that the way so shpake to yer own lawful, wedded woife when she's in  throuble, and the eyes of envy and malice upon her' (for I seen Mrs. Moloney  grinnin' over the balkinny). Jest then, to let me know she was there, she says,  'Will ye koindly shut me gate, Mrs. McSweeney, whin ye've gathered up yer  machanes and things?' Then she added, in a tone of satire: 'Don't ye think the  Centennial Park 'ud be the best place to practice in?'</p>
<p>"'What do you mane,' says I, 'by  interferin' wid yer betters?'</p>
<p>"'Shut up!' says Pat, in a tone of  thunder. 'I'll have no more of this. I'm goin' to put me fut down on ye, and  kape it there! Get into the house this minit, and put on some clothes becomin'  a daycent famale woman.'</p>
<p>"I rose to me full hoight, and I  says to Pat: 'Pat,' says I:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Bridget  McSweeney is me name,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ireland is me nation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sydney it is me dwellin' place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;'</p>
<p>"Wid that he gev me a shove, and  seizin' me wid the grasp of a madman, he hurried me in a most unbecomin' manner  into me own door. Faith! it's small assistance I get from Pat in me endayvours  to kape up the thraditions of me ancesthry. Whin I tell him that me father's  great-uncle, on his mother's side, lived in a castle, he only whistles.</p>
<p>"I'm still payin' five shillins' a  wake to the collector. I've a bicycle to sell chape. It's nearly all there,  only some of the pieces that ought to be bint are shtraight, and those that  ought to be shtraight are bint. But it's a new machine, only used wanst.</p>
<p>"Ah!" sighed Mrs. McSweeney, after  a pause, "'Tis a quare wurruld, so it is. The only things you can depind on in  it is the conthradictions of it."</p>
<p>The last observation escaped the  notice of Mrs. Tacitus, whose mind was concentrated on an effort to decipher  the post-mark on a letter that was on Mrs. McSweeney's mantelpiece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneyHasHerFortuneTold"></a>Mrs. McSweeney Has Her Fortune Told</b></h2>
<p>"I was passing on my way to the  butcher's," said Mrs. Tacitus, as she sat in the easy chair and put her basket  on the hearth-rug, "so I thought I'd pop in and see if you went." And Mrs.  Tacitus thought she could detect the smell of spirits.</p>
<p>"I did," said Mrs. McSweeney,  opening the window and quietly closing the door of the chiffonnier. "I did. I  wint this mornin', and she's a wonder, so she is. 'Twas early whin I got there  &mdash;about tin. There were three ladies there thin, and one of them was so frindly  that we got quite confidential whin I tould her me throubles, she said I'd done  the right thing to come, as the cards could tell some wonderful things. She  said she come regular wanst a wake. She wint in before me.</p>
<p>"While I was waitin', all alone by  meself, I got as nervous as an old hen that's lost her chicks. I could have got  up and ran away, but while I was wondherin' whether to shtop or to go, a gurrl  came in and tould me it was my turn. I wint into a small room, and saw a dark  woman sittin' at a table.</p>
<p>"'Sit down, Mrs.&mdash;'</p>
<p>"'McSweeney,' says I, 'at your  service.'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' says she, 'I could have  tould you yer name, if ye hadn't interrupted.'</p>
<p>"Then she got some cards, and she  says, 'Will you shuffle them, Mrs. McSweeney?'</p>
<p>"So I took the cards and shuffled  them, though me hands thrembled to that extent I could hardly hould thim. Then  she spread thim in a row, and closed her eyes, and I looked at her across the  table. Then she said in a solemn voice,</p>
<p>"'Mrs. McSweeney,' says she, 'to  show ye that I am no imposther I will revale to you some of the past. You can  then judge of me correctness. Ye had onions for breakfast.'</p>
<p>"And sure enough I couldn't deny  it, although how she knew I never could find out. Then she said&mdash;</p>
<p>"'You have a husband, and he is an  Irishman.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' says I, bridlin' up like,  'and sure he's none the worse for that.'</p>
<p>"'I didn't say he was,' says she,  'but am I right?'</p>
<p>"'You are,' says I, 'although,  bein' a sthranger, I don't know how ye can tell these things!'</p>
<p>"'It's on the cards,' she says,  solemnly. Thin she shuffled the cards, and laid thim out in little hapes.</p>
<p>"'There's throuble,' she says,  solemnly, 'ye have an inimy.'</p>
<p>"'That's Mrs. Moloney,' says I.</p>
<p>"'It's a female inimy,' says she  as she shuffled the cards again.</p>
<p>"Thin she tould me that I was born  far away across the say, that I had had a lot of throuble, but that I had more  throuble forninst me in the future. That I was in a delicate state of health,  but I would be all right again whin me throuble was over. That me husband would  make money, but he'd come to a sudden ind and lave me a widder. That me  accomplishmints would athract a rich squather, and that I should make a thrip  in a big ship across the say. That I should live as long as several of me  ancesthry, and that I needn't be afraid of anything bein' the mather wid me so  long as I kept up me health and strength. She said there was a dark man  a-frettin' out his soul fer me, and to beware of a fair woman wid a mole on her  chake. She said there was money on the say fer me, and that if the ship didn't  go down, I'd git it.</p>
<p>"She charged me half-a-crown, and  I come away moighty plazed. I felt a bit flustered whin I got home, and didn't  fale meself till I took a dhrop of whiskey wid a little wather in it. Perhaps  you would loike a shmall taste yourself? It is not often I take it, but I foind  it shtimulatin' whin I do."</p>
<p>Mrs. Tacitus said she couldn't  refuse the kind invitation of her friend, so Mrs. McSweeney closed the window  and opened the door of the chiffonnier. Mrs. Tacitus pledged her friend with  love and "best respects." She then picked up her basket, and as she did so,  remarked to herself that Mrs. McSweeney's carpet was getting very shabby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneysSpringCleaning"></a>Mrs. McSweeney's Spring Cleaning</b></h2>
<p>"Faith! it must be nice to be a  man," said Mrs. McSweeney, as she passed the biscuit barrel to Mrs. Tacitus,  "wid nothin' in the wurruld to do but go to yer wurruk in the mornin' and come  home agin at night to amuse yerself wid choppin' wood and doin' up the garden.  A man's loife rowls along as smooth as a pat of buther round a hot fryin' pan,  while a woman do be frettin' and slavin', washin' and ironin', wid shpring  clanin' thrown in, three or four times a year. 'Twould be good fer the men if  they sometimes had to seek relaxation from the timptation of dissipation by  ingagin' in the occupation of domistication."</p>
<p>And Mrs. McSweeney poured out a  second cup of tea for herself and her friend, while Mrs. Tacitus quietly felt  the texture of Mrs. McSweeney's new tablecloth.</p>
<p>"Such a toime I've had since I saw  you last. My limbs are that stiff I can't sit down, and whin I do, I can't get  up again. I've been havin' me spring clanins. On Monday last I sent fer Mrs.  O'Reilly, who goes out clanin' be the day, an' I says to her,</p>
<p>"'Mrs. O'Reilly,' says I, 'I am  goin' to go right through the house. We'll take up the carpets and bate thim,  and clane the house from top to bottom. We'll wash the curtains, and clane the  bidsteads, and wash the paint, and put everything noice and toidy.'</p>
<p>"So we put all the chairs in the  hall, and the beds on the stairs, and threw the carpets out of the windy, and  put the wardrobe on the balkinny, and were jist in the thick of it, and me wid  a towel round me head to kape off the dirt, whin there came a ring at the bell.</p>
<p>"I said to Mrs. O'Reilly, 'I'll go  to the door,' and I wint, and an ugly gossoon was there, and asked me 'did I  want to buy a sewing machane?'</p>
<p>"'I don't,' says I, as I banged  the door in his face.</p>
<p>"Well, I tuk a bucket of wather in  me hand, and had got half-way upstairs again, whin there came another ring at  the bell.</p>
<p>"'Bad luck to the bell!' says I,  and I put down the bucket on the stairs and opened the door again.</p>
<p>"'Do yer want any pertaters?' says  a spalpeen wid a red head.</p>
<p>"'I don't,' says I. 'To the devil  wid you and yer pertaties, ringin' people's bells!'</p>
<p>"'Yer needn't to shnap me head  off,' says he.</p>
<p>"'Do ye call that thing a head?'  says I.</p>
<p>"'It's as good as yours,' says he,  'barrin' the turban.'</p>
<p>"'The phwat?' says I.</p>
<p>"'The turban,' says he (alludin'  to the towel I had on). Then he added 'Go and ask yer Missus does she want any  pertaters; a bob a quarter. Take 'em in and show her.'</p>
<p>"'Phwat do ye take me for?' says  I.</p>
<p>"'I wouldn't take yer at any price,'  says he.</p>
<p>"'If yer don't take yer fut out of  me door,' says I, 'I'll squaze yer toes off.' So wid that the impident puppy  purtended to sneeze in me face, and he wint away singin' 'Oh! Molly Reilly, I  Love You.'</p>
<p>"So I wint into the kitchen to see  if the fire was all right, and the bell rung again. So I sung out to Mrs.  O'Reilly,</p>
<p>"'Tell 'em over the balkinny that  I don't want any,' and then the blessed bell rung again. She sung out again,  'Bad luck to ye, will ye go away out of that?' she says, 'whin I tell ye we  don't want any.' Wid that I heerd a millifluous voice inquire 'Is Mrs.  McSweeney in?' and I thought I should have dhropped whin I recognised the voice  of Father Roonan. So I shlipped into the dhrawin-room, and tuk the towel off me  head, and opened the door to his reverence. Just as I was openin' the door, I  see Mrs. O'Reilly on the landin' wid a big bundle of sheets and curtains and  things, and I sung out, 'Mind the bed!' Father Roonan smoiled swately, and says  'Phwat bed?' says he, as he enthered and shuk hands wid me.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300851h-images/page200.jpg" alt="page188" width="546" height="750"></h3>
<p>"Me warnin' was too late, for the  wurruds were scarcely out of me mouth, when Mrs. O'Reilly throd on the bed and  turned head and heels over it, right foreninst his reverence, and landed wid  her fate in the bucket of wather I had left standin' on the stairs. She moight  have recovered her balance, only the bed cum rollin' afther her and knocked her  over again, and then Mrs. O'Reilly and the bed and the bucket, and the bundle of  washin' all came rollin' down the stairs, and you couldn't tell which was the  bed and which was the bucket, and which was the washin' and which was Mrs.  O'Reilly; but the bed got down first, and Mrs. O'Reilly turned a summerset over  it, jest for all the wurruld like the clowns in the circus, and landed between  two chairs, right at the fate of Father Roonan. I shut the door as soon as I  could, and as I shut who should I see but Mrs. Moloney sittin' on her balkinny  and laughin' fit to shake herself into a thousand pieces. I know me face was as  red as the sun in a fog, and Father Roonan was laughin' fit to burst as he  helped me to straiten Mrs. O'Reilly, who was mixed up that way wid the chairs  that we had a job to exthricate her. She wasn't hurt, but she was dhrenched  from top to bottom, and forgettin' that the chairs was in the hall, I asked his  reverence to sit down in the dhrawin'-room while I wint to get some dhry  clothes for Mrs. O'Reilly. His reverence didn't sthay long, as he had only  called to pass the toime of day, and I made a cup of tay, and me and Mrs.  O'Reilly was jest havin' it in the kitchen whin the door bell rang again.</p>
<p>"'Och!' says I, 'let thim ring.  It's not Father Roonan this time, any way.' So we wint on wid our tay, and the  bell rang again and again, till I thought they'd break the wire. So I jumped  quite desperate up from me tay, and sayzin' a dipper of wather in me hand, I  wint to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>"'Take that!' says I, as I threw  the wather. You may guess me falins whin I discovered, just in toime to be too  late, that it was Pat! Didn't he roar? Didn't he swear? Oh! I thought he'd tear  the house down wid langwidge not fit to repate, and he in a hurry to go and  catch a thrain, and swearin' all the whoile he was changin' his shirt. But we  finished the clanin', and I locked the dhrawin'-room door and hid the kay, and  forgot where I hid it, so that it won't get disarranged. But, och! I'll never  forget the sight of Mrs. O'Reilly, and I'll never see Father Roonan widout  blushin' at the remimbrance of it. Will you take another cup, Mrs. Tacitus?"</p>
<p>"No thank you, dear," said Mrs.  Tacitus, "I have done splendidly." And Mrs. Tacitus kissed Mrs. McSweeney, and  took her leave. As she passed out of the front gate one of Mrs. McSweeney's  boys came in. She smiled sweetly at the child, and noticed that his trousers  were made from a pair of his father's old ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneysTwins"></a>Mrs. McSweeney's Twins</b></h2>
<p>"Take a glass of wine and a pace  of cake, Mrs. Tacitus," said Mrs. McSweeney, when Mrs. Tacitus had taken off  her gloves and deposited her umbrella in the hall-stand. "'Tis the birthday of  me twins."</p>
<p>So Mrs. Tacitus took a glass of  wine and a piece of cake, wished the dear children many happy returns of the  day, and made a mental note of the fact that Mrs. McSweeney had a new hair  buckle, which must have cost at least one and fourpence.</p>
<p>"God bless them!" said Mrs.  McSweeney, "they're good children, though I say it as shouldn't, bein' the  mother of 'em both. But the throuble I've had wid them children you'd never  belave. Me first throuble came in namin' 'em. They was me first, and I niver  properly knew the grate difficulty of choosin' names fur children until those  twins was born. I had often remarked and expatriated on the rediculosity of  paple givin' names to their helpless progenitors, that hang round their necks  for the rist of their lives like a milestone. I have seen a man called  'Samson,' who wasn't sthrong enough to lift a red herrin' off a gridiron; and a  man called 'Solomon,' who hadn't got sinse enough to come in out of the rain.  Such cases as these may be due to accident, but where a child, through no fault  of his parents, has to go through loife wid such a name as Jones, it is the  fault of his parents if he is called 'Jack' Jones. Others, again, may be due to  unfortunate devilopments. Like Mrs. Jackson's niece, who was christened 'Wild  Rose,' and aftherwards married a clergyman named Bull, and became 'Wild Bull.'  When the duty devolved upon me to choose names fer me twins, I made me moind up  to be exthra careful. I consulted me friend, Mrs. Jackson, and afther I had  gone through the History of England and Ireland, Moore's Almanack and The  Police News, some numbers of Comic Cuts and The Gardener's Chronicle, I had a  list as long as a pawnbroker's conscience. I could have got some beautiful  names from The Gardener's Chronicle if they'd only been gurruls. Well, to make  a long story short, I decided at last to call the ouldest of the twins  Demetrius Angelus, and the youngest Reginald Augustus. I chose these names as  bein' quiet and gentale, and not too high-soundin'. Whin Pat cum home to lunch  I tould him phwat I had decided, and expected him to be plazed wid me, but he  wasn't. He said the names wasn't Irish enough, and he wanted the ouldest one  called afther him.</p>
<p>"'I always made up me moind,' says  he, 'that if ever I had a son, and especially if he should happen to be an  eldest son, that I'd call him Pat.'"</p>
<p>"'You won't if I know it,' says I.  'Sure, every gossoon is called Pat nowadays.'</p>
<p>"'And maybe,' says he, wid a  shneer, 'every Pat's a gossoon?'</p>
<p>"'I didn't mane it that way,' says  I, fer I cud see he was losin' his timper. 'And, indade, ye can't help yer  name. But they're my children, and I'm goin' to name them.'</p>
<p>"'And maybe,' says Pat, sthill  flarin' up &mdash;'maybe they ain't my children?'</p>
<p>"'Phwat!' says I, beginning to  flare up to, 'Can ye say such a thing as that to me? Look at the noses on 'em,  the poor, dear lambs.'</p>
<p>"And he looked at the noses of 'em  as they lay shlapin' pacefully, side by side, and he was satisfied. Pat cud  niver look at thim widout wantin to kiss thim, and he was bindin' over to do  it, and he not shaven fur three days. I didn't want to wake thim, so I thried  to blush and said, 'Shure, ye can kiss me insthead.' And sure enough he did.  And thin he said 'Well, we won't fall out about it. Have yer own way. Only I  would have loiked the eldest boy named afther his dad.' So I gave him a hug,  and it was settled.</p>
<p>"'The names is roight enough,'  says he, afther a pause, 'only they don't sound very Irish.'</p>
<p>"'And faith,' says I, 'isn't  McSweeney Irish enough fur anything?'</p>
<p>"'Thrue for ye,' says he.</p>
<p>"See how noice their initials will  look when I mark them on their linen and things,' says I, beginning to wroite  them down.</p>
<p>'There's D. fur Demetrius, A. fur Angelus, and M. fur McSweeney,'  says Pat. That's D.A.M. dam.'</p>
<p>"And thin Pat stharted to wroite  down, too, and he says, mimickin' loike &mdash;'There's R. for Reginald, A. fur  Augustus, and M. fur McSweeney. That's R.A.M. ram.' And he stharted laughin'  till I thought that he'd take a fit.</p>
<p>"'Oh!' says he, 'Ye're a ganius at  choosin' names. Faith! we must wake 'em up now. Here,' says he, between his  lafture &mdash;'Dam and Ram, wake up and see how noice ye'll sound in yer bran new  names.'</p>
<p>"'Sure, Pat,' says I, 'Don't make  fun of me. I throid to do me best fur the dear darlins', but I didn't think of  the initials. Lave off laughin' at me, and ye can call them phwat you loike.'</p>
<p>"'All right,' says he, 'that's a  bargain. I'll lave off laughin', and we'll call them Pat and Mike.'</p>
<p>"So he kissed me again, and off he  wint to his work, and that's all I got fur all me throuble.</p>
<p>"Well, afther me unfortunate  misthake in the choosin' of me children's names, I had to consint to the  unavoidable, and let thim be christened Pat and Mike. Pat was moighty particular  about the eldest one bein' called afther him.</p>
<p>"'Sure,' says I to him, 'there's  only about tin minutes difference betwixt them, and what does it mather?'</p>
<p>"'I don't care,' says he, 'if  there was only tin siconds. Do you think I am goin' to allow me eldest son to  be done out of his pathrimonial rights?'</p>
<p>"'Which is the eldest of them?'  says I.</p>
<p>"'Divil a know I know,' says he,  scratchin' his head and lookin' at the two darlins' as they lay in their cot.  'Shure, they're so much alike that I can't tell the other from which; but they  say a mother can always tell the difference.'</p>
<p>"'Well, it's lucky,' says I, 'that  I kept tally of 'em. When the little darlins' was born Mrs. O'Reilly put a red  shawl round the eldest one, and so we knew him, although Mrs. Jackson said it  was the youngest one. But as Mrs. O'Reilly offered to take her Bible oath that  she was nearly sure she wasn't mistaken, we put a green ribbin round the waste  of the one that had the red shawl on. And that's how we know him to be the  oldest.'</p>
<p>"'But where's the green ribbin  now?' says Pat.</p>
<p>"'Oh! I left it off,' says I,  'bekase the youngest one got a pimple on his nose, and whin I look at them I  know he can't be the oldest, and thin I guess the other one's the oldest.'</p>
<p>"So we got Father Roonan to name  thim, and we told him the names, which he said was highly euphonius, which  partly reconciled me to me disappointmint.</p>
<p>"'Which is to be Pat?' says he.</p>
<p>"'The oldest one,' says Pat.</p>
<p>"'And which is the oldest one?'  says Father Roonan.</p>
<p>"'Faith!' says I, 'there's one of 'em  has a pimple on his nose.'</p>
<p>"'I see him,' says he. 'I name you  Pat.'"</p>
<p>"'Hould on, Father dear!' says I.  'Is that the one wid the pimple?'</p>
<p>"'It is,' says he. 'Look at it.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' says I, 'that's the one  that's not the one.'</p>
<p>"'What do you mane?' asked Father  Roonan. 'Didn't you tell me the one wid the pimple?'</p>
<p>"'I meant,' says I, 'beggin' yer  riverence's pardon, that when you got the one wid the pimple, that one wasn't  him.'</p>
<p>"'Wasn't who?' says he, wid a  twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>"'Wasn't Pat, yer riverence.'</p>
<p>"'Are we to understand,' says his  riverence, 'That the one widout the pimple is to be called Pat?'</p>
<p>"'That's it,' says Pat, 'he's the  oldest of 'em.'</p>
<p>"'Faith, I thought so,' says his  riverence, 'from his likeness to his father.'</p>
<p>"Pat looked plazed, and the  christenin' was finished, and we all wint home as plazed as cud be, although I  had to take a dhrop of whiskey, wid a little water in it, whin I got home,  owing to the fright I got at Pat, junior, nearly losin' his pathrimony. Well,  we had a party in the evenin', and had a great time, although I haven't got  time to tell ye all about it. About tin o'clock one of Pat's friends cum in,  and he says to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Come here till I show ye me  oldest son, till ye see if he's loike his father!'</p>
<p>"He told Mrs. O'Reilly to fetch  little Pat, and whin she brought him, he says, 'Shure, that's not him, that's  the ugly gossoon wid the pimple. Bring the other one.' So she brought the other  one, and Pat, who had had a whiskey or two, yelled at the poor woman and says, 'Bring  the other one!'</p>
<p>"'Shure, there's only two of  thim,' says poor Mrs. O'Reilly.</p>
<p>"'The divil's curse to ye!' says  Pat. 'I know there's only two, but I want the other one!'</p>
<p>"'This is the other one,' says  she. Wid that Mrs. Jackson brought the other one, and as I'm a livin' sinner,  they both had pimples on their noses! And now, if we were to be all skinned  alive, we don't know which is Pat and which is Mike. If we only knew which was  the oldest, we'd know he was Pat, or if we could find out which was the youngest  we'd know he wasn't the oldest, and thin we could find out which was Pat.  Meanwhile, Pat, senior, was ragin' like a ravin' lunatic, and me cryin' me eyes  out. I asked Father Roonan if they could be christened again, but he said he  didn't think that would settle it unless they were born again. What to do we  didn't know, and it was nigh being the cause of a separation, but at last we  decided that as Mike got his pimple first, he'd be likely to lose it first and  so whichever lost his pimple first should be Mike. Well, would you belave it,  the very next Sunday mornin' whin we got up, there wasn't a thrace of a pimple  on either of 'em. And so to the present toime we don't rightly know which is  Pat and which is Mike. It was only last night that I heard Mrs. Moloney  shpakin' to her next door neighbour from her balkinny, and she said, in a tone  of sarcasm&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I don't thry to hould me head as  high as some paple, but I know me eldest boy whin I say him. There's a poor  woman, not a mile away from here, that looks down on her bethers, and yet, when  she sees her eldest son, she don't know whether it's him or his brother.'</p>
<p>"Take another glass of wine, Mrs.  Tacitus?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, my dear, I will," said  Mrs. Tacitus, "and then I must be going." So saying, she proceeded to put on  her gloves, and decided in her own mind that the port wine had cost  eighteen-pence per bottle.</p>

<p>"'Tis a foine day, so it is," said  Mrs. McSweeney, as she handed the plate of scones to Mrs. Tacitus.</p>
<p>"It is, indeed," said Mrs.  Tacitus, as she took two scones and made a mental note of the fact that Mrs.  McSweeney's skirt had been turned and dyed.</p>
<p>"How did you enjoy yourself on  Saturday?"</p>
<p>"Enjoy meself, is it?" answered  Mrs. McSweeney, with a slight suspicion of scorn in her voice. "Enjoy meself,  did you say?"</p>
<p>Then stirring her tea in a pensive  manner, and throwing the tea-cosy at the cat that was preparing to make a bed  of her best antimacassar, she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was a beautiful afthernoon,  last Sathurday, whin I consinted, in a foolish moment, to go for a thrip to the  Hawkesbury. Pat and I had an early lunch of pork chops and onions, and wid me  best muslin, fresh ironed, and me new hat wid the roses, I felt quite happy and  nautical as the sthame boat glided down the harbour, and the band (two fiddles,  a cornet and a harp) played "A Loife on the Ocean Wave.'</p>
<p>"'Twas a great crowd there was on  the boat, and as we approached the place they called the Heads, they were all  laughing and talking as lively as young colts in a clover patch. There was a  young gentleman near me that had two young ladies wid him, in a pair of white  duck throusers and a blue coat wid a sthraw hat, pointin' out the different  places we come to. He looked so noice and nate, wid his waxed moustache, that I  thought he must be a captain or left tenant at laste.</p>
<p>"'That's Pinchgut,' says he, and  he shmoiled till he showed a row of teeth as white as the dhriven shnow.</p>
<p>"'And that's Bradley's Head, and  yonder is Watson's Bay.' And he twirled his moustache until the two inds shtuck  out like two mate skewers. Whin we come to the Heads the ship began to lift up  and down, and I could hardly shtand, and the young gintleman smoiled and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Oh! you'll be all right, mam,  whin ye get yer say legs on.'</p>
<p>"I thought his remark was rather  rude, so I purtinded not to hear him, and looked over to where somebody said  there was a sow and some pigs, but I didn't see any. Just then a big wave  sthruck the ship, and nearly knocked her over, and I says to Pat, 'Hould me,  Pat,' says I, 'I'm afraid I'll fall."</p>
<p>"'Oh!' says the young man wid the  waxed moustache, grippin' hold of a post, 'It'll be all right whin ye get yer  say legs on. That's the &mdash;eh &mdash;the loite ship,' says he.</p>
<p>"Well, the ship began to rock about  that way I thought me head 'ud shplit.</p>
<p>"'Oh, Pat!' says I, 'for the love  of Heaven,' says I, 'Ask the captain to kape the ship from wobbling.'</p>
<p>"Just thin I heard one of the  young ladies say, 'Oh! ain't it just lovely?' Her companion didn't answer her,  and I was just goin' to give her a look of witherin' sarcasm, whin the ship  heaved agin &mdash;and so did I.</p>
<p>"'Oh!' says I, 'I want to go  ashore, Pat. I fale so bad. Ask the captain to let me go back.'</p>
<p>"Pat said the captain would only  laugh at him, and said I wouldn't be sick if I'd kape me mouth shut. Then the  ship gave a bigger lurch than ever, and the young man wid the waxed moustache  said, 'Oh, it'll be all roight whin ye get yer say legs &mdash;.' But just thin he  began to slither, and as he couldn't rache the post, he went head furst into  the harp, and the harp knocked over the cornet, and the cornet bumped into the  only fiddler that was playin', and thin all of thim fell on top of the other  fiddler that was looking over the soide of the ship, that pale as if he'd seen  the ghost of his grandmother in the wather. And thin they all scrambled to  their fate, the young man in the waxed moustache was lanin' on the side of the  ship. His sthraw hat was missin', the wax was all gone out of his moustache,  his white duck pants was dirty, and he was all limp, and just looked as if he'd  been washed out and never rinsed, and thin fell off the line into the mud, and  somebody had picked him up and flung him on a fence to dhry.</p>
<p>"And all the toime the ship kept  rollin' about, this way and that way. She reminded me of Pat whin he comes home  from a meetin' of the Buffyloes. And there was the young min and the gurrls all  gettin' mixed, and shlitherin' this way and the other if they was all on roller  skates. Some was laughin' and some was shcreamin', some was groanin', and  everybody was holdin' on to everybody else. Such a confusion I never heard  since Dooley's cow ran into the tinker's shop in the market place in Sligo. I  was throyin' to kape me mouth shut, and Pat standin' by, wid his hands in his  pockets, a-shmokin' his poipe as if nothin' in the wurruld was the matter. I  was so mad at the unconcarned look of him that I forgot meself and said, 'Pat!'  It was all I said. But I'd opened me mouth, and I couldn't shut it. The ship  tipped up all to one side, and I found meself runnin', and I couldn't sthop  till I sthopped wid me two arrums round the neck of the young man in the  moustache, and I fale ashamed every toime I think of the state of his white  duck pants &mdash;but I couldn't help it.</p>
<p>"What loike is the Hawkesbury I  don't know. I remimber Pat takin' me into a sthuffy place they called a cabin,  and givin' me some brandy and soda. I sat on the flure with me new ironed  muslin, while a big woman in a red blouse made a convanience of me new hat. It  seemed about tin years that I'd been lyin' there whin Pat came and said we was  back in the Harbour. He was rowlin' about, and he said he had his say legs on  and cudn't get shot of 'em. And I was such a wreck you never saw; me muslin was  shpoiled, me hat was ruined, me hair was down, and me false front that cost  siven-and-six, I never seen from that day to this. The shtewardess had hair the  same colour as mine, but Heaven forbid that I should have any suspicion of her,  for she tinded me loike a mother. Pat had to get a cab to bring me home, and me  cup of misery was overflowin' whin I was layin' on me bed, wid a bottle of  o-de-colone in me hand, some vinegar and brown paper on me head, and a bottle  of soda-water by me soide. The balkinny door was open to let the air in, and I  heard Mrs. Moloney, from her balkinny, remark to some person in the sthrate:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Did you see Mrs. McSweeney since  she wint to say? Oh! the sight she is! The sun has brought out all the  freckles, and the salt wather has made her that limp that poor Mr. McSweeney  had to carry her up and put her to bed. Poor man! 'Tis small wondher he has the  lumbagy. You can't wondher at him takin' a dhrop now and again.'"</p>
<p>"Well, I must be going, dear,"  said Mrs. Tacitus.</p>
<p>"And I must go and look afther  that gurrul or she'll burn the jint," said Mrs. McSweeney as she preceded Mrs.  Tacitus to the door.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Tacitus passed through the  hall she sniffed, and as Mrs. McSweeney closed the door after her she murmured,  "Hash!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneyatHome"></a>Mrs. McSweeney at Home</b></h2>
<p>"Thry a ginger nut," said Mrs.  McSweeney.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my dear, I will," said  Mrs. Tacitus, helping herself to a handful of ginger-nuts, as she wondered  where Mrs. McSweeney had got the new d'oyley.</p>
<p>"'Tis an age since I saw ye,"  remarked Mrs. McSweeney, fanning herself with a serviette. "And I've been that  worried wid me domestic and social jooties that I'm loike one av me own twins,  and don't know whether I'm meself or some other person. 'Twas last Monday was a  fortnight since I wint into a dhraper's shop to buy a box of hair-curlers, and  to thry to match the loinin' of a new dhress I was makin' out of the one that  got shpoiled on me thrip to the Hawkesbury, when who should be there but Mrs.  Delaney, whose husband is working at the gas works &mdash;buyin' a couple of yards of  Torchon.</p>
<p>"'Good day to you,' says she, 'and  how's the twins?'</p>
<p>"'They are as well as can be,'  says I, 'barrin' that one has a slight influenzy, and the other has a black eye  through fightin' young Moloney. I haven't sane ye for an age,' says I.</p>
<p>"'Why don't ye come on me day at  home?' says she, and she gave me a card on which was printed:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2300851h-images/page222a.jpg" alt="page222a" width="653" height="329"></p>
<p>"I promised I would, and she bade  me good-day. Now, this set me thinkin', and as one moight as well be out of the  wurruld as out of the fashion, I made up me moind that I'd have me day at home,  too. So I got some cards printed, which said as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2300851h-images/page222b.jpg" alt="page222b" width="650" height="360"></p>
<p>"So the first Wednesday in last  wake I prepared to resave me guests. Not havin' a gurrl nor a lady help, I got  Mrs. O'Reilly to come round for the afthernoon. I wanted to manage the thing  properly, for I knew that some of me friends would only come to see phwat they could  see, and to pick holes in me arrangements; and so I made some tay, and some  sandwiches, and got some cake and biscuits, and a couple of pounds of jam roll  and some ice crame, and a little dhrop of spirits in a decanther in the  dinin'-room in case anybody should fale inclined to "take a little wine for  their stomachs' ache,' as the prophet says. I dhressed meself in me new  o-de-neel muslin, wid the puffed slaves, and a pink belt wid a large silver  buckle, wid yellow gloves, and takin' me fan in one hand and me shmall cambric  handkerchief in the other, I tuk me sate about two o'clock, and dhrapin' me  skirt to the best advantage, I waited fer me visitors.</p>
<p>"I had arranged wid Mrs. O'Reilly  to look afther the things in the kitchen, and to admit me visitors. Mrs.  Jackson ran over before dinner and did me hair, and tould me I looked charmin',  and that no one would take me to be the mother of twins. I sat waitin' for  about three-quarters of an hour, till me arrums and legs were that cramped that  me carves seemed to be tied in a knot, and me not likin' to move for fear I'd  shpoil the dhrapin' of me dhress, whin a ring comes to me door. I was all pins  and needles as I sat listenin' for Mrs. O'Reilly to come and open the door, and  she clatherin' the things about in the kitchen, and takin' no notice of the  bell, through bein' deaf in one ear and not hearin' very well with the other.  Then the bell rang again, and I felt as if I was sittin' on a hants' nest,  until I heard her comin' along the hall. She poked her head into the door and  said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Have anybody come yet?'</p>
<p>"'There's been somebody ringin'  the bell this half-hour,' says I. 'Woipe that black off yer nose and open the  door, and show them in, and be careful to denounce them in the way I tould ye.'  So she opened the door, and sthranin' me ears to listen I heard somebody say,</p>
<p>"'Do ye want a noice load of  wood?'</p>
<p>"She said we didn't, and shut the  door.</p>
<p>"'Mrs. O'Reilly,' says I, 'Would  ye moind sittin' in the doinin'-room until the visitors have all arrived, so  that you can hear the bell?'</p>
<p>"She said, 'Very well, mum,' and  she wint and sat in the doinin'-room, which is separated from the dhrawin-room  by a pair of damascus curtains. The furst to arrive was Mrs. Jackson, and soon  aftherwards came fat Mrs. O'Grady and her two daughters. Mrs. O'Reilly opened  the door and denounced thim, and we chatted about the weather, and the  children, and our husbands, and the neighbours, and things. Afther we had  exhausted all the usual thropics of the day, I was fidgetted by seein' Mrs. O'Reilly  pokin' her head through the curtains, and makin' faces as if she was thryin' to  say somethin' widout makin' a noise. Not wishin' to move for fear of spoilin'  me pose, and she not takin' any notice of me frownin' at her, and thinkin'  somethin' might be wrong wid the twins, I said at last wid as much composion as  I could ashume, 'Do ye want to shpake to me, Mrs. O'Reilly?'</p>
<p>"'I do,' says she, 'but I don't  want everybody to hear. Where do you kape the lump sugar?'</p>
<p>"Now, I didn't want the O'Grady's  to know that I didn't kape a servant regular, and that was the rayson why I was  afther buyin' Mrs. O'Reilly a cap wid muslin sthrings, and so I said, 'Shure,  you ought to know. It's on the cheffoneer in the doinin'-room, behind the  silver tay sit.' There was no silver tay sit, but I said it to make Mrs.  O'Grady woild, for she had never been in me doinin'-room and would know no  bether, so I said 'Behind the silver tay sit,' in a low voice that I knew Mrs.  O'Reilly wouldn't hear; thin I added in a louder voice, 'We'll wait and say if  any more ladies come before we serve the collation.' Includin' Mrs. Jackson,  that you could hardly call a visitor, we had only four, and two of thim was  bits of gurls, and I had provided for twinty. Well, we sat and yawned and  looked at one another until me limbs was jumpin' agin through sittin' shtill,  so I resolved to wait no longer.</p>
<p>"'Bring up the collation, Mrs.  O'Reilly,' says I.</p>
<p>"Afther waitin' some toime and  gettin' no response, I called again; and still, afther waitin' a long toime and  listenin', I got no reply, so thryin' to divert the oppressive silence that was  hangin' loike a wet blanket about us, I said, 'Would either of you loike a  taste of spirits?'</p>
<p>"'It's no use sayin' one thing and  manin' another,' said Mrs. Jackson, 'I would.'</p>
<p>"'And so would I,' says Mrs.  O'Grady, wid a sigh of relafe.</p>
<p>"So raisin' me voice to its  highest pitch, I shouted, 'Mrs. O'Reilly!' Shtill I could get no answer, and  not bein' able to shtand sittin' in one position any longer, I jumped up at  risk of shpoilin' me pose, and dashed into the doinin' room loike a volcano.  The soight that met me gaze I'll never forget as long as I remimber. There,  ferninst me on the table, was the decanter full of nothin' but emptiness. By  the side of it was a glass and a sugar basin, and Mrs. O'Reilly not to be sane,  except the chair that she'd been sittin' in, and the two legs of her  a-shtickin' out from underneath the table. I pulled her out and propped her up  wid her back agin the chimbley-pace, and her hair hangin' down over her face,  and her muslin cap hangin' down loike a bib, when she blinked her eyes, and  says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Spasms! Mrs. McSweeney. Spasms!'</p>
<p>"'Git up out av that, ye drunken  baste!' says I, 'And git out av me house this minute, if not sooner!'</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300851h-images/page229.jpg" alt="page229" width="530" height="750"></h3>
<p>"She thried to get on her fate,  and to assist her risin' she caught the tablecloth, and before I could shtop  it, away it came, and down, wid a crash, wint me decanter, the glass, the sugar  basin, and a case of stuffed birds wid a glass shade that Pat won in a heart  union, valued at twinty-foive shillins'; and Mrs. O'Reilly fell on her back,  wid a stuffed parrakeet perched on her nose. Just at that very moment, whin I  thought that the cup of me degradation was full up to its last gasp, and that  it would burst me bosom, I seen Mrs. O'Grady poke her head through the  cartains, and she says in a swate tone of bitter sarcasm, 'Don't bother, Mrs.  McSweeney, we must be goin' now, as we have to call and pass the toime of day  wid Mrs. Moloney.' I sat down and cried till you could have rung the tears from  me o-de-neel, and whin I wint to change there was that vampire, Mrs. Moloney,  biddin' Mrs. O'Grady an' her two daughters good-bye, and the whole of thim  lookin' over at me house and laughin' as if they'd bust. On me nixt day at home  I shall go to the gardens or somewhere to be out of the way. Mrs. O'Reilly  niver darkens me door again."</p>
<p>Mrs. McSweeney sighed, and Mrs.  Tacitus sighed in sympathy.</p>
<p>Mrs. McSweeney ran out to see if  the kettle was boiling over, and Mrs. Tacitus lifted a flower-pot that stood on  the table, and was gratified to find that her suspicions were correct. It had  been placed there to cover a hole in the table-cover.</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful day," remarked  Mrs. Tacitus, as she entered the dining-room, and noticed that three of Mrs.  McSweeney's Austrian chairs had been re-caned.</p>
<p>"It is indade a foine day,"  answered Mrs. McSweeney. "It is weather loike this that makes one fale glad to  be aloive. It minds me of the toime whin I was a gurrul, chasin' the pigs out  of the potato field on me father's farrum at Ballyragin. Shure, thim was happy  days, whin I had no social jooties to worry me, no twins and no shneerin',  shquintin' neighbours acastin' reflections on me from their balkinnies! Whin I  think of thim days I am remoinded of the poet who said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I wish, I wish, but all in vain,  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I was a maid again. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a maid again I'll never be, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till pumpkin grows  on apple tree.'</p>
<p>"But wait till I tell you all  about me surproise party. Little did I think I'd ever live to see the day  whin me friends would all assimble at me humble dwellin' in the evenin' and  give me a shpontaneous surproise party. Thruly does the poet say that it is the  unexpected that happens, and that at the toime whin we are not lookin' for it.</p>
<p>"About a fortnight ago Mrs.  Jackson came to see me one day, and she says, 'Mrs. McSweeney, says she, 'can  ye kape a sacret?'</p>
<p>"'Of course I can,' says I. 'Did  ye ever know a woman that couldn't?'</p>
<p>"'Well, I don't know that I did,'  she says. 'I know I wouldn't revale a sacret if I died, except to me most  intimate friends.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' says I, 'And phwat's the  sacret ye have?'</p>
<p>"'You won't tell it?' she says.</p>
<p>"'No,' says I.</p>
<p>"'Well, then, we're goin' to give  ye a surproise party.'</p>
<p>"'And phwat's that?' says I.</p>
<p>"'Why, a lot of yer friends are  goin' to come round some night and bring a lot of things to ate and dhrink, and  we're goin' to have great toimes.'</p>
<p>"'And whin is it to be?' says I.</p>
<p>"'On Thursday noight, about eight  o'clock,' she says.</p>
<p>"She had no sooner gone than in  came Mrs. Regan &mdash;and she tould me the sacret. And then I heard it from Mrs.  Delaney, and Mrs. Smith, and siveral others, and by Thursday noight I'd heard  it from about fourteen of 'em, and they aiche made me promise not to say a  wurrud about it. So whin Thursday noight came I had me  dhrawin'-room all noice and toidy, and some fresh flowers in the vases, and  afther Mrs. Jackson had done me hair, and I had put on me new white muslin, wid  the green sash and pink fishoo, I tuk me sate on the sofy and a book, and  lookin' fur all the wurruld as if I expected nobody. I waited to be surproised.  I didn't have long to wait, for about eight o'clock I heard some whisperin' and  laughin' outside, and a ring came to me bell. Pat had gone out, and so I opened  the door, and they all walked in.</p>
<p>"'We've come to have a party,'  says Mrs. Jackson.</p>
<p>"'Well!' says I, 'I was never more  surproised in me loife!'</p>
<p>"'I'm so glad,' said Mrs. Jackson.  'I thought you would be.'</p>
<p>"'And so did I,' said Mrs. Regan.</p>
<p>"'And so did we,' added Mrs.  Delaney and Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>"They set out the pervisions in  the doinin'-room, and we found that Mrs. Jackson had brought some biscuits,  Mrs. Regan some bananas, Mrs. Delaney some biscuits, Mrs. Smith some bananas,  Miss Delaney some bananas and her young man, and I thought I'd have doid with  lafture whin we found that those that had not brought bananas had brought  biscuits, and divil a thing had they got amongst sixteen of 'em but bananas and  biscuits, and an odd young man or two. However, I tould thim not to moind, as I  happened to have a little thing or two in the house. So thin they began to  enjoy thimselves, and they took the couch and aisy chairs on to the verandah to  make more room, and put all the other things in a corner, so as to have a  dance, and Miss Delaney had her music wid her, and played and sang, 'I Would I  Were a Bird.' Her young man sang 'Will of the Wisp,' and he had such a big voice  that there wasn't room enough for it in me dhrawin'-room, and ould Delaney and  Con Regan wint outside, and whin he came to the part where he says, 'Mark their  fright' I could hear the glasses in the doinin'-room jingle again. Thin they  tuk the carpet up and put it in the hall, and had a dance; and thin we had  supper, and ould Delaney proposed me health in bumpers wid tears in his eyes,  and thin Con Regan proposed Pat's health, and Miss Delaney's young man proposed  the 'Chairman,' Mr. Delaney, and Mr. Delaney responded and proposed the  'Ladies.' Mrs. Smith's eldest son was asked to respond to the toast of the  'Ladies,' and he did so in the following way:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Ladies and gintlemen!' says he.  'I am goin' to respond for the ladies, and propose the twins &mdash; God bless 'em &mdash;  I mane both the ladies and the twins. What should we do widout 'em, gentlemen?  I mane the ladies. They cook for us, and darn for us, and sing to us, and play  to us, and sometimes they play the divil wid us. Whin I see them, sittin' like  two cherubs on the wash-house roof, a-shmokin' brown paper and peltin' banana  skins at the Chinamen &mdash;I mane the twins &mdash; I think how proud Mrs. McSweeney must  be of 'em. And I hope we may all be as fortunate as Mrs. McSweeney &mdash;I mane the  ladies &mdash;and I hope that they may grow up to become great men &mdash;I mane the twins  &mdash;and that we may all live long and die happy, for, as the song says, "They are  the joy of our lives" &mdash;I mane the ladies.'</p>
<p>"He sat down amid thremendous  applause, and wavin' of handkerchiefs, and ould Delaney said he was proud of  him (for he was courtin' Delaney's youngest daughter.) And thin Con Regan  started to sing 'He's a Jolly Good Fellow,' whin I thought me heart was in me  mouth, for I heard such a clather in the hall that it sounded loike as if a  load of bricks had been tipped on the floor. I ran out to see phwat was the  mather, and there I see Pat lyin' on his face wid the hall-shtand on top of  him.</p>

<p>"It sames he had come in and  thripped over the dhrawin'-room carpet that was folded up in the hall, and in  fallin' had knocked over the hall-shtand, that had made a lump on the back of  his head as big as a wather-melon. He was spacheless wid insensibility, and  when Con Regan and Delaney carried him into the dhrawin'-room, and tuk his  collar off, and he never opened his eyes to say a wurrud, I thought it would be  widder's weeds I'd be wantin, and me only afther buyin' a new hat wid pink  flowers the day before. They bathed his face wid wather, and rubbed his hands,  and it was all no good, until Delaney said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Do you think he cud take a dhrop  of whiskey?'</p>
<p>"'He couldn't take whiskey the way  he is,' said Con Regan.</p>
<p>"'You're a liar!' said Pat, as he  opened his eyes.</p>
<p>"Well, we got him to bed afther a  toime, although we had a job to perswade him to move, as he laid wid his head  on Mrs. Regan's lap, and she rubbin' his hands, while Con poured the whiskey  into him. When he was safe in bed, they all bid me goodnight, and it was three  o'clock in the mornin' before I was able to shut the front door, through the  couch gettin' shtuck in the enthrance, and me wid no one to give me a lift.</p>
<p>"Pat's head was achin' a bit the  next mornin'. He said it was the knock he got. I think the whiskey had somethin'  to do wid it. I'd thought he'd be in a great timper, but he wasn't. He said  he'd take a knock loike it again every noight, if he could lay his head in Mrs.  Regan's lap and have the whiskey poured into him. It's all over now, but it was  a grand surproise party. Mrs. Moloney must have heard the music and the singin'  and the lafture, but I don't think she knows of Pat's bump. For three days  afther the party, she sat on her balkinny wid her head rapped up, purtindin' to  have a cold in the head, and lookin' about as happy as a pig wid the yellow  janders. 'Tis surproisin' the way some paple invy other paple's good fortune.  And must you go so soon, shure?"</p>
<p>"Yes dear," replied Mrs. Tacitus.</p>
<p>She kissed Mrs. McSweeney, and, in  passing, rubbed her finger on the chiffonnier to see whether it had any dust on  it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneysPhotograph"></a>Mrs. McSweeney's Photograph</b></h2>
<p>"Ye're just in time," said Mrs.  McSweeney, as she removed the tea-cosy and poured out the tea. "Shure! a taste  of shpirits in it 'ul do ye no harrum this afthernoon."</p>
<p>"Only just a taste," replied Mrs.  Tacitus, as she noticed that Mrs. McSweeney had some new cups and saucers. "I  hear you have had your photo taken.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. McSweeney. "In  a momint of wakeness, and in response to the pressin' solicitations of me  innumerable friends, acquaintances, and others, I reluctantly consinted to get  me photo tuk. Whin I say reluctantly, I don't want you to misundersthand me. I  am not ashamed of the linimints that Nature has given me, and if me shtoyle of  beauty differs from phwat they call the classical, it is more in quantity than quality.  It would ill become me to flather meself, but the truth is not flathery. I  moind the toime whin I'd get heaps of flathery widout havin' to do it meself,  and even now, Pat is sometoimes jealous at the way the young fellows shtare  whin we go out widout the twins, and me wid me new Sunday clothes on, and the  combinations of colours that set off me proportions to the bist advantage. Me  reluctance is caused by me modesty, which in the wurruds of the poet, would  rather 'under-rate the charms I have than claim the others that I have not  got.' Yet, though I say it meself, ye could foind many a wurse lookin' face in  Paddy's Market on a Sathurday noight than Bridget McSweeney's. So, as me  friends samed so anxious, I thought it over, and the contimplation of the twins  decoided me. I, therefore, made up me moind to conquer me natural modesty and  timidity, and to hand the liniments down to me ancesthors. So I wint to a  foinelookin' place in George Sthrate, just between the Railway Station and the  Circular Quay, and shpoke to a young lady that was a-sittin' at a little desk:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Is this where you get your photo  tuk?' says I.</p>
<p>"'It is,' says she, shmoilin'  shwately.</p>
<p>"'Phwat do ye charge,' says I,  'for a sthraight-out photo widout any flathery?'</p>
<p>"'Siven-and-six a dozen fur  cabinets,' says she.</p>
<p>"'I said photos,' says I, calmly  but severely, 'not cabinets.'</p>
<p>"'Well, it's all the same,' says  the young lady, 'Cabinets is the size of 'em.'</p>
<p>"So she showed me the soize, and I  said I'd be tuk. She asked me to sit in the waitin'-room, and guv me some  pictures to look at.</p>
<p>"'A wonderful thing is  photography,' says she.</p>
<p>"'It is,' says I.</p>
<p>"'Look at the X-rays,' says she.</p>
<p>"'Where are they?' says I, lookin'  round the room.</p>
<p>"'Oh! we haven't them here,' says  she, shmoilin', 'but we have some pictures taken by them. Here is one. It is  Mr. * &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s hand.'</p>
<p class="note">* The reader may here fill in the  name of any prominent politician or local magnate.</p>
<p>"'Is it now?' says I. 'Shure,  nobody would think that was Mr. *&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s hand. It don't look like it.'</p>
<p>"'No,' she says, 'You see, when  anybody shows your hand widout the rays, you only see phwat is on the surface.  The X-rays shows phwat is underneath the surface.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' I says, examinin' the  picture again, 'I don't think the X-rays brings it all out. There is more in  Mr. *&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s hand than you can see there.' Then I added, afther a pause, 'Do you  think the X-rays would show you phwat eh has up his slave?</p>
<p>"'I don't know,' says she.</p>
<p>"'Well, then,' says I, 'I can tell  you. The X-rays may be very good. You might be able to see through most men wid  'em. You might even see through *&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; wid 'em in two or three looks, but ye'll  never see through * &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; wid 'em. And if, in addition to the X-rays, ye get all  the Y-Z rays, ye'll not be able to see phwat he has up his slave?'</p>
<p>"'Phwat do you think he has?' says  she.</p>
<p>"'Devil a know I know,' says I,  'but you may be sure that he has somethin' else in his slave besides the  loinin'. You moind me now!'</p>
<p>"Then she showed me into phwat she  called the shtudy-oh, and as she shut the door I found meself all alone wid a  man. He bowed politely, and in shpoite of me nervousness I did not forget to  remimber me good breedin', and I returned his politeness.</p>
<p>"'Will you take a sate, mam?' says  he.</p>
<p>"'I will,' says I, 'Thankin' you  koindly. It's toirin' shtandin' afther washin' all the mornin' and a heavy wash  too &mdash;four shirts, three blouses and a lot of coloured things, besides two pairs  of blankets and a quilt, which I had to rince over again, through the loine  breakin'.'</p>
<p>"'How would you loike it?' says  he. 'Full length, three-quarther, or the bust only?'</p>
<p>"'Shure!' says I to him, 'Phwad 'ud  be the good of takin' me bust only?'</p>
<p>"He smoiled and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Oh! of course your face would be  in wid it!'</p>
<p>"'In wid phwat?' says I.</p>
<p>"'Wid the bust,' says he.</p>
<p>"'Well, I don't want it in wid me  bust,' says I. 'I want it where it is.'</p>
<p>"'It'll be all roight,' says he,  'Wait till I get me focus.'</p>
<p>"So he wint up to the thing he  called his focus, which looked somethin' loike a three-legged shtool wid a pair  of bellows on top, and afther turnin' it about, he says, 'Now it's all roight.  Would you loike to look through it?'</p>
<p>"I said I would as he was so  perloite, and he sat in a chair whoile I looked at him through the focus, and  shure! I couldn't belave me eyes, for he was upside down.'</p>
<p>"'You've got your focus the wrong  way up!' says I.</p>
<p>"'Oh! it's all roight,' says he,  laughin'.</p>
<p>"'And do you think,' says I, 'that  I'm goin' to sit in that chair and allow a man to look at ME upside down? No!'  says I, 'I'd sooner let me ancestors go widout me liniments for ever and ever.'</p>
<p>"'It's always done that way,' he  says, 'And it won't take a minute, and you'll be roight soid up whin its  finished.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' says I, as a compromise,  'Will ye shut your eyes whin yer look?'</p>
<p>"'I will,' says he.</p>
<p>"'Well thin foire away,' says I.  'But moind, if I catch ye at any tricks, although I'm only a lone faymale, I'll  stuff you into your focus and throw you out of the window,' I says, 'And you'll  get thrampled under the fate of the omnibusses,' says I,''till they won't be  able to tell which is you and which is the focus.'</p>
<p>"He got white and said that, 'If I  preferred it he would not look at all. He'd chance it.' So he gave me a book to  hould in one hand, a fan and a big bunch of flowers to hould in the other, and  I sat down in the chair. He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Are you ready? Kape shtill!'</p>
<p>"And thin somethin' gave a click,  and he said it was all roight and I came away. I got me photos yesterday. I  didn't loike them much, because, although they're not upsoide down, the big bunch  of flowers is hidin' me face. Pat says he thinks that's an improvement, but he  is no judge. Mrs. Jackson says it is more loike me than I am loike meself.</p>
<p>"I was walkin' down past the place  where I had me photo tuk this mornin', and I saw they had one shtuck outside,  and some boys was lookin' at it.</p>
<p>"'That's Charley's Aunt,' says  one.</p>
<p>"How he knew that me brother  Barney had a boy called Charley, and he away in Ireland, and me only havin' the  news by the last mail, and only a few loines and fivepence to pay, I couldn't  say. It showed the loikeness, however, and I shmoiled at the boy, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I'm glad you loike 'em!'</p>
<p>"'Hulloh!' says he, laughin' to  his friend.</p>
<p>"'Phwat price?'</p>
<p>"'Seven-and-six a dozen,' says I.</p>
<p>"He laughed again, and I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"So you knew me poor brother  Barney, did you?'</p>
<p>"'Oh!' says he to his friend,  'Come along; she's got 'em!'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' says I, 'I got 'em this  mornin'; a dozen of 'em.'</p>
<p>"'A dozen phwat?' says he.</p>
<p>"'Photos,' says I.</p>
<p>"'Rats!' says he.</p>
<p>"Wid that I could see that he was  only makin' fun of me.</p>
<p>"'Ye impident shpalpeen!' says I,  'How dare ye thry to make fun of yer bethers?'</p>
<p>"'Oh! give us a rest!' says he.</p>
<p>"'I'll give ye,' says I, 'A prod  in the jaw wid me umbrella!' says I.</p>
<p>"'Ye're Irish!' says he.</p>
<p>"Wid that I made a poke at him,  but he shlipped away, and the pint of me umbrella shtuck into a shtout  gentleman's waistcoat, which made him cough that way that his langwidge was not  fit for a daycent woman to hear.</p>
<p>"And can I have this one?' said  Mrs. Tacitus.</p>
<p>"You can then, and welcome," said  Mrs. McSweeney.</p>
<p>And Mrs. Tacitus, vowing she would  never part with it, kissed Mrs. McSweeney and went away resolving to post the  photo to Mrs. Moloney that very night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneyAboutaDog"></a>Mrs. McSweeney About a Dog</b></h2>
<p>"Good afthernoon to yer," said  Mrs. McSweeney, as she got out another cup and saucer for Mrs. Tacitus, "And  how's the neuralgy?"</p>
<p>"It is slightly better, thank you,  dear," replied Mrs. Tacitus, as she drew her chair up to the table, noticing at  the same time that Mrs. McSweeney's blouse had a rent under the armpit.</p>
<p>"I have been that worried since I  seen ye last," continued Mrs. McSweeney, as she sweetened Mrs. Tacitus' tea,  "That me nerves is like a ball of woosted that the cat's been playin' wid. It  was all about a dog, a dog that you wouldn't give a threepenny-bit for, if  there wasn't another dog in the wurruld, even for breedin' purposes. I had had  a heavy wash last Monday, and the copper fire, conthrary, and the smuts blowin'  that way that it would vex a saint, and me limbs achin' as if I'd been thrashed  wid a bamboo. So I laid down to take forty winks afther lunch. I'd hardly got  into me first doze whin Mrs. O'Reilly shouted to tell me I was wanted in the  back yard. Whin I got out I saw a polaceman, lookin' over the fence.</p>
<p>"'Is yer dog registered, Mrs.  McSweeney?' says he.</p>
<p>"'Faith! Divil a dog have I at  all,' says I.</p>
<p>"'Phwat's that?' says he, pointin'  to a corner of the yard.</p>
<p>"'That's a dog,' says I, 'by the  look of it.'</p>
<p>"'Well, is it registered?' says  he.</p>
<p>"'How do I know?' says I, 'Shure,  it's no dog of mine.</p>
<p>"'Oh! we're used to that,' says  he, as he made a note in his book.</p>
<p>"So I got the clothes-prop, and I  gave the dog a prod, and I says, 'Whisht! Git out of that!' And thin I found it  was that thafe of a dog that belongs to Mrs. Moloney. I knew him at once, for,  by the token, he lost part of his tail, through the butcher at the corner  throwin' a knife at him whin he was walkin' off wid a sthring of sausages. Pat  says he's a rough-haired black and white fox terrier, wid a bit of the  blood-hound in him. Anyway, whin I prodded him with the clothes-prop, he dodged  through a hole in the fince into the nixt yard, and I wint back to me nap. I  thought no more about it till the nixt day, whin I was served wid a summons to  attind the polace court to answer to a charge of not registherin' a dog. I  consulted Pat, and wanted him to go, but he said he couldn't neglict his work.</p>
<p>"'But phwat am I to say?' says I.</p>
<p>"'Oh!' he says. 'You can plade all  sorts of things. Say the dog wasn't yours, or that it was under age, or that it  was dead, or anything like that. You can plade as many things as you loike, and  the more ye plade the hardher will it be fur thim to prove it. So I attinded  the court. There was a big crowd there, and there was somebody there from  everyone of the six houses in our terrace. Jobson, the publican at the corner,  was the first one called.</p>
<p>"'You are charged,' says the clerk  of the court, 'wid havin' an unregistered dog on yer premises. How do ye  plade?'</p>
<p>"'The dog wasn't mine, yer  Washup.'</p>
<p>"'Swear Constable Finnigan,' says  the clerk.</p>
<p>"So Constable Finnigan stated that  he saw a dog in Jobson's yard. It was a fox terrier.</p>
<p>"'Have ye got yer receipt?' says  the clerk.</p>
<p>"'No!' says Jobson. 'I tell ye the  dog&mdash;'</p>
<p>"'Tin shillin's, and  four-and-tinpence costs,' says his Washup.</p>
<p>"'But&mdash;' says Jobson.</p>
<p>"'Livy and disthress,' says his  Washup. 'Nixt case!'</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith was charged nixt. On  bein' charged, she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Plaze yer Washup, I don't own no  dog.'</p>
<p>"'Swear Constable Finnigan,' says  the clerk.</p>
<p>"Constable Finnigan stated that he  saw a dog in defindint's yard. It was a rough-coated terrier, wid a shtumpy  tail.</p>
<p>"'Where's yer husband?' says his  Washup.</p>
<p>"'He's up at the Macquarie  fossickin',' says Mrs. Smith, 'And I've five children, and we haven't had a  bite of feed in the house this two days.'</p>
<p>"'Tin shillin's and  four-and-tinpence costs,' says his Washup.</p>
<p>"'But plaze yer Washup,' says Mrs.  Smith, burstin' into tears.</p>
<p>"'Livy and disthress,' says his  Washup, blowin' his nose. 'Nixt case!'</p>
<p>"The nixt one called was Miss  Tomkins, who said she never had a dog, and couldn't abear the soight of one.  Constable Finnigan said he saw a dog in her yard on the day mintioned. It was a  cross between a fox terrier and a blood-hound.</p>
<p>"'Tin shillin's and  four-and-tinpence costs. Nixt case!'</p>
<p>"Mrs. Mulligan was nixt called.  She had the same defince. Constable Finnigan stated that he saw a dog in the  yard; it was a&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Tin shillin's and costs!' says  his Washup. 'Nixt case!'</p>
<p>"'Bridget McSweeney!' says the  clerk.</p>
<p>"'I'm here,' says I.</p>
<p>"'How do ye plade?' says he.</p>
<p>"I plade,' says I, 'That it was  Moloney's dog, and if it wasn't Moloney's dog it wasn't mine, and if it was it  was not six months old, and if it was it died of old age twelve months ago nixt  Anniversary Day, and if it didn't it wasn't there, and if it was there it was  registhered. Now!' says I, 'Put that in your poipe and schmoke it!'</p>
<p>"'Can ye prove it was  registhered?' says he.</p>
<p>"'Can ye prove it wasn't?' says I.</p>
<p>"'You mustn't spake loike that to  the coort,' says his Washup. 'Call Constable Finnigan.'</p>
<p>"'But, yer Woshup!' says I, 'I'm a  daycent married&mdash;'</p>
<p>"'Silence!' shouted the clerk of  the court, and Constable Finnigan was sworn. He stated that on the day in  quistion he saw in the defindant's yard a full-bred blood-hound wid a shtumpy  tail.</p>
<p>"'Tin shillin's and costs!' says  his Washup.</p>
<p>"'I'm a daycent married woman,'  says I, 'and have enough to do lookin' afther me twins and me house wurruk  widout kapin' an apology for a dog wid no tail to shpake of.'</p>
<p>"'Livy and disthress,' says his  Woshup. 'Nixt case! Nixt case!'</p>
<p>"But I came away thin, and whin we  got outside the coort, we found that it was Mrs. Moloney's dog that was in  Jobson's yard, and he threw it over the fince whin the polaceman had gone, and  Mrs. Smith threw a boot at it, and it ran through the fince into Miss Tomkins.  Whin the polaceman called there she hunted it out of her back gate, and whoile  the officer was writin' in his book it run into Mrs. Mulligan's yard. She dhrove  it into my yard, and I prodded it wid the clothes-prop, and it wint into Jones'  yard, and whoile we was talkin' out comes Jones, and said he had been foined  too, and all for Moloney's dog. And of course Mrs. Moloney hadn't been summoned  at all. I seen Mrs. Smith at the distance, and I wint and shpoke to her. I  said, 'I'd loike to have the combin' of the hair of that hard-hearted wretch  for foinin' you, and yer children hungry.'</p>
<p>"'Ah! Mrs. McSweeney,' says she,  'Don't abuse the good man. He has to administher the law, and if the law's an  ass he can't help it. God bless him! He sint a polaceman out wid a sovereign,  and a message that I was to pay the foine and kape the change. If he  administhers law and justice wid one hand he dispenses charity and mercy wid  the other. God bless him!'</p>
<p>"So I came home. I forgave his  Washup, but I'm kapin' me eye open for Mrs. Moloney's dog. 'Tis for that I kape  the broom on the kitchen table, a bucket of wather near the front door, and a  brick undher me pillow. If I catch him in me yard agin I'll give him such a  batin' that he won't shtop runnin' and shqualin' till he falls over the South  Head and encumbers the Pacific Ocean wid his carcase."</p>
<p>"No more, thank you!' said Mrs.  Tacitus, as Mrs. McSweeney reached for her cup. "I must be going now." And she  brushed the crumbs from her lap, kissed Mrs. McSweeney, and took her departure,  wondering as she went up the street what had become of the vase that used to  stand on Mrs. McSweeney's side table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneyOnClubs"></a>Mrs. McSweeney On Clubs</b></h2>
<p>"You're not looking well, Mrs.  McSweeney," remarked Mrs. Tacitus, as she took her seat in the kitchen, where  Mrs. McSweeney was busy making pastry. "Don't mention it, dear; I don't mind  sitting in the kitchen," she continued, as she speculated as to the price of Mrs.  McSweeney's new preserving pan.</p>
<p>"I've been purty well, barrin' a  sinkin' falin' due to the worry of me domestic affairs," replied Mrs.  McSweeney, in answer to the first remark of Mrs. Tacitus. "Whin Pat won the  three hundred pounds in the swape I thought me luck was in, but I never  shpeculated on the way he'd alther. I don't know phwat's comin' over him, for  iver since that toime he's been as big in the head as a newly elected mimber of  Parlymint, and he is gettin' no bether every day.</p>
<p>"First he bought a watch, and thin  a chain. Nixt he wasted his money in a lot of dingle-um-dangle-ums, to hang at  the ind of the chain. A wake or two afther that he must buy a ring for his  little finger, no less. The nixt thing he did was to shave off his beard, and  as he lift nothin' but a moustache he reminded me of the man that used to  shtand outside the fotygraffer's shop, sayin', 'This stoyle fourpince,' wid a  big hat. Thin he'd want hot wather two or three toimes a wake, and it 'ud be,  'Where's me razor? Where's me shtrop? and where's me shavin' pot?' to say  nothin' of the way he'd schrub me whin he had about two days' growth on. Thin  he tuk to wearin' starched shirts every day, which I'm sure I wouldn't loike to  do this hot weather, havin' as many as four in the wash in one wake.</p>
<p>"This was all bad enough, but I  lost me patience one night last wake. I wint to bed early, and was just in me  first slape &mdash;that I call me beauty slape&mdash; bein' phwat I rely on for me  complexion. I'd had a late supper &mdash;just a shlice of roast pork wid some  cucumber and onions, a bit of toasted cheese and a couple of bananas, and I was  dhramin' a shwate dhrame. I thought I was a flyin'-fox, and that I was flyin'  about from tree to tree, dhressed in a pink mervelow and a green sunshade, whin  I seen Mrs. Moloney shtandin' under one of the trees wid an air of  vindictiveness and a gun. I thried to schrame, but me tongue was tied up by the  roots, for I thought that ivery minit would be me nixt. She pointed the gun at  me, and says, 'I'll taiche you to be puttin' yerself above yer naybours,' says  she. Just then she fired, wid a noise loike a thunderclap, and I woke up and  found meself alone in me bed aclaspin' the bedpost wid the shweat oozin' from  every pore.</p>
<p>"Before I had time to calm me  falins' and collect me scathered sinses, I heard a noise at the front door. I  listened, and there was a-schrapin', and thin a bump, and thin more schrapin'  and more bumpin'. Thin there was a pause, durin' which I could here me heart  thumpin' agin me ribs loike a billy-goat agin a barn door, and thin I heard Pat  say to himself loike, 'Who the blazes has shifted the kay-hole?' So whin I knew  it was him, I just shlipped down in me wrapper wid the transparent yoke, and  opened the door.</p>
<p>"'Is that you, Biddy?' says he.</p>
<p>"'It is,' says I. 'Phwat do ye  mane by comin' home this time of noight, makin' a noise and frightenin' the  naybours?'</p>
<p>"'Who the blazes has shifted the  kay-hole?' says he.</p>
<p>"'I wondher you're not ashamed to  be sane in the moonlight,' says I, 'the way ye are.'</p>
<p>"'Shure!' says he, 'I'm all  roight, Biddy, me ould gal, Bid. But I've dhropped me kay, and somebody's  shifted the kay-hole.'</p>
<p>"He wouldn't come in till he found  his kay; so, as there was nobody about, I just shtepped out on to the verandah  to look for it. It was a foine night, and the moon was shoinin' bright, as the  poet says, and jist as I shtipped out, Pat says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Whist!' says he, 'There it is  agin!' And he wint down on his hands and knees on me flower bed.</p>
<p>"'There's phwat?' says I.</p>
<p>"'Begorra! I've got it,' says he.  Thin he added, 'No, I ain't.'</p>
<p>"'Got phwat?' says I, wid me  wrapper flyin' in the breeze.</p>
<p>"'There it is again!' he says,  reachin' out and breakin' me polyanthus.</p>
<p>"'Don't ye see it,' he says.</p>
<p>"So I wint to see phwat he was  grabbin' at and hoppin' around afther, and if he wasn't chasin' the shadow of  the branch of a tree that was wavin' in the moonlight. Wid considherable  throuble and inconvanience, owin' to me bare fate, I got him up, whin he thried  to shteady himself by the handle of the door, and pulled it to; and there I  was, in nothin' but me wrapper wid the transparent yoke, out on the verandah,  and the wind that cold that I thought I'd get me death, and me fate freezin'  wid the joo. I'll not tell you exactly phwat I said to him, fur I was a bit mixed,  more by token, because I heard the twins begin to sing out fer me at the same  minute. The only thing Pat did was to sit on the gas mater, wid his hat all on  one side. Whin I remonsthrated he only laughed and sang:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I heard some paple comin' up the  sthrate, and just then Pat sthruck a match fur me to foind the kay, and me the  way I was. However, I got the kay, and wint to bed, and left him to follow. I  thought he'd never get up, fur ivery shtep he came up he shlipped down two.  Whin at lingth he did get upshtairs, I says to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'And pray, phwat sort of place  have ye been in till this hour in the mornin'?'</p>
<p>"'At me club,' says he.</p>
<p>"'And phwat's a club?' says I.</p>
<p>"'It's a place,' says he, 'Where  men go to polish up their intellecks, by friction wid other intellecks, where  they injy a quiet game at shnooker and poker wid kindred shpirits, or discuss  the ivints of the day; and where they don't get interrupted by any blatherin'  faymales.'</p>
<p>"'The more's the pity,' says I,  'That they haven't somebody to help them to kape sthraight.'</p>
<p>"'If it wasn't for the wimin,'  says he, 'the min 'ud be always sthraight.'</p>
<p>"'If it wasn't for the wimin,' says  I, 'And you wid yer clubs and yer intellecks, and these sort of things in yer  pocket,' says I, as I produced to his gaze the fotygraff of a faymale, wid  hardly anythin' on, that he'd dhropped out of his coat pocket.</p>
<p>"'Is that a woman?' says I.</p>
<p>"'It looks loike one,' says he.</p>
<p>"'Tell me where to foind her?'  says I, clinchin' me fists.</p>
<p>"'Oh! it's only off a  packashigaritz,' says he.</p>
<p>"'I don't belave a word of it,'  says I. But he wint on singin':&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are the bhoys that make the  noise <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Royal Artilleree!'</p>
<p>"'Will ye hould yer whist?' says  I, 'And not be wakin' the terrace,' says I, 'And thry to lave off shtaggerin',  and shtand sthraight.'</p>
<p>"'The divil's cure to ye!' says  he, 'Do ye think I want any help to kape sthraight?'</p>
<p>"And wid that he thried to shteady  himself by the bedpost, but missed it, and sat down on the box wid me new hat  in wid the ostrich feathers.</p>
<p>"'You'll be the ruin' of me hat!'  says I.</p>
<p>"'And your blatherin', blistherin'  hat-pin 'ul be the ruin uv me!' says he. 'Pull it out quick before I blade to  death!'</p>
<p>"I pulled it out, but faith! it  sobered him up a bit, and afther a severe shtruggle wid his boots, he pulled  thim off, flung thim into the four corners of the room, and wint to bed.</p>
<p>"My opinion is that if clubs are  places where they sind men home at all hours in the mornin', to lose  their kay-holes, and dhrop their latch-kays, disthurbin' the shlape of their  wives, and singin' out at the top of their voices, and Mrs. Moloney's balkinny  door wide open, so that she couldn't be off hearin', to say nothin' of the risk  of rheumatics and lumbago, and brazen faymales givin' their fotygraffs wid  scarcely anything on, to the husbands of virtuous women, it's a great shame,  and ought to be brought before the Arbitration Court under the Act for the Protiction  of Daycent Married Faymales."</p>
<p>And Mrs. McSweeney handed Mrs.  Tacitus a jam tart, hot from the oven, while Mrs. Tacitus noticed that the  kitchen floor covering, which Mrs. McSweeney had described as "linoleum," was  only oilcloth, worth about tenpence a yard.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you could sing so  nicely, dear," said Mrs. Tacitus, as she entered the sitting-room where Mrs.  McSweeney sat and sang as she plied her needle.</p>
<p>'Faith! I'm loike a canary this  mornin', and I'm singin' bekase me heart is overflowin' wid the milk of human  koindness that way that it's oozin' out ov me."</p>
<p>"Why, what has happened?" enquired  Mrs. Tacitus, as she noticed that Mrs. McSweeney was darning Pat's white socks  with brown cotton.</p>
<p>"Thruly," says Mrs. McSweeney,  "Does the poet say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'One touch of nature makes the  whole wurruld kin, <br>
And often makes us fale phwat fools we've bin.'</p>
<p>"There is a toide in the affairs  of men and women, if you can only take it on the hop, that lades to the most  unexpected demonsthrations of the ould sayin' that 'every cloud has a silver  loinin', as everyone can see for himself if he'll only take the throuble to git  behind it.</p>
<p>"Little did I think a wake ago  that I'd ever have to relate the evints that I am now about to relate, but a  merciful Providence rules over all, and I'm glad to say that the inmity of the  past is dissolved in the swate frindship of the prisint. I fale as happy as a  flea in a stockin', for I'm at pace wid the whole of mankoind and everybody  else, barrin' Mrs. O'Reilly, who is not worth mentionin', she bein' a shnake in  the grass, wid a smooth face and a mischief-makin' tongue.</p>
<p>"I had been down the road one day  last wake, to lave Pat's boots to be half-soled and haled, and a patch put on  the soide, whin I seen a chubby-faced little boy walkin' along the road, wid a  basket of pertaters on his arrum, and a big chunk of wathermelon in his hand.  He was crossin' the road and lookin' behoind him at two dogs foightin', and I  was admirin' his rosy chakes and chubby bare legs, and thinkin' that it was a  shame to thrust him out by himself, and no one wid him, whin a butcher's cart  come tarin' round the corner, and before I could schrame, the horse was on top  of the little child, and thin the poor little fellow lay all sthill and white,  wid his pertaters all over the road, and the cart was gone.</p>
<p>"I ran and picked the poor child  up, and another woman felt him and said he wasn't dead, and she picked up his  hat and gathered up the pertaters, and a girl come and said she knew where he  lived. It was only just round the corner, and I carried him home. I found that  his mother was out washin', and nobody at home but his little sisther about tin  years old, and we put the poor little lad on the bed, and found a big bruise on  his head, but no bones broken. It broke me heart entoirely to see him lyin'  there so shtill and white and as limp as a piece of wet paper, that me mother's  falins' rose in me throat, and brought the tears to me eyes at the sight of  him. I chafed his hands and legs and blew in his face, and offered up a prayer  to the Blessed Virgin that the dear little innocent might not die on our hands.  While I was chafin' and cryin' and prayin', and thinkin' phwat else I could do,  the other lady plastered the lump on his head wid vinegar and brown paper and  things, and by and by we had the satisfaction to see him open his big blue eyes  and looked at us. I'll never forget the falins' I felt when I found that he was  shtill aloive and that he wasn't dead. 'Twas a tremenduous relafe off me moind.  Just as he opened his eyes, his mother come runnin' in, and was besoide herself  wid thankin' me and the other lady for our koindness to her poor little boy.</p>
<p>"Up to that toime I had been so  busy wid the child that I had taken no notice of the other lady; but I turned  round thin, and I thought I'd dhrop whin I saw that it was me mortal inimy,  Mrs. Moloney. The recognition was shpontaneously instantaneous on both sides at  once. I was covered wid mortification from head to foot. She made a sort of a bow  of recognition, and not to be outdone by her in perliteness, I did the same.  Then she bowed a little lower, and so did I. Now the room was only a shmall  one, and I couldn't see behoind me. Neither could Mrs. Moloney. In thryin' to  bow lower I bumped up agin a box or a piece of furniture behoind me. So did  Mrs. Moloney. The bump caused me to lose me balance, and I butted forward for  all the wurruld like a goat. So did Mrs. Moloney. In buttin' forward I butted  Mrs. Moloney wid such force that I sat down wid considerable violence and  velocity. So did Mrs. Moloney; and the double concussion shook the whole house.  I was not much hurt, and I was that amused at seein' her sittin' forninst me,  especially afther the upset I'd had wid the child, that I could not presarve me  dignity, and I burst out larfin'. So did Mrs. Moloney. I felt mad wid meself,  but I couldn't help it. I throid to smother it, and was just gettin' the bether  of it, whin that blessed darlin' wid the chubby legs and blue eyes, and the  roses comin' back to his chakes, sat up on the bed and shouted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Oh! Mumma, look! The two ladies  are goin' to play cock-fightin'!"</p>
<p>"Well, I roared again. So did Mrs.  Moloney. I larfed till me soides ached wid larfin', and the tears run down me  chakes. I got that helpless that I rowled on the floor. So did Mrs. Moloney. At  length, when we could larf no more, we picked ourselves up, and the boy's  mother would make us have a cup of tay before we wint. I throid to be dignified  once more, but it was no use. Every toime I caught Mrs. Moloney's eye I  shmoiled. So did Mrs. Moloney. She looked so good-humoured whin she shmoiled,  that I said at last:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Mrs. Moloney,' says I, 'Phwat  did I ever do to make you so cool to me?'</p>
<p>"'Mrs. McSweeney,' says she, 'I  will not decave you. I thought it was unkoind in you to tell Mrs. O'Reilly that  I was no bether than I should be.'</p>
<p>"'If I was to die this minit,'  says I, 'I never said such a thing.'</p>
<p>"'You didn't?' says she.</p>
<p>"'No,' says I, 'But I felt hurt  whin she tould me that you said that I was proud, and thought meself above me  neighbours.'</p>
<p>"'Did she tell you that?' says  she.</p>
<p>"She did?' says I.</p>
<p>"'Thin,' says she, 'She is a  viper. I only said you ought to be proud, for you was so much superior to your  neighbours.'</p>
<p>"So afther this explanation we  shook hands and come home together, and as we parted at the door, I resolved to  have no more to do wid Mrs. O'Reilly. So did Mrs. Moloney. And now Mrs. Moloney  and me are frinds. I pass the toime of day to her from me balkinny, and she  does the same to me. I pop over to her gate and have a chat, and she pops over  to mine. I wint yisterday and had afthernoon tay wid her, and she is comin'  to-day to have the same wid me. She made her boy apologise for turnin' off me  gas at the mayther, and tyin' shtrings to me knocker, and I'm the happiest  woman in the whole wide wurruld this day. And so is Mrs. Moloney.</p>
<p>"'Shure, ye're not goin'?' said  Mrs. McSweeney, as Mrs. Tacitus commenced to put on her hat.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Tacitus explained that  she had an engagement with her dentist, who was going to ease her top plate,  and as she shook the dust of Mrs. McSweeney's linoleum off her feet on the  gravel path, she remarked that some people were like members of Parliament. You  never knew to-day what they would do to-morrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneyDoestheBlock"></a>Mrs. McSweeney Does the Block</b></h2>
<p>"'Tis quoite a sthranger ye are,"  exclaimed Mrs. McSweeney, as she placed a chair in front of the fire for Mrs.  Tacitus. "And where have you been this long time?"</p>
<p>"I had no girl," replied Mrs.  Tacitus, as she took her seat and noticed that Mrs. McSweeney's slipper had a  hole in the toe. "Have you been keeping well?"</p>
<p>"Faith! I'm as happy as a new-made  polaceman. Since me reconciliation wid Mrs. Moloney I fale that the sunshine of  pace and thranquility is castin' its blessed shade upon me, and removin' from  me path the avilanches of doubt and inmity in which I used to be steeped. I'm a  new woman.</p>
<p>"I don't wish you to undhershtand  from that, that I've forgotten phwat's due to me sects. Glory be to Providence  I know me place. Women who want to be min may thry to revolutionize the  equilibrium of the social phwat-do-you-call-it and turn the sexes upside down,  but they will get no help from me. Whin I say I'm a new woman, I mane that me  bosom has evicted the falins' of acrimoniousness that used to dwell therein,  and has become the tiniment of pace and thranquility, and is swellin' wid love  and affection to that extent that me corset won't meet on me. The more I come  to know Mrs. Moloney, the more thankful I am to the little darlint wid the chubby  legs, that was the manes of bringin' us together, and the greater is me falin'  of contimptousness fur that degraded craythur, Mrs. O'Reilly.</p>
<p>"A thrue frind is loike a beacon  foire, that blazes the brightest on the darkest noight. A false frind is loike  a rush-light on a stick, whose flame is extinguished wid the first puff of  wind. The threachery of a false frind is loike a nadle in a sofy cushion. It  pricks you whin you laste expict it, and sometimes in the tindherest part. An  inimy who bethrays an inimy may be forgiven, but a frind who is false is like a  rotten crutch that breaks the first toime you lane on it. A man or woman who  will bethray a frind would bethray their counthry, and couldn't be thrusted to  carry a bone to a dog.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Moloney popped over to me  the day before yesterday just as I was washin' some pertaties to cook fur Pat's  dinner, as he will always make me cook thim in their jackets, because, he says,  it kapes the goodness in and sames more homely, and she says to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Where are you goin' to this  afthernoon?' says she.</p>
<p>"'I wasn't thinkin' of goin'  anywhere,' says I.</p>
<p>"'Phwat do ye say if we come and  do the block?' says she.</p>
<p>"'I'd loike it of all the  wurruld,' says I, 'But faith! I've nothin' to wear.'</p>
<p>"'Oh!' says she, 'You'll be all  roight. I'll call for you at three o'clock, and moind you are ready.'</p>
<p>"So she did me hair fur me, whoile  I was makin' some pancakes, so as to save toime, and afther I had washed up the  dinner things I got ready. I put on me new tan shoes and me open-work shtockins',  and a new pink muslin skirt, cut full behind; a white blouse, and me dark-green  Princess Maude cape wid a red frill round the back. Me Tommy Shanther hat was a  beauty. It was covered wid flowers on the top and underneath the brim, and  thrimmed wid airyfane and tool rosettes, wid loops of coloured shtraw, and a  twist of net near the edge caught down wid fancy pins. I had just put on me  light tan gloves and me green parasol, whin Mrs. Moloney tapped at me door.  Whin she seen me I thought it would take her breath away.</p>
<p>"'I loike you,' says she, 'Wid  your nothin' to wear! Why, you look as smart as the woife of a Jew  money-lender, or a Labour Mimber of Parliamint.'</p>
<p>"So we tuk the thram to  King-street, and then we did the block. We looked at the shops, and we passed  remarks on the dhresses of the ladies, and as the young civil servants and bank  clerks, wid the big walkin'-shticks and large shirt cuffs, walked past us, I  noticed more than one admoirin' glance thrown towards me. We were lookin' in a  shop windher, admoirin' the pictures, whin there was a young man in a straw hat  and a black moustache and an eye-glass, lookin' over our shoulders, and I'll  never forget the way he apologised whin somebody in the crowd pushed him up  against us. We told him perlitely not to mention it, and he raised his hat and  bowed, and we saw him no more. As it was nearly time to be gettin' home, Mrs.  Moloney wint into a shop to buy some fruit, and in a minute she comes runnin'  out as pale as death, and she says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Mrs. McSweeney,' says she, 'I've  lost me purse!'</p>
<p>"'Perhaps ye left it at home?'  says I.</p>
<p>"'I don't think so,' she says.  'But, anyway, lind me a shillin' till I pay fur the fruit.'</p>
<p>"I felt in me pocket, and it was  impty! I couldn't restrain the conthrol of me feelins' as I remumbered that  there was in it four and ninepence in silver, fourpence in copper, three  throuser buttons, a darnin' nadle, and the resate for the last month's rint.</p>
<p>"'Thieves! Robbers! Murder!' I  shouted, as fast as me lungs could carry me. A polaceman came up, and he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Here! Move on, and don't be  obsthructin' the footpath.'</p>
<p>"'Do you know who you are shpakin'  to,' says I, 'Wid your move on?'</p>
<p>"'I guess I know what YOU are,'  says he.</p>
<p>"'If you look at me in that tone  of voice,' says I, 'I'll take your number.'</p>
<p>"'Gwanawayouterthat!' says he, as  he gave me a push.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't demane meself to say  any more to him, but we had to walk home, seein' that we had no money. Nixt  toime I do the block, I'm goin' to kape me eye open fur that young man wid the  black moustache, and if I see him, he'll think the wurruld's at an ind, and  that the ruins are all on top of him. I'll make it that worrum for him that  he'll be glad to 'sake the cold shades of obliviousness to give his moustache  time to grow, and his eyes to rayshume their normal tint. Will ye take another  pace of jam roll?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, I will," said Mrs.  Tacitus, helping herself to a piece of jam roll and a couple of tarts, and  remarking to herself that Mrs. McSweeney's new fringe net was a couple of  shades darker than her hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrsMcSweeneyonPropriety"></a>Mrs. McSweeney on Propriety</b></h2>
<p>"Take the aisy chair, Mrs.  Moloney," said Mrs. McSweeney, as she ushered Mrs. Moloney into the  drawing-room, and placed a cushion on the best arm-chair.</p>
<p>"Shure, it's toired ye must be  afther your long walk into town, to say nothin' of the pushin' and dhrivin' at  the sale, and the sthruggle at the bargain counther."</p>
<p>"It's a bit fatigued I am, thin,"  said Mrs. Moloney, as she sank into the arm-chair and removed her hat-pins.  "Did Mrs. Tacitus call to-day?"</p>
<p>"Indade, she didn't then," replied  Mrs. McSweeney, with a toss of her head. "It's poor and humble I am, Mrs.  Moloney, although, thank Heaven, I have always a cup of tay and a bite for a  frind. But humble as I am I know me spear, and what is joo to meself and me  sects! If I have my way Mrs. Tacitus will not darken my door agin, for though  above want and livin' on a terrace of houses left her by her late husband, she  has lost the sinse of propriety.</p>
<p>"It has always been my aim, Mrs.  Moloney, although it is meself that says it, to live and conduct meself wid  such propriety that no man or woman of either sects can pint the finger of  schorn at me. Mrs. Tacitus has forfeited the reshpict joo to her sects by  lettin' her vanity get the bether of her discretion in such a way as to make  propriety hide her face to consale her blushes.</p>
<p>"It was this way: &mdash;As you are  aware, Mrs. Moloney, the late political contist was productive of great  excitement. There was a male committee and a famale committee. Pat was chairman  of the male committee, which was how I come to know all about it, and Mrs.  Tacitus was chairwoman of the faymale committee. Whin the eliction was over,  and our mimber got in on the top of a pole, he decoided to give a dinner to the  most prominent of his supporters.</p>
<p>"He invited Pat, who supported him  because he was an Irishman, Mr. Thompson (who is thryin' to get his son on the  thramway), Mr. Jones (who wants a billet in the post-office), Mr. Simpson (who  is thryin' to get into the Government Printin' Office), Mr. Tracey (who is  thryin' to get the conthract for the supply of red tape to the Government  institutions), and about a dozen more aqually disintherested elictors.</p>
<p>"He also invited Mrs. Tacitus, and  you'd niver belave it, but she wint! One solitary faymale to about twinty  males! The wake before the dinner our mimber sent for Mr. Tracey, and he says  to him, says he,</p>
<p>"'I think I'll be able to get ye  that conthract for red tape,' he says, 'But I'd loike to get up a tistimonial,'  says he, 'to Mrs. Tacitus.' 'Will you head it?' says he.</p>
<p>"So Mr. Tracey said he'd head it  wid a guinea, and he did; and thin wint home and added tin guineas to his  tinder for red tape.</p>
<p>"And Mr. Tracey wint to Mr.  Thompson, and he says,</p>
<p>"'If you don't want to ruin the  prospects of your son,' says he, 'Ye'll have to give tin shillins' to a  testimonial to Mrs. Tacitus. The mimber's moind is bint on it,' he says.</p>
<p>"So Mr. Thompson, afther some  persuadin', wint and borrowed tin shillins', and gave it to Mr. Tracey, and  thin wint home and threw a boot at his youngest boy for shtandin' on the  doorstep.</p>
<p>"Thin Mr. Tracey wint to Mr.  Jones, and he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I want tin shillins' for a  tistimonial to Mrs. Tacitus.'</p>
<p>"'But,' says Jones, 'I haven't tin  shillins' to me name.'</p>
<p>"'If you don't give it,' says  Tracey, 'the post-office is a sealed book to ye.'</p>
<p>"So Jones wint and pawned his  watch to git the tin shillins', and sould the ticket to git a dhrink.</p>
<p>"By the same logical argumints to  the rest of the committee the testimonial was bought, and the night for the  prisintation arrived.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300851h-images/page284.jpg" alt="page284" width="535" height="750"></h3>
<p>"The dinner was given at a  fashionable resterong, and Pat says it was a beautiful dinner, except that the  turkey was tough, and that the whiskey was off afther the first round. Whin  dinner was announced, all the min shtud in a loine, and Mrs. Tacitus walked in,  wid a shmoile on her face, on the arm of the mimber and a long train. All the  time the dinner was on she sat on the mimber's right hand, and as soon as it  was over, the mimber rose and said he had a plazin' jooty to perform.</p>
<p>"'I have,' said he, 'to prisint a  voluntary offerin' of our love to Mrs. Tacitus,' he says. 'I love Mrs.  Tacitus,' he says. 'We all love Mrs. Tacitus.'</p>
<p>"'Hear! Hear!' says Mr. Tracey.</p>
<p>"'Silence!' says the mimber,  lookin' at him with a tone of severity. 'And I have much pleasure in claspin'  on her fair arrum,' he says, 'this bangle, the shpontaneous gift of her frinds  and admoirers,' he says.</p>
<p>"And he fastened on the bangle,  squazin' her hand as he did it, and sat down amid considerable jinglin' of  impty glasses.</p>
<p>"'Will you say a few wurruds, my  dear Mr. Tracey?' said the mimber, whin the applause had died away.</p>
<p>"So Mr. Tracey said he was  delighted to be present at the prisintation to Mrs. Tacitus, whom they all  loved, and he throd on the toe of Mr. Jones, who sat nixt to him, and said in  an undhertone, 'Pass the whiskey!'</p>
<p>"Thin the mimber said he would  like Mr. Jones to say a few wurruds, and Mr. Jones said he was plazed to be  prisint to do honour to Mrs. Tacitus, whom they was all so fond of. And he sat  down and pinched the knee of Mr. Thompson, and said, 'Pass the whiskey!'</p>
<p>Thin the mimber asked Mr. Thompson  to say a few wurruds, and Mr. Thompson said he was delighted to assist in doin'  honour to Mrs. Tacitus, whom they all loved, and said, 'Pass the whiskey!'</p>
<p>"And the mimber asked each of the  others to say a few wurruds, and they each said how they was burstin' wid  deloight to be prisint on the prisint occasion to take part in the prisintation  of a prisint to Mrs. Tacitus, whom they was all so fond of.</p>
<p>"As aiche one sat down his  concloodin' remarks was, 'Pass the whiskey,' but whin the whiskey was passed  divil a dhrop was there barrin' the impty bottle.</p>
<p>"Thin the mimber returned thanks  for Mrs. Tacitus. He said how plazed she was, and how proud she was to be so  loved by them all, and to resave the free and shpontaneous offerin' of their  affection. Thin he tould her again how fond they all was of her, and rayshumed  his sate.</p>
<p>"Thin come the harminy. Mr.  Thompson sang 'The Soldier's Tear,' and</p>
<p>Pat says he didn't sing it bad,  barrin' havin' to lave out the top notes owin' to a could on his chist.</p>
<p>"Thin there was loud calls for a  song from the mimber, and afther clearin' his voice, and thryin' two or three  kays till he got the roight one, he sang a new song called, 'Put Me in My  Little Bed,' which was received wid great applause, especially as he was  accompanied by Mrs. Tacitus on a mouthorgan, wid variations.</p>
<p>"Pat sang 'Oft in the Shtilly  Noight,' but wandhered into 'The Groves of Blarney' in the second verse, and  couldn't for the life of him foind his way back into the 'Shtilly Noight.'</p>
<p>"Then Mrs. Tacitus played the  'Ould Folks at Home' on the banjo, that the mimber prisinted her wid some time  ago, and that bein' an insthrument calkerlated to show off a bangle, and make  the imitation diamonds shparkle, was a great success.</p>
<p>"Thin Mr. Tracey said to the  mimber, 'Will you pass the whiskey?' he says. But the mimber didn't hear him,  and proposed that they should all jine in singin' 'She's a Jolly Good Fellow,'  and 'So Say All of Us,' and they cheered agin and agin.</p>
<p>"'One for the mimber,' says Mr.  Thompson, who is thryin' to get his son on the thramway; and they cheered agin.</p>
<p>"'One for the mimber's wife,' said  Tracey, who couldn't get anybody to pass the whiskey.</p>
<p>"But the mimber said he thought it  was time to go, and so they separated, as it was nigh closin' time, and they  was all dhry. Pat and the rist of the committee wint round to the club, and the  mimber tuk Mrs. Tacitus home in a cab.</p>
<p>"And where was the mimber's wife,  that she wasn't there?" said Mrs. Moloney.</p>
<p>"Oh!" replied Mrs. McSweeney, in a  tone of sarcasm, "She was sint to Melbourne for a holiday fer the benefit of  her health."</p>
<p>"Oh, indade!" said Mrs. Moloney,  winking significantly at Mrs. McSweeney.</p>
<p>"Yes, indade!" replied Mrs.  McSweeney, winking slowly but effectively at Mrs. Moloney.</p>
<p>"It may be all roight," she added,  after a pause.</p>
<p>"I hope and thrust it is, but,  Mrs. Moloney, it is not propriety, and I belave in propriety, and therefore  Mrs. Tacitus is no longer a frind of mine."</p>

<p align="center">"<i>The Geebung Taytotal Society</i>"</p>
<p>'Twas the red-lether day of me  loife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whin Pathrick McSweeney first married me;<br>
  Whin he made me his own wedded woife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And away for the honeymoon carried me.</p>
<p>Although things are not all that  they same,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though Cupid's professions are brittle ones,<br>
  Yet the first year flew by loike a dhrame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whole of our throubles were "<i>little ones</i>."</p>
<p>In the corner Pat kept a  cruiskeen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though of whiskey he'd not take a lot of it,<br>
  But in toime it was plain to be seen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shtill fonder and fonder he got of it.</p>
<p>He would take it to kape out the  could, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the heat&mdash;he would just take a sup of it,<br>
  Until nought could be purchased or sould,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the bargain was clinched wid a cup of it.</p>
<p>And noight after noight would I  wait,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the clock had shtruck midnight expectin' him,<br>
  And me trouble was sad to relate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I found that the dhrink was affectin' him.</p>
<p>I'd besache him his Biddy to plaze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By avoidin' such gross insobriety,<br>
  And I'd beg him on both of me knees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to join the Taytotal Society.</p>
<p>I would say, "You're a baste and a  hog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I don't know whatever to do wid you,<br>
  For you lade me the loife of a dog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And me once rosy chakes are quite blue wid you."</p>
<p>"Faith! I'll lave you, and let you  go free,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you cause me no end of anxiety,<br>
  If you won't give up whiskey for me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And join the Taytotal Society."</p>
<p>Then I coaxed him, and petted him  so,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persistently kept on insistin' it,<br>
  That he said, "He supposed he must go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he couldn't be afther resistin' it."</p>
<p>"Arrah! Biddy, me darlin'," said  he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have got such a swate wheedlin' way wid you,<br>
  Faith, I'll dhrink nothing shtronger than tay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll give up the whiskey, and shtay wid you."</p>
<p>So he wint to the matin' that  noight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afther dhressin' himself wid propriety,<br>
  And he soon was a glitherin' loight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Geebung Taytotal Society.</p>
<p>For they gave him a banner to  bear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a collar wid gilt and gold lace on it,<br>
  Such as Malachi once used to wear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before thraitors brought down such disgrace on it.</p>
<p>And I felt loike a bride newly  wed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wid joy was replete to satiety,<br>
  Whin he marched through the town at the head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Geebung Taytotal Society.</p>
<p>But me heart grew quite heavy and  sore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afther all I had done in amindin' him,<br>
  Whin he shtaggered one noight to me door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid a party of Geebungs attendin' him.</p>
<p>They explained as they led him  along,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid a great affectation of piety,<br>
  "They sapposed that the tay was too shtrong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Geebung Taytotal Society."</p>
<p>And he goes to the matins' each  noight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I now thry to kape him away from 'em,<br>
  And I'm in a continual froight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I cannot induce him to shtay from 'em.</p>
<p>He now tipples away widout end,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he takes it in greater variety,<br>
  For he says that they taught him the blend<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Geebung Taytotal Society.</p>
