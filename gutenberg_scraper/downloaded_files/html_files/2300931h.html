<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1. THE TOP ROAD OR THE
TRACK.</h2>

<p>It was a perfect autumn day in the year 189-. Leslie Raymond was
returning from a visit to Eugowra, which was the nearest township
to his father's station. He was the only son of James Raymond,
proprietor of "Bindawalla," the largest sheep station in the
district.</p>

<p>Leslie was born at "Bindawalla," and, with the exception of a
few years spent at the Sydney Grammar School, he had lived his
whole life in the district. He was a typical Australian, tall and
loosely built, straight as an arrow, but with broad shoulders and
supple, sinewy limbs. He had brown hair, a slight drooping
moustache of the same colour, and keen grey eyes, which gave one
the impression of good humour, whilst his square-cut chin seemed to
indicate the possession of of considerable firmness and power of
will. He wore a pair of grey riding pants, a sac coat, no vest, and
a soft silk shirt. He had on a pair of leather leggings carried in
his hand a short riding whip. He was riding a superb bay gelding
with black points. By its moist shining flanks, and the foam which
flecked the bridle, it could be seen that the beautiful creature
had been ridden hard; and by the tossing of its small handsome
head, the dilation of its nostrils, and the impatient champing of
the bit, it was evidently quite ready for another gallop.</p>

<p>Leslie Raymond, however, had no intention of indulging its
desire, for he kept a tight hand upon the bridle while leaning
forward and patting the horse's neck and endeavouring by soothing
words to calm the irritability of his favourite.</p>

<p>"Steady boy, steady," he said. "No more galloping or jumping
today. We must take it easy now. We have to keep in good fettle for
the show. Jump there as you have jumped to-day, and there nothing
betwixt here and Sydney that can prevent us from winning the
hunter's prize. Steady now, steady!" And he checked the horse to a
walk and proceeded slowly down the gully.</p>

<p>On each side of him was a low stony ridge, whilst in front the
gully grew wider and more level, until it terminated in a fertile
flat about a square mile in extent, in the centre of which, on a
knoll of rising ground, stood a neat farm house. Leslie could just
see the roof among the willows and fruit trees by which it was
surrounded. It was the residence of George Sterling, whose farm
occupied the whole of the flat. It was the most fertile spot in the
district, and a running stream, which had never been known to fail,
bisected the flat and provided a never-ceasing supply of pure,
fresh water. The farm of George Sterling was known as the best for
miles around, and the owner was considered to be a solid and
substantial man.</p>

<p>As Leslie approached the little bridge at the foot of the gully
he paused, hesitating for a moment as if in doubt.</p>

<p>"Shall I," he soliloquised, "keep to the track or shall I go
round by the top paddock? The track leads right up to Sterling's
door, and I can scarcely pass without stopping to say Good-day. I
know that the Dad, with his old-fashioned notions and his bitter
animosity against free selectors, objects to me calling, and
yet&mdash;where's the harm? Sterling is an honest man and why
should I he uncivil or go out of my way to avoid the house?"</p>

<p>He remained in doubt for a moment only, and then, shaking his
bridle, he leisurely followed the track.</p>

<p>He had not proceeded far when his attention was attracted by the
breaking of dry sticks and brushwood on the ridge to his left, and
the trampling sound of hoofs. Looking up, he saw some cows trotting
across the ridge.</p>

<p>The cows had scarcely made their appearance when Leslie heard
the voice of the driver. She was alternately singing snatches of an
old song, and urging the lazy cows towards the milking yard. The
voice, though quite untrained, was of such power and sweetness that
it might have been the voice of an angel.</p>

<p>Leslie was not in a hurry, in fact he had just been proposing to
take things easy, and so he let the reins fall upon his horse's
neck, and while Bunyip availed himself of the opportunity to sample
some of the grass at his feet, Leslie sat and listened to the music
of the girl's voice at is floated over the ridge.</p>

<p>'Twas on a simmer's afternoon,<br>
A wee before the sun ga'ed doon,<br>
My lassie in a braw new goon&mdash;<br>
<i>(Sool 'em! Sool 'em! Home! Home! Fetch 'em Brusher.)</i><br>
My lassie in a brow new goon<br>
Cam' o'er the hills to Gowrie.<br>
<i>(I'll give it to you Daisy. Fetch her Brusher. Good
dog.)</i><br>
The rose-bud tinged wi' morning shower,<br>
Blooms fresh within the sunny bower&mdash;<br>
<i>(Sool 'em! Sool! Fetch 'em up. Now Brusher.)</i><br>
But Kitty was the fairest flower<br>
That ever bloomed in Gowrie.</p>

<p>At this moment the singer appeared above the crest of the ridge.
Leslie at first caught a mere glimpse, but that was just enough to
show him that she was riding an old grey stock-horse which he knew
by the name of "Gaffer," that she was riding on a man's saddle, and
in man fashion. He had barely time to note this much when she
disappeared behind a rock. It was not a large rock. As the horse's
tail disappeared on one side its head emerged from the other, but
when the girl again came into view she was riding in the most
approved feminine style, and the skirts of her dress&mdash;for she
wore no habit&mdash;were neatly arranged around her ankles.</p>

<p>She cantered smartly down the ridge and soon reached the spot
where Leslie loitered. She seemed surprised when ha raised his hat,
to find that she was not alone.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Miss Sterling," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"Oh! Good evening, Mr. Raymond," said she, raising her eyes for
a moment to his and then dropping them shyly.</p>

<p>She was about eighteen years of age, tall and well proportioned.
She wore a pink cotton dress, which was evidently home made, a
white sun-bonnet, and thick leather boots. Her black hair fell in
wavy masses beneath the sun bonnet, the front of which nearly hid
her cheeks, yet left enough of them bare to show that the clear
olive skin was tinted with a soft rosy hue, while it did not hide,
but rather accentuated the piercing glances of her laughing black
eyes. The cows knew their way home, and as they were walking
leisurely towards the fiat, Leslie rode for some momenta by the
side of the girl.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have interrupted your singing," said he.</p>

<p>"Were you listening?" The lashes lifted for a moment, and the
dark eyes flashed a swift glance of interrogation. "I don't call
that singing. I was only amusing myself. I can't sing. I wish I
could."</p>

<p>"You ought to take some lessons. Your voice is worth
cultivating."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have had lessons. I was taught at school. Old Mr. Spicer,
the teacher at the half-time school, used to teach us. He paid me a
great compliment, too. He said that I could sing higher and louder
than any girl in the school."</p>

<p>"But I mean," said Leslie, smiling, "proper lessons from a
qualified teacher."</p>

<p>"But there are no music teachers in the bush. There is one in
Forbes, but Forbes is forty miles away. I have never been to Forbes
in my life! but father has promised to take me in to the next
show." Then, after a pause she added, "I play the piano, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Leslie; "then you have had some teaching?"</p>

<p>"No; I taught myself."</p>

<p>"Did you teach yourself to read music?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no. I don't read music. I only sing some old songs,
when nobody is about, and accompany myself."</p>

<p>"You play by ear, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Of course I don't pretend to be a good
player, but somehow I make the music fit in. I think I play by
instinct."</p>

<p>"You must be very fond of music?"</p>

<p>"I am. But don't you think that everybody is fond of music? I
do. And there seems to me to be music everywhere if we will but
listen to it. To me there is always music in the bush. They say
that Australian birds have no song but I find sweet music in the
whistle of the magpie at sunrise, in the cawing of the
yellow-crested cockatoo, the screaming of the parakeets, and the
beautiful, mournful, cry of the curlew at night. To me there is
music everywhere. In the rustling of the trees, in the mountain
stream, tumbling over its rocky bed, even in the thunder and the
crashing of the storm."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Leslie, "I am not much of a musician, although I
was taught a little by the tutor we had at Bindawalla, and I was
three years under a music master at Sydney. But that was four years
ago, and as I have not kept up my practice, and, in fact, never
took to it very kindly, I have succeeded in forgetting nearly all I
knew. In fact, I seldom hear any music now, unless there is music
in the bleating of a flock of fat wethers, or the clipping of the
shears in the woolshed."</p>

<p>BY this time they had arrived at the house. The cows were
yarded, and George Sterling, who had seen young Raymond coming,
stood on the verandah to welcome him.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Raymond," said Sterling.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Sterling," answered Leslie.</p>

<p>George Sterling's greeting had been hearty enough, but he spoke
a little less cordially as he invited his visitor to step
inside.</p>

<p>"Ria!" called Mr. Sterling; "Ria! get Mr. Raymond a glass of
wine and some cake."</p>

<p>It was in vain that Leslie protested that he woad rather not.
Mrs. Sterling insisted, and he was forced to submit.</p>

<p>He ate some cake, and with difficulty swallowed a glass of the
wine.</p>

<p>"How do you like my wine, Mr. Raymond," inquired Mrs. Sterling.
"It is gooseberry wine. I made it myself from a recipe that I got
from my cousin in Gippsland."</p>

<p>"It is excellent, ma'am," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"Take another glass," said Mrs. Sterling.</p>

<p>But Leslie protested that he had had enough, and not all Mrs.
Sterling's persuasion could induce him to alter his
determination.</p>

<p>As he rode towards Bindawalla, his thoughts ran thus:</p>

<p>"I suppose the dad would be angry if he knew that I had been
drinking gooseberry wine at Sterling's place, and if it made me ill
he would say it served me right. But Sterling seems a civil, decent
sort of chap. His wife is kind and motherly, although her
gooseberry wine is atrocious," and he made a wry face at the memory
of it. "Then the girl, she is a curious creature. Shy, yet
self-possessed. Merry, but with a natural vein of sadness. She has
splendid eyes when one can get a peep at them, and, Heavens! what a
voice."</p>

<p>And as he rode across the home paddock in the gathering
twilight, he thought, for the first time in his life, that there
was music in the whistling of the magpies as they sang farewell to
the setting sun, and, as he smoked his pipe on the broad verandah
after dinner (they were important people at Bindawalla, and dined
late), he discovered mournful music in the cry of a curle from a
distant hill.</p>

<p>While Leslie was listening to the cry of the curlew, George
Sterling was also smoking his pipe on his verandah, and listening
to Ruby as she sang some of his favourite songs inside.</p>

<p>When she had finished singing she joined him on the verandah. He
smoked on in silence for some time, and then said:</p>

<p>"What brought young Raymond round this way this evening?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said she, "but I think he is training Bunyip for
the show, and he came this way instead of going by the road so that
he could give him some practice over some fences."</p>

<p>"And I suppose if he breaks them down, I can put them up again,
and if I don't, and our cows or horses get into his father's
paddock, he'll pound them, eh? I don't want his company nor any of
his people. They are too stuck up for me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Leslie doesn't seem to be stuck-up," replied Ruby,
projecting her chin slightly forward, as was her habit when in a
contradictory mood. "He seemed very polite, I thought."</p>

<p>"You thought," echoed Sterling, as he knocked the ashes from his
his Pipe. "What do you know about it? Did you hear how I addressed
him, and how he addressed me? I called him Mr. Raymond, as was
quite proper from a host to a guest. How did he address me? He
says, Good evening, <i>Sterling</i>, Not <i>Mr.</i> Sterling; just
plain <i>Sterling</i>. Just the same as he would talk to his
stockman or his cook, or his rouseabout. It's always the same. If I
meet him on the road it's 'Good day, <i>Sterling</i>', or 'Fine
weather, <i>Sterling</i>,' or 'Going to have some rain,
<i>Sterling</i>.' Who's he, that he should '<i>Sterling</i>' me?
I'm as good a man as he is, or his father, either. I pay my way,
and I don't want to be patronised by him."</p>

<p>"I don't think&mdash;" commenced Ruby.</p>

<p>"Nobody asked you to think," said her father. "There's 9 o'clock
striking, and it's time for prayers."</p>

<p>So they went inside, and, as was the invariable custom, the
family assembled for evening prayers. George Sterling took from its
place in the corner an old tattered Bible, and after some time
turning over the leaves and adjusting the loose ones, he cleaned
his spectacles, and read a chapter. The whole family then knelt,
Mr. Sterling near his arm-chair, Mrs. Sterling near the
rocking-chair, and Ruby and her younger sister by the side of the
couch.</p>

<p>George Sterling then offered up a long prayer in which he prayed
that all their sins might be forgiven, that their hearts might be
cleansed from all malice or envious thoughts, and that they might
be disposed to live in charity with all mankind.</p>

<p>While he was praying Mrs. Sterling dozed, and Ruby and her
sister fought for the sofa cushion, which Ruby succeeded in winning
just as George Sterling pronounced the benediction.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2. SQUATTER v.
SELECTOR.</h2>

<p>The hardy pioneers who first penetrated to the vast territory
lying to the west of the Blue Mountains led a kind of nomadic
existence, and pastured their ever-increasing flocks and herds
wherever their fancy led them, without neighbours to dispute their
right, but also without any fixity of tenure. It was not until the
year 1846 that they obtained from the Home Government the right to
regular leases, and the pre-emptive right to convert their leases
into fee-simples.</p>

<p>In 1852 and the years immediately following a great change took
place in the conditions of life in Australia. It had remarkable and
far-reaching results. This was the discovery of gold. The first
announcement altered the whole trend of business methods, attracted
the attention of the whole world, and it was at once followed by a
large, influx of population. Many of the newcomers, finding their
search for the precious metal uncongenial or unsuccessful, still
desired to settle in the country and establish homes for themselves
and families.</p>

<p>Thus arose a new class of claimants for the land, who, to
distinguish them from the squatters, were called "selectors" or
"settlers." To provide for the requirements of this ever-increasing
class, new land legislation became an imperative necessity.</p>

<p>To meet this want, there was passed the Act known as the Land
Act of 1881. The vital principle of the new Act was the provision,
for free-selection, before survey. According to this provision, any
person could select any piece of land not exceeding three hundred
and twenty acres in extent, which had not been alienated from the
Crown, or reserved by proclamation. The conditions
were&mdash;continued residence upon the land for a period of three
years from the date of selection, and the making, within that time,
of permanent improvements to the value of one pound for each acre
selected. The price was one pound per acre, twenty-five per cent.
of which had to be paid down. Unlimited credit was given for the
balance on payment of a small annual interest. The squatter's
pre-emptive right to purchase was limited to an area of six hundred
and forty acres, and the balance of his lease, amounting in some
cases to hundreds of square miles, was open to selection.</p>

<p>The effect of the law was that in a few years three classes of
selectors were brought into existence. First there was the
bona-fide selector, for whose benefit the law was framed; the man
who wished to take up ground for the purpose of founding a home.
Next came the dummy selector, who was employed by the squatter to
select land upon his lease with the understanding that he should
sell out to the squatter on the termination of his period of
residence. Last came the blackmailer, who selected land, not for a
home, but with the purpose of annoying the squatter, in order that
the latter might be induced to pay him to clear out, when, of
course, he would be at liberty to repeat his tactics in some other
direction.</p>

<p>To whichever class of the three the free-selector belonged, he
was regarded by the squatter as an unmitigated nuisance; and the
one who was probably looked upon as the greatest nuisance of the
three was the bona-fide selector who came to stop, and who, with
commendable forethought, generally chose the very best of the land,
which the squatter called "Picking the eyes out of the estate."</p>

<p>This state of affairs established between the squatters and
selectors a distinct line of cleavage.</p>

<p>In 1848, just after the establishment of regular leases, and
prior to the discovery of gold, James Raymond's father, who held a
commission in one of Her Majesty's regiments, was stationed with
his regiment in Sydney. He was a younger son of an old English
family, but, being a younger son, he had little to depend on except
his pay as a captain; which, with the ever increasing
responsibilities of a growing family; he found all too small for
his requirements.</p>

<p>Having made several trips into the interior, and noted the vast
possibilities of the new country, he sold out his commission and
obtained the lease of a large area on the Lachlan river. He stocked
it as well as his limited means would allow, and in a few years saw
his flocks and herds increase and himself in a position of
comparative affluence.</p>

<p>With the advent of the gold discovery came an immense increase
in values, and the elder Raymond found that he not only possessed
larger herds and flocks, but that each head of stock had doubled in
value.</p>

<p>This state of prosperity continued for some years, and although
Raymond had heard certain rumours of changes in the land laws, he
paid little heed to them.</p>

<p>One day he found it necessary to visit a flat he had on the run,
about two miles from the homestead, which be had always looked upon
as one of his choicest possessions. In the driest season there was
always plenty of grass on this flat, and the creek which ran across
it contained an unfailing supply of water.</p>

<p>Carriers and travelling hawkers were common in those days, and
he was not much surprised to see a team of bullocks grazing near
the stream, and a young man, with his wife and child, taking their
mid-day meal by the side of the tilted waggon.</p>

<p>The circumstance was forgotten by Raymond until he was reminded
of it a week later by his stockman. The flat was called "Old Joe's
Flat," after an old shepherd who discovered it, and the captain was
told by the stockman that the bullocks were still grazing on Old
Joe's Flat, that the waggon, the man, his wife and child were
there, and moreover, that the man was splitting slabs with the
evident intention of building a house.</p>

<p>To say that Captain Raymond was indignant would be to use a mild
term. He was furious, he had a flock of wethers almost ready for
market, and he had been reserving the grass at "Old Joe's Flat" to
top them off.</p>

<p>"Where's Jim?" he shouted. "Send Jim here."</p>

<p>"Jim" was his eldest son, then a young man of about eight and
twenty, his father's steward, manager, and general right hand
man.</p>

<p>Jim was ordered to ride, down to the flat and to order the
intruder off. On arriving at the flat Jim found that the stockman's
tale was true, and that under the persistent labour of a young man
about the same age as himself, the corner posts were in, and the
construction of a slab hut was well under way. This was the first
meeting of James Raymond and George Sterling.</p>

<p>Young Raymond demanded indignantly to know what Sterling meant
by building a hut on his father's land, but Sterling quietly
informed him that he intended to make his home there. In vain did
James Raymond storm and threaten.</p>

<p>Sterling proved that he had the legal right to do what he was
doing, and coolly informed Raymond that the corner post of the hut,
which he was just ramming, marked the corner of his land, and that
a line due east from that, and another line due north, marked the
boundary of three hundred and twenty acres on Old Joe's Flat,
including a portion of the creek, which three hundred and twenty
choice acres were lost for ever to Bindawalla and the Raymonds.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond was furious. He vowed that he would muster the
station hands on the morrow, and remove the intruders by main
force. He would go to Forbes, and get the mounted troopers out; he
would go to Sydney, and interview the Government; he would take the
matter to the Privy Council!</p>

<p>However, after he had slept on it, and taken time for
reflection, he did none of these things, but he wrote to Sydney at
once for a copy of the Land Act. Upon reading this he found, of
course, that Sterling was right, and that he was powerless in the
matter.</p>

<p>Sterling went on, finished his house and fenced in his land. He
grew vegetables and wheat, and kept cows: His wife raised poultry,
and made butter; and, as a ready market for butter, eggs,
vegetables, etc., was always to be found among the diggers on the
Lachlan. George Sterling prospered.</p>

<p>But Captain Raymond never forgave him, and never missed an
opportunity of impounding Sterling's horses or cattle. Any trespass
by Sterling or his stock on the Bindawalla Station was resented and
punished with the utmost rigour of the law. Just after one of
Sterling's trips into Forbes Captain Raymond heard with indignation
that Sterling was enlarging his hut to the southward. He at once
ordered him to desist, as it was an encroachment on his lease; but
Sterling coolly informed him that it was nothing of the sort. He
had taken up another selection with three hundred and twenty acres
for his wife. The same post marked the corner, but the boundary
line ran south and east. The additional room was necessary, as his
wife had to sleep on her own selection, and he on his. To comply
strictly with the law, he had resolved to place the double bedstead
on the boundary line between the two selections. As Sterling
occupied the northern half of the bed, and his wife the side toward
the south, they could occupy the same bed, and comply with the
residence clause of the Act.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond fumed and swore. He said that females could not
select land, and, as before, he threatened to set the law in motion
and to generally make things awkward for Sterling.</p>

<p>But Sterling went on his way and prospered. He set men to work,
and soon had the new selection, which he Called "Ria's Selection,"
fenced in. Time went on, and the same bitter feud existed between
Sterling and the Raymonds. Several other parties took up selections
on different parts of the estate, and Captain Raymond had to submit
to the inevitable. In his eyes, however, Sterling was the
ring-leader, and as long as the Captain lived he never forgave him
for selecting on "Old Joe's Flat."</p>

<p>The Captain having paid the debt of Nature, his son James
reigned at Bindawalla in his stead. He not only inherited
Bindawalla, with its vast flocks and herds, but he inherited all
his late father's pride of birth; his hatred of free selectors as a
class, and of George Sterling as their prototype.</p>

<p>Many were the disputes with reference to broken fences, and
straying or unbranded cattle, but on all these occasions George
Sterling acted with the same cool stolidity which had characterised
his actions from the first time he appeared at Bindawalla.</p>

<p>After one of these disputes, James Raymond was informed that
Sterling was making another addition to his house. Raymond caused
his manager to make inquiries, and upon the latter calling casually
at Sterling's place, he was told the reason.</p>

<p>"You see," said Sterling, resting on his axe, and mopping the
perspiration from his brow, "you see, it's like this. Little George
is eight years old, and he is getting older. I've taken up three
hundred and twenty acres for him. The old post will still be the
corner post, and the boundary lines run from it north and west. I'm
running up a skillion, so as we can break a door into it from our
bedroom. We shall put his bed in the skillion, so's he can sleep on
his selection, and yet be within hail, as it were."</p>

<p>"But," said the manager, "that will take in all the Flat on that
side, down to the creek."</p>

<p>"A bit beyond the creek," answered Sterling, coolly. "It takes
in the bit of alluvial on the other side, as far as the ironstone
bridge."</p>

<p>In due time the size of the skillion was doubled. It was
extended to the south. Another three hundred and twenty acres were
secured, this time for the baby, Ruby, then about two years old.
Her cot was placed in the south-west corner of the skillion. She
slept on her own selection, and the letter of the law was
vindicated.</p>

<p>Thus the whole of "Old Joe's Flat" passed from the possession of
the Raymonds into that of the Sterlings. The original selection was
called "The Old Selection," the second, "Ria's Selection," the
third, "George's Selection," and the fourth and last, "Ruby's
Selection." George had died when a youth, but he had lived long
enough to complete his term of residence.</p>

<p>The old slab hut was now used as a store, and George Sterling,
with his wife and two daughters, lived in a new and commodious
stone house, with a shingle roof, and a broad verandah. Active
warfare had long ceased between the families, and their present
state, as exemplified by the heads of the families, was one of
armed neutrality. James Raymond was fond of impressing on his son,
Leslie, the fact that it was Sterling who first began to pick the
eyes out of the estate, while Sterling told his daughters that the
Raymonds were a conceited lot. He refused to be patronised by them
or anybody else, paid his debts punctually, got the highest price
he could for his wheat and wool, attended church regularly, had
family prayers every evening, and swore regularly every morning at
everybody who was not up before the sun.</p>

<p>The bitter feelings of the old people were not in any degree
shared by the younger branches of the two families. Leslie Raymond
had always been taught to consider himself a gentleman. He had
received a good education, had always been liberally supplied with
money, and when in town, moved in the best society. He naturally
felt that he was very much superior to a common free selector, but
he felt no personal animus against George Sterling, as an
individual; and had been known to observe more than once that "The
pater had a bee in his bonnet," and that he thought the Sterlings
were "for their class," very decent people.</p>

<p>On the night our story opened, when prayers were over, and the
inhabitants of Sterling's house had retired to their respective
apartments, Ruby declared to her sister, Madge, that she believed
"That the dad was a bit ratty about the Raymonds. I am sure," she
continued with sonic warmth, and with her chin projected at a
dangerous angle, "no one could be more polite than young Mr.
Raymond was today. He even drank ma's gooseberry wine without
making a face, although I could see he didn't like it. His horse is
a beauty, and his eyes are real lovely."</p>

<p>The unsympathetic Madge, however, only remarked that she wanted
to go to sleep, and threatened, if Ruby didn't keep her cold feet
on her own side of the bed, that she would "sing out for Ma!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3. VISITORS AT "OLD JOE'S
FLAT."</h2>

<p>One Sunday afternoon just as the Sterlings were about to sit
down to afternoon tea two visitors arrived in the persons of Mr.
Meredith and Mr. Pogson.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith was the new clergyman, and a comparatively young
man, of medium height, rather slender, and with a frank, pleasant
face, which was full of good humour when he smiled, but which, in
repose, wore a thoughtful expression, sometimes almost sad. He wore
a sac coat, and black leather leggings. His vest was buttoned close
up to his straight white collar, and his soft black felt hat had a
wide brim.</p>

<p>He had only been stationed in Eugowra about twelve months;
having been sent there immediately after his marriage, but he had
already gained a name in the district for earnestness and zeal, and
had consequently succeeded in making some friends and a few
enemies.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson was a storekeeper. He sold hardware, groceries,
drapery, stationery, saddlery, furniture, musical instruments, and
sundries. In connection with his establishment was a livery stable,
where horses and buggies were for sale or hire, and he conducted
funerals on the shortest notice.</p>

<p>He bought wool, fruit, butter, eggs, hides, sheepskins,
marsupial and rabbit skins, and all sorts of farm produce. He was
the holder of an auctioneer's license, and held sales of live stock
once a week. He lent money on freehold or other approved security,
and was special correspondent at Eugowra for one of the Sydney
papers.</p>

<p>In appearance he gave one the impression of being a long man.
His figure was long, his face was long, his legs and arms were
long, his nose was long, and so was his rusty hair. This impression
of length, as distinguished from breadth or depth, was further
intensified on closer acquaintance with Mr. Pogson, for he talked
slowly, and never by any possible chance used a short word when a
long one would answer his purpose as well, or nearly as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson was a Justice of the Peace, a member of the Licensing
Bench, the Hospital Committee, the Committee of the School of Arts,
and the local School Board.</p>

<p>He was also Honorary President of the Eugowra Temperance
Society. It was true that the Society only numbered seven, four of
whom came from Mr. Pogson's own establishment; but the paucity of
membership will be easily understood when it is explained that the
large majority of the inhabitants of the district were Scotchmen
and Irishmen or their descendants.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson and George Sterling were well known to each other,
but Mr. Meredith was only known to Sterling by sight, so Mr. Pogson
introduced him with a patronising air.</p>

<p>"It's a fine day," said Sterling.</p>

<p>"It is, a very fine day," said Mr. Meredith, as he sipped his
tea.</p>

<p>"It really is an exceedingly beautiful day," said Mr. Pogson,
"an exceedingly beautiful day. Thank the Lord."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have been holding Divine service somewhere,"
remarked Mrs. Sterling.</p>

<p>"I have been preaching at the little church at Byalong,"
answered Mr. Meredith.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Pogson, "Mr. Meredith has been preaching at the
church at Byalong, according to the accepted doctrines of that
branch of the Protestant community in which he holds Holy Orders.
I, myself, have been expounding the Word to my brethren at Hogan's
Hollow. As you are aware, I do not hold Holy Orders. Neither do I
study my sermons, I trust to the Divine Inspiration for my
discourse, and I thank the Lord that He has abundantly sanctified
my labours in His vineyard."</p>

<p>"Although I do not belong to the Wesleyan Church," said Mr.
Meredith, "I am always ready to admire and acknowledge any earnest
effort made to spread the Gospel and the teachings of our
Master."</p>

<p>"Amen!" said Mr. Pogson, "Amen! I entirely and cordially
reciprocate your Christian toleration, Mrs. Sterling, allow me to
compliment you upon the excellence of your scones. They are
extremely delicious. There is about them that perfect amalgamation
of lightness, and&mdash;if I may use the expression&mdash;solidity,
which renders them at once gratifying to the taste and satisfying
to the appetite. May I trouble you for another cup of tea?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sterling helped Mr. Pogson to more tea, and Ruby handed the
grapes to Mr. Meredith.</p>

<p>"And now," said Mr. Meredith, "it is time we explained the
object of our visit."</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Mr. Pogson, "our visit is the result of a
conversation that occurred between my reverend friend and myself.
The subject of the conversation was a movement we have on foot in
Eugowra, having for its object the augmentation of the financial
resources of that excellent Institution for the amelioration of
human suffering, the Forbes Hospital. The Hospital Committee, of
which I have the honour to be a humble member, have (through me)
requested the people in the town and district of Eugowra to make a
special effort to subscribe a substantial donation to its funds,
and the proposal is that it shall take the form of a tea meeting.
After tea we propose to have a few short addresses, and some
prayers."</p>

<p>"And some music," said the parson.</p>

<p>"And some music," added Mr. Pogson.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said George Sterling, "to make a long story short,
you want me to furnish a table?"</p>

<p>"When Mr. Pogson and I met this afternoon," said Mr. Meredith,
"he mentioned the matter to me, and I agreed with him at once that
something ought to be done, and that we, could not act too quickly.
I therefore suggested that we should come a little way out of our
road to ask you to allow us to put your name on the committee."</p>

<p>"You may put my name on the committee if you think it will do
any good there," replied Stirling, "but I don't know anything about
arranging tea-fights and things. I daresay we might furnish a table
though. What do you think, Ria?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sterling looked inquiringly at Ruby, who was standing
behind her father's chair, listening with much interest to the
conversation.</p>

<p>Ruby nodded approvingly; so Mrs. Sterling said she thought she
could manage it if she had time to make her preparations.</p>

<p>"You shall have ample notice when the date is fixed," promised
Mr. Meredith, "and I must thank you sincerely."</p>

<p>"And I," said Mr. Pogson, "must also express my grateful
acknowledgements for your sympathetic appreciation of our work and
labours. I thank you for the Hospital Committee, and myself; for in
the Words of our Master, 'Inasmuch as you have done it to the least
of these, you have done it unto Me.' Therefore I thank you
personally, for myself."</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith shifted uneasily in his chair, and Ruby noticed
that for a moment his face wore an expression of pain. It was only
for a moment, however, and the Cloud passed quickly. Then, in his
usual cheery tone, he said:</p>

<p>"There is also another matter." Here he gave a quick glance at
Ruby. "I am a firm believer in good, wholesome recreation,
therefore wish to make the musical portion a special feature in the
programme. I have been told," continued Mr. Meredith, "that one of
your daughters sings very nicely, and I would like her to allow me
to put her name on the programme."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mr. Sterling, to whom the question was
addressed, "my daughter, Ruby, sings to me sometimes, and I enjoy
her singing. I'm no great judge of music, nor singing, but I can
say that her singing always goes straight to my old heart. It may
be because she's my lassie. It may be because I never have the
chance to hear any one else sing by themselves. It may, be that I
generally hear her singing when my day's work is over, and I am
resting on the verandah, and smoking my pipe in peace, or it may be
a hundred other things. But I have often thought that if the Angels
sing sweeter than my Ruby, Heaven must be a real good place to live
in."</p>

<p>"Then I hope that I may add Miss Sterling's name to the list,"
said Mr. Meredith.</p>

<p>"It lies with the girl herself," answered Sterling, glancing at
Ruby. "If she sings, you won't be disappointed. What say,
Rube?"</p>

<p>But Ruby did not speak. In spite of sundry nods and nudges from
Madge, who had gone to her side, Ruby stood with her face partly
hidden by her long black hair, her eyes cast down so that they were
completely shaded by the long lashes that fringed them, while her
fingers were busily employed in straightening out a piece of
embroidery which ornamented her best Sunday apron.</p>

<p>"Would you not like to do something for the Hospital," said Mr.
Meredith; kindly.</p>

<p>"I would like to do anything in my power," said Ruby, in a
faltering voice, "but I am not a good singer. Father only thinks
so, and I am sure I could never sing before a crowd of people."</p>

<p>"Will you think it over?" asked the parson, "and let me know.
There is plenty of time, and I am sure that Mrs. Meredith would be
delighted, if you could spare the time to run into Eugowra, to
assist you to practise your song. In fact," he added, "if you
cannot come to Eugowra, I will drive Mrs. Meredith over some day,
and you can practise here. Will you think it over, and let me
know?"</p>

<p>Ruby hesitated for a moment, and then, without raising her head
or lifting her eyes, she said timidly, "Yes, Yes, I will think it
over, and let you know."</p>

<p>"Thank you;" said the minister, heartily. "And remember that
what we are doing is for the relief of those suffering one who are
unable to help themselves."</p>

<p>After the parson and his companion had ridden away an animated
discussion arose among the members of the Sterling family. Mrs.
Sterling's thoughts were directed mainly to the furnishing of the
promised table; George Sterling was principally concerned about the
invitation to Ruby to sing; Madge was about equally interested in
both matters, while Ruby's thoughts were in such a state of flutter
and confusion that she could not concentrate them upon
anything.</p>

<p>"I think," said Mrs. Sterling, "that some nice ham sandwiches,
jam roll, plum cake and fancy cakes, with some of Ruby's sweet
biscuits, and a few pounds of lollies from the store, and some
custards and jellies, with some nice thin bread and butter, and
plenty of fruit, ought to make the table look very nice."</p>

<p>"Nobody eats bread and butter at a tea-meeting," said Madge.</p>

<p>"Oh, we must have it on the table," replied her mother. "I
suppose the people at Bindawalla will give a table, and I should
not like theirs to look better than ours."</p>

<p>"There is no danger, old woman," said Sterling. "You can furnish
a table with the best of them. How about some poultry?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it will be necessary," said she.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Sterling, doubtfully. "The Raymonds might
have poultry on their table. But what is Ruby going to sing?"</p>

<p>"And what are we going to wear?" asked Madge.</p>

<p>"There's time enough to settle about the eatables and the
dress," said Sterling, "but Ruby has to practise her song after she
has chosen it, and there ain't no time to be lost. Did the parson
say that young Raymond was going to sing?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ruby.</p>

<p>"Him sing!" exclaimed Sterling, with contempt, "I bet he can't
sing for sour apples."</p>

<p>"He has had lessons," said Ruby.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" inquired Madge.</p>

<p>"He told me so, that day&mdash;last week&mdash;when he
called."</p>

<p>"Oh, he did, did he?" said her father. "Just like all the
Raymonds. They think because they're squatters that they con do
anything. But lessons can't make a singer. You can't teach a horse
to sing, or a cow, or a wombat. Why? Because they haven't got the
voice. Now, that's what you have got. I'll back you to sing 'Oft in
the Stilly Night' better than all the Raymond family put
together!"</p>

<p>He mopped his forehead with his handkerchief, and looked around
the room, as if he expected somebody to take up his challenge.</p>

<p>"But I didn't promise to sing at all," said Ruby, "I don't think
I could sing before a lot of people."</p>

<p>"All stuff and nonsense," said her father. "There won't be many
there that you don't know. You're able to sing, and what's there to
be afeared of? Now, if it was me, it would be different. I know I
can't sing, and it would be natural for me to be nervous. But you
know you can, and that makes all the difference. Besides, it will
only be like a family party. You are not asked to sing before the
Queen!" Then, after a pause, he continued. "I can shear a sheep
with here and there one, and I can take off all the wool without
skinning the poor beggar, but although I know I can do it, I
believe if I had to go into a Royal Palace, and shear a sheep
before the Queen that I should feel a bit shaky. Doing anything
would be difficult if you had to do it before the Queen, but
<i>you've</i> got no cause to be nervous."</p>

<p>The words of her father brought vividly to Ruby's mind a vision
she had had whilst swinging on a bough in the orchard that same
afternoon. She had been reading of a little girl who had ultimately
become a great personage and who had had the honour of appearing
before Queen Victoria. She had envied that little girl, and kept
wondering in her own mind how it must feel to be commanded to
appear before the Queen, and, in a dreamy sort of way, she conjured
up a pleasing vision of herself singing before Her Gracious
Majesty.</p>

<p>"Sing before the Queen!" Why, they were the very words that had
been ringing in her ears as she crossed the orchard. She thought of
the good little girl, and wondered whether assisting to benefit the
Hospital would make the vision any more of reality than before. She
dreaded the ordeal of singing in public, for since her meeting with
Leslie Raymond she had somehow lost faith in her own ability to
sing. Truly, he had praised her voice, but he had told her that it
wanted training and cultivating, and that she ought to take
lessons. She pondered over the matter all the evening, and tried to
frame all sorts of excuses for declining to sing, but none of them
seemed to her sufficient. All the time a small voice seemed to
whisper to her inmost soul that she would have to sing at the
tea-meeting. Long after she had gone to bed, and after Madge was
fast asleep, she argued the matter in her mind. Her reason said,
"You cannot sing. You don't know how to sing. You are too nervous,
and you will fail in the attempt. People will laugh at you." Her
instinct said, in language quite devoid of reason, "You <i>must</i>
sing. Fate has willed it that you <i>shall</i> sing. <i>He</i> will
not laugh at you, for he praised your voice. Besides, some day you
will sing before the Queen." And, with this last ridiculous
argument in her mind, she yielded to the voice of instinct, and
fell asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4. RUBY SINGS IN
PUBLIC.</h2>

<p>The folks at Bindawalla did not furnish a table for the
tea-meeting, but they sent a cheque which was quite as
effective.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith visited, pleaded, planned, and organised until his
enthusiasm proved contagious, and the forthcoming tea-meeting
assumed the proportions of a great event.</p>

<p>Ruby selected her song and practised diligently until her father
said she sang it splendidly. Ruby was not quite so satisfied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith made two calls, but on neither occasion was her
visit an unqualified success. She was an accomplished musician, and
passionately fond of music; she believed in doing everything
correctly and precisely, and so she never played without the
score.</p>

<p>The first time she called she found that Ruby had selected a
song, but had not a copy of the music, and as Mrs. Meredith could
not accompany her without, the visit proved abortive. Mr. Meredith,
however, procured a copy from Forbes, and on Mrs. Meredith's next
visit Ruby had her first practice. As she did not know a note of
music, the printed score was useless to her, and the accompaniment,
being played in exact accordance with the music, rather hindered
than helped her.</p>

<p>In vain Mrs. Meredith pointed out that Ruby was singing the
wrong time, that certain notes were quavers, not crochets, and
asked Ruby to commence again. Ruby tried, but she had a confused
notion that a quaver was a higher note than a crochet, so she sang
out of tune, and the result was discord.</p>

<p>However, Mrs. Meredith was delighted with Ruby's voice, and it
was agreed that Ruby should ride into Eugowra early on the day of
the tea-meeting, lunch with the Merediths, and have a final
rehearsal.</p>

<p>Leslie Raymond was still training Bunyip for the show, and, as
it was absolutely necessary to train him over some stiff jumps, and
none seemed to Leslie so suitable as those near "Old Joe's Flat,"
it became quite a common occurrence for Leslie to call at
Sterling's house on his way home.</p>

<p>He laughed heartily when he was informed by Ruby that she was
nervous.</p>

<p>"Why should you feel nervous?" said he. "By Jove, if I had a
voice as good as yours, I would sing anywhere. Now, I can't sing at
all. When I was boarding in Sydney, if I tried to sing the fellows
used to shy things at me. I used to keep one eye on the music, and
the other on the sofa cushions. I did not promise to sing at this
tea-meeting.</p>

<p>"Mr. Meredith met the pater when he was driving into Eugowra
with my sister Nell, and he asked Nell to sing. She can sing a
little, but she said she couldn't, and promised him that I would.
Of course I could not go back on Nell, so I suppose I must try. I
shall keep a sharp lookout for the flying missiles, but I don't
think I shall be nervous. It will be fun for me, but not for those
who have to listen."</p>

<p>Ruby lunched with Mrs. Meredith as agreed, had her final
rehearsal, and was still in doubt as to whether a crochet was
higher than a quaver, or whether G. was louder than D., or only
longer. As there was also in one part of the song two bars rest,
and she had not the remotest idea when a bar was, she was in great
trouble as to the result.</p>

<p>The School of Arts was a plain weatherboard building, standing
on a fair-sized plot of land, which was enclosed within a split
post and rail fence. It had a main hall about fifty feet by thirty,
at one end of which was a raised platform. Behind the platform,
communicating with it by two doors, were two small rooms, used on
occasions such as this as dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>The tables were arranged in the large hall, and the hot water
was prepared in a portable copper in the adjacent paddock. The
resources of the School of Arts were taxed to their utmost extent.
It is questionable whether such a gathering had ever before been
known in Eugowra.</p>

<p>There was a hush of expectancy when the parson made his entry,
and when he announced that Mr. Pogson would take the chair the
applause was deafening. Mr. Pogson bowed his acknowledgements, and
then said grace, after which the business began. The attack was
sudden, vigorous and simultaneous, but the tables sustained the
onslaught well, and, in spite of repeated demands for more
sandwiches, more tea, and another piece of cake, the supply proved
equal to the demand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sterling's table was especially patronised, and deservedly
so. Mr. Sterling was there, and as he had donned a starched shirt
and collar for the occasion, and had, contrary to his usual custom,
had a shave in the middle of the week, he looked as uncomfortable
as he usually looked on Sunday, but much happier.</p>

<p>Leslie Raymond had just been praising some exceptionally fine
fruit confections, and whether by accident or design, in addressing
George Sterling, had called him Mr. Sterling. George Sterling
unbent at once, and became as affable as his stiff cellar would
allow him to be, and proudly explained to Leslie that the fruit
confection was made by Ruby, with fruit grown on "Old Joe's Flat,"
The postmaster was at Mrs. Sterling's table, so was the bank
manager, and with him a friend who happened to be up on a visit
from Sydney.</p>

<p>This gentleman, being a visitor to the district, was about the
only person in the room who was not known by sight to every other
person; but, judging from his manner, and the shouts of laughter
that occasionally burst from his end of the table, he did not feel
at all lonely. He was a little, plump man, with a round,
clean-shaven face, and long hair. He had bright, keen eyes, the
brightness of which was enhanced by a pair of gold-rimmed
spectacles, and he spoke with a German accent. He was telling funny
little stories, and playing little practical jokes, while the other
folks were eating and drinking. The meal being over, the hall was
cleared, the seats were re-arranged, and Mr. Pogson having taken
his seat on the platform the concert commenced.</p>

<p>The first item was a pianoforte solo by Mrs. Meredith. It was a
classical piece, above the heads of the audience, and as the piano
was slightly out of tune, her performance did not meet with the
appreciation that it merited.</p>

<p>The chairman, having requested the people at the back to refrain
from whistling and stamping their feet, called upon Mr. Leslie
Raymond to sing "The Midshipmate." Leslie possessed a fair baritone
voice, his sister accompanied him, and as he had sung the song
hundreds of times to her accompaniment, and had never known what
nervousness meant, he got through his task triumphantly, and was
enthusiastically encored.</p>

<p>In vain did the chairman hold up his hand in a mute appeal for
silence. The little German bumped his stick on the floor, the back
portion of the audience stamped and whistled more than ever, and
those outside, who had climbed up to get a glimpse of the
proceeding through the windows, shouted "Encore!"</p>

<p>They did not desist until Leslie led his sister on to the
platform again, and she smilingly took her seat at the piano.
Leslie then sang, with much spirit, "Old Simon the Cellarer," which
again brought down the house, although Mr. Pogson remarked, when he
saw Mr. Meredith applauding the song, that "although he gave Mr.
Raymond every credit for his good intentions, he thought the
sentiments contained in tho song were hardly calculated to instil
into the minds of the audience those principles of temperance and
chastity which it ought to be the desire of every God-fearing man
to inculcate."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson then announced that Miss Ruby Sterling would sing a
song. Many of the audience had heard that George Sterling's
daughter could sing, some had even heard her voice at the little
Presbyterian Church on Sundays, and so the announcement was greeted
with great applause. There was a murmur of admiration as she was
led on to the platform by Mr. Meredith, and one irreverent young
stockman at the back was heard to exclaim to his mate, "By Jove,
Jim, she's a plum."</p>

<p>The little German, speaking to himself, said, "Ach! By Jove,"
and settled himself in his seat to listen.</p>

<p>Ruby was dressed in white, in her hair a red rose, which was the
only colour she wore. She had a roll of music in her hand, but this
was for appearance sake, not for use. She stood, clutching it
nervously, and once&mdash;only once&mdash;she raised her long, dark
lashes, and stole a timid glance at the audience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith played the prelude to the song, an old-fashioned,
simple thing, that Ruby had sung to her father a score of times,
but Ruby did not seem to hear her. Mrs. Meredith played the prelude
again, and this time Ruby commenced her song.</p>

<p>As the first notes of her voice broke upon the audience, every
other sound was hushed. Even the distant buzz of conversation on
the outside of the building ceased. She sang the first line, and
although she sang crochets where she should have sung quavers, Mrs.
Meredith waited for her. Then came the second line, where there
were two bars' rest, in which there occurred a pretty little piece
of accompaniment which Mrs. Meredith prided herself upon being able
to play effectively. When Ruby leapt over the two bars, and
continued straight on, Mrs. Meredith thumped a little to remind
her. So Ruby stopped, and Mrs. Meredith kept on, which gave Ruby
the impression that she should not have stopped, so she commenced
the line again. By this time Mrs. Meredith had reached the end of
the line, and hearing Ruby commence again, she ceased playing
altogether.</p>

<p>Ruby sang a few more notes, and then, seeming to get frightened
at the sound of her own voice, she faltered and ceased her
song.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood as if dazed. Again she lifted her eyes
and looked appealingly at the upturned faces in front. She saw the
faces peering through the windows, and the glare of the kerosene
lamps, and then she saw no more. She clutched convulsively at the
music in her hand, and turned deathly pale. Then her grasp relaxed,
the music fell to the floor, and her hands dropped helplessly to
her sides. She reeled, and would have fallen, had not Leslie
Raymond, who had been watching from the dressing-room, ran forward
and caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>There was great excitement among the audience, and many pressed
forward toward the platform, but the little German sat, leaning
upon his stick, and gazing through his gold-rimmed glasses into
space.</p>

<p>Under the tender care of her mother, Mrs. Meredith, and Miss
Raymond, the colour soon returned to Ruby's cheeks. She felt
ashamed of her weakness, and was bitterly disappointed at her
failure, but Mrs. Meredith readily excused her, and endeavoured to
take the blame upon herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson delivered his exhortation, which took some time, and
succeeded in thinning the audience considerably.</p>

<p>A special collection was made for the Hospital funds, Mr.
Meredith pronounced the benediction, and the audience
dispersed.</p>

<p>When the time arrived for saying good-night, Ruby thanked Miss
Raymond for her kindness, but that young lady simply said:</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! What is there to thank me for? I am sorry you
broke down. I would have given a pound if it had been Leslie
instead, but he has a hide like a rhinoceros. He would never break
down. How are you going home? Are you riding or driving?"</p>

<p>"I rode in," answered Ruby.</p>

<p>"But I don't think you ought to ride out," said Miss
Raymond.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Ruby, "I can manage it all right. I could sleep on
horseback."</p>

<p>"I dare say you could," said Nell, "when you are well, but you
might be taken faint again. Leslie and I drove in, in the sulky. We
pass your place. Suppose I ride your horse, and you take my place
in the sulky? We can all go together, you know."</p>

<p>Ruby said that she did not know whether her father would
agree.</p>

<p>"I'll soon settle that," said Nell, and away she went to lay her
suggestion before George Sterling.</p>

<p>Sterling had no very kind feeling towards the Raymonds, but no
real ill will. He had a great objection to being patronised by
anybody, and a great faith in his own manly independence. He was
always ready to resent an affront, especially if it came from
those, who, by wealth, education, or social position, were likely
to consider themselves his superiors, but he was too generous to
repel a kindness. Leslie Raymond had called him "Mr." Sterling, and
so placed him on a level of equality, and now Miss Raymond came
with an offer, which he felt was prompted by nothing but kindness.
He therefore responded in the same way.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of Ruby being able to ride home all right," he
said, "but if so be as you desire it, and she is willing, and it is
agreeable to Mr. Raymond, I have no objection."</p>

<p>Nell went back, and it being found that it was agreeable to Mr.
Raymond, it was arranged that Ruby should be driven home in the
sulky, and that Nell should ride Ruby's horse.</p>

<p>So they started off in the moonlight. It was ten miles to
Sterling's house, but it seemed to Leslie the shortest ten miles he
had ever driven. He was careful to keep the rug well round Ruby,
for fear that she should catch cold, and he rallied her so kindly
and sympathetically about her failure, that long before she got to
the house she was able to laugh at her own weakness.</p>

<p>Many a time, when the passing years had made that night a
memory, did Ruby in her dreams recall to mind the alterations of
light and shadow connected with that moonlight drive. The splashing
of the horse as they crossed the creek, when the water was almost
level with the floor of the sulky. The long, straggling line of
fences, the shadow of the willows, the gaunt, spectral limbs of the
dead gum trees, the melancholy note of the mopoke, and the far-off
howl of a dingo, were all indelibly photographed upon her mind. So
were the tinkle of the bullock bell near the cross roads where some
teamsters camped, and the ruddy faces of the men, made more ruddy
by the flickering of the camp fire, near which they sat and
smoked.</p>

<p>All one stage of the journey Leslie lit a cigar. Ruby seldom in
after life smelt the aroma of a cigar, but she fancied she detected
in it the scent of the pine logs as they burned, at the teamsters'
camp fire. To both Ruby and Leslie the ride seemed short; and yet
in the minds of both it left sweeter and more lasting memories than
any journey they had ever taken.</p>

<p>When home was reached, and farewells said, when Leslie and his
sister had driven away, when Sterling had prayed, and, save for the
moonbeam which threw a line of light across her bed, all was silent
and dark, Ruby's thoughts reviewed the events of the evening, and
she smiled as a small voice seemed to whisper, "<i>He</i> did not
laugh at you. <i>He</i> was kind and sympathetic. <i>He</i> did not
laugh."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5. HERR BATONSTEIN.</h2>

<p>About eleven o'clock in the forenoon, on the day following the
tea-meeting, Ruby was busy in the dining-room. She was humming to
herself as she wielded her feather-duster, very carefully dusting
the picture of the Queen, and re-arranging the lyre-birds' tails
with which it was flanked. She dusted the old American clock that
ticked away upon the shelf above the fireplace, and the china
shepherd boy and, girl that stood on each side of it. She dusted
the old couch, and the chairs, flicked off a speck that still
lingered on the stock of her father's double-barrelled gun that
hung above the clock, and then went out into the front garden to
cut fresh flowers with which to fill the vases.</p>

<p>She had cut a small bunch of late roses, and was stepping over
the flower-bed to get within reach of some more, when she became
conscious that somebody was watching her, for she heard a deep
sigh, which was almost a groan, proceeding from the sliprail in the
fence which divided the ground surrounding the house from the track
leading to the main road.</p>

<p>There she saw a figure on horseback, and she had much difficulty
in recognising in the rider the little German who had so amused the
folks at the tea-meeting.</p>

<p>His hat was off, and his spectacles were missing. His coat
sleeves were ruffled almost up to his elbows, his trousers were up
to his knees, and below them was visible two fat calves, which wore
burnt red with exposure to the sun. His feet were dangling near the
stirrups, which they tried in vain to reach. With his elbows at
right angles to his body, and his hands very wide apart, he grasped
one end of the bridle in each hand. One end of his collar was
unbuttoned, and stuck straight out before him like an arm on a
semaphore, and his necktie had slipped round under his ear. His
face bore an expression of intense suffering, which he tried in
vain to conceal. He cut such a comical figure that Ruby could
scarcely refrain from laughing outright, especially when she espied
Madge crouching down behind the water cask, stuffing her apron into
her mouth.</p>

<p>"Good morning to you," said the visitor, in rather shaky
accents. "Good morning."</p>

<p>Then, as the horse whisked its tail to knock off a troublesome
fly, he added tremulously, "Lie down, you brute. No, I don't mean
lie down, I mean stand still." Then again addressing Ruby, he said:
"It vas a very fine day this morning, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Ruby passed through the little wicket, and approached the
sliprail.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, smiling, "it is a very fine day."</p>

<p>She put down the sliprails, and the horse walked in, while its
rider literally fell on its neck and groaned.</p>

<p>They stopped before the garden gate, and Ruby stood waiting for
him to dismount, but he did not attempt to do so. He sat looking at
her for awhile, shifting uneasily in his saddle, and then, looking
very solemn, and extremely sad, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It vas a very fine day this morning, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ruby. She was wondering what to do or to say
next, when, to her intense relief, she saw her father coming round
from the back of the house. He bade the visitor good morning.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said the German; vainly endeavouring to suppress
a groan, "it vas a fine morning, to-day, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Then he jerked out, rather than said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must, Ach!&mdash;forgive my impoliteness (groan). I can't
raise mine&mdash;Ach! mine hat to you&mdash;because&mdash;I hafe
lost it; und I can't gif you mine&mdash;Ach!&mdash;card,
because&mdash;to gif you mine card&mdash;I must leave go, and if I
leave go&mdash;Oh! dear! I shall fall off."</p>

<p>"Won't you get off?" said Sterling.</p>

<p>"I would like to get off, if I could, but I don't know if I
could manage it," said the German doubtfully. "But if you vill keep
der horse still I vill try."</p>

<p>Sterling caught hold of the bridle, and after several vain
attempts the German lifted his right leg, knelt with his knee upon
the horse's back, and dangled his left foot in a vain effort to
find the stirrup.</p>

<p>Ruby, seeing his difficulty, was about to spring forward to his
assistance, when the horse shook himself slightly, the law of
equilibrium asserted itself, and the law of gravitation did the
rest. The German landed safely and solidly upon his back.</p>

<p>The Moment the most chubby part of his anatomy touched the
ground, he rolled quickly over upon his side, where he lay for some
seconds, drawing his fat, red calves up and down, and groaning
audibly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired Sterling, uncertain, whether to
laugh or to be alarmed. "Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"Oh! No," said the little man, "I vas not ill, and I vas not
vell; but I am sore. Oh! so sore. I am sore all over. I am sore
inside, and I am sore outside. I am sore at the top, and I am sore
at the (ach!) underneath. Every tooth in mine head vas loose. Mine
toe-nails, mine finer-nails, and mine eyebrows vas sore. I am sore
all over. Oh! so sore! Vhy did I ever been persuaded to try such
monkey tricks, and ride on horse's back!"</p>

<p>He struggled, with difficulty, to his feet, and as he
straightened his trousers, George Sterling inquired whether this
was his first attempt to ride.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the German, as he accepted Sterling's invitation
to come in, walking meanwhile very stiffly, and with his legs wide
apart, "it is mine first attempt, and if I ever live to get back
safe to Eugowra, you may bet your hat it vill be mine last."</p>

<p>Thy entered the house, and Ruby brought forward her father's
large arm-chair, which had a soft cushion. The German sat down,
very slowly and deliberately, and gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Ach!" said he, "thank you, mine dear. That vas good, very
good."</p>

<p>Feeling at length that he had his hands at liberty, he produced
his card case, and drawing out a card he handed it to Sterling.</p>

<p>George Sterling turned the card round once or twice. He looked
at the front, and at the back, and then, handing it to Ruby, he
said:</p>

<p>"Here, Rube, read what it says. I can't see without my
specs."</p>

<p>Ruby glanced at the card, and read aloud, "Herr Batonstein."</p>

<p>"That is mine name," said the German, proudly. "Let me take the
liberty to introduce mineself."</p>

<p>In spite of his stiffness, he rose and bowed to Sterling, and
then ceremoniously to Ruby, and also to Madge who, with a very red
face, had just entered the room.</p>

<p>Sitting down again, he told them that be had been very anxious
about Ruby. He had heard her commence her song and her voice had
charmed him&mdash;fascinated him. He was afraid she might be
indisposed, and thought it his duty to inquire after her health. No
other means of transit being available, he had been persuaded to
accept the loan of the bank manager's horse.</p>

<p>"Ach! That horse!" he exclaimed, reminded of his fearful
experience. "Ach! That horse!! That quadruped! With his shog shog.
Oh! I am so sore. But I did not come to tell you I vas sore, I came
to inquire after Miss Sterling's health."</p>

<p>"I am quite well to-day, thank you," said Ruby.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it," said Herr Batonstein. "To know it
will repay me for all mine sufferings. But I vas thinking of you
all night. I did not sleep much for thinking of you but when I did
sleep, I could hear you sing&mdash;and see you fainting in my
dream."</p>

<p>Ruby blushed, and hung her head, which being noticed by Herr
Batonstein, he chuckled, and then laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>"Vhy," he exclaimed, "did you think because I dream about you
that I come to make love to you? If I vas a young man, who knows?
But I am old enough to be your father, and then, Mrs. Batonstein
who vas in Sydney, what would she say about it? No, mine dear, I am
not such an old fool as that," and he laughed again, and rolled
back In his chair, until suddenly reminded of his ride, in a manner
anything but humorous.</p>

<p>Rising to bow to Mrs. Sterling, he discovered that his collar
was all awry, and in loosening his vest to fasten his collar, he
found his spectacles hiding inside.</p>

<p>He made a joke about his collar and another about his
spectacles, but they were soon at their ease. It being nearly lunch
time he accepted Mrs. Sterling's invitation to join them, and that
lady, taking Madge with her, proceeded to the kitchen to make the
necessary preparations.</p>

<p>"Now," said Herr Batonstein, "could I so far trespass on your
kindness as to ask Miss Sterling to sing me a song? There is no
need to be nervous now, you know there is nobody here, for I am
nobody, and it would," he added, with a soft tone in his voice,
"give me so much pleasure."</p>

<p>"Yes, do, Rube," said Sterling, who was glad for her to have the
he opportunity of retrieving to some extent her failure of the
previous evening. "Not the song you tried last night, but something
else. Sing just as you do of an evening, and Mr. Batonstein and I
will smoke."</p>

<p>"Yes. That will do splendidly," said the German, "we will smoke.
I have some cigars somewhere."</p>

<p>He felt in several pockets until he discovered his cigar
case.</p>

<p>"Here we are. Take a cigar, Mr. Sterling, and we will smoke
while Miss Sterling sings."</p>

<p>George Sterling took a cigar, lit it after some trouble, leaned
back in his chair, crossed his legs, and puffed away at his
unaccustomed luxury. Blinking at the smoke, which would persist in
getting into his eyes, he motioned for Ruby Proceed.</p>

<p>After some hesitation she sat down at the little cottage piano
and sang "Ye Banks and Braes o' Bonnie Doon."</p>

<p>During the first verse of the song, the little German sat very
quiet, beating time silently with his fingers upon the arm of his
chair. Gradually he ceased, and sat like one in a trance until the
last note of the song had died away.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," he said, "thank you. It vas beautiful.
Sing another."</p>

<p>Ruby, remaining at the piano, ran her fingers dreamily over the
keys, and then sang "Oft in the Stilly Night." When she had
finished Herr Batonstein sighed, and repeated softly, "Fond memory
brings the light of other days around me."</p>

<p>Ruby, turning round, saw that his eyes, were moist with
tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, please forgive me," she said. "My song has made you
unhappy."</p>

<p>"No, no!" he replied, hastily, but with traces of emotion in his
voice, "no, no. On the contrary, it makes me more happy than I can
say. It is exquisite, charming. I am grateful to you. Very
grateful."</p>

<p>Seeing that her song had made hint sad, Ruby, who had lost all
trace of shyness or timidity, turned to the piano again and sang a
quaint but merry little ditty, to a wonderfully appropriate, if
somewhat inaccurate, accompaniment.</p>

<p>The German was delighted, and when she had finished her song all
trace of his emotion had vanished.</p>

<p>"Your voice is wonderful," said he. "Who taught you to
play?"</p>

<p>"Nobody," answered Ruby. "I just find the notes and make then
fit in."</p>

<p>"Ach!" replied he, "I thought so. You learned your music in tha
same school as the thrush and the lark and the nightingale. In the
school of Nature. You have the true musical instinct, which is the
foundation of Genius. But you want the culture, the training, the
musical knowledge, and then you will be able to interpret the Old
Masters, and put a soul and a spirit into their music that was
never felt by those who made it. You must be trained, my dear, you
must be trained. Such sweet sounds are wasted on the gum trees. The
great world is waiting to hear you sing."</p>

<p>He threw his unfinished cigar out of the window and, taking her
place at the piano, he said, "I can play a little. I vas trained at
the Conservatoire Leipsic, but I have not your musical
instinct."</p>

<p>He struck a few chords, after which he played something, the
name of which Ruby did not know. It was the moat wonderful music
that she had ever heard. Its harmony transported her. As the German
played, she saw in her mind's eye a chapel or monastery in a
strange land, such as she had read about. She saw glistening
cascades, heard the sound of rushing waters, the wind sighing
amongst the trees, the birds twittering, and the singing of the
peasants as they laboured in the field. From the chapel came the
sound of a choir chanting the vesper hymn. Then the sighing of the
wind became a moan, and the hymn a funeral dirge. The scene became
dark, and the gloom of the night hid the chapel and the glittering
waters. Still slower and more mournful the funeral dirge went on.
As it died away, she thought that one by one the stars appeared,
the moon arose, and a blessed peace reigned over all. Suddenly the
choir and peasants and birds is all seemed to blend their voices in
one harmonious song of thanksgiving, and the music ceased.</p>

<p>And Ruby discovered her bodily self as Herr Batonstein turned on
his seat, and smiled.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, "mine music has touched your heart. But we
must not be sad." Turning again to the piano, he sang a song about
"Three jolly, jolly sailor boys," who had just returned from South
Amerikee. At the conclusion of his song, Mrs. Sterling announced
that lunch was ready, and they adjourned to the dining-room, where
the little German made the meal lively by a succession of comic
little anecdotes, the fun of which was made more piquant by his
quaint accent.</p>

<p>After the meal he had to face the problem of returning to
Eugowra. He asked permission to come again, which was cordially
granted, although he vowed that next time, if he could not get a
vehicle, he would walk.</p>

<p>"Oh! That dreadful quadruped!" he said, as Sterling led his
horse to the gate. "I shall be dead when I get to Eugowra."</p>

<p>They got him a chair to assist him to mount, and George Sterling
shortened his stirrups for him. He was considerably relieved in his
mind when he found that by resting his feet in the shortened
stirrups he could greatly ease the rest of his anatomy, which was
still very sore.</p>

<p>Sterling accompanied him across the first paddock, where they
found his hat, and they parted at the roadside with mutual
expressions of goodwill.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6. STRANGE CONDUCT OF LESLIE
RAYMOND.</h2>

<p>Nell Raymond was working in the garden. She was passionately
fond of flowers, and although they kept at Bindawalla a gardener to
attend to the flowers, lawns, and shrubberies, as well as a
Chinaman whose duty it was to provide the house with vegetables,
Nell's roses were her own particular hobby. Her task completed, she
picked a few choice buds to take with her to the house. She tripped
across the lawn, passed the fountain that threw a spray of water
over the rockwork and ferns that surrounded it, and on to the broad
verandah that extended along the front and two sides of the house.
Seated on one of the lounges scattered about the verandah, with his
arms folded over his breast, and a sullen look on his face, was her
brother Leslie.</p>

<p>Nell selected her choicest bud, and placing the rest on a small
table near at hand, she fixed it in Leslie's buttonhole. She had
scarcely finished when he pushed her away impatiently, and resumed
his former attitude.</p>

<p>"You ungrateful thing," said Nell, indignantly. "What do you
mean by receiving my present like that? I have a good mind to take
it away again."</p>

<p>Leslie, so far from showing any contrition, simply pulled the
rose from his buttonhole, and threw it among the others on the
table.</p>

<p>"Whatever is the Matter with you this morning," said Nell, as
she looked at him in surprise, "aren't you well, Les?"</p>

<p>Rising from his seat, he thrust his hands into his pockets, and
paced the verandah with quick, impatient strides.</p>

<p>Nell watched him with astonishment. She had never seen him in
such a mood before. As he passed her for the third or fourth time,
she linked her arm in his and walked by his side. He tried gently
to disengage her arm, but she clung to him lovingly and said in a
coaxing way:</p>

<p>"Now look here, Les. Something has happened to vex you, and I am
going to know all about it. Tell me what is the matter, and let me
help you."</p>

<p>"You cannot help me, Nell. Nobody can help me."</p>

<p>"Tell me and let me try. You are older than I, but since our
mother died I have tried to fill her place to you as well as my
own. If I had a sorrow I would tell you all about it. Won't you at
least give me your confidence?"</p>

<p>"Nell," said Leslie, stopping abruptly in his walk, and looking
her full in the face, "I have been badly treated, and grossly
insulted. You say you have been a mother to me as well as a sister.
I acknowledge all that. I have heard you say that you were proud of
your brother."</p>

<p>"So I am," replied Nell, "I do not believe there is a better
brother, a better son, or a braver man in all the world than my
brother."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a smile, but he laughed scornfully at
her enthusiasm, and said:</p>

<p>"Yes; I don't think I am deficient in courage. I never remember
feeling afraid of anything yet, but this morning I have been
treated as a child. I have been spoken to in a worse manner than a
blackfellow would speak to his dog. I have been threatened with a
horse-whipping, and did not dare to retaliate."</p>

<p>"Why," said Nell, indignantly, "who has dared?" Then seeing the
look of pain on his face, she kissed him affectionately and said,
"Tell me all about it, dear."</p>

<p>"Nell, I swear that if any other man in all the world had spoken
to me in the same way, and used the same threat, I would have
knocked him down if he had been as big as a gum tree, or as strong
as a bull. As it was, I had to swallow the insult and run away.
Nell, it was the pater."</p>

<p>"Oh! Leslie," said Nell, in dismay, "whatever is the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Well, it all arose out of his absurd prejudice against free
selectors in general, and George Sterling in particular. He said I
must understand that in future when going to, or returning from
Eugowra, I must go by the top road. I asked him why. Then he burst
out into a torrent of abuse about free selectors, and the
differences in social status, and all that sort of rot. He said he
saw me walking with George Sterling's daughter at the show, and
dancing with her at the ball. He spoke of the strict rule that is
always observed at the show ball of drawing a chalk line across the
floor so that the squatters and their set may use one end of the
room, and not be contaminated by too close a proximity to the
selectors and tradesfolk, who use the other end. He told me that I
had offended the Maxwells from Wallandool, and the Thorntons from
Daroublegie, and insisted that I should apologise to them at the
first opportunity."</p>

<p>"How did you offend them!" asked Nell.</p>

<p>"I asked Ruby Sterling to dance," said he, "and I took her
across the chalk line, to the side where I had an acknowledged
right to be, and joined a set of lancers in which were some of the
Maxwells and Thorntons. They treated my partner with contempt, and
when the time came to turn partners Wally Thornton ignored her
presence, like the cad he is, and left the girl standing by
herself. I took her away, and broke up their set. Apologise! The
first time I meet him I intend to pull his nose. Think of the folly
of it all. Thornton's ancestors were convicts, Wally was expelled
from the Warrigal Club in Sydney for cheating at cards, and Mrs.
Maxwell was divorced by her first husband before she married
Maxwell. Imagine such people being disgraced by finding themselves
in the same set with Ruby Sterling!"</p>

<p>"But, Leslie," said Nell, quietly, "you know it has always been
the rule."</p>

<p>"Damn the rule!" said Leslie, adding hastily, "I beg your
pardon, Nell, but it is an absurd, and an unjust one. The
tradespeople pay the same price as others, many of them are better
off than those in the other set&mdash;better off, and more
cultured. And yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that all that occurred!" asked Nell, as he paused.</p>

<p>"No, it is not," answered her brother. "The dad insisted that I
should apologise, and I flatly refused. Then he made an insulting
allusion to Sterling's daughter, which I resented. He insisted that
I should promise never to go near Sterling's house, nor speak to
Ruby again, and I respectfully and firmly declined to give him such
a promise. Upon that he broke into a most ungovernable rage. He
called me all sorts of names, the mildest and most complimentary of
which were idiot, puppy, whelp, cad, and so on. Then he threatened
to knock me down.</p>

<p>"I believe I laughed. You know, Nell, I am nearly six inches
taller than he, besides being three stone heavier and not half his
age. When you remember that the last year I was at the Grammar
School I took the prize for the best all-round athlete in the
combined schools, it is no wonder I laughed when he said he would
knock me down. But, by Jove, the old fellow was very much in
earnest, for he welted up his riding whip, which was on the table
in his office, and he would have horsewhipped me if I had not
<i>run away</i>! Think of that, Nell, your big, brave brother RAN
AWAY.</p>

<p>"What followed reminded me of a paper chase. Of course I had all
the best of it. The office table was between us, and that gave the
a start. I made for the door, and he after me. I ran along the
hall, and he followed. I didn't think the old fellow was such a
good sprinter, but his mettle was up.</p>

<p>"I dodged through the drawing-room, and almost upset your
sketches that were on the easel. In trying to save them, he nearly
caught me, but I bolted through the French light, and leapt the
railing of the verandah on to the lawn. This checked him, but did
not stop him, for he climbed over, and came puffing after me. I
made for the avenue leading to the poultry yard, and this being a
straight run, I had him at my mercy. When I got to the end I looked
back, and he was sitting on the gardener's wheelbarrow, rubbing his
shin with one hand, shaking the whip at me with the other, and
swearing with as much volubility as he had breath for."</p>

<p>"What followed?" inquired Nell.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Leslie, carelessly. "That was the last I saw of
him. I believe he has since driven off to the woolshed."</p>

<p>"Oh! Leslie," said Nell, "I am so sorry that all this has
occurred. But tell me. You do not care seriously for Sterling's
daughter, do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said he, "I have never asked myself the
question." Then, seeing Andy in the distance, he called to him,
"Andy, put the saddle on Bunyip."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Leslie?" inquired Nell.</p>

<p>"I am going to George Sterling's," he replied, doggedly. "I
promised Ruby&mdash;that is, Miss Sterling&mdash;that I would take
her a magazine this morning, and I am going to take it."</p>

<p>"But think, Leslie. What will father say?"</p>

<p>"He must say what he likes, my dear. Do you think I am a child?
There! Good-bye. Forgive me if I was rude."</p>

<p>So saying, he mounted Bunyip, and cantered away in the direction
of Old Joe's Flat.</p>

<p>He found the family at morning lunch, and was invited to join
them. After some conversation with George Sterling in which sheep
formed the principal topic, Sterling sighed and remarked, "We are
going to lose Ruby."</p>

<p>Leslie's hand shook as he replaced his cup and saucer on the
table.</p>

<p>"Lose Ruby?" he echoed. "How? Where is she going?"</p>

<p>"She is going to Sydney," replied Sterling.</p>

<p>The information was so unexpected that Leslie did not know what
to answer, so he simply stammered:</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Sterling, "she is going to study singing, and
music, and all sorts of things."</p>

<p>"But this is sudden, is it not?" enquired Leslie, "How has it
all been arranged?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Sterling, as he filled his pipe, "do you remember
the little German who was at the tea-meeting at Eugowra?"</p>

<p>"What," said Leslie, "the little man with the gold-rimmed
spectacles?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sterling, "that is the man. It seems he is a
professor of music. He is going to take Ruby in hand, as he calls
it, and teach her to sing."</p>

<p>"But he is a stranger to you," said Leslie, "is he not?"</p>

<p>"What," laughed Sterling, "Batonstein a stranger? Not he."</p>

<p>"I thought you had never met him before the night of the tea
meeting."</p>

<p>"No more we had," said Sterling. "He was a stranger then, but
that was two months ago. He has been here dozens of times since
then. The bank manager is an old friend of his, and says he is one
of the greatest musicians living. He is very well off, too, and
only plays or teaches now as a sort of hobby. Ruby is to live with
her aunt and to spend all her time in study. I didn't like the idea
at first, but they have talked me over."</p>

<p>"When is Miss Sterling going?" inquired Leslie.</p>

<p>"In about a fortnight," replied Mrs. Sterling, as she rose to
help Madge clear the table.</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" said Sterling, "this won't get rid of the
briars."</p>

<p>Lighting his pipe, he went out to attend to his work. Soon
after, Mrs. Sterling and Madge retired to the kitchen to wash up,
and Leslie and Ruby were alone. He sat, idly tapping his leather
legging with his riding whip, and gazed at Ruby, who was struggling
hopelessly with a dropped stitch in her knitting.</p>

<p>"So," he remarked, clearing his throat, "you are going to
Sydney."</p>

<p>She nodded her head slowly, but did not reply or raise her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What put the idea into your head?"</p>

<p>"I think," she answered softly, "that you first put it
there."</p>

<p>"I?" he exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, putting down her knitting in despair. "Don't
you remember the day you met me up the gully driving home the cows?
You told mo that I ought to take some lessons. I have been thinking
of it ever since, and was delighted when Herr Batonstein offered to
teach me. He is awfully good, and awfully funny, and they say he is
a splendid teacher."</p>

<p>Leslie looked out of the window, across the flower garden,
bright with many coloured Chrysanthemums, and at the distant hills,
where the purple foliage was outlined against the sky in graceful
undulations. He watched the sunlight dancing on the window, and he
wondered whether the flowers would lose their perfume and
brightness, and the sun its light and warmth when she was gone. He
was aroused from his reverie by Ruby, who asked suddenly:</p>

<p>"Were you in trouble this morning?"</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked in surprise, "what makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were," she replied; "in fact, I knew you were. It
was about half-past seven o'clock. I was in the dairy when I
suddenly felt faint and giddy. I had to sit down, and the dishes,
the churn, the shelves, and the window all seemed to be turning
slowly round. I covered my eyes with, my hand, and then certain
pictures seemed to force themselves upon my imagination. I had a
feeling that there was trouble of some sort, somewhere. Then the
place appeared, and it was Bindawalla. After that I fancied that it
was connected with you and then I knew it was. It also appeared to
me that I had something to do with it, but I reasoned with myself
that that could not possibly be, and so I dismissed the idea. Then
I opened my eyes. Everything was the same as usual, but I knew that
you were in trouble."</p>

<p>"My father and I had a slight difference this morning," said
Leslie, "but it was nothing."</p>

<p>"About seven o'clock?" enquired Ruby.</p>

<p>"About that time."</p>

<p>"I knew it," she said. "Herr Batonstein says that I possess what
he calls 'Second sight,' but it is not that. It is not sight at
all. I see nothing, and hear nothing. I only feel a kind of
warning. It is not even a tangible idea that comes into my mind; it
is the merest ghost or shadow of an idea, but it teaches me, and I
know."</p>

<p>Leslie listened in wonder, marvelling that she should have so
nearly approached the truth; more nearly, in fact, than she herself
thought possible; for, as he knew, she had been closely connected
with his trouble of the morning.</p>

<p>"Miss Sterling," said Leslie, as he took her hand, which with
all the simplicity of a child she allowed him to retain,
"Shakespeare said 'There are more things in Heaven and earth than
are dreamt of in our philosophy.' That was true, and, as a truth is
always a truth, it is true to-day. Since Shakespeare wrote, many
secrets of Nature have been laid bare, and it would be arrogance on
our part to imagine that we know all. We must be content to believe
and wait. In the meantime, call this power of yours what you will,
but cultivate it&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>He dropped her hand, and rose to depart.</p>

<p>"I will not bid you good-bye&mdash;yet," said he; "I shall see
you again before you go."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so," said Ruby. "I don't know what the great world
is like, but ever since I have been thinking of going to Sydney,
every tree and flower, every gully and ridge about the dear old
place seems to develop a charm and beauty hitherto unfelt. But it
is always so through life. We are always bidding good-bye to
something. The old is always giving place to the new."</p>

<p>Leslie wondered whether the new friends would quite take the
place of the old. He was tempted to say more to her, but dare not.
What he had told his sister in the morning was the truth. Whether
he loved this girl or not, was a question he had never asked
himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7. THE SHEARERS' CAMP.</h2>

<p>His first ebullition of temper having cooled, James Raymond did
not allude to the subject of the quarrel; and, as he heard that
Sterling's daughter was going away, he congratulated himself that
Leslie's temptation would he removed. He had no doubt but that his
admonition would hate due effect, and as Leslie went about his work
as usual, Raymond, absorbed in the completion of the woolshed, soon
forgot the incident. He noted that, after Ruby's departure, Leslie
seemed to put additional energy into his work. He took his share of
the most arduous duties, and if a mob of cattle had to be mustered,
and the fat ones cut out for market, Leslie would do the work of
two stockmen.</p>

<p>From early morning until late in the evening he was away,
visiting the out-stations, breaking in a colt, or at other times,
superintending the construction of a dam, or the sinking of a
well.</p>

<p>At last the woolshed was, finished. James Raymond had spared no
expense in its erection, and he prided himself upon the fact that
it was complete in every particular. Provision had been made for
the shearing to be done by machinery, and the necessary power had
been provided. There were hydraulic presses for pressing the wool,
ample room for storing the bales when pressed, and space under the
shed for keeping the sheep dry in case of rain. When the last nail
had been driven, and the last coat of paint was dry, James Raymond
was a proud man as he gazed upon the completion of his long
cherished ideal.</p>

<p>The neighbouring squatters and many from a considerable distance
drove to Bindawalla to see the famous up-to-date woolshed.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond was congratulated upon his enterprise, and for some
weeks the homestead was lively with visitors. The shed was
completed in September, and was in ample time for the shearing,
which commenced at Bindawalla in November. The regular station
hands were busy bringing up the sheep from distant parts of the run
so as to have them handy at shearing time.</p>

<p>From time to time, men with bearded and sun-tanned faces arrived
at the station in twos and threes, to book for the season as
shearers or rouseabouts. They came from all parts. Small selectors
from Monaro, Adelong, Tumut, and Tumbarumba; diggers from
Ironbarks, Hillend, and the Turon; fossickers from Lucknow and the
Abercrombie; with rabbit trappers, kangaroo shooters, and copper
miners from Walla Walla, Burrumbuttock, and Cobar. They were men
who followed shearing during the season, and almost every other
occupation, during the remainder of the year. Some there were who
would carry home their hard-earned cheque to their distant
families, and others who would knock it down at the nearest
pub.</p>

<p>As he men arrived they called at the head station to see the
overseer, and to place their names on the roll. After that, by
order of Mr. Raymond, they were supplied with rations of flour,
meat, tea and sugar, and went away to the camp. This was pitched
about a mile from the head station, in the direction of Old Joe's
Flat, and about half a mile from the new woolshed. There was plenty
of fresh water near the camp, and the men had permission to pasture
their horses in the adjacent paddock.</p>

<p>It was near sundown on one of the last days of October, and
there were over a hundred men in the shearers' camp. The day had
been hot, and the weather was very dry. The men had been spending a
listless clay, some shooting, others lounging about, while some
cooked at the camp tire.</p>

<p>"How's wheat up your way?" said a man with a long tawny beard,
as he scraped the ashes from a damper.</p>

<p>"Fair to middling," said the man addressed, who was sitting on
his haunches, nursing a small magazine rifle. "How's the reef?"</p>

<p>"Oh! the reef's all right," said the first speaker, "but the
blinded gold dropped out of it."</p>

<p>He lifted the damper from the ashes, stood it on its edge to
cool, then throwing a few dry sticks on the fire, he put the billy
on to boil.</p>

<p>"What sport did you have?" he said, resuming the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked his companion, who rejoiced in the name of
Walla Walla Will, because his name was William, and he came from
Walla Walla, "I shot a couple o' wallabies an' a kangaroo rat."</p>

<p>Then, poising his rifle on his arm, he added, "There ain't much
to shoot about here now. If there was, I could shoot it. I can kill
a kangaroo on the jump with this at three hundred yards," and he
patted the rifle affectionately, "and never miss."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Turon Jimmy, drily, "I've heard the likes of you
before. I've seed 'em miss, but I've never heard of 'em
missin'."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe me?" said Will. "Look here! You see that cove
goin' down to the creek for water? I bet I'll put a hole through
his billy as he comes up the bank, an' let the bloomin' water out,
an' never touch him."</p>

<p>"Don't you do anything you might be sorry for," said the other.
"That's Bob Baxter from the Yahoo. He can use his fists, and when
he hits it ain't exactly like a blow from a feather duster. Take
care what your do to Bob. He won't stand any paddymelon
tricks."</p>

<p>"My troubles about his fists," said Walla Walla Will, But the
water bearer returned to the fire with his billy safe and
sound.</p>

<p>"What became of your mate?" inquired Turon Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Which mate?" said Will.</p>

<p>"The long cove with the cock eye. Him that used to ride the
piebald filly."</p>

<p>"Oh! the duke! He went away to Queensland cattle droving. We
always called him the duke on account of his Roman nose. I'm on my
own this year. Great Ghost of Misery! Did you see that snake?"</p>

<p>"Where?" shouted Turon Jimmy, seizing a stick, and springing to
his feet. "Where was he?"</p>

<p>"He went round by the hollow log, and into that tussock of
grass. Look out! There he is again."</p>

<p>The exclamation of Walla Walla Will had attracted the attention
of several men from the other camp fires, and each one seizing a
stick, they joined in the chase of the snake.</p>

<p>"There he goes!" shouted a dozen voices, as the reptile glided
swiftly down the hill in the direction of the creek. "Head the
beggar. Don't let him get to the water!"</p>

<p>"Look out!" shouted Will, "leave him alone. Let him get out of
the brushwood into the clear. He'll cross that sandy patch. There
he goes. Look out!"</p>

<p>At that moment the snake came to the bare sandy track, and
simultaneously there was a sharp report. The snake gave a
convulsive spring, and then lay writhing upon the sand. Will's
bullet had pierced its head, and he was praised on all sides for
his excellent marksmanship, but by none more cordially than Turon
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Chris'mas!" said that individual, "if I hadn't 'a' seed it, I
wouldn't 'a' believed it! I've heard of many a man shootin' a snake
with a bullet, but I never seed it done before. Send I may live
till I die! Clean through the head!"</p>

<p>He thereupon invited Walla Walla Will to join him at supper, and
the invitation was cordially accepted.</p>

<p>The meal being ended, pipes were lit, and they composed
themselves for a comfortable yarn.</p>

<p>They had not yarned long before two strangers approached and
introduced themselves as Tom Smart, Member of the Legislative
Assembly of New South Wales, a noted Labour champion, and Bob
Hawkson, delegate of the Lachlan Branch of the Shearers' and
Workers' Union.</p>

<p>Having asked the shearers to call the men around, both the
newcomers harangued the camp on the rights of Labour and the
tyranny of Capital until the crow seethed with sedition and were
ripe for any mischief that might be brewed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8. THE SHEARERS'
STRIKE.</h2>

<p>The morning following the meeting at the camp saw James Raymond
busily engaged in his office. He had broken the seals of several
letters, read them, and arranged them in their order of importance
ready for reply. He noted with satisfaction that the fat stock
market was firm, and that, according to the latest advices from
London, wool had an upward tendency. There was a letter from the
Pastoralists' Union stating that there were rumours of trouble with
the shearers, but he smiled at this. Some people always had trouble
with their shearers. He managed his affairs on better lines. He
treated his men liberally, and those who had shorn for him once
were always glad to come again. There were men enough at the camp
now to make a full board, and next week shearing would be in full
swing.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, you're wanted." It was old Andy who spoke,
and as he did so, he saluted in military fashion.</p>

<p>"Who is it, Andy?"</p>

<p>"It's some chaps from the camp, sir, I think," replied Andy.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am busy. Tell them to see the overseer, or the
storekeeper, if they want rations."</p>

<p>Old Andy saluted again, and turned away. The office window was
open, and James Raymond saw him shuffle along the verandah. Then he
heard voices in conversation, and among them that of Andy.</p>

<p>"He says you're to see the overseer, or the storekeeper."</p>

<p>"But we want to see <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't. He's busy."</p>

<p>"You go back, and tell him that our business is important, and
that it is with him, not with the overseer, or the
storekeeper."</p>

<p>"I won't go back," said Andy. "I've got my orders, and you've
got my message."</p>

<p>"Why, what are you afraid of?" queried the speaker. "Do you
think he will eat you? What are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"I ain't afeered of nothing," said Andy, angrily. "Who ever
knowed old Andy to be afeered? I've handled a musket, and wore the
Queen's uniform, I have. I ain't afeered of anything, or anybody.
I'm gettin' on for eighty year, but I'd tackle any man for forty
mile round, age, weight, and size."</p>

<p>The first speaker laughed, and this made old Andy still more
indignant.</p>

<p>"You can shut your 'tater trap, too," he said. "I've seed the
time when I could 'a picked the likes o' you up under my arm, and
dropped you into the nearest waterhole, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was interrupted by the voice of his master.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Andy?"</p>

<p>"It's the men from the camp," replied Andy, shuffling back, and
speaking through the open window. "I told 'em your message, and'
when they wanted me to come back to you, an' I wouldn't, they said
I was afeered. You've knowed me a good while, sir, an' your father
before you. Did you ever know me to be afeered of anything, age,
weight, and size?"</p>

<p>"No, Andy, that I didn't," replied his master. "But if these men
want to see me particularly, let them come in."</p>

<p>"There you are," snarled Andy, turning to those outside, "you
can go in, but you hear what he says, he never knew me to be
afeered."</p>

<p>The men filed into the office. There were four of them; Mr. Tom
Smart, Mr. Hawkson, Turon Jimmy, and Walla Walla Will.</p>

<p>"Good morning, men," said James Raymond, cheerfully. "Sit down.
What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Turon Jimmy looked carefully into the lining of his hat. It was
not a very clean hat. Be had used it to dust the ashes from
innumerable dampers, as a kettle holder, and as a bellows to fan
the fire into a flame when the twigs were damp. It had seen all
sorts of weathers, and it had two small holes in it, for he had
that morning thrown it into the air for Walla Walla Will to have a
shot at it. It seemed to have developed a new charm, for he was
absorbed in its examination.</p>

<p>Walla Walla Will sat near the open window in abstracted
contemplation of the flower garden outside, while Mr. Hawkson was
gazing with fixed attention at the picture of a racehorse which
hung upon the wall.</p>

<p>The abstraction of his companions threw the onus of reply upon
Mr. Tom Smart. He did not shrink from his responsibility.</p>

<p>He waved his hand gracefully, and said:</p>

<p>"Your man, sir, seemed to imagine that we wanted rations, but we
have come to talk to you of rights, not rations."</p>

<p>"What rights?" inquired James Raymond.</p>

<p>"The rights of man, sir, and the rights of labour," replied Mr.
Tom Smart. "We want to know, sir, what about the new shearing
agreement?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Mr. Raymond, "that most of you know as much
about the agreement as I do. What is wrong with it?"</p>

<p>"We want to know whether you are going to enforce it?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Raymond, "if a man signs an agreement he will
be expected to keep it. It will be time enough to talk about
enforcing it when an attempt is made to break it."</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond turned to his papers, as a hint that he had no wish
to prolong the discussion, but Mr. Tom Smart would not take the
hint.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean, although it may suit you to appear
dense," said he.</p>

<p>James Raymond looked at the speaker angrily.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he exclaimed. "What is the object of your
interview? Out with it quick. I am busy."</p>

<p>"The object of our visit," said Tom Smart, as he drummed his
fingers on the office table, "is this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will excuse me," interrupted Raymond, "but I cannot talk
nor listen while you are drumming your fingers."</p>

<p>Tom Smart thrust both hands into his pockets, and leaned back in
his chair, thus displaying to advantage the Parliamentary free
railway pass Which dangled from his watch chain.</p>

<p>"The object of our visit is this," said he. "It is to tell you
that the shearers will not accept the agreement. The only agreement
the men will accept is that adopted by the Workers' Union."</p>

<p>Taking his hand from his pocket, he fingered the gold pass on
his chain, and stared at James Raymond.</p>

<p>James Raymond, looking at Tom's hand, asked suddenly:</p>

<p>"Are you a shearer?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not," said Smart, "but I am the representative of the
Shearers' Union."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Raymond, "I cannot discuss the matter further
with you. The terms upon which my shearing is to be done is the
business of my shearers and myself. I will discuss it with no one
else."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" commenced Smart.</p>

<p>"I have nothing further to say," said Mr. Raymond.</p>

<p>"But I am speaking on behalf of the workers of Australia."</p>

<p>"I have nothing further to say to you," repeated Mr. Raymond.
Turning to Mr. Bob Hawkson, he asked, "Are you a shearer?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hawkson withdrew his eyes from the picture of the race
horse, and said, "EH?&mdash;yes. I've shorn a bit."</p>

<p>"Did you ever shear for me?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly for you," said Hawkson.</p>

<p>"What stations have you shorn at?"</p>

<p>"Well, not at any regular stations."</p>

<p>"Where, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, a bit here, and a bit there."</p>

<p>"Do you represent the Shearers' Union, too?"</p>

<p>"I am the delegate of the Lachlan Branch."</p>

<p>"Are you here looking for work?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, not exactly."</p>

<p>"Then," said Raymond, "I have nothing to say to you."</p>

<p>Turning to Turon Jimmy and Walla Walla Will, he said:</p>

<p>"I think I know you men. You were here last season, were you
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jimmy, still peering into his hat.</p>

<p>"Did you have anything to complain of?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You have signed on for this year, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Were you satisfied with the agreement when you signed?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmy, "I don't know as I had anything agin it." He
tried to push his little finger through one of the bullet holes in
his hat.</p>

<p>"What has happened since?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir, a man don't like to be called a scab and a
blackleg."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Mr. Raymond, "that you men are just the
tools of these agitators."</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, sir, I ain't no man's tool," said Jimmy,
flushing, "but you squatters have tried to make us tools long
enough. But we've joined the Union. That's straight, Mr. Raymond,
between man and man. We are going to march, and carry the banner of
victory, to&mdash;to&mdash;. Here&mdash;where are we going to carry
it to? You know!"</p>

<p>He turned to Mr. Tom Smart, who was watching the scene with a
look of amusement on his face.</p>

<p>"It appears to me&mdash;" began Mr. Smart.</p>

<p>"You will once more excuse me," interrupted Raymond, "but I have
no more to say to you!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tom Smart, rising to his feet, "but I have
this to say to you. The shearers' terms or none. Until they are
conceded, the shearers are on strike." And he strode from the room,
followed by his companions.</p>

<p>At the camp all was expectation. There was much speculation
among the men as to the probable result of the deputation. Some of
the more optimistic prophesied that Raymond would yield at once to
the eloquence of Mr. Tom Smart. Others took a more moderate view.
There was a small, wiry man from the Weddin Mountains. He knew
James Raymond, and said:</p>

<p>"He ain't the kind that caves in at once. He ain't the sort of
horse that shies at his own shadder. He may give in, but he won't
give in without a fight."</p>

<p>The man from Yass was a pessimist. He predicted trouble.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be surprised," said he, "if he set the bloomin' dogs
on 'em. He'll be ropable. He's a snorter when he starts. I've seed
him chuck his new hat down, and jump on it, just because the tar
boy wasn't quick enough for him when a man nicked a sheep. Lor'
lumme! I wouldn't take on their job for a fi'-pun-note."</p>

<p>They returned. Tom Smart as jaunty as ever, with Bob Hawkson in
deep conversation by his side; and Turon Jimmy with Walla Walla
Will, who bore the air of men who had done their duty, and borne
the brunt of battle.</p>

<p>Tom Smart explained the result of their mission, and advised
them to show a solid front. He told them that they had the workers
of Australia at their back. If James Raymond stopped supplies, he
would see that they had rations. He explained the method of
organisation, and picketing, to prevent outside labour coming in.
Above all, he exhorted them to obey the law.</p>

<p>"Don't hurt the blacklegs," he said, "if they should come this
far. We shall try to block them at the other end, but if any should
slip through, don't ill-treat them. Fetch them to the camp, and
argue with them. Argue with them until you convince them. You will
find some argument that will convince, but don't break the law. If
they send the mounted troopers, don't resist them. It is hard to
see the Myrmidons of the Law, paid out of the proceeds of your
labour, supporting the Fat Man, but that's no reason why you should
stretch wires across the road they are coming. A policeman might
get hurt, and it's wicked to hurt a policeman. Be careful of your
fires and your matches, and don't fire the grass. No matter how Mr.
Raymond insults you, or tramples on your rights, don't burn down
his new woolshed. It is true it is built out of your earnings. How
many a back has ached, or how many gallons of sweat have been shed
to build that woolshed, God alone knows! But don't burn it. The law
would call it wicked. Above all, if your temper should get the
better of your judgment, if a keen sense of wrong should raise the
devil in you, so that you cannot restrain yourself, then for God's
sake, don't get found out. I call upon all to witness that I have
earnestly advised you to obey the law."</p>

<p>Thus commenced the strike at Bindawalla. For the first few days
James Raymond was inclined to treat the whole affair as a joke. He
talked the matter over with Leslie, but neither of them took a
serious view of the situation. When, however, Monday morning came,
and the shearers did not muster to their work, James Raymond began
to get fidgety.</p>

<p>"This is damned annoying," he remarked to Leslie, on the
Wednesday. "Beautiful weather, the sheep mustered, and bone dry;
everything ready, and nothing being done. What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Leslie, "unless we send to Sydney for
men."</p>

<p>"I don't like to do that," said his father, after a pause. "I am
inclined to concede their demand as to prices, if they waive the
other absurd conditions. We are losing time, and I would sooner
give the extra half-crown per hundred than lose any more of this
fine weather."</p>

<p>"Shall I ride over to their camp and tell them so?" inquired
Leslie, who, like his father, was anxious for the shearing to
commence.</p>

<p>"I'll see after lunch," said James Raymond. Then he added "What
the devil is that?" and he pointed towards the fence that bounded
the home paddock.</p>

<p>Creeping along the fence was the figure of a man. He walked with
difficulty, as though lame. As he approached the house he gained
confidence, and discarding the crouching position, he hobbled
quickly across the intervening space, and entered the enclosure
leading to the servants' quarters.</p>

<p>"Why," said the elder Raymond, "the man's almost naked, and
bleeding, and his trousers, which seem to be all he has on, are
wet. Let us see what is the matter with him."</p>

<p>They found him in the men's hut with Andy, and upon examining
him discovered that he had been very roughly handled. James Raymond
at once called for bandages and hot water, and sent Andy to the
store for dry clothes. When he had been washed and bandaged, and
laid comfortably upon a bunk, James Raymond questioned him as to
the cause of his plight, and the man told his story.</p>

<p>"I don't know if you remember me, Mr. Raymond, but I shore here
last season. I came from Yass. I signed on for you the week before
last, in Forbes. I was satisfied with the agreement until Mr. Tom
Smart came along, and then I fell in with the crowd. But I got sick
of it, and told 'em so this morning. I told them that I left my
selection at Yass, an' my family, to come and earn a cheque, and
not to loaf away my time in camp. I offered to come up and take my
place if half-a-dozen more would come with me." He paused a moment,
and turned over with a groan. "You'll excuse me, Sir, but it's
awkward talking with two teeth loose, and your mouth all swelled
inside. Let's see. Where was I? Oh! I know. I was a-standin' near
Turon Jimmy's fire, and the first thing I knowed I was hit in the
face with a 'possum skin. I turned round to see who throwed it,
when a stick cafe whizzing from somewhere, an' hit me on the head.
That made me see sparks, an' I swore a bit. Then somebody called me
a blackleg, and just as I was answering of him, a sardine tin hit
me in the mouth. I happened to spot the fellow who threw it, an' I
went for him, but somebody tripped me up, and I fell on an old
stump, and hurt my leg. By that time there was a crowd around, all
singing out 'Blackleg! Blackleg!' and 'Scab! Scab!' One drags me
this way, and another that, me kickin' and fighting all the while.
They tore nearly every stitch of clothes off me, and dropped me in
the creek. I managed to get out, and made a bolt for it with about
forty of them yelling after me, and shotting sticks. If that's what
they call the Brotherhood of Labour, I ain't taking any."</p>

<p>He passed his hand down outside the blanket, and rubbed his
bruised and swollen leg.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond ordered Andy to make the man as comfortable as
possible, and he and Leslie went to lunch.</p>

<p>After lunch Leslie asked his father whether the was to ride to
the camp, and carry his offer to the men.</p>

<p>"No," said his father, emphatically. "Ride into Eugowra, and
wire to Sydney. Tell them to send me up fifty men at once. Then
wire to Forbes, and tell the superintendent that I must have police
protection for them. By Heavens! I will show the scoundrels who is
the master of Bindawalla."</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9. THE FIGHT.</h2>

<p>Leslie's road to Eugowra lay past the shearers' camp. As he
approached it the men were amusing themselves in a variety of ways.
Some were yarning, some playing cards, while others were lying
indolently upon the grass. Occasional bursts of laughter came from
the groups as some wag finished a funny story, but, as Leslie came
near, the laughter and the conversation became more subdued.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances Leslie would have stopped for a chat,
but now he thought it better to ride straight on and to take no
notice. One small group were sharing the contents of a billy of
tea.</p>

<p>"Have a drink, Mr. Raymond," said one of the men, holding up a
battered tin pannikin as he spoke.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Leslie, as he continued to ride on.</p>

<p>"Let the young gentleman alone," said another. "Don't you see
he's going on an errand? If he stops to talk to us the old man will
get on to him. Don't get the young chap into trouble."</p>

<p>"He ain't going on an errand," said the first speaker. "Twig the
rose in his buttonhole. He's going to see his girl. He's going down
to Old Joe's Flat."</p>

<p>Leslie pulled Bunyip up with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "I would advise you men to be civil, or
not to speak at all."</p>

<p>"Hush, Bob," said the man who had spoken second, "you mustn't
speak to him. Don't you know he's a squatter? Shearers mustn't
speak to squatters. Shearers ain't men. They're only dogs. You
mustn't speak to him."</p>

<p>"Every man is a man who acts as one," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" queried Bob fiercely.</p>

<p>"I mean," he answered, "that a man is a man, whether he be
squatter or shearer, so long as he acts a manly part. But when he
acts as a cur, he ceases to deserve the name of man."</p>

<p>"Who's been acting as a cur?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Any man who joins forty or fifty others in an attack on one, is
a cur," answered Leslie. "It is only the cur who fights a single
enemy in packs."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Bob, sarcastically, "you are alluding to the
scab."</p>

<p>"I am alluding," said Leslie, "to the man you assaulted this
morning."</p>

<p>"Well, what about him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Leslie, "except that it was a mean, cowardly
thing to do."</p>

<p>"He was a blackleg," said Bob, "and we chivvied him. Do, you
think you could have stopped us?"</p>

<p>"If I had been here," answered Leslie, "I would 'have
tried."</p>

<p>"Then," said Bob, "you would have bit off the biggest chunk you
ever tried to chew."</p>

<p>"I would have risked that," said Leslie. "It was a shameful
thing to do. If you want to fight, you might be men, and fight
fairly."</p>

<p>"Look here, young 'un," said Bob, "my name is Bob Baxter, from
the Yahoo. You may have heard of me, or you may not. That hasn't'
got the least significance to me. But anybody that accuses Bob
Baxter of unfair play is lookin' for trouble. I've fought a few
battles in my time, and was never yet given out on a foul. If
you've got any respect for your skin, go away, an' do your errand,
or see your girl, or whatever you're goin' to do. Don't be givin'
check to a better man than yourself. Get away while you're
safe."</p>

<p>"I shall get away when I choose," said Leslie, "and before I go
I say again that for forty men to ill treat one is cowardly."</p>

<p>"Mind what you're saying. Don't call me a coward," exclaimed
Bob, jumping to his feet, "or you'll be sorry. If you was off that
bloomin' horse, I'd make you swallow your words, an' if you give me
any more cheek, I'll bally well pull you off."</p>

<p>"I'll not trouble you," said Leslie, jumping off Bunyip as he
spoke. "I'll not only get off the horse, but I'll say what I think,
if you are Bob Baxter from the Yahoo."</p>

<p>"By Ghost!" said Bob, glaring at Leslie vindictively, "I've a
good mind to plug him. I s'pose there's no law agin killin' vermin
on this estate?"</p>

<p>By this time, most of the men in camp, scenting trouble, had
gathered round to listen. Leslie, however, faced the crowd without
a tremor. At this moment Turon Jimmy touched Leslie on the arm.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me, Mr. Raymond," he said. "Of course, it ain't
my business, but if you take my advice, you'll clear out. Bob
Baxter's no chicken, an' when he's roused he gets nasty. Don't rile
him, or there'll be trouble. You'd have no chance against him."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Leslie, bitterly, "seeing that h would
have the whole camp to assist him."</p>

<p>"No blinded fear," said Turon Jimmy, "nothing like that. If it
came to a fight, you or any man would get fair play. If there's a
fight in a shearers' camp, it's got to be a fair one."</p>

<p>"Did you call your morning's work fair?"</p>

<p>"That was different. It was a chivvy. It started in horse play,
although it got pretty rough, but a stand-up fight's a different
thing. The crowd would see fair play, but take my
advice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With fair play," said Leslie, "man to man, I am not afraid of
Mr. Bob Baxter."</p>

<p>"Don't let it go any further, Mr. Leslie," said Walla Walla
Will, intervening. "Bob Baxter's a pug. He's fought for money. It
wouldn't be a fair go. He knows he could eat you."</p>

<p>Leslie, burning With indignation at the memory of the fugitive,
hitched Bunyip to a sapling and threw his coat on the ground.</p>

<p>"By cripes!" said Baxter, "he's lookin' for stouche. Let him
have fair play, and get a hurdle ready to send him home on."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for you, Mr. Raymond," said Turon Jimmy, "I'll go
bail there'll be no interference, and' I'll pick you up, but for
God's sake, sing out when you've had enough, or he'll kill
you."</p>

<p>Leslie had his own opinion about that. It will be remembered
that he held the prize as the best all-round athlete in the
combined schools and, amongst his accomplishments as an athlete,
boxing was not the least. As Bob Baxter doffed his shirt, Leslie
could not but admire the splendid physique of the man. He was not
quite so tall as Leslie, but he was probably two stone heavier,
with an arm like the trunk of a young tree. As he stood waiting,
with his arms folded across his great hairy chest, and a wicked
smile on his thick lips, he appeared the embodiment of fierce brute
strength.</p>

<p>Leslie, like most young men of his class, had a thin, lean face
which, in comparison with that of his opponent, gave him an
appearance of delicacy. When, however, be rolled up the sleeves of
his silk shirt, it could be seen, that without an ounce of
superfluous flesh, the muscles of his arm were as tough and
flexible as the thong of a stockwhip. When Bob Baxter saw Leslie's
biceps he began to realise the fact that Leslie was not quite so
soft as he had anticipated.</p>

<p>"Now boys," said Turon Jimmy, "you all know Bob Baxter, and what
he has done, and you are aware that Mr. Raymond is taking on a very
foolish job. He'll probably be satisfied in the first round.
Whether we have one round or twenty, it's got to be a fair go, and
no hustling. I've given my word, and we're all agreed. Is that
so?"</p>

<p>"Hear! Hear!" repeated the crowd.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Turon Jimmy, "form a ring. Front row sit
down, so that the back row can see without pushing, and leave
plenty of room. I nominate Walla Walla Will as referee an'
timekeeper, and if there's no amendment I think we're ready."</p>

<p>The men faced each other in the ring for a few seconds while
Turon Jimmy ran to his tent for a couple of towels. Bob Baxter,
with a savage grin upon his face&mdash;which revealed an ugly gap
where he had lost a tooth in a former fight&mdash;chafed at the
delay, but Leslie waited as calmly as if he were but a spectator.
The delay, however, gave him time to mentally measure his opponent,
and perhaps it was as well so, for it prepared him to a certain
extent for Bob's tactics.</p>

<p>Bob believed in forcing matters from the start, and had won many
a fight by the suddenness of his attack. The word "Time" was no
sooner uttered by Walla Walla, Will than he made a fierce rush at
Leslie, who would have fared badly had he been taken off his guard.
By a clever piece of side-stepping he got out of the way, and Bob's
blows were wasted on the empty air. Twice Bob repeated the rush,
but the only result was a sounding blow upon his own bare ribs at
the second attempt, which left a bright red patch behind it, and
caused the Yahoo champion to pause and spar a few moments for
wind.</p>

<p>The crowd by this time began to get interested. They knew
something about boxing, and admired Leslie's cool style and the
skill and nimbleness with which he avoided the rushes of his
powerful opponent. They began to see that Leslie was not quite a
novice at the game.</p>

<p>Watching his opportunity Bob rushed again, but stopped for a
fractional part of a second as Leslie stepped aside.</p>

<p>He instantly repeated the attack, and aimed a vicious blow at
Leslie's face. Leslie parried quickly, but not quite quickly
enough, and a flow of crimson from his nose gave first blood to
Baxter.</p>

<p>Baxter's triumph was short, for Leslie immediately adopted the
tactics of his enemy, and planting his right on the old red spot on
Baxter's ribs, he landed a stinging blow with his left on Bob's
right eye. Bob stumbled and fell, and Turon Jimmy claimed first
knock down blow for Mr. Raymond.</p>

<p>The crowd were inclined to argue this point, as some said that
Bob stumbled. Walla Walla Will cut the argument short by calling
"Time," and the contest was resumed.</p>

<p>Again Bob tried to force the fighting, but with very little
success. He was Leslie's superior in strength, but Leslie was as
nimble as a cat. Several rounds were fought in this fashion. The
Yahoo champion wasted much strength and energy, and although Leslie
acted mainly on the defensive he succeeded in administering no
little punishment upon his brawny antagonist. His blows, however,
for all their apparent effect, might have fallen upon the trunk of
an ironbark tree.</p>

<p>About the eighth round Bob's strength appeared to be failing
him. His rushes were less frequent and not so fierce, and he seemed
to be glad to act on the defensive. But there was a dangerous
glitter in his eye, and those who knew him best said that he was
only biding his time, and waiting for an opening. And they
prophesied that if once he got the opening it would be all over
with Leslie.</p>

<p>At length the opening came. Bob had been backing and retreating
for some time, and Leslie had been following him, occasionally
getting his right on Baxter's ribs or his left in close proximity
to his eye; but growing tired of what seemed to be degenerating
into a walking match, Leslie dropped his arms for a moment. This
was the chance for which Bob had been waiting. Instantly his
strength and vitality seemed to return. He leapt forward and got
home a vicious blow upon Leslie's right temple which felled our
hero as a blow from a sledge hammer would fell an ox.</p>

<p>As Leslie lay, still and apparently lifeless, a mighty cheer
arose from the crowd. It had been a good fight, but the shearers to
a man were glad their champion had won.</p>

<p>In accordance with orthodox custom Walla Walla Will began to
count the seconds. "One," "Two," "Three," "Four," "Five," "Six,"
Leslie moved uneasily, "Seven," "Eight." Leslie sat up.</p>

<p>"Give him best, sir," said Turon Jimmy, "you are done. He knows
too much for you. He's as fresh as when he started. He was only
foxing."</p>

<p>"Nine," said Walla Walla Will.</p>

<p>Leslie rose to his feet, and Baxter instantly rushed again, but
once more Leslie had sufficient agility to avoid the blow.</p>

<p>"Time," said Walla Walla Will, and the men were led to their
corners.</p>

<p>"It's all over," said one of the bystanders, "the young fellow
hasn't a show, but, by Gosh! he's game."</p>

<p>When, at the expiration of a minute, "Time" was called again,
and the men faced each other, it seemed as though Bob Baxter had
only to walk in and finish it. He evidently thought so too, for he
advanced carelessly, with a smile on his swollen face, and aimed a
savage blow at Leslie's jaw.</p>

<p>But the minute's spell had cleared Leslie's brain, and had to
some extent restored his activity. As Baxter aimed his blow, Leslie
ducked quickly under the arm of the champion, and then, turning
like a flash, he dealt Baxter another deadly blow on the ribs, and
followed it up by planting his right fist with terrific force on
the side of his opponent's neck. The blow, added to the impetus of
Baxter's rush, sent the Yahoo champion crashing to the ground upon
his face, and another mad yell from the crowd rent the air.</p>

<p>Again did the referee count the seconds until he counted nine.
At the word Baxter staggered slowly to his feet. He was dazed, and
scarcely offered to defend himself.</p>

<p>Leslie waited.</p>

<p>"Now's your time, sir," said Turon Jimmy, "if you want to finish
him. If you give him time to come round he'll beat you yet."</p>

<p>"I will not take advantage of him," said Leslie. "Let him get
his wind."</p>

<p>"By Jingo!" said Jimmy, "that's generous, but it ain't tactics.
He wouldn't let you get your wind."</p>

<p>But Leslie kept on the defensive for awhile, purposely giving
his adversary time to recover. To his mind there was something
revolting in the idea of striking a defenceless man. So he waited
for Bob to renew the attack. He had not long to wait. The champion,
game as ever, but with strength and vitality greatly impaired,
rushed once more at Leslie. This time, Leslie's superior length of
reach stood him in good stead. He met the rush, but instead of
dodging it, he stopped it with a blow fair on Baxter's nose. Half
stunned by the blow, the champion struck wildly about him, but
without effect, while Leslie, cool as ever, planted blow after
blow, now on the ribs of his adversary, now on his face, and again
wherever an opening presented itself. Finally, as Bob Baxter
dropped his guard, Leslie got right home on the point of Baxter's
chin. The Yahoo champion fell in a huddled heap in the centre of
the ring. Again Walla Walla Will counted the seconds. When he had
counted ten Bob Baxter lay on the ground, a beaten man.</p>

<p>"Counted out," said Will, "and Mr. Raymond wins."</p>

<p>The announcement was received without enthusiasm. Neither was
there any demonstration of hostility. The win was an unpopular one,
but the crowd accepted the result in sullen silence. When Baxter's
scattered senses slowly returned he could scarcely believe that he
had been beaten. As he sat up and looked around him he presented a
sorry spectacle. His eyes were rapidly closing, a stream of blood
from a wound in his forehead trickled slowly down his face, while
one side of his mouth was swollen to such an extent that it gave
the face the expression of that of a snarling bull pup.</p>

<p>"Is it all over?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Will, "it was a game fight, and you was fairly
counted out."</p>

<p>"Ghost!" said Baxter, as he tried to patch up a piece of loose
skin that hung from his nose, "Ghost o' Misery! I've fought many a
man, and I've bumped agin some tough 'uns, but this is the first
time I tried to fight a bally thrashin' machine. Gimme my
shirt."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10. TO THE WOOLSHED!</h2>

<p>Leslie Raymond went to Eugowra and wired to Sydney for men, and
to Forbes for police protection for them. On his return journey he
thought that, as the day was warm and the roads were dusty, a glass
of Mrs. Sterling's cool milk would do him no harm. He threw his
bridle over the gate post and was about to enter the gate when,
from the open window of the cottage, there poured forth such a
flood of melody that, for a moment, his heart seemed to stop its
beating. He thought Ruby was in Sydney, yet it was her voice. She
was not singing "The Lass o' Gowrie," she was practising her
scales. Now commencing with a soft, low note and ascending slowly
note by note until she reached two octaves, descending again in the
same measured manner. Again, running quickly up and down the
scales, jumping from a low note to a high one, or pausing on one
note with a delightful trill. Leslie compared the sounds with those
produced by a flute, or an old violin, but neither were quite
satisfactory. He decided that the ingenuity of man had never yet
produced an instrument so sweet, or capable of such varied
intonations as a perfect human voice.</p>

<p>A long-drawn note, vibrated upon the evening air, so soft at
first that Leslie was scarcely sure he heard it, then gradually
louder and stronger, until it seemed to fill with melody the
cottage, the garden, and the surrounding paddocks; and then slowly
melting away. He did not know precisely when it ceased, but was
still listening to catch its expiring tone when he saw her standing
in the doorway, shading her eyes with her hand from the light of
the setting sun.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Raymond."</p>

<p>"Good evening, Miss Sterling."</p>

<p>Opening the gate, he walked in. He gripped her small fingers
convulsively, and for a moment held her hand in both of his own. He
only relinquished it when he saw a rosy blush suffuse her
cheeks.</p>

<p>She shyly invited him in, and took a seat in the little
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"When did you come home, Miss Sterling? I had no idea. I thought
you were in Sydney."</p>

<p>"I came home three days ago. Herr Batonstein said I must have a
holiday soon, but I anticipated the time by a few weeks."</p>

<p>"And how are you progressing with your music?"</p>

<p>"Herr Batonstein says he is satisfied, but he is very hard to
please."</p>

<p>"What! Is he unkind to you?"</p>

<p>"Herr Batonstein unkind!" and she laughed merrily. "Why, he
couldn't be unkind. He is the dearest soul and the most indulgent
man in the world! He takes me to see all the sights. No expense is
too great, and no trouble is considered by Herr Batonstein, if he
can show me something fresh, or make me happy. But when he closes
the door of the music-room, he is not the same man. He is then Herr
Batonstein, the musician, and all frivolity is left outside. He
insists on absolute correctness. Sometimes he will make me sing a
scale twenty times, until I please him. In the music-room I have to
submit, but when I come out I have my revenge."</p>

<p>"What form does your revenge take?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I pinch him. Sometimes I rumple his hair, although
that is labour thrown away, because his hair is always
rumpled."</p>

<p>"But what does Mrs. Batonstein say to this?" said Leslie. "Oh,
Mrs. Batonstein helps me. She holds him down while I tickle
him."</p>

<p>"I thought German ladies were very staid and precise?"</p>

<p>At this Ruby laughed again. The idea seemed to amuse her.</p>

<p>"Wait," said she, "until I describe Mrs. Batonstein. We will
imagine that this is their sitting-room. On one side is a piano, on
the other side an organ. There is a music stand in the corner, and
behind it two violin cases; he plays the violin as well as the
piano. In every corner of the room are piles of music. There is
music on the chiffonier, music on the piano and organ, music on the
couch, and under the couch. Music everywhere. The daily lessons are
finished, and Herr Batonstein has been unusually severe. We reach
the sitting-room as Mrs. Batonstein is removing the cosy from the
teapot. She asks how the lessons have progressed. I tell her that
he has been a tyrant. So she says that he must be punished. He
protests that it is all necessary, and for my good. The Herr begins
to dodge around the tables and chairs, and tries to bolt, but Mrs.
Batonstein guards the door. Then, perhaps, I catch him by the coat
tails, and he sinks on his knees, and begs for mercy. At that
moment, Mrs. Batonstein pinions him from behind, and the poor
Professor, helpless in her powerful grasp, lies panting on the
floor. Then Mrs. Batonstein will shout, 'Now! At him! Sure I've got
him gripped that way that he can't move a hand, barrin' his feet,
and they're under the sofy. Murdher him wid the sofy cushion, but
don't break his shpectacles. At him agin! Another one!! Poke your
finger down his back, and tickle the life out of him, and don't let
him shpake a wurrud until he's promised that if ever he gets cross
agin he'll he as sweet timpered as an angel.' That is the exact
imitation of Mrs. Batonstein. She has, to copy her own words, 'As
shweet a brogue as ever called a pig out of a bog.'"</p>

<p>"She is Irish then?" said Leslie.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "she is Irish&mdash;very. But she is a good
soul, and she makes Herr Batonstein do everything she wants him to
do, except when he is in the music room. She must not interfere
there."</p>

<p>"Then you have been moderately happy in Sydney?"</p>

<p>"Happy? I have been as happy as the day is long. Never idle.
Always doing something, or going somewhere. Studying hard five days
a week, and taking a holiday on Saturday. Saturday is our picnic
day. Then Mrs. Batonstein is in her element. She says she is never
so much at home as when she is out picnicking."</p>

<p>"Then why," inquired Leslie, "did you anticipate your
holiday?"</p>

<p>"I can scarcely tell," she replied, thoughtfully. She sat for
some moments, beating her foot against the table leg, and then,
looking at him with a smile, she added, "I suppose we must call it
instinct. It was arranged that I should come home for Christmas,
but suddenly one day last week, I felt that I must cone home at
once. I don't know why. There was no reason, but here I am, you
see. I had to promise not to sing any songs, and to practise my
scales for an hour every day. I have just finished now."</p>

<p>They talked on a variety of subjects, and Leslie could not help
noticing the improvement that a few short mouths had effected in
Ruby. She was still a child of Nature, but there was about her an
air of refined womanhood, and calm self possession he had not seen
in her before. She seemed taller and more stately. Her face was
slightly paler, but that only served to bring into more brilliant
contrast the brightness of her eyes, the roses that still bloomed
on her cheek, and the masses of wavy black hair that crowned her
head, and clustered round her forehead. The Ruby Sterling he had
known was a wild, untutored girl. This was the same Ruby Sterling,
but instead of a wild bush-bud she was developing into a cultivated
flower.</p>

<p>"And yet," he soliloquised, as be rode thoughtfully homeward,
"she is only a selector's daughter." But her bright black eyes had
sent their shafts into his very soul. His firm resolutions of the
past few months were blown away, as the thistle seed is blown
before the wind.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>In due course, a message arrived from Sydney, stating that fifty
men had been engaged, and would be dispatched by the evening train.
The next day's mail brought a letter which said that of the fifty
men only thirty-two had presented themselves at the appointed time.
A later telegram from Bathurst stated that on the arrival of the
train at that place, the men were interviewed during the wait for
refreshments, with the result that nine men had taken their swags
and left the train. The remaining twenty-three had started in the
train for Molong. From Molong came a wire to say that the train had
been met at that place by a crowd of shearers, headed by Mr. Tom
Smart; that the latter had addressed the men, and induced some of
them to join the Union. The balance had left in the coach for
Eugowra with four mounted troopers to see them clear of the
town.</p>

<p>There were two troopers stationed at Eugowra, but at present the
police from Forbes had not arrived. When the coach, with thirteen
survivors, arrived at Eugowra, James Raymond and Leslie were there
to meet it. Leslie had ridden in on Bunyip, and his father had
driven the brake, so that he could drive the men out again to the
station.</p>

<p>There was a crowd waiting to meet the coach, and its arrival was
greeted with cheers, hoots, and groans. The men alighted amid cries
of "Scab, Scab," from the crowd outside the hotel, for half the men
from the shearers' camp were there. On alighting, they were
immediately surrounded and James Raymond tried in vain to get near
them. Without any actual violence being used, the men were hustled
by the excited crowd, and pushed this way and that, until they were
hopelessly separated. Each was surrounded by half a dozen or more
excited men, who alternately threatened them, and implored them to
throw in their lot with the Union.</p>

<p>"Come out to the camp, an' be men, you wall-eyed scrapings of
the Rocks' Push," said one excited individual.</p>

<p>"Let go my swag," said the man addressed, trying to extricate
himself from the mob.</p>

<p>"Where are you shoving?" said a burly fellow with red whiskers,
as James Raymond tried to reach the man's swag. "Do you want to
commit a breach o' the peace? You keep your hands off me."</p>

<p>"Stand back there! Stand back!" The voice was a loud one, and
spoke with a tone of authority. The crowd parted and admitted the
burly form of Sergeant Blackwood who, at the head of six troopers,
had just arrived from Forbes.</p>

<p>"Stand back! Stand back!"</p>

<p>Sergeant Blackwood was closely followed by his men, and they
made a lane through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Sergeant, "all those who want to go to the
brake, this way."</p>

<p>After much hustling and pushing, seven men were got into the
brake. The rest had been "persuaded."</p>

<p>With this number, James Raymond, in a very bad humour, drove
off. He had four good horses in the brake, and as he was an
accomplished whip, he sent them along at a good pace, and they soon
left the howling mob behind.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the station the pickets there wanted to
interview the men, but the sight of the troopers who had
accompanied the party soon cleared the way, and they all landed
safely at Bindawalla.</p>

<p>The man from Yass had, by this time, recovered and so, besides
the regular station hands, James Raymond had eight men to start
shearing. In the course of a week this number was increased by four
more men. These were the survivors of eighteen who had been placed
in the train in Sydney.</p>

<p>Several attempts were made by the strikers to interview the men
on the station, but these were frustrated by the vigilance of the
two troopers who remained on the spot to keep order. The discontent
of the strikers was increased about this time by the non-arrival of
a supply of provisions which hart been promised by Tom Smart when
James Raymond stopped the issue of rations; and the firm, though
meek, refusal of Mr. Pogson to trade upon any other than a strictly
cash basis.</p>

<p>The shearing went steadily forward, each helping in some form or
other. Even Nell and the cook and the housemaid were doing what
they Could. Still, the process was slow, and by the time the
shearing should have beep finished, but a small proportion of the
sheep had been shorn.</p>

<p>The state of things at Bindawalla was but a sample of that all
over New South Wales, and Mr. Tom Smart and his co-workers,
notwithstanding liberal assistance from kindred organisations, had
considerable difficulty in supplying the various camps with
sufficient food to keep the men from hunger. But he was always full
of encouragement and sanguine prophesies of success. He told them
that large contributions were coming from Queensland and Victoria,
that the teamsters had pledged themselves not to carry wool shorn
by non-union labour, and that all scabs had been marked for future
identification.</p>

<p>The employers were wavering, and a complete victory was only a
matter of a few days or weeks. One night about five weeks after
shearing had commenced, when it ought to have been finished, and
but one-eighth of the sheep had been shorn, James Raymond paced the
verandah with impatient strides. Leslie smoked his pipe in gloomy
silence, while Nell was in the kitchen, helping the cook to set the
sponge for the morrow's baking. The stars were twinkling overhead
in a vault of blue, the perfume of roses filled the air, while away
in the men's hut old Andy's quavering voice could he heard singing
"The Soldier's Tear."</p>

<p>The air was hot and oppressive, and the croaking of the frogs in
the lagoon, added to Andy's dismal falsetto, seemed to fill the
atmosphere with vague forebodings. James Raymond was thinking of
the retarded shearing, and breathing anathema against agitators in
general and Tom Smart in particular.</p>

<p>Leslie, if the truth be told, was thinking of a pair of
sparkling eyes and a row of pearly teeth.</p>

<p>Suddenly the attention of both father and son was arrested by
the sound of horse's hoofs, in the direction of the shearers'
camp.</p>

<p>"Who can that be, galloping in the dark among the fallen
timber?" said Raymond.</p>

<p>"Probably one of the shearers," said Leslie. "He must be drunk
to travel at that speed in the dark."</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the sound of the galloping horse.</p>

<p>"Whoever he is," said Leslie, "he is coming here. I heard him
jump the brush fence. He must be drunk. I would not attempt that
myself in the stark. Hear him now! Clattering and crashing among
the dead timber in the lower paddock. Hark! He is down! No. I hear
hint coming now, faster than before."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Raymond, "but the horse now seems to be galloping
wildly, without a rider."</p>

<p>They both ran across the lawn, and along the carriage drive to
the garden gate. As they reached the gate the horse galloped across
the paddock on the other side. They only caught one glimpse of the
animal as it passed them like a phantom, but that glance was enough
for Leslie.</p>

<p>He shouted: "Good trod! Father, it is old Gaffer, Miss
Sterling's' horse, and the saddle is empty."</p>

<p>Opening the gate, he ran across the paddock in the direction of
the dead timber.</p>

<p>"Here! Wait and take a lantern," shouted his father, but Leslie
was gone.</p>

<p>"I suppose, I had bettor take a lantern," he muttered. "What the
devil does the girl mean by galloping about here in the dark like a
mad woman. But I suppose we must see to her if she is hurt. Here,
Nell! Got me a lantern, quick."</p>

<p>The track from the house led in a winding direction towards the
right, through a gate in the fence, and then, turning to the left,
it followed the gully to the shearers' camp. A straight line from
the house would not follow this track, but would lead through a
corner of the paddock, where there was a quantity of dead timber,
across the brush fence and the stony ridge on the other side, and
so, by a steep declivity, into the gully.</p>

<p>The new moon had disappeared, and the only light Leslie had to
guide him was the light of the stars. He could distinguish the
fallen limbs and branches, gleaming white in the semi-darkness like
the bleaching bones of an extinct race of mammoths. While running
between the two heaps of dead timber, he suddenly tripped and fell.
He fell on the grass, and escaped without injury, and on turning to
examine the cause of his tripping, he discovered a piece of fencing
wire stretched tightly between two trees about a foot from the
ground. Tie rightly conjectured that the wire which had tripped him
had been the cause of old Gaffer's fall.</p>

<p>He searched along the wire, and about twenty yards from where he
fell he found the senseless form of Ruby. She wore no habit, but
was dressed in white, while her hair lay in a loose mass about her
head and shoulders. She lay so still that at first he thought she
must be dead, but on stooping to raise her he was gratified to find
that she was breathing. He took her in his arms as if she were an
infant, and carried her as fast as he could towards the house. He
met his father half way, and James Raymond, grumbling, carried the
lantern, and led the way to the house. Leslie carried her straight
into the dining-room, where Nell was waiting, and they laid her on
the couch. Nell applied such remedies as she had at hand, and Ruby
soon showed signs of returning consciousness.</p>

<p>At first she stirred restlessly, then she opened her eyes, and
stared wildly about her. She seemed to recognise Nell, for she
closed her eyes again, and submitted patiently while Nell chafed
her hands and wrists, and bathed her forehead.</p>

<p>Suddenly she started to a sitting posture, and cried wildly:</p>

<p>"To the woolshed! To the woolshed! Why do you stand here? You
will he too late! To the woolshed, it is on fire!"</p>

<p>James Raymond stared incredulously.</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense," he said. "The girl's mind is wandering.
Why, it is not two hours since we left the woolshed."</p>

<p>"Oh," moaned Ruby, clasping her hands before her face and
rocking herself to and fro, "why do you stay here? I see flames.
Why do you stay?"</p>

<p>James Raymond turned to look for Leslie, but he had gone. A
moment later he heard his voice outside. He was calling to the men
in the hut, bidding them bring buckets and to follow him to the
woolshed. His father intercepted him as he was leading Bunyip from
the stable.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you are foolish," he said, "to be taking notice
of what the girl says? She is raving."</p>

<p>"Father," answered Leslie, "there is more in that girl's raving
than you or I can fathom. She may not be able to explain, but she
knows. If she says there is trouble it is not far away. Send the
men after me quickly and tell them to be careful of the wires."</p>

<p>"What wires?" said his father. But Leslie was away.</p>

<p>Raymond walked round the house and peered in the direction of
the woolshed but could see nothing, so he re-entered the
dining-room, and found that Ruby had so far recovered as to be able
to talk coherently.</p>

<p>In answer to Raymond's questions she said she was sitting on the
verandah at home, when she suddenly felt faint. Upon trying, as she
always did when she felt that sensation, to concentrate her
thoughts, she thought of the new woolshed which she had never seen.
Then of fire, with great red tongues, leaping and roaring. Without
waiting to put on her habit or her hat she had saddled Gaffer and
ridden to tell them, after telling her father to make haste to the
woolshed. She had ridden straight as the crow flies. She had forded
the creek, crossed the ironstone ridge at a gallop, and leapt the
scrub fence. She remembered crashing through the fallen timber, but
she did not mind, for Gaffer was as sure-footed as a cat, but
suddenly he seemed to double up, and he fell. She remembered no
more.</p>

<p>Raymond thought of Leslie's word, "Bid them beware of the
wire."</p>

<p>Leslie proceeded cautiously across the paddock, and when near
the dead timber he dismounted, and led his horse. As he expected,
he found the fencing wire stretched right across the angle of the
paddock. Untwisting one end from the tree, he left it lying loosely
upon the ground. He then mounted, and rode quickly to the nearest
ridge commanding a view of the woolshed. He could distinguish
nothing but the roof of the huge building looming against the sky,
but the sheep in the pens adjoining the shed were bleating, as
though they had been recently, disturbed, and he fancied that he
heard the sound of hoofs retreating over the ridge at the far side
of the creek.</p>

<p>He listened for a moment, still keeping his eyes fastened on the
woolshed, and he heard the sound of murmuring voices behind him.
The men from the house were following, as he had directed them to
do. He was on the point of calling to them to go back, when the
roof of the woolshed seemed to grow blurred and indistinct. The
clear-cut line of the ridge of the building grew crooked and
distorted, and seemed to rise up in the centre. Then he realised
that it was not the ridge, but a dense bank of smoke that was
rising from the shed, and obscuring the stars beyond.</p>

<p>He coo-ed loudly to those behind, and galloped quickly down the
hill and across the flat. When about half way he saw a red tongue
of flame dart from the corner of the building, and run dancing
along the eave. This was quickly followed by others, and before he
reached the shed the flames had burst forth in half a dozen places.
He tried to enter the building, but at each attempt was driven back
by dense volumes of smoke.</p>

<p>Upon turning one corner of the shed, he saw a man tearing away
the hurdles from the sheep pens, and on approaching cautiously he
discovered that it was George Sterling.</p>

<p>"Where are the men and the buckets?" said Sterling. "Didn't my
gal warn You?"</p>

<p>"They are coming now," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sterling, "the first thing to do is to let the
sheep out of the pens, and let them clear before they get roasted.
The men what did this job ain't got no more conscience nor a Barcoo
buckjumper. If I had a bolt on one end of a rope, an' the other was
round their necks, I'd lend a hand to pull 'em to the top o' the
highest gum tree on the flat, an' I'd leave 'em there to pizen the
crows. But this is no time for talkin', there's work to do."</p>

<p>And he went along the side of the shed from pen to pen, pulling
down the hurdles and releasing the sheep as he went.</p>

<p>When the men arrived they, were formed into a line to the creek,
and buckets of water were passed from hand to hand: But from the
first their task was hopeless. The shed was ablaze in half a dozen
places. The timber of which it was built was principally red gum
and Lachlan pine, and being as dry as tinder, seemed to welcome the
flames. In a very few minutes the men had to retire on account of
the heat, and could not get near enough to throw the water on the
fire. From end to end and from plate to ridge, the shed was a
burning mass. Men ran hither and thither shouting hoarsely to each
other, and cursing their own inability to fight the raging
element.</p>

<p>For a mile around, the landscape was illuminated. Showers of
sparks and pieces of burning wood were falling a hundred yards from
the building, for the roof, with a sudden crash, had given way. The
imprisoned flames, exulting in their release, leapt up with
malignant joy towards the smoke-laden sky.</p>

<p>"Is there anything we can do, father?" said Leslie, who, with
dishevelled hair and smoke-begrimed face, approached his
father.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we can do nothing to save the building or the
machinery," said Raymond. "It is doomed, but I was thinking we
might save some of the wool. Don't let anybody get into danger, but
save what you can. There is not a penny of insurance on any of it.
Do your best, lads. We can none of us do more."</p>

<p>"The wool is all in this end," said Leslie. "We might make an
opening. Here, boys! Five pounds to the man who will chop away that
corner post."</p>

<p>"It 'ud be dear at fifty pounds," said the man from Yass. "The
man that tried it 'ud get roasted."</p>

<p>"Could you save some of the wool if the corner post was down?"
said old Andy, who had been listening to the conversation.</p>

<p>"I think so," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"Then it's got to come," said Andy. "Gimme the axe."</p>

<p>"No," said Leslie, "you stand back. It shall never be said that
Leslie Raymond allowed an old man to do what he was afraid to try
to do himself," and seizing the axe, he ran forward in the
direction of the burning shed.</p>

<p>The fire was less fierce at this corner than anywhere else, but
still the heat was intense. The post was a thick log of red gum and
Leslie calculated that if it were chopped through, the end of the
shed would fall, and they might be able to save some of the bales
of wool that were stacked within.'</p>

<p>In spite of the smoke which was choking him, and the heat which
blistered his face and singed his hair, Leslie laboured at the post
until human nature could stand it no longer, and he had to reel,
half roasted, away.</p>

<p>As he reached the spot where the rest were standing, the axe was
snatched from his hand, and George Sterling ran towards the burning
post. He chopped away with desperate energy for a few moments,
until his shirt was ablaze, and he was forced to retreat before the
victorious flames.</p>

<p>"Darn my rags!" he said, as he staggered back to the group,
"it's blasted hot. If it's as hot as that in Hell, I don't wonder
that the rich man wanted Lazarus to bring him some water. About six
more chops would ha brought the blinded thing down. But it's worth
a man's life to do it now.</p>

<p>"Well, there's a man here whose life ain't worth much, an' he's
agoin' to do it," exclaimed Andy, seizing the axe.</p>

<p>"Come back, Andy," said James Raymond. "I will not allow it. Let
it go."</p>

<p>"As a rule I always obeys orders, sir," said Andy, as he pulled
his hat down over his scanty grey locks, "but for this once,
beggin' your pardon, sir, an' meanin' no disrespect, I'll see you
damned first. Your father saved my life once. You know how. I've
had fifty years of it since an' it belongs to the family. I ain't
afeered, an' there ain't a man within forty miles, age, weight an'
size, as durst say I am. But that there post has got to come, or
Andy's got to go."</p>

<p>His shirt sleeves were rolled up above his elbows, and through
the open breast could be seen the powerful chest thickly covered
with grey hairs. Without deigning to cover up his naked arms or
chest, old Andy strode forward to the burning building, and soon
the post was trembling beneath, his powerful blows. The flap of his
hat impeded his sight, and he threw it off. Soon his long grey hair
was alight, but still the axe rose and fell. In vain they shouted
to him to desist. He took no heed, but smote the post the harder.
Once he staggered back a yard, but rushing it again, he struck the
post With blind fury. It swayed and tottered, and as he saw it
fall, old Andy gave a wild exultant cheer. The next moment the end
of the building fell outward with a crash, and old Andy was buried
beneath the burning mass.</p>

<p>He had lived beyond the allotted span, and had never known what
sickness was. He had injured no man, feared no foe, and was hearty,
cheerful, and robust to the last. He had done his duty, faithfully
and well. His last earthly sensation was one or victory and
triumph, and in the moment of his exultation he had died. Many a
more exalted man might envy old Andy his blameless, robust life,
and his gloriously happy death.</p>

<p>They saved about sixty bales of wool and that was all. When the
sun rose it shone upon a heap of smouldering ruins and the finest
woolshed in the country was a mound' of ashes.</p>

<p>The overseer approached James Raymond and wrung his hands in
despair. "Oh, Mr. Raymond," he said, "what shall we do now,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Do, man," said Raymond, sternly, "why, build it up again. What
did you think we should do?"</p>

<p>He turned to the men who were standing in a group, and thanked
them for the efforts they had made.</p>

<p>"It is no use staying here," he said. "Go to breakfast and then
get some rest. Nothing can be done to-day. Tomorrow we will see
what we can do." Turning to the storekeeper, he added, "Let the men
have anything they want today. Anything you have in the store, and
don't charge it to them."</p>

<p>Looking round, he saw George Sterling turning away in the
direction of Old Joe's Flat. Hurrying after him he took ham by the
arm, while Sterling's face, blackened and stained with smoke and
sweat, bore a look of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Come, Sterling," said Raymond, "come with me to Bindawalla. You
can wash off the stains of the night's work up there. I want you to
come and breakfast with me."</p>

<p>And a moment later, to his intense bewilderment, Sterling found
himself walking towards the homestead, arm in arm with the Master
of Bindawalla.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11. "SHEARERS AIN'T SAINTS
BUT THEY AIN'T DEVILS."</h2>

<p>After breakfast George Sterling and Ruby went home together.</p>

<p>James Raymond had a long discussion with Leslie during the
morning. Notwithstanding his pluck, he could not conceal from
himself the fact that the situation was a serious one. The old shed
was still standing, but it was dismantled, and consisted of the
bare Walls only. A large amount of labour would be required to put
it in order, and that labour he could not get.</p>

<p>The troopers had been away at Eugowra at the time of the fire,
and had returned in time to see the smoking ruins of the woolshed.
The charred remains of Andy were lying in the men's hut, awaiting
the arrival of the Coroner and jury. His death had cast a gloom
over Bindawalla, for he had been a part of the place, and nobody
could imagine Bindawalla without Andy.</p>

<p>James Raymond was pacing his office impatiently, and Leslie was
looking out of the window. While watching, he saw, approaching the
house, no lesser person than Turon Jimmy. He was alone, and did not
seem to be in a hurry. He paused at the gate for some seconds as if
uncertain whether to enter or not. He walked along the fence and
peered over into the garden. Then he walked slowly back to the
gate, and leant on the post. He stood there some time, brushing the
flies from his face with a small branch of eucalyptus, and peering
among the shrubs in the garden. Leslie watched him for some time,
wondering what new mischief could be brewing, until he saw Jimmy
lift the latch of the gate and walk in. He then called his father's
attention to Jimmy's movements.</p>

<p>They saw him come slowly along the path until he reached the
fountain. Here he made another long pause, and at one time he
seemed on the point of retiring. He pulled off his hat and looked
carefully at the inside and the outside. He seemed to be communing
with it, and suddenly the conclusion seemed to have been
discovered. He held it up by the rim, and spat into its crown an
enormous quid of tobacco, and then, planting the hat firmly on his
head, he squared his broad shoulders, stroked his red beard, spat
in a determined manner into the basin of the fountain and, striding
straight up to the door of the house, he rapped loudly with his
knuckles.</p>

<p>Leslie went to the door, and demanded his business.</p>

<p>"I want to see Mr. Raymond," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>Leslie was about to reply, but was forestalled by his father,
who called to him and ordered him to "Bring the vagabond in," that
he might hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>On being ushered into James Raymond's presence, Turon Jimmy took
his hat off, and picking up the huge hunk of tobacco that fell from
its crown, he wiped it carefully upon the seat of his pants, and
stowed it away in his pocket. He carefully examined the inside of
his hat, straightened it out, and examined the outside; then,
holding it by the rim and turning it slowly round and round, he
made a minute examination of the tattered ribbon that surrounded
its edge.</p>

<p>James Raymond, who had flung himself into his office chair,
watched the man in silence, while Leslie stood with his hands
behind him, leaning against the chimney shelf.</p>

<p>At length, finding the silence irksome, Jimmy, still inspecting
the ribbon on his hat, cleared his throat, and said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Raymond."</p>

<p>"What is your business?" said Raymond, shortly, not deigning to
reply to Jimmy's salutation. "Out with it!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Jimmy, "I've been appointed a
depredation."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Raymond. "Have there not been
depredations enough? Perhaps you mean that you have come to give
yourself up to justice. Did you set fire to the woolshed?"</p>

<p>"Struth!" said Jimmy, throwing his hat violently on the floor.
"If I didn't say so! I said this mornin', I says, the boss is bound
to think it's one of us chaps as did it."</p>

<p>"What else could anybody think?" said Raymond. "Nobody but one
of you strikers would do it!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Raymond," responded Jimmy, looking Raymond straight
in the face, "if it was the last word I had to say on my dyin' bed,
I'd say that it was the biggest bloomin' error that you ever made
in your life to think so. Shearers ain't saints, Mr. Raymond, but
they ain't devils, nor snakes, and whoever set fire to your
woolshed is both. But, as I was sayin', I've been appointed a
depredation. We drew sticks for it. I pulled the longest stick, and
here I am."</p>

<p>He picked up his hat, and resumed his inspection of the
ribbon.</p>

<p>"You mean, I presume," said Leslie, "that you are a
deputation."</p>

<p>"You can call it that if you like," said Jimmy, doggedly.
"Anyhow, here I am."</p>

<p>"And being here," said Raymond, "perhaps yon will tell us what
you want."</p>

<p>"We don't want nothin', Mr. Raymond," replied Jimmy. "I wasn't
sent to ask you for anything. But this mornin', when we heard that
the woolshed was burnt, we had a meetin' at the camp, and we knowed
that we'd prob'ly get blamed for puttin' of a fire-stick in it.
There was two men missin' as was in the camp yesterday, but nobody
knowed where they come from, or who they was, or where they are
gone. We 'don't know 'em, and we don't want to know 'em. Blast 'em!
I hope they'll break their blinded necks before they've gone ten
mile, but we don't know 'em, Mr. Raymond, and we don't want to know
'em. Shearers ain't saints, but they ain't informers. But we felt,
sir, that as men we had been disgraced, and every man in the camp
solemnly and severally cursed the scalliwags that had disgraced us.
So we one and all decided that somethin' must be done to show you
that we ain't got no sympathy with arsonists, and scum that fight
with fire-sticks, and hit below the belt, and we appointed a
depitation&mdash;if that's what you call it&mdash;to see you, and
tell you that there's seventy-five men down at the camp awaitin'
your orders, and Mr. Tom Smart may go to Hell. That's my message,
Mr. Raymond," and he pulled a hunk of tobacco from his pocket and
stuck it in his cheek.</p>

<p>"But I do not understand," said Raymond, "what about terms?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't told to say anythin' about terms," said Jimmy, "It
seems to me, sir, that the men in the camp knowed no more about
settin' fire to the woolshed than they did about the men that lived
when Adam was a boy, but they feel that somehow they'll get the
blame, and they want to do somethin' to show they're sorry. Runnin'
away wouldn't do it; barneyin' about terms wouldn't do it; passin'
round the hat was no good, and so they thought that the only thing
that would fit the case was for me to come and tell you that
there's seventy-five men awaitin' your orders, all ready and
willin', and that Tom Smart can go to Hell."</p>

<p>Jimmy planted his hat firmly on his head, and rose to his feet,
as though to signify that his mission was at an end.</p>

<p>"If they are willing to work&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell, you they are willin', sir. Shearers ain't saints, but
they ain't devils."</p>

<p>"If they are willing to work," continued Raymond, "they can
come. I am inclined to believe you about the fire. Tell all those
who are willing to work to come up to the station to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Right oh!" said Jimmy, "there'll be seventy-five of us here
soon after sunrise, all ready and willin'."</p>

<p>Later in the day Mr. Pogson arrived in his capacity of coroner,
to hold an inquest. After taking all the available evidence, he
recorded the verdict that the fire was the wilful act of some
person or persons unknown.</p>

<p>With regard to the death of Andy, seeing that Andy was not on
the building when the fire occurred, a verdict was returned of
accidental death. Mr. Pogson signed an order for burial, and then,
in his capacity of undertaker, he proceeded to measure Andy for his
coffin, which he promised to send out the next morning. These
details being attended to, Mr. Pogson interviewed Mr. Raymond in
his office, and offered, in his capacity of financier, to provide
Mr. Raymond with any assistance he might require to enable him to
re-erect the woolshed. In reply to this offer, Mr. Raymond said
that he must think the matter over, but would probably see him in a
day or two; after which, Mr. Pogson mounted his horse and returned
to Eugowra.</p>

<p>Turon Jimmy was as good as his word, and the next morning the
men from the camp presented themselves in a body at the station.
The news of the burning of the woolshed created wide-spread
indignation, and very soon James Raymond had as much labour as he
could profitably employ, and the shearing went on, though under
difficulties.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Christmas came and went, and the time approached for Ruby to
return to Sydney to resume her studies.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking slowly, and had got so low that it threw its
slanting beams right under the willows and on to Ruby, as she swung
idly upon her perch on the swinging branch of the tree. She was
thinking that she was probably swinging upon the favourite perch of
her girlhood for the last time. To-morrow she was to return to
Sydney, to Herr Batonstein, and her lessons, and to the preparation
for that career which might lead her&mdash;where? Who could tell.
Suddenly, in the midst of her reverie she became conscious that
somebody was observing her. Turning quickly, she saw Leslie Raymond
standing a few paces off. He had tied Bunyip outside the fence, and
advanced noiselessly on the soft turf. He came forward, holding out
his hand, as she turned.</p>

<p>"Good evening," he said. "Did I awake you from your dream?"</p>

<p>"I was not asleep," she said. "Do you think it is possible for
one to dream awake?"</p>

<p>"That depends," said Leslie, "on what we call a dream. I think
if our fancies run loose and lead us where they will, that we
might, whether waking or sleeping, call that a dream. If that is
so, and I think it is, I often have waking dreams." And he still
retained the hand that he had taken.</p>

<p>"Will you come up to the house?" said Ruby, after an
embarrassing pause.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Leslie, "presently. I hear that you are going away
again to-morrow, and I have come to say&mdash;good-bye." He felt
her hand tremble slightly as he said the word, "but first," he
added, "I have something to say to you. Something that I must say,
and which must be said to you alone. Can you guess what it is?"</p>

<p>Her heart said yes, but she shook her head in reply.</p>

<p>"My tale," said Leslie, "is a simple one. One that has been very
often told. I could have told it many months ago, but did not dare.
I don't think I should dare now, but you are leaving to-morrow, and
the opportunity may not occur again for a long time. Ruby, the tale
I have to tell is so short that it can be told in three words. It
is&mdash;I love you."</p>

<p>Ruby stood, looking at the gnarled roots of the willow upon
which her foot rested. Her bosom heaved quickly, and her face grew
pale, but she answered never a word.</p>

<p>"Have you no word to say?" he asked. "I have loved you from the
moment I saw you in the gully, when you were bringing home the
cows, but my love has been growing stronger every day. I have
battled with it, but in vain. I feel that without you life would be
indeed a blank. Ruby, my love, give me leave to hope."</p>

<p>"Mr. Raymond," said Ruby, still keeping her eyes on the twisted
root, "I thank you sincerely for the honour you do me, but it
cannot be."</p>

<p>"Do you doubt my sincerity?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Raymond," she said, "I believe every word you say, but
it cannot be."</p>

<p>"I thought you cared for me," said Leslie, "but I suppose the
wish was father to the thought."</p>

<p>"It is not that," said she.</p>

<p>"Then," he exclaimed, catching at a straw, "you do care."</p>

<p>"Mr. Raymond," she replied, "I am sorry. I wish you had not
spoken. Say no more. There are reasons."</p>

<p>"What reasons?"</p>

<p>"Reasons which it were best not to tell."</p>

<p>"Tell me one of them."</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and then, still looking at the root, she
said:</p>

<p>"One great reason is the difference in our social
positions."</p>

<p>"But surely," said he, "that is not a sufficient reason to part
two lives that were meant to be spent in unison. If I am willing to
make the&mdash;eh&mdash;to ignore the difference surely that should
be sufficient."</p>

<p>"No," said Ruby, now looking him squarely in the face, "it is
not sufficient. I know what you were going to say, and it was the
better word. You were about to say that if you were willing to make
the sacrifice, why should I object. I do not doubt your sincerity,
and I appreciate your readiness to make the sacrifice, but for your
sake and my own, I refuse to accept it."</p>

<p>"Ruby," he exclaimed, "you are wrong. It would be no sacrifice,
to me. I should esteem your love the greatest triumph of my
life."</p>

<p>She shook be head.</p>

<p>"Mr. Raymond," she said, "you are the son of a squatter and the
future owner of Bindawalla; I, the daughter of a selector. The
world would say that you had loved beneath your station."</p>

<p>"I should only prove to the world the sincerity of my love."</p>

<p>"That I do not doubt," said Ruby, "but if I am only the daughter
of a selector I am proud. I know that deep down in your heart you
think you are conferring an honour upon me by the offer of your
hand. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>Leslie did not reply.</p>

<p>"I knew it," she continued, "I knew it. So you would be
conferring an honour. But, as I said, I am proud. When I give my
love to a man, if such a thing should ever be, it will have to be
upon terms of perfect equality. Neither he nor the world shall say
or think that he is conferring an honour upon me, except that its
always an honour to be loved by a good and true man. That honour
you have conferred upon me to-day, and I am proud of it, but it
shall never he said by the world or by her husband that Ruby
Sterling married for money, or social position or for anything but
pure, unselfish love."</p>

<p>"Ruby," said Leslie, "you, are cruel. You do not know what your
answer means to me. Life without hope."</p>

<p>"Please don't," she said, "I have no wish to be cruel. Some day
you will know that my idea is right. One word more, and it must be
the last on this subject. Believe me, that wherever I may go I
shall remember your words with the deepest gratitude. I shall
always pray for your welfare. I can say no more. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Clasping her hands tightly, she drooped her head, and Leslie,
thought he saw a tear glistening in her eye.</p>

<p>"Is your answer irrevocable?" said he.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then," said he, "good-bye."</p>

<p>And then he did what he probably ought not to have done. He
slipped his arm round her waist, and lifting her drooping head, he
imprinted upon her lips one long, passionate kiss.</p>

<p>For one ecstatic moment&mdash;no more&mdash;she rested in his
arms, then, blushing scarlet, she motioned him imperiously
away.</p>

<p>"If it must be so," said he, "good-bye. May Heaven guide your
footsteps, and help me to face my dreary life."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she answered. "May God bless and prosper you."</p>

<p>He mounted Bunyip, and digging the spurs into the startled
brute, he dashed madly across the paddock.</p>

<p>She watched him until he disappeared over the crest of the
ridge, and then, falling against the twisted trunk of the willow,
she buried her face in her hands and sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh! God," she cried, "what have I done!" Then, as the fountain
of her tears ran dry, she said, "I have done right. It is better
so. It is better so."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12. HERR BATONSTEIN
REVEALS A SECRET.</h2>

<p>Herr Batonstein was a musician from his toes to the tips of his
flaxen hair. Music was his life and his hobby. No man was more fond
of it, and few were better qualified to teach. From the first
moment he had heard Ruby's voice, he had recognised its
potentiality. It had long been the object of his life to train and
introduce to the world a great singer, one whose name should be
handed down to posterity as the greatest of her time, and with whom
his name would be indelibly associated. In Ruby he saw the possible
realisation of his dreams, and he resolved to spare no effort and
no expense which could assist to make her triumph, and his,
complete. It is but bare justice to him to state that with him Art
was first, pecuniary considerations practically nowhere.</p>

<p>In Ruby he had found a fit subject for his Art. She had not only
the natural ability to profit by his teaching, but an ambition
scarcely second to his own, which made her capable of making any
sacrifice to bring about its ultimate triumph. With a teacher so
capable and earnest, and a pupil so apt and willing, it is small
wonder that the lessons made great progress, and it perhaps needed
the restraining influence of Mrs. Batonstein to prevent Ruby's
health suffering from the strain. As a matter of fact, Mrs.
Batonstein was as anxious as her husband to bring about Ruby's
ultimate triumph, but she knew her husband, and she knew Ruby; and
she felt that unless she interfered occasionally, that both master
and pupil would be likely to become too engrossed in their
all-absorbing object.</p>

<p>She therefore insisted on an occasional romp, or a run out into
the suburbs, and always, when the weather allowed it, on the weekly
picnic.</p>

<p>So time went on, each day seeing some marked progress. Ruby had
already had a few months' teaching before her holiday, and
progressed so successfully after it that by the time the autumn
waned and the cool winter weather came, she could read almost any
music at sight, and could make herself understood in either French
or Italian. Her deportment had so far improved that all the old
awkwardness had disappeared, and her every movement was grace
itself.</p>

<p>By this time a whisper was heard in the musical world of Sydney
that Herr Batonstein had a wonderfully promising pupil. But Herr
Batonstein said little. When closely questioned upon the subject,
he would rub his hands and smile in the style of a man who was
perfectly satisfied with himself, and say, "You wait a little
longer, just a few months, and then&mdash;you shall see what you
shall see!"</p>

<p>It was quite in accordance with the rules of the professor's
household that, the lessons for the day being finished, Mrs.
Batonstein should be sitting in a cosily-padded chair, sipping a
delicious cup of afternoon tea, that Ruby should be nestled up in
the corner of a large, old-fashioned settee following her example,
and that the Herr himself should be defying all the laws of
propriety by puffing away at a big meerschaum pipe in the
drawing-room, and in the presence of the ladies.</p>

<p>He puffed for some time in silence, beaming benignantly through
his spectacles, but at length he spoke.</p>

<p>"I haf a leetle surprise I am going to give you. Guess me vot it
vas."</p>

<p>"Faith," said Mrs. Batonstein, as she replaced her cup and
saucer on the tray, "I have no notion at all, so I haven't, unless
ye've been buyin' another dog, but ye needn't be bringing any more
dogs home here. I'Il not have them. You know the last dog you
bought from a man in William Sthreet. He tould ye it was a pure
bred something or other that he'd bred himself, and gave ye his
pedigree, and the next day ye were nearly being arrested, so ye
was, for being seen wid a dog in your possession that had been
stolen the day before ye bought it, to say nothing of it biting the
milk boy, and costing ye a half-sovereign to compensate him. I'll
have no more dogs about the house."</p>

<p>"No," replied her husband, "it vas not a dog this time. It vas
something much better, much more important, something that will
make some people sit up."</p>

<p>"Well, ye'll never make me sit up again," said his wife. "I
remember the last time I set up for ye. If it was one o'clock that
night it was half past two in the mornin' when ye came flounderin'
in, thryin' to sing 'He's a jolly good fellow.'"</p>

<p>"Now you know, my dear, it vas not so bad as that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it was, and worse. Don't I remember how ye threw your
muddy boots into the four corners of the room, and wanted me to
salute you, because they'd been makin' ye Grand Primo among the
Rhinoceroses or something."</p>

<p>"The Buffaloes, my dear, The antediluvian Order of Buffaloes.
They made me Grand Primo, and I was called Sir Batonstein."</p>

<p>"Sir Fiddlestick!" said Mrs. Batonstein, scornfully. "But
whativer it was, ye'll not catch me sittin' up again for ye."</p>

<p>"Ach! It was not that sitting up at all. I mean the public, and
the critics, and the whole of the musical world. I vill make them
all sit up. I have promised to conduct a grand concert at the Town
Hall for the Philharmonic Society. The Governor is to be there, and
the Ministers, and the Mayor, and I am to conduct, and they vill
all sit up. My word! Can you guess my surprise now?"</p>

<p>"Ah, ye shly divel," said Mrs. Batonstein, beaming with
pleasure, "ye are goin' to let Ruby sing?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Batonstein, rubbing his hands, "I am going to let
Ruby sing. I am going to let them hear the sweetest voice that ever
thrilled through that hall. They shall hear the Australian
Nightingale, and my word! they will all sit up, I tell you. The
Governor will sit up, the Mayor will sit up, and they will all sit
up."</p>

<p>"And are you sure, my dear," said his wife to Ruby, as she
embraced her tenderly, "are you sure you will not be nervous?"</p>

<p>Ruby smiled. "No," she said, "I shall not be nervous now. I have
such faith in my dear old teacher that, if he says I can do it, I
feel sure I can. He knows my power better than I do. He will not
set me an impossible task, and I will not disgrace him."</p>

<p>"That vas spoken like Ruby," said Herr Batonstein.</p>

<p>"She will not be nervous. She knows her power, too. I will
myself accompany her, and she will be triumphant. She knows now all
I can teach her, and it is time she was heard." Turning
affectionately to Ruby, he asked, "Why did not you guess what my
surprise was to be?"</p>

<p>"I had no need to guess," said she, quietly, "I knew it."</p>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Something told me."</p>

<p>"Sure, ye are a sthrange child," said Mrs. Batonstein.
"Somethin' tould ye. There do be always somethin' shpakin' to ye,
and tellin' ye things."</p>

<p>"No," replied Ruby, smiling. "It does not speak to me. It tells
me without speaking."</p>

<p>Soon after this conversation Ruby hurried off home to convey the
news to her Aunt and Uncle, and to write to her father.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13. RUBY MEETS MR.
POGSON.</h2>

<p>Ruby swept gracefully along the path which led across Moore Park
to her Uncle's house. Her rich colour was intensified by the bright
hopes that filled her mind. She was about to prove to the world
that her teaching had not been in vain. She would prove that she,
Ruby Sterling, a mere selector's daughter, could do what the
Maxwells, the Thorntons, and the rest of their set could never do.
She would command the applause and rouse the enthusiastic
approbation of the best and greatest people in the land.</p>

<p>She would do more, she would force homage from the most exalted,
and cause a responsive chord to vibrate in the hearts of the most
humble.</p>

<p>She had reached the comparatively deserted region at the back of
the Zoological Gardens. There were very few people in this part of
the Park, two or three nurse-maids, a group of romping children,
with here and there a man sitting upon a seat. These were all.</p>

<p>Ruby walked rapidly, too engrossed in her own thoughts to take
much heed of her surroundings, and had just passed one of the seats
when she was surprised to hear her own name pronounced.</p>

<p>"Miss Sterling! It has been truly said 'Wonderful are the
dispensations of Providence.' Little did I think&mdash;little did I
dream, when leaving the noisy town and all its bustling activity, I
sought a little relaxation and quiet meditation in the comparative
seclusion of the Park, that I should be rewarded by meeting you.
Sydney owes a deep and lasting obligation to Old Joe's Flat,
inasmuch as it has pleased Providence in its Divine Wisdom to
remove from Old Joe's Flat its peerless ornament, and to make
Sydney the richer by the exchange."</p>

<p>"Why, I declare," said Ruby, who was excited and pleased at the
appearance of anything reminding her of her home, "if it isn't Mr.
Pogson! How do you do, Mr. Pogson," she asked, extending her
hand.</p>

<p>"I am not enjoying that robust health that I could desire,"
observed Mr. Pogson. "I don't know how it is, but there is
something in the atmosphere of the metropolis, or in the food of
the metropolis, that acts prejudicially upon my liver; and ever
since I have been in town I have been suffering from an acute
attack of bile. Did you ever suffer from bile, my dear?"</p>

<p>Ruby said she had never experienced that sensation.</p>

<p>"Then you are fortunate, my dear, for it is one of the most
distressing ailments that poor frail humanity is heir to."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson sat bolt upright upon his seat, with his hands
resting upon the handle of the umbrella between his knees, and
gazed at Ruby with a smile of intense admiration. Then, seeming to
remember his bile, or something, he stiffened himself still more,
and for a second or two he frowned at her fiercely. He passed his
hand in a dazed manner across his face, and the action seemed to
brush away the frown, for his features again relaxed into a smile,
and he begged her to be seated.</p>

<p>Ruby sat down, as requested, by his side, and began to enquire
eagerly after the folks at Old Joe's Flat. She thought that Mr.
Pogson's voice sounded rather thick&mdash;but she attributed it to
the biliousness&mdash;as he told her that at the latest period he
had had the opportunity of observing, the inhabitants of Old Joe's
Flat were in a perfect state of health, while Old Joe's Flat itself
occupied its usual geographical position.</p>

<p>"And the folks at Bindawalla?" said Ruby.</p>

<p>"The folks at Bindawalla," replied Pogson, speaking with some
asperity, "are much the same as usual. Mr. Raymond is busy
supervising the re-erection of his woolshed, and has it nearly
completed. He is as stuck-up as ever, and is as proud of his new
woolshed as if, as if&mdash;it belonged to him." Once again be
regarded Ruby with a severe frown.</p>

<p>"I thought it did belong to him," said Ruby, in some
surprise.</p>

<p>"Ostensibly it does, my dear, but only ostensibly. If I chose to
speak, and to betray business confidences, my dear, I could tell
you who is the real owner of the woolshed, and perhaps he would not
be far away from us; but in business there are ramifications and
intricacies which the female intellect is incapable of fathoming.
There are also transactions which, in accordance with business
precepts, must he kept secret and inviolable. Locked, as it were,
in the sacred repository of the human heart."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson, waving his right hand, brought it down with a smart
thud, upon his shirt front.</p>

<p>"And how is Miss Nell?" said Ruby.</p>

<p>"I do not, as a rule, see much of her," returned Pogson, "but I
am in a position to say that she is as haughty as ever, and as
inconsistent. She passes my store at Eugowra, and drives thirty
miles to Forbes, or even sends to Sydney for her draperies, her
millinery, her shoes, and household requisites, bestowing her
patronage upon strangers, ignoring local commercial enterprise, and
passing me by. Me! The benefactor of her family in their time of
need. I am flouted, Miss Sterling, but I am not the man to reveal
business secrets, and betray business confidences, even if I am
flouted. Then, there is Mr. Leslie."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Pogson paused, while Ruby tapped her little shoe
impatiently upon the ground. After unsuccessful search in several
of his pockets, Mr. Pogson found a faded silk handkerchief, and
blew his nose.</p>

<p>With the handkerchief he also drew from his pocket a crumpled
piece of paper, which fell on the seat between Ruby and himself.
This he hastily replaced, but not before Ruby's quick eyes had
discovered that it was a music hall programme.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Pogson," said she, "do you go to music halls?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson sat, blinking his eyes at her for some moments in
silence, as though in doubt, then his face assumed an expression of
injured innocence.</p>

<p>"Sydney is a wicked place," he said, "and full of evil-doers.
Last night, as I was returning from a meeting of the Social Purity
Society, while in deep and earnest cogitation on the influence of
example, some evil disposed person or persons unknown must have
placed that paper in my pocket. Miss Sterling, as a member of the
Executive of the Social Purity Society, how could I go to a music
halls. But, as I was saying&mdash;by-the-by&mdash;what was I
saying?"</p>

<p>Ruby, who was digging holes in the ground with the end of her
parasol, said, without looking up, "I think&mdash;it was
something&mdash;about Mr. Leslie Raymond."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Leslie Raymond, so it was. Well, as you may have
noticed, Leslie Raymond always had a style with him that might be
appropriately described as short. In fact, the designation might be
more correct if I were to stigmatise his style as snappy. Well, he
is not improving. Ever since the burning of the woolshed he has
been snappier than ever. He is a conceited puppy, and if I
endeavour to extend to him those slight but pleasant amenities
which are the very salt or essence of our social life, if I give
utterance to those usual meteorological platitudes which are
vulgarly known as passing the time of day, he even snaps at me. Me,
Miss Sterling, who, as it were, holds his destiny in the hollow of
my hand. Some day, perhaps, I will take the snappiness out of him.
The sole cause of my presence in the metropolis at the present time
is the necessity of personally supervising certain financial
transactions, which I am not at liberty to divulge. For this, I am
exposed to attacks of bile. For this I endure the malevolent
machinations of evil-disposed persons, anal my reward
is&mdash;snappiness. But I will never reveal private financial
transactions. I am meek, Miss Sterling, and humble, and
long-suffering. So long as the cheque for interest is paid promptly
every quarter, and the cheques are duly honoured, so long will I
refrain from putting down my foot. But should the necessity arise,
I shall immediately renounce the lamb, and assume the lion. Then
what will become of pride? Where will haughtiness be then, and of
what avail will be snappiosity? They will be gone, gone,
like&mdash;like last season's butter."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson sighed mournfully, shook his head sadly, and groaned
audibly as be pondered on the sin and wickedness of worldly-minded
people. Then, once more glancing at Ruby, he smiled, and drew
closer to her on the seat, saying:</p>

<p>"But why talk of pride and snappiness in the presence of youth
and beauty? Why should we detract from the pleasure of this
delightful meeting, by talking about people and things that are
commonplace and unpleasant? Miss Sterling, you are a charming
girl."</p>

<p>With a look that was intended to be very captivating, he drew
still closer, and endeavoured to put his arm around her waist.
Ruby, however, avoided his attempted familiarity, thanked him for
his information, and said she must be getting home.</p>

<p>"Why this eagerness to be gone?" he said. "Why not stay a
little? Let us talk of Old Joe's Flat. Let us talk of anything, so
that you stay." Seizing her hand in both of his, he added: "Stay
awhile, adorable one. Let us recall memories of the past. Do you
remember how your father used to carry you in his arms into my
store, and sit you on the counter while I fitted the new shoes on
your pretty little feet? Have you forgotten how I used to kiss you,
and give you lollies? I said you would grow up a fine woman, and
you have verified my prognostication. You are a fine woman. I have
always admired you, and now I admire you more than ever. You are
adorable!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Pogson," said Ruby, "let my hand go. You will make me
angry."</p>

<p>"I cannot let you go thus, sweet one," replied Mr. Pogson
ardently. "At least, give me a kiss before you go. Just one, and
promise to meet me again."</p>

<p>Ruby's face flushed, and her eyes blazed angrily.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she Said, rising to her feet, and striving to
release her hand, which he still grasped. "Let me go at once. What
would Mrs. Pogson say if she heard you?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pogson be&mdash;sugared," said he; "she is safe in
Eugowra. What does Shakespeare say: 'She that is robbed, not
knowing what is stolen, let her not want it, and she's not robbed
at all.'"</p>

<p>"Your Shakespearean quotation," said Ruby, "is about as reliable
as your sense of moral rectitude. Mr. Pogson, I firmly believe that
you are drunk."</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Pogson, "me drunk? How could it be possible
for me to be drunk? Me, the President of the Eugowra Temperance
Society, the W.C.T. of the I.O.G.Ts., and a Worthy Patriarch of the
S.O.Ts. 'Look not upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth its
colour to the cup, when it moveth itself aright, for at the last,
it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.' No, my dear,
'Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging, and 'whosoever is
deceived thereby is not wise.' How could you suppose that I could
be drunk?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Ruby, "you look like it, you act like it, and you
<i>smell</i> like it."</p>

<p>"That, my dear, is simply the medicine which I have to take for
the bile. But everybody knows that Erasmus Pogson is a teetotaller,
though, thank the Lord, he is not a bigoted one. But do not
struggle so, and do not leave me. See yonder tram, it is going to
Coogee. Let us go to Coogee, and sit on the rocks in the gloaming.
Let us there blend our souls in sweet communion. Let us watch the
silvery moon as it rises over the broad expanse of the Pacific. Let
us&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Ruby would hear no more. She wrenched her hand free, and
turned to go. He rose as if to follow, but Ruby, whose temper was
now thoroughly roused, struck him in the breast with her clenched
hand, and knocked him forcibly back into his seat.</p>

<p>"How dare you!" she exclaimed, stamping her foot angrily, "how
dare you insult me!" She drew her supple figure to its full height,
and clenched her gloved hands with an air of grim determination.
"Attempt to follow me and I will knock you down. You mean,
contemptible hypocrite. You parody of an honourable man. You dare,
to talk disparagingly of those whose shoe-strings you are not fit
to tie! You, whose whole life is a swindle, a lie, and, a cheat;
you slander and vilify those whose integrity and honour you have
not the moral sense to recognise. You mean, crawling reptile! Dare
to speak another word, or to follow me, and I will kill you as I
would a centipede."</p>

<p>As she turned and swept disdainfully away, she looked as though
she was quite capable of putting her threat into execution. Pogson
gazed after her until she disappeared through the wicket gate in
the park fence.</p>

<p>His face wore a sickly smile so long as Ruby was in sight, but
when she had disappeared, it changed to a frown. He straightened
his necktie, pulled out the corners of his collar to their fullest
extent, and, sitting very stiff, and upright as a Christian
gentleman ought to sit, he leant his two hands upon the umbrella
and gazed solemnly at the setting sun.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he soliloquised, "what an unsolved connundrum is woman!
She is, as the poet stays, here to-day and gone to-morrow, and
three parts of the time you don't know whether she is here or
there, or whether it is to-day with her or to-morrow. She reminds
me of the little pea that the man on the racecourse was showing me.
Let me see. What was it he said? Oh, I know! He said 'now you see
it, and now you don't,' and he was right. I was the victim of
misplaced confidence, and came away five shillings poorer. And that
was old Sterling's little Ruby. I used to fit her boots on for her,
and now she called me a centipede, and threatened to kill me.
Contrariosity, thy name is woman. What did the poet say? Let me
see:</p>

<p>"'Oh! Woman, in our hours of ease,<br>
Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,<br>
I often wonder what you are,<br>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.'</p>

<p>"Fancy; Erasmus Pogson being killed like a centipede. Ugh!" He
looked carefully around him in every direction, and then he drew
from his breast pocket a little flask. Unscrewing the top he put it
to his lips and elevated it gradually until it assumed a
perpendicular position. He then wiped his lips, replaced the flask
in his pocket, pulled his hat down to shade his eyes, and sitting
bolt upright he gazed with an air of defiance at the setting
sun.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14. THE PHILHARMONIC
CONCERT.</h2>

<p>The rumoured appearance of the Professor's favourite pupil
aroused considerable interest in musical circles. Almost every day,
if the weather was fine, Herr Batonstein would don his best frock
coat and, with a fresh bunch of flowers in his buttonhole, he would
saunter round the Block. In reply to the questioning of friends, he
refused to be pumped, but said:</p>

<p>"Wait for the concert; then you will see what you will see."</p>

<p>But the answer was always given with such a confident toss of
the head, that public curiosity was whetted.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a momentous question arose: "What was Ruby to
wear?"</p>

<p>That became the all engrossing question. One thing only was
settled quickly. Herr Batonstein was to pay for it. That he had
insisted on from the first. There was to be no cheeseparing
economy; Ruby was to be clothed as the importance of the occasion
demanded. Herr Batonstein's ideas of the intricacies of female
costume were somewhat vague, but there was one point upon which he
was very insistent. It must be an artistic dress. Nothing
commonplace or vulgar.</p>

<p>After a good deal of discussion it was agreed to commission a
first-class dressmaker to produce a confection worthy of the
occasion.</p>

<p>On the night of the concert the Town Hall was packed with a
fashionably dressed audience. The Governor, with the Vice Regal
party, arrived punctually at eight o'clock.</p>

<p>As they entered the hall the vast audience rose, while the
choir, accompanied by the orchestra, sang a verse of the National
Anthem. Then Herr Batonstein, who was already in his place, waved
his baton, and the concert commenced.</p>

<p>The overture was smartly played, and the cantata a complete
success. Herr Batonstein was recalled, and bowed his
acknowledgments. Then, after a short interval, came the second
part.</p>

<p>The orchestra played the overture to Rigoletto, a tenor sang a
song, a violinist played an arrangement of Spanish dances, and
then, amid a general hush of expectancy, broken only by the
rustling of programmes, Herr Batonstein led Ruby on to the dais,
and took his seat at the piano. For a few moments, while the
Professor arranged his seat and his music, and fixed his
gold-rimmed spectacles, Ruby stood, the focus of three thousand
pairs of eyes. Hundreds of lorgnettes were levelled at her, and
then, right round the immense hall, there arose a low buzz of
admiration. "Isn't she beautiful?" "What a face!" "What a figure!"
"What a lovely dress!" This latter remark was heard with much
satisfaction by a plump, good-tempered looking little lady, who
occupied one of the front seats in the southern gallery.</p>

<p>It was indeed a beautiful dress, and as tasteful and appropriate
as it was beautiful. It was entirely of soft white silk, made
plain, yet fitting Ruby's perfect figure to a nicety. There was
real lace draped upon the corsage, and falling over the round white
arms. She wore white kid gloves which reached to the elbows, and
white satin shoes and, from among the masses of her raven hair,
there peeped a small white rose. Round her neck was a string of
small pearls and, depending from these, resting upon her white
throat, was a small, glittering diamond pendant.</p>

<p>She stood, erect and motionless, with her eyes upon the roll of
music she held in her hand, until Herr Batonstein had taken his
seat. Then she raised her eyes, and gave one sweeping glance at the
sea of faces before her, and as the Professor began to play the
prelude to her song, the rustling ceased, the whispering was
hushed, and the vast audience seemed to hold its breath.</p>

<p>The piece that Herr Batonstein had chosen for her was an Aria
from Verdi's Opera, "Aida," entitled "O Cieli Azzuri," and as
Ruby's wonderful voice reverberated through the Hall as she sang
her song of love and anguish, the audience were spellbound. At the
last notes of the sweet lament-died away, there was an impressive
silence for a second or two, then, as Herr Batonstein rose from the
piano, the spell seemed to break.</p>

<p>With one simultaneous accord, the vast audience broke into a
roar of applause. Ruby's triumph was complete.</p>

<p>Again and again she bowed her acknowledgements, and, amid a
storm of cheering, clapping, and waving of handkerchiefs, the proud
Professor led his pupil to the dressing room below.</p>

<p>"Well done, my dear," said he, "well done. You sang it
perfectly, and was as cool as a cucumber. Ach! I told them they
would see what they would see, and they have seen what they have
seen. Listen to them! By Jove! They will fetch the house down. Can
you sing again, my dear? They are clamouring for another."</p>

<p>Ruby said she would do anything he wished.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, my dear. We will show them that we can be gay,
as well as sad. You shall sing them 'Comin' through the Rye.'"</p>

<p>Her second appearance was, if possible, more successful than her
first. Her perfect enunciation, combined with her sweet voice, and
the arch way in which she rendered the words of the well-known
song, fairly captivated the audience. She was again rapturously
applauded, and was the recipient of a number of handsome bouquets.
Herr Batonstein gathered them together, and as he took her hand to
lead her off, he was almost hidden by the floral tributes he
carried. Just as she was bowing her final response to the applause,
another floral offering fell at her feet. It was not a magnificent
one; only a single red rose, and that was partially faded, but she
stooped quickly, picked it up, and pressed it to her lips. As she
did so, she raised her eyes unerringly to the portion of the
gallery from which the rose had descended, and saw, looking at her
with eager, wistful eyes, the pale face of Leslie Raymond.</p>

<p>Herr Batonstein wondered why her hand trembled after singing
"Comin' through the Rye," when she had been "as cool as a cucumber"
when she finished the much more difficult Aria.</p>

<p>He also marvelled how it was, at the conclusion of the concert,
that she could so ungrudgingly present Miss Smart with a spray
bouquet that must have cost a guinea, give another splendid bunch
to Mrs. Batonstein, and divide the others among this one and that,
and yet clung so tenaciously to a trumpery half-faded red rose, now
nestled among the lace upon her bosom.</p>

<p>The next day Ruby's name and the fame of her wonderful voice
were all over Sydney. She and Herr Batonstein received letters of
congratulation from hundreds of the best people, all expressing the
wish that an early opportunity might be afforded them of hearing
her again. Her voice was discussed at the clubs and at ladies' "At
Homes," and those who had been fortunate enough to be numbered
among the favoured three thousand who heard her sing, assumed an
air of superiority over the rest of the community who were not so
fortunate.</p>

<p>Herr Batonstein became more perky than usual, and when he did
the Block in the afternoon, and received the greetings of friends
and acquaintances, he beamed more benevolently than ever through
his spectacles, and said:</p>

<p>"What did I tell you long ago? Did I not tell you that you would
see vhat you would see, and didn't my words come true? 'Ach!"</p>

<p>Ruby received many valuable presents from people whom she did
not know, and she was the recipient of several written proposals of
marriage from men she had never seen, nor heard of, and in many
other ways began to experience the pleasures and inconveniences
that come to all those who are famous yet it is questionable
whether anything, letters, congratulations, newspaper flattery,
presents, or offers of marriage, gave her so much genuine pleasure
as one poor little faded red rose, which she preserved so tenderly.
And, as she kissed it for the hundredth time, she said, "<i>He</i>
told me my voice was worth cultivating. <i>He</i> advised me to get
lessons."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15. OLD JOE'S FLAT
AGAIN.</h2>

<p>About three days after the concert the friends of Herr
Batonstein missed his familiar figure from its accustomed haunts.
No more did his glossy hat come bobbing round the colonnade of the
Post Office, or his gold-rimmed spectacles peer into the music
shops.</p>

<p>The Professor had gone away on a trip. He had decided that
something definite must be agreed on as to Ruby's future
career.</p>

<p>He had found by experience that to come to a definite
understanding with George Sterling by written correspondence was a
long and tedious process. The Professor could speak English better
than he could spell it, and George Sterling's caligraphic
attainments were not of the most brilliant order. So Herr
Batonstein sent George Sterling a note to stay he was corning up
the next day and, packing his valise, he took the train for Molong,
en route to Eugowra and Old Joe's Flat.</p>

<p>There, he was heartily welcomed by George Sterling, and the two
had a long discussion. Batonstein explained the brilliancy of
Ruby's prospects, and backed up his explanation by reading copious
extracts from the newspapers which described Ruby's first
appearance.</p>

<p>"She must go to Europe," said the Professor. "I have taught her
all I can teach her. She is now an accomplished musician! and a
great singer. She only wants the polish&mdash;the finishing
touches&mdash;which she can get nowhere else except in the capitals
of Europe. Then, with her voice, her queen-like presence, and her
natural ability, she will rank among the leading artists of the
world. She will be the rage, and will command an income that a
princess might envy."</p>

<p>It was only after many doubtful shakes of the head from George
Sterling, much arguing from the Professor, and a few tears from
Mrs. Sterling and Madge, that a reluctant consent was given.</p>

<p>"You know," said Sterling, as he smoked one of the Professor's
cigars on the verandah, "the world is such a derned big place, and
Europe is a long way off. Then there's the dangers of travelling;
and there's a lot of temptation in the world for a gal, especially
if she's pretty."</p>

<p>"Don't be uneasy," said Herr Batonstein. "Travelling is done
nowadays with the maximum of comfort and the minimum of danger. She
shall have everything she can wish for, and as to the temptation,
well, I shall always be with her, and Mrs. Batonstein will be with
us. She will be to us as our own child, and will never want a
parent's care. Besides, Ruby can take care of herself. She is as
good as she is beautiful, and as brave as she is good. I believe
she is impervious to temptation. Dozens of men in
Sydney&mdash;eligible and attractive men&mdash;have tried to make
her acquaintance, but she keeps them all at arm's length, and will
listen to none. She is devoted to her Art. You can trust Ruby. She
is proof against temptation."</p>

<p>So it was agreed that she should be placed in the Professor's
charge; always, of course, presuming, as George Sterling said, that
the girl herself wished to go.</p>

<p>Herr Batonstein, having thus far settled his business
satisfactorily, hastened back to town. George Sterling tried in
vain to persuade him to spend a few more days at Old Joe's
Flat.</p>

<p>The Professor was eager for the city, with its life and gaiety,
but he promised that before their departure for Europe he and Mrs.
Batonstein, with Ruby, would come up and spend a week or two with
the Sterlings. Having made this compromise, he hurried hack to
town.</p>

<p>A day or two after his return an announcement appeared in the
papers that Miss Ruby Sterling, the talented young soprano who had
created such a sensation at the late Philharmonic Society's
concert, was about to proceed to Europe to finish her musical
education under the best teachers that London and Paris could
produce; but that, yielding to the popular demand, she had decided
to give three concerts in each of the Australian principal cities
prior to her departure. The first three concerts would be given in
Sydney, and the dates shortly be announced. They would be under the
management of Herr Batonstein, who, up to the present time, had
been Miss Sterling's teacher, and who, with his wife, would
accompany the talented young singer to Europe.</p>

<p>The three concerts in Sydney were given, and each one was more
successful than its predecessor. People were turned away from each,
and at the end of a month the name of Ruby Sterling was on every
lip, her portrait had been published in each of the illustrated
papers, and her photo was on sale in nearly every window. Herr
Batonstein had been careful in the selection of her songs, and the
result was that she never sang the same song twice, and was able to
charm her audience with every variety of style. Each new
performance was a revelation, now an impassioned selection from one
of the Grand Operas, then a devotional piece from an Oratorio;
again, a pathetic old English or Scottish ballad, and at times one
of those semi-humorous productions which blend the pathetic and the
comic so closely together, that her audience would smile even while
the tears lingered in their eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Smart was in ecstacies of delight. She had designed and
made for Ruby a new dress for each concert, and the dresses had
been such a success, and so much admired, that she found herself
the focus of much reflected light, and the recipient of
considerable extra patronage, merely because it had become known
that she made for Ruby Sterling.</p>

<p>The third concert was simply an ovation. The audience seemed
reluctant to let her go. The Mayor presented her with a valuable
souvenir on behalf of the citizens; and a present from the members
of the Philharmonic Society. Flattering speeches were made, and the
building shook with cheers; cheers that were re-echoed by the crowd
outside; who were waiting to see her enter her carriage, which was
filled with the floral tributes she had received.</p>

<p>As she drove away towards her Uncle's house at Moore Park, with
the cheers and acclamations of the multitude still ringing in her
ears, she was congratulated by Herr Batonstein upon possessing, in
addition to her numerous presents, a sum of over a thousand pounds,
all her own earnings. Ruby declined to admit that the credit was
all, or nearly all, due to her, and insisted that the Professor
must share the profits.</p>

<p>"No, my dear," said Batonstein, "not yet. All out of pocket
expenses have been paid, and that is the balance. Some of it will
be required for you education in Europe. When that is complete, and
you begin to earn money&mdash;because this is only a trifle to what
you will earn&mdash;when that time comes, you can pay your old
teacher. Not before. In the meantime, he is more than paid by your
success. To-morrow we go to Old Joe's Flat for a holiday. You shall
romp and run as free as you like for a fortnight. You shall do what
you like with me, so long as you do not ask me to ride a horse. I
am sore now when I think of that quadruped; then, I will take
charge again. We start for Melbourne, where we stay a week, and
give three concerts, then away to Adelaide, where we give three
more concerts, then we take the mail steamer for Europe, and there
will be no more concerts until you have at least six months' hard
study; and then&mdash;Ach! Then to take the world by storm, to turn
the heads of the multitude, und to sing before the Queen."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ruby, "to sing before the Queen!" And for the
rest of the journey home her eyes were closed, and although her
body was in the carriage with Herr Batonstein, rolling over the
wood-blocked streets, her spirit was swinging on a bough under the
willows, at the foot of the orchard at Old Joe's Flat.</p>

<p>Ruby was proud of her success, and her enthusiastic reception by
the public, but she was not proud in the sense some girls would
have been. She was simply delighted and grateful. She was
gratified, as she took her seat in the railway carriage the
following morning, to notice that several people passing along the
platform paused a moment to look at her, and she heard one young
gentleman whisper to a lady who accompanied him: "That's Ruby
Sterling."</p>

<p>She was pleased at the notice she attracted, and when a newsboy
gave her the evening paper, and addressing her familiarly by name,
told her to "never mind the penny," she threw him sixpence and
smiled at him quite as sweetly as she had, on the previous evening,
smiled at the Mayor when he made made her the presentation.</p>

<p>They arrived at Molonog in time for breakfast, and after
breakfast took the coach for Eugowra, where they were met by Mr.
Sterling with the buggy. He had on his best suit, with a stiff
shirt and collar, and had evidently shaved himself just before
starting, for he had a fresh gap in his chin.' And there was Mr.
Pogson at the door of his store, looking Very solemn as he
discussed some knotty theological question with the Captain of the
Salvation Army.</p>

<p>To describe the doings of the next fortnight in detail would
require the space of a volume. George Sterling took Batonstein all
over the farm, and initiated him into various mysteries, such as
grubbing stumps, ringbarking, sheep-dipping, fencing, etc.</p>

<p>One day he would be deeply interested in watching George
Sterling kill a sheep and divide its carcase into legs, shoulders,
and chops. Another day be was just as interested in the shoeing of
a horse.</p>

<p>After some explanation and tuition, Mrs. Batonstein actually
milked a cow, all by herself, and what was more, she churned the
cream, and made it into butter.</p>

<p>There were drives and picnics innumerable, Ruby nearly always
acting as Jehu, while the Professor made himself handy in opening
and closing the numerous gates they passed through.</p>

<p>And then, the music in the evening! Ruby sang all her father's
favourite songs, and Sterling was delighted, although he remarked
that she sang them differently; and he ventured to express an
opinion that in some cases the old way, he thought, was the
best.</p>

<p>They were all very happy, although it was noticed that several
times during family prayers George Sterling's voice grew husky, and
Mrs. Sterling's eyes grew moist, when he invoked a blessing upon
loved ones, who were parted, or who might be parted hereafter.</p>

<p>One morning Ruby was just cleaning the table in the kitchen
after baking when a light step was heard crossing the space between
the house and the kitchen, and a moment afterwards Miss Raymond
stood in the kitchen doorway.</p>

<p>She advanced to Ruby with quick steps, and would have embraced
her, but Ruby laughingly warned her off.</p>

<p>"Take care, Miss Raymond," she said. "My arms are all over
flour, and you would spoil your riding habit."</p>

<p>"Well," said Nell, "you must kiss me, or I shall risk spoiling
it." She put out her lips, and Ruby, holding her hands behind her,
and standing very far away, so that her floury apron might not
touch and soil Nell's riding habit, advanced her lips to meet
Nell's, and in that attitude they kissed.</p>

<p>It was a good solid, genuine kiss, and as its music rang through
the kitchen a deep voice said, "Ach! My vord!" and they saw the
Professor, with his face crimsoned by his late unusual exposure to
the sun, peering benevolently through his gold-rimmed glasses, in
at the kitchen window.</p>

<p>Ruby soon divested herself of all signs of the puff-paste, and
took Nell into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"You are a naughty girl," said Nell, taking Ruby's hand in her
own. "You have not been to Bindawalla to see me, so I made up my
mind to come and see you. How well you are looking."</p>

<p>They talked for some time about various unimportant subjects,
and at length Nell said that she must be going.</p>

<p>"But before I go," she said, "I must tell you what brought me
over at this particular time. I want to have a good long quiet talk
with you. Why did you not come to see me?"</p>

<p>"I should have liked to have called over to see you, Miss
Raymond," replied Ruby; "but you know, and you will forgive me for
reminding you, that it is not usual for the daughter of a humble
selector to visit the daughter of a rich squatter. You must be
aware of the different social scale in which we move."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," answered Nell. "I know that you and I have been
reared almost side by side, and yet as strangers. But, believe me,
I do not, nor did I ever, attach any importance to these so-called
social distinctions. I suppose some distinction is necessary and
inevitable, but it should be only the distinction created by merit
and ability. I have read all about your triumphs in Sydney. I can
see your beauty for myself. If there is any distinction between us,
dear, and I feel that there is, it is I who am the inferior. Come
to Bindawalla and see me. Put on your habit and get your horse, and
ride back with me. I am all alone to-day. Leslie and the dad have
gone to one of the out-stations, and will not be home until late.
Come back and spend the afternoon with me. We will have a nice long
cosy chat, and, believe me, my dear, I shall consider Bindawalla
honoured by your presence. Will you come?"</p>

<p>Ruby could not resist Nell's kind invitation, so, after giving
some minute instructions to Mrs. Batonstein about the puff-paste,
she went with Nell to Bindawalla.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16. RUBY VISITS
BINDAWALLA.</h2>

<p>"I envy you your prospects. I envy you with all my heart," said
Nell, as they sat on the broad shady verandah at Bindawalla. "To be
going out into the great bustling world, with every promise of
making yourself famous. It is grand. It is glorious. So very
different from being cramped up here, where the most a woman can do
is so little."</p>

<p>"But," said Ruby, "to reign at Bindawalla would seem to most
girls a very happy position."</p>

<p>"I am not unmindful of my many advantages," said Nell, "but yet
I often feel that I should like to be able to do some good in the
world. I used not to feel like this, because we were very happy
once at Bindawalla. Day used to follow day, each bringing its own
duties and its own pleasures; but it is different now."</p>

<p>Nell let her hands and her embroidery fall idly upon her lap,
and gazed wistfully across the garden, and away at the distant
hills. She sat thus for a few moments, and Ruby noticed certain
lines upon Nell's face that she had never seen there before. It
seemed as though some hidden grief had left its trace behind.</p>

<p>"Why are things different now?" inquired Ruby. "Have you had
some trouble? Some disappointment?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Nell, as, with a sigh, she resumed her work. "If I
could tell the reason of the difference, I might do something to
cure it. Somehow, we at Bindawalla, dad and Leslie and I, seem
every day to be without apparent cause, drifting apart. At one
time, if one of us had a hobby, we were all interested. If the dad
had a new scheme in hand, he would explain it to Leslie and me, and
we all took an interest in it. If Leslie had a horse in training
for the show we were all as eager for its success as if we each
owned it; while my roses and violets interested them as much as
they did me. Now, the dad has no schemes, or if the has he keeps
them to himself. He takes no interest in my flowers. Spends most of
his time, when he is at home, in his office, and I am afraid he is
in the habit of taking very much more liquor than he used."</p>

<p>"And how long have you notices this change in him?" inquired
Ruby.</p>

<p>"Ever since the shearers' strike, and the burning of the
woolshed," replied Nell. "But it is not only the dad who has
changed. There is Leslie. At one time the merriest fellow alive.
Not a day passed but he had some new idea to discuss with me. Now
he, too, has grown morose. He trained no horses for the last
show&mdash;said he couldn't be bothered. He never has a new idea
now, and seems to be careless of everything."</p>

<p>"Why do not you broach some new ideas?" said Ruby.</p>

<p>"Bless you!" replied Nell, "I have broached them by the score.
But it is all in vain. Only this morning I found the first bud on a
new variety of rose tree that was sent to me from Sydney, and which
I have been nursing so tenderly. Leslie was sitting on the
verandah, in the very seat in which you are sitting now, and doing
absolutely nothing but smoking his pipe in moody silence. I came
rushing round from the garden in a state of breathless excitement,
and called to him to come and see my beautiful new rose. And he
shrugged his shoulders like a great Hottentot, and said he couldn't
be bothered. Only fancy! 'Couldn't be bothered.' Oh! we are
drifting apart. Drifting apart!"</p>

<p>Again Nell let her work fall on to her lap, and Ruby saw a tear
glistening in her eye.</p>

<p>"And have you no idea," said Ruby, "of the cause of the change?
Every effect must have a cause, and to discover the cause is
sometimes tantamount to effecting a cure."</p>

<p>"I have tried to discover the cause," replied Nell, "and I have
failed. Sometimes I think that dad is worried over financial
matters. Not that he can be in real difficulties, you know, but he
lost a lot of money over the shearers' strike. Then the woolshed
was a tremendous loss. The price of wool is only a little more than
half what it was a few years ago. Then there has been the drought.
Sheep dying in thousands through there being no grass for them, and
those that are left are so poor that they are practically
unmarketable. Sheep have been sold at Mr. Pogson's scales lately at
a shilling per head. I dare say all this helps to make dad unhappy,
but trouble ought to draw us together instead of causing us to
drift apart. As for Leslie, well! perhaps he may be dull from the
same cause. But I should like to cheer them, and help them, and I
feel my own inability very acutely."</p>

<p>"Miss Raymond," said Ruby, as she took Nell's hand in her and
caressed it, "you said just now that you felt cramped up here, and
that your opportunities were limited. Why, you have a sacred trust.
Your father and brother are evidently troubled in some way. It is
your mission to lighten their burdens, and bring them that loving
consolation that, in a time of trouble, nobody but a woman can
bring. That is woman's divine prerogative, bestowed upon her as a
direct gift from God."</p>

<p>"But how am I to use it? God knows I am willing. Show me the
way."</p>

<p>"Have patience, dear Miss Raymond, and hope, and faith," said
Ruby. "You will find the way. And now, would you like me to sing to
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh," answered Nell, "I should love to hear you sing, but I did
not like to ask you. If you would&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ruby said of course she would, with pleasure, so Nell linked her
arm in Ruby's, and they went together into the drawing room.</p>

<p>Ruby sang several songs, and Nell declared that she had never
heard anything so sweet before. She predicted a great career for
Ruby in Europe.</p>

<p>"May I ask a favour of you before you go?" said Nell. "I would
like you to write to me from time to time, and to tell me all about
your progress, the people you meet, and the things you see. Will
you do so?"</p>

<p>"I will on one condition," said Ruby, smiling. "I will promise
to write to you, if you will promise to write to me and tell me all
about yourself and Bindawalla."</p>

<p>So a mutual agreement was made, and it was arranged that each
should write to the other.</p>

<p>"Now," said Nell, as Ruby spoke of going, for the sun was
getting low, "sing me one more song before you go, and I walk with
you as far as the first gate."</p>

<p>Ruby took off the one glove that she had already put on, and,
sitting down to the piano, she ran her fingers idly over the keys.
She sat thus so long, playing nothing in particular, and yet
improvising sweet music, that Nell grew impatient, and looking at
Ruby, she noticed that, while her fingers still moved over the
keys, her eyes were closed. Nell laid her hand on Ruby's shoulder,
and said, "That is rather a long prelude, is it not?"</p>

<p>Ruby started, and opened her eyes, at the same time colouring
slightly.</p>

<p>"It was not a prelude at all," she replied. "I was dreaming. I
do not think I can sing any more now. There is someone coming."</p>

<p>Nell went to the door, and looked out across the home
paddock.</p>

<p>"There is no one in sight," said she, coming back. "What made
you think there was somebody coming?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Ruby, "I suppose it was instinct." Once
more turning to the piano, she added, "What shall I sing?"</p>

<p>"Anything you like," said Nell.</p>

<p>So she commenced:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Twee on a summer's afternoon,<br>
A wee before the sun ga'ed doon.</p>

<p>She sang one verse, and had got so far in the second one as the
line which prophesies that the heroine will make "The brawest wife
in Gowrie," when her voice faltered slightly, and she stopped. The
ray of sunlight that fell across the piano had been momentarily
darkened, and as she stopped singing, James Raymond entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Don't leave off," said he, as he sank into a settee and began
to unbuckle his leather leggings and to take off his spurs, "don't
leave off. I just heard enough of your song to want to hear
more."</p>

<p>"I must ask you to excuse me, please," said Ruby. "I am tired of
singing, and must be getting home."</p>

<p>"Are you quite well?" said he, shaking her by the hand, "but
there is no need to ask. You look the picture of health. 'The
brawest wife in Gowrie' eh? But you don't want to be anybody's wife
with that voice. You can do better than marrying, and settling down
on a selection, to milk cows and make butter all the rest of your
life. You can do better."</p>

<p>Ruby bit her lip. She knew that James Raymond meant to speak
kindly. It was his creed that a selector's daughter should marry
none but a selector if she married at all. So she told him she had
no intention of marrying. She was already wedded to her art.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," said he, "although I am sure you will
not go short of offers, but you wouldn't like to settle down to
farming after your town experience. Not but what you might get
offers in town. Many a man, even men in good positions, would be
attracted by your pretty face. But don't marry for money."</p>

<p>"I am not likely to do that," said Ruby. "Besides, it is not
every man who seems to be in a good position who has money. There
are many reputed rich who are not able to pay their debts. Some
time ago, when I met Mr. Pogson in Sydney, he told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did he tell you?" demanded Raymond quickly, starting from
his seat, and confronting her with a fierce look, "what did he tell
you? The scoundrel! If I thought&mdash;quick, tell me! What did he
tell you?"</p>

<p>"He only told me," answered Ruby, smiling, "that there were
ramifications and intricacies in financial matters which the female
intellect was incapable of fathoming, and that many men, reputedly
rich, were scarcely able to meet their liabilities. But you need
not be alarmed for me, Mr. Raymond. If I ever marry&mdash;which I
do not think at all probable&mdash;I shall marry the man I love. If
he should happen to be a selector, that fact would not prevent me
accepting him. If I do not love him I will not marry him even if he
were a King!"</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," said Raymond hurriedly, "but was that
all that Pogson said? Are you sure it was all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Ruby. "He said a lot more than that. He said,"
and she imitated Pogson's voice and manner to perfection, "he said,
'Look not upon the wine when it is red,' and he said that he was
suffering from BILE, and that he had been to a meeting of the
Social Purity Society. But I see you are tired, Mr. Raymond, and
the sun is getting low. I must say good-bye."</p>

<p>She shook hands with him, and he heard her laugh merrily as she
walked across the garden with Nell.</p>

<p>James Raymond stood at the door for a few moments, mopping his
face with his handkerchief, then turned away in the direction of
his office, muttering to himself:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned! What is the world coming to? To think that
Sterling's youngster should stand up and talk to me like that! Why,
it seems only the other day that I saw her, in a pair of thick
lace-up boots, and her father's hat, carting fire-wood from the
bush!"</p>

<p>Ruby and Nell walked to the gate, where Gaffer was already
saddled and waiting. There they bade each other good-bye, and Ruby
mounted her horse. At first she rode slowly. The track to Old Joe's
Flat wound round to the right and then, passing through a
slip-rail, doubled back along the other side of the fence. She had
never been in this paddock since' the morning after the burning of
the wool-shed, and she thought she would like to see the spot where
her horse had fallen with her among the dead timber. So she wheeled
to the left, and cantered across the grass. She rode through the
dead timber, and leapt the fence in the corner of the paddock, and
then, finding that the sun was not yet set, she decided that she
would ride round by the new wool-shed, which she had not yet seen,
and which had been built upon the site of the former one.</p>

<p>She cantered across the ridge, and down the slope to the flat,
where the woolshed stood. The shearing season was just over, and
all the extra hands had received their pay the week before, and
those who had not left the district were "knocking down" their
cheques in Eugowra. The shed itself and the huts and yards
surrounding it, which a few weeks before had been a scene of
bustling activity, now stood solitary and desolate.</p>

<p>So far as Ruby's knowledge enabled her to judge, the new building
was a facsimile of the one which, a little more than a year ago,
had been destroyed by fire. She was thinking that it was strange
that no clue had been obtained as to the identity of the persons
who had set fire to the previous building, for she had no doubt
that it had been wilfully caused. Then she thought, with a sigh, of
the mysterious change that seemed to be coming over the Raymond
family. She decided that she would ride round the western end of
the woolshed, and then make a bee line for home. There would be
only three fences to jump, and it was easier to jump the fences
than to be bothered with gates and slip-rails. Besides, she would
save half a mile, and the sun was going down. The red glow shone
full on her face as she rode down the long lane towards the western
end. Everything was quiet and still, and except the cry of a
laughing jackass from the ridge behind her, there was no sound nor
sign of life.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she soliloquised, "what prompted me to come round
this way instead of going by the track? There is nothing very
handsome nor picturesque about a woolshed, anyhow and it is a
lonely, creepy sort of spot. Some girls would be afraid to ride
round here alone, especially after the scene which occurred here
when poor Old Andy died." She shuddered at the thought, and urged
Gaffer to a smart canter.</p>

<p>As she turned the angle of the building Gaffer nearly collided
with another horse, which was tied by its bridle to the fence of
one of the small pens adjoining the shed. It was Bunyip, and not
two yards away, at the shed door, which he was just locking, was
Bunyip's master.</p>

<p>Leslie started at her sudden appearance. Putting the key of the
shed into his pocket, he advanced, and raising his hat with one
hand, he extended the other in welcome.</p>

<p>"Miss Sterling!" he exclaimed, "what brings you here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Ruby said, shyly, "unless it was&mdash;" She
paused, and flicked a fly off Gaffer's ear.</p>

<p>"Instinct," said Leslie, supplying the missing word. "Say it was
instinct, and I will be content, and bless the instinct. But where
have yeti been?"</p>

<p>"I have been spending the afternoon with your sister at
Bindawalla."</p>

<p>"With Nell? I am so glad. Nell does not often see any lady
friends now." She noticed as he spoke of Nell that his voice had a
note of sadness in it, and that on his face were certain traces of
care or sorrow similar to those she had detected in Nell's face.
After a moment he continued. "But this is not your direct way home
from Bindawalla."</p>

<p>"No," replied Ruby, "I came round to see the new woolshed."</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. Neither seemed to know what to say,
although his hand trembled slightly as he stroked Gaffer's mane,
and Ruby's heart was throbbing violently beneath her close-fitting
habit, which, by the way, belonged to Madge, and was therefore
rather tight for Ruby.</p>

<p>Leslie was the first to break the silence which threatened to
become embarrassing.</p>

<p>"It seems strange," he said, "to see you here, mounted upon
Gaffer. I scarcely know whether I am speaking to Ruby Sterling, the
little girl who used to make the bush melodious with her song, or
the artist who, in the Sydney Town Hall, received the homage of the
multitude. They seem like two separate individuals. I have never
been able to reconcile them in my mind."</p>

<p>"And I have never been able to separate them," said Ruby,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Leslie, "I suppose I ought to congratulate
you upon your magnificent success. Allow me to congratulate
you."</p>

<p>"You did congratulate me," said Ruby. "Do you forget your floral
offering?"</p>

<p>"My poor faded rose? It was the poorest offering of them
all."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Ruby, "the one I prized the most."</p>

<p>"If that is so," said Leslie, "I will always consider a red rose
as the queen among flowers. But is it true that you are going away
to Europe?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ruby; "we are going back to Sydney next week,
from there to Melbourne, then on to Adelaide, and from Adelaide to
Europe."</p>

<p>"And I," said Leslie, "have to live out my lonely life at
Bindawalla."</p>

<p>With his riding whip he viciously cut the top off a nettle that
was growing near the sheep pen.</p>

<p>"Why should you be lonely at Bindawalla?" said Ruby gently. "You
have your sister, and your father. You have your horses and dogs,
freedom, and space. Why, you ought not to know what loneliness
means." Then she added: "Consider your position as the prospective
master of Bindawalla."</p>

<p>"My position," said he, scornfully. "I hate my position, and I
could sometimes find it in my heart to curse Bindawalla. It is my
position, and the prospective ownership of Bindawalla, that stand
between me and all I prize on earth. I wish I had been born the son
of the meanest selector in the district. Then I could have hoped.
But tell me, Ruby, is it yet too late to alter your plans? I will
renounce Bindawalla, if you think our social positions are
irreconcilable. I perhaps ought not to renew the subject we
discussed twelve months ago, but I cannot help it. It is burning my
heart out. I must tell you that if you can care for me I will give
up Bindawalla and all connected with it. I am of age, and can
please myself. There is room out West. Let us go West, and take up
a selection. We can begin as your father began. It only means a
life of work, and that I can cheerfully face. I will dig and delve,
plough and sow. I will do anything to obtain the priceless reward
of your love."</p>

<p>"But you forget your father, and Nell," said Ruby.</p>

<p>"What are they compared with your love?"</p>

<p>She said nothing for few moments, and seemed to be struggling
with her own emotions, while he took her hand, and looked into her
downcast eves with a pleading look, as t though his very life hung
upon her words.</p>

<p>"You mean," she said, speaking very slowly, but very distinctly,
"you mean that you are prepared to abolish the social distinction
that exists between us by lowering yourself to my position?"</p>

<p>"I should not consider it lowering myself. But I am willing to
do anything&mdash;to make any sacrifice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Raymond," said Ruby, "what you suggest would be levelling
downward, and if any levelling is to be done, I always believe in
it being upward. What do you think my life would be worth if I
thought, day by day, and year by year, that my husband had, in the
eyes of his friends, and the world, and in his own estimation,
<i>lowered</i> himself for my sake? No. A thousand times NO! What
you suggest is impossible. Dismiss it from your mind, Mr. Raymond.
Make the best and brightest of your life at Bindawalla. You, may
some day meet someone who will cause you to forget this&mdash;this
dream; and in the meantime, let me work out my&mdash;my
destiny."</p>

<p>"You are cold! You are heartless!" exclaimed Leslie,
passionately.</p>

<p>"No!" said she, kindly, "do not say that! You don't know! Do not
let us part unfriendly," and she looked so wistful, so sorrowful,
and yet so sweet, that Leslie relented at once.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, "it is I who am selfish to want to spoil
your career. But tell me&mdash;do you love someone else?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered emphatically. "I never had a friend near my
own age but you. I wish to go away still feeling that you are my
friend. I am deeply grateful to you for the sacrifice you offer to
make, none the less grateful because I am unable to accept it. If
the time should come when you wish to test
my&mdash;my&mdash;friendship, call upon me. You know I am a strange
girl and that I have strange notions. You told me once to cultivate
my gift, or whatever it is. I have tried to do so, and I believe
that there is something in telepathy. I believe that human hearts,
or minds, or spirits&mdash;call them what you like&mdash;if tuned
in unison, can communicate, ignoring space, along the lines of
least resistance. If you are ever in trouble, real trouble, where
the outlook appears to be dark and hopeless, call upon me. Call
upon me with your whole heart and your whole soul, and I will come.
My heart will receive the message, and I will come. And now, you
see the sun is down. Good-bye, and God bless you!"</p>

<p>Touching Gaffer lightly with her quince rod, she cantered across
the flat, leapt the three-rail fence that divided the woolshed
paddock from her father's farm, and Leslie was alone.</p>

<p>And as the last rays of the setting sun disappeared from the
tree-tops on the distant hills, it appeared to Leslie that the last
rays of hope departed from his life. The gloom that settled over
the landscape, and the deep shadows that gathered round the
woolshed, were not more gloomy than Leslie's thoughts, and the
night wind, moaning as it swayed the tops of the gum-trees, was not
sadder than Leslie's heart.</p>

<p>A shrill sound disturbed him from his reverie. It was the cry of
a curlew. He knew it well, but to-night it seemed to him like the
voice of some malicious Spirit of the Bush, laughing spitefully at
the torn remnants of his ruined hopes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17. A VISIT, AND A RETURN
VISIT.</h2>

<p>As the days and weeks flew by, the clouds at Bindawalla, instead
of dispersing, seemed to increase in darkness and intensity.</p>

<p>James Raymond grew more surly and morose, and Leslie more
miserable. As a consequence, Nell's anxiety increased. All the old
frank confidence between them seemed to have gone, and an
impenetrable air of mystery hung over all. Outwardly, things went
on much the same as usual; the principal difference was in the
members of the household.</p>

<p>The master of Bindawalla took his meals with his son and
daughter, but rarely entered into conversation with them. When he
was at home, and not at meals nor in bed, he remained shut up in
his office, with his table strewn with papers of all sorts, and
with a decanter at his elbow. There he would sit and brood by the
hour, and yet, with all his brooding and studying, he seemed to get
no nearer to the solution of his difficulties.</p>

<p>The fact was that James Raymond, for the first time in his life,
was finding the greatest difficulty in making both ends meet. He
was too proud to confide his troubles to his son, and so he brooded
over them in silence, and sought consolation in the whisky bottle.
Leslie suspected that his father had some secret anxiety, and had,
once or twice, been snubbed when he had ineffectually endeavoured
to ascertain the nature of it. This naturally made Leslie anxious,
but he had a far greater trouble, or what appeared to him to be
greater. He was madly, hopelessly in love.</p>

<p>Ruby had rejected his suit, and had gone. Gone to the other side
of the world, where she would meet success, and be intoxicated with
the notoriety that success would bring, and he would be forgotten.
And yet her image was ever present in his mind, though, while he
silently worshipped her, he sometimes cursed the weakness and
perversity of his mortal nature which would not allow hint to
forget. So he, like his father, sought refuge in solitude.</p>

<p>No wonder that poor Nell thought they were drifting apart, and
felt that she was powerless. So, day by day, they drifted, each
growing more silent, and helping to weave the web of melancholy
which seemed to encompass them like a shroud.</p>

<p>It was six months after Ruby's departure. The days were getting
short, and the evenings long and dreary, and in the mornings,
before the sun was up, the hoar frost lay in the Bindawalla
paddocks.</p>

<p>James Raymond had gone to visit one of the outstations, Leslie
was away looking after some travelling sheep, and Nell was at home
alone. She was sitting on the verandah, with some embroidery on her
knee, alternately working and sighing, as she thought of the gloom
that had settled over their once happy home.</p>

<p>Her meditations were disturbed by the clicking of the garden
gate, so she looked up from her work, and saw Mr. Pogson enter the
gate, and advance between the rose bushes to the house.</p>

<p>Noticing Nell, he raised his hat, and bade her "Good day." She
returned his salutation rather frigidly, and he inquired whether
Mr. Raymond was at home.</p>

<p>"He is not at home at present," said Nell. "I think he has gone
to the woolshed, or to one of the out-stations. Is he expecting you
to call?"</p>

<p>"Well! Miss Raymond," replied he, "that is a question I am not
exactly prepared to answer definitely, either in the affirmative or
the negative. If I were to say he is expecting me, I should be
usurping a knowledge I cannot claim to possess, and if I were to
say he is not expecting me, I should be asserting that which might
he a perversion of the truth. I may say, I think, without being
accused of prevarication, that he may be expecting me, or he may
not."</p>

<p>"I do not think he can know of your coming," said Nell, "or he
would be here."</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied Pogson, "I can wait. I can wait. Patience,
my dear young lady, inexhaustible patience, is the duty and the
inestimable privilege of every truly devout man and Christian
woman. What a blessing it is, when we cannot get the object we
desire, to be able to wait for it, with the sure and certain
hope&mdash;er&mdash;I mean knowledge, that everything comes to him
who waits. I can wait, my dear."</p>

<p>So saying, he sat down upon one of the verandah chairs, and put
his feet upon another.</p>

<p>Nell did not reply, but went on with her embroidery. Pogson
surveyed the garden and the fountain, and watched Nell's deft
fingers flying to and fro. At length he heaved a sigh, and said,
"Did you ever devote much thought, Miss Raymond, to the fallacy of
human impressions?"</p>

<p>Nell said that she had not studied the matter.</p>

<p>"Nor," continued Mr. Pogson, "to the incongruities of
contemporaneous literature."</p>

<p>"No," said Nell, "I have no time to study such abstruse
subjects."</p>

<p>"Well, I have," said Mr. Pogson, "and I am led into this line of
thought this afternoon by contemplating the scene upon which my
eyes now rest, a scone which combines in itself all the elements of
natural beauty, rural simplicity, and&mdash;if I may so express
it&mdash;culture. On the other side of the world"&mdash;and Mr.
Pogson waved his arm in a circle, as though desirous of pointing to
the other side of tho world, but not quite certain as to the
direction in which it was situated&mdash;"on the other side of the
world, even in London, which may be regarded as the place from
which all human knowledge emanates, there is a strong prevailing
impression that the Australian Bush is a desolate wilderness,
peopled only by savage border of spear-throwing and
boomerang-manipulating blackfellows. This fallacious impression,
contemporaneous literature does much to foster. And yet, see how
erroneous it is. Here, at Bindawalla, we have culture, we have
cultivation, and as much delicacy and female refinement as they
find in Bethnal Green or any other aristocratic neighbourhood in
the world's metropolis."</p>

<p>"I did not know that Bethnal Green was particularly
aristocratic," said Nell. "Of course, I have never been in
London."</p>

<p>"Nor have I," said Pogson, "but I have studied its history and
its topography. Bethnal Green is where Buckingham Palace stands,
and it adjoins the old, historic Palace of Whitechapel, where King
Charles the First was executed."</p>

<p>"I thought he was executed at Whitehall," said Nell.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Pogson, "it is all the same. Merely a confusion
of terms. Some call it a hall, others a chapel. This is another
instance of the incongruity of contemporaneous literature, and goes
to prove the correctness of my argument."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Nell gathered up her work and begged Mr. Pogson
to excuse her. She gave him some illustrated papers to help pass
away the time, and then left him to his own devices.</p>

<p>When she had gone Mr. Pogson turned over the papers for a short
time, and then he strolled round the garden, came back and
promenaded the verandah, peeped curiously into the window of the
cosy drawing-room, and then resumed his seat.</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands softly together, and then stroking his long
beard, he thus soliloquised:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes! It's all very nice. All very comfortable and luxurious.
Better than a stuffy store, where the air is permeated with the
odour of kerosene and sheepskins. It is just the place where a man
who has spent the best years of his life in business ought to be
able to settle down, and pass the evening of his days in peace,
rest, and tranquility. And it shall he mine. I'll do it. I can
wait, but the time shall come when Erasmus Pogson will be master of
Bindawalla, and the Raymond family, with all their pride and
uppishness, will be nowhere."</p>

<p>How much farther his fancy would have led him it is hard to say,
for at that moment his meditations went interrupted by the sound of
a heavy footstep on the verandah, and a moment later James Raymond
made his appearance.</p>

<p>"Halloo! Pogson," he exclaimed, as he caught sight of his
visitor. "They say if you think of the devil you will hear the
rustle of his wings. I was just thinking of you."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Raymond," said Pogson, bowing humbly. "I
have just ridden over from Eugowra because&mdash;eh&mdash;it being
such a fine afternoon, I thought it would not be out of place to
remind you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," said Raymond, "I know what you are going to remind
me of, but don't do it here. I never talk business on the verandah.
Come into my office, where we can be private, and then we can talk
without being overheard."</p>

<p>He led the way to the office, Pogson following. Mr. Raymond
indicated a chair, then, looking along the hall to see that no one
was in sight, he closed the door, and locked it; saw that the
window was shut, then sat wearily down, and motioned for Pogson to
commence.</p>

<p>"Being such a fine afternoon," said Pogson, speaking with some
diffidence, and keeping his eyes meanwhile on a brass paper-weight
on the office table, "I thought I would ride over to remind
you&mdash;that last Monday was the Fourth."</p>

<p>"Then," said Raymond, "you have taken a great deal of trouble
for very little. I was quite aware of the fact."</p>

<p>"Then," said' Pogson, "perhaps you have forgotten that a cheque
for interest was due on the Fourth?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Raymond, "I have not forgotten that fact either,"
and he laughed a painful laugh.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you are not aware," said Pogson, "'that I have not
yet received it!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Raymond, wearily, "I am quite aware that you have
not received it. The fart is, Pogson, that I have not got the ready
money, and I cannot get it, and I am afraid I must ask you to wait
until I get advices from London as to the sale of my last
wool."</p>

<p>"Which I believe," said Pogson, looking at James Raymond for the
first time, "is assigned to the Bank!"</p>

<p>James Raymond now shifted his glance to the paper-weight.</p>

<p>"There is some arrangement," said be, "by which the Bank has
first claim, but there will be more than enough to satisfy them,
and to pay your interest as well."</p>

<p>"The overdue interest to date," said Mr. Pogson, "amounts to
over four hundred pounds, and that is increasing and accumulating
as long as it is unpaid. Now, I wish to treat you, Mr. Raymond, in
a purely Christian spirit. So far as the principal is concerned, I
will wait, but the interest must be paid punctually. The security I
hold is diminishing in value. What with the talk of Single Tax on
land values, and of Government resumption of leasehold areas, the
value of landed security is diminishing. I must either have my
interest paid down on the nail, or I must have additional security.
I don.'t want to have to put my foot down, Mr. Raymond, but you
must give me more security."</p>

<p>"What other security can I give?" asked Raymond.</p>

<p>"There is the home station," said Pogson.</p>

<p>"It," said Raymond, "is already mortgaged to the Bank."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Pogson, "for two thousand pounds. But you can
give me the equity of redemption. It is not worth munch as a
marketable security, but, as I said before, I wish to deal with you
in a Christian spirit, and don't want to bring my foot down if I
can help it."</p>

<p>James Raymond groaned. It was maddening to him to be obliged to
sit in his own office, and to listen to a man threatening to put
his foot down on him, and for him to be unable to retaliate. So he
closed the interview as quickly as possible by consenting to sign
the equity of redemption, which Pogson promised to have drawn up in
the strictest privacy.</p>

<p>It would be ready, he said, for Mr. Raymond's signature on
Friday, so Raymond promised to call and sign it, and Pogson took
his departure.</p>

<p>When he had gone James Raymond again locked the door, poured out
half a tumbler of whisky, and drank it neat. Then, sinking into his
seat, he buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>As Mr. Pogson rode across the home paddock his lips wore
puckered and he wore on his face the expression of a man who is
wrestling with a problem. On reaching the stony ridge on the far
side of the sliprails he checked his horse, and turning round in
his saddle, be admired the prospect for some time in silence. Then
he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"Splendid property. Fine fattening country. Permanent water, and
well stocked. Worth a hundred thousand pounds in the market
to-morrow, in spite of the depression. Let me see! He owes me five
thousand four hundred, principal and interest; ten thousand to the
Bank, for which they have a lien over the last woolclip, which will
fetch twice the money. Bah! he doesn't know anything about
financing. But I'll do it. It's worth the risk; besides, I'll do it
in such a way that there will he no risk. Yes! I'll be master of
Bindawalla yet."</p>

<p>With that, he touched his horse with his whip, and jogged down
the hill, whistling "Onward, Christian Soldiers."</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the afternoon of the Friday following the
above interview, Mr. Pogson was sitting in his office. Mr.'
Pogson's office was not an extensive place, nor was it furnished
nor fitted very elaborately. It was simply a small space
partitioned off from the back portion of the store. This space was
bounded on two sides by the brick wall of the store, in one of
which was an opening with a window in it, which commanded an
extensive view of the stable, and a bark-roofed shed adjoining it,
in which sheepskins, hides, and other miscellaneous farm produce
were stored prior to being forwarded to Sydney.</p>

<p>This window enabled Mr. Pogson, whose desk faced it, to keep an
eye on the operations of the men who were employed at the back of
the premises, while the other two boundaries, being of glass, and
facing the store, gave him the means of keeping the other eye on
the men engaged there, and of taking note of all who entered or
departed.</p>

<p>'Mr. Pogson was sitting on his chair, with two sheets of
foolscap paper spread on the desk before him. Both sheets of paper
contained some writing, but on one the writing was much closer
together than on the other. Mr. Pogson sat carefully perusing the
documents, one after the other. His spectacles were on his nose,
and his lips were so puckered that he seemed every moment about to
whistle, but he did not. He was so engrossed with his study of the
documents before him that he did not hear his office door open, and
was not aware that his privacy had been invaded until he felt a
light hand placed upon his shoulder. He started violently at the
touch, and hastily covering up the sheets of foolscap with a
newspaper, he swung himself round quickly in his chair, and faced
the intruder with a frown.</p>

<p>He seemed somewhat relieved when he saw that his visitor was his
own wife.</p>

<p>"Louisa Mary," he exclaimed, "you exasperate me! Why will you
persist in sneaking into my office in that manner? You should
always knock. You know very well that I object to be sneaked
on."</p>

<p>"I did knock, Erasmus," said his wife, meekly, "but you did not
hear me."</p>

<p>"Then you should have knocked louder," said he. "What do you
want?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Pogson, who had on her hat and cloak, and who was just
pulling on a pair of white cotton gloves, replied that she came to
tell him that the buggy was ready, and that, if they wished to get
to Forbes in a reasonable hour, it was time to start.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I cannot start yet, I am expecting Mr. Raymond
here to sign a paper, an equity of redemption, and I can't start
until he has signed it. I expect him every minute, and as soon as
he has gone I will start. You go and wait in the shop."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Pogson went and took her seat on a high stool behind the
counter, near the glass partition of the office, taking with her a
copy of the "Christian Messenger" to read.</p>

<p>When she had gone Pogson turned once more to his papers. He
folded each one up carefully, and laying them side by side, he
looked at them. Seeing that one was folded crookedly, he folded it
again, and then compared them again. As they were folded, the whole
of the writing was hidden, except on each sheet the word
"Signature" and the word "Witnesses." He took a ruler, and dipping
his pen into a bottle of red ink, he drew a line under the word
"Signature" and two lines under the word "Witnesses." He then
compared the two critically; and after blotting them carefully, he
placed one in the inner breast pocket of his coat, and the other in
the large iron safe.</p>

<p>Pushing the door to, he locked it, and then, resuming his place,
waited calmly, with his head thrown back, and face turned to the
ceiling, and softly whistled to himself:</p>

<p>What is our calling's glorious hope,<br>
But inward holiness?</p>

<p>He had not whistled many lines when he heard the loud voice of
James Raymond in the shop inquiring whether Mr. Pogson was in, and
immediately afterwards the little office door was again pushed
open, and Mr. Raymond walked in.</p>

<p>"Well, Pogson," said he, "I see you are busy, as usual."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Pogson, "not very. I was meditating, Mr.
Raymond, simply meditating. Will you take a seat, sir?"</p>

<p>He arose, handed the cane chair to Mr. Raymond, and closed the
office door. Thea he added, "We are quite private here, Raymond.
Although I can keep my eye on the store; and sound is shut out when
the door is shut."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Raymond, as he took the proffered seat, "I
won't stay long, as I have several calls to make, and I must get
home before dark. I have called, according to you, to sign that
paper. Is it ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Pogson, "it is all ready," and unlocking the
safe, he produced the paper he had deposited there a few minutes
previously. Then, adjusting his glasses, he said: "Shall I read it
to you, or will you read it for yourself?"</p>

<p>"You can read it," said Raymond. "I suppose it is the usual
legal tomfoolery?"</p>

<p>"It is very short," said Pogson, "and I would not trouble you to
sign it at all, I would take your word, Mr. Raymond, but the
Investment Society, whose agent I am, insist on all this
formality."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Raymond, "that this business was merely a
matter between ourselves?"</p>

<p>"So it is, Mr. Raymond; so it is. But to oblige you I have to
borrow myself. I am not a millionaire, Mr. Raymond. I wish, sir for
your sake, I was."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said Raymond, impatiently, "I don't know much
about these things. Of course, I'm very much obliged to you, and I
hope to get square some day. But let us get it over."</p>

<p>"We will, sir," replied Pogson. "I will not detain you a moment
longer than is necessary."</p>

<p>He read the document to Mr. Raymond, who expressed himself as
quite satisfied, and took up the pen to sign.</p>

<p>"It will be necessary to have two witnesses," said Pogson.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Mr. Raymond.</p>

<p>"That is the law, sir," said Pogson, shrugging his shoulders and
smiling.</p>

<p>"Damn the law!" said James Raymond, irreverently, throwing down
the pen. "Am I to let everybody know my business?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Pogson; "it is only necessary for the witnesses
to see you sign the document. It is not necessary for them to know
its contents."</p>

<p>Folding the paper as it was before, he said: "There! you can
sign it now, and they can witness it, and they don't know what it
is. I will get somebody to witness it. I see Mr. Meredith talking
to Mr. Bingham outside. I will ask them to step in and witness your
signature. Excuse me for one moment."</p>

<p>Taking the paper in his hand, he stepped out of the door of the
store, and almost immediately returned, bringing with him the two
gentlemen he had named. He apologised for the smallness of his
office, and its scant accommodation, and then, producing the
document, he remarked in a jocular tone of voice, solemnly winking
at James Raymond as he did so:</p>

<p>"Mr. Raymond, gentlemen, has been making his will, and he wants
you to be kind enough to witness his signature. I will not detain
you a moment." Dipping the pen in the ink, he handed it to Raymond,
and while the latter was signing, he remarked in a still more
jovial strain, "I could not witness it myself, you know, because I
am the principal legatee, and it would render my legacy
invalid."</p>

<p>The formality of signing was soon over, and Mr. Meredith and Mr.
Bingham left. Mr. Pogson arose, placed the document in the safe,
locked the door, and put the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>"There," said he to Raymond, "that was soon settled. That was a
good joke of mine about the will. Some people are very suspicious,
you know, especially parsons and bank managers. Now, they will
suspect nothing."</p>

<p>"But how do you reconcile a falsehood with your religious
professions?" inquired Raymond.</p>

<p>"Don't call it a falsehood, Mr. Raymond," said Pogson,
shuddering visibly. "Falsehoods are things which I abominate. I
used the word 'Will' in its broad and general, sense, and not in
the restricted sense in which it is sometimes used. Every time a
man does that which he wills to do, he may be said, in a general
sense, to make his will. I used the word in its general sense, and
therefore I told no falsehood."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Mr. Raymond, "I do not understand these fine
distinctions myself. But I thank you for all your kindness, and
must now go."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Raymond," said Pogson. "Make your mind easy about
the accrued interest. It may run for the next six months if you
like. I will not worry you. Goodbye, sir, and God bless you."
Turning his face upward, and raising his hands with the palms
outward, he closed his eyes and said; "May the blessing of Heaven
be with us, and with all men, now and for evermore, Ah-men!" He
then opened his eyes again, but only to discover that Mr. Raymond
had gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson gathered up his papers from his desk, took several
more from his pocket, put them all in the safe, locked it, and put
the key in his pocket. He put on his hat, took his overcoat from
its peg, shut the office door, locked it, and pocketed the key,
then, turning to his wife, who was still deeply engrossed in the
pages of the "Christian Messenger," he said:</p>

<p>"Louisa Mary, I am ready."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Pogson put down her paper, and went to the door, where
the buggy was in waiting. Pogson stayed to give a few final
instructions to his principal storeman, cast his eye round the
store to see that all was right, and then, kicking a dog that was
sniping at a pile of sheepskins on the footpath, took his seat
beside his wife in the buggy.</p>

<p>"Louisa Mary," said he, as he gathered up the reins, "it is a
beautiful day. How thankful, we should be to the munificent Giver
of all good things for fine weather, and the health to enjoy
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Erasmus," said his wife.</p>

<p>"It should make us meek. It should make us humble, and incline
our hearts to universal charity and sympathy."</p>

<p>"Yes, Erasmus."</p>

<p>Just then the horse shied at a wheelbarrow, and Erasmus, letting
the whip fall heavily upon the horse's flanks, and threatening to
cut its liver out if it shied again, drove off quickly on the road
to Forbes.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18. THE BARRIERS
BROKEN.</h2>

<p>About a month after James Raymond's visit to Eugowra, the
Bindawalla household had just risen from a dismal dinner, and Nell
and Leslie were seated on either side of the fireplace, she gazing
intently into the fire and he scanning a newspaper. Nell had been
recalling Ruby Sterling's words about "a sacred trust at
Bindawalla," and she was wondering if she had made any special
endeavour towards bringing about a happier state Of affairs. She
felt inclined to try what an active campaign might do since a
passive one was evidently a failure. She was meditating upon the
best method of attacking Leslie. She could not very well try to
coax him, because her father had told her that a woman never coaxed
without a selfish motive, and she did not want Leslie to think
that. At last, acting more upon impulse than from any preconceived
method, she kicked his foot, and said:</p>

<p>"Well! Bear!"</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed Leslie, glancing up from his paper.</p>

<p>"I said Bear!" said Nell, "<i>Bear!</i> I called you a BEAR, and
so you are. A great, big, selfish, morose, ill-tempered Bear.
There!"</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to say?" said Leslie.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," said Nell. "I have a great deal more to say, but
I do not know whether to say it or not. It is not an easy matter to
talk to a Bear."</p>

<p>"And why," said Leslie, "this sudden incursion into the realms
of zoology? What has happened to upset you?"</p>

<p>For a few moments Nell did not reply. She took up some "work"
and stabbed away viciously with her needle. Leslie was just about
to resume his reading, when Nell again addressed him.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said she, "that when you went to school they taught
you something about Grecian mythology?"</p>

<p>"A little," said Leslie, "not much. And what they did teach me I
have forgotten. A sheep station is not the place to keep alive
one's interest in mythology, except it may be it reminds one
occasionally of the legend of the Golden Fleece. But why this
sudden transition from zoology to mythology."</p>

<p>"I was wondering," said Nell, "whether you remembered how men
and women used to be changed into birds and animals, and into
trees, and flowers and rocks; how Arethusa was turned into a
fountain, Philomela into a nightingale, and Tereus into a hawk. How
Teiresias became a woman, Narcissus a flower, and how Circe
transformed her visitors into swine?"</p>

<p>"I have heard something of it," said Leslie, "but you know that
all those tales were mere myths."</p>

<p>"I used to think they were," said Nell, "but I have seen a
modern metamorphosis as wonderful as any of them. And the modern
one is no myth. It is real, painfully real."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said Leslie,</p>

<p>"Well, then," she answered, throwing down her work, and drawing
her chair close to his, "I will tell you. There was once a girl who
had a brother, and she loved her brother with all her heart, and
her brother loved her, and she was as happy as the day was long.
Between this girl and her brother there were no secrets. They
shared their joys and their sorrows, as a brother and his only
sister ought to do. And the girl was so proud of him that she
thought no other girl had a brother so kind and so affectionate.
Then it happened that a great change took place, for the girl's
brother was transformed into a bear. The girl still loved him, but
he ceased to love her. Now, don't interrupt me. He ceased to love
her. He grew silent and morose, and ceased to confide in her. All
the old trust was destroyed. There came a great gulf of
estrangement between them, and the girl's heart was broken. Oh!
Leslie, what have I done to forfeit your confidence, and how can I
regain it?"</p>

<p>She rose from her chair and put her arms round Leslie's neck,
and he answered her very gently.</p>

<p>"You have done nothing, Nell, and I have not ceased to love you.
But I suppose I have changed. I know I have been very wretched, but
it is not your fault."</p>

<p>"Tell me your trouble, Leslie, and let me share it if I cannot
drive it away."</p>

<p>"You can do neither, Nell," said Leslie, sorrowfully. "My
trouble is one that will be with me as long as I live. Why should
you bother about it? Don't think I have changed to you; but one
cannot be merry with a broken heart."</p>

<p>"Broken fiddlesticks!" exclaimed Nell. "Your heart is not
broken. People do not live with broken hearts!"</p>

<p>Her brother smiled scornfully, and said, "He jests at scars,
that never felt a wound."</p>

<p>"You need say no more, Leslie," said Nell. "Your secret is a
secret no longer. When a young man talks about his heart being
broken, and follows that up by quoting Romeo, there is but one
solution. He is in love, hopelessly in love. I have long suspected
that this was the cause of your peculiar behaviour, now I know it.
I have sometimes thought the fault might be mine. I am glad it is
no worse."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed Leslie, bitterly. "You speak as though
I were a boy, and had got the measles or something! I tell you,
Nell, my life is blighted."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said Nell, soothingly. "'Alas, poor Romeo, he is
already dead! Stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through
the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft, with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft!' Ha! Ha! You see, Leslie, it was
dangerous to quote Romeo. It was sure to remind me of Mercutio. But
there, don't frown. I am not going to blame you for falling in
love, but I do blame you for being so despondent over it. Your lady
love lives, and while there's life there's hope. See! I have a
letter from her. It only came yesterday."</p>

<p>"A letter from Ruby!" exclaimed Leslie. "Oh! good Nell, read it
to me! Where is she? Is she well?"</p>

<p>"I will read it on one condition," said Nell, "and that is that
there is to be no more secrecy nor coldness between us. Believe me,
Leslie, I will not prove unworthy of your confidence. Is it a
bargain?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Nell, I have been foolish. It shall not occur
again. Since you have found out my secret&mdash;my only
secret&mdash;I will promise that there shall be no more between us.
Forgive me, Nell, and let us be as we used to be."</p>

<p>He kissed her fondly, and Nell, happier, and with a lighter
heart than she had had for a long time, read Ruby's letter to
him.</p>

<p>It described the voyage to Europe, and the wonderful places
touched en route. She had spent a fortnight in London, and
marvelled at its varied sights, and the people she had met. With
the Professor and his wife, she had taken a trip to Ireland, to see
Mrs. Batonstein's birthplace. Then they had been to Berlin, and to
a little German town where Herr Batonstein had spent his boyhood,
and where they found several of his school-follows still living,
who had welcomed the Professor, and listened to his tales of the
antipodes with much wonder. Then they had gone to Paris, and it was
from that city that the letter was written. Ruby was studying
there, and making such headway that her teacher&mdash;one of the
greatest in the world&mdash;was delighted with her progress. Ruby
concluded her letter by sending her best wishes to Nell, and to all
at Bindawalla.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Leslie.</p>

<p>"That is all," said his sister. "What more did you expect? I
think it is a very nice, long letter."</p>

<p>"She does not mention me," said he, sadly. "She has forgotten
me."</p>

<p>"You goose," said Nell. "You know nothing about a woman's heart.
Why, if my opinion is correct, you are the last person in all the
world that she would mention when writing to me!"</p>

<p>From that time Nell and her brother were drawn together by a
bond of mutual sympathy. He seemed to try, by his affectionate
consideration, to atone for his past neglect, and she showed, in a
hundred delicate, tactful ways, that she appreciated the change. If
it had not been for the fact that her father grew more morose and
surly day by day, Nell would have felt quite happy.</p>

<p>The winter was a very dry one, and the approach of summer saw
the run almost bare of grass. The sheep had been kept alive during
the winter by felling the young trees and saplings in various parts
of the station, but they were in very poor condition. And still,
day after day, the sun rose in a cloudless sky, and the rain came
not.</p>

<p>One morning in August the mail had been delivered, and James
Raymond had retired, as usual, to his office. He had not been there
long when Nell heard him calling her by name, and quickly answered
his summons. He inquired for Leslie.</p>

<p>"Send him in at once, my dear," said he "I want to speak to
him."</p>

<p>He seemed to be excited, and she thought he spoke with unusual
cheerfulness. Leslie was not far away, and at once went to the
office.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my boy," said Raymond, "I want to have a chat with
you. A great weight has been lifted from my mind, and I want to
talk to you about it. I have dreaded to speak of it to you before,
but the trouble is over, and I feel that I must talk to somebody
about it," and he laughed in an excited manner. "We have been
passing through a crisis, my boy, a terrible crisis. I have been
losing a lot of money lately, and have had to borrow and borrow,
until I was up to my neck in debt. The strike, the woolshed, the
drought, the fall in prices, they all contributed to it, and I had
to borrow to keep going. For the first time in my life I was in
debt. I owed money to the Bank, and to Pogson, and several overdue
accounts besides. Well, this morning I have received a letter from
the Bank stating that a bank draft has been received covering the
proceeds of last season's wool, and it is sufficient to pay off all
my liabilities, and leave a substantial balance in hand. The tide
has turned at last, and James Raymond can hold up his head again.
Fortune, that has so long been against me, has at length worked in
my favour. I have just been making a rough calculation, and I find
that there will be something like twelve thousand pounds clear,
after paying off the overdraft at the bank. The whole of my other
liabilities only amount to seven thousand odd, and so you see, I
can pay them all, and get out of old Pogson's clutches. My credit
is saved, and a tremendous weight of anxiety is lifted from my
shoulders."</p>

<p>Leslie congratulated his father, and told him that his trouble
had been noted by both Nell and, himself.</p>

<p>"You may, tell her all about it, if you like," said his father.
"I don't mind, now the storm is over. But I could not bear to speak
of it before, my boy. However, it is past. I will go into Eugowra
to-morrow, settle with Pogson, and get back the securities he
holds. Then you and I will take a day and ride round the estate and
see what improvements we can make."</p>

<p>Nell was delighted with the news, and lost no time in telling
her father so; and that evening, at dinner, all the barriers seemed
broken down. James Raymond was like his old sturdy, cheerful self
again, and once more the Bindawalla household was united, and
Nell's pillow was wet that night with tears of gratitude.</p>

<p>The next day James Raymond drove into Eugowra and proceeded
straight to Pogson's store. He found the proprietor sitting in the
little office at the back.</p>

<p>"Good day," said Raymond, cheerfully. "Still busy, I see."</p>

<p>"Always busy, sir," answered Pogson. "Like the busy, bee, sir,
trying to improve each shining hour. But never too busy to attend
to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Well," said Raymond, "I have come to get out of debt. I am
obliged to you for all your kindness, and as I am now able to run
alone, I have come to settle up. I have made out a cheque for the
principal and interest, and as I want to show you that I am not
unmindful of the assistance you have rendered me, I have included
in it the interest up till Christmas next," and he took the cheque
from his pocket book. "Now, if you will hand me over the securities
and the equity of redemption, we shall be square."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson shifted uneasily in his chair, and coughed once or
twice before he spoke. At length he said, "Well, you see, Mr.
Raymond, there are certain legal formalities. A cheque is only a
promise to pay."</p>

<p>"Why," said Raymond, as he flung the cheque on the desk, "do you
think, man, I would give you a cheque if I had not funds to meet
it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Pogson, "certainly not, but&mdash;" and he
hastily snatched the cheque. "Why! This is on the Austral Colonial
Bank! Haven't you heard the news?"</p>

<p>"What news?" demanded Raymond.</p>

<p>"Why," said Pogson, "that bank suspended payment yesterday,
during reconstruction."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Raymond.</p>

<p>"I mean," replied. Pogson, calmly, "that your cheque is not
worth the paper on which it is written. That if you have a hundred
thousand pounds in that bank, you cannot get a penny of it. They
closed their doors yesterday, and it is doubtful when they will
open them again. It means that all who owe the bank money will have
to pay, and that those to whom the bank is indebted will have to
wait&mdash;probably for years. I am sorry for you, Mr.
Raymond."</p>

<p>James Raymond sat for some moments like a man that was dazed.
Then he broke out into a storm of abuse against the bank.</p>

<p>"Why!" he exclaimed, "that is robbery! Highway robbery. My money
was paid in yesterday."</p>

<p>"They call it reconstruction," said Pogson.</p>

<p>"Reconstruction be damned!" roared Raymond. "Curse their fine
phrases! They have my money, and by God! if there's law in the
land, I'll make them disgorge."</p>

<p>"Patience, my dear sir!" said Pogson, "Patience is a virtue that
enables us to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Patience be damned!" said Raymond, as he seized the cheque and
his hat, and rushed from Pogson's office.</p>

<p>That evening as Nell sat on the verandah awaiting the return of
her father from Eugowra, and of Leslie from the stockyard, she felt
that all the weight of anxiety that had hung round her like a
millstone was removed. She sang softly to herself, thinking there
was, after all, something worth living for; and when she heard the
sound of wheels and saw her father driving up to the gate, she ran
lightly to him. She opened the gate, and he descended cautiously
from the buggy. As she ran forward to kiss him he held up his
finger, as if to enjoin silence, and then looked eagerly across the
flat in the direction from which he had come.</p>

<p>At length, seeming satisfied with his scrutiny, he said as he
placed his arm around her, "It's all right, my dear. It's all
right. He said he was reconstructed, but I gave him the slip." Then
he stopped, and laughed boisterously. "Ha! Ha! What fools there are
in the world! He thought I didn't know the difference between a
bank manager and a crow!"</p>

<p>Nell, with a feeling of some indefinable dread in her mind, led
her father to the verandah, and seated him on one of the
settees.</p>

<p>"Did you have a pleasant drive, dad?" she asked, as she sat down
beside him.</p>

<p>"Fairly pleasant, my dear," he replied, "fairly pleasant, except
for the one-eyed fellow."</p>

<p>"What fellow?" said 'Nell.</p>

<p>"The one that was riding on a bale of wool," said her father.
"There he is at the fence now!"</p>

<p>Nell looked at the fence in some alarm, but there was to one
there. "There is no one at the fence, dad," she said.</p>

<p>"How dare you contradict me?" said her father, fiercely. "Do you
think I am mad? Go and tell Pogson I want him!"</p>

<p>"But dad," said Nell, bursting into tears, "Mr. Pogson is not
here."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" said Raymond, furiously. "You are hiding him! I
saw him saying his prayers behind the stable as I came through the
gate. Go and fetch him round, and send him to my office at once. I
want to settle with him, and then <i>I'll take him to pieces and
reconstruct him!</i> I can reconstruct as well as he. Send him in
to me at once," and so saying, he strode off to his office.</p>

<p>Nell was terrified, and did not know what to do. Her first
impression was that her father had been drinking too much, but
somehow, he did not look like that. There was an expression on his
face, and a strange light in his eyes that she had-never seen there
before. Calling to the man who had come to take the buggy to the
shed, she asked him to ride over to the stockyard and tell Leslie
to come home at once. Then, creeping timidly along the hall towards
her father's office, she listened. He was pacing the room with a
steady stride, and occasionally laughing and talking to himself.
She heard him say:</p>

<p>"I know where he is. He's in the safe. I'll keep him there until
Andy comes. I can hear him singing a hymn. I'll hand him over to
Andy, and he can fatten him up for the show. If Andy fattens him
there won't be anything like him for forty miles round, age,
weight, and size. Poor old Andy. He's a long time coming, but he's
getting old."</p>

<p>He paused, and Nell could hear nothing but the measured
footstep. Then he burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! Damn the woolshed! Let it burn. It's a glorious
sight. Ha! Ha!"</p>

<p>Just then Leslie arrived, and Nell begged him to go in and see
what was the matter. Leslie tapped at the office door.</p>

<p>"Come in, Andy," said Raymond, "I want you to catch a
bunyip."</p>

<p>Then, seeing Leslie, he passed his hand in a confused manner
over his forehead, and said, "Is that you, Leslie?" As Leslie did
not immediately reply, he continued, "Go and tell Andy I want him.
Old Pogson's up the chimney, and he's got the scab." Looking
cautiously towards the chimney, he motioned Leslie to be quiet and,
approaching him on tip-toe, he said, "Send Andy in at once; I want
him to dip old Pogson. He's got the scab," and, smiling
significantly, he motioned Leslie to leave the room.</p>

<p>In the hall Leslie found Nell waiting with an anxious face, and
leading her into the drawing room, he put his arm around her.</p>

<p>"Nell," he said, "we have a trouble now that is greater than any
we have known. My poor, dear Nell! Our father is mad!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19. "THE LORD GIVETH, AND
THE LORD TAKETH AWAY."</h2>

<p>No time was lost by Leslie in procuring the best medical advice
for his father, but the doctors who examined him were unanimous in
their opinion that his reason was hopelessly gone. They recommended
his removal to an asylum, but to this advice neither Leslie nor
Nell would listen. He exhibited no violent or dangerous symptoms so
long as he was not contradicted, and so he remained at Bindawalla,
ostensibly managing its affairs, but in reality under the close
surveillance of a man who had been specially engaged to watch
him.</p>

<p>Ill news fly apace, and it was not long before Leslie learned,
to his consternation, that the proceeds of the wool sale were
locked up in the bank, and that, although their liabilities were
increasing, there were no available funds to meet them. He had, of
course, to undertake the management of the estate, and this,
together with the care of his father, and the endeavour to evolve
some sort of order from the financial chaos which existed, kept him
occupied from early morning until late at night.</p>

<p>In all his work he was cordially assisted by Nell, to whom he
confided everything, and whose advice he frequently found valuable.
The credit of the well-known Bindawalla estate was not yet quite
exhausted, and the Raymonds were not without friends, so Leslie was
able to make certain temporary arrangements to carry them over the
immediate future. Shearing time was again approaching, and though
the Bindawalla wool was still upon the sheep's backs, it formed an
asset not to be despised. A large number of sheep had perished
during the drought, but Leslie estimated they could still muster a
hundred and fifty thousand, the fleeces from which ought to average
in weight five pounds each. This was worth at least sixpence per
pound, so, although the money would not be available for many
months, still it represented a substantial asset.</p>

<p>As the shearing season approached and preparations for it had to
be made, Leslie's work increased, but he still found time to devote
an hour or two in the evening to Nell. When work was done for the
day, and their father was asleep, the two would foregather in the
dining room, or on the verandah, and Leslie, having lit his pipe,
they would discuss the events of the day, and the plans for the
morrow.</p>

<p>Nell had received two more letters from Ruby, and in the last
one she had stated that her lessons in Paris were nearly completed.
Herr Batonstein was going to London to arrange for an afternoon
recital, to which all the musical critics were to be invited, and
at which Ruby was to make her first appearance in the metropolis of
the world.</p>

<p>One evening Nell and her brother were sitting as usual, chatting
and comparing notes. Leslie was tired, and Nell had offered to read
him the news. So while he smoked she unfolded the Sydney daily
paper which had arrived by that day's mail, and began to read. She
read the reports on the weather, by which it appeared that it had
been raining along the coast, although none had penetrated so far
inland as Bindawalla. Then she turned to the telegrams and cable
news, and running her eye down them, she suddenly said with an
exclamation of surprise:</p>

<p>"Oh, Leslie, listen to this! Here is a cable message, dated
London, Wednesday evening:</p>

<p><i>"'Miss Ruby Sterling, the Australian soprano, made her first
appearance in London today. She met with a splendid reception from
a large and critical audience. Her success is assured. It is
expected that she will become the rage of the season.'</i>"</p>

<p>Leslie took his pipe from his mouth, and, puffing a cloud of
smoke from his lips, he watched it curling upwards in the
lamp-light until it disappeared. Then he sighed, as he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose suppose I ought to feel pleased, but I am a selfish
mortal, Nell, and I cannot. Yet&mdash;I suppose it is better
so."</p>

<p>Nell kissed him affectionately, and told him that, however hard
it might be, they must try to think that all things were for the
best.</p>

<p>From that time forward there was scarcely a paper received at
Bindawalla that did not contain some reference to Ruby.</p>

<p>At one time it was announced that she had sung at a musical
festival in Birmingham, then, that she had sung in Edinburgh, and
had received an ovation. Another cable briefly mentioned her
appearance at the Albert Hall, London, where she sang before six
thousand people. In addition to the records of her actual
proceedings, there appeared from time to time, rumours of what she
was going to do. It was mentioned that she had been engaged for an
extensive tour in America, for which she was to receive a fabulous
sum of money. Then, this rumour was contradicted, and it was stated
that she would appear on the stage in grand opera. Next, Dame
Rumour went a step further, and intimated that Miss Ruby Sterling,
the eminent soprano, had received many offers of marriage; and that
more than one member of the British aristocracy had sought to bring
about an alliance between an ancient and noble house and O1d Joe's
Flat. But in Ruby's letters to Nell, although she said a great deal
about the places and people she had seen, she said very little
about her own successes.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, easy to imagine, though difficult to describe,
the conflicting emotions that passed through Leslie's mind as he
read the newspaper paragraphs, or as Nell read to him extracts from
Ruby's letters.</p>

<p>Shearing time came and went, and Leslie stuck to his work with
energy and determination. James Raymond still wandered about the
station, and gave instructions for improvements, which, had they
all been carried out, would have involved an expenditure of
millions of money. He never noticed that his orders were neglected,
but he used to fly into an ungovernable rage if his authority was
questioned or disputed. So Leslie and Nell would quietly assent to
all James Raymond's propositions, no matter how absurd or
impossible they were, and strict orders were given to all the
station hands to do tho same.</p>

<p>One evening, some months after the shearing was over, James
Raymond's attendant had gone to get his supper, and Leslie, as was
his custom, had undertaken to remain with his father until the man
returned.</p>

<p>The elder Raymond took a fancy to visit the stables, and so
Leslie went with him. As they walked, he told Leslie that he had
come to the conclusion that the carrying capacity of the estate
could be vastly improved if the gullies were all filled up, and the
hills rolled out flat, and as he was going away he instructed
Leslie to see that this was done before he got back, and Leslie
promised that he would attend to it.</p>

<p>"I am not going to take that man with me," said Raymond. "He
interferes too much. He always wants to come with me wherever I go.
But I'm going to give him the slip to morrow," and he chuckled
artfully as he said so.</p>

<p>They turned the corner of the stables, and saw the boundary
rider's horse hitched up to the fence, with its saddle and bridle
on.</p>

<p>"Do you see that horse?" said Raymond.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Leslie, "that's Dave's horse."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" inquired his father.</p>

<p>Leslie said he was sure it was.</p>

<p>"Then you are mistaken," said Raymond, "it's not a horse at
all."</p>

<p>Then, whispering confidentially to Leslie, he said, "It's old
Pogson."</p>

<p>Leslie, forgetting for a moment his usual caution said, "No,
dad. That's Dave's horse."</p>

<p>"How dare you contradict me?" exclaimed his father, "Do you
think I don't know what I am talking about? Look at the length of
his head. You can tell by that who he is. And see, his knees. Can't
you see that he is in the habit of saying his prayers? But you
don't know a horse from a haystack. Go and fetch Nell. She knows a
horse when she sees one. Go and fetch Nell at once."</p>

<p>Leslie hesitated, for he did not like to leave his father
alone.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" shouted Raymond, evidently getting excited.
"Go and fetch Nell at once, and we'll hear what she says about
it."</p>

<p>Leslie ran quickly to the house, and fortunately found Nell in
the garden.</p>

<p>"Come quick, Nell," he said. "The dad is alone. He has got an
idea into his head that Dave's horse is old Pogson. He wishes you
to decide. By the time you get there he may say that it is Napoleon
Bonaparte. Whatever he says, do not contradict him. He will not
allow it."</p>

<p>Leslie had not been absent from his father for two minutes, but
when he and Nell turned the corner of the stable they saw that the
horse was gone and that James Raymond was some distance away upon
its back.</p>

<p>"Come along," he called to them, "come along. I'll show you how
old Pogson can jump!"</p>

<p>So saying, he urged the horse forward at the stiff three rail
fence that skirted the home paddock. The animal galloped to within
a yard or two of the fence, and then balked. This would have
unseated many a less expert rider, but James Raymond had spent the
best part of his life in the saddle. He merely trotted the horse
back for ten or a dozen yards, and then turned him again at the
fence.</p>

<p>Leslie and Nell were still some forty or fifty yards away, and
were powerless to interfere. The horse was an old one, and had
never been renowned as a jumper, but Leslie yet hoped that he would
clear the fence in safety, and he had so much faith in his father's
horsemanship that he felt that if the horse cleared the fence,
James Raymond would keep his seat.</p>

<p>Again he saw his father urge the horse forward until it
approached the fence, but it balked once more, and then made an
awkward attempt to scramble over it, struck the top rail with both
fore-feet, and then tumbled head first over the fence, crashing
heavily upon its rider as it fell. Then it struggled to its feet
and bolted, but James Raymond lay still. He never moved again, for
his neck was broken.</p>

<p>They carried the master of Bindawalla to the house, and, in
accordance with custom, although they knew he was dead, they sent a
man away on horseback for a doctor, who, on his arrival, had to
perform the merely formal duty of declaring that death must have
been instantaneous.</p>

<p>There was a knoll of rising ground about half-a-mile from the
homestead at Bindawalla, where half an acre of ground was enclosed
by a neat pallisading fence. In each corner of the enclosure stood
a large Norfolk Island pine, and between the pines were a few
laurels and some wattles. The enclosure had long since been
dedicated as a cemetery, and a white marble obelisk in the centre
marked the resting place of those members of the Raymond family
who, since the first occupation of Bindawalla, had gone before.</p>

<p>It was in this peaceful spot that the body of James Raymond was
laid. It was accompanied there by the usual cavalcade of coaches,
buggies, and horsemen. There was not a family residing within
thirty miles who was not represented, and Several of the
neighbours, while expressing their sympathy with Leslie in his
bereavement, took this, the earliest, opportunity of congratulating
him upon his newly acquired dignity as master of the fine estate of
Bindawalla.</p>

<p>The last to take his departure was Mr. Pogson. While the rest of
the friends had been expressing their condolences and taking their
leave, Mr. Pogson had been strolling round the homestead,
meditating. The subject of his meditation was known only to
himself. It may have been the complex problem of life and death;
the frailty of the former, and the certainty and unerring fidelity
of the latter, with the useful lessons to be derived therefrom.
But, his meditation being at last ended, Mr. Pogson bade Leslie and
Nell good-bye.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dear young friends," he said, "good-bye. In a day
or two, when the first anguish of your grief is over, I shall see
you on business. In the meantime bear those misfortunes you have
with a stout heart, and pray for power to face those that are to
come, with humility and resignation, and with a contrite spirit.
Remember that the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. Let us
endeavour to be thankful to Him for all His mercies. Let us ever
pray that, when you at last awake to a full realization of your
position, you may console yourselves with the blessed fact that He
will temper the wind to the shorn lambs. Good-bye. Bless you."</p>

<p>So Mr. Pogson departed, and Leslie and Nell were left in the
house which seemed so silent and empty, alone with their great
sorrow.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20. THE LAW AND THE
PROPHETS.</h2>

<p>A search among the papers of the late James Raymond failed to
reveal anything in the shape of a will, and Leslie had written to a
firm of Sydney solicitors, whom the knew his late father had
employed in several business matters, asking their assistance in
taking out letters of administration.</p>

<p>He had forgotten all about Mr. Pogson's promised visit, when,
about a week after his father's funeral, he received a letter from
that individual, stating that he would, with his Solicitors, drive
out to Bindawalla the next day, and requesting Leslie to be at
home, as the business was of vital importance.</p>

<p>Leslie showed the letter to Nell.</p>

<p>"What can he want?" said he. "I know he has some claim against
the estate, but he ought to know that we can do nothing until
letters of administration are granted."</p>

<p>"I suppose you will know his business when he comes," said Nell,
"so in the meantime you must not worry about it. Perhaps he thinks
you will employ his solicitor to assist you."</p>

<p>"It is too late for that now," answered Leslie. "I have already
written to Scarem &amp; Co." And he tossed Pogson's letter
aside.</p>

<p>The solicitor who accompanied Mr. Pogson on the following day
was a Mr. Callow, of Forbes, who was in the habit of visiting
Eugowra once a week. He was known to Leslie and bore the reputation
of being as honest as his profession would allow him to be. That
is, he endeavoured, so far as he could, to promote the interests of
those who paid him, without troubling himself too much to inquire
whether his client's interest was the interest of truth and justice
or not.</p>

<p>They arrived at Bindawalla about two o'clock in the afternoon.
Nell was in the garden, and Leslie on the verandah. Both spoke to
the visitors, and the lawyer shook Leslie warmly by the hand. After
a few remarks about the weather he suggested that they should get
to business.</p>

<p>"I am ready," said Leslie, and Nell turned to leave them.</p>

<p>"I would suggest, then," said Mr. Callow, "that we adjourn to a
place where we shall be more private, and as my business, to some
extent, concerns your sister as well as yourself, I would also
suggest that she should accompany us."</p>

<p>Leslie, whose curiosity was somewhat aroused, called Nell, and
with her, he led the way to the office.</p>

<p>They seated themselves, Leslie at the large office table, which
was strewn with papers, Nell by his side, Pogson on a chair near
the door, and the lawyer, who had a brown leather bag in his hand,
sat near the end of the table, and laid the bag in front of him. He
drew off his gloves, coughed once or twice as he did so, and then,
leaning back in his chair, and tapping the tips of his fingers
lightly together as he spoke, he said:</p>

<p>"I believe, Mr. Raymond, that Miss Raymond and yourself are the
sole surviving members of the family of the late Mr. Raymond, your
father?"</p>

<p>"We are," replied Leslie.</p>

<p>"You will pardon me asking the question," continued Mr. Callow,
"but I wanted all parties interested to be present. It seems they
are present. So far, so good."</p>

<p>During this preliminary conversation Mr. Pogson sat with his
eyes fixed on the ceiling as though be was engaged in counting the
knots in the varnished Lachlan pine of which the panels were
made.</p>

<p>"Then," continued Mr. Callow, still tapping the finger tips of
one hand lightly against the finger tips of the other, "as all
interested parties are present, it is my duty, as a lawyer, to
inform you that the law is paramount, and that we must all bow to
the law. Now the law assumes, and I think quite rightly, that the
ownership of all property is vested in the man to whom the property
belongs. Another legal axiom is, that every man is at liberty to do
as he likes with his own. In this country, where there are no laws
of primogeniture, or entail, every man who is of sound disposing
mind can bequeath his property to whom he likes and devote it to
any purpose he likes.</p>

<p>"I am quite willing to admit the truth of all you say," said
Leslie, "but, you will pardon me, I do not quite see where it is
leading us."</p>

<p>"We will come to that in due course," said Mr. Callow, calmly.
"I am glad that you admit the correctness of my legal axioms,
because it may save any misunderstanding hereafter. I wish you to
realize, Mr. Raymond, that I have to interpret the law as I find
it. I am only the instrument, not the maker of the law. Now, the
law says that if a man, in the full possession of all his mental
faculties, of his own free initiative, and without undue influence,
makes his will, it does not matter how ridiculous, how curious, nor
how unfair that will may appear to be, it is irrevocable,
absolutely irrevocable. Therefore, your father, the late Mr. James
Raymond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it does not apply," interrupted Leslie. "My father made no
will."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Raymond," said the lawyer, "that is just what
brings me here. Your father <i>did</i> make a will. I have a copy
of it in my bag, and as I copied it myself, I am prepared to make a
statutory declaration, if necessary, that it is a correct copy.
Having, as a lawyer, examined the will, I am prepared to state that
it is all in due form, signed, sealed, witnessed, and everything
according to law. I will, if you desire it read you the copy, but
there is one question I should like to ask first, as may
information upon that point is not quite clear. Can you tell me
whether your father's mind became unhinged suddenly, or
gradually?"</p>

<p>"Suddenly," replied Leslie. "He left here in his usual health,
and in better spirits than usual, in the morning; and when he
returned in the evening, he was mad."</p>

<p>"Can you give me the date?" asked the lawyer, dipping his pen in
the ink.</p>

<p>"The date is engraven on my memory," said Leslie. "It was the
day after the bank stopped payment. The last cheque my father
signed is here. He signed it on the 30th of August, and on that day
he lost his reason."</p>

<p>"There can be no mistake about that date?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," said Leslie. "Nell here can swear to it if
necessary."</p>

<p>"And did your father, prior to this date, ever show any signs of
mental aberration?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"And I suppose Miss Raymond can corroborate that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I can," said Nell.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the lawyer, "the will was signed by your
father on the third of June; nearly three months before he showed
the first symptoms of mental aberration."</p>

<p>Still tapping his finger-tips together, the lawyer smiled at
Leslie in an inquiring way, as though asking him what he had to say
to that.</p>

<p>Leslie had nothing to say. He was astonished, and simply stared
back at the lawyer. For awhile nothing was said on either side, Mr.
Pogson being still engaged in his self-imposed task of counting the
knots in the ceiling. At length Leslie, with a slight tremor in his
voice, said:</p>

<p>"May I ask the purport of the will?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you may," said the lawyer. "Under the circumstances,
I think the question a natural one, and I dare say that our friend
Mr. Pogson will agree with me."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson, who appeared to be whistling, although, his lips
emitted no sound, nodded his assent, without removing his eyes from
the ceiling.</p>

<p>"The will," said Mr. Callow, "is one of those short, concise
wills which are impossible to misunderstand, and in which it is
impossible to find a flaw. I will read it to you if you like, but I
can tell you its purport in a very few words. By the will, of which
this is a true copy, and which copy I am prepared to leave with
you, the whole of the real and personal property, wherever
situated, without any reservation whatever, is left to our dear
friend, Mr. Erasmus Pogson, and the said Mr. Erasmus Pogson is
appointed, by the late Mr. James Raymond, as the sole executor to
this his last will and testament."</p>

<p>"And Nell and myself?" said Leslie.</p>

<p>"I regret to say," said Mr. Callow, "that no mention is made of
Miss Raymond nor yourself."</p>

<p>"Then," exclaimed Leslie, passionately, "it's a lie! An infamous
lie! My father would never have made a will like that! There is
some plot&mdash;some fraud&mdash;about the whole thing."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear you speak like that," said the lawyer,
"because your words are actually libellous. But, of course,
allowances must be made, and I am sure my friend will make
them."</p>

<p>"I am willing to make every allowance," said Mr. Pogson. "I
anticipated that, no doubt, Mr. Leslie would be disappointed. But
he must learn the lesson of humility and resignation, those twin
virtues which go so far to soften the hard asperities of human
existence. We must all bow, with a humble spirit, to the
dispensations of Providence."</p>

<p>Leslie, with a passionate exclamation, started to his feet, at
which Mr. Pogson retreated towards the door, but Nell placed her
hand on her brother's arm, and drew him gently back into his
seat.</p>

<p>"Keep your temper, Leslie," she whispered, "we must have advice
and time to think."</p>

<p>After a moment's pause, and an evident struggle with himself,
Leslie answered, "You are right, Nell. We must have time to
think."</p>

<p>"My esteemed client," said Mr. Callow, "is perfectly willing to
give you time. But you must remember that my client, being the
owner of Bindawalla, is responsible for all liabilities contracted
by your late father, and for any expenditure connected with the
estate since his decease. It is therefore necessary that he should
be represented here, and that his representative should see that no
waste nor other maladministration is allowed. He is willing,
however, to give you all reasonable time. He has decided that you
and your sister may remain here for three days, so as to give you
time to arrange for your future proceedings."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Mr. Pogson, who still stood with his hand on the
door, "to act with the utmost Christian charity and leniency
compatible with a due regard for the interests of my property and
my estate. To prove my forbearance, I am willing to extend the time
to six days."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing, and say nothing until I have seen my
solicitor," said Leslie. "He will be here to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to give him all the information in my power,"
said Mr. Callow, "but I am, sure he will agree with me that the
will is good, and absolutely irrevocable."</p>

<p>"Be kind enough to leave us," said Leslie. "I do not believe my
father ever signed such a will. If I thought he did, and was in his
right mind, then I should lose my faith in all that was good and
honourable, and would go at once. I would not sleep another night
under this roof."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson, who had been nervously fingering the handle of the
door, seemed very glad to have the interview over, and so, acting
upon Leslie's hint, he and Mr. Callow took their departure, the
lawyer leaving the copy of the will for Leslie's perusal.</p>

<p>Leslie and his sister read the document over and over again, bu
the more they studied it, the more perplexed they became. It was,
as the lawyer had said, very short and concise. So brutally concise
that it was capable of only one interpretation. It was, being a
copy, of course unsigned, but the names of the two witnesses were
written in pencil.</p>

<p>"Surely," exclaimed Leslie, "neither Mr. Meredith nor Mr.
Bingham would lend themselves to a fraud. I must see them at
once."</p>

<p>"Wait until to-morrow, Leslie," said Nell. "You have to meet Mr.
Scarem in Eugowra to-morrow. See them with him then."</p>

<p>Leslie took her advice, and decided to wait. In the meantime,
they were stunned by the blow. And yet, although the prospect of
being severed from the home of their birth and their childhood was
a bitter one, the thought that oppressed them more than any other
was that, if this thing were true, it was the deliberate act of
their father, whom they had loved so well, and who had always, so
far as they could judge, loved them.</p>

<p>To divert his thoughts Leslie took up the Sydney paper, and
glanced through its contents for some time without really
understanding a word he read, until his attention was riveted by
the following cablegram:</p>

<p>"<i>The Prince and Princess of Wales held a reception tonight at
Marlborough House. Miss Ruby Sterling sang two songs, and was
personally complimented by His Royal Highness upon her exquisite
singing.</i>"</p>

<p>After a sleepless night Leslie started for Eugowra to meet Mr.
Scarem, who, in view of the magnitude of the Bindawalla property,
had considered it worth his while to journey from Sydney to confer
with Leslie as to the administration of the estate.</p>

<p>The lawyer was considerably surprised when he heard the new turn
that affairs had taken.</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "Why, it was only on the last
occasion that your father visited Sydney that I was urging him to
make his will, but he only laughed, and asked me if I thought he
was going to peg out. There must be some mistake. Who were the
witnesses?"</p>

<p>Leslie told him their names, and the lawyer suggested that the
two gentlemen should be seen without delay.</p>

<p>"Shall I bring them here?" asked Leslie, as they sat in the snug
parlour of the hotel at Eugowra.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Scarem, "we will question them separately. If
there is any collusion we shall then probably find out."</p>

<p>So they went first to the bank, and saw Mr. Bingham, who, while
expressing his sympathy with Leslie, told his tale very frankly and
plainly. He remembered perfectly the occasion of the will being
signed. He was talking to Mr. Meredith in the street, when Mr.
Pogson called them into his store, and asked them to witness Mr.
James Raymond sign his will. They went in, and Mr. Raymond signed
it, and he and Mr. Meredith witnessed the signature. That was all
he knew. The whole affair did not take ten minutes, and James
Raymond left immediately afterwards. In fact, he passed Mr.
Meredith and himself at the door of the store.</p>

<p>"Did you know the contents of the will?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Bingham, "I did not. I asked no
questions."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Raymond acknowledge the document to be his will?"</p>

<p>"I don't think Mr. Raymond said so, in so many words," said Mr.
Bingham, "but prior to his signing it, Mr. Pogson explained in his
presence that it was his will, and Mr. Raymond did not contradict
him. And now I remember that he also tacitly admitted that Mr.
Pogson was the principal legatee."</p>

<p>"It seems," said the lawyer, "by this copy, that he is the only
legatee."</p>

<p>They went next to Mr. Meredith, who simply corroborated Mr.
Bingham in every particular.</p>

<p>Upon being asked whether Mr. Raymond appeared to be in his right
mind, Mr. Meredith said that he conversed with Mr. Raymond that
day, both before and after the signing of the will, and that he was
as sane as a man could be.</p>

<p>Before leaving Eugowra, Mr. Scarem rang Mr. Callow, and was
shown the will itself. Mr. Meredith and Mr. Bingham also saw it,
and identified the signatures, so, there being nothing more to be
done at Eugowra, Leslie and Mr. Scarem drove out to Bindawalla.</p>

<p>They discussed the matter far into the night. Mr. Scarem was
particular in his inquiries as to the relations between Leslie and
his father.</p>

<p>"Did you ever quarrel with him?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Not seriously," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"Oh, then you did quarrel?" said Mr. Scarem.</p>

<p>"Once, a long time ago," admitted Leslie, and then, thinking
that perfect confidence was the best course, he told the lawyer all
about the quarrel, and how his father had threatened to horsewhip
him.</p>

<p>After hearing this and a few more explanations, the lawyer
seemed to have made up his Mind.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "your father was a very proud man, and he
was intensely bitter against free selectors. I should imagine that
he would be strongly opposed to the prospect of a free-selector's
daughter becoming the mistress of Bindawalla. Depend upon it, the
matter dwelt in his mind, and caused him to make the will the way
he did."</p>

<p>"My father never knowingly signed that will," said Leslie,
emphatically.</p>

<p>The lawyer shrugged his shoulders and knocked the ashes off the
end of his cigar.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said he, "that the evidence is all the other
way."</p>

<p>"Well," said Leslie in despair, "what is your advice?"</p>

<p>"If you have a few thousands to spare, and a taste for
litigation, you might contest the will. But it will be a costly
affair."</p>

<p>"I have not a pound in the world," said Leslie. "I have always
been dependent upon my father, and was always led to believe that,
at his death, the estate was to be mine." Then, staring blankly at
the solicitor, he added, "Unless this will is upset Nell and I are
absolutely penniless."</p>

<p>"Then," said the lawyer, "however painful it may be for me to
say and for you to hear it, is my duty to advise you, unless you
can get fresh evidence of an important character, to accept the
inevitable. So far as I can judge, the will is your father's will,
and you have not a ghost of a chance of upsetting it."</p>

<p>Mr. Scarem left for Sydney the next morning rather annoyed to
think that he had been wasting his time, and making an unprofitable
journey. He had to wait in Eugowra for half an hour for the coach,
so he took advantage of the delay to call upon Mr. Pogson, and
assure him that, as his firm had always transacted the Bindawalla
business for the late James Raymond, it would be equally happy to
give its best attention to any business that the new owner of
Bindawalla might be disposed to trust to it.</p>

<p>"What are we to do, Nell?" said Leslie, when Mr. Scarem had
departed; "are we to give up the home of our childhood without a
struggle?"</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> we do?" said Nell. "The lawyers seem to think
we have no legal claim. If Bindawalla belongs to Mr. Pogson we do
not want to live here. We MUST give it up," and she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Nell," said Leslie. "We must face the world, but at
least we will face it together. I have not the slightest idea of
the best way to earn a living, but I may be able to get the
management of a station, or failing that, I must join the mounted
police. I suppose I could ride well enough for that. The greatest
difficulty will be to get through the interim that must elapse.
Where can we go?"</p>

<p>They discussed this question for some time, without arriving at
a satisfactory solution. They both knew that, a month ago, there
was not a squatter's family within a hundred miles but would have
been delighted to know that Leslie and his sister were coming to
stay with them for a. month. But they also knew that entertaining
the prospective owner of Bindawalla and his sister was one thing,
and giving a month's shelter to two penniless outcasts was quite
another. They both inherited a sufficient quantity of their
father's pride to cause them to shrink from the ordeal. In fact,
they shrank instinctively from the necessity of meeting old
acquaintances under the altered circumstances. It would have been a
relief if they could both have suddenly transported themselves to
some unknown part of the world, where, among strangers, they could
have begun life anew.</p>

<p>They had not decided anything as to their future, when a small
buggy drove up to the gate. Out of the buggy stepped Mr. Meredith,
who handed Mrs. Meredith out after him, and both walked up to the
house.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," said the parson, "Mrs. Meredith and I have
taken the liberty of running over to call on you. We wished to
offer you our sympathy in your trouble. I wrote three letters to
you last night, but none of them seemed to me to express exactly
what I meant, so Mrs. Meredith suggested that I should drive her
over. I thought I would like a chat with you."</p>

<p>"And I wanted a chat with Miss Raymond," said Mrs. Meredith.</p>

<p>Leslie and Nell made an effort to appear pleased at the
unexpected visit. Mr. Meredith discussed casual topics with Leslie
for some time, while Mrs. Meredith talked to Nell, and admired her
roses, the roses she was so soon to lose.</p>

<p>At length, just as they seemed to have exhausted all ordinary
subjects of conversation, Mr. Meredith, laying his hand kindly on
Leslie's shoulder, said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Raymond, I trust you will not think me inquisitive. I know
all about your difficulties. Have you decided yet what you are
going to do?"</p>

<p>"We have decided nothing," said Leslie. "We must, I suppose,
leave Bindawalla. I must earn a living somehow. I am not afraid of
that, but I am worried about Nell. I don't know what to do in the
interim."</p>

<p>"That is one of the things I wanted to talk about," said the
parson. "Your know, Mr. Raymond, that although I have been some
years in Eugowra, we have not seen much of each other. I don't know
why. We are not far off the same age, and should have many tastes
in common. I recollect playing football with you, when we were both
at school. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>Leslie said he had no recollection of having met Mr. Meredith on
the football field.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Meredith, "you were playing for the Grammar
School, and I for the High School. It was on the Association
ground, the scores were equal, and time was nearly up. We had a
scrum. One fellow got hurt."</p>

<p>"Was it Jenkins?" asked Leslie, evincing, for the first time,
some interest in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Meredith, "it was Jenkins, of the Grammar School.
Just as he fell, he passed to you. You ran, and nearly scored, but
I tackled you. You were bigger than I, but I downed you and got the
ball out of bounds. Then we touched, and won the match."</p>

<p>"Were you the little beggar who downed me?" said Leslie. "My
word! You were a game one."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Meredith, modestly, "I got no end of praise from my
side. I don't think I was ever prouder of anything in my life."</p>

<p>Both men were silent for a moment, as their minds went back to
the old schoolboy days. Then Mr. Meredith spoke again.</p>

<p>"I have often thought," said he, "that I would like a good chat
with you about old times. The old boys are scattered now, and we
don't often meet them. Before you leave Eugowra I should like you
to come and spend a week or two with us, you, and Miss Nell. Our
home is only a humble one, but if you can put up with the
accommodation, it, will delight Mrs. Meredith and myself. And if
you have to go away on business, you know, at any time, Miss Nell
could stay as long as convenient to her. In short, I want you
to&mdash;a&mdash;come and visit us."</p>

<p>The parson had tried to put the thing as delicately as he could.
He and his wife had come with the intention of frankly offering the
shelter of their roof to Nell and her brother in their trouble, and
yet, Mr. Meredith did not want to wound their feelings, by causing
them to think he was offering them charity. So he pleaded for the
honour of their company, and pleaded so successfully that Leslie
really thought he would be conferring a favour on the parson by
accepting his invitation, and the parson and his wife went away
quite proud of the success of their mission.</p>

<p>When they had gone, Leslie remarked to Nell that, under the
circumstances, nothing could have been more fortunate than the
invitation. "It will at least give us time to breathe," he said.
"And really, Meredith seems a very nice sort of fellow when you
come to talk to him. It is a wonder that a man of hi attainments
and ability cares to bury his talents in Eugowra."</p>

<p>"His wife is extremely nice," said Nell. "She talked to me like
a sister, or an old familiar friend."</p>

<p>"Well, we have crossed the Rubicon," said Mr. Meredith, as he
got into the buggy after replacing the slip-rails at the first
fence. "The die is cast. They will come, and now, for ways and
means."</p>

<p>"I will be very careful in the house," said his wife, "and, of
course, we cannot manage anything in the way of luxuries. Still, I
suppose a cold joint will not last quite so long as it does now.
But I have been thinking that if I alter the hat I wore last
summer, and clean it, I can make it do again, and we can save the
expense of the new one you wanted me to get."</p>

<p>"We'll see," said the parson. "I don't like the idea. I had set
my mind on the new hat. Perhaps we might sell Daisy. She is worth
five pounds, and we could buy our milk for a while."</p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith sighed, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"If I could only induce the people to make an effort to pay the
stipend owing," said her husband, "we should be all right. But we
must look forward with courage. We are doing the right thing, and
it will all come right in the end. But I must steel my heart
against all extraneous applications for charity. Our slender means
will not stand them. The next tramp that comes along, mind, I am
adamant!"</p>

<p>His wife smiled.</p>

<p>"I remember," she said, "hearing something like that before.
Only last week you said the same thing, and yet, two hours
afterwards, you gave away the only decent pair of boots you had, to
a tramp."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, I know, but he was an old man, and his feet were
sore." Then the added, with a twinkle in his eyes us he held up his
right foot for her to examine, "I did not make a bad job of
patching the old ones. They look quite respectable. I believe I
could earn more money mending boots than I can at preaching."</p>

<p>Little did Leslie and Nell dream of the extraordinary expedients
resorted to in order to find accommodation for them. When the
Merediths reached home the parson took off his coat, and both he
and his wife set to work to prepare for the expected visitors.</p>

<p>They had only two bedrooms in the house, but fortunately there
was a little skillion room at the back, which was used as a
receptacle for garden tools, harness, and old lumber of all
kinds.</p>

<p>So they arranged that Nell should share Mrs. Meredith's room,
and that Leslie should have exclusive possession of the spare room,
while the parson himself proceeded to build a stretcher with some
saplings and empty corn-bags and, after packing the tools and
harness in one end of the lumber-room, he established his stretcher
in the cleared space. Mrs. Meredith was afraid that the draught
between the joints of the slabs might bring on an attack of his old
enemy, neuralgia, but the parson guarded against that by pasting
paper over the cracks. When he had done that, and improvised a
patent button for keeping the door shut, he declared that it would
do splendidly.</p>

<p>"I shall sleep here," said he, "as peacefully as possible. How
many poor wretches have a worse sleeping place, and who shall say
that I am more worthy than they? Besides, look at the convenience
of the arrangement. If I should get a sick call in the night, I can
get up and attend to it without waking the whole establishment.
Why, it's grand!"</p>

<p>He smiled happily as Mrs. Meredith impulsively drew his face
down to hers, and kissed him. Then the two sat down to their humble
supper with minds as peaceful and contented as many a Bishop and
his Lady.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21. THE PARSON HAS HIS
HANDS FULL.</h2>

<p>It was Saturday afternoon when Nell and Leslie bade a sorrowful
farewell to the home of their childhood. It needed all Mrs.
Meredith's Sisterly tact and kindness to keep Nell from breaking
down entirely. As for Leslie, he was wretched.</p>

<p>He felt his misfortunes acutely but, in addition to his
despondency, he was far from well. His mental sufferings were
great, but his physical pain was greater, for he had a racking
headache, and, although the weather was unusually warm, he
complained of feeling chilly. He could not eat and apologised to
Mr. Meredith for being such poor company.</p>

<p>"Don't apologise," said the parson. "Go to bed. You will feel
better in the morning. I always go to bed early on Saturday night,
because Sunday with me is a very hard day. To-morrow I have to
preach, twelve miles away, at eleven o'clock. Then I have to ride
eight miles, and preach at Cow Flat at three. I shall leave there
at half-past four and have eleven miles to ride home, after which I
preach in Eugowra, at seven. We have a practice of calling the
Sabbath a day of rest," and he smiled, "but sometimes I am pretty
well knocked up."</p>

<p>"And I suppose," said Leslie; "that the salary is not
princely?"</p>

<p>"I get, if I am fortunate," said Mr. Meredith, still smiling,
"about as much in a year as a shearer would during the shearing
season. But don't think I am complaining. My heart is in my work,
and I would not give it up if I could. But you are tired and ill.
Let me show you to your room."</p>

<p>Leslie, whose temples were throbbing violently, and who felt
unusually languid, went to bed. He felt rather ashamed of his
weakness, and resolved manfully that he would pull himself together
in the morning, and shake the feeling off.</p>

<p>But in the morning he found that this was not an easy matter,
for he was more languid than ever, and his head was aching more
than before. On Monday he was still worse. His tongue was dry and
crusted, and his face flushed. His eyes looked heavy and dull, and
his lassitude increased. Nell watched him anxiously and, on
Tuesday, when he could scarcely lift his head, she insisted on
calling in a doctor to see him.</p>

<p>When the doctor came he shook his head gravely, ordered Leslie
to bed at once, and told Mr. Meredith confidentially that he feared
Leslie was sickening for typhoid fever. The parson whistled, and
put his hands into his pockets. He had three and sixpence there. It
was all the money he had in the world, and he did not rightly know
where the next was coming from, but he jingled it merrily and told
the doctor that God was good, and that Leslie should want for
nothing.</p>

<p>"What a good job," he remarked to his wife when the doctor had
gone, "that we have not sold Daisy. The doctor says that he must
have nothing but milk."</p>

<p>Glancing at his watch, he said that he would run over to the
Post Office for the mail. In going there, he had to walk the entire
length of the township. It was not far, only a few hundred yards,
but he passed Mr. Pogson's store, the bank, the mill, the School of
Arts, and the blacksmith's shop, and then he had to cross the
bridge over the Lachlan. In crossing the bridge, he met George
Sterling.</p>

<p>"Good day, Mr. Meredith," said sterling, as he pulled up his
horse, and, dropping the bridle rein upon its neck, he began to mop
his red face with his handkerchief. "By gosh! it's warm!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Meredith, "rather sultry. And how is Mr.
Sterling to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Pretty so so," said Sterling. "Not so bad for an old 'un. I
had a touch of lumbago last week, but it's better now."</p>

<p>Then, leaning over his horse's head, and speaking
confidentially, he said, "This is a bad business about the
Bindawalla estate. By gum! I don't know what could have come over
old Raymond. What's the boy and gal goin' to do now? I hear they
are stayin' down at your place!"</p>

<p>Meredith said it was a fact, and then he told Sterling about
Leslie having been taken sick, and that the doctor thought he had
typhoid fever.</p>

<p>"Is that so, now?" said Sterling. "Well, I'm derned sorry, and
that's a fact. But you can't keep him there. He may be ill for a
long time, and he'll want careful nursing."</p>

<p>"I think we can manage," said Meredith. "I have some knowledge
of medicine, Mrs. Meredith is a capital nurse, and his sister is
devoted to him."</p>

<p>"But it'll be derned expensive to you," said Sterling.</p>

<p>The parson smiled and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"The Lord has placed him in my hands, Sterling," he said, "He
will find a way."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sterling, after meditating a few moments, "I
believe in the Lord as much as any man. But, if I was you, I
wouldn't leave it all to the Lord."</p>

<p>"For the present," said Meredith, "I have very little
alternative," and he slowly jingled the three and sixpence in his
pocket.</p>

<p>George Sterling stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Can you tell
me," he presently said, "what a harmoner is?"</p>

<p>"A harmoner?" repeated Meredith. "No, I haven't the slightest
idea."</p>

<p>"I think she said harmoner," Sterling said, feeling in his coat
pocket. "I've got the letter here somewheres. Here it is, you can
read it if you like, there ain't no secrets in it. It's from my
Rube. Lor' sakes! She's havin' high old times in England! Dinin'
with lords, dooks, herls, markises, and things. I knew she'd shake
things up when she got there. She knocked the Prince o' Wales clean
back with her singin'. Well, she writes to me, and she sends some
presents for her Ma, and Madge, and me; and she encloses fifty
pounds! Only fancy! Fifty pounds, and says she wants it distributed
in benevolence about Eugowra, and I'm to be her harmoner."</p>

<p>"I see," said Meredith, "she says here that she wants you to act
as almoner."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sterling, "that's it." Taking back the letter from
Mr. Meredith, he added, "Now the question is, what does she mean by
harmoner?"</p>

<p>"She means," explained Meredith, "that the money is to be spent
in some benevolent object or objects, and that you are to choose
the objects."</p>

<p>"That I can do as I like with it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so long as the object is a benevolent one."</p>

<p>"You're sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then," said Sterling, putting his hand in his pocket, producing
a roll of bank-notes, and selecting one, "I'll get you to help me.
Take this tenner and spend it in looking after young Raymond. When
it's gone, if you want any more, see me. Don't tell anybody where
you got it, and if anybody asks, say the Lord sent it. See? Good
day. I'll be in again next week, and I'll see you then. So long,"
and he picked up the reins, and jogged on.</p>

<p>The parson watched him as he jogged away, until he disappeared
round the turn near the blacksmith's shop, feeling so dazed that he
would have thought the whole affair a dream if it had not been for
the convincing evidence to the contrary which he held in his hand
in the shape of a crisp ten pound note.</p>

<p>He went to the Post Office and got the mails, and then returned
home. But who could describe the lightness of his spirit as he
passed the mill, and the School of Arts, and Mr. Pogson's
store?</p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith must have thought there was something unusual in
the sharp click of the gate, as he let it close behind him, for she
came to the open door to meet him.</p>

<p>"Look, my dear," said he, as he flourished the banknote before
her wondering eyes, "look, we are rich. The Lord has provided."</p>

<p>All that day and the next Leslie tossed upon his bed, fretting
at his inability to get up and out. He had never been laid up with
sickness in his life before, and the enforced idleness was, to him,
well nigh intolerable. Yet he knew that he was really not able to
rise, for his head seemed to be splitting in two, and he felt very
low and languid. And all that night and the next he turned
restlessly upon his pillow, and although he complained of feeling
very tired, he could not sleep.</p>

<p>On the Thursday morning Nell put her cool hand upon his
throbbing temples, and asked him how he felt.</p>

<p>"I feel very bad, Nell," he said, "I have not slept all night,
and my strength seems ebbing away. What can it be. Do you think I
am going to die?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear," said Nell. "You will be all right by-and-bye, but
you are going to be very sick, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Nell," he said, "what day is this?"</p>

<p>"This is Thursday," she told him, "the seventh of December."</p>

<p>"And what is the time?"</p>

<p>"It is about eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh! Nell, I feel so tired, and yet I cannot sleep. All night I
have been lying awake, and yet I have been dreaming, dreaming of
what might have been. Nell, don't think me foolish, I cannot help
it. I have been thinking of her, the whole long night through. Her
spirit seemed to be hovering round the room, and I seemed to see
her face, as plainly as I see yours now. I can't help it, Nell. Her
image pervades my soul."</p>

<p>Nell spoke soothingly to him, smoothed his pillow, and arranged
his coverlet, which he was continually tossing aside. Presently he
closed his eyes, and Nell slipped noiselessly away to help Mrs.
Meredith.</p>

<p>But Leslie was not asleep. He lay very still for a time, and
then moaned painfully, and passionate words broke from his
lips.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ruby," he said. "My love, my life! Why did you leave me? I
was prepared to give my life for you. Why did' you go out of it?
Come to me once again. You promised to come if I called you, and I
am calling now, with all my heart, and with all my soul! If there
is any power in your wonderful instinct, come, and let your bright
eyes shine on me once more. If your spirit is in tune with mine,
let it respond, and breaking down all barriers, let it come to me,
and let me feel your presence. Come, and save me from death, or a
life which is worse than death. Ruby, dear love, light of my soul,
come to me!"</p>

<p>For a moment he stretched out his arms, and smiled faintly, and
then they fell listlessly to the bed. When Nell entered the room a
few minutes later Leslie was asleep. It was well that she was still
by his side when he awoke, for he announced his intention of
getting up at once. His face was flushed, and his eyes seemed to
have lost their expression, and Nell soon discovered that he was
wandering in his mind. He said he had to go down to the woolshed,
and spoke incoherently of his father and Mr. Pogson.</p>

<p>From that time he had to be watched night and day. From five in
the morning until eleven at night, Nell and Mrs. Meredith
alternately took it in turns to watch the sick man and work about
the house. The parson used to take the night watch, from eleven
until five, because, as he truly remarked, he could get away to his
stretcher in the lumber room, and snatch a few hours' sleep in the
day time. Except attending to his other sick calls in the district,
preaching and travelling on a Sunday, and attending to the usual
number of his parishioners who came to him for the straightening
out of their personal and private grievances, he had in the day
time nothing to do but sleep, and run the errands!</p>

<p>Mr. Sterling was as good as his word, and called on the
Merediths the next time he came to Eugowra. He had the spring cart
with him this time, and, after inquiring about the patient, he
said:</p>

<p>"I have brought in a few little things from Mrs. Sterling. She
thought he might want a little extry nourishment. Here's a couple
of dressed fowls, a box of eggs, a few pounds of butter, and some
bottles of quince jelly. She thought he might like 'em."</p>

<p>"But he is not allowed to take anything but milk," said the
parson.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Sterling. "Snakes alive! I might have brought
a cow!"</p>

<p>"We have Daisy," said Meredith. "She gives us plenty of
milk."</p>

<p>"Oh! well," said Sterling, "I must leave the things. If the
patient can't eat 'em, the nusses must."</p>

<p>"What is the latest news from Old Joe's Flat?" inquired
Meredith.</p>

<p>"Nothin' startlin'," said Sterling. "The only news out our way
is from Bindawalla. The storekeeper's left. Two of the boundary
riders are leavin' next week and the Chinaman's talkin' of goin'
too. Say they can't rekernise Bindawalla now Pogson's taken
possession."</p>

<p>"Is he living there?" asked Meredith.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly," said Sterling. "He goes out for a few days at
a time. Just to feel his feet like. Well, you'll let me know if you
want anything, won't you?" Then, clicking to his horse, he added,
"Well, so long!"</p>

<p>He drove off down the street, and left the parson to carry in
the fowls, the eggs, the butter, and the quince jelly, as well as a
couple of cases of fruit, and sundry other parcels which George
Sterling had not thought it necessary to mention in detail.</p>

<p>When they were all carried in and Mrs. Meredith had examined
them, her gratitude, as well as her husband's, was unbounded. It
was doubtful whether their larder had ever been so well
stocked.</p>

<p>Now, the parson, in spite of his habits of self-denial, had,
like all men, one or two little weaknesses. Perhaps the most
pronounced of these was one which had been bred in him as a child,
which had clung to him through his youth and manhood, and seemed to
grow with age. This was a weakness for home-made pork sausages, and
when Mrs. Meredith opened one of the mysterious parcels that had
not been described, and her husband saw that it contained about
four pounds of beautiful pork sausages, made in Mrs. Sterling's
best style, he exclaimed gleefully: "My dear, the Lord is very
good. Let us be thankful to Him. We must have some of these for
tea! How long will it be until tea time?"</p>

<p>Then, taking off his coat, and picking up the milk-bucket, the
parson went away to milk the cow, whistling cheerfully as he
went.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22. RUBY SINGS BEFORE THE
QUEEN.</h2>

<p>Wednesday, December the sixth, 189- was a memorable day in the
life of Ruby Sterling, for on that day the dream of her life was to
be realised.</p>

<p>There was to be a concert at Buckingham Palace in the evening,
and Ruby had been commanded to sing before the Queen.</p>

<p>The day was bright and frosty, but Ruby did not mind tho keen
air, so long as there was no fog. She wanted to be in her very best
voice that night, and a fog might have interfered with it. So she
was pleased as she sat in her snug sitting-room at, the Grand
Hotel, Charing Cross, and watched the ceaseless traffic in the
street below. From where she sat she could see Nelson's monument
and Landseer's lions at the foot of it. She could see the
fountains, and the front of the National Gallery. She was
intolerably familiar with all these places now, for she had spent
all her spare time during the past few months visiting the places
of interest in the wonderful world of London.</p>

<p>Her face was aglow, for she had but recently returned from a
drive in the Park, where she had been admiring the fine equipages,
and the noble squires and dames who occupied then. But what she
admired most of all, if the truth must be told, were the horses.
She was passionately fond of horses, and if she could have been
allowed to mount one of the many beautiful animals she saw, and
gallop away through the Park at her own pace, taking the fences as
she went, she would have been happy. Her mind always went back to
Old Joe's Flat when she watched the horses, and she never saw a
horse she admired without thinking of Bunyip. She adopted him as a
standard of comparison. This horse was a beauty, and he was just as
nearly as possible the colour of Bunyip; that one was much darker
than Bunyip, and the other was not the same colour at all, he was a
chestnut, while Bunyip was a bay.</p>

<p>From comparing the horses to Bunyip it was only a short stage to
go to compare their riders with Bunyip's master, and so it happened
that on this particular day her mind had been drawn by a kind of
strange fascination to Old Joe's Flat, and to Leslie Raymond. She
wondered what the folks at Bindawalla would say when the cable
flashed them the news that she had sung before the Queen! She
wondered what they were all doing now. Was Leslie practising Bunyip
over the fences, or what? It was bright warm summer weather now at
Old Joe's Flat. How she would enjoy a swing under the willows! Then
she remembered what she had forgotten before, that the time at
Bindawalla was different to the time in London. The lamps were
already lit in the streets, the lights were twinkling as far as she
could see. It was four o'clock. Why, it was already half-past two
in the morning at Bindawalla! Half-past two to-morrow morning! How
strange it seemed. If she had stayed at Old Joe's Flat, she would
have been ten and a half hours older than she was now, and yet, how
much was to happen during the next ten and a half hours! She was to
sing before the Queen! As the attendant came to turn up the lights,
she was just breathing a fervent prayer for all those at home, and
especially for the one whose image had haunted her the whole day
through, the young master of Bindawalla. She little thought that,
while she prayed, he was tossing upon the pillow passing a
sleepless night, and, with her spirit hovering round him, was
dreaming waking dreams of what might have been.</p>

<p>The splendid concert room at Buckingham Palace had never been
filled with a more brilliant audience than the one which assembled
there that evening. Men and women were gathered there whose names
were familiar wherever the English language was spoken, or read.
Among than were some who bore names which had been familiar for
ages to every student of English history, and others, who by their
services to the Empire, had made comparatively new names
famous.</p>

<p>And the centre of all attraction was the little widow lady,
whose name, for more than half a century, had been the mightiest
name on earth. She was surrounded by her brilliant Court, and
several members of the Royal family, and was dressed in her usual
sombre tints.</p>

<p>Herr Batonstein had been in a state of ferment for some days
past, which state reached its zenith as the time drew near for
Ruby's appearance at the Palace. As he drove with her there he
implored her not to be nervous.</p>

<p>"Be calm to-night, my dear," he said, his own voice shaking, "and
your fortune will be made. Only think of it! What did I say long
ago! Think of the honour! Only four months out, and to sing before
the Queen&mdash;by command. For Heavens' sake, be calm! Sing as you
can sing, and your fortune will be made!"</p>

<p>"Don't be nervous yourself," said Ruby, smiling, "I am as calm
to-night as if I were swinging on my old willow bough at home.
Perhaps I ought to feel nervous, but to tell you the truth, I
don't. I know I am in good voice, I fell that I shall do you
justice to-night, and something seems to tell me that I shall put
my soul into my song, and sing as I never sung before. My life's
ambition is about to be realized, and I must sing to-night, if I
never sing again!"</p>

<p>Her words were true, for when she faced the brilliant audience
she might, for all the emotion she evinced, have been a beautiful
automaton. And when she sang, her soul <i>was</i> in her song, and
many a noble lord and courtly dame, who imagined, that by culture
and fine manners they had killed all such vulgar things as human
feelings and emotions, felt their hearts thrill, as they listened,
with vague longings they had never felt before.</p>

<p>Ruby's highest ambition was realized. She had sung before the
Queen and when she retired to the waiting-room allotted to the
artists, she laughed merrily at Herr Batonstein, who was far more
nervous than she. She was soon the centre of a group, and the
recipient of numerous congratulations. She was, in the moment of
her triumph, supremely happy, and received her praise with girlish
delight. In the midst of her rejoicing, she was approached by a
courtly gentleman in Windsor uniform. He was the son of a duke, the
descendant of a score of dukes, and was himself heir to a dukedom
and the other members of the group fell back at his approach. He
was the bearer of a message from the Queen to Ruby; Her Majesty
wished to convey through him the intimation that she had been
delighted with Miss Sterling's singing. Her Majesty had further
commended him to say that it was Her Majesty's wish that, at the
conclusion of the concert, Miss Sterling should be presented to Her
Majesty, when Her Majesty would doubtless take the opportunity to
personally congratulate Miss Sterling.</p>

<p>When the descendant of twenty dukes had delivered his message,
he bowed stiffly, and waited for a reply. But no reply came. Every
eye in the brilliantly lighted room was fixed upon Ruby.</p>

<p>Prom the adjacent concert hall came the sounds of sweet music,
as a violinist, reputed to be the most accomplished in the world,
charmed the audience with the magic of his genius. But Ruby was
apparently oblivious to all.</p>

<p>She stood, with one hand on her forehead, and the other pressed
tightly upon her heart, as motionless as a statue. Her eyes were
fixed in a steady stare upon a painting which adorned the wall of
the apartment. It was Sir Joshua Reynolds picture of "Cymon and
Iphigenia," but it was evident that she was not looking at the
picture, but <i>through</i> it, for she looked like one who gazed
upon a far off object. She seemed, also, to be listening intently,
and yet she paid no heed to the words which Herr Batonstein
addressed to her.</p>

<p>He lunched her lightly on the arm.</p>

<p>"Ruby," he said, "did not you hear what his Lordship said to
you? He brings a message from the Queen."</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered as, dropping her hand from her forehead,
she clutched him convulsively by the wrist, "Hush! Hush!"</p>

<p>Without another word, Herr Batonstein gently led her to a settee
close at hand, upon which she sank; and then placed her two hands
tightly upon her eyes, as though to shut out all her
surroundings.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked his Lordship. "Has the lady
fainted?"</p>

<p>Herr Batonstein stood by Ruby's side, with his hand stretched
over her head in an imploring manner towards the startled
group.</p>

<p>"Your Lordship and ladies," he whispered tremulously. "Please to
take no notice, and make no noise nor fuss. She is a strange girl.
She sometimes sees strange things, and when she does she must not
be touched nor spoken to. If you break the spell, you may break her
reason with it, so please hush, for two&mdash;three&mdash;minutes.
Then she will be as right as ninepence. Hush."</p>

<p>For about three minutes, which seemed an age, no one spoke nor
moved. The professor still stood, looking like a guardian angel in
spectacles, with his arm extended over Ruby's head, and the rest of
the company looked on in a state of breathless excitement. A
massive ormolu clock, which stood upon the mantel, chimed the half
hour. Half-past nine! As its silvery tones echoed strangely loud
through the apartment, Ruby dropped her hands. The professor,
bending down, caught the words, which seemed like the merest echo
of Ruby's voice, "I hear you."</p>

<p>Then she started to her feet, glanced quickly round at the
assembled faces watching her curiously, and grasped the professor
by the arm.</p>

<p>"Take me home," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But, my dear&mdash;'" began the professor.</p>

<p>"Take me home," she repeated, firmly.</p>

<p>"But his Lordship has a message&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take me home," she commanded, imperiously. "I have sung my
songs. Take me home at once. Do you hear? At once!"</p>

<p>"Take her home," said his Lordship, "take her home. She is
excited. Poor girl, the strain has unnerved her. Take her
home."</p>

<p>Summoning one of the royal attendants he bade him take Ruby and
her guardian to their carriage, and they drove away along Birdcage
Walk, and past the Horse Guards, and Whitehall, to their hotel at
Charing Cross.</p>

<p>Herr Batonstein was terribly upset by this unlooked for
termination of Ruby's triumph.</p>

<p>"Oh! My dear girl," he said, as the carriage sped on its way,
and the twinkling lights flew by, "I am so sorry. You have spoiled
it all. And it vas so grand! So magnificent! Und you would not
listen to a message from your Queen, your beloved Queen."</p>

<p>There were actually tears of disappointment in the professor's
eyes, and his pupil's hand crept into his.</p>

<p>"I could not listen," she whispered, "<i>I could not!</i> I was
listening to a message from my <i>King!</i>"</p>

<p>She spoke no more until she arrived at the hotel, and then only
to bid good-night to the professor and Mrs. Batonstein, who was
waiting for the news. Leaving Herr Batonstein to enlighten her,
Ruby retired to her room.</p>

<p>The next morning a thick fog hung over the great metropolis.
Nothing was to be seen from the windows of the hotel but a dense
brown mist, which seemed almost solid in its density.</p>

<p>Herr Batonstein was surprised, on entering the breakfast-room,
in which lights were burning, to see Ruby already there, gazing
dreamily into the fire.</p>

<p>"Why did you get up so early?" said he. "You ought to have
rested after your excitement last night. But see, I have the
morning papers. They are praising your singing again, und singing
your praises. Eh? That vas not bad, eh?"</p>

<p>But Ruby was in no humour for the papers. She had been studying
Bradshaw's guide.</p>

<p>She stood up as he approached the fire, and running her fingers
through his long hair, she said, "Professor, I am going to give you
a great shock."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" said he. "What vas the matter now? I haf not got
over your last shock yet."</p>

<p>"I am going back to Australia," said Ruby, quietly.</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Batonstein, staring at her in blank
astonishment. "Ach!! The girl vas mad. Go to bed again, my dear
child, und I vill send Mrs. Batonstein to talk to you. You haf not
slept well."</p>

<p>"I have slept my last sleep in London," said Ruby. "I am going
back to Australia."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, it is impossible! You haf to sing tomorrow night
at Exeter Hall, and next Monday at Park Lane. Then later on at
Manchester, und in Christmas week in the Messiah at the Crystal
Palace. Und, only this morning, I haf a letter offering twenty
thousand pounds for a six months' tour in the United States. It is,
I say, impossible."</p>

<p>"Professor, I shall sing at none of those places. I am going
back to Australia."</p>

<p>"But," said Batonstein, losing his temper, "this is monstrous.
This is absurd. This is vat I call dam foolish!"</p>

<p>"There is a train leaves Charing Cross to-night for the
Continent, which will enable us to catch the <i>Himalaya</i> at
Marseilles," she told him.</p>

<p>"You shall not go. Und I will not go. I will not stir a foot,"
he protested, angrily.</p>

<p>"If you don't come, professor, I will go by myself. I am called,
and I MUST go. Don't think me unkind nor ungrateful. But my mind is
made up. You must cancel all my engagements. I start for Australia
to-night."</p>

<p>The professor argued, stormed, swore, and even wept, but all to
no purpose. Mrs. Batonstein added her persuasion to his, but Ruby
was inflexible:</p>

<p>"I am' going back to Australia," was the only answer they could
get to all their arguments. The professor tried to reason with
her.</p>

<p>"It is your good I am anxious for," he said. "Now, listen to me
for one little minute. Let me show you what you are sacrificing.
Your name is now known. For the past four months, you haf make a
hundred pounds per week, and you can go on, and increase that.
There are twenty thousand pounds awaiting for you in America. In a
few years you could buy a castle, and marry a duke!"</p>

<p>Ruby listened quietly, and, when he had finished, she smiled and
asked, "Is that all, professor?"</p>

<p>"GOdd Gott!" he exclaimed, "is not that enough?"</p>

<p>"Well, professor," said she, "I will put all your arguments into
the scale. Now see! Here they go," and she held up one hand, and
pretended to be filling it with the other. "See!! Into this hand I
put your hundred pounds per week, then your twenty thousand pounds.
Then in goes the castle&mdash;that weighs heavy. Next comes your
duke and down goes the scales. But look! Into the other scale there
climbs a little mischievous naked boy, and up goes the duke, and
the castle, and all the money. The little naked boy outbalances
then all!"</p>

<p>"Great Heavens!" said Herr Batonstein, "if there vas anything
under the sun that vas balmy, that vas absurd and illogical, that
vas dam stark staring mad, it vas a woman in love!"</p>

<p>But the professor found that, if Ruby was mad, she had method in
it, and all day he had to drive about in the fog, cancelling
engagements, and compromising threatened actions at law, swearing,
puffing, and groaning, and when at night he bundled his wife and
Ruby into the Continental mail train at Charing Cross Station, and,
hungry and dishevelled, flung himself in after them, he declared
that they were ruined. That of all the money Ruby had earned,
scarcely two hundred pounds would remain when their passages were
paid to Sydney.</p>

<p>"You may keep that for yourself," said Ruby.</p>

<p>"Ruby," said he, "you vas not mean to be unkind, but you are. Do
you think I am a fraud. Do you think I grieve for mineself? It is
you I am thinking of. I am satisfied for myself. I haf given to the
world the sweetest singer it has ever heard, but you haf lost all
the reward that you might haf had. You have dashed your brightest
hopes to the ground."</p>

<p>"What are a woman's brightest hopes!" asked Ruby, but the
professor was sullen, and would not reply.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Batonstein, she did not seem at all sorry to be
going hack to Sydney, and attempted to console the professor.</p>

<p>"Pappy," said she, "perhaps it's all for the best, as Tim
Rafferty said whin the cow put her foot in the milk pail. Sure, I
can't be sorry that we're goin' back to Sydney. We'll get out of
this bastely fog. I'm sick of jerrymanderin' round the wurruld, wid
no place of one's own to rest the sole of one's fut. I could never
take kindly to the cookin' in the big hotels, where they niver put
saysonin' enough in the food. Me heart's yearnin' for me home, so
it is, and it's mighty thankful I'll be to be able to sit down, wid
me fate on me own carpet, and to feel that the roof that shelthers
me is me own fireside, so I will."</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23. HOME AGAIN TO SUNNY
NEW SOUTH WALES.</h2>

<p>Christmas at Eugowra saw Leslie Raymond still hovering between
life and death. Christmas was no holiday for the parson; it
increased his duties, yet his voice had a cheery ring as he
reminded his hearers of the message of Peace and Goodwill towards
men.</p>

<p>The heat showed no signs of diminishing, and the drought
continued. On his bed of sickness, Leslie moaned and groaned. He
was wasted to a skeleton, and was very weak and low. Still, the
doctor did not give up all hope. He shook his head gravely, but he
spoke of the sick man's splendid constitution, and said that the
nursing was all that could be desired.</p>

<p>"And after all," he added, "the whole case depends upon the
nursing."</p>

<p>The days wore on. The New Year came and went, and the doctor
grew more hopeful. He said that the crisis had passed, and that
with care the patient might pull through. Each day would probably
see an improvement, although, to prevent a relapse, greater care
than ever was necessary.</p>

<p>One night&mdash;it was the end of the first week in
January&mdash;the parson kept his lonely vigil by Leslie's side.
The heat was more than usually oppressive and, although the windows
were wide open, not a breath disturbed the muslin curtains that
hung within them.</p>

<p>It was about two o'clock in the morning, and the parson was
thinking, as he sat, of the terrible drought, and wondering what
would become of the sheep and stock if rain did not soon fall.</p>

<p>From all parts of the country came the same news, not a blade of
grass, and stock dying by thousands. Farmers and squatters alike
saw nothing but ruin staring them in the face. Sheep were a drug
upon the market. Everybody wanted to sell, and nobody wanted to
buy, because although, owing to the losses by death and disease,
all the stations had less than their normal stock, still they had
no food for those that were left.</p>

<p>The parson was thinking of all these things when he heard a
distant rumbling noise. He listened for a moment and thought it
must be a vehicle crossing the wooden bridge. Another rumble! Yes,
it must be some benighted wayfarer. Still another, louder than
before, and then, pat-pat on the galvanised roof of the cottage. He
listened again. Yes, there it was, only faster, pat-pat-pat. It
must be rain!</p>

<p>He rushed out into the garden, and could hear it falling gently
everywhere. He turned his face up to the murky sky, and let the
blessed drops fall upon it. He opened his mouth to catch the
moisture, he drew a long breath to inhale the perfume which rose in
thankfulness from the parched earth. And then he went softly to the
door of his wife's room, where she and Nell were both asleep, and
although he knew that they were tired and weary, and nodded sleep,
he could not resist the temptation to rouse them from their
slumbers, and to bid them listen to the welcome sound of the
blessed rain.</p>

<p>All through the remainder of the night he revelled in the sound,
and kept walking in and out to make sure that it was not a mere
passing shower. And when the morning broke, and he saw that the sky
was grey and moist, and noted that what little wind there was blew
from the southwest, and that the rain was still falling steadily
upon the now moist earth, he lifted up his voice in thankfulness to
God that it was so.</p>

<p>For nearly a week the life-giving moisture descended and the
greedy earth swallowed it. Creeks that had long been dry commenced
to run again, damns were full to overflowing, and Jimmy Green, who
had for months been driving a lucrative trade in carting water from
the Lachlan to fill the tanks at the houses round the town, sat
smoking idly in the blacksmith's shop, for all the tanks were
running over, sad Jimmy's occupation was gone.</p>

<p>The rain fell not only at Eugowra, but all over the colony, and
strangers, as they met on the road, laughed gleefully as they shook
the moisture from their hats and congratulated each other upon the
fact that the drought had broken up.</p>

<p>In a few days the brown face of the earth assumed an emerald
tint, and in the towns out West, the principal inhabitants met, and
in accordance with time honoured custom, they cracked bottles of
champagne, and drank joyfully to Jupiter Pluvius.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson, being still the president of the Eugowra Temperance
Society, did not drink champagne but he rubbed his hands gleefully
as he gazed from the window of the late Mr. James Raymond's office
at Bindawalla&mdash;now Mr. Pogson's office&mdash;for he could
literally see the grass grow. Sheep had gone up in value in a week
by five shillings per head and as the stations were all
understocked, there were buyers in plenty, but nobody wanted to
sell. Mr. Pogson had made a calculation, and he found that the
increase in value on a hundred and fifty thousand sheep would
amount to a sum sufficient to pay off all the liabilities on the
Bindawalla estate, and leave a nice little margin to spare. So Mr.
Pogson pursed his lips, and rubbed his hands gleefully.</p>

<p>He had been debating a certain point in in his mind, and had
arrived at a conclusion satisfactory to himself. He had been, for
the past month, valuing the Bindawalla property and the liabilities
connected with it, so that he would be able to apply for probate of
the will. He had valued the property before the rain came, and had
put the sheep down at four shillings per head. He could now sell
them, if he were so disposed, at ton shillings per head.</p>

<p>The question that had been agitating him was this. Would the
Government accept probate duty on the smaller valuation, or require
it to be paid upon the larger? Upon this point he had consulted his
solicitor, and that gentleman had advised him that the valuation
must be based on the value at the time of Mr. Raymond's death. The
difference in the duty would amount to quite a large cheque and so
Mr. Pogson was gratified, and he made up his mind that as soon as
the weather got settled, he would go to Sydney and make the
necessary arrangements to prove the will.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Pogson was, at this time, residing at Bindawalla,
Mrs. Pogson remained at the store at Eugowra. She bad evinced no
wish to change her residence, and her husband had remarked that it
would be time enough after he had been to Sydney and obtained
probate of the will. But first he had several matters to attend to
at Eugowra, in connection with the financial institution of which
he was the agent.</p>

<p>Before his departure from Bindawalla he sent for such of the
station hands as were within easy access, and gave them
instructions as to what they were to do during his absence. He set
to each man an allotted task, and gave them all plainly to
understand that he would expect to find upon his return that the
work was done.</p>

<p>He intimated, in unmistakable language, that a new regime for
Bindawalla was to be inaugurated, and told them that, from this
time forth, they were paid to work, and not to loaf, as they had
done during the tenure of the late owner.</p>

<p>This being done, he collected his luggage, which consisted of a
spare shirt and an umbrella, and ordered the groom to put the
horses in the trap and drive him in to Eugowra.</p>

<p>In driving to Eugowra Mr. Pogson followed the shortest road, and
this was the track that passed through Old Joe's Flat. He noticed
that the farmer's buggy, with the horse ready harnessed, was at the
gate. He told the groom to pull up, just as Mrs. Sterling, hearing
the sound of wheels, came out, and he accepted her invitation to
step indoors and have a cup of tea.</p>

<p>He found George Sterling in the sitting-room, partaking of a cup
of tea and some bread and butter, and he noticed that Sterling was
dressed in his Sunday suit, and wore a stiff shirt and collar. It
was also obvious that he had been shaving himself, although it was
the middle of the week.</p>

<p>"Good day, Mr. Sterling," said Pogson, "We have had some
magnificent rain."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sterling, speaking with his mouth full. "Sit down
and have a cup of tea."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Pogson, "I will." Then, in reply to Mrs.
Sterling, he added, "Sugar and milk, if you please. Thank you. Are
you going on a journey, Mr. Sterling?"</p>

<p>"Why, Yes," said Sterling. "I've 'got to. It's rather
inconvenient just now, because I wanted to get a lot of briars out
while the ground was soft, but I guess they'll have to wait. I've
got to go into Eugowra to meet my gal."</p>

<p>"What girl?" asked Pogson.</p>

<p>"Why, my Rube. Her that's been singing before the Queen, and
takin' the shine out of 'em all in the old country."</p>

<p>"What? Is she coming back?" said Pogson, in surprise. "I thought
she was going to stay for a long time."</p>

<p>"Well, for the matter of that," admitted Sterling, wiping the
crumbs from his whiskers with his coat sleeve, "so did I. But I got
a telegram yesterday from Adelaide. Quite a long 'un. It must have
cost three or four shillings to send it. This is it," and adjusting
his spectacles, he read it.</p>

<p>"<i>'Adelaide, Monday. Just landed from the Himalaya. Leave here
to-night. Coming by train, via Melbourne, Albury, and Murrumburrah,
to Cowra. Will drive from there, via Goolagong, to Eugowra. Meet me
Wednesday afternoon. Ruby.'</i></p>

<p>"That's all. Not another blessed word. The last letter she
wrote, she was talking of singin' before the Queen. Then we seen by
the papers that she had sung before the Queen. Then another cable
message said that after singin' before the Queen she was
indisposed, and that, after cancelling all engagements, she had
started for the Continent. Now, she pops up suddenly at Adelaide.
Blest if I can understand it. Mr. Meredith drove out with the
telegram, which was kind on him, and he can't understand it. It's a
blinded mystery. That's what it is. I say, Ria, did you put that
cream into the buggy, and the turkeys and the bacon? That's right,
I'm takin' in a few things for young Raymond. He cone to his senses
yesterday mornin', and I suppose he'll be able to peck a bit. He'll
want somethin' to make up for lost time. He's as thin as a whippin'
post."</p>

<p>"I think," said Pogson, "that indiscriminate charity is a
mistake. When people have been stuck up, and snappy, they ought to
be taught a lesson; and be made to feel the full weight of their
trials and tribulations."</p>

<p>"If I comes across anybody sufferin' from the weight of trials
or tribulations," said Sterling, "I tries to ease a bit of the
weight off of 'em, if I can. And it don't seem to make my load no
heavier, neither."</p>

<p>"But," said Pogson, waving his hand, and growing virtuously
eloquent, "I call it sacrilege. When tribulations come to proud and
snappy individuals it is merely the chastening hand of the
Almighty. If the Almighty drops his chastening hand heavy on an
individual whom he wishes to chasten, what right have you to
interfere with the will of the Almighty by trying to soften the
blow? It is sacrilege, Mr. Sterling! sacrilege!!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Sterling, unabashed, "when I see a pusson in
trouble I tries to get 'em out fust, and mebbe I asks 'em how they
got there afterwards, mebbe I don't. It was only last Monday I seed
a cow bogged in the creek. It was too weak to get itself out, so I
spent half a day, and spoilt a suit of clothes a-getting of it out.
But I did it, and it wasn't my cow, neither. Some people might
argufy that the Almighty put her into the bog. I don't know how she
got in, and I don't care a damn. I got her out. Them's my lights,
Mr. Pogson, and if it's all the same to you, I'll go on afollerin'
of 'em. Ria! Did you see my pipe? Oh! It's all right. Its in my
mouth."</p>

<p>He cut up some tobacco and filled his pipe, and Mr. Pogson,
having finished his tea, put his hand over his eyes and said grace
in an undertone, after which he departed for Eugowra, leaving
Sterling to jog along after him.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Eugowra Mr. Sterling drove straight to the
rectory, and delivered his parcels. He found Mr. Meredith at home,
and as the coach from Goolagong would pass that way, he accepted
the parson's invitation to put the horse in his stable.</p>

<p>He was glad to hear that Leslie was progressing satisfactorily,
and that he had passed a good night. It wanted an hour to the time
when the coach would be due; and, as the roads were heavy after the
late rains, there was every probability of it being late. Sterling
was just telling Mr. Meredith that he would take a walk up the
street, and be back in time for the coach, when, to his surprise,
he heard the the loud cracking of the coachman's whip, and the
vehicle itself, came into view.</p>

<p>"By Gosh! She's early," said Sterling, looking at his watch and,
waving his hand to the coachman, he made dart for the gate, where
he arrived as the driver pulled up his steaming team in front of
it.</p>

<p>"You're early, Jim," said Sterling to the man, as he opened the
gate.</p>

<p>"Broke the record, Mr. Sterling," said Jim, proudly. But just
then Ruby, having caught sight of her father, leapt from the coach.
In a moment, she had her two arms round his neck, and was hugging
and kissing him to such an extent that George Sterling literally
gasped for breath. When, at length, she released him, and he was
able to look at her at arms' length, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well! By gosh, Rube, I wouldn't ha' knowed you. Why, you've
growed into the finest, handsomest woman I ever seen. No wonder you
had hearls and things a-runnin' arter you. And what brought you
back so soon? Did you come to run away from the hearls, or did you
bring one with you? And where's the Batonsteins?"</p>

<p>"Faith!" said a voice from the interior of the coach, "the
Batonsteins are not far away, all that's left of them, and that's
not much! I'd get out and shake hands with you, but the coach has
shook me up that way that I don't know which side of me is up and
which is down. Every bone in me body's a jelly, and me arms are
that stiff, I don't belave I'll be able to put me fut to the
ground. Sure, it's a wreck I am; wid a crushed hat, and a red nose,
and the two best feathers gone out of it, and me hair shuk up that
way that it's all fallin' down!"</p>

<p>"And where is Mr. Batonstein?" asked Sterling, as he presented
his smiling red face at the back of the coach.</p>

<p>"Ah! He's here, so he is," said Mrs. Batonstein, speaking with
some difficulty, for her mouth was full of hairpins, "here he is,
where he fell last, between the seats, with two portmantles and a
mail-bag on top of him, Pappy, get up out of that. Here's Mr.
Sterling inquiring afther you."</p>

<p>There was a movement among the luggage and mail-bags, and at
length the professor struggled to a sitting posture, and presented
to George Sterling a haggard face, with unkempt hair, spectacles
awry, and a portion of a very-much-crumpled shirt front.</p>

<p>"Vas that you, Mr. Sterling?" he muttered, "und vas this
Eugowra?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sterling as he reached into the coach and removed
some of the luggage from the top of Herr Batonstein.</p>

<p>"Then take your daughter off mine shoulders," said the
professor, with a sigh of relief. "She is a good girl, Sterling, a
very good girl, and I love her as if she vas mine own, but I will
never take her on my shoulders any more. I vill never take another
woman on my shoulders! Travelling is like music. If you want to
enjoy it, you must keep time, not too fast, nor yet too slow. For
the last month, there has not been time for anything. There has not
been a single bar's rest, nor a pause. It has been all allegretto
and staccato."</p>

<p>By this time George Sterling and Ruby had, with much difficulty,
assisted Mrs. Batonstein and her husband from the coach.</p>

<p>"Where's the buggy, Pa?" said Ruby when they had propped Mrs.
Batonstein up against the fence, and the professor had sunk wearily
down on a stone at her side.</p>

<p>"The buggy's in Mr. Meredith's yard here," said Sterling. "I
called here to bring a few little things for Mr. Raymond."</p>

<p>"What Mr. Raymond?" exclaimed Ruby, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why," said her father, "him that's sick. There's only one Mr.
Raymond now, you know, since the other died."</p>

<p>"Died!" repeated Ruby, turning deadly pale, "died? Oh! Pa,
please tell me all about it. You know I have been travelling. I
don't know. Tell me!"</p>

<p>"Well, come and sit down," said Sterling. "You are tired. You
don't look well."</p>

<p>"I am quite well, Pa. We will walk along the road, where it is
quiet. Now, tell me."</p>

<p>She took his arm, and he felt that she was trembling
violently.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said he, "didn't you hear about Mr. Raymond
breaking his neck?"</p>

<p>"No, Pa, I have heard nothing. You forget I have been travelling
Which Mr. Raymond? How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"He was jumpin' a fence, and the horse fell with him, and when
they picked him up his neck was broken. He was as dead as a
doornail."</p>

<p>"<i>Which</i> Mr. Raymond?" cried Ruby. "Oh! Pa, will you never
tell me? Which Mr. Raymond?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I'll tell you," said Sterling, looking at her in
some alarm. "It was old Mr. Raymond."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" ejaculated Ruby.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Sterling, stopping abruptly, and staring at
her in mingled astonishment and alarm. "What's come over the gal?
Thankin' Heaven because a man has broke his neck! Why, Rube, what
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh! You don't know, Pa, you don't understand." said Ruby. "I
was not thanking heaven because Mr. Raymond was killed,
but&mdash;because&mdash;it was not the other Mr. Raymond." and she
buried her face on her father's shoulder and sobbed violently.</p>

<p>George Sterling looked very solemn, and said "Oh!"</p>

<p>What George Sterling thought will probably never be known. His
face bore a stolid expression, which afforded no possible clue to
his thoughts, as he simply said "Oh!" and clasped her
affectionately to him, until her sobbing, subsided. Then he led
her a little farther along the road to a spot where the fence
ceased, and where, near a group of wattles, there was a fallen
tree.</p>

<p>Seating her on the true-trunk, he sat by her side and, in answer
to her inquiries, he told her all.</p>

<p>How James Raymond had died (she had already learned, from Nell's
last letter, that he had lost his reason), how the property had all
been left to Pogson; how Leslie and Nell were homeless and
penniless, and how the parson had invited them to stay with him.
Then came the account of Leslie's sickness and how he had, for over
a month, hovered between life and death, but was now considered to
be practically out of danger.</p>

<p>Then George Sterling commenced to tell her how her mother was,
and how Madge had grown, and what pleasure it would give them both
to see her again. But Ruby had risen to her fret with a suggestion
that they should go back to the Rectory and, going back, she walked
so fast that her father had to put his best foot forward to keep
pace with her.</p>

<p>She was welcomed heartily by the parson and his wife, and
affectionately by Nell and, after a cup of tea, which they found
waiting for them, and which was being shared by the Batonsteins,
who had been rescued and taken charge of by Mr. Meredith, Nell
demurely asked Ruby whether she would like to see Leslie?</p>

<p>The only reply Nell received was a tight squeeze of her hand,
and so she led Ruby to Leslie's room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24. "THE CROOKED SHALL BE
MADE STRAIGHT."</h2>

<p>"You will find him much changed," Nell whispered, sadly, "but he
is better than he was, and he now has his reason, which is such a
blessing."</p>

<p>She went into the room first, leaving Ruby at the door, and a
moment later beckoned her in.</p>

<p>"Here is Miss Sterling, Leslie," said Nell.</p>

<p>Ruby had sunk before the Queen without a tremor. She had
deliberately, bearing down all opposition, thrown all her
expectations to the winds, and had come, travelling by the shortest
possible route and the fastest means, with one object in
view&mdash;to see Leslie. Her quest was over, and she saw him; and
yet she trembled as she had never done before. To answer his call,
and see him face to face she had travelled twelve thousand miles,
and yet all she could do now was to hang her head shyly, and
say:</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Raymond?"</p>

<p>And he had called her to him. With all his heart, and with all
his soul, he had summoned her to come, and now&mdash;she was here,
by his side. And all he could say, after moistening his dry lips
several times with his tongue, was:</p>

<p>"I am pretty well, thank you. How are you?"</p>

<p>At this moment Nell asked them to excuse her, leaving them, as
she wished to help Mrs. Meredith, and as neither of them expressed
any objection, she went out, and left them alone.</p>

<p>For some time neither spoke a word. Ruby stood by the bedside,
with her hands clasped, and her face drooping. She knew that he had
a bright flush upon his wasted face, and that his large eyes,
seeming much larger than they were by contrast with his hollow
cheeks, were fixed eagerly upon her face. And yet, she dare not
look at him. Her long dark lashes hid her eyes from view, and it
was not until a hot tear fell from one of them, and dropped upon
his wasted hand, which rested upon the coverlet of the bed, that
Leslie broke the silence.</p>

<p>"What made you come back to Australia?"</p>

<p>"You called me," she murmured, "and I am here."</p>

<p>"Then," he said, wonderingly, "you heard my call?"</p>

<p>"It is because I heard it that I am here."</p>

<p>He stretched forth the attenuated hand and she placed hers in
it.</p>

<p>"And have you heard the news?" he asked, "how all is changed and
I am homeless and penniless? That when I am better, if I ever do
get better, I shall have to face the world, without a trade or
profession, to earn my bread?"</p>

<p>"I know all," said Ruby.</p>

<p>"Yet I have sometimes," said Leslie, "been weak enough to dream
of what might have been. You know the hope that once possessed my
soul. Fate has willed that it shall never be."</p>

<p>"Why shall it never be?" she asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"Do you think that I could now ask you what I asked you twice
before? I could not. It would be cruel, and unmanly, to ask you to
make the sacrifice, even if you were willing, it can never be."</p>

<p>"Do you think that I should be making a sacrifice?" said
Ruby.</p>

<p>"How can you ask the question? I have beard of your marvellous
success. You have the world at your feet, and I
have&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"And you really think," she said eagerly, "that
if&mdash;if&mdash;I were to become your wife, that <i>I</i> should
be making a sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"Such a sacrifice," said he, "as no woman ever made."</p>

<p>"Leslie," she said softly, "yon love me, I know you do. You have
told me so, twice, and I know it is true. I do not want to ask you
to be my husband, but&mdash;I want you to ask me again&mdash;to be
your wife."</p>

<p>"Ruby!" he exclaimed, passionately, "is it true? Will you,
knowing everything promise to be my wife?"</p>

<p>"I will," she said.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my darling!" he said, fervently. "How can I ever
repay you?"</p>

<p>"By getting better as soon as you can," she said, bending down
and kissing him on the forehead. Then she added, "Leslie, the
object of my life is achieved. It was for this I studied. It was
for this I toiled. It was not for the sake of the money, nor the
applause, nor the renown. It was to make myself worthy of you."</p>

<p>Presently Ruby told him that her father was waiting to drive her
out to Old Joe's Flat.</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again, my love?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"You shall see me every day," she answered. "I must go home
to-night to see my mother and Madge, but to-morrow I will come age
and unless you drive me away, I will never leave you any more. I am
going to nurse you, and make you well again."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, people will talk and I cannot allow it. A woman
has a right to nurse her husband, but to nurse her affianced
husband is a different matter."</p>

<p>Ruby smiled down at him.</p>

<p>"It is usual, isn't it, Leslie," she said, "for a woman to name
the day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I will secure the right to remain by your side and nurse
you, Leslie. I will talk it over with my parents to-night, and I
will see you to-morrow, and exercise nay prerogative. And, as there
is a parson in the house, prepare for a very short notice! Now I
must go. Poor boy, you cannot lift your head, so I
suppose"&mdash;she bent her face down to his&mdash;"there. Now I am
going to call Nell, and you can tell her. Leslie, I am the happiest
girl alive to day!"</p>

<p>When Nell came in she was prepared for some sort of development,
she scarcely knew what, but when her brother, with a quiet smile,
introduced Ruby as his affianced wife, Nell nearly collapsed.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the mad people in the world!" said she. "But I am
not surprised. Oh, no! I have been hearing how she dragged those
two poor people round the world at such a pace that she has nearly
killed them. How she gave the coachman a sovereign on the
understanding that he should break the record! I might have known
that she would not let the grass grow under her feet. But do you
know all, dear? Do you know the sacrifice you will have to
make?"</p>

<p>Ruby clasped Nell to her and kissed her. Then she said:</p>

<p>"A woman who gives up the whole world makes no sacrifice if she
gains the man she loves."</p>

<p>"Oh!" sighed Nell. "How happy we could be if we only had
Bindawalla! You will not turn me away from you, will you?"</p>

<p>"My dear," said Ruby, "we shall be happy wherever we are. And as
for turning you away, I want you to be my sister, and to stay, with
me always until you find somebody who will love you better. Do not
fear for the future. I have no fear."</p>

<p>George Sterling felt very happy that night, as he sat on the
verandah at Old Joe's Flat, and listened to Ruby as she sang.</p>

<p>He smoked, and talked to Herr Batonstein about the glorious
change in the weather, and the professor said "Yes" to everything
Sterling said. Then Mrs. Batonstein came out to bid Mr. Sterling
good-night as she was very tired, and her husband yawned and said
he would go to bed too. So George Sterling was left upon the
verandah alone, and Ruby crept out quietly, and sat close by his
side.</p>

<p>Then she told her father everything. George Sterling looked very
grave, and said it was a serious matter, and he would think about
it. There wasn't any hurry.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, "that I have any great fault to find
with young Raymond. The only thing I ever had agin him was the fact
of his bein' a Raymond, and a squatter. Barrin' them, he was always
a good all round young fellow enough. He couldn't help bein' a
Raymond, and he ain't a squatter now. But I'm glad he asked you
when he was a squatter, because it shows it's not a new notion he's
got since he's been broke. Of course, you've knowed each other, on
and off, as the sayin' is, all your lives. He's got nothin', but
he's as well off as I was when I married your mother, and better,
because he's better eddicated. But anyhow, I'll think it over.
There ain't no hurry."</p>

<p>"But there <i>is</i> hurry, Pa," said Ruby. "He is sick. His
sister and Mrs. Meredith, and Mr. Meredith too, are all worn out
with constant nursing. Now, if I am to be his wife&mdash;and I am,
that's settled&mdash;if I am to be his wife, it as my duty to nurse
him, to be by his side, and to bring him back to health. I want to
have the legal right to do my duty."</p>

<p>George Sterling argued, but his logic could not compete for five
minutes with that of Ruby. His every objection was over-ruled, and
his arguments were all exploded. He loved Ruby and was very proud
of her, although, at times, he almost doubted whether this tall,
imperious, handsome, dark-eyed woman was his own little Rube.</p>

<p>And he could not forget that she had lately been moving in the
highest society, and that knowledge overawed him. He admitted to
himself that she knew a great deal more about these matters than
she did, and he therefore treated her opinions with due
deference.</p>

<p>The result was that she brought her father entirely round to her
way of thinking, and he admitted that she was right. If she was
going to marry young Raymond, it was her duty to nurse him and, if
she was going to nurse him, he supposed it was just as well that
she should marry him, and have done with it.</p>

<p>So, instead of being her opponent he became her ally, and it can
be easily understood that if Sterling could not resist Ruby's
attack, Mrs. Starling had no chance against their combined forces.
Although she stated that it was both impossible and absurd, that it
was unheard of and monstrous, besides being to the last degree,
inconvenient, Ruby carried one line of defence after the other,
until her mother took her last stand in the trench of public
opinion.</p>

<p>"What will the neighbours say?" she asked to be informed. "Have
you absolutely no respect for public opinion?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Damn public opinion," exclaimed George Sterling, "wouldn't
you take our Rube's opinion before public opinion? Damn public
opinion!"</p>

<p>Whereupon Mrs. Sterling capitulated.</p>

<p>As for Madge, she declared that the whole thing was disgraceful.
The idea of a wedding without proper clothes, and a cake, and a
party. They needn't ask <i>her</i> to be bridesmaid. She wouldn't,
not if they went down on their knees to her! She wouldn't be
anybody's bridesmaid, unless she had proper clothes, and gloves and
things, and a shower bouquet, the gift of the bridegroom. They
could get married if they liked, and she wouldn't stop them, not
she! But she wouldn't go a foot to the wedding, that she wouldn't.
There!</p>

<p>Ruby took this announcement calmly, and said that under such
circumstances Madge could stop and mind the house while everybody
else went to the wedding, which remark reduced Madge to tears and
the confession that they ought to know better than to take any
notice of what she said when she was upset!</p>

<p>George Sterling drove Ruby into Eugowra the next day, saw
Leslie, and had a long chat with him; then he talked the matter
over with Mr. Meredith. The parson said that the marriage could be
arranged, and while he and George Sterling were speaking about it,
Leslie and Ruby were discussing it with Nell and Mrs. Meredith.</p>

<p>The result of it ail was that Ruby had only been back three days
when she was Ruby Sterling no longer, but Mrs. Leslie Raymond, and
had the legal right to nurse her husband back to health again.</p>

<p>News in the Australian bush travels slowly, and so it happened
that when the tidings of Ruby's sudden return permeated the
district, the announcement of her wedding followed closely
behind.</p>

<p>The Maxwells and the Thorntons shrugged their shoulders in
surprise, and said that the girl was a fool, that, with her ability
and talent, and the opportunities she must have had in London, she
must be mad to marry a man who was really dependent upon charity,
when she might have secured a real good bargain in the matrimonial
market.</p>

<p>Ruby heard nothing of these remarks, and would not have heeded
them if she had. Her whole mind was devoted to one object&mdash;to
nursing Leslie. A week after the wedding he was able to go out for
a few hours daily on to the verandah of the cottage. He looked very
thin and gaunt, and his clothes were a great many sizes too large
for him, but he was delighted to be able to get out into the fresh
air again, and he rejoiced that each day brought some small
addition to his returning strength. Ruby would read and talk to him
by day, and sing to him in the evening, and when he could think
only of the present, and keep his thoughts from speculating upon
the future, life seemed like a pleasant dream.</p>

<p>One evening, about nine days after the wedding, Ruby was singing
as usual, and her rich voice floated through the open window and
out to the garden gate, where the parson stood, enjoying the
evening air, and watching the twinkling stays above. He was fond of
star-gazing, was the parson. There was something in the sublimity
and wondrous order and regularity of the heavenly bodies that
fascinated him and seemed to draw his soul from earth to Heaven. He
was gazing at his beloved stars, and listening to Ruby's song when
he heard his name called in a low voice, a little above a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Meredith! Mr. Meredith!"</p>

<p>The parson started and looked round. At first he could
distinguish nothing unusual, but the call was repeated, and upon
turning his eyes in the direction of the sound, he saw the outline
of a woman's' form crouching against the fence.</p>

<p>"Mr. Meredith!"</p>

<p>The parson opened the gate and went along the path to where the
figure crouched.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked. "Why do you hide, and call my name? What
do you want?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said, as he approached her, "hush! I want to speak
to you, but I must not be seen. I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid of whom?" said Mr. Meredith. Then, as on a closer
scrutiny he recognised the crouching figure, he said:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mrs. Pogson? Why, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"I have something I want to say to you. Something very
important, but I cannot say it here. Come after me along the road,"
and she turned, and keeping still within the shadow of the fence,
she led the way along the road. Mr. Meredith hesitated a moment,
and then followed her. When she arrived at the end of the fence she
turned the corner, stopped, and waited for him; and when he reached
her side he noticed that she was deeply agitated.</p>

<p>Laying her hand upon the parson's arm, and speaking in a low,
hurried voice, she said:</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you, something that may be of vital
importance, or it may not; but before I tell you, I want you to
promise me that you will never repeat what I shall say. Will you
promise?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know," said Mr. Meredith, "how far I should be
justified in making such a promise."</p>

<p>"I would not ask you to premise anything wrong," said she. "You
may make what use you like of my information, but you must promise
that you will keep the source of your knowledge secret, and that
you will never tell anybody that I told you. Will you promise? I
have a good reason for asking, which you will know later on."</p>

<p>"Give me some idea of the nature of your information," said
he.</p>

<p>"Mr. Meredith, the information I have to give has been gnawing
at my conscience for some time. I am only a simple woman, but I try
humbly to do my duty. My duty to my conscience and my God demands
that I should tell you what I know, and leave you to do what you
conceive to be right. But to tell you what I know may seriously
injure my husband. I don't want him to know that I have given you
the information. Will you promise me that he never shall know?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Meredith, "if you leave me free to use my judgment
in the matter, I will promise that this interview shall be
confidential, and that the source of my information shall remain
unknown."</p>

<p>"That is all I want. And now, come back a little, where the
shade is deeper. On a certain day in June you signed a document
which you believed to be Mr. Raymond's will!"</p>

<p>"It was Mr. Raymond's will. I have seen it since, and the
signature is there."</p>

<p>"Listen, then. It is of that document I wish to speak. Don't
interrupt me and I will tell you all I know."</p>

<p>"On the day the document was signed I was waiting for Mr. Pogson
to drive me into Forbes, and I went to his store, to tell him that
the buggy was ready. I knocked at the door, but he did not hear me,
so I turned the handle and walked in. He was deeply engrossed in
the study of two documents that lay on the table before him, and
did not know I was there until I placed my hand on his shoulder. I
saw the two papers he was reading. They were both of the same size,
and alike; except that there was more writing on one than on the
other. The one with the most writing on was marked on the top, in
large writing, 'Last Will and Testament,' the other, 'Equity of
Redemption.' Mr. Pogson covered them with a newspaper when he knew
that I was there, and I thought nothing of the papers until
subsequent events brought them vividly to my mind, and since then
they have haunted my dreams! He told me to go and wait outside, as
Mr. Raymond was coming to sign an <i>Equity of Redemption</i>.
Remember that. Mr. Raymond was coming to sign an EQUITY OF
REDEMPTION. I went outside, and Mr. Pogson remained in the office.
Through the glass partition I could see him from where I sat. I did
not watch him or spy on him&mdash;I did not dream that there was
anything to spy, but I looked at him through the glass, and saw him
fold the papers exactly alike, then he put one into his inner coat
pocket and the other in the safe. Soon after that Mr. Raymond came
in. The door was closed, and I could not hear, but I saw Mr. Pogson
take the paper from the safe and read it to Mr. Raymond, and I saw
that it was the paper with the least writing on, and therefore, the
equity of redemption. When he had read it, he folded it up, and
left the office to call you and Mr. Bingham in. As he passed me in
the shop, I <i>saw him</i> take the folded paper from the inner
pocket of his coat, and put into its place the one he had read to
Mr. Raymond. Then you all went back, and the paper was signed.
<i>That</i> afterwards proved to be Mr. Raymond's will. I did not
know at the time how much depended upon that document, but I know
it now, Mr. Meredith. If Mr. Raymond thought, when he signed that
document, that he was signing the paper that Mr. Pogson had just
read to him, he was deceived, for I saw Mr. Pogson change them as
he passed me in the shop.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Meredith, you know the secret that has been weighing
on my mind. If an injustice has been done, you may be be able to
make it right. But, oh! Mr. Meredith! Mr. Pogson is my husband.
Spare me the humiliation of thinking I have done him harm. You have
my secret. If I have done wrong in telling you, may God forgive me,
but I could not rest. Now I must go back home. Remember your
promise."</p>

<p>Before Mr. Meredith could answer she had glided away, and was
proceeding at a rapid rate towards her home.</p>

<p>The parson walked slowly back and took up his old position at
the gate. Ruby's voice still came floating through the open window,
and the stars were still looking down with their serene eyes. But
it was not of the celestial bodies that Mr. Meredith now thought,
his mind was fixed on earthly matters.</p>

<p>His brain reeled as he tried to grasp the significance of what
he had heard. Could it be possible that there was some mistake? And
if so, if there had been a mistake, or something worse, what could
he do? He could not let the matter rest where it was. A great
responsibility had been suddenly thrust upon him, and he must not
shirk it. He must face it, for Leslie's sake, for the sake of his
beautiful young wife and for the sake of something infinitely
greater, God's truth and His Divine justice!</p>

<p>He must do his duty. But what was his duty? What was the best
course to take? He paced backward and forward in deep thought,
while Ruby's voice, filling the garden with melody, sang:</p>

<p>Every valley shall be exalted,<br>
And every mountain and hill made low,<br>
The crooked straight, and the rough places plain.</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter 25. MR. POGSON BECOMES A
MARTYR.</h2>

<p>"Louisa Mary," said Mr. Pogson, when he had finished saying
grace and had helped himself to a liberal allowance of fried
tomatoes, "when I have finished my breakfast, I am going round to
the office."</p>

<p>"Yes, Erasmus," said Mrs. Pogson.</p>

<p>"I shall be back in a quarter of an hour, and I shall expect to
find my bag packed ready for me to start."</p>

<p>"Yes, Erasmus."</p>

<p>"You need not lock it. I am going to get some papers to take
with me, and I shall want to put them in. So you need not lock
it."</p>

<p>"Very well, Erasmus."</p>

<p>"Whatever are you doing, Louisa Mary?" exclaimed Mr. Pogson, as
his wife upset a cup of coffee over the white table cloth. "I
declare that you are as awkward as a cow in harness! What ails you
this morning?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Erasmus. I did not sleep very well last night,
and I just caught sight of Mr. Meredith passing the window."</p>

<p>"You should mind what you are doing, Louisa Mary. How often have
I expostulated with you upon the peculiar pertinacity with which
you will persist in poking your proboscis into places where its
presence is prohibited? Have I not done so repeatedly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Erasmus."</p>

<p>"Then don't let it occur again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pogson meekly promised to mend her ways, and then proceeded
to pack her husband's bag, while Mr. Pogson, having finished his
meal, departed for the store. There he found Mr. Meredith waiting
for him.</p>

<p>He bade the parson a gruff "Good morning," and was passing on,
but Mr. Meredith detained him, and requested a few minutes' private
conversation.</p>

<p>"I regret exceedingly," said Pogson, "that I have no time left
to converse with you this morning. I am going to Sydney. Upon my
return, should circumstances be favourable, I shall be happy to
attend to you."</p>

<p>"I must speak to you at once," said Mr. Meredith, firmly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson was about to reply, when, for the first time, he
looked in the parson's face. It was very pale, and his lips were
compressed with an air of grim determination, while his eyes shone
with an almost supernatural lustre. Mr. Pogson saw at once that Mr.
Meredith was unusually grave, and grimly determined about
something, so, without another word, he led him into the office and
closed the door.</p>

<p>He sat down on his office chair, and motioned Mr. Meredith to be
seated also, but the parson took no notice of his invitation, and
looked down upon him with an air of such supreme gravity that Mr.
Pogson began to feel quite uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Now then," he said, "you may speak. I can't stop long, as I am
going to Sydney."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pogson," said Mr. Meredith, suddenly gripping Pogson's
shoulder with a vyce-like grip, "there will be no necessity for you
to go to Sydney. Your fraud is discovered."</p>

<p>"What fraud? I have committed no fraud. How dare you insult
me?"</p>

<p>"Pogson," said Meredith, in a tone of contempt, "you profess to
believe in Almighty God, and in an existence after death. Refrain
from burdening your soul with any more falsehoods. They are worse
than useless. I tell you that I know."</p>

<p>"It is a lie," said Pogson. "You are only doing this to frighten
me. Leslie Raymond sent you."</p>

<p>"He does not know I am here," said Meredith. "Nobody knows but
myself." Then, seeing Pogson's hand furtively approaching a heavy
ruler on the office table, he placed it out of Pogson's reach.
"Don't attempt any violence," he advised quietly, "I am an old
footballer, and as hard as nails. If you attempt any violence with
me, I shall forget the sacred character of may calling and break
your neck."</p>

<p>The parson looked so very much in earnest, that Mr. Pogson
shrank back from him in affright. But he tried to nerve himself to
maintain his position, and said, in a tone of injured
innocence:</p>

<p>"Mr. Meredith, you have been listening to the vile calumnies of
some vituperative enemies of mine. How could I commit a fraud? And
yet you come into my own office, and charge me&mdash;ME&mdash;with
fraud! Why, you are exposing yourself to an action for libel. What
fraud do you fancy I have committed?"</p>

<p>"I don't <i>fancy</i> anything, Mr. Pogson, I <i>know</i>. I
know that you obtained the signature of the late James Raymond by
fraud, and you must make restitution, or go to gaol."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson looked furtively at Mr. Meredith, but dropped his
eyes nervously when Mr. Meredith looked at him. Mr. Pogson did not
like to hear the word "Gaol" It made him feel extremely
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He would have given anything to know how much Mr. Meredith knew,
and where he had obtained his information.</p>

<p>Now, although Mr. Meredith knew much, he could prove very
little. He had been anxiously considering the matter all night, and
he had decided to adopt a bold course, hoping that the suddenness
of the charge might so upset Pogson as to induce him to confess his
guilt.</p>

<p>He therefore watched Mr. Pogson closely, and although the latter
tried to put a bold face upon the matter, he looked so
uncomfortable at the mention of the word gaol that Mr. Meredith
felt convinced that Mrs. Pogson's tale was true, and that a fraud
had been committed. He resolved to follow up the slight advantage
he had obtained, so, fixing Pogson with his eye, he said
sternly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Pogson, it is no use for you to prevaricate. I know all.
The offence you have committed is punishable by many years'
imprisonment, with hard labour, Mr. Pogson. Breaking stones, and
making mats. Think of it!"</p>

<p>"But," said Pogson, trying to bluster, "you can't put me in gaol
without some proof! What do you know? How do you know that I have
done anything?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me," said Meredith, "I will tell you what I know, and
then you shall judge whether it is better to make restitution or to
go to gaol. I know that the late James Raymond never made a
will."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" interrupted Pogson.</p>

<p>"Silence, sir!" said Meredith. "Listen to me. I know that the
late James Raymond never made a will. He came here under the
impression that he was going to sign an equity of redemption. He
left under the impression that he had signed it. You prepared the
will without his knowledge, and changed the papers after the equity
of redemption had been read to him. He signed the one, thinking it
was the other, and you hoped by that means to transfer the
Bindawalla property from its rightful owners to yourself. You see I
know all."</p>

<p>During the parson's speech Mr. Pogson's face had been a study.
Attempted indifference, surprise, impotent rage, each fought its
way into the sanctimonious expression fixed there by the habit of
years. And before Mr. Meredith concluded, another look had crept
into Pogson's eyes, and cast its pallor upon his cheeks. The parson
recognised it as fear.</p>

<p>"But how did you find out, I mean I thought, that is&mdash;" Mr.
Pogson pulled himself together. "I must have time to think this
matter over," he said. "I will not discuss it now. You are trying
to make me incriminate myself."</p>

<p>"You have said quite sufficient," said Mr. Meredith, "to
incriminate yourself. But I will give you time. You shall have five
minutes," and he pulled out his watch. "It is now twenty-five
minutes past nine. If you have not delivered that bogus will into
my hands by half past I will send for the Sergeant of Police."</p>

<p>"But you would not dare. Mr. Meredith! Think of my
reputation!"</p>

<p>"I have thought of it," said Meredith, "and there is one thing I
would recommend you to think of. Think how it will feel to be
driven into Forbes with handcuffs on your wrists. There is one
minute gone."</p>

<p>"Is there no alternative?"</p>

<p>"The will or the handcuffs. No other. One minute and a half
gone."</p>

<p>"But suppose I were to give you the will, mind, I only say
'suppose,' what guarantee have I that you will not still tell the
police?"</p>

<p>"You have my word," said Meredith. "My object is restitution,
not punishment. I am willing to leave your punishment to God and
your conscience. Two minutes gone."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Mr. Meredith," said Pogson. "We are quite alone.
Listen. Can't we arrange this matter? There are a hundred thousand
pounds involved, and nobody knows. You are a poor man, and I will
give you five per cent. Only fancy! Five thousand pounds! And
nobody knows."</p>

<p>"God knows," said Meredith. "Three minutes gone."</p>

<p>"I will give you ten per cent, Mr. Meredith! Twenty per cent!
You shall have half! Surely that is fair? Share and share alike.
Come, Mr. Meredith. Religion don't fill your pockets, and it is not
every day you can make your fortune! Let us strike a bargain. Don't
be foolish and obdurate, Mr. Meredith!"</p>

<p>"Four minutes gone," said Meredith, sternly. "Only one minute
left."</p>

<p>"Can I say nothing?" said Pogson, whose face was ashen white,
while the perspiration stood in large drops upon his forehead. "Can
nothing move you? Make me an offer, a suggestion."</p>

<p>"The time is up," said the parson, as he closed his watch with a
snap. "I will send for the police," and he turned towards the door;
but a slight movement behind him caused him to turn quickly.</p>

<p>Pogson was just rising to his feet; he had a wolfish glare in
his eyes, and in his hand he held a loaded revolver which he had
just taken from a small drawer in his writing desk.</p>

<p>As the parson faced about, he was within a yard of the
revolver's nuzzle. He looked at Pogson, with a glance in which
contempt was not unmixed with pity, and, folding his arms, he
said:</p>

<p>"So you would add murder to your other crimes? You would add the
gallows to the handcuffs? <i>Fire</i>, if you dare! There are three
assistants in the shop, and four customers, seven witnesses in all.
Fire&mdash;if you DARE!"</p>

<p>For a moment Pogson seemed to hesitate, and the two men faced
each other in silence; then, slowly, like a beaten dog, Pogson sank
into his seat. With a trembling hand, he replaced the revolver in
the drawer, and dropped his face upon his hand.</p>

<p>He started suddenly as the parson placed his hand upon the
handle of the door and, sliding from the chair to the floor, he
literally grovelled at Mr. Meredith's feet.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, Mr. Meredith!" he pleaded, "do not be rash.
Do not send for the police."</p>

<p>"Will you give mo the will?" demanded Mr. Meredith.</p>

<p>"Is there no other way?" begged Pogson, piteously.</p>

<p>"None," said the parson.</p>

<p>"Then," said Pogson, with a sigh, "I will give it to you. But,
Mr. Meredith, think of my position. Think of my dear wife and
daughter. Think of everything you can, Mr. Meredith. Act in a
spirit of Christian charity, and don't give me away!"</p>

<p>"I have already told you," said Meredith, "that my object is
restitution and not punishment. Give me the paper and I will
go."</p>

<p>With trembling hands, Mr. Pogson produced his keys and, opening
the safe, he took from it a bundle of papers. Among these were two
very much alike. So much alike when folded, that if it had not been
for the signatures on one, it would have been difficult to detect
any difference. As Mr. Pogson was separating them, Mr. Meredith
quietly stretched forth his hand, and took possession of them
both.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said he and then, opening them, he added, "Yes. Just
as I thought. The document he signed, and the one he thought he
signed. I will take them both."</p>

<p>He took up it pen, and wrote in bold characters across the face
of the will, "the signature of the late James Raymond attached to
this document was obtained by me under false pretences." Then,
handing the pen to Mr. Pogson, he bade him sign.</p>

<p>"But you are asking me to incriminate myself. I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sign it!" said the parson. "I will keep the document, and it
shall never be produced unless you make some claim to the
Bindawalla estate. If it is ever produced, it will be your own
fault."</p>

<p>"But," protested Pogson, "what guarantee have I that you will
keep your promise?"</p>

<p>"You have," said Meredith, "the word of an honest man.
Sign."</p>

<p>Pogson signed, and Mr. Meredith witnessed his signature. Then
the parson put the papers into his pocket, and opened the office
door.</p>

<p>"One moment," said Pogson. "What am I to say? How am I to
account to the world for relinquishing my claims to the
estate?"</p>

<p>"Say anything you like," said Meredith. "Account for it in any
way you can. I will not contradict you."</p>

<p>So saying, the parson strode out of the store, and skipped
rather than walked towards the Rectory, where Leslie was reclining
on the verandah in the best of spirits. He had just received an
answer to a letter he had written some days before, applying for
the position of manager on a small sheep station out on the Darling
River. The answer was satisfactory, for it informed him that his
application had been successful, that he could proceed to the place
as soon as he was well enough, and that the salary was one hundred
and fifty pounds a year, with quarters. So Leslie was elated. The
future was not all a blank. And the parson, thinking that one joy
at a time was enough, congratulated him warmly, while he kept his
hand, for safety, upon the breast pocket of his coat in which he
carried a certain precious document.</p>

<p>When Mr. Pogson was left alone he shut the office door, and sank
back into his seat; and, with his chin on his hand, and his elbow
on the desk, he sat for a long time, gnawing at his finger nails
and thinking. Finally he arose, locked up the office, and went
round to his house. Mrs. Pogson met him at the door.</p>

<p>"Wherever have you been, Erasmus?" she asked. "You said you
would not be long. Your bag has been packed for an hour."</p>

<p>"I shall not require my bag, Louisa Mary," said he. "My
contemplated journey to the metropolis is indefinitely postponed;
indeed, I may say it is abandoned."</p>

<p>"But how about the will?" said she; and then she added, in some
alarm, "You don't look well, Erasmus. What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Louisa Mary," exclaimed he, "I am a martyr, a self-made martyr.
I have voluntarily immolated myself upon the altar of my Christian
principles. I have sacrificed myself for the gain sake of blessed
charity. 'What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and
lose his own soul?' Louisa Mary, you behold in me a man who may
henceforth be cited as a shining example of all professing
Christians, one, who relinquished his claim to a vast estate at the
dictates of that inward monitor, his conscience! I have
renunciated, and abdicated, and my conscience is vindicated. I
discovered at the last moment, Louisa Mary, that I could not
reconcile it with my conscience to avail myself of the late Mr.
James Raymond's kindness to myself. I have decided, therefore, that
I will not prove the will, but allow young Raymond to take
undisputed possession of his father's estate."</p>

<p>"Is it true, Erasmus? Have you really and truly renounced your
claim to the property, voluntarily, and for conscience sake?"</p>

<p>"Really and truly," said he, "for Conscience sake."</p>

<p>"Noble Erasmus!" exclaimed his wife, and she threw herself into
his arms, and wept copious tears of joy; while her conscience smote
her for having suspected her husband of wrong-doing. She wished she
had not spoken to Mr. Meredith, and resolved to take the earliest
opportunity of explaining to him that her suspicions were wicked
and unfounded.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson released himself from his wife's embrace, and
said:</p>

<p>"Control yourself, Louisa Mary, and do not try to make me vain.
I am impervious to vanity. And now, I wish to seek the seclusion of
my bed-chamber for a little quiet meditation. Do not permit my
meditations to be disturbed."</p>

<p>"Very well, Erasmus," said Mrs. Pogson, as she wiped her
eyes.</p>

<p>But her Husband's meditations had only lasted about half hour,
when she knocked timidly at his bedroom door. Mr. Pogson demanded
angrily to know who was there.</p>

<p>"It is I, Erasmus," said his wife. "A boy has brought a letter
for you which he says must be attended to immediately."</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson opened his door and took the letter. He had evidently
been lying down, for he was without coat or vest and his boots were
off. He may have been suffering from an attack of bile, for there
was a peculiar odour in the air and his wife noticed that his face
was unusually red.</p>

<p>He broke the seal of the letter with unsteady fingers and saw
that it was written on the official paper of the investment society
which had the honour of being represented in Eugowra by him. It ran
as follows:</p>

<p>E: POGSON, ESQ.<br>
Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
The bearer, Mr. Terret, is our authorised auditor. He is deputed by
us to examine your books, and all vouchers, documents, and
securities. You will kindly afford him every assistance.<br>
<br>
(Signed) JACOB BLAND,<br>
<br>
General Manager.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson read the letter through, then ran his fingers over
his head and face in a bewildered manner. He sank on a chair, and
tried to read the letter again, but his hand was trembling to such
an extent that the writing appeared blurred and indistinct. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"Louisa Mary, a glass of water!"</p>

<p>His frightened wife brought the water, which he swallowed at a
gulp. Then, still running his fingers through his hair' he said,
evidently speaking with an effort:</p>

<p>"Tell the messenger to inform the gentleman that I will be with
him in ten minutes. And now, Louisa Mary, leave me to restore
myself to my personal habiliments."</p>

<p>So saying, he shut the door, and Mrs. Pogson went to convey his
message to the boy who was waiting for it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26. SIC TRANSIT
POGSON.</h2>

<p>About twenty minutes after Mr. Pogson had retired to restore
himself to his personal habiliments, the auditor was still waiting
at the store, and Doctor Miasma was playing billiards at the
hotel.</p>

<p>Doctor Miasma was a duly registered medical man, but he had no
fixed place of practice. He was at present travelling with an
insurance agent, but he had tried his hand at a variety of
things.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was <i>locum tenens</i> for a doctor who was sick,
or who wanted a holiday; and sometimes he could be found on the
racecourse, where he was in the habit of earning an honest shilling
by way of commission. He gave "tips." He ran no risk, and as he
generally "tipped" all the horses in the race to different
individuals, he usually returned from the racecourse richer than he
went thither.</p>

<p>He was about forty, short and stout, with a round face, thick
lips, red nose, and a heavy moustache.</p>

<p>At the present time he was travelling with an insurance agent
and, at the moment this chapter opens, he was playing the insurance
agent billiards for drinks. The doctor was leading, and seemed to
have the chances of the game in his favour, when it was interrupted
in the most annoying manner by the landlady of the hotel, who
rushed into the room in an excited manner, exclaiming, "Doctor!
You're wanted!" The doctor muttered something not distinctly
audible, for he had missed an easy cannon and, dropping the cue, he
saw that the landlady was followed by a dishevelled young woman,
who came closely upon her heels.</p>

<p>"Ay! sir," cried this young woman, "are you the doctor? Oh!
Please come at once, we're in such trouble as never was! Never mind
your hat, sir. I had to come as I was, I had no time to change my
dress, or put my other shoes on, nor anything, so don't take any
notice of me. Oh! Poor Papa! He's so bad, and I'm sure he'll be
dead if you don't hurry!"</p>

<p>"Who is your papa?" asked the doctor, "and what has happened to
him?"</p>

<p>"Papa has taken poison," said she. "My papa is Mr. Pogson, and
he has taken poison!"</p>

<p>"Hush, you foolish girl," said the doctor, "you must not say
things like that. You don't know what is the matter with him.
Nobody but a medical man can say what is the matter with him. Lead
the way, and I will follow."</p>

<p>The rumour that Mr. Pogson had poisoned himself spread rapidly,
and the occupants of the hotel were consumed with a devouring
curiosity until the return of Dr. Miasma, which event did not take
place for over an hour.</p>

<p>"Well, Doctor," said the local miller, who happened to be in the
bar when the doctor came back, "what has old Pogson been doing? Is
it true that he has poisoned himself?"</p>

<p>"No," said Doctor Miasma, "it is not true. But he is very bad.
He has apoplexy."</p>

<p>"He didn't look like a man who would get apoplexy," said the
miller.</p>

<p>"Sir!" said Doctor Miasma, "do you doubt my veracity, or my
capacity?"</p>

<p>"Neither, sir," said the miller.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, sir," said the doctor. "And now, sir,
what will you take?"</p>

<p>In the afternoon the doctor went again to visit his patient and
this time he stayed with him for some hours. When he returned to
the hotel he reported that Mr. Pogson was dead.</p>

<p>"He never regained consciousness," said the doctor. "His seizure
was sudden, but his end was peace. His poor stricken wife held one
hand, while I held the other, and he passed away as peacefully as a
child."</p>

<p>"Will there be an inquest?" asked the landlady,</p>

<p>"An inquest?" repeated the doctor. "No, madam, decidedly not. I
have given a certificate of death, and he Will be buried
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Poor man," said the landlady. "There is one comfort, he was
very religious, and so he was prepared."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the blacksmith, who was in the bar, "he was a real
grafter at prayer-meetings, and things like that. He was a bit
close-fisted, although perhaps I oughtn't to say it, now he's gone,
but he was great at praying. There ain't much doubt about where
he's gone."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said the doctor, irreverently. "It
wouldn't be a safe bet. I gave a certificate of the cause of death,
but I wouldn't guarantee where he has gone."</p>

<p>After which speech, the doctor went to look for the insurance
agent, as he was anxious to finish the game at billiards. And when
it was finished, and the drinks swallowed, the insurance agent was
considerably astonished to receive from the doctor an intimation
that he was about to sever his connection with the insurance
business.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the agent.</p>

<p>"Nothing, my dear fellow," answered the doctor. "I am simply
tired of knocking about."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Going to Sydney to buy a practice."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to get the money?" said the agent.</p>

<p>"MY dear fellow," replied the doctor, "you shouldn't attempt to
probe people's private affairs. It's dem'd impertinent!"</p>

<p>The insurance agent said no more. But it may be inferred that,
however close-fisted Mr. Pogson had been during his life, his death
had not been without profit to Doctor Miasma.</p>

<p>Mr. Pogson's funeral was the largest ever seen in Eugowra, for
his vices had been so well hidden, and his virtues so well
displayed that, to the simple people of the district, who were apt
to take things at their face value, Mr. Pogson only required a halo
to make him a saint; and this halo his sudden death supplied.</p>

<p>Therefore, the town suspended business for the occasion, and
people followed the funeral in buggies and on horseback, as well as
on foot. The Good Templars were there in regalia; so were the Sons
and Daughters of Temperance. The Christian Endeavourers were there,
and the Sabbath School children, and they deposited wreaths and
flowers upon the grave, and sang hymns around it.</p>

<p>There were not many tears shed, but the paucity of tears was
compensated by the prodigality of floral tributes.</p>

<p>As Mr. Pogson had lived a fraud, so he was buried an impostor,
and the people he had hoodwinked in life he bamboozled as they
committed his mortal remains to the dust. Had Mr. Pogson's spirit
been hovering round the grave and suddenly become visible, we may
feel certain that one eye would have been partly closed, while a
spectral hand would have been extended, with its thumb upon his
nose, anti its lingers spread out.</p>

<p>When the auditor came to examine the books and vouchers left
behind by the late Mr. Erasmus Pogson, it was found that he had
been peculiarly absent-minded with regard to such mundane things as
debits, credits, and cash balances. The auditor said that on
account of this absence of mind, the entries in the books, together
with the vouchers and securities, showed a deficit of several
thousands of pounds. But it must be remembered that this was an
<i>ex parte</i> statement as Mr. Pogson was not there to explain,
which he could doubtless have done had he been present.</p>

<p>Then, a number of common people complained, and said that,
knowing Mr. Pogson's reputation for Christianity, they had, upon
various occasions, entrusted to his keeping diverse sums of money,
upon which they had been promised interest at a high rate. For
these sums of money they had received no acknowledgment, but Mr.
Pogson's word. As, however, there appeared no entry in Mr. Pogson's
book, the word of these common people was generally doubted.</p>

<p>In any case the number of those who had lost money was small in
comparison with those who had not; so Mr. Pogson's memory was
revered, and the white marble tombstone erected to keep it green
remains to this day, a monumental tribute to his many virtues.</p>

<p>The insurance company in whose office Mr. Pogson's life was
insured for a thousand pounds, with that callous indifference to
the sanctity of the tomb and the feelings of the bereaved ones
which occasionally characterizes financial bodies, refused to pay
the money unless the mortal remains or Mr. Pogson were exhumed and
examined. But Mrs. Pogson strongly resisted this attempted
violation of Mr. Pogson's grave, and nobly surrendered her claim to
the money rather than allow her husband's resting place to be
disturbed.</p>

<p>Consequently, in addition to his memory being kept green, the
mortal remains of Pogson were allowed to repose in peace; and the
following tribute to his memory, written by his daughter, and cut
deeply upon his grave stone, is as simple as it is true, and as
true to-day as it was on the day it was written:</p>

<p>Long time he battled on life's troubled shore,<br>
He is not dead, he's only gone before.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27. THE WELCOME TO
BINDAWALLA.</h2>

<p>Ir is needless to say that Leslie Raymond did not accept the
position on the Darling. He had a better position much nearer, for,
thanks to the parson, Bindawalla was his home again.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith never told Leslie all the details of the recovery
of the will, but he told him sufficient to show that the will had
not been made by his father, nor signed by him as a will.</p>

<p>Leslie was naturally delighted to find that, there being no
will, he and Nell were the owners of Bindawalla, as heirs to their
father, but they were both equally pleased to know that the memory
of their beloved parent was freed from the stigma of injustice,
which they had deplored even more than the loss of the
property.</p>

<p>Leslie's convalescence was rapid. Under the stimulating
influence of the good news, and the tender care of his devoted wife
and loving sister, he was soon able to give some attention to
business matters. He then found that the late splendid rains had
borne magnificent results. Food for stock was abundant, and the
season promised to be the best for years. The bank also had resumed
business and the locked-up capital was released, so Leslie found
that all liabilities could be paid, and the estate left free from
incumbrance.</p>

<p>Perhaps the walls of the Bindawalla homestead had never enclosed
so jovial a party as that which assembled to celebrate the
home-coming of Leslie and his bride. The whole affair had been
arranged by Nell, who insisted that as there had been no pomp nor
ceremony at the wedding, they would make up for it in some measure
at the welcome home.</p>

<p>"For very many years," said Nell, when she was advocating her
project, "I have been housekeeper and mistress at Bindawalla. I am
about to had over my keys, and with them the duties and
responsibilities of the position, to another. Let me have the
privilege of doing it in my own way."</p>

<p>She said it so lovingly and wistfully that nobody could refuse,
and she was given <i>carte blanche</i> to do exactly as she liked
in the matter. The first thing she did was to drive out and hold a
conference at "Old Joe's Flat," and as Mr. Meredith drove her, and
Mrs. Meredith accompanied them, and as the Batonsteins were still
staying with the Sterlings, they had a fairly representative
meeting. The immediate result was that everybody seemed to get very
busy. Nell sent away a number of letters and telegrams, and in the
course of the next few days made several special trips to
Bindawalla.</p>

<p>George Sterling, with a very red face, was rushing hither and
thither, while the kitchen at "Old Joe's Flat" burst suddenly into
a state of unwonted activity.</p>

<p>Then, in a few more days, mysterious parcels and boxes began to
arrive. Some of these were dispatched to Bindawalla, while others
were kept at the Rectory. And all the while a great air of secrecy
hung over everything, and Leslie and Ruby had to patiently await
events, for Nell would tell them nothing.</p>

<p>But, as Mr. Pogson once remarked, "All things come to those who
wait," and to Leslie and Ruby the day of the home-coming at length
arrived. Nell had once asked Ruby, casually, how she would like to
go out to Bindawalla, and Ruby had said, if she had a good horse,
she would love to ride out. So it happened, on the morning, of the
home-coming, that the man from the hotel led two horses into the
yard of the Rectory. One was Bunyip, and the other was a beautiful
chestnut mare, which, twelve months before, land been specially
broken in for Nell's own use. On the chestnut mare was a splendid
new embroidered side-saddle, with trappings to match. At the same
time Ruby received a note from Nell, who had gone out to Bindawalla
the day before, asking her to accept the mare as a wedding
present.</p>

<p>The parson, with his wife, having driven ahead, Leslie and Ruby
were left to ride out together. For the greater part of the way,
their route was the same as that taken on the night when Leslie had
driven Ruby home from the tea-meeting, and once again they passed
the old familiar places.</p>

<p>There were the fences, the gum trees, and the creek; and there
were some teamsters camped at the old spot. These men had an
inkling of what was happening, so, as Leslie and Ruby passed, they
rose from their meal at the camp fire, and with one accord, they
shook the gum trees with a mighty cheer.</p>

<p>The reception at Bindawalla was an unqualified success, which
it owed to the splendid organising tact or Nell. Everybody Present
had been deputed by her to manage some particular department in
connection with the day's proceedings and, therefore, each felt a
certain amount of responsibility. As the whole affair was
successful, each individual felt a thrill of pride; and considered,
of course, that the success was due, in a great measure, to their
own particular labour or skill.</p>

<p>Herr Batonstein thought that the supreme moment of the day was
reached when Leslie led Ruby by the hand along the garden path to
the house, while the professor payed the Wedding March upon the
piano, which had been wheeled out on to the verandah for the
occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith may be excused for thinking that he was one of the
principal actors, for it was he who, in a few eloquent sentences,
welcomed the young master of Bindawalla to his home again, and
invoked the blessing of Heaven upon him and his fair young
bride.</p>

<p>Madge's chief interest was centred in the moment when the bride
and bridegroom entered the dining-room, followed by their guests,
and gave vent to a simultaneous exclamation of surprise as they
admired the wonderful manner in which, by means of fern fronds,
evergreens, lilies of the valley, and flowery mottoes, it had been
transformed into a veritable fairy bower.</p>

<p>By this time the majority of those present were supremely happy,
for they had received their meed of praise. There were, however,
one or two faces which still bore an expression of anxiety.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sterling and Mrs. Batonstein both looked a little nervous
as the guests took their seats, but their nervousness vanished when
Leslie praised the magnificence of the feast, and the beautiful
table decorations. Mrs. Sterling was so happy that she shed tears
of joy when George Sterling proudly declared that every ounce of
food on the table was the product of "Old Joe's Flat," and had been
prepared under the personal superintendence of Mrs. Sterling.</p>

<p>"And who decorated the table so artistically?" asked Leslie.</p>

<p>"That," said Herr Batonstein, "vas mine wife. It is vat you call
cosmopolitan. My wife haf travelled. She got one idea from Berlin,
another from Paris, this from London, that from Dublin, and so on,
und the result is as you see."</p>

<p>"It is charming," said Leslie, "and I congratulate Mrs.
Batonstein."</p>

<p>Mrs. Batonstein blushed, and raised her eyes from the
tablecloth, where they had been modestly fixed. She tried to calm
her emotion, but the red ostrich feather in her hair trembled
visibly as she said:</p>

<p>"And it's a proud woman I am to hear you say so, Mr. Raymond.
And it's glad I am to be here, so I am, and I wish that Mrs.
Raymond and yourself may live long and die happy. May the fountain
of your joys burn with undiluted lustre, and sail calmly down the
vale of life until it rises to the realms of everlastin'
bliss!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bingham was not present at the welcome-home at Bindawalla.
He was enjoying a well-deserved holiday, and had gone on a trip to
the United States. It would have been scarcely necessary to mention
this, were it not for a curious passage in a letter of his,
addressed to Mr. Meredith and received by the latter some weeks
after the home-coming of Leslie and Ruby. It was as follows:</p>

<p><i>"And now I wish to mention a ridiculous incident which
occurred in San Francisco. Two days after our arrival, Mrs. Bingham
and I were riding on a street car. When we entered the car, there
was a man sitting on the end of same seat, whose face and figure
seemed very familiar to me. When we got on the car he pulled his
hat over his eyes and turned his head away, and, at the first place
the car stopped, he jumped off and disappeared in the crowd. Mrs.
Bingham was as much struck as I at the remarkable semblance, for,
had it not been for the fact that I saw his coffin lowered into the
grave with my own eyes, we could both have sworn that it was Mr.
Pogson."</i>
