<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This is a story of Blinky Bill and  his two friends Splodge the Kangaroo and Wally the Wombat.</p>
<p>One night, when the moon was  shining brightly, Mrs, Koala, Nutsy and Blinky Bill had all gone to bed on the  bough of a big old gum tree. But that naughty Blinky was full of mischief, and,  as he sat there thinking what a beautiful night it was, he had a marvellous  plan! Chuckling away to himself he crept over to the trunk of the tree&mdash;and this  is what he did&mdash; </p>
<p>&nbsp;Now Mrs. Koala and Nutsy were very, very tired  and were sound asleep, although the big round moon was high in the sky, and  everywhere it was as light as day.</p>
<p>Blinky Bill crept and crawled ever  so quietly down the big gum tree, not making the slightest, teeniest bit of noise  for fear he would wake them. He had the grandest idea! So exciting! The little  rascal hoped that his mother and Nutsy would sleep for ever so long, because if  they did wake up and find that he&rsquo;d gone there would be very serious trouble,  as sure as snakes.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301031h-images/page009.jpg" alt="crept" width="571" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Down, down he slid, as quiet as a  little mouse, making very sure that he kept well out of sight around the back  of the tree. &nbsp;He scarcely dared to  breathe till at last, with a big grunt of satisfaction he landed safely on the  ground and scampered off.</p>
<p>Gathering up his old bait tin  where he had left it hidden under a bush, he then broke off a nice strong stick  and tied a piece of string on one end and ran along the bush track as fast as  his little legs would carry him.</p>
<p>At last he came to the stream that  flowed merrily through Farmer Brown&rsquo;s property. There, much to his surprise, he  met his two old friends Splodge the Kangaroo and Wally the Wombat, who were  gossiping on the bank of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my lad, and what are you up  to, out here at this time of the night?&rdquo; asked Splodge. &ldquo;I suppose your mother  knows you are down this way?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301031h-images/page013.jpg" alt="friends" width="571" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &mdash;she sent me down to catch  some fish for a friend of hers,&rdquo; naughty Blinky said, without even quivering an  eyelash.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Fish!&rdquo;</i> Splodge and Wally both exclaimed with surprise. &ldquo;And where  do you think you&rsquo;ll get fish in this part of the world? Why, I&rsquo;ve never heard  of such a thing!&rdquo; cried Splodge with a scornful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them in there of course,  silly,&rdquo; Blinky snapped angrily, pointing to the stream. &ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s full of fish!  Millions of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Wally exclaimed, &ldquo;and  anyhow you can&rsquo;t catch fish by just sitting on the bank and wishing for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to borrow Farmer  Brown&rsquo;s boat,&rdquo; Blinky replied boldly. &ldquo;Farmer Brown isn&rsquo;t using it, and it&rsquo;s  going all rusty just lying about and doing nothing.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no you&rsquo;re not, young fellow,&rdquo;  Splodge said sternly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting in any boat without my permission&mdash;why,  the next thing we know you&rsquo;ll be drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know! We&rsquo;ll all go,&rdquo; Wally  interrupted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much safer fishing from a boat with a crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, you&rsquo;re a nuisance,&rdquo; Blinky  grumbled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a feller do anything without you always poking your nose into  somebody else&rsquo;s private business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, that&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; Splodge  said sharply. &ldquo;Man the boat there, and let us get under way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; Blinky mumbled under  his breath as he followed his friends round to where Farmer Brown&rsquo;s boat was  moored to a tree-stump.</p>
<p>They untied &ldquo;Daisy&rdquo; and clambered  in, Splodge last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well&mdash;this is the life. It&rsquo;s delightful!&rdquo; he  remarked as he sat down carefully in the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; Blinky panted  and puffed and blew as he pulled and tugged at the oars. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the  silliest boat I&rsquo;ve ever been in. What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all leaking too,&rdquo; Wally  added as he bailed out tinful after tinful of water with an old tin.</p>
<p>Blinky tugged away at the oars but  for some strange reason the boat would not move. What neither he nor Wally had  noticed, was Splodge tying the mooring rope to his tail for safety before they  entered the boat as they were both so full of excitement, and eager to get  away, especially Blinky as he grabbed the oars, so that nobody else could do  the rowing.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301031h-images/page017.jpg" alt="tail" width="569" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not trusting my life in <i>this</i> outfit and with <i>this</i> crew,&rdquo; Splodge chuckled knowingly  to himself as he knotted the rope round his tail, &ldquo;and anyhow, a bit of pulling  and tugging at the oars will soon take the enthusiasm out of our friend Mr.  Blinky.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of fish did your mother  tell you to catch?&rdquo; Wally asked in between spells of bailing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharks,&rdquo; Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharks or cod, perch or whales,  it makes no difference,&rdquo; Splodge remarked in a lofty tone of voice, and  sticking his nose in the air. &ldquo;There never were, and there never will be, any  fish in this stream. Why&mdash; I&rsquo;ve spent my boyhood and all my life in this  neighbourhood, and all I&rsquo;ve ever seen in this stream were a couple of tiny  tiddlers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I wish the &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo; would go,&rdquo;  Blinky complained again as he turned around and tried pulling in the opposite  direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the cause of it,&rdquo; he  growled as he glared savagely at Splodge. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Me?&rdquo; Splodge exclaimed  innocently, with a wink at Wally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you &mdash; you&rsquo;re so big and fat  and lazy,&rdquo; poor Blinky puffed. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you get out and leave Wally and me  here alone? We don&rsquo;t want your help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; Splodge said.  &ldquo;Not under any circumstances,&rdquo; he added disdainfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here in the &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo;  and here in the &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo; I stay.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301031h-images/page024.jpg" alt="fish" width="578" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps&mdash;and p&rsquo;raps not,&rdquo; Wally  remarked slowly. He made some funny little sniffy noises with his nose as he  eyed two large fish darting along in the direction of Splodge&rsquo;s tail, which  that cunning gentleman had said he was going to use as a rudder to guide the  boat when they started to move. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, if we ever move,&rdquo; he  thought.</p>
<p>And then everything happened so suddenly  that it is hard to tell who was most surprised, Blinky, Splodge or Wally!</p>
<p>With a loud yell of pain, Splodge  sprang high in the air, upsetting and swamping &ldquo;Daisy,&rdquo; while Blinky was  catapulted way over the stream and onto the far bank.</p>
<p>Wally tried to stop from laughing  out loud. He knew what had happened! He had seen that those fish had taken big  bites out of poor Splodge&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>And now the worst of all happened.  Farmer Brown, who must have heard all this commotion, appeared from nowhere and  started banging away with his big shot-gun. Amid all the confusion of shouts  and bangs rending the stillness of the night, Farmer Brown was simply ramping  with rage. He jumped and pranced and tore up and down the bank of the stream  shouting at our three friends, shooting off his gun and getting nowhere, while  his &ldquo;Daisy&rdquo; slowly sank lower and lower.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301031h-images/page028.jpg" alt="gun" width="579" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Splodge was paddling like mad with  his two front paws, trying to keep afloat, although his hind legs were resting  on the bottom of the stream, still he kept on yelling &ldquo;Save me! Save me! Help!  Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time poor Wally had sat  shivering in the boat, too terrified to move. He was nearly scared out of his  wits. He scrambled out and jumped onto Splodge&rsquo;s back, dug his long claws in  and clung there for his very life with his teeth chattering, and too frightened  by now to even whimper a word. &ldquo;Gee &mdash; but I&rsquo;m lucky,&rdquo; gasped Blinky as he  picked himself up from the ground. He shook his big fluffy ears and looked  round in the direction of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Splodge was still paddling away  madly with his front paws. &lsquo;&lsquo;Let go the moorings Blinky,&rdquo; he was shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw us a life-buoy,&rdquo; wailed  Wally, now almost in tears.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! went Farmer  Brown&rsquo;s shot-gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh &mdash; he&rsquo;s tied up!&rdquo; Blinky  cried as he now caught sight of the rope tugging at the tree stump. &ldquo;<i>Now</i> I know why the &lsquo;Daisy&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t go,  and me pulling and tugging away all that time for nothing! I&rsquo;ll make him sorry.  Why, if it wasn&rsquo;t for poor old Wally I&rsquo;d leave him drowning out there.&rdquo; Running  to the mooring rope, tied to an old tree stump, he started pulling his friends  ashore.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301031h-images/page033.jpg" alt="stump" width="581" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>It was a dreadful task as they  were so heavy and every moment he expected Farmer Brown&rsquo;s bullets to kill one  of them, little knowing that Farmer Brown was only using the blank cartridges  which he kept to frighten robbers and birds away from his orchard; otherwise  Splodge and Wally would have been dead long ago. But the noise was terrifying  to these three animals, and each one thought his last moment on earth had come.</p>
<p>With Blinky shouting instructions at  them, and with much puffing and panting and blowing, Splodge and Wally slowly  but surely, drew nearer and nearer to the bank, until, with a little scream of  relief, Wally jumped from Splodge&rsquo;s back and rolled over and over in the grass  at Blinky&rsquo;s feet,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, quick! Run for your  life!&rdquo; panted Blinky, grabbing Wally by the arm.</p>
<p>Wally didn&rsquo;t need a second  warning. He dashed after Blinky as fast as he&rsquo;d ever ran in his life, much  faster than any other wombat had ever ran, leaving a trail of water behind him.</p>
<p>Poor Splodge was left behind,  still firmly tied to the tree stump, to get away as best he could. He was  jumping and yelling and kicking up a fearful noise and a lot of dust and  stones.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301031h-images/page036.jpg" alt="dust" width="579" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Splodge! Splodge!&rdquo; Wally panted  behind Blinky. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be killed. We can&rsquo;t leave him behind like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It serves him right,&rdquo; Blinky  shouted breathlessly. &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;ll never tie himself up again while I go for a  fish and a row in a boat. He nearly had us all killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a race of life and death to  Blinky and Wally, and it was two very frightened and tired little animals who  eventually reached home and safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; Wally gasped. &ldquo;No more  boating and fishing for me.&rdquo; He was still growling to himself as he settled  down for a nice long sleep, thoroughly tired out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness Mother and Nutsy  are still sound asleep,&rdquo; Blinky murmured to himself as he scrambled very  cautiously onto the family bough of the big gum tree; but he was only just in  time, for, as he sat there pretending to be asleep, Mrs. Koala woke up with a  start, and yawning and rubbing her eyes, was amazed to see a most extraordinary  sight right under her nose. She could hardly believe her own eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; she exclaimed  as Nutsy, also yawning and rubbing her eyes, joined her. &ldquo;Whatever is the world  coming to?&rdquo; The two of them gazed down with astonishment at the amazing scene  on the ground below them.</p>
<p>It was Splodge, bounding away at  full speed with the tree stump still firmly tied to his tail! Unable to untie  himself, and terrified of Farmer Brown and his shot-gun, he had simply uprooted  the stump out of the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well&mdash;that&rsquo;s strange. I&rsquo;ve  always said that tails only bring trouble upon their owners,&rdquo; said Mrs. Koala  in a warning tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, specially when they&rsquo;re used  for anchors,&rdquo; Blinky remarked, peeping round the trunk of the tree.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301031h-images/page040.jpg" alt="anchor" width="579" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as though he&rsquo;s had a  terrible fright,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala continued. &ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;s been up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as though he&rsquo;s had a <i>terrible, dreadful, gigantic, enormous</i> fright full of quivers,&rdquo; Blinky added with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, I suppose I&rsquo;ll hear all  about it in good time,&rdquo; his mother replied. One thing I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> of &mdash; he&rsquo;s been  up to no good, out at this time of the night. Just as well Blinky that you&rsquo;ve  been home out of mischief&rsquo;s way. Oh well, now we can all have some nice gum  tips for supper and feel very thankful trouble does not come our way.&rdquo;</p>
