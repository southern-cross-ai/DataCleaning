<p align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page009.jpg" alt="chapp 1" width="374" height="211"></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is scandalous!&rdquo; Angelina  Wallaby said in an angry voice. Something very dreadful must have happened to  upset her, for Angelina was the quietest and gentlest creature in all bushland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> shoes stolen! My very best shoes,  too; and I&rsquo;d like to know where I&rsquo;ll get another pair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelina scratched away the grass  from under her feet, looked into secret corners round the rocks, peered up into  the trees, then sat back on her tail with a very worried look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> I put them just there. I  <i>know</i> I did,&rdquo; she said, staring at a small bush in front of her.</p>
<p>Suddenly she pricked her ears,  listened most attentively for a moment or two, then bounded off into the bush.  But she did not go far&mdash;just as far as the wattle patch. There, among the pale  green wattles, lying on the grass that had the softest touch on account of its  being sheltered from the sun, lay a little boy fast asleep, with Angelina&rsquo;s  best shoes on his feet,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; Angelina said. &ldquo;What  next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hopped a little closer, peered  curiously at the tiny boy, then, not knowing exactly what to do, gave a loud  thump with her tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shoes!&rdquo; she said in a loud  voice, as the little boy opened his eyes and jumped up with fright, intending  to run away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shoes!&rdquo; Angelina repeated,  pointing to the little boy&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page011.jpg" alt="shoes" width="588" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Wallabies don&rsquo;t wear  shoes&mdash;they&rsquo;re mine. I found them,&rdquo; the little boy replied as he took the shoes  from his feet and tucked them under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you they&rsquo;re <i>mine</i>. I had  them made specially, on account of my corns,&rdquo; Angelina said indignantly as she  thumped her tail, just to show how angry she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! do let me see your corns!&rdquo;  the little boy cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they must be funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny, indeed,&rdquo; Angelina growled.  &ldquo;Look here&mdash;just look at my poor feet.&rdquo; She lifted a hind foot for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me. That&rsquo;s dreadful,&rdquo;  the little boy said. &ldquo;May I feel them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just pat them gently; I  can&rsquo;t stand jabs,&rdquo; Angelina said, rather condescendingly.</p>
<p>The little boy patted Angelina&rsquo;s  feet then looked up with a worried frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe those are pads on your  feet&mdash;not corns,&rdquo; he said knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pads!&rdquo; Angelina said, looking  very puzzled. &ldquo;What are pads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those things on your feet,&rdquo; the  little boy replied. &ldquo;Grandpa is the only person with corns,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Grandpa and what does he  do with corns,&rdquo; Angelina asked, more surprised than ever. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grandpa&rsquo;s just Grandpa, and  he paints his corns,&rdquo; the little boy replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tush!&rdquo; Angelina snapped. &ldquo;Whoever  heard of any one painting corns. What&rsquo;s your name, and why did you steal my  shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Chum, and I didn&rsquo;t steal your  shoes. I just took them,&rdquo; the little boy replied, hugging the shoes tighter  than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; Angelina  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Grandpa,&rdquo; Chum answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness me, what an annoying  child you are,&rdquo; Angelina sighed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me <i>where</i> you live? Is it over  there&mdash;or over here&mdash;or that way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You mean where did I come  from?&rdquo; Chum said hurriedly. &ldquo;Over there; but I&rsquo;ve been a long time lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my shoes, and we&rsquo;ll go along  to see Who&rsquo;s Who. He&rsquo;ll tell me where you live and what to do,&rdquo; Angelina said  as she grabbed a shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I keep this one?&rdquo; Chum  asked pleadingly, &ldquo;Grandpa needs a new pair of slippers so badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re magic slippers,&rdquo; Angelina  said, grabbing the other. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who gave them to me. He told me never to lose  them or my tail would fall off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only lizards who drop their  tails,&rdquo; Chum scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come along and don&rsquo;t argue  with me,&rdquo; Angelina said impatiently, as she made a bound into the bush. Chum  ran as fast as his legs would carry him, but Angelina&rsquo;s great bounds left him  breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wallaby! Wallaby!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Wait  for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, haven&rsquo;t you learned to  hop yet?&rdquo; Angelina said, as Chum came running along beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I without a tail?&rdquo; he  panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tails are not in it. We don&rsquo;t use  our tails to hop with, as so many people think,&rdquo; Angelina said impatiently. &ldquo;Look  at Flip &mdash;he has no tail and he&rsquo;s the finest hopper I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Flip?&rdquo; Chum inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You&rsquo;ve never heard of Flip?  He&rsquo;s the biggest and bulgiest frog in the bush. One hop and he&rsquo;s out of sight,&rdquo;  Angelina said, waving a paw excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hop and he&rsquo;s back again,&rdquo;  croaked a voice right beside them.</p>
<p>There at their feet sat a very  large green frog, grinning from ear to ear, or should I say grinning like a  Cheshire cat. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Chum gasped. &ldquo;Is this Flip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; Flip said, taking one  hop&mdash;and there he was, on Chum&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; he repeated as with  another hop he landed on the ground again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, I wish I could hop like  that,&rdquo; Chum said, gazing at Flip in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever tried?&rdquo; Flip asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;at least I don&rsquo;t remember ever  trying,&rdquo; Chum replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how about it now?&rdquo; Flip  said eagerly, &ldquo;Just balance yourself on your toes, swell out a bit and wait  till that wriggly feeling comes, then&mdash;hop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; Chum said, standing on  the tips of his toes, while Angelina and Flip took their positions, one on each  side of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell out! Swell out!&rdquo; Flip called.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page014.jpg" alt="swell" width="384" height="400"></p>
<p>Chum took a deep breath, while his  face grew redder and redder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Flip croaked very loudly, at  the same moment taking a hop that landed him yards away, while Angelina  gracefully leaped ahead, coming to rest on a big rock.</p>
<p>Poor Chum&mdash;he took a hop, stumbled,  and fell only a foot away from where he had stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with his  puffer,&rdquo; Flip remarked in a concerned tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a puffer, and I  don&rsquo;t want one,&rdquo; Chum said indignantly, as he picked himself up, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad  I can&rsquo;t hop. Yon both looked so silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! that&rsquo;s what I call rude,&rdquo;  Flip said, looking at Angelina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rude is no name for it,&rdquo; she  answered. &ldquo;But the trouble is, I&rsquo;ve got to get him to Who&rsquo;s Who.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better hop along beside him.  You take one hand and I&rsquo;ll follow,&rdquo; Flip advised.</p>
<p>Angelina hopped back to Chum, not  feeling too pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along; give me your hand,  and do your best to keep up with us. I&rsquo;d no idea that legs could be such stupid  things. They wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as bad if you had a puffer. Has your Grandpa  one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He puffs a dreadful lot, but he  can&rsquo;t hop. I&rsquo;ve never seen him do it,&rdquo; Chum replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he hops when you&rsquo;re not  looking, or perhaps his puffer is old and won&rsquo;t work properly. You know I&rsquo;ve  seen some wallabies puff and puff and they can&rsquo;t hop a scrap. Who&rsquo;s Who says  they are old, and worn out.&rdquo; While Angelina had been speaking Chum had been  fairly flying along, his hand tightly grasped in Angelina&rsquo;s paw, his toes just  touching the ground now and then, while Flip hopped behind raising little  clouds of dust as each hop came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we nearly there?&rdquo; Chum asked,  realizing his little legs were becoming tired,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just round the corner,&rdquo;  Angelina answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just round the corner&rdquo; took some  time to reach; but, when it came into view, such a queer place confronted Chum.  A small hut made from sticks and stones, with a thatched roof, cuddled amongst  the trees, while the most amazing sight of all was a big fat pig sleeping  soundly in front of the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, Um-Pig!&rdquo; Flip croaked  loudly.</p>
<p>Um-Pig opened an eye, gave a  grunt; then lurched to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do!&rdquo; he grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Who&rsquo;s Who?&rdquo; Angelina  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s busy thinking,&rdquo; Um-Pig  answered. &ldquo;He said no one was to disturb him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is most important and we  <i>must</i> see him,&rdquo; Angelina replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spoil his thinking if you  disturb him,&rdquo; Um-Pig said with a grunt.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page017.jpg" alt="thinking" width="582" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of thinking is he doing  to-day?&rdquo; Flip inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serious ones,&rdquo; Um-Pig answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they like?&rdquo; Chum  ventured to ask. Everything seemed so strange, and Um-Pig looked so funny as he  gazed at his visitors,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen them. They&rsquo;re  what Who&rsquo;s Who calls &lsquo;inspirations,&rsquo;&rdquo; Um-Pig replied. &ldquo;All I know is, that if  he has to do a lot of thinking he gets very cranky and says &lsquo;I wish you&rsquo;d grow  fur on your skin,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I wish you&rsquo;d bark and not grunt.&rsquo; Meaning me, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry for you,&rdquo; Flip  remarked, &ldquo;but tell him we <i>must</i> see  him. It&rsquo;s urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig uncurled his tail, then  curled it up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s more  than I&rsquo;d dare to do,&rdquo; he grunted sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such nonsense!&rdquo; Angelina said  impatiently, hopping towards the doorway. Then poking her nose in she called in  a loud voice: &ldquo;Come out Who&rsquo;s Who; we want to see you. It&rsquo;s <i>most</i> important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t til I straighten it!&rdquo; a  thin old voice called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do hurry up, I&rsquo;ve such a lot to  ask you,&rdquo; Angelina replied.</p>
<p>To Chum&rsquo;s surprise an old man  hobbled out of the doorway, muttering to himself: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. It&rsquo;s no use.  It&rsquo;ll have to stay as it is,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry to disturb you,&rdquo;  Angelina apologized, &ldquo;but can you tell us where Chum lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the middle of thinking  the most important things. Didn&rsquo;t Um-Pig tell you?&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who asked. He was not  exactly cross; but not exactly pleased.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page019.jpg" alt="pig" width="681" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; Flip answered, &ldquo;but  this is so very urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was just thinking all about  Um-Pig&rsquo;s crumpled nose and how I could straighten it so that it would stay  straight. I&rsquo;d just finished and found that it really didn&rsquo;t matter, because his  tail isn&rsquo;t straight, and if I had to make that straight I&rsquo;d find that didn&rsquo;t  matter either, so you see I needn&rsquo;t have been thinking to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a worry for you,&rdquo; Angelina  said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to know where Chum  lives?&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who asked, changing the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please,&rdquo; they all replied at  once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question,&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who  said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> hurry and tell us,&rdquo; Flip croaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see now&mdash;um&mdash;yes&mdash;Chum is the  little boy who lives in the Long Ago.&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who looked at Chum, nodding his  head as he gazed. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s right&mdash;he lives in the Long Ago,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; Angelina asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say about one hundred  years. It&rsquo;s a long, long journey from here, and the first part of the road is  unpleasant. I know. I came that way myself.&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who gave a deep sigh and  brushed his hand across his old eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a hundred years is a long  way off,&rdquo; Angelina said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Do you think Chum can travel so far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not&mdash;he is young; but he can&rsquo;t  go barefooted. I must see if I can find him a pair of shoes,&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who replied  kindly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a pair tucked away on the top shelf that my own little boy wore.  He dropped them fifty years away, but I picked them up, hoping he would come to  find them some day; but he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hobbled inside his hut to look  for the shoes while Flip, Angelina, and Chum waited outside.</p>
<p>Um-Pig slowly walked towards them,  then hastily grabbing one of Angelina&rsquo;s paws between his two front feet he  pleaded with tears in his eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake take me with  you. Please, please. I&rsquo;m so tired of having my nose and tail altered. It&rsquo;s more  than I can stand. He&rsquo;s always telling me I&rsquo;ll be bacon some day. It&rsquo;s too  dreadful for words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you come without shoes?&rdquo;  Chum said kindly, wiping Um-Pig&rsquo;s tears away with the corner of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but perhaps I&rsquo;ll  grow wings if I wish very hard,&rdquo; Um-Pig replied, sniffling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! <i>You</i> grow wings! What next!&rdquo; Flip retorted rudely. &ldquo;It would be much  better for you to borrow one of Angelina&rsquo;s shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you lend him one?&rdquo; Chum  asked Angelina. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave the poor thing here when he&rsquo;s so sad.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could; but it will be  most inconvenient travelling with him. He?s so fat&mdash;and besides&mdash;he &mdash;he&mdash;well, he  SMELLS!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page023.jpg" alt="smells" width="460" height="400"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind that!&rdquo; Flip said  cheerfully. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;he was born that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig stood silently by,  listening&rsquo; to the discussion and twisting and untwisting his tail. He was very  worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we had better take him,&rdquo;  Angelina said ungraciously. &ldquo;Run away and hide. If Who&rsquo;s Who finds that you  have run away he will be annoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig snuffled, wiped his tears  away with a shake of his head, and ambled into the bush out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice pickle we&rsquo;ll be in,&rdquo;  Angelina growled, &ldquo;and all through a pig&rsquo;s trotters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa doesn&rsquo;t like pig&rsquo;s  trotters either,&rdquo; Chum whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not Um-Pig&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo;  Flip snapped. &ldquo;All the same I hope he doesn&rsquo;t like frog&rsquo;s legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just when matters seemed to be  growing personal Who&rsquo;s Who came through the door-way with a pair of bright  green shoes under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will these do?&rdquo; he asked,  offering them to Chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sweet,&rdquo; Chum replied. &ldquo;Shall I put them on now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do so; but you must put them  on back to front you know,&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who said, placing them on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why must I do that?&rdquo; Chum asked  in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have to go back to Long  Ago, and, if you put them on toes to the front, they&rsquo;ll carry you to the  future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny,&rdquo; was all Chum could  say. It was certainly a strange place to be in with pigs and wallabies, and now  shoes on back to front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After fifty years you&rsquo;ll find the  journey much easier,&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who remarked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to the hills and trees  where you can rest. There will be few dusty roads, the air will he fresher, the  birds will sing for you joyously, and you&rsquo;ll meet the bush folk &mdash;the little  koalas and possums that we&rsquo;ve missed so sadly down here. Tell them I miss  them&mdash;tell them I cry for the days when I knew them&mdash;tell them&mdash;please tell them  to go far far away, even to the Long Ago where man with his cruel gun cannot  reach them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sad you are to-day,&rdquo; Angelina  said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I grow old; and each year  more of my little friends depart. My magpies&mdash;my kookaburras&mdash;my satin-birds and  finches. They are leaving me one by one. I have seen the cities creep over the  hills like a slow advancing wave, driving my birds and animals away, or man  trapping and shooting them until few remain. Too late he will realize his  folly. But I must not be so sad when you are starting out on your journey, or  you may carry my sadness with you. That would never do.&rdquo; Bending down he  fastened Chum&rsquo;s shoes on his feet, and, strange to say, they were most  comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye to you all. I wish  I were going too.&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who waved his hand as if to hasten them off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be here when we come back?&rdquo;  Angelina inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Who&rsquo;s Who  replied. &ldquo;When the last bird leaves I shall go too. I am weary, and Um-Pig&rsquo;s  tail and nose give me a headache whenever I look at them. He&rsquo;s a good fellow,  but his grunt becomes monotonous. I know his future will be bacon so I do all I  can to make things easy for him now,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelina, Chum, and Flip hurried  away. To Chum&rsquo;s great joy he found he could hop with great speed. Through the  bush they went, quite forgetting Um-Pig until a grunt from the sideway  attracted their attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Here&rsquo;s old trotters!&rdquo; Flip  said cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-Pig is my name,&rdquo; the pig said  haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re all here now and must  hurry on to our first resting-place&mdash;twenty years away,&rdquo; Angelina said, handing  Um-Pig a shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; Um-Pig took the shoe  and tied it to one of his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you possibly leave the  &lsquo;smell&rsquo; behind?&rdquo; Angelina asked him kindly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t need it as we  travel,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it for so long I really  don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do without it now,&rdquo; Um-Pig said meekly, &ldquo;Does it annoy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful!&rdquo; Chum and Flip  cried together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we could frighten it  away, or leave it under a bush,&rdquo; Angelina advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can try frightening it if you  like,&rdquo; Um-Pig said slowly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to leave it under a bush. It would  miss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll frighten it then,&rdquo; Angelina  replied, with a withering look at her piggy friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I call out, &lsquo;One, two,  three,&rsquo; all shout at the top of your voices, &lsquo;Bacon and eggs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;One&mdash;two&mdash;three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bacon and eggs! Bacon and eggs!&rdquo;  They howled as loudly as they could, while Um-Pig stood with his snout in the  air sniffing quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it gone?&rdquo; he inquired  anxiously.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page021.jpg" alt="gone" width="603" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Angelina shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us try &lsquo;Sausages,&rdquo; she  commanded, &ldquo;and you, Um-Pig, shout with us too. How can you expect it to go  when you don&rsquo;t frighten it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then&mdash;One, two, three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sausages!&rdquo; they shouted at the  top of their voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pork sausages!&rdquo; Angelina yelled,  while Um-Pig stood trembling with emotion.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page025.jpg" alt="pork" width="651" height="359"></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he whimpered. &ldquo;I felt  it go, and I&rsquo;ve had it for so long. I hope it won&rsquo;t be angry with me. Do you  think I&rsquo;ll catch a cold now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold! What nonsense,&rdquo; Flip  remarked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel pinker without it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean paler?&rdquo; Um-Pig inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like; although we  felt paler when it was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t waste any more time,&rdquo;  Angelina interrupted. &ldquo;Let us go. We must be over the hill by daylight.&rdquo; </p>

  Junket and Sixty Years Ago</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page027.jpg" alt="chap 2" width="515" height="201"></p>
<p>Over the hill was really a pretty  place. On the way Angelina, Chum, Flip, and Um-Pig had passed a dusty city.  Although they travelled along the outskirts, and the noise and smoke, it still  remained an ugly journey. Rows and rows of houses packed closely together,  jostling each other for breathing space, and finally blowing their breath up  through tall chimneys. Fences and fences with sullen looks, as much as to say  &lsquo;&lsquo;Hurry up and pass&mdash;we&rsquo;ve no room here for you.&rdquo; Then the motor-cars that  dashed along the road, rushing off to nowhere really; but all so dreadfully mad  on getting there in time. And so the first twenty years were passed until &ldquo;over  the hill&rdquo; was reached. Here, things seemed quieter&mdash;just a little; but in place  of a packed city wide spaces with a few trees were to be seen. Farm-houses had  settled on the earth with a contented look, and cattle lay in the clear  sunshine; but, even so, a noisy tractor turned up the soil, disturbing the  peace that should have been,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I should meet my little Joey  here,&rdquo; Angelina said anxiously, looking this way and that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you leave him?&rdquo; Chum  asked. &ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;stupid,&rdquo; Flip  remarked. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of Angelina&rsquo;s baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Ah, have you a baby? How  lovely!&rdquo; Chum cried excitedly, &ldquo;I love babies. Can I nurse it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He was so tiny,&rdquo; Angelina  replied. &ldquo;I must pop him back in my pouch when I find him,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ll find my wife  and children here?&rdquo; Um-Pig inquired as he uttered little grunts of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lose them also?&rdquo; Chum  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly lose them. They  were taken away from me to be pickled, so I heard.&rdquo; Poor Um-Pig burst into  tears at the memory of the dreadful day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cheer up, Um,&rdquo; Flip said,  hopping on to his friend&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound to meet them sooner or later&mdash;that  is, of course, if they were not sewn up in muslin bags and hung up to &lsquo;cure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t bear it,&rdquo;  Um-Pig sobbed. &ldquo;And, by the way, get off my back. Your cold clammy feet give me  the shudders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s your turn to carry him,&rdquo;  Chum said with a laugh. &ldquo;You know he has no shoes and we all have to take our  turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we&rsquo;d never frightened  Smell away,&rdquo; Um-Pig grunted. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;d never come near me,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop arguing!&rdquo; Angelina ordered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you remember what Who&rsquo;s Who said about kindness, and if we are not kind to one  another our shoes will start to hurt, and then where will we be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, make him sit down and keep  still. This hopping about from one spot to another on my back makes me cold all  over. If he stays in one place it&rsquo;s not so bad, as the other places keep warm,&rdquo;  Um-Pig grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so bristly I can&rsquo;t keep  still,&rdquo; Flip complained. &ldquo;Every time I hop I land on a bristle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; Angelina said  sternly, grabbing Flip by a leg. &ldquo;Sit in my pouch and stop quarrelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t bend so much when you  spring&mdash;it squashes me up,&rdquo; Flip retorted.</p>
<p>Angelina promptly cuffed him over  the head, and ended any further arguments that may have been developing in his  froggy head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will we find your baby,  Angelina? Do you think it is very near?&rdquo; Chum asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we&rsquo;re nearly there; over by  that clump of rocks and scrub I lost him. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s waiting. Let us hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelina breathed excitedly as she  took extra large leaps. &ldquo;Did he run away?&rdquo; Chum asked, rushing along as fast as  his shoes would carry him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! My dear little Joey would  never do that,&rdquo; Angelina replied. &lsquo;&lsquo;One evening we were playing in and out the  rocks, while the dear little fellow was learning to jump, and I was so excited  and happy that I did not notice a man creeping up with his gun. Oh dear! it was  terrible. Bang! went the gun and my poor little baby fell over the rocks&mdash;dead,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cruel of the man,&rdquo; Chum said,  shocked almost beyond words, &ldquo;Will we find him dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, no!&rdquo; Angelina  smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve passed the place on the road where he would have been dead.  We&rsquo;re going to the place where we used to romp, and there I&rsquo;ll find him alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will my wife and piglets be there  too?&rdquo; Um-Pig asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely,&rdquo; Angelina answered. &ldquo;How  many piglets were there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really forget,&rdquo; Um-Pig  answered, with a worried frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife was always bringing new  ones home, and they&rsquo;d just begin to reach the interesting stage when they&rsquo;d  disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never see them again&mdash;they&rsquo;re  bacon and eggs now,&rdquo; Flip said, popping his head out of Angelina&rsquo;s pouch as far  as it would go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be quiet!&rdquo; Angelina said,  poking his head in again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that on top of the rock  over there?&rdquo; Chum cried, pointing to a small animal hopping about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my Joey! My little Joey!&rdquo;  Angelina cried with joy, and bounding through the air she reached the rock in a  few moments.</p>
<p>Such a greeting took place.  Angelina hugging and squeezing her baby while Chum and Um-Pig jumped for joy,  Um-Pig looked very comical as his fat podgy little legs hopped about in a most  amazing manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll place you in my pouch where  you&rsquo;ll be safe,&rdquo; Angelina said, picking Joey up by the scruff of his neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take you all the way back to Long Ago where there are no guns.&rdquo; And so saying  she popped Joey in her pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the sake of all the frogs in  Tim-buck-too let me out!&rdquo; Flip cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smothered and squashed to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mummy! Mummy! Take me out,&rdquo;  little Joey called. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something kicking me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul, I forgot Flip was  in there,&rdquo; Angelina exclaimed. &ldquo;Out you come you nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flip appeared slightly flattened  and gasping for breath. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never put me in your kitchen again,&rdquo; he said  crossly, blinking his large eyes at Angelina.</p>
<h2 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page031.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="545" height="750"></h2>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>All this trouble and commotion  caused a serious delay, and with a word of advice to Flip upon the way a frog  should behave Angelina gave the word to advance.</p>
<p>Another hill was climbed and the  top reached from where the travellers gazed down on more grass lands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; Chum inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place is Forty Years Ago,&rdquo;  Angelina replied. &ldquo;How pretty everything looks,&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few old grey houses sat on the  grassy slopes. Wisps of smoke straggled upwards from the chimneys, giving the  houses a most contented look. There was nothing gay about them. They had passed  through the ups and downs of many years, and were now happy to sit there, just  opening their windows during the sunshine, and closing them at night when the  air grew chilly. Horses trudged homewards with the ploughs. No motor tractors  disturbed the peace here, and cattle lay contentedly on Mother Earth&rsquo;s carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think my wife and children  will be here?&rdquo; Um-Pig asked. He had been so patient as he trotted along, and  now it seemed to him that the time must be near when he&rsquo;d meet his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask at this farm-house,&rdquo;  Chum said as they neared an old home overgrown with creepers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask,&rdquo; Um-Pig said nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chum replied.</p>
<p>The strange little companions went  through the gate and up the pathway to the door of the house.</p>
<p>Chum knocked softly on the door.  It was opened by an old woman in a grey shawl and white bonnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; Chum said, as he  saw the startled look on the old woman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness me!&rdquo; she exclaimed,  raising her hands in surprise. &ldquo;What is this? Are you a circus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are travellers on the road  to Long Ago,&rdquo; Chum said, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;e looking for Mrs. Um-Pig, Have you seen her  anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bridget down in the sty.  Would it be her?&rdquo; the old woman asked. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s not for sale. We&rsquo;re fattening  her for market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig caught his breath with  fear. If it was his wife he&rsquo;d have to rescue her. His tail curled and uncurled  with agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we have a look at her?&rdquo;  Angelina suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Well, maybe you can. There&rsquo;s no  harm in that,&rdquo; the old woman replied. &ldquo;Come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the way through the house.  The table in the kitchen was set for tea. A bowl of junket and a large plate of  pancakes made the visitors&rsquo; eyes gleam,</p>
<p>&ldquo;They smell good,&rdquo; Flip remarked,  and instantly received a pinch from Angelina. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you behave?&rdquo; she whispered  between her teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the old lady said,  placing her hand to her ear as she was slightly deaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only said we&rsquo;re all starving  and I wish you&rsquo;d ask us to tea,&rdquo; Flip replied, looking defiantly at Angelina  and hopping out of her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rude!&rdquo; Chum and Um-Pig  said in one breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay to tea. I&rsquo;ll be very  pleased,&rdquo; the old woman replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any hundreds and  thousands?&rdquo; Chum politely asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; the old woman replied.  &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re all in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bit dippy!&rdquo; Flip  exclaimed in a low whisper to Um-Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you speak?&rdquo; the old woman  asked, looking from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Have you any flies, or pork  pies?&rdquo; Flip spoke at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>Poor Um-Pig turned very pale at  the mention of pork pies, and Chum rushed for a chair, placing him on it and  fanning him with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow. He looks very seedy,&rdquo;  the old woman remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my smelling-salts.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t do that please,&rdquo; Angelina  said, &ldquo;He had the greatest trouble getting rid of his smell. We really couldn&rsquo;t  stand any more of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig became paler and paler,  while his nose lost its fresh pink look altogether. He closed his eyes and  prepared to swoon, &ldquo;Quick! Quick!&rdquo; Angelina cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fainting.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page035.jpg" alt="fainting" width="606" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;He needs air!&rdquo; Flip remarked. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t  any one a fan?&rdquo; Like lightning Angelina grabbed a pancake and began flapping it  in front of Um-Pig. She fanned and fanned until the colour gradually  reappeared in the patient&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How distressing!&rdquo; the old woman  remarked kindly. &ldquo;Does he get those turns often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Angelina replied. &ldquo;But for  goodness sake don&rsquo;t mention anything about pork to him. He&rsquo;s very sensitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have a cup of tea. That  will make him feel better,&rdquo; the old woman said as she helped Um-Pig to the  table. &ldquo;Sit down and help yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a clatter and jabbering  ensued as the little people drew their chairs to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I have a little junket for  Joey?&rdquo; Angelina asked very nicely. The bowl was pushed across the table towards  her, whereupon she dipped her paw in it and then offered her paw to Joey to lick.</p>
<p>Chum feasted on pancakes, while  Um-Pig just sipped his cup of tea between deep grunts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off his oats,&rdquo; Flip remarked  loudly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be off your chair in a  minute if you don&rsquo;t behave,&rdquo; Angelina threatened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any good recipes?&rdquo; the  old woman asked Chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know how to make boiled  eggs,&rdquo; Chum replied proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I mean recipes&rdquo; the old  woman said hastily. &ldquo;You know&mdash;thing&rsquo;s to eat for supper. My husband will be  home soon, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to cook his supper all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you making?&rdquo; Chum asked,  anxious to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t turned into anything  yet. I don&rsquo;t know whether to fry it or grill it,&rdquo; the old woman said in a  worried voice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d boil it if I were you,&rdquo; Chum  advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a thing are you  trying to make?&rdquo; Angelina inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toad in a hole!&rdquo; the old woman  answered.</p>
<p>Yip! A loud creak that sounded  very like a scream came from Flip. He sprang in the air with fright and came  down splash&mdash; right in the middle of the junket bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pigs and frogs!&rdquo; the old woman  exclaimed in horror, while chairs were tipped over as every one tried to rush  from the table. Joey fell out of his mother&rsquo;s pouch, was quickly grabbed and  poked in again, while Um-Pig caught one of his legs in the table-cloth,  dragging everything on to the floor&mdash;Flip and the junket included.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear&mdash;dear&mdash;&rdquo; the old woman  exclaimed when she had recovered from the shock, &ldquo;this is most upsetting,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; Chum  said politely.</p>
<p>Flip in the meanwhile had hopped  outside, as he feared the look in Angelina&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see Bridget before we go?&rdquo;  Um-Pig asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. We were on our  way to see her when the tea-party took place,&rdquo; the old woman said, bustling  through the doorway, She took a lantern down from a nail on the wall, lit it,  and showed the way down to Bridget&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s your  wife,&rdquo; Chum said as they drew near the sty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Um-Pig asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this pig is a very common  one,&rdquo; Chum replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Um-Pig asked again, looking  very puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you notice anything?&rdquo; Chum  asked, feeling very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, do you?&rdquo; Um-Pig replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What colour was your wife?&rdquo; Chum  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful pale pink,&rdquo; Um-Pig  said proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not her, A  beautiful pale pink pig would have a beautiful pale pink&mdash;smell.&rdquo; Chum whispered  the last word very quietly until it sounded very small.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh! I understand,&rdquo; Um-Pig said,  sniffing the air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not her now. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s a black pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo; the old woman said,  raising her lantern over the sty. &ldquo;Bridget, I&rsquo;ve a surprise for you. Your  husband has come to see you,&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud raucous grunt came from the  sty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll come any closer,&rdquo;  Um-Pig said nervously. &ldquo;My wife hadn&rsquo;t a grunt like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another grunt came from the sty  louder than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to see you,&rdquo; the old  lady said. &ldquo;Do come and say something to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Flip croaked, and before  any one could stop him he had hopped on to the rails of the sty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Mrs. Um-Pig, and it&rsquo;s  time you were made into pork and beans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; every one gasped, while  grunt after grunt came from the sty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us run away,&rdquo; Um-Pig  whispered to Chum and Angelina. It needed no second bidding, as already the  little people were running and hopping towards the gate. Outside Angelina  paused. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t run away like this. We must go back and thank the dear old  woman for giving us our supper,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate junket and I&rsquo;m not going  back,&rdquo; Flip remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor me!&rdquo; Um-Pig rejoined. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t feel well, and besides &mdash;she might make me look at that pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back and thank her,&rdquo; Chum  said. &ldquo;Wait for me. I won&rsquo;t be a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back to the cottage door he ran  and tapped lightly.</p>
<p>The old woman opened it,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much indeed for  the nice supper,&rdquo; Chum smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was glad of the company,&rdquo; the  old woman replied. &ldquo;When you call again do bring me a recipe of seedy-cake.  I&rsquo;ve lost mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get one in Long Ago for you,&rdquo;  Chum answered, and waving good-bye hurried down the pathway to his friends. All  night long they travelled the road, passing the fifty-years post towards dawn.  Many possums came out from the trees to peer at the strangers. They were happy  little creatures, unafraid and trusting, for back in Fifty Years Ago man had  not been so ruthless, or perhaps he was too busy farming his land to take much  notice of little possums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will we meet the koalas?&rdquo;  Angelina inquired of one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not far from here,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If  you go to the sixty-years land you&rsquo;ll meet many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet all my friends there  too,&rdquo; Angelina said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find shelter and food as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Junket and Mrs. Um-Pig?&rdquo; Flip  inquired.</p>
<p>A stony silence greeted his  remark.</p>
<p>Flocks of sheep grazed on the  country-side, while the birds in the trees sang for the very joy of being  alive. No bird cages and traps were along the road to Sixty Years Ago. The  kookaburras laughed their loudest, the magpies carolled, the wee finches came  close to the travellers, looking at them most inquisitively. And now&mdash;here were  the koalas. Dear little things, peeping out of the tall gum-trees, with the  most surprised looks on their faces. They had never seen a little boy before,  and came closer to have a good look at the stranger.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page041.jpg" alt="koalas" width="597" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Who&rsquo;s Who&rsquo;s friends?&rdquo;  Chum inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the kind friend we  knew many years ago?&rdquo; one little koala asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Chum answered. &ldquo;He told me  to tell you to go back to Long Ago, Never come any nearer, as man with his guns  will kill you &ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what has happened to all  our children?&rdquo; the little koala asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them have been killed. A  few are in places called zoos and parks&mdash;but none are left in the bush,&rdquo; Chum  replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were so many! Surely our  children, who were so harmless, could not have been killed,&rdquo; the little koala  said, grasping the limb of the tree very firmly as he peered into Chum&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were such stupid men,&rdquo; Chum  said sadly. &ldquo;They called it &lsquo;sport&rsquo; to shoot your children. Now they are sorry,  so take Who&rsquo;s Who&rsquo;s advice and hide in Long Ago,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we go back farther we will  meet the bush-fire, so I think we&rsquo;ll stay here a little longer until it passes  by,&rdquo; the little koala replied. &ldquo;All the bush folk will be coming this way  shortly for shelter. It is a dreadful fire.&rdquo; </p>

  The Bush Fire</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page044.jpg" alt="fire" width="337" height="200"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the koala say something about  a bush fire?&rdquo; Angelina asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Isn&rsquo;t it terrible&mdash;what will  we do?&rdquo; Chum said in a frightened voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll dig in,&rdquo; Flip remarked; &ldquo;but  what will we do with Um-Pig? I don&rsquo;t like crackling; perhaps Chum does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time to be cheeky,  Flip,&rdquo; Angelina said crossly. &ldquo;We must hurry on to the river and lie in the  water until the fire passes over. Poor little Joey will be so frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I carry him for you?&rdquo; Chum  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s safer in my pouch.  He will have protection there,&rdquo; Angelina said.</p>
<p>Um-Pig hurried along with his  companions, all eager to reach the river in time for safety. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Over the hills a great pall of smoke hung low  in the sky.</p>
<p>Sparks and flames shot up reddening  the clouds, and great trees crashed to the earth with a mighty roar.</p>
<p>The air was suffocating,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, hurry,&rdquo; Angelina cried as  they raced along.</p>
<p>The river was not far away, but  every moment seemed a very long time to the frightened little people.</p>
<p>At last, reaching the river-bank,  Chum fell on his knees, too tired to go any farther. Just for a moment he  rested as the great flames across the water crept nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly Chum! Follow me,&rdquo;  Angelina panted.</p>
<p>Um-Pig trotted and galloped as  fast as he could, while Flip hopped by mistake on to his back instead of on to  Chum&rsquo;s shoulder, as he had intended to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your crackling&rsquo;s getting hot!&rdquo; he  exclaimed with a loud croak.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page045.jpg" alt="hot" width="700" height="560"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Um-Pig gave a frightened squeal  and fell head over heels into the river. Fortunately the river was shallow, so  he just lay there on his back, his four legs in the air, grunting deeply as the  cool water ran over his body.</p>
<p>Flip, of course, was glad to be in  the water, and dived down into a crevice between two rocks.</p>
<p>Chum and Angelina crouched down in  a pool, Joey was safe in his mother&rsquo;s pouch.</p>
<p>To those of you who have never  seen a bush fire it will be hard to imagine the terror of such a scene, and the  anguish that accompanies it. Both for animals and birds. We will say nothing  about the feelings of human beings, for they, at least, can usually find some  means of escape. But just picture, if you can, thousands of birds racing ahead  of the flames, leaving their nests and babies behind; animals, in hundreds,  fleeing with pathetic eyes from the horror. Wallabies and kangaroos are the  most fortunate, and the emu too, for they at a pinch can run and hop at fifty  or sixty miles an hour. A bush fire with the wind behind it will travel at  alarming speed, especially over grassy plains. What chance have the koalas and  possums in such an event as this? The poor wombats dig their tunnels a little  deeper and take cover until the fire is past; but then, when that danger is  over, where are they to look for food? Everything has been burnt, A few roots may  be dug up certainly, but that is poor fare. The snakes and lizards crawl under  rocky ledges, mostly to be roasted alive, while the insects die in millions. If  you understand a little of the terrors of the bush fire you will realize the  feelings of Chum, Angelina and Co. There, in the midst of the heat and smoke,  they looked towards the other side of the river, watching the flames advancing  at terrific speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must lie down in the water as  soon as the fire reaches the other bank,&rdquo; Angelina said quietly. &ldquo;It may not  cross the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as she finished speaking,  above the roar of the flames another noise could be heard. Thump! thump! thump!</p>
<p>It came nearer and nearer. Then  suddenly&mdash;dozens and dozens of wallabies and kangaroos bounded into the river.  Dingoes came too&mdash;howling pathetically&mdash;and even a few little koalas and possums.  Flocks of parrots flew overhead. They were safe. Their screeching told of the  terror in their hearts. The animals cried with fright, pushing and jostling one  another in vain attempts to find safety. They waded across the shallow waters  until they surrounded Chum and Angelina. Um-Pig scrambled to his feet,  astonished beyond grunts to find himself in the centre of strange animals. A  pale pink pig surrounded by coughing and jabbering creatures was a strange  sight; but none seemed to notice the pig, so great was their terror. Flip  peeped out from between the rocks and puffed up a few bubbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This being a frog is not so bad  after all,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Now, what if I&rsquo;d been a pound of butter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelina was very worried, for  little Joey felt the heat in her pouch, and scratched impatiently to hop out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;for  just a little while longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so stuffy in here,&rdquo; Joey  wailed; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t I just poke my nose out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him poke his nose out,&rdquo; Chum  pleaded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful to be in bed with hot blankets over you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Angelina said with a stern  look in her eyes. &ldquo;If I let him poke his nose out, that means his paws come  next, then his tail and all of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well; you know best,&rdquo;  Chum said with a sigh as he looked at the kicks in Angelina&rsquo;s pouch; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m  afraid he&rsquo;ll burst you if you don&rsquo;t. Are you done up with hooks and eyes or  zippers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Angelina  replied, with a worried look at her pouch; &ldquo;but I wish I had a sheet of brown  paper and string with me at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever for?&rdquo; Chum exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wrap Joey up in it,&rdquo; Angelina  replied impatiently.</p>
<p>An extra large kick from her pouch  caused her to hop with surprise, and then&mdash;out bounded Joey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out! He&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; Chum called  in alarm.</p>
<p>Angelina made a swift swoop with  her paw, grabbing Joey just as he was preparing to jump again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the trying children,&rdquo; she  sighed. &ldquo;What <i>am</i> I to do?&rdquo; </p>
<p>At that moment, when everything  seemed to be at its very worst, a loud clamour arose from the animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; Chum cried,  clapping&rsquo;his hands. &ldquo;The fire is turning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could it be true? Yes, it was  turning. As so often happens, the wind had changed round in the opposite  direction, and slowly but surely, the fire was creeping back from where it  came, licking up the few remaining green things it had missed in its mad rush  towards the river. It appeared like some hungry dragon, turning to devour the  victims that had eluded its grasp in its first awful swoop.</p>
<p>Excitement broke out among all the  animals. They were saved. Not understanding why or how the wonderful happening  had taken place, they leaped in and out of the water, knocking each other over  in their joy.</p>
<p>Um-Pig stood dazed, in a pool that  reached his knees (or knuckles we say when alluding to pork, but don&rsquo;t let him  hear you). This hopping and bounding over his head and body made him feel quite  giddy, and his tail seemed to be quite uncomfortable as it curled and uncurled  like a corkscrew.</p>
<p>Chum and Angelina came running  down to where he stood, Joey held tightly down in the pouch again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Um-Pig?&rdquo; Chum asked.</p>
<p>Um-Pig grunted weakly as he  struggled out of the water. Close on his heels came Flip, as fresh and cool as  any frog could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like cooked ham to me!&rdquo;  Flip remarked, eyeing Um-Pig all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;Please don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo;  Um-Pig wailed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we&rsquo;d left you with Who&rsquo;s  Who,&rdquo; Angelina remarked, frowning at Flip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been the rudest frog all the  time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us pretend he&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo;  Chum said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very good idea,&rdquo; Angelina  answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are we going on again?&rdquo;  Um-Pig asked, anxious to get away from the crowd of strange animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go on for some time,&rdquo;  Angelina answered. &ldquo;The ground will be too hot to travel over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who wants to eat grilled  pig&rsquo;s trotters?&rdquo; Flip shouted rudely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we do something to stop  him?&rdquo; Chum asked, patting Um-Pig&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he was not on the  other side of the river when the wind changed,&rdquo; Angelina remarked, &ldquo;then he  would have been left cross-eyed, or his eyes would have turned inside out&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be handy,&rdquo; Flip said  coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be able to see what the flies were doing that I swallowed for  lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to him again,&rdquo; Chum  said, turning his head away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t sit here for days and  days,&rdquo; Um-Pig said wisely. &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Chum exclaimed. &ldquo;We can  follow the river down to the edge of the fire and then continue our journey.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; the little  people cried together; Flip also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>not</i> coming with us,&rdquo; Chum said crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i>,&rdquo; Flip replied. &ldquo;You just wait and see.&rdquo; With a hop he splashed  back in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly&mdash;let&rsquo;s go while he&rsquo;s away,&rdquo;  Um-Pig said with a relieved look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Who&rsquo;s Who wouldn&rsquo;t like  us to leave him behind,&rdquo; Angelina said in a worried voice, &ldquo;but he deserves it.  Anyway, we can&rsquo;t wait for him, so he&rsquo;ll have to stay there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody noticed what was hopping to  Chum&rsquo;s coat as it lay on the grass behind him, and in fact it was nearly  forgotten in the excitement of starting. It was a new coat that Grandpa had  given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you taking your coat?&rdquo;  Um-Pig asked Chum as they made a start. He was a thoughtful old pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I nearly forgot it,&rdquo;  Chum said picking it up. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t need it, I&rsquo;d much rather run without a  coat on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would be kind enough  to loan it to me. I&rsquo;ve a headache,&rdquo; Um-Pig remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may have it,&rdquo; Chum  said kindly. &ldquo;Wait a moment while I spread it over your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig stood patiently while Chum  arranged the coat, tying the sleeves underneath his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do look sweet. It suits you  beautifully,&rdquo; he said, patting the coat down at the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most restful,&rdquo; Um-Pig  replied with gratitude, &ldquo;although it&rsquo;s a little bit heavy on one side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ve a bigger headache  on that side,&rdquo; Chum remarked sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you have an  aspro?&rdquo; Um-Pig inquired. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who used to take them when his thinking made  his head ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Chum replied.  &lsquo;&lsquo;Grandpa used up all he had before I left&mdash;and besides, I&rsquo;ve never had a  headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better when you get  away from this smoke and heat,&rdquo; Angelina said cheerfully. &ldquo;Now, are we ready?  Well, let us start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig gave a last look at the  river where Flip had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave without  him, although he&rsquo;s been so rude to me,&rdquo; he said with a catch in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be quite happy there,&rdquo; Chum  replied. &ldquo;He has all the river to himself and lots and lots to eat,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo;  Angelina chimed in. &ldquo;He would be a bad influence for Joey later on. I must  think of his future, and he&rsquo;d be sure to pick up all Flip&rsquo;s rude remarks. My  word&mdash;if Joey ever told me I looked like cooked ham, I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelina was beyond further words,  so bounded away in great haste. She was &ldquo;all worked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away the little people went, down  the river, following its course for many miles, until the edge of the fire was  reached. Farther on they went, looking for a shallow place to cross. </p>
<p>A strange noise attracted their  attention. It was ahead, still farther down the river. Voices rose every now  and again, then the sound of tin cans. Tin cans could be doing anything, as  their noise is always a mystery until it is explained. Then it is a simple  matter as a rule, with a big noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever can it mean?&rdquo; Chum  asked, his eyes very wide open with surprise.</p>
<p>The voices became louder as the  little travellers advanced&mdash; men&rsquo;s voices&mdash;some laughing&mdash;some growling, but all  in a feverish excitement by the sound of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide Joey,&rdquo; Chum whispered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re  men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, how dreadful,&rdquo; Angelina  sighed. &ldquo;Where can we be? I thought we&rsquo;d left men behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nags too!&rdquo; cried Flip, as he  hopped from the pocket of Chum&rsquo;s coat and landed in front of Um-Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul!&rdquo; Angelina cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shiver my timbers!&rsquo;&rsquo; Chum  laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I had a badder headache  one side,&rdquo; Um-Pig said mournfully, looking at Flip.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page055.jpg" alt="badder" width="597" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fine view from the  pocket, and it&rsquo;s a very comfortable place to sit in,&rdquo; Flip croaked loudly. &ldquo;But  I got sick of looking over Um-Pig&rsquo;s nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to put  up with you again,&rdquo; Angelina said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not riding in the coat  again,&rdquo; Um-Pig growled and grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, I&rsquo;m off to see  the prospectors,&rdquo; Flip replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prospectors!&rdquo; Angelina said with  surprise. &ldquo;Have we travelled so far? Why! We&rsquo;re in Eighty Years Ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prospectors!&rdquo; Chum repeated. &ldquo;Why,  what are they, Angelina?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the men who hunt for  gold&mdash;goodness knows why. They can&rsquo;t eat it,&rdquo; Angelina said with a sniff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could have a look  at them? I&rsquo;d love to see &lsquo;prospectors,&rsquo;&rdquo; Chum said with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could creep along the  river-bank very quietly, and see what they&rsquo;re doing. But don&rsquo;t cough or sneeze,  as they&rsquo;d chase us at once if they saw us,&rdquo; Angelina replied. Quietly creeping  along the bank through the undergrowth the travellers drew nearer and nearer to  the prospectors. Then, turning a bend of the river, the whole busy scene lay  before them. Hundreds of men were working, digging among the rocks, shovelling  dirt into tin dishes they held in their hands, then washing it in the water.  Intense interest seemed to surround this last process, as men gazed earnestly  into the dishes when the washing was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy looking at mud!&rdquo; Um-Pig  said with a scornful grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d rather bathe in it I suppose,&rdquo;  Flip remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t start again, <i>please</i>,&rdquo; Angelina sighed, &ldquo;Besides,  they&rsquo;re not looking for mud. They&rsquo;re looking for gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Occasionally a man threw his hat  into the air and called out at the top of his voice: &ldquo;Luck! Luck! Gold!&rdquo; Then a  mad scramble ensued. All rushed to look in the dish. Some laughed, some  growled, then turned back to their own picks and shovels with more haste than  ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so silly to me!&rdquo; Chum  exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa has told me about these  men. He said some became very rich; but they did not keep their riches. They  wasted them thinking they could go back and find more gold. He said many of  them were disappointed and decided to give up gold-digging and farm the land  instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was your Grandpa a farmer?&rdquo;  Um-Pig inquired curiously, screwing up one eye and looking at Chum intently  with the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was,&rdquo; Chum replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t mention his name  again, please,&rdquo; Um-Pig said shortly. &ldquo;My wife and I and the piglets belonged to  a farmer once, and I have very vivid recollections of that farmer&rsquo;s fat face  looking at me over the walls of our sty for hours at a time, sometimes  discussing us with a neighbour. I became sick of it all. They talked and talked  and gazed and gazed,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Chum inquired,</p>
<p>Um-Pig gave a disgusted grunt, &ldquo;What  for! Why, I&rsquo;d hear these words, &lsquo;That one over there in the corner is a fine  porker, and the one next to him will bring a few shillings.&rsquo; I <i>knew</i> what that meant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Chum asked, full of  curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bacon and eggs!&rdquo; Flip croaked  rudely.</p>
<p>Ignoring his remark Um-Pig said in  a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It meant a bereavement in our  family,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful,&rdquo; Chum murmured  sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a bereavement?&rdquo; Flip  asked, appearing to be very interested in the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means someone is dead,&rdquo; Chum  explained. &ldquo;When Grandma died people called her deceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>knew</i> pigs were diseased,&rdquo; Flip said, with a satisfied look on his  face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D-e-c-e-a-s-e-d&mdash;&rdquo; Chum replied  angrily. &ldquo;Hop away or I&rsquo;ll pinch you where your tail ought to be&mdash;then you&rsquo;ll  hop,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could get rid of him,&rdquo;  Um-Pig sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better hurry on our way  instead of quarrelling,&rdquo; Angelina remarked, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ll find ourselves lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will we cross the river?&rdquo;  Chum inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be a bridge  somewhere near,&rdquo; Angelina replied. &ldquo;Men always build bridges as soon as they  come to a river,&rdquo;</p>
<p>So farther on the little  travellers walked, very quietly, watching the men as they went, fearful lest  they should make the slightest noise and attract attention.</p>
<p>It was just as Angelina said. As  they left the gold-diggers behind, many tents came into view, and a small  bridge made from rough logs spanned the river in front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see us crossing the  bridge,&rdquo; Chum said in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are all too busy looking  for gold,&rdquo; Angelina replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cross now, before they come to their tents  for tea,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very carefully they crossed, one  by one. It was an easy matter for them all, except Um-Pig. His feet slipped  this way and that, causing the others to hold their breath in alarm. He seemed  to make such a clatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity he hasn&rsquo;t rubber tyres on  his trotters!&rdquo; Flip said as he hopped over Um-Pig&rsquo;s back and landed right in  front of him, giving Um-Pig such a fright, that he very nearly lost his balance  and toppled over into the river.</p>
<p>Chum and Angelina waited on the  river-bank, having crossed safely, and were now softly calling advice to  Um-Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at the water. Look  straight ahead, then you won&rsquo;t get giddy,&rdquo; Chum advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your tail for a balance,&rdquo;  Angelina called. But Um-Pig&rsquo;s tail was too busy twirling this way and that to  hear the advice. It seemed to be very agitated, while the look on its owner&rsquo;s  face was enough to frighten ten tails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, come on!&rdquo; Angelina  said rather impatiently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get on at this rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig made a desperate spurt, and  with a loud grunt stumbled off the end of the bridge and fell with a thud on  the grass. No! not in the river as I am sure you all expected.</p>
<p>It was a great relief to all, now  that the ordeal was over, and full of good spirits they proceeded up the track  and past the men&rsquo;s tents. But danger lay ahead. The last tent happened to  belong to the cook, and sounds very disquieting came from that direction. A  knife was being sharpened. Smoke curled up from a fire outside the tent door,  and a large black pot hung over the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t breathe!&rdquo; Angelina  whispered, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ll all be wallaby soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself!&rdquo; Flip  whispered back, hopping behind Angelina so that he could not be seen. Angelina  was overcome with rage. She gave one of her hind legs a terrific kick and sent  Mr Flip flying through the air, only to land on Um-Pig&rsquo;s back &ldquo;Oh! Oh! Save me!&rdquo;  Um-Pig squealed. He had no idea what had happened and became quite unnerved.</p>
<p>Um-Pig&rsquo;s squeal of distress was  disastrous.</p>
<p>The cook poked his head out of the  tent; his eyes nearly fell out with amazement at the sight in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if this doesn&rsquo;t beat the  band!&rdquo; he exclaimed, coming out into the open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little boy, a wallaby, a frog,  and a <i>PIG!</i> Won&rsquo;t the boys be  delighted with their dinner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wallaby-tail soup! Frog&rsquo;s legs <i>and</i> roast pork! Now&mdash;if only I had a few  apples for sauce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> kill them!&rdquo; Chum protested loudly, &ldquo;They are my friends and  they&rsquo;re taking me home to Long Ago,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rsquo;&rsquo; the cook  exclaimed. &ldquo;Whoever saw a little boy with such strange friends&mdash;and Long Ago,  where is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away over the hills,&rdquo; Angelina  said very excitedly. She&rsquo;d poked Joey right down as far as he&rsquo;d go in her  pouch,</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing way back there,&rdquo;  the cook said scornfully, &ldquo;only miles and miles of timber and a few rough  roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know, and that&rsquo;s where  we have to go,&rdquo; Angelina cried. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who told us about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who!&rdquo; the cook said,  looking more bewildered than ever. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re all a bit mad&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I  think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad yourself!&rdquo; Flip  croaked, as he hopped right m front of the cook.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page065.jpg" alt="cook" width="646" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the cook roared. &ldquo;<i>You</i>, an impudent frog, to talk to me  like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And stretching out his big boot he  tried to squash Flip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fidgets!&rdquo; Flip exclaimed, as he  hopped in the air just a second too soon for the big boot. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad  tempered man.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat you myself when I catch  you,&rdquo; the cook yelled as he grabbed empty spaces where Flip had been a moment  before. Away he raced, round the back of the tent and into the undergrowth,  quite forgetting in his rage Chum, Angelina, and Um-Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly! Quickly! Let us run,&rdquo;  Chum said, terrified at the thought of what might happen to them when the cook  came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your trotters,&rdquo; Angelina said  excitedly to Um-Pig, &ldquo;and for goodness sake don&rsquo;t stumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As fast as ever a pig could run,  Um-Pig did. Chum and Angelina raced ahead in a breathless flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bump so much,&rdquo; Joey  whimpered from inside his mother&rsquo;s pouch; but Angelina was too frightened to  take notice of his complaints.</p>
<p>Um-Pig panted along behind,  crashing into bushes and trees, until all were thoroughly exhausted and flung  themselves on the ground for rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; Angelina  gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about poor Flip?&rdquo; Chum said  with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll take care he&rsquo;s not caught,&rdquo;  Angelina replied. &ldquo;Flip will be here soon, if I know anything about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Flip was having a  most exciting time. In and out of the bushes he hopped, closely pursued by the  cook, who used the most dreadful words Flip had ever heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bake you to a cinder when I  catch you,&rdquo; he roared as he fell headlong over a stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you do!&rdquo; Flip called back  cheekily, as he made straight back to the river. By the time the cook had  regained his feet and breath, Flip was safely under the water. There he lay  until night-fall, puffing up a few bubbles now and then, and occasionally  poking his head out of the water to see if all was clear. The cook still walked  around his tent and fire, looking over his shoulder every few minutes, and  growling loudly. All his fine menu had vanished, and all through a frog!</p>
<p>As night fell, Flip hopped out of  the water and up to the cook&rsquo;s tent. At a safe distance he stood and looked  inside. There stood the cook, a big knife in his hand, demonstrating to a  number of men how he would have killed a fat pig for supper.</p>
<p>Roars of laughter greeted his  actions, and Flip, bursting with merriment, croaked his very loudest. Out  dashed the cook, waving his knife as he came, followed by all the men, who were  anxious to see the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slippery legs! I&rsquo;ll get you for  supper, and if it&rsquo;s too late I&rsquo;ll get you for breakfast.&rdquo; But it was too dark  for the cook to follow Flip. He raged and made a fearful noise, and produced  nothing.</p>
<p>Flip went like the wind. Things  were just a little too exciting for him, and following the trail through the  bush, chiefly made by Um-Pig, he came upon his friends, who were by now in a  state of grief. So long it seemed to them that Flip had been away, that all  thought the same thing&mdash;he had been cooked for dinner.</p>
<p>With a last extra springy hop,  intending to land on Um-Pig&rsquo;s back of course, he misjudged his distance,  probably on account of puffing so hard all the way, and to his own surprise  landed on Um-Pig&rsquo;s tail, which happened to be curled at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Um-Pig screamed. &ldquo;My tail&rsquo;s  unhooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky it&rsquo;s still <i>uncooked</i>!&rdquo; Flip croaked, and he grinned  at Chum and Angelina who stood open-mouthed, too surprised to say anything for  an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Flip!&rdquo; Chum said, clapping  his hands a moment later. &ldquo;We thought you were killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a relief!&rdquo; Angelina sighed  with a big breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put him in here,&rdquo; Joey  piped, popping his tiny head out of the pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for glory&rsquo;s sake <i>get off my tail!</i>&rdquo; Um-Pig growled as he  gave that part of his anatomy a savage flick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon!&rdquo; Flip replied as he  was whisked on the ground. &ldquo;I thought it was a corkscrew!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Back to Long Ago and a Surprise.</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page063.jpg" alt="eighty" width="437" height="200"></p>
<p>The little travellers were tired.  Eighty years was a long way to travel, and their little feet ached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we reach the top of this  hill we will see Long Ago in the distance,&rdquo; Angelina said as they plodded up  the steep side of a thickly timbered hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will know us in  Long Ago?&rdquo; Chum asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been away for so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people of Long Ago don&rsquo;t  forget,&rdquo; Angelina said consolingly. &ldquo;They are so kind and thoughtful.  Everything is quiet there&mdash;no noises, no rushing, no smoke and dust, just peace  and the beautiful hills with clear streams where my friends drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words of encouragement  the little travellers pushed ahead until the top of the hill was reached. What  a wonderful sight met their eyes. At the foot of the hill a rough road wound  its way through the tall trees. Over ground that rose sharply and then fell  away in a flowing curtsy, the road ran on. Through open spaces that rolled and  swelled on a velvety covering of green, dappled with brown and ochre. On and on  the road ran, sometimes lost to view as it greeted the tall trees of the  forest, then plunging ahead through a curtain of dense purple and green it  suddenly reappeared, dipping farther away into a silver stream that twinkled in  the sunlight. A violet haze on the horizon gradually enveloped the road and  there, all mystery, lay Long Ago.</p>
<p>Standing on top of the hill, the  little group looked pathetic and strange. It was such a big world to gaze upon,  and each wondered what wonderful things lay ahead. Would Angelina meet her  friends, or had they gone farther back, perhaps into Very Long Ago. That would  be sad, after travelling so far. And would little Chum meet his mother and  father? They must have missed him and had probably grown tired of looking and  waiting for him. Um-Pig had his own private thoughts. They were very private,  so we won&rsquo;t probe into those piggy thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they still have a few  mosquitoes and flies left,&rdquo; Flip said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time for  fly-papers and sprays. The people in Who&rsquo;s Who&rsquo;s land never think of frogs.  Sprays! You&rsquo;ve no idea how a fly tastes after it&rsquo;s been sprayed. Have you tried  one?&rdquo; Flip looked at Chum with a worried frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t want  to,&rdquo; Chum said shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have you tasted a mosquito  that&rsquo;s been living in a pool all puddled up with kerosene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t; and please don&rsquo;t  ask me any more stupid questions,&rdquo; Chum replied, giving Flip a push.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re ghastly!&rdquo; he croaked. &ldquo;I  feel I want to be sick just on this patch of grass when I think of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig jumped up with a startled  squeal from the particular patch of grass that Flip had his eyes on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  disgusting!&rdquo; Um-Pig growled, looking maliciously at Flip. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here arguing,&rdquo;  Angelina interrupted. &ldquo;Flip, you go ahead; then perhaps we&rsquo;ll travel in  comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the rear-guard,&rdquo; Flip said,  hopping behind Um-Pig, &ldquo;and besides, I like the back view of Um-Pig&rsquo;s tail.  It&rsquo;s very inspiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Come on, leave him alone,&rdquo;  Chum said, making a dash at Flip&mdash;and he caught him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great blue-bottles!&rdquo; Flip gasped.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pinch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You impudent cold flipper!&rdquo; Chum  said crossly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay in my hands now&mdash;&rdquo; but zip!&mdash;and off hopped Flip,  croaking indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him! Leave him!&rdquo; Angelina  advised as she bounded down the hill, Chum and Um-Pig following close behind,  and the rearguard hopping as close to Um-Pig&rsquo;s feet as he dared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kick up such a dust,&rdquo; he  complained, as Um-Pig&rsquo;s feet galloped ahead.</p>
<p>The descent of the hill was rapid,  and soon the travellers found themselves close to the road.</p>
<p>Wheel-ruts in the dust caused a  little consternation to them. What could it mean? They were in Ninety Years  Ago, and from the top of the hill nothing had been seen on the road; but here  were the marks telling that somewhere ahead man was travelling, and all gaiety  fled from the little group as they peered along the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have passed many weeks  ago,&rdquo; Angelina said slowly, examining the wheel-ruts. &ldquo;There has been no rain  for some time to wash away the marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do <i>you</i> know?&rdquo; Flip inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t given us a  croaking concert since we started, and if you&rsquo;re a real frog you&rsquo;d have had to  croak whether you wanted to or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;&rdquo; Flip replied. &ldquo;My skin has  been particularly dry since we started. I always know when rain is near, as my  skin softens when the air becomes moist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your intelligence does  too!&rdquo; Um-Pig grunted.</p>
<p>Good gracious! Every one blinked  and looked at Um-Pig. What was happening to him? As a rule he could not think  of anything nasty to say&mdash;that is, in time,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Well&mdash;how about these wheel-ruts?&rdquo;  Flip said, turning the conversation from himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are past; anyway, that is  some comfort,&rdquo; Chum rejoined. &ldquo;We can follow them. Perhaps they will lead us to  Long Ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So setting out again they hurried  ahead.</p>
<p>The Ninety-five Years land was  reached, and what a surprise for the little people! Just where the road entered  the tall trees a bullock-team grazed upon the grass skirting the edge of the  forest. Farther on a man was chopping down timber to complete the rough home  that stood half-finished. Slabs of rough wood had been put up to make a shelter  for himself and his family. Openings in the side of the hut were left for  windows and doors, while the chimney was in course of erection, that being made  of mud and stones. Further slabs provided the roof. The floor was of mud. No  such things as mats and rugs gave comfort to this dwelling. It was a pioneer&rsquo;s.  A few goats straggled about, as if too timid to venture far from the man and  his home, while three little children played and sang, running in and out of  the hut, chasing one another, totally unaware that others were watching.</p>
<p>A woman came to the doorway, flung  a few grains of corn to fowls waiting expectantly, as fowls always do, then  looking up at the sky, her eyes shaded from the sun by her hand, she laughed,  turned, and re-entered the hut singing happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away. Let us go around to  the back of the hut,&rdquo; Angelina warned. &ldquo;They would make a rug of my skin, and  brushes from Um-Pig&rsquo;s bristles if they caught us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, I thought we would be  quite safe in this land,&rdquo; Chum sighed. &ldquo;I wish men didn&rsquo;t want to kill so much  and make so many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the bush they crept out of  sight, and slowly made the circuit round the clearing. Then on once more into  country that was silent and undisturbed. Flocks of parrots, families of magpies  and all other birds known so well to the bush of Long Ago greeted the little  people as they hurried on.</p>
<p>What was that strange object in  the distance? Something grey, that moved very slowly, stumbling, then going on  with a weary movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a very old friend of  mine,&rdquo; Angelina said as she stood still, watching the grey object. &ldquo;Only my  friends hop; this thing is walking,&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be my wife?&rdquo; Um-Pig  asked, as he too stopped to gaze at the curious object, raising a front leg to  shield his eyes from the glare of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Flip&rsquo;s wife grown  very large,&rdquo; Chum suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bachelor!&rdquo; Flip replied  indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s old Grandpa  come back to Long Ago,&rdquo; Chum answered.</p>
<p>The grey object sat down beside  the roadway, looking this way, then that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better hide,&rdquo; Chum said in a  frightened voice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no need to hide now,&rdquo;  Angelina replied happily. &ldquo;We are just about to enter the land of Long Ago, and  every -one is kind there. They hurt nobody. Can&rsquo;t you see how happy the birds  are, how gaily they sing, and see&mdash;there are animals all round us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was as Angelina said: animals  were everywhere. In the bush, the grass, and the trees. Flying squirrels were  very busy (it looked like shopping day as they bustled from one tree to  another), possums, koalas, wombats, wallabies, kangaroos, and the tiny  rat-kangaroo, all were to be seen. They looked at the little travellers with  curiosity and one big wallaby actually came up to Angelina and smelled her  nose. Angelina returned the compliment, then her friend hopped away.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page071.jpg" alt="returned" width="700" height="520"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you should just have seen how  funny you looked,&rdquo; Chum remarked, as he and Um-Pig looked on with amusement.  Flip was interviewing a tree frog who had a great deal to say, if croaking is  any sign of frog conversation, and of course it is.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;That was my mother-in-law,&rdquo;  Angelina explained. &ldquo;She told me my husband is still waiting for me in Long  Ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better hurry,&rdquo; Chum  said excitedly. &ldquo;He might hop away if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small grey figure slowly moved  down the road towards the travellers, until he could be distinguished. A bent  old man in grey tattered clothes, with a bunch of rosemary clasped in his withered  hands, greeted them with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome! My little friends,&rdquo; he  said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited a long, long time to greet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to see you,&rdquo; Angelina  replied. &ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Have you forgotten me? Don&rsquo;t  you remember that I&rsquo;m the Spirit of Long Ago? I wait here day after day to  greet those who come back. I read their faces, and some I have to turn away.  They have been cruel to the birds and animals while living over the hills. I  could never allow them to enter Long Ago, as we have so many bush folk there  and it is my duty to help to protect them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never hurt even a fly,&rdquo; Chum  said clasping his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever swat one?&rdquo; Flip  asked frowning at Chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so. I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t  remember exactly,&rdquo; Chum replied, fidgeting with his coat while he gazed at the  old man very earnestly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fly or two won&rsquo;t exempt you  from entering Long Ago,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I must admit flicking a few in my time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bitten one, but it was  annoying me terribly,&rdquo; Um-Pig said bravely. &ldquo;If my tail had been longer, and I  could have flicked it off, I&rsquo;d never, never have bitten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve <i>ever</i> killed a fly,&rdquo; Angelina said.</p>
<p>This interview was most  embarrassing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you, Flip?&rdquo; Chum asked,  looking at him with a &ldquo;now don&rsquo;t tell a story&rdquo; look in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-e-v-e-r! Never in my life have  I killed a fly,&rdquo; Flip replied, ogling Chum with a threatening look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-O-O-H!&rdquo; They all gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t talk about flies  any more,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;They really don&rsquo;t count, and I can see you are  all kind people. Pass along into Long Ago. You will meet all your friends  there,&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the last stage of the journey  was nearing completion. Another year passed and the little people found it to  be the last. The ninety-nineth year was entered through a gate that hung on  rickety hinges, all worn and weather-beaten, while on each side of it grew tall  bushes of rosemary. The travellers entered and found themselves in a garden of  pansies. Pansies of every colour imaginable. Over the first garden a notice hung.  In blue letters the little folk read these words:</p>
<p align="center">KIND  THOUGHTS OF LONG AGO</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301101h-images/page072.jpg" alt="99" width="592" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Um-Pig bent his head and sniffed  the flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are yon doing?&rdquo; Flip  inquired, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t smell those&mdash;they&rsquo;re most precious,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only trying to sniff some  kind thoughts of you up my nose,&rdquo; Um-Pig replied icily.</p>
<p>Farther along the pathway they  came to a garden of roses, then on to forget-me-nots.</p>
<p>Here Flip paused a moment, plucked  a bloom, and hopping up to Um-Pig offered him the flower,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you forget me,&rsquo;&rdquo;  he said meekly; but Um-Pig gave a grunt, tossed his head in the air and trotted  on.</p>
<p>The last year was now at an end,  and the little people became very quiet as they each thought of what lay behind  a high wall in front of them. It was smothered in honeysuckle, while myriads of  bees and butterflies fluttered from one bloom to another. The perfume was  exquisite. A fragrance of Long Ago itself. There was no gate; but in its place  an old, old stile, made from stones, overgrown with the greenest of moss. The  stones bore traces of age, as each huddled against its neighbour. They had been  together for a hundred years, and no gaps were visible where one might have  drawn apart from its companion as if dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Ever so gently Chum, Angelina, and  Um-Pig climbed over the stile, for to tread heavily on those stones and hurt  the moss was a thing undreamed of.</p>
<p>Flip had other ideas of crossing.  Gathering himself in a tense position, he judged the distance for a second  and&mdash;plop! he sprang right over and into Long Ago. The little people expected to  find a place as quiet as quiet could be, but to their surprise things were  quite different.</p>
<p>An old white horse stood near the  stile. He lifted his head to gaze at the visitors. It was so long since any one  had stepped over the stile. He looked at Chum, then flicking his old tail,  whinnied softly with delight and trotted up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! It&rsquo;s old Snowball!&rdquo; Chum  cried, dancing up and down with joy. &ldquo;I must get on his back; but he&rsquo;s grown so  tall. How am I to get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb on my back first,&rdquo; Angelina  said, &ldquo;then it will be an easy matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not such an easy matter to  climb on Angelina&rsquo;s back as she thought; but eventually Chum succeeded, and  Snowball stood patiently alongside waiting for his little master. Once on his  back, he kicked up his old heels and away he galloped, right up to the door of  a house.</p>
<p>Angelina, Um-Pig, and Flip  followed as quickly as they could, while Joey popped his head out to see what  all the bumping was about.</p>
<p>The house had once been white,  like Snowball; but now it was a pearly grey. Shutters that had vied with the  grass in colour bothered no longer about such trifles. They hung higgledy-piggledy  against the windows, drowsing in the sun. They never worked now, as their old  hinges creaked and were rusty, so opening and shutting was a thing of the past  to them. The door that had once known what it was to be slammed in a  bushranger&rsquo;s face now stood quietly open. It never closed at night now, except  in the middle of winter, then it felt more comfortable as the cold rain the  wind could whip one side only of its old panels. The roof had seen many storms  come and go. Each storm tore a few shingles from it, but what did it matter&mdash;the  old man who lived in the house climbed a ladder the next day and laid a few stones  and logs over the gaping rents. The chimney was still proud of itself, and  although it had lost that jaunty air it once possessed, it still puffed away  content with all its surroundings. Cobbles had fallen, mud had crumbled, and  its cowl was sandy black; but it had an air as much as to say &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll smoke for a  good while yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snowball&rsquo;s galloping made the  rickety old veranda shake with fright, while the clatter of his hoofs brought  an excited old lady to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chum! Chum!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our  own little Chum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grandma! I&rsquo;m back&mdash;I&rsquo;ve come  back,&rdquo; Chum exclaimed. &ldquo;Where are mother and father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re down in the garden,  waiting for you to return, You&rsquo;ve been such a long time away. Where is Grandpa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s over the hills with his  birds. He said he must stay with them until the last one flies away. Don&rsquo;t you  remember? You came with us the day we went for our walk, but you grew so tired  Grandma, and you turned home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember, I remember,&rdquo; the old  lady said sadly. &ldquo;I grew so tired of the journey. The birds and animals were  killed. I missed them and longed to come back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa will come soon,&rdquo; Chum  said squeezing her old hand. &ldquo;He says he is tired too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Then I&rsquo;ll wait here for him,&rdquo;  the old lady sighed contentedly.</p>
<p>By this time Angelina, Um-Pig, and  Flip had arrived, and while listening to Chum, the old lady had not noticed  them. Now&mdash;she beamed with joy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! There&rsquo;s Angelina and little  Joey. And Um-Pig, and, &rsquo;pon my soul, Flip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Claude still down in the  paddock?&rdquo; Angelina asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, yes! and if ever a  husband missed his wife he has,&rdquo; Grandma laughed as she stroked Angelina&rsquo;s  nose. &ldquo;And Joey&rsquo;s here too! Well, what a surprise for Claude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are my wife and piglets here?&rdquo;  Um-Pig asked, with an excited grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Rebecca?&rdquo; the old lady  said clapping her hands with glee. &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s here. Down by the turnip  patch with as many babies as you can count on your trotters twice over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um-Pig gave a squeal of delight,  and with a final kick in Flip&rsquo;s direction galloped off with Angelina and Joey  closely following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too flighty for words!&rdquo; Flip  said with a scornful croak. &ldquo;He should have been bacon and eggs years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see your wife?&rdquo;  Chum asked turning to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you once before <i>I&rsquo;m a bachelor</i>,&rdquo; Flip answered  impatiently, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to see if that little froglet I used to know called  &lsquo;Cutie&rsquo; is still in the old tank,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s there all right, and  haven&rsquo;t I blessed her at night when she&rsquo;s kept me awake, croaking for you,&rdquo; the  old lady replied with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo; Flip called as he  hopped away in the direction of the rusty old tank. &lsquo;&lsquo;I only hope she&rsquo;s saved  me a few mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to mother and father,  please Grandma; I&rsquo;ve missed them so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand, child. I find  my eyes are not as good as they used to be, and the cobbles hurt my old feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So together Chum and his Grandma  walked down the path to the garden, followed by old Snowball. A man and woman  were standing arm-in-arm looking down at a bed of flowers. It had been Chum&rsquo;s  garden, and in it were the plants that all little boys love so much. Even a few  radishes had sprung up, not ashamed to be growing amongst the Sweet William,  Granny Bonnets, and Dusty Millers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! Mother!&rdquo; Chum cried,  running to meet outstretched arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chum! My little boy,&rdquo; his mother  replied, hugging him tightly, kissing his face and hair. &ldquo;My little man. Where  have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father,&rdquo; Chum said between  tears and smiles, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with Grandpa for a long time; but I had to leave  him to come back home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little chap,&rdquo; his father  said patting his hand gently. &ldquo;Where is your Grandpa? You and Grandma went with  him to gather wild flowers, and as you know Grandma came back. She was tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him to chase a locust and  lost my way,&rdquo; Chum replied. &ldquo;Angelina found me, and took me to Who&rsquo;s Who to  find out where I lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Who&rsquo;s Who?&rdquo; his father  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I know now!&rdquo; Chum cried  excitedly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who must be Grandpa, and I didn&rsquo;t know him. He&rsquo;d, grown so  old on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go back to the house  and listen to the story you must have to tell us,&rdquo; his father said as he  picked Chum up and, laughing, carried him on his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew Chum would come back,&rdquo; his  mother said lovingly, &ldquo;He is a dear child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they neared the house and  looked towards the stile whence Chum had gone so many years ago, two figures  appeared, one gently helped an old man over the stones, then waving a grey  misty hand turned back the way he had come. It was the Spirit of Long Ago,  helping a tired traveller over the last stile of his journey.</p>
<p>The old man came up the path  slowly, then pausing for a moment&rsquo;s rest, looked up and waved his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Who&rsquo;s Who!&rdquo; Chum cried  gladly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Grandpa!&rdquo; his mother smiled,  waving her hand in welcome.</p>
