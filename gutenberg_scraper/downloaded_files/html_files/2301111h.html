<p>SUCH a famous entertainer as Jacko, who has been "on the
air" from various broadcasting-stations, and has made a
trans-continental tour, should not need much by way of introduction
to his fellow Australians. As is the case with all great artists,
his admirers will welcome this chance of hearing details of his
private life among his human friends and animal companions. It is
fortunate that the story of such a happy fellow should be so
happily told and so happily illustrated.</p>

<p>Two of Jacko's accomplishments will make many readers
envious. The first is his ability to sleep all night with the
following morning's breakfast in his beak. What a practical
way of solving the problem of early meals! The second
accomplishment is his willingness and ability to laugh whenever he
is asked to do so. Most kookaburras will laugh only in the morning
and the evening; many human beings find it difficult to have even
one good laugh a day. If only we could catch some of Jacko's
sense of humour, what a happy, laughing place this world would
be.</p>

<p>We are told that when the first settlers in Australia heard the
kookaburra laugh, they thought the forests were peopled with evil
spirits. That was when everything was new and strange to them.
Since that time the kookaburra has laughed his way into the hearts
of all of us. And what a laugh it is&mdash;no mere giggle or
throaty snigger, but a side-splitting, body-shaking shout of a
laugh that surely could be caused only by the greatest joke in the
world. Its very infectiousness could not have failed to produce in
Australians something of their faculty of seeing a soul of humour
even in things evil.</p>

<p>Like all good fellows, Jacko has the happy knack of making
friends wherever he goes, and I am sure that this most interesting
book will gain for him many new friends.</p>

<p>"Laugh and the world laughs with you," says Jacko,
or, in the words of our Australian writer, E. S. Emerson:</p>

<p><i>I am Australia's genius,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a message to all I
bring&mdash;<br>
As the months flit by, keep your head up high,<br>
And laugh!<br>
Laugh!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh at everything.</i>

</h2>

<p>THIS is the true story of Jacko, the Broadcasting Kookaburra,
that so many of his fellow Australians have heard laughing; over
the air from the wireless stations of Melbourne, Sydney, and
Brisbane; and from the gramophone record which was arranged and
produced by Mrs. Harold W, Clapp for the Australian National Travel
Association.</p>

<p>The story begins with Jacko's capture in the bush. It
tells of his many adventures and ends with his home-coming after a
four thousand-mile caravan journey along the eastern seaboard of
Australia.</p>

<p>The illustrations and chapter headings are from drawings made by
Miss Dorothy Wall, whose exquisite pen has captured the humorous
spirit of the story.<br>

My First Adventure</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page017a.jpg" alt=
"chap 1" width="500" height="246">
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MY parents had their home in a huge gum-tree growing on a
hillside overlooking the valley of the Watts River, in Victoria.
The falling of a dead branch had left a hollow stump, like the
spout of a tea-pot, sticking out from the trunk of the tree. Inside
this spout, about as far down as you could reach with your arm, was
the nest. It was made by father and mother scuffling in the dry,
rotten wood until they had crumbled it to a soft powder, and had
hollowed out a shallow basin for the eggs to rest in.</p>

<p>Here the four eggs were laid. They were almost round in shape
and white in colour.</p>

<p>Not only kookaburras, but all birds who have their nests in the
twilight of hollow branches and in tunnels in creek and river
banks, lay white eggs.</p>

<p>The first I can remember is four little birds, lying close
together in the nest. We slept most of the time. When awake, all we
could see was the round wall of our home, and, over our heads, a
patch of blue which was the outside world.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page017b.jpg" alt=
"four" width="400" height="346">
</p>

<p>The best thing we knew about that patch of blue was that when it
suddenly "went out," and the nest became quite dark,
our parents were coming in to feed us.</p>

<p>I was the first of the family to adventure through the blue
patch at the top of the spout. One day, when we were all about
three weeks old, it went out. But instead of our parents coming in
with some morsels of food that they had found for us in the
paddocks, a human hand came groping down.</p>

<p>Two boys, who were fond of roaming about the bush when they had
a holiday from school, had seen our parents going in and out of the
old hollow branch. They must have been very sharp-eyed boys because
kookaburras&mdash;indeed, all the birds of the bush&mdash;are very
shy of going into their nests when there are humans near.</p>

<p>These two boys had built a long ladder of saplings and sticks
and had climbed up to our nest.</p>

<p>It happened that while the boy who had climbed to the top of the
ladder was looking to see how he could climb the rest of the way up
to our hollow branch, a lady, who had seen the boys from a
distance, came up to them.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We are after the Jackies' nest," they
replied, using the name by which people often call kookaburras. The
lady must have been interested, because she did not tell them to go
away.</p>

<p>"Be careful you do not fall!" she said; and stood
below, looking up, while the boy pulled himself on to a cross-limb
and stood up. He was now able to peer down into the darkness of our
spout.</p>

<p>"There are young 'uns," he shouted
excitedly.</p>

<p>He reached down to our nest and after fumbling about for a
moment took hold of me. I was drawn up, and the patch of blue was a
patch no longer. It was the whole world! I was so frightened at the
change in my surroundings and at the smell of human hands that I
squawked and struggled. I slipped from the boy's hands. I
hadn't learned to fly, so I fell, flapping and flopping
toward the earth below.</p>

<p>Just as I neared the ground two hands were reached up to me and
then closed around me. I was still very scared; so I struggled and
cried out. One of the hands held me, the other stroked my back; and
a soft voice kept making pleasant, soothing noises near my head. I
began to think that perhaps there wasn't so much to be
frightened about after all, and became quieter.</p>

<p>Then the boy who had taken me from the nest came down the ladder
and I saw that he had my brother in his hands. That was the last
that he or I saw of the nest in the old gum-tree. We were carried
away.</p>

<p>Everything was new and strange to me. As the ground and the
trees and the saplings moved past I kept my eyes wide open, and my
ears, too. I have ears under the short feathers at the side of my
head. I could not help jumping and squawking and struggling to get
away from time to time; because everything was so strange. Each
time I struggled I was lifted up, my back was stroked, and I heard
those soft noises again, and was calmed.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page019.jpg" alt="hand"
width="351" height="400">
</p>

<p>Before we reached the home of the lady into whose hands I had
fallen, the boys became tired of carrying my brother. They gave him
to the lady; and he and I were comforted to be with each other. But
that was not to last for very long.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2" id="Chapter2"></a>Chapter
2<br>
I Learn To Laugh</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page020.jpg" alt=
"laugh" width="500" height="263">
</p>

<p>AT first I had been very alarmed at the strange noises humans
made when they looked at each other. I did not know they were
talking and that the noises meant the same to them as the squeaks
my brothers and sisters and I used to make to each other in the
nest, and the little clucky sounds our parents used to make when
they were looking after us. But as time went by I came to
understand that; and I even learnt what some of the sounds
meant.</p>

<p>Soon after we arrived at the home of the lady who had caught me,
my brother and I were placed on a perch and our photographs were
taken. That was my first photograph. I have been taken many times
since then.</p>

<p>The lady said we were "such quaint, bob-tailed little
dears!" I found out that the lady's name was Thelma and
that she belonged to the Big Boss, whom she called to have a look
at us.</p>

<p>The Big Boss said there were too many pets about the place and
that one of us would have to go.</p>

<p>Thelma did not know which one of us to keep.</p>

<p>"Keep the one you caught," said the Big Boss.</p>

<p>After hesitating a little while, and looking us over carefully,
she chose me.</p>

<p>So my brother was taken away to meet his adventures elsewhere
and I remained with Thelma and the Big Boss to meet mine.</p>

<p>I was very lucky to find myself with people who loved all
animals and birds and who went to great trouble to keep them
healthy and contented. I was fed on scraps of raw beef. This was
good. When kookaburras can't get their natural food raw beef
is the only thing on which they will live and keep well.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that if I cried out in a certain way when I
was hungry, just as I used to do in the old gum-tree, Thelma knew
what I wanted. She would take me on her lap and croon and talk to
me while she fed me.</p>

<p>It was early in November that I was taken from the nest. By
Christmas-time my stumpy little tail had grown to its full size. It
is not a great deal of a tail at any time; but it had grown as long
as any other kookaburra's tail. I was beginning to feel like
a bird, and not like a baby.</p>

<p>My wing was clipped to prevent me flying away. I am not sure
that I would have flown away if I could. I suppose the Big Boss and
Thelma were not sure, either; and that is why they made certain
that I couldn't!</p>

<p>I was very contented. I had the run of the house and the garden.
My favourite seat was an old chopping-block sunk into the ground
not far from the back door. Here I would sit sunning myself most of
the day: and every now and then Thelma would come out to see that I
was all right. She was very fond of me and was always on the watch,
because she feared that a stray cat or dog would attack me. I was
very fond of her. One very good reason for that was that she fed me
whenever I was hungry. Another reason was that she always handled
me very gently.</p>

<p>One day Thelma was entertaining the people next door. While they
were talking in the house, the Little Girl Next Door came into the
backyard to play with me. She had a funny idea of how to play with
a kookaburra. She picked up the tomahawk, which was used for
splitting kindling, and before I knew what was happening, she had
cut my tail off. Goodness knows how much more of me she would have
cut off; but at that moment, Thelma dashed out of the back door
&mdash;and I was saved!</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page021.jpg" alt=
"tail" width="570" height="750">
</h3>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>"Whatever have you been doing to poor Jacko, child?"
said Thelma. The Little Girl Next Door burst into tears.</p>

<p>"I cu-cu-cut his tail off, bu-bu-but I didn't mean
to!"</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious! Whatever made you do that?"</p>

<p>But the Little Girl Next Door cried into her dress and
couldn't say anything.</p>

<p>"Well, it was a good job you didn't cut the other
end of him off!"</p>

<p>And there was I standing on the chopping-block feeling very
light behind and hard put to keep my balance.</p>

<p>The Little Girl was taken indoors and given a piece of cake to
stop her crying.</p>

<p>I notice that when she comes to visit us nowadays no one ever
mentions the time she chopped my tail off. It is known as a painful
subject.</p>

<p>I had a very awkward time, because I had become used to my tail.
It took me six weeks to grow another one.</p>

<p>In those days I did not like to be away from Thelma for very
long at one time. When she was sweeping the mats on the veranda I
would hop on to them.</p>

<p>"You're a perfect little nuisance! always getting in
the way!" she would say, crossly. And would push me away with
the broom.</p>

<p>I would go to my box, feeling very hurt; and would peep around
the corner of it to watch what was going on.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page024.jpg" alt=
"corner" width="400" height="314">
</p>

<p>I was very inquisitive when I was a young bird, so I am
told.</p>

<p>My curiosity led me into bad habits. I liked to go to the front
gate; not knowing that there was a danger of some four-legged
passer-by worrying me with teeth or claw, or of some two-legged
passer-by stealing me. I liked to add my squawk when the children
came shouting out of the school across the road. The carts rattling
past interested me very much. I soon came to know the different
tradesmen who called at our place: the milko, the baker, and the
butcher. I knew the last one very well!</p>

<p>When there was nothing of great interest happening at the front
gate I used to go poking and prying into every nook and corner of
the flower-beds and outhouses. I am sure that I knew more about the
sheds and the garden than either the Big Boss or Thelma because I
used to get into all sorts of odd places where they couldn't
go. I could go exploring in the green world among the stems of the
plants; while humans could only look down on the top of the
garden.</p>

<p>There was only one thing I was afraid of: and that was the
lawn-mower. Whenever it was brought out of the tool-shed, or if I
heard the Big Boss cutting the lawn, I would go and hide myself. I
was very scared of it!</p>

<p>The Big Boss and Thelma soon found out that if the lawn-mower
was left out in the front of the house, the sight of it standing
there would prevent me going to the gate. Sometimes, when I had
gone under the house to have a look round and refused to come out
in answer to Thelma's call, she would run the mower noisily
along the side path. That was more than I could stand. I would go
hopping and squawking out into the garden.</p>

<p>There came a day when I got over being frightened of the
lawn-mower. I noticed that if the Big Boss left it standing
anywhere it did not move by itself. It never did anything unless
someone pushed it. I hopped up on the handle, and although I was a
bit timid for a while, nothing happened.</p>

<p>Nowadays the handle of the mower is one of my favourite perches.
It is low enough for me to watch and listen for grubs and crickets
moving in the earth under the grass; but too high for the grubs and
crickets to know that I am about. When the Big Boss is cutting the
lawn I like to hop along behind him. There is always the chance of
picking up a juicy beetle or a grasshopper.</p>

<p>Many kookaburras will not laugh in captivity. Some will only
laugh at the rising and the setting of the sun. I think I am the
only one that will laugh whenever I am wanted to. That is the
reason for my success in wireless broadcasts and in record-making;
and why I am known to so many people.</p>

<p>Thelma taught me to laugh by imitating the notes of my parents.
She must have been very clever and very patient, because it was
many weeks before I had the least idea of what it was she was
trying to get me to do.</p>

<p>I remember the first laughing noise I made. I was standing on
the top rail of a chair-back. Thelma had been making that strange
noise that, somehow, I felt I should understand, but which I
couldn't understand at all. I felt something moving in my
throat. I was almost afraid of it, I felt that something should
move in my throat, and then, again, I felt that something was
wrong, when it did move! Suddenly the feathers of my throat swelled
out in spite of me; I opened my beak and a chuckle came out.</p>

<p>Thelma says I was so surprised that I squawked and nearly fell
off the chair.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page026.jpg" alt="fell"
width="400" height="340">
</p>

<p>My first laugh was, for me, no laughing matter at all. Once the
first difficulty was over, I learnt very quickly. Now I will
stretch out my body and send out a real kookaburra laugh at any
hour of the day or night; just whenever I am asked. Sometimes I
have a laugh without being asked. A kookaburra's laugh is
just his way of telling himself how happy he feels.</p>

<p>It is now a long while since the days when Thelma used to stand
in front of me and say:</p>

<p>"Say Whoo! Whoo! Jacko!"</p>

<p>And all I could say was: "Quack!" There is a cry
that all very young kookaburras make when they need food; and I am
happy that she learnt my meaning quicker than I learnt hers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3" id="Chapter3"></a>Chapter

My First Mouse</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page027a.jpg" alt=
"three" width="500" height="225">
</p>

<p>I WAS pampered quite a lot in my younger days. When the Big Boss
and Thelma had visitors I would be taken indoors and shown to the
callers. Then I would be asked to laugh. After I had done so, quite
a fuss would be made over me, I had my full plumage by then and had
grown to be a handsome bird, in the quaint manner of my tribe. My
general colouring is a soft brown. My vest is white, so, also, is
the crown of my head and the collar that encircles my neck.</p>

<p>Running over the back of my head is a black smear that looks as
if someone had stained my feathers there with a brush. The thick
part of my wings is faintly laced with a double line of grey, and
the long feathers are touched with metallic blue. The ends of my
tail-feathers are tipped with white.</p>

<p>Thelma used often to take me with her when she called on
neighbours or went shopping. I sat on her wrist while she made her
rounds. I liked those outings very much, and, through them, came to
be known to a large number of people&mdash;and animals.</p>

<p>I came to know Ginger; the cat at the studio where I had my
first photograph taken. From Ginger I got the first mouse that I
ever ate. I have eaten a good number since. The lady who owned the
studio was a great bird-lover and had trained Ginger never to harm
anything that had wings. At the back of the studio was a little
garden and grass-plot. Here Ginger and I loved to sun ourselves; he
on the grass and I on the trellis. I dozed a good deal. But, often,
that was only pretence. Many a time I have dropped like a stone
from that trellis and then hopped back on to it with a fat white
grub in my beak.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page27b.jpg" alt="cat"
width="505" height="437">
</p>

<p>One day Ginger caught a mouse. He did not kill it at once but
pounced around, playing with it on the grass. I sat on the trellis
looking down at him with my head on one side. Playing with anything
good to eat was a thing I couldn't understand. I never played
with grubs or grasshoppers after I had caught them. Without
stopping to think what I was doing I flopped down in front of
Ginger, picked up the mouse, and hurried back on to the trellis.
Ginger looked round in a surprised way; then up at me. He licked
his chops but did nothing further. Then he stretched himself on the
grass as if he didn't care to make a fuss over a little thing
like a mouse. I killed the mouse by swinging my head and hitting
him hard on the trellis, Then I turned him head-first in my beak,
tilted up my head, gave a wriggle with my throat, and he was
gone.</p>

<p>I am very fond of a mouse. When I catch one the first thing I do
is to laugh&mdash;while I am still holding him in my beak. And,
having caught one, I won't let anyone take it away from me.
The Big Boss tried to take one from me once; but I gripped it hard
with the gapped edges of my bill. The Big Boss would have had to
pull my head off before he'd have got it away from me.</p>

<p>If I kill a mouse late at night, when I am not hungry, I sleep
with it held in my beak; when I wake up I have it for my
breakfast.</p>

<p>THERE is one thing that Thelma did not have to teach me and
which I am very careful about: that is the care of my body.
Although I never drink water, I have a shower-bath every day in the
year, and during the summer I enjoy standing for hours under the
sprinkler of the garden-hose.</p>

<p>I stay under the water until my feathers are soaked right
through. As the drops trickle down the slope of my beak and collect
along the lower edges of my upper bill I shake them off by jerking
my head from side to side as hard as I can, and by snapping my
bills together like a pair of clappers.</p>

<p>After the bath comes the toilet. I stand in the sun and shake
myself like a dog; then I puff my body out until the feathers stand
out from each other. I take each feather separately and run it
between the tips of my bill and preen it until it is quite dry and
glossy. I dry my head with the shoulder edges of my wings, using
each wing in turn, brushing and rubbing until all the moisture is
gone. A kookaburra's toilet is a very careful and serious
thing. I like to be by myself and to have no interruptions while I
am going through with it.</p>

<p>After all that, I get up on my box and give my bill a little
care. I polish it by rubbing it against my perch until it is quite
clean and sharp. Then I am ready for a nice sleep in the sun. Not
that I ever sleep very deeply! A little noise such as the crackling
of a twig or the distant barking of a dog will cause me to open my
eyes and to listen. I like always to know what is going on around
me.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I have nothing else to do, I have a game with an
old bone knife-handle which I found one day in the garden. I take
it in my beak and hop up the eight steps to the veranda. There, I
bang the knife-handle about on the boards just as if it were a
mouse or a lizard that I was killing. When I am tired of the game I
take the knife-handle down the steps and hide it under the lowest
one. That piece of smooth bone is the only thing that is really
mine; so I always hide it in the same place: where I can find it
when I feel inclined for a game.</p>

<p>When I was about a year old a little black-coated Yorkshire
terrier came to live at our place. He came on the train; and all
the family except myself went to meet him. I remember that when
they brought him home he had a railway-ticket about twice his own
length tied to his neck with a piece of blue ribbon.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page030.jpg" alt=
"splinter" width="398" height="400">
</p>

<p>Soon after he arrived we were introduced. His name was Splinter.
He didn't know much about kookaburras. He tried to lick my
face and climb all over me, I gave him a sharp peck on the nose,
and he ran away crying and yelping. Of course he ran to Thelma. She
picked him up and made a fuss over him; and she scolded me.</p>

<p>"You little brat!" she said.</p>

<p>She petted the puppy and crooned to him:</p>

<p>"Did the naughty Jacko peck his little nose? Well the
naughty Jacko shall be put to bed at once!"</p>

<p>She picked me up, and although I squawked and flapped my wings
to let her see that I objected, she sat me on the rail of the
chair-back and made me stay there. I thought I had been very badly
treated; so I looked down at Splinter and said "Quark!"
every time I saw him looking up at me.</p>

<p>For several days after Splinter came to live with us I bore him
a grudge and would have nothing to do with him. If he came near me
I hopped away, scolding and squawking angrily.</p>

<p>One day he was being fed, and, feeling a little hungry, I hopped
up close to him to see if something would be given to me. I got a
titbit for my trouble; and Splinter did not seem to mind. After
that we got to understand each other better, and in a little while
we became friends. If ever Splinter showed signs of forgetting that
I was a kookaburra and not a Yorkshire terrier, I had only to show
him my beak and say "Quark," and he would remember
himself.</p>

<p>The memory of that peck on his nose seemed to stay with him a
long time.</p>

<p>Not long after Splinter came to live with us the Little Girl
Next Door had her holidays. She came in to our place to play school
with me and Splinter. My perching-box and a stool for Splinter were
carried to a sunny place in the garden, and there we had our
lessons. I was a good scholar; although I was scolded sometimes for
laughing. Splinter was not a very good scholar. I don't think
he enjoyed school very much. He sat on his stool all hunched up,
with a dunce's cap on his head. The best part for him was
when school was let out. The cap was then taken off his head and he
was free to jump off the stool and run around the garden
barking.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page031.jpg" alt=
"stool" width="300" height="297">
</p>

<p>One day the Little Girl Next Door told us a story instead of
giving us lessons. She told us the story of how the kookaburra got
his laugh.</p>

<p>"Many years ago," she said, "all the birds of
Australia met in council to decide what should be done about the
kookaburra. The other birds thought that he was ugly and rough and
that his feathers had no bright colours. Also he looked clumsy and
could sing no pretty songs like the other birds. Altogether he was
a most unfinished creature.</p>

<p>"The birds of the bush decided that they could do nothing
to improve him and that he would have to be an outcast. This
grieved the kookaburra very much. He felt that he had not deserved
such treatment. Finding that the other birds would have nothing to
do with him he flew away and lived by himself.</p>

<p>"One bright day he was sitting on a bough of a gum-tree,
looking down at the ground and thinking of his sad fate. A snake
and a goanna travelling through the bush in search of food came
along. The goanna passed by on one side of the foot of the gum-tree
at the same time that the snake passed by on the other side. The
snake saw the goanna's tail at the same moment that the
goanna saw the snake's. Both thought that they had found
something to eat, so they began to swallow each other's
tail.</p>

<p>"They swallowed and swallowed.</p>

<p>"The kookaburra, sitting up in the branches, could see
that they were swallowing each other, and he began to chuckle. It
was so funny that by the time the snake and the goanna had choked
themselves to death the kookaburra was laughing at the very top of
his voice. The other birds all came to see what was the matter.
They looked at their old enemies down at the foot of the tree, and
they wanted to laugh, too. They couldn't! That made the
kookaburra laugh all the more,</p>

<p>"He laughs now whenever he thinks of it. So, when next you
hear his merry voice and look up to see him shaking from beak to
tail, you will know what it is that amuses him."</p>

<p>The Little Girl Next Door said that all this happened many years
ago; but that the old kookaburras tell the young ones the story and
that is why the kookaburras laugh to-day, I had not heard the
story. No doubt I would have, had I not been taken from the nest in
the old gum-tree when I was very young.</p>

My Friends Splinter And Bill</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page034.jpg" alt="five"
width="633" height="304">
</p>

<p>I HAD my troubles with Splinter. As he grew bigger and older he
got over his fear of my beak. He decided that I was just a bird and
that he could do what he liked with me. One of his tricks was to
creep up when I was having my meals and steal my meat. I flapped my
wings at him and hopped about; but he was more than I could
manage.</p>

<p>One day, being unable to bear with him any longer, I squawked as
loudly as I could. That brought Thelma to my help.</p>

<p>"Splinter, you are a little bully!" she cried,
"Haven't I told you not to tease Jacko and not to steal
his meat?"</p>

<p>Splinter looked very much ashamed of himself. He put his stump
of a tail down and slunk away under the house.</p>

<p>Thelma stood petting me and talking to me while I finished my
meal. Splinter was very jealous. He watched us from under the
house; but turned his head away quickly if Thelma glanced at
him.</p>

<p>In a little while he came crawling out. She fed us together; and
we were soon quite friendly again.</p>

<p>I don't suppose that Splinter meant to be unkind, but he
had another trick that used to upset me very much. I liked,
sometimes, after my bath, to sun myself on the veranda steps. Quite
often, if he were in a hurry to get outside to meet a dog in the
street, he would rush down the steps, taking me unawares. Of
course, if I opened my mouth at him he would skip to one side,
which was not so bad. But sometimes he would jump right over me. I
hated that more than anything in the world. All birds know that
their enemies pounce on them from above. Even if I have lived all
my life in a country garden I have many of the thoughts and
memories that belong to the kookaburra tribe and that pass down
from old to young. Every time Splinter jumped over me I had a cold
shiver down my back and was nervous for a while afterwards.</p>

<p>I think the happiest time of Splinter's life was when a
lot of men came to dig our road up and flatten it out again.
Another lot of men came to take our telegraph-poles down and put
new ones in their place. Splinter was outside the gate all day
long. He personally supervised the taking down and putting up of
every pole in the street. I used to watch him from the front steps.
What with looking after the traffic, and running from here to
there, he was the busiest and noisiest dog in Australia.</p>

<p>Splinter got himself into disgrace one day. It happened soon
after Bill, the fox-terrier, came to live with us. Thelma was going
visiting, and because Splinter used to bully Bill, she left Bill at
home with me and took Splinter with her.</p>

<p>Thelma and her friend were sitting talking, when they heard a
fowl squawking outside.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong with that fowl," said
Thelma's friend. "Perhaps Splinter has got hold of
it."</p>

<p>"Oh! you needn't worry about Splinter," said
Thelma. "He never touches fowls!"</p>

<p>They went on talking&mdash;and the fowl went on squawking.</p>

<p>At last they got up and went outside to make inquiries. They
found Splinter in the yard. He was holding down a Leghorn hen with
his paws and pulling its feathers out with his teeth.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page035.jpg" alt=
"feathers" width="350" height="259">
</p>

<p>I tell you these things about him so that you will understand
that a kookaburra who shares a home with a Yorkshire terrier can
never feel quite secure.</p>

<p>One day a swarm of bees settled on a bush in the garden.
Splinter investigated them with his nose. I wouldn't have
done that. There are lots of bees in the bush and a kookaburra
knows enough to let them alone. The bees stung poor Splinter on the
nose. He howled and rushed under the house, where he always goes
when he is in trouble. Thelma called him and coaxed him, but he
refused to come out. He stayed there all day and all night.</p>

<p>A few days after Splinter's adventure with the swarm of
bees I, also, had a little adventure. I escaped from the garden
through a hole in the fence, I found myself in an orchard. For a
kookaburra who had spent all his life in a garden to suddenly find
himself at liberty and in a new world was very thrilling. I hopped
along, going from here to there and stopping sometimes to look
around me. It was all very strange and interesting.</p>

<p>On the other side of the orchard I found a paddock full of tall
grass and well stocked with all sorts of fat, juicy insects, I must
have been out a long time and have travelled a long way. I had no
thought of going back. I would have been content to live in that
nice big paddock all the rest of my life. No doubt when the
feathers of my cut wing grew I should have flown back to the wild
bush to which I belonged&mdash;that is, supposing that I was not
caught and killed by a cat or a strange dog in the meantime.</p>

<p>I was standing still near a little bush when I heard Thelma
calling for me. She had missed me from the garden and had been
searching for me for a long time.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page037.jpg" alt=
"calling" width="300" height="298">
</p>

<p>"Whoo! Whoo! Jacko!" she called,</p>

<p>I was quite glad to hear her voice; and before I knew what I was
doing, I called out: "Whoo! Whoo!" Then I saw her
coming toward me across the paddock. She picked me up; scolded me
and petted me and stroked my back&mdash;and carried me back to the
garden.</p>

<p>Bill, the fox-terrier, belongs to the Big Boss, and to no one
else. He goes to work every day. While the Big Boss is having his
breakfast Bill waits outside for him and greets him with a happy
bark as soon as he comes out.</p>

<p>He is very excited and noisy when they go out through the front
gate together. He loves to bark and scamper round and round as they
go down the hill to the store. But he will come to heel when he is
called. He would not do so for anyone except the Big Boss. He
thinks that the Big Boss belongs to him and that Thelma belongs to
Splinter, who always stays near home.</p>

<p>When they reach the store Bill makes straight for the stable
where the rats live. He keeps himself busy for a good part of the
day sniffing and snuffing through the straw and behind the bags of
chaff.</p>

<p>Sometimes he goes with the boy down to the river paddock where
the horses feed. He likes that because he can have a wonderful time
scratching at the mouths of the rabbit-burrows, growling and
whining to himself. If he sees a rabbit, there is a yelp and a wild
chase until the rabbit is safe down its hole.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Big Boss goes riding. Bill yaps and barks and
dances about; then springs up toward the saddle, higher and higher,
until the Big Boss catches him by the scruff of his neck and pulls
him up. Throughout the journey Bill sits on the front of the saddle
like a dog in a circus.</p>

<p>When Bill gets back at night Splinter is always waiting for him
at the front gate. He makes a great fuss over Bill, licking his
face, slobbering all over him, and asking if he has had any fun
with the rats or the rabbits.</p>

I Go Fishing</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page041.jpg" alt="six"
width="500" height="231">
</p>

<p>IF there is one thing that a kookaburra likes better than
anything else it is a freshly caught freshwater fish. A full-grown
kookaburra can swallow whole a fish up to about six inches long. To
see him do it is a sight worth while. I suppose our taste for fresh
fish is one that has come down with us from the days when
kookaburras, like all the tribes of the Kingfisher nation to which
we belong, lived along the margins of lagoons and rivers.</p>

<p>The kookaburras left the watercourses. They learned to live
without drinking. They spread into the mountains and across the
plains; so that their laugh is as well known to the people who live
in the far Inland as it is to those who live by the sea.</p>

<p>We went fishing one day at Toolangi, high up in the ranges. We
went in the car. The Big Boss and Thelma were in front. Splinter
sat with them. His hind-legs were on the seat, his forelegs rested
on the lower rim of the wind-screen, and his little black eyes
stared at the world rushing past. Bill rode behind, and I perched
on the back of the front seat with the Big Boss's head on one
side of me and Thelma's on the other.</p>

<p>Splinter and Bill know a fishing-rod as well as anyone else. As
soon as they saw the car and the rods they whined and barked and
shook their stumpy tails and ran about in great excitement. But it
was all very new to me. When we were ready to start they were the
first into the car, and when we gat to Toolangi I noticed that they
were the first to jump out.</p>

<p>I sat quietly on my perch during the journey, but Splinter and
Bill could hardly contain themselves. Bill kept jumping down from
the seat and up again, panting and whining. Sometimes he stood on
the floor, and, putting his front paws on the top of the back seat
where I was perching, looked over at Splinter. I think he thought
Splinter was getting special treatment, and he was jealous.</p>

<p>He made me nervous with all his pouncing about. Several times I
had to open my beak at him and give him a warning
"Quark!" to remind him that I was there. A bouncy
fox-terrier would knock a bird over without knowing that he was
doing so.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page042.jpg" alt=
"bouncing" width="650" height="388">
</p>

<p>Bill saw a rabbit while we were travelling along. He forgot that
he was in the car, and jumped out through the open window. Thelma
screamed and the Big Boss stopped the car so suddenly that I almost
fell off my perch. Bill wasn't hurt; he tumbled over and over
in the dust and then got to his feet and raced away after the
rabbit. The Big Boss had to get out and whistle him back.</p>

<p>Thelma was angry with him because he had frightened her.</p>

<p>"Box his ears if he doesn't behave!" she
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bill's all right!" said the Big Boss
after they had got back into the car, and Bill was sitting on his
knees.</p>

<p>"You're a good dog, aren't you, Bill?"
He patted him a while, then pushed him over into the seat again.
Bill lay there with his tongue hanging out, panting and happy. And
off we went once more.</p>

<p>Splinter couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted most
to look out through the wind-screen and think about the good time
he was going to have, or whether he wanted to listen to Thelma and
the Big Boss talking together or fussing about with Bill. His sharp
little ears were twitching all the time; first to the front and
then to the rear; then one forward and the other backward. They
were never still. His long, shaggy eyebrows rose and fell as he
blinked and peered ahead. His grey whiskers and the hairs on his
head were all aquiver. From time to time he turned round to yelp
with delight; and Bill answered him.</p>

<p>As we climbed the range we got into the real bush, and I began
to feel something moving inside me. The air was cool; there were
big trees, and there was the smell of gums and dogwood. If the car
had been standing still I would have stretched out and laughed. As
it was, I did manage a chuckle or two. Bill and Splinter were
sniffing and whining. I suppose the smell of the real bush reminds
them of things they thought they had forgotten; just as it reminds
me.</p>

<p>We did not get any fish when we stopped for lunch because trout
do not bite well at midday; but it was very nice to be still for a
little while and to have a look round about. Where we lunched, a
little, not-very-much-travelled bush road crosses the Yea River.
The ford is wide and shallow and the water is as clear as the air;
except where it bubbles white over the stones. There were trout
hiding in the shadows of the creek-banks and the big stones,
waiting for insects and flies carried along by the waters.</p>

<p>The Big Boss did not unpack his rods, but Bill and Splinter did
a little fishing for themselves. Bill went into the water and
started the trout moving, while Splinter ran up and down the bank
watching the water. Splinter was supposed to jump in and catch a
fish if he saw one. He must have seen plenty, but he was content to
run about and bark or else lie down and stare into the water,
quivering from head to tail. They didn't catch anything.
After they had made themselves tired they came back to where the
Big Boss and Thelma were resting on the grass and told them all
about it.</p>

<p>I had a nice time standing on the stump of a fallen tree looking
about me. I saw birds moving about in the thick scrub. I found some
tasty grubs under a piece of bark. I laughed a couple of times and,
as the sound died away, I was answered by some wild kookaburras
away off in the hills. After we had rested for a while we all
packed into the car and moved off again.</p>

<p>The sun was going down when we came to an open grassy space in
the forest along the banks of the Yarra River. The Big Boss stopped
the car under the trees and we all got out. There was a piece of
grass like a lawn; all clipped short by rabbits. There was a
stretch of tussocky grass with clumps of blackberry bushes and
patches of bracken. There were tall, white gums trailing ropes of
bark in the stream; and along the banks there were a lot of
dark-leaved silver wattles. All about there was a nice smell of
damp earth and grass and green leaves.</p>

<p>The dogs went down to the river for a drink. The Big Boss began
fitting his rod together. I hopped about on the grass, with Thelma
watching me. I never get far away from her eye when we are out. She
is afraid that I might be attacked by a house cat that has
"gone bush," or be pounced on by some bird bigger than
myself; and she is afraid that if I were to hop away into the
scrub, I might not come back.</p>

<p>There were plenty of rabbit-burrows in the bracken and under the
edges of the blackberry bushes. After Bill and Splinter had had a
drink they disappeared on a hunting-trip. But it takes a very
clever dog to catch a rabbit in his own country. The rabbit,
sitting quietly on the grass, sees the dog as soon as the dog sees
him, and he never has very far to go to his burrow. Once he is down
there, in the ground, all the dog can do is to scratch and whine
and sniff the rabbitty smell at the entrance and say what he would
have done to the rabbit had he caught him. In any case, the rabbit
mostly has two entrances to his burrow and could go out the back
way if he needed to.</p>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The Big Boss soon had his rod together. Thelma and I went with
him to the river's edge. It was not long before he landed a
seven-inch blackfish. It flopped about on the grass, all silvery in
the dusk. The Big Boss killed it and cleaned it to make sure that
there were no fish-hooks inside it; and then it was given to
me.</p>

<p>It was my first fish; but I knew what to do with it. The memory
of its coolness and fresh, fishy smell, came back to me from
somewhere. With Thelma and the Big Boss watching to see what I did,
I took it head-first in my bill, tipped my head up as high as it
would go and worked the muscles of my throat until my feathers
stood out like a frill, and the fish disappeared. I think Thelma
and the Big Boss expected me then to set up a laugh, but I was too
full of blackfish.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page047.jpg" alt="fish"

</p>

<p>We drove home through the darkness and were all much more quiet
than when we had driven away from home in the morning. I was on my
old perch, half asleep, except when a lurch of the car made me open
my eyes. Splinter and Bill dozed contentedly on the back seat.</p>

My Encounter With A Hawk</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page048.jpg" alt="hawk"
width="500" height="236">
</p>

<p>I WAS attacked by a large, brown hawk. It happened one morning,
not long after I had eaten my breakfast. I had been standing
quietly in a corner of the kitchen having a long think&mdash;as I
am fond of doing from time to time. The house was very still. Bill
was away with the Big Boss; Splinter had gone out somewhere; and
Thelma was busy in the front part of the house. I knew that she
would not want me around her feet, so I decided to go outdoors and
see what I could find to do.</p>

<p>I hopped through the back door; across the veranda, and down the
steps into the sunshine of the garden. Then I went down the back
path, stopping now and again to look around me.</p>

<p>It was a busy, tuneful morning. The bees were buzzing around the
blue morning-glories and the wistaria blossoms. Magpies were
carolling from across the river. Small birds were twittering and
hopping about the shrubs. There were some starlings chattering on
the roof of the shed; and I heard the wheels of a cart rattling
down the hill.</p>

<p>I began to exercise myself by stretching my wings as far out as
I could reach&mdash;first one and then the other, and then both
together.</p>

<p>If I had not been doing that I am sure I would have seen the
hawk coming; for I have very sharp eyes. I can see a hawk when it
is so high in the sky that it looks no bigger than a tiny black
speck.</p>

<p>Like all birds which are preyed upon by hawks and eagles, it is
not often I forget the dangers that lurk above my head.</p>

<p>I saw a black shadow on the ground in front of me, I heard a
swift swish of wings, and the hawk was on me! His wings beat the
ground on each side of me; he reached for my body with his long
claws and struck at my head with his hooked beak.</p>

<p>With a frightened "Quark!" I turned and fought back
at him; beating the ground with my wings and striking with my bill.
A kookaburra is a poor match for a brown hawk, but I managed to
fight myself clear of him for a few seconds. He rose, flapping, and
poised above me ready to drop again, I turned my head up at him and
squawked as fiercely as I could to let him know that I'd
fight him when he came down at me. But really I did not know what
to do. I was not like the wild kookaburra, who has a hollow
gum-tree to hide in and two good wings to carry him to safety. I
was caught in the open.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page055.jpg" alt=
"hawk" width="618" height="750">
</h3>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The hawk dropped again; and again I was beaten by his wings and
clawed by his talons. I squawked and drove at him with my beak. We
scuffled, and I managed to keep clear of his grasping claws. He
went into the air once more and hovered over me. I had been tumbled
on the hard ground; I was breathless with fear and struggle; and I
knew that when he came down again he would get me. I flopped about
looking up at him and not noticing where I was going.</p>

<p>By good luck I got among the bean plants; and there I stood,
looking up at him through the leaves and squawking my hardest. I
could see him moving about, looking to make sure of my exact
position before swooping down on me again.</p>

<p>Just then I heard footsteps running toward us down the path. I
had forgotten about Thelma. I had forgotten about everything except
myself and the hawk.</p>

<p>I heard Thelma call out. The hawk gave a cry of disappointment.
He rose in the air and sailed away. Then two hands, which I knew
very well, came down through the bean leaves, and I was picked up
and carried indoors.</p>

<p>I stayed inside the house all the rest of that day, following
Thelma from room to room. When the Big Boss came home that evening
she spoke to him about my fight with the hawk, and how I had kept
close to her afterward.</p>

<p>"The poor little fellow was quite unnerved," she
told him.</p>

<p>I would not like it to be thought that kookaburras have no
courage. We have plenty. But a bird of prey as big as a brown hawk
is too much.</p>

<p>Twice I have had battles with chicken-hawks. Each time I was
attacked Splinter happened to be at home and came to my rescue.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have trouble with the wild kookaburras. My learning
to laugh let them know that I was in the garden. I was very young
at that time and for a while I was not ill-treated. In fact, there
was one old mother kookaburra who must have been robbed of her
young ones. She tried to adopt me. She brought me grubs and wood
beetles; and was very distressed because she could not get me to
follow her when she flew away.</p>

<p>But as I grew older the wild kookaburras began to take a dislike
to me. Perhaps they thought that I was not really one of
themselves. They began attacking me. I would not have minded if
they had come at me one at a time; but they came in pairs and in
threes. On one occasion there was an even greater number than
that.</p>

<p>It was my laugh that drew them.</p>

<p>Sometimes they came because my laugh answered their laugh, and
sometimes they came because I had laughed and they had heard me. If
I had had more sense and less courage I would not have answered
them when I heard them laughing away off in the trees on the other
side of the paddock. But although I feared the wild kookaburras I
could not help joining in when I heard them. I am the sort of
kookaburra who must laugh or die.</p>

<p>One day I was hopping about on the lawn, picking up a
grasshopper or two, when I heard one of my wild tribesmen laughing
far away across the river. I flattened out my body, pointed my beak
in the direction from which the sound came, and listened.</p>

<p>The call came again, very faint and distant. It made me feel
uneasy; but I couldn't help myself. My tail gave a quiver and
I threw up my head and answered the challenge.</p>

<p>The kookaburra whose call I had replied to came to see me about
it and brought four of his wild mates with him. They flew on to the
fence that runs along the side of the garden. From there, the five
swooped down on me. We had a terrific rough-and-tumble fight up and
down the lawn and across the flower-beds. Our squawking brought
Thelma running; and again I was saved from harm by her. After my
fight with the five wild kookaburras it was decided that I must
have some sort of protection at times when Thelma could not come
quickly to my aid.</p>

<p>The Big Boss made a coop of wire-netting; and under it I had to
spend my time when Thelma was busy indoors or resting. She put me
under the coop also when she had to go to town.</p>

<p>It was not very nice to have to spend so much time shut up when
I had been used to wandering wherever I liked; but I soon learned
that the wild kookaburras could not get at me through the wire.</p>

<p>When my laugh brought a couple of them on to the fence I tipped
my head back and had another laugh.</p>

My Country Garden</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page052.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p>I DON'T spend all my time fighting hawks and wild
kookaburras. Sometimes Thelma and I have a lazy morning.</p>

<p>The other morning, after breakfast, I missed her. I went through
the house, hopping from room to room; then I saw that the door was
open. I hopped out on to the wide veranda; and there she was,
sitting at the head of the steps looking out over the garden and
the valley. She said:</p>

<p>"Hello, Jacko!"</p>

<p>So I hopped over to her and stood beside her, helping her look
at the scene.</p>

<p>Our hill slopes downward so quickly that you cannot see the
little town nestling at the foot of it; but you know that it is
there, and that makes it good company. The mountains on the other
side of the valley lift a spur of the Great Divide, with dark Monda
and St Leonard's flanking each end of the range. Dead sticks
of timber run all along the crest of the ridge, looking like the
broken teeth of an old saw. The thickly wooded foothills of the
range slope gently down to the river valley.</p>

<p>Our valley is not always filled with sunshine. Sometimes all but
the tops of the hills are lost under a rolling white mist; and as
the valley changes with the movement of the seasons so does our
garden.</p>

<p>When the valley floor sparkles with a white frost and the range
stands clear-cut in the crisp air, the garden-beds are gay with
nodding Iceland poppies. Daffodils stand thickly in the moist,
sheltered places, and the borders are bright with heavy-scented
stocks.</p>

<p>In the springtime, when the river bends are green and gold with
willow and wattle, and the range is half lost behind a thin blue
curtain, the garden is rich with the massed pink and white blossoms
of cherry-plums, peaches, and nectarines. The veranda, screened
with blooming wistaria and starry white clematis, is a lovely
bower. About it the air is heavy with the incense of hyacinths,
boronia, daphne, and jonquils.</p>

<p>In summer, when brown, when the smell of burning gum-leaves is
in the air, and ridge and paddocks drowse under a veil of bush-fire
smoke, the garden glows with many coloured zinnias and asters.
Small beds are bright with pansies, delphiniums, and white, ox-eyed
daisies.</p>

<p>When the late summer rains come, quenching the bush-fires and
restoring the soft greens to the valley, tall dahlias make a brave
show. Roses in their second blooming cluster about the arbours,
trailing long sprays of red, white, and gold. There are long-tubed,
brick-red tecomas, beloved by the bees. Grapes, green and purple,
hang from the trellis, and the maidenhair reaches its fullest
growth in the shady tree-fern retreat. The bottom of the garden is
then a wild tangle, where smooth, pale marrows, and pumpkins, like
squatting sultans, are half-hidden by their own broad-leaved vines.
The tall dry grass under the fruit-trees hides the new green shoots
and the fallen plums and peaches.</p>

<p>As sunset reddens the range at that season, the darting swifts
hawk high. As twilight comes and the lights of the farms in the
valley prick the dusk the bats come to flit on eerie wing.</p>

<p>The swifts leave us in the autumn, before the coming of the
chrysanthemums. They go from the valley on their long flight to
Siberia and Japan.</p>

<p>I was very glad when Thelma got up, and we went for a walk round
the garden; that was much more fun than sitting. I like going round
the garden on a sunny morning. I flapped my wings and hopped along
from place to place.</p>

<p>After we had enjoyed a walk we went to have a look at the new
ducklings belonging to a hen.</p>

<p>It was wet weather when the ducklings were hatched; and it was
so hard to look after them down at the end of the garden that they
were brought up on the back veranda. The veranda is where I sit on
the old chair-back on wet days. Thelma knew that I ate mice and
fish, and she was afraid, at first, that I might eat the
ducklings.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page053.jpg" alt=
"looked" width="400" height="356">
</p>

<p>When they came out to get the pollard spread on a piece of
cardboard, she stood by looking at me anxiously. I hopped down from
my perch and watched them. I had never seen ducklings before. I
gave one or two little chuckles just to let everyone know that I
wasn't going to do anything wrong. Very soon two of them
mistook me for the hen and sat down under me. Another one pulled my
leg-feathers with his little bill.</p>

<p>When we had seen the ducklings we went up the back path and
indoors. During the morning I followed Thelma about the house.
Sometimes I do that.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page055.jpg" alt=

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>I missed her very much when she was sick in hospital. I fretted
and went off my food. The Big Boss tried to feed me, but that only
made me feel more lonely and more miserable. He said that if I
didn't eat something I would have to be taken to the
hospital, too. It was a very unhappy time. Sometimes I went into
the garden. But I spent more time standing still in one place than
in hopping about.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page057.jpg" alt=
"heels" width="400" height="347">
</p>

<p>One day I heard Thelma's voice again. It sounded from
inside the house. I went in through the kitchen as fast as I could.
Some people tried to stop me going along the hall, but I squawked
and pecked at them, and flapped my wings. At last I got past them.
I found her in bed. She said:</p>

<p>"Hello, Jacko!"</p>

<p>I stretched out and sent up a laugh that filled the house. They
tried to put me out then, but I flopped from here to there and
squawked at them. At last they left me alone.</p>

<p>After that, when I found the bedroom door closed, I flapped my
way up the wall and through the open window. Thelma allowed me to
sit on the bed with her.</p>

<p>Everyone has his funny little ways&mdash;and I have mine. I like
my evening meal at a regular hour. One evening, just as the
crickets were starting to sing, I hopped inside looking for my tea.
Thelma was out. The Big Boss had come home and was seated in his
easy-chair in the lounge. I squawked at him to let him know I
wanted my evening meal. He took no notice; so I hopped around the
room, looking at things, and squawking every once in a while to
attract his notice. At last he laid aside his paper. He put out his
hand and I hopped on to it; then he put me on the cross-piece
beneath the writing-table. He expected me to wait there patiently
until Thelma came home.</p>

<p>At night I always roost on the chair-back in the kitchen, and
because of that these people always put me to roost on something
when they want me to be quiet. I sat on the cross-piece under the
writing-table while I gave the matter a moment's thought;
then I jumped down and hopped about the room again, squawking. The
Big Boss put out his hand again. When I hopped on it he put me on
the arm of his chair. That was better than being under the table,
so I decided to keep quiet until Thelma came home.</p>

<p>The Big Boss called me a "pernickety little cuss,"
and said that I had been waited on too much.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Big Boss was right in calling me a "pernickety
little cuss." But people who take a kookaburra from his
natural wild haunts to live in captivity should remember that they
have made life hard for him. There are so many things that I feel
the need of doing and can't; and so many things that I am
trained to do that I would not do if I were living among the
kookaburras in the bush, that it is no wonder my nature gets all
mixed up.</p>

<p>One of the things that trouble me very much is the way the wild
kookaburras all want to attack me. When I am on the veranda and I
see them sitting on the fence looking at me, I get into a troubled
state. I am afraid of them and angry with them and troubled inside
me about things I can't understand. I fly at the
veranda-posts and peck them and squawk to relieve my feelings. That
is all I can do about it. When I have worked myself up into a rage,
I hop inside and follow Thelma about the house.</p>

Skippy</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page059.jpg" alt=
"skippy" width="500" height="239">
</p>

<p>I MADE friends with a wild kookaburra.</p>

<p>One day I looked up on hearing a swish of wings, and there was a
single wild kookaburra sitting 0n the fence, looking at me. I
looked back at him&mdash;and that was all that happened until he
flew away again.</p>

<p>He came back on the following day and each day after. I was very
glad to see him, and after the first day or two greeted him with a
burst of laughter. He used to sit on the fence and watch me being
fed. After I had been fed I would stretch out and laugh. Then he
would laugh, too.</p>

<p>One day, when Thelma was in a hurry, she did not stop to give me
my beef piece by piece, but put it on the grass beside me and
hurried indoors. While I was eating it, my friend flew down from
the fence and joined me in my meal. After that he made my meal-time
his visiting-hour. Thelma began to notice him. She put some pieces
of beef out where he could get them without having to come too
close to her. He was soon picking them up.</p>

<p>It was not long until, instead of waiting on the fence, he would
come and sit alongside me until feeding-time; and then, after a
little coaxing, he took the meat from Thelma's hand. He
learned even to follow me into the kitchen.</p>

<p>One day, Thelma had to go to Melbourne. She had put me under my
coop. When my friend arrived he sat on the fence looking at me for
a long time before he would venture near me. At last he flew on to
the lawn. When Thelma returned, late in the evening, he was still
with me, waiting for his food.</p>

<p>On a day in late springtime, instead of eating the piece of beef
that Thelma gave him, he took it in his beak and flew away with it.
He came back in a few minutes' time, and being given another
piece of beef, flew away with it as before. This happened four
times. But he ate the fifth piece, as well as some more that was
given him.</p>

<p>Thelma thought she knew what he was doing, so, on the next day,
she watched his coming and going. She found that when he was given
his piece of beef and flew away with it, he made a bee-line for an
old gum-tree growing in a paddock about half a mile away from the
garden. Thelma and the Big Boss went that evening to look at the
gum-tree, and saw in it, high up, a hole such as might be the way
in to a kookaburra's nest. While they were looking up a
kookaburra flew into the branches of the tree. He waited a while
after he saw them as if he was afraid of letting them know that he
had a nest near by; but at length he entered the hole and
disappeared.</p>

<p>For about three weeks he kept up his habit of flying away each
day with the first few pieces of meat given him; then, one morning
when Thelma came outdoors she was surprised to see him and his wife
and three young birds. They were sitting in a row along the top of
the fence; he at one end and the mother bird at the other. As soon
as he saw Thelma he began to make the noise that kookaburras make
when they want something to eat. His family joined in his
cries,</p>

<p>"This is too much of a good thing!" said Thelma. She
did not mind my having a visitor, but "there's a limit
to hospitality."</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page061.jpg" alt=
"chicks" width="576" height="750">
</h3>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>For a week the wild kookaburra and his family were fed. They
came for breakfast and they stayed for tea. Thelma and the Big Boss
had a talk to see what should be done. I was not the first
kookaburra they had owned; and they did not intend that I should be
the last. The reason they were attached to me more than to any of
the other kookaburras they had had, was that I was the only one
they had been able to train to laugh whenever the signal was given.
All the others had laughed only at sunrise and at sunset. They did
not know how long a kookaburra lives (no one knows that) and they
thought of the time when I would get old and die. They said they
would have one more try at training a tame kookaburra.</p>

<p>Then next day, when the wild birds came for their breakfast, the
Big Boss caught the biggest and best plumaged of the young
ones.</p>

<p>His wing was clipped and he was put in the garden to keep me
company. The wild family were given their last meal. When they came
at tea-time Thelma was hard-hearted and took no notice of them.
After a few days they came no more.</p>

<p>The new kookaburra was called Skippy. I was very glad to have
him with me. He was very young and didn't know much, but I
taught him all I could. We hopped about the garden and caught grubs
together; and I let him sleep with me at night on the back of the
chair in the kitchen.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page062.jpg" alt=
"young" width="487" height="400">
</p>

<p>He is a good mate, but in some ways he has been a
disappointment. He had his laughing lessons, as I had, but he
hasn't learnt to laugh. Thelma put the two of us on our
perch, and chuckled and gurgled just as she used to do when she was
teaching me.</p>

<p>Skippy never opens his beak. Thelma gets me to laugh in the hope
that Skippy will join in. I laugh my best, but Skippy just sits and
stares. He doesn't as much as say "Quark!" He has
only two laughs a day&mdash;at morning and at evening.</p>

<p>Skippy likes best to sit in the shade of the peach-tree at the
bottom of the garden. Sometimes he will go there first thing in the
morning and stay there all day. When that mood is on him he
won't come to the house for meals; his breakfast and tea have
to be taken to him. He squats down until the white breast feathers
open and his feet are hidden. Now and then he turns his head to
follow the flight of a butterfly, or looks up intently when a
white-eye or a sparrow settles in the branches above him.</p>

<p>If I go near him when he is in one of his lonely moods, he will
get quite angry. He flicks his tail up and down and raises the
feathers on the back of his head. He seems to want only his own
company.</p>

<p>We always feed together, and I will share anything with him
except a mouse. To tease me the Big Boss gave him a mouse one day.
I opened my wings and my beak and flew at Skippy. He was glad to
let me have the mouse for the sake of peace. He is a very quiet
fellow. I can't even start a game with him. Sometimes, at
night, when we are sitting side by side on the chair-back I will
let out a squawk and nip his ear. Instead of snapping back, like a
lively kookaburra should, he just gives a little cry and tries to
pull away.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page063.jpg" alt="bath"
width="499" height="400">
</p>

<p>The thing he enjoys best with me is his bath. The first time the
hose was turned on him he did not know what to make of it, and
quickly hopped out of the way. But the second time, after watching
me, he saw that he was missing something good. Now we have a great
time together; wriggling and shuffling; ruffling our feathers;
spreading our wings and shaking our tails under the spray. That is
one of the few occasions when Skippy's voice is heard. He
shakes himself and gives little squawks of delight.</p>

<p>A favourite place for our bath is on the back veranda steps.
Here we stand and clap our bills and whet them against the edges of
the wooden treads. If Thelma moves the hose a little so that the
water does not fall on us, we edge along until we are again under
the spray.</p>

<p>For an hour afterwards we stand and preen and brush ourselves in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>Although Skippy is as big as I am he is not yet quite grown up.
His bill is still soft; as well as shorter and blunter and more
rounded than mine. His is still a baby bill; not as good for
digging out grubs as the hard, high-ridged, dagger-like bills of
older kookaburras. We both have three brown bands of feathers
running back from our beaks. One runs over the tops of our heads
and there is one on each side running back past our eyes. My bands
are separated by tracts of small silvery-white feathers. In Skippy
the bands meet in front, forming a sort of brown forehead. His eyes
are a dull, smoky amber; while mine are light brown with a yellow
iris. The grey-white feathers of our bodies are threaded with a
thin line of brown.</p>

<p>Skippy gives a lot of trouble because he will not answer when he
is called. If he is not in his usual place under the peach-tree he
has to be searched for. Thelma fears that the hawks have got him;
and she has a bad time until he is found. He is continually finding
new hiding-places. He decided that the space under the house was a
pleasant place in which to spend a few hours. To make sure that he
was there, Splinter had to be sent under to look for him. Although
Splinter awaited the command to fetch Skippy with eagerness, he did
his work with great gentleness. There was a squawk or two, and then
Skippy trotted out from under the boards, with Splinter following,
looking very pleased with himself.</p>

I Make A Gramophone Record And Become Radio Artist</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page066.jpg" alt="ten"

</p>

<p>YOU have not heard about the Doctor.</p>

<p>He and Barbara often come up from Melbourne in ther car to stay
with us during the week-ends. Like the Big Boss and Thelma, they
are very fond of animals and gardens and valleys and mountains. The
Doctor is a naturalist. As often as he can he goes down to the
sea-shore, or into the bush, and studies the habits of the wild
creatures. He knows why porpoises are so fond of swimming in front
of boats; why some lizards have blue tongues; why certain birds
disappear at some seasons of the year; and where they go. Barbara
is also a naturalist. The Doctor says that she is a better one than
he is. During their visits to us I came to know them very well.</p>

<p>One day an idea came to the Doctor that my laughter should be
put on a gramophone record. No kookaburra's voice had ever
been recorded. The Doctor said that if the idea proved to be a good
one, it would be the means of allowing the laugh of the Australian
kookaburra to be heard in every country in the world, This came to
pass. It is very strange to think, now, that it all began to happen
in the days when Thelma set herself so patiently to coax me into
laughter in the garden of our home in Healesville. That laugh has
been heard in America, England, France, Japan, and other countries.
The Big Boss, Thelma, the Doctor, and Barbara are all very proud to
think that it is their Jacko, and no other, that has lifted up his
voice for the kookaburra tribe.</p>

<p>The Doctor made arrangements with the gramophone company and
there came a day when I was taken to Melbourne to have my voice
tried out. Thelma drove in the car and I travelled on the seat
beside her, in a box. I won't say that I enjoyed being in the
box very much. There was nothing to see; and the only thing I had
to cheer me up was the sight of Thelma close by. I was glad when we
reached Melbourne.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page067.jpg" alt="box"
width="599" height="750">
</h3>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>We went first to the Doctor's. I was not quite sure of
myself when I was let out of my box. Everything was very strange. I
felt more comfortable when I found that the Doctor had a garden not
unlike the one at home. There were lawns and trees and flowers;
and, best of all, there was the sawn-off stump of an old Moreton
Bay fig-tree. I sat on that stump while the company had tea on the
lawn. I saw the blue sky above me, and found a grub or two in the
grass. I stretched my wings and opened and shut my bill, and
decided that I was still myself even if strange sights were around
me.</p>

<p>We went to the gramophone studio. The Doctor, Thelma, and
Barbara were afraid that I might suffer from fright when it came
time to make the record. But I didn't. I perched on
Thelma's wrist and when she gave me the signal to laugh I
stretched my body, tipped my head up, and let them have it. All the
people (including myself) were very pleased. Of course, I
didn't know why Thelma had asked me to laugh.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the trial record was ready. Everyone was very
anxious to hear it, because it sometimes happens that a voice does
not record as well as it sounds to the ear. Indeed, some voices are
quite unsuited for making gramophone records.</p>

<p>It was feared that mine might be one of them.</p>

<p>The trial record was brought in and put on the machine. I was
watching the man moving about. When the record started, I heard the
first scrapy little bit, and then I heard a kookaburra laugh. I
couldn't see him, but I could hear him! For a little while I
did nothing; then I stretched out and laughed with him. At that,
everyone else laughed. The louder the kookaburra in the box laughed
the louder I laughed&mdash;until he couldn't be heard, and I
had to be taken from the room! Everyone was very pleased with the
trial record.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page068.jpg" alt="room"
width="357" height="400">
</p>

<p>"We have something new!" they said. "We have
the voice of the bush on a gramophone record!"</p>

<p>Soon after the trial record was made, work was started on the
real record. As well as my laugh we had to have some talk, so that
people in distant countries would know something about the
Australian Laughing Kookaburra besides hearing his voice.</p>

<p>The Doctor wrote the words which were to be said, and Thelma and
the man at the studio each learnt the parts they were to say. I had
to be sure to start laughing when my "cue" was given;
but there was not much fear of failure on my part because I had
done so well on the day of the trial,</p>

<p>The record was made. It opened with a good long laugh from
me.</p>

<p>After I had given my first laugh the studio man began to speak
his part. He had to pretend to know nothing about kookaburras:</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "so <i>this</i> is the
Australian Laughing Kookaburra that I've heard so much about!
I must confess that I did not believe there was such a creature,
until I saw him and heard him. How <i>very</i> extraordinary!
It's <i>amazing!</i> He seems to understand <i>every</i> word
you say! Just one whisper from you and he <i>bursts</i> into
laughter! How long have you had him?"</p>

<p>Then Thelma said her piece:</p>

<p>"I've had him about seven years. I got him in the
bush when he was <i>quite</i> a baby! I had to teach him to laugh.
For weeks I coaxed him and chuckled to him. When he gave his first
little laugh he was so <i>astounded</i> that he nearly fell off the
chair! Now he will laugh for me at any hour of the day or night.
Won't you, Jacko?"</p>

<p>That was my signal, and off I went again.</p>

<p>As my voice died away the studio man cried,
"<i>Bravo!</i>" Then he went on to ask Thelma a lot of
questions about me; and she had to answer in the right places. He
admired the soft colouring of my body plumage and the bright blue
of my wings. The signal for my last laugh was when he said:</p>

<p>"I am struck by his poise. When he finishes a laugh he
fixes his eyes on an object and is so still that one would think he
was a <i>stuffed</i> bird!"</p>

<p>Stuffed bird! Well, I did laugh! And that ended the record.</p>

<p>We went back to Healesville after being in Melbourne a week.
Much as I had come to like the Doctor's garden, with its old
Moreton Bay fig-tree stump, I was very pleased to find myself again
among the scenes that I knew so well. Splinter wagged his tail when
he saw us come in the gate. Skippy had got used to being by
himself. He squawked and was not at all pleased with our return.
The Big Boss was delighted to see us again and had to be told all
about our adventures. I think he was very proud that I had done so
well.</p>

<p>I would have been very well content to have spent the rest of my
days in the garden overlooking the valley. But the Doctor had other
ideas. He said I was only at the beginning of my professional
career.</p>

<p>As well as going into the bush to study the lives of all the
wild creatures and writing about them, the Doctor makes
moving-pictures of them. He has one moving-picture called <i>Turtle
Island</i>, another called <i>The Life of a Platypus</i>, and
another <i>The Stone-age Men of Central Australia</i>. Nothing
would do but that he must make a picture of me. That did not cause
much upset, because it was done at home.</p>

<p>The Doctor set his camera up on the lawn. Skippy and I were
taken shaking our tails and clapping our bills under the garden
sprinkler; and we were taken making our toilets, afterwards. I was
taken catching pieces of beef which the Big Boss threw to me from a
distance; and I was taken in the act of laughing.</p>

<p>After a little time had passed the Doctor made arrangements for
my laugh to be broadcast from one of the wireless stations.</p>

<p>Again we went to Melbourne. I am afraid that I did not behave as
well at the wireless studio as I had done at the gramophone studio;
because, as well as laughing when I was told, I laughed at
everything and everybody.</p>

<p>They couldn't stop me.</p>

<p>Little Miss Kookaburra, the lady who conducts the
children's hour, was present. She is a mimic. After I had
done my solo we put over a duet. I started first. When she joined
in I stopped short and looked at her. It was the first time I had
heard a human laugh really like a kookaburra. Then I joined in
again and laughed my hardest. We cackled and gurgled and chuckled
together. Our voices blended perfectly.</p>

<p>If Miss Kookaburra had not been a really good mimic, I would not
have joined in with her. I once heard a lyre-bird broadcast his
imitation of my laugh. I took no notice of it.</p>

<p>There were big things yet to take place. The Doctor decided that
Thelma and I must appear at the theatre.</p>

<p>Once again we left our quiet home at Healesville and journeyed
to Melbourne. I never got to like the box in which I travelled; but
I learned that when I was put into it something strange was soon
about to happen. They used it when I was taken to the studios for
record-making and broadcasting.</p>

<p>The night that I appeared at the theatre the house was packed;
there were faces right up to the ceiling. We came on half-way
through the programme. I must have looked a very small bird on that
immense stage. First of all the Doctor spoke. He told them about
kookaburras, and got them all thinking about the times they had
been out in the bush and had heard us laugh. While he was talking I
sat on Thelma's wrist. I looked at the people and they looked
at me. I know that Thelma was nervous. It was the first time I had
been asked to face a big crowd. She was afraid lest the strange
surroundings should upset me and make me forget my laugh.</p>

<p>But I have never been bluffed.</p>

<p>Just at the right moment the Doctor finished his talk about me
and my tribe. He turned toward Thelma:</p>

<p>"And," he said, "our little friend, Jacko,
will laugh whenever he is asked!"</p>

<p>That was the signal. Thelma lowered her head and whistled softly
to me. The theatre was as still as the bush is sometimes. I
stretched, dropped my tail, and tipped my head. Then I let them
have it! It was the first time a kookaburra's laugh had been
heard inside a theatre. Every trill and chuckle rang out clearly
and filled the whole place. There was silence until the last note
and the last quiver of my tail-feathers finished together. Then the
applause brought the house down.</p>

<p>We were a great success.</p>

<p>After that, we appeared many times at the theatres and were
regularly on the air. I have filled two engagements a night: one at
the theatre and one at the broadcasting-studio.</p>

<p>The Doctor used me when he gave an exhibition of his
moving-pictures. Thelma and I were behind a screen. When we came to
the part of the picture which showed me laughing in the garden at
home, Thelma gave me the signal and I gave my laugh. There were no
talkies then, so the audience was always very surprised at hearing
me. The Doctor says we can claim that ours was the first sound
"synchronized'' film to he heard in
Australia&mdash;and perhaps in the world. The biggest surprise for
the audience came at half-time, when the lights of the theatre were
turned up and Thelma and I were discovered in front of the screen.
The Doctor then gave a little talk and I gave my laugh again. Quite
often the audience joined in.</p>

<p>We played for many nights and were so popular that the
"house-full" sign had to be hung in the entrance.</p>

<p>After we had played at the theatres in the city, the Doctor made
us pack up and go with him all over the country. We went to
Ballarat, and lots of towns in the bush. The Doctor got a native
bear called Blinky Bill. He had to climb up a little gum-tree and
eat leaves while I gave my laugh. He looked very nice swinging on a
slender branch. At one of the larger places the boys and girls
shouted so much for Jacko and Blinky Bill that the Doctor had to
take us on the stage before the films could be shown.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page072.jpg" alt="bill"

</p>

<p>Then came the day when the Doctor said we could go home. And
very nice it was to get back to our own quiet place among the
hills. Winter was coming on. There was a nip in the air in the
mornings and evenings. The swifts had long gone from the valley,
and the prize chrysanthemums which Thelma and the Big Boss are so
proud of were all in bloom. I was very content. It was nice in the
daytime to follow the sunshine around the garden, and at night, to
sleep feather to feather with Skippy on the chair in the kitchen.
We were glad to have that kitchen&mdash;all cosy and warm with the
day's cooking.</p>

Jacko The Caravanner</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page076.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p>JACKO was not to enjoy the peace and seclusion of his
garden-home &nbsp;for very long. The Doctor planned further
adventures.</p>

<p>One week-end he and Barbara visited Thelma and the Big Boss, at
Healesville. They had a great scheme for a caravan trip right up
the coast to Queensland. They would get a special motor caravan so
that they could travel in comfort. On the way north they would make
arrangements at the schools and the picture-theatres to give a
showing on the return journey, Jacko's name and fame had
spread. There were people who had heard him over the air and had
read in the newspapers of his appearance at the theatres. They
wanted to see him.</p>

<p>Thelma and the Big Boss thought the idea was a good one.</p>

<p>The project was talked about for a number of evenings, sitting
in front of the fire. They got maps and studied them, tracing out
the roads they would travel and the small towns at which they would
stay. The Big Boss joined in all the talk&mdash;but he
wouldn't be able to go, because he had to stay and look after
the store. It would have been much nicer had he been able to make
one of the party.</p>

<p>There came a day when we drove away from Melbourne on our long
journey. We had a well-fitted caravan, with wardrobes, a table, and
seats. A tent gave us the extra sleeping room we needed. There were
five of us: the Doctor, the driver, Barbara, Thelma, and Jacko.</p>

<p>Jacko travelled inside the caravan. He got all the jogging as we
travelled along and couldn't see much of the scenery. But
that was partly made up to him by the pleasure he had on being
released when we stopped for lunch and when we drew into camp each
evening. He soon came to know that when the rumbling and shaking
ceased the caravan was at rest. We could hear him pecking at the
wooden partition behind the driving-seat, to remind us that he
wished to be let out.</p>

<p>Our first camp was at Stratford-on-Avon. In the gathering
twilight we pulled in beside a belt of trees on the edge of a small
plain, and lit the first of many fires that were to twinkle beside
our caravan on the long journey north. Near by, we could hear the
river purling over its rocky bed.</p>

<p>The drive had made everyone except Jacko very drowsy. His
bedroom, at night, was in the driving-cabin; which was enclosed
with glass at front and sides. Knowing the early waking hours of
kookaburras, Thelma, before going to bed, covered the wind-screen
and side windows with waterproof coats and mackintoshes. She hoped
that dawn would come without Jacko knowing anything about it, and
that we would be able to have an extra hour in the blankets.</p>

<p>Jacko was not so easily deceived. Although in complete darkness
he knew when dawn broke. Perhaps he could feel the world beginning
to stir, and stirred with it. Promptly to time, he went off like an
alarm-clock. His laughter, though a trifled muffled, woke the camp.
As the last chuckle died away, groans came from within the caravan
and grumbles from the tent.</p>

<p>That morning the ground sparkled with a white frost under a
bright sun. The Doctor remarked that winter caravaning wasn't
going to be all bananas and bath-buns, However, it was not long
until a fire of gum-sticks was leaping up and a hot breakfast was
under way. While it was preparing, Jacko hopped about the grass
looking for titbits. He now had Barbara as well as Thelma to see
that he did not get into trouble.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page078.jpg" alt=
"grubs" width="608" height="750">
</h3>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Just before we were ready to start his laughter brought a family
of wild kookaburras over the tree-tops to have a look at him. They
sat in the branches of a nearby gum-tree, staring down at him. He
flattened out and stared up at them. They started to laugh and so
did he. The Doctor, who was seated near by, writing his notes,
looked up at hearing the choral rivalry. Suddenly one of the birds
flew down at Jacko. He was not afraid of them, singly. They
grappled beak to beak, wrestling and flopping and squawking around
the camp. The Doctor hurried to separate them. He had to force
their bills apart; and the wild bird had to be driven away.</p>

<p>Lunch-time found us on the high sandstone cliffs at Kalimna,
overlooking the entrance to the Gippsland Lakes. It was
Jacko's first smell of the salty breath of the ocean. He was
alert to the change in his surroundings and spent some time in
giving attention to the scene. But what interested him more than
the smell of the sea, and the sound of the breakers on the ocean
beach, were the rabbits we had for dinner.</p>

<p>We had bought two from a farmer's boy along the road. We
had them curried; and the kidneys and slices of liver fell to his
share. He may have been reminded of home. At Healesville he knew
the call of the rabbit-o man, and always greeted him with a burst
of hearty laughter.</p>

<p>At Orbost we ran into the tall timber. From there to well beyond
the New South Wales border, our road wound through the mountains,
under towering gums and stringy barks. On the ground beneath the
trees was spread a feast of colour. Where the bush-fires had been
the native heath had sprung up. Thick masses of red-flowering
spikes glowed among the burnt and blackened logs.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page080.jpg" alt=
"perch" width="438" height="400">
</p>

<p>When we were at rest, Jacko's favourite perch was on the
caravan steps. From there he could get a good look at everything
around him. His first thought, when he finds himself in a strange
place, whether a room, or a theatre, or a bit of bushland, is to
keep still and have a good look at all he can see. He turns his
head from side to side and appears to reflect on all that meets his
eye. No doubt he is making up his mind whether the new place is a
good one for a bird of his species. He is, also, very fond of
watching things happen. He will stop eating to look and listen, A
mental picture of our caravan is not complete without Jacko on the
steps.</p>

<p>At Gypsy Point, at the head of Mallacoota Lake, we camped close
by a red-flowering iron bark It was eighty feet high, and every
bough was laden with bloom. In each clump of blossom there were
brush-tongued lorikeets gathering the honey. The red and green of
their feathers harmonized so with the flowers and leaves of the
tree, that it was hard to tell bird from blossom, except when the
birds shrieked or fluttered from place to place.</p>

<p>At the sixteenth mile-post beyond the Victorian border we left
the Highway from the Wonboyn turn-off: to see the inlet and to put
in a few days fishing. The way was rough. For a long distance we
had to bump along a corduroy road. Four miles before we reached the
inlet a rotten log broke under one of the rear wheels of the
caravan. We found ourselves with a broken crown-wheel and pinion,
miles from anywhere.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but camp on the spot. Jacko was let out,
to view the scene and to hunt for wood-beetles. We put up the spare
tent, lit a fire, and filled the billy from the water-tank strapped
to the running-board. It was one of the times when we felt the
advantage of being prepared for mishaps.</p>

<p>Next day we were towed out by a motor lorry belonging to a young
sleeper-cutter. It was afternoon before we were able to get
started. It had commenced to rain, and the road was slippery. On
one side there was a bank and on the other a deep gully: so the
going was difficult and dangerous. In places, the wheels of the
lorry ahead spun and spattered us with soft soil. Twice we had a
front wheel skid&mdash;a helpless, breath-taking incident.</p>

<p>The dusk came down as we crept slowly along. We all felt that we
were truly adventurers. Once we side-slipped toward the gully and
almost skidded off the road. Thelma and Barbara screamed; Jacko
chuckled. The Doctor and the driver said some things that cannot be
put in a nice book like this. It was almost night before we came to
our camping-place.</p>

<p>We reached Narooma, about half-way between Eden and Sydney.
Narooma is remembered because when we awoke on the morning after
our arrival there was ice on the water in the kerosene bucket.</p>

<p>We had left the ranges. Our last memories of them were of the
spotted gums&mdash;steep hillsides peopled with a countless company
of them; slender, smooth-barked, and dappled with pastel shades of
green, cream, and mauve. Our way had broadened out. Our road rose
and fell over the undulations of open farm lands. The mountains had
gone back from the coast and were now a low blue wall in the
distance.</p>

<p>Our next camp was at Ulladulla, a fishing village which is also
the seaport of the farming district lying between the sea and the
ranges. From our campfire on the hill we watched the rising moon
spread a silver path across the waters. Beyond the dark stone mole
the breakers creamed across the reef. The lights of a little
coastal steamer showed up as she worked her way to sea; then went
out as she passed behind the headland.</p>

<p>Thelma had been telling the Doctor that Jacko sometimes laughed
in his sleep. He thought she was having a joke with him. One
midnight he heard Jacko cry out. The bird was the watchdog of the
camp. He always set up a squawking if strangers came about. Hearing
him, this night, the Doctor got up to have a look round. Torch in
hand, he made a tour of the camp, but could find nothing amiss.
Going to the caravan, he pulled aside the curtains and flashed his
light into the driver's seat, Jacko was asleep, with his head
under his wing. The Doctor was just about to turn away when Jacko,
still deep in slumber, emitted a series of queer little squeals and
chuckles.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page082.jpg" alt=
"asleep" width="350" height="347">
</p>

<p>The party like the name, Ulladulla.</p>

<p>"It is an aboriginal name, meaning safe harbour,"
said the Doctor,</p>

<p>A beautiful bay, a beautiful village, and a beautiful
name&mdash;we shall never forget it&mdash;Ulladulla! It trips as
lightly off the tongue as did its oysters off the palate.</p>

<p>At Nowra we crossed the Shoalhaven River, flowing deep and
still, with the mountains and its cliff-like bank on one side and
green farm lands on the other.</p>

<p>We passed Kiama, from which we carried memories of high, round
hills, criss-crossed with fences built of brown boulders gathered
from the surface of the ground. Here the mountains came close to
the sea again.</p>

<p>We then passed through a land of sleek cattle; of leafless
coral-trees whose every twig was tipped with a scarlet flower; of
slender, feathery-topped palms growing high up on grassy
hillsides.</p>

<p>The last night before reaching Sydney we camped on the top of
Bulli Pass, and looked down on a fairyland of lights, streaming
beneath us for miles.</p>

</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page085.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p>THE caravan party rested a while in Sydney. Relaying through 2UW
to Melbourne, the Doctor told the story of our travels up to that
time. Jacko was put on the air and was heard by his friends in
Healesville. He gave a solo laugh and then a duet with his own
record.</p>

<p>All the children, as well as those of a larger growth, who were
listening in anywhere between Sydney and Brisbane, were asked to
watch for Jacko on his way up the coast. They were told that he
would be prepared to reward them with a laugh in return for a nice
fat grub or a juicy spider.</p>

<p>The first reply to the invitation came from a young man at
Hornsby. He ran up to our caravan as we were travelling along and
stopped us.</p>

<p>"Have vou got Jacko the Laughing Kookaburra with
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Could you wait while I bring my fiancee? She's very
anxious to see him?"</p>

<p>So we held up our journey until he returned with his sweetheart.
She was a charming girl, and made a great fuss over Jacko. He
seemed pleased with her attentions and laughed for her. But in her
haste she had forgotten to bring him any titbit.</p>

<p>We lunched at Woy Woy among the orange groves on the hill-sides.
Barbara remarked that the trees looked like rows and rows of
old-fashioned crinolines.</p>

<p>Next morning we drove on through pale sunshine and
silver-shafted rain that set all the bush agleam.</p>

<p>We left the rain behind us and came to Newcastle. Here Jacko met
with a sad mishap. Some repairs were being made to the caravan at a
service-station. Jacko, on his travelling-perch, was sunning
himself at the back of the garage. On the other side of the fence
was the railway. He had fluffed his feathers and had sunk into a
comfortable doze when an engine drawing a long line of trucks full
of coal let out a squeal. He was so startled that he dropped from
his perch and fell into a pool of dirty oil. When he was fished
out, he looked not in the least like his carefully groomed
self.</p>

<p>He had to have several scrubbings with a tooth-brush dipped in
soap and water. Even then, all the grease was not removed from his
feathers. The caravan was held up two hours while he dried himself
in front of a radiator.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page086.jpg" alt=
"scrub" width="355" height="332">
</p>

<p>The invitation to meet Jacko must have been heard by children
all along the Pacific Highway. We particularly enjoyed meeting
those who lived out from the towns. We found them waiting for us by
the roadside, nursing their tins of worms and grubs.</p>

<p>Near Kambrack, we came upon two little fellows whose home must
have been somewhere near by, in the bush. They had something in a
tin; and it could be seen that they wished to speak to us, so the
caravan was stopped. They had collected beetles.</p>

<p>They were thanked and Jacko was brought out to meet them. Boys
and bird had a good look at each other. The boys must have seen
many kookaburras before; but only wild ones in tree-tops. Ours was
becoming a national character. And it was something new for them to
see one so closely that they could look into his eyes, study the
colour of his feathers&mdash;even put a hand on him!</p>

<p>They watched while he ate some of the beetles they had brought.
Then he was asked to laugh for them; which he at once did. They
stood close by, watching him and enjoying themselves greatly. Then
they ran home to tell Mum about meeting him.</p>

<p>We reached Brisbane, where Jacko had a great reception. For the
first time in the history of broadcasting in Queensland, a
kookaburra's laugh was heard through a chain of stations with
a link-up of over three thousand miles. That night Jacko laughed
from one end of Australia to the other!</p>

<p>Some listeners wrote and said they believed it was the
gramophone record that they had heard, and not the bird himself. On
the following Saturday, when all Queensland was listening to a
broadcast description of the races, he went on the air again. This
time, all were asked to listen carefully for the opening notes of
the record, and then for Jacko, who would join in. He did so, as we
knew he would.</p>

<p>After that there were no doubting Thomases.</p>

<p>On another occasion a young kookaburra who seldom laughed was
brought to the station to see if he would join in a duet with
Jacko. The result was surprising. For sixty seconds a rollicking
chorus spread through the air. To complete the experiment we put on
a record with the two birds. We had letters from towns far inland
and from the Gulf, stating that the trio recorded perfectly.</p>

<p>The amount of interest Jacko created wherever he went was
amazing. With Australians, the laughter of a kookaburra seems to
stand for things which have a dear place in their affections. Jacko
laughed his way into the hearts of his audiences; and such is the
infectious quality of his mirth, he seemed to endear himself as
greatly to those who heard him over the air from great distances as
he did to those who saw him.</p>

<p>In Brisbane we played to packed houses. The Big Boss had come up
from Melbourne and taken Thelma home. The care of Jacko was in the
hands of Barbara. That first night before an audience in Brisbane
was a trying time for her. As well as the city bookings, the Doctor
had been making arrangements all the way up from Melbourne to put
our programme on at the schools and picture-shows on the way home.
A breakdown on the first night would have been unnerving.</p>

<p>Jacko was taken to the theatre by Barbara, The box in which he
is carried has large holes bored in it These are for ventilation
and for him to look through. Being of an inquisitive nature he
thinks he is missing something if he cannot see outside. The holes
serve a third purpose. A finger poked through one of them serves to
show him that his friends are still with him. He bites the finger
gently as a signal that all is well. On the night that Barbara took
him to his first public performance under her unaided control, it
can be believed that the finger-biting was a source of comfort to
her as well as to him!</p>

<p>The time for his appearance on the stage arrived. He was placed
on a chair-back in full view of the audience, and Barbara stood
beside him. The Doctor was speaking. On a certain word Barbara
would give Jacko his signal to laugh. In the meantime it was his
duty to remain quiet and look intelligent.</p>

<p>He glanced at the audience, turned his head on one side, looked
down at the footlights, turned his head again and looked up at the
over-head lights, and then (heaven help us!) turned his back on the
audience, hopped to the seat of the chair, then to the floor, and
started to hop off the stage.</p>

<p>The Doctor went on talking. Barbara walked after Jacko. He
permitted her to pick him up without offering any protest. He was
returned to his place on the chair-back. Barbara stood stroking his
head and back and murmuring to him in undertones. She endured a few
tense moments. Came the word! Barbara stooped and gave him the
signal; and then (God bless him!) he stretched out and set the
house ringing.</p>

<p>That was the only spasm he ever gave us.</p>

<p>As well as playing at the larger places of entertainment we
visited smaller centres and the schools. He was so popular with the
children that we tried not to disappoint any of them. One day we
took him to the Home for Blind Children. Their pleasure was not
equalled by ours on seeing their little faces light up when, at
command, he pealed forth his merry notes. Everyone of them joined
in and laughed as heartily as did he.</p>

<p>A stuffed kookaburra had been brought along. It was passed
among-them from hand to hand. These little boys and girls,
"with wisdom at one entrance quite shut out," took in
through their fingers the size of the large bill, the stumpy legs
and feet, the softness of the feathers, and the general shape of
the bird.</p>

<p>It was one of our happiest engagements.</p>

<p>On another occasion, Barbara took Jacko and gave a show by
herself to some very small children who were unable to come to see
him. We had given an afternoon programme for children at one of the
theatres. Most of them attended; but the head mistress at one of
the schools had decided that the little ones in the infants'
class were too young to be trusted to make the journey.</p>

<p>As soon as Jacko's part of the show was finished, Barbara
put him in his box and went by car to the school. The disappointed
little ones were more than usually pleased by having this special
attention shown them. As well as having Jacko laugh, Barbara gave
them a talk.</p>

<p>She told the children how she goes to feed Jacko last thing
every night. He is always waiting for her. As she approaches his
perch she sees him peering at her with his little dark eyes. She
lifts aside the cover and says:</p>

<p>"Do you want your meaty-meaty, Jacko?"</p>

<p>Jacko says, "Whoo," in a thin little voice that he
keeps for replying to just that question. She gives him three or
four pieces and places a few more on the perch ready for him to eat
first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Jacko is not a glutton. He never eats after he is satisfied.
Barbara explained to the children that if she attempted to tease
Jacko by removing any of the pieces she had laid on his perch, he
rapped her fingers with his bill. That amused them very much.</p>

<p>After the talk it was learned that two of the children lived
along the road by which Barbara was returning. They accompanied her
and the bird in the car. It is said that we never forget our
contacts with the great. The children were much impressed by
finding themselves in the same car as Jacko.</p>

<p>He had a curious fondness for children. And they were so
interested in him that when he was taken through the class-rooms
you could have heard a pin drop. While a few words were being said
he would look around him as much as to say: "I know what I am
here for!"</p>

<p>There was never any trouble about getting him to laugh. But (if
tales must be told) there was sometimes a little difficulty in
keeping him quiet until the proper time for him to do his piece!
Once or twice, at afternoon performances, he laughed before we had
time to introduce him to the audience!</p>

<p>The children were always curious to know how Barbara made Jacko
laugh.</p>

<p>"Do you tickle his toes?" one boy called out.</p>

<p>"No, sonny," she answered, "I tell him a funny
story,"</p>

<p>Whenever he hears his own record played he will try to laugh it
down. But if it is played repeatedly he thinks there is a wild
kookaburra about and gives a frightened cry. Perhaps a
kookaburra's laughter is a challenge; and the ability to
laugh as loud and as long as another is needed for his sense of
well-being.</p>

<p>A friend has a home surrounded by stately gums which are the
haunt of many wild birds and to which the kookaburras pay daily
visits. Wishing to try the effect on them of Jacko's
gramophone laugh, he bought a record and awaited his chance. One
day, when a particularly fine looking wild kookaburra was close to
the house, the record was started. As the notes floated forth the
wild bird put his head on one side and listened in a very puzzled
manner. He left his perch and flew backwards and forwards past the
veranda, trying to find out where the laugh came from. Failing to
find the other bird he flew to a branch of a gum and tried to laugh
the record down. He failed; but that was not the end of it.</p>

<p>Next day he returned and brought three mates with him. They
surrounded the house. When the record was set going they all broke
into hearty laughter. The full chorus went on at double strength
for some time. They did their best to beat the "hidden
bird." When they could not, the four were quite silent and
quite mystified.</p>

<p>That the wild kookaburras are able to put two ideas together may
be proved by anyone living close to a railway in a country
district. Just before the time at which the train passes the birds
will be seen flying toward the line and perching, either on the
fence or on the telegraph-poles. They know that the swift and noisy
passage of the train will set the grasshoppers and other small deer
jumping, and so a meal may then be easily gathered.</p>

<p>BESIDES the arrangements made as we came up the coast, we had
received many letters inviting Jacko to visit places inland. We
decided to go to Ipswich and Toowoomba. His audiences at Ipswich
were record attendances. While there, we calculated that he already
had been seen and heard on the stage by more than one hundred
thousand children.</p>

<p>At Ipswich we parked the caravan on the lawn at the home of a
friend. Between his public performances Jacko had a happy time
hunting for juicy morsels among loamy beds of gerberas, shaded by
tall palms and wide-spreading, lavender-canopied jacarandas.</p>

<p>In Toowoomba he was on the air for eight consecutive nights, and
had a full house at the Empire Theatre, the largest in the city. He
was moulting and had lost his tail; but his laughter was as strong
and rollicking as ever. We watched over him anxiously. All our
dates booked up had, so far, to run to a time-table. We were
dependent on his good health and good humour. And he never failed
us. He was something more than just a kookaburra. He was
Jacko&mdash;laughing his way through Australia! Will there ever be
another one like him!</p>

<p>His worst enemies were his closest relations&mdash;the wild
kookaburras. We have known them try to get at him even through the
glass wind-screen of the caravan. He was not greatly bothered by
them on the run up the coast from Melbourne to Brisbane; because we
travelled almost every day and he was not at liberty except morning
and evening and for a short time during the midday halt. But on the
return journey we had often to idle a day or two between towns.
Then his (and our) troubles began. He had a friend and ally in Fred
Smith, who drove our caravan; but it was to Barbara he looked first
for help in time of woe. Sometimes, in these troubles with the wild
birds, victory came to us.</p>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>At Southport, fifty miles below Brisbane, we were resting at a
house which, like most Queensland dwellings, was built on piles
high enough to give head-room under the floor. This space had been
latticed in on all sides. It provided a cool and comfortable
dining-room, and, so we imagined, a safe place for Jacko.</p>

<p>We were having a meal when a wild kookaburra flew in through the
small doorway and set upon our bird furiously. Jacko fought back;
but his clipped wing put him at a disadvantage. Fred hastened to
separate them. He caught the wild bird and placed him in a large
wickerwork cage, holding him prisoner.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that he yielded to his fate with the wisdom
and good grace of all his tribe. Within an hour he was eating
scraps of fresh beef. While Jacko, happy and at peace, sat on his
perch alongside, watching him intently.</p>

<p>We kept him a prisoner until the morning of our departure. When
he was let go he flew into the branches of a eucalypt growing in
the yard and sat on a bough, seemingly not in the least upset by
what had happened.</p>

<p>What amused us was that it turned out that he was a married
kookaburra! Within three minutes his mate had found him. There
ensued such an outburst of wrangling and explanation as had to be
seen to be believed. His mate chevied and chased him from bough to
bough and from tree to tree, diving at him and squawking angrily.
It is said that every happily married male is just a little bit
afraid of his wife. We judged that he was more happy than most!</p>

<p>Jacko knew of the presence of the wild birds long before we saw
or heard them. He always gave a warning note, flattened himself,
and pointed with beak and body toward the stranger, remaining in
that attitude until danger was past. On one occasion he uttered his
warning note and flattened, although the Doctor, who was with him,
could at first see no birds about. After a long and careful
scrutiny the wild kookaburra's head and bill was seen, about
two hundred yards away. He was inside the top of a hooded chimney
pot, watching Jacko.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page096.jpg" alt="pot"
width="322" height="350">
</p>

<p>Along the Northern Rivers, when the days commenced to warm up,
Jacko called for his bath. He made his discomfort known to us by
ruffling and preening his feathers, Barbara understood his needs, A
watering-can was bought; and, if the day were more than ordinarily
hot he had as many as three baths a day. While the water was being
sprayed over him he would close his eyes, flip his bill, shake his
tail, and utter contented little squawks. When the can was emptied
Barbara would ask:</p>

<p>"Do you want some more, Jacko?" If he did he would
make the small "Whoo!" sound. When he had had enough he
would hop out of the spray, shake himself, and begin preening his
feathers.</p>

<p>He never forgot to let us know when he was hungry. He would hop
around after Barbara saying, "Whoo!"</p>

<p>"Does he want his meat?" she would ask.</p>

<p>Then he would call louder. When she produced the paper parcel
from the butcher, he would give full vent to his feelings.</p>

<p>If really hungry, his mouth would open like a small
carpet-bag.</p>

<p>For many miles along the Tweed our way ran under paper-barks
fifty feet high. Between the white stems we saw, in mid-river, an
island decked with tall palms.</p>

<p>We continued our southward journeyings. At each little town the
pictures were shown and Jacko made his public appearance&mdash;we
basking a brief moment in his reflected popularity.</p>

<p>Between towns, nature afforded us little glimpses of beauty to
delight the eye and refresh the spirit. Some of those bright living
pictures come before the inward vision, as this chronicle is being
set down.</p>

<p>At Mooball we found a wayside creek, covered like a patterned
carpet with the green leaves and purple bloom of water-lilies.</p>

<p>We came to a ferry where we had to ring a big toll bell. The
ferry came in response to our ringing and brought with it a load of
bare-footed school children wearing large sun-shade hats of many
colours. Jacko saw them stream ashore, and as they crowded eagerly
about him, greeted them with a laugh.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes pestered him as they did us. They bit his legs; and
we noticed him rubbing his head with his wing. In the mornings
(comical as it may sound) he looked tired about the eyes. Barbara
made a mosquito-net for him, and after that his nights were
peaceful.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page097.jpg" alt="net"
width="392" height="350">
</p>

<p>It was surprising to see with what interest he observed the
various affairs of the camp. One rainy evening Barbara had him in
the tent with her while she was preparing our evening meal.</p>

<p>He took keen interest in all that was done; the lighting of the
primus, the setting of the table, the opening of a tin of milk were
all watched by him with the closest attention. Barbara kept up a
little flow of small talk with him, and although he could not reply
in words, he seemed to give close heed to all she had to say. His
occasional "Whoo!" appeared to imply agreement with her
remarks.</p>

<p>The burden of defending him from his foes fell upon his friends.
This was no more than just; and was sustained with complete
willingness, although the state of siege in which we found
ourselves at times was a little exasperating.</p>

<p>At Mullumbimby, forty miles south of the Queensland border, our
camp was pitched under a shady gum on the banks of the
Brunswick's latana-tangled and mangrove-lined stream.</p>

<p>Here a family of kookaburras found us out. The gum-tree and two
telegraph-poles were points of a triangle surrounding us. The wild
birds took up positions on these places and remained with us
throughout the day. We were kept busy throwing stones and tapping
the bases of the two poles with a heavy stick in efforts to drive
our tormentors away. They merely flew from pole to pole and back
again to the tree, laughing at us derisively.</p>

<p>By night, we all had stiff arms and stiff necks as a result of
our efforts. A pea-rifle was bought, with the hope that the sound
would scare the birds off. The bullets were removed from the
cartridges and the latter plugged with soap; but the report of the
gun was, in consequence, made so feeble that it had no effect. We
then used cartridges with bullets; firing above and below the
birds&mdash;with little result.</p>

<p>During the five days we were in that camp we made frequent
sallies against the enemy; bombarding them with empty jam-tins and
similar noisy missiles.</p>

<p>By the Brunswick, a chorus of crickets, cicadas, and frogs would
start at sundown as suddenly as if a conductor had waved his baton;
continue for half an hour, and then abruptly end in a speaking
silence. Each evening we gladly welcomed nightfall with its hours
of assured peace. And in the fresh morning an orchestra of birds,
above which the fluting of the magpie rang clear and sweet, would
awake us.</p>

<p>Although Jacko usually uttered his warning cry and sought safety
when the wild birds came about, he was no craven. There were times
when he preferred to meet trouble unaided.</p>

<p>One evening we camped by a chain of rush-lined pools linked
together by a small, rock-bedded creek. Jacko was released. Glad to
be out of the caravan he hopped on to the perch of his box, which
had been put on the ground. Without pausing to look around him, as
is his custom, he stretched out and laughed loud and long. His
notes were at once challenged by a family of wild kookaburras in a
tree near by. The quick response must have taken him by surprise.
He looked at his enemies; but, instead of emitting his frightened
cry, he drove his beak into the ground several times and gave the
kookaburra's fighting call:</p>

<p>"Gur-waa! Gur-waa! Gur-waa!" expressing great
anger.</p>

<p>He hopped up the caravan steps and vented his wrath by pecking
and biting the woodwork. At the top of the steps he turned and
laughed another challenge.</p>

<p>No doubt his actions on that occasion were in obedience to some
primal urge that caution could not quell. Perhaps his wild
tribesmen understood. He was not attacked.</p>

<p>It was at the mouth of the Richmond River that Jacko had his
sensational encounter with the Bantam of Ballina and kept up the
best traditions of the House of Kookaburras. It happened thus:</p>

<p>Whilst the Doctor was interviewing the proprietor of the local
picture-theatre, trying to make a date with him to screen his
travel films, Jacko, in charge of the ladies, was enjoying a
sun-bath, upon an adjoining vacant town block, and at the same
time, poking about amongst the grass in search of beetles and grubs
and other small deer.</p>

<p>We are never sure whether Jacko first sees or smells or hears
his dinner moving below the surface. He keeps that secret to
himself. But certain it is, when once he goes into action, he
rarely fails to come out triumphant with some or another tasty
titbit.</p>

<p>Just as he had pounced down, and dug out a grub, which a moment
before had been snugly tucked away three inches beneath the grass,
the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>While Thelma and Barbara were watching him at work, the silence
was shattered by the loud challenging crowing of a bantam who, with
a train of demure and diminutive wives in tow, suddenly appeared
upon the scene.</p>

<p>Jacko, hastily swallowing his morsel, replied to the challenge
by throwing back his head and laughing heartily, and immediately
the fight was on. The little feathered fury flew up at him several
times, striking viciously with his spurs. Jacko, dodging cleverly,
drove home a blow with his powerful bill, and knocked his opponent
to the ground.</p>

<p>If ever there was an astonished bird, it was that little
rooster, who picked himself up and walked away, driving his family
ahead of him! The attack was quite unprovoked and uncalled for, and
could only be attributed to the innate jealousy of the bantam.</p>

<p>Along the Richmond, our road turned at times out of the
brilliant sunshine into the cool twilight of the tropical scrubs,
lit, here and there, by a blaze of scarlet salvias. Where the
sharply peaked ranges came close to the sea our road looped upward,
and we looked down into steep, palm-decked valleys. There were
glimpses of plantations down below; pasture lands vividly green;
still lakes, burning blue; and the thin, thread-like road up which
we had ascended.</p>

<p>Then the sea again. We camped on a green sward in the shelter of
gnarled old banksias. From the top of the dunes, the river-mouth
and channels, miles of tumbling white combers, and a drift of fine
sea-spray, as far as the eye could see, made an unforgettable
picture.</p>

</p>

<p>AT Maclean, Jacko played to a very exceptional audience. Our
programme had been seen by Father J. J. Durkin, who was greatly
taken with Jacko and who had found our pictured stories of the
birth of flowers and of coral islands in the making, both
"beautiful and interesting."</p>

<p>He was so pleased with our show that he came to speak with us
afterwards. He said there were twenty or more Sisters of Mercy in
the town and district. They were not allowed to visit places of
public entertainment, but he would very much like to have them see
our programme. Would it be possible to arrange a private showing
for their benefit?</p>

<p>Father Durkin left us with our assurances that it would not only
be possible for us to entertain the Sisters; but that it would be a
pleasure. In his car, making several trips, he brought the ladies
of the Church to the theatre.</p>

<p>That audience, comprising twenty-two Sisters in their sombre
garb, was the smallest we have ever played to&mdash;and the most
attentive. Some of them had never seen a moving-picture. They
followed everything with the closest attention. When Barbara
brought Jacko on the stage in mid-programme, the grave mood was
relieved by a smile. Here was a small, familiar friend in
unfamiliar surroundings. In the short time he was on view, before
and after his laugh, Jacko behaved with perfect decorum.</p>

<p>The Mother Superior spoke with us after the performance,
expressing the pleasure and thanks of the Sisters. She referred to
two or three incidents in our picture stories which had seemed to
her especially striking. When she mentioned Jacko her eyes were
moist.</p>

<p>Leaving the Richmond River and Clarence River districts behind,
we rumbled along the Pacific Highway, making good time in our heavy
caravan. After long miles of treeless river-flats it was pleasant
to be once again in the big timber-belts.</p>

<p>At one spot a large diamond snake crossed the road into the
bushes. Pulling up the caravan the Doctor jumped out and headed it
back to the highway again. Here he pinned it with a forked stick.
It was nine feet in length, beautifully marked in dark green and
yellow on the upper surface and a bright sulphur-yellow
underneath.</p>

<p>The Doctor, for his own enlightenment, wanted to bring Jacko
from the caravan and observe his reactions to a snake of this size.
But Barbara objected strenuously and forcibly. She felt that the
dignity of her small friend was involved!</p>

<p>At Coff's Harbour the editor of the local paper paid us a
visit, bringing his small son and daughter to see Jacko. He told us
that the kookaburra was his mascot:</p>

<p>"Never in my life have I made an important decision
without it being in some way associated with a Laughing
Jackass."</p>

<p>He had some stories to tell with a bearing on the point.</p>

<p>"I hope Jacko brings you good luck," he said, at
parting.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was something in his mild superstition. At any
rate, we can truthfully say that the caravan travelled four
thousand miles without a puncture!</p>

<p>Of all our happy camping-grounds, the headland of Nambucca River
stands out in memory. It is a twin headland, cleft by a small, deep
valley, overgrown with a wild tangle of wind-blown banksia,
she-oaks, and paper-barks, matted together by a semi-tropical
undergrowth of climbers and vines, beneath which small tree-ferns
find a footing, less than a hundred yards from the saltwater.</p>

<p>Our caravan was parked on the green sward overlooking the ocean;
in the shade of some white-stemmed paper-barks, growing on the
cliff. All about us was an immensity of sea and sky. White sand and
peacock-coloured waters spread out beneath us two hundred feet
below. The whole stretch of peaceful ocean, blue sky, and gentle
breeze was ours&mdash;just for the looking.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page102.jpg" alt=
"sward" width="425" height="350">
</p>

<p>Each morning we saw the two great monoplanes, plying between
Sydney and Brisbane, pass in majestic flight, while their shadows
sped swiftly over sand and sea.</p>

<p>From Woolgoolga, in the north, to Smoky Cape, where the
mountains go down to the sea, the coast is as wild and as primitive
as when first sighted and named by Captain Cook. Hereabouts, the
planes fly over the ocean for many miles. As they droned up from
the hazy distance, and passed out at sea with a triple-voiced roar,
keeping their schedule to the minute, one thought of the Endeavour
beating slowly along this lonely coast and of the changes wrought
in a short span of years.</p>

<p>Jacko watched these new monsters of the skies with an idle
curiosity as they flew past; but was not in the least disturbed by
them.</p>

<p>It was a different matter when the large, white-bellied
sea-eagle came over the headland, cruising along the top of the
cliff. How did he recognize the works of man in the air? How did he
know that the sea-eagle, which he had never seen before, was a bird
of prey? As soon as he caught sight of it, he sounded the note of
alarm, which never failed to bring us hurrying to him. He flattened
out on his perch, and pivoting on his feet, followed the
eagle's flight until it disappeared.</p>

<p>We spent a happy week at this delightful spot. One day, with
Jacko, we visited the local school. There was the head teacher, two
assistants, and one hundred and three pupils. It was not possible
to project the moving-pictures. But the story of Jacko's
early life and adventures was told by Barbara. She was heard by the
children in the most attentive silence. After the story concluded
they all joined in Jacko's mirth.</p>

<p>For several nights a small grey mouse had bitten through the
mosquito-netting of our improvised safe, and raided the provisions.
So we set a trap and caught the intruder; much to the good
housewife's satisfaction, and more so to Jacko's. He is
a knowing fellow, and took a personal interest in the setting of
that trap.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page103.jpg" alt="trap"
width="440" height="400">
</p>

<p>While in camp we had the greatest difficulty in keeping him from
prying into odd corners and under out-buildings, where we knew
danger might lurk in the shape of stray cats and snakes. The only
sure precaution would have been to shut him up. But we felt that we
owed him every hour of his liberty. So we had to keep constant
watch over him. It was his nature to pry.</p>

<p>The shelter-shed where we had our meals on the headland had the
floor raised about a foot from the ground. Several times Jacko had
attempted to dive under this, attracted by something we could not
see. One day Barbara called aloud that he had gone underneath and
was fighting a snake! Investigation, conducted on all-fours,,
proved that he was having an argument with a blue-tongued
lizard.</p>

<p>The position was dangerous. The blue-tongued lizard is a
powerful fellow; he is thick-set and about as long as a man's
forearm. His jaws open and shut like a clamp. At such close
quarters we knew Jacko was bound to get the worst of it in a
quarrel with a creature that can destroy a snake. We called to
Jacko, but called in vain. He stood facing the enemy, opening and
shutting his bill. There were anxious moments while a long pole was
hunted for. It would have been shocking to have seen our bird
killed before our eyes and we unable to get to his assistance.</p>

<p>With the pole we prodded at the lizard. That drew his attention
from Jacko; but the exasperating part was that the bird would not
take advantage of the opportunity to hop away. We managed, at
length, to push the lizard against one of the pillars supporting
the wood-work, and to pin him there.</p>

<p>After some coaxing, Jacko came hopping out. The honeyed tones
that pleaded with him to come from beneath the floor were different
to those he heard as soon as he was safe in hand. He had thoroughly
frightened us all. He got from Barbara the only real scolding he
ever had. He did not take it too much to heart.</p>

<p>His sense of hearing is very keen. He can detect a white grub
moving under the soil at a depth of three inches.</p>

<p>Time and again we have watched him flutter off his perch to a
spot two or three feet distant, and stand staring intently, with
his head cocked to one side. Alert and tense he waits; presently he
drives his bill into the grass, turning up the soil. Then steps
back and listens for the grub to move again. Greatly excited, he
vigorously wields his sharp-pointed pick and unearths the
titbit.</p>

<p>We tested his sense of hearing by placing some beetles in an
air-tight tin and putting it at various distances from him. He
could neither see nor smell the beetles, but could hear them moving
in the tin when it was six feet away from him. We could tell that
by his intense interest in the tin, and by the way he cocked his
head on one side.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

A Helpless Hero</b>

</p>

<p>AT Kempsey Jacko gave us all a bad fright. He became ill, We
thought for a while that we were going to lose him. That would have
been a very real tragedy for us. After all his many adventures we
were looking forward to taking him home in triumph to his native
hills. It was impossible for us to think of the remainder of the
tour without him. Between him and Barbara, who loved him then and
loves him still, there was a particularly strong attachment. She
had mothered him and knew all his funny little ways. Her daily care
for him was greater than the forward movement of this chronicle
will permit of telling.</p>

<p>Kookaburras have the peculiarity (in common with some other
birds, such as members of the owl family) of bringing back the
indigestible portion of their food. The fur and bones of small
animals and the hard, horny cases and legs of beetles and
grasshoppers are returned in the form of a pellet or quid; which
the bird discards with a flip of his bill.</p>

<p>Shortly after eating some fresh beef, at Kempsey, Jacko brought
up a quid and was very sick. He trembled all over, and his little
feet shook as with a palsy. These looked to the Doctor very much
like symptoms of poisoning. Preservatives in the beef were
suspected. Within half an hour the Doctor had interviewed the
butcher. He was assured that no preservatives had been used.</p>

<p>A fresh supply of beef was procured from another shop. But Jacko
couldn't keep it down for two minutes. He sat hunched on his
perch, shivering. His feathers were ruffled, his eye, not bright
and outward-looking, but dull, and seemingly turned inward on his
misery. We stood before him sadly perplexed: prepared to do
anything that might help him in his sad case, but feeling very
helpless.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page107.jpg" alt=
"hunched" width="400" height="348">
</p>

<p>We thought of white grubs. They were one of his favourite foods
and easily digestible. During that day&mdash;a particularly hot one
&mdash;we made frantic efforts to secure some. After some search,
we located an old potato paddock on the outskirts of the town. The
Doctor and Fred dug hard for about two hours, and at the end of
that time had found about a dozen grubs. A local man was offered
threepence a grub for every one he brought. He took the work on
eagerly enough, but gave it up within twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Jacko swallowed the grubs mechanically and without apparent
relish.</p>

<p>They reappeared in a very little while, semi-digested. He was
very sick. He seemed to understand that our sympathies were with
him; even though we could do nothing.</p>

<p>He watched our movements with his food-tins. Once, weak as he
was, he dived off his perch and tried to dig out a grub for
himself. It was dreadful, however, to see him shake and tremble on
his feet while thus occupied. He seemed to be battling with
himself.</p>

<p>The spectacle was a little too much for our feelings. He was
restored to his perch. Barbara shed tears and called him, "A
brave little man!" The Doctor had to walk away.</p>

<p>It was pluck that pulled him through that day. He seemed, for a
little while, to improve, and we began to feel hopeful. We recalled
the many miles he had come; the cold of an unusually sharp winter,
when even the gum-saplings as well as the orange-trees and
sugarcane along the river-flats of the northern district had been
burnt and blackened by the intense frosts. He had laughed his way
through with never an illness&mdash;the best traveller of us
all.</p>

<p>That night his condition became worse. At about eight
o'clock he had another bad bout of shivering. At times his
eyes closed and he looked the picture of misery. Night and illness
are not a pleasant combination. There is always the suggestion that
life will go out before the day breaks.</p>

<p>It was just possible that a certain friend, a very keen
ornithologist and field naturalist, would be able to advise us of
something we might do for Jacko. He lived in Toowoomba.</p>

<p>We put through a long-distance call. There was some delay, and
then, getting through, we learned that our friend was in Sydney. We
got his address: the Pioneers' Club. Again there was
difficulty in getting our connection. The young lady at the
switchboard understood our position. She was sympathetic and did
her best for us. There was nothing for it but to wait. It was
midnight before the call was put through.</p>

<p>Fortunately our friend was at home. He was more than a little
astonished to hear the Doctor's voice.</p>

<p>"When did you reach Sydney?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm speaking from Kempsey," the Doctor
replied.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Whatever is the matter?"</p>

<p>After telling him and describing the symptoms, he said:</p>

<p>"It seems very serious! How old is he?"</p>

<p>The thought of his years had never crossed our minds.</p>

<p>"Nine years last October," said the Doctor. He felt
as if he were dragging the words out of himself. He waited
anxiously for his medical friend's comment</p>

<p>"Well, the only thing you can do is to give him fifteen
drops of castor oil, and report to me in the morning."</p>

<p>The Doctor returned to camp with a bottle of oil. While Fred
held Jacko, Barbara gave him the fifteen drops from a teaspoon. For
a bird that never drinks&mdash;takes no liquid of any kind&mdash;it
looked like a case of kill or cure. We wondered how he would get on
with the medicine.</p>

<p>After one or two side-to-side flips of his bill, to get rid of
the oil remaining in his mouth, he sat quietly on his
sleeping-perch, we watching over him.</p>

<p>By morning, though still weak, his condition had clearly
improved. Each of us felt relieved. There was a different air in
the camp. When the Doctor called at the telephone exchange to ring
up his friend again, the girl operator smiled her recognition and
asked after Jacko.</p>

<p>His system had been badly upset. During the next day or two he
remained in a very feeble condition; and could digest neither beef
nor the grubs which we got for him.</p>

<p>We moved on to Port Macquarie and there received a letter from
Thelma, in answer to one we had mailed as soon as Jacko fell ill.
She told us that he had suffered two previous attacks similar to
the one he was then experiencing. The only cure was a complete
return to his natural food and total abstinence from raw beef.</p>

<p>Straightway we employed two boys, and driving them six miles out
of town, put them to work in a paddock strewn with fallen timber
and bark.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page109.jpg" alt="boys"
width="300" height="352">
</p>

<p>Their promised reward was five shillings each. They returned
with a good collection of shiny, black wood-beetles, white grubs,
spiders, crickets, and some worms.</p>

<p>From then on, Jacko's condition rapidly improved. Each day
the boys brought us fresh supplies. The food variety toned him up
and his natural courage and good cheer helped him along. In no time
he was well and strong again.</p>

<p>No one knows how long a kookaburra lives. Jacko, at nine years,
may be young or old, or just middle-aged. We hope kookaburras live
a long time.</p>

to the mouth of the Manning River on the motor launch <i>Ivy</i>.
The wild, wind-swept beaches and low, sandy ridges, covered with a
short, stubbly growth, reminded us of the sea-front between Carrum
and Frankston, on the shores of Port Phillip.</p>

<p>Of course, Jacko went with us. For his own safety we kept him,
while aboard the launch, in his travelling-box; making him content
himself with what he could see through the ventilation holes. We
were in mid-stream, on the return journey, when Barbara gave a
gasp:</p>

<p>"Jacko's out of his box!" she said.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page111.jpg" alt="box"
width="400" height="273">
</p>

<p>And he was! How he had managed it we don't know. He did
not seem to be aware of the fact that he was on a boat. He was
hopping along the narrow deck, and heading for the water. Had
anyone but Barbara attempted to catch him, he would, most likely,
have fluttered about and ended his days in the Manning.</p>

<p>Someone has said that twins in a family are a revolution, and
triplets a state of permanent insurrection. As the Doctor returned
the unwilling Jacko to his box, he wondered how the analogy could
be made to cover the case of a family that included an enterprising
jackass.</p>

<p>From Taree, we travelled all day up and down through the ranges
toward the Gloucester Buckets, which showed from time to time above
the skyline. On the way up the coast we had decided that the name
had been given to that curious formation of giant rocks because of
their resemblance to the buckets of a dredge. But, on our homeward
journey, we learned that the name was a corruption of the
aboriginal word <i>bukans</i>, meaning large rocks with an
echo.</p>

<p>We pulled up for lunch on the wayside and encountered a
veritable plague of golden beetles, better known as Christmas
beetles. They were in myriads. For a mile along the road the trees
were stripped of their leaves. Jacko, greatly excited, began to hop
about, catching them as they dropped from the branches, and eating
them as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Large numbers of them hung in clusters above the roof of the
caravan. Fred climbed up and filled a one-pound coffee-tin with
them in a few minutes. The gleaming mass, in all their beauty,
glowed with iridescent lights&mdash;living jewels of emerald and
amber&mdash;as brilliant as any we had ever seen.</p>

<p>It was at this unnamed camp that Jacko scored a victory over a
wild kookaburra. Our bird suffered the disadvantages of his
qualities and his circumstances. He was more than ordinarily gifted
in his own way. Realizing that he had been reared in captivity, and
was handicapped by his clipped wing, we had always been at great
pains to prevent the wild birds from coming to holts with him. So,
with much satisfaction, we are able to record that on one of the
occasions when our vigilance was eluded the attacker was driven
from the field with his self-esteem in tatters.</p>

<p>We were packing up. Jacko was sitting on the perch above his
travelling-box, taking his usual interest in our movements. No
doubt it was this that enabled the wild bird to come up unseen by
his sharp eyes. There was a flurry of wings, an angry squawking,
and the two of them were at each other, on the perch. Jacko opened
his beak and struck fiercely. The other at once retaliated, and
immediately, they were locked together, beak to beak.</p>

<p>Fighting kookaburras always strive to catch each other by the
lower bill&mdash;that one being the weaker because it is connected
to the head by a joint. Once that deadly grip is secured the
opponent is held fast. Jacko thus gripped his attacker, and, in a
moment, forced him off the perch and held him dangling in the air.
He then tried to toss and beat him against the perch, as he would a
mouse or a big lizard. The weight proved too great for him. The
wild bird broke away and rolled to the ground.</p>

<p>Undaunted, he rose again to the attack, with head-feathers
raised and the light of battle in his eyes. Jacko, with a lightning
lunge, struck him in the chest, and pulled back with feathers in
his beak as his opponent fell to the ground again.</p>

<p>It was a clear victory for Jacko. It happened so quickly that we
had no time to interfere. The wild kookaburra rose and flew into a
tree a little distance away. Of course, the bout ended in rival
peals of mirth. But, somehow, the laughter from the tree failed to
ring true.</p>

<p>We pushed on, well satisfied!</p>

<p>It was the hottest day's travelling we had yet
experienced. After climbing the steep pinches, we pulled up on the
summits and refilled the radiator from the water-tank.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, as we approached Gloucester, the sky
clouded over and the thunder rumbled and rolled in the distance.
Three miles out, we topped the last of the hills and left the
winding, valley road which had been with us for fifty miles.</p>

<p>The little town, ringed by fantastic peaks and pinnacles, is set
in a green plain, which stretches away to a line of timber marking
the course of the river.</p>

<p>Just as we settled into camp the storm burst, and the rain fell
in torrents. We found ourselves in company with a troupe of
performing lions and an electrical waxworks, whose wagons had been
passing and repassing us all the way from Brisbane.</p>

<p>That night, with the usual courtesy of the troubadours of the
road, the proprietors invited us to see the show. The trainer of
the lions was a gigantic native of Africa. Before the performance
he appeared in front of the tents and addressed the crowd. He was
truly a figure of barbaric splendour, clad in robes of purple and
gold, under the glare of the circus lights.</p>

<p>The show commenced, and the lecturer gave a lurid and graphic
account of each of the wax figures.</p>

<p>All the most recent horrors were represented here, as well as
some of the ancient ones&mdash;not forgetting the ever-green Kelly
Gang.</p>

<p>The storm broke out afresh. The lions of the circus began to
roar, adding their thunder to the rumblings in the mountains. As
the lightning became more frequent and vivid, deafening
thunder-claps reverberated through the town, and re-echoed from
peak to peak. The wind increased and the canvas roofs of the tents
bellied in and out. There was a rip of tearing fabric. Walls and
roof parted company in two places. The rain swept in and the
attendants rushed their precious figures to less exposed
places.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the storm-stricken and frightened beasts raised a
terrible din as the trainer, clad in his rich raiment of purple and
gold, whipped them through the blazing hoops.</p>

<p>It was an awe-inspiring spectacle. Combined with the other
events of the day, it proved too much for the Doctor. That night,
after he had gone to bed he had a dream. He heard a terrific
commotion of lions fighting and snarling in a general pandemonium.
Above the noise of the beasts he heard men shouting and cursing.
Jumping from the caravan, he ran across to the circus. He saw fur
and feathers flying in clouds! As he appeared, the lion-tamer
screamed:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page113.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p>"Call off your jackass!"</p>

<p>And the Doctor shouted back:</p>

<p>"You call off your lion!"</p>

</p>

<p>JACKO had a poor Christmas dinner at Wangi Wangi, on the shores
of Lake Macquarie. The hill slopes were very dry, with scarcely a
beetle to be found. So he had to fall back on the beef, which he
now ate again with gusto.</p>

<p>At Newcastle he again met city audiences. He appeared during
Christmas week at the Civic Theatre, before crowded houses; and had
a week's broadcasting, as well. One evening a number of
children were invited to the studio to see and hear him; and their
happy laughter went out over the air along with his. Good little
Jacko! He has "done his stuff" facing a sea of faces;
he has done it for a handful of children in little up-country
schools; and he would do it for you, with only you to hear him!</p>

<p>At Violet Town, on New Year's Day, he had a new experience
of the small kind that is dear to his heart. We were picnicking,
and were at rest in the shade of a tall angophora. Jacko was
hopping about our feet, busying himself turning chips over in
search of a morsel or two. A wasp came toward us carrying a spider
much larger than itself, which it had paralyzed in the usual way by
injecting a drop of poison into the nerve-centre. It was a
steel-blue bodied wasp, with long orange-coloured antennae. When
three feet away, it placed the victim upon a small grass tuft and
searched around, looking for a safe place to cache it. After
digging a hole in the ground, it would bury the spider and deposit
a tiny white egg alongside it, before covering it up. The larva,
when hatched, would thus have a supply of food awaiting it.</p>

<p>Jacko had been watching the activities of the wasp. He hopped
over to the spider, just as the wasp came back to it. The little
buzzing imp flew at Jacko as if to drive him away. He reached for
the spider and the wasp went down for it at the same time. Jacko
was first. He picked up the prey, and the wasp, irate, tried to
settle on his head. With a sharp movement of his bill he flipped it
away and hastily swallowed the spider.</p>

<p>Its quarry having disappeared, the wasp quartered the ground in
its fussy manner, within a foot of Jacko. He followed all its
movements, turning his head from side to side to keep his eye on
it. Not once did he attempt to pick it up or peck at it&mdash;some
inner knowledge warning him that the result would be unpleasant.
Then the wasp gave up the search and flew away.</p>

<p>It was the sort of small tragedy, or comedy, that is part of the
affairs of the natural world.</p>

<p>The field naturalist, very early in his studies, is confronted
with the fact of nature's unrelenting cruelty: big lives
devouring little lives. Consider the number of lives that have gone
to keep, alive and well, our quiet little friend Jacko during his
nine years on earth. What saves the spectacle of nature's
methods from being too painful to contemplate, is the knowledge
that there is seldom a conscious act of cruelty on the part of the
killer. Jacko, swallowing a mouse or a grub is as innocent of
murderous intent as the gentlest child.</p>

<p>We reached Sydney, and there, for his well-being, we found a
good supply of small frogs&mdash;the green and cream-coloured
piping Hylas&mdash;which were plentiful in Centennial Park.</p>

<p>Jacko liked to go to bed each evening a little after sundown. On
the night prior to leaving Sydney, we packed up for the run to
Melbourne and were busy at it until long after dark, He could not
understand why he could not go to bed. He kept hopping about and
jumping on the running-board, trying to get into his
sleeping-quarters,</p>

<p>The Doctor placed him on the cap of the radiator, hoping to get
rid of him for a little while. In a few minutes he was down again
and making for the cabin door. When shooed away he growled a deep
and guttural growl and tried to dodge past, He had a will of his
own.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page119.jpg" alt=
"shooed" width="286" height="350">
</p>

<p>The tent and the rest of the gear that was carried under the
front seat had been stowed in their place; and, at last, we were
finished. The Doctor placed Jacko's box in front of him.</p>

<p>"Uppity-up, Jacko!"</p>

<p>He jumped on the edge of the box, then up one more flight to his
perch. As the box was lifted through the door of the cabin he
cleverly ducked his head under the edge of the
mosquito-curtain.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page120.jpg" alt=
"ducked" width="350" height="404">
</p>

<p>Barbara gave him his supper and placed his early morning snack
beside him on the perch. The hangings that kept his bedroom dark,
and him secure from the annoyance of midnight cats, were let down.
Our good-night glimpse of him was his bright little eye peering at
us from between the curtains.</p>

<p>Although we still had some bookings along the South Coast of New
South Wales, we considered the departure from Sydney as the
beginning of the last leg of our journey home.</p>

<p>There came a day when we crossed the Victorian border. To Fred,
on his first trip south from his native Queensland, the event was
possibly the opening of a door to fresh adventure. But to two of
us, natives of the south-east corner of this wide continent, it was
like entering the front gate of one's home after an
absence.</p>

<p>It was raining as we coasted along the winding mountain road.
There was the smell of the wet forest and the music of trickling
streams. The giant trees stood about us, and the ridges were lost
in the low, grey clouds. Mile after mile the forest floor on each
hand was carpeted with fern. The smell of musk, damp with the rain,
was sweet to us.</p>

<p>The miles of our journeyings stretched far behind us. We had
come from the land of the sugar-cane and the banana. We had seen
bright seas flashing through thickets of poinsettia, hibiscus, and
palm; and crowds surfing in July. We had known nights, black and
velvet-soft, when the warm air was heavy with the scent of
frangipanni; and days when sharp colours and brilliant sun made
life seem as if it were being lived in the heart of a bright
jewel.</p>

<p>All that was behind us and our thoughts were reaching forward.
The dwelling on the hill above Healesville and the good friends who
waited there to welcome us filled our thoughts. Already we saw the
valley and the dark line of the Dividing Range beyond it. We were
anticipating the moment of arrival, and the commencement of the
story of our adventures.</p>

</p>

<p>We were home and I didn't know it. But that was not my
fault.</p>

<p>I had been away eight months, travelling with the Doctor and
Barbara. Eight months is too long for remembering things.</p>

<p>Barbara carried me in from the caravan and set me down on the
floor. I looked around me. I felt that there was something that I
ought to remember. What was it? The Doctor and Barbara stood
looking at me. A lady I did not know picked me up and started
talking to me. She called me Jacko and stroked my back; but I
didn't know who she was. She seemed very sad about that.</p>

<p>She put me down and went on talking to the Doctor and Barbara. I
hopped away to pry into things and find out if this new place were
a good one for a kookaburra. I had a look at the fire, and then I
hopped out of the room, into the passage. I stood still a while and
looked around me. It all seemed very strange; and yet it
wasn't strange. I hopped down the passage and into another
room. It was a nice warm room and in it was a chair that I looked
at for a very long time. While I was looking the strange lady came
into the room. She said:</p>

<p>"Hello, Jacko. Don't you know where you
are?"</p>

<p>She opened a drawer and took a knife out of it. Then she went
outside. I heard something go "Click!" It was the catch
on the meat-safe! I knew where I was! I was home, and that lady was
Thelma!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2301111h-images/page124.jpg" alt=
"click" width="400" height="382">
</p>

<p>Right there in the kitchen I stretched out and laughed. Thelma
came in with some scraps of meat. Barbara and the Doctor came
hurrying to see what had happened. Thelma gave me the meat; and
there was a great to-do!</p>

<p>After Thelma and Barbara and the Doctor had started talking
again, I hopped away to see what else I could find. At the back
door I stopped. There was a dog lying on the veranda. I never feel
sure about dogs, so I opened my beak at him. He did
nothing&mdash;just wagged his tail. He was a little dog with dark
hair, short and coarse. He had grey whiskers and sharp little ears,
and shaggy eyebrows and bright eyes that twinkled in his hairy
little face. While we looked at each other his stumpy tail kept
wagging,</p>

<p>It was Splinter.</p>

<p>I went past him and down the veranda steps, where I used to keep
my old knife-handle. Then I went on down the back path past the
patch of beans where the hawk nearly caught me.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the garden, under the peach-tree, I saw another
kookaburra. He was sitting down so close to the ground that his
toes were hidden in his feathers. He was looking up at some
starlings in the branches above him. When he saw me he opened his
bill and said "Quark!"</p>

<p>It was Skippy.</p>

<p>I almost began to forget that I had ever been away. It was a
nice, sunny afternoon as I hopped from one place to another,
remembering things. I found the lawn-mower alongside the house, and
I stood beside it and laughed.</p>

<p>That evening, at sunset, the Big Boss came home. The first I
knew of it was when I heard the front gate click, and saw Bill
bounding toward me. He licked my face and knocked me over to show
how glad he was to see me.</p>

<p>Then the Big Boss came up to us. He cuffed Bill's ribs and
picked me up. He talked to me a lot and seemed very glad to see me.
He carried me inside with him.</p>

<p>In the room where the fire was twinkling we found Barbara and
Thelma and the Doctor, There was a lot of talk and laughter and
shaking of hands. They seemed happy and glad to see each other. I
was happy, too.</p>

<p>That night, Thelma lifted me up to my perch on the old
chair-back in the kitchen; just as she used to do. It was very nice
to fluff my feathers in the pleasant warmth, and settle down.</p>

<p>Soon after my return from the long caravan trip, I commenced to
lose my feathers, and I heard the Little Girl Next Door, who is
growing quite a big one now, say to Thelma:</p>

<p>"I don't know what has come over Jacko of late; he
looks so deplorable and his manners are shocking! I can hardly say
a word to him, he is so cross and crotchety."</p>

<p>She did not understand what was the matter with me.</p>

<p>Moulting at the wrong time of the year is no joke for a jackass,
I can assure you.</p>

<p>However, in six weeks I was quite spruce again. Thelma said I
had come through it very well and looked handsomer than ever.</p>
