  The News</b></h2>
<p>Once again the bushland was filled  with excitement and chatter just as it was a few years ago when the news went  round that Mrs. Koala had a baby. You all know Blinky Bill very well by now and  again he is the cause of all this excitement.</p>
<p>And what do you think it is all  about? You&rsquo;d never guess. He&rsquo;s been chosen as the mascot for the Australian  soldiers&mdash;not to go overseas of course, as that would never be permitted. All  koala bears are protected as no doubt you know, and no one, not even Royalty,  is allowed to have one.</p>
<p>Why? I can hear you asking. I&rsquo;ll  tell you in a few words the reason.</p>
<p>These dear little creatures are  very delicate. They catch cold very easily. So just imagine how quickly they&rsquo;d  die if sent from warm sunny Australia to a cold climate with snow and ice in  the winter; and think of the bitter winds. Although the koalas have furry coats  and look very cosy in the winter time, their coats would not be nearly warm  enough to keep out the cold as a big ground bear&rsquo;s does.</p>
<p>Apart from their coats, they&rsquo;d die  of hunger, as a koala must have his particular gum leaves for food. Not every  gum leaf is suitable, and even in Australia the keepers of the parks where a  few koalas are in captivity have a busy time scouring the bush for the particular  leaves. They very often have to go miles inland to find the trees. There are  very few of these dear little animals left in Australia now; so you see how  very careful we must all be to guard and protect them.</p>
<p>The morning when the news went  round that Blinky was to be the mascot, broke clear and crisply warm. Blue  mists were rising from the hollows in the bush as the sun chased them away.  Only on very special occasions were koalas abroad at this hour, for as a rule  they played all night and slept all day, tucked away high up on the gum-trees  where the warmth of the sun made them very drowsy and comfortable.</p>
<p>This particular morning was an  exception. No one was more excited and farther from sleep than Blinky and Mrs. Koala,  Nutsy was excited too; but feeling a little bit sad, because she was about to  lose her playmate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who told you the news, Mrs. Magpie?&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala was standing on a branch of the tree that was their home, looking  very surprised as she listened to Mrs. Magpie&rsquo;s story.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page015.jpg" alt="magpie" width="591" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;No one told me. I heard it with  my very own ears,&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie replied. &ldquo;I knew something very important was  happening the way those telegraph wires were buzzing early this morning. They&rsquo;ve  become a dreadful nuisance lately and I&rsquo;m thinking of moving to another tree. I  rather liked to hear the wires humming when the men first put them up; but ever  since the war&rsquo;s broken out they buzz-buzz-buzz all night long without a minute&rsquo;s  silence. You know, Mrs. Koala, how annoying it is to be awakened just as you&rsquo;ve  gone into a deep snooze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s scandalous&mdash;simply scandalous,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala replied sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, that buzzing was  extra loud this morning, and Mr. Magpie became so irritable over it, he nearly  tossed me out of the nest with his twisting and squirming. At last I decided to  get up, as sleep was impossible. I couldn&rsquo;t sit there doing nothing, so I  thought I&rsquo;d see what all the buzzing was about. Mr. Magpie had always told me  not to go near those wires, as they&rsquo;ve killed more birds than enough. Besides,  he said it was none of my business what went on in those wires. Men are so  stupid sometimes, aren&rsquo;t they, Mrs. Koala?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Koala wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied. &ldquo;But go on, Mrs. Magpie, I&rsquo;m very interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;after making sure Mr. Magpie  was dozing, I hopped on to the wire. Certainly I felt frightened, because I did  not know if I&rsquo;d be alive the next moment. But nothing happened, so I put my ear  to the wire and imagine my surprise when the very first words I heard were <i>Blinky Bill</i>. I nearly lost my balance&hellip;  Oh dear! When I think of it now, I might have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  interrupted, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re still alive. Hurry up and tell me the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I discovered that a man in Sydney  was speaking to a man in Melbourne, and it appears that your Blinky has been chosen  as the Army mascot out of all the hundreds of other animals, birds and insects  that were simply dying to be the favoured one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how &hellip; how did it all happen?&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala asked in astonishment. &ldquo;How did they know of Blinky? He&rsquo;s never been  out of the bush for months now&mdash;not since the war started. There must be some  mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala was pulling a leaf to  bits as she gazed at Mrs. Magpie in agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t that young rascal tell you  all about it?&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie asked, just as surprised as Mrs. Koala had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said  rather crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i> his mother, too!&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie rejoined, &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s a sure sign  he&rsquo;s growing up when he doesn&rsquo;t confide in his mother. They all do it, so I  wouldn&rsquo;t worry, Mrs. Koala. You&rsquo;ll be awfully busy now. I&rsquo;ve told the news to  all our friends in the bush, and they&rsquo;re preening their feathers and licking  their paws and whiskers, making themselves look their very best before they  come to offer you their congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means there&rsquo;s no sleep for  me to-day,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not; but surely you don&rsquo;t  mind that? It&rsquo;s such an honour for you to have your son chosen,&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie  said kindly as she began to preen her glossy black and white feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go and have a word  with Blinky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala asked her friend to  excuse her for a short time, then climbing the old tree to its topmost branch,  she found Blinky curled up in his favourite corner, sound asleep as she  thought.</p>
<p>But Blinky was peeping through a  half-closed eye under the protection of a furry paw cuddled over his nose. He  could tell by the expression on his mother's face that something had happened.  Her wrinkles were deeper and her nose was twitching in a funny jumpy way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose she&rsquo;s found out, and now  I&rsquo;m in for a scolding,&rdquo; thought Blinky to himself, as his mother&rsquo;s puffs came  nearer. She was quite out of breath through climbing so quickly, and then the  shock of the news had made her heart thump very loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky!&rdquo; she said in a stern  voice, looking at her son with a deep frown. He made no reply, not even moving  a hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky! wake up,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala laid  a paw on her son&rsquo;s ear and gave it a sharp tug.</p>
<p>Blinky brushed it aside  impatiently and curled his paw tighter than ever around his nose. He even  pretended to snore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Blinky! Wake up at once.&rdquo;  His mother shook him until not even Blinky could go on pretending he was  asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the tree on fire?&rdquo; Blinky  asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> feel a bit warmer if you don&rsquo;t tell me what all this fuss is  about,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied crossly.</p>
<p>Blinky sat up, rubbing his eyes  and gave a big yawn</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked, blinking  in the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about this Army  business,&rdquo; his mother demanded. &ldquo;Mrs. Magpie has just told me you&rsquo;ve been  chosen for a mascot. What&rsquo;s the meaning of it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! <i>Me</i> to be the mascot!&rdquo; Blinky jumped up and down with excitement. &ldquo;Gosh!  won&rsquo;t Snubby be mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about Snubby&mdash;tell me  the truth at once. It&rsquo;s a fine thing when every one in the bush knows all about  this and your very own mother knows nothing &mdash;<i>nothing</i>.&rdquo; Then Mrs. Koala began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Gee! mother, I didn&rsquo;t mean to  make you cry and be cross&mdash;I kept it all for a surprise. Nutsy doesn&rsquo;t know  either so you&rsquo;re not the only one in the bush that doesn&rsquo;t know. You can&rsquo;t tell  girls secrets; they&rsquo;d only blab.&rdquo; Blinky stood looking at his mother very  sorrowfully as she wiped her tears away with the corner of her apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it really true, mother?&rdquo; he  asked timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Mrs. Magpie says she heard it  over the telegraph this morning and all the bush folk are coming round to shake  paws with us. And I don&rsquo;t know a thing  &mdash;not a single thing.&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  sat down on the bough with a deep sigh, folding her paws in her lap as she  looked forlornly over the bushland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it,&rdquo;  Blinky said, ashamed of himself for causing his mother all this worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied,  moving along the branch to make room for her son.</p>
<p>Blinky cuddled up against the warm  fur of his mother. She put her arms around him, giving him an affectionate pat,  and there they sat while Blinky told his story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take you away to the scene  where all this happened and you can see with your own eyes just exactly what  took place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  Soldiers In The Bush</b></h2>
<p>THE moon was shining brightly,  almost as clear as daylight, when Blinky slid down the big gum-tree and  scuttled as fast as his funny little legs would take him down the bush track to  his favourite haunt. It was in a sheltered hollow with a stream running between  banks of bracken and dried undergrowth.</p>
<p>Blinky liked these brown dry  places much better than shady moss-covered dips, because the warm stones held  all kinds of surprises under them: lizards, spiders, ants, centipedes, and  other bush wonders.</p>
<p>The shady places were full of  frogs and yabbies&mdash; and how he hated yabbies. One had grabbed his paw not long  ago when he&rsquo;d tried to fish it out from the stream. He&rsquo;d yelled with pain and  rage while the yabbie nipped all the harder. And when he shook it off, he found  a piece of his paw missing and blood trickling from the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannibals!&rdquo; he called them, and  kept away from their creeks ever since that day.</p>
<p>He loved to play with the frogs.  Although the Whoppers were down in the shady places, he found many bright green  little ones in the bracken by his own dry place and stream. These he called the  Littlies and had great games with them. There was father and mother Littlie and  the little Littlies.</p>
<p>Besides the frogs there were the  Taddies, They were always great fun.</p>
<p>And the rabbits were there in  dozens. The rabbits were great friends of Blinky&rsquo;s as they were always ready  for a romp through the bracken. Best of all they liked playing soldiers.</p>
<p>But the finest soldiers of all  were the bull-ants. &ldquo;Gee! they can fight,&rdquo; Blinky once told Nutsy, when  describing his soldiers to her. &lsquo;&lsquo;They kick and spit and shout,&rdquo; he said,  jumping about and trying to imitate his warriors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t shout, Blinky,&rdquo; Nutsy  contradicted him. &ldquo;You know they don&rsquo;t shout, so I&rsquo;m not going to get jealous.  I don&rsquo;t want to see your old soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>do</i> shout,&rdquo; Blinky replied indignantly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched them opening  their mouths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! They&rsquo;re yawning,&rdquo; Nutsy  scoffed, and waddled away to play by herself. &ldquo;He can keep his old ants,&rdquo; she  growled to herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather play with Mrs. Wombat&rsquo;s baby. <i>He</i> doesn&rsquo;t kick and spit and shout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ever after Blinky had this  particular place all to himself. And wasn&rsquo;t he glad?</p>
<p>Ever since the news of the war had  reached the bush folk he&rsquo;d been extra busy drilling his soldiers. Not every  night could he slip away from his mother&rsquo;s watchful eye; but very very often he  did, as Mrs. Koala was getting old and a bit tired of always keeping her son  under view. She liked to wander off to other trees and have a chat with old  friends. And on these occasions Blinky made the most of his opportunities.</p>
<p>Now, as he ran down the track to  his favourite place, he thought of all the drilling those ants and rabbits were  to do that night.</p>
<p>The rabbits were expecting him.  They sat around in ones and twos, ears pricked, and whiskers gleaming in the  moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Evening, soldiers!&rdquo; Blinky said  as he stopped and saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Evening, sergeant!&rdquo; a chorus of  small voices replied as paws were raised in salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any complaints?&rdquo; Blinky asked  sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sergeant,&rdquo; a tiny voice  piped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Blinky demanded  gruffly. &ldquo;Step two paces forward and make the complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small grey rabbit with white  paws hopped two paces towards Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please sir, Private Cotton-tail  pulled out my best and longest whisker to-night and he says he&rsquo;s going to keep  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private Cotton-tail!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted, &ldquo;fall out,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Private Cotton-tail stepped out  looking terribly frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got that whisker?&rdquo;  Blinky demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Private Cotton-tail&rsquo;s ears  immediately flopped down&mdash;a sure sign that he was not speaking the truth. He  tried to push it up with his paw; but it flopped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that whisker?&rdquo; Blinky  said, advancing towards the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, I gave it to Miss  Velvet Paws. She&rsquo;s taking great care of it. She asked me for a keepsake in case  I go to the war.&rdquo; Poor Private Cotton-tail looked very nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way you&rsquo;ll go to the war  is in a tin,&rdquo; Blinky said angrily. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you pull one of your own  whiskers out instead of stealing someone else&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not as long and shiny,&rdquo;  Private Cottontail replied in a very ashamed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; Blinky ordered,  shouting in a loud tone.</p>
<p>Private Cotton-tail hopped up to  Blinky, his large brown eyes wide with fear.</p>
<p>Blinky made a grab at his whiskers  and, giving one a fierce tug, pulled it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this to Miss Velvet Paws and  bring the other one back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Private Cotton-tail  replied meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you see Miss Velvet Paws  tell her no soldiers in future are allowed to give their whiskers away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Private Cotton-tail  hopped briskly away only too glad to escape from the giggles of all the other  rabbits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall in!&rdquo; Blinky commanded.</p>
<p>Immediately all the soldiers  formed a column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present arms!&rdquo; Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>Every rabbit raised a stick and  held it across his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; the order rang out.</p>
<p>Down came the sticks as the  rabbits held them out, each one closing an eye and looking along his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand at ease!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every soldier dropped his gun and  stood on his four paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick march!&rdquo; Blinky&rsquo;s order  snapped.</p>
<p>Hop, hop, hop, round and round the  well worn patch the bunnies went, their white tails bobbing up and down like  puff-balls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the rabbits stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky watched his soldiers, very  proud of them as they gambolled over the rocks, in and out of the bracken and  finally disappeared down their burrows.</p>
<p>Clapping his paws together he  waited a moment or two and then six little green frogs presented themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Evening, soldiers!&rdquo; Blinky  saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Croak! Croak!&rdquo; came from six  little throats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall in!&rdquo; Blinky commanded.</p>
<p>A great deal of leaping and  hopping went on, until at last the six little green frogs sat in a line  watching with large eyes the furry sergeant with his big brown nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any complaints?&rdquo; Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Croak! Croak! Croak!&rdquo; one of the  frogs replied, hopping up to Blinky, and without permission gave an extra large  hop and landed right on one of his large ears.</p>
<p>But Blinky was used to this. He&rsquo;d  found the Littlies much harder to train than the rabbits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked in  the deepest voice he could manage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sergeant, Hoppy Croak  grabbed my biggest fly that had taken me hours to catch&mdash;and he&rsquo;s swallowed it.  That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s making him bulge so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoppy Croak, come here,&rdquo; Blinky  ordered.</p>
<p>A fat little frog hopped over to  Blinky, ogling him with big round eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you steal Greenie&rsquo;s fly and  swallow it?&rdquo; Blinky asked severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave it to me, sir,&rdquo; Hoppy  Croak answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never&mdash;I only promised him the  legs,&rdquo; Greenie piped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of my ear!&rdquo; Blinky  ordered gruffly, flicking Greenie out with his paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at his big bulge,&rdquo; Greenie  croaked indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a grasshopper,&rdquo; Hoppy  Croak answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your case is very suspicious,&rdquo;  Blinky said as he looked sternly at the culprit. &ldquo;After drill you go down to  the creek and catch three of the biggest flies and give them to Greenie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three!&rdquo; Hoppy croaked in  amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And three grasshoppers!&rdquo; Blinky  replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make grasshopper soldiers as well as all the others,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoppy opened his mouth and gave  six large croaks; then tried to hide behind a tussock of grass. He was puffing  with temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three flies and three  grasshoppers! Wait till I get Greenie alone. I&rsquo;ll give him grasshoppers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; Blinky was calling  out his orders again, so Hoppy had to join the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six little green frogs held up  six little blades of grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six little blades of grass  were held out in tiny hands as six little croaks swelled from six little green  throats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick march!&rdquo; Blinky accompanied  his order with a rap on the ground.</p>
<p>Hop, hop, hop, over and over they  went, jumping stones and small bushes in their strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the double!&rdquo; Blinky shouted, and  away went the little frogs, hopping like lightning over each other and over  everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little frogs squatted on the  ground, their throats swelling in and out as they panted from the exertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away they went, like tiny gleams  of emeralds flashing in the moonlight, and six tiny splashes told Blinky they&rsquo;d  dived into the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I&rsquo;ll make those grasshoppers  jump when I get them,&rdquo; he said half aloud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make them into sentries. I&rsquo;ll&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Evening, sergeant!&rdquo; A small  voice interrupted Blinky&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Evening, corporal!&rdquo; Blinky  replied. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Any drill to-night, sergeant?&rdquo;  the voice asked smartly.</p>
<p>Blinky was speaking to Corporal  Bull-ant, one of his best soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll put them through their  paces, corporal,&rdquo; he replied puffing out his chest and looking his most  important look. &ldquo;Bring out the Blackies first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, sergeant,&rdquo;  Corporal Bull-ant answered saluting with his antennae. Running out to a large  mound of earth, he scratched the top with his hindleg.</p>
<p>In a flash the mound was covered  with black bull-ants, all looking for fight on the instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the boys for me!&rdquo; Blinky  said as he watched them muster, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to get a big stick all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up a large stick from the  ground he gave the order to march.</p>
<p>A long black column in perfect  formation marched past him, each soldier saluting as he went. Not an ant was  out of step; not one turned this way or that; every one of them looked straight  ahead. And at their side marched the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left, right, left, right,&rdquo; he  chanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chins up, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; Blinky gave the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any complaints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hundred soldier ants never  moved a muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good soldiers!&rdquo; Blinky said as he  gripped his stick a little tighter. He&rsquo;d seen them eat up Mrs. Snake a long while ago and he&rsquo;d never forgotten  it. They just might make up their minds suddenly to have a taste of him.</p>
<p>Their shiny bodies glittered  rather terribly&mdash;they looked so dangerous and brave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present arms!&rdquo; Blinky called.</p>
<p>Two hundred bull-ants curved their  stings over their backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a tiny drop of fluid shot out  of their stings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A waste of good stings,&rdquo; the  corporal muttered to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick march!&rdquo; Blinky gave the  order in a loud voice. Click-click-click-click&mdash;the ants marched past Blinky and  over to their home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another second not a soldier  was to be seen. They&rsquo;d disappeared as suddenly as they had come: all but a poor  old fellow who had fallen out of the ranks unseen by Blinky or his comrades.  Sheltering behind a pebble he rubbed his legs with his mandibles, trying to  stop the aching that his swollen joints produced.</p>
<p>Of course he should never have  left his home underground; but he was an old soldier and had been a fierce  fighter in his youth. It was very hard to sit back now and see the younger  fellows go out to fight and not be able to take part in it. So Grandpa Bull-ant  had smuggled his way into the company with sad results.</p>
<p>Of course he meant to crawl home  as soon as his old legs would work and in the meantime he&rsquo;d take it easy and  have a rest.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t know the red ants  were now on parade and they were ten times fiercer than his kind. If he&rsquo;d known  he would have died of fear, or tried his hardest to burrow into the ground,  hoping to escape their eyes and claws.</p>
<p>As he lay back against the pebble  thinking all sorts of things that ants do, he was suddenly startled to hear the  tramp, tramp of soldiers&rsquo; feet. Knowing his own company had gone home, horror  seized him as he realized the red ants were on the march. His old legs wouldn&rsquo;t  move. His sting wouldn&rsquo;t work and his jaws, once so strong, simply hung limp  now with fear.</p>
<p>With a tremendous effort he  managed to stand up just as the red horde was about to march on top of him. For  a moment his poor old head shook with fright, then slowly raising a swollen  front leg he gravely saluted.</p>
<p>Blinky who had been watching every  movement of the red ants more from fear for his own safety than anything else,  at once noticed the moment&rsquo;s hesitation in the column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; he said to  himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; he shouted very bravely. &ldquo;Corporal,  what&rsquo;s the matter down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very bristly fiery red ant waved  his front legs about trying to signal to Blinky. At the same moment the whole  company did the same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s their battle signal,&rdquo;  Blinky thought. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll have to go and see what the trouble is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time he reached the column,  poor Grandpa Bull-ant was nearly collapsing with fright. Two big red ants held  him in their grip, while the corporal only waited until Blinky arrived to give  the order of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo; Blinky  asked pointing to the two red ants who held old Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an enemy, sir,&rdquo; the corporal  replied. &ldquo;Shall we kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo; Blinky cried  angrily. &ldquo;Take your nippers off that soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s our worst enemy,&rdquo; the  corporal persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of my best soldiers,&rdquo;  Blinky replied, &ldquo;and no soldier of mine is going to be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the red ants looked terribly  annoyed. They waved their legs about more fiercely than ever; but Blinky was  not afraid now. He felt so sorry for the old black ant that he&rsquo;d have faced the  whole company of red ants to protect him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall back!&rdquo; he ordered sternly.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page031.jpg" alt="ants" width="587" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The red ants retreated a few  paces. Then, placing his stick on the ground beside Grandpa, Blinky spoke to  him kindly and told him to crawl on the stick and he&rsquo;d save him.</p>
<p>Poor old Grandpa Bull-ant  struggled vainly to climb on to the stick; but he was too weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a jiffy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you a leg  up,&rdquo; Blinky said as he helped the old fellow with a twig to climb on to the  stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe now,&rdquo; he said gently,  &ldquo;but I only saved you in the nick of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old ant waved his head from  side to side as if to thank Blinky for his kindness.</p>
<p>Carrying him carefully over to the  mound he placed the stick gently down. Old Grandpa lost no time in finding his  way down to safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come to the next parade.&rdquo;  Blinky thought. &ldquo;Or the next, or the next after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right. For deep down in the  earth the old ant was content to live quietly after that experience, and often  he took the baby ants on his knees and told them his thrilling story of  adventure.</p>
<p>Blinky drilled the red ants at a  safe distance. They were clearly very annoyed at his interference, and when he  shouted his final order to dismiss, he felt much happier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nasty creatures,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;But  they&rsquo;re good soldiers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the young fellow  we&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; a big deep voice said as a man in uniform with shiny  buttons on his tunic grabbed Blinky round the tummy.</p>
<p>It all happened so suddenly that  Blinky was too surprised even to think for a moment. But when he realized that  he was a captive, he behaved like the wildest tiger. He bit and clawed and  scratched. His behaviour was simply shocking.</p>
<p>No man was going to take him again  from the bush-land&mdash;not in that manner. If he went, he&rsquo;d go when he wanted to  and not before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the young fellow go&mdash;he&rsquo;s as  wild as a snake,&rdquo; a second deep voice said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just what we want for a  mascot,&rdquo; the first man replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> a mascot!&rdquo; the other man laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bundle of wild cats.  You&rsquo;ll never tame <i>him</i>. Let him go and  maybe we&rsquo;ll come across a nice gentle specimen later</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; the big  man said dropping Blinky suddenly as he got an extra savage scratch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> guess you&rsquo;re right, too,&rdquo; Blinky said aloud in deep angry grunts  as he rushed away up the track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Spicable animals,&rdquo; he growled  as he climbed the old gum-tree and quietly crawled past his mother, up into his  own favourite branch. There he sat for a long time, too angry to sleep&mdash;and very  frightened. But when the sun rose, it shone on a little bear, safely and snugly  cuddled up in the arms of the old tree.</p>

  The Competition</b></h2>
<p>ALL the next day and the next  night and many nights after that Blinky thought of his adventure and escape.  The men said he would do for a &ldquo;mascot.&rdquo; Whatever was that? He&rsquo;d never heard of  it before. Perhaps it was a new sort of pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t put me in a pie!&rdquo; he  growled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more he thought of it, the  more decided he became. At last he made up his mind to go and speak to Splodge,  the big kangaroo and his closest friend, about it.</p>
<p>Splodge would tell him what to do.  He knew all sorts of things&mdash;when it was going to rain, when there was to be a  drought (the thing most feared by all animals, excepting fire), when a  thunderstorm was on its way, when the day was to be fine, and a hundred and one  other marvellous things.</p>
<p>So Blinky, waiting until he knew  Splodge was in the neighbourhood&mdash;for the kangaroo travelled far at  times&mdash;slipped down from the tree one night and went in search of his friend. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably over at old Father  Wombat&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Blinky thought, for Splodge and young Wally Wombat were close pals.</p>
<p>Young Wally would dearly love to  leave the bush for a while and see the township over the hills; but he never  could just make up his mind to go, so he waited for Splodge&rsquo;s visits to hear  all the wonderful news.</p>
<p>Padding his way quickly along the  track to the wombat&rsquo;s home, Blinky became quite excited at the thought of  becoming a real soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a real gun that makes  real bangs and real smoke&rsquo;ll come out of its nose,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who says so?&rdquo; a voice  suddenly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&hellip;Blinky stopped dead. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; He  couldn&rsquo;t move or say another word. He almost began to cry with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was that big man with  the shiny buttons again,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very brave, aren&rsquo;t you? A  fine soldier you&rsquo;ll make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shurup,&rdquo; Blinky said rudely for  he now recognized Splodge&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon,&rdquo; Splodge replied,  hopping out on to the track and blocking Blinky&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;Did you say &lsquo;Good  evening&rsquo; or was I mistaken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just talking to myself,&rdquo;  Blinky replied uneasily. Although Splodge was such an old friend of his, he  still felt a little bit nervous when he got ratty. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got such big kickers,&rdquo;  Blinky once confided to Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I must be mistaken,&rdquo;  Splodge replied. &ldquo;And where are you off to, Master Blinky Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to Father Wombat&rsquo;s to see  you,&rdquo; Blinky remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I was just on my way there,  so we may as we&rsquo;ll go together,&rdquo; Splodge said. &ldquo;And what do you want to see me  about? Have you been into more scrapes and want me to go and ask your mother not  to whack you? Or are you thinking of getting married to Nutsy and want me to be  best man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t marry any one&mdash;I&rsquo;m  never going to get married,&rdquo; Blinky answered indignantly. &ldquo;Specially  Nutsy&mdash;she&rsquo;s mad, and she kicks when she&rsquo;s ratty. And I&rsquo;ve not been up to  anything&mdash;you&rsquo;re mad too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get mad in a minute, my lad,  if I hear any more of that impudent rubbish.&rdquo; Splodge replied as he gave Blinky  a shake. &ldquo;Do you know my great grandfather was the champion kicker of Australia  and that a bit of his kicking has been handed down to me?&rdquo; Splodge gave Blinky  another shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a headache,&rdquo;  Blinky whimpered.</p>
<p>Splodge placed the naughty little  bear on the ground. He was the kindest kangaroo in all bushland; but Mr. Blinky  had to be taught a lesson now and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;Walter  Wombat is waiting to see me,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter Wombat&rsquo;s home was a dark  large hole under the stump of a burnt out gum-tree. A few tussocks of grass  grew around the entrance; but apart from them no other greenery was near.  Everything had the appearance of being well chewed and clawed. Hanging like a  curtain over the entrance were the dead roots of the gum-tree matted with lumps  of clay and rock. But it suited the wombat family very well as it was so  secluded and off the bridle track that the cattle men used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going inside, Splodge,  are you?&rdquo; Blinky asked as they stood at the entrance. The sight of that dark  hole made him sick with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>me!</i>&rdquo; Splodge replied with a decisive shake of his head. &ldquo;That  tunnel will fall in one of these days and kill the whole family. I&rsquo;m always  telling them about it; but they take no notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terribly dark place, isn&rsquo;t  it, Splodge?&rdquo; Blinky shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where bad little bears go  when they get cheeky,&rdquo; Splodge replied.</p>
<p>Blinky ran back a few yards. &ldquo;I  think I&rsquo;ll wait over here, Splodge. I want to sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge did not reply, but thudded  the ground loudly with his hind foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! Hullo! Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Old  Father Wombat came waddling out of the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bless my whiskers, if it  isn&rsquo;t Splodge. Wait till I call Wally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Wombat gave a series of  harsh grunts, then a distant plomping about inside the hole heralded Wally&rsquo;s  appearance.</p>
<p>A fine-looking young wombat poked  his head around the entrance. He was wearing ear-phones and yards of tangled  roots, not unlike wire, seemed to be mixed up with his ears, eyes, hair and  whiskers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Wally!&rdquo; Splodge said with  a laugh. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re listening in. How&rsquo;s the set working?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too good,&rdquo; Wally replied,  looking a bit worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that cat&rsquo;s whisker you  bought me?&mdash; well, I&rsquo;ve lost it, and I&rsquo;ve been out night after night trying to  catch a wild cat to grab another from him. But the critters seem to know what  I&rsquo;m after and they&rsquo;re hiding. Miss Velvet Paws lent me a soldier rabbit&rsquo;s  whisker last night&mdash;but it bends&mdash;it&rsquo;s no good at all. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a  koala&rsquo;s whisker would be better.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page039.jpg" alt="whisker" width="545" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t got any worth  speaking about,&rdquo; Splodge replied&hellip; &ldquo;Here, take this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flicking out one of his own  whiskers, Splodge presented it to Wally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rsquo;&rsquo; Blinky sighed&mdash; &ldquo;That was a  close go for me.&rdquo; Feeling braver, he pattered over to Wally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Wally, How are you?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;pretty good, pretty good,  young fellow. Like to listen in? There&rsquo;s lots of noises going on to-night,  crackles and bangs galore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you, Wally,&rdquo; Blinky  replied in his very best manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to talk to Splodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I come to think of it, so  you did,&rdquo; Splodge remarked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind Wally&mdash;go ahead,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a mascot?&rdquo; Blinky asked  promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mascot! Never heard of it  before,&rdquo; Splodge replied looking puzzled, &ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;ve got the right name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pos-tive,&rdquo; Blinky said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it one of those new veg-tables  farmers are planting at present?&rdquo; Wally interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a veg-table at all,&rdquo;  Blinky contradictedr &lsquo;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s something to do with soldiers and the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rsquo;&rsquo; Wally said sharply&hellip; &ldquo;By  the way, Splodge, I heard they&rsquo;re going to hold a competition over in the  township for animals and birds and all us bush people&mdash;something about choosing  someone to bring good luck to the soldiers in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Splodge, rubbing his  nose. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first I&rsquo;ve heard about it. Who told you?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard it on the rabbit&rsquo;s whisker,&rdquo;  Wally said with a superior air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it open for all competitors?&rsquo;&rsquo;  Splodge inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the orniary people,&rdquo;  Wally answered. &ldquo;No snakes or trap-door spiders, or goannas, or dingoes or  foxes. They specially said they didn&rsquo;t want those brutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they say that?&rdquo; Splodge  looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word of honour,&rdquo; Wally  answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about koalas?&rdquo; Blinky asked  excitedly. &ldquo;Would they let me go in for the competition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Believe they would,&rdquo; Wally said  seriously, looking at Blinky. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have a hope. Your little  friend Nutsy might though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof&mdash;her!&rdquo; Blinky said  disgustedly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a soldier. She&rsquo;s frightened of guns and cannons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you&rsquo;d better ask your mother  about it,&rdquo; Wally said off-handedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take no &rsquo;sponsibility whatever.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell her. She&rsquo;d be as  cross as the red ants if she knew I was going,&rdquo; said Blinky hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please yourself,&rdquo; Wally remarked.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fellow wot keeps information to myself&mdash;eh, Splodge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if Blinky really wants to  go in for the competition I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s anything wrong in it,&rdquo;  Splodge answered, ignoring Wally&rsquo;s last remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose not; s&rsquo;pose not,&rdquo; Wally  replied with a grunt. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t go telling every one far and wide about it.  They specially said, it&rsquo;s to be secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky was dancing with  excitement. He asked Splodge a hundred and one questions on the way home, and  poor Splodge found himself unable to answer half of them. Blinky said good  night to him in a whisper. &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t forget to take me to-morrow night,  will you?&rdquo; were his parting words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here, cobber,&rdquo; Splodge  whispered in reply.</p>
<p>Blinky hardly slept a wink all  that day. He watched the shadows of the sun as first of all the dear old tree  cast long shades on the ground in early morning. Then, as the sun rose higher,  the shadows shortened until they lay right under the tall branches. Later on,  they chased one another round to the opposite side of the tree, growing longer  and longer and thinner and thinner, until at last the hot sun sank behind the  hills, and the shadows slipped away just as quietly as they had come.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala awoke. So did Nutsy.  And as Blinky was already scrambling about, there was no need to call him to  tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These leaves seem to be losing  their taste lately,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala remarked, as she nibbled one slowly. &ldquo;We need  the rain&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate rain,&rdquo; Blinky said, with a  growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad boy to talk like  that,&rdquo; his mother scolded. &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the rain, we&rsquo;d starve and die. And  not only us; but all the other bush folk too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could eat Farmer Brown&rsquo;s  veg-tables,&rdquo; Blinky retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>stealing</i>,&rdquo; Nutsy said in a shocked voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rsquo; Blinky contradicted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  only taking,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you think Farmer Brown  would grow his potatoes and cabbages without rain?&rsquo;&rsquo; Mrs. Koala asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He waters them with a big can&mdash;I&rsquo;ve  seen him&mdash; he doesn&rsquo;t use rain,&rdquo; Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; Nutsy scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;now,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala chided. &ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t have any quarrelling. I&rsquo;m going to see Mrs. Grunty. You may come with me,  Nutsy; but I want you to stay at home, Blinky, I just can&rsquo;t stand the way you  and Snubby have been fighting lately. It&rsquo;s disgraceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay home anyway,&rdquo;  Blinky remarked at once. &ldquo;Snubby makes me all fighty and growly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness knows what sort of a  bear <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> be when you&rsquo;ve grown up,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grumbly and nasty,&rdquo; Nutsy  answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have any girls for  children anyway,&rdquo; Blinky replied. &ldquo;They tell tales and cry if you punch them on  the nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could make hers bleed,&rdquo;  he growled in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of <i>that</i>,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said sternly. &ldquo;Come  along Nutsy, well go early and get home early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; Blinky thought to himself, &ldquo;I  hope Splodge won&rsquo;t be late,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Nutsy were scarcely  out of sight when Blinky heard the familiar thud, thud, of his friend&rsquo;s large  feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly&mdash;he&rsquo;s just missed them,&rdquo; and  scrambling down the tree Blinky greeted his friend with a whoop of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake it up, Splodge,&rdquo; he said  excitedly, &ldquo;Mother and Nutsy have gone over to Mrs. Grunty&rsquo;s and they won&rsquo;t be  long away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel I&rsquo;m doing the wrong thing,&rdquo;  Splodge replied. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see any harm in it,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky chattered away like a  monkey, as he rode on Splodge&rsquo;s back to the township. The moon rose, the tiny  animals of the bush scampered about, very busy indeed, as they chased here and  there, stopping for a moment to look at Blinky and Splodge with looks of  surprise. But they didn&rsquo;t pause for long, as Blinky was always doing something  that no other animal would dream of doing.</p>
<p>With long loose hops Splodge soon  covered the ground to the township. The hall where the competition was to be  held was easily found, as it stood in the middle of a small paddock with lights  streaming from its windows. Flags fluttered over the doorway, and the township&rsquo;s  band was playing outside.</p>
<p>Splodge hopped up to the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a competitor?&rdquo; a stern  voice asked him. </p>
<p>Splodge nodded his head. He  explained to Blinky afterwards that &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t nearly so bad to nod stories as  to tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your badge,&rdquo; the man  handed one to him. &ldquo;And how about the little chap on your back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one too,&rdquo; Blinky said before  Splodge could reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; the man exclaimed,  as he handed out another badge.</p>
<p>Inside the hall everything was  noise and excitement.</p>
<p>Splodge and Blinky had hardly  entered when a man shouted that the Grand March would commence.</p>
<p>Bang! A big drum crashed, and the  music started.</p>
<p>Splodge pushed Blinky into the  centre of the procession and then hid behind some tall palms standing in pots  at the end of the hall. He had a good view of everything as he could peep  between the leaves and&mdash;better still&mdash;not be noticed.</p>
<p>On a raised platform at the other  end of the hall sat several important looking men with medals and shiny buttons  on their coats. They fussed a lot with a pile of papers and made notes as the  competitors marched past. Splodge knew enough of the outside world to realize  they were soldiers. The judges, too, were soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they don&rsquo;t choose Blinky,&rdquo;  he thought sorrowfully, for a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d miss him terribly&mdash;but then I&rsquo;d be so  proud if they did,&rdquo; he thought again.</p>
<p>People clapped and shouted with  glee as the procession filed past.</p>
<p>First of all came Madam Swan. She  looked beautiful, and didn&rsquo;t she know it? Her glossy black feathers gleamed  like metal. She opened her wings just as she passed the judges and flapped them  majestically, arching her neck and hissing proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not near her  flappers,&rdquo; Blinky said to himself as he watched the display. &ldquo;And she hisses  like an old goanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judges seemed very impressed  with Madam Swan and made hurried notes just as the next competitor stepped  past. It was the brush turkey. How he spread his handsome tail!&mdash;throwing back  his head, marching with his legs held high and gobble-gobbling in his very best  manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had his gobbles,&rdquo; Blinky  thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give Nutsy a dreadful fright when she&rsquo;s asleeep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came Mr. Peacock, strutting  like a prince, flashing his tail, his head scarcely moving as he marched with  half closed eyes of disdain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not an Australian!&rdquo; someone  called out.</p>
<p>A great deal of noise and talk  ensued, and the procession halted while the judges told Mr. Peacock he was  disqualified. Still holding his head very high, looking neither to right nor  left, he strutted out of the hall, hissing as he reached the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tails for you,&rdquo; Blinky  remarked to a dear little wallaby who marched beside him, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s best not to  have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very rude,&rdquo; the little  wallaby replied. &ldquo;All the best birds and animals have tails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Blinky said rudely. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re  only good for getting in traps and being stamped on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little wallaby ignored his  remark. </p>
<p>A beautiful native companion was  now daintily stepping in front of the judges. Trying to impress them, she  danced a few stately steps, her pretty grey and pink feathers ruffling with the  movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s showing off,&rdquo; Blinky  remarked again to his little companion. &ldquo;I bet she&rsquo;s a girl bird. They all show  off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; the little  wallaby replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s silly,&rdquo; Blinky retorted.</p>
<p>The judges watched the lovely bird  with smiles of approval. And then came Mr. Lyre-bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; a gasp of admiration broke  from every one&rsquo;s lips, as the glorious feathers of his tail displayed the  graceful design. The soft fawn feathers, almost grey under the lights, looked  like velvet. Mr. Lyre-bird started to talk. He mimicked the kookaburra, the  thrush, the butcher-bird, and the owl. Then, just to show that he was even  cleverer, he barked like a dog, and gave the long-drawn wail of the dingo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got bats!&rdquo; Blinky grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; the little  wallaby replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;I hate dingoes and  dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judges gave a short clap and  then Mr. Lyre-bird moved on.</p>
<p>After him came Mrs. Pelican. She  stuck out her chest as she advanced, her large webbed feet going flip-flop over  the floor, and just as she stood right in front of the judges, she opened her  mouth as wide as she could, stretched her wings and flapped loudly. Ah! that  great big mouth! All the little birds began to flutter with fright as <i>snap</i>&mdash;her bill closed together like an  enormous nut-cracker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a mouth like that  with that scooper on it,&rdquo; Blinky remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d scoop up all the yabbies in one  go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her shopping bag,&rdquo; the  little wallaby answered. &ldquo;She puts all her fish in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before any further argument took  place, a loud long chuckling laugh echoed down the hall. Every one cheered, as  Jacko, the kookaburra, bowed to the judges. Throwing back his head, he chuckled  for a moment, then the gay laughter rang out again. And still he laughed, until  all the little birds joined in with song and cheeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of mine,&rdquo; Blinky  said proudly. &ldquo;We play games down by the creek. I dig out grubs for him and he  laughs for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a silly game,&rdquo; the little  wallaby scoffed, &ldquo;I play games of hops&mdash;they&rsquo;re awfully exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With grasshoppers?&rdquo; Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, with other wallabies and baby  kangaroos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; Blinky said. &ldquo;Fancy  playing with babies! They&rsquo;re always crying and having to be washed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo; the little wallaby  whispered, as a glorious note of song broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! It&rsquo;s only Mr. Butcher-bird,&rdquo;  Blinky replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s another friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Butcher-bird sang and sang.  Without a doubt his song was the sweetest of all. The notes floated like liquid  sunshine through the hall, as clear as the crystal streams of the bush, and  ringing with joy like the peals from a bell.</p>
<p>Then followed the lovely grey  thrush from the hills. Her song was quieter than Mr. Butcher-bird&rsquo;s, but just  as sweet.</p>
<p>Willie Wagtail came next. And didn&rsquo;t  he twist and twirl! his dear little voice sounding as gay as the voices of any  of the other birds.</p>
<p>All this time the judges were  making notes.</p>
<p>Each bird sang his sweetest and  best. Even the white cockatoo with his yellow crest and the galah with his  pretty grey and pink plumage screeched in tones that became quite musical. The  tiny brilliant finches and the gleaming green budgerigar twittered in  delightful chorus. And so it went on until the very last little bird had sung  his song and danced his dance.</p>

  Still the Competition</b></h2>
<p>STIR and flutter of excitement ran  through the hall as the judges announced that the animals would now march past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick up your tail; it&rsquo;ll only get  stamped on,&rdquo; Blinky advised the little wallaby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my tail and I&rsquo;ll do as I like  with it,&rdquo; was the reply he got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I hope it gets stamped and  stamped and stamped on,&rdquo; Blinky said rudely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh gee! Look who&rsquo;s here. I didn&rsquo;t  know Wally was coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Splodge was surprised as he  peeped through the palms and saw his friend. &ldquo;Now what chance does he think  <i>he&rsquo;s</i> got?&rdquo; he thought to himself.</p>
<p>But Wally Wombat thought he had a  very good chance of being chosen. He&rsquo;d brushed up his coat until it looked  really beautiful. His whiskers were polished and his nails cleaned. Certainly  he was not a very handsome fellow; but he was an Australian, and well known  too. He lolloped along and, as he stood in front of the judges, placed a grubby  old root on the stand. He was thanked for his gift. But several of the other  animals objected to this gesture and murmurs of disapproval were heard quite  distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bribe-ry,&rdquo; Blinky said  crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a root&mdash;stupid,&rdquo; the little  wallaby replied.</p>
<p>The animals were moving forward  and Blinky had no time to reply. But he felt very annoyed with Wally, and made  up his mind to tell him so afterwards.</p>
<p>A big red kangaroo hopped along  next. He thumped his tail with very big thumps, hoping to impress the judges.  They openly admired him&mdash;that was plain to see.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;d hardly finished his  fourth thump when he was nearly pushed out of place by Mr. Tree Kangaroo. <i>He</i> was handicapped in having no tree to  climb, just to show how clever he was at that stunt, but he was very impressive  all the same.</p>
<p>Then followed the Rock Wallabies  and all their relations. Such a lot of them. Their soft brown eyes glistened  with excitement as their turn came to pass the judges.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rock Wallaby even opened her  pouch to show her baby inside. Of course, this was a great thrill for every one  and it looked as though the competition would end there and then, because every  one admired and wanted to pat the baby. Nobody else had brought a baby, so Mrs.  Wallaby got extra points for that from the judges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy bringing the baby,&rdquo; Blinky  said with a nasty little grunt. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s only done it to put on side. She&rsquo;s a  shower-off! I could have brought my soldiers, only I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jealous!&rdquo; the little  wallaby exclaimed, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause you haven&rsquo;t a baby too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Blinky did a terrible thing.  He stamped his hardest on the little wallaby&rsquo;s tail just as she was about to  hop up before the judges.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page051.jpg" alt="line" width="612" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;!&rdquo; The poor little animal gave  a cry of pain and surprise and tried to pick up her tail between her front  paws.</p>
<p>The ceremony came to a halt while  inquiries were made as to the cause of the trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did it&mdash;he stamped on my tail,&rdquo;  the little wallaby wailed as she wiped a tear from her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never,&rdquo; Blinky shouted. &ldquo;Her  tail got in my way and I just tripped over it by mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stamped on it,&rdquo; the little  wallaby cried crossly. &ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s all aching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never&mdash;I never&mdash;I never,&rdquo; Blinky  shouted back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, this won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; one  of the judges remarked. &ldquo;It must have been an accident. I&rsquo;m sure that dear  little koala wouldn&rsquo;t do anything so spiteful. Come now, let us forget all  about it and go on with the competition. Your tail will soon be right, and it&rsquo;s  just as pretty as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge gave the little wallaby  a kindly pat, fondled her pretty soft nose and brought smiles to her eyes  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy calling her tail pretty!&rdquo;  Blinky thought with a grumble. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very or&rsquo;inary tail&mdash;it&rsquo;s not even fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Blinky was thinking all these  nasty things the little wallaby stood before the judges. She put both her  pretty front paws up over her eyes and began to rub them. Then she washed her  nose and one ear. She&rsquo;d no wonderful gifts to display like some of the birds;  but she showed every one just what she could do. And really she looked very  sweet.</p>
<p>Blinky&rsquo;s heart began to thump as  he watched this little performance. He&rsquo;d no tricks in particular; but he&rsquo;d try  to do a jump like the Littlies.</p>
<p>So as the little wallaby moved  away, Blinky took a few steps forward and instantly the judges seemed extra  interested. They walked right to the front of the platform with audible sighs  of &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly things,&rdquo; Blinky thought,  and then becoming very nervous and embarrassed he did a thing that surprised  even himself. He turned a somersault. His fat little body rolled over like a  ball, his big ears and furry paws all mixed up together. This performance delighted  every one, and Splodge became so excited he knocked over a palm, pot and all.</p>
<p>Fortunately every one was too  interested in Blinky to take any notice of Splodge&rsquo;s exhibition, and he gave a  grunt of satisfaction as he grabbed the palm and stuck it in place again.</p>
<p>The judges held up the competition  while they asked Blinky his name&mdash;where he lived, and who was his mother.</p>
<p>Blinky hung his head and all he  would say was, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Blinky Bill,&rdquo; a big black  rabbit explained. &ldquo;He plays with my cousins and all their cousins. He drills  soldiers in the bush and shows the frogs how to shoot.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; one of the judges  remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Blinky growled as he  walked away. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d brought my catapult, I&rsquo;d give old &lsquo;nonsense&rsquo; a shoot  on the nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh! he&rsquo;ll hear you,&rdquo; a voice  whispered by his side. It was the black rabbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you in the competition?&rdquo;  Blinky asked very surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course not,&rdquo; his friend replied,  &ldquo;there might be farmer soldiers and they&rsquo;d make me into a pie in two minutes if  they saw me.&rdquo; The black rabbit looked very knowing and intelligent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your mother know you&rsquo;re here  to-night?&rdquo; he asked, looking at Blinky inquisitively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get home quickly,  and the quicker the better,&rdquo; the black rabbit said sternly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be ramping  cross if she knew you were here, in fact as I came along the track tonight I  passed her with Nutsy going to Mrs. Grunty&rsquo;s and at that moment she was saying  she&rsquo;d &lsquo;get as cross as a hot-cross bun one of these days with you.&rsquo;&rdquo; The black  rabbit looked at Blinky, hoping he&rsquo;d made him feel just a little teeny wee bit  frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! When mother gets cross she  only shakes her paws at me and quivers all over,&rdquo; Blinky said screwing up his  nose. &ldquo;But&mdash;but, can a hot-cross bun get very hot and savage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As savage as Farmer Brown when he  sees me in his carrot bed,&rdquo; the black rabbit replied. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, p&rsquo;raps I&rsquo;d better go home;  p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;s best,&rdquo; Blinky said looking a little frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you had,&rdquo; the black rabbit  said severely, &ldquo;or p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ll be sorry all to-morrow that you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky began to think all kinds of  things. He&rsquo;d had a good few whackings lately, and recalled the last one very  clearly. His mother&rsquo;s paws seemed to be getting fatter and stronger.</p>
<p>Just as he began to feel really  frightened Splodge appeared, and lost no time in getting Blinky on to his back.  Then it was only a matter of an hour, and they were once more at the old  gum-tree.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Nutsy were still  away. Blinky&rsquo;s heart gave a bound with joy as he said good night to Splodge  after getting his promise to keep his secret.</p>
<p>Back in the hall, the competition  still progressed. The dear little field-mice, the bandicoots, the kangaroo  rats, the lizards, squirrels, bats, spiders, praying mantises, beetles and all  the other bush people paraded one by one.</p>
<p>And every animal, bird and insect  went home with the hope that he or she would be chosen for the good-luck emblem  of the soldiers. And every one thought he or she was the best. All except Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky&rsquo;s the best of the lot,&rdquo; he  said to himself as he hopped home after seeing his little friend safely tucked  away in the old tree&hellip; &ldquo;But I hope they don&rsquo;t choose him&mdash;Oh! I hope they don&rsquo;t.  But it would be wonderful if they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The Gymkhana</b></h2>
<p>AS Mrs. Koala listened to Blinky&rsquo;s  story she became more and more amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! Is that true,  Blinky? You&rsquo;re not telling me a fib?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;My, my, what next!&rdquo; were some of  the exclamations she made while listening to his description of the  competition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy Wally Wombat entering! I  don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be chosen. His nose and paws are always muddy through rooting  and grubbing about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d licked them clean as clean,&rdquo;  Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said, still  hardly able to believe all this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that you&rsquo;ve been  chosen!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala sighed, a big deep sigh. &ldquo;Well, Blinky, I feel sad that my  only son is going to leave me; but I must feel proud also. I&rsquo;ve still got  Nutsy, and she&rsquo;ll keep me company. You must change your ways, my son. Keep your  paws clean; brush your ears; and for goodness sake rub your claws over every  morning. They&rsquo;re disgraceful at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; replied Blinky  politely.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Koala had time to give  further advice, Mrs. Magpie reappeared, all her feathers ruffling with  excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up! Mrs. Koala. You and  Blinky and Nutsy are wanted down on Wattle Flat. There&rsquo;s going to be a gymkhana  for Blinky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala asked, quite  flustered and puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A circus! a circus!&rdquo; Blinky cried  jumping and dancing with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s like a circus,&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie  replied. &ldquo;Hurry up, <i>please</i>, they&rsquo;re all waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nutsy?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala asked  looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s down there; she and Snubby  and Mrs. Grunty,&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie replied. &ldquo;And I must be off. I&rsquo;m in the married  ladies&rsquo; race; and you&rsquo;ll be too, if you hurry, Mrs. Koala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; was all Mrs. Koala  could say, as she began to pat her apron into place, tuck a few stray hairs  over her ears, rub her nose, and then look for Blinky to give him a few orders.  But he was already at the bottom of the tree, nearly breathless with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A circus! Gee&mdash;a circus!&rdquo; he kept  repeating aloud. Carefully Mrs. Koala slid to the ground, and pattered down the  track after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! That Blinky,&rdquo; she said  over and over again.</p>
<p>On reaching Wattle Flat she became  quite speechless at the sight in front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come at last,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  said, as she took Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s all about,  I&rsquo;m sure; but I know my Blinky&rsquo;s all mixed up in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course if I&rsquo;d known about it, Mrs.  Koala, I&rsquo;d have put Snubby in the competition too,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty said a little  peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put Blinky there,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  retorted, &ldquo;He put himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene down in Wattle Flat was  enthralling. All the wattle-trees were in full bloom at this time of the year.  Great golden splashes of colour smothered the greenery of the trees, seeming to  turn the dry brown earth into a softer place for little animals to scamper  over, as many of the blooms had fallen, making carpets of gold under the  boughs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Mrs. Grunty sat  down on one of these patches to watch the gymkhana, and also to rest. Dozens  and dozens of animals and birds had gathered together. For they all loved fun,  and the news of Blinky&rsquo;s success had been a very good reason to hold a  gymkhana. Everything had been most hurriedly arranged; but that was all the  more fun.</p>
<p>Splodge had consented to be master  of ceremonies, and at the moment was making a speech. Beside him Blinky stood.</p>
<p>Splodge rapped the tree stump in  front of him with a large knobbly stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, please!&rdquo; He cleared his  throat &ldquo;You all know Blinky Bill has been chosen to go to Sydney. He&rsquo;s to be  the mascot for the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mascot!&rdquo; Blinky shouted,  interrupting Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be a mascot&mdash;I&rsquo;m  going to be the good luck for the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; Splodge  replied, &ldquo;I found out from Grandmother Owl what &lsquo;mascot&rsquo; meant. It isn&rsquo;t a pie  at all. Don&rsquo;t interrupt me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying, every one, Blinky&rsquo;s  been chosen, and I&rsquo;m opening the gymkhana to send him off. Please take your  places for the nut and stick race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a wild scramble at once.  Every one seemed to be in the nut and stick race. Some of the birds even had  entered for the race, and Mrs. Blue Tongue Lizard as well. She and the birds  held their sticks in their mouths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, <i>three!</i>&rdquo; Splodge shouted  as he gave a loud whack with his stick.</p>
<p>Off they started.</p>
<p>Wally Wombat and the black rabbit  were the first to get away. Then came several wallabies. Mrs. Koala and Mrs. Grunty,  who had not entered for the race, were delighted to see Angelina there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she&rsquo;d be too busy with  her new baby to come to-day,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t miss seeing Blinky  in the gymkhana,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala answered. &ldquo;You remember she was his nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Look at Mrs. Pelican! Fancy  <i>her</i> in the race,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty cried, as she rocked with laughter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pelican was half-running and  half-flying along. No sign of her nut and sticks could be seen as she had them  safely tucked away in her shopping bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be disqualified for <i>that</i>,&rdquo; Mrs.  Grunty announced, folding her paws tightly across her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s carrying them,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well carry them in a  bucket,&rdquo; her friend snapped. &ldquo;What chance has Snubby against <i>her?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clouds of dust swirled in the air  as the race was run. Blinky was in the middle of the crowd with Nutsy and  Snubby a long way behind. Wally Wombat dropped his sticks and had to fall out,  so did Miss Emu. She opened her beak to shout at a big kangaroo who pushed her,  and out fell the sticks.</p>
<p>Being a very bad-tempered bird at  the best of times, Miss Emu&rsquo;s temper now rose completely. It ran through every  feather of her body, up her neck and into her eyes, making them blaze, and down  into her legs. She stood on the side of the track and kicked dust all over the  other racers as they passed her.</p>
<p>Shouts went up from everybody.  Splodge bounded over and had to give her a good shake before she&rsquo;d stop.</p>
<p>Of course the race was held up.  Presently it started again.</p>
<p>But Blinky had not bothered to  stop. He knew Miss Emu quite well, and had had a shower of dust from her on  more than one occasion when he was cheeky. Having gained a good few yards, he  raced right in front of all the others. But Mrs. Pelican and the big kangaroo  were flying along now.</p>
<p>Then Blinky, who heard them right  on his heels, did another dreadful thing in a flash. He turned a somersault  right under Mrs. Pelican&rsquo;s big webby feet.</p>
<p>Down she came with a squawk and  screech, her wings flapping like sails, and right over her flopped the big  kangaroo. Fortunately he&rsquo;d used his tail as a brake on the instant and was able  to flop sideways as he fell, Blinky, who seemed to move like lightning, rolled  out of the muddle and sat on the ground rubbing his nose. He was out of the  race, as he&rsquo;d dropped his sticks and nut. But he didn&rsquo;t care, as he told  Splodge afterwards, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause Mrs. Pelican was a cheater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the shouts went up louder than  ever from the onlookers as Angelina Wallaby dashed to the front and, taking a  leap over a log that marked the winning place, was declared the winner.</p>
<p>The prize was a small bundle of  grass. There had been great difficulty in getting this prize. Splodge had gone  many miles through the bush searching for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; Angelina said  sweetly. &ldquo;My baby&rsquo;s been losing weight lately; but this will make him better  very quickly. He&rsquo;s had such pains in his tummy through eating the hard dry  grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before hurrying home with the  lovely grass, she went over to Blinky and rubbed her soft nose against his  dusty one; then hopped across to Mrs. Koala to tell her how pleased she was and  proud of Blinky.</p>
<p>Then hugging her precious bundle  tightly in her paws she raced home to her baby.</p>
<p>The next item on the programme was  the hole digging competition. The rules had been carefully drawn up, as some  animals had to be handicapped on account of their size, and some had much  larger holes to dig than others.</p>
<p>The competitors lined up in front  of Splodge once more. There was the big kangaroo, Wally Wombat, Peter Possum,  Billy Bandicoot, Winnie Wallaby, the little kangaroo rat, four tiny field-mice  and the black rabbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, <i>three!</i>&rdquo; Splodge brought  his stick down with a whack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off they go!&rdquo; the crowd shouted  as the competitors started to dig like mad. Great clods of earth came flying  through the air as the big kangaroo worked his powerful paws and claws.</p>
<p>Wally Wombat, whose hole was next  to the kangaroo&rsquo;s, also sent out lumps and rocks in all directions.</p>
<p>Peter Possum and Billy Bandicoot  raced for their lives; and Winnie Wallaby was going her hardest too.</p>
<p>The little animals sent clouds of  dust flying into the air as their tiny feet worked like lightning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Wally!&rdquo; Blinky shouted in  encouragement as he seemed to be a little in the lead. His funny face was  smothered in dirt and he looked terribly hot. The black rabbit&rsquo;s legs worked  like an engine.</p>
<p>As so much dirt and dust filled  the atmosphere, Splodge, who was judge, had to stand very close to the  competitors and of course Blinky had to be there too, as he couldn&rsquo;t miss  anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute to go!&rdquo; Splodge cried  out at the top of his voice, and the competitors put an extra spurt into their  digging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a minute to go!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Tails bobbed and feet worked at an  amazing speed. Rocks, dirt and pebbles flew everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Splodge shouted. </p>
<p>Most of the competitors flopped on  the ground, thoroughly worn out with the exertion. All of them were puffing and  panting. Splodge waited until the dust cleared away and then started to inspect  the holes. The tiny animals and the black rabbit were complimented on the  neatness of their digging. So was Winnie Wallaby. But as Splodge came to Wally  Wombat&rsquo;s burrow, he shook his head with dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s untidy and terribly rough,&rdquo;  he remarked. &ldquo;No method used at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave me such a rocky piece of  ground,&rdquo; Wally protested, feeling very downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the handicap,&rdquo;  Splodge replied, &ldquo;and you must abide by the rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair&mdash;there&rsquo;s favouritism  in this competition,&rdquo; Wally mumbled as he flung himself on the ground and sat  with his head in his paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be downhearted,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said kindly as she came up and patted Wally&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one-sided,&rdquo; Wally  growled. &ldquo;I never win anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge took no notice of Wally&rsquo;s  remarks. As he explained beforehand&mdash;the judge&rsquo;s decision was final. He moved on  to the big kangaroo&rsquo;s hole, and gave him a most friendly smile as he looked at  his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that!&rdquo; Wally cried  indignantly. &ldquo;The judge is smiling at him. That&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;re both  kangaroos. I told you it was all one-sided, and not fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  remarked. Splodge began to examine the big kangaroo&rsquo;s diggings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <i>splendid!</i>&rdquo; he said with  decided approval. &ldquo;So tidy, so round, and so smooth. It looks so safe, any  animal would be proud of a home like that. He&rsquo;d be safe from all danger in  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whack! a big stone hit Splodge  right on the chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did <i>that</i> come from?&rdquo; he  asked angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the hole,&rdquo; a chorus went  up from the onlookers.</p>
<p>Whack! another hit Splodge on the  nose; and whack! whack! two more followed in rapid succession.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page065.jpg" alt="nose" width="517" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Every one scattered in all  directions as the stones still came flying out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a dingo or a bunyip  in there,&rdquo; Splodge said rubbing his nose. &ldquo;Someone must go in and root him out.  I can&rsquo;t give my decision until I know what&rsquo;s in that hole, because I&rsquo;ve got to  inspect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in yourself,&rdquo; several  onlookers shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>me!</i>&rdquo; Splodge replied sternly.  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to volunteer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a voice replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo; Splodge said  turning to the big kangaroo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; he replied  timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big coot!&rdquo; Wally Wombat said  aloud. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s scared stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how about you going in?&rdquo;  Splodge said curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will for two kicks of a  rabbit&rsquo;s foot,&rdquo; Wally said puffing out his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on!&rdquo; the shout went up.</p>
<p>Wally felt he could not ignore  this challenge. And, although deep down in his tummy rumbles of fright ran  round and round, he decided to go.</p>
<p>Stalking up to the hole, with all  the onlookers and other competitors close on his heels, he gave a loud cough  and entered. It was fairly dark inside, and smelled very earthy and damp. Wally  gave another cough.</p>
<p>Immediately a deep growl answered  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; Wally cried,  shaking with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a silly goat!&rdquo; a voice  replied. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Blinky!</i>&rdquo; Wally exclaimed in amazement and joy. &ldquo;How did you get in  here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just slided in when the others  were watching Splodge judge the mouses&rsquo; and rabbits&rsquo; holes. And I&rsquo;ve still got  two more stones left,&rdquo; Blinky whispered excitedly. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d got the kangaroo  on the nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo; Wally said warningly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll  hear you. What am I going to do now? They&rsquo;ll be terribly angry when they know  you&rsquo;re in here and threw the stones. Whatever will I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them there&rsquo;s a big bunyip in  here,&rdquo; Blinky replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all too scared to come in and look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here till I tell you to  come out then,&rdquo; Wally whispered hurriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally rushed out of the hole  looking terrified. He pretended to stumble and fell with a big flop at Splodge&rsquo;s  feet. His eyes were turning round and round in a most alarming manner, while he  panted for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? What&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;  every one asked at once. Wally groaned and shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the biggest, enormousest,  ugliest <i>bunyip</i> I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my  life in that hole,&rdquo; Wally cried, &ldquo;And he says he&rsquo;ll eat the first one that goes  in after this. He&rsquo;s got a terribly big nose, and the hugest ears and growls  like a lion,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bush folk were terrified. Not  waiting to hear any more they fled to the other side of Wattle Flat, falling  over one another in their haste, the big animals grabbing up the little ones  and racing for dear life. And Wally ran too.</p>
<p>Once on the opposite side of  Wattle Flat they felt much braver and more secure; but large round eyes and  twitching noses told of the dreadful fright every one had received.</p>
<p>Gradually confidence came back to  the little bush folk. They began to chatter again, and talk about the next  event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the hole digging competition  hasn&rsquo;t been decided.&rdquo; Wally Wombat spoke up bravely. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s got to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the crowd buzzed with  excitement again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the winner? Who&rsquo;s the  winner?&rdquo; they shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prize goes to Wally Wombat,&rdquo;  Splodge announced. &ldquo;Considering the rocky ground he had to dig, and the time  taken, he was the fastest worker. By rights it should have gone to Robert  Kangaroo; but owing to the unfortunate incident, and not being able to inspect  the digging inside, I can only give him a consolation prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Robert,&rdquo; Splodge whispered  to his friend who stood at his side.</p>
<p>The big kangaroo looked very  annoyed, as he chewed a few stalks of dry grass, glancing angrily at Wally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your prize, Wally,&rdquo; Splodge  announced as he handed him two large sweet potatoes, stolen from Farmer Brown&rsquo;s  garden.</p>
<p>A great noise drowned his next  words. The animals shouted with delight and the birds sang as Wally solemnly  took the prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He deserves it,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  remarked with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>must</i> say I think so too,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  replied.</p>
<p>Robert Kangaroo was presented with  a cabbage leaf, also from Farmer Brown&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; he growled sulkily, and  immediately began to munch it, still looking angrily at Wally.</p>
<p>There was no time for further talk  about the hole digging result, as already the hop, skip and jump event was  starting.</p>
<p>As every one&rsquo;s attention was now  drawn to that race, Wally decided it would be safe to go and tell Blinky he  could come out.</p>
<p>Ambling over to the hole, he poked  his head inside and called out, &ldquo;Come on, Blinky, They&rsquo;ve gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky crawled out still holding  the two stones in his paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop them!&rdquo; Wally said sharply. &ldquo;If  they see you with those in your paws&mdash;well, goodness knows what will happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, take this,&rdquo; he handed Blinky  one of his sweet potatoes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! Wally, did you get the  prize?&rdquo; Blinky danced with glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I did,&rdquo; Wally replied. &ldquo;It  was the best hole in the competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course it was,&rdquo; Blinky replied  as he trotted beside Wally over to the crowd.</p>
<p>Nobody had noticed his absence as  every one was too interested in the hop, skip and jump.</p>
<p>Only the frogs and grasshoppers  were in this event, A row of stones had been placed at intervals along the  ground and as Splodge gave the word &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; barracking at once broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it Greenie! Go it Bulgie! Go  it Croaky! Shake a leg, Springy!&rdquo; and a dozen other names were called upon to  do their best.</p>
<p>The grasshoppers lost time, as  they paused on each stone for a second to prepare for the next hop.</p>
<p>But the frogs hopped over the  stones like corks bobbing up and down, not pausing for a moment.</p>
<p>Bulgie, the big fat green frog,  won the event and was presented with a large fly. It was a most popular win  judging by the clapping of paws and croaking of the other frogs.</p>
<p>Then the biggest event of all was  announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those taking part in the tree  climbing competition line up,&rdquo; Splodge shouted.</p>
<p>There was a rush at once over to  the tall trees skirting Wattle Flat. Great red gums whose branches towered  towards the sky had been chosen for the competitors to climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use you small animals  entering for this event,&rdquo; Splodge said sharply as the little ones pushed for  places. &ldquo;Only the best and fastest climbers can enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, wails of disappointment  were heard all around. But Splodge was determined and wouldn&rsquo;t listen to any  arguments about the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must abide by the rules,&rdquo; he said  curtly as he lined up the competitors. There were eight entrants. Two to a  tree. Blinky had to climb with Mrs. Possum, Mrs. Grunty with Mr. Goanna, Mrs. Koala  with Mr. Tree Kangaroo, and Nutsy with Snubby.</p>
<p>Each competitor had to climb the  tree on opposite sides and the first one to reach the top would be declared the  winner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear the ground,&rdquo; Splodge  shouted, pushing back the onlookers who crowded round the climbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get to your places.&rdquo; he called,  as the contestants each chose a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, <i>three!</i>&rdquo; and the  scramble began. Wallabies and kangaroos jumped in the air with excitement;  frogs croaked; grunts and shouts rose above the chirping of the birds. Even the  kookaburra&rsquo;s laugh was drowned in the noise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grunty was the first to  strike trouble. She made frantic signs to Splodge to intervene; but he shook  his head.</p>
<p>Mr. Goanna was behaving  disgracefully. Whenever Mrs. Grunty came level with him on the opposite side of  the tree, he poked his head round and hissed at her, frightening the life out  of her. Every time he did this, she slipped down a whole leg&rsquo;s length, and then  had to double her energy to get even again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame! Shame!&rdquo; the onlookers  cried angrily, &ldquo;Disqualify him.&rdquo; But Splodge refused.</p>
<p>Nutsy and Snubby started to  quarrel, scratching and clawing each other round the trunk of the tree. Mrs. Koala  was making rapid progress, as every time Mr. Tree Kangaroo passed her, he  waited until she was level with him then, swinging round to her side, pushed  her up as far as he could before he began to climb again.</p>
<p>Every one thought this wonderful.  But then Mr. Tree Kangaroo was noted for his good manners when it suited him.  There were times when he could be very nasty if he liked. Blinky knew all about  that.</p>
<p>Mrs. Possum and Blinky were also  making good progress, they were even with one another all the time, each  behaving in the very best manner.</p>
<p>Time was nearly up. Mrs. Koala and  Mr. Tree Kangaroo were only a few feet from the nearest branch. The bush folk  went wild with excitement. Splodge dashed about from one tree to the other,  peering up into the branches.</p>
<p>All at once a horrified cry broke  from the onlookers. Mrs. Koala was just about to grab the branch and become the  winner when a <i>snake</i> thrust his head over the top, and poked out his tongue at  her.</p>
<p>At the same instant a flash  through the branches and a loud chuckle caused the bush folk to shout and  screech with delight. Jacko Kookaburra shot like an arrow on to the snake,  whacking him on the tree and breaking his back. Thump! thump! thump! The snake  hung limp like a piece of rope, then was hurled to the ground.</p>
<p>But this terrible incident lost Mrs.  Koala the race. She was too terrified to continue climbing. So was Mr. Tree  Kangaroo. They slid down the tree to the ground, much quicker than they had  climbed up.</p>
<p>Nutsy and Snubby hadn&rsquo;t a hope of  winning. They were only half way up when the winner was declared.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grunty was almost on the  branch, when Mr. Goanna gave an extra loud and long hiss, and the poor thing  slipped down fully three feet with fright. But Mr. Goanna didn&rsquo;t win. Splodge  was forced to disqualify him as the bush folk were almost rioting.</p>
<p>Blinky and Mrs. Possum were even,  just as the branch touched their heads. But they had yet to climb on to it  before the race was over.</p>
<p>Mrs. Possum was noted for her  quickness and agility when it came to swinging on to branches, and Blinky knew  this only too well.</p>
<p>Like a flash he swung round the  tree and grabbing Mrs. Possum&rsquo;s long tail gave it a tremendous tug. Down she  fell, fully a quarter the length of the tree, before she recovered her balance.  And up on to the branch Blinky climbed, heaving his fat little body over, and  then standing up to wave to the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> all the good of tails!&rdquo; he  growled to himself, while down on the ground every one leaped, jumped and  shouted with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky Bill wins! Blinky wins!&rdquo;  The chorus went up from dozens of throats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s outrageous! Scandalous!  Wicked!&rdquo; Mrs. Possum shouted as she entered a protest.</p>
<p>But Splodge said: &ldquo;It was quite  fair, she should have kept her tail out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Blinky climbed down, he was  rushed and congratulated by every one. Wally Wombat was extra pleased over it  all. Still, he demanded his sweet potato back, explaining to Blinky that he&rsquo;d  get a prize and it wasn&rsquo;t fair to keep half of his as well.</p>
<p>But Blinky refused to part with  the sweet potato. He&rsquo;d hidden it safely away.</p>
<p>Splodge hopped up with a beautiful  bunch of the freshest and youngest white-gum leaves, tied round with grass, and  with a posy of wattle blooms right in the centre. Blinky snatched them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala, who stood beside him  looking very proud and slightly nervous, suddenly sprang to life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky! Don&rsquo;t snatch like that.  And say &lsquo;thank you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the lovely prize,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said, looking very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I won it!&rdquo; Blinky exclaimed  in a loud voice, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no need to say &lsquo;thank you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tsh! It&rsquo;s really not necessary,&rdquo;  Splodge said good-naturedly, trying to soothe Mrs. Koala. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so glad Blinky  has won a prize as we&rsquo;re holding the gymkhana for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the incident was forgotten in  further excitement, for other competitions were in progress all round the Flat.  The nest building caused a great flutter among the birds.</p>
<p>Mrs. Magpie won that event, as her  nest was considered the most original, having not only grass and twigs in it,  but bits of wire and hair.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thrush was very angry over  the result, She had even laid an egg in her nest&mdash;just to show how soft and  downy the nest really was.</p>
<p>But Splodge gave no extra points  for that, remarking that it was a nest building competition, not an egg laying  one.</p>
<p>Then there was the wood pecking  and hunt-the-beetle events. Also the games for the tiny animals; such as  see-saws and merry-go-rounds.</p>
<p>At last everything came to an end,  and very tired and sleepy birds and animals went home to rest. Blinky and Nutsy  padded along the track with Mrs. Koala.</p>
<p>Splodge went off in another  direction to his home. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you to-morrow night,&rdquo; he said, when parting  with his friends. </p>

  The Beauty Contest</b></h2>
<p>TOMORROW night came round too quickly  for Mrs. Koala but too slowly for Blinky. Already he&rsquo;d been down the tree  fossicking about for information as to what was going to happen next; but it  was a close secret among the bush animals, and not even Mrs. Magpie chattered a  word. So Blinky had to curb his impatience and just wait till the appointed  time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stop fidgeting and  scrabbling about?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala remarked irritably. &ldquo;I sometimes wonder how a bit  of skin manages to grow on your paws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t grow, it only came  with me when I was a baby,&rdquo; Blinky scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course it grows,&rdquo; Nutsy  corrected, &ldquo;same as your fur and nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Blinky shouted. &ldquo;Furs  and noses are parts of babies&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got them always. They don&rsquo;t grow on you  afterwards like scratches and tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  motioned to the children to be quiet. With her ear pressed to the tree-trunk  she listened for a moment or two, while Blinky stood watching her with very  round eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming at an awful bat,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala spoke excitedly, &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down and see,&rdquo; Blinky  said starting to slide down the tree; but his mother grabbed him by an ear  before he could escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo;  she snapped. &ldquo;Stay here and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it might be another circus  coming,&rdquo; Blinky said excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! I can hear music,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! It&rsquo;s a band. Trumpets and  drums like they had at the zoo when we were there.&rdquo; Blinky nearly fell off the  tree as he hopped and danced about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ridiculous nonsense you  talk,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said impatiently. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear it&rsquo;s our own gum leaf band?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! I&rsquo;m going down.&rsquo;&rsquo; And  before his mother could grab him a second time, Blinky was half way down the  tree.</p>
<p>The bush band came in sight as Mrs.  Koala and Nutsy reached the ground.</p>
<p>It was headed by Splodge who waved  a big stick about in his paws, much the same as the brave-looking gentleman who  marches in front of a real band swaggering his staff.</p>
<p>Then came Wally Wombat, the big kangaroo  just behind him, then the wallabies, rabbits, bush rats and dear little mice.  All of them held gum leaves between their teeth, blowing their hardest and  making the most confused din.</p>
<p>Of course the birds added to the  noise; but their music was sweet. Even Mrs. Kookaburra&rsquo;s laugh was toned down  to mingle with the thrush&rsquo;s mellow notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; Blinky was speechless for  once as he stared at the oncoming musicians.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Halt!&rdquo; Splodge&rsquo;s order rang out.</p>
<p>In a long file the band came to  attention as Splodge bowing low advanced towards the koalas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly,&rsquo;&rsquo; Blinky said with a  grunt. &ldquo;You look like a pigeon walking that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala grabbed her son and  administered a cuff over the ears.</p>
<p>Splodge took no notice whatever;  but advanced right up to Mrs. Koala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re holding a beauty contest,&rdquo;  he whispered quietly, &ldquo;And we want Blinky to be the judge as he&rsquo;s the most  important animal in the bush to-night There&rsquo;s been a lot of haggling going on  for some time now as to who&rsquo;s the most beautiful animal. So we all decided to  hold a contest before Blinky goes away,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure to muck it up,&rdquo; Nutsy  remarked. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s beautiful and what&rsquo;s not,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky, fortunately, was having an  argument with Wally Wombat, trying to grab his gum leaf, and did not hear Nutsy&rsquo;s  remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake don&rsquo;t ask him  to judge,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said in an agitated manner. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll upset every one and  pass rude remarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;some of them need it,&rdquo;  Splodge answered, &ldquo;because some of them who&rsquo;ve entered for the contest are just  too silly for words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, how foolish of them!&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Just look at Madam Hare. She  calls herself a glamour girl&mdash;Goodness knows what <i>that</i> means; but I do happen to  know she isn&rsquo;t a girl. She&rsquo;s old&mdash;very old&mdash;but all done up in her whiskers and fur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a bit snappy?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  inquired in an undertone. &ldquo;Or have I been misinformed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terribly snaky when she likes,&rdquo;  Splodge returned. &ldquo;And knows how to use her hind legs as far as the kicking  goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep Blinky away from her. There&rsquo;ll  be a fight, sure as owls,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Splodge turned to  find Blinky at the head of the band waving his sticks about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop those!&rdquo; Splodge ordered  sternly, hopping over to the culprit.</p>
<p>Blinky dropped the sticks like hot  cakes. He knew when Splodge had a certain gleam in his eyes that it was better  to obey him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the koalas please take their  places at the head of the band?&rdquo; Splodge called out in a dignified voice.</p>
<p>From nowhere Mrs. Grunty and  Snubby appeared, much to Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s surprise, and proceeded to take their  places with Blinky, Nutsy and their mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a surprise,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  remarked. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d had time to lick my coat up a bit. And Snubby isn&rsquo;t his  best to-night either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit of dirt&rsquo;s neither here nor  there,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied kindly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s personality that counts.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty asked  in a puzzled manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of you: your bad manners&mdash;good  manners&mdash; cross looks&mdash;clean toe-nails and things you think about others but don&rsquo;t  say,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a lot; but don&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; Mrs.  Grunty replied. &ldquo;Certain animals in this march wouldn&rsquo;t be here if I had a say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nasty personality,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  returned, &ldquo;and nobody with <i>that</i> will win the beauty contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on Snubby, keep with me.&rdquo; Mrs.  Grunty&rsquo;s tone was stern as she ordered her son to her side.</p>
<p>Blinky marched just behind Splodge  in spite of the order to join the koalas. Quickly, when Splodge&rsquo;s attention was  on other matters, he&rsquo;d picked up a large stick and followed Splodge&rsquo;s actions,  swishing it this way and that, twirling it in the air, then out and around.</p>
<p>On they went down to the stream  where the pale blue bush iris peeped through the green tussocky grass that  fringed the water. The stream glittered in the moonlight like a gown of silver  brocade splashed here and there with spangles of dew.</p>
<p>Timothy Spider had been patiently  fishing for an hour in a secluded corner of a rock overhanging a sheltered pool&mdash;his  line temptingly swaying on the almost still water, hoping to snare an unwary  mosquito or gnat. Now, as the bush people came down to the stream, laughing,  singing and chattering, Timothy felt distinctly annoyed. He puckered up his  face and snatched in his line.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page079.jpg" alt="web" width="580" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Pesky creatures,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;All  the bush to themselves and that&rsquo;s not big enough for them. No! they must come  and disturb my fishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for that koala child! He&rsquo;s  the one that pokes sticks down my home hoping to see me get ratty and come out  bristling to fight with him. I&rsquo;ll nip him on his most feeling part one of these  nights. Perhaps to-night if I get the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy slid into his crack in the  rock growling and grumbling all about fishing and koalas.</p>
<p>Splodge motioned to every one to  be seated, then proceeded to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;we&rsquo;re going to  hold a beauty contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo; Blinky shouted with  laughter. Splodge scowled in his direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of ill-feeling  lately amongst us and tonight&rsquo;s going to decide who is the most beautiful  animal. All must go down to the stream and wash off any make-up beforehand, as  this is to be just a skin and fur decision. Of course teeth and eyes, whiskers,  claws, tails and foot pads will be considered,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s judging?&rdquo; the shout went  up. &ldquo;Not you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the honour goes to Blinky,&rdquo;  Splodge replied.</p>
<p>A general commotion broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Him!</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty shouted. &ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m stepping out and my Snubby too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  returned sharply. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t hope to win &rsquo;cause you look so cross,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing&rsquo;s rubbish. Not  fit for respectable people,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty returned. &ldquo;Snubby! come here.&rdquo; But  Snubby was down at the stream splashing water all over himself and Nutsy too,  until they looked like a pair of drowned rats.</p>
<p>Blinky was missing too. When the  moment came to call the competitors together Splodge and Mrs. Koala had to  commence a hunt for him.</p>
<p>They found him down at Timothy  Spider&rsquo;s home poking a stick down the doorway, while Timothy, ramping mad, was  tugging viciously at the other end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala called  sternly. &ldquo;Come out of that at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s madder than the maddest  snake,&rdquo; Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Come out of it!</i>&rdquo; Splodge ordered.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re waiting for you to do the judging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Me!</i>&rdquo; Blinky was surprised. &ldquo;Mrs. Grunty&rsquo;s  not going to get a prize&mdash;not for the beautifullest animal&mdash; she&rsquo;s the ugliest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said looking at Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hope for the best,&rdquo;  Splodge replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>very</i> best,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  agreed.</p>
<p>Blinky regretfully left Timothy  Spider to a little peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all lined up ready and  waiting for you,&rdquo; said Splodge, &ldquo;and for goodness sake don&rsquo;t pick Wally Wombat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my second best friend,&rdquo;  Blinky said reprovingly.&rdquo; &hellip;I think he&rsquo;s the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala exclaimed. &ldquo;No  one could call him handsome. You must judge every one with an im-im-impartial  mind.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take each part separately,&rdquo;  Splodge announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paws and everything,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  added.</p>
<p>By this time they had joined the  gathering where a great deal of chattering and fluttering, scrambling and scuffling  was taking place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Line up for the judging,&rdquo; Splodge  called, while Blinky climbed on to an old tree stump.</p>
<p>The competitors sat round in a  semicircle, big animals at the back, and the tiny ones in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better take the small  animals first,&rdquo; Splodge whispered to Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I want the big ones first,&rdquo;  Blinky replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re most important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Splodge snapped. Then  calling out in a loud voice he told the kangaroos and wallabies to hop forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noses and teeth first,&rdquo; Blinky  ordered. &ldquo;Please twitch your noses and show your teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A display of twitching soft brown  noses and gleaming teeth took place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelina Wallaby&rsquo;s got the best  nose and cleanest teeth,&rdquo; Blinky called out. &ldquo;Put your front paws up for &rsquo;spection,&rdquo;</p>
<p>A row of soft padded feet flew up,  as each owner glanced at his neighbour&rsquo;s out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelina Wallaby&rsquo;s got the  cleanest and best paws,&rdquo; Blinky announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say <i>her</i> all the time,&rdquo;  Splodge whispered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be awful trouble if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my friend,&rdquo; Blinky growled.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open your eyes wide,&rdquo; Blinky  called out.</p>
<p>Large beautiful brown eyes opened  their widest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelina Wallaby&rsquo;s got the  beautifullest,&rdquo; came the announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey <i>you</i>&mdash;up there! What sort of a  show is this? It&rsquo;s all cheating and best friends,&rdquo; a big rusty coloured  kangaroo shouted out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of it for being rude,&rdquo;  Blinky shouted back.</p>
<p>A shower of dust flew up in the  air as the big kangaroo gave a violent kick and hopped into the bush.</p>
<p>This caused a great deal of  dusting and licking to go on amongst the contestants, amid angry mutterings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show your pouches!&rdquo; Blinky  ordered.</p>
<p>Of course, only the ladies were  able to take part in this display.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; one of the  gentlemen whispered to his neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until it comes to tails&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i>  where we&rsquo;ll score,&rdquo; his friend remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s got the best pouch,&rdquo;  Blinky shouted, much to every one&rsquo;s surprise. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re silly things and don&rsquo;t  count at all,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; Mrs. Kangaroo  cried indignantly. &ldquo;Let me tell you I&rsquo;ve carried eighteen babies, one at a  time, in my pouch. <i>Silly</i> indeed! You wouldn&rsquo;t be here if it wasn&rsquo;t for your  mother&rsquo;s pouch.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell her <i>her&rsquo;s</i> is  the best. There&rsquo;s going to be a row,&rdquo; Splodge whispered anxiously.</p>
<p>Blinky was just on the point of  saying something cheeky when he glanced at Mrs. Kangaroo and saw her advancing  towards him with a vicious look all over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours is the best,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause  it&rsquo;s the oldest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cheeky young cub!&rdquo; Mrs. Kangaroo  retorted, hopping right up to Blinky, while the rest of the animals turned very  pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rude to the judge,&rdquo;  Splodge warned. &ldquo;And remember&mdash;he&rsquo;s a soldier now. You can&rsquo;t say what you like  to him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dustpools!&rdquo; Mrs. Kangaroo  exclaimed angrily. &ldquo;Judge, soldier or anything else I&rsquo;ll box his ears if he&rsquo;s  rude to me again. Anyhow, this beauty show&rsquo;s no good. It&rsquo;s only for  scatterbrains and I&rsquo;m off home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-o!&rdquo; Blinky shouted&mdash;but not  till Mrs. Kangaroo was out of hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get down to tail now,&rdquo;  Splodge advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show tails!&rdquo; Blinky ordered.</p>
<p>Every animal swung round,  presenting his tail for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thump them!&rdquo; the order rang out.</p>
<p>Thump, thump, thump. Down came the  tails and up went the tails, dust smothering the owners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fatty Kangaroo&rsquo;s makes the most  dust; but Angelina Wallaby&rsquo;s is the best shape&hellip; &nbsp;And her&rsquo;s wins the first prize,&rdquo; Blinky gave  his decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo; Fatty Kangaroo sounded very  disappointed, but he was too much of a gentleman to complain loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about tying them for &lsquo;first  place?&rdquo; Splodge suggested, feeling very sorry for Fatty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d make a fat knot and all  quivery,&rdquo; Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean knotting them,&rdquo;  Splodge remarked irritably, &ldquo;I mean&mdash;make them even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Angelina&rsquo;s is shorter,&rdquo;  Blinky scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Let it go&mdash;let it go,&rdquo;  Splodge sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the beautifullest?&rdquo; Every  bush animal was impatient to hear the decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelina Wallaby,&rdquo; Blinky  announced.</p>
<p>A great deal of clapping greeted  his decision, and although favouritism may have crept in, Angelina was so loved  by every one that no one growled or grumbled. Indeed, all were very pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, the first  part of the contest is over; but we still have the smaller animals to judge.  Don&rsquo;t think you all haven&rsquo;t a chance&mdash;&rsquo;cause you have. The judge will decide and  his decision will be final. Take your places please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge helped to arrange the  smallest animals so that they stood an equal chance amongst their larger  friends.</p>

  The Winner Of The Beauty Contest</b></h2>
<p>MRS. GRUNTY, who had changed her  mind about going home, was an entrant. Also Snubby, Mrs. Koala, Nutsy, Wally  Wombat, the whole possum family, the flying squirrels, the bandicoots, the  rabbits (not forgetting the big black rabbit) and the teenies. All the rat  family were in it, and the mice too.</p>
<p>Tiny wee mice that lived in the  wheat fields had pricked up their pretty little ears when the news went round  that a beauty competition was to be held. Although so small they knew they were  very pretty to look upon, so they decided to show off their glossy coats and  sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! This is where <i>I</i> stand a chance,&rdquo; the big black rabbit  said to himself as he heard the news. All day long he sat in the sunshine  outside his burrow, licking and brushing his coat until it shone like satin.  His whiskers were wiped one by one between his paws, then rubbed up and rolled  round and round until they fairly gleamed like silver wire. Then his ears came  in for attention. Licking his paws, he wiped them over his ears, wiped and  wiped until he was tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear&mdash;my poor arms! How they  ache!&rdquo; Then resting a few moments he started all over again.</p>
<p>His nose was rubbed next, and then  each claw separately nibbled and tugged at until all were an even length. He  looked so handsome. In fact, if a fairy had come along and waved her wand over  him, surely a silk top hat would have appeared on his head and a frock coat  over his glossy fur.</p>
<p>But sad to relate, the big black  rabbit had a big brown worry. His tail was not the best. It looked scrappy and  worn. Certainly it had plenty of bobs in it and worked as well as any other  rabbit&rsquo;s tail; but it would be a severe drawback in a beauty contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t get me down!&rdquo; he  exclaimed aloud. &lsquo;&lsquo;After all the tail end is last. It&rsquo;s whiskers that count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same he was seriously  worried and went into his burrow to do a think.</p>
<p>Madam Hare was up to her tricks  too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show those young rabbits what beauty is!&rdquo; she chattered away to  herself, while combing her coat. &ldquo;I used to be the hare belle, and I&rsquo;ll be it  again if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lick, lick, lick. Over and over  her coat and face went the paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great thistlesticks! my coat is  moulting.&rdquo; With annoyance she gazed at the clumps of loose fur that lay on the  ground, never dreaming for one moment that the big black rabbit was watching  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old goat!&rdquo; he muttered  between his two long front teeth. &lsquo;&lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll make use of her moulted beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! My whiskers are going  grey,&rdquo; Madam Hare sighed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll soon fix <i>them</i> up. What&rsquo;s a few whiskers in  a beauty contest? It&rsquo;s the tail that comes first, and mine&rsquo;s beyond compare.&rdquo;  Twisting her head around she washed her tail until it fluffed up like a &ldquo;four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally Wombat had been busy too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! for goodness sake give up  that cissy business,&rdquo; his old father had growled. &ldquo;Lick, lick, lick, the saliva&rsquo;s  fairly running to waste; and I&rsquo;m all on edge watching you squirming about this  way and that. Makes me sick to think a son of mine should carry on like a peacock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a tail,&rdquo; Wally  sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d make <i>such</i> a difference  in points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>tail!</i>&rdquo; his father exclaimed. &ldquo;Now get that rubbish out of your  head. That&rsquo;s what comes of listening in on wireless sets. All the new fangled  rubbish and ideas you&rsquo;ve mopped up lately makes me disgusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re so handsome! The  really good tails are,&rdquo; Wally remarked in a half-ashamed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; Old Father Wombat shouted.  &ldquo;Half of them are mangy and the other half dragging in the dust till they look  like Farmer Green&rsquo;s cow-shed broom. And <i>that&rsquo;s</i> no beauty, I can tell you, my lad, as I felt it once round my hindquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same I wish I had a tail,&rdquo;  Wally persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go out and dig up a few potatoes.  Get your mind on to something useful&mdash;something to eat,&rdquo; his father growled.</p>
<p>Wally immediately rolled on his  back, wriggling about like a snake then doubling himself up in a ball. On to  his feet he sprang and shook himself violently, his glossy coat sheening in the  dim light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Old Father Wombat could  stand it no longer and stamped out of the burrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I stand a chance, Mrs.  Koala? I&rsquo;m not thinking any nasty thoughts now,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty said as she stood  beside her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you stand a chance. As  big a chance as any one else,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Snubby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Well&mdash;he&rsquo;s got to compete against  Nutsy and me,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala remarked, &ldquo;and I <i>must</i> say Nutsy looks sweet to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snubby looks beautiful,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course; but I think  a lady will win the contest,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala spoke quietly, as she tried to pacify  her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Line up! Line up!&rdquo; Splodge called  out briskly. &ldquo;All licking and brushing must cease as the contest is on.&rdquo; Quick  final pats were put to many toilettes, then the judging began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ears first&mdash;show your ears!&rdquo;  Blinky ordered.</p>
<p>Two rows of ears shot up. From the  largest that belonged to the koala entrants down to the teeniest mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flop them,&rdquo; Blinky called.</p>
<p>Flip-flop&mdash;the ears flapped in all  directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Black Rabbit has the bestest  ears,&rdquo; Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re common! Dozens of them  around here. The judgment should go to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Madam Hare who spoke so  rudely, and all the animals turned to stare at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got bald patches on yours,&rdquo;  Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have a bald patch, my lad,  if I was your mother&mdash;and not on your ears either,&rdquo; Madam Hare was as mad as a  March hare although her birthday was in October.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dotty&mdash;don&rsquo;t take any notice  of her,&rdquo; Splodge whispered to Blinky.</p>
<p>But Blinky was staring at Madam  Hare very hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got black whiskers on,&rdquo; he  muttered to Splodge, &ldquo;and her natural ones are white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Splodge pulled  himself up with a jerk as he stared at Madam Hare. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s treachery here!&rdquo; he  exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll investigate.&rdquo; Bounding over to Madam Hare he placed a paw on  her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your paws off me!&rdquo; Madam  Hare shouted, pushing Splodge&rsquo;s paw away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You follow me or there&rsquo;ll be a  shindy,&rdquo; Splodge growled as he gritted his teeth. &ldquo;What are you doing with  those whiskers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re my own,&rdquo; Madam Hare  replied indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me and no back-chat,&rdquo;  Splodge scowled at the culprit.</p>
<p>Needless to say a commotion arose  amongst the other animals. A chorus of whispering broke out with many audible  remarks such as; &ldquo;What did I tell you!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Fancy <i>her</i> with dyed whiskers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her here!&rdquo; Blinky demanded  growling very loudly. </p>
<p>Madam Hare tossed her ears up and  didn&rsquo;t look a bit ashamed or sorry as she marched up to Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that on your whiskers?&rdquo; he  asked gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natural,&rdquo; Madam Hare boldly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on her!&rdquo; Wally Wombat  called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s telling a lie!&rdquo; the black  rabbit shouted. &ldquo;I saw her do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Blinky asked sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her rubbing burnt black  cinders from a tree on them,&rdquo; the black rabbit replied, while a shout of &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  went up from the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Spicable animal,&rdquo; Blinky said  crossly. &ldquo;Wipe it off.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page093.jpg" alt="wipe" width="583" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Madam Hare gave a scream of rage  as she flew at Blinky, administering a nasty kick with her strong hindleg, then  tore for her life away into the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disqualified!&rdquo; Splodge shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got snakes!&rdquo; Blinky growled  as he proceeded to continue judging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whiskers next!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>One could almost hear the whiskers  frisking as they twitched in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bush Rat&rsquo;s whiskers are the  best!&rdquo; The decision was received well, as no doubt Mrs. Bush Rat had a lovely  shiny set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my work for nothing,&rdquo; the  black rabbit said to himself. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve still got the tails to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t noticed <i>us</i> yet,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  remarked a trifle discontentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for noses!&rdquo; Blinky called.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Some of the competitors even sniffed to  attract attention, and Wally Wombat gave a loud sneeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that!&rdquo; Splodge shouted  sternly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s appearance that counts&mdash;not noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same Wally Wombat&rsquo;s got  the bestest nose,&rdquo; Blinky called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far the bestest smeller in the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-o!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally threw himself in the air  with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridickilus!&rdquo; the black rabbit  exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all fat and lumpy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Splodge rapped his tail  on the ground to restore order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tails next!&rdquo; Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>Around all the competitors swung.  Little tails and big tails swished about for judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black rabbit&rsquo;s is a fake,&rdquo;  someone called out. The black rabbit immediately swung round so that his tail  was hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand out!&rdquo; Blinky ordered. &ldquo;Go  and &rsquo;spect it, Splodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s all this about? Where  did you get hold of that rubbish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge pointed to a funny looking  bunch of grey hair tied with grass on to the black rabbit&rsquo;s tail, while the  poor bunny hung his head in shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain it!&rdquo; Splodge thundered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;saw it going to waste, so I  thought I&rsquo;d use it,&rdquo; he whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo; Splodge demanded  angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Madam Hare&rsquo;s moults,&rdquo; the  black rabbit whispered. &ldquo;I hate to see good fur going to waste.&rdquo; He shivered  with fright as he looked up into Splodge&rsquo;s big brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better explain to the judge,&rdquo;  Splodge said feeling sorry for the wrongdoer.</p>
<p>So the black rabbit was marched up  to Blinky and explained his lapse of bad behaviour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Blinky remarked  shortly. &ldquo;That silly old hare shouldn&rsquo;t leave her moults about for people to  pick up. Serves her right for losing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I disqualified?&rdquo; the black  rabbit asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course not,&rdquo; Blinky remarked. &ldquo;But  Wally Wombat wins the tails too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got none! He&rsquo;s cheating!  He&rsquo;s got somebody else&rsquo;s!&rdquo; The cries of dissension were deafening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heck! So he has!&rdquo; Splodge  shouted.</p>
<p>Blinky stared hard at Wally&rsquo;s back  view and sure enough he had a long beautiful bushy tail, whisking it about in  quite an angry manner. Suddenly it disappeared and a very, very angry possum  dashed into the foreground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was sitting on me!&rdquo; the possum  panted angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Blinky asked, his  eyes opening wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sat on me so&rsquo;s my lovely tail  poked out,&rdquo; the possum explained indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that correct?&rdquo; Splodge  demanded of Wally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Spose so,&rdquo; he replied sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheater! Cheater!&rdquo; Poor Wally was  hissed on all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home&mdash;I&rsquo;m sick of it!&rdquo;  he cried defiantly. &ldquo;How can I win the tails when I haven&rsquo;t got one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;how can we?&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no tail prize,&rdquo; Blinky  said with emphasis. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too silly to win prizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw&mdash;that&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause <i>he</i> hasn&rsquo;t one,&rdquo;  the teenies growled amongst themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go home, Wally,&rdquo; Blinky  called out to his friend who was already ambling away. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll win if  you stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness&mdash;that&rsquo;s favouritism  for you!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty exclaimed angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala whispered. &ldquo;Remember  what I said about personality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s judging coats next!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted.</p>
<p>This seemed to soothe the animals,  and they forgot the past commotions in the general excitement of the present  event.</p>
<p>As they stood there on their  hindlegs with paws neatly crossed and heads erect, their glossy coats were  certainly a credit to the owners.</p>
<p>Brown, grey and black, all shone  in the moonlight with tiny toes and claws peeping from beneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Possum wins the coats and  the first prize for the small animals,&rdquo; Blinky announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; every one shouted, even Mrs.  Grunty and Wally Wombat, for really Mrs. Possum&rsquo;s coat was beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means the beauty contest has  to be decided between Angelina Wallaby, winner of the first part, and Mrs. Possum,&rdquo;  Splodge explained.</p>
<p>Now the real excitement began as  every one sat round on the ground waiting for the final decision.</p>
<p>Angelina and Mrs. Possum smiled at  one another, looking a tiny bit nervous as their particular friends called out  encouraging remarks to each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you win, Angelina!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, Mrs. Possum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And many more were added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;we&rsquo;re out of it; but all the  same I don&rsquo;t mind a scrap,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty remarked gaily, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause Angelina&rsquo;s  really a lovely lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala agreed.</p>
<p>Blinky now prepared to give his  final verdict. A hush fell over the whole bushland. Even the birds ceased  twittering, and the frogs behind stones stopped croaking; the insects were  silent, and the breeze died down. Everything and every one awaited the verdict.  Blinky placed his paws over his eyes and began to count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, <i>three!</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother wins the beauty contest  as she&rsquo;s the beautifullest animal in all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s silence followed Blinky&rsquo;s  decision and then the bushland went wild with joy. Birds sang as no human being  has ever heard them sing. Animals grunted with joy hopping over rocks and  mounds, clapping their paws together in excitement, while the frogs and insects  croaked and chirped their delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Gratulations!&rsquo;&rsquo; Mrs. Grunty  growled softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Blinky loves his mother so much. Strange that he  never shows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loves me deep down,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  answered, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s so furry his feelings just can&rsquo;t pop through and be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky was the centre of  attraction as he stood on the tree stump with every one applauding his  decision. And didn&rsquo;t he like it?&mdash;until a most unlooked-for incident upset  everything.</p>
<p>With a howl of surprise and temper  he swung round just in time to see Timothy Spider disappearing over the side of  the stump after having nipped him savagely on a hind foot.</p>
<p>Every one hunted for Timothy,  calling out loudly what they&rsquo;d do to him if they caught him. But Timothy had  scrambled under the bark of the stump, and as he listened to the animals&rsquo;  threats he repeated over and over again to himself: &lsquo;&ldquo;Serves him right! Serves  him right!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  A Famous Occasion</b></h2>
<p>THE time for Blinky&rsquo;s departure  was growing near. One more night in the bush and then away to join the soldiers  in Sydney. This last night was to be a famous occasion, one to be remembered  and spoken of for a long, long time to come amongst the bush folk.</p>
<p>The place chosen for the concert  was a small clearing made by a bush fire some years ago. The undergrowth had  sprung up again; but the big trees still valiantly fought for recognition. Many  huge boulders were dumped in the clearing, making excellent seats for the  smaller animals who were not tall enough to view the stage from the ground. All  these seats had been &ldquo;bagged&rdquo; with much arguing and in some cases, I am sorry  to say, a little bribery went on.</p>
<p>Croaky Frog for instance promised  Jumper Frog his largest fly if he&rsquo;d swap places with him; but Jumper was  cunning and asked for his fly in advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Gobble up my best and  biggest fly before I even get a look?&rdquo; Croaky squeaked with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing the asking&mdash;not me,&rdquo;  Jumper said rudely. &ldquo;And those are my terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Croaky looked very downcast for a  minute; then a brilliant idea entered his froggy mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you have the wings and  legs until the first part of the concert is over, and then when the second part  starts you can have the head; but you&rsquo;re not getting the body part till the  concert is ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jumper did not wish to miss such a  fine supper, so agreed to give his seat up on these terms. That is why Croaky  had such a fine view of the performance, and he didn&rsquo;t pay up until forced. His  first installment was paid one leg at a time after each item, much to Jumper&rsquo;s  disgust. And Jumper kept count of the legs too. As each one was handed to him  he made a note of it by placing a blade of grass on the stone.</p>
<p>Five blades of grass lay side by  side, and when the sixth item was over, Croaky handed his friend a wing. &ldquo;&rsquo;Nother  leg please,&rdquo; Jumper said coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no more,&rdquo; Croaky  replied sulkily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse me, I&rsquo;ve had only five,&rdquo;  Jumper contradicted, &ldquo;Hand over the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had only five,&rdquo; Croaky  replied, swiftly swallowing something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flies have six legs and I want  the other,&rdquo; Jumper said doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a cripple and had only  five,&rdquo; Croaky returned, not moving an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well hop down while I have a look  at the concert for the sixth leg,&rdquo; Jumper demanded angrily. </p>
<p>So Croaky had to give way for one  item; and as he hopped down breathed heavily all over Jumper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smells &rsquo;strordinary like flies&rsquo;  legs,&rdquo; Jumper remarked as he gave Croaky a push and flopped on to the rock.</p>
<p>That was only <i>one</i> instance of bribery and a very blatant case it was too.</p>
<p>Farther round the clearing another  shameful performance was taking place in regard to seats.</p>
<p>Porky, the largest porcupine in  the bush, was arguing with Miss Jerboa Rat (a pretty little creature) about her  possie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;I want that place,&rdquo; Porky  assumed a bullying manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it first. It&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; Miss  Jerboa Rat answered angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the price of it?&rdquo; Porky  asked, getting closer to the little rat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for sale,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;if you won&rsquo;t make a deal  with me&mdash;take the consequences,&rdquo; Porky said rudely.</p>
<p>And then, just as the concert was  about to start and Miss Jerboa Rat was comfortably settled with a splendid view  of the stage, and seated next to her best friend the field-mouse, a shadowy  form edged in between them very quietly. Intent on watching the stage, neither  took much notice until Miss Jerboa Rat felt a sharp prick in her side.</p>
<p>Jumping up in alarm, she was  nearly beside herself with rage to find Porky quickly snapping up her seat and  then&mdash;out came all his spines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll report you to the manager,&rdquo;  Miss Jerboa Rat cried as she raced away to lay her complaint. In a few minutes  Blinky was on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of it. Porky. That&rsquo;s not  your seat.&rdquo; Blinky had a big stick between his paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine till I&rsquo;m shifted,&rdquo;  Porky replied spreading his spines out to their fullest.</p>
<p>Without another word Blinky pushed  his stick under Porky&rsquo;s tummy and threw him into the air.</p>
<p>With squeaks and screams the audience  scattered in all directions, not knowing where the ball of prickles would land.</p>
<p>He landed right in Mrs. Grunty&rsquo;s  lap.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page103.jpg" alt="lap" width="612" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Snake&rsquo;s teeth!&rdquo; she cried in a  frightful temper. Then, wriggling herself free of the unwelcome intruder,  turned to grab a big stone. Porky lost no time burrowing under a thick spiky  bush. By the time Mrs. Grunty was ready to fight he&rsquo;d disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>Then every one had to wriggle down  again and get their special places sorted out once more.</p>
<p>While this interruption had been  ably settled, Splodge was busy restoring order still farther round the  clearing. Sad to say, old Father Wombat was the disturber. Wally had carefully  chosen a special rock all for himself, earlier in the day; but when old Father  Wombat saw it, he was clearly dissatisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put me amongst the people  who don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I sit with the wallabies and  kangaroos?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the lizards are the very best  people,&rdquo; Wally said, trying to overcome the difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunkum!&rdquo; old Father Wombat growled  irritably. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an animal and I&rsquo;m going to sit with the  animals&mdash; not with the reptiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, grab your own possie,&rdquo;  Wally replied impatiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking part in the concert and I can&rsquo;t waste  time looking for another place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Father Wombat was <i>very</i> angry.  He rumbled all over with deep guttural growls while lolloping around the rocks  looking for a good place to sit.</p>
<p>As he drew near to a group of  wallabies, they deliberately spread their haunches out, closing up the smallest  space, eyeing old Father Wombat with I-hope-he-doesn&rsquo;t-push-in-here looks. As  he moved away, the wallabies made more space again. Out of the corner of his  eye old Father Wombat noticed these things, and decided he&rsquo;d push that wallaby  crowd out before the concert started. He&rsquo;d brought his supper with him as luck  would have it, thinking he&rsquo;d have a nice quiet spot to himself where he could  munch and look on at the proceedings at the same time.</p>
<p>Waddling around he spotted three  wallabies with a fallen log all to themselves. There was ample room for old  Father Wombat up there too; but, as usual, they began to spread out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any room?&rdquo; he asked with a surly  growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;we&rsquo;re sorry, Father Wombat;  but we&rsquo;re crowded out as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move up! I&rsquo;ll just rest my old  paws over the log.&rdquo; His words sounded very much like a command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re crammed already,&rdquo; a  wallaby started to complain. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Move up!&rdquo; he repeated, taking no  notice of the complaint.</p>
<p>Pushing his front paws in between  two widely spread haunches, he then squeezed his old rough head in and began to  push sideways. Growls and angry exclamations were hurled at him; but he took no  notice, pushing and wedging until he got one hindleg up. It was only a matter  of minutes before the other hindleg was up too.</p>
<p>A great deal of pushing and  squeezing began; but old Father Wombat dug his long powerful claws into the log  and refused to budge an inch. The rudest remarks were loudly spoken as one  wallaby reached right across the front of old Father Wombat and remarked to her  friend: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time since some people had a bath,&rdquo; Old Father Wombat took  no notice whatever. He&rsquo;d got where he wanted and was determined to stay there.</p>
<p>Scrabbling about in the pockets of  his old coat he pulled out a large brown onion and began to eat it. This was the  supper he&rsquo;d so carefully carried along.</p>
<p>As he ate, the wallabies began to  look at one another with disgusted looks. They moved farther away, crowding up  to each end of the log. Old Father Wombat spat out the skin and that was the  sign for general action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgusting behaviour!&rdquo; one lovely  looking little wallaby announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old pig!&rdquo; another exclaimed  angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noxious weed!&rdquo; a third remarked  loudly. He&rsquo;d often listened to the farmers discussing blackberries and knew  from the way they spoke, a noxious weed was just about the most hated thing in  the bush or farmlands.</p>
<p>With four disgusted kicks at the  log, four disgusted wallabies hopped swiftly away to look for other seats,  leaving old Father Wombat in sole charge of the log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, huh!&rdquo; he grunted with satisfaction.  &ldquo;A fellow&rsquo;s only to use tacks and he gets anything he wants. This onion&rsquo;s the  worsted taste I&rsquo;ve <i>ever</i> tasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a disgusted growl he threw  his supper away then settled down to enjoy the concert, wiping his whiskers  with his paws and trying to get the horrible taste from his mouth.</p>
<p>Whack! Whack! Whack! Splodge  brought a big stick down on the ground calling every one to attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Animals and birds, reptiles and  insects. This is a farewell concert to Blinky Bill. He leaves to-morrow night  to join the soldiers, so this is the last time you&rsquo;ll see him or hear him for a  very long time,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo; Every one expressed his  sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a word,&rdquo; Splodge added, &ldquo;We  want this concert to be a success. Don&rsquo;t growl and kick up a noise if you don&rsquo;t  like an item. It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with you. If you like the concert shout  and clap as much as you like&mdash;but no throwing stones and sticks about, and no  biting and kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hand clapping of paws and thumps  of tails greeted this announcement.</p>
<p>The stage was a large bare patch  of ground and as the first item was about to start, two kangaroos rolled a log  into the middle of it.</p>
<p>Blinky, Mrs. Koala, and Nutsy had  been given seats of honour, right in the very front row of stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first item will be acrobats,&rdquo;  Splodge called out. &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;the Springing Spinsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  The Farewell Concert<br>
  Part 1</b></h2>
<p>WHAT&rsquo;S spinsters?&rdquo; Blinky asked  his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies without husbands,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a springing spinster?&rdquo;  Blinky spoke very loudly and several nearby animals looked quite shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said  shortly. &ldquo;Be quiet and watch the concert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t a husband,&rdquo;  Blinky persisted. &ldquo;You <i>must</i> be a springing spinster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Will</i> you be quiet?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  gave him a pinch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hurts!&rdquo; Blinky cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good job!&rdquo; Nutsy piped up.</p>
<p>Fortunately at that moment the  Springing Spinsters appeared on the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! they&rsquo;re only possums,&rdquo;  Blinky remarked with disappointment. But the next instant he was cracking with  laughter.</p>
<p>The two possums somersaulted over  the log then sprang in the air meeting with a bang. Down they came leap-frogging  over each other, grabbing tails and springing over and over the log.</p>
<p>This performance was repeated  again and again while the audience clapped and stamped with joy. Then, with a  polite bow and kissing their paws to their friends the possums scrambled off  the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next item will be a song by  Madam Hare,&rdquo; Splodge announced.</p>
<p>The best animals clapped; but  somewhere away back in the bush a noise of booing was distinctly heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious goodness!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala exclaimed.  &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know she could sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madam Hare swept on to the stage  rolling her eyes around in a vain manner, and arching her whiskers.</p>
<p>Every one clapped to give her  encouragement. She held a flannel flower between her front paws and with this  waved to the audience for silence as her accompanist made his appearance.</p>
<p>It was Green Grocer Locust. She  had tried very hard to enlist the services of the Black Prince, but he  declined, explaining that his services were only available for Royalty.</p>
<p>Green Grocer Locust tuned up his  drums, then struck the opening notes of the song &ldquo;Nellie Bly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frogs immediately showed their  approval of this number by croaking loudly and Madam Hare had to wait until the  din subsided before commencing her song.</p>
<p class="note">Nellie Bly<br>
  Caught a fly<br>
Hung it up to dry. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A waste!&mdash;they&rsquo;re no good dried,&rdquo;  a frog croaked above Madam Hare&rsquo;s beautiful notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bag him!&rdquo; someone shouted. A  scuffle took place and once more Madam Hare began her song.</p>
<p class="note">Took it down<br>
  Cut it up<br>
Made a mutton pie.</p>
<p>A deafening applause followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Encore! More! More!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking Green Grocer Locust by a  leg Madam Hare drew him to the front of the stage, both bowing and smiling  their acknowledgments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More! More!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whispering something to Green  Grocer Locust, Madam Hare then told the audience she would sing &ldquo;The  Grasshopper&rsquo;s Lullaby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sang the song with great  feeling, flopping her ears about, closing her eyes, and rocking her paws.</p>
<p class="note">The Grasshopper sang,<br>
  The baby cried<br>
  A witch flew down<br>
The Grasshopper sighed.</p>
<p>Here Green Grocer Locust made a  long drawn out noise on his drums.</p>
<p class="note">The Grasshopper sang<br>
  The baby howled,<br>
  &ldquo;Smack him on the pants&rdquo;<br>
The old witch growled.</p>
<p>The audience went wild, clapping  and grunting, shouting and whistling, pushing and shoving as excited onlookers  fell off their seats and scrambled back madly before the seats were pinched.</p>
<p>Repeated calls for more were in  vain. Madam Hare was presented with a bouquet of wild flowers and immediately  began to nibble the stalks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s good at all,&rdquo;  Blinky said rudely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shows her teeth too much when  singing,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala remarked to a neighbour. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, &rsquo;cause I couldn&rsquo;t  help looking at them instead of listening to the song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her hare-lip&mdash;she can&rsquo;t  help it,&rdquo; her friend answered in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t mean to be personal,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala returned. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t tell her what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course not! I <i>never</i> repeat  things,&rdquo; her neighbour answered, &ldquo;unless they come out by accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ping!</p>
<p>A pebble shot through the air and  hit Madam Hare right on the tail, just as she&rsquo;d turned to make her exit.</p>
<p>She leaped into the air more from  surprise than pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind the step!&rdquo; some rude animal  called out. It sounded very much like Fatty Kangaroo&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an insult!&rdquo; Madam Hare  shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t sing six songs as I intended to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I!&rdquo; Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh! Ssh!&rdquo; Every one &ldquo;sshed.&rdquo;  Madam Hare held her head very high and made her interrupted exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky! Give me that catapult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s voice was cold and  stern as she grasped her son&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she shouldn&rsquo;t have showed off,&rdquo;  Blinky began to argue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Give me that catapult!</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Koala insisted, tightening her grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my very best one,&rdquo; Blinky  began again, &ldquo;and I mightn&rsquo;t get another now I&rsquo;m going to be a soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;very well. But this is your <i>last</i> chance. Don&rsquo;t let me see you do  that again.&rdquo; Mrs. Koala gave a deep sigh and turned to watch the stage.</p>
<p>Splodge bounded forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, the next  item on the programme is Wo-Wo the Magician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah!&rdquo; the bush folk  shouted, throwing sticks and clumps of grass into the air. In fact the whole  audience went wild with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rsquo;&rsquo; Blinky shouted as he  danced round on his rock. &ldquo;A magician!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he turn us into snakes?&rdquo;  Nutsy asked with alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Snakes and goannas and  centipedes,&rdquo; Blinky replied, still dancing around, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only to say &lsquo;Boof&rsquo; and  you&rsquo;d be a dingo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridickilus nonsense!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  retorted sternly.</p>
<p>There was no time for argument as  the magician made his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! it&rsquo;s Wally,&rdquo; Blinky yelled  with glee. &ldquo;Wallo &mdash;I&rsquo;m here, right in the front row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wally! Old Wally! Good old Wally!&rdquo;  the shouts and cries mingled with calls and grunts. The birds twittered with  joy and Mrs. Kookaburra laughed until she fell from her branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brainless yam!&rdquo; old Father  Wombat growled as he saw his son advance on to the stage. &ldquo;That wireless  business accounts for this! Cat&rsquo;s whiskers and wire all over the place&mdash;no  wonder his brain&rsquo;s gone bad. I never saw the like of the like before! Tinkering  about with air and noises instead of rooting up potatoes and carrots. <i>That&rsquo;s</i>  why Farmer Green had a good crop, as he says to his neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally started his performance, &ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse  me&mdash;but I want a gentleman from the audience to step on to the stage please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me! Me!&rdquo; With a whoop of glee Blinky bounced off his rock and stood  beside Wally before he&rsquo;d finished his request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he <i>bold?</i>&rdquo; Nutsy whispered  to Mrs. Koala, her eyes nearly popping out of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pushing!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala retorted. &ldquo;Goodness  knows where he gets it from. Certainly not from me and not from his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have just growed on him like  his ears,&rdquo; Nutsy remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something he&rsquo;s picked up,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; Wally  began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to produce something out of nuffing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-o-h!&rdquo; a long expectant sigh  broke from the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to touch a thing,&rdquo;  Wally proceeded. &ldquo;This gentleman beside me can prove that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; Blinky whispered.</p>
<p>Bending over a stone Wally uttered  some magic words as he waved his paws to and fro. Then pausing a moment,  turning his paws this way and that to show the audience he had nothing in them,  he bent down and lifted the stone.</p>
<p>With a shout of surprise he held  up a tiny kicking field-mouse by the tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly&mdash;!&rdquo; Blinky said quietly, as  he gazed in amazement at the squirming mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot o&rsquo; mud larks,&rdquo; old Father  Wombat growled, secretly feeling very proud of his son. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him to fetch  out some peanuts from under the stones in our burrow. Here have I been grubbing  for years&mdash;and all the time I needn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nuffing,&rdquo; Wally remarked a  little shyly when the sustained applause died down. &ldquo;I can make things come out  of the earth what never went into the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show us! Show us!&rdquo; every one  shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, this great  magic needs time to work. It has to go right under the ground and mix up with  witches and turnips before the magic begins to work. I must ask you to keep  very quiet while the mixing is going on.&rdquo; Splodge bowed and a hush fell over  the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witches!&rdquo; Nutsy whispered to Mrs.  Koala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! and there&rsquo;s young Blinky  standing right on top of them. <i>Blinky!</i> Come here at once!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala stood up  as she shouted and waved to her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, please!&rdquo; Wally  ordered as he scowled at Mrs. Koala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Blinky&rsquo;s right on top of the  witches,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala shouted back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nuffing,&rdquo; Wally replied.  So poor Mrs. Koala had to sit down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand out here please, where the  magic is working,&rdquo; Wally motioned Blinky to a loose mound of earth. &ldquo;Stand  right on top of it, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very reluctantly Blinky moved to  where he was directed, casting a doubtful look at his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back before you&rsquo;re blown up!&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala called as she began to climb down off her rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo; Wally  said very sternly. &ldquo;Keep back, please. Women spoil magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala hesitated, then Splodge  came to assure her that everything would be perfectly safe as long as she kept  quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-um-um,&rdquo; Wally growled as he  waved his paws over Blinky&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Slowly but very clearly the earth  round Blinky&rsquo;s feet began to heave and he began to run away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t move, or goodness  knows what&rsquo;ll happen,&rdquo; Wally shouted. &ldquo;The witches&rsquo;ll all bounce out if you  move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It all happened in a second. Wally  gave a sharp shout &mdash;Blinky fell backwards on to the stage, the earth flew up in  all directions and out of the hole stepped the big black rabbit, rubbing his  eyes and shaking the dust from his body and ears.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page115.jpg" alt="second" width="627" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Yells and screams of astonishment  and delight deafened Wally&rsquo;s words as he tried to speak. Wave after wave of  clapping added to the din. Blinky picked himself up looking more astonished  than any one, and the big black rabbit waved his paw to the audience, then  disappeared. Blinky cautiously took a look into the hole, surprised more than  ever to find it was so shallow, while Wally nearly broke in half through bowing  so low and often to the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More! More!&rdquo; came the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it again, Wally!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally shook his head. &ldquo;The witches  won&rsquo;t do it twice,&rdquo; he announced seriously. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll show you something now  that the fairies can do with the help of my magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky had had enough of magic and  sneaked off the stage back to his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the magic burn?&rdquo; Nutsy asked  in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it got terribly awfully hot.  That&rsquo;s why I fell over,&rdquo; Blinky answered bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky to be alive,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  remarked. &ldquo;Witches are bad dreadful things&mdash;all covered with flames and long  teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I saw one&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I  fell over,&rdquo; Blinky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; His mother turned  quite pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ladies and gentlemen, this is  a magic turn that needs special magic,&rdquo; Wally started to explain, &ldquo;and I need a  lady from the audience to help me. Please step this way, lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no lady made a move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be frightened  about,&rdquo; Wally explained. &ldquo;No witches&mdash;only fairies. How about you, Nutsy?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No!</i> Certainly not!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied immediately. &ldquo;One child&rsquo;s been nearly killed already,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no lady came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;there&rsquo;s no more magic,&rdquo;  Wally announced peevishly, and started to walk off the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; a voice piped up. And  who should it be but Mrs. Grunty!</p>
<p>Of course another burst of  clapping broke out as Mrs. Grunty waddled towards the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be killed for sure&mdash;and  who&rsquo;s to take care of Snubby then?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said with alarm.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grunty reached the stage  blushing and folding and unfolding her paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step this way, madam,&rdquo; Wally  ordered politely, as he placed Mrs. Grunty right in the centre of the stage. &ldquo;Now  just a moment while I get my magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lolloped off the stage and  returned carrying a big orange-coloured pumpkin between his front paws.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grunty eyed it nervously.</p>
<p>The pumpkin was tied round with  long reeds, crisscrossed all over its surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an explosion!&rdquo; Blinky called  out, terrifying poor Mrs. Grunty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Wally said crossly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a fairy&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; old Father Wombat shouted  from his log in the back row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more disgustin&rsquo; remarks and I&rsquo;ll  stop the magic,&rdquo; Wally shouted back, not realizing his father was the cause of  the interruption.</p>
<p>Old Father Wombat growled deeply,  muttering away to himself all about magic and rats; but he decided to keep  quiet as he was really enjoying the magician&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll see the magic work,&rdquo;  Wally announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please walk round the pumpkin  three times, Mrs. Grunty, and say over and over again, &lsquo;Pumpkin and fairies  make magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemnly Mrs. Grunty did as she  was told, then awaited the result.</p>
<p>Wally bent his ear to the pumpkin,  then shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t ready,&rdquo; he remarked  solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-um-um.&rdquo; Waving his paws over  the pumpkin he then stepped back a pace or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undo the strings,&rdquo; he said to Mrs.  Grunty. But she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll mix all the magic up if  you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Wally remarked crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Blinky rushed on to the  stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t the right thing to do,&rdquo;  Wally growled; &ldquo;but in the circumstances, I s&rsquo;pose it will work. I&rsquo;ll have to  magic again as the other is wasted now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, saying his magic words over  again, &ldquo;Um-um-um&mdash;,&rdquo; and waving his paws over the pumpkin, he ordered Blinky to  untie the strings.</p>
<p>Grabbing the reeds in his paws, he  bit the knots through with his teeth as Wally&rsquo;s warning shout of &ldquo;Stand back&rdquo;  rang through the air.</p>
<p>Blinky bounded away in fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay there! Stay there! The magic  and fairies have gone,&rdquo; Wally called out reassuringly, as he advanced towards  the pumpkin. Carefully placing his paws over the top half he lifted it&mdash;and lo  and behold, six beautiful little blue wrens flew into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;&mdash;Blinky and the audience  gasped with joy and surprise. Then the clapping and shouting started all over  again.</p>
<p>It was a great show. And when  Wally finally walked off the stage with a large turnip, given him by an  admirer, held between his paws, every one declared &ldquo;Wally was terribly clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the magician&rsquo;s act the  orchestra performed. In it Double Drummers, Green Grocers, Yellow Mondays,  crickets, bees, and every bird in bushland was represented. Then little Tommy  Bandicoot gave a recitation all about a garden and how delicious everything in  that garden tasted. He was very shy and nervous, breaking down and forgetting  his lines until someone in the audience prompted him.</p>
<p>Then came the interval. The  gentlemen strolled about discussing the weather and hunting, while the ladies  remained seated talking about the new babies and the ailments of their  children&mdash;sometimes discussing their neighbours too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Farewell Concert<br>
  Part 2</b></h2>
<p>PART two of the concert began with  a thrilling event. Fatty Kangaroo was in a boxing contest with Rusty Kangaroo.  There were no gloves or rounds in this match&mdash;just a straight-out boxing match  with feet and tails taking a prominent part. Fatty was the first to appear on  the stage. Splodge, who was acting as umpire, rushed over to him and began  fanning him with a branch of gum leaves. Jeers and shouts came from the  audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him time to warm up!&rdquo; old  Father Wombat yelled scornfully. &ldquo;Is this a cissies&rsquo; fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone gave old Father Wombat a  crack on the head for trying to start a disturbance. After that he was quiet  for a time.</p>
<p>Rusty Kangaroo made his debut with  a tremendous bound, landing a few feet away from Fatty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; Splodge shouted, and  at once the match began.</p>
<p>Fatty sparred up to Rusty,  whispering under his breath, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need a set of false teeth when I&rsquo;ve done  with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rusty gave Fatty a nasty smack  across the nose for this remark and added, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need a new face when I&rsquo;ve  finished with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge, overhearing these  remarks, became alarmed, as this was not to be a free fight.</p>
<p>Swishing his gum branch in the two  boxers&rsquo; faces, he spoke hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot to tell you to shake  paws before you began &mdash;that&rsquo;s to show you&rsquo;re friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re <i>not!</i>&rdquo; Fatty exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter. It has to be done  for the look of things,&rdquo; Splodge replied sternly.</p>
<p>Holding up an arm to silence the  audience who also wished to take part in the discussion, he ordered the  contestants to shake.</p>
<p>Sulkily both shook paws, glaring  at one another like two tom-cats.</p>
<p>Cheers came from the onlookers and  the boxers bowed. Then&mdash;like a flash of lightning Fatty, taking his opponent  unawares while he was still bowing, gave him a terrific kick on the  hindquarters sending him sprawling to the other side of the stage.</p>
<p>Yells and shouts greeted this neat  bit of work. Animals jumped up, blocking the view of smaller ones behind, and  cries of &lsquo;&lsquo;Sit down!&rdquo; came from everywhere.</p>
<p>Rusty quickly recovered from this  onslaught. But I&rsquo;m sorry to say his temper recovered too. With a spring through  the air he landed on top of Fatty, and Splodge, who had been busy with his fan  again, crashed to the ground under both boxers. Nothing could be seen but legs  and tails kicking and lashing, thumping and banging in all directions. Dust and  gum leaves, fur and stones flew in a shower all over the stage. Ladies in the  audience screamed while the gentlemen clapped and shouted encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put in the feet!&rdquo; old Father  Wombat yelled, beating the log with his paws in excitement. He got a dig in the  back for this remark from a wallaby with long toenails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, you old interferer,  This is a perfessionals&rsquo; fight not a rabbits&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep your kickers out of my back  and mind your business,&rdquo; old Father Wombat retorted savagely.</p>
<p>The muddle on the stage began to  separate, as Splodge wriggled out of the line of battle&mdash;but only for a few  seconds, as Fatty let out another tremendous kick sending Rusty head-over-heels  down the stage again.</p>
<p>Splodge rushed in holding up a paw  to let every one know that part of the match was won by Fatty. Out came his  branch again. He fanned Fatty madly then dashed down to Rusty repeating the  operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good on you, Fatty!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted, clapping his paws and jumping up and down.</p>
<p>Fatty acknowledged Blinky&rsquo;s remark  with a tilt of a paw to his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and still your tongue,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala commanded, &ldquo;Next thing you&rsquo;ll be mixed up in the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge gave the signal and the  contest was on again.</p>
<p>The two boxers met with a loud  bang as they each bounded for one another. Locked together, they rocked and  clawed, grunted, and smacked wildly about with their tails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bite him! Bite him, Fatty!&rdquo;  Blinky yelled at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>This was too much for Mrs. Koala.  Springing at her son, she placed her paws on his shoulders and forced him down  on to the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Will</i> you sit down?&rdquo; she growled savagely. &ldquo;Making exhibitions of  yourself all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky looked at his mother from  the corner of his eye, scowling sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old ratty!&rdquo; he mumbled quietly to  himself. Then forgot the incident immediately as roars of protest from the  audience drew his attention to the stage.</p>
<p>Rusty had Fatty down on the ground  punching his tummy for all he was worth. Fatty seemed winded as he coughed and  spluttered for breath, flinging his arms about helplessly in the air.</p>
<p>Splodge dashed in, and at the same  moment a little furry shape scrambled across the stage and stamped with all his  might on Rusty&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness! Look at Blinky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala was off her rock  quicker than it takes me to tell you. Nutsy sat with eyes like saucers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i> he&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo; She held her breath, clasping her paws in a  tight grip. Mrs. Koala waddled straight up on to the stage, grabbing part of  Splodge&rsquo;s fan as she went to the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep out of it! Stand back!&rdquo;  Splodge shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the umpire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>I&rsquo;m</i> the rump-pire!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said angrily as she gave Blinky a  whack where his tail should have been.</p>
<p>The general commotion that  followed drowned all orders from Splodge. The audience danced and shouted and  stamped with excitement. Things began to fly through the air. Sticks, bits of  suppers, clumps of earth, and even a bird&rsquo;s nest. Grabbing Blinky by the ear, Mrs.  Koala managed to pull him back to her stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgusting behaviour,&rdquo; she  panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a fight,&rdquo; Blinky  whimpered. &ldquo;And I was just getting ready to bite when you spoilt it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Splodge had given  Rusty a kick that winded <i>him</i> for a  minute and Fatty was able to rise on his legs.</p>
<p>Splodge declared Fatty the winner  because Rusty had used unfair tactics. Cheers for Fatty came from every one  except Mrs. Koala.</p>
<p>Rusty refused to shake paws with  Fatty, and sent a shower of dust over him and Splodge as he departed from the  stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a cissies&rsquo; fight!&rdquo; old  Father Wombat growled disgustedly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no blood&mdash;no nuffing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took some time for the audience  to settle down. Fortunately the next item restored them to peace and order.</p>
<p>Splodge, with an eye that looked swollen,  introduced Mr. Double Drummer, the bass singer, and Miss Nibble Mouse, the  soprano, to the bush folk. They were to sing a duet. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate sings,&rdquo; Blinky growled, &ldquo;specially  lady songers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala said nothing. She was  still feeling too ruffled to say anything.</p>
<p>Nutsy cuddled up to her and patted  her paws gently. Mr. Double Drummer cleared his throat, placed a leg over his  heart and began to sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrum, thrum, thrum.&rdquo; Then his  notes came in a deep mellow tone.</p>
<p>Miss Nibble Mouse twitched her  whiskers nervously as she waited to sing her notes. Her voice was clear and  piping. The song had been composed (and written) especially for this occasion  by Professor Owl. So that the bush folk could follow the words of the song,  he&rsquo;d kindly written out a dozen copies on paper-bark, and these were passed  around the audience as the duet began.</p>
<p>Double Drummer:</p>
<p class="note">Please will you marry me beautiful  mouse?</p>
<p>Mouse:</p>
<p class="note">Yes&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll buy me a marble  house.<br>
  A marble house with a jewelled bath,<br>
And a garden of flowers with a mossy path.</p>
<p>Double Drummer:</p>
<p class="note">I&rsquo;ll buy you a house in a gum-tree  high,<br>
  For marble walls you&rsquo;ll have the sky,<br>
  For a glittering bath, the rain and dew,<br>
The garden of Rowers will be pretty you.</p>
<p>Mouse:</p>
<p class="note">It seems very grand to a mouse  like me,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll patch your wings and hunt your tea,<br>
But the moment you scold, I&rsquo;ll leave your house.</p>
<p>Double Drummer:</p>
<p class="note">I&rsquo;ll never do that! My beautiful  mouse.</p>
<p>Cheers and cheers greeted this  number. Then a tiny field-mouse stepped forward from the audience and handed  Miss Nibble Mouse two ears of wheat. No persuasion would entice the singers to  perform again.</p>
<p>So Splodge was forced to announce  the next number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classical number,&rdquo; he  remarked. &ldquo;Much work and brains have been required to produce it, and I want  every one to behave while the dancers perform. Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;the Green  Balley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cricket orchestra and the  finch quartette struck the first notes of the dance. From out of the grass  fringing the back of the stage twelve lovely green praying mantises sprang to  the foreground. &ldquo;Click&mdash;click&rdquo; and off they started. Delicate green legs danced  in formation, twirling and stepping with dainty actions. The high kicking was  wonderful; also the scissors step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you round the back of  the stage,&rdquo; Croaky Frog shouted, his eyes bulging with excitement, as he  thought of the delicious supper he&rsquo;d have without hunting for it.</p>
<p>The ballet became panic-stricken  and tore for the exit, in spite of Splodge&rsquo;s assurance that he&rsquo;d deal with Croaky.  Nothing would bring them back&mdash;in fact they just vanished into the unknown.</p>
<p>You may imagine how popular Croaky  was after this piece of unforgivable behaviour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put him out! Put him out!&rdquo; The  bush folk began to hunt for the offender. But Croaky, being a pretty wise  gentleman, put himself out before he was assisted.</p>
<p>The final item on the programme  was now to take place. It had been kept a great secret. Only the management  knew what it was to be. Blinky had not been told, as after a discussion it was  considered better to keep him out of the secret, seeing the concert was for  him, and surprises were one of the things he loved. So the audience sat  expectantly waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as it&rsquo;s not snakes,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mrs.  Koala remarked.</p>
<p>Splodge appeared again announcing  the final item:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, this is the  most marvellous performance you&rsquo;re now about to see. It has never appeared in  the bush before&mdash;and as far as I know never will again. It&rsquo;s all specially for  Blinky. You will see in a few minutes the marvellous creature himself. His name  is Know-all and he&rsquo;ll tell you anything you want to know from how many babies a  worm has, to what&rsquo;s in a yabbie&rsquo;s mind. Excuse me&mdash;I must see if he&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Such a big exclamation went  up from the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous nonsense!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  grunted, &ldquo;All a yabbie&rsquo;s got in his head is <i>mud!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And big nippers,&rdquo; Blinky joined  in.</p>
<p>A burst of clapping and calls  broke out, as a queer-looking creature hopped on to the stage. He wore an old  felt hat, had a pipe in his mouth, sprouted straw whiskers all round his face  and had an extremely long nose and big brown eyes.</p>
<p>His legs were in old patched and  torn trousers, his coat dragged on the ground, and his feet were in a very  large pair of slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! It&rsquo;s only Farmer Green&rsquo;s  scarecrow!&rdquo; Blinky said with disappointment in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw!&rdquo; Loud shouts and rude  remarks were flung at Know-all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if we&rsquo;re scared of you! I gave  you a kick on the tail only last night,&rdquo; the big black rabbit shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we sit in his whiskers,&rdquo;  several birds called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve pulled his nose!&rdquo; Blinky cried  as loudly as he could. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s got no teeth&mdash;I had a look&mdash;his mouth&rsquo;s always  full of straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he can&rsquo;t talk&mdash;can&rsquo;t say  nuffing,&rdquo; old Father Wombat shouted. &ldquo;I rooted taters right out under his nose  and all he did was flap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me&mdash;you&rsquo;re all wrong,&rdquo;  Know-all remarked politely.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page129.jpg" alt="straw" width="593" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! He&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  exclaimed in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t <i>your</i> nose I pulled,&rdquo; Blinky shouted, &ldquo;Must have been somebody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! It wasn&rsquo;t my nose,&rdquo; Know-all  replied. &ldquo;Yours wouldn&rsquo;t be on your face to-night, you cub, if it had been  mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i> didn&rsquo;t dig taters under my feet, old Father Wombat. You&rsquo;re only  skiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start the show!&rdquo; someone called  out. &ldquo;We all know about old Father Wombat&mdash;he&rsquo;s dippy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;ladies and gentlemen&mdash;we mustn&rsquo;t  waste time. <i>My</i> time is valuable and  I&rsquo;m here only for this extra special occasion. Now I&rsquo;m going to tell you things  you&rsquo;ve never heard before. First of all&mdash;would you like to know what Farmer  Green&rsquo;s doing this very minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; came the response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s setting traps down in the  cabbage patch and what do you think he&rsquo;s going to catch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuffing!&rdquo; old Father Wombat  shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Know-all replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  going to catch the worst cold he&rsquo;s ever caught in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; The animals went wild  with delight. &ldquo;And when he catches that cold&mdash;I mean when he&rsquo;s all sick with  sneezes and coughs and Mrs. Green&rsquo;s running in and out pegging hankies on the  line&mdash;when you see her picking lemons off the tree-go into his garden and eat  and eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here&rsquo;s where I see things  with double eyes&mdash; here&rsquo;s where I say a word of warning &rsquo;cause my name&rsquo;s  Know-all. Some of you are going to have big up and down pains in your tummies,  and some big round and round pains. Those are the animals wot are greedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some of the birds too.  Cherries and apricots and peaches and tomatoes&mdash;they&rsquo;re all there waiting to be  etten right up; but the greedy birds will all huddle up with square pains with  corners on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hush fell over the audience.  Many animals and birds looked slyly at their neighbours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now would you like to know what  old Father Wombat&rsquo;s thinking about this very minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; came the shout. And before  old Father Wombat could utter a growl, Know-all started to speak: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  thinking this very minute that, as soon as the concert&rsquo;s over, he&rsquo;ll hurry down  to Farmer Green&rsquo;s vegetable garden and have a good gobble before the rest of  you get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a &rsquo;spicable nuffing!&rdquo; old  Father Wombat shouted in anger. &ldquo;Such fings never entered my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not speaking the truth,&rdquo;  Know-all replied, as the bush folk began to shout all sorts of unkind remarks. &ldquo;But  never mind&mdash;people who don&rsquo;t speak the truth are punished. And old Father Wombat&rsquo;s  going to get a dreadful surprise&mdash;a nasty surprise&mdash;in a minute if he doesn&rsquo;t get  off that log where he&rsquo;s sat all night by himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my log and I&rsquo;m staying here,&rdquo;  old Father Wombat shouted. &ldquo;If any one comes near me I&rsquo;ll kick him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;ll do a bit of  kicking in any case,&rdquo; Know-all remarked coolly. &ldquo;I can see with my double eyes  a great big black snake with red underneaths, coiled up in the middle of that  very log you&rsquo;re sitting on, and he&rsquo;s waking up now, yawning and sticking out  his poisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a yell old Father Wombat  sprang off the log, running as fast as his wobbly old legs would carry him. He  didn&rsquo;t stop running until he reached his home, a thoroughly frightened old  wombat.</p>
<p>This piece of news made every one  jittery. Birds and animals took nervous glances all around them, peeping in  cracks and under rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; Know-all  continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the biggest and fattest surprise of the evening for you.  My double eyes have just seen something not a soul knows about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us! Tell us!&rdquo; every one  shouted at once.</p>
<p>Know-all cleared his throat just  to emphasize his words and wisdom: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never believe me when I tell you.&rdquo;  he remarked, &ldquo;but you can have a look at it yourselves. <i>Mrs. Grunty&rsquo;s got a new baby in her pouch!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous nonsense!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  exclaimed. But her remark was drowned in the uproar.</p>
<p>Every one pushed and jostled their  way towards Mrs. Grunty&mdash;Blinky in the midst of it all. Snubby was dumbfounded.  But not Mrs. Grunty. She was a quivering mass of anger. Protesting loudly she  denied Know-all&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbishing nonsense!&rdquo; she cried  with indignation, while diving into her pouch.</p>
<p>She produced a large gum nut and  held it up for every one to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! it&rsquo;s only her chewing gum,&rdquo;  Blinky cried disgustedly, while all the animals muttered words of  disappointment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kookaburra sent a peal of  hilarious laughter ringing through the trees.</p>
<p>No one was more astonished and  crestfallen than Know-all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse me ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo;  he muttered in a nervous voice, &ldquo;my time is precious. I must be going.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a taker-down,&rdquo; the cry went  up. And to make matters worse, Know-all in his hurry to depart grabbed his coat  around his body, turned his back on the audience and began to hop off the  stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Splodge!&rdquo; every one shouted.</p>
<p>Ping! A pebble whacked Splodge in  the middle of his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut that out, Blinky!&rdquo; he shouted  as he turned for a moment to glare at his little friend.</p>
<p>Another pebble found its mark on  his whiskers. Just as Blinky was aiming for a third shot Mrs. Koala grabbed his  catapult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! a fellow can&rsquo;t have anything,&rdquo;  Blinky said disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it up,&rdquo; Nutsy advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw! I <i>hate</i> girls,&rdquo; Blinky cried  rudely.</p>
<p>The concert was over. Every one  began to make for home. Mrs. Koala stuffed the catapult in her pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along. It&rsquo;s time you were  both in bed. I&rsquo;ve got a headache,&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they padded their way through  the bush towards the old gum-tree, Splodge came hopping along behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that catapult, Blinky?&rdquo;  he demanded sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my pouch,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied,  &ldquo;and there it stays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind lending it to me  for to-night?&rdquo; Splodge asked. He seemed quite frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my bestest shooter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Grunty&rsquo;s as mad as mad,&rdquo;  Splodge explained, &ldquo;and she says she&rsquo;s coming around to have an understanding  with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;ll give you the  catapult,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala remarked, as she passed it over to Splodge.</p>
<p>Blinky was just about to cry out  in protest when he saw Splodge wink at him.</p>
<p>Later on when &ldquo;good nights&rdquo; had  been said and Mrs. Koala and Nutsy were half way up their old tree, Splodge  quickly handed the catapult to Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fanks, Splodge,&rdquo; Blinky said  quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In future, my lad, you keep your  shooting for enemies, <i>not</i> friends.  See you to-morrow night.&rdquo; Splodge rubbed his nose against his small friend&rsquo;s  and with a cheery call bounded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now get to bed quickly,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mrs. Koala  ordered. &ldquo;Blinky, I want you to sleep beside me to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I like the toppest branch,&rdquo;  Blinky retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come up there too,&rdquo; his  mother replied.</p>
<p>Three little bears were soon fast  asleep. The old tree nodded and rustled her leaves with contentment. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page134.jpg" alt="tail" width="315" height="241"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Blinky Becomes The Mascot</b></h2>
<p>ON the following night the moon  rose without a cloud in the sky. The leaves of the old gum-tree sparkled in its  beams as they rustled about more than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t forget to wash your  paws every night.&rdquo; Mrs. Koala was saying to Blinky, as she brushed his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And keep your claws clean,&rdquo; Nutsy  interjected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be quiet!&rdquo; Blinky said,  glaring at Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala sighed. &ldquo;Fancy  quarrelling right up to the last minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cough was heard. Mrs. Koala  leaned out over the branches to have a peep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Splodge,&rdquo; she said placing a  paw over her thumping heart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for Blinky to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to go,&rdquo; Nutsy  started to whimper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry-baby!&rdquo; Blinky said  scornfully. Then calling out to Splodge that he was coming, he started to climb  down the tree.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Nutsy climbed down  too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! Here we are,&rdquo; Splodge  exclaimed, &ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t we proud to have a soldier with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> take care of him, Splodge,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala begged, trying bravely to hide her tears. &ldquo;And tell the big man when  you see him to-night to bring him back soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will,&rdquo; Splodge replied  as Blinky climbed up on his back, after being hugged almost to death by his  mother. Nutsy went up to hug him too, but Blinky rushed over to Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! Fancy being hugged by a  girl,&rdquo; he said disgustedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather pull her ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final good-byes were said and  Splodge bounded away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Nutsy waved until  they turned the bend of the track and were out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very, very naughty,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  sighed as she placed her arm around Nutsy. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help loving him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Nutsy said sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Splodge hopped quickly along, as  he knew the big man with the shiny buttons on his tunic would be waiting  anxiously in the township. Little animals peeping from their homes waved their  paws in farewell, as Splodge and Blinky passed. Some threw tiny bunches of  wildflowers, and called out cheerful greetings and wishes for a speedy return.</p>
<p>Wally Wombat was waiting at a turn  down the track and as his friends came in sight, waved frantically to them to  stop.</p>
<p>Splodge pulled up with a jolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t spare more than a minute,  Wally,&rdquo; he explained, puffing and panting. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re late as it is.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you,&rdquo; Wally replied,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just brought a present for Blinky,&rdquo; Lifting a grubby paw he handed up to  Blinky the sweet potato which he had won at the gymkhana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; Wally started  to apologize, &ldquo;but I saved it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sweet potato had evidently  been sacrificed after much thought and nibbling, for all over it were small  teeth-marks and holes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, it&rsquo;s a marvellous  surprise,&rdquo; Blinky said as he reached down and took the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goo-day,&rsquo;&rsquo; Wally answered and  turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back shortly.&rdquo; Splodge  shouted as he hopped away. &ldquo;I might be able to get you another cat&rsquo;s whisker in  the township.&rdquo; He tried to cheer Wally up as he could see very plainly he was  sad at the parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t eat that potato in  lumps,&rdquo; he advised Blinky. &ldquo;In fact, the best thing you can do with it is to  give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Splodge&rsquo;s amazement Blinky  handed it over to him. Splodge was just about to pop it into his mouth when  Blinky called out sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to eat it, Splodge.  You&rsquo;re to take it to my mother with my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; Splodge  replied hastily. &ldquo;I really never intended to <i>eat</i> it. I was just going to carry  it between my teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very shortly Splodge and Blinky  entered the township and, making straight for the hall where only a short time  previously Blinky had carried off the coveted honour, they were welcomed by the  same men who had been the judges.</p>
<p>Then a discussion arose. How were  they to carry Blinky to Sydney? A large wicker basket had been carefully  prepared, lined with grass and bracken fern, and into this one of the men tried  to pop Blinky.</p>
<p>Well, he might just as well have  tried to pop a panther in there. The basket went flying in one direction and  Blinky in the other. The men looked worried.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301141h-images/page139.jpg" alt="worried" width="542" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t frighten the little  fellow,&rdquo; they said quietly, &ldquo;but what on earth are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge decided to take a hand in  matters. Hopping over to Blinky who stood glaring in a corner at the men and  the basket, he spoke very sternly to his little friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, young fellow my  lad&mdash;you can&rsquo;t go on with <i>that</i> sort of behaviour. They&rsquo;ll turn you down if you&rsquo;re  not careful and probably choose Snubby or Nutsy instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> going in a basket or any  tied up things,&rdquo; Blinky said angrily. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose they think I&rsquo;m wild and will  bite&mdash;and I <i>will</i> if they shut me up in parcels and boxes and things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about being carried just as  you are?&rdquo; Splodge suggested anxiously. He was beginning to get worried, too,  for he knew how naughty Mr. Blinky <i>could</i> be when he liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go that way s&rsquo;long as they  don&rsquo;t keep rubbing my nose and saying stupid things,&rdquo; Blinky replied, still  looking very cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; Splodge  heaved a deep sigh. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Give us your paw, and for goodness sake try  to behave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hopping across the hall, holding  Blinky by his paw, Splodge went up to the men, then picking his little friend  up gently placed him in the arms of the biggest man who looked extremely  surprised. He smiled with delight and at once made an attempt to pat Blinky on  the head with the remark, &ldquo;The poor little fellow is frightened,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frightened&mdash;instantly he got a kick  and a scratch for his pains.</p>
<p>Splodge at once intervened.  Shaking his head decidedly he brushed away the man&rsquo;s hand, then shook his head  again motioning to him not to stroke Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be blowed!&rdquo; the man  laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me after this that animals can&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right cobber, we won&rsquo;t stroke  you,&rdquo; he said kindly to Blinky. &ldquo;And I take it that I&rsquo;m to carry you. Well, I  won&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;ve always had a feeling I&rsquo;d like to cuddle one of you little  chaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge was delighted and Blinky  even gave a little growl of pleasure.</p>
<p>He rubbed his nose against Splodge  as he said goodbye and was then taken to a motor-car.</p>
<p>Splodge did not go to see Wally on  his way back. He went with all speed to tell Mrs. Koala and Nutsy all about  Blinky&rsquo;s departure. And he handed Mrs. Koala the sweet potato with Blinky&rsquo;s  message.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala looked very happy when  she heard all about the men and how kind they were. And when she and Nutsy went  to sleep early that morning she whispered to the old gum-tree just beforehand: &ldquo;Grow  a lot of nice leaves please, &rsquo;cause Blinky will come back soon.&rdquo; Sleeping  contentedly, she was startled just at dawn by Mrs. Magpie flapping her wings  and shouting at the top of her voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram, Mrs. Koala! A  telegram! A message from Blinky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly Mrs. Koala was awake. &ldquo;Tell  me, for goodness sake, tell me!&rdquo; she cried excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been listening to the  buzzing,&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie said, her beak opening and shutting in between words as  she tried to tell the news. She was terribly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky was speaking and he told  me to tell you he&rsquo;s having a lovely time with all the soldiers, and he&rsquo;ll be  allowed to come home very often to see you. And when I said how delighted you&rsquo;d  be, he said &lsquo;Okey-doke&rsquo; and I heard no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what in the world does &lsquo;Okey-doke&rsquo;  mean?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala asked, clasping and unclasping her paws with joy, while her  dear old face was wrinkled with smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s a new word he&rsquo;s  learned already,&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie replied. &ldquo;I always said Blinky was the cleverest  animal in the bush. The darling young cub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Magpie then said good-bye and  flew off to spread the news through the bush; for if there was anything she  liked, it was to be first with the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry Blinky some  day,&rdquo; Nutsy said to herself as she curled up in the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad he&rsquo;s happy,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  sighed as she snuggled down to sleep. &ldquo;I hope he marries Nutsy some day, then  he won&rsquo;t want to go away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! This is good,&rdquo; Blinky  grunted as he climbed up a gum-tree especially reserved for him at the camp, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad I&rsquo;m a boy and a soldier, and I&rsquo;m never going to get married &rsquo;cause I think  girls are silly.&rdquo;</p>
