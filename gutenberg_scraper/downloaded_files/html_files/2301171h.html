<h3><i>McClure's</i> v.37, May-Oct 1911</h3>

<hr>

<p>THE palm-fronds threshed softly; odors of frangipanni bloom,
reek of seaweed and coral trash, and of the Chinaman and the
incense of his joss-house mingled and were destroyed and produced
again by the fitful land breeze. Nigh to midnight the land breeze
became too strong for anything but the frangipanni scent; the
palm-fronds threshed through the air saturated with moonlight; the
red lamp on the jetty showed as a purple stain.</p>

<p>The last of the pilots of Torres Straits went to bed; the Grand
Hotel of Thursday Island closed its bar: but the two barefoot men
on the veranda still talked on the topic that had lasted since
dusk&mdash;the wreck of the <i>Pandora</i>; and one man, Pipon,
tried to soothe the other, Moresby, who talked without ceasing of
the wreck and twenty thousand pounds of pearls.</p>

<p>"Can't we get a launch, Jim?" he asked, for the twentieth time.
"A steamer or a launch?"</p>

<p>"I told you no," replied Pipon.</p>

<p>"Bear up, old man; y' can have a lugger."</p>

<p>"A lugger and a dead calm? It would be worse than waiting
here."</p>

<p>"Well, quiet a bit!"</p>

<p>"Quiet! How can I be?&mdash;when I am in a fever to be
there!"</p>

<p>He looked south as if trying to make out the coast of Australia,
now the ghost of a shadow in the moon haze and sea blur.</p>

<p>"What could you do if you were there Martin? You couldn't do
anything."</p>

<p>"I could stand by the wreck; I could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You couldn't do any good. It's lucky Phil Regard is coming
to-morrow. He's the British India diver. He'll do all there is to
be done."</p>

<p>"My pearls, Tom! The big one and nine ounces of little ones.
Oyley was bringing them up. What depth did the <i>Pandora</i> sink
in?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows, old man; or how she went. The skipper was a good
man&mdash;exempt, too. Knew every key and every inch of
reef&mdash;and there's millions of 'em."</p>

<p>"It was my rotten luck, Tom, to miss the <i>Pandora</i> by five
minutes, and then pick up the <i>Maranea</i> to catch her here, and
find, when I did get here, that she'd sunk fifty or a hundred miles
south. And there's my pearls&mdash;Oyley was taking charge of
'em&mdash;and then I missed the ship. Oh, gimme a raft&mdash;gimme
a kerosene-tin&mdash;and I'll start!"</p>

<p>"Not you! Come on; take a fool's advice and sleep. You'll wait
for the morning, and then leave it all to Phil Regard. He'll be
here to-morrow."</p>

<p>The grass trees rustled softly to the poinciana as the men went
to bed; the breeze strengthened to a wind, and replaced perfume
with a taste of salt; from the veranda above a man began to
whimper&mdash;a man that had seen death and terror and was now
dreaming it all over again and shrieking out the story in his
recurrent nightmare&mdash;the one survivor of the <i>Pandora</i>,
who had been picked up by a pearling lugger.</p>

<p>"She's going! Two minutes&mdash;you can't get the boats out of
the chocks. Why didn't they have boat practice? You can't! You
can't! Don't scream, women&mdash;dear women, don't
scream&mdash;it's better to drown than&mdash;ah, my God, the
sharks! the sharks!"</p>

<p><br>
Druce, the pilot of Torres Straits, boarded that slow, comfortable,
old-time high-pooped steamer of the tea clipper type, the
<i>Airlie</i>, at Goode Island, and brought her up in the early
dawn to the wharf at Thursday. A big, bearded, brown-eyed man was
the first to land; he was a man in a hurry&mdash;in a hurry for
news, at least. He waited for neither bath nor breakfast, but
aroused an irritated postmaster, and begged so for telegrams that
the postmaster gave him his mail long before the beginning of
office hours. There were many newspapers, and he did not look at
them; a dozen letters, all man-directed and official, and he put
them in his pocket. A bitter disappointment settled on his
face&mdash;the letter from the beloved was not there. He found new
hope in the telegrams. Alas! They were as the letters; and his
heart was heavy then. This diver of the sea, who knew no fear that
he could not fight down, fought against this disappointment and
could not conquer it.</p>

<p>"I telegraphed her from Darwin, and she hasn't wired a reply.
She's thoughtless, not cruel, not cruel&mdash;my girl."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket-book a faded photograph&mdash;faded not
by age but by wear; looked at it, and put it back again.</p>

<p>"God bless her! I'll telegraph again, and in seven days we'll be
together&mdash;for a month, anyhow. But&mdash;she might have made
sure of not missing the post; a letter would make me a king
to-day."</p>

<p>He returned to duty by taking a telegram from his pockets, and a
fierce resentment held him for a moment as he read it:</p>

<p class="telegram"><i>Pandora</i> sunk; locate wreck; if not
impossible recover gold, ship's papers. B. P. provide tug and
tender; made splendid terms.</p>

<p>So he would not see her in a week&mdash;happiness was to be
postponed again. He thought of the long two months of salvage
diving in the Flores Sea. Three months since he had seen her, and
now there was to be another fortnight of hunger for her!</p>

<p>But hope came to his comfort. "Another year and I'll have made
enough to retire on, with this new chance. And then, no separation
till dead finish comes!"</p>

<p>So he went to Burns Philip and arranged for the departure of the
little steamer, hired diving tenders, and had his diving gear
brought from the <i>Airlie's</i> hold. It was then that Moresby
found him&mdash;Moresby of the drowned pearls; and the new
commission made Phil Regard almost gay.</p>

<p>"Oyley had 'em," said Moresby. "I gave them to him to mind
because I was going on a spree in Brisbane."</p>

<p>"Was he straight, d'ye think?"</p>

<p>"I think so. He put 'em in a little steel box in his
trunk,&mdash;he had his own pearls in the box,&mdash;and his wife
had the key on a chain round her neck."</p>

<p>"What was the number of his cabin, and what was he like?"</p>

<p>"A dark, red-mustached chap&mdash;cabin number 41-43 B, port
side, near the music-room."</p>

<p>"You know the ship?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, I sailed on her from Sydney to Brisbane, and lost
my passage at Brisbane through going to the races. I gave the
pearls to Oyley when I was going ashore. But you will get 'em
again, mate?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Nobody knows where she foundered. But, if I
do?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds."</p>

<p>With the lack of ceremony characteristic of the latitude, every
man in the bar joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds!" said Druce, the pilot. "Five hundred
pounds for dredgin' fifteen or twenty thousand pounds out o' the
Pacific Ocean! Five hundred to find a ton of scrap-iron in eighty
thousand square miles o' coral? It's worth that to find the old
hulk that hit the rock somewhere, and sank on it, and jewed me out
o' pilot fees."</p>

<p>"I thought it wouldn't be hard to find the wreck," said Moresby
hesitatingly. "If&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Druce, "if your aunt had whiskers she'd be your
uncle. Why, I know ten wrecks about here that no man knows the name
of&mdash;ships that were never missed. You know, too, don't you,
Dan'l?"</p>

<p>An old man, bent and wizened, replied quaveringly: "I've seen
below me&mdash;when I've been down&mdash;old Spanish ships, an' old
Dutch ships, an' old Portugees down below; me in twenty fathom
water, an' them deep below, me man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twenty fathoms&mdash;too much," said the big diver. "I've got a
girl at home, and she wants me. Fifteen fathoms is all I care to
go."</p>

<p>"Aa-ah," said the old diver, nipping with his strong and crooked
fingers the arm and leg muscles of Phil Regard, "I was as strong
and straight as ye; but deep divin', an' showin' off above the
other min, an' takin' no notice o' the shootin' pains in me
legs&mdash;callin' it rheumatics, an' all the time 'tis the
paralyzer warnin' ye. An' then twenty-eight fathom I went, an'
hauled up&mdash;I was a cripple."</p>

<p>He laughed as he spoke, but there was in his eye a tear of
sorrow for his own dead strength; and, to cover his self-pity, he
said, with a feeble attempt at gaiety:</p>

<p>"But 'tis only here I am a cripple! Put me down in fifteen or
twenty fathom and give me the pressure on me skin again an' a
four-knot tide, an' I'll fly along the floorin' of the sea like a
sunbird."</p>

<p>"And you're offering five hundred pounds for the chance of
that?" said Druce to Moresby.</p>

<p>"Open your heart, Moresby. A mean man makes me spit blood."</p>

<p>"A thousand, then," said Moresby. "I want to be fair, and it's
all to nothing."</p>

<p>"It isn't," said Phil Regard. "I've got to go below on another
contract, and you think I've only got to open a cabin door and take
a key from some poor, dead woman, and open a box. But that means
two extra corners to go round, and the more corners the more
chances of fouling. It's your pearls to my life. I want a
certainty."</p>

<p>"Here y' are, then," said Moresby. "A hundred pounds for opening
the cabin door, and I'll take your word for it; and a thousand if
you bring back the pearls."</p>

<p>"It's a deal," agreed Phil Regard, and they shook hands on
it.</p>

<p>The warning bell of the <i>Airlie</i> clanged, and Druce
departed to his pilotage. Phil Regard, as yet only half resigned,
saw the steamer that should have borne him south disappear down the
channel, rounding the Residency, and so away to open sea. Then he
resolutely put regrets behind him and went to his tug and tender to
prepare for his attempt to find a few thousand tons of foundered
metal in an immensity of blue.</p>

<p>The survivor of the <i>Pandora</i> had become quiet enough to
talk of the horror of the wreck.</p>

<p>"I was steerage steward," he said, "Mister. I can't think! Stay
by me, Mister&mdash;don't leave me alone."</p>

<p>"Hold on to my coat, if you like. I'll stand by."</p>

<p>"We never had a boat practice&mdash;rottin' in the chocks, the
boats were. It was about eleven at
night&mdash;moonlight&mdash;quiet; y' could hear the scrapin' of
shovels in the stoke-hole on the flat sheets, and the noise came up
the ventilators. An' not a ripple. An' there I'm smoking by the
rail, waitin' till I can sneak out on the boat deck to
sleep&mdash;the glory hole bein' so hot. An' then it comes. It was
like a kid tearin' brown paper for fun. It seemed to get her
amidships&mdash;that was because she was drawing a lot more water
aft. Only one man came out of the engine-room. The man on the
bridge was mad! I was mad! The quiet people in the cabins had the
best death. Sharks got all the deck lot. She ran a minute or two,
an' I saw the water risin' closer up&mdash;an' loosed a raft and
went over. It was like hell. Mister, the howls. Her deck blew up
amidships. I think she's sound aft. An' the steam jumped out of her
funnel as thick as wool, an' down she goes. An' then on the raft I
seen white fire cutting the water all over, crisscrossin' it. It
was sharks. An' then a veil, an' more crisscrossin' of fire, o'
white lightnin', an 'another yell."</p>

<p>"I know! I know!" said Phil Regard soothingly. "Don't think of
it! Help me. Tell me where you think she went down."</p>

<p>"I can't help thinkin' of it. Heads o' people in the moonlight,
an' then rushin' fire, an' a scream like a horse burnin', an'
another head pulled under. Oh&mdash;oh! Another head gone."</p>

<p>"Steady! Steady! Take a pull at yourself. Where did she go
down?"</p>

<p>"A girl of twenty or so&mdash;I heard her singing in the saloon
the night before&mdash;a song about 'Mine, forever mine,' an' her
husband lookin' at her as if he was dyin' for her while she was
singin'. He was swimmin' with her when the sharks took him; an' I
beat the sea with me 'ands, an' brought the raft close, an' I was
bringin' her up to the raft&mdash;swish! comes the shark fire, an'
she went too. Oh, mate, hell it was!"</p>

<p>The diver's eyes grew moist at that; he thought of his beloved
safe at home, and the tragedy touched him nearly. But he said
again:</p>

<p>"Where's the <i>Pandora</i>?"</p>

<p>"I drifted to an island, an' then I went mad, an' the lugger
found me."</p>

<p>"To-day is Wednesday. When did the <i>Pandora</i> sink? Now,
think&mdash;listen! We may pick up somebody yet. Tell me."</p>

<p>"She sunk on Monday night."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"We made twelve knots to Cape Grenville; then we slowed to ten
to bring her in at daylight."</p>

<p>"What time at Cape Grenville?"</p>

<p>The survivor of the <i>Pandora</i> wrinkled his brows as if
thought were a physical pain, and replied: "Twelve o'clock in the
mornin'. Y' can't find her&mdash;she's got no masts, on'y hydraulic
winchpoles."</p>

<p>Phil Regard, with the dividers in his hand, said inquiringly:
"And she struck at eleven in the night?"</p>

<p>"It might have been later. I don't remember."</p>

<p>"We'll go on that. Where were you picked up?"</p>

<p>"The lugger came from Bushy Island."</p>

<p>Regard pricked off one hundred and ten miles on the chart.</p>

<p>"Somewhere east of New Castle Bay," he said.</p>

<p>Before noon he had left Thursday Island, taking the direct track
with his light-draft tugboat&mdash;east between Tuesday and Horn
islands; and then, after easting Mount Adolphus Island and
thridding the reefs to the south of it, steering south through the
turquoise of shallow water and into the sapphire of deep sea, he
ran south to Bushy Island, and then east over reefs, and then north
again, and then west, and then zigzag. And the next day he drove
slowly over a blackness in the coral bed; a monstrous black thing
surrounded by lazy sharks and darting brilliant fish that made the
sea-green water alive with swaying and flashing color, like the air
of a tropical jungle: the <i>Pandora</i>&mdash;almost on an even
keel and sunk in fourteen fathoms.</p>

<p>With a little reluctance, Regard made the preparations necessary
for such as dive in dress and helmet, and shaved clean the mustache
that had grown since he had dived in Flores Seas. The growing of
the mustache had been an innocent vanity for the pleasure of his
wife, who objected to his professionally beardless face, just as
the new suit was for her benefit and not to be worn until the day
of happy meeting, that he might shine all freshly in her eyes.
Then, in the warm shadow of the white awning, he stripped, and
donned the many woolen undergarments and the canvas dress, with its
water-tight red-rubber bands at wrists and ankles.</p>

<p>The tender put on his feet the great brass-toed boots of
twenty-eight pounds weight; and when he had climbed to the ladder
and placed his feet upon the rungs, they screwed his
twenty-eight-pound copper helmet on the collar-ring, and hung
thirty-eight pounds of lead upon his breast and thirty-eight pounds
of lead at his back. Life-line, piping, corselet, helmet, brass
boots, and leaden weight complete, the men at the pump began to
turn; the tender screwed the face-glass into the helmet and tapped
upon it as a signal; the pumps lifted the pressure of the weights
from the diver's chest. The air thudded irritatingly into the
copper prison that was the helmet; the sense of confinement, and
the close smell of the natural breathing element of man unnaturally
compressed, returned to Phil Regard. He thought of the wife in
Sydney&mdash;the last thought of the divinity before bracing
himself to work that had the chance of death in it always, though
use had brought danger into contempt; then he opened the valve that
he might get way to sink with, and dropped easily and gently into
the caresses of the water. The sun's shimmer on the sea dimmed to a
great pervading shaft of tawny light that made the sea-green
lucent, as the white sand below reflected the rays of the breathing
world.</p>

<p>The black corpse of the <i>Pandora</i> seemed to rise to him. He
closed the valve, and sank as through a cataract of feathers.
Avoiding the deck, he dropped to the bottom for a survey of the
hull. The current hurried him; he might have to wait until slack
water. But the lugger drifted too, and he walked rapidly on his
toe-tips around the wreck. There could be no doubt of the
impossibility of raising her. From the great gaping hole amidships,
that extended from one side of her to the other, swam fish of all
colors, playing in those puzzling tunnels. Moving lightly as a
feather-weight, as if the laws of gravitation had been repealed,
Regard studied the situation. All about him stretched tangles of
seaweed and coral with white walks between the spongy copses and
the brakes. A yellow water-snake followed his every movement with
curious imitation, and white fish circled around his helmet so that
a green hand must have become dizzy. From a rift in the rock
wavered the tentacles of a devilfish feeling its way to crime with
every cup and sucker; immense shoals of young fish were being
driven to the surface by stronger bullies. Yet, with all its
clamorous hunger and insolent murder, it was a world of bewildering
loveliness.</p>

<p>Upon the ribbed sand the starfish; above, the brilliance of
living coral: the great violet bouquet-shaped madrepora, its coral
flowers with buff branches and petals of magenta; staghorn corals
in brown and yellow and lilac and green; coral valleys of myrtle
green, coral ridges of golden brown, all the glorified forms of
carbonate of lime&mdash;beautiful as the fish, brilliant as the
painted finch, and tinted like the Raggiana bird of paradise.
Regard stepped on a branch of heliopora coral, and it broke in
indigo.</p>

<p>Brakes of broad-bladed sca-grass grew as in a swampy meadow for
the sea-cow; trepang like black cucumbers slumbered on the sand;
weed-grown pearl oysters protected themselves with water made
turbid by Regard's footfalls; a big blue-spoked stingray faltered
by a rock; and prone on the ruffled floor lay a great skate, which
is a flattened shark. Everywhere the water swarmed with strange and
beautiful forms: the parrot-fish in his livery of black and gray
and scarlet; the giant anemone and his galaxy of sea-stars; the
peacock blue and green frills and furbelows of the giant clam
shells, spotted turquoise and barred black; the grotesque
tobacco-pipe fish of golden and azure spotted brown; the placid
brown oxray, so blundering that it is often unintentionally
malevolent, since if it once takes hold upon air-pipe or life-line
it never lets go; yellow-finned and ultramarine-bodied fish; black
and electric-blue fish; fish arabesqued in green and salmon and
black and gray and orange and blue and yellow; fish of protective
fin and tassel and little body; fish with long brown pennants
growing from their heads; mad fish with upturned noses; tasseled,
branded, striped, speckled, barred, spotted fish, each painted like
a Carpentaria finch.</p>

<p>The weight of ocean pressed the diver softly in his armor of the
air; his body felt as if stroked by the silky hands of the
caressing sea&mdash;kindly even to the little fragile sea flowers.
And then from the great tunnel in the hull of the <i>Pandora</i>
came floating, gorged and lazy, the horrors of the deep.</p>

<p>Used as he was to these cruel cowards, in the light of the story
of the bride who had died in the wreck, they held for him a new
horror, and for a moment he was afraid. Their gorged habit, their
slow, plethoric movements, their dull eyes, forgetting for a moment
to be greedy, told the tale. Regard felt almost physically sick.
All those eyes looked at him threateningly, contemptuously; the
little fish that swam up to his face-glass and gazed at him did not
seem to be frightened as quickly as usual by the movement of his
hands.</p>

<p>The sharks came nearer, and Regard, lifting the rubber
wrist-band, shot air at them in a succession of silver bullets, and
the cowards became energetic and fled. A carpet-bag shark, the
incarnation of filthy malevolence, hovered above him until Regard
turned the escape-valve on his helmet and shot a madness of fear
into the horrible thing.</p>

<p>He finished his survey of the hull with difficulty, attended
always by the yellow sea-snake, which followed him as if it
expected food from this strange monster, accompanying him to within
a few fathoms of surface. For an hour Regard rested and fed; then
he went to the ladder, and was loaded and imprisoned again, and
sank down to the deck of the <i>Pandora</i>.</p>

<p>His retinue of enemies left him at the entrance to the saloon;
but the small fish, their brilliance seeming to light the
half-gloom, swam into the depths and in and out at the
portholes&mdash;"like schoolboys playing a game," thought Phil
Regard. Even there some little things had begun already to benefit
by the fall of greatness; little pearl shells as big as a
thumb-nail&mdash;born in motion from the spat, floating in the
current, and sucked down by the foundering ship&mdash;had here spun
their byssus to tie them to the saloon stairs, hiding their
weakness in this unexpected asylum.</p>

<p>"All this death to make a safe hiding-place for a shell,"
thought Regard bitterly, as he walked on tiptoe through this silent
world where all values of vision were distorted, where a waving
shadow seemed to be a fish and a fish of sober hues was as shadow
until the hand felt its form.</p>

<p>He thought hard&mdash;racking his brains inside his copper
prison for the memory of the plan of the ship.</p>

<p>"The ship's papers will be in the captain's safe; I'll get them
to-morrow. The specie-room is inside the mail-room; I'll find
that." So, with due regard for the safety of air-pipe and life-line
against projections and fittings, he left the saloon, its
decorations already dimmed by the traveling slime of the sea, and
found the mail-room, and beyond it the specie-room intact.</p>

<p>He talked to himself, and the words reverberated to him from the
helmet: "I'll bring dynamite and a wire down and blow the
specie-room open, rig a winch, and haul out the gold boxes. That'll
be to-morrow. And while I'm here I'll do the horrible
job&mdash;Moresby's pearls."</p>

<p>He went back to the saloon stairs. Above it a great gray shape
hung watchfully, patiently, as if it had all eternity to wait in.
Regard, with never a quickening of the pulse, fired the silver
bullets from his wrist-band, and the gray shape backed and fled.
Regard laughed and went on to find Moresby's pearls.</p>

<p>He opened a cabin door. Two fish fled through the porthole, and
the body of a woman came at him in the swirl of the water. The dead
face struck his helmet. Regard cried out in horror, and backed
away. But in a moment he caught his courage and closed the
porthole; then he shut the cabin door again and went to the next.
He could not distinguish the letter denoting the corridor, nor the
number either. He opened an inner cabin, and a drowned man came out
and struck him. He opened another, and there were in it a dead man
and a dead woman trying with her floating skirts to hide a little
child from the sea. The man had tried to save another child, and
that other child had fixed his teeth in his father's arm, and so
had died in cruel fear of the green death that had shipped with
them. Horror gripped the diver as with fingers of cold steel.</p>

<p>Yet his duty was to be done, and he did it. He found B corridor,
and the first cabin had in it a dead girl with her hands clasped as
if she still prayed. He closed the cabin reverently, and came to
another in which an old man and an old woman had died in their bed
places; and then to an outer cabin opposite the one he had first
entered. The light was better there; he saw that this was B 41 at
last, and that by a little care he might have saved himself the
awfulness that had shaken him.</p>

<p>The lock of B 41 did not yield to the lifting of the handle, so
Regard inserted the point of his small ax between the door and the
beading and levered it open. Two bodies, those of a man and a
woman,&mdash;the man's as if he had died standing, the woman's in
the lower berth floating up against the wires of the upper
berth,&mdash;moved queerly in the disturbed liquid&mdash;as if they
were alive.</p>

<p>"Porthole closed," said Regard to himself, trying not to look at
the dead for a moment. "He had the fan going&mdash;the lever's on
the top speed."</p>

<p>He looked at the body of the man, and shudderingly turned him
around in the water.</p>

<p>"That'll be the man Moresby gave the pearls to. Oyley was the
name, and he looks it. There's the trunk under the berth. And this
poor soul has the key round her neck. I cant do it... But I
promised. I'll do it to-morrow... No; better now&mdash;get it done
with. Forgive&mdash;whoever you are, forgive me. Young, too, and
pretty." With a shaking hand and covering his face, he touched the
woman's neck, and there he felt the necklet and the key.</p>

<p>"It's horrible. I'll have to use both hands for the
fastening."</p>

<p>As if he were physically afraid of it he looked back at the
sinister dead man floating near the porthole; then, swiftly and
without looking, he unfastened the necklet and held it up&mdash;a
necklet and a key. The movement floated the body from its position
against the springs of the upper berth; it turned upright, floating
by his head&mdash;through the little circle of the face-glass its
dead eyes looked sorrowfully into his own.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;madness! Unbelief! Doubt! Unbelief again! And
again madness! clamored through his brain. The air seemed to be
withdrawn; the helmet became a mountain of copper; the weights upon
his back and breast were each a ton of lead. He looked at the
necklet&mdash;yes, it was so! He had given it. He released it, and
it sank to the ooze upon the sodden carpet. He looked at the
bracelet of opal before the mirror, and recognized it, too; and
then at the dead woman gazing at him mournfully with eyes that
seemed to plead: "Forgive; I have been punished, and repented so;
forgive."</p>

<p>Still unbelieving, but stunned, he pushed the dead man through
the door and out of the alleyway (evicting it as if its presence in
that cabin still outraged propriety); and it floated up, bobbing
queerly in the tide eddies. Then he turned back, mad but
unbelieving, and re-entered the cabin. There could be no
doubt&mdash;no doubt! He left her there, and fastened the cabin
door behind him. And then his heart broke.</p>

<p>He could not live! With his last conscious instinct, he hacked
with uncertain hand at the air-pipe, and missed it; then the weight
of all the ocean settled on his heart and he wavered to the
floor.</p>

<p>He had a conscientious tender. At that sudden jag upon the
life-line the tender hauled carefully, and, by that luck which
shames the best judgment, drew Philip Regard safely through the
alleyway to the deck of the <i>Pandora</i> and up to sunlight.</p>

<p>But they might as well have left him there, for the strong man
who had dived never returned to the surface.</p>

<p>"Beats me!" said Druce, looking pityingly at the withered wreck
that sat every day, and through all the daylight hours of every
day, upon the veranda of Thursday Island hospital. "Can't
understand it. A fine, big, strong world-beater of a man paralyzed
in fourteen fathoms. It beats me!"</p>
