  Dad Makes a Speech</b></h2>
<p>Dad had been a  member of Parliament for several years, and had gained a reputation for  fearless, violent debating, and for hard practical common sense.</p>
<p>A new Government  was in power, and there was a long debate on. People crowded into the House,  and thronged the galleries. The Chamber presented a new and strange appearance.  The Government side of it was crammed. Had any more members been returned by  the people to support that Premier, they would have had to sit outside and support  him on the steps.</p>
<p>The proceedings  opened with prayer and adjourned in wrath. For several weeks they opened and  adjourned in like manner. Then one evening a piece of the policy&mdash; the part that  they had left behind in the drawers when they went to the country&mdash; was  unfolded, and business commenced.</p>
<p>The Treasurer, a  sturdy, pompous, Cromwellian sort of politician, rose and began his second  reading speech on &ldquo;A Land Betterment Bill.&rdquo; He explained all the beauties and  perfections of that Bill; said he had a lot of faith in it; said it was to be  the salvation of the country; and was confident that members would find the  principle embodied in it simple and easily understood. &ldquo;Whoso maketh a thing,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;whoso createth a value, to him that thing or value belongs,&rdquo; (Loud  cheers from the Government benches.) &ldquo;Let me illustrate my meaning,&rdquo; he went  on. &ldquo;Suppose John Smith buys 100 acres of land at &pound;1 per acre; and suppose  further that he improves and clears that land, or spends money or labour on it  equal to &pound;4 per acre, then everyone must recognise that John Smith, has a  property right in that land to the extent of &pound;500.&rdquo; Everyone did; they got up  and cheered the prophet. He referred to the teachings of John Stuart Mill, and  they cheered some more. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued confidently, &ldquo;further suppose that  a railway is built into the district where that land is, and the value of John  Smith&rsquo;s holding is increased thereby in value from &pound;5 to &pound;8 per acre, then it  must be clear to everyone that if John Smith has a property right in the &pound;5 per  acre which he created, the community which added another &pound;3 per acre to the  value of the land has a property right in that increased value&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tis a <i>lie</i>; &rsquo;twould be robbery!&rdquo; Dad shouted.  And was silenced by the Speaker.</p>
<p>When the Treasurer  had ceased his references to Mill, and his mathematical calculations, the  Leader of the Opposition and the member for Targo rose in turn and abused the  Bill. Then Dad caught the Speaker&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Dad  commenced in a loud aggressive voice&mdash; (Laughter and guffaws from the Government  end of the House.) Dad paused, and glared at the scoffers till they were  silent, then proceeded: &ldquo;I was sent into this House by honest sensible farmers  and selectors&mdash;men an&rsquo; their wives who have been struggling all th&rsquo; days of  their life on the land&mdash;an&rsquo; I was sent ter look after their interests an&rsquo; ter  tell any Government that would make bad laws&mdash;that tries ter bring in  mischievous legislation, what I think of them. (Hear! Hear!) An&rsquo; I tell this  Gover&rsquo;ment (Dad raised his clenched fist above his head) that this Bill is  nothing but broad daylight <i>robbery</i>.&rdquo;  (Down came Dad&rsquo;s fist like a sledge hammer.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; from  the Treasurer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not  nonsense,&rdquo; Dad yelled back, &ldquo;this Bill is <i>nonsense</i>&mdash;  and all the rot you have been telling this House about it is nonsense! With  your prattle about things what someone called Mill have to say! What&rsquo;s the good  o&rsquo; <i>that?</i> (Opposition laughter.) What  have he ter do with peoples&rsquo; land?&rdquo; (Loud laughter, and &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand  it&rdquo; from the Treasurer.) &ldquo;I <i>do</i> understand it,&rdquo; Dad shouted. &ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t understand when a man tries  ter put his hand into my pocket that he wants to help himself ter something he  never put there?&rdquo; (Opposition cheers.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t find  anything there, only pumpkin, if he did,&rdquo; interjected the member for Sandy  Gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d find more  there than he&rsquo;d find in yours,&rdquo; Dad snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not like ye&mdash; I didn&rsquo;t come  here fer a <i>livin&rsquo;</i>. (Cheers and  laughter from the Opposition.) I won my independence workin&rsquo; and battlin&rsquo; on th&rsquo;  land. (Hear! Hear!) I went on the land, Mr. Speaker, more than forty year ago,  when I hadn&rsquo;t enough ter buy a billy-can with&mdash; when there was no railway, and  when there wasn&rsquo;t another settler within ten mile o&rsquo; me&mdash;(applause)&mdash;an&rsquo; I would  ask the Minister that brings this Bill here to tax selectors with if he knows  anything about land? If he knows what selecting in this country meant ter the  pioneers of it, and what it means ter this day? (Opposition cheers, and cries  of &ldquo;Rot&rdquo; from the other side.) I stand here and tell him he knows <i>nothing</i> of it. He comes here a newchum,  with his head stuffed full of fine ideas about some fool&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad was pulled up  by the Speaker. &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the honorable member must not indulge in  terms which are unparliamentary, and must withdraw them.&rdquo; (Loud &ldquo;Hear, Hears!&rdquo;  from Ministers.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Dad  roared on, &ldquo;with ideas about some fellow he calls &lsquo;Mill&rsquo;&mdash; (laughter)&mdash; and wants  to take half of the increased value of a poor man&rsquo;s bit of land ter put in his  Treasury to pay debts and things with that every loafer and sundowner in th&rsquo;  country have had a hand in incurrin&rsquo;. (Cheers from the Opposition.) He talks in  a fine way about a selection increasing in value till it&rsquo;s worth &pound;500. What is  that to a poor man after his twenty years&rsquo; battle with it&mdash; after his years of  scrub-cutting and fighting fires, with livin&rsquo; on dry bread, and harrowin&rsquo; his  grain in perhaps with a bramble before he sees his deeds&mdash; after payin&rsquo; interest  at 10 per cent, and 12 per cent, for fifteen years&mdash;after sinkin&rsquo; wells all over  it, and never gettin&rsquo; any water? (Loud cheering from the opponents of the  Bill.) I tell the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, that he don&rsquo;t know what he talks  about. With this Bill, he is like a lunatic runnin&rsquo; about with a loaded gun in  his hand&mdash;(roars of laughter)&mdash; and the sooner the gun is taken off of him and  smashed across a fence, the better it will be for the people of this country.  (Renewed laughter.) He talks about the value that a railway gives to a man&rsquo;s  land, and wants to pocket some of it on that account. I never in all my days  heerd of such an impudent reason for stealing a man&rsquo;s property. Sir, a  cattle-duffer has more decency and honour than that. A <i>railway</i>,&rdquo; Dad fairly yelled, &ldquo;confound it! Doesn&rsquo;t the selector  help to build the railway? (Hear! Hear!) Doesn&rsquo;t he pay freight and fares to  that railway for carrying his produce and himself and his family when they can  afford to go anywhere? Surely to God that should be enough! (Cheers.) If it  isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dad lowered both hands below his knees, and struck a lifting attitude,  &ldquo;if it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; and he suited the word  to the action, &ldquo;then tear your d&mdash; railways up.&rdquo; (Cheers from the Opposition.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order!&rdquo; the  Speaker cried again, &ldquo;I warn the honourable member not to continue using terms  which are unparliamentary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Hear, hear!  Hear, hear!&rdquo; from the Treasury benches.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say <i>tear them up</i>,&rdquo; Dad went on, &ldquo;and go back  to the bullock drays and the coach. <i>They&rsquo;ll</i> carry produce and passengers nearly as quick as your trains, and are doing it  in parts of the country now, and they&rsquo;re not asking the people for any of the  increased value of their bit of land for doing it either. (Loud cheering.) Mr.  Speaker, this Bill is <i>robbery!</i> (Government dissent.) &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis <i>thievery!</i> (Great disorder.) And the Government know it! (&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; and more disorder.)  You <i>do!</i>&rdquo; and Dad lifted his voice a  note higher, &ldquo;and <i>shame</i> on you! <i>shame</i> on you, for trying ter sell the  electors that sent you here ter make honest laws fer them. (Opposition cheers  and Government dissent.) You told them there would be no more taxation, and &rsquo;tis  nothing but taxin&rsquo; and taxin&rsquo; them you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;. The very first thing you do is  to break your pledge&mdash;to <i>lie!</i> (Uproar  and &ldquo;Order, Order!&rdquo; from the Speaker.) Then you put a charge on a poor man&rsquo;s  few dairy cows (Hear, hear!) and you want him to pay for carrying a gun about,  and another of you would bleed more money from him fer keepin&rsquo; his own  stallion. (Cries of &ldquo;No&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;) &rsquo;Tis scandalous! &rsquo;Tis <i>villainy!</i>&rdquo; (Great uproar, and Dad again  called to order.) &ldquo;To th&rsquo; devil with the railways and their increased value&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo;  cried the Speaker, &ldquo;the honourable member must address the House in more  respectful language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them build  their railways into some part of the bush where there&rsquo;s no one,&rdquo; Dad howled, &ldquo;and  see how much it will increase the value of the land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Treasurer: &ldquo;So  it would when the people settle there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,  charge an increased price for it, and the people will know what the bargain is  they are making. But until they <i>do</i> go  and settle there, your railway wouldn&rsquo;t be worth tuppence&mdash; &rsquo;twould rust.&rdquo;  (Hear, Hear!) Dad paused for breath, then continued. &ldquo;But this Bill is a <i>shameful</i> piece of work! (Dissent.) &rsquo;Tis  full of tricks and traps to grind selectors down and take their land away from  them! (Cries of &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; and cheers from the Opposition.) It <i>is!</i> All the Treasurer&rsquo;s fine talk about  letting a man make his own valuation is <i>lies!</i> (Great disorder and cheers, in the midst of which the Speaker&rsquo;s rebukes and  appeals for order are drowned.) &rsquo;Tis <i>false</i> magemanimity! (Dissent, intermingled with laughter.) &rsquo;Tis a trick to get a man  to value his property for more than &rsquo;tis worth, and if he undervalue it, you  take it off him at that price. (Hear, Hear!) And how many farmers are there in  the country, let me ask you, who would think of selling their places even for a <i>hundred</i> pounds more than they are  worth? What good would it do them? It wudn&rsquo;t be enough to keep them; and do you  think they want to begin an&rsquo; cut holes in the bush again, and to fight drought,  and floods, and fires, and mean <i>bad</i> Governments? (Cheers from the Opposition.) And this is the kind of law-making  we get from a Ministry that prattles about settling people on the land, an&rsquo;  trots round the country patting farmers on the back and gorgin&rsquo; on their  banquets! (Cheers.) &rsquo;Tis treachery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;tis highway  robbery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;tis d&mdash; roguery&mdash;&rdquo;  (Uproar.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo;  the Speaker cried. &ldquo;The Honourable member must not make such statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Premier rose  angrily, and asked that the member for Eton Vale be called on to withdraw the  words &ldquo;d&mdash; roguery,&rdquo; and the Speaker called upon Dad to withdraw them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve said  is th&rsquo; plain <i>truth!</i>&rdquo; Dad shouted,  throwing his arms and head about.</p>
<p>Loud cries of  &ldquo;Shame&rdquo; and &ldquo;Withdraw&rdquo; from the Government benches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NEVER!&rdquo; Dad  howled.</p>
<p>The Speaker: &ldquo;I  ask the honourable member for Eton Vale to withdraw the words the Premier  complains of, which are most unparliamentary.&rdquo; (Commotion.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>not!</i>&rdquo; Dad shouted. &ldquo;I defy you to make  me withdraw what I know is the truth,&rdquo; (Great confusion, during which the  Speaker &ldquo;named&rdquo; Dad to the House.)</p>
<p>The Premier  jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;I regret that the honourable member for Eton Vale should again be the  cause of another disgraceful scene in this Chamber, and when that member not  only violates the rules and propriety of this House, but openly hurls defiance  at your executive authority, sir, I am compelled, however painful the duty may  be, to move that the honourable member be suspended for the term of one week.&rdquo;  (Disorder, and cries of &ldquo;Gag&rdquo; and yells and howls of approval.)</p>
<p>The motion was  carried, and the Speaker said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the  pleasure of this House that the member for Eton Vale be suspended for one  week&mdash;(more confusion)&mdash; and I ask the honourable member to withdraw from its  precincts.&rdquo; (Great uproar.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Dad  shouted furiously, &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the  Sergeant-at-Arms and officers of the House approached, and Dad prepared for  violence. But the Leader of the Opposition spoke persuasively to him, and he  strode out quietly. At the bar of the House, he turned, and shouted &ldquo;<i>Thieves! Robbers!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  The Home-Coming</b></h2>
<p>A cold day at  Saddletop. A bitter westerly howled over the broad, billowy plains, penetrating  the huts and homes of the selectors. Limbs of tall grey, ghostly-looking gum  trees tossed and swayed in the wind. Horses and cattle, shaggy coated and  hump-backed, sought shelter in the mountainous timber-land. Sleepy native  bears, indifferent to the wind or the weather or the world, crouched calmly in  the highest forks of the great trees. Fallen forest leaves drifted into heaps,  and all round was dreary, desolate, dead, and dry.</p>
<p>Mrs. Banks and  her daughter Amelia, both shaking and shivering with the cold, dropped into our  place. They came to see mother and Sarah in the interests of Temperance. They  were the promoters&mdash;the guiding stars&mdash;of the Saddle-top Band of Hope. Mother was  pleased to see them. She shook them by the hand and asked them how they were,  and if they had had the influenza, and made them a cup of tea. Then Mrs. Banks  began to talk, and unfolded her programme to mother.</p>
<p>Strong drink, she  said, was a horrible evil, a curse that brought nothing but ruin and misery to  every home it entered. She implored Mother and Sarah to join her in her efforts  to put it down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sorrowful thing,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to see men wasting  their money in drink, going in debt for it even, and ruining their health and  their lives and getting into gaol, and even committing murder. Oh, it&rsquo;s  horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not once in a  year was a drunk ever seen on Saddletop. He was rarer than a rich relation.  None of him had time to get drunk, even if he had the inclination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many and many a  time, Mrs. Rudd,&rdquo; the temperance one went on, &ldquo;do I thank God my husband never  touches a drop, and ah! it is such a blessing&mdash;far before all the money and land  in the world to feel that when he goes to the railway station or to town, he&rsquo;ll  come home sober, and he was always the same. And I always tell Amelia she must  get a husband like her father&mdash;and never to mind what he might be, or if he  hasn&rsquo;t a shilling in the world to bless himself with, so long as he doesn&rsquo;t  drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother agreed  with Mrs. Banks that drink <i>was</i> a bad  thing; &ldquo;too much,&rdquo; she thought wasn&rsquo;t good for anyone, but added that there  were <i>some</i> who could &ldquo;take a little  now and again without doing themselves any harm.&rdquo; Mother was a cautious woman.  She remembered once or twice having smelt drink on Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe  it,&rdquo; Mrs. Banks squealed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it at all. No one can touch drink  without it getting a hold of them&mdash;don&rsquo;t you believe it; not without it becoming  master of them; no! no! no! once a drunkard always a drunkard. And then,&rdquo;  lowering her voice, &ldquo;they go <i>down, down,  down</i> to despair and the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just here Joe  strolled in and shook hands with Mrs. Banks and Amelia, and asked them how the  wheat was. Mrs. Banks asked him if he would come along to the Band of Hope the  following Thursday night and sing something, and set a good example to &ldquo;the  wild young fellows in the district,&rdquo; and bring Sarah with him.</p>
<p>Joe smiled, and  enquired if there would be any beer there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Banks turned  to Joe. &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; she commenced, but her attack was cut short. Barty, who  was standing on the verandah, suddenly yelled, &ldquo;Come here, quick! quick!&rdquo; Then  broke into a loud cheerful laugh, that raised commotion in the ranks of the  poultry parading the back yard.</p>
<p>Everyone,  including Mrs. Banks, rushed out.</p>
<p>Slowly  approaching the gate were two men &ldquo;doublebank&rdquo; on an old hairy horse, both with  their hats on the side of their heads, and tossing and rocking about like a  small boat among the breakers.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page012.jpg" alt="old men" width="650" height="621"></p>
<p>Joe and Sarah and  Amelia regarded them with merriment, and laughed heartier than Barty did.</p>
<p>Mother smiled,  and said, &ldquo;Dear! dear! dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Banks  adjusted her spectacles and stared, then lifted her hands and said to Mother, &ldquo;There  now, what have I been saying? Doesn&rsquo;t that prove every word I said? Oh, that  horrible curse, drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe suddenly stopped  laughing, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Moses! the fellow behind is <i>Dad</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Who?</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Banks asked, sharply,  adjusting her spectacles again, and staring harder than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Joe  repeated. &ldquo;D&mdash;it,&rdquo; and ran to the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Rudd,&rdquo;  Mrs.Banks said, turning to mother, &ldquo;I am <i>so</i> sorry for you, I am, I am indeed. You deserve a better&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And the other&rsquo;s father!&rdquo; &mdash;FATHER!&rdquo; Amelia  squealed, recognising her parent as his head rose from the horse&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Mrs. Banks  clutched her daughter&rsquo;s arm, and screeched, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s father, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours, <i>ours</i>, MINE!&rdquo; the girl shrieked back,  reeling about on the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful heaven!  Not Jim&mdash;not <i>James?</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Banks  gasped, hanging tightly to Amelia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>father!</i>&rdquo; Amelia squealed again.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Banks  covered her face with her hands, and staggered some more.</p>
<p>It was too much  for Sarah. She broke into a fresh fit of merriment, and ran inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woesh, Carbine,&rdquo;  Dad shouted, reaching round the man in the stroke seat, and hitting out at the  animal&rsquo;s ears with his hard hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; Joe  said, &ldquo;Steady, you old fool, or you&rsquo;ll both come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dad was in a  merry mood. &ldquo;Woesh,&rdquo; he said again, and aimed another welt at Carbine&rsquo;s woolly  ears, and the animal put down its head, and Banks fell over in the dust.</p>
<p>Joe chuckled.  Mrs. Banks and Amelia screamed, and ran down the verandah to see if Banks were  dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tolsh him, he  couldn&rsquo;t shstick a buck,&rdquo; Dad hiccoughed, scrambling down the side of the  craft, and extending his parliamentary hand to Joe.</p>
<p>Mrs. Banks  approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James!&rdquo; she  gasped, taking the muddled Banks by the shoulders and glaring into his eyes. &ldquo;What  is the meaning of all this?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ish zat yoush,  &rsquo;Lisha?&rdquo; Banks said.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page014.jpg" alt="zat" width="602" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you brute&mdash;you <i>beast!</i> You know well its me.&rdquo; Then  she shook her lean fist in his face, and shrieked with fearful emphasis. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a time and a place for everything, <i>but  wait till I get you home, Banks!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning to  her daughter&mdash;&ldquo;Come along, Amelia, and leave the wretch,&rdquo; and off they tramped  without even saying &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; to Mother and Sarah.</p>
<p>Dad took  possession of Banks, and with the assistance of Joe piloted him through the  gate, and up the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice way for  you to come home,&rdquo; Mother said reproachfully to Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one at (hic)  station, ansh I givesh him double,&rdquo; Banks put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theysh kicked me  oush Parlmen&rsquo;, Ellen,&rdquo; Dad mumbled, &ldquo;kicked me oush. Sushpen&rsquo;ed me (hic) one  weeksh, wonsh go back any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no wonder,&rdquo;  Mother said.</p>
<p>Then Dad and  Banks sat down inside, and in a rambling, unintelligible sort of way, argued on  politics and dairying until near night&mdash;until Mrs. Banks, who had changed her  mind about leaving her husband, returned suddenly, and flew at him, and pulled  him out of the chair by his hair and whiskers, and screamed in his ear and shed  hot angry tears down his neck, and ordered him home. Banks gathered himself  together and went. Banks was an obedient husband.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nearly  three years ago now, and though Mrs. Banks still pays visits to our place she  never says anything to Mother about Temperance.</p>

  Mrs. Peterson&rsquo;s Remains</b></h2>
<p>Dad wouldn&rsquo;t go  back to the House any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parliament is no  place for an honest man,&rdquo; he said, and he resigned in favour of Regan. Then he  put away his new clothes, and rolled up his sleeves, and became himself again.</p>
<p>Old Peterson came  to our place one night, and talked to Dad about removing the remains of his  (Peterson&rsquo;s) wife from Pikedale out-station to Saddletop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have  her near me,&rdquo; he said, with tears in his eyes, &ldquo;so when I go off they can put  me along side o&rsquo; her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs,&rdquo; Dad said  approvingly, &ldquo;yairs, an&rsquo; it be a lonesome place, too, out where she lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It nearly killed  I, Rudd,&rdquo; Peterson said, &ldquo;to leave her there; but <i>you</i> know what them days were when she and me were shepperdin&rsquo; for  the Smiths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad remembered  them well, and added&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She be buried  under the same tree with Jones what wer&rsquo; killed be th&rsquo; blacks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peterson  answered softly, &ldquo;that were Dan Fitzgerald the newchum; we put him near my old  woman. Jones, he be planted down on the crick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought he were  under the tree, too,&rdquo; Dad said, reflecting, &ldquo;and that there were a flat stone  on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peterson  replied, &ldquo;th&rsquo; stone it be on my poor old woman; the only stone there be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,  Peterson,&rdquo; Dad said, suddenly remmembering the circumstances, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;  and, with a gimlet, he scratched a plan of the station graves on the table,  showing the position of the &ldquo;crick&rdquo; and the tree, and the gate, to convince  Peterson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo;  Peterson said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after  reflecting&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t  mind paying some of the lads (looking at Dave and Joe) five pounds or so to  shift her down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Dad  said, looking suggestively at Dave, &ldquo;Jusso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, drive  fifty miles,&rdquo; Dave said, &ldquo;and dig up  someone for five pounds? I wouldn&rsquo;t do it for a hundred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor me&mdash;for five  hundred,&rdquo; Joe put in promptly, &ldquo;and fancy campin&rsquo; out with the bones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother and Sarah  shuddered at thoughts of the undertaking; while Tom and Bill chuckled, and were  loudly ordered to leave the room by Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need have no  fear,&rdquo; Peterson said, looking at Joe, &ldquo;she never would hurt anyone, would my  old woman, never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Joe shook his  head, and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad said,  thinking of the five pounds, &ldquo;when the lucerne&rsquo;s all in I&rsquo;ll take the cart, and  go for her myself, Peterson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  Mother said with a look of disapproval at Dad, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad  answered, &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s got to be done, woman, somebody must do it, an&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t  expect th&rsquo; man to do it himself, can y&rsquo;? I wouldn&rsquo;t like ter have ter do it if  it were <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Peterson  shook hands with Dad, and called him a Christian, and went home.</p>
<p>The lucerne was  in, and Dad went over and saw Peterson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is  ready,&rdquo; Peterson said, and opened the door of his slab skillion, and took Dad  inside, and showed him a rough unpolished pine coffin resting on a pair of  tressels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Dad  mumbled, &ldquo;h&rsquo;m,&rdquo; and was approaching the coffin to inspect it, when a head and a  long naked neck leaned over the edge, and looked out at him.</p>
<p>Dad jumped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a savage  old wretch,&rdquo; Peterson said, taking a broody hen by the neck, and lifting her  from the coffin, and dropping her on to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To th&rsquo; devil  with &rsquo;er,&rdquo; Dad shouted, when the hen, with ruffled feathers, flew viciously at  his shins, and, lifting his foot, he kicked her right out the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two others,&rdquo;  Peterson said, lifting some more poultry from the coffin, &ldquo;th&rsquo; three of em&rsquo;s  been sittin&rsquo; in it fer munds, and ain&rsquo;t brought out one chicken yet between em.</p>
<p>Dad regarded  Peterson with a suspicious eye. Dad seemed to doubt Peterson&rsquo;s sanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the lid  of it,&rdquo; Peterson went on, taking a board from a corner, and fitting it on the  coffin, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s some screws for it somewhere here,&rdquo; and he foraged about a  dusty shelf, but failed fo find any.</p>
<p>Then each took an  end of the coffin, and carried it out, and loaded Peterson&rsquo;s cart with it. And  when it was fastened so that it couldn&rsquo;t slip off, Dad returned home, and told  Bill to keep Prince in all night.</p>
<p>Early next  morning, Dad, loaded to the ground with &ldquo;tools and provisions and things  required on the journey, and accompanied by Barty, brought Prince along, and  harnessed him to Peterson&rsquo;s cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you won&rsquo;t  forget,&rdquo; Peterson said, when Dad had stuffed the provisions into the coffin, &ldquo;the  grave nearest the gate with th&rsquo; flat stone on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo;  Dad answered, impatiently, and mounting beside Barty, took the reins, and drove  off.</p>
<p>It was a glorious  morning. The air was crisp and clear. A heavy dew, glistening like diamonds,  was on the grass. Magpies warbled in the boughs, and jackasses laughed from the  gaunt limbs of the tall dead trees. A few turns in the lane, a straight run for  a mile or two, and the cart containing Dad and Barty and the coffin swung on to  the main Warwick road, and soon Saddletop was left far behind.</p>
<p>As the sun rose  high in the sky and the day wore on, Dad and Barty began to meet people on the  way; some driving in traps, some in charge of drays, some on horseback, some on  foot with swags on their backs. And those whom Dad passed at a trotting pace  called out &ldquo;Good-day&rdquo; to him, and stared after the coffin which projected over  the front and back of the cart; and others whom he met when Prince was walking  steadily along getting his wind, seemed to take the cart for a funeral, and  looked very grave, and reverently removed their hats as they went by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it,&rdquo; Dad  would say, &ldquo;git up.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;d hit Prince with a switch to make him trot. Dad  didn&rsquo;t like to be the cause of deceiving or disappointing people.</p>
<p>Dad and Barty  camped out under the cart that night, and at noon next day arrived at their  destination. They took the horse out, and after examining the foot of a dozen  trees or more, and raking and scratching among the long grass and dead timber  for nearly an hour, discovered the &ldquo;flat stone,&rdquo; weather-worn and shattered  into several small pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it wer&rsquo;  here,&rdquo; Dad said triumphantly, gathering it up; then, after examining the spot  closely, &ldquo;the hole&rsquo;ill run this way (indicating the lay of the grave with a  movement of his hand), they always put them with their feet to the risin&rsquo; sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then while Barty  gathered wood, and made a fire, and boiled the billy, and made tea for the  dinner, Dad lifted the things out of the cart, and gave Prince a feed of corn  and chaff in the coffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t make a  bad feed box,&rdquo; Dad said, standing off admiringly, and watching the horse, and  Barty chuckled and dipped into the sack, and pulled out some provender for  their own meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; Dad  said, rising from the grass when they had finished dinner, &ldquo;let me see,&rdquo; and he  secured four short sticks, and stuck them in the ground to define the outline  of the grave, then took up a crowbar, and started sinking. Dad used the bar,  and grunted, and heaved up dirt and stones and things from the hole, until he  disappeared from sight in it&mdash;until he struck water. Then he climbed out of the  hole, and said some one must have been there sometime or other, and shifted the  flat stone.</p>
<p>Next morning Dad  started another hole, and he hadn&rsquo;t gone down more than four feet with it when he struck payable dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; he called out jubilantly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got  &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got &rsquo;er, Dad?&rdquo;  Barty answered, peering into the hole, and sharing his parent&rsquo;s joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put th&rsquo; bar  right through some of &rsquo;er, too,&rdquo; Dad replied, right through &rsquo;er neck.&rdquo; And he  proceeded to hand up the bones carefully to Barty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them in as I  give &rsquo;em to you,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the head . . . catch it.&rdquo; And he heaved up  a hideous-looking skull, which Barty caught, clutching it to his chest like  marking a football, and falling down on the heap of mullock with fright when he  saw it. Barty placed the skull in the coffin, and turned from it with a cold  shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two arms,&rdquo; Dad  cried, poking the ends of them at Barty. &ldquo;Fit them along the sides.&rdquo; Barty  handled them gingerly, and fitted them along the sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some more,&rdquo; and  Dad handed up a miscellaneous assortment. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dad jumped  out of the hole, and wiped the perspiration off himself, and for a moment gazed  on the contents of the coffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long shins she  have,&rdquo; he said philosophically, &ldquo;never thought she were so big.&rdquo; And he  gathered a quantity of dry grass and dead leaves, and proceeded to pack the  coffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to  leave the lid off till we get home,&rdquo; Dad said, and together they hoisted the  coffin into the cart, and secured it again with a rope. And when the tools and  baggage were collected, Dad yoked Prince up again, and started on the return  journey to Saddletop.</p>
<p>Another ideal  day, with a cool soft breeze blowing. As the cart rattled and rolled along past  ridge and rock, past bullock drays and silent deserted huts, through &ldquo;gallows&rdquo;  gates and mountain gaps, by silent scrubs and full lagoons, Dad, with his hat  tilted on the back of his head, and his long beard divided in the breeze, was in  a joyful mood. Every now and again he would lift his voice, and break into  song. Dad wasn&rsquo;t a trained singer, but he had a powerful voice. It only wanted  a limelight turned on Dad when he was singing, and you would think he was a  Niagara of Music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll camp here  to-night,&rdquo; Dad said when, about sundown, they arrived at Merrit&rsquo;s Crossing,  where there was a large waterhole with abundance of firewood.</p>
<p>They unharnessed  Prince, and while Barty looked after the fire, which he kindled beside a log,  and boiled the billy, Dad fed the horse.</p>
<p>Supper over they  stretched themselves on the grass, and lay in silence watching the stars, and  listening to the owls hooting among the timber, and the plovers crying round  the waterhole. And as the darkness grew thicker the night became eerie and  unearthly.</p>
<p>All at once Dad  rose to a sitting position, and stared into the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were that?&rdquo;  he said in hushed tones.</p>
<p>Barty hadn&rsquo;t seen  anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would a&rsquo; sworn  it were a woman,&rdquo; Dad murmured, &ldquo;an&rsquo; she come right out of the hole, and  flashed past, quite close!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barty felt his  hair rising, and stared round suspiciously at the coffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must a&rsquo; been  fancy,&rdquo; Dad said, after reflecting, and leaned back on his elbow again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might a&rsquo; been a  ghost,&rdquo; Barty whispered, apprehensively.</p>
<p>Dad chuckled  derisively. Dad didn&rsquo;t believe in ghosts&mdash; so he used to say.</p>
<p>They both lay  back in silence again.</p>
<p>Suddenly  footsteps were heard approaching, and from out the darkness a husky voice  called, &ldquo;&rsquo;Night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad made a jump.  Barty made one, too, and put his parent between himself and the cart and the  corpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo; afraid  o&rsquo; campin&rsquo; here?&rdquo; And a ragged, grey-bearded old traveller, with a swag on his  back, appeared in the light of the blazing fire.</p>
<p>Dad eyed the  intruder for a moment, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where th&rsquo; devil  did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From back there,&rdquo;  the traveller answered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, as he put down his  swag. &ldquo;Made twenty miles since mornin&rsquo;, and walked through a d&mdash; lot o&rsquo; Scotch  thistles and Bathurst burr, too, and ain&rsquo;t had a mouthful to eat all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty here,&rdquo;  Dad said, shoving the billy, half full of cold tea, and the bag containing the  provender, towards the ragged guest; &ldquo;help yourself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The derelict&rsquo;s  eyes glistened with gratitude, and taking out his pocket knife, he sat over the  bag and carved for himself. Then, with a heavy supply of bread and meat in one  hand, and a pint of tea in the other, he sat on the log and munched and talked  volubly. Several times he re-visited the bag, and armed himself with a fresh  supply, and when he had eaten enough to satisfy three men, and emptied the  billy, he took out an old pipe, lit it with a fire stick, and started smoking  like a bad fireplace.</p>
<p>After a while he  looked at Dad, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo; afraid  of seein&rsquo; Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s ghost here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad didn&rsquo;t  understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paddy Carey&rsquo;s  wife&mdash;she were murdered here&mdash;didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; know?&rdquo; he went on for Dad&rsquo;s information,  &ldquo;she were thrown in that hole. Lots o&rsquo; fellows has seen her ghost different  times o&rsquo; the night, and no one ever camps here for that reason. Think it hall  moonshine meself.&rdquo; And the grey-bearded one pulled hard at his pipe again.</p>
<p>Dad sat right up,  and stared about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that wer&rsquo;  th&rsquo; woman I see a while ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The traveller  suddenly stopped smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see her?&rdquo;  he asked, in low, hollow tones, and glided from the log, and got near the fire,  looking hard at Dad.</p>
<p>A cold shiver  came over Barty, and he crouched beside Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a woman, I  swear,&rdquo; Dad answered, &ldquo;but I never remember any being murdered here. Remember a  man being murdered at Grasstree&mdash;five mile from here&mdash;in the &rsquo;4o&rsquo;s, and Mrs.  Peterson, she were killed be th&rsquo; blacks th&rsquo; same week at Pikedale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that&mdash;I  remember &rsquo;er,&rdquo; the traveller said, &ldquo;she were a fine little woman she were, no  mistake, and many a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>big</i> woman, weren&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Dad  interrupted, thinking of the measurements of the contents of the coffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smallest  woman ever y&rsquo; see,&rdquo; the other answered confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are y&rsquo; certaint?&rdquo;  Dad asked concernedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sure</i> of it,&rdquo; the traveller said, peering  cautiously into the darkness. &ldquo;I see &rsquo;er many times drivin&rsquo; th&rsquo; sheep with  Peter, as we called th&rsquo; &rsquo;usband them days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you wuz  to see her again,&rdquo; Dad asked, &ldquo;would you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quicker&rsquo;n I&rsquo;d  know you.&rdquo; And the traveller stared nervously into the night again.</p>
<p>Dad rose, and  looked round, and seemed to hesitate. Then with an effort, he climbed into the  cart, and after fumbling in the coffin returned with the skull in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That her?&rdquo; he  said, poking the gruesome thing right under the traveller&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; the  traveller gasped, standing up, and backing away from Dad, &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s <i>her?</i>&rdquo; Dad repeated, holding it nearer to  him.</p>
<p>But the other  didn&rsquo;t wait to give Dad any opinion. He snatched up his swag, and bolted into  the night, and for several moments only the &ldquo;patter patter&rdquo; of his feet could  be heard on the still air as he hurried away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny fellow!&rdquo;  Dad mumbled, and climbed into the cart again.</p>
<p>He had just fixed  the skull in its place in the coffin when a couple of old pensioned-off milch  cows, that were running on the reserve, sauntered noiselessly up to the camp.  One of them poked her head into the light, and her big dreamy eyes, with the  fire shining on them, suddenly met Barty&rsquo;s. Barty sent up a loud yell, and  bounded to his feet, and Dad fell off the cart, and pulled the coffin down  after him, and emptied its contents all over himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil&rsquo;s  th&rsquo; matter with y&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dad gasped, scrambling excitedly to his feet, and staring  all round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was <i>lookin</i>&rsquo; at me,&rdquo; Barty answered, shuddering  and holding on to Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were?&rdquo; Dad  whispered hoarsely, looking all round again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! See it!&rdquo;  and Barty pointed with his finger.</p>
<p>Dad stared till  the object moved slightly, and again revealed the fire in its eye.</p>
<p>Dad whispered to  Barty to &ldquo;keep quiet,&rdquo; and, crouching down, armed himself with a heavy piece of  a gum tree. He stood up then, and stared again, his big heart all the time  thumping like a bullock&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Dad thought he  would give the enemy a chance, and with a terrible tremor in his voice, called  out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are <i>you?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no  answer, but the cow, in a casual way, moved forward to the fire, and flicked  her tail about, and put her foot in the empty billy, and her nose in the bread  bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m d&mdash;&rdquo;  Dad said, turning to Barty, &ldquo;is <i>thet</i> what frightened y&rsquo;&mdash;a cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it did you,&rdquo;  Barty chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pshaw!</i>&rdquo; Dad protested, &ldquo;how th&rsquo; deuce  were I to see from here?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad broke in and  silenced Barty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash; her!&rdquo; he  yelled, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s het all th&rsquo; bread!&rdquo; and he heaved the heavy piece of gum tree at  the brute, and she jumped through the fire, and made off with the billy-can on  her foot.</p>
<p>Dad swore  violently after her, and turned to the fallen coffin. And while Barty struck  matches, and held them up to make a light, Dad gathered the scattered remains,  and packed them in again. Then they hoisted the coffin back into the cart, and  drawing a tent fly over the vehicle, took their blankets, and crept in  underneath to sleep for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think was it a  woman, y&rsquo; saw the first time, Dad?&rdquo; Barty asked, when he was close beside his  parent, and his head well under the blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Dad  growled, &ldquo;go to sleep.&rdquo; Dad wasn&rsquo;t going to waste any more time on ghosts. And  while the wind sprang up and sobbed, and the tent-fly flapped, and the night  birds whooped, Dad and Barty both fell asleep.</p>
<p>They were  sleeping soundly when the old cows took it in their heads to return and poke  about again. They approached the fire first; then the fly that covered the cart  attracted their attention, and they sniffed at it. They got a taste of some  brine that had been spilled on it. They were fond of brine. Brine is beer to  cows. It was years since these cows had tasted brine. They started to lick it  off. It made them hungry. They chewed holes in the fly, and one of the brutes  put her head right in through one of them, and for a while contemplated the  sleeping form of Dad. Then she pressed her cold wet nose against his brow, and  breathed on him. Dad, with ghosts on his brain, woke with a big jump, and gave  the cow a great start. She tried to pull back, but her horns became fast in the  spokes of the wheel. Then she put out her tongue, and bellowed in Dad&rsquo;s ear,  and started dragging the cart about the reserve. Dad and Barty abandoned their  blankets in a great hurry, and escaped by the back way, and when Dad grasped  the situation he swore, and ran round, and groped for the heavy piece of gum  tree. His eyes rested on a half-burnt stick in the fire, and he picked it out,  and rushed at the struggling brute with it, and shoved the hot end against her  ribs, and hissed, &ldquo;You rubbish!&rdquo; and the air was filled with a round of wild  fearsome bellows that mingled with a strong smell of burning hair. The brute  didn&rsquo;t like the firestick. She kicked it out of Dad&rsquo;s hand, and reared up and  shoved the cart right over, and spilt the remains out of the coffin again, and  just when Dad was arriving with a fresh fire stick she got free, and made off  with the tent-fly hanging all over her. Swear! Dad did swear! It sounded like  sacrilege on the silent night. Then Barty and he put their shoulders to the  wheel, and righted the cart, and when they had gathered Mrs. Peterson together  again, and adjusted the coffin, it was nearly daylight.</p>
<p>As there was no  billy-can to make tea in, Dad wouldn&rsquo;t be bothered waiting for breakfast.  Breakfast without tea was purgatory to Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump up,&rdquo; he  said to Barty, when it broke day and the horse was harnessed to the cart, &ldquo;and  we&rsquo;ll be home be dinner time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barty climbed in,  and away they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad we didn&rsquo;t  have to come back without her,&rdquo; Dad said, casting a look of triumph at the &ldquo;loading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder will they  have a hole ready when we get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder will they  have th&rsquo; dinner ready?&rdquo; Barty mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on with  yer! <i>Git</i> <i>erp!</i>&rdquo; Dad shouted, whacking at the horse with the reins, as the  brute began to tire at the long stony pinches. But Prince got slower, and  slower and Dad grew tired of jerking at the reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that  switch?&rdquo; he said, groping in the bottom of the cart. But the switch had fallen  out somewhere.</p>
<p>Dad put his hand  in the coffin, and seized one of the shin bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git erp!&rdquo; he  shouted again, and struck Prince on the rump with the bone. Prince bounded into  the collar, and broke into a trot, and the bone broke into several pieces, and  fell between the shafts on to the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wa-ay!</i>&rdquo; Dad roared, &ldquo;<i>wa-ay!</i>&rdquo; and hauled Prince in again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; he  said, when Barty jumped down, and picked up the pieces. &ldquo;I thought her leg wer&rsquo;  stronger than that. Must have been cracked when she wer&rsquo; alive!&rdquo; And he placed  the shattered shin bone carefully back in the coffin.</p>
<p>Dad and Barty  reached home after dinner, and as they drove through the gate with the coffin  showing conspicuously in the cart, Mother and Sarah, who were in the yard  admiring the fowls, lifted their heads, then threw up their hands, and flew  inside. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bring it  in here,&rdquo; Mother cried, as Dad walloped the jaded horse right up to the front  steps. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bring it here. Take it away out of sight, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; Dad  said, &ldquo;must leave it somewhere till we get a fresh horse to take it to  Peterson, and get some dinner ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barty and Dad  jumped down and unharnessed Prince, and pulled the cart round, and blocked the  wheels, and rested the points of the shafts on the edge of the verandah, so as  the coffin wouldn&rsquo;t slip off, and empty itself again.</p>
<p>Then they sat  down to a late dinner, and Dad would have told Mother all about the trip, but  Mother made ugly faces at him, and held up her hands, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I don&rsquo;t  want to hear it, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill came  strolling in from the paddock, and greeted the undertakers with a broad grin,  and Dad sent him away to tell Peterson he wanted to see him.</p>
<p>In half an hour  Bill returned with Peterson. Peterson, in mourning clothes, was pale and  grave-looking, and sat on the sofa, and for a moment or two appeared to be  praying. Dad stared at him for a while, then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wer&rsquo; pretty  hard findin&rsquo; where she lay.&rdquo; And he proceeded to draw another plan on the  table, showing the gate and the &ldquo;crick&rdquo; and the position of the different graves  as he had found them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wer&rsquo; just  here,&rdquo; he concluded, stabbing a hole in the table.</p>
<p>Peterson looked  puzzled. He seemed unable to follow Dad. Dad got angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were three  under th&rsquo; tree, weren&rsquo;t ther&rsquo;?&rdquo; he thundered, thumping the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peterson  said quietly, shaking his head. &ldquo;<i>Two!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Dad  bellowed, &ldquo;there wer&rsquo; <i>three</i>, I tell y&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterson shook  his head again, adding apprehensively, &ldquo;Hope you haven&rsquo;t been to the wrong  place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Dad  shouted, rising to his feet, &ldquo;weren&rsquo;t one of your ol&rsquo; woman&rsquo;s shins sore one  time? Weren&rsquo;t one of &rsquo;em cracked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterson opened  his eyes, and stared hard at Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She only had <i>one</i> leg,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Dad&rsquo;s  turn to open his eyes then. He opened his mouth, too, and stared and gaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he  murmured, lowering his voice, and leaning towards Peterson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She only had <i>one</i> leg,&rdquo; Peterson repeated calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Dad  broke out, &ldquo;but the one I got have <i>two</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t my Mary,  then,&rdquo; Peterson murmured, dropping his eyes on the floor, &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t my Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad sat down, and  for some moments was speechless. Then suddenly he jumped up, and leaving the  room, went to the cart.</p>
<p>He returned with  the grinning skull in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that <i>&rsquo;er?</i>&rdquo; he said, thrusting the gruesome  thing at Peterson.</p>
<p>Mother and Sarah  nearly knocked each other over in their haste to leave the room.</p>
<p>Peterson jumped  up, and staggered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>blackfellow!</i>&rdquo; he muttered, eyeing the  head as if it would bite him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eer&mdash;w&mdash;<i>what?</i>&rdquo; Dad asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blackfellow!&rdquo;  Peterson said again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To th&rsquo; devil with  it, then,&rdquo; Dad yelled, and savagely heaved the skull through the door.</p>
<p>There was no  funeral and no burial. Dad took the coffin down the back-yard, and emptied it  calmly on the dust-heap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Dad and the Pigs</b></h2>
<p>Dad disregarded  our advice and went in heavily for pigs. He reckoned there was money in pigs,  and argued they would &ldquo;rise&rdquo; but he didn&rsquo;t say how. We wondered if he meant  they would fly.</p>
<p>Dad bred the  brutes for several years&mdash;bred till the sties couldn&rsquo;t hold them&mdash;till the yard  contained swine of all sorts and sizes. Black, white, brown, grey, sandy, and  piebald pigs&mdash;fat, sleepy pigs&mdash;poor pigs, scaly, scabby pigs, and pigs with  snouts like the nose of a smithy&rsquo;s bellows, roamed round at all hours raking  and rooting into every hole and corner of the place.</p>
<p>If a bucket, a  can, or a cask were left about anywhere, they&rsquo;d swarm round it, and fight for  its contents, if it contained anything, and when they had cleaned it out they  would roll it away somewhere and leave it. Pigs! The farm was overrun with the  rubbish! If a stranger approached the house on horseback, &rsquo;twas at the risk of  breaking his neck, for if his horse didn&rsquo;t fall over a heap of slumbering  swine, a family of suckers would start out noisily from some corner or other to  greet him, and make the animal bolt. Strangers always spoke disparagingly of  our pigs.</p>
<p>To remonstrate  with Dad was only waste of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a while,&rdquo;  he&rsquo;d say, confidently, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be valuable directly; they&rsquo;ll go up when this  new Government gets things into shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas wonderful  the faith Dad had in new Governments! Far more than he had in new braces or  boots. Of the new Government, we knew nothing; but we understood a lot about  Dad&rsquo;s pigs, and wished a flood would come and wash them all away. We were sick  of seeing them&mdash;weary of cursing the wretches; tired of throwing things at them,  and of hearing the Regans and others complain of their crops being rooted out  of the ground by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t y&rsquo; get  rid o&rsquo; them?&rdquo; Dave said to Dad one day, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d get six or seven shillings  a-piece for them, just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; Dad  answered&mdash;&ldquo;pigs&rsquo;ll be valuable directly, man; hold on awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We held on for  twelve months. Then the newspapers began to talk about pigs, and about a &ldquo;bacon  industry,&rdquo; till at last factories sprang up in the city, and agents came round  on the heels of each other buying up &ldquo;porkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came to Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dad  grunted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a few,&rdquo; and reluctantly parted with forty of them for &pound;100. He  just as reluctantly promised to have forty more ready in three months&rsquo; time.  Dave and Joe couldn&rsquo;t understand it. They said they had no idea pigs would ever  be worth anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Dad  answered, &ldquo;anyone with <i>brains</i> would  have known. It was clear enough t&rsquo; <i>me</i>.  I could see it years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave and Joe  smiled placidly. So much foresight on Dad&rsquo;s part was a novelty to them. </p>
<p>Pigs went up in  our estimation. We treated them with kindness and respect now. To disparage  their presence or heave a stone at them was as much as one&rsquo;s life was worth.</p>
<p>Dad spent a few  pounds in proper paling yards, and made extensive additions to the sties, and  as much care was bestowed on the pigs as on the dairy cows. All the wasters  were weeded out, boars of the best blood introduced, and breeding carried on  with care and discrimination.</p>
<p>When corn was  selling cheap in the markets, Dad gave every grain we grew to the pigs, and  every month, as regular as clock-work, sold a score or more, and pocketed  thirty and forty, and sometimes fifty pounds. Money! Dad was making heaps of  it.</p>
<p>Mother worried  Dad for a change of diet. Salt beef every day of the year, she reckoned, was  injurious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gets  sickening,&rdquo; she said, and Dad, after brooding over the matter for about three  months, decided to kill a pig. Killing a pig for our own use was a big  sacrifice for Dad to make. To him it was throwing good money away. But we were  ready to eat the lot of them.</p>
<p>We were to kill  the pig one Saturday, and from the excitement and preparations that were made  you would think there was to be a wedding.</p>
<p>A cask was  emptied and cleaned; the salting bench renovated and scrubbed; a huge fire  kindled in the yard beneath a boilerful of water, and the knives touched up on the  grindstone. When evening came all of us left work, and, headed by Dad carrying  the axe, proceeded to the sty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black one  with th&rsquo; white foot ought t&rsquo; do,&rdquo; Dad said, in answer to Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stun &rsquo;im,  then,&rdquo; Dave said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll <i>stick</i> &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t an  easy matter to stun the brute. All of them seemed seized with a presentiment of  evil, and when Dad entered the sty, they raced round in confusion, and fought  with each other. Dad couldn&rsquo;t get a hit in on the black one with the white  foot, at all. He knocked a piece of ear off one of the others, and roused its  ferocity.</p>
<p>Joe made a  suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; he  said to Dad, &ldquo;and stand off a yard or two; and when I fetch a dish of corn they&rsquo;ll  put their front feet on the top rail an&rsquo; look over. Then go up quietly, an&rsquo; y&rsquo;ll  get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad complied.</p>
<p>Joe went away and  returned with the corn. The pigs placed their front feet on the top rail, and  stared and clamoured as he approached.</p>
<p>Joe rattled the  corn to show there was no deception.</p>
<p>Dad became  excited. He gripped the axe, and moved stealthily by inches.</p>
<p>Dave grinned,  sitting on his haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Joe  said in a low tone, &ldquo;wait till I get a bit closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe stood within  a foot or two of the sty, and held the dish out invitingly. The pigs strained  to reach it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said,  turning the corners of his eyes round at Dad.</p>
<p>Dad stepped up  cautiously, and swung the axe with force enough to knock a house down. He hit  the black pig on its white foot. You never heard anything like the squeals that  came from that pig! It went fairly mad, and rushed about on three legs trying  to get out. Dad bounced into the sty with a determined look in his eye, and in  mistake struck an old boar hard on the back. There was commotion then!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out! look  out!&rdquo; Dave shouted. But it was too late. The old boar shoved his head between  the rails and burst the side of the sty away, and out they all rushed.</p>
<p>Joe pursued the  brute that Dad had maimed. So did Dave. The dogs took to the boar, and fell  over each other fighting for a hold of his ear. Dad swore and yelled at them to  desist.</p>
<p>Joe captured the  black pig with the white foot in the middle of the yard, and held on to his  hind legs barrow fashion.</p>
<p>The pig poked its  nose in the dirt, opened its mouth, and squealed appallingly. You&rsquo;d think it  knew it was to die. The cries of the brute drove Mother and Sarah into the  house with their fingers in their ears. Joe felt like a murderer. He was on the  verge of reprieving the animal when Dad rushed up waving the axe wildly. The  pig struggled in a circle, and fought for liberty. Dad aimed a heavy blow at  its forehead, and drove the axe up to the handle in the ground. He became  exasperated, and danced round excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take y&rsquo;r <i>time</i>,&rdquo; yelled Joe.</p>
<p>Dad missed again,  and sunk another hole in the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use th&rsquo; back&mdash;th&rsquo;  back,&rdquo; angrily from Joe.</p>
<p>Dad reversed  arms, swung again, and this time the pig went out.</p>
<p>Then there was  confusion. Success depended on prompt and proper bleeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; knife, <i>quick</i>,&rdquo; Joe cried, placing a foot on the  neck of the fallen, and holding out his hand.</p>
<p>Dad jumped round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;re th&rsquo; <i>knives?</i>&rdquo; he roared to Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> had them,&rdquo; Dave answered, looking  anxiously about, &ldquo;what did y&rsquo; <i>do</i> with  them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Damn</i> it!&rdquo; and Dad ran toward the sties.</p>
<p>Joe called  inquiringly to Sarah.</p>
<p>Dad kicked the  earth up near the sties, threw his arms about, and yelled more profanity.</p>
<p>Dave rushed away  to search the kitchen.</p>
<p>Mother called out  that she &ldquo;saw father with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once Joe  became engaged in a new struggle. The pig recovered, jumped up, and filled the  air with his screams again.</p>
<p>Dad ran back  calling out, &ldquo;Hold &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe held him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo;  Dave cried, having discovered the knives&mdash;&ldquo;y&rsquo; left them on the post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dad&rsquo;s  attention was all on the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give the axe t&rsquo;  Dave,&rdquo; Joe shouted, holding the animal by the hind legs again.</p>
<p>Dad sparred  murderously with the weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>now!</i>&rdquo; Joe jerked out&mdash;&ldquo;while he&rsquo;s quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then down came  the axe, and once more the pig was silenced.</p>
<p>Joe seized the  long knife, and probed and poked till the brute was bled successfully, and it  was almost dark when we dragged its form across the yard, and spread it on the  bench that Dad had prepared.</p>
<p>Dad yelled for a  light. Sarah brought one. Then we rushed about, procured buckets, and poured  gallons of hot water on the hog, scalded it from head to foot&mdash;and it never  flinched!</p>
<p>And while Mother  and Sarah stood round holding lighted candles, Dad took an old knife, and Dave  and Joe the lids of saucepans, and the three of them scraped till there wasn&rsquo;t  a hair left on any part of that pig.</p>
<p>When it was  dressed and hung up you wouldn&rsquo;t have known it&mdash;it made a lovely corpse, smooth  and white as marble, except in patches where Dad had bruised it with the axe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine bit o&rsquo;  pork,&rdquo; Dad said, holding up a candle and eyeing the carcass closely&mdash;&ldquo;plenty of  bacon now for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we collected  the knives and the buckets and the saucepan lids, tied the dogs up, cleaned  ourselves, and went inside and had tea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  Sarah&rsquo;s Gold Watch</b></h2>
<p>Dad went to town,  and came home with several black puddings in his pocket, and a gold watch and  chain packed in a small cardboard box, which he presented to Sarah&mdash;the gold  watch and chain, not the black puddings.</p>
<p>It was a great  surprise to Sarah. Her eyes shone like stars, and her breath nearly left her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me!&rdquo; she  cried, &ldquo;for <i>me!</i>&rdquo; and danced round the  dining room flashing the gold before the eyes of the rest of us. We got a  surprise, too; but it affected us differently to Sarah. Somehow, it didn&rsquo;t  bring us the same joy that it brought her; we didn&rsquo;t share her delight in the  matter at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; did y&rsquo; buy  that for &rsquo;er?&rdquo; Bill asked of Dad, in sulky tones of disapproval, and frowning  heavily on his sister.</p>
<p>Dad ignored Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful with  it; be <i>careful!</i>&rdquo; Dad yelled, as  Sarah, attempting to open the lid, almost dropped the timepiece on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind don&rsquo;t break  it, now,&rdquo; Mother put in smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at &rsquo;er,&rdquo;  Bill sneered, &ldquo;she dersn&rsquo;t even know which end to open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill never  possessed a watch himself, but it was wonderful how much he knew about watches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show it to me,  girl,&rdquo; Dad said, reaching for the costly time o&rsquo; day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah trembled  excitedly, and hesitated. Sarah wasn&rsquo;t quite sure if the watch could be safely  entrusted to Dad. Dad got impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it,  girl,&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;let me <i>see</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&mdash;don&mdash;don&rsquo;t  let it <i>fall</i>, then,&rdquo; Sarah gasped,  handing it over reluctantly to her parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Damn</i> it!&rdquo; Dad yelled, &ldquo;do you think I  never had the thing in my hand before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;but&mdash;Oo!  Oo! don&rsquo;t <i>drop</i> it.&rdquo; And Sarah, with  both hands raised, and her fingers working nervously, shepherded Dad round the  room.</p>
<p>Dad groaned  wisely, and moved to the door to commence operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There y&rsquo; are,&rdquo;  he said triumphantly as he forced open the front of the case with his big blunt  thumb. &ldquo;See? You open that one when you want to see the time and this one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad contorted his  features as if he had suddenly been attacked with appendicitis, and levered  hard at the back of the case, but his thumb-nail was too thick, and kept  slipping off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce take  it! It opened alright when he gave it to me.&rdquo; Dad&rsquo;s thumb-nail slipped again,  and rattled the watch; and Sarah squealed and clutched at his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away!&rdquo; Dad  bellowed&mdash;&ldquo;how th&rsquo; deuce can I do it if you won&rsquo;t let me alone.&rdquo; And he swung  away, and turned his back on Sarah.</p>
<p>Sarah fluttered  round Dad, and faced him again with her hands up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a table  knife,&rdquo; Dad said in a determined voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo;  Sarah whined, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll break it on me; give it back, and I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&rdquo; And  she clutched Dad&rsquo;s coat sleeve again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! to th&rsquo; devil  with it,&rdquo; Dad broke out in disgust, &ldquo;take it away,&rdquo; and he shoved the watch  into Sarah&rsquo;s hand again, and went and sat down, and started reading the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> a <i>goat</i>,&rdquo;  Bill sneered, eyeing Sarah enviously.</p>
<p>But Sarah  rejoiced. She snapped the cardboard off the table, and hurried to her room,  where she remained for hours examining and admiring her jewellery. She might  have stayed there admiring it till now, only that Joe, who had just come in,  strolled along to her door, and asked permission to gaze on the priceless  present. Sarah invited him in, and Joe admired the treasure, and said it was &ldquo;all  right.&rdquo; Joe was an unselfish brother. He handled and fondled the jewellery  delicately too, and wondered how it would look on him. Sarah smiled a pleased  smile, and adjusted the long chain round Joe&rsquo;s neck, and inserted the watch in  his pocket, and told him to look at himself in the glass. Sarah put a lot of confidence  in Joe. Joe looked at himself in the glass, and grinned. Then, without giving  Sarah any warning, he suddenly turned, and bolted out the door. Sarah screamed  and rushed after him. Joe clumsily bounded into the dining-room door just when  Dad was coming out to sit on the verandah, and knocked Dad backwards, and Dad  sat on the floor. Joe sat on the floor, too; and they faced each other. </p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash; y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Dad  roared, glaring at Joe, &ldquo;what th&rsquo; deuce do you mean, feller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while Dad  reviled Joe, who sat grinning apologetically, Sarah rescued her valuables, and  disappeared again in triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks more  of that watch than you do of the farm,&rdquo; Mother said, one day, when speaking to  Dad of Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she had  better take care of it,&rdquo; Dad remarked threateningly, &ldquo;for she&rsquo;ll never get  another.&rdquo; Then he went down the paddock to witness an alleged well-sinker  manipulating a divining rod. Dad didn&rsquo;t believe in divining rods much himself,  but Dave believed in them all the way. Dad, in fact, didn&rsquo;t know what a divining  rod was &mdash;neither did Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that lump o&rsquo;  stick,&rdquo; said Dad, pessimistically, when the expert, who had an artesian flow of  language, explained all about &ldquo;geology&rdquo; and &nbsp;&ldquo;subterranean streams,&rdquo; and &ldquo;branch streams&rdquo;,  and &ldquo;junctions &rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;will point out exactly where water is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my hands it  will,&rdquo; the man answered confidently, &ldquo;and furthermore, if there&rsquo;s water  anywhere about here, sir, it will take me to it, and past it I won&rsquo;t be able to  go&mdash; not a step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk sense,&rdquo; Dad  said, &ldquo;do you think I haven&rsquo;t got any intelligence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man grinned  and wagged his head, and talked a lot more about geology, and said Dad was like  everybody else. &ldquo;Because y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t understan&rsquo; a thing yourself,&rsquo;&rsquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;you  think by that that no one else do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad showed  symptoms of fight, but Dave threw oil on him. Dave said calmly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give the chap a  chance; he might be able to do it &rsquo;orright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go ahead,  then,&rdquo; Dad said, cooling down, &ldquo;find some water here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expert  grasped the prongs of a fork stick that he had cut from our willow tree, and  holding it out before him started off at a trot. We all followed him with broad  grins on our faces. We cheerfully approved of the presence of that water  diviner in our paddock. He was as good as a holiday to us. Every now and then  he would stop to call Dave&rsquo;s attention to the antics of the magic wand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how it&rsquo;s  trying to point downwards?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say, and clenching his teeth he&rsquo;d strain hard  to prevent the willow stick from turning in his hands. And Dave would gape and  answer, &ldquo;Yairs! by jove, yairs.&rdquo; There was no doubt about Dave&rsquo;s belief in the  divining rod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A branch stream  here,&rdquo; the man said, pausing; then off he went again in search of the other  branch. All at once he stopped dead; he was suddenly pulled up, and he wriggled  and screwed and contorted his face, and stamped his feet, in wild frantic  efforts to control the piece of willow. We began to feel apprehensive. We  thought some kind of a fit was coming on him, and that we might have to tie him  down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other branch  stream is here,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t let me cross, but I&rsquo;ll foller it up to  the junction, and get on the main creek.&rdquo; And away he went some more.</p>
<p>We were amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By crikey, he&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; Dave enthused, and followed at the magician&rsquo;s elbow. Dave now  believed in water spiritualism more than ever.</p>
<p>The diviner  zig-zagged along, following the bends of the creek, now and again pausing to  pass carefully over a waterfall, until he got right back to the spot where Dad  was standing. And somehow when within a few yards of Dad he lost the scent, the  water ran out, and the stick went limp, and refused to take any further  interest in its work. The diviner frowned. He looked baffled, and began to  think hard, and study the surroundings.</p>
<p>Dad laughed  discouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By crikey, then,&rdquo;  Dave mumbled in undertones full of faith and assurance, &ldquo;you should have seen  the job he had to hold it, back there, when he struck the branch of a creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad laughed more,  and said to Dave&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just as  big a fool as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dad chuckled  to himself, and looked about the paddock for a while.</p>
<p>Suddenly he  exhibited some enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said,  addressing the diviner and pointing to a green bush beside some new land that  the men were breaking up, &ldquo;try over that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expert moved  in the direction indicated, and Dad, with a broad smile, followed him closely.</p>
<p>The diviner  brushed the green bush with his trouser-leg and a swarm of yellow butterflies  flew up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think there&rsquo;s  any?&rdquo; Dad asked, hurrying along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo;  the expert answered, and continued his course without looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t?&rdquo;  And Dad lifted a bucket of water that the men were using for drinking purposes,  from the green bush. &ldquo;Well, what do you call that, then?&rdquo; And he heaved the  contents of the vessel over the diviner, and washed his hat away, and wet all  his whiskers.</p>
<p>The diviner for a  moment lost his breath; he seemed to think he had fallen through the ground  into a waterfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; he  gasped, then jumped round and glared, and threw off like a whale at Dad. And  for a while he looked as if he would assault Dad with the piece of willow tree.  But Dad, armed with the empty bucket, was an ugly-looking foe, and the expert  changed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice  thing to do!&rdquo; he whined, wringing his wet beard with his hand, and jerking the  water from his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away with  you, man,&rdquo; Dad answered, waving the bucket about, &ldquo;be off, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t be playing  the fool here any longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stared,  and Dad turned away, and strode back to the house.</p>
<p>That afternoon  Dad was searching the sitting-room for a letter from the Divisional Board  Office that he had left there, and came upon Sarah&rsquo;s gold watch and chain lying  on the round table. Sarah had taken it off after returning from a visit to Mrs.  Gray, and placed it there while she ran out to give the woman, whom Mother had  employed to assist in the house work, a hand to bring in the clothes.</p>
<p>Dad was in a  playful mood that afternoon, and a humorous idea took possession of him. He  lifted the watch with a grin, dropped it into the pocket of his old mole-skins,  and went on searching for his letter. He failed to find the letter though, and  his fit of good humour suddenly vanished. He went out on to the back verandah,  and yelled and stormed at Mother. Mother put aside her work, and flew round,  and turned everything upside down, but without any success.</p>
<p>Sarah came along,  and joined in the hunt, and turned everything over again that Mother had  tumbled about,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not  anywhere here,&rdquo; they both said, ceasing operations, and looking nervously at  Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it had been  left where I put it,&rdquo; Dad bellowed, tossing more things about, &ldquo;it <i>would</i> be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>was</i> it that you left it?&rdquo; Sarah rejoined  humbly</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>was</i> it?&rdquo; from Dad, with great violence. &ldquo;Where  th&rsquo; devil do you think it was? Do you think I can tell you?&rdquo; And in disgust Dad  hobbled out into the yard, and left Mother and Sarah to renew the search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s got it  stuck about him, somewhere,&rdquo; Sarah said, giving the matter up. &ldquo;He never knows  where he puts a thing half a moment after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mother was  proceeding calmly to agree with Sarah, when the latter suddenly turned pale,  and began fingering and fumbling the front of her blouse. She darted into the  sitting room, then hurried to her own room, and returned to Mother, looking  several points paler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost me  watch!&rdquo; she said, staring at Mother.</p>
<p>It was Mother&rsquo;s  turn to go pale now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, <i>never!</i>&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>have!</i>&rdquo; Sarah gasped in turn.</p>
<p>Then placing her  palm to her forehead she walked round the room thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy I can remember  taking it off when I came back,&rdquo; she murmured, pausing and looking  interrogatively at Mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you  did.&rdquo; And Mother started to think, too. &ldquo;And you put it on one of the  tables&mdash;either this one (they were in the dining-room) or on the one in there  (indicating the round table in the sitting-room.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo;  Sarah broke out, &ldquo;now I remember,&rdquo; and burst into the sitting-room again, and  once more turned everything inside out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ugly suspicion  entered Sarah&rsquo;s mind, but she hesitated before voicing it to Mother.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who&rsquo;s been  in the sitting-room, altogether?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Mother reflected,  but made no reply. Mother was always a just and cautious woman.</p>
<p>Sarah answered  the question herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman was  in for the tea-things,&rdquo; she said, eyeing Mother like the foreman of a jury when  he&rsquo;s announcing a verdict of &ldquo;guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your <i>father</i>,&rdquo; Mother said, with emphasis;  then instantly added, &ldquo;but <i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t touch it; and you had better not let him know it&rsquo;s lost either, till  you find it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sarah didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For days Mother  and Sarah searched and re-searched the house and yards from end to end for the  watch, and in confidence Joe and Dave and the rest of us were interrogated on  the matter and sworn to silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman&rsquo;s got  it,&rdquo; Sarah said one day, with large tears in her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she has, from  the way she goes about, and I&rsquo;m going to ask her to give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t do  any good,&rdquo; Joe argued, counselling his sister, &ldquo;not a bit o&rsquo; good. She&rsquo;d only  drop it down the well if you do, to get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah shuddered  at the thought, and shed more tears. &ldquo;The best thing to do,&rdquo; Joe went on, &ldquo;is  to tell Fitzgibbon about it, and let him get it from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon was a  wise constable, stationed at the township.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about  Dad?&rdquo; Sarah whined apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him all  about it, of course&mdash;but not until the policeman&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; Joe said.</p>
<p>Sarah, after a  while, approved of the suggestion, and Joe rode into the township, and  interviewed Constable Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know her,&rdquo; Mr.  Fitzgibbon said, before Joe had hardly told him anything, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re a d&mdash; bad  lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Joe  returned and repeated the bobby&rsquo;s words to Mother and Sarah they wanted to sit  up all night, and keep an eye on the woman, lest she might steal more things or  murder some of us.</p>
<p>On the following  day Fitzgibbon rode up to our place, and was barked at by the dogs, and  received hospitably by Dad, and invited inside by Mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what brings  you up this way?&rdquo; Dad asked. And while Mother and Sarah became restless and  turned different colours, and stared through the windows and door, the  policeman with the aid of his notebook, began to explain the object of his  visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whaht!</i>&rdquo; Dad yelled, and jumped to his  feet, and raged round the room, and would have rushed off to throw the woman  out of the house, only the policeman held him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just leave her  to me, Mr. Rudd,&rdquo; Fitzgibbon said with great emphasis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix her.&rdquo; And he  seated himself again, and sat back in his chair with the air of a Supreme Court  judge, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning to  Dad&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep patient  now, and leave her to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah called the  woman, and, in fear and trembling, the unfortunate creature stood staring from  one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, young  woman&rdquo; (she was about forty-nine), the Law said, &ldquo;Miss Rudd&rsquo;s gold watch have  been stolen from this r-room, and from infor-rmation received&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud hysterical  squeal came from the woman, and down she fell in a dead faint and a limp heap  on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lorrd! Oh,  Lorrd.!&rdquo; the Bobby cried, and picked the &ldquo;case&rdquo; up in his arms, and called out  for water.</p>
<p>Sarah, in her  excitement, brought in a jug of milk which Dad seized, and splashed into the  face of the helpless victim, and made a mess of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good Lorrd!&rdquo;  the bobby groaned, when he saw flakes of cream floating about, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t  warrter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,  it&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Dad said, soaking it up, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman came  round, but as soon as she opened her eyes, and saw the bobby looking down on  her, she squealed some more, and went off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come to,  quicker,&rdquo; Fitzgibbon said, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m not here. I&rsquo;ll come back to-morrow, and  conclude the investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t  come back. He wasn&rsquo;t required any more. Joe rode in and told him how Dad had  changed his pants and found the missing jewellery&mdash;and then remembered all about  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Fitzgibbon said, &ldquo;did ever ye hear of such an old fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Sarah&rsquo;s Courtship</b></h2>
<p>When Dad kicked  Billy Bearup out our door, and broke up a dance with him, and some days later  chased him through the sliprails at the point of a loaded gun, Billy didn&rsquo;t  come back to see Sarah any more&mdash;at least not while Dad was about. But whenever  Dad was away somewhere, Billy would turn up in clean clothes and a broad smile.  How Billy could tell when Dad was to be absent from home we never could  understand; it was a mystery to us. &ldquo;Intuition&rdquo; Joe suggested one day, when we  were discussing Billy and Sarah at the plough. But Tom suspected Sarah herself.  &ldquo;She lets him know,&rdquo; he said. Bill discredited Tom&rsquo;s theory. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bill said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been there when he&rsquo;s come along and she&rsquo;s alluz been more surprised to see him  than anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; Joe  sniggered,&mdash; &ldquo;<i>She</i> surprised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe was an  authority on girls and their funny little ways. Joe courted a girl once  himself&mdash;courted her hard and earnestly for two years&mdash;courted her until she  accepted a ring and a side-saddle from him&mdash;and got married to another fellow.</p>
<p>Time went by and  Sarah became discontented. She grew bad tempered, too, and made the place  miserable. She complained bitterly to Mother one evening of Dad&rsquo;s inhospitable  attitude towards Billy; said she couldn&rsquo;t see why Billy shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to  come to the house like anyone else, and shed a lot of big tears over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s going  to come,&rdquo; she blubbered desperately, &ldquo;and if father dares to say another word  to him or does anything against him again I&rsquo;ll go away&mdash;I&rsquo;ll leave home&mdash; I&mdash;won&rsquo;t  stay in the place&mdash;I won&rsquo;t put up with it, I won&rsquo;t, I&mdash;<i>won&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, child,&rdquo;  Mother said kindly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be a foolish girl. I&rsquo;ll speak to your father about  it, and I&rsquo;m sure he won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mother was  always as good as her word. She went straight away and spoke to Dad.</p>
<p>Dad was sitting  on the verandah reading the paper when Mother started to speak to him. Before  she had finished he was standing on tiptoes glaring at her like an infuriated  old man kangaroo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he  roared, &ldquo;<i>Never!</i> To th&rsquo; devil with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother came away  from Dad and sought Sarah again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it be for  a while,&rdquo; she whispered nervously, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll see him to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah left it for  a while&mdash;left it for months. Mother left it altogether.</p>
<p>Dad went to town  one morning intending to stay there a couple of days. He was barely out of  sight when Billy Bearup rode up to the house and sat on his horse talking to  Sarah. Sarah was pleased to see Billy, and asked him if wasn&rsquo;t he going to get  off.&rdquo; Billy looked at the sun and said he thought he&rsquo;d hardly have time to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to go all  the way down to Peterson&rsquo;s Pocket yet,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;looking for a couple of  steers we lost.&rdquo; Then Billy looked down along the road that Dad had taken, and  satisfied that Dad was well out of sight, dismounted and fastened his horse to  the front palings and followed Sarah inside. After a while the sun and the lost  steers went out of Billy&rsquo;s mind, and he waited for dinner. He waited till the  afternoon. He lounged about the house, sometimes talking to Mother, but more often  to Sarah. At intervals Mother would look out of the door, and noticing the  unfortunate horse standing in the broiling sun, stamping holes in the earth  with his hoofs, and flick-flicking at the flies with his bit of a tail, would  invite Billy to put the animal in the stable and give him a feed; and Billy  would drawl, &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s orright, Mrs. Rudd, I&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; in a minute, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About three  o&rsquo;clock Mother left Bill and Sarah together in the dining room, and said she&rsquo;d  go and do some ironing. Mother had no ironing to do; it had all been done the  day before. But Mother was always considerate where young people were  concerned. Mother had been young herself once. And Billy and Sarah when Mother  departed were sitting far apart. Several chairs and a corner of the table  divided them. But distance didn&rsquo;t lend any enchantment to Billy&rsquo;s view of  Sarah. It only made him uncomfortable. It made Sarah uncomfortable, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s big  geraniums,&rdquo; Billy said, drawing Sarah&rsquo;s attention to some withered flowers that  had been standing in a vase on the table for nearly a week. Any other time  Billy wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted words on the finest flowers that ever grew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they  pretty?&rdquo; Sarah answered, jumping out of her chair and leaning on the table, and  tenderly fingering the drooping geraniums as though she really admired them.  Billy left his chair and leaned on the table, too, and fingered the geraniums.  He also fingered Sarah&rsquo;s hair caressingly. And when Sarah didn&rsquo;t mind, Billy  stole his arm quietly round her waist and squeezed her, and made her sigh; and  his cheek rested against hers, and he was murmuring things to her when a heavy  footstep was heard ascending the front verandah steps. And a voice said,  &ldquo;Hello, Rowdy,&rdquo; in greeting to the dog. Billy and Sarah suddenly separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; Sarah  gasped, jumping round and shoving Billy from her.</p>
<p>Pen couldn&rsquo;t  describe the look that came into Billy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I get  out?&rdquo; he gasped, dancing round the table.</p>
<p>There were only  two ways for Billy to get out, one through the door leading into Mother&rsquo;s  bedroom, the other through the door leading into Dad&rsquo;s open arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the  table&mdash;quick,&rdquo; Sarah said, seeing Billy hesitate.</p>
<p>But Billy had no  courage or presence of mind when in a tight place; he had no courage or  presence of mind when in any kind of place. He darted at the door leading to  Mother&rsquo;s room and threw it open, and rushed recklessly in. Mother was in the  room. She was changing her clothes. She got a great start, and screamed. Billy  got a great start, too, when he saw Mother, and rushed out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The table&mdash;the  table,&rdquo; Sarah gasped again.</p>
<p>But Billy was  deaf and blind and furious. His wild, staring eyes rested on the open door and  on the form of Dad pausing on the mat to pat the dog. He bounded for the door.  Dad at the same moment turned from the dog, and his burly form blocked the way.  Billy didn&rsquo;t hesitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whaht?</i>&rdquo; Dad roared, recognising Billy as  the latter bore down upon him, &ldquo;<i>You</i> here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a  great thud. Billy went for Dad, low; dived between his legs, and knocked him  out on to the verandah. Dad got a great surprise, and yelled and clutched for  Billy; but Billy slipped through Dad&rsquo;s arms and bounded down the steps, and  mounting the horse, galloped away. Dad got up off his back and bellowed, and,  throwing bad language about, rushed inside to procure the gun. But before he  could drag the weapon from its place on the wall Billy had disappeared over the  horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot him  yet&mdash;th&rsquo;d&mdash;scoundrel,&rdquo; Dad raved, putting the weapon away again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot him  like a wallaby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sarah in her  room, hiding behind the curtains of her bed, trembled like a leaf, and broke  out into large lumps of perspiration.</p>
<p>Three months  passed away.</p>
<p>Dad, walking  under the clothes line one day after Sarah had hung out the washing, picked up  a piece of notepaper with writing and perfume on it. Dad turned the paper over  and over, and looked at the address and signature, then frowned fiercely on it.  &ldquo;Th&rsquo; devil,&rdquo; he muttered, and went on to the verandah, and, sitting in an easy  chair, began to spell through the curious document.</p>
<p><i>My dearest, sweatest Sara</i> (it said), <i>it&rsquo;s foar nites sins we seen  each uther, and I&rsquo;m longen to see you once moare. Meet me after supper too nite  deer at the wite gait. Doant forget; doent disuppoin me. When do the ole chap  go off some plaise agen.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; Dad broke  out, growing interested, &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; Then he continued to spell:</p>
<p><i>I ope the ole bare stays away altogether nex time.</i> (Dad grew very red in the face.) <i>Giv the ole dog me luv.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash; his  insolence,&rdquo; Dad snorted.</p>
<p><i>an&rsquo; take the saime yerself, and doant forget to be at the  gait to meat your trooest Billy. &rsquo;Ow did yer like me fofo I sent you.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The d&mdash;  scoundrel,&rdquo; Dad said, savagely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet him&mdash;I&rsquo;ll meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, muttering  murderous threats, Dad made his way to the clothes-line again, and threw Sarah&rsquo;s  love letter down where he had found it, and went away swearing to himself. He  had scarcely left the spot when Sarah, bareheaded, and rummaging her dress  pockets, came running out with an anxious look on her face. You would think she  had just received word that some bank in which she had a million of money  deposited had failed. With her eyes fixed on the ground, she tracked herself to  the barn and back, then to the woodheap, and to the water-tank, and back to the  barn again.</p>
<p>Dad scowled, and  watched Sarah out of the corner of his eye. Sarah crossed the yard several  times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s th&rsquo;  matter with y&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dad growled at last. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dropped an old  brooch somewhere, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Sarah murmured, colouring to the ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe  it wer&rsquo; y&rsquo; head,&rdquo; and Dad turned away. But he looked round again just in time  to see Sarah pounce on the paper, and stuff it hurriedly into her bosom.</p>
<p>Sarah had supper  ready early for us that night, and displayed a lot of anxiety to get the meal  over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up and let  me get cleared away,&rdquo; she said, when Bill and Tom hung over their tea arguing  about horses; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a lot of work to do to-night&mdash;and you haven&rsquo;t anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad looked hard  at Sarah and said nothing. And when everyone had finished, Sarah rushed the things  away to the kitchen, and starting to sing and whistle alternately, waded in to  the washing-up.</p>
<p>After supper Dad  walked up and down the verandah for a long while thinking hard. Then he called  Barty, and told him to go and find the greenhide whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want  it for, Dad?&rdquo; Barty asked, arriving with a short heavy &ldquo;slogger&rdquo; belonging to  Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,  never mind; leave it there.&rdquo; And Dad walked up and down some more.</p>
<p>Barty threw the  whip on a chair and went off wondering. Then Dad stepped quietly off the  verandah, and armed with the greenhide &ldquo;slogger&rdquo; sauntered down towards the  white gate.</p>
<p>There was a cold  easterly wind blowing. The moon came up over the great dividing range like a  huge ball of fire, and the dogs barked and howled dismally at it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Possums squawked  in the box trees that fringed the corn paddock, and flying foxes on noiseless  wings circled round and round the garden. The big white gate creaked on its  hinges and opened wide, and someone came through it leading a horse. Dad paused  for a moment to listen, then, grasping the greenhide, firmly hurried forward.  The horse&rsquo;s rump was turned towards Dad; the person leading the animal turned  to fasten the gate. At Dad&rsquo;s approach the horse twisted nervously about and  pulled on the reins. The man left the gate, and held firmly to the bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;scoundrel! I&rsquo;ve  got you now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad exclaimed,  bringing the greenhide down on the man&rsquo;s face, head, and shoulders with a &ldquo;swish!  swish! swish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The affrighted  animal pulled violently away and galloped off. A roar that surprised and  startled Dad came from the man. Then a round of heavy blows rained on Dad, and  next moment there was a struggle on the grass. Dad did all the struggling. Dad  was underneath. Sarah came stealthily upon the scene, and staring through the  pallid light called timidly: &ldquo;Is that you, Willie?&rdquo; But when oaths mingled with  sounds of violence were the only replies she received, she took alarm and fled  back to the house. Billy Bearup came cantering along down the lane and pulled  up at the gate. Heavy kicks and gurgling and stifled cries of &ldquo;Murder! Robber!  Coward!&rdquo; surprised him, and wheeling round he put spurs to his horse, and broke  his appointment with Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who th&rsquo; devil  are you, you crawler?&rdquo; the man gasped, squeezing Dad&rsquo;s throat&mdash;&ldquo;Speak or I&rsquo;ll  strangle you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad gurgled out  his identity, and the man, who was big Andy Daley, the butcher from Crawley&rsquo;s  Crossing, coming to pay Dad a cheque for some bullocks, exclaimed: &ldquo;Good  heavens!&rdquo; and jumped off Dad, and pulled him to his feet, and stared into his  bruised face. &ldquo;Why, what in th&rsquo; name&mdash;(here he panted and puffed)&mdash;What th&rsquo; deuce  did you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while Dad  staggered about in the moonlight like a drunken man till he got his wind. Then  he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;them!&rdquo; Daley  said, rubbing one of his eyes which Dad had nearly cut out with the whip; &ldquo;I  wish they&rsquo;d made their appointment somewhere else.&rdquo; And Dad agreed with Daley,  and sat down on the grass and spat some teeth out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s years ago  since then, and Dad never bothers-about Billy Bearup now. Neither does Sarah.  Billy went to see Nellie Thompson one Sunday, and Sarah gave him up.</p>

  The Rifle Range</b></h2>
<p>All the single  men of Saddletop, and a large percentage of the married ones, gathered at the  local public-house one evening to form a rifle club. It was an enthusiastic  gathering. The publican &ldquo;shouted&rdquo; all round, and the club promised to be a  great success. Officers were appointed, and all that remained to be settled was  the selection of a suitable range. There was only one locality in the district  that they knew of where a rifle could be discharged with safety, and that was  on private property. And the property belonged to Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a  lovely range,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;if we could only get it,&rdquo; and they looked  questioningly at one another.</p>
<p>The publican, who  was chairman, interrogated Dave with a long steady stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might get it,&rdquo;  Dave said, slowly, &ldquo;he might give it to you.&rdquo; Dave was thinking of Dad. Dave  never made rash promises where Dad&rsquo;s approval was required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the  old man would let us have it if we asked him?&rdquo; the publican said, in the voice  of a man who wanted something definite to go on.</p>
<p>Dave wasn&rsquo;t quite  sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you strike  the old devil in the humour he was in the other morning when Charley Roebuck  asked him for the loan of a harrow,&rdquo; Tommy Regan put in, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll chase you right  off the premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meeting  laughed merrily at Regan, also at Dave, who stroked his beard, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll  approach him for one,&rdquo; the publican said, &ldquo;if some of you&rsquo;ll come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me, anyway,&rdquo;  firmly from Regan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the hospital once; that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meeting  laughed some more at Regan, and Dave changed colour, and became restless.</p>
<p>Finally, the  schoolmaster volunteered to accompany the publican when school would be out  next day, and the meeting dispersed.</p>
<p>The dogs barked,  and rushed to the gate. Sarah went to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr. Brown  and Mr. Rice,&rdquo; she said, addressing Dad.</p>
<p>Dad rose from the  couch in the dining room, and, with a groan, met them at the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay  very long, Mr. Rudd,&rdquo; the publican said, in reply to Dad&rsquo;s invitation to step  inside. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve come to see you about is just this: We&rsquo;ve started a bit of  a rifle club down at the township, and your sons are joining it like the rest  of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whaht!</i>&rdquo; Dad interrupted, suddenly, &ldquo;my  sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just  a quiet little club,&rdquo; the publican resumed, &ldquo;to give us a little practice with  the rifle&mdash;there&rsquo;s no expense much attached to it, Mr. Rudd, or anything like  that&mdash;but our greatest trouble in getting it going is that we haven&rsquo;t a piece of  ground to make a suitable range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publican  paused, and looked hopefully at Dad.</p>
<p>Dad looked at the  schoolmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a  piece of Government ground in the district at all suitable,&rdquo; the schoolmaster  began, &ldquo;and we thought, Mr. Rudd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we  thought,&rdquo; the publican broke in again, &ldquo;that you might let us have the use&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whaht</i>?&rdquo; Dad bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of your  paddock,&rdquo; the publican concluded, moving back a pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I  want my horses and cattle shot?&rdquo; Dad yelled, and turned to go inside.</p>
<p>The publican made  a pathetic appeal to Dad to stay and give them a hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to  hear you,&rdquo; Dad growled, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want my horses and cattle shot, either. Go  off with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dad turned  away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Rudd&mdash;&rdquo;  the schoolmaster commenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have  nothing better to do,&rdquo; Dad shouted at him, &ldquo;go away into the bush, and fire off  your rifles. Go away to your school, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad closed the  door on them, and the delegates turned away, and laughed and swore alternately.</p>
<p>A tall  formidable-looking military man in khaki, and long-necked spurs and a bunch of  drooping emu feathers, stepped on to the railway platform one Saturday, and was  met by all the members of the new rifle club.</p>
<p>The military man  was a major, and had come from Brisbane in his official capacity to select and  mark out a suitable site for the rifle range. The members took charge of him,  and drove him round the district, and showed him all the localities likely to  make a suitable shooting ground, but the major shook his head, and condemned  them all in turn as useless and dangerous. He sat down at last, and discussed  the position with the club, and explained his ideas of a proper rifle range.  The members spoke of the natural formation of Dad&rsquo;s paddock. They also made him  acquainted with Dad&rsquo;s views on the matter, and gave Dad a bad character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a  look at it, anyway,&rdquo; the major said, hopefully, and the club crawled through  the barb-wire, and conducted him across Dad&rsquo;s paddock towards the mountain. The  major was delighted with the site they pointed out to him; it was Canaan to  him, and he said that nature had intended it for a rifle range, and nothing  else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we  going to get it?&rdquo; the schoolmaster asked, mournfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think my  presence would have any influence on the old gentleman,&rdquo; the major resumed,  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll form a deputation, and wait on him right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schoolmaster  brightened up, and said he believed the major&rsquo;s uniform would be a powerful  argument to use on Dad, but Tommy Regan shook his head sceptically again, and  said he reckoned it wouldn&rsquo;t have any more effect than a goat skin.</p>
<p>The major smiled  in his military way at Regan, and proceeded to form the deputation.</p>
<p>Headed by the  major, the deputation started off, and called at the wind-mill for Dave, and  enquired from him what objections Dad was likely to raise.</p>
<p>Dave grinned, and  said he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, will you  come with us?&rdquo; the major asked.</p>
<p>Dave hesitated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; he  drawled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be much use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major thought  Dave&rsquo;s presence on the deputation would be a lot of use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he  added, persuasively, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a member of the club, Rudd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, orright,&rdquo;  Dave said, slowly, and like a lamb going to the slaughter, went along with  them.</p>
<p>The deputation  met Dad half way between the house and the barn, and the major saluted him as  though he were a commandant, and looked round for Dave to introduce the party.  But Dave wasn&rsquo;t with the party just then. Dave had gone over to the dog kennel  to give one of the greyhounds a drink of water. Dave was a long while giving that  greyhound a drink of water.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster  stepped into the breach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Major  Nockpin, Mr. Rudd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just come from Headquarters, and this is his  first trip up to these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad glared  contemptuously at the emu feathers, and at the long-necked spurs, and said  nothing.</p>
<p>Then the major  proceeded cautiously to state his case.</p>
<p>Dad immediately  threw up his hands, as if he were horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sober,  man?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Have you no sense? Do you think I would turn my paddock into  a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major  appealed for a hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To th&rsquo; devil  with your bullets and your butts,&rdquo; Dad foamed, &ldquo;who wants them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the major persisted  calmly and politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you hear  what I have to say, Mr. Rudd,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;before you refuse? Just listen to me  for one moment.&rdquo; Dad paused and glared angrily at him.</p>
<p>The major  referred to Dad as the leading man of the district, and then went largely into  questions of defence. He drew imaginary pictures of an army of Japs, invading  Australia, and overrunning Dad&rsquo;s farm-lands and milking his dairy cows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where will  we be,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;if the young men of the country have not been trained in  the use of the rifle? And if leading men like yourself won&rsquo;t encourage them,  who will, Mr. Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad opened his  mouth, and glared at each member of the deputation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he broke  out in tones of indignation, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a different thing altogether&mdash;you never  told me that that was what you wanted it for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schoolmaster  made an effort to explain apologetically, but the major winked slyly at him,  and followed up his advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there  must have been some mistake,&rdquo; he said, addressing Dad again, &ldquo;because I have  always heard you spoken of, Mr. Rudd, as one of our most patriotic and philanthropic  farmers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,  colonel,&rdquo; Dad answered, waving his hand contemptuously at the publican and the  schoolmaster, &ldquo;they come here to ask fer things, and don&rsquo;t know what the d&mdash;l  they come to ask fer. They told me &rsquo;twas fer firin&rsquo; at trees and killin&rsquo; time  they wanted it.&rdquo; (He walked away several paces to show his disgust, and  returned to the major again.) &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; and he waved his hands at the publican,  and walked about some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas merely a  mistake on their part,&rdquo; the major said, soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t a  mistake, captain!&mdash;&rsquo;twas foolishness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dad for a  few seconds turned his eyes in the direction of the paddock, and reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ground is  it you want, major?&rdquo; he said, turning to the major.</p>
<p>The major, with  the assistance of the deputation, hurriedly explained the situation of the  coveted site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Dad  said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a better place than that, this side of the mountain&mdash;far better  and nearer here, too,&rdquo; and taking them to the open gate, pointed with  enthusiasm to the locality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that,&rdquo; the  major said; &ldquo;I saw that; but it would mean firing right across one of your  cultivation paddocks, Mr. Rudd, which was more than I had the courage to ask of  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce  do it matter?&rdquo; Dad replied, promptly. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I often fired shots over it  meself? Don&rsquo;t they always be firing over it? Take it&mdash;take it, General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a  Briton,&rdquo; the major said, and took Dad by the hand and shook it warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Dad  said, with more enthusiasm. &ldquo;Come in; come on, all of you.&rdquo; And he led the way  to the house.</p>
<p>The major said  he&rsquo;d have a little whisky&mdash;so did the schoolmaster and the publican. They drank  success to the new rifle club&mdash;drank it several times; then made Dad president,  and drank to him.</p>

  A Dead Horse and a Live One</b></h2>
<p>A good old horse  Prince was, and how we revered him! He was our slave&mdash;our black labour. All of  us took a turn out of Prince, and drove him and rode him about without mercy.  He was a great favourite of Dad&rsquo;s&mdash;also of Mother&rsquo;s. Mother wouldn&rsquo;t drive  behind any other horse but Prince. He was the only quadruped Mother would trust  her life with. For twenty years we worked Prince hard on the farm, but one  night he lay down behind the barn, and died, and we didn&rsquo;t work him any more.  Barty found him when he was dead, and while we were having breakfast rushed in,  and broke the news.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page073.jpg" alt="prince" width="650" height="557"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince is dun fer,&rdquo;  he shouted wildly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s pegged out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad let fall his  knife and fork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whaht?</i> the <i>horse?</i>&rdquo; he said, with a look of astonishment. Dad spoke as though  he thought a horse should live on for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Prince?&rdquo;  Mother gasped, putting down her tea-cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely never!&rdquo;  Sarah broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; Joe  chuckled&mdash;&ldquo;lyin&rsquo; down, I &rsquo;spect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come an&rsquo; see,  then,&rdquo; Barty shouted. &ldquo;His legs is stiff, anyhow, and he&rsquo;ll let y&rsquo; put y&rsquo; foot  right on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad rose from the  table, and, bareheaded, went out to investigate. We rose and followed Dad.  Barty was delighted with the commotion he had raised. It wasn&rsquo;t often we took  so much notice of Barty. He rushed into the lead, and disappeared behind the  barn, and when the rest of us turned the corner he was standing triumphantly on  the corpse, waving his hand about and looking like the statue of Captain Cook.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page075.jpg" alt="dead" width="650" height="527"></p>
<p>Dad stopped  suddenly when he saw Barty, and murmured&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well;  well, well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad seemed  satisfied that the horse was dead. So did Mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor  Prince,&rdquo; she moaned; &ldquo;poor Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead alright,&rdquo;  Joe said laconically, walking round and scrutinizing the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell y&rsquo;  he were,&rdquo; Barty chuckled cheerfully, and going off the brute&rsquo;s ribs, as he  would off a spring board, jumped in the air, and, landing on the carcase again,  squeezed a melancholy groan out of Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound you,  get down off him!&rdquo; Dad burst out angrily, &ldquo;get down, you scamp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barty got down in  a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear away out  of this altogether,&rdquo; Dad added, lifting a heavy stick from the ground. Barty  bolted off like a hunted emu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tinker!&rdquo; and  Dad heaved the stick after Barty, but it went wide of the mark.</p>
<p>Dad turned to  Prince again, and once more said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well;  well, well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother and Sarah  sighed some more, then turned away, and we all went back to finish breakfast.  We didn&rsquo;t eat any more, though. We sat and talked of our bereavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be hard to  replace him,&rdquo; Dad said sorrowfully, and left the table again.</p>
<p>Dave and Joe were  harnessing up to go ploughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better hook a  couple of the horses to old Prince,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;and drag him away somewhere. It  won&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then taking Joe&rsquo;s  pair by the head Dad himself led them round to yoke them to the body. Both  animals rattled their chains about, and slouched dreamily along behind Dad  until suddenly confronted with the motionless form of the dead. They stopped  short then, and stretched out their necks, and stared and snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on with y&rsquo;,&rdquo;  Dad growled, &ldquo;did y&rsquo; never see him before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nigger and Nugget  stared as though they had not. There seemed to be a lot of superstition about  Nigger and Nugget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You old fools,  come on,&rdquo; and Dad tugged hard at their heads.</p>
<p>Nigger and Nugget  yielded a little. They advanced a short step, and stretched their necks out  further. They stretched them till they smelt Prince, and were convinced he was  dead. Then they snorted again and jumped away, and reared up, and fell back in  a heap, and got mixed up in each other&rsquo;s harness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; deuce  is th&rsquo; matter with y&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dad roared, clutching at the reins as the animals  recovered their footing. &ldquo;Stan&rsquo; up,&rdquo; and he kicked Nugget, and jerked the bit  in his mouth, and the animals backed in a circle of confusion, snorting all the  while, until their heels were right up against Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&mdash;ay, then,  will y&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dad shouted, shaking his fist in their faces. They both &ldquo;wa&mdash;ayed,&rdquo;  and in fear and trembling stood stealing glances from behind their winkers at  each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&mdash;ay, now,&rdquo; and  Dad released their heads, and stood by in readiness to grab them again should  the brutes show signs of disobedience. They were restless and continued to  suspect each other of being the one that was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&mdash;ay,&rdquo; Dad  drawled coaxingly, and slipping behind the brutes quickly fastened a spare  chain round the neck of Prince. Then he lifted the swingle-trees, and had just  hooked the horses on when Nugget turned his head right round, and located  Prince. He snorted loudly, and startled his companion, and both of them bounded  off, reefing and rushing and ploughing the dust up with the dead horse. &ldquo;Wa-ay,&rdquo;  Dad shouted; but the rigid limbs of the dead horse mowed him down, and he  somersaulted over the carcass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce  is he up to?&rdquo; Joe cried, as he turned the corner of the barn, and witnessed all  the confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&mdash;ay, Nugget,  wa&mdash;ay, boy,&rdquo; he shouted, giving chase to the bolting horses. But terror had  taken complete possession of Nugget and Nigger, and, heading for the gate, they  scrambled across several heavy sleepers that had been drawn from the range, and  lay in the yard dressed for the foundation of a new barn; but the corpse  refused to follow. Prince&rsquo;s nose, which had been cutting through the dust like  the coulter of a plough, became jambed under one of the sleepers.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page078.jpg" alt="jambed" width="659" height="523"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&mdash;ay, lads,  wa&mdash;ay,&rdquo; Joe continued to shout, as he followed in pursuit. But Nigger and  Nugget, flying from the dead, were in a hurry. They swayed and swerved, and  doubling themselves into the collars tore the ground up with their toes, and  shifted the sleepers, and pulled Prince&rsquo;s head clean off, and galloped through  the gate, and round the lucerne paddock with it flying up behind them like a  football. Joe, with folded arms, stood and looked round at Dad, and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it,  fellow!&rdquo; Dad roared, coming along, his hat in his hand and dust in his hair; &ldquo;Why  haven&rsquo;t you them horses trained properly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t <i>jibs</i>, anyway,&rdquo; Joe answered, pointing to  the headless form of Prince as evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n it!&rdquo; Dad  gasped, &ldquo;d&mdash;n it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince was missed  a lot from the farm, especially by Mother and Dad, and there was no other horse  fit to take his place. They were all too flighty or too clumsy for general use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must get one  somewhere,&rdquo; Dad used to say, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t go on like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And one day he  went to town, and after spending a lot of time at the sale yards, came home  leading a fat, well-groomed grey horse. We all ran out, and stood round  admiring Prince&rsquo;s successor. Joe took him by the head, and looked in his mouth,  and gravely announced his age as &ldquo;eight and a-half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Dad  said. &ldquo;Why he ain&rsquo;t shed his foal&rsquo;s teeth yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave came forward  then, and opened the grey&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t an old  horse, anyway,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old! &rsquo;&rsquo; Dad  grunted, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only a colt, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dave walked  all round the quadruped, and examined it closely, and Barty, who had been  making friends with the animal while the others were discussing its qualities,  planked his big toe on the side of the brute&rsquo;s knee, and attempted to climb on  its back, but Dad, anticipating Barty, stepped back and brought the end of the  halter, which had a big knot in it, down hard on the fleshy part of Barty, and  Barty changed his mind suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what he was  looking for,&rdquo; Joe said, approving of Dad&rsquo;s action, and Barty, rubbing himself  and wearing a wounded look on his face, rushed into the open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad  asked, when Dave had finished examining the grey, &ldquo;what do y&rsquo; think of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad little  &rsquo;orse as fur as looks go,&rdquo; Dave drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me  he&rsquo;s a lot better than he looks,&rdquo; Dad said proudly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he were cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow much?&rdquo; Dave  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would y&rsquo;  think?&rdquo; Dad answered with a grin.</p>
<p>Dave bit big  pieces out of his moustache, and considered hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve pounds?&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>Dad laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three ten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem!&rdquo; And  Dave eyed the grey all over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all,  then,&rdquo; Dad repeated triumphantly, and led the grey over to the trough, and gave  it a drink. Then he put the brute in the yard, and threw as much oaten hay out  to him as would satisfy a mob of horses.</p>
<p>Next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put him in  the cart, an&rsquo; see how he goes,&rdquo; Dad said, referring to the new horse. And while  Mother and Sarah and the rest of us assembled in the yard to witness the trial,  Dad and Joe threw some harness on the grey, and dragged the new spring cart out  of the shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t take  much notice of the harness, anyway,&rdquo; Joe remarked hopefully, and taking the  animal by the head he started to shove him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He backs well,&rdquo;  Joe added approvingly, as the grey willingly went between the shafts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my word!&rdquo;  Dad said, assisting to buckle the gear. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alright&mdash;an&rsquo; he were cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheap right  enough,&rdquo; Joe muttered, gathering the reins together, and climbing into the  cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he  pretty,&rdquo; Mother remarked admiringly, and Sarah said she &ldquo;loved grey horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump up!&rdquo; Joe  said, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll take him as far as the railway station, and bring back the  rock salt that&rsquo;s there.&rdquo; And Dad let down the tail board of the cart, and got  in the back way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Greygo,&rdquo;  Joe shouted, standing up, and addressing the horse encouragingly, &ldquo;show us what  you&rsquo;re made of.&rdquo; And he touched the brute with the reins. Greygo put down his  head, and shook it till the winkers nearly fell off, but showed no inclination  to tighten the traces.</p>
<p>Joe laughed  suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him  gently,&rdquo; Dad yelled, &ldquo;take him gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe lifted a  greenhide whip from the bottom of the cart, and brought it down heavily on  Greygo. Greygo responded instantly. He rushed backwards at an alarming pace,  and Joe, taken by surprise, fell forward on to the animal&rsquo;s back, and only  saved himself from accident by getting astride it.</p>
<p>Mother and Sarah  squealed, and ran to escape being run over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woh, woh! Where  th&rsquo; devil are y&rsquo; going t&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dad shouted, clutching the sides of the cart, and  looking wildly round.</p>
<p>Joe struggled hard  to force Greygo to reverse action.</p>
<p>He dug his heels  into him, then struck him between the ears with the handle of the whip. But  Greygo went backwards all the faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo;  Dad roared, and drew in his legs just in time to save them from being amputated  as the back of the cart, with a hard bang, crashed into the water tank, and  made a big hole in it, and let all the water out.</p>
<p>It squirted in  every direction, and filled the cart, and wet Dad to the skin before he could  scramble out over the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! Oh my! Oh  my!&rdquo; Mother whined, when she saw the water flying about.</p>
<p>And Dad in angry  tones roared at Joe&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil  did y&rsquo; let him do that fer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Joe, who had  jumped from the back of the horse, stood staring and grinning at the damage.</p>
<p>Then Dad jumped  forward, and kicked Greygo several times in the ribs. Greygo sat back in the  breeching again, and shoved the cart further into the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him alone!  Leave him alone!&rdquo; Joe shouted advisedly; but Dad didn&rsquo;t take any notice of Joe.  Dad delivered Greygo several more kicks, and Greygo shoved the tank right off  the stand, and it rolled away down the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told y&rsquo; to  leave him alone,&rdquo; Joe said reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo;  Dad bellowed, &ldquo;th&rsquo; <i>rubbish!</i>&rdquo; And he  kicked Greygo again. Then Dad seized the brute savagely by the ear, and pulled  it, and Greygo threw his head about, and struck Dad with it in the chest, and  knocked him down.</p>
<p>It was too much  for Joe. He concealed himself behind the cart, and held his sides, while Dad  got his wind back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stop yer  runnin&rsquo; back,&rdquo; Dad said, after recovering. And he hobbled over to the barn, and  returned to the scene of action with a piece of barbed wire, which he proceeded  to wrap round the breeching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try him now,&rdquo;  Dad said, when the wrapping was finished, and Joe, with a broad smile, mounted  the cart again, and cracked the whip. Greygo promptly sat in the breeching  again, then bounded into the collar, and tore down the yard, with the cart  rattling behind him. Dad stood and laughed. Dad was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Joe  called out, steadying Greygo, while Dad hurried to catch up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go now  alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dad had  crawled into the cart again, Joe touched Greygo with the whip once more, and  the brute sat back in the breeching as before, then bolted off again.</p>
<p>Dad laughed some  more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon knock the  jibbing out of him,&rdquo; Dad said, as the grey, pulling hard on Joe, stepped it out  down the lane.</p>
<p>Coming to a steep  cutting leading into the creek, Dad called out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it steady  here,&rdquo; and Joe pulled on the reins, and took it steady. But when Greygo,  starting to descend, tried to hold the cart back, the barbed wire found him out  more than ever, and he seemed to think he was required to break into another  gallop. He made off, but Joe held him back. Then he started to kick. He kicked  all the way down the cutting. He kicked the bottom right out of the new cart,  and emptied Joe and Dad out on the flat rocks, and raced along the bed of the  creek with the cart on its back, and climbed up one of the steep banks without  it. Then he rolled in the grass several times, and got up without any harness  on.</p>
<p>Dad wouldn&rsquo;t have  any more to do with Greygo. Dad got rid of him. He swapped him to young Regan  for a red heifer that had a cold, and a kangaroo dog. The red heifer gave four  of our best cows tuberculosis, and the kangaroo dog killed twenty-five of our  fowls and fourteen turkeys belonging to Thompson, and involved Dad in a law  suit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  Marvin Mulcahy&rsquo;s Pigs</b></h2>
<p>Two buyers were  scouring our district, giving high prices for fat pigs. They purchased  thirty-four from us, and six from Martin Mulcahy, a bachelor eking out a hard  lonely existence out on the hot, sweltering plains of the Darling Downs. Martin  got excited over his prospects&mdash;&rsquo;twas the first lot of porkers he had raised&mdash;and  rushed into our yard early next morning to know if Dave or Joe or someone could  give him a hand to cart them to the railway yard and truck for the buyers. Dave  was sorry he couldn&rsquo;t assist him&mdash;so was Joe. Their hands were full with the  handling of our own. Martin was in distress, and stood scratching his head  through his thin felt hat.</p>
<p>Dad came out and  asked what was the matter.</p>
<p>Joe explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad said,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin demurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t  expect it from you, Mr. Rudd,&rdquo; he said, remembering Dad had once been a Member  of Parliament. But Dad was not a snob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; he  said, and went inside, and put on an old hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the man  for the country,&rdquo; Martin said, when Dad returned. (Martin had a flattering way  with him when he liked.)</p>
<p>Then they both  went off together.</p>
<p>As they crossed  the paddocks Martin explained that he had kept his horses in the yard all  night, and would have been able to make an early start, only that old Regan  passing by before daylight, saw them, and thinking they had been left there by  mistake, threw the sliprail down and let them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re down be  the grass trees,&rdquo; Martin added, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t mind, we&rsquo;ll go round that  way, an&rsquo; drive them up before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, very  well,&rdquo; Dad answered cheerfully, and followed Martin on a four-mile tramp  through long wet grass, over broken gullies and melon holes, and amongst acres  and acres of Bathurst burr and Scotch thistles, and beds of weeds and rubbish  where snakes and hares and kangaroo rats and all the vermin of the earth  abounded in any number.</p>
<p>Dad began to get  tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; he  would break out at intervals, as he stumbled along after Martin; &ldquo;what th&rsquo;  devil did the feller want letting th&rsquo; horses out for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Martin,  without pausing or turning his head, would explain the reason all over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he had no  right,&rdquo; Dad would shout out, &ldquo;to throw down another man&rsquo;s sliprails, and let  his horses out.&rdquo; And Martin would agree with Dad, and to keep him in good  humour would curse old Regan fluently and with violence. There were times when  Martin used to show a lot of tact.</p>
<p>At last they  found the horses, and hunted them to the yard just about dinner time. The  brutes were in a sportive mood, and raced up and stood waiting with their tails  elevated. Martin urged Dad to run so as to be up in time to block them coming  out of the yard. But they didn&rsquo;t come out of the yard. They didn&rsquo;t go into the  yard. They couldn&rsquo;t get in. Someone had been there since Martin had left, and  put the rails up. Martin struck himself on the thigh with the palm of his hand,  and swore earnestly. Dad grunted, and said that the sliprails of a yard should  always be left down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a  holy terror,&rdquo; Martin murmured. Then, after thinking hard, he told Dad to walk  up quietly and throw the sliprails down again, and he would block the horses  himself if they broke back. Dad stalked up quietly, and threw one rail down.  The sound of it startled the animals, and away they went at full gallop. Martin  threw up his arms and shouted at them to stop. They went faster. They nearly  ran over Martin, and raced down the plain till they were only dim specks moving  in the distance. Martin followed in pursuit. Dad fixed the sliprails, and  hobbled along after Martin with an angry scowl on his face.</p>
<p>Another hour and  they were back with the horses, and this time secured them in the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known it  meant all this runnin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; Dad said, removing his hat, and wiping the perspiration  from his forehead with a large coloured handkerchief&mdash;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a come for  fifty poun&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, we&rsquo;ve got  &rsquo;em now, Mr. Rudd,&rdquo; Martin answered soothingly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em caught and  harnessed while you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; in half an hour we&rsquo;ll be loaded an&rsquo; away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin didn&rsquo;t  catch the horses with the ease he anticipated. The black mare had not had a  pair of winkers on since she had had the foal, and she snorted and rushed and  poked her head into the cow bail and into every hole and corner of the yard for  a good solid hour&mdash;until Dad wanted to know &ldquo;what th&rsquo; devil was th&rsquo; use of  thinkin&rsquo; of takin&rsquo; pigs to the railway with a fool of a thing like her.&rdquo; But  Martin explained it was the foal that was doing it, and assured him she would  be as right as rain when they got loaded and going.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t get  loaded for another hour&mdash;not until Dad had wasted a lot of profanity on the  pigs, and had fallen down several times under them in the sty, and broken  several waddies on them, and left the imprint of his big right foot on the ribs  of almost every porker. And they didn&rsquo;t get going until the black mare had  bucked all round the humpy in the shafts, and buried the point of one in the  hindquarters of the leader, and run the wheel of the dray through the water  cask, and bumped the side out of the dwelling with the tail board; and not  until Martin had found some wire and greenhide, and mended all the harness  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How th&rsquo; devil do  you expect to get to the railway to-night with a mad mare like that?&rdquo; Dad raved,  &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never pull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin  reckoned she would be &ldquo;orright drekeley,&rdquo; and patted the trembling beast on the  neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s collar  proud, that&rsquo;s all. She&rsquo;ll settle down soon as we get outer the gate,&rdquo; he said.  Martin had a lot of confidence in the black mare.</p>
<p>He adjusted the  reins, and patting the brute again, turned to Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you jump  up behind the pigs (the pigs were enclosed in a rough paling frame open at the  top like a small garden, and which was as deep as Dad was tall) I&rsquo;ll walk and  drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad hesitated and  suspiciously eyed the ricketty old dray, with its extravagant bandages of wire  and greenhide; then looked at the horses, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it would  be better if I drove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Martin wouldn&rsquo;t  hear of Dad driving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a long distance to&mdash;(wa-ah) &mdash;walk is eight mi&mdash;(wa-ah)&mdash;miles; you  jump up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad looked  askance at the feverish, restless black mare, and again at the fractured shafts  and plugged wheels; then slowly and reluctantly crawled up into the back of the  dray and stood behind the &ldquo;cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo;  Martin said, addressing the horses, and touching them lightly with the reins.  Both animals started, the leader at a prance, the black mare with a bound and a  buck. Martin ran beside them holding the reins and keeping their heads straight  for the open gate. Dad got a feeling into his head that the whole turnout was  going to pieces under him, and became alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!  Hold them! hold them, man!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>Martin was doing  his best&mdash;so were the horses.</p>
<p>Dad glanced round  to see if there was any chance of jumping off with safety. There was no chance.  Then, he appealed to the animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-ay, horses, <i>wa-ay</i> there,&rdquo; he shouted. Just then one  of the wheels struck the gatepost with a loud bang, and the dray and the pigs  and Dad were for a moment on the verge of eternity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop them, man,  and let me down! <i>Confound</i> you!&rdquo; Dad  roared, clinging to the &ldquo;cage.&rdquo; But Martin swung the horses round into the  road, and kept them going, and with nothing before her but open plain the black  mare settled down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s orright  now,&rdquo; Martin called out, looking up at Dad with a grin, &ldquo;good little puller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dad didn&rsquo;t  pass any compliments upon the black mare, or upon her prancing companion  either. He saw nothing but the steep banks of the creek looming ahead, and was  thinking of his neck.</p>
<p>Martin eased up  when he came to the creek to let the horses get their wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you reckon  they can take it up that other bank?&rdquo; Dad asked, staring at the cutting with  deep concern.</p>
<p>Martin in his own  heart had a deal of doubt about it, but said they would &ldquo;manage it easy,&rdquo; then  started them into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful, now,&rdquo;  Dad shouted, as the dray began to descend, &ldquo;careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, right,  right,&rdquo; Martin answered, hanging on to the mare&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The pigs tumbled  and rolled about and crowded to the front (the low end going down hill) of the  &ldquo;cage,&rdquo; and the black mare staggered under the extra weight, but got safely down.  The water in the bed of the creek was a couple of feet deep, and at the edge of  it, Martin called &ldquo;Wa-ay.&rdquo; The animal &ldquo;wa-ayed,&rdquo; and puffed and pawed the water  into foam.</p>
<p>Martin looked at  Dad, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in with the  pigs, and keep them from coming back when we&rsquo;re going up the other side. Keep  them well up in front of the &ldquo;cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad demurred  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; he  growled, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you manage without me getting in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Martin  said persuasively, &ldquo;the pigs &rsquo;ll come back to the tail end going up the bank,  and the weight might lift the mare off her feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fool of a  way to bring pigs to a railway, anyhow,&rdquo; Dad grunted, and climbed up stiffly,  and entered the &ldquo;cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Martin didn&rsquo;t  lose any time. He gathered the reins together again, and jumped on the back of  the black mare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil  are you doing?&rdquo; Dad yelled down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s quiet,&rdquo;  Martin answered calmly, &ldquo;and I might as well get over dry as soakin&rsquo; wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!  Hold on till I get down, you fool of a fellow.&rdquo; And Dad made an effort to  descend. But Martin spoke to the horses, &ldquo;Git erp,&rdquo; he said, and the black  mare, who had never been broken to saddle, feeling something astride her,  bounded through the water and started up the opposite bank at full gallop.  Martin clung to her like an ourang-outang, and yelled at the leader for not  keeping in front.</p>
<p>Dad hung on to  the &ldquo;cage,&rdquo; and kicked at the porkers, and reviled Martin at the top of his  voice.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page093.jpg" alt="pigs" width="650" height="525"></p>
<p>Another bound or  two from the black mare, and the dray would have landed safely out of the  cutting, but somehow or other, just when it was in the steepest place the catch  of it&mdash;it was a tip dray&mdash;got loose, and up it went without any warning, and the &ldquo;cage&rdquo;  and Dad and all the pigs toppled back and landed in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl, good  girl,&rdquo; Martin called out, complimenting the mare on her performance, as she  reached the top. Then he said, &ldquo;Wa-ay,&rdquo; and looked smilingly round to see how  Dad was getting on. But he saw Dad wasn&rsquo;t on at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my, my!&rdquo; he  murmured, and dismounted, and rushed down the cutting. Dad was there wrestling  with a heavy porker right in the middle of the stream. The other pigs were  promiscuously poking about the bank.</p>
<p>Martin took in  the situation at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold him, hold  him,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;till I bring a rein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold him be  dashed,&rdquo; Dad answered, releasing his grip of the porker&rsquo;s ear, and delivering  the brute a farewell kick in the flanks. Then he waded out of the water, and  called Martin a lunatic, and said he should be in the asylum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t  understand how it happened,&rdquo; Martin murmured, returning to the dray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened,&rdquo;  Dad snorted, &ldquo;because a fool was driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin said no  more but straightened the dray in silence, and waited till Dad cooled down, and  was amenable to reason. Then he made a suggestion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ryan&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;is not far along.  We&rsquo;ll get the pigs together, and if you drive them, I&rsquo;ll take the dray along,  and we can load them there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad swore some  more at Martin, then sulkily went with him after the pigs.</p>
<p>At Ryan&rsquo;s&mdash;with  the assistance of two other men&mdash; they reloaded the porkers and started again,  and reached the railway without further mishap.</p>
<p>The buyers had  finished trucking, and were just turning away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back your dray  up to that truck there,&rdquo; one of them said, pointing to a waggon that was almost  packed with pigs&mdash;and lift them in carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The buyers then  crossed over to the hotel.</p>
<p>Martin, after a  lot of pushing and grunting and swearing, in which Dad joined heartily, worked  the dray into position. Then he pushed back the sliding door of the truck, and  commenced trucking. Everything went smoothly. There was only one more pig to  lift in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last, thank  God,&rdquo; Dad said, as Martin caught the brute by the ear. Then Dad gripped the  other ear, and locked hands with Martin under the brute&rsquo;s belly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo;  Martin said, and they were just going to heave it into the truck when something  disturbed the black mare, and she jumped forward, and Dad and Martin and the  porker fell in a struggling heap on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-ay,&rdquo; Martin  shouted to the mare.</p>
<p>The pig found its  legs first, and made off up the line. Martin rose and pursued it. Dad pulled  himself together and hobbled after Martin.</p>
<p>After running  about two hundred yards, Martin gave up and turned round. Nothing but pigs met  his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh hang it! Why  didn&rsquo;t you shut the door?&rdquo; he shouted to Dad, who was still hobbling along.</p>
<p>Dad looked round  then, and saw a long coloured line of pigs&mdash;about fifty in all&mdash;reaching from  within a couple of yards of himself to the door of the railway truck.</p>
<p>Dad&rsquo;s two arms  went up like a pair of railway signals, and his mouth and eyes opened wide.  Then he turned with a savage glare to Martin. But Dad didn&rsquo;t speak. He  couldn&rsquo;t. His mouth closed with a snap like a spring trap, and he rushed  through the fence, and left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Dave Brings Home a Wife</b></h2>
<p>All was joy and  merriment at Ruddville. There was no grumbling, no dissension, no  dissatisfaction of any kind. Even Dad took things cheerfully, and became frisky  and light-hearted as a fat lamb. The longest days seemed short hours, and home  was simply heaven. Dave was the cause of all the love and felicity. Dave got  married, and brought his wife home to live with us. A fine wife she was, too&mdash;a  slim, jolly girl with red hair. Lily White was her name, and we took a great  liking to her. So did Dave. Lots of young fellows down at Prosperity had tried  hard to win Lily, but she rejected them all with contumely. Dave thought all  the more of her on that account.</p>
<p>The welcome we  gave to Lily when she arrived seemed to add twenty years to Dave&rsquo;s life. Our  display of affection quite overpowered him; swelled his breast with gratitude,  and filled his eyes with tears as large as hailstones. All of us except Bill  and Tom and me met them at the gate, and kissed Lily freely. We hesitated when  it came to hugging her, but Sarah shoved us forward, and said&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page097.jpg" alt="gate" width="650" height="585"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo; goin&rsquo; t&rsquo;  kiss Lily? She&rsquo;s your sister now.&rdquo; Then we took courage and waded in&mdash;though we  wouldn&rsquo;t have hugged Sarah, herself, for a fortune, unless it was on her solemn  assurance that she was going far from home, and would never return. </p>
<p>&nbsp;After us Dad stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said,  removing his hat to expedite the performance, &ldquo;if she be your sister, she be my  daughter,&rdquo; and he commenced vigorously where we had left off. When Dad finished  with Lily, Sarah took possession of her, and hugged her again, and put an arm  round her waist, and conducted her up the verandah steps into Dave&rsquo;s little  room, where she took her hat off for her, and kissed her some more, and showed  her the newly-papered walls&mdash; papered for her special comfort, and a new bed  curtain and draping, and a coloured pincushion and a pair of flower vases and a  wardrobe and other knicknacks and pieces of furniture which Sarah had robbed  her own room of to surprise Lily with and make her happy.</p>
<p>And Lily was  happy. She sat on the bed, and said so. She spoke fondly of Dave, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hard  parting with Mother,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mind when I know I have a good  husband.&rdquo; And tears came into her eyes, and Sarah kissed them away, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows it  better than I do, dear. He was always my favourite brother,&rdquo; (which was a fib,  because Sarah always reckoned Dave a nuisance, and never tired of wishing him  married). She seemed to think that a wife was the worst infliction she could  wish Dave. Then Sarah broke into tears, and Lily kissed them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my  sister,&rdquo; she said, and changed the subject.</p>
<p>She turned it on  to Sarah&rsquo;s future, and they became very confidential. Sarah smiled happily at  Lily, and said she couldn&rsquo;t say for certain when it was to be; it might be at  Easter twelve months or the following Christmas.</p>
<p>It all depended.  But Lily wasn&rsquo;t to mention it to a soul&mdash; not even to Dave. And when Lily had  given her solemn word not to divulge the secret, they kissed each other again,  and said,&mdash; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sisters now for ever.&rdquo; Then they returned to the verandah,  where Mother and Dad and the rest of us were trying to entertain Dave. But Dave  was a hard bridegroom to entertain. He didn&rsquo;t hear a word we had to say to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you was  lost,&rdquo; he said, eagerly grabbing Lily by the arm, and leading her inside to sit  on the sofa.</p>
<p>Four weeks  passed, and the home was merrier than ever. And Lily and Dave were as happy  looking as a garden. Dave <i>was</i> proud  of his Lily. He rarely ever left her side. Lily knew the run of the house, too,  now, and understood our ways, and addressed us all by our Christian names, and  called Dad &ldquo;Father.&rdquo; Lily was never untidy, either, and always came to her  meals in a neat dress, and sat beside Dave with a buttercup in her hair. And  she would talk cheerfully all the time, and point out resemblances between  Mother&rsquo;s eyes and Dave&rsquo;s, or Dad&rsquo;s nose and Bill&rsquo;s. Lily was an observant young  woman.</p>
<p>In the afternoons  Sarah would take Lily for a walk. Often they would go down to the paddock, and  keep Dave company till nearly tea time. On other occasions they would go  visiting together, and sometimes they would ride to the store or to the railway  station. And Sarah would give her side-saddle to Lily, and ride in a man&rsquo;s  saddle herself. Sarah <i>was</i> fond of  Lily. She couldn&rsquo;t do half enough for her. And Lily loved Sarah. Mother said  she never knew two young people to be so devoted to each other. And Dad  reckoned it was fortunate for Dave that Sarah wasn&rsquo;t Joe.</p>
<p>Four more weeks  elapsed. Sarah and Lily were not so fond of each other now. They didn&rsquo;t go  anywhere together at all. Somehow they avoided one another; and Lily would go  down the paddock alone, and remain with Dave till he knocked off work.  Mealtimes, too, lost all their cheerfulness. All the good-fellowship had gone  from them. There was scarcely any conversation carried on at the table, and  Sarah was nearly always absent from it. While we were eating she would be  working and banging things about in the kitchen. Sometimes Dad would miss her,  and looking up at Mother, he would ask, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sarah?&rdquo; and Mother would  change colour, and mumble a clumsy apology, which would make Lily fidget, and  look along her nose; and frequently Lily would refuse a second cup of tea, which  she was badly in need of, and leave the table before she had finished, and,  with Dave, at her heels, would retire to her room. But Dad was not a man to  notice little things, and sometimes he would add with a yell, &ldquo;Well, why th&rsquo;  devil doesn&rsquo;t she come and get her tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave and Lily  isolated themselves; spent a lot of time in their room, and we wondered what  was the matter. We couldn&rsquo;t make it out, and Joe asked Sarah one night what it  was all about. Sarah, who had her sleeves rolled up making bread, dug her fists  deep into the dough, and said, &ldquo;Pshaw! the little cat!&rdquo; Then she turned the  dough over, and slapped it down hard on the table, and punched it with her  other fist. Joe chuckled, and said he could never understand why women couldn&rsquo;t  agree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you agree  with anyone,&rdquo; Sarah snapped, &ldquo;who expects you to do all the cooking and washing  and slaving, and to run about and clean up after them, while they sit down and  act the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo;  Joe said flippantly. Joe enjoyed Sarah when she was angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it  nothing?&rdquo; And Sarah leaned on the dough with both hands, and glared at him  after the manner of Dad. &ldquo;Then let her do it if it isn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not going to stay  here and scrub and wash her dirt for her any more; that&rsquo;s one thing. Anyway,  the least she might do is to clean out her own room, and make her own bed of a  morning, instead of titivating herself as soon as she gets up; scenting  herself, too! And dolling her old red hair to come out and sit down to  breakfast, as if she was Lady Muck or somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sarah waded  into the bread again.</p>
<p>Joe grinned some  more, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jealous,  Sal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jealous! What of?&rdquo;  Sarah fired up. &ldquo;Of that cat? . . . with her red hair. . . . Pooh! if it was  mine, I&rsquo;d get some lamp black and change its colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe went away  smiling, and Dave, with a warlike look on his face, entered the kitchen. Dave  was looking for fight.</p>
<p>Sarah didn&rsquo;t look  at Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any matches here?&rdquo;  Dave asked, maneuvering for an opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some  there,&rdquo; Sarah jerked out, walloping the dough as though it were a carpet.</p>
<p>Dave glanced  round the room for a second or two, then rested his eyes on Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you  been doing to Lily?&rdquo; he drawled at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;ve  been doing anything to Lily?&rdquo; And Sarah flashed her big eyes on Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know you  insulted her,&rdquo; Dave replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if asking  her to do her own dirty work is insulting her,&rdquo; Sarah snorted, facing Dave with  a big cake of dough in her hand, &ldquo;then I <i>did</i> . . . and I&rsquo;ll do it again . . . and what&rsquo;s more you can tell her so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very  funny,&rdquo; Dave sneered, and walked out. Dave was no match for Sarah in a row.</p>
<p>Dave went across  to the barn where the husking was being carried on by lamplight, and confided  his troubles to Dad, and, in the interests of peace, suggested building a house  for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave them  alone,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take any notice of them; they&rsquo;re all the same; they&rsquo;ll  drive you mad if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad didn&rsquo;t look  upon the idea of building another house with favour. Dad never approved of  ideas that cost money. And for the time being Dave took his advice.</p>
<p>But one evening,  when loud screams issued from the house, and we all stampeded from the milking  yard, and found Sarah mauling and clawing Lily, and trailing her about over the  backs of chairs, matters were brought to a head.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page103.jpg" alt="mauling" width="586" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit  of good,&rdquo; Dave moaned to Dad, after peace was restored, &ldquo;I must have a house of  my own, or else I&rsquo;ll clear out and look for work somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad  answered slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t get a bit of timber somewhere and put you  one up.&rdquo; Then realising to what length he had committed himself in the way of  expenditure, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Dash th&rsquo; women, they&rsquo;re always fighting about  something or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After tea Dad sat  on the verandah and cooled down and ruminated for a long time. Then he called  Dave and Joe together, and discussed the position with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were a  house down on that old farm of Grogan&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;Is that there yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of it&rsquo;s  standing&rdquo; Dave drawled. And Joe remarked, with a chuckle, that he was once  &ldquo;nearly putting it all in the dray and bringing it home for a calf pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! not at  all, not at all,&rdquo; Dad said in disapproval. &ldquo;That were a snug little place when  Grogan lived there first&mdash;forty-five year ago, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-five year  ago?&rdquo; from Dave.</p>
<p>Joe chuckled  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dad said  sententiously, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s any older than that. Let me see (he made a  mental calculation in the dark). Yes . . . No . . . Yes . . . . No&mdash;no, it&rsquo;s not  more than forty-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about time  for the sap to dry,&rdquo; Joe sniggered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s pulled  down and trimmed a bit with the adze, and put up again,&rdquo; Dad went on  enthusiastically, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll look a different place. It&rsquo;ll look just as well as  this&mdash; believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll want  some new timber,&rdquo; Dave put in anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,  maybe,&rdquo; Dad grunted &ldquo;but not much, you&rsquo;ll find, not much. There&rsquo;s a lot of  material in that house when you come to go over it all. I remember it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said he  would go with the dray in the morning, and bring the building home; and that  night Dave and Lily went to bed in a happy mood, and lay awake for hours  evolving and discussing plans and specifications for their new home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Dave&rsquo;s New House</b></h2>
<p>Dad kept faith  with Dave, and, accompanied by Bill and Cranky Jack, went with the dray to  remove the house that was on Grogan&rsquo;s abandoned selection. It was an easy house  to knock down&mdash;what was standing of it; but it was tedious work gathering it all  up, and a lot of it was hard to find. The building, in its old age, had become  dislocated&mdash;got away from itself, and lay scattered here and there in the long  grass, like the bones of a dead beast. The two doors and the window were missing  altogether, and their absence gave Dad a lot of anxiety.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page107.jpg" alt="pile" width="613" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what th&rsquo;  devil&rsquo;s become of them,&rdquo; he said, after searching the paddock for hours, in  vain, &ldquo;they should be here somewhere.&rdquo; But Bill fancied there &ldquo;never were any.&rdquo;  He couldn&rsquo;t remember having seen them, and he&rsquo;d often been in the old house;  got wet under its roof many a time when seeking shelter in it from the rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; Dad  snorted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t I recollect the place long before any of you was born.  Forty-two years ago I stayed in it a night with Grogan, and there was two good  doors to it then, and a window in front made of sawn timber. I remember them  well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not here  now, anyway,&rdquo; Bill answered, concluding the argument, and approaching the  loaded dray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could get  the hinges,&rdquo; Dad murmured, rooting up the remains of an ancient fire with the toe of his  boot, &ldquo;it wouldn't matter so much. . . . . Can easy knock up a door or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad had to abandon the search, and start home with the  dray.<b> </b></p>
<p>Dad made two  trips to Grogan&rsquo;s, and when he arrived with the second load. Dave, who had just  come in for dinner, visited the scene of action to give a hand to unload.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do  you think of it?&rdquo; Dad asked cheerfully, as he arranged the timber on the ground  according to the lengths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty old, some  of it,&rdquo; Dave replied, staring hard at the pile of rubbish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old?&rdquo; Dad  answered. &ldquo;Why, bless me soul, it&rsquo;s all the better for that. It&rsquo;s your green  timber that&rsquo;s the ruin of half the houses, man. I&rsquo;d never dream of building a  house out of green timber meself. Look at Daly&rsquo;s place; nearly every slab in it  is tumblin&rsquo; out; they&rsquo;ve got that short that you could put your head between  some o&rsquo; them; and when it was put up first, I don&rsquo;t suppose there was a  better-fitted house in the country. And it&rsquo;s all because the timber was green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave pointed to a  corner post that was mostly eaten away, out of the pulpy remains of which grass  was growing luxuriantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That only wants  a bit of adzing,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s as sound as a bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave was  doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; he  drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain of it,&rdquo;  Dad answered, plucking some of the grass from the post, &ldquo;just upend it, and  feel the weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dave&rsquo;s eyes  had wandered to several slabs with large holes morticed in them, and slices  burnt off the ends and edges of them, and he stooped, and turned one over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Dad  admitted reluctantly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been knocked about a little. Some fool of a  traveller, no doubt,&rdquo; he went on in explanation, &ldquo;has been letting his fire burn  too near to them . . . . But they&rsquo;ll come in handy, you&rsquo;ll find. They&rsquo;ll do  very well for the partition; with a bit o&rsquo; paper put over them holes, no one  will ever see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad didn&rsquo;t  believe in carting timber three or four miles just to throw it away.</p>
<p>Next day Dave  suggested giving a hand to erect the house. Dave was anxious it should be built  according to the plans and specifications he and Lily had decided upon. But Dad  wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. &ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you get on with the  ploughing. I know exactly the sort of house she wants, and I&rsquo;ll make a good job  of it, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Bill and Dad  searched for the crowbar, and when they had given the axe and the adze a  touch-up on the grindstone, the new house started to go up. It went on going  up&mdash;and coming down&mdash;for weeks. Dad used to come down with it, too, sometimes. He  came down along with a lot of it one day, and lay under the ridge pole till  Bill stopped laughing, and extricated him. Then Dad cursed Bill for not  &ldquo;watching it properly,&rdquo; and they fell out, and Bill was ordered off the job.  Bill went cheerfully, and Dad put Barty on in his place. But Barty did not turn  out a success. Barty had never been engaged on a building before, and had no  confidence in himself. He had no confidence in Dad either; he was afraid of  Dad, and became confused, and did the wrong thing whenever Dad shouted at him.  And Barty was no good unless someone did shout at him. And he hadn&rsquo;t been  twenty minutes on the job when Dad, mounted on the wall, said, pointing the  hammer&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand me that  batten&rdquo; (there were a dozen or so lying about).</p>
<p>Barty was anxious  to please Dad, and, with rare alacrity, handed him the wrong batten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; and Dad  wagged his head impatiently, &ldquo;th&rsquo; one be&rsquo;ind y&rsquo;.&rdquo; (They were all behind Barty.)</p>
<p>Barty dropped the  batten he had in his hand, and seized another, and poked the end of it  hurriedly at Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Dad  yelled, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t y&rsquo; look where I&rsquo;m pointin&rsquo;? . . . <i>There</i> . . . You&rsquo;re standin&rsquo; on it.&rdquo; (Barty&rsquo;s foot covered three or  four battens.)</p>
<p>Dropping the  second batten, Barty pointed to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one, then?&rdquo;  he whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that one,&rdquo;  Dad roared, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s big enough ter see, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Barty snatched up another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, confound it,  no,&rdquo; Dad howled, &ldquo;the other one . . . <i>that</i> one.&rdquo; And he let fly the hammer viciously at the batten he required, and struck  Barty hard on the foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo-h&mdash;ow-h&mdash;wah-h-h,&rdquo;  Barty suddenly bellowed, and danced round the heap of timber on one leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why th&rsquo;  devil didn&rsquo;t you keep your eyes open?&rdquo; Dad growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h! Oh&mdash;h!&rdquo;  Barty blubbered in a lower key, placing the toe of the maimed foot lightly to  the ground, and breaking into a limp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n it!&rdquo; from  Dad. &ldquo;Am I goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; stop here all day? Hand me back  that hammer, and stop y&rsquo;r hoppin&rsquo; about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo-h!&rdquo; and Barty, lifting the tool, stood with it in  his hand, staring up in terror at Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hand me that hammer</i>,&rdquo; Dad fairly yelled  .</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page111.jpg" alt="hammer" width="565" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oo&mdash;h!&rdquo; Barty  shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do y&rsquo; <i>hear?</i>&rdquo; from Dad louder than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll h&mdash;h&mdash;<i>hit</i> me with it. . . . Oo&mdash;h!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad let out  another howl, and started to descend, and Barty, forgetting his injured limb,  turned and fled. He also forgot to leave the hammer.</p>
<p>Dad followed in  pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he  yelled, stamping through our house, &ldquo;where the devil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mr.  Rudd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the soft  voice of the parson that spoke. He had dropped in on his rounds, and was  enjoying a cup of tea, along with Mother and Lily in the sitting room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Dad jerked  out, stopping abruptly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s <i>you</i>.&rdquo; And the parson rose, and warmly shook hands with  Dad, and asked him if he was enjoying good health. And Mother, taking advantage  of the opportunity to calm Dad, asked him to have a cup of tea. Before Dad  could answer, Lily jumped to her feet to hand him the beverage, and revealed  the terrified form of Barty crouching behind her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dog!&rdquo; Dad  roared, his eyes ablaze with anger.</p>
<p>But Barty sprang  behind the parson, and clung to the tails of his long black coat, and ducked  from side to side, sparring for a chance to make a dash for the open door. The  door was behind Dad.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page113.jpg" alt="parson" width="650" height="693"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>tinker!</i>&rdquo; Dad howled, grabbing round one  side of the astonished cleric for a grip of Barty, and kicking out on the other  side of him whenever Barty dodged that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, calm  yourself, calm yourself, Mr. Rudd,&rdquo; the parson exclaimed, holding up his two  hands in front of Dad to implore peace, while Mother called&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, don&rsquo;t be  foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dad was bent  on securing some of Barty at any cost, and aimed another heavy circular kick at  him, and bruised the parson&rsquo;s shins.</p>
<p>The parson  dropped his hands, and screwed his face about, and cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep out of the  way, then,&rdquo; Dad foamed apologetically into the clergyman&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;or I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp  &rsquo;urtin&rsquo; y&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the parson  thought it wise to free himself of Barty, and made an effort to desert, but  Barty kept a firm grip of his coat, and used it as a lever to keep him in  position. At last Dad&rsquo;s wrath overcame his judgment, and in his haste he  stumbled forward against the table, and gave Barty an opening. Barty flashed  through the door like a wallaby. And Dad made a late kick at him, and fell  heavily on the floor, and rattled the crockery in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, Oh dear!  Oh dear!&rdquo; the parson said angrily. And Dad roared&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imp of a  feller,&rdquo; and rose and hobbled after Barty. But he might just as well have  remained on the floor.</p>
<p>Next day Joe  joined Dad, and between them&mdash;Joe rattling the hammer on the roof of the new  house, and Dad belting slabs into position with the back of the axe&mdash;they kept  up a great noise. You&rsquo;d think they were building the Federal capital.</p>
<p>Occasionally Dad,  with the axe on his shoulder, would stand some yards off from the building to  take observations &mdash;just as he would when making a hay-stack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does she  look?&rdquo; Joe would ask, and Dad would answer&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital; it will  be a neat little place when it&rsquo;s finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;d walk  round it, and adze splinters from the walls, and ram the loose earth tight  against the foot of the slabs with the heel of his boot.</p>
<p>Frequently the  neighbours passing by would ride in through the gate, and ask Dad what it was  he was putting up, and Dad would tell them, and ask what they thought of it,  and invite them to look through it. Most of them smiled, and thought it a very  nice place&mdash;at least, that&rsquo;s what they told Dad. But young Regan rode in one  day, and sat on his horse, and grinned disparagingly at the new house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad said  sulkily, &ldquo;what th&rsquo; devil&rsquo;s th&rsquo; matter with <i>you?</i>&rdquo;  Dad had no love for the Regans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wuz jus&rsquo;  wunderin&rsquo;,&rdquo; young Regan answered, &ldquo;if there wuz anythin&rsquo; th&rsquo; matter wi&rsquo; <i>you</i>; an&rsquo; if this is a private asylum y&rsquo;  puttin&rsquo; up fur y&rsquo;self t&rsquo; get into when it&rsquo;s finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; and  Dad rushed round in search of a batten, but young Regan had gone before he  could secure one from the pile.</p>
<p>Dave and Lily came  along one evening, and Dad put down the axe, and showed them over the place.  Lily looked inside, and stared at the grass on the ground floor, and the large  holes burnt in the partition, and said nothing. Most young wives go into  raptures over their first new house; exaggerate its beauty, and do their best  to make others believe it&rsquo;s a grander place than the architect meant it to be.  But Lily wasn&rsquo;t one of those; she hadn&rsquo;t much enthusiasm in her at all. Dad,  though, discoursed volubly about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strong built  little place,&rdquo; he said, walking from one room to the other. (There were two  rooms in the new house.) &ldquo;And every bit of it&rsquo;s well-nailed&mdash;all new nails, too;  an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be a queer storm that shifts it, believe me. These holes are  nothing,&rdquo; he went on, putting his foot through one in the partition, and  looking at Lily. &ldquo;Paste a bit of paper over them, or (his enthusiasm increased)  you can stand the safe there, and no one will ever see them&mdash; you will never  know they&rsquo;re there y&rsquo;self after a while.&rdquo; And Dad smiled in admiration of his  own originality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t there  be any floor boards at all?&rdquo; Lily murmured, with a sickly look at Dave, who was  standing gloomily beside her.</p>
<p>Dave looked at  Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll all be  done in good time,&rdquo; Dad said encouragingly, &ldquo;but y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t do everything at  once. All the best houses round the district had ground floors in them when  they were first put up. And,&rdquo; he added, tramping the floor hard with both feet,  &ldquo;this is very solid here, firm as a rock an&rsquo; when the grass comes off, and  there&rsquo;s a little sand and cow dung put on&mdash;I&rsquo;ll mix a bucketful to show y&rsquo; how  it&rsquo;s done&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be as good as any boards&mdash;every bit, and better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily made an  effort to say something, but a lump seemed to stick in her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them are fine  slabs,&rdquo; Dad rattled on, drawing Dave&rsquo;s attention to the walls; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no  timber to be got in the country like that nowadays&mdash;must be eighteen inches  wide, them slabs,&rdquo; proceeding to span one with his big hand, &ldquo;fully that,&rdquo; he  concluded, &ldquo;if not more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave didn&rsquo;t say anything.  Dad didn&rsquo;t give him an opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; Dad  continued, turning to the end of the building, &ldquo;what about a fireplace? Are y&rsquo;  going to have one, or will we put up a place outside in the front for y&rsquo; to  cook under?&rdquo; And he looked hard at Lily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h,&rdquo; Lily  whined feebly, clutching Dave by the shirt sleeve, &ldquo;we must have a fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad said  advisingly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not always an advantage, you know. In summer they make a  room that hot that there&rsquo;s no livin&rsquo; in a place where there&rsquo;s one; and when the  westerly winds are blowin&rsquo; in the winter the smoke from some of them would  drive a man cranky. I&rsquo;d never have one in a house meself if I were buildin&rsquo;  again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h, what would  be th&rsquo; good of it without a fireplace?&rdquo; Lily whined again, appealing to Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,  very well then,&rdquo; Dad put in, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s <i>you</i> that will have to put up with it&mdash;not <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would  be better,&rdquo; Dave drawled, supporting Lily&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orright! Orright!&rdquo;  Dad said, frowning, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look what timber there is, and if there&rsquo;s enough we&rsquo;ll  see about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad did look some  days after, but there wasn&rsquo;t enough timber.</p>
<p>After walking  round the outside of the house in silence, Lily and Dave turned away from it as  if it were a morgue they had been inspecting, and left in silence.</p>
<p>When about fifty  yards off they turned and took another look at it.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page118.jpg" alt="turned" width="561" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was  to be a different place to that,&rdquo; Lily moaned, &ldquo;and no verandah on it, either!&rdquo;  Then she started to cry, and said she would be ashamed to take anyone to such  an ugly den.</p>
<p>Dave began to  wake up. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you  don&rsquo;t think y&rsquo; will like it, Lil,&rdquo; he said, finding some courage, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go  back, and tell him to knock it down. I ain&rsquo;t afraid to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Lily  answered, wiping her eyes hurriedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind now. I don&rsquo;t care a  bit&mdash;it&rsquo;ll do. . . But we&rsquo;ll get a better one soon, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he can&rsquo;t get  out of it,&rdquo; Dave drawled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve his word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily was  satisfied, and clung lovingly to Dave&rsquo;s arm, and walked on smiling. But Lily  didn&rsquo;t know Dad then. She knows him a lot better now.</p>
<p>At last the house  was finished, and Dad gathered up the tools one evening, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, they can  go into it now as soon as they like.&rdquo; Then Dave and Lily pulled down their bed,  and collected all the miscellaneous pieces of furniture, and pots and pans and  things about the place which Mother said she didn&rsquo;t want&mdash;and a good many things  she didn&rsquo;t say anything at all about&mdash;and left us, and took possession of their  new home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  Dave and Lily Start Housekeeping</b></h2>
<p>Dave and Lily,  when they shifted into their new house, didn&rsquo;t give a ball or a party of any  kind to commemorate the occasion. They didn&rsquo;t believe in wasting money; they  went straight to work, and put up the bed, and arranged the odd pieces of  furniture they had gathered and annexed from our place. Then they sat down and  wiped the perspiration off themselves, and looked at one another across the  table, and silently contemplated their new surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no rations  in yet,&rdquo; Lily said, after a while, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;d put a fire on, and make you a cup of  tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dave  strolled down to Mother (it was nearly a quarter of a mile from Dave&rsquo;s house to  ours), and procured some tea and sugar, and a bottle of melon jam, and a supply  of bread and meat, which he carried back in a flour sack, and dumped down on  the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There y&rsquo; are,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;make your tea, and we&rsquo;ll have a feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly a day  passed but what Dave made several trips to our place in quest of something or  other. If it wasn&rsquo;t meat or a jug of milk, or the loan of a dish for Lily to  bake something in, that he came for, it would be for a few potatoes, or a  clothes prop, or the axe to cut a bit of wood with. In fact, every article for  use or consumption that they required, Dave came to us for the loan of&mdash;even to  Bill&rsquo;s bridle and Joe&rsquo;s saddle, until there was scarcely anything to be found  at our place at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the  fellow!&rdquo; Dad used to break out, when he&rsquo;d find the hammer or the axe was  missing, &ldquo;why th&rsquo; devil doesn&rsquo;t he bring the things back?&rdquo; Then he would yell  for Barty. And Barty would trudge up to Dave&rsquo;s place, and ask Dave if he had  the axe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs,&rdquo; Dave  would drawl from the sofa, where he&rsquo;d be employed studying an Australian song  book, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s out there ain&rsquo;t it, near the woodheap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barty would  carefully search for the woodheap first, then for the axe, and finally call  out, &ldquo;Tain&rsquo;t anywhere here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t up here at  all, then,&rdquo; Dave would answer, with calm indifference, and proceed to spell  over more songs.</p>
<p>But Lily, who had  a good memory, would recollect having seen it over near the tree. (The tree was  about a hundred yards off.) And in loud shrill tones would inform Barty of its  whereabouts. Dave then would remember where it was, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs,&rdquo; he would  call out, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where it is. But bring it back when you&rsquo;ve done with it. I  want it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants it  again,&rdquo; Barty would murmur, when delivering the axe to Dad. And Dad would  snort&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n him! . . . .  to the deuce with him! . . . . let him get a axe of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Often Lily would  require a few little things for the house, and she&rsquo;d come along herself, and  borrow them from Mother. Frequently it was a needle she would require&mdash;the one  she had was broke or perhaps it would be a bit of black cotton to patch Dave&rsquo;s  dark trousers with&mdash;she always had a good supply of white cotton. Sometimes she  had two reels of it&mdash;ours and her own. And whenever Lily would come, Sarah would  never show out, but when she was gone again, Sarah would emerge from one of the  rooms, and say to Mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name  of goodness is she after now? That&rsquo;s the third time this morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little  black thread, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Mother would answer kindly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s mending Davie&rsquo;s  dark tweeds.&rdquo; Then Sarah would snigger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it  nearly time? He&rsquo;s been going about with a big tear in those trousers, I&rsquo;m sure,  for the last fortnight&mdash;a thing he never can say he had to do when he was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never noticed  it,&rdquo; Mother would put in, seeking to excuse Lily, &ldquo;and he was here with them on  only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course,  you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Sarah would grin wickedly. &ldquo;He had his coat on.&rdquo; Sarah had a  good eye for seeing things.</p>
<p>But it was  humping water that kept Dave more in touch with our place than anything else.  Dave was always coming for water; when he wasn&rsquo;t coming for a bucket of water  he was marching off with one. The bucket was rarely out of Dave&rsquo;s hand. But he  might have saved himself a good many trips, though, if he had had a method. But  there was never anything methodical about Dave. The wonder is Dave ever was  born. Twice a day&mdash;when coming in for dinner, and after knocking off at night&mdash;he  would walk right through our place to get a drink at the tank, and after  gulping down two or three pints he&rsquo;d proceed leisurely home; then come back for  a bucketful for Lily.</p>
<p>Rarely did we  ever sit down to a meal without hearing someone at the tap. And we always knew  it was Dave getting a bucket of water. Dad used to wonder what Dave wanted so  much water for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it,&rdquo;  he&rsquo;d sometimes growl, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have the tank empty soon . . . . why th&rsquo; deuce  doesn&rsquo;t he go to the well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The well was only  about a mile and a-half away, too, but Dave never went near it. Somehow he&rsquo;d  rather draw on us for the last drop of our water than make one trip to the  well.</p>
<p>Now and again  Lily would give Dave a spell at humping water, and come herself with a small  new billy-can; but she only came on washing days. She washed on the same day  that Mother and Sarah did, but never at the same hour. She always started  later. She used to have to wait till they had finished with the tub. And always  when she came with the billy she would enquire when the tub would be available,  and tell Mother to give it to Dave when he would be passing through for dinner.  Mother always forgot to give the tub to Dave, and he would stroll home  empty-handed, and run back for it when Lily asked him where it was.</p>
<p>The tub was a  humbug to Dave. And he always had to put his head and whiskers inside it to  carry it. He couldn&rsquo;t manage it any other way, because he always took two  buckets of water with him as well. Those were the only occasions when Dave  showed any ingenuity. And a beautiful figure he cut, too, hobbling along the  track under the tub! People passing down the road used to shout derisively to  him, but Dave would never look round.</p>
<p>Joe witnessed  Dave&rsquo;s departure one day, and armed himself with a lot of old potatoes to give  him a send-off. And when Dave started to stagger away, Joe struck the tub with  a potato, at which Barty guffawed. Dave stopped and swung steadily round like a  large vessel turning in a river, and swore inside the tub. Dad came round the  corner of the house, and saw Dave and laughed. Dad was in a good humour that  day. He had just received a cheque for &pound;240 from the sale of some bullocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo&mdash;hoo&mdash;hoo!&rdquo;  Dad rumbled, and on the strength of Dad&rsquo;s merriment Joe aimed another potato at  Dave and struck the front of the tub. Then Dad changed his manner. We never  knew anyone to change his manner so rapidly and completely as Dad used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n it!&rdquo; he  roared at Joe, &ldquo;what th&rsquo; devil are y&rsquo; wasting good potatoes for? Confound it!  Go away, man, and do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dave said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens! if  any of them hits me some o&rsquo; you will remember it.&rdquo; And he swung round again and  ploughed up the track, irrigating both sides of it with spray from the buckets  as he wobbled along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And during  washing-days Sarah, though she wasn&rsquo;t speaking to Lily, kept a close eye on the  latter&rsquo;s clothes line. And when Lily would be hanging out her things, Sarah,  from the back verandah, would take stock of them, then go inside, and say to  Mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two shirts of  Dave&rsquo;s, a quilt, a handkerchief and two or three little things of her own is  all she put through, I declare; and she&rsquo;s been all the evening doing that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Mother  wouldn&rsquo;t encourage further disparagement of Lily&rsquo;s labours, Sarah would return  to the verandah, and view the line again and soliloquise&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When y&rsquo; had <i>me</i> t&rsquo; do it for y&rsquo; me lady, you could  put out big enough washings, so y&rsquo; could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah had all the  qualifications of a generous woman.</p>
<p>Dave and Lily  became accustomed to their new house, and forgot all about its size and  shapelessness. Dave began to take a pride in the establishment, too, and in his  spare moments dug up some ground in front of the door to make a flower garden.  But no flowers ever grew in Dave&rsquo;s garden. They never got any encouragement to  grow. Dave never put any in. And people going in and out of the house paid no  respect to the ground that was dug up; they always tramped across it as if it  were a grass paddock, till it got flattened down and became harder than it was  before Dave cultivated it. Then Dave thought it &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t good enough,&rdquo; and  decided to let it slide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use  thinkin&rsquo; about it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;till I get some palings to put round it, and keep  the people off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad put in an  appearance one Sunday morning at Dave&rsquo;s place while Dave was away, watering  cows at the windmill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad said  to Lily, &ldquo;how do you like the new house, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,  Father,&rdquo; Lily answered contentedly, &ldquo;except that the door gets jambed a little  somehow lately. It won&rsquo;t shut like it used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Dad said,  taking hold of the elegant door he had manufactured from some light slabs, and  hung with green-hide hinges, &ldquo;h&rsquo;m.&rdquo; And he shoved it shut with his two hands,  and violently dragged it open again; then he got down on his knees, and  scratched some of the ground floor away, and blew into the excavation with his  mouth, and examined the bottom hinge with both his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me soul,&rdquo;  he exclaimed, &ldquo;no wonder. Someone&rsquo;s taken the nails out of the hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily bent down,  and peered over Dad&rsquo;s shoulder at the hinge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one took them  out, Father,&rdquo; she said meekly; &ldquo;they must have worked out themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; Dad  snarled, &ldquo;those nails would never work out, woman&mdash;I drove them in meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have,  though, Father,&rdquo; Lily persisted humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, &rsquo;ow in th&rsquo;  devil could they?&rdquo; Dad yelled, jumping to his feet, and facing his &ldquo;daughter&rsquo;&rsquo;  with murder in his eye.</p>
<p>Lily was startled  and tottered back against the table, and clutched the edge of it, and stared at  Dad. That was the first real taste Lily got of Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could they?&rdquo;  Dad repeated. &ldquo;If they could, then why th&rsquo; devil haven&rsquo;t all of them that I put  in the slabs and the rafters and the shingles worked out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad, glaring at  Lily, paused for an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;  she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  Dad shouted, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll tell y&rsquo;&mdash;because they couldn&rsquo;t for one thing, and  because no one has ever touched them for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily stared in  silence and confusion at the floor, and wished Dave would come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worked out!&rdquo; Dad  growled contemptuously, turning round to the action of the door again, &ldquo;rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then after a  pause&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have y&rsquo; got th&rsquo;  hammer here?&rdquo; turning the whites of his eyes up at Lily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes, I think&mdash;&rdquo;  (Lily paused, and looked nervously about the room). &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she jerked  out faintly, &ldquo;you have it at your own place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first  time it&rsquo;s ever been there, then,&rdquo; Dad growled &ldquo;if I were down there, and wanted  it a hundred times it would be up here.&rdquo; And pulling open the door again, he  went off to procure the hammer.</p>
<p>But Dad never  returned to fix the door. He found Grey waiting for him when he reached his own  house, and took him round to show him some young pigs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Lily&rsquo;s Mother Arrives</b></h2>
<p>Lily came one  morning and borrowed our pen and ink, and wrote a letter to her Mother.</p>
<p><i>Dear Mother </i>(it ran),<i> I&rsquo;ve been expecting to hear from some of  yous every day, and I have not got a letter yet. It&rsquo;s just five munce to-morrer,  dear Mother, since we got married, and it only seems like a week. When are you  coming to see us. Make up your mind when you come and stay a month. And Cissy  could come and stay another month after you go back. I am sure she will enjoy  herself. It would be a change for her, and we would be glad to have her with  us. This is a real nice place. We have got our own house now, dear Mother,  which is ever so much nicer than being in someone else&rsquo;s, where you never felt  you could do what you liked, though they were all very kind and all that,  except Sarah, who is Dave&rsquo;s sister and is getting to be an old maid. But Dave  said for me not to take any notice of her, and I never do now. Dear Mother, I  have not much news to tell you, and I have Dave&rsquo;s dinner to get. He is  chaff-cutting to-day, and will soon be coming. Dear Mother, there is some very  nice people here, and we often have them for company. A Mrs. Pills, whose  husband knows Father, lost her baby yesterday, and it is to be buried to-day.  The day before it took sick there was nothing whatever the matter with it, but  it took convulshuns, and before Mr. Pills could get enough hot water to put it  in the poor little thing was dead. It was Mrs. Pill&rsquo;s first baby too, and  everyone about is so sorry over it.</i></p>
<p><i>P.S.&mdash;Dave is here now, and he has brought some eggs  and a young kitten. With love to all at home.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remain, dear  Mother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your  affectionate daughter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LILY  RUDD</i></p>
<p>And in due course  Lily&rsquo;s mother sent an answer, saying she &ldquo;hoped it would find Lily and Dave  quite well and in good health and spirits as it left her at present, thank God,&rdquo;  and accepted the invitation to stay a month, and named the day on which she  would arrive at the railway station, and hoped Dave would meet her.</p>
<p>When the day came  round Lily was all impatience and excitement. She rose a couple of hours  earlier than usual, and began making preparations; decorated the place&mdash;nailed  bags, and newspaper pictures, and things all over the inside of it. She came to  Mother during the morning, too, for some baking soda, and went back, and made a  dishful of burnt scones. Altogether, she came to Mother about sixteen times  during the morning for one thing and another, and every time told her how  pleased she was that &ldquo;Mother was coming,&rdquo; and discoursed about her parent&rsquo;s age  and the colour of her hair before it turned gray, and the length of it, and the  good teeth she had, and promised to bring her down some evening to see Mother.  Lily didn&rsquo;t tell Sarah anything about her parent, though. Sarah was never  present when Lily was about, but Sarah was interested in the old lady&rsquo;s visit  for all that.</p>
<p>Sarah used to  listen to everything Lily said, and when the latter had left would drop in with  a broom in her hand, and sweep vigorously round Mother where there was no dirt  or dust. After putting in a few useless strokes with the broom Sarah would toss  her loose hair back, and leaning on the handle remark&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful  thing, isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;her Mother coming? . . . You&rsquo;d think no one else ever had a  mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mother  wouldn&rsquo;t encourage Sarah to ridicule her sister.</p>
<p>Mother had been  young herself once, and understood the peculiarities of women. And women&rsquo;s  peculiarities are many and varied&mdash;especially young women.</p>
<p>At midday Dave  left the chaff-cutting, and yoked a horse in the spring cart to go to the  railway station for his mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Dad, on a round  of inspection, entered the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s up  now?&rdquo; he asked, staring in astonishment at Dave perched in the cart when he  should have been employed cutting chaff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to the  railway for Mother,&rdquo; Dave said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For who?&rdquo; Dad  yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Dave  repeated, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; ter-day, didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad swung his two  hands about as if he were engaged in a hammer-throwing competition, and, hobbling  round the cart, looked up hard at Dave from the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are y&rsquo; mad,  feller?&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;why, bless me soul, ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo; Mother in th&rsquo; house?&rdquo; And Dad  tried to force a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! I don&rsquo;t  mean her,&rdquo; Dave sniggered, &ldquo;me other Mother&mdash;Lill&rsquo;s ol&rsquo; woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second or  two Dad just stared at Dave with all his eyes and mouth. Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ve  got so many d&mdash; mothers that you&rsquo;ve got to waste a  whole day runnin&rsquo; about at their tails with a horse and cart, then the sooner  y&rsquo; go and work with some of them altogether th&rsquo; better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave was hurt in  his dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By cripes, then,&rdquo;  he growled, &ldquo;if y&rsquo;r not careful, I will.&rdquo; And he drove off.</p>
<p>Dave had to drive  to the yard gate, then wheel round, and come down along the fence to reach the  road. Dad cut across to intercept him, and, hanging over the wires, yelled&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;  to look after my chaff while you&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; about the d&mdash; country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> can,&rsquo;&rsquo; Dave shouted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re so  beggarin&rsquo; smart.&rdquo; And he rattled on to the road, leaving nothing but dust and  wheel tracks behind for Dad to swear at.</p>
<p>While Dave was  away at the railway station Lily swept up the ground in front of the new house,  and gathered the loose chips and bones and empty tins that were lying about and  stacked them in a heap; then she sat back near the door and hummed tunes, and  watched the road for signs of the cart&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>Towards sundown  Dave, with a sinewy, talkative, little woman beside him in the cart, came  trotting up to the big white gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the  place?&rdquo; the little woman, who was Dave&rsquo;s mother-in-law, asked, fixing her small  brown eyes in an admiring kind of way on our place with all the fruit trees and  barn and outbuildings and yards and haystacks about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuh,&rdquo; Dave said  cheerfully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s th&rsquo; ol&rsquo; chap&rsquo;s&mdash; our&rsquo;s is the new place further up.&rdquo; And he  swung the whip round his head, indicating pretty well every part of the  compass.</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s place,  sitting among the grass, was plain enough for Mrs. White to see as they drove  up, but the fact didn&rsquo;t occur to her that it was a dwelling, and she looked  over the top of it, straining her eyes at Grey&rsquo;s big house, the roof of which  was just visible in the dim distance. But when Dave suddenly cried, &ldquo;Woh,&rdquo; and  pulled up in front of his door, and Lily rushed to the wheel to greet her, Mrs.  White noticed it was a residence, and her countenance took a turn. It changed  suddenly. The look of joyous, lively expectation it had worn all the way from  the railway station left it, and she seemed inclined to remain in the cart, as  if the drive hadn&rsquo;t lasted half long enough for her.</p>
<p>Dave, with the  air of an advance agent for a circus, hopped out as nimble and light-footed as  a goat. You&rsquo;d think it was the Queen, or Melba, or a gold escort he was in  charge of, not his mother-in-law at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a hold  of y&rsquo;, Mother,&rdquo; he said, extending his big hairy hand to the amazed-looking  passenger, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll help y&rsquo; out.&rdquo; (And she looked as if she wanted helping out  some, too.) And without uttering a word&mdash;without even taking her eyes off the  house, Mrs. White scrambled to the ground. Then Lily pounced on her, and hugged  her hard and repeatedly, and told her how pleased she was to see her again. And  Dave said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for y&rsquo;selves  there,&rdquo; and started the horse again, and drove to the stable to take the brute  out of the cart, and left his mother-in-law&rsquo;s handbag in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean  to tell me, girl,&rdquo; Mrs. White said, when Lily took her inside, &ldquo;that this is  the place you&rsquo;re living in?&rdquo; And she stared all round with misery and tears in  her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is,&rdquo;  Lily answered apologetically, &ldquo;but you know, Mother, we couldn&rsquo;t get on very  well together in the other house, and this was put up in a great hurry when  they were all so busy. But it&rsquo;s only for a while&mdash;Mr. Rudd means to have a real  good house built for us soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. White  wrinkled her brow, and stared disparagingly at the inoffensive-looking  furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no place  for a man to bring his wife to,&rdquo; she said warmly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not  happy in it, girl. I&rsquo;d sooner see you camping under a dray, so I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not for  long, Mother,&rdquo; Lily said, with an effort to appear cheerful, &ldquo;we might be out  of it anytime, now.&rdquo; But Lily&rsquo;s mother, though weedy-looking and grey, was a  stubborn little person, and had some deep-rooted convictions as to what a  comfortable dwelling should be like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it had  been put up well enough,&rdquo; she snapped, gazing at the coalition roof&mdash;a mixture  of decayed shingle and kerosine-tin flattened out with a hammer&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not big  enough for a pigeon box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after  lowering her eyes and making further discoveries&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, oh dear!  why there isn&rsquo;t a board on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wanted  them to put&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lily, it&rsquo;s a <i>shame</i>,&rdquo; Mrs. White squealed,  interrupting: her daughter, &ldquo;and if they can&rsquo;t afford a better house for you to  live in than this, then you must come back home. . . . , I never saw such a  place. . . . It&rsquo;s worse than a lock-up&mdash;I&rsquo;d sooner be in a lock-up. . . . . It&rsquo;s  a pig-sty. . . . To take you away from your good home, too, and dump you here  in such a kennel! Oh dear, dear, what a sin! (lifting her voice to a shriek).  It&rsquo;s a crime; and if you catch your death of cold in it, my girl, it will be <i>murder</i> . . . . and I&rsquo;ll tell him as soon  as he comes in.&rdquo; And Mrs. White would have walked up and down, too, she was so  angry, but there wasn&rsquo;t any room for exercising in Dave&rsquo;s house. Dave&rsquo;s house  wasn&rsquo;t built for a gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mother,&rsquo;&rsquo;  Lily pleaded, the tears running down her cheeks, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t do that&mdash;don&rsquo;t say  anything to Dave about it. It&rsquo;s not his fault. He has done all he can do. It&rsquo;s  old Mr. Rudd&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell <i>him</i> what I think of the house he has put  you into&mdash;and what I think of him, too!&rdquo; Mrs. White, screeched, shaking her head  angrily. &ldquo;How would he like to see his own daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Lily heard  Dave coming along whistling up the track, and silencing her Mother, hurried to  lay the table for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mother,&rdquo;  Dave said, bowling in with a broad grin on his bearded face, &ldquo;what d&rsquo; y&rsquo; think  of our castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blood rushed  to Mrs. White&rsquo;s cheeks, but she kept down her emotions pretty well, and with a  fair amount of composure said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you  don&rsquo;t intend to live in it all your life, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by Jove,  no,&rdquo; Dave answered with glad assurance, &ldquo;a new five-roomed place soon&mdash;out of  the next barley. Th&rsquo; ol&rsquo; man was talking about it only this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know  what old men are, and I&rsquo;d keep him to it,&rdquo; Mrs. White said, with another shake  of her head, and she said it in a disagreeably pleasant way, too. Mrs. White  had a lot of intuition about her. She had never seen Dad in her life, yet she  seemed to know the kind of man he was just by studying Dave&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come on,&rdquo;  Dave said, changing the subject, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll have something to eat.&rdquo; And &ldquo;we&rdquo;  gathered round, and sat at supper, and the meal passed off almost in silence.  Dave, never a brilliant conversationalist, was too hungry to talk, and Lily was  kept too busy pouring out tea for him to say much, while the odd scraps of  furniture and the poverty-stricken appearance of the walls, and the patched  roof, with the moon and stars peeping through at her, absorbed most of Mrs.  White&rsquo;s troubled thoughts. Now and then she would glance uneasily from the  little broken-down couch on which she sat, to the entrance to the bedroom,  which was screened by a dangling sack, as though the solution of some serious  problem was agitating her mind&mdash;whether she was to seek repose for the night on  the couch or under Dave&rsquo;s bed, or on the top of the house? But she didn&rsquo;t  reveal her thoughts.</p>
<p>Dave finished  eating and broke in on the silence.</p>
<p>He said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got another &pound;250  cheque for bullocks this morning, Lil,&rdquo; and leaned back as if he were Jimmy  Tyson, the millionaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; Lily  answered, opening her eyes in astonishment, &ldquo;Another &pound;250, that&rsquo;s &pound;500 the last  fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs,&rdquo; Dave  drawled, stooping down and handing the cat a plug of meat on the end of a fork.  Then turning slowly to Mrs. White&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good  price I got, Mother&mdash;&pound;500 for sixty three-year-old bullocks, and I&rsquo;ll have more  ready in a month.&rdquo; Dave&rsquo;s mother-in-law&rsquo;s countenance underwent another change;  her eyes lit up, and she stared at her son-in-law as though she had suddenly  discovered he was an unpretentious millionaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s is all  that money?&rdquo; she asked, to make certain her surmise was correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ours,&rdquo; Dave  said, &ldquo;my colonial!&rdquo; and helped the cat to more meat.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. White  stared harder than ever at Dave, and looked around again at the miserable  wretched furniture, and smiled an incredulous smile, until Lily thought it  proper to make an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, we  don&rsquo;t get all that money, Dave,&rdquo; Lily said, looking at her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Dave  drawled, addressing his mother-in-law&mdash; &ldquo;th&rsquo; ol&rsquo; man gets it . . . but we all  make it, you know . . . . it belongs to the lot of us . . . . when we want  anything,&rdquo; he went on for her general information, &ldquo;we get it; don&rsquo;t matter  what it is&mdash;a horse or a cart; trip to town; beef or rations; a few bob;  anythin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s always there. Lil gets what she wants, too, just the same  (turning to Lil with a grin). I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; down in the mornin&rsquo; to ask th&rsquo; ol&rsquo; man  for a quid. Wonder what he&rsquo;ll say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father  has everything, then?&rdquo; Mrs. White said, this time with a pained, puzzled  expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Dave  answered, &ldquo;everything&mdash;&rsquo;cept Lil,&rdquo; and then he grinned.</p>
<p>But Mrs. White  didn&rsquo;t join in Dave&rsquo;s joke. She scowled and sat considering hard. And after  awhile she looked compassionately at Lily, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t  know where you&rsquo;re going to put me, child, but I feel quite done up, and must go  to bed somewhere or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily explained  that Dave would sleep on the floor in the front room, and that her Mother could  take his place in her bed. Then apologising to Dave for leaving him in the dark  she took the lamp, and showed her Mother the way in. Dave, with his boots off, and  his feet resting on the table, sat planning the programme for the morrow&rsquo;s  work.</p>
<p>After a while  Lily called out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you take a  bag of Mother&rsquo;s out of the cart, Dave?&rdquo; Dave reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I  never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must be  in it yet,&rdquo; Lily answered anxiously, coming out of the room, &ldquo;an&rsquo; she wants it.  Her nightgown is in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; Dave  grunted, &ldquo;wish I&rsquo;d known before pullin&rsquo; off me boots. Those coves have had the  cart out since, too, gettin&rsquo; green stuff for the pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then dragging his  bluchers on again he trudged off to the shed.</p>
<p>Dave struck a  match and searched the cart, but no bag was there. Flaring lights and a lot of  noise and rioting going on in the barn attracted him. He went to the door and  looked in. Joe was there careering round in the night-dress, and swinging the  hand-bag about, while Bill and Tom and Barty laughed and husked cobs, and threw  them at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Dave said  indignantly, stepping in and approaching Joe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for that; why  couldn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; leave it where it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Joe  chuckled, dragging the garment over his hat,, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s yours, is it? Is that what  you wear when you get married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huskers  laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do all married  coves have to wear them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>More mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo;  Dave answered seriously, snatching the long white robe from Joe, and marching  off with it over his arm like a coat, and carrying the bag in his hand. And as  he went out a cob of corn struck the side of the door in close proximity to his  head, scattering grains all around like a charge of shot, one of which stung  Dave in the ear.</p>
<p>Dave jumped  round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who th&rsquo;  deuce was that?&rdquo; he said, running his eye over the others.</p>
<p>Bill and Tom  dropped their heads between their knees and giggled and husked vigorously. Joe,  standing in the middle of the floor, gave a short laugh, and Barty, with a  guilty look on his face, rose to his feet, and began looking for openings in  the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You crawler!&rdquo;  Dave said, rushing at Barty, and flogging him round the barn with the  ornamental end of the nightdress. Unable to escape, Barty turned in a corner,  and stood at bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fling another o&rsquo;  y&rsquo; cobs at me, will y&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dave hissed, slashing again at him.</p>
<p>Barty showed his  teeth, and seized hold of the garment, and clung to it. Dave gave a fierce  wrench to release it, and all the frills came away with a rip and a tear, and  remained with Barty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens,  you&rsquo;ve tore it,&rdquo; Dave said, alarmed-looking, and he paused to examine the  damage. Then Barty left the corner with a bound, and bolted for the door; loud  boisterous laughter rang after him, and the north and south ends of him were  hit hard with cobs and small pumpkins as he dived through into the darkness,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get it?&rdquo;  Lily asked, as Dave strode in with the habiliment in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs, I got it  alright,&rdquo; Dave said, tossing the garment to her.</p>
<p>Lily stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness me, you  needn&rsquo;t have opened it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t open  it,&rdquo; Dave answered, starting to pull off his boots again, and Lily turned, and  went in to her Mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth  has happened to it?&rdquo; Mrs. White exclaimed, &ldquo;it was rolled in brown paper in my  bag. . . . I do declare the dogs or something have been at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two-leg-ged  d-o-r-g-s,&rdquo; Dave drawled, planting his big stockinged feet on the table again,  and leaning back contentedly. And as he reflected on the episode the humour of  it all seemed to strike him, and lifting his voice, he added&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wer&rsquo; Joe&mdash;the  geoat! He had it on when I went down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a low  rumbling noise, intended for a laugh, came from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had it on,&rdquo; Mrs.  White shrieked from the bedroom, &ldquo;my nightgown! . . . Who&mdash;why&mdash;what? Oh, the  savages; take it away, Lily; I wouldn&rsquo;t have it near me&mdash; take it away, child,  and give me my petticoat. . . . My gracious me, what kind of barbarians are you  amongst at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are y&rsquo; in, Dave?&rdquo;  a harsh voice called from outside.</p>
<p>Dave recognising  it, shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in,  Jimmy . . . what are y&rsquo; after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jimmy Regan,  the wild harum-scarum of the district, groped his way in at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find a seat  somewhere there, Jimmy,&rdquo; Dave said, hospitably, &ldquo;light&rsquo;ll be here directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo;  Jimmy rejoined, speaking in a loud voice, and leaning against the wall, &ldquo;got to  go round to old Gray yet to see if he&rsquo;ll stump out the couple of days he owes  me brother for thrashing. But what I&rsquo;ve come for is the loan of a nag. . . .  Can y&rsquo; lend us one to go to town on to-morrer, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave required  some time to consider, and Jimmy rattled on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw y&rsquo; flyin&rsquo;  along from the railway this evenin&rsquo;, Dave, but you were too high up to look my  way. . . . Who was the ol&rsquo; girl with all the ribbons and things on that you was  buckin&rsquo; up t&rsquo; in the cart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave shuffled his  feet uneasily. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The thinnest  armful I ever see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave tried to  shove the table down to make a noise, but it was built into the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens, she  were a freak. And the way she&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Jimmy was  suddenly interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that  brute saying, Lily?&rdquo; came in shrill tones from the interior of the bedroom.</p>
<p>Dave didn&rsquo;t wait  to hear any more. He sprang to his feet, and kicked over a gin case, which  hardly made any noise, either, and groped in the dark for Jimmy, and said  quietly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy followed  Dave, and they walked a short distance from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil&rsquo;s  th&rsquo; matter,&rdquo; Jimmy asked, standing and staring into Dave&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She heerd y&rsquo;,&rdquo;  Dave answered, in low cautious tones, &ldquo;dash y&rsquo;, she heerd everythin&rsquo; y&rsquo; said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that weren&rsquo;t  th&rsquo; wife&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; Jimmy replied, more mystified than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; from Dave,  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me mother-in-law though. Didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; know it was her I was bringin&rsquo; in th&rsquo;  cart? &rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy jumped in the  air.</p>
<p>Jimmy was  enlightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oly!&rdquo; he  exclaimed, stepping back a pace and looking more concerned than ever, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t I  put me foot in it? Why didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; give us a &rsquo;int?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dave, in his  own agreeable fashion, excused Jimmy; told him it didn&rsquo;t matter, and added that  he could have the loan of a horse in the morning if he came up for it before  the old man was up. </p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Eavens!&rdquo; Jimmy  chuckled, at the sound of Mrs. White&rsquo;s voice again, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s rearin&rsquo; yet.&rdquo; And  turning to go away, he said, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go in there again, Dave, without a  gun, for the best horse you&rsquo;ve got in the paddock, and a billet all the year  round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave grinned in  the dark, and without any gun, went inside and faced the music for nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Lily&rsquo;s Mother Meets Dad</b></h2>
<p>Tired and all as  Mrs. White was, and notwithstanding she shared the best bed in the house, she  hardly slept a wink that night, and blamed Dave for her bad night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard  such a man to snore,&rdquo; she said complainingly to Lily in the morning&mdash;&ldquo;the whole  blessed night he simply roared and groaned. It was hideous. I don&rsquo;t know how on  earth you stand it, girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, but he&rsquo;s  always so tired, Mother, after his hard day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; Lily answered, putting on  her clothes, &ldquo;and see how early he goes to the yard. He has always to dress  himself by lamplight. But I never notice him snoring much now. He&rsquo;s not nearly  so bad as he used to be.&rdquo; And she went out to prepare the breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; Mrs.  White sighed, and turned over in the bed.</p>
<p>A glorious early  autumn morning; the air clear and crisp; all was life and stir at Ruddville;  families of cockatoos clambered and chattered up the gully; small birds chirped  and &ldquo;tweeked&rdquo; from the trees and the fence tops; a stock whip cracked at  intervals in the big grass paddock; the horses came galloping and careering in;  a mob of cows of every colour gathered at the yard, and a hundred calves were  bellowing in the pens.</p>
<p>Mrs. White rose,  and went out into the fresh air, and stood studying the scene. At intervals she  would turn from the picture that our place, with the green trees and rows of  great haystacks about it, presented, to Dave&rsquo;s grotesque little house, the grim  ludicrous aspect of which was accentuated by the light of day, and shake her  grey head, and murmur plaintively, &ldquo;Dear, dear, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A number of cows  that had been milked and released in the yard wandered up and surrounded Dave&rsquo;s  place, sniffing and licking the ground where Lily had thrown the salt dish  water. All sleek, well-bred cows, too, with roomy fleshless udders, and Mrs.  White was admiring them when Dave staggered up the track, carrying a jug of  milk for the breakfast in one hand, a bucket of water in the other, a leg rope,  that he was to mend, over one arm, a half coil of wire to make a clothes line  out of, round his neck, a billy of ripe tomatoes which Mother brought to the  yard for him to give to Lily, in his teeth, and a large crown pumpkin on his  head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Mother!&rdquo;  Dave said, through his nose, &ldquo;them&rsquo;s good milkers,&rdquo; and he staggered inside,  breathing noisily, and unloaded himself.</p>
<p>Dave poured some  of the water into a dish, and sluiced himself with it. Then he joined Mrs.  White, and rubbing his face and beard hard with the towel to dry himself, said,  looking at the cattle&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t often  see cows like them, Mother . . . That&rsquo;s the little milker (pointing to a red  beast): if you had a thousand like her you&rsquo;d be worth something. Twenty-five  quarts a day she&rsquo;s been givin&rsquo; for the last eleven munce, an&rsquo; I got her for ten  poun&rsquo;s . . . . Woh, Beauty . . . poor little Beauty . . . . (approaching the brute,  and nibbing and scratching her back affectionately). That&rsquo;s the sort of cow,  Mother can milk her anywhere. Know anything about a cow, Mother? (Dave stepped  back from the cow, and grinned a learned sort of grin). &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t everyone does. Th&rsquo;  ol&rsquo; man&rsquo;s been among cattle all his life, and he can&rsquo;t tell one yet.&rdquo; Running  his eye through the cattle, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think that one there&rsquo;d give a good lot o&rsquo;  milk, wouldn&rsquo;t y&rsquo;?&rdquo; pointing out a strawberry with a low dragging udder.</p>
<p>Mrs. White  thought the cow would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she don&rsquo;t  give enough to keep a kid,&rdquo; Dave chuckled. &ldquo;See that little cow there? (Mrs.  White did.) Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t think that that big brindle bullock just coming up  here was a son of hers?&rdquo; And Dave grinned an admiring kind of grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break-fust!&rdquo;  Lily called from the house, and Dave, giving his hairy arms a final scrub with  the towel, started to lead the way in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;Th&rsquo;  Queen,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shooing&rdquo; an old warrior out of the way, as he approached the  door. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the cow that poked Mother. . . . I was nearly shooting her, too,  for it . . . . th&rsquo; ol&rsquo; devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat down to  breakfast, and Dave piled sufficient salt junk and fried potatoes on his  Mother-in-law&rsquo;s plate to satisfy several men. Dave was not a mean man with meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good  bit o&rsquo; meat, Mother,&rdquo; Dave said, munching ravenously himself, &ldquo;a great little  bullock that came off o&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mrs. White merely nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill all our own  beef, Mother,&rdquo; Dave went on, with pride in his eye, &ldquo;them spuds is all our own  growin&rsquo;, too. . . . &rsquo;Spose y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t see many spuds like them down your way, eh,  Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. White  remarked that the potatoes they got at Prosperity were very good, indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, though,&rdquo;  Dave enthused, &ldquo;y&rsquo; want to see th&rsquo; ones we have in the bottom paddick&mdash;they&rsquo;re  whoppers. (Turning to his wife with hunger still lurking in his eye) &ldquo;Any o&rsquo; th&rsquo;  melon jam left, Lil.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily produced a  pickle bottle half full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all our  own makin&rsquo;, Mother,&rdquo; Dave continued, upending the bottle, and raking the  contents into his plate with a table knife.</p>
<p>Mrs. White stared  at Dave&rsquo;s plate, then at the empty bottle, but didn&rsquo;t say anything. She didn&rsquo;t  help herself to any jam, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dave  yawned, contentedly, rising from the table, and stretching out his arms, which  reached from one wall to the other, &ldquo;think I&rsquo;ll go down now, and tackle th&rsquo; ol&rsquo;  chap for that pound, Lil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry  for it,&rdquo; his wife answered, carelessly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be wanting it for a day or two  yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well  get it, and be done with it, though, while I think of it,&rdquo; Dave replied, and  putting on his hat, went off whistling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old man  must be making piles of money,&rdquo; Mrs. White said reflectively, standing at the  door when Dave had departed, and gazing again over Ruddville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea  how much he&rsquo;s getting, Mother!&rdquo; Lily said, her cheeks starting to glow with  pride of relationship to Dad. &ldquo;Ninety pounds a month Dave says he gets for  milk. I forget what the cheque was he got this year for wheat&mdash;whether it was  four hundred or five. There was five hundred pounds I know for bullocks, and  sixty or eighty for pigs. Then look at all the chaff and other things he sells;  and he has ever so much land&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how many thousand acres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Mrs.  White sighed, with a gloomy shake of the head, &ldquo;with all that money this is the  kind of place he puts up for his son to live in. What a mean, miserable old  vagabond he must be.&rdquo; And she turned her head, and cast another sickly glance  at the interior of Dave&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>Lily turned  crimson. Her enthusiasm suddenly left her, and she plunged into the breakfast  things to clear them away.</p>
<p>In half an hour  Dave returned, but he wasn&rsquo;t whistling. He was pale as a ghost, and in a  violent temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cripes,&rdquo; he  said, dropping on the couch and striking the table hard with his old felt hat,&rdquo;  &ldquo;he&rsquo;s an old dog . . . by Christopher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth  has happened?&rdquo; Lily asked, alarmed-looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happened? . . .  . By cripes! A good job for him he&rsquo;s not someone else&rsquo;s father, or something <i>would</i> have happened By the war!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely to  goodness you haven&rsquo;t been quarrelling over that blessed pound?&rdquo; Lily put in  apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he offered me  ten pounds I wouldn&rsquo;t take it now,&rdquo; Dave yelled striking the table again with  his hat. &ldquo;By heavens! he&rsquo;s a thankless old wretch. . . . By cripes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take  any notice of him, Dave, I&rsquo;d just&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s an old  devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t  have asked him for anything this morning, Dave, if he was in a tem&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By cripes, he&rsquo;ll  wait a long time before I&rsquo;ll ask him for anything again! By holy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dave put on  his hat, and walked round the house several times muttering &ldquo;By cripes! By holy!&rdquo;  and when the torrent of his wrath subsided took the coil of wire, and went off  to erect the clothes line.</p>
<p>An hour later.  Dad appeared. He approached the spot where Dave was struggling with the clothes  line, and roared&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much more d&mdash;time  are y&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to waste up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Mr.  Rudd,&rdquo; Lily, terrified-looking, whispered to her Mother, on hearing Dad&rsquo;s  voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my hat?&rdquo;  Mrs. White cried, glancing hurriedly about the room, with fire flashing from  her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go  out, Mother, I wouldn&rsquo;t; he&rsquo;s in a fearful temper,&rdquo; Lily pleaded, &ldquo;now, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. White  snatched up the hat nearest to her, an old one of Lily&rsquo;s, and out she stepped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the hay to be  left there rotting while you&rsquo;re idling and humbugging&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad stopped  short, and glared round on hearing the voice of a female beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Rudd?&rdquo;  Mrs. White said, with a tremor in her voice, squaring herself in front of Dad,  and looking up into his angry face.</p>
<p>Dad glowered down  at Mrs. White in the way that a bulldog, in the act of worrying something,  might turn to contemplate the unexpected presence of a cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lily&rsquo;s mother&rdquo;  (throwing a swift glance back at the house, in the open door of which stood  Lily with her hands clasped before her).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad  growled, &ldquo;what if you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I want to  ask you if you think that a humpy like that (Mrs. White pointed her lean finger  contemptuously at Dave&rsquo;s house) is a fit place for a woman to live in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad was  astounded. He opened his mouth and eyes, and for a moment or two glared in  astonishment.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what in the  devil have you to do with it?&rdquo; he bellowed, bending down and poking his beard  right into Mrs. White&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal&mdash;a  great deal&mdash;I have <i>everything</i> to do with  it,&rdquo; Mrs. White screeched, stamping her little foot and clenching her bony  fists, &ldquo;and just don&rsquo;t you think you can frighten me; and don&rsquo;t you use your  low language on me, either. I am that girl&rsquo;s mother, and if you think any old  pig-sty of a place that doesn&rsquo;t cost you anything to put up is good enough to  throw her into, then I tell you it&rsquo;s like your impudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it <i>your</i> place?&rdquo; Dad shouted. &ldquo;Did I put it  up for <i>you?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my  place, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what th&rsquo;  devil brings y&rsquo; here talkin&rsquo; t&rsquo; me about it for? Be off with you, woman, and  mind your own business.&rdquo; And Dad threw up his arms to wave her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> my business, and I won&rsquo;t be off, not  a single inch,&rdquo; Mrs. White shrieked, stamping her foot again, &ldquo;when I see the  wretched shed that you ask my daughter to live in, it&rsquo;s my business to tell you  that you ought to be well ashamed of yourself, so you ought. Look at it  (pointing her finger again at Dave&rsquo;s house). Look at it&mdash;look at the hole you  ask her to live in&mdash;not a chimney&mdash;not even a verandah, nothing but a pile of  dirty old slabs and shingles that would never keep out a drop of rain. They&rsquo;re  not even nailed on properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away with  your insolence, woman,&rdquo; Dad broke out, violently. &ldquo;Confound you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fit to  house calves in. There&rsquo;s are hundreds of calf-pens palaces in comparison with  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash; it,&rdquo; Dad  yelled, &ldquo;clear out with you, or I&rsquo;ll go and pull the whole thing down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And well you  might,&rdquo; Mrs. White hissed, &ldquo;and well you might. It wouldn&rsquo;t be hard. It  wouldn&rsquo;t want much pulling to fetch it down. The wonder is it hasn&rsquo;t fallen  down on their heads long ago. Hooh! the pile of rubbish that it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Dad  howled, with indignation and murder in his eye, &ldquo;do you know whose property  this is you&rsquo;re standin&rsquo; on, woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know whose  property it wouldn&rsquo;t be if everyone had their own; if your son had his due for  all that he has done for you, it would be <i>his</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,  woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>would</i>,&rdquo; Mrs. White shouted, &ldquo;it would,  and you know it. But he hasn&rsquo;t&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t anything. You give him nothing. You  take everything out of him, and grind and grind him down, and drive him and use  him, and starve him, as if he was nothing more than a working bullock to you,  and when he dares to ask you for a paltry pound you blackguard him and you  abuse him. You do&mdash;so you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whaht?</i>&rdquo; Dad yelled, jumping into the  air, &ldquo;<i>Whaht!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a  man,&rdquo; Mrs. White rattled on, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing of the man about you, and you&rsquo;re  not a Christian. You&rsquo;re a mean, selfish old screw, so you are! You are! You <i>are!</i>&rdquo; stamping her foot after every &ldquo;are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the devil out  of this&mdash;to the devil with your screaming, you&mdash;you&mdash;runt of a woman&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;<i>tomcat</i>,&rdquo; Dad howled, placing his big  hands on Mrs. White&rsquo;s shoulders, and shoving her from him, &ldquo;out of here, or  I&rsquo;ll throw you into the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your hands  off,&rdquo; Mrs. White shrieked, &ldquo;keep your hands off o&rsquo; me. Dare you strike a woman?&rdquo;  And she turned and lifted a huge gum stick that was lying at her feet, and  struck at Dad, and hissed &ldquo;Cur&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coward&rdquo; at every stroke. Dad foamed and  moved backwards for a while, receiving the blows manfully on his uplifted arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;you,&rdquo; he said  at last, and turned from his assailant with his back humped. Then Mrs. White  brought the stick down hard on his shoulders, squealing in accompaniment, &ldquo;Brute!  would you curse a respectable woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dad started  to run. And Mrs. White ran, too. she pursued him for twenty yards or more, then  gave up, and heaved the stick after him, squealing, &ldquo;Coward, coward, COWARD!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad didn&rsquo;t stop  or make any attempt to retire gracefully, or under cover of fire. Dad made  straight for his own house. Dad had met his Waterloo.</p>
<p>And Dave, who all  through the combat had stood open-mouthed, and with awe on his face, expecting  every moment to witness a tragic end to his mother-in-law, regarded the result  of the encounter with the liveliest satisfaction. He dropped in the grass, and  wriggled and chuckled, and scratched and kicked up earth at Dad&rsquo;s ludicrous  retreat.</p>
<p>Mrs. White, pale  and perspiring, her fragile frame trembling with excitement and anger, returned  to Lily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me some  water, child,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Oh, my gracious!&rdquo; and she flopped down in a heap on  the couch, holding her two hands over her heart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll kill me, child&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  drop&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drop&mdash; Oh, that brute of a man to upset me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily rushed in  with a cup of water, and her mother eagerly swallowed it all up, then lay back  on the couch, moaning: &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll kill me, oh, it&rsquo;ll kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad reached the  garden in safety, and slammed the hand-gate behind him with violence. He swore  at the top of his voice, too, at the dog, and kicked at the brute when it  bounded up at him and whimpered affectionately as if congratulating him on his  escape. Dad hurried up the steps, and tripped against a rocking chair, and  turned and used violent language to it, and booted it along the verandah; and  when it didn&rsquo;t go to pieces, lifted it in his hand, and heaved it into the top  of a peach tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the  matter?&rdquo; Mother said, coming on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near  me, don&rsquo;t come near me, woman,&rdquo; Dad yelled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a terrible temper.&rdquo; And  away he hobbled to his room.</p>
<p>Mother followed,  puzzled looking, but Dad closed the door, and locked himself in. And for an  hour or more nothing but blasphemy, mingled with heavy groans, came from Dad&rsquo;s  room. Dad was a bad loser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Dad Holds a Post Mortem</b></h2>
<p>While Dad was  sulking in his room a valuable Jersey cow, that had cost us fifteen pounds,  tried to jump into the lucerne near the house and got caught in the wires, and  hung by the legs straining and kicking and tearing strips of flesh from every  limb in her frantic efforts to get free.</p>
<p>Mother ran to Dad&rsquo;s  door, and called out excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her die  there,&rdquo; Dad bellowed back, &ldquo;pity they&rsquo;re not all stuck in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, dear,&rdquo;  Mother murmured, joining Sarah, who, with the axe in her hand, approached the  troubled beast. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll kill herself, she will, and not one of the boys about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah hacked at  the fence until she severed the wire, then the cow struggled on to her feet,  and ran on the lucerne, and began eating ravenously.</p>
<p>Then Dad appeared  on the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil  did y&rsquo; want destroying the fence for?&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else could  we do?&rdquo; Sarah answered, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could have  undone it,&rdquo; Dad yelled louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undone it!&rdquo;  Sarah sneered, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; come then and undo it y&rsquo;self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hussy, if  you give me any impertinence.&rdquo; Here Dad, with a determined stride, moved  towards the steps as though he meant to descend and swallow Sarah, axe, and  all, but when half-way down he stopped, and waving his hand, roared&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are y&rsquo; going to  leave her there to bust herself on the confounded lucerne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah ran round  the cow, and drove her out, and proceeded to barricade the gap in the fence  with some sticks that were lying about. Then Dad, growling to himself, returned  to his room and locked himself in again.</p>
<p>Half an hour  later. Willie Wiley, McDonald&rsquo;s orphan boy, rushed on to the verandah in a  state of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Rudd?&rdquo;  he said to Mother. &ldquo;They wants him at Walker&rsquo;s. Sam Walker has hung hisself  with a leg-rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hung hisself?&rdquo;  Mother and Sarah exclaimed in the same breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, hung  hisself,&rdquo; Willie gasped, &ldquo;just now&mdash;this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, his poor  wife!&rdquo; Mother moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re not  three months married!&rdquo; Sarah sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wants Mr.  Rudd to come quick,&rdquo; Willie added, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s hangin&rsquo; yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gracious me!&rdquo;  And Mother hurried to Dad&rsquo;s room again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has it to  do with me&mdash;what do I want with him?&rdquo; Dad howled, &ldquo;let him hang . . . the devil  take him &mdash;pity there wasn&rsquo;t some more hangin&rsquo; with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother pleaded  through the keyhole with Dad, and reminded him that he was a justice of the  peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To th&rsquo; devil  with the justice of the peace,&rdquo; Dad shouted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what on earth&rsquo;s come  over the man,&rdquo; Mother groaned, returning to the verandah.</p>
<p>Then she sent Sarah  down the paddock to summon one of the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it wanted  me?&rdquo; Dad growled, coming from his room at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want you  over at Walker&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Mother explained quietly, &ldquo;the poor man has hanged himself  with a rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing  that could happen him,&rdquo; Dad grunted, descending the steps slowly, &ldquo;the best  thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the garden  gate he loitered a while, then glancing along the lucerne paddock fence, called  out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that panel  fixed up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother said that  Sarah had seen to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen to it!&rdquo; Dad  shouted, &ldquo;those bits of sticks wouldn&rsquo;t keep a hen out. Tell some of those  fellows when they come in to mend it properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, very  well,&rdquo; Mother answered, and Dad directed his steps towards Walker&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He had hardly  covered ten yards of the way when his restless eyes settled on the new spring  cart standing in the glaring hot sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;it all,&rdquo; he  muttered, snapping his fingers, &ldquo;confound it, look at that!&rdquo; and he hurried  back to the garden fence, &ldquo;Who th&rsquo; deuce left that cart out there?&rdquo; he roared.  Mother hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell them  to put it in, or I&rsquo;ll put a stop to them touching it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother said she  would.</p>
<p>Dad, grunting,  turned away again and tripped over a long-handled shovel lying in the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce take  those devils of fellows! . . . . Who left this here?&rdquo; he howled.</p>
<p>Mother looked  puzzled.</p>
<p>Then Dad lifted  the implement and heaved it savagely into the garden, and broke the handle  against a peach tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they had to  do their work without implements at all,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d know how to look  after things better than they do,&rdquo; and again he headed for Walker&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As he passed out  the big white gate little Mary Murphy, barefooted, and picking her way tenderly  through the prickly tufts of dead Bathurst burr strewn over the hard road,  shyly accosted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr.  Rudd,&rdquo; Mary said, glancing up timidly from beneath a large calico bonnet, &ldquo;me  mother says would you oblige Father with a lend of th&rsquo; spring cart to go to  town in to-morrer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  lend no spring cart. D&mdash; th&rsquo; spring cart,&rdquo; Dad blurted out, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t buy it to  lend round th&rsquo; country.&rdquo; Then he went on again, leaving Mary standing on the  road with her head down and her finger in her mouth.</p>
<p>When about fifty  yards from the gate a thin voice screeched after Dad&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your dirty  old cart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad jumped round,  and saw Mary, regardless of bare feet and Bathurst burr, running for dear life.</p>
<p>When Dad arrived  at Walker&rsquo;s farm quite a crowd of sad helpless-looking spectators had gathered  in sympathy there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Dad  asked abruptly, pushing his way through them like a policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s thrown his  sponge up,&rdquo; young Regan answered,, pointing to the body dangling in the doorway  of the shed that served as a dairy. &ldquo;Slipped his win&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others  grinned mournfully at Regan.</p>
<p>Dan contemplated  the grim spectacle in silence for a moment or two, just as he might have  regarded a sheep on the gambol.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made a nice  picture of himself,&rdquo; he growled, and taking off his hat, poked his head in  between the hanging body and the door post to survey the interior of the dairy.</p>
<p>Dad was more  interested in milk dishes than he was in suicides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I cut him  down?&rdquo; young Regan asked, advancing to the hanging form with an open pocket  knife in his hand, &ldquo;ought to be nearly time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Dad  yelled, authoritatively. &ldquo;Leave him where he be until the police come, unless y&rsquo;  want t&rsquo; be suspected of havin&rsquo; a hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposin&rsquo; th&rsquo;  chap ain&rsquo;t dead, but&mdash;?&rdquo; Regan persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, supposin&rsquo;  he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dad answered, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t make any difference. He&rsquo;ll have to hang  there just the same; it&rsquo;s the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A law I don&rsquo;t  see much sense in, then,&rdquo; the other sneered, closing his knife with a look of  disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course, y&rsquo;  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dad replied, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t see any sense in being hanged y&rsquo;self if y&rsquo;  killed a man, would y&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dad grinned  triumphantly on the crowd, all of whom grinned in turn at Regan&rsquo;s discomfiture.</p>
<p>Regan said, &ldquo;Rot,&rdquo;  and slunk away.</p>
<p>Then Dad, seeing  Mrs. Walker grieving beside the water cask, approached her. Dad didn&rsquo;t put his  arms round Mrs. Walker. He didn&rsquo;t condole with her, either, or offer her any  words of encouragement at all. Dad was present in his official capacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What put it into  his head to play th&rsquo; fool like that?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the corpse.</p>
<p>Mrs. Walker  couldn&rsquo;t offer any reason for the deed at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure y&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t  naggin&rsquo; at him,&rdquo; Dad said, sternly, &ldquo;like all of y&rsquo; do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; the woman sobbed, &ldquo;my husband was  fond of me&mdash;he always said he loved me so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dad  mumbled, turning away from her, &ldquo;it looks like it, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then giving final  injunctions to all present not to interfere with the body or anything about the  place till the police arrived, Dad said he&rsquo;d &ldquo;send a wire,&rdquo; and retraced his  steps home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Dad Relents</b></h2>
<p>For two days  after his encounter with Mrs. White Dad was unapproachable. He moped on the  verandah, sulking and brooding like a bear with a bad head. If you went near  him or ventured to ask him anything he&rsquo;d break into violent language and roar  at you to clear &ldquo;to the devil.&rdquo; But one evening he went for a short walk, and  after returning, cooled down, and took Mother into his confidence. They talked  about Dave&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not a  good enough one for them, Father,&rdquo; Mother said, persuasively, &ldquo;not nearly&mdash;not  when we have so much money, and you can so well afford to pay for a better one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,  very well,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;they can have whatever they like. It makes no difference  to me. The carpenters at Gray&rsquo;s will be finished there in a day or so, and I&rsquo;ll  see what they&rsquo;ll put one up for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A four-roomed  house,&rdquo; Mother suggested, &ldquo;with a verandah all round would be good enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever they  like,&rdquo; Dad answered, &ldquo;whatever they like. They can have a ten-roomed one for  all I care.&rdquo; Mother smiled at Dad, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what you  should also do, Father, is to allow Dave, now that he is married, something a  week, and let him keep his wife and his own house out of it. It would be more  satisfactory for them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Dad conceded  cheerfully to Mother&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d rather  it that way, certainly. Why not? He could have had it long ago if he&rsquo;d said so.  It would have been all the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then after  reflecting&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we give  him?&rdquo; Dad&rsquo;s generosity was running away with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty shillings  a week, or two pounds, would be enough,&rdquo; Mother suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him two  pounds, or two pounds two,&rdquo; Dad answered.</p>
<p>Mother smiled  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, make it two  pounds two,&rdquo; and Dad rose, and was walking up and down the verandah, when  suddenly he gave a loud roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it,&rdquo; he  exclaimed, coming to a standstill, &ldquo;<i>confound</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the  matter?&rdquo; Mother said, staring after Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo;  and Dad started walking fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is  wrong, man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother followed  Dad along the verandah with an alarmed look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil take  it,&rdquo; stopping and swinging his clenched fist about, &ldquo;the devil take it . . . .  that wire,&rdquo; and Dad snapped his fingers, and looked at Mother; but to Mother  Dad was unintelligible.</p>
<p>&ldquo; Are y&rsquo; going  crazy, man?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot to send  it, woman&mdash;to send it to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother  understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, dear!&rdquo;  she moaned, &ldquo;th&rsquo; poor woman. Oh my! And all this time!&rdquo; and Mother looked  reproachfully at Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, <i>Tom!</i>&rdquo; Dad bellowed through the house.  Then turning to Mother&mdash;&ldquo;And the fools, I suppose, have left him hangin&rsquo; there  all this time. . . . Bill, <i>Bill!</i>&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>To Mother again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t  have sense enough to cut him down, I suppose. . . . <i>Tom</i> . . <i>Bar-tay</i> . . <i>Bill!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no  response to Dad&rsquo;s yells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where th&rsquo; devil  have they got to at all?&rdquo; he raved. &ldquo;<i>Bill</i> . . <i>Tom!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe, with a tired  walk, strolled in from the paddock where he had been ploughing all day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why th&rsquo; deuce  ain&rsquo;t some o&rsquo; you about when you&rsquo;re wanted?&rdquo; Pad yelled to him.</p>
<p>Joe stared  wonderingly at Dad, then broke into a smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand there grinning like a  wild cat,&rdquo; Dad roared, &ldquo;get a horse, fellow, and go to the railway and send a  telegram for the police at once.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police?&rsquo;&rsquo; Joe  answered, puzzled-looking, &ldquo;what th&rsquo; deuce do you want with the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it, get  the horse,&rdquo; and Dad threw out his two arms and stamped his foot at Joe.</p>
<p>Joe continued to  smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pshaw</i>, you eejit, will you stand there  all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That poor man,&rdquo;  Mother put in for Joe&rsquo;s information, &ldquo;is still hanging.&rsquo;&rsquo; And there was a pale,  piteous look in Mother&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Joe gave a short  snigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we  buried him days ago,&rdquo; and he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wha-at?</i>&rdquo; Dad yelled, breaking into a  fresh fit of frenzy, and hobbling after Joe. &ldquo;<i>Wha-at!</i> .... Buried him? Who dared to? Who told y&rsquo; to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it, I did  meself,&rdquo; Joe snapped, turning and facing Dad again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> did? . . . <i>you</i> meddled with the law? You eejit; you&mdash;you&mdash;do you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Joe  said, interrupting Dad, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better send a wire for a warder; <i>that&rsquo;s</i> what y&rsquo; want.&rdquo; Then he left Dad,  and went off to feed the horses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Dad Forgets the Past</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a  good deal to blame, y&rsquo;selves,&rdquo; Mrs. White said, when Lily and Dave told her of  Dad&rsquo;s generosity; &ldquo;I do, indeed; and I really believe you&rsquo;d have had a good  house from the very beginning if you had only had the courage to stick out for  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes you to  talk to him, Mother,&rdquo; Dave drawled, in cheerful admiration of his  mother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so could you  talk to him&mdash;so could anyone if they had a bit of go in them,&rdquo; Mrs. White  snapped. &ldquo;After all, I believe your father&rsquo;s the best man of the lot of you.  He&rsquo;s only what you&rsquo;ve all made him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave grinned a  hard, senseless sort of grin, and mumbled&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do know,&rdquo;  his mother-in-law retorted, &ldquo;anyone with half an eye would know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t  matter now,&rdquo; Lily put in pleasantly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re to get a good house and an  allowance, and that&rsquo;s everything, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs, that&rsquo;s th&rsquo;  main thing,&rdquo; Dave said, and went off for a bucket of water.</p>
<p>Sarah was the  only one who disapproved of Dad building another house for Dave and Lily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know  what they want with a place like that,&rdquo; she said, when Dad at dinner, one day,  was boasting of having let the contract for three hundred pounds; &ldquo;th&rsquo; one they&rsquo;re  living in ought to be quite good enough for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother made an  effort to console Sarah, but Sarah was a hard girl to silence when she felt she  had a grievance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;  she sneered, tossing the spoons recklessly into the cups, and making a lot of  unnecessary noise with them, &ldquo;some people seem to be able to get anything they  want, while others can&rsquo;t get anything at all, no matter what they do for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with  you&mdash;what th&rsquo; deuce do you want now?&rdquo; Dad said, savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great  many things I want, but I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to get any of them.&rdquo; And Sarah  flashed her eyes on Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what &rsquo;n th&rsquo;  devil are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&mdash;plenty (here  Sarah broke into tears)&mdash;I&rsquo;ve not had a d&mdash;de&mdash;(sobbing)&mdash;decent dress that I could  go out in f&mdash;f&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t know w&mdash;w&mdash;when.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my  soul,&rdquo; Dad roared, &ldquo;what the deuce do I know about your dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,  girl,&rdquo; Mother said, soothingly to Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sah&mdash;sah&mdash;<i>saddle</i> I&rsquo;ve got to ruh&mdash;ruh&mdash;<i>ride</i> in, guh, guh&mdash;<i>go</i> and look at it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get  yourself a better one, then,&rdquo; Dad bellowed, &ldquo;confound it, do you think I carry  everything about in my pocket with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mother  pleaded with Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others can  guh&mdash;guh&mdash;<i>get</i> houses,&rdquo; Sarah blubbered,  &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To th&rsquo; mischief  with you,&rdquo; Dad yelled desperately, and lumped up and bolted from the table. </p>
<p>In less than a  week the carpenters had the timber on the ground, and once more a new house was  going up for Dave. Dad used to leave the yard or the paddock, or wherever he  happened to be, about twenty times a day, and stroll up to see how the building  was getting along. And he&rsquo;d yarn and stare about, and examine nails and putty  and things lying around, and get in the way of the men and keep them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to do a  bit of carpenting myself once,&rdquo; Dad said boastingly to the contractor one  evening; and the contractor, a quiet man with hard immovable features, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw you  putting up that place there,&rdquo; and he pointed with a chisel to Dave&rsquo;s little  gunyah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;quite  so&mdash;quite so,&rdquo; Dad answered, colouring a little, &ldquo;but I only meant that to stand  till this one went up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think  it&rsquo;ll do that&rdquo; the contractor said quietly, &ldquo;unless the wind happens to rise  within the next few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dad cleared  his throat, and went away to attend to the cows. Dave&rsquo;s humpy was a subject  which Dad didn&rsquo;t care to discuss much with strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how y&rsquo;  enjoyin&rsquo; y&rsquo;self?&rdquo; Dad said cheerfully, saluting Mrs. White, who was standing in  Dave&rsquo;s doorway one afternoon.</p>
<p>Mrs. White nearly  fell down with surprise, and before she could recover control of her feelings  Dad had invited her to come and look at the new building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;come on, I want to show it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. White, in  her haste to secure a hat, fouled Lily, and knocked a dish of cream out of her  hand, and forgot to apologise or pick any of it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll like  it,&rdquo; Dad said, proudly, as they stepped across the grass.</p>
<p>Tears came into  Mrs. White&rsquo;s eyes, and her breath seemed to leave her. Dad&rsquo;s magnanimity was  too much for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There y&rsquo; are,&rdquo;  he said, indicating the frame work with a sweep of his hand, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s th&rsquo;  bedroom, and this here is where they&rsquo;ll eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be  lovely,&rdquo; Mrs. White said, gazing round, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure they should be grateful  to you, Mr. Rudd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo; long as <i>they&rsquo;re</i>  satisfied,&rdquo; Dad said, in an off-handed sort of way, &ldquo;I am; it don&rsquo;t matter a  straw to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, taking up  the plans, he explained the architecture of the building in detail; and, in the  interests of convenience, Mrs. White suggested several alterations, all of  which Dad, though he didn&rsquo;t exactly see the sense of them, readily accepted,  and he instructed the contractor to carry them out, and raised consultations  and angry discussions amongst the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are y&rsquo;  going away?&rdquo; Dad enquired, on taking leave of Mrs. White.</p>
<p>Mrs. White  thought she wouldn&rsquo;t be going home for a few days&mdash;&ldquo;not till Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad said,  &ldquo;come with us to the races to-morrow, and on Saturday morning I&rsquo;ll drive you to  the railway station in the buggy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that night,  while Mrs. White at tea eulogised Dad to Dave and Lily, and said he was a &ldquo;fine  old man,&rdquo; Dad, at our table, spoke of no one but Mrs. White, &ldquo;A splendid  woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a woman of the world&mdash;a woman with a business head, believe  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Races</b></h2>
<p>The milking was  over, and we were all preparing to start for the races. Joe and Tom and Bill  and Barty rode and led Honeysuckle. Honeysuckle was a racehorse. She was also a  mare&mdash;a very fast mare, too&mdash; so Joe reckoned. We bred her ourselves. We bred her  mother also, and her grandmother. Dad used to plough with her grandmother.</p>
<p>Dave and Lily  were to drive in the sulky, and Mrs. White was to occupy a seat in the buggy.  When Sarah heard that Mrs. White was to go in the buggy, she went cold on the  races, and became disagreeable. She said she had a good mind not to go at all.  Mother remonstrated with Sarah, and told her not to be foolish. Mrs. White,  Mother thought, was a nice little woman. Mother had met Mrs. White at Dave&rsquo;s  place one evening, and made friends with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no room  in the buggy as it is,&rdquo; Sarah snapped, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see where you&rsquo;re going to  put any more. It&rsquo;s a wonder Dave and his wife isn&rsquo;t poked into it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her sit on  my knee,&rdquo; Dad suggested, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she won&rsquo;t  sit on mine, that&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo; and Sarah threw her new hat recklessly on the  table, and knocked several flowers out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Dad  exclaimed as Dave appeared conducting Mrs. White up the stairs, &ldquo;here she be  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mrs. White,  dressed in all the colours of the rainbow, tripped in as light and airy as a  magpie. She shook hands with Dad and Mother, and was introduced to Sarah and  Miss Grey. Miss Grey was Sarah&rsquo;s guest, and she, too, was to have a seat in the  buggy.</p>
<p>An effusive  talker was Mrs. White, and when she entered into conversation with Sarah, which  she did by making complimentary remarks about the latter&rsquo;s new hat, and let her  eloquence loose on skirts and blouses and bonnets and things, Sarah was  dazzled. She felt herself curling up like a piece of green bark, and all her  antipathy to Dave&rsquo;s mother-in-law disappeared. Sarah bobbed and nodded her  head, and said, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to everything Mrs. White said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll get  along!&rdquo; Dad said, and leading the way to the buggy, he began handing the ladies  in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it  will hold us all?&rdquo; Mrs. White asked, with an amused look at the crowded  vehicle, as she paused with her foot on the step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is  nothing,&rdquo; Sarah said, &ldquo;it carried ten of us to the picnic at Easter, besides  baskets and all kinds of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. White was  satisfied, and up she climbed, and wedged her frail form in between Sarah and  Miss Grey, and nearly shoved them over the edge, and away the buggy rolled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a big day,&rdquo;  Dad remarked, enthusiastically, as his eyes rested on a crowd of horsemen  tearing down the lane. It was always a &ldquo;big&rdquo; day at the Saddletop Races, and  mostly a long one. Sometimes it lasted for forty-eight hours, sometimes for a  week. And if it wasn&rsquo;t for the shearing or milking it would often have lasted  all the year. The sport always commenced early in the day, too. It commenced as  soon as those who had horses to ride got outside their sliprails. And nearly  all of them had horses. Those who hadn&rsquo;t, owned animals similar in their  habits, but shaped like cows. And they would race one another on them for  miles, and at every junction in the road, and there were many, where the  inhabitants of Empty Gully and Crow&rsquo;s Nest and Bandy Andy joined in, fresh  flutters and &ldquo;finishes&rdquo; followed, till like an army of lunatics let loose on  quadrupeds, they streamed on to the unfenced course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, we&rsquo;re  waiting,&rdquo; the Committee shouted when Dad arrived, and drew up under a tree. Dad  waved his whip to them in response, and got out. Dad&rsquo;s presence was important.  Dad was to be the judge. Dad was a good and just judge, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a drink  before we commence,&rdquo; Mulrooney said, and Dad, along with Mulrooney, and eight  or ten others, went and had one. Before coming away they had two.</p>
<p>Four events were  run, and there was only one accident; a boy fell off in one race, and was  carried away on a hurdle.</p>
<p>Everyone was full  and merry, and the sports were going off delightfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saddle up for  the Empty Gully Handicap!&rdquo; they called out, and Joe and Bill and Tom became  active. They tightened the girths round Honeysuckle, and lifted Barty into the  saddle. Barty took some lifting, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember  what I told y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Joe said, warningly, referring to some injunction he had been  drumming into Barty for several weeks past, as to &ldquo;getting way at the jump and  keeping the mare on the posts.&rdquo; But Barty didn&rsquo;t hear Joe&mdash;Barty was thinking of  the boy who had been taken home on a hurdle; and, crouched in the saddle, and  holding the mare with a short rein as he walked her slowly to the starting  post, he looked the embodiment of caution.</p>
<p>Dad took his  place in the judge&rsquo;s box. The judge&rsquo;s box was made of a gin case. But Dad  didn&rsquo;t get inside the case. He stood right up on it. Two &ldquo;spielers&rdquo; from town,  who had a horse called Cardigan running, lifted their voices, and shouted, &ldquo;Two  to one, Cardigan,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ten to one, Honeysuckle.&rdquo; Joe and Bill and Tom put  their heads together, and held a hurried consultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten to one,  Honeysuckle,&rdquo; the spielers yelled repeatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take &rsquo;im,&rdquo; Bill  urged, excitedly, as Joe thoughtfully contemplated a new half-sovereign that  nestled in the palm of his big hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose she don&rsquo;t  win?&rdquo; Joe murmured, with a faraway look in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can she lose?&rdquo;  Bill asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if she do?&rdquo;  from Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll drop  me half quid,&rdquo; and Joe turned the coin over affectionately again.</p>
<p>There was a false  start, and Barty, hanging well out over Honeysuckle&rsquo;s neck, raced up the  straight as far as the winning post, then pulled up, and walked the mare slowly  back again.</p>
<p>Mother became  alarmed at sight of Barty, and from the buggy called warningly to Dad that the  boy would get killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten to one,  Honeysuckle,&rdquo; the spielers called again, and Joe and Bill and Tom held another  consultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, put five  bob on,&rdquo; Tom said; and Joe looked at the coin once more, then pushed his way to  the &ldquo;book, maker,&rdquo; and made a wager.</p>
<p>Several of the  spectators applauded Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good man, young  Rudd,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They seemed to  take Joe for the Jubilee Plunger. And old Jim Mahoney, a friend of Dad&rsquo;s, spurred  his horse close beside the spieler, and with a savage glare in his eye, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll take  five bob wid you, too, on the mare,&rdquo; adding as a sort of proviso, &ldquo;An&rsquo; if you  attimpt to lave th&rsquo; course widout payin&rsquo; me, me shaver, I&rsquo;ll break every  bone in y&rsquo; body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd  laughed, and turned to watch the horses.</p>
<p>Another false  start, and Barty, all on his own, sailed past the winning post again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, dear,  look at the child!&rdquo; Mother moaned, and Mrs. White shared Mother&rsquo;s  apprehensions. Mrs. White said she would &ldquo;never, never, let a son of hers risk  his life in a horse race&mdash;not for a million of money.&rdquo; And she made Mother ill.</p>
<p>Joe ran out, and  took hold of Honeysuckle by the head to lead her back to the starter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, bhoi,&rdquo;  Mahoney cried, kicking his old horse out of the crowd, and brushing up beside  Barty. &ldquo;Take this wid you, an&rsquo; give me that switch you have,&rdquo; shoving a heavy  lump of cow-hide that he used as a riding-whip into Barty&rsquo;s hand, and relieving  him of a quince stick which Joe had armed him with. &ldquo;And here put this on your  feet,&rdquo; and he removed an old iron spur from his boot, and buckled it to one of  Barty&rsquo;s. And Barty, his eyes all agog, his hands trembling, and beads of  perspiration rolling off him, was scarcely conscious of what was going on.</p>
<p>The horses drew  into line again, with Barty on the outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;it, keep out a  bit,&rdquo; the rider of Cardigan yelled viciously at Barty. Barty felt for the reins  to &ldquo;keep out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; the starter  said, and away they all went&mdash;all but Honeysuckle. She stood broadside on. But  Barty soon shifted her. He hit her with the hide, and she bounded off, and  followed the others, Barty heeling and flogging her all the way up the  straight. Barty heeled and flogged her all the way round the course.</p>
<p>Joe and Bill and  Tom dropped their heads and took no further interest in the race. They seemed  disappointed in their brother as a jockey. But Dad kept his eyes on his son all  the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cardigan! Trance!  Cardigan!&rdquo; the crowd yelled as the horses turned into the straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By damn, look at  the mare!&rdquo; Mahoney cried, excitedly, as Barty belted her past one or two of the  stragglers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming, no  mistake of it!&rdquo; Dad shouted, and from the top of the gin case he started  working his hands and helping Barty to ride the mare.</p>
<p>Then came a loud  burst of &ldquo;Cardigan!&rdquo; &ldquo;Trance!&rdquo; &ldquo;Trance!&rdquo; &ldquo;Dead heat!&rdquo; And the horses flashed  past the box.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page173.jpg" alt="flashed" width="600" height="664"></p>
<p>The rest of Dad&rsquo;s  remarks were drowned in an angry howl of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back, and  let the judge decide,&rdquo; one of the committee shouted.</p>
<p>The mob stood  back and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five pounds to  nothing Cardigan won by a nose,&rdquo; one of the spielers bellowed, shoving five  sovereigns into Dad&rsquo;s hand. Dad closed on the gold in an unconscious sort of  way, and began to address the crowd&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, upon my  soul, I couldn&rsquo;t say any more than the rest of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was watching  Honey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;swindle! . . .  Thieves! . . . Robbers!&rdquo; they yelled, jumping in the air, and someone kicked  the gin case from under Dad&rsquo;s feet, and he fell heavily on his back. Then there  was bloodshed. Old Mahoney, who was Irish, plunged his horse into the thick of  it, and everywhere he saw a bare head he hit at it with a stick. Six or seven  men, with torn shirts and roaring like wild animals, surrounded Mahoney, and  dragged him off his horse, and got him down, and hit and kicked at him. And in  turn they were knocked down and kicked by some more who rushed in to take a  hand.</p>
<p>Dad defended  himself with the gin case. Dad fought with the gin case until all he held in  his hand was a scrap of painted pine&mdash;until Mother and Sarah and Mrs. White,  screaming frantically, gathered round him and pulled him into the buggy. Then  Mother took charge of the reins, and whipped up the horse, and they left the  course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo;  Dad said, striving to make light of the riot, and mopping blood and  perspiration off himself as the buggy reached the road&mdash; &ldquo;nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page175.jpg" alt="mopping" width="650" height="502"></p>
<p>Then Dad suddenly  became conscious of the sovereigns that were glued to his clammy palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where&rsquo;n th&rsquo;  devil did I get these?&rdquo; he said, glaring in surprise at the gold. But none of  the females were interested in money just then. <i>They</i> were all offering up  prayers for having escaped with their lives, and loudly declaring to Providence  that they would never be seen on a racecourse again as long as they lived. And  they never were.</p>
<p>When Saturday  came round Dad put the horse in the buggy again, and called for Mrs. White. And  as they rattled away and passed out through the big white gate, Lily, standing  at her door beside Dave, waved her apron, and shed tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one would &rsquo;a  expected to see that a few days ago,&rdquo; Dave said, thoughtfully. Then they both  turned away, and went inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Norah Comes Home</b></h2>
<p>It was twelve  years since we had seen Norah, and ever since she had been removed from  Cooktown to Brisbane we had been looking forward to her home-coming. Sandy and  Kate with a cart load of their offspring, drove over from Sandy Creek to be  present when Norah would arrive, and Dave and Lily, when the day came round,  closed their house and came to our place after supper.</p>
<p>We all sat up and  watched the clock, and listened eagerly for the rattle of the buggy. Mother was  all impatience and excitement, Dad restless and silent. Sarah hustled in and  out, arranging and disarranging things in the sitting room, and supplying her  own room, which Norah was to share, with new towels and linen, and goodness knows  what. At regular intervals Kate, when her offspring grew sleepy and started  whimpering, would silence them with the warning that their &ldquo;Aunty Norah was  coming.&rdquo; And how the youngsters would brighten up! They expected big things  from their Aunty Norah. But as the clock went round they seemed to lose  confidence in her, and would whine harder than before. And Dad, when we would  prick our ears, and say &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t hear for the noise, and he&rsquo;d scowl  at the bellowing brats, and yell &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Then Sandy would lean forward from  his place on the sofa, and stare reproachfully at poor careworn-looking Kate,  and inquire what it was they wanted. Sandy was a sensitive parent, and didn&rsquo;t  like any of his family to be thought a nuisance in another&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want a good  slap,&rdquo; Kate would snap, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what they want, the whole lot of them. They&rsquo;ve  been like that the whole day long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Sandy, with  the feeling that he had done his duty as a fond parent and husband, would lean  back contentedly, and eye the clock again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo;  Dave exclaimed, when at last all the dogs started barking vigorously in chorus,  and rushing in the direction of the white gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s them,&rdquo;  Sandy added, and up we all jumped, and rushed out into the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Joe  cried from the buggy, &ldquo;did y&rsquo; think we were lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then down the  steps all of us went (all but Sandy and Lily&mdash;they had never met Norah, and hung  back), and crowded round the wheels of the buggy, clamouring &ldquo;Norah! How are y&rsquo;,  Norah? Hello, Norah!&rdquo; And before her feet had hardly touched the ground, Mother  and Sarah and Kate were all holding her and hugging her. And when Dad and Barty  and the rest of us had groped for her, Mother and Sarah and Kate renewed the  attack and hugged her some more. Ah, it was grand to see the reception Norah  got! It made some of us long to be made school-teachers, and to go far away  from home, and to come back again after a lot of years.</p>
<p>One after the  other we trooped into the dining room, and in the lamplight stared long and  closely at Norah to see if she had altered at all, and what she was like. But  none of us would ever have known her&mdash;not even Mother; she was nothing like the  Norah we used to know&mdash;nothing like the Norah who used to run bareheaded and  barefooted about Shingle-hut, and straddle old Bess without a saddle, and use  the stockwhip on her like a man. Ah, no! Norah had changed since then. She had  graduated. Norah was a city woman now&mdash;an old maid, with fine-fitting clothes,  and jewellery glistening all about her. She wore a gold chain as long as a leg  rope, looped round her neck, and two gold bangles on each arm, and numerous  gold rings, with all kinds of coloured stones in them, on her fingers, and a  gold comb like a piece of a rainbow in the back of her hair, and gold pince-nez  on her nose; and when she smiled she showed a lot of gold in her teeth.  Altogether, Norah looked like a valuable gold mine.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400051h-images/page180.jpg" alt="nora" width="569" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;My word,&rdquo; Mother  said, as Sarah hurried Norah away to the bedroom to take her hat and things  off, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lady for you! And she&rsquo;s second head teacher!&rdquo; Ah! yes! Mother  was proud of her talented daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, me an&rsquo;  Lily haven&rsquo;t been introduced yet,&rdquo; Sandy drawled, grinning sheepishly across  the room at Dave&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  Kate ejaculated, grieved looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Well! Well!&rdquo;  And Mother clasped her hands together sorrowfully, and looked apologetically at  Lily, and then at Sandy. &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you speak to her yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,  Mother,&rdquo; Sandy answered, lightly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s plenty of time&mdash;wait till she comes  over to spend a day or two with us among the wallabies.&rdquo; And Kate laughed at  the humour of her husband.</p>
<p>Sarah and Norah  returned to the dining room&mdash;Norah with a solemn face and a stately step, and  carrying herself as though she were entering a church, or being received at  Government house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t met  Sandy, Norah,&rdquo; Mother said, &ldquo;we quite forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Norah,&rdquo;  Sandy responded, advancing in his shirt sleeves and a broad grin, and with his  hand extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo; you <i>do?</i>&rdquo; Norah said, bowing stiffly, and  giving Sandy the tips of her fingers to squeeze.</p>
<p>Sandy stared.  Sandy was taken aback a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty  middlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he stammered&mdash;&ldquo;how&rsquo;s yerself?&rdquo; And he knocked over a chair, and stood  on the cat, getting back to his corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is  Lily,&rdquo; Mother added, turning to Dave&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h,&rdquo; Norah  said, bowing and smiling coldly across the room at her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>Lily started to  cross the floor, but hesitated when she received no encouragement from her new  relation, and went different colours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like  living at Saddletop?&rdquo; Norah asked formally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I like it,&rdquo;  Lily mumbled, dropping down on the sofa beside Dave.</p>
<p>Then it was Dad&rsquo;s  turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said,  running his eye over Norah&rsquo;s finery, &ldquo;what sort of a trip did you have coming  up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De&mdash;<i>light</i>&mdash;ful,&rdquo; Norah answered, seating  herself at the table, and displaying her bangles. &ldquo;It was a most enjoyable  time. We had Dr. and Mrs. Winchester, and the Honourable J. C. Bigbelt and his  two daughters, in our party, and Mr. Peter Penny, who is studying for the Bar.  And the author of &lsquo;Boughs and Brambles&rsquo; got into our carriage at Ipswich&mdash;a  most unassuming young fellow. It was a perfect treat all the way up. The doctor  is such a gentleman, and the Misses Bigbelts are the most charming girls  imaginable &mdash;especially Miss Mary &mdash;she&rsquo;s an <i>ex</i>-cellent  conversationalist &mdash;really wonderful. Oh, I&rsquo;d <i>love</i> you to meet her&mdash;&rdquo; looking at Sarah.</p>
<p>Dad scratched his  head, and said, &ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; Mother simply beamed on Norah with pride; Sandy sat  stolidly staring at her; Lily curled her lip, and stole a meaning glance at  Dave; Kate eyed her as though she seemed to doubt her sister&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t  proud, then?&rdquo; Sarah said, growing interested in Norah&rsquo;s acquaintances.</p>
<p>Norah shrugged  her shoulders, and rolled her eyes about and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,  they&rsquo;re all very well-to-do people, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever see  Bill Smith down there?&rdquo; Dad broke in.</p>
<p>Norah seemed  perplexed, and threw up her eyebrows, and rolled her eyes about again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Honourable  J. F. Smith?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;damn &rsquo;im&mdash;<i>Bill</i> Smith, who gave up his selection at  Shingle Hut, and went to Brisbane eight year ago to drive a &rsquo;bus,&rdquo; Dad grunted.</p>
<p>Sandy and Dave  chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose  I would know him,&rdquo; Norah answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? <i>Old Smith?</i> Why all the dogs knows <i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! Ho!  ho! ho!&rdquo; from Dave and Sandy; and some of Kate&rsquo;s offspring wished to share  their parents&rsquo; boisterous mirth, but Kate shook them, and whispered warningly, &ldquo;Sh&rsquo;,  Tommy! . . . <i>Ellen!</i>&rdquo; and they  desisted like good children.</p>
<p>Kate and Lily  exchanged smiles on the quiet, and Dad grunted several times, and looked at the  clock, and told Barty to go out and see if there were any clouds about.</p>
<p>Mother and Sarah  then engaged Norah in a chat, and Norah was playing with her bangles and  rolling her eyes about more than ever, and punctuating her conversation with &ldquo;my  profession&rdquo; and &ldquo;my dentist,&rdquo; and &ldquo;my medical adviser,&rdquo; when Joe bounded in  after taking the horse out of the buggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Norah,&rdquo; he  said, sitting opposite her, and interrupting her discourse&mdash;&rdquo;see any difference  between this place and the old caboose we all used to puddle in at Shingle hut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah eyed Joe  curiously, laughed a few mirthless bars, and showed the gold in her teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Dad said,  and took out his spectacle case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the day  you put on Dad&rsquo;s pants, Norah?&rdquo; Joe asked, with a big cheerful grin, &ldquo;and old  Anderson caught y&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily and Kate  shrieked suddenly. Dave and Sandy let out another &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Ho! ho!  ho!&rdquo; and Bill yelled, &ldquo;Oh crikey!&rdquo; and fell off a chair.</p>
<p>Norah blushed,  and in indignant tones, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a question,  Joseph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>did</i>, though,&rdquo; Joe persisted, mirthfully,  &ldquo;I remember it well.&rdquo; And he appealed to Dave. Dave always agreed with Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, <i>my</i> pants?&rdquo; Dad asked, putting on his  specs, and waking up to the fact that his wardrobe had been abused without his  knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yours,&rdquo; Joe  repeated, grinning across the table at Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was I thun?&rdquo;  Dad asked gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you  were in bed,&rdquo; Joe answered, and the house nearly came down.</p>
<p>Joe fixed his  eyes on Norah again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked,  &ldquo;do you remember the time when you and Kate invited Mary and Lizzie Anderson  over for an afternoon tea-party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah looked  confused, and Kate broke into another loud shriek, and hugged her infant close.  Kate&rsquo;s memory seemed to be better than Norah&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We stared  cheerfully at Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They asked the  two Andersons,&rdquo; Joe went on, turning round and addressing Lily, &ldquo;to come over  for a feed one day, and forgot all about it until they saw their guests coming,  dressed up, and there wasn&rsquo;t anything in the house for them to eat, and these  two weren&rsquo;t clean themselves, and they hadn&rsquo;t any boots on, and I don&rsquo;t think  they had any to put on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another  loud laugh;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  Mother said, smiling and turning the same colour as Norah. Mother seemed to  remember something about the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hadn&rsquo;t a  scrap of bread,&rdquo; Joe rattled on, and the two of them bundled poor old Mother  into bed, and made her have the measles.&rdquo; And Joe placed his two hands  caressingly on Mother&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;  Sandy yelled above the rest, and fell off the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they  got to the door,&rdquo; Joe continued, &ldquo;Kate was giving Mother a drink, and Norah was  mopping her brow with a wet rag to bring down her temperature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy mounted the  sofa, holding his sides, and said, &ldquo;Lord save us!&rdquo; and fell off it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a silly, Joe,&rdquo; Mother cried,  and broke into a loud laugh herself.</p>
<p>Another mirthless  bar or two escaped Norah, who seemed very uncomfortable, and she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a  pantomine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we had all  recovered, Joe wiped some tears from his eyes, and addressed Norah again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you recollect  the night old Murphy hoisted the sheet?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><i>Kate</i> recollected. <i>She</i> burst into another shriek. Kate  seemed to anticipate Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I  had such a ridiculous brother,&rdquo; Norah snorted, and turned to look at Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoisted th&rsquo;  sheet?&rdquo; Sandy interrogated, cheerfully. Sandy was enjoying Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Joe said,  &ldquo;these two&rdquo;&mdash;indicating Norah and Kate&mdash;&ldquo;walked about five miles one evening to  see Mrs. Murphy and old Tim&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murphy at the  Five Mile?&rdquo; Dad put in gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, old Tim,  who used to sing &lsquo;The Van Van Vock.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; d&mdash;scoundrel,&rdquo;  from Dad, and loud hilarity from the rest of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they  were there a storm came on, and they had to stay all night,&rdquo; Joe continued,  looking at Lily, while Sandy and Dave sat with their eyes open and mouths agape  ready to laugh more. &ldquo;There was only one long room in Murphy&rsquo;s house, and only  one bed; but they had two mattresses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate couldn&rsquo;t  contain herself in a sitting position any longer, and rose and walked about  shaking with mirth, while Norah stared hard and curiously at Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Murphy  put one of the mattresses on the floor for these two, and Murphy hoisted a  sheet between his bed and theirs, and made two rooms&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>sheet?</i>&rdquo; Sandy roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a sheet,&rdquo;  Joe said, &ldquo;with a big hole in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily was seized  with a violent fit of coughing, and Dave hammered her on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not with a <i>hole</i>,&rdquo; Kate cried, putting Joe right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness  sake, stop it, Joe,&rdquo; Sarah cried, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>Joe stopped it,  and laid his head on the table, and laughed with the rest of us.</p>
<p>When all the  hilarity had died down, Dave and Lily, with broad grins on their faces, rose  and put on their hats, and said, &ldquo;they must be going,&rdquo; and promised to come over  again the next night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t  remember any of those things, Norah?&rdquo; Joe asked, raising his head, when Dave  and Lily had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a <i>fool</i>,  Joseph!&rdquo; Norah snapped, and went off to bed with Sarah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  Norah&rsquo;s Holiday</b></h2>
<p>We all rose early  the morning after Norah arrived, and waited breakfast patiently till nearly  seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Joe looked at the  clock, then turned his eyes restlessly to the draught horses standing at the  barn, with their harness on.</p>
<p>Dad, for the  second or third time, came in from the milking yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t she ready yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo;  Mother replied, softly, &ldquo;in a moment.&rdquo; And Sarah called&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breakfast,  Norah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;moment&rdquo; went  by, and the form of Norah, in a gorgeous morning gown, glided past the dining  room door in search of the bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait  here all day,&rdquo; Dad said, angrily, seating himself at the head of the table, and  proceeding to carve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be a  moment now if you have a little patience,&rdquo; Mother pleaded, with a kindly smile  at Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil  do you call a moment?&rdquo; Dad growled, slashing into the hot steaming steak, &ldquo;half  th&rsquo; day&rsquo;s gone now. &ldquo;Here&rdquo;&mdash;shoving a plate loaded to the brim along the table,  and looking at Joe and Bill&mdash; &ldquo;make a start.&rdquo; Joe and Bill hesitated, and looked  at Mother.</p>
<p>Just then Norah&rsquo;s  voice came from the bathroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sar&mdash;ah, would  you bring me my scented soap&mdash;it&rsquo;s on the top of my portmanteau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Dad  blurted out, and slashed viciously at the steak on Bill&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>Joe and Bill  chuckled, and decided to proceed with their breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my  toothbrush, Sarah, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad stopped  carving, and shook his head contemptuously. Joe and Bill chuckled again, and  Joe said, looking at his parent&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go  in for some scented soap, too, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in for some  sense,&rdquo; Dad grunted, turning his eyes in the direction of the bathroom. ... &ldquo;Scented  soap and toothbrushes!&rdquo; he added, scornfully, and Joe and Bill laughed merrily.</p>
<p>Norah was ready  at last, and when Dad and Joe and Bill had gone into the yard, she came to the  table with a glow on her face like the flush of dawn, and wearing a bright new  dress of the latest fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always  have breakfast so early?&rdquo; she said, with a surprised look at the clock. (You&rsquo;d  think Norah had never been on a selection before).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier,  sometimes,&rdquo; Mother answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious  me, why we never dream of getting up at my hotel until half-past eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-past eight!&rdquo;  Sarah echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at eight o  clock the maid brings me a cup of tea and a bit of toast; then I go to my bath.  I&rsquo;m generally last breakfast. Then, at nine, I&rsquo;m ready for school.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! we  have a day&rsquo;s work done nearly by that time,&rdquo; Sarah said, looking at Mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo;  from Norah, &ldquo;but yours is only housework, which is very different. If your head  was taxed every day with a severe mental strain like mine, you would require  much more sleep to rest the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Mother  said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it must be hard, so much learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard! You can&rsquo;t  imagine, Mother, how hard it is. Some days I fancy I&rsquo;ll just collapse.&rdquo; And  Norah carefully adjusted her serviette, and, taking a spoon in her finger tips,  proceeded to sup a plate of porridge in a most polite and dainty fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a  lovely blouse?&rdquo; Sarah said, drawing Mother&rsquo;s attention to Norah&rsquo;s finery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;  Norah said, with all the pride and vanity of a teacher in her eye.</p>
<p>Sarah thought it  was &ldquo;just lovely,&rdquo; and expressed a wish to take a pattern of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was  inclined to be displeased with it at first,&rdquo; Norah went on, glancing in  admiration along the sleeves of the garment, &ldquo;but so many people have admired  it since, that I&rsquo;m beginning to think I owe an apology to my dressmaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think it  suits you so well,&rdquo; Mother murmured, moving round the table, and examining the  lace that dangled from the blouse like a lot of blossoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, indeed?&rdquo;  And Norah blushed and sipped another spoonful of porridge to conceal her  feelings. &ldquo;Miss Blunt,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;makes all my things. She makes for nearly  all the society people in Brisbane, but I rather fancy she is not taking so  much pains as she used&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t finish nearly so well. But there&rsquo;s a young  lady in the Valley who makes charmingly&mdash;a Miss Cholomondley. Her brother  manages a bank at Charters Towers. I have given her the dress I am going to  wear at the Hospital Ball. She makes for the Misses Bigbelt, whom I was telling  you about, and the Mayoress, and she&rsquo;s making Miss Pearlie Pothouse&rsquo;s wedding  dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Mother  nor Sarah knew who Pearlie Pothouse was. Norah told them all about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the  prettiest girl in Brisbane,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a daughter of Judge Pothouse, and she&rsquo;s  such a dear little thing. A delightful singer, and composes, and plays the  banjo beautifully. She&rsquo;s to marry an English gentleman who&rsquo;s enormously  wealthy, and he simply dotes on Pearlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad trudged in  with a black look on his face, and a big rent in the leg of his trousers, from  which a long strip of moleskin dangled down past his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer  are you going to be before you clean those milk dishes?&rdquo; he said to Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not  finished my breakfast yet,&rdquo; Sarah answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t it  nearly time, unless you want to sit supping and cackling here till night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth  have you been doing to your clothes?&rdquo; Mother broke in, eyeing the rent in Dad&rsquo;s  pants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing!&rdquo; he  grunted. &ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil am I always doing&mdash;doing everyone&rsquo;s work as well as my  own.&rdquo; And Dad reached over Norah&rsquo;s shoulder, and lifting the butter knife from  the table, amputated the dangling remnant from his trouser leg.</p>
<p>Norah gasped, and  looked in astonishment at Mother, then at Sarah, then at the knife which Dad  replaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Dad  said, noticing Norah for the first time. &ldquo;<i>You</i> up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,  Father,&rdquo; Norah answered, turning her face to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly the  middle of the day, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And Dad went out again.</p>
<p>After breakfast,  Norah went out with Sarah, and strolled round the farmyard, holding her skirts  up, and admiring the cows and the haystacks; and she expressed astonishment at the  number of coloured pigs that were running about, and said the air was &ldquo;simply  delightful.&rdquo; Air seemed everything to Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve  forgotten the way to put a legrope on a cow, now, Norah?&rdquo; Joe said, bailing up  Silky, who had been missing during the early part of the morning.</p>
<p>Norah forced a  short laugh, and, turning to Sarah, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the air  just lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better try your  hand at milking,&rdquo; Dad said, inviting Norah into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me,&rdquo;  Norah answered, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t I look well sitting under that cow in these clothes?&rdquo;  And she laughed another short laugh, and pulled her skirts up an inch higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, tie this  round you,&rdquo; and Dad lifted several yards of greasy, dusty bagging that hung on  the rails of the yard, and tossed it carelessly to Norah. The bagging settled  on Norah&rsquo;s head, and mixed itself up with her hair and her blouse, and put dust  in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Father</i>,&rdquo; Sarah said, indignantly, &ldquo;look  what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah tore the  bagging from her head, and threw it angrily on the ground, and stamped on it,  and went crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish,  unmannerly thing to do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve destroyed my blouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie it round y&rsquo;,&rdquo;  Dad said, ignoring Norah&rsquo;s display of temper, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll keep you clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah turned away  in disgust, and was greeted by Dad&rsquo;s big black dog that had just returned from  the grass paddock with wet feet. The dog took a sudden liking to Norah, and  bounded caressingly up at her, and planted his two large moist paws on her  blouse. Norah threw up her hands, and shrieked, &ldquo;The brute! Go down!&rsquo;&rsquo; and  dodged round Sarah to evade the canine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bluey!</i>&rdquo; Sarah said, reprovingly, &ldquo;<i>Bluey!</i>&rdquo; But the brute seemed to grow  fonder of Norah, and barked at her feet, then tried to climb up on to her  shoulder, and wiped his paws on her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunt the wretch  off, Sarah,&rdquo; Norah cried, frantically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s destroying all my dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah kicked  Bluey, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooh! Be off! Go  away, Bluey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, he  won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Dad shouted, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah rushed  across the yard. Bluey bounded after her, barking joyously. He seized hold of  the tail of her dress, and hung back like a horse in the breeching. Norah  shrieked appallingly. Dad laughed. Sarah ran up, and kicked Bluey hard in the  rear, and ordered him to desist. Bluey, with the tail of the skirt firm in his  teeth, raced round Norah, and pulled her off her feet. Norah lay on her back,  and screamed blue murder, and kicked at the brute with both feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock him down  with something,&rdquo; Joe called advisingly to Sarah, then started laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid  of him, he won&rsquo;t bite. . . . Come here, dog,&rdquo; Dad said, advancing to the  rescue. Bluey took hold of Norah&rsquo;s ankle, and growled and shook it  affectionately. Norah kicked him in the eye with the shoe that was free. Bluey  released her ankle, and seized the offending shoe. It came off, and he ran away  with it in his mouth, and lay down near a haystack, and started gnawing it  triumphantly. Dad and Joe laughed. They were proud of Bluey. Norah, dishevelled  and pale-looking, struggled to her feet, and poured a torrent of unexpected  abuse on Dad.</p>
<p>Sarah made  efforts to console her sister. Dad hobbled after the dog. The dog thought to  enlist Dad in the sport, and raced towards the yard with the trophy still in  his teeth. Dad let out a few bars of profanity, intelligible to canines, and  Bluey dropped the shoe, and slunk off, crestfallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never  come near any of you,&rdquo; Norah said, when Dad restored her property to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  ashamed. So I am.&rdquo; And she returned to the house blubbering on Sarah&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You old fool,&rdquo;  Dad growled, addressing the dog, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warm you if you don&rsquo;t mind yourself.&rdquo;  Then Joe laughed feelingly at Dad, and went on milking the cow.</p>
<p>Mother and Sarah  sympathised with Norah, and assisted her to repair the damaged apparel, and  examined her ankle for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle  he didn&rsquo;t tear my flesh, the savage brute,&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;And I can never wear  that blouse again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother tried to  assure her that it was not injured to any serious extent, but Norah had her own  ideas on the matter, and went and changed it for another.</p>
<p>When Norah calmed  down she sat in the parlour for a couple of hours, and in confidence told  Mother and Sarah a lot of things that they never knew before about city life,  and the doings of well-to-do people there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be just shocked,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;if you knew some of the things that go on; and amongst people that  you would think were just perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it  said,&rdquo; Mother put in, &ldquo;that some of the men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and the <i>women</i>,&rdquo; Norah interrupted quickly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re  just as bad . . . and <i>worse</i>, some of  them.&rdquo; Then leaning forward, as if afraid someone might be listening outside,  she recounted, in low, confidential tones, the doings of numerous people who  were &ldquo;talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother was  amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  true&mdash;perfectly true,&rdquo; Norah said. &ldquo;You hardly know who you&rsquo;re talking to  sometimes. There&rsquo;s one married woman I know&mdash;&rdquo; (Norah turned and stared at the  windows and doors, then drawing closer to Mother and Sarah, detailed a lot of  things in a cautious whisper about that married woman).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, dear,  dear,&rdquo; Mother moaned, and Sarah blushed and coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really  awful,&rdquo; Norah said, screwing her face about, and throwing up her eyebrows, &ldquo;and  some of the men who you&rsquo;d think were perfect gentlemen to look at, are the most  horrible creatures living, when you come to know them. They&rsquo;re just brutes the  way they address young girls, and you can&rsquo;t insult them, because they won&rsquo;t  take an insult. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. There&rsquo;s one&mdash;an ugly, fat brute he is,  with a pug nose, and always in the street, and at the theatres and the races,  and a married man! He&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Norah&rsquo;s voice  dropped to a whisper again).</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, surely,  surely not,&rdquo; Mother said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul, he  does; it&rsquo;s a positive fact, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has he ever  said anything to you, Norah?&rdquo; Sarah asked, with a look of alarm on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h, he knows  better. . . . Oh, doesn&rsquo;t he! I&rsquo;d spit in his face if he dared to address  me&mdash;the pig!&rdquo; Norah answered. &ldquo;But the scamp had the impudence to raise his hat  one evening to a young lady friend of mine, whom he had never been introduced  to, and right in Queen Street, too! And she told me <i>this</i>, in strict confidence, herself&mdash;&rdquo; (Again Norah whispered her  information).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, oh, dear,&rdquo;  from Mother, and &ldquo;What horrible men they must be!&rdquo; from Sarah.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo; Of course,  they are not <i>all</i> bad like that,&rdquo;  Norah added, &ldquo;but there are a great many of them. You would be amazed. And I  could tell you lots of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Dad  appeared, and interrupted the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse and  sulky is there doing nothing,&rdquo; he said to Sarah, &ldquo;take it whenever you want it,  and drive your sister out somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo;  Norah exclaimed. &ldquo;That &rsquo;ll be charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the  afternoon Sarah took the sulky, and drove Norah all round the district. She  took it every afternoon, and drove Norah to different places; took it until Dad  put his foot down one day, and yelled&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;it, do you  think the horse has nothing to do but drag the two of you about the country  from morning till night? Can&rsquo;t you walk sometimes to some of the places you  want to go to? You are well enough able to&mdash;the two of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Norah  got tired of home, and went back to school again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  The Harvest Home</b></h2>
<p>The Harvest Home  at Ruddville had been talked about for several months. It was to commemorate a  season of prosperity; to be the queen event of a great and memorable year.  Everyone in the district had often shared the joys of picnics, kangaroo hunts,  dances, and riding parties, but none could recall to their memory the pleasures  of a Harvest Home; not even the &ldquo;oldest inhabitant.&rdquo; Dad himself couldn&rsquo;t, and  few things were there on earth, from fashions and social customs, to cutting  down trees and capturing bushrangers, that Dad didn&rsquo;t profess to know a good  deal about.</p>
<p>The whole country  side were invited to the Harvest Home; Dad made no distinctions; there was no  &ldquo;upper ten&rdquo; in Dad&rsquo;s circle of society. To him Cranky Jack was as good as old  Grey, and old Grey no better than old Regan or a member of Parliament. And when  Dave went with the dray for the cargo of town-made pastry and the soft drinks  and things that had arrived at the railway station, the news travelled  everywhere, and Dad became a Carnegie.</p>
<p>Dad made  elaborate preparations for the Harvest Home; marked out a ground, and cleaned  the logs and rubbish from it. It was to be held in a hollow in the top paddock,  where a clump of apple trees grew, and where the cattle used to camp during the  hot summer days. While the preparations were being carried out, Tom Grey and  Jim Brown and the young Regans felt dull, and found it difficult to work on  their own farms. After dinner they put aside their hoes and came over and  joined Dave and Joe, and gave them a hand. They climbed trees and erected  swings; yoked themselves to big logs, and dragged them away; manufactured a  cricket pitch; marked out a hundred-and-fifty-yards&rsquo; racing track; carried a  lot of water from the well, and collected a large pile of firewood. Then they  sat in the shade and perspired, and talked prophetically of the fun they&rsquo;d have  on the day, and how, if they got a chance, they&rsquo;d swing long Mary Merton over  the top of the trees, and laughed merrily in anticipation of her discomfiture,  and hoped they wouldn&rsquo;t meet Billy Doyle or Young Anderson in their heats, and  called up memories of the match between Jack Smith and Jim Billingham for five  shillings a side, till the sound of Barty&rsquo;s stockwhip and the sight of the cows  gathering at the yard, reminded Dave that it was time to start milking.</p>
<p>A bright summer  day. A strong eastern breeze sprang up, and stirred the boughs of the big  trees, and rustled the long blades of the tall corn-stalks. A blue sky, with  here and there a streak of crimson cloud slashed across it, was overhead.  Green-tinted lucerne paddocks and golden-topped maize fields, breasting each  other with draught-board regularity, stretched as far as the eye could see.  Grass waved luxuriantly everywhere; down by the headlands and along the lanes  it raised itself as high as a horse. The very wheel tracks that had been  deepening and widening for thirty years and more were reclaimed again, and  hidden with foliage. The horse paddocks were wild forests of herbage and blossoms  and wild flowers. Everything was grand. It was the time of Plenty. Prosperity  was everywhere, and all the Darling Downs was a glorious sight&mdash;a gigantic  garden good to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo;  Dad said cheerfully, as the first cart containing the Thompsons, from A. to Z.,  drew up to the big front gate. We got very excited, and Sarah rushed about with  ribbons in her hands, and whined and murmured that she &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t half ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some more,&rdquo; Bill  cried, catching sight of several horsemen turning the corner of Wilkie&rsquo;s lane,  about two miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at the  lot coming this way,&rdquo; Barty yelled, pointing to a procession of vehicles  approaching from the rear. &ldquo;Look at &rsquo;em! <i>Look</i> at &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your  tongue,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t make such a noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Barty couldn&rsquo;t  hold his tongue. The strain and excitement were too great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo-ra-ay!&rdquo; he  shouted, and waved his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you, Sir,&rdquo;  from Dad.</p>
<p>Barty humped his  back, and, like a calf after a shower of rain, bucked joyously round Dad. Dad  again said, &ldquo;Damn you, Sir,&rdquo; and kicked Barty hard. Then Barty bolted for the &ldquo;ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People began to  arrive till it was dinner-time&mdash;till it was three o&rsquo;clock&mdash;till the ground was  surrounded with carts and buggies and sulkies and drays&mdash;till the small horse-paddock  near the house was full of strange, sweat-marked horses, rolling, biting,  kicking, and trotting round and round in search of a broken panel. It was a  lively and exciting scene. You&rsquo;d think a gold-mine had broken out at Ruddville,  and the &ldquo;rush&rdquo; had arrived all at once. Dad was in his element. He hobbled  about, and in a loud homely voice, greeted this one and that one, and inquired  of the married women the number of children they had, and how old the youngest  was, and if all of them were present. And the married women expressed their  delight in loud cheerful shrieks, and reminded Dad that he hadn&rsquo;t done half bad  himself. Then they looked about, and beckoned in every direction through the  crowd of noisy youngsters and called Jamesy and Johnny and Jack, and Patsy, and  Mary, and Rosey Ann, and all the rest of their offspring to their sides, and  explained to Dad the order of their ages; told him which were born at The  Crossing, which at the Gap or The One Mile, and pointed to those that had left  school and the one that had been bitten by a snake; recounted with enthusiasm  and confusion all their peculiar ways, their characteristics, their  aspirations, and family distinctions. And Dad, in a glance at the circles of  restless progeny, recognised the likeness of old Mahoney in one, the image of  Maloney in another, and the &ldquo;dead spit&rdquo; of Andy McPherson in some more; and  some of the married women said Dad was right, and some said he was wrong, while  all of them expressed their increased delight in a series of renewed shrieks.  And Dad shook hands with all the single girls and the old maids, and called  Mary Maloney &ldquo;Bridget,&rdquo; and Cissy Thompson &ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo; and asked them why they  were not married, and when they were going to get married, and directed their  attention to Jim Smith, and Jack Coulter, and Fred Flaherty, and some more  standing close by, with grins on their faces, and spoke of them as lonely young  fellows (some of them were fifty and more) wanting wives to look after them,  and raised sickly little smiles on the faces of the old maids, and pandemonium  amongst the single girls. Then Dad, in a general way, enjoined them all to  enjoy themselves, and took a tin of lollies under his arm, and yelled for the  youngsters to follow him; and while the latter panted and fought round, he  threw the contents of the tin at them in fistfuls, and fed them like fowls.</p>
<p>The swings were  put in motion; modest young girls with pocket handkerchiefs tied round their  ankles to keep their skirts from flying away, were propelled high into the air  by big brown-armed men. &ldquo;Wet or dry,&rdquo; Joe, tossing up a bat, shouted to young  Grey, and started picking &ldquo;sides&rdquo; for the cricket match. &ldquo;Another couple wanted&rdquo;  came lustily from beneath an apple-tree, where a &ldquo;first set&rdquo; was in formation,  and a concertina hard and earnestly at work on &ldquo;The Billy Boil Over.&rdquo; In the  vicinity of another apple-tree Dave, with his horny palms, patted Jim Smith&rsquo;s  naked calves, and Tom Billigum and the Johnsons, with their pants rolled up,  practised &ldquo;starts&rdquo; in their socks. Then baskets full of cakes, and tea by the  bucket, and sacks bulging with melons, and bananas in bunches, were passed round  extravagantly, and the Harvest Home was in full swing.</p>
<p>Barty, with a  half-pealed banana in one hand, was about to swing Mary Thompson with the  other, when suddenly he became interested in the movements of Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo, Oo!&rdquo; he  shouted, &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s going to fly the kite,&rdquo; and dropping the rope bounded away, and  left Mary to work her own passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s going to  fly the kite,&rdquo; he shouted again, this time for the information of the  spectators generally, and the next moment a hundred excited youngsters were scampering  from all parts of the ground to gather round Dad. They were followed by  numerous big people; and old Talty, and old Thompson, and Andy McGladrigan and  some more, who were mooching about the paddock admiring our dairy cows,  strolled back to see what Dad &ldquo;was up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; Dad  said, placing the kite flat on the ground to adjust its tail, &ldquo;stand  back&mdash;you&rsquo;ll all see it directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a  magnificent kite&mdash;as big as the side of a house, and wonderfully well made. Dad  made it himself; made it at night. A gorgeous kite it was, too&mdash; painted all  over&mdash; Sarah painted it pink&mdash; and its tail was as long as a catching rope, and  ornamented at regular intervals with yellow and red rosettes. Mother made the  rosettes. The crowd stared long and hard at that kite; none of them had ever  seen one like it before; none of them had ever seen a kite of any kind before,  except the schoolmaster, and he grinned and reckoned it was worth a place in a  Chinese procession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; Dad  said, when he&rsquo;d fastened about two-miles of cord, strong enough to hold a  shark, to it&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get away from the trees,&rdquo; and carefully lifting the huge  curiosity, and putting it on his back, strolled out into an open patch where  there was no timber&mdash;where there was nothing but a well. The amused-looking  spectators followed him closely. The visitors&rsquo; horses exhibited a lot of  interest in the proceedings, too; and, with heads elevated, breasted the wire  fences, and stared across at Dad. Some of them snorted timidly when Dad turned  the kite broadside on, and, wheeling round, trotted excitedly in a half-circle,  and returning, breasted the fence again.</p>
<p>The day had  changed. There was now a stiff wind blowing; the boughs of the big trees were  lashing each other furiously; and everything was wildly favourable to Dad&rsquo;s  exhibition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he  called out, warningly, when all the paraphernalia was carefully adjusted, &ldquo;Stand  clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mothers and  fathers grabbed hold of their excited offspring, and dragged them to one side  to make room for Dad.</p>
<p>Dad, holding the  kite in position, emerged from the crush; he ran with it for several yards in  the direction of the small horse-paddock, then let it go. The cord whistled  through his hands, and the kite went up for about 100 feet, then took a sudden  dip, and, like a great hawk, swooped right at the staring horses. Sport! no one  expected half so much. Those horses couldn&rsquo;t leave the fence nearly quick  enough. Three of them fell down turning round, and got trampled on by the  others. The crowd enjoyed that. They yelled and laughed derisively. The horses,  bunched together, raced madly across the small enclosure with the kite spearing  them in the rear. The crowd yelled louder. The horses raced faster as they  approached the fence on the other side. The crowd suddenly ceased jeering, and  turned pale. &ldquo;Worp! worp!&rdquo; old Thompson murmured, to steady the animals but  they couldn&rsquo;t hear him. &ldquo;Got bless me! dey vill be on der vire!&rdquo; old Heinrick  cried, with grave apprehension. And old Heinrick was a good prophet. Next  moment they were on the wire&mdash;and through it, and under it, and over it, and  some of them were taking a lot of it away with them round their legs, while  others remained fast in it kicking and squealing for liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,  never mind,&rdquo; Dad said, in tones of forgiveness, as a score or so of the horse-owners  rushed away to know the worst that had happened their property, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s  nothing; a couple of new posts and a slice or two will soon put it right. Dad  wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the horses. Then, followed by a multitude of shouting  juveniles, Dad crawled into the horse paddock, and carried the kite back to the  well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tail&rsquo;s a bit  heavy,&rdquo; he said, in explanation to the crowd, and taking out his pocket-knife  amputated several joints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; and  once more Dad took a short run with the kite. This time she rose like a  powerful bird, and went up till her massive dimensions diminished to a vague  and distant speck. The audience said &ldquo;it was fine, it was grand,&rdquo; and sat down  on the grass watching the speck till their necks became stiff. Then Dad started  to haul the kite back. He pulled away until it came well into view; then the  thing became as refractory as a young horse. It kicked and swayed and plunged  and bucked, and nearly jerked Dad&rsquo;s arms out, and dragged him all about the  place. The people were delighted. Dad&rsquo;s hands got heated and sore from friction  with the cord, and he showed signs of exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me the  gloves that I pull up burr with,&rdquo; he gasped over his shoulder to Barty.</p>
<p>Barty bounded off  to the house, and returned with a pair of large leather gloves that were made  to fit Dad by the saddler.</p>
<p>Several willing  spectators offered to assist Dad in hauling the kite in, but Dad, panting and  puffing, declined their aid. It was Dad&rsquo;s show, and he was selfish about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you hold her  just till I pull the gloves on,&rdquo; he gurgled, looking round at Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;er,&rdquo;  Dave answered, picking up the end of the slack. Dad released his hold. The kite  dashed heavenwards with great suddenness. The slack cord whistled past Dad&rsquo;s  ears in coils, and somehow a ring of it got hitched round his neck, and took  him off his feet, and nearly cut his throat. Dad bellowed in a husky sort of  voice, and rose and jumped in the air. He clutched the cord above his head, and  arrested the strain till he rescued his neck. Then he let go the cord, and with  eyeballs projecting, made a rush at Dave. Dave abandoned his post, and dodged  through the crowd. Dad, roaring loud, pursued him. The kite took advantage of  their absence, and made for the constellations with great rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be away,&rdquo;  Tommy Johnson cried, grabbing at the swishing cord. It burnt his hands, and he  let go. Some more youths snapped at it, and danced away again. Little Eddy  Anderson, in his excitement, somehow got astride the cord, and made his attempt  just as the slack was spent. To the end of the slack Dad had tied a short piece  of stick. The stick left the ground like a piece of whalebone, and caught  little Eddy where his pants were slack, and made a seat for him, and took him  with it; and up he went, holding fast to the cord a few inches above his head.  He looked very surprised, but rose gracefully. The spectators lost interest in  Dad and Dave&mdash;Dad and Dave lost interest in themselves&mdash;and loud yells of alarm  mingled with bursts of merriment went up after little Eddy. Some yelled to him,  &ldquo;Let go! let go!&rdquo; Others cried, &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; and Billy Brown and Johnny Jackson,  overcome with delight, inflicted a lot of bruises on themselves by throwing  handsprings. Little Eddy, kicking his thin legs about and bawling tremendously,  soared steadily up until he was on a level with the tops of the bending,  bellying boughs of the apple trees; for a few moments he hovered there, falling  slightly, then rising. It was a grand spectacle; and no one but those who saw  it would believe it ever happened. Dad, with open mouth, just stood and glared  up at it. Dad, for a while, couldn&rsquo;t understand how little Eddy got there. Anderson  and Mrs. Anderson wrung their hands, and implored Providence and everyone about  them to do something to restore their child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he let&rsquo;s go  we could catch him,&rdquo; Hanly said, hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he <i>do</i> he&rsquo;s done fer,&rdquo; Maloney answered, and  turned away. Maloney was a Job&rsquo;s comforter. All at once little Eddy went off in  an easterly direction. A howl of woe and alarm went up, and the crowd followed  in order to catch him in something should he happen to fall. But he didn&rsquo;t  fall. He hovered round some more, then shot northwards, and took a big sweep  round the tops of all the trees, and another howl went forth, and the crowd  hurriedly shifted ground. Once more little Eddy took root in the air, then  rapidly ascended. There were loud groans. Hope seemed to forsake everyone but  Dad. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll let him back directly,&rdquo; he murmured, steadily watching the antics  of his handiwork. A moment more of suspense, and little Eddy came back with a  run of twenty or thirty feet, and calmly anchored above a fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child! my  child!&rdquo; Mrs. Anderson cried, and fell up against Anderson, and Anderson,  shouting &ldquo;Susan! Susan!&rdquo; supported her in his arms. Little Eddy drifted towards  the horse paddock, and came down another ten feet, and anchored once more.  Great excitement! A hundred hands went up, and made useless efforts to reach  him. There he floated while a babel of tongues implored him to let go. But  little Eddy seemed bereft of reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Jim  Maloney shouted, bending down &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; fashion, &ldquo;some of you get on me back.&rdquo;  About eight of them made a wild dash to get on Jim&rsquo;s back, and fell over  themselves. &ldquo;Let <i>one</i> of ye!&rdquo; Maloney  roared disapprovingly, and used bad language, between his legs. Then some  presence of mind was displayed, and Joe was allowed to elevate himself on the  broad of Maloney&rsquo;s back. Meanwhile little Eddy had gone up another foot or two.  Joe eyed him for a second, and measured the distance. Then, like a kangaroo-dog  bounding for a piece of hanging meat, he made a great spring, and securing  little Eddy round the waist, bore him to earth. Wild shouts of joy and great  triumphing. Dad pounced on the piece of stick, and, while the women embraced  little Eddy, began playing the kite with renewed vigour. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll not get away  any more,&rdquo; he said sternly, and started hauling it in again. He hauled away  till about fifty feet or so of slack cord had collected at his feet. Then  Maloney snatched up the end of it, and, running to the well, fastened it to the  windlass, and started winding vigorously. The spectators laughed. Dad, feeling  the strain, looked round. &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; he cried approvingly, and hobbled back,  and joined Maloney. &ldquo;Wind away,&rdquo; Dad said encouragingly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll keep it  straight.&rdquo; And he stood on the door of the well, and manipulated the coiling cord  with both hands. Just then the kite descended suddenly, and much slack cord  fell about the windlass. &ldquo;Wind quick,&rdquo; Dad shouted, &ldquo;before she goes up again.&rdquo;  But the kite swept up at a terrific pace, and snapped the cord, and. took a  piece off one of Dad&rsquo;s fingers away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dam, but she&rsquo;s  gone,&rdquo; Maloney cried, looking up.</p>
<p>And the crowd  realising the fact, exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah&mdash;h!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad, holding the  wounded finger under his arm, danced silently round the well for quite a long  interval. When he spoke it was in a loud certain voice, but the kite was then  out of sight.</p>
<p>Then the sun went  down on the apple trees and the green grasslands; hands gripped hands,  good-byes were said, a hundred carts strung out through the big white gate, and  the Harvest Home was over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
  A Jolly Good Fellow</b></h2>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s second  house, with its verandahs all round, and iron pallisading adorning it, and new  tanks and iron roof glistening in the sun, was a princely-looking palace when  completed. And the furniture that Dad ordered from town to put in it was  luxurious enough for Government House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s far too  good,&rdquo; Mother said, when she saw it, &ldquo;a long way too good, Father,&rdquo; and she  shook her head disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of  it,&rdquo; Dad answered, &ldquo;not a bit of it . . . let them have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Sarah  saw it she thought Dad had gone stark staring mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plush chairs,&rdquo;  she sneered, &ldquo;good gracious me . . . for Dave to be putting his big feet on. .  . . Why they won&rsquo;t last a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she laughed  a nasty jealous sort of laugh.</p>
<p>But after reflection  Sarah was inclined to take a different view of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any  rate,&rdquo; she added, patronisingly, &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll treat the rest of us the same  way when we&rsquo;re getting married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother had no  doubt Dad would, and Sarah was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you all  to come over for tea, to-morrow evening,&rdquo; Dave said, dropping in one morning  while we were at breakfast, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; of havin&rsquo; a bit of a party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Dad  said, &ldquo;very good, we&rsquo;ll come across.&rdquo; And Bill, with his mouth full of fried  potatoes, tried to raise a cheer, but Dad promptly silenced him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your noise,  you donkey,&rdquo; Dad said, and we grinned at Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll come,  too, Sarah,&rdquo; Dave added, with a significant look at his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect so,&rdquo;  Sarah mumbled, feigning an indifference she didn&rsquo;t feel, &ldquo;if they&rsquo;re all  going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t  forget, now?&rdquo; And Dave glanced at all of us again, and then went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a real good  mind not to go,&rdquo; Sarah remarked to Mother during the afternoon, &ldquo;so I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, girl,&rdquo;  Mother said, &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo; Then Sarah went and ransacked her  wardrobe, and spent hours searching for ribbons to convert into bows, with  which she decorated her best white muslin dress to wear on the occasion.</p>
<p>It was scarcely  dark next evening, and we had only just come in after hurrying from the  paddocks, when we heard someone playing an accordion in tune at the new house,  and knew it wasn&rsquo;t Dave. Our hearts beat fast at the sound of that music.  Somehow, music always had a charm for our family. Then a rush and a scrimmage  for collars and shirts and clean socks set in, and loud and confused enquiries  were made for studs and sleeve links, and in a few moments everything was  thrown into disorder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look for  them y&rsquo;selves,&rdquo; Sarah snapped from the depths of her own room. &ldquo;All y&rsquo; things  were left on your beds for y&rsquo; . . . go and find them . . . I&rsquo;ve enough to do to  find things for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things, y&rsquo; call  them,&rdquo; Bill shouted back from his end of the establishment, &ldquo;y&rsquo; left a pair of  trousers here that I wouldn&rsquo;t go milkin&rsquo; in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wear them,  then, and don&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; Sarah retorted, adjusting her dress before a glass  and fixing bows on herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Tom  howled, seizing Barty by the neck, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my stud you&rsquo;ve on, and I&rsquo;ve been  huntin&rsquo; everywhere for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me own,&rdquo;  Barty bellowed, dodging Tom in and out among the furniture, &ldquo;Dave give it to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a  fight and two chairs less to sit on next day. Joe, without having experienced  any difficulty whatever in habilitating himself, and without having taken any  part in the row over lost wearing apparel, stole quietly away from his room,  and was moving stealthily off when Bill, with a lighted candle in his hand,  intercepted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Bill  said, detaining Joe with one hand, and holding the candle up to him with the  other, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my tie&mdash;that&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; for all night. Off with  it; come on. No wonder you&rsquo;ve been so quiet, me noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This? <i>This?</i>&rdquo; Joe said, placing his hand on the  decoration; &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re wrong. There&rsquo;s two th&rsquo; very same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where&rsquo;s  the other, then?&rdquo; Bill demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the looking  glass,&rdquo; and Joe hurried his brother off to procure it. Then he hurried himself  off; jumped from the verandah, and ran to reach Dave&rsquo;s place before Bill could  pursue him.</p>
<p>The rest of us  didn&rsquo;t go in a body to Dave&rsquo;s place,&mdash;we marched off as we got ready, and, like  Brown&rsquo;s cows, arrived on the heels of each other, Dad and Sarah bringing up the  rear.</p>
<p>A great surprise  awaited Dad and the rest of us when we went inside. The appearance of the  dining room suggested a sumptuous banquet. The long table, decorated with  serviettes and ferns and flowers, was laden with almost every kind of dish and  dainty. A lot of Dad&rsquo;s old friends were congregated there: Anderson, from  Shingle Hut, Grey, Mulrooney, Watkins, Fahey, Charley Thompson, old Fraser, and  their wives and daughters. And Dad greeted them with great delight.</p>
<p>Lily and Sarah  forgot past feuds, too, and once more met as sisters again. Sarah  enthusiastically eyed the things on the table, and promptly proceeded to  re-arrange the ferns and flowers. She re-arranged the whole table, even to the  placing of the chairs, and in a few seconds was running the whole party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; Dave  said, coming forward, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all here. We&rsquo;ll make a start,&rdquo; and the company  rose and collected merrily round the table.</p>
<p>Anderson was put  at the head. Dad was given the place of honour on Anderson&rsquo;s right, and Dave  sat on his left.</p>
<p>As the meal  proceeded they chatted cheerfully about Dave&rsquo;s house; admired its tall lofty rooms,  and compared its convenience and comfort with the wretched old humpies of days  gone by. And a spirit of friendliness and good feeling was over all.</p>
<p>Lily and Sarah  passed round glasses and various kinds of wine; and we wondered what was coming  next.</p>
<p>Then Anderson  rose and said he had a toast to propose. Glancing down at Dad, he said that Mr.  Rudd was his oldest and best friend. He had known Dad for more than forty  years&mdash;had known him before he took up land on Shingle Hut in the hard old days,  and he could say that if ever there was a man who deserved to get on and be  happy in this world that man was Murtagh Joseph Rudd.</p>
<p>The Greys and  Watkins and old Fraser and the rest rattled their glasses, and cried, &ldquo;Hear,  hear,&rdquo; while we stared in surprise and admiration at our parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever there  was a man who won his way,&rdquo; Anderson went on, &ldquo;by industry and hard work, and  honesty, that man was my old neighbour and my old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anderson placed  his hand affectionately and dramatically upon Dad&rsquo;s grey head. And the glasses  rang and rattled again, and old Fraser, above the din, called out feelingly, &ldquo;Aye,  but he&rsquo;s honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Anderson  told of the trials and struggles that Dad went through in the early days, and  brought sad memories to Mother&rsquo;s heart and tears to her eyes, and filled the  rest of us with a new and strange pride in Dad. We felt that his virtues were  only now being revealed to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I ask you,&rdquo;  Anderson said, &ldquo;to fill your glasses and drink to the health of Mr. Rudd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They filled their  glasses, and as they held them high above their heads, and lifted their voices  and sang, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a jolly good fellow,&rdquo; Dad remained seated, his broad chest  heaving with emotion, his head bowed down, and his eyes fixed on the things  before him. And&mdash;there let us leave him. </p>
