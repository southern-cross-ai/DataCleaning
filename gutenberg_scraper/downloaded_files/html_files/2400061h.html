  Narralane</b></h2>
<p>For many years the inhabitants of Narralane were wild and rough and  irreverent. They never said prayers nor grace, and never went to church. They  never knew any prayers nor grace to say, and never had a church to go to. When  they weren&rsquo;t working on Sundays they were cutting each other&rsquo;s hair, or making  greenhide leg-ropes, or breaking in horses. And hair was cut regularly in those  days, and horses well broken.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page002.jpg" alt="haircut" width="551" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>But everything has changed since then. Now it is lawless and wicked to  do anything round Narralane on Sunday except milk cows and go to church. And a  fine church they have to go to, too. Years and years it took to build it&mdash;at  least it took years to get the people to decide upon building it, and it took  many more years to gather in all the money promised towards it. McClure&rsquo;s  contribution was the hardest of all to gather in. McClure wasn&rsquo;t a man to give  quickly to a church. For a long while he could never see anything in a church.  A new culvert or a factory he could understand, but a church was beyond him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the guid o&rsquo; it?&rdquo; he would say! &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nae use&mdash;you can put  naething in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when, after a lot of persistence, he was finally induced to  subscribe five pounds towards the building fund, McClure became enthusiastic.  He attended the meetings, and hastened operations. He seemed afraid that the  committee would disappear in the night, and take the building fund with them,  and couldn&rsquo;t rest until the timber was on the ground, and the carpenter&rsquo;s  hammers going. But when the building was up, McClure went cold on church  matters again, and wasn&rsquo;t heard of any more until one day McIntyre and McGregor  came along with a new subscription list, and asked for something towards the  minister&rsquo;s stipend. Then McClure was heard all over several paddocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these have put their names down for something, Mr. McClure,&rdquo;  McIntyre said, in a conciliatory tone, and read the list out. &ldquo;We only want  sixty pounds subscribed altogether, and the minister will come to the church,  and preach for us every month. The rest of his stipend, &pound;120 a year altogether,  will be paid by the Springfield congregation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confoond it, then! <i>There!</i>&rdquo;  McClure bellowed angrily, throwing a pound note down hard on the table. &ldquo;<i>There!</i> and don&rsquo;t come near me ony mair  wi&rsquo; your stipends an&rsquo; your preachin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McIntyre and McGregor thanked McClure, and went away smiling.</p>
<p>The minister arrived one Sunday, and preached his opening sermon, and  made a good impression on his congregation. They were all delighted with him,  and, at the close of the service, gathered round him. Mothers who thought he  looked like a single man introduced their big daughters to him and invited him  to their homes. The men lifted their hats and stared reverently upon him, and  went and put the harness on his horse, and yoked the animal to the rickety  little sulky for him. And when he drove away they stared longingly after him,  and said he was a good man.</p>
<p>All through the week the congregation talked of the minister, and  recalled parts of his sermon, and solemnly agreed that his interpretations of  the Scriptures were the real ones. And they eagerly looked forward to his visit  the following month, and the month after. And when he began to call at their  homes on week days, they left their work to welcome him; made tea for him, too,  and pressed him to stay all night with them. In a while he became part of the  district, and could never be done without. No event or gathering of any  description was complete without his presence. And the congregation were for  ever sending for him, and carting him round the country. When it wasn&rsquo;t to  perform a marriage they required him, it was to christen somebody&rsquo;s baby, or to  read the burial service over someone who had died without giving them any  warning. And no matter what kind of weather it was&mdash;whether fog, hail, or mud up  to the axles&mdash;he was expected to come along to time just the same, and to wear a  look of happiness or sympathy as the case might require. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Ah, it was hard on the poor  parson! Harder sometimes than camping out in the wet, or putting corn in with a  hoe. And his rounds were never ended. For fifteen, twenty, and thirty miles he  would have to urge his lean, jaded horse along over roads that ran into ugly  creeks and dark gullies, and up the sides of mountain ranges. And sometimes the  animal would knock up, and the parson would sigh and get out of the trap and  lead him, or leave him by the roadside, and walk on alone with his Bible under  his arm.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page004.jpg" alt="walk" width="516" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Often, too, his wife would be in delicate health, and his two younger  children in the throes of whooping-cough, and he would have to take them all  with him in the sulky, and put them up at the rude habitations of some of his  congregation&mdash;perhaps at one place one night and at another the next, where  they were served liberally with salt junk and pumpkin for supper and the same  for breakfast, while a number of bags would be spread on the beds for blankets.  Ah, yes, the poor parson&rsquo;s lot at Narralane was not an enviable one. No one  cared to exchange jobs with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor soul!&rdquo; some outsiders used to say when remarking on his wan  and worn features, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re workin&rsquo; him quite poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in due course the minister got to know and to understand his  congregation, and knew exactly what was required of him. No matter whose  christening or wedding it was&mdash;or whether it was Mr. and Mrs. Grey&rsquo;s health he  was proposing, or old Regan (the cattle stealer) and his wife&rsquo;s, he was  expected to praise them up just the same; and he would praise them up, and make  out they were held in the highest esteem by everyone in the district, and would  talk of them as &ldquo;big-hearted&rdquo; and &ldquo;hospitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;honest.&rdquo; Oh! the perjury  the minister had to commit sometimes to keep his billet was a terrible  reflection on the new church. It was enough to cause a curse to settle on it  for all time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter  2<br>
  The Parson Gets into Debt</b></h2>
<p>Twelve months passed. The congregation didn&rsquo;t think so much of the  minister now. They hadn&rsquo;t any gratitude left for him at all. His sermons, they  thought, weren&rsquo;t nearly so good as they used to be, and they said his wife was  proud and stuck up. And when Mrs. McStraw found out through a relation that she  had been a Methodist before she had married the minister, they couldn&rsquo;t suffer  her any more, and couldn&rsquo;t forgive the minister either for marrying her. Mrs.  McGregor, too, complained about him. She told everyone that he had said a lot  of nasty things at her place about the Andersons&mdash;things that a minister had no  right to say about anyone. And when the Andersons heard about it, they left the  church.</p>
<p>Several months went past, and the congregation became more and more  dissatisfied, and many of them became irregular attendants at the services. The  Galbraiths, who lived in a mountain gorge, about twenty miles away, took  umbrage because the minister omitted to call on them the night he walked twelve  miles to bury Mrs. Tomkins, and administer solace when their haystacks got  burnt down, and withdrew altogether.</p>
<p>But the last straw was added to the congregation&rsquo;s burden of  dissatisfaction when word came from Springfield that the minister owed Bailey,  the storekeeper, twenty-five pounds, and wasn&rsquo;t able to pay any of it. Everyone  said it was disgraceful. They called it a &ldquo;downright shame.&rdquo; McGregor shook his  head, and said he must be &ldquo;a mon wi&rsquo; no honour,&rdquo; and demanded a meeting be held  right away to ask him to resign.</p>
<p>The majority of the congregation agreed with McGregor, and in due  course a meeting was called at which the minister was invited to be present,  but he could not attend. He was sent for the same evening to visit a person who  was dying at Cattle Creek, twenty-five miles away. But his wife attended.</p>
<p>McGregor, who presided, said he was sorry the reverend gentleman didn&rsquo;t  have the courage to face the meeting, and the audience stamped its feet, and  said &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; and turned their faces in triumph to the minister&rsquo;s wife,  who started to cry. Then he made hostile remarks about the minister&rsquo;s  indebtedness to Bailey, the grocer, and said it rested with the meeting to take  action. The minister&rsquo;s wife rose in the body of the church, and her eyes  flashed. She pointed her finger at them, and in loud, dramatic tones said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>you</i> who are indebted to <i>him</i>. You have not paid him his stipend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she broke down.</p>
<p>There was a silence.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page008.jpg" alt="debt" width="509" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>McClure rose then, and cleared his throat and went into figures. He was  always a great man for figures. He asked the chairman what the minister&rsquo;s  stipend amounted to. The chairman didn&rsquo;t know. He leaned over, and asked  McIntyre, and McIntyre referred to the secretary. The secretary opened a book,  and turned some loose leaves over, and said it was sixty pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty pounds,&rdquo; McClure echoed; &ldquo;and hasna he been paid it reg&rsquo;lar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, during which everyone looked anxiously at the  secretary, who kept turning over more leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasna he been paid it reg&rsquo;lar?&rdquo; McClure yelled, with emphasis.</p>
<p>The secretary said he thought not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasna he been paid ony o&rsquo; it, then?&rdquo; McClure bellowed angrily.</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five pounds he got last June,&rdquo; the secretary stammered, &ldquo;and two  pounds two in May makes seven pounds two. He couldn&rsquo;t get any more because all  those who put their names down haven&rsquo;t paid up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t paid?&rdquo; McClure howled. &ldquo;And you expeckit the man to pay his  debts when you don&rsquo;t pay him his salary? What kind of men are ye at a&rsquo;? Why it  is yersels that are in debt! Is that the way to run a kirk? Is it the way,  think ye, tae run a fowl hoose? Shame on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the meeting arose and went out dejectedly. </p>
<p>Then McClure handed the minister&rsquo;s wife a cheque for &pound;25 and she burst  into tears again, and hid her face in her hands. And the meeting closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter  3<br>
  Racing and Chasing</b></h2>
<p>For several weeks after holding their meeting to call upon the minister  to resign, the congregation at Narralane seemed ashamed of themselves, and used  to avoid their pastor. Whenever they saw his familiar form coming along the  lanes, on horseback, they would hide themselves in the tall corn, and dodge  behind haystacks, or disappear into the gullies, every one of them. But their  minister had no grudge against any of them, and bore no malice. He met them in  their homes with an encouraging smile, and extended his soft, white hand to  them. And when any of them ventured a clumsy apology, he told them it didn&rsquo;t  matter; asked them not to think of it again, and was sure the incident would  only help them to understand him better. Encouraged thus by his kindly,  Christian attitude, each of them in turn proceeded to put all the blame on  those who were absent, and assured the minister that if they had &ldquo;only known at  the time,&rdquo; they would not have done this, that, or the other; and committed a  lot more perjury. Then they entered into church matters with more zeal than  ever, and made reckless suggestions to the minister about promoting bazaars or  purchasing a small organ, or decorating the interior of the church on  thanksgiving services, and showed much eagerness to do anything and everything  that might please and encourage the minister.</p>
<p>And when the poor parson would take his leave, they would stand at  their doors and watch him go away, and say &ldquo;he wasn&rsquo;t such a bad chap after  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Church Sunday</i>. Milking was just finished at &ldquo;Loch Ness,&rdquo;  Duncan McClure&rsquo;s farm, and Duncan, the short, thick, big-waisted, big-hearted,  fat-fisted, happy-go-lucky Scot, with a lot of humour in his blue eyes,  strolled leisurely about the yard whistling snatches of the Highland Fling, and  yelling out orders to the boys about the cows and the milk pails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;, Peter,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s gaun to be sairvice at the kirk  the day, so when you&rsquo;ve had a mouthful o&rsquo; grub you&rsquo;d better tak&rsquo; the broon  mere, and go and meet the pairrson at Springfield, and bring the auld chap back  wi&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got nae horse o&rsquo; his ain noo, ye ken,&rdquo; Duncan went on; &ldquo;he rode  it, so Billy Bacon was tellin&rsquo; me, till it just laid doon under him ae day, and  dee&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys laughed more, and Peter said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think the mare would be a bit too flash for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be th&rsquo; wars, no, Peter,&rdquo; the parent answered: &ldquo;pairrsons are great  riders, ye ken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More merriment from the boys; and Duncan, with a broad smile on his  hairy, genial face, added roguishly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a gran&rsquo; larrk, though, to see her buck th&rsquo; auld chap  aff in that lang black coat he wears when he&rsquo;s marryin&rsquo; folk, wouldn&rsquo;t it,  Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And having provoked another round of hilarity from his offspring,  Duncan turned and waddled off to breakfast; and when his wife inquired from him  &ldquo;if the boys were coming,&rdquo; he smiled and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re up there at the yairrd, Vi., laughin&rsquo; like th&rsquo; very deil at  the auld pairrson.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Afternoon.</i> The half-acre yard that enclosed the little  country church, standing off the main road, was formed into a hollow square of  horses of all sorts and stamps. There was an animal of some kind or other  fastened to every post and to every panel; some with harness on, some with  men&rsquo;s saddles on, and some with nothing but long hair and sweat marks on. Under  a few straggly gum trees, that shaded one corner of the ground, a few sulkies  and a buggy were standing with the shafts resting on the fence for protection.</p>
<p>In the scant shade of the crude, weatherboard building, the  congregation were gathered in wait for the minister. The women, with their  umbrellas raised, and Bibles in their hands, stood round in small groups,  asking after each other&rsquo;s health, and recounting the difficulties they had had  during the week, which had been a wet one, in getting their washing dry. The  men sat on their heels, their backs to the wall of the building, beating the  flies off, and occasionally greeting a new arrival with &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; and the new  arrival would say &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; too, and wedge himself in amongst them, and squeeze  someone else out into the sun. Now and again they would exhibit signs of  impatience, and drawl, &ldquo;Time &rsquo;e was comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McClure, who had been poking about inside the church, dusting the  pulpit and arranging the seats, came out bareheaded, his big hands buried deep  in the pockets of his capacious trousers, and displaying a large, ill-fitting  tweed coat that buttoned up close to his collarless neck and fell like a cloak  over his tremendous corporation, and solemnly approached the others. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Day, Duncan,&rdquo; they said, and smiled. (They always smiled when they  said &ldquo;good day&rdquo; to Duncan.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, chaps,&rdquo; Duncan answered, in a loud voice, and leaning well  back, as was his habit, and, looking down over his stomach at them, added, &ldquo;Are  y&rsquo; rready to have your sins seen to?&quot; </p>
<p>They grinned and chuckled alternately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, the auld boy ought to be here sune,&rdquo; and Duncan inserted his fat  fist in the recesses of his great coat, and extracted a large family watch of  rare and ancient pattern, which he considered long and earnestly.</p>
<p>The others continued to grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a rum thing,&rdquo; he said, putting the &ldquo;turnip&rdquo; to his woolly  ear, &ldquo;th&rsquo; bloomin&rsquo; wheels o&rsquo;t are gaun roon just like a corn-sheller, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m  hanged if th&rsquo; han&rsquo;s has shifted sin&rsquo; I cleant masel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others broke into a loud laugh, but were interrupted by Henry  Thompson bounding suddenly to his feet, and exclaiming excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here! Save us&mdash;look! look! the <i>Parson!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every man of them jumped up, and looked. The women lowered their umbrellas,  and looked too. The medley of horses forming the hollow square elevated their  heads, pricked their ears and became restless, and threatened to break their  bridles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;His horse is bolting with him!&rdquo;  some cried, and all rushed for positions at the fence to see what was the  matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s my mare, tae!&rdquo; Duncan cried, &ldquo;an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s a deil to haud. Lord,  jist look at th&rsquo; auld boy comin&rsquo; it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women set up a chorus of screams, as the mare approached at racing  speed, with the parson clinging round her neck, his hat gone, and his trousers  working up till his white shins were showing like rolls of paper.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page013.jpg" alt="clinging" width="750" height="589"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s riding to catch him, and he can&rsquo;t draw on him,&rdquo; some more  called out, and the next moment the bay mare flashed past the church like a cup  winner, and old Hamilton&rsquo;s buggy horse broke from his moorings, and careered  round the enclosure with the harness hanging to him. Peter, using whip and spur  to overtake his charge, drew level with the church, and the spectators yelled  to him to know what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goanner on &rsquo;im,&rdquo; was all they heard, and Peter shot past like a cup  loser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a goanner on him,&rdquo; Jimmy Brown yelled, excitedly, &ldquo;a bloomin&rsquo;  goanner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a dozen other voices declared they &ldquo;saw it&mdash;saw it stickin&rsquo; to the  mare&rsquo;s rump.&rdquo; Then a wild rush took place for saddle horses, and the next  moment most of the congregation were spurring their mounts through the open  gate, and racing up the road in hot pursuit of the parson and Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crikey, can&rsquo;t the auld boy stick?&rdquo; Duncan said, turning with simple  admiration to the excited females.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> couldna ha&rsquo; stuck like  him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the women looked with amusement at Duncan, and some of them,  thinking of the minister, murmured: &ldquo;The poor man will be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naethin&rsquo; can vera weel happen him,&rdquo; Duncan added; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a life-savin&rsquo;  apparatus himsel&rsquo;, y&rsquo; ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Duncan was not a good prophet. Something did happen. The poor  parson parted with the mare at Hanley&rsquo;s fence, and was carried back to the  church by Bailey, the storekeeper, and three or four others, in an unconscious  condition.</p>
<p>The congregation gathered round his prostrate form with looks of sorrow  and alarm on their faces. The women wept and prayed hysterically for his  recovery. The men argued as to what was the best thing to do, and a half-dozen of  them raced off in different directions on the same errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wudna gie him whusky,&rdquo; Duncan said, in solemn protest when one of  the messengers returned, and handed Bailey a bottle. Bailey said it was the  best thing to give an injured man, and was supported by Mrs. Bailey and several  others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s stric&rsquo; teetotal,&rdquo; Duncan answered, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if y&rsquo; gie him whusky  when he canna decide for himsel&rsquo;, he&rsquo;ll be in a deil o&rsquo; a rage wi&rsquo; us a&rsquo; when  he comes roon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bailey was a strong man, and proceeded to have his way. &ldquo;Weel,  then,&rdquo; Duncan added, withdrawing his protest, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re gaun to gie him ony at  a&rsquo;, gie him a guid skinfu&rsquo;.&rdquo; Bailey administered the liquor in moderation, and  the minister, after a while, opened his eyes and looked around, and a heavy  load of anxiety was lifted from the minds of those attending. They chafed his  hands and looked into his face, and inquired if he were hurt, and if he felt  better. Soon, however, he was able to raise himself, and they placed him gently  in the bottom of a buggy. And while Peter McClure explained to the wondering  crowd how a large &ldquo;goanner&rdquo; that he, Peter, had taken by the tail and dragged  off a gate post, fell to the ground and ran blindly up the mare&rsquo;s leg, and  started her bolting, the poor parson was driven off to McIntyre&rsquo;s place, and  ministered to. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter  4<br>
  The Twelve Sovereigns</b></h2>
<p>For several weeks the minister was unable to leave his house, and  church work at Narralane fell into arrears. So did the minister&rsquo;s grocery bill  at Bailey&rsquo;s store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a good season, you know, Duncan,&rdquo; Bailey said to McClure one  day at the factory, &ldquo;and I think something should be done to relieve the  parson. He&rsquo;s had bad luck&mdash;very bad luck&mdash;and between ourselves, and I wouldn&rsquo;t  say it to anyone but yourself, I know he&rsquo;s in need of a little help. Do you  understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understan&rsquo; weel,&rdquo; Duncan replied, &ldquo;fer I was thinkin&rsquo; aboot him the  day, and I thocht it would be a Christianlike thing if a few sovereigns were  colleckit and gi&rsquo;en to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey said that that was what he was going to suggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very weel, then,&rdquo; Duncan added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Brown and Bennet aboot it  th&rsquo; morn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan saw Brown and Bennet, and a subscription was started right away,  and Bailey was made treasurer of the fund.</p>
<p>An energetic canvass was also made throughout the district; the hearts  of the church people responded, and in a short time a sum of &pound;12 was collected  for the poor parson. Duncan and Bailey were delighted&mdash;especially Bailey&mdash;and  they decided to hold a gathering of those who subscribed and make the  presentation to the minister a happy and memorable event.</p>
<p>A date was fixed, and it was a great occasion. The little church was  packed with sympathisers, and several tables were laden with cakes and  gingerbeer, and elaborately decorated with ferns and flowers. Bailey was  nominated spokesman, and he rose and enumerated all the minister&rsquo;s good  qualities, and, at the conclusion of his remarks, stepped forward, and handed  the purse to him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have much pleasure, Mr. McCulloch, in handing you a purse of  sovereigns subscribed by everyone here this evening.&rdquo; The parson received the  surprise of his life. His breath was taken completely away, and, when he rose  to thank them for the kindly gift, the tears trickled down his cheeks, and his  voice filled with genuine emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can assure you all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it comes at a most opportune  moment&mdash;at a moment when it is much needed, and I thank you from the bottom of  my heart for your goodness and generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he put the purse carefully away in his breast pocket, and when he  reached home, after driving eight miles in the dark, across a broad and lonely  plain, he hastened to his bedroom to break the cheerful tidings to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve sovereigns for me, Jean,&rdquo; he said excitedly, emptying the  contents into her open hand, &ldquo;twelve sovereigns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife started to smile. &ldquo;Really, Donald?&rdquo; she said. Then her  features underwent a sudden change. So did the poor parson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Some silver and a receipted bill of Bailey&rsquo;s for &pound;11 15s. were in the  purse, but no sovereigns. For a moment their eyes met in silence. Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>May the Lord forgive him, Jean</i>,&rdquo; the poor parson said, and sank low  into a chair. </p>

  Bill Eaglefoot Visits the Manse</b></h2>
<p>The place in which the poor parson and his family lived at Springfield  was not a grand habitation. Everyone called it &ldquo;The Manse.&rdquo; Why they called it  &ldquo;The Manse&rdquo; none of them seemed to know. It was a poky, tumbledown old rookery  of four small rooms, a verandah, and a skillion, roofed over with shingles, out  of which the very nails had long since rotted and rolled into the spouting. The  people about Springfield preferred a shingle roof to any kind; they said  shingle roofs looked better than any others, and were a lot cooler. But no  living person, except old McAdam, who was ninety-one years of age, and Grannie  Anderson, who was ninety-two, could remember having seen any of the shingle on  &ldquo;The Manse.&rdquo; A vigorous green vine of great antiquity had grown up, and crept  all over it, and concealed the shingle from view. It also covered the slabs,  and kept many of them from falling out and hurting someone.</p>
<p>For many years &ldquo;The Manse&rdquo; had been the miserable residence of Bailey,  the storekeeper; and Bailey always looked forward to the time when he could  afford to build himself a new house and put a fire-stick in the old one. That  time came at last&mdash;came just when the parson received a call to the district.  Then Bailey changed his mind, and formed a new love for the old &ldquo;caboose.&rdquo; He  became proud of it, and spoke of it as &ldquo;a comfortable little house,&rdquo; and  thought it was &ldquo;just the place to suit the minister until the funds of the  church increased and a proper manse could be erected for him&rdquo;; and Bailey, in  the interests of the church, made a sacrifice, and placed the old rookery at  the disposal of the church committee, of which he himself was one, for the use  of the parson at eight shillings a week. And the committee, in their simplicity,  appreciated Bailey&rsquo;s benevolence and rented the humpy from him.</p>
<p>Eight years went by, and nothing ever increased at Springfield, except  the poor parson&rsquo;s family and the rent, which Bailey, to make up for the cost of  a few second-hand floor boards, which he had put down one day, raised to nine  shillings a week.</p>
<p>Four little children the parson had running about &ldquo;The Manse&rdquo; (Raymond,  the eldest boy, had won his way to the University, and was away in Sydney), and  how he managed to accommodate them all when night came on the Lord only could  tell&mdash;none of the congregation ever could.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page019.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="503" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding its age and dilapidated appearance, though, &ldquo;The Manse&rdquo;  was a fine object lesson to the rough inhabitants of the surrounding districts  in homeliness; and members of the congregation, and many who were not members,  delighted to call and spend an hour or two there whenever business took them to  the township. And they were always sure of a kindly welcome from the poor  parson and his wife. Many of them, too, called when they had no business at the  township; and some of the younger girls of the different localities would  gather together, and ride ten and fifteen miles to see Mrs. McCulloch, and  spend an afternoon with her. And what delight those visits always brought to the  poor parson&rsquo;s wife! She would run with open arms to meet the girls at the  rickety, hingeless garden gate, greet them by their Christian names, conduct  them inside, and give them tea and scones and cakes that she had made herself.  She would ask kindly after their parents and brothers and sisters; show them  all the peach and apricot and melon jams she had made during the week, and  display the &ldquo;big ironing&rdquo; she had done, and the dress she was making for  herself out of material which only cost her four and sixpence. In a casual way  she would draw light-hearted comparisons between the troubles and worries that  surrounded her and the days of comfort and luxury she had known when a single  girl in the old country, and she would answer their many well-meaning questions,  until the girls knew as much about her birth-place, and family history, and  college days as she did herself. And when the afternoon was spent, and it was  time to return home, the girls would be sorry and reluctant to take leave of  the poor parson&rsquo;s wife. But they always promised to come again the following  week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mrs. McCulloch,&rdquo; they would say, when riding along the road, &ldquo;she  must feel it hard, after being brought up so well, and used to the best of  everything, to come out here, and be so poor; and have to do all her own work  like that, and bring up a big family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far harder on her than it would be on any of us,&rdquo; they would add, with  a sigh, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ve been reared to it, and never knew anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes! they were kind and thoughtful girls, those country girls of  Narralane!</p>
<p>Others, too, who didn&rsquo;t belong to his congregation would sometimes call  at &ldquo;The Manse&rdquo; to see the parson; some to seek assistance or sympathy in their  misfortunes and setbacks; some to ask advice in their domestic differences, and  some to beg; but none were ever received indifferently or refused a favour by  the poor parson of Springfield.</p>
<p>Bill Eaglefoot, a useless sort of &ldquo;handy man&rdquo; who existed by doing  small jobs in a costly way for farmers who didn&rsquo;t always regard him as a  nuisance, called at &ldquo;The Manse&rdquo; to see the parson late one evening. The poor  parson invited Bill inside, and asked him to sit down. But Bill wasn&rsquo;t a man to  impose on anyone&rsquo;s hospitality when he was bent on business, and preferred to  stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what service can I render to you?&rdquo; the parson asked, kindly.</p>
<p>Bill twirled his shabby, old, felt hat round his fingers, and  stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I come to see you about, sir, is, after all, I s&rsquo;pect, only what  plenty others have come to see you about, and I s&rsquo;pect lots more will come to  see you about, if your life is spared, as I hope it will be, sir, God bless  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill paused for breath, and to give the poor parson a chance to  interrogate him. The parson didn&rsquo;t exactly follow the meaning of his guest, and  looked wonderingly at him, and waited for him to proceed.</p>
<p>Bill twirled his hat some more, then took courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s about getting married I&rsquo;ve come to see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page022.jpg" alt="hat" width="477" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; the parson said, beginning to understand Bill; &ldquo;oh&mdash;h, that&rsquo;s  it,&rdquo; and he smiled benignly on Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Bill said, looking very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very simple,&rdquo; and the poor parson moved to his little  writing-table which stood in the corner of the dining room, and rummaged for  official forms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bill said anxiously, noting the minister&rsquo;s movements; &ldquo;but I  don&rsquo;t want to do it now; <i>she</i> ain&rsquo;t  here; I haven&rsquo;t her with me, y&rsquo; know, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take a few particulars,&rdquo; the parson replied, with a look of  assurance, &ldquo;and the rest can be fixed up on whatever day you have decided  between you for the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; and Bill proceeded to give the parson the information he  required about himself and his &ldquo;intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lizzie Lake, of Narralane,&rdquo; Bill said, nervously, when the parson  asked the girl&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lake&mdash;of Narralane?&rdquo; the poor parson repeated with a puzzled look on  his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; and Bill twirled his hat harder than ever, and shifted  restlessly about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard the name before,&rdquo; the parson said, &ldquo;and I thought I was  intimate with all at Narralane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t know her,&rdquo;  Bill said; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s only workin&rsquo; there same as meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has she reached her majority?&rdquo; queried the parson. Bill was  perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she under or over twenty-one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be,&rdquo; from Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But under or over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill reflected. Then replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, over it a long way; she must be forty if she&rsquo;s a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson smiled, and placed the form in a drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if your party can make it convenient to be present here on  Wednesday, at, say, four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, I&rsquo;ll be ready with everything  then.&rdquo; And he rose and shook hands with Bill at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Bill murmured, hesitating and twirling the hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope it will be a joyful and a happy union,&rdquo; the parson added,  for Bill&rsquo;s benefit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; from Bill again. Then there was an awkward silence.</p>
<p>After awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like askin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; Bill broke out, &ldquo;&rsquo;pon me word, I don&rsquo;t,  but could you lend me a few shillings, sir, just to take me back to Narralane  to-night, and I could bring it to you on Wednesday; that is, if you don&rsquo;t  mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson promptly turned and consulted his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve two half-crowns in the purse, Donald,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said, &ldquo;if  that will be sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, any amount,&rdquo; Bill said, answering for the parson&mdash;&ldquo;any amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the parson handed him the money Bill&rsquo;s heart was touched with  gratitude. He bowed his head low, and said: &ldquo;Thank yer, sir, thank yer, and God  bless yer, as I know He will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Bill put his hat on, and departed.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday afternoon</i>. The little dining room at &ldquo;The Manse&rdquo; had  been put in order, and for several hours the parson had been patiently waiting  and watching for the wedding party to come along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He surely couldn&rsquo;t have misunderstood me, and mistaken the day,&rdquo; the  parson said wonderingly to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could scarcely be, for I heard him myself say Wednesday plainly,  Donald,&rdquo; his wife answered. &ldquo;But has it not occurred to your mind at all that  he mightn&rsquo;t have been sincere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not be fair to impute ill motive to him, Jean,&rdquo; the parson  replied, shaking his head. &ldquo;So many unforeseen circumstances might have  interfered with his plans since he left; and maybe someone may fetch a message  in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight o&rsquo;clock struck, and neither party nor message had arrived&mdash;and  weren&rsquo;t likely to. Bill Eaglefoot, at that hour, was contentedly husking corn  in McClure&rsquo;s barn at Narralane, and entertaining the young McClures with  glowing accounts of his inglorious experience among the shearing sheds out  west, and of his dealings with horse thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very strange&mdash;very strange,&rdquo; the parson murmured when ten o&rsquo;clock  struck, and it was time to go to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter  6<br>
  McClure Deals with Eaglefoot</b></h2>
<p>Church Sunday. On his way to conduct service at Narralane, the poor  parson, as was his custom, called in at &ldquo;Loch Ness,&rdquo; McClure&rsquo;s place, to  procure a fresh horse, and leave his own old stager in the paddock till he  returned again. McClure, in his Sunday suit, and Bill Eaglefoot, in his Monday  one, emerged from the barn together as the poor parson drove into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; Bill said, when his eyes met the parson&rsquo;s, and suddenly  retreated to the recesses of the barn, and poked himself out of sight behind  some bales of chaff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Duncan shouted, on missing Bill, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s that lazy beggar gane  to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the children standing by located Bill, and informed the parent.</p>
<p>Duncan put his head in at the barn door, and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deil are ye daein&rsquo; in there? Are yer sins weighin&rsquo; sae heavy  wi&rsquo; ye that yer afraid o&rsquo; the minister? Tak&rsquo; th&rsquo; horse oot of th&rsquo; sulky for  him, and put auld Nancy in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill groaned assent and Duncan, in company with the parson, strode steadily  off to the house, where, Duncan said, &ldquo;a cup o&rsquo; tea and a bit o&rsquo; a snack were  waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before going inside the parson paused, and in low confidential tones  questioned Duncan about Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s just a useless sort o&rsquo; an auld beggar,&rdquo; Duncan answered.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; huskin&rsquo; for me for his grub and a few shullins a week; and  when he&rsquo;s finished maybe he&rsquo;ll gang awa&rsquo; and booze it a&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the parson told Duncan all about Bill&rsquo;s visit to &ldquo;The Manse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the laws!&rdquo; Duncan cried, losing his temper, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye tell me he lee&rsquo;d  sae awfu&rsquo; to you&mdash;a meenster o&rsquo; the Gospel, and robbed you o&rsquo; twa half-croons?  Hang his ragged soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, McClure, hush!&rdquo; the poor parson said,  holding up a up a finger to check Duncan; &ldquo;you must not fly into wrath about  it, man; it&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I canna&rsquo; help mesel&rsquo;, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan fumed, his big broad chest  heaving with righteous indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I canna help mesel&rsquo; callin him a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; And the poor parson held up both hands to silence Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he deceived you, and telt y&rsquo; he was gaun tae mairry sic a thing as  Lizzie Lake, yon auld black gin i&rsquo; the yaird there</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, man! You mustn&rsquo;t be so angry.&rdquo; And again the parson arrested  Duncan&rsquo;s language in the nick of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go you inside then,&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;and hae y&rsquo;r tea, pairrson, and, be  the powers, I&rsquo;ll gang an&rsquo; bring the auld dog down here be his lang lug, sae I  will, and gie him sic a talkin to as &rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; him wish he were hanged to the  limb o&rsquo; a tree before he thocht o&rsquo; committin&rsquo; perjury and thievin&rsquo; frae a meenister  o&rsquo; the gospel.</p>
<p>And Duncan, as good as his word, went off, and returned, leading the  trembling, guilty-looking Bill by the ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stan&rsquo; y&rsquo; there!&rdquo; he foamed, shoving the terror-stricken reprobate into  a corner of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stan&rsquo; ye there, y&rsquo; auld sinner, and confront you th&rsquo; meenister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the matter, Duncan?&rdquo; his wife anxiously asked, coming from  her room, and looking from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This son o&rsquo; auld Nick went a&rsquo; th&rsquo; way to Springfield, and telt th&rsquo;  meenister he was goin&rsquo; to be mairrit to auld black Luzzie, and extrackit twa  half-croons frae him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>did</i>, I <i>did</i>, Mrs. McClure, my God I did,&rdquo; Bill  broke out, pathetically. &ldquo;And I ask his reverence&rsquo;s forgiveness for it, I do, I  do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, y&rsquo;ll no get any forgiveness.&rdquo; And, turning to his eldest son,  who appeared on the scene with a half-wondering smile, Duncan fairly shouted,  &ldquo;Go you, Peter, and fetch that black skin o&rsquo; a Luzzy here, and, b&rsquo; the powers,  I&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; him keep his word wi&rsquo; her and tak&rsquo; her fer his wife this vera  meenit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sae foolish, Duncan,&rdquo; his wife cried. &ldquo;Hae some sense, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nae foolish, Vi,&rdquo; Duncan shouted indignantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s convickit  himself o&rsquo; crime.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not do these things, McClure,&rdquo; the parson said, sternly. &ldquo;You  must not bear malice. He has confessed to his wickedness, and asked  forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get nae forgiveness, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan yelled, flying further  off the handle. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get nae redemption frae me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter, with the old black gin in tow, entered the room. Lizzie grinned  and grunted at everyone present, and rolled her white eyes about like a pair of  billiard balls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stan&rsquo; ye there, and be mairried to this son o&rsquo; the deil,&rdquo; said Duncan,  pushing the hideous, but pleased-looking aboriginal</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not <i>her</i>,&rdquo; Bill  pleaded, &ldquo;not her, my God, not her,&rdquo; and he slipped down in a limp, helpless  heap on the floor.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page027.jpg" alt="not her" width="518" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye goin&rsquo; mad, Duncan, or whatever is&rsquo;t come over ye, man?&rdquo; Mrs.  McClure cried, seizing her husband by the arm,</p>
<p>Then the parson, with determined countenance, confronted Duncan, and,  raising both hands, said, impressively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an elder of the kirk, you must not insist on such an infamous and  unchristian transaction. Tis greater sin than all he has committed himself; and  I cannot tolerate it more. Calm yourself, McClure; be sensible, and send these  people about their business&mdash;if they have any.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Duncan became sensible, and, after a while, calmed down, and allowed  Bill and Lizzie to depart in peace.</p>
<p>Five minutes later. Duncan, from behind a broad, good-natured smile,  looked across the room at his wife, as the poor parson finished his tea, and said: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Be the powers, Vi, didna auld Bill get a deil o&rsquo; a fricht; did y&rsquo; see  hoo his bloomin&rsquo; auld knees rattled themsels together when Peter  fetched Luzzie in?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter  7<br>
  Eaglefoot&rsquo;s Religion</b></h2>
<p>When the parson had finished his &ldquo;cup o&rsquo; tea and a bit o&rsquo; a snack,&rdquo; as  Duncan McClure called it, and was ready to drive to the church, Duncan, slowly  buttoning his roomy tweed coat over his great chest, stood at the back door of  the house, and roared at the top of his voice to the unhappy Bill:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look shairp there, you lazy auld deil,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and bring the da&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;DUNCAN!&rdquo; Mrs. McClure cried, warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the MEENISTER&rsquo;S trap,&rdquo; Duncan said correcting himself, &ldquo;roon to  the front o&rsquo; the hoose, and fetch the buggy roon&rsquo; for mysel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Duncan, with a broad smile on his face, turned to the minister,  and said apologetically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can never think o&rsquo; onythin&rsquo; but &lsquo;pairrson&rsquo; when I want to speak  about you, Mr. McCulloch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson smiled his forgiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a curious thing,&rdquo; Duncan went on, as though he had just made the  discovery, &ldquo;my auld faither was just the same as me; he&rsquo;d always say  &lsquo;pairrson,&rsquo; and I suppose it wud be frae hearin&rsquo; him say&rsquo;t when I was a  youngster that I got into the habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure doubted whether the habit was as strong in the &ldquo;auld man&rdquo;  as in Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my word, Vi,&rdquo; Duncan answered, his blue eyes lighting up with  enthusiasm, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could be nearly so bad as the auld governor. He  was an awfu&rsquo; beggar, you ken. D&rsquo;ye mind the day when Pairrson McLeod was  preachin&rsquo; at our plaice, and the governor, he couldna&rsquo; hear him&mdash;he was deaf as  the deil, ye ken&mdash;and he got up in a terrible tear in the middle o&rsquo; the sermon,  and says to auld Tom Roberts&mdash;&lsquo;Dang him, Tom, he canna&rsquo; preach at a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;DUNCAN,&rdquo; Mrs. McClure called in horror, &ldquo;ye forget yoursel&rsquo;, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then Bill Eaglefoot appeared at the front door with the  minister&rsquo;s trap, and attracted Duncan&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hae y&rsquo; got it, Bill?&rdquo; Duncan called out, and wobbled off to inspect  the turnout, and to see if Bill had harnessed the animal safely.</p>
<p>Bill had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said; &ldquo;ye can get in noo and be aff,  and we&rsquo;ll be alang at y&rsquo;r heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Duncan strode round to where the big double-seated buggy that was  to convey himself and family to the church was standing.</p>
<p>Before getting into the trap the parson paused, and spoke a few kindly  words of advice to Bill, and referred feelingly to the incident of his perfidy,  and, in a friendly, unoffending way, inquired what his religion was, and if he  ever went to church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same as yours, I think, sir; that is, when I used to go reg&rsquo;ly,&rdquo; Bill  answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re a Presbyterian, then?&rdquo; the parson replied, with a look of  delight in his eye.</p>
<p>Bill hesitated. Bill was not a confident liar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you call it, I suppose,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s  so long since I&rsquo;ve been there, now, sir&mdash;always knockin&rsquo; round the bush, you  know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never had a chance to keep it up.&rdquo; And Bill in a restless way moved  round the trap to escape further interrogation.</p>
<p>But the parson&rsquo;s interest in Bill was only intensified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part of Scotland do you come from?&rdquo; he asked, looking over the  mare&rsquo;s back at Bill.</p>
<p>Bill looked puzzled. Bill didn&rsquo;t know a great deal about geography, and  suddenly became interested in a portion of the harness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it from Glasgow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs, that&rsquo;s the place,&rdquo; Bill said, with assumed indifference, and  stepped back a pace or two, and eyed the wheels of the trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the name of the church you went to there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill said, &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson repeated the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was only a youngster then, you know,&rdquo; Bill answered, shaking the  wheel of the trap with all his strength to see if there was any danger of it  coming off.</p>
<p>For a moment or two the parson studied Bill in silence, then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s room in the trap with me if you have a mind to come to the  service this afternoon.&rdquo; And he looked closely and kindly at the bush  reprobate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t go there in these sort o&rsquo; clothes, sir,&rdquo; Bill replied,  looking down at the legs of his greasy, ragged moles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference what kind of clothes you come to the house of  the Lord in,&rdquo; the parson assured him, encouragingly.</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t go in any case, sir, to-day,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;&rsquo;cause  now, when I come to think o&rsquo; it, the boss wants me to look after the cows, and  have them in, ready for milking when he gets back. But some other Sunday, sir,  when I get a few decent things (looking down at his unsightly pants again),  I&rsquo;ll go; upon my word I will, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McClure, with Mrs. McClure beside him in the buggy, and all the young  McClures packed behind, came cautiously round the corner of the house, and drew  up at the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoot! Have ye no&rsquo; got a start yet, pairrson?&rdquo; he said, when he saw the  minister in conversation with Bill.</p>
<p>The minister approached the wheel of McClure&rsquo;s buggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your man,&rdquo; meaning Bill, &ldquo;tells me he belongs to our kirk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out o&rsquo; that! Out o&rsquo; that! Heigh! Hoo!&rdquo; Bill suddenly broke out, and rushed  away in pretence of preventing a cow that was standing some fifty yards or more  from the lucerne paddock from breaking into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s daein&rsquo; nae hairm,&rdquo; McClure shouted at Bill; &ldquo;let her alane.&rdquo; But  Bill didn&rsquo;t hear his master&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Then, turning to the minister, McClure said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, pairrson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson repeated what Bill had told him about his religion, and  asked Duncan if he couldn&rsquo;t arrange the milking so as &ldquo;the man could attend  service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan opened his eyes and mouth, and stared in dismay at his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear that, Vi?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Was ther&rsquo; ever sic a leear?&rdquo; Then,  looking at the minister. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s been tellin&rsquo; us a&rsquo; every nicht sin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s  bin here, pairrson, that he was born at the goldfields, and was Church o&rsquo;  England. Roast his hide! A Scotchman!&rdquo; (Duncan turned his eyes in the direction  of the skulking Bill, and lifted his voice that he might hear.) &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae  loafin, lyin&rsquo; deils like him in Scotland, and if he were a Presbyterian,  pairrson, it would be a guid thing for the kirk to gi&rsquo;ve him a bait. Git up in  your trap, man, and pay nae heed tae him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure and the children smiled at Duncan, and the parson climbed  into his sulky, and drove on.</p>
<p>They arrived at the church half an hour before the time for commencing  service, and the minister went inside, while Duncan, in his customary way,  moved among the little crowd collected in the shade of the building, and  jocosely asked them about their sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a grreat row at my place the-day,&rdquo; he said, planting his  hands in the pockets of his broad Sunday trousers, and standing up square  before the amused-looking audience with his head well back and his broad chest  expanded to the full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye ken auld Bill Eaglefoot?&rdquo; (They all did, and grinned and chuckled  at the thoughts of him.) &ldquo;Well, the auld deil went up to Springfield the ither  day, and tellt the pairrson he was gaun tae get mairrit to black Luzzie at ma  place, and borrowed five bob frae him on the strength o&rsquo;t, and went and had the  deil&rsquo;s ain spree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silent, solemn-looking crowd burst into loud hilarity and some of  them yelled, &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; And Duncan, before proceeding further, peeped up  cautiously at the window in the side of the church, to see if the parson was  looking out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; the-day,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;when the auld boy&rdquo; (glancing up at the  window again) &ldquo;cam&rsquo; to my place, and saw Bill at the barn, he kent him at once,  and tellt me a&rsquo; aboot it. &lsquo;By the wars!&rsquo; I says, getting real angry, y&rsquo; ken,  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; him pay for his perfidy, pairrson,&rsquo; and up I walked to the barn  whaur Bill was hiding hisel&rsquo;, and I took him by his lang lug, and led him doon  to the hoose, whaur the pairrson was haein&rsquo; a snack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another roar of merriment, and some of the women who had been  waiting at the front door of the church came, with smiles on their faces, to  share the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Gang an&rsquo; fetch that black imp, Luzzie, in here,&rsquo; I yells at Peter,&rdquo;  Duncan went on, gazing seriously on his amused-looking listeners; &ldquo;and Peter  brings Luzzie in. &lsquo;Stan&rsquo; there, ye black sweep,&rsquo; I says to her, &lsquo;and get  mairrit to this son o&rsquo; th&rsquo; deil,&rsquo; and, by the holy, didna auld Bill tremble,  and he went doon on his knees and begged o&rsquo; me not to. And the pairrson, he got  in a deuce o&rsquo; a tear, and my wife she yells at me to ken if I&rsquo;d gone rratty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take you his haun,&rsquo; I shouts to Luzzie,&rdquo; he continued, forgetting to  look up at the window, at which the parson&rsquo;s face now appeared, with a look of  amazement on it; &ldquo;and she grabbed his fist, and smiled at him just the way a  rale bride would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More loud laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I canna&rsquo; do sic a thing, McClure,&rsquo; the parson said; &lsquo;I canna.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have been there,&rdquo; Sam Thomson cried, throwing himself on  the grass.</p>
<p>Here Duncan was interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister McClure,&rdquo; came sternly and solemnly from the window a few  feet above the heads of the amused crowd.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page033.jpg" alt="sternly" width="504" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>They all lifted their eyes and looked up quickly, then dropped them  again and turned their backs and grinned at McClure in suppressed merriment.</p>
<p>Duncan, without moving a muscle of his face, looked up calmly at the  minister, then taking out his large, old-fashioned watch, and consulting it,  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By th&rsquo; Hokey, it&rsquo;s time to get in, chaps,&rdquo; and, wobbling off,  reverently led the way into the service.</p>

  Bailey&rsquo;s Generosity</b></h2>
<p>The parson, in the course of his sermon, said he was very sorry to have  to refer again to one or two matters which gave him pain, and reminded his  congregation that the church dues and pew rents, and other items, had again fallen  into arrears, and the debt on the church, instead of diminishing, was rapidly  increasing.</p>
<p>And when the service was over a good many of the congregation, with  long faces, consulted together at the fence. They said they had given more than  anyone else to the church, and reckoned no minister had a right to talk from  the pulpit the way he had done.</p>
<p>Bailey, the storekeeper, said he was getting disgusted with the whole  business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come to church,&rdquo; he added, waving his hands about, &ldquo;to hear a  sermon, not to hear a man talking about debts and making personal remarks about  things his congregation should do. There&rsquo;s no man has done more than I have,  but unless there&rsquo;s a new minister appointed pretty soon, take it from me, I&rsquo;m  done with it altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the discontented ones mounted their horses, and climbed into their  traps, and went off without saying good-bye to the poor parson.</p>
<p>A glorious afternoon at Springfield. The distant wheatfields lay all  round like gigantic carpets of living green; roses bloomed in the crudely  palinged-in gardens, and filled the air with their fragrance, and the thick  vine that covered the Manse was a gorgeous blaze of yellow bloom. In a small  horse paddock adjacent to the Manse the parson&rsquo;s children, armed with green  bushes, were romping noisily in pursuit of the butterflies which came  fluttering along in twos and threes, in dozens and in droves. Inside the Manse,  the poor parson, with one elbow on the table and his chin resting in the palm  of his hand, sat in gloomy contemplation. His wife sat opposite him staring  vacantly at a bundle of letters and bills that lay open before them. For a good  while neither of them spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, John, what we are going to do,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch  said gloomily. &ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s bill can&rsquo;t be met out of our small stipend; even  if it were paid regularly, it barely suffices to keep us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It breaks my very heart to owe money, Jean; and it&rsquo;s a great sin, in  the eyes of the Lord, for a minister to be in debt at all,&rdquo; the poor parson  moaned. &ldquo;But the congregation will not do their duty.&rdquo; And he rested his head  on the table, and for the moment gave way to despondency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grieve about it, John,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said, wiping the tears  from her eyes, and swallowing a lump that rose to her throat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grieve,  dear. We&rsquo;ll get over it somehow; the piano is a good one&mdash;it&rsquo;s surely worth  forty pounds, and, though I&rsquo;ll be sorry to part with it, it can go to the sale  tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brave woman, Jean,&rdquo; the parson said, lifting his head and  raising his eyes to his wife&rsquo;s, &ldquo;and I know I should not give way, for it&rsquo;s  losing faith in the Almighty&mdash;indeed, I should not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must bear it all with a good heart, John,&rdquo; his wife concluded,  rising from the table; and, taking her seat at the piano, which she hadn&rsquo;t  opened for several months, ran her fingers skilfully over the keyboard.</p>
<p>The minister rose, and went and stood by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play &lsquo;Thy Will be Done&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, and Mrs. McCulloch started to play,  and had just finished the hymn when a footstep on the verandah attracted their  attention. It was Mrs. Bailey, wife of the storekeeper, come to pay them a  visit. Mrs. McCulloch rose, and received the visitor kindly, and the poor  parson inquired after Mr. Bailey and the rest of the family, and hoped they  were all well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just playing for my husband,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said, noticing Mrs.  Bailey&rsquo;s eyes roaming inquisitively over the open piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heeard you when I was coming in,&rdquo; Mrs. Bailey said, &ldquo;and it  sounded lovely.&rdquo; All music sounded &ldquo;lovely&rdquo; to Mrs. Bailey. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The piano has a beautiful tone,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said, casting an  affectionate look at the instrument, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry to say that matters are  faring so hard with us now that we must send it to the sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you really?&rdquo; Mrs. Bailey said, in tones of feigned surprise, &ldquo;and  how much will you be asking for it, Mrs. McCulloch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it cost sixty guineas at home,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch answered, &ldquo;and it  has hardly ever had any use. If we get half the sum for it, I suppose we will  be fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bailey, who was always on the look out for bargains, said they  were thinking of buying a piano for their daughter, and looked with covetous  eyes on the instrument, and promised to speak to Mr. Bailey about it when she  went home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good piano,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said sorrowfully, &ldquo;and thirty  pounds would be very little indeed for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning. Bailey turned up at the Manse before breakfast was off  the table, and asked Mrs. McCulloch to let him see the piano.</p>
<p>Bailey scarcely knew a piano from a case of pint pots, but he examined  it closely, and sounded it, and stubbornly condemned it in several places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; he said, when Mrs. McCulloch praised the  instrument, &ldquo;but these things if they&rsquo;re not properly fitted sometimes fall to  pieces, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he offered her twenty pounds for it.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bailey said, moving to the door, &ldquo;you can take or leave it....  There&rsquo;s no one else here will give you that much for it, I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch looked interrogatively at the poor parson; but the  parson remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;take it,&rdquo; and large tears came into her  eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re sensible,&rdquo; Bailey said; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll send you the money  and the dray for it on Saturday.&rdquo; And, with a triumphant smile on his face, he  turned and hurried away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Next day. The poor parson was at  Loch Ness having tea with Duncan and Mrs. McClure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mustna be,&rdquo; Duncan said, referring to the sale of the piano. &ldquo;It  mustna be sacrificed in that way. I&rsquo;ll gie ye forty pounds for it mysel&rsquo;,  pairrson, and bring ye the money on Saturday morn.&rdquo; And with a pleased look on  his face, and with his heart full of hope, the poor parson went home to his  wife at Springfield.</p>
<p>Saturday morning, Bailey arrived at the Manse with several of his men  and a dray, and said he had come for the piano.</p>
<p>The poor parson, with Mrs. McCulloch standing anxiously by his side,  informed Bailey of Duncan McClure&rsquo;s offer, and asked him if he would agree, for  their sake, to cancel the purchase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cancel it!&rdquo; Bailey said in surprise. &ldquo;Do you call that honourable? And  you profess to be a Christian! Why, that&rsquo;s a mean, shabby sort of thing to  do&mdash;to try and sell a thing behind my back that I bought from you, and you a  minister! Here&rsquo;s the money&rdquo; (throwing a cheque on the table); &ldquo;I want the  piano.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page038.jpg" alt="piano" width="521" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;If you take that view of it, of course we can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; the poor  parson moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; Bailey answered, and, calling his men in, lifted  the piano out, and hurriedly placed it in his dray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bailey&rsquo;s nae guid, an&rsquo; may auld Nick himsel&rsquo; mak him his elder and gie  him a roastin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duncan McClure said warmly when he heard that the piano was  gone.</p>

  A Casual Visit</b></h2>
<p>Boxing day; and talk about heat! It was heat! The ground was steaming  with it; all around the air quivered and glistened; herbage and trees, and  cornfield after cornfield, drooped, languished and seemed dead. The inhabitants  of Sandy Crossing, as the poor parson passed slowly by on his way home from a  sick bed at the Fork Tree, lounged lifelessly on their verandahs &mdash;the men with  their hats and boots off, their shirts open wide at the chest&mdash;and stared out at  him, and wondered if &ldquo;white puggeries hanging down the back were really any  good for the sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At McCanty&rsquo;s selection, where usually there was never a sign of  activity, or even civilisation, and where nought but a sorry, tumble-down old  homestead supported by an empty pigsty, a deserted cowyard, a weather-beaten  haystack not much higher than an ant bed, a few acres of cultivation containing  numerous dead trees and stumps, were to be seen&mdash;peals of laughter and  excitement suddenly prevailed. A crowd of people was there, and men, women, and  children, regardless of the excessive heat of the day, romped round, pursuing  each other from the house to the haystack, and from the haystack back to the  house. The parson stared as he approached; then, seeing Duncan McClure striding  leisurely about amongst them with his hands in his pockets, smiled amusedly,  and called out &ldquo;Good-day&rdquo; to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be th&rsquo; war!&rdquo; Duncan exclaimed, turning to old McCanty, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s oor  pairrson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old McCanty looked surprised. So did those who were romping about. One  by one they stood and stared, and their spirits seemed to go down, as though  the presence of a clergyman were a wet blanket to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in and join us, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said, without consulting his  host&rsquo;s feelings on the matter, &ldquo;an&rsquo; hae a bit o&rsquo; a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;come along in,&rdquo; McCanty added, with a shake of his bald head.  &ldquo;Hang your horse up to that stick, and have a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson said he couldn&rsquo;t remain very long, as he had yet to visit  Mrs. Daley, who was seriously ill. Then he dismounted, and when he had hitched  his horse to the &ldquo;bit of a stick,&rdquo; McCanty explained the cause of all the joy  and commotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me two sons, Jim and Tom,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have just returned from the  shearin&rsquo;, after being two year away, and they&rsquo;re holdin&rsquo; a bit of a party in  honour of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson smiled in approval, and, along with McClure, followed  McCanty inside, where Mrs. McClure and a number of other matrons were being  entertained by Mrs. McCanty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as the old woman here can tell you,&rdquo; McCanty went on, introducing  the parson to his wife, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t often have enough money when they come home  to give parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the boys are all right,&rdquo; Mrs. McCanty snapped, in defence of her  progeny. &ldquo;If they didn&rsquo;t spend their money themselves, I know someone who would  if he got his hands on it.&rdquo; And she smiled meaningly at everyone in the room.</p>
<p>The parson looked down at his feet, and seemed uncomfortable. But  McClure, who understood the McCantys, said good-humouredly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t mean to say that Tom would booze it a&rsquo; if he got haud o&rsquo;t,  Mrs. McCanty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCanty chuckled satirically, and, turning her head to the open  door, called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim and Tom! . . . Come in till I introduce you to the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim and Tom were standing at the back door, where they were being  lionised by Mary McEvoy, and Katie McCarthy, and Nell Nathan, and a host of  other girls, who tittered and giggled at the prospects of Jim and Tom being  introduced to a real, live clergyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a bloke is he?&rdquo; Jim inquired, in a low tone. &ldquo;Does he  belong to the union?&rdquo; And the girls tittered louder.</p>
<p>Then Jim peered cautiously round the door, and, catching a glimpse of  the parson&rsquo;s dark trousers, declared him to be a &ldquo;black leg,&rdquo; at which the  girls shrieked senselessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim and Tom!&rdquo; Mrs. McCanty called again, this time in a firm voice.</p>
<p>And Jim said, looking at the girls:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose we better keep sweet with him&mdash;case we might want him one of  these days,&rdquo; and, shoving Tom into the lead, stumbled in, both with flash,  lout-like grins on their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Jim, and this is Tom,&rdquo; Mrs. McCanty said, pointing them out in  order of age to the parson. The parson rose and shook hands with them, and  asked them if they were quite well.</p>
<p>Jim ducked his head, and said he was &ldquo;pretty middlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Tom  confessed to &ldquo;having had &lsquo;Barcoo rot&rsquo; a year ago, and being cronk for munce  after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the parson engaged them in conversation about the shearing trouble  out West, and, while they gave him their views on the strike, McCanty and  Duncan worked up a private conversation together in the farthest corner of the  room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he take any?&rdquo; McCanty, with one eye on the parson, whispered into  Duncan&rsquo;s woolly ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never touches at a&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duncan whispered back; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s stric&rsquo; teetotal,  and doesna encourage even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCanty looked troubled, and began to think hard.</p>
<p>After a long silence, he pinched McClure on the elbow, then rose and  said to the company:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind us for a moment, I want to show Duncan a new  wire-strainer I have,&rdquo; and he marched out the front door. Duncan, after looking  round, and with a lot of doubt in his mind, followed his host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over here at the stack,&rdquo; McCanty said, reaching his hand out  slyly, and removing a pint-pot from the water-cask and slipping it under his  coat as he passed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s naethin&rsquo; much to see a bloomin&rsquo; wire-strainer, Tom,&rdquo; Duncan said,  innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t, then; it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; McCanty answered, when they were hidden  from view, &ldquo;but <i>this</i> is worth seein,  though, McClure!&rdquo; And, with a cheerful chuckle, he produced a whisky bottle and  the pint-pot from beneath the folds of his Sunday coat.</p>
<p>Duncan stared, and said in protest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly ever tak&rsquo; grog, man. My wife&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Here, man, here!&rdquo; And McCanty,  peering cautiously over the top of the stack to see that no eyes were upon  them, shoved the bottle and the pint-pot into Duncan&rsquo;s big hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, beggar it,&rdquo; Duncan drawled, reluctantly helping himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d  sooner ye had gien it t&rsquo; me in th&rsquo; hoose, man; it maks me feel jist like a  convicted thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down wi&rsquo; it, man,&rdquo; McCanty said, eagerly taking the bottle from  Duncan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, then, guid luck t&rsquo; ye, McCanty,&rdquo; Duncan said, raising the  pint-pot to his lips, &ldquo;an&rsquo; may that auld bald heid of yours hae loads o&rsquo; hair  on it afore ye kick th&rsquo; bucket.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page043.jpg" alt="bald" width="504" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; McCanty answered. And as Duncan held the pint-pot to his  head, his four-year-old son, pursued by several other juveniles, rushed round  the haystack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out o&rsquo; this,&rdquo; McCanty said to them savagely, and when they vanished he  poured himself out a &ldquo;nip,&rdquo; and drank to Duncan&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; Duncan responded; then added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That laddie o&rsquo; mine has the deil&rsquo;s ain tongue, McCanty,&rdquo; with a look  of apprehension, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll maybe go in and tell them a&rsquo; aboot us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Duncan was a good prophet. The boy bounded in, and before the whole  company shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maw, maw! Faither is behint th&rsquo; haystack wi&rsquo; his heid back drinkin&rsquo;  oot o&rsquo; a bottle. I seed him, maw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure turned crimson; the parson pretended he didn&rsquo;t hear the  boy, and the others, after restraining their feelings a while, burst out  laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was Mr. McCanty, maw,&rdquo; the boy added, for general information, and  made more merriment.</p>
<p>The mirth had hardly subsided when McCanty and Duncan sauntered in,  both with innocent expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a bad strainer, did you think?&rdquo; McCanty said, naively, as  they took their seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; Mrs. McCanty  replied; &ldquo;not for straining whisky out of a bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been straining whisky out of a bottle?&rdquo; McCanty asked with  warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>,&rdquo; his wife foamed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar, then, Ellen,&rdquo; McCanty yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You canna say that, man,&rdquo; Duncan roared, jumping to his feet; &ldquo;you  canna say that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can say what I like in my own house, and won&rsquo;t consult <i>you</i>,&rdquo; McCanty yelled at Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You canna,&rdquo; Duncan persisted hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>can!</i>&rdquo; said McCanty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you brute,&rdquo; said Mrs. McCanty, losing her temper, as she flew  right at her husband&rsquo;s throat. McCanty knocked her down. Duncan McClure knocked  McCanty down. The women screamed and brought confusion. The poor parson lifted  both his hands, and, raising his voice, implored peace.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page045.jpg" alt="flew" width="547" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>McCanty recovered himself, and seizing a chair, was murderously  brandishing it over the head of McClure, when one of the girls, who had taken a  message from a man who came galloping along the road, rushed in, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McCulloch, Mrs. Daley is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; the poor parson exclaimed, lowering his hands; &ldquo;God have  mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deid! She canna!&rdquo; McClure said, lowering his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Daley dead!&rdquo; McCanty muttered, looking nervously round, and  putting down the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Died an hour ago,&rdquo; the girl added slowly.</p>
<p>Then the poor parson raised his head again, and in tender tones said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us unite in prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, while the messenger turned and galloped away, they bowed their  heads and prayed.</p>

  A Jealous Husband</b></h2>
<p>It was just seven months since the whole country side round Narralane  had almost danced their legs off at Archie MacLennan&rsquo;s wedding. And such a  wedding! Such dancing! Such dust! And how they feasted on the stuffed fowl, and  congratulated Archie on securing Hannah Hornby for his wife, and Hannah on  securing Archie for her husband.</p>
<p>The rejoicing lasted two days; then Archie put Hannah on a horse and  took her &ldquo;home&rdquo;&mdash;took her to the Fifteen Mile Hut, a lonely, lifeless-looking,  slab dwelling leaning beside the farthest boundary fence of Yaramba Station  run, and there set her down. And what a miserable, melancholy-looking home it  was to set anyone down in. A sheep-yard made of gigantic logs rolled one upon  the other; a small sapling horse-yard into which no horse with any sense would  ever walk without being led or shoved, and a few sheepskins hanging on the  fence, were the only signs of civilisation that surrounded it. The rest was all  gum-trees&mdash;gum-trees&mdash;scaly, scraggy, useless-looking, Australian gum-trees.</p>
<p>Archie MacLennan was a paddock-mender, and, for repairing the fences of  a station paddock that took nearly the whole day to ride round, and keeping an  eye on the stock it contained, he received fifteen shillings a week, and a single  ration, and occasionally a kind word from the boss. And Archie felt proud of  the position and its emoluments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t everyone who has a steady job,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s  nothing like it these times.&rdquo; And Hannah would agree with Archie, and talk  hopefully of the future, and proceed to figure out what their wealth would  amount to in twenty years if they could only manage to save a certain sum every  year. Hannah was a woman full of great possibilities, and Archie began to look  on her as a small savings bank erected on his own premises. And Archie would  take Hannah in his arms, and hug her, and ask her if she would always be as  fond of him?</p>
<p>And Hannah would embrace Archie, and tell him that all her love and  thoughts were for him, and would be his until death.</p>
<p>When the honeymoon was all over, Archie settled down, and went to work  methodically. Every morning he would saddle his horse at the door of the hut,  then stuff some lunch that Hannah had cut for him into the saddle pouch, and,  telling her &ldquo;not to be lonely or afraid,&rdquo; would whistle the dog, and ride off  through the forest of miserable gum-trees.</p>
<p>And when Archie had disappeared through the timber, big tears would  come into Hannah&rsquo;s eyes, and straightway she would begin to feel lonely and  nervous. What little housework she had to do wouldn&rsquo;t occupy her more than a  couple of hours, and when it was got through, she would fret and mope about,  moving aimlessly from one room to the other (there were only two rooms in the  hut altogether). At intervals she would sit and think of home and mother and  her little brother, and, burying her face in her apron, would sob and sob. Then  by way of change she would pull herself together, and talk to herself  encouragingly, and say, &ldquo;What a blessed old fool I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the day went on, Hannah&rsquo;s thoughts would run on travellers. Hannah  always distrusted travellers. And, if a poor, harmless old wretch, labouring  beneath the burden of a heavy swag, happened along, she would fly inside,  fasten the doors and windows of the old hut, and crouch under the bed, and hold  her breath until he had gone past.</p>
<p>One day old Jimmy Belcher, whom everybody but Hannah knew to be a  harmless old &ldquo;sundowner,&rdquo; hove in sight with a swag on his back and a billy-can  in his hand. Hannah hurried in from the verandah, secured the doors and  windows, and, settling herself in a heap under the bed, breathlessly waited for  the closing of the gate to tell her the man had passed through and was gone.  But old Jimmy was not one of those who would pass a door in a cold, unsociable  way. Jimmy had a lot of homely instincts about him. Besides, he was nearly  always tired and thirsty when he came to a house. He was tired and thirsty now.  He went to the tank, and, putting his mouth under the tap, drank long and  extravagantly. Then he put his swag down, and groaned and curled himself up  comfortably on the verandah like a big dog.</p>
<p>Hannah&rsquo;s heart beat violently.</p>
<p>Jimmy struck at the flies, and started talking to himself.</p>
<p>Hannah clutched at her heart, and strained her ears to catch what Jimmy  was saying.</p>
<p>For a long while Jimmy was silent, then suddenly he moved, and Hannah  heard him say, &ldquo;Blast y&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll kill y&rsquo;.&rdquo; Poor Hannah! She tried to scream, but  her voice failed her. Then she broke out into rolling lumps of perspiration,  and breathed faster than ever! But Jimmy didn&rsquo;t proceed to kill her. He didn&rsquo;t  even speak again. He went to sleep. Hannah remained cooped up under the bed,  perspiring and breathing hard, for three hours. She was seized with cramps,  too, in the neck, and in the back, and in all her limbs. At last the tramp of a  horse approaching the hut fell on her ears. Then a voice familiar to her asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mrs. McLennan inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of the poor parson. Hannah&rsquo;s heart jumped, and she  suddenly found her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McCulloch! Save me! Save me!&rdquo; she screamed, rolling out into the  middle of the floor.</p>
<p>The poor parson received the fright of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter in there, man?&rdquo; he demanded of the alarmed-looking  sundowner.</p>
<p>But Jimmy only sat up, and, with wide-open eyes, listened with alarm to  the unexpected cries coming from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it wer&rsquo; empty,&rdquo; he murmured, gathering himself together.</p>
<p>The parson sprang to the door, and rattled it, and called out for it to  be opened.</p>
<p>Jimmy picked up his swag, and made off hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me! Help me!&rdquo; came from Hannah.</p>
<p>The parson burst the door open, and found Hannah on her knees, with a  wild, hysterical glare in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Mrs. MacLennan?&rdquo; he asked excitedly, lifting her  to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h! Oh-h!&rdquo; Hannah moaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are here. I&rsquo;m glad! I&rsquo;m  glad!&mdash;There&rsquo;s a man&mdash;a man&mdash;been outside all day trying to get in to&mdash;to&mdash;kill me.  Oh-h!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! that man?&rdquo; And the parson rushed out to the verandah, with anger  in his mild eye. But Jimmy was nearly out of sight. Then the parson paused, and  thought hard, and remembering the man was asleep on the verandah when he  himself rode up, turned and questioned Hannah closely. But Hannah was all  a-tremble, and threw up her arms hysterically, and looked like falling to the  floor. The parson seized her in his arms, and held her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, Mrs. MacLennan,&rdquo; he pleaded, supporting her on his  shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h! he tried to kill me!&rdquo; And Hannah clutched the poor parson  tightly round the neck, and broke into a long chain of broken sobs.</p>
<p>Just then Archie returned whistling. He rode up to the hut, and,  dismounting, stepped lightly on to the verandah, and appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold me! Hold me!&rdquo; Hannah was moaning, and the poor parson, with a  troubled look in his face, was wondering what he would do with his burden, when  Archie, in a weak, broken voice, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of the voice the poor parson started, and looked quickly  over his shoulder; but, on seeing it was only Archie, a pleased look came into  his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Archie! Have you come?&rdquo; Hannah murmured, feebly, releasing her  hold of the parson&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; Archie answered in a changed voice, stepping inside  and staring at them with fire in his eye, &ldquo;and, by gums, I think I&rsquo;ll soon be  going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson stared hard at Archie, and changed colour; then looked  deeply offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. MacLennan,&rdquo; he said, proceeding in a wounded tone to explain the  fright Hannah had received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t seem to be very frightened o&rsquo; you a while ago, anyway,&rdquo;  Archie sneered, jealousy and rage surging in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Archie, darling,&rdquo; Hannah burst out, realising the position, &ldquo;what do  you mean? Oh-h! how could you? Listen to me, Archie, listen to me,&rdquo; and she  advanced to put her arms round her husband s neck.</p>
<p>Archie threw up his hands, angrily, and warned her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way you give all your love and thoughts to me,&rdquo; he  sneered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough, by the wars, I have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. MacLennan,&rdquo; the poor parson pleaded pathetically, &ldquo;before the  Lord, what I am going to tell you is gospel truth. Will you be reasonable, and,  like a man, hear me for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archie, after demurring for some time, heard him doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe me now?&rdquo; the parson, with a look of confidence, asked,  when he had given his account of the incident. Archie looked at Hannah, then at  the parson, and said, sullenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed if I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is, that you&rsquo;re neither a Christian husband nor a  good man, Mr. MacLennan,&rdquo; and the poor parson turned, and left the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him go like that,&rdquo; Hannah squealed; &ldquo;if you do I&rsquo;ll kill  myself,&rdquo; and she snatched the butcher&rsquo;s knife from the table, and brandished it  suicidally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my life, I will &rdquo;</p>
<p>Archie was in a tight place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, on your word, then, was he only holding you up, and not kissing  you, when I came in?&rdquo; And Archie&rsquo;s voice came thick and husky, and his eyes  filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt my word?&rdquo; and Hannah turned the point of the knife to her  agitated bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, then, Hannah,&rdquo; Archie broke out in a loud sob, &ldquo;give  me a kiss, and say no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah gladly gave him a kiss&mdash;gave him several kisses, and playfully  called him a &ldquo;silly old sausage.&rdquo; For a moment Archie held Hannah from him at  arm&rsquo;s length, and smiled into her face. Then he thought of the parson, and ran  out to call him back. But the parson had gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter  11<br>
  A Chapter of Accidents</b></h2>
<p>A bright, clear day in the middle of summer. And such a summer! With  the coming of spring rain had fallen at regular intervals, until the broad,  billowy plains of the Darling Downs were a sight that no inhabitant had ever dreamed  of living to see&mdash;till the grass, the corn, the wheat, and the full lagoons and  flowing creeks, were the pride and talk of the land.</p>
<p>The poor parson assisted his wife and children into the sulky, then,  seating himself beside them, started off to visit the distant members of his  scattered congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll drive straight to Narralane, Jean,&rdquo; he said, taking the  reins in his hand and giving them a shake to urge the old horse into the  collar, &ldquo;and put up at Duncan McClure&rsquo;s place to-night, for there&rsquo;s sure to be  a good welcome awaiting us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch assented cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to stay with the McClures, John,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;they&rsquo;re so different to other folk, and they always seem so glad to have us.  And I like Mr. McClure. He has such an honest, homely way with him, and he&rsquo;s so  cheerful and quaint with it all. And you may think ill of me, John, when I say  it, but I can never help smiling at him&mdash;even when you&rsquo;re offering prayers&mdash;for  he looks at you in such a droll way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t, Jean,&rdquo; the parson murmured in gentle reproval, &ldquo;you  shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But often I cannot help myself, John,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch went on, &ldquo;but  I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll not meet with so hearty a welcome at all the places we&rsquo;re  going to.&rdquo; And she mentioned the names of several members of the congregation  whose sincerity she doubted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not right we should judge them, Jean,&rdquo; the parson answered  meekly, &ldquo;for, after all, may it not be only their manner&mdash;just the way they have  been moulded, so to speak, Jean?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It might, John, but do you not think that the hand of the potter shook  just a little when they were being moulded?&rdquo; And Mrs. McCulloch smiled  playfully at her husband.</p>
<p>The parson stared steadily across the great green plain, but made no  reply.</p>
<p>The heat of the day had passed. The sun was slowly sinking, and as the  poor parson&rsquo;s rickety trap, wobbling and creaking beneath its load, approached  McClure&rsquo;s farm a scene of rare activity presented itself. The steam thresher,  new to the district, was hard at work; brawny, sunburnt men, with their sleeves  rolled up and veils to protect their eyes from the dust and flies falling round  their faces, were working as though the very fate of the world depended upon  the supremacy of sinew over steam. Some were heaving sheaves from the stacks;  some forking away the straw; some sewing the mouths of bags and lifting them  into position; others raking the chaff away, and all the while the engine and  machinery buzzed and hummed, and sent up a thick cloud of dust and smoke into  the air. In the thick of it all, sometimes lifting bags, sometimes raking chaff  away, more often using the packing needle, and with more chaff and dust in his  whiskers and hair and on his hat and flannel shirt than were on any three of  the others, was Duncan McClure himself. And, pottering actively round the tank  from which the engine drew its supply of water, doing nothing in a most  emphatic way, was Bill Eaglefoot.</p>
<p>The poor parson drew up within a short distance of the scene, and  allowed his wife and family to witness the engine at work.</p>
<p>Bill, who had more time than any of the others for looking about,  caught sight of the trap, and shouted his discovery to McClure. But Bill&rsquo;s  voice was completely lost in the midst of all the noise, and failed to carry.  He excitedly left his post, and, wading knee-deep through chaff and straw,  essayed to reach Duncan, who was working on his knees at the other end of the  plant. Before he could reach Duncan&rsquo;s side, however, Bill had to pass a running  fire of heavy sheaves that came flying from the top of the stack right off the  points of Tom Brady&rsquo;s and Willie Wiley&rsquo;s pitchforks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a moment,&rdquo; Bill shouted, lustily, hesitating and looking up at  Brady; &ldquo;I want to get by to speak to the Boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brady grinned, and, aiming a sheaf right at Bill, hit him in the eye  with the bearded end of it and knocked him off his feet. Bill spat out straw  and spluttered and used bad language and was trying to regain his feet when a  sheaf from Wiley planted itself with a thud in his stomach, and prostrated him  some more. Then Brady put on a spurt, and dropped sheaves on top of Bill, and  wedged them all round him until nothing of him was visible but the toes of his  tattered old boots, which protruded from the end of the sheaves. Brady and Wiley  eased off, and started laughing, then waved their forks about, and called out  to those below to rescue Bill. Some of the men looked up, and couldn&rsquo;t  understand. Brady placed his hands to his mouth and roared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull him out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Hannigan looked up, and, putting his horny hand behind his ear,  shouted back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hear y&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull that fool out from under the sheaves!&rdquo; Wiley yelled, pointing  with his pitchfork to locate Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re thrown a snake down, and it&rsquo;s under the sheaves,&rdquo; said Tom  Anderson, whose sense of hearing was keener than Hannigan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snake under the sheaves,&rdquo; Dan Fitzgerald repeated, and, brandishing  a rake, started cautiously to explore the heap. Anderson and Hannigan joined in  the search, and began removing the top of the sheaves tenderly. Bill&rsquo;s toes  wriggling in the chaff attracted old Hannigan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; he said, and jumped back. The others jumped back, too. Then  Hannigan swung his rake, and rained a succession of short, sharp blows on  Bill&rsquo;s toes. Brady, from the stack, aimed a heavy sheaf at old Hannigan, and  laid him low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there! Hang it!&rdquo; Tom shouted feelingly, looking up at Brady.  Brady aimed one at Tom Anderson, and it struck Dan Fitzgerald behind the knees  and cut him down on top of Hannigan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pair of blasted fools!&rdquo; Dan Fitzgerald yelled murderously,  and attracted everyone&rsquo;s attention. Commotion set in generally then, and the  driver stopped the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; deil&rsquo;s the matter wi&rsquo; ye a&rsquo;?&rdquo; Duncan cried.</p>
<p>No one seemed able to explain, and all eyes were turned inquiringly to  the men on the stack. Wiley, disgusted, felt and fumbled excitedly for the  ladder with his foot in order to descend. In his hurry he missed the top rung,  and reeled to the bottom like a shot hawk. He fell on a heap of loose straw,  and on Dan Fitzgerald&rsquo;s pitchfork, which lay upside down. The prongs of the  fork were forced into the back part of Wiley&rsquo;s thigh. Wiley bounced up, and,  yelling with fright and pain, danced about, trailing the long handle after him.  Dan Fitzgerald seized the handle with both hands and separated the fork from  Wiley and called him a fool. Wiley, with tears in his eyes, called Dan  Fitzgerald a variety of fools, and questioned his nationality and the  legitimacy of his birth. Then they fought it out in a most unscientific sort of  way amongst the chaff.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page057.jpg" alt="fought" width="542" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Here, hold that rotten ladder,&rdquo; Brady shouted out from the top of the  stack, exhibiting a determination to descend and vanquish below. No one seemed  to hear Brady. They were all gathered round Wiley and Dan Fitzgerald, making  vain efforts to separate them. Brady swore at the lot of them in turn, and  threatened to throw himself on top of them; then decided to slide down the side  of the stack. He felt his way cautiously, feet foremost, his face looking out  from the stack, and both hands tightly gripping the straw. Then he let go, and  went down the side with a run&mdash;went till the prongs of old Hogan&rsquo;s pitchfork,  which Hogan had carefully placed against the stack, so as it wouldn&rsquo;t stick in  any one, impeded his descent. The yell of surprise and anguish that suddenly  came from Brady put an end to the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heavens! he&rsquo;s on the fork!&rdquo; Hogan cried, and the others threw up  their hands in horror. Brady&rsquo;s head fell, and dropped on one shoulder; his eyes  rolled about like a pair of billiard balls, and his face turned the colour of  death. Hogan seized the handle of the pitchfork and pulled it from under Brady,  and Brady fell in a limp heap on the ground, and groaned. Then there was more  commotion. In the middle of it all, Wiley gained his presence of mind, and,  springing towards the heap of sheaves, seized hold of Bill&rsquo;s two feet, and  dragged the reprobate into the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s what all the trouble was about,&rdquo; he said,  contemptuously.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page059.jpg" alt="trouble" width="507" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Bill spat out chaff, and looked dazed. Duncan and the rest could hardly  believe their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the deil got you under there, confoond ye?&rdquo; Duncan said, staring  at Bill.</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s eyes rested on the form of Brady, who now sat up with his back  to the stack, and started rubbing the wounded part of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was &rsquo;im,&rdquo; Bill said, in injured tones, &ldquo;with his flashness. I was  goin&rsquo; to tell y&rsquo; th&rsquo; clergyman was waiting over there in his trap, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan looked round, and for the flrst time became aware of the poor  parson&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much sky&mdash;skylarkin&rsquo; altogether,&rdquo; Bill added, sulkily, and walked  back to the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be crikey!&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s th&rsquo; auld pairrson and Mrs. McCulloch.&rdquo;  Then, turning to the men, &ldquo;Get on wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; threshin&rsquo; chaps, an&rsquo; gie ower a&rsquo; this  humbuggin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the engine started to hum again; Wiley and Brady crawled slowly up  the ladder, which Hannigan held in position for them, and Duncan, covered with  dust and chaff, strode across and greeted the visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was all the trouble? Was there an accident, McClure?&rdquo; the parson  asked, with a look of grave concern on his pale, thoughtful face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h, no,&rdquo; Duncan answered, feigning indifference. &ldquo;Naething t&rsquo; speak  aboot, pairrson. Ane o&rsquo; th&rsquo; chaps was a bit careless, and let his pitchfork  stick into ane o&rsquo; the men workin&rsquo; on th&rsquo; stack, that was a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; the parson murmured, opening his grey eyes sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; did it stick into him very far, Mr. McClure?&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch  asked, with a deep shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Joves, then, it did that,&rdquo; Duncan replied, without thinking, &ldquo;a  deuce o&rsquo; a lang distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; from Mrs. McCulloch. &ldquo;An&rsquo; was it in a fatal place, Mr.  McClure?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;Duncan began to think, and to  look like an untruthful witness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, jist here in the calf o&rsquo; the leg,&rdquo; he said; and to demonstrate  the locality, pulled up the leg of his trousers, and displayed a lot of hairy,  dusty skin.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch smiled, and Duncan changed the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive alang to th&rsquo; hoose, pairrson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll send auld Bill  doon to tak the horse oot for ye, an&rsquo; he can gie him a rub doon an&rsquo; a bundle o&rsquo;  hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter  12<br>
  Lizzie Lake&rsquo;s Revenge</b></h2>
<p>The parson drove on, and, in a while, was followed by Bill, who limped  violently from the effects of the blows Hannigan had dealt him on the instep.</p>
<p>Bill was diffident about approaching the trap, and hung down his head,  and, as he came face to face with Mrs. McCulloch, looked like a convicted  thief. Bill had not had the pleasure of meeting her since the evening at the  Manse to make arrangements about his wedding.</p>
<p>The poor parson stepped out from the trap, and, having exchanged  greetings with Mrs. McClure and all the young McClures, who had gathered round  with bright, beaming faces to welcome their visitors, shook hands with Bill and  asked him how he was getting along.</p>
<p>Bill went down and complained bitterly of pains in his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the poor man who was injured with the pitchfork, John?&rdquo; Mrs.  McCulloch anxiously asked, looking with a sympathetic eye at Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not you, was it?&rdquo; the poor parson inquired, interrogating the  shuffling reprobate.</p>
<p>Bill studiously shook his head, and bent lower, and pressed his feet  with both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not &rsquo;im!&rdquo; came contemptuously in a chorus from the young McClures;  &ldquo;it was Tom Brady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Eaglefoot,&rdquo; the parson said, politely, addressing his wife  in Bill&rsquo;s interests. &ldquo;He it was who&mdash;who&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson paused for a word. It was supplied by one of the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you lent the half-crowns to, Mrs. McCulloch,&rdquo; she said, with a  boisterous laugh, in which everyone but Bill and the parson joined. Bill rarely  ever joined in laughs.</p>
<p>For a while Mrs. McCulloch stared at Bill with wonder and surprise in  her eye. But Bill didn&rsquo;t let his eyes meet hers. He suddenly straightened up,  and said: &ldquo;What time will you want the horse in the morning, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson wasn&rsquo;t sure what hour he would require the animal, and  started to consider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, sir,&rdquo; Bill added promptly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put him in the  little paddick for you where he&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;andy, sir, and I&rsquo;ll have him ready for  you just whenever you want &rsquo;im, sir. Is everythink out of the sulky, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything was except Mrs. McCulloch, and when she started to climb  down Bill moved round to the other side of the horse, and fumbled with the  harness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, sir,&rdquo; Bill said to the parson, when Mrs. McClure and  the girls had taken charge of Mrs. McCulloch and the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t wait, sir; I&rsquo;ll look after everythink, an&rsquo; see it&rsquo;s all  right, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill hurriedly turned the horse round to take the trap to the shed, and  came into collision with Black Lizzie, who had emerged from the rear of the  kitchen to empty a bucket of suds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out o&rsquo; th&rsquo; road,&rdquo; Bill said, in a lordly way. Bill could never  stand women poking about, and getting in his way when he had responsible work  to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shutit yer mouth,&rdquo; Lizzie responded, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer black snake! I&rsquo;ll put th&rsquo; horse over y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Bill hissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you callit me bad names,&rdquo; Lizzie answered, scowling angrily.  &ldquo;You been too pflash alergetter! You likeit I marry you once, and stoleit money  from Missa Parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ugly old heathen!&rdquo; Bill said, forcing the animal&rsquo;s head towards  the black woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trowit bucket over y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Lizzie shouted, stepping back.</p>
<p>Bill urged the unwilling animal, who displayed more manners than  himself, to trample Lizzie underfoot.</p>
<p>Lizzie, suiting the action to the word, heaved the contents of the  bucket into the face of both Bill and the horse, and a quantity of the fluid  went down Bill&rsquo;s throat, and made him cough. The horse, quiet and all as it  was, suddenly took alarm. It swung on to Bill and knocked him in a heap on the  ground, and dragged the cart over him, then trotted off with the reins dangling  about its heels.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page063.jpg" alt="heaved" width="536" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Lizzie, her white eyes bulging from their sockets, followed up her  advantage. She threw the empty bucket at Bill, and rattled it on his head; then  she flew savagely at him and kicked him in the ribs with her bare big toe. Bill  tried to rise and meet her on fair footing, but Lizzie put both hands to him  and shoved him over, then, changing her foot, delivered him a fresh series of  place-kicks with the other toe.</p>
<p>Bill rolled about, and bellowed &ldquo;Murder! Murder!&rdquo; The next moment the  house was emptied, and Mrs. McClure and the parson and the bigger girls all  rushed excitedly to the rescue.</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure took charge of the black washerwoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you mean, Lizzie?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He been callit me &lsquo;black snake&rsquo;,&rdquo; Lizzie foamed, with all the wild  blood of the black surging in her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; Bill whimpered, sheltering himself behind the form of the  parson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll summons her for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill always had a lot of faith in the justice of the law courts. In  this respect he was a singular man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You summits me,&rdquo; Lizzie hissed scornfully, &ldquo;an&rsquo; you heah mo&rsquo; about  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the parson remembered having left his turnout in charge of  Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the horse and sulky?&rdquo; he asked, looking anxiously up and down  the yard.</p>
<p>Bill turned round quickly, and when he saw the horse had passed through  the small wicket gate into the calf yard, and had only taken the harness and  shafts with him, threw up his hands, and displayed symptoms of insanity, or  something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> did it, sir,&rdquo; he yelled, pointing to black Lizzie, &ldquo;<i>she</i> did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie defended herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> been do it!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;he been do it himself, Missa Parson; he  let yarraman go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure and Mrs. McCulloch and the girls became hysterical, and  moaned at sight of the disabled sulky, while the poor parson, staring rigidly  for several seconds, murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear! Dear! Dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan McClure appeared on the scene. He stared with wondering eyes at  the broken sulky, then at the sad-looking spectators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha th&rsquo; deil did a&rsquo; this?&rdquo; he said, in a firm tone.</p>
<p>The parson and Mrs. McClure and the girls commenced in the same breath  to give Duncan a confused and unintelligible account of the disaster. Duncan  only caught the name of Lizzie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black deil,&rdquo; he broke out, furiously; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kick her oot o&rsquo; th&rsquo;  place.&rdquo; And, swinging his arms about, turned, and took a step in the direction  of the kitchen. The parson, with uplifted arms, intercepted Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hasty, McClure,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it was not, I think, all the  woman&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we tell you it was old Bill&rsquo;s?&rdquo; the eldest girl broke in,  wildly. &ldquo;He let the horse wander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Duncan yelled, jumping round. &ldquo;An&rsquo; whit way did ye no tell me  sae at first? Th&rsquo; guid for naething! I&rsquo;ll twist his scraggy neck!&rdquo; And he  glared all around in search of Eaglefoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was not exactly his fault, either, McClure,&rdquo; the parson  said, wishing to see justice done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I canna&rsquo; listen tae a&rsquo; these contradeections; somebody maun hae dune  it,&rdquo; Duncan yelled angrily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nae the first time they&rsquo;ve negleckit my  property, an&rsquo; I canna stan&rsquo; it, an&rsquo; I willna&rsquo;.&rdquo; And Duncan swung his arms about  more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not your trap, McClure,&rdquo; the parson said, turning to the  damaged sulky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not ours, paw,&rdquo; the eldest girl exclaimed cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the meenister&rsquo;s ain,&rdquo; Mrs. McClure put in, soothingly.</p>
<p>Duncan&rsquo;s countenance instantly changed, and he looked towards the house  for assurance that the minister&rsquo;s turn-out was not standing there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really thocht it was my ain,&rdquo; he said, smiling, and turned and eyed  the parson&rsquo;s broken property for several moments. Then he gazed at the  minister, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasna much guid&mdash;it was aye a middlin&rsquo; auld yun, pairrson.&rdquo;</p>

  Visiting the Congregation</b></h2>
<p>The poor parson and his family put in a pleasant night at &ldquo;Loch Ness.&rdquo;  They were waited on hand and foot; given the best rooms and beds in the house,  and next morning, in McClure&rsquo;s sulky, they drove out through the big gate to  continue their &ldquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be carefu&rsquo;, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan, thinking of his property, called  out as he closed the gate behind the vehicle, &ldquo;an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t let the horse out o&rsquo;  your hands at a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson assured Duncan he would take every precaution with the  borrowed chattel, then, giving the reins a series of tugs, gradually worked the  animal into a steady jog, and the sulky rolled away westward.</p>
<p>It was a long, slow, sleepy drive, and all through the day, as the  sulky creaked along, a swarm of wretched flies followed, pestering the  occupants, and settling thickly on all parts of the horse. Still they dragged  along on their weary way&mdash;on past the old sheep station, with its deserted yards  luxuriant with nettles and horehounds; in and out of the rough, steep, stony  crossings; on past the camping ground, where bullock teams were spelling, and  drivers drinking rum beneath the drays; past the Leaning Apple Tree, where lay  the rude-cut sandstone that marked the resting-place of a murdered pioneer;  past the Survey Camp, the Sugar Loaf, and the Horseshoe Bend; then, crossing  the long gap, the sulky entered a newly-fenced lane, and Macpherson&rsquo;s green corn  and the iron-roofed humpy, sitting almost on the edge of it, burst full in  view. The tired children sat up, and stared expectantly&mdash;stared as though it  were the streets of Canaan they were entering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose place is it, Maw?&rdquo; the eldest child asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Macpherson&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the mother answered, &ldquo;but we are not going to wait  at it overlong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t a verandah, Maw,&rdquo; said another of the offspring, making a  discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor a chimbely,&rdquo; from another, and the young McCullochs displayed an  inclination to greet the poor selector&rsquo;s habitation with a display of mirth,  but their mother told them &ldquo;they mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the dogs barked, and rushed out under the two-rail fence and  surrounded the sulky. The poor parson drew up to the slip-rails, and, allowing  the old horse to stand opposite the door of the house, waited for some movement  on the part of the occupants. For several minutes they waited. Then the parson  called out at the top of his voice. A small bare head showed cautiously round  one corner of the house, then another, and another. The parson beckoned, and  the three heads suddenly disappeared. The parson smiled amusedly at his wife,  then steadily watched the corner of the house for the heads to appear again.  The heads appeared round the opposite corner, and for quite a long interval  remained studying the visitors&mdash;remained until Mrs. McCulloch&rsquo;s eyes rested on  them; then, like black divers in the water, they vanished again.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page069.jpg" alt="heads" width="529" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Poor things!&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch sighed, &ldquo;how afraid they seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next moment there was a loud rustling in the tall corn, and Mrs.  Macpherson, followed by her two grown-up daughters, Mary and Ellen, with large  white calico bonnets on their heads, and each carrying a reaping hook and a  large bundle of green suckers that they had been cutting for the pigs,  appeared. They got a great surprise when they saw the sulky standing at the  fence, and dropped their bundles.</p>
<p>The parson&rsquo;s tired old horse pricked his lop ears, and feebly whinnied  for the discarded fodder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. and Mrs. McCulloch,&rdquo; they exclaimed, and the toil-worn,  sunburnt women of the selection hurried with beaming faces to the side of the  sulky, and, in turn, shook hands with everyone in it. The poor parson and his  wife were pleased to see them, and inquired kindly after Mr. Macpherson and  other members of the Macpherson family.</p>
<p>Mrs. Macpherson was sorry Macpherson was over at Finlay&rsquo;s, giving them  a hand with the threshing, and wouldn&rsquo;t be home till the moon was up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Alex,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is down in the potatoes, and will be up in a few  minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, looking at Mrs. McCulloch and the children, she added, &ldquo;If I had  only known you would be coming this way, I would have had the kettle boiling;  but it won&rsquo;t take two minutes if you will come inside, and wait a little  while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was nearly down, however, and the poor parson wished to make  Sandy Stewart&rsquo;s place before dark, and Stewart&rsquo;s place was a couple of miles  further along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you will wait for Alex to come, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mrs. Macpherson  pleaded, with a motherly consideration for her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming now, I think, mother,&rdquo; Ellen said; &ldquo;I fancy I can hear  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment they could all hear him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer are you going to be in there?&rdquo; came angrily from just  inside the corn. And, receiving no answer, the voice of Alex yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen! Ellen! Do y&rsquo; think I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to break my back carryin&rsquo; these  dashed things any further? ELLEN!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Macpherson and the two girls went red and became confused.</p>
<p>A huge potato rose suddenly out of the corn, and, swishing through the  air, smashed into mash against the end of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By crikey, I&rsquo;ll fetch you out o&rsquo; that. . . El-len!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second potato swished through the air, and made a big wet spot on the  door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alex!&rdquo; Mrs. Macpherson called out feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;N why th&rsquo; blazes couldn&rsquo;t some of y&rsquo; answer before?&rdquo; Alex growled,  brushing the cornstalks aside, and making his way into the open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she bally well thinks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alex lifted his eyes, and, seeing the parson and his wife in the sulky,  suddenly stopped. Then he turned, and rushed back into the corn like a clean  skin taking to a scrub, and disappeared. Alex was a sensitive son.</p>
<p>The parson and his wife shook hands with Mrs. Macpherson and her two  daughters, and went on their way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  A Surprise for the Stewarts</b></h2>
<p>The Stewarts had not received word that the poor parson was coming to  their place, and the appearance of the sulky at the gate just at dusk gave them  a start. All through the afternoon the farm had been thrown into a state of  excitement. The men and members of the family were rushing here and there and  bustling each other to get their work finished. And there was a lot of work to  finish at Stewart&rsquo;s; a hundred cows were milked every day; a separator  employed; fifty pigs fed and looked after; and reaping machines and  chaffcutters to keep going. But now the commotion was all centred about the  dwelling. The Stewarts were holding a ball that night, and all were actively  engaged doing something to complete the final preparations. Some of the male  members of the family were piling wood into a heap in the back yard to make the  illuminations with; others were polishing their boots; the girls, laden with  crockery and provender, were all flying in and out of the house putting finishing  touches to the supper arrangements.</p>
<p>Minnie, the eldest girl, caught sight of the visitors, and rushed  inside, where her mother and sisters were employed</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;who do you think&rsquo;s coming in at the gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others looked up, and stared with wonder in their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blessed parson and all his tribe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the others groaned incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour bright!&rdquo; Minnie gasped further; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re in the sulky&mdash;the whole  blessed kit of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t give them a room here to-night,&rdquo; Mrs. Stewart murmured,  thinking of the invited guests and all the children and babies they would bring  along with them. &ldquo;What on earth are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them to go to the deuce,&rdquo; Agnes, the second girl, forgetting  herself for the moment, blurted out. </p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Agnes!</i>&rdquo; Mrs.  Stewart said, reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did they want coming to-night for, above all nights?&rdquo; And  Agnes screwed up her face, and proceeded with the decorating.</p>
<p>John, the third son, rushed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wars! Do you know who&rsquo;s out there?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The look on the faces of his mother and sisters told him plainly they  did know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, bust them!&rdquo; Agnes said, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes! Agnes!&rdquo; Mrs. Stewart exclaimed, indignantly.</p>
<p>John burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Agnes looked sullen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of yous,&rdquo; he said, looking at his sisters, &ldquo;&rsquo;ll open the ball  with old McCulloch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop this, for goodness sake, and let us go and meet them,&rdquo; Mrs.  Stewart interrupted, earnestly, and, throwing off her apron, led the way out.  The three daughters, with John tailing at their heels to cheer them up,  followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mr. McCulloch!&rdquo; Mrs. Stewart said, in pleased, surprised tones.  &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve brought Mrs. McCulloch and the children with you. Well, I am  pleased to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girls, smiling pleasantly, stepped forward and echoed their mother&rsquo;s  welcome and showered kisses on Mrs. McCulloch and the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have come a better night,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to  have a great, big party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John grinned at his sisters, and proceeded to take charge of the horse  and sulky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter  15<br>
  A Word in Season</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come inside, Mrs. McCulloch,&rdquo; Mrs. Stewart said, &ldquo;and take your hat  off. Come along too, Mr. McCulloch&rdquo;; and, briskly mounting the steps, she led  the way in. Agnes, following closely behind the parson, who removed his hat,  and carried it in his hand, communicated her feelings of disappointment to her  sisters with a series of head-shakes and facial contortions. The parson turned  to her as he reached the threshold of the door, and remarked how hot the day  had been, and how dusty the roads were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hasn&rsquo;t it been wretched;&rdquo; Agnes said, changing her countenance  quickly, and speaking effusively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you came at all, Mr.  McCulloch, and <i>such</i> a long drive,  too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson explained, as he stepped inside and took a seat, that they  had only come from McClure&rsquo;s place that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McClure and Peter and Bessie are to be here to-night,&rdquo; Catherine  put in, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>McClure is?</i>&rdquo; the parson  said, in surprised tones, and added, &ldquo;He never made mention of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t know about it,&rdquo; Agnes said, &ldquo;until one of the men went  over this morning, and you would have left before he arrived, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson nodded his head in forgiveness of McClure&rsquo;s sin of omission.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart, dressed for the night, and with his red whiskers combed,  entered the room, and, in a quiet, homely way, welcomed the visitors. And while  he engaged the parson in conversation about the &ldquo;want of rain,&rdquo; and the corn,  and the harvest prospects, and the state of the country generally, which he  cheerfully described as &ldquo;rippin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Agnes and her two sisters slipped away to  the kitchen to see about getting tea ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May Old Harry take them!&rdquo; Agnes growled, snatching a fist full of cups  and saucers from a shelf, and rattling them recklessly on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; from Catherine; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll have to sit up all  night, that&rsquo;s all; the children can go to bed in John&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that altogether,&rdquo; Agnes rattled on, &ldquo;but we were far enough  behind as it was, and before we get tea over now, and dressed, everyone will be  here on top of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John, with a broad grin on his face, and a pair of polished boots  dangling in his hand, looked in at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone what comes is expected to dance, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he said  jeeringly.</p>
<p>Agnes scowled, and was about to say something uncomplimentary, when her  mother hurried in from the sitting room, and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the table for just a minute, girls, and come along in; the  minister wants to have a short prayer before everyone comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John instantly dropped his boots on the floor, and vanished into his  room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>mother!</i>&rdquo; Catherine said,  with open arms, and simultaneously a cup and saucer slipped from Agnes&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dash it! Look at that!&rdquo; said Agnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes!&rdquo; Mrs. Stewart hissed, angrily, &ldquo;you must mind what you are  saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no time for prayers, anyhow,&rdquo; Agnes snarled; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll never  be ready in time at this rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t keep you a minute,&rdquo; Mrs. Stewart said, soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he keeps us long, I&rsquo;ll get up and come right out, so I will,&rdquo;  and Agnes, with bad grace, proceeded to obey her parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find the big Bible,&rdquo; Mrs. Stewart added, as the girls filed in, &ldquo;while  I go and tell John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tripped smartly to her son&rsquo;s room, and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>There was no response; not a sound of any kind came from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; she called quietly into the keyhole.</p>
<p>Still no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there, John?. . . <i>John</i>,  do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing but silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;JOHN!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But time was slipping away; and Mrs. Stewart turned, and hastened  inside.</p>
<p>Then the door of John&rsquo;s room opened cautiously and noiselessly, and  John, in his stocking-soles, came out and tip-toed stealthily to where his  boots lay at the kitchen door. The kitchen door gaped in full view of the  occupants of the front room, and John, to avoid observation, paused, and  reached over to secure his property. Stewart&rsquo;s eyes rested on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; he bawled, unceremoniously. The surprise threw John off his  balance; but, recovering himself with a struggle, he secured one boot, and  raced up the yard with it.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page075.jpg" alt="flew" width="534" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Stewart didn&rsquo;t call again. His attention was turned to the female  members of his household. They were searching high and low for the Family  Bible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything has been shifted from its proper place to-day,&rdquo; Mrs.  Stewart said, apologetically, to the parson, who sat wiping his spectacles.</p>
<p>The parson nodded good-humouredly, as though he understood.</p>
<p>Stewart&rsquo;s eyes rested on the volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s richt there, top o&rsquo; the book case,&rdquo; he said, and rising and  placing his chair in position, mounted it cautiously and reached for the Bible.  When his huge hands grasped it, a pack of well-thumbed cards slid off the  cover, and went to pieces against his forehead, and flew all over the room,  and, for the most part, lay with their evil-looking faces uppermost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guid Lord!&rdquo; Stewart gasped in astonishment, and, descending the chair,  placed the book on the table.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stewart remembered having told Mrs. McCulloch that she didn&rsquo;t  believe in cards at all and turned scarlet and looked from one to another and  wished in her heart that the house and the prayer-meeting and the dance that  was coming off would all suddenly sink into the earth.</p>
<p>Agnes, with an amused smile on her face, which she contrived to conceal  by bending down her head, sprang forward and proceeded to collect the exposure.  When she had gathered it up, she paused wondering whether to put the pack away,  or throw it out of the window. Stewart seemed to anticipate the latter, and  silently took them out of her hand and put them in his coat pocket. Then he sat  down heavily in his chair and looked solemnly at Mrs. Stewart.</p>
<p>The minister turned over the leaves of the Bible, and read a passage  from the Scriptures; then, while the others reverently bowed their heads, he  began to pray. At the end of twenty minutes he was still praying.</p>
<p>John turned noiselessly to the kitchen, and, securing his other boot,  threw it at the cat, who was standing on the tea-table gnawing at the leg of a  fowl that had been left uncovered. The cat, in its flight, carried some of the  crockery off the end of the table with a crash, and, with its back up, raced  past Bruiser, the dog, who was standing at the door. Bruiser was suddenly  inspired with the spirit of the chase, and, with his teeth bared, pursued the  cat. They both rushed headlong into the prayer-meeting. To escape its pursuer  the cat flew up on to the book-case; then calmly walked round the edge of it,  looking down triumphantly on the disappointed canine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gerroot!&rdquo; Stewart said, under his breath, and the dog reluctantly  retreated to the door, but, finding no further notice taken of his presence,  turned and sat down on his woolly tail, and barked across the room at the cat.  Stewart shook his head, and frowned angrily at the dog. Bruiser misunderstood,  and trotted across the room again, and reared his hairy form up along the  book-case, and barked some more.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page077.jpg" alt="barked" width="750" height="563"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Con-foond it!&rdquo; Stewart broke out, and, rising, seized Bruiser by the  skin of his neck, and dragged him outside, where he gave him his liberty and a  heavy kick in the ribs.</p>
<p>John put his head out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! he&rsquo;s horribly long,&rdquo; the parent murmured, and reluctantly returned  to see it out.</p>
<p>Another twenty minutes passed; then the parson concluded his prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter  16<br>
  Preparing for Conquest</b></h2>
<p>When Agnes returned to the kitchen she was very white and couldn&rsquo;t  speak. She bounced round, scowling threateningly, and threw things about like a  man. But it didn&rsquo;t take long to serve the tea; no one but the parson and his  family was hungry; the others were too anxious and excited to eat. And before  the girls could clear away the tea things and finish washing-up, the guest  began to arrive thickly.</p>
<p><i>Then</i> there was excitement! Agnes and her two  sisters rushed away to &ldquo;dress&rdquo;; John stationed himself at the gate leading to  the horse yard, and boisterously hailed the new arrivals, and warned them to  mind &ldquo;the stump,&rdquo; and showed them where to put their horses and gear. Stewart  took charge of the elderly guests, and introduced them to the parson, while  Mrs. Stewart crowded the females into the girls&rsquo; room, where they rejoiced and  hugged each other heartily, and removed their riding habits and hats, and  tittivated themselves up&mdash;straightened their bows and arranged their hair, while  they proudly told each other whom they were engaged by for the first dance, and  lamented having promised to dance with some fool or other in the second</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; Agnes, with her mouth full of hair pins, mumbled, by way of  diversion, as she stood before the looking glass, &ldquo;the blessed parson and his  mob must turn up just as we were going to have tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nuisance!&rdquo; the others said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll all be here the whole jolly night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why didn&rsquo;t you send them over to our place?&rdquo; Miss Braddon said.  &ldquo;They could have had the house all to themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told ma to tell them to go to the deuce,&rdquo; Agnes answered.</p>
<p>The others all laughed&mdash;all but Miss Braddon. She was a very religious  girl. She looked shocked, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On, you didn&rsquo;t Agnes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agnes turned to Catherine for confirmation, but just then the  concertina struck up in the ball-room, and great commotion set in. Some of the  girls nearly went off their heads; some of them scampered out; some appealed to  others for assistance in adjusting their attire; but none could afford to give  any assistance. They were too flurried and in too big a hurry to decorate  themselves. Miss Braddon failed to button the back of Mary Brennan&rsquo;s dress;  Ellen McGee lost her hairpins; Bridget Brown couldn&rsquo;t button one of her new  shoes. At the last moment Miss Maynard discovered that Agnes&rsquo;s petticoat was  showing below her dress. Agnes said, &ldquo;Heavens! no, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and appealed to  Miss Braddon. Miss Braddon supported Miss Maynard. Agnes said, &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;  again, and proceeded to undo a lot of herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stewart came to the door with Mrs. Finch and her two daughters,  and showed them in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, Agnes,&rdquo; she said, impatiently; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s such a lot of people  waiting to be looked after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dash it, mother,&rdquo; Agnes squealed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hurrying up all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bridget Brown, with her shoe in her hand, flopped in a heap on the  floor, and laughed hysterically at Agnes. Catherine, in her excitement, turned  a bottle of perfume upside down, and the contents went all over Bridget.  Bridget suddenly outrivalled Agnes in language, and sprang to her feet, and,  shaking her head and clothes about, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my heavens, the beastly stuff&rsquo;s all over me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agnes screamed at Bridget; Miss Braddon screamed at Catherine and  Bridget; they all screamed at each other. Mrs. Stewart hurried off to meet a  contingent of guests who had arrived from the Back Plains, and were mooning  their way up the steps. They were mostly young fellows, big, bashful, young  fellows, who liked to avoid attention or ceremony of any kind, and preferred to  stand at the door of the ball-room, and look in until they became used to the  surroundings, or till the surroundings became used to them.</p>
<p>Outside, behind the kitchen, quite a crowd of men and boys were  gathered round the fire listening to the strains of the concertina, and talking  about shooting hares and riding buck-jumpers. Suddenly an accordeon struck up,  and drowned the notes of the concertina. Tommy Saunders turned his face from  the fire, and said in a chuckle-headed sort of way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Litthen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goth Tham Jackthon with hith &rsquo;cordyun. He&rsquo;ll keep their legth  movin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My oath, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; the others said, in solemn admiration of Sam  Jackson, and went on talking about horses and rifles.</p>
<p>The ballroom started to fill up, till all around it stood young girls  and lively looking matrons of various ages, all dressed in white muslin, and  ornamented profusely with roses and bows of different hues.</p>
<p>Agnes, followed by Bridget Brown, squeezed through the crush at the door  and entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wars!&rdquo; Tommy Carter said, &ldquo;smell th&rsquo; scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bridget blushed; then burst out laughing, and hurried to a seat and hid  her face behind a fan.</p>
<p>Just inside Mrs. Stewart&rsquo;s bedroom door, looking into the ball-room,  the poor parson and his family, with Stewart, old Mrs. McCreedy, and Granny  Baker keeping them company, were accommodated with chairs. Beside them, upon  Mrs. Stewart&rsquo;s bed, lay a miscellaneous cargo of hats and a squad of infants  kicking their heels up at the ceiling, and goo-gooing contentedly.</p>
<p>At regular intervals numbers of girls, to let Mrs. McCulloch see how  they looked in their ball dresses, would file in, and ask her &ldquo;if she danced!&rdquo;  and the good wife of the poor parson would smile on them, and shake her head in  the negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter  17<br>
  Stewart&rsquo;s Ball</b></h2>
<p>Charlie Bowers, with a slip of paper and pencil between his fingers,  stepped into the centre of the ball-room, and, glancing at the door opening on  to the verandah, where a crowd of eager young men were gathered, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Select yer partners for the first set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd of silent-looking men congregated in the doorway shyly  entered the ball-room and, tramping across the floor, offered their arms to the  partners they had engaged; then, with their tanned faces beaming with delight,  proceeded in irregular order to &ldquo;promenade.&rdquo; Those who had not been fortunate  enough to secure partners beforehand stalked clumsily from one &ldquo;wall flower&rdquo; to  another murmuring, &ldquo;May I have the pleasure?&rdquo; And if by chance the &ldquo;clodhopper&rdquo;  of the evening asked a girl who was a capable performer to join him and make an  exhibition of herself, she would blush and smile and say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll  get up this time, thank you, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then when a good dancer would come along she would fasten on to his arm  eagerly, and hurry into the thick of the fun. And, having asked every available  female in the room, the unhappy clodhopper would retire sullenly to the shadow  of the door, and regard the lying females, as they frisked round with other  fellows, with a suspicious eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two sets, double tops and bottoms!&rdquo; the M.C. called out in a voice  that commanded a lot of respect. The promenading suddenly ceased then, and a  scrimmage set in for the best positions. All those who were certain of the  &ldquo;figures&rdquo; rushed the &ldquo;tops&rdquo; and &ldquo;bottoms,&rdquo; and those who could only &ldquo;feel their  way through them&rdquo; fought for &ldquo;sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The M.C. counted heads. &ldquo;Another couple wanted,&rdquo; he shouted, and his  eye roamed round the room in search of someone to fill the gap.</p>
<p>Big Bridget Bailey, sitting silently in a corner with a stiff, stubborn  upper lip, was the only possible female.</p>
<p>The eyes of several half-bashful young fellows hovering about the door  also roamed round the room. &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; the M.C. called encouragingly to  them, &ldquo;take up Miss Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-bashful young fellows smiled and shrank right out of sight.</p>
<p>Every eye on the floor was turned towards the door. It seemed to be the  only quarter that salvation was expected from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another couple wanted!&rdquo; the M.C. cried louder than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Willie,&rdquo; Miss Merton said coaxingly to her young brother,  &ldquo;and take Miss Bailey up, do.&rdquo; There was a loud guffaw on the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the parson take her up,&rdquo; Willie replied just loud enough to be  heard. Then there was a loud laugh inside.</p>
<p>In the middle of the mirth, the &ldquo;clodhopper,&rdquo; having recovered his  temper, shoved his way in from the verandah, with a broad smile on his face and  his chest expanded, and looked hopefully at Bridget. Those on the verandah  applauded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Coulter,&rdquo; the M.C. said kindly, &ldquo;Miss Bailey has no  partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; the clodhopper said bravely, and striding heavily  across the floor, bowed and gave his arm to Bridget. Bridget responded like a  racehorse, and bounced with him into position.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page084.jpg" alt="bowed" width="482" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The little gathering at the door tittered and guffawed some more, and  someone remarked that the clodhopper was in for a bad time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; Saunders, who had abandoned the fire for a few moments,  grunted; &ldquo;she&rsquo;d have to be bad to be worth than &rsquo;im. That bloketh th&rsquo; wortht  danther ever wath made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the accordeon opened fire again and roared to the strains of &ldquo;The  Quaker&rsquo;s Wife,&rdquo; and all the couples turned and bowed to each other and scraped  the floor with their feet; and the M.C. cried, &ldquo;Half rights and lefts, and  ladies&rsquo; chain,&rdquo; and away they all went with a whirl. Dance! They did dance!  They led up, and cantered up, and swung and twirled and galloped, and shouted  and collided with each other, to the intense delight of themselves and the  amusement of those looking on from the bed-room. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Between times they puffed and  panted and sparred for breath.</p>
<p>Then &ldquo;Hands round&rdquo; from the M.C., and off they would go again.  &ldquo;Faster,&rdquo; to the musician, who answered like a German band, and while the floor  creaked and strained and the house shook, and skirts flew round and fanned the  air, a counter commotion suddenly sprang up outside. It sounded like the  approach of the French on Waterloo. The crowd that thronged the front door  rushed off the verandah, and made their way round to the back of the house to  investigate the disturbance. All the dogs about the place, and there must have  been fifty or more, started barking. Nearer came the noise. A cheer rent the  air outside. Old Stewart rose excitedly from his place in the bed-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bag-pipes!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;McClure wi&rsquo; his pipes.&rdquo; The women  became excited, and the parson put his head on one side to listen, then smiled  complacently. In the wild, shrill strains one could almost hear the words&mdash;&ldquo;The  Campbells are coming&mdash;hurrah, hurrah,&rdquo; as the row reached the door. And as the  &ldquo;stockyard&rdquo; ended, and the dancers, out of breath, retired to their seats, the  full force of the wild music burst into the room, followed by the burly form of  McClure dressed in kilts, his chin elevated, his cheeks and his eyes and his  chest blown out. Talk about a noise! It was a noise!</p>
<p>Around the room McClure marched, the wild cat-like calls mingled with a  low, &ldquo;burring&rdquo; accompaniment fairly shaking the rafters. Some of the party  cheered him; some screamed and put their fingers in their ears; some ran  outside; the children on the bed started bag-pipes on their own account, and  their mothers ran to them to soothe them, and said, &ldquo;Sh&mdash;dear! Sh&mdash;dear&mdash;it&rsquo;s  nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page086.jpg" alt="marched" width="510" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The dogs tried to burrow their way into the room between the legs of  the men who were gaping in astonishment at the door, and were zealously kicked  back on to the verandah, Horses that were fastened to the fence near the house  instead of being turned into the paddock broke their moorings and raced  frantically around in the dark, smashing and crashing over every obstacle in  the yard. And while all this went on, Duncan halted in the middle of the floor,  and, beating time with the flat of his big boot, suddenly changed the tune to a  measure not intelligible to any but old Stewart, and the parson, and their  wives. They were Scotch, and understood the subtleties of Scotch music.</p>
<p>And Stewart and the parson, with the light of patriotism in their eyes,  rose and smiled out at Duncan. Suddenly the wild, weird music of the pipes  ceased, like so many cats dispersed with a brick, and Duncan, by way of  apology, burst out, &ldquo;Blaw it, I&rsquo;ve lost a&rsquo; ma win&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the voice of Saunders rang excitedly through the door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every horth out here hath broke away, and they&rsquo;re rathin&rsquo; over  everythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And scarcely were the words out of his mouth when one of the brutes  attached to the dray that had brought all the McGrogans to the ball careered  past the front steps and carried away one of the verandah posts, and made the  whole house tremble. Commotion of a new order set in then. Those who owned  horses ran out into the dark to secure their property. Those who didn&rsquo;t own  horses, or came with borrowed ones, strolled out calmly to see what was  happening. There was a lot of rushing about, and cries of &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Look  out!&rdquo; filled the air until the affrighted animals were all bailed up in corners  and secured again. Then the rescuers investigated the damage and returned to  the ball-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that auld moke o&rsquo; mine a&rsquo; richt, Bill?&rdquo; Duncan McClure inquired of  Bill Brown, who was first to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s there all right,&rdquo; Bill answered; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; looking steadily at  the poor parson, &ldquo;one of the shafts of the minister&rsquo;s sulky is smashed to  pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Duncan bawled, and dropped the pipes on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, ah, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch murmured, looking sadly at Mrs.  Stewart. &ldquo;The sulky smashed, and it belongs to Mr. McClure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson anxiously consulted Mr. Stewart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my ain fau&rsquo;t&mdash;my ain fau&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Duncan roared. &ldquo;I shouldna ha lent  it&mdash;I shouldna ha lent it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whaur&rsquo;s John?&rdquo; Stewart called, coming from the bedroom. Then,  addressing Duncan, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; John&rsquo;s fau&rsquo;t, no the minister&rsquo;s, McClure. The lazy  yokel must a&rsquo; left it i&rsquo; the yard. <i>John</i>,&rdquo;  he called, again going to the verandah.</p>
<p>Saunders appeared at the door once more in an excited state to convey  some fresh intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ithn&rsquo;t the minithter&rsquo;th trap that&rsquo;th broke,&rdquo; he said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Jim Moore said, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ours!</i>&rdquo; Miss Moore said, and  they both turned pale and stared as though their bank had failed.</p>
<p>Duncan McClure stared at Saunders. &ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s no mine at a&rsquo;, then?&rdquo; he  said, beginning to look cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;th Moore&rsquo;th,&rdquo; Saunders repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh me, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said, smiling all over his face, &ldquo;isna that  curious noo? That&rsquo;s the second time we thocht that sulky o&rsquo; mine was broke to  smithereens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; he added, turning to those in the ballroom; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s twice  noo a chap has tellt me it was smashed, and baith times it was some ither  body&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And, taking up the pipes again, he added, with a smile, &ldquo;Weel, I&rsquo;ll  play the Quadrille for you noo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was more rushing and scrambling for partners, and the dance  continued, and joy was unrestrained. And as the night wore on, the poor parson  and his wife began to look tired and weary of it all; and their children became  peevish and troublesome and whined to go home, and wouldn&rsquo;t be put to bed by  themselves in a strange place for any money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor people,&rdquo; Miss Braddon said sympathisingly to Agnes; &ldquo;what a  shame they have to sit up when they are not enjoying themselves,&rdquo; and suggested  that her brother should go and harness the sulky and drive them over to her  place, where they could go to bed and sleep comfortably. Agnes approved of the  idea, and Miss Braddon rose and broached it</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our place is not more than five miles away,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it will take  Willie no time to drive there. Mother is at home, and there&rsquo;s plenty of spare  beds, and you could all have a good night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson looked inquiringly at his wife. And Mrs. McCulloch  thought, if it wouldn&rsquo;t be disturbing Mrs. Braddon, and putting her to too much  trouble, it would be better than staying at the ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know mother would be only too pleased,&rdquo; Miss Braddon said, and went  off to hunt up her brother, who, along with others of his age, was on the  verandah with a large cup of hot tea and a tart in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Willie said. &ldquo;Go and yoke up and drive them down there this  hour of night! What are you giving us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others laughed at Willie&rsquo;s prospects. &ldquo;They have got a neck,&rdquo; and  Willie scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must now, Willie,&rdquo; his sister said persuasively; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told them  you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning to one of his companions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herby, you&rsquo;ll help him to yoke up, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with him, miss,&rdquo; Herby said cheerfully; and, finishing off his  tea, added, &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; and he hustled Willie down the steps.</p>
<p>Willie went reluctantly, and all the way up the yard, and until the  horse was caught and harnessed and the sulky waiting at the door to be occupied,  kept murmuring, &ldquo;Blow them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter  18<br>
  &ldquo;Till We Meet Again&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p>There was much fervent handshaking when the poor parson and his family  were ready to leave the ball, and a cheerful chorus of voices called out  &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; to them from the top of the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night to you all,&rdquo; was softly answered back, and in the middle of  the night the sulky left Stewart&rsquo;s place, and creaked and jolted along under  low, hanging trees, from the depths of whose gloomy shades the night birds  called and hooted dismally. In and out of short, treacherous gullies it rolled;  down the sloping banks of dark, dangerous-looking creeks it went, and up the  other side of the banks with a rattle and rush&mdash;a rush lest the horse might  change its mind, as horses sometimes do when half-way up, and run back and make  trouble in the bed of the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; Willie, who was in charge of the reins and  straining his practised eyes to take in the lay of the &ldquo;road,&rdquo; would say when  Mrs. McCulloch, every now and again, nervously clutched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened; I know every inch of this road like a book,&rdquo; and,  as if to prove Willie unreliable, one of the wheels of the sulky would  unexpectedly run over a log, and topple all the occupants but himself out of  position.</p>
<p>But Willie would hang out on the high side, to keep the concern from  going right over, and say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s orright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie was endowed with great presence of mind and rare balancing  powers; and when the trap would be righted, and the cries of fear had lost  themselves in the silence of the gloomy night, he would calmly remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten all about that one,&rdquo; and, belting the horse with the  double of the reins to coax him to make up lost time, would proceed to explain  to the minister &ldquo;that it was a log that had been left there by some beggars of  timbergetters quite three years ago.&rdquo; And when, finally, the other wheel  located an obstruction on the other side of the road, just to balance matters,  Willie chuckled, and said consolingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little black stump that was always there; and the slip-rails  are just here now.&rdquo; The slip-rails were there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; Willie cried cheerfully, taking a pull on the reins as the  animal steadied down. &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; and the minister and his wife heaved heavy  sighs of relief; and, in their hearts, offered a silent prayer to Providence  for having guided that sulky along such a road in safety; and in the fervour of  their feelings, they forgot to offer Willie any thing. But Willie didn&rsquo;t mind  that; he was not a youth who sought flattery or expected much reward for small  service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we alight?&rdquo; the minister asked, leaning on the wheel and  straining his weak eyes in the dark, to measure the distance to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, no! You&rsquo;re orright; stop in!&rdquo; Willie answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  drive right through if they&rsquo;re down, and I think they must be.&rdquo; And he leaned  forward and peered hard to see if he could locate the rails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s orright,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;Get erp!&rdquo; and flicked the old horse with  the reins. The animal hestitated; Willie flicked the reins again, and cried,  &ldquo;Wot are y&rsquo; fritent of?&rdquo; and the brute, responding, stepped smoothly over the  bottom rail, which was up, without giving any indication of his action, and  Willie hit him again. Then there was a sudden stop, also a jolt, and the horse  seemed to swerve and swing about in the collar (he was a good horse to pull  when he was near anyone&rsquo;s home), and Willie hit him some more, and yelled,  &ldquo;What are you up to?&rdquo; And the animal grunted, and the sulky started to rise  gently towards the sky, and a panic set in.</p>
<p>The upward motion was too unexpected and too unusual even for Willie.  He clutched the reins tight and yelled, &ldquo;Whoa! Whoa!&rdquo; and brought the brute to  a standstill just when both wheels were nicely balanced on the rail&mdash;and the  rail was about a foot off the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump out! Jump out!&rdquo; he commanded, in the general interests of himself  and his passengers. And the cries that came from Mrs. McCulloch and the sleepy  children woke up the dogs in the yard and started the roosters crowing on the barn  before their time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! good gracious!&mdash;good gracious!&mdash;what is happening?&rdquo; came from the  parson, who could see no way of jumping out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady! Steady!&rdquo; Willie cried to him; then took a header in the dark  himself, and fouled the rail, and fell on his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the war,&rdquo; he said, recovering himself and starting to laugh; &ldquo;do  you know what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What? What?</i>&rdquo; the poor  parson, feeling distractedly for the side of the elevated sulky, answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pulled her right up on top o&rsquo; the bottom rail, hanged if he  hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, going to the horse&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be orright, though&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lead him&mdash;hang tight, all of y&rsquo;,&rdquo; and  before the passengers had time to further consider the situation, Willie gave  the brute&rsquo;s head a pull, and the sulky jumped down off the rail, and bumped the  earth heavily, and broke both springs.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch seemed to think they had all fallen down a well, and let  out a series of screams, and then shuddered and shivered, and clung on tight to  the poor parson for protection. And the poor parson murmured, &ldquo;Man! Man! be  careful for our lives; there&rsquo;s something smashed beneath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-ay!&rdquo; Willie said to the horse. &ldquo;<i>Christmas!</i>&rdquo;  he added in tones of grave apprehension, realising from the crack that went off  what had happened.</p>
<p>Then, after groping and fumbling about the body of the sulky:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get out&mdash;they&rsquo;re both snapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson didn&rsquo;t wait to hear any more, and he didn&rsquo;t wait to  feel for the step with his foot to get down by either. And when Mrs. McCulloch  and the children were handed out, Willie asked solemnly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whose</i> sulky is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McClure&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the poor parson answered thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>not</i> his horse, then,&rdquo;  from Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it is my own horse,&rdquo; the minister said humbly; &ldquo;and I would be  better pleased if it were my own sulky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t your horse,&rdquo; Willie said confidently; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Ted O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s?&rdquo; from the poor parson in surprised tones. And &ldquo;Is it  not Brownie?&rdquo; in even more surprised tones from Mrs. McCulloch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This cove?</i>&rdquo; Willie answered  with a chuckle, and, patting the animal on the neck, &ldquo;Not much; he&rsquo;s a  chestnut. He was the easiest to catch; that&rsquo;s why we put him in. Ted won&rsquo;t miss  him, though, till I get back to Stewart&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you take the beast without the owner&rsquo;s knowledge and consent?&rdquo;  the poor parson asked, with a voice of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ted won&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Willie answered lightly; &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t know, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was not honourable, and it is against all laws to do such a  thing,&rdquo; the poor parson said reprovingly.</p>
<p>Willie laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the horse that&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; he put in; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the confounded  sulky that&rsquo;s worrying me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the damage very much?&rdquo; then queried the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two springs are gone&mdash;but they can be replaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to give the money to replace them, pa,&rdquo; from Mrs.  McCulloch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Replace them!</i>&rdquo; Willie  exclaimed in outraged sort of tones. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you! Let old Mac do it himself&mdash;he  can afford to, after the crop he had this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the minister and his wife smiled in the dark at Willie, but  neither made remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Willie went on, taking the horse by the head again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead  him over to the barn, and leave the sulky there; then I&rsquo;ll show you inside and  tell mother you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like a band of western nomads, the poor parson and his care,  stumbling over every little obstacle in the yard, followed along behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do now; come on&mdash;round this way,&rdquo; Willie said, leaving the  animal at the barn; then, warning them of the presence of a chaffcutter  standing in the line of march, and to avoid hitting their heads against the low  limb of a willow tree, led the way to the front door, which he opened  regardless of noise, and invited them inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep, mother?&rdquo; he called in a loud voice, shoving in the door of his  mother&rsquo;s bedroom, where a kerosene lamp was dimly burning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought  someone for you to find beds for to-night, or for this mornin&rsquo;&mdash;someone you know  well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hey, mother!</i>&rdquo; Willie called  at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>Still no answer.</p>
<p>Willie drew close to the bed, then suddenly turned pale as death, and  became alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mother!</i>&rdquo; he said in a low,  husky voice. Then, turning to the minister and his wife, who were waiting at  the door, &ldquo;<i>My heavens!</i> mother&rsquo;s <i>dead</i>&mdash;or something!&rdquo; and his strong young  frame trembled and shook like a gum leaf.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch sprang to the side of the bed, and, throwing her cloak  over her shoulders, leaned down, and, speaking softly to the aged form on the  bed, took her hand in hers and felt the motion of her pulse.</p>
<p>Turning to the son, she said softly: &ldquo;Your mother is really bad, but  there is yet life; go you for a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to her husband: &ldquo;Poor thing! Her face shows she has been in  great pain, too&mdash;perhaps taken with cramps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson stooped over and examined the helpless form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God, grant our sister strength, and restore her to the hearts of  her children, is all we ask of Thee,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Willie,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said to young Braddon, as she removed  her hat; &ldquo;show me where to find the things I&rsquo;ll want. We must put a fire on to  heat a kettle of water; and I&rsquo;ll need some flannel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kitchen and everything is out here, Mrs. McCulloch,&rdquo; Willie said,  breaking into a loud sob, and leading the way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some wood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch answered; &ldquo;just show me where it is, and you go at  once for the doctor. I&rsquo;ll put a fire on and find whatever I want. On your way,  call and tell Jessie, but don&rsquo;t frighten her, Willie. Say mother is not well,  and for her to hurry home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Running back to the bed-room, poor Willie stood at the door for a  moment as a last hope, and called &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; but, still receiving no answer,  broke into loud sobs, and, turning, hurried away to yard a saddle-horse.</p>
<p>And while Willie was riding hard by the light of the stars to bring the  doctor, who was five-and-twenty miles away; and while the poor parson himself  took charge of the tired children, and put them snugly to bed, and knelt and  prayed that they be kept from temptation, and that the life of the sick woman  be spared, and strength speedily restored her; and while Mrs. McCulloch was  moving tirelessly in and out from the kitchen to the bed-room, and from the  bed-room back to the kitchen, keeping the fire going, and wringing out hot  flannels, and applying them to the body of the patient, Miss Braddon, pale,  anxious and agitated, hurriedly arrived.</p>
<p>And Ah! it was sad to see her throw herself on her knees beside the  bed, and hear her imploring her mother to speak, &ldquo;to speak one word to Jessie.&rdquo;  And when no response&mdash;no sign of recognition came&mdash;it was more than the heart  could hold.</p>
<p>The poor parson, standing by, turned away to hide the tears that filled  his eyes and rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother! and I was away from you!&rdquo; Jessie broke out, then rose from  her knees, and Mrs. McCulloch took her in her arms, and talked kindly and  soothingly to her, and asked her to be brave and to hope for the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust in Him, Jessie,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I should,&rdquo; Jessie cried. &ldquo;But Oh! it&rsquo;s so hard! And to have  been away from her when she took sick! I can never forgive myself!&rdquo; And grief  seemed to take possession of the distracted girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind! Never mind!&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch was saying kindly, when the  poor parson detected a slight movement in the face of the sick woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wishes to speak, I think,&rdquo; he said quietly, and in a moment the  daughter was beside her mother again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Jessie</i>, mother,&rdquo; she  cried pitifully. &ldquo;Your own Jessie. Won&rsquo;t you speak to me, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page096.jpg" alt="jessie" width="508" height="750"></h2>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Again the poor parson turned silently away to hide his emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother?&rdquo; Jessie cried, placing her cheek close to hers, and  eagerly listening to catch any word that might be muttered.</p>
<p>After a painful silence there was a slight movement in the lips of the  sick woman, and she murmured faintly, &ldquo;Sing&mdash;for &mdash;me&rdquo; (another silence), and then, &ldquo;Sing&mdash;&lsquo;The&mdash;Lord&mdash;be &mdash;with&mdash;you&mdash;till&mdash;we&mdash;meet&mdash;again&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessie rose and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch turned to the poor parson and murmured, &ldquo;John, she  wishes us to sing, &lsquo;The Lord be with you till we meet again.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson bowed his head, and said solemnly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord God, strengthen us that we might lift our voices to Thee, and  sing with full and cheerful voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with their faces to the dying woman, the minister and his wife  stood waiting for Jessie to recover her self-control. With a sob and a struggle  she composed herself, and stood beside Mrs. McCulloch. Then together they  lifted their voices and sang through the hymn, without falter and with the  power and melody of a choir.</p>
<p>When the hymn was concluded, and the sound of their voices died away,  the sick woman, whose eyes were partly open, murmured, &ldquo;<i>Till&mdash;we&mdash;meet&mdash;again.</i>&rdquo; Then her eyes closed, and she passed quietly  away.</p>
<p>And as the grim grey dawn of another day stole softly in to the humble  bush home, and as the failing light of the kerosene lamp paled to a feeble  pallid glow, and the birds outside started to chirp and twitter, the frail white  hand of the minister rose with an effort above the bowed heads of the two  women, and remained silently poised for several seconds. But his voice broke,  and &ldquo;<i>Our Heavenly Father</i>. . . . <i>Christ Jesus. . . Amen</i>&rdquo; was all that was  audible of the prayer.</p>
<p>There was a rattling of wheels outside, then a cart drew up at the  front door, and Duncan McClure, still dressed in his kilts, alighted.</p>
<p>He was met on the verandah by the minister, who broke the news to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye dinna tell me that seriously, pairrson?&rdquo; Duncan said gravely.</p>
<p>The minister nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel! Weel! Weel!&rdquo; and McClure shook his head sadly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo;. .  . That&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo;. . . An&rsquo; puir Jessie! I&rsquo;m sair vexed for Jessie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Colin Kerr and his mother, and Miss Braydon and her two brothers,  and the two McFarlanes and Miss Macpherson, and others who had ridden and  driven miles out of their way, when returning home from the ball, appeared in  succession to ask how Mrs. Braddon was. And when the minister quietly told  them, they, too, almost doubted him for the moment, then their hearts went out  in sympathy for Jessie, and in turn they murmured, &ldquo;Poor Jessie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, putting their sympathy into practice, many of them remained, and  silently and willingly set about helping to carry out the numerous distressing  duties that Death thrusts upon the sorrowing members of a family, when it  enters suddenly and darkens the home.</p>
<p>And the sun had not long been up when Willie, in advance of the doctor,  his horse coated with flakes of foam, and the hot breath flying from its  flaming nostrils like steam from a railway engine, reined up at the door, and  sprang from the saddle. His hand firmly gripped a bottle of medicine that  protruded from his coat pocket, as he tossed the bridle reins to the ground.  Jessie, her eyes red with burning tears, her whole frame atremble, and with  Mrs. McCulloch holding her by the arm, came forward to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is mother?&rdquo; Willie asked, with a hurried, nervous look at his  sister.</p>
<p>The awful lump, which checks and chokes the effort of speech in moments  of grief, rose in Jessie&rsquo;s throat, and she stared at her brother in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;<i>gone</i>, Willie!&rdquo; Mrs.  McCulloch answered softly, and Willie hung his head, and, reeling back against  the side of the puffing horse, leaned with his head on his arms against the  saddle flap.</p>
<p>After a painful moment or two the poor parson approached him, and,  placing his hand on his shoulder, said kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Lord&rsquo;s will that your mother should be taken, Willie. She is  happy. Don&rsquo;t give way. Have courage in your trouble, and give strength and  support to your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie gulped back a choking sob, and, pulling himself together, lifted  his face to the poor parson&rsquo;s, and said, &ldquo;I will, Mr. McCulloch.&rdquo; Then he  firmly unsaddled the horse, and turned and joined Jessie.</p>
<p>Over the long and silent funeral that wended its weary way to the  little country graveyard in the hollow of the &ldquo;Apple-tree&rdquo; flat by the creek,  and the sorrowing and sympathy by the open grave when the poor parson in  impressive voice pronounced the words &ldquo;Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,&rdquo; let the  curtain gently fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Trouble at McLeod&rsquo;s</b></h2>
<p>Ah! it was a changed home that Jessie and Willie returned to, when  their mother&rsquo;s funeral was over. The bright and cheering face was missing, the  kind and gentle voice they had known and loved so long, silent! And though every  object about them held remembrances of their mother&rsquo;s affection, the place was  home to them no more. But they were not abandoned in the hour of their sorrow.  The poor parson and his wife still remained with them, and talked hopefully and  cheerfully to them of their prospects and plans for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jessie has decided to come home with me, and stay with us, pa,&rdquo; Mrs.  McCulloch intimated to the minister, &ldquo;and Willie will come, too, for a little  while. To-morrow we will return with the children, and maybe, pa, you would  choose to make the remainder of the calls on horseback. It would be more  convenient, and less of a hindrance, for you to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson fell in with his wife&rsquo;s suggestions, and, early on the  following morning, when he had seen them all safely seated in a roomy  spring-cart, climbed on to the back of a horse that Willie found for him, and  set out to make Archie McLennan&rsquo;s place at the out-station gate before night,  and to start back to Narralane the following day.</p>
<p>And, as the good shepherd jogged leisurely along beneath a canopy of  the clearest blue, with a fresh crisp breeze fanning his face and playing with  the puggery that fluttered from his hat, covering mile upon mile of the richest  and grandest country on God&rsquo;s earth&mdash;almost every acre of it lying fallow, when  it might have been dotted with smiling, prosperous homes and homesteads, and  bringing forth bread and fruits for the millions of souls that the Almighty  intended it should&mdash;his thoughts went out to the small, courageous band of  untutored pioneers scattered over that vast, primitive area, and, in sympathy  for them, forgot for the moment the stern reality of his own trials and  troubles, and the difficulties he was beset with ere he could subdue and  promote those rough conditions, in a social and spiritual sense. And the sleepy  native bears, as he passed beneath them, lifted their woolly heads, and peered  down from their places in the forks of the towering trees; great grey  kangaroos, too, hopped noiselessly across his path, and sitting up  majestically, with their white breasts squared to him, watched him go past. And  now and again a weary, homeless traveller with a heavy swag on his back saluted  him respectfully and inquired the time of day and the number of miles to the  nearest water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord God,&rdquo; the minister would murmur as he measured the magnitude of  the great solitary bush at a glance, &ldquo;open the eyes of the rulers of our nation  to the wealth that is hidden away here, that they may direct the steps of Thy  people to this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And every fresh valley with limpid streams winding through it; and  every towering belt of flawless timber, every undulating piece of plain land  that his eye rested on, the same prayer unconsciously left his lips with  increased fervour, till at last, about noon, he came in sight of Neil McLeod&rsquo;s  weird and humble habitation. It consisted for the most part of 160 acres of  dense scrub, with here and there large holes cut in it to make room for the  cultivation paddock and the house and yards. From a primitive point of view the  holding was a picture&mdash;a grand work of art. Imposing walls of mountains were  banked all round it, amongst whose silent gorges travellers were sometimes  doomed to lose their way, and where men in the D.T.&rsquo;s used to wander from  Shanahan&rsquo;s shanty on the new railway, and strip themselves of their clothes and  run from tree to tree concealing themselves, and calling out, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming!  They&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; Ah, yes! there was a lot of grim humour lurking about McLeod&rsquo;s  lonely selection. There was a large family, too, of the McLeods, consisting of  several strapping sons growing into manhood, and a number of robust, kindly-natured,  fair-skinned girls. And as the poor parson approached the habitation, he saw  them all grouped outside, with gloomy, downcast expressions on their faces,  watching two men rounding up the few head of milking cows which formed the  nucleus of the prospective dairy herd that they had for many years dreamed of  raising&mdash;and the family&rsquo;s hope and main-spring of support&mdash;and putting them in  the yard to check the brands.</p>
<p>The work of the day was all suspended, and none of the family seemed to  have heart enough to do another hand&rsquo;s turn about the place. The poor parson  greeted them all cheerfully, and in turn they responded with a forced sickly  effort at pleasantry. The girls hung their heads, and the boys pulled their  slouch hats down over their eyes when taking charge of the horse after the  minister had alighted from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope no serious trouble has come to any of you, Mr. McLeod,&rdquo; the minister  said, noticing the gloom that was upon the tanned faces of all. Mrs. McLeod,  with big tears in her kind, motherly eyes, looked at her husband and waited for  him to speak. McLeod hesitated, and the girls moved quietly away and went  inside the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, Mr. McCulloch,&rdquo; the father, with a futile effort to treat  his misfortunes lightly, said; &ldquo;we have a bit of a bother to-day&mdash;we&rsquo;re losing  all the cows, as a matter of fact&mdash;and the horses, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson didn&rsquo;t seem to understand, and stared wonderingly from  Mr. McLeod to the cows as they trooped into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storekeeper has sent the bailiff for them,&rdquo; Mrs. McLeod said; then  covered her face with her apron and sobbed into it.</p>
<p>The poor parson understood, and spoke softly and sympathisingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I would have paid the money,&rdquo; McLeod said; &ldquo;but when a man  hasn&rsquo;t got it, what can he do, Mr. McCulloch?&rdquo; and he lowered his head and  scratched the ground thoughtfully with the toe of his boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; the poor parson replied. &ldquo;I can understand how hard  and disheartening it must be to all of you. I feel it keenly myself, and how  much heavier the misfortune must weigh on you. But don&rsquo;t forget it could be  worse, Mr. McLeod,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;much worse&mdash;and you should thank God your trouble  is only a financial one, which might be retrieved in many ways, and that it is  not a serious illness or the death of a member of your family. For, after all,  the loss of one&rsquo;s worldly possessions is but a minor matter in our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; Mrs. McLeod answered. &ldquo;Look at the poor widow woman, how she  was taken away only the other night! And I&rsquo;m sure that poor girl and boy would  much sooner have lost every stick they had, and gone begging all their lives,  than anything should have happened to their poor mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reference to the death of Mrs. Braddon was too painful for the poor  parson, and he remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; McLeod said slowly; &ldquo;when you look at it that way we&rsquo;re a good  lot better off than we think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls called to their mother to invite Mr. McCulloch in for a cup  of tea. And the bailiff, having finished checking the brands of the stock, rode  across to have a final word with the boys, who were sitting on the ground with  their backs to the barn, brooding over the situation together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could only see <i>three</i> horses,&rdquo; the bailiff said, referring to his note book, and reading out the  descriptions of the animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be <i>five</i>,&rdquo;  Jimmy, the eldest boy, said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you I could only see <i>three</i>,&rdquo;  the bailiff repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was <i>five</i>,&rdquo; Jimmy  insisted in an antagonistic tone, &ldquo;and I can show them to you,&rdquo; and he rose to  his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I always thought a wink was as good as a nod to a blind horse,&rdquo;  the officer said; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m beginning to think a man wants to carry a blackboard  about with him in these parts. I&rsquo;m telling you again that I could only see <i>three of them</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy gradually began to understand the ways of a humane bailiff, and  with an intelligent look on his face drawled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see&mdash;yairs, o&rsquo; course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bailiff said &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; and rode off.</p>
<p>The poor parson, instead of holding prayers, asked for pencil and  paper, and went carefully into the position of McLeod&rsquo;s affairs with him, and  showed how it was still possible to get sufficient credit from a bank to enable  him to buy more cows and make a fresh start. And when he went away in company  with Jimmy, who was to show him a short cut through the ranges to MacLennan&rsquo;s  place, the McLeods brightened up and became hopeful and light-hearted again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter  20<br>
  A Bush Tragedy Averted</b></h2>
<p>Eight miles it was through the ranges to MacLennan&rsquo;s, and from there  the poor parson intended making back to Narralane the following day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was somewhat of an unpleasant incident the last occasion on  which I called at Mr. MacLennan&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; the minister remarked thoughtfully as  the hut came in sight, &ldquo;arising out of an extraordinary misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy smiled, and said, &ldquo;Yairs, we heerd about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister looked quickly and concernedly at Jimmy and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it spoken of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yairs&mdash;a lot o&rsquo; times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what light was it spoken of?&rdquo; with deeper concern. Jimmy looked  puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! just when any o&rsquo; them met, you know&mdash;daytime, I think, mostly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, what was the view they took of the incident&mdash;what was their  account of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy smiled again. Then drawled bashfully, &ldquo;Well&rdquo; (pausing), &ldquo;they  reckoned you&rdquo; (another pause)&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t be right to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson bit his lip, and a troubled, anxious look came into his  face, and he stared at the hut which they were now drawing close to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Archie is not at home just now, though,&rdquo; Jimmy said, in a consoling  sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he not?&rdquo; with a look of fresh concern from the minister. &ldquo;No&mdash;he&rsquo;s  been away for months, at the Burnett gettin&rsquo; sheep for the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does Mrs. MacLennan stay all alone?&rdquo; the minister asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One o&rsquo; me sisters was stayin&rsquo; with her for a while, but she&rsquo;s home  again now, and me mother, I think, is comin&rsquo; over tomorrow or the day after, to  stay with her for a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed through the station gate, and an aged cattle-dog came  whimpering to meet them. The animal sprang up at the heads of the horses, and  clawed the trouser leg of the poor parson; then rushed back to the hut, and  stood whining and wagging its tail at the half open door.</p>
<p>Jimmy, who understood the language of dogs better than he did that of  bailiffs, said apprehensively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something up here; that dog wouldn&rsquo;t go on like that if there  wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And he sprang actively out of the saddle,</p>
<p>The dog disappeared inside, and rushed into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Jimmy knocked on the half-open door, and called out.</p>
<p>There was no reply. He called again.</p>
<p>The dog answered with a loud hollow bark from the bed-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong right enough,&rdquo; Jimmy, with a nervous tremour  in his voice, said to the minister; then boldly entered the house.</p>
<p>The minister, with a look of alarm on his face, followed.</p>
<p>Mrs. MacLennan lay in bed; and through the open bed-room door they saw  the dog standing looking up into her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything the matter, Mrs. MacLennan?&rdquo; Jimmy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; Jimmy gasped. &ldquo;I believe she&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog bounded on to the bed, and stood whimpering over his mistress.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page106.jpg" alt="dog" width="750" height="597"> </p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; Jimmy gasped again, as they both entered the bed-room and  scanned the face of the woman. &ldquo;She <i>is</i> dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson, pale and trembling, lifted the hand that lay stiff and  cold on top of the blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord God! have mercy!&rdquo; he exclaimed, reeling back and putting his hands to his head.</p>
<p>For a while Jimmy stared hopelessly at his companion; then murmured:  &ldquo;What on earth can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord God!&rdquo; the poor parson muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to see if there&rsquo;s been foul play,&rdquo; Jimmy said, and  leaned over the dead woman. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I think&rdquo; (pausing and watching  the woman&rsquo;s face closely), &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister lifted the limp hand again, and felt the pulse long and  anxiously. &ldquo;There is yet life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go you, friend, and tell your people.  I will remain and watch over our sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be terrible for you to do that,&rdquo; Jimmy answered feelingly, &ldquo;for  it will be all night, nearly, before anyone can arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>will</i> be terrible&mdash;duty is  often terrible. But go; do not delay&mdash;and the Lord guide you in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My heavens!</i>&rdquo; Jimmy murmured  as he swung into the saddle. &ldquo;In there all night alone!&rdquo; and his hair rose on  end at the very thoughts of the awful situation, as he galloped through the  darkening timber.</p>
<p>The minister set to and made a fire, and searched the shelves of the  humpy for whatever home remedies they contained, and applied them to the  patient. Then hour after hour went slowly by. The night birds called gloomily  to each other. At one moment they whooped funereally and with the doleful  regularity of a bell tolling for the dead. At another they filled the air with  screams, that sounded like the cries of lost souls in pain. Every now and again  a dingo would &ldquo;Coo-ee&rdquo; mournfully, and, when the echo had died slowly away,  another would answer back. And the dawn was almost breaking when the first  cart, containing McLeod and Mrs. McLeod, rattled over the loose stones, and  passed through the gate.</p>
<p>Catching the sound of the minister&rsquo;s voice within, McLeod, as he  stepped on to the rough, boarded verandah, placed his hand on his wife&rsquo;s arm,  and they both paused and listened.</p>
<p>In deep, solemn tones came the words: &ldquo;<i>Our Father, who art in heaven: Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily  bread. And forgive our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into  temptation: but deliver us from evil: for thine is the kingdom, the power, and  the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stewarts later entered the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; the minister murmured, and, spreading his arms on the  rude table at which he was sitting, rested his head on them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stewart took charge of the patient, and administered a little  brandy to her, and an hour or so after, and just when the doctor arrived, there  were sure signs of recovery. By the afternoon she opened her eyes, and murmured  things to those about her.</p>
<p>And, later in the day, as the poor parson returned slowly towards  Narralane, he was met by a bearded tan-faced drover, leading a pack-horse and  riding along at a swinging pace. The horseman steadied his speed when  approaching, and respectfully moved his hat. But the minister didn&rsquo;t remember  Archie MacLennan, and they both passed on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter  21<br>
  A Fresh Misfortune</b></h2>
<p>A fresh misfortune was upon the Narralane congregation. A storm had  swept over the country and carried away the church. And it was the only  building in the district that it had carried away&mdash;not even a barn, or the  frailest old bark humpy in the district had been affected by that hurricane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I canna understan&rsquo; it at a&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duncan McClure said, gazing in solemn  wonder upon the sacred ruins of the fallen edifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor me,&rdquo; Bailey, the storekeeper, sighed, shaking his head</p>
<p>Neither could the poor parson. He stood and stared dejectedly at the  catastrophe in silent amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, m-m-m-man proposes,&rdquo; Bill Eaglefoot said, closing his eyes and  shaking his head spasmodically, &ldquo;but the Lul-Lul-Lul-L-Lord disposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment Bailey seemed to entertain doubts as to the reverence of  Bill&rsquo;s observation, and closely watched to see how it would be regarded by the  parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, friend,&rdquo; the parson said, bestowing a soft look of approval on  the ragged, useless-looking reprobate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never said a truer word in your life,  then,&rdquo; Bailey promptly said, patronisingly, to Bill, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t the only true  word that ever y&rsquo; did say,&rdquo; and he turned his eyes on the others assembled  round the debris, like mourners at a grave, and he turned his eyes on the  others assembled round the d&eacute;bris, like mourners at a grave, and chuckled  ignorantly. </p>
<p>Bill, who, upon being complimented by the poor parson, felt like  walking on air, now suddenly took umbrage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose y-y-you think,&rdquo; he snapped, stepping off the end of the  damaged pulpit, upon which he had been standing with both feet, and looking  Bailey, the elder of the church, right between the two eyes, &ldquo;that that&rsquo;s  m-m-my own ph&rsquo;losophy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was philosophy, Bill,&rdquo; Bailey replied, grinning at  the others again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, o&rsquo; course y-y-y-you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bill sneered, mounting the end of the  broken pulpit again. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t s-s-s-suppose you ever heard o&rsquo;  Bub-Bub-Bub-acon, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bacon!&rdquo; Bailey chuckled; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eaten plenty of it,&rdquo; and laughed at his  own greasy joke, until the others, to Bill&rsquo;s discomfiture, joined in the  merriment.</p>
<p>Bill shuffled his feet nervously, and bit his lip, and scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hae ye ever heard o&rsquo; Robbie Burns?&rdquo; Duncan McClure asked, stepping  forward and fixing his twinkling grey eyes on Bill in a defiant sort of way.</p>
<p>The parson smiled amusedly at Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dinna mean you, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan put in quickly, as though  anticipating the minister meant to assist Eaglefoot by disclosing the identity  of the Scottish poet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; Bill the question, seein&rsquo; he seems to ken sic  a deil o&rsquo; a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning to Bill again, &ldquo;Hae ye ever heard o&rsquo; Robbie Burns?&rdquo; And  Duncan glared as though he had Bill in a tight place.</p>
<p>The others grinned in favour of Duncan.</p>
<p>Bill, in sheer disgust, turned his face away, and looked across the  landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kenned he hadna,&rdquo; Duncan concluded triumphantly. Then, placing his  heavy foot on Bill&rsquo;s instep to attract his attention again, said: &ldquo;Hae ye ever  heard this before?&rdquo; And, in a broad, sing-song voice, he proceeded to recite:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;O, ken ye hoo Meg o&rsquo; the Mill was mairrit?<br>
  O, ken ye hoo Meg o&rsquo; the Mill was mairrit?<br>
The priest he was oxter&rsquo;d, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan paused and tried to think, but couldn&rsquo;t remember any more.</p>
<p>There was a loud laugh. The poor parson smiled at Duncan and walked  away, and Duncan mopped his brow laboriously and looked triumphantly at Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Bill said, turning on Duncan, &ldquo;that th-th-ing was old a  hundred years before Bub-Bub-Bub-ums was bub-bub-orn.&rdquo; And he stepped off the  battered pulpit and went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puir Bill,&rdquo; Duncan said, rejoining the minister, &ldquo;his skull&rsquo;s a wee  bit crackit, pairrson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the rebuilding of the church was all that was on the parson&rsquo;s mind.  He invited those around him to the shade of a tree, and placed the serious  aspect of the situation before them. After consulting for an hour they decided  to hold service one night during the week at &ldquo;Loch Ness,&rdquo; and, at the  conclusion of it, the church committee would meet and &ldquo;do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was down, and the shades of evening were stealing silently over  the great Bushland. At &ldquo;Loch Ness&rdquo; the last can of milk was emptied at the  dairy; the cows were sauntering in twos and threes from the yard; the plough  horses, still wet with sweat, ravenously feeding from the nose-bags; while  across in the mountain hollow the jackasses were laughing in mocking refrain at  the departing day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys reckon they can see the auld pairrson comin&rsquo; roond the corner  o&rsquo; the paddock, but I&rsquo;m hanged if I can, Vi!&rdquo; Duncan McClure said, as he  reached the kitchen and proceeded to wash his face and large, brown arms in a  capacious tin dish of water that stood on a wooden bench beside the door.</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure hurried into the front room, which had been reserved for  the holding of the service, to see that everything was in order and to put the  cards away. Then she returned to the kitchen and started laying the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to tak&rsquo; supper in the kitchen th&rsquo; nicht, Vi,&rdquo;  Duncan went on, squeezing water from his whiskers and rubbing his face hard with  a coarse towel.</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure hoped the minister &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be th&rsquo; hokey, he&rsquo;ll have to like it, Vi!&rdquo; came from Duncan in loud  good-natured tones. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no a bit better than the rest o&rsquo; us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shouldna speak so disrespectfou, Duncan,&rdquo; Mrs. McClure said, flying  about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the meenister should receive more consideration than common  folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that, Vi,&rdquo; Duncan called at the top of his voice. &ldquo;And  if I was an auld pairrson mysel&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. McClure,&rdquo; came, in soft, silky tones, from the edge  of the kitchen verandah.</p>
<p>Duncan looked round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By joves!&rdquo; he shouted delightedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beggared, it&rsquo;s Mr. McCulloch  himsel&rsquo;! We were jist talkin&rsquo; about ye, pairrson; and hoo are y&rsquo; gettin&rsquo;  along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson smiled and said he was getting along very well. Then he  mounted the verandah and shook hands with Duncan and with Mrs. McClure, who  came from the kitchen with her homely-looking face radiant with smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hae ye done wi&rsquo; your horse?&rdquo; Duncan inquired, seeing the minister  had appeared without the quadruped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your man took charge of him at the yard gate for me,&rdquo; the other  replied.</p>
<p>Duncan looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auld Bill, was it?&rdquo; he asked out of curiosity.</p>
<p>The parson smiled, and said it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel,&rdquo; Duncan drawled. &ldquo;Fancy that, Vi! The auld sinner! I didna  think he had sae much intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson spoke up for Bill, and paid him several compliments upon his  usefulness as a groom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to the service the nicht, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said in a  hushed voice and with an amused look in his face.</p>
<p>The parson was pleased to hear of Bill&rsquo;s good resolution, and related  an instance that he knew of respecting a hardened criminal who had been  reclaimed by the church and lived a good Christian life ever after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s been tellin&rsquo; the boys, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan  drawled. &ldquo;But I think, mesel&rsquo;, the auld deil &rsquo;ll sneak oot o&rsquo;t as soon as he  gets a skinfou o&rsquo; grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he lifted the tin dish he had sluiced himself in, and, turning  round, heaved the water over the verandah, just as Bill, in search of his  supper, hobbled round the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, man!&rdquo; Duncan exclaimed, apologetically, on seeing the contents  of the dish go over Bill and wash his hat off.</p>
<p>Bill threw up both hands and gasped for breath.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page113.jpg" alt="bill" width="482" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; the parson muttered pityingly, turning his eyes on Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didna see y&rsquo; comin&rsquo;, man.&rdquo; Duncan chuckled amusedly at the drenched  reprobate. &ldquo;I didna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, y&rsquo; mighter taken th&rsquo; soap out of it!&rdquo; Bill stammered in injured  tones, as he rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>Duncan&rsquo;s features instantly relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h!&rdquo; he said, leaning over the edge of the verandah, and peering  concernedly at the ground about Eaglefoot&rsquo;s feet,. where the lump of yellow  soap lay. &ldquo;Han&rsquo; it back, han&rsquo; it back, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shook the water off himself like a dog, and stooped and handed  Duncan back the soap. Duncan replaced it in the dish, then turned to the  parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was gaun tae ask ye, when a&rsquo; that happened, if ye would care to hae  a wash yoursel&rsquo;, pairrson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson had remembered the day had been excessively hot, and thought  he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a wee till I fill the dish for ye.&rdquo; And Duncan tripped off to the  tank, and returned with the dish brimming over.</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why could ye no tak&rsquo; Mr. McCulloch into the bedroom to wash himself,  Duncan?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The parson smilingly assured Mrs. McClure that he would sooner wash in  the tin dish, and, removing his coat, carefully rolled up his limp and soiled  shirt cuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a lot better, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said, with an air of  assurance; &ldquo;for ye canna wash a&rsquo; the dirt aff yoursel&rsquo; in a bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister lifted the soap and began his ablutions with a graceful  action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stan&rsquo; away back frae it, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;and poke your heid  richt under; it&rsquo;ll cool ye after a&rsquo; the heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure scowled at her voluble husband, to silence him; then she  suggested that he proceed with the carving while the others were getting ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo; richt, Vi!&rdquo; Duncan answered boisterously, taking his place at the  head of the kitchen table, and proceeding to slash into the round of corned  beef which had just been lifted steaming hot from the pot; and, when he had  filled every available plate, called out loud enough to be heard at the barn:  &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d better come noo, all o&rsquo; ye, an&rsquo; tak&rsquo; your seats afore the grub gets  cauld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill Eaglefoot was first to respond. Bill always believed in  promptitude at meal-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bill,&rdquo; Duncan said, with a good-humoured grin; &ldquo;had ye tae  change your shirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Bill growled. &ldquo;But I w-w-ould have if I h-h-had another to p-p-p-put  on.&rdquo; And, squeezing himself into a seat behind the large family teapot, he  commenced his meal right away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Mr. McCulloch,&rdquo; Mrs. McClure called out, and the minister  entered, and was given a seat on Duncan&rsquo;s right hand. Then came the young  McClures and the two ploughmen, who hesitated at the door and looked nervous in  the presence of the Church.</p>
<p>Duncan turned to the minister:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, mon!&rdquo; he exclaimed in admiration, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s made a great change in  ye, pairrson,&rdquo; and the minister smiled feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duncan!&rdquo; Mrs. McClure said, speaking from the bottom of the table. &ldquo;Ye  shouldna pass remarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the company smiled, and stole sly glances at the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a difference, richt eneuf,&rdquo; Duncan insisted stubbornly.  &ldquo;An&rsquo; do ye no feel it yersel&rsquo;, pairrson?&rdquo; he asked, appealing to the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ever ye hear sic a man?&rdquo; Mrs. McClure said to Bill, who was  sitting handy to her at the table.</p>
<p>But Duncan wasn&rsquo;t to be interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These hot days, ye ken,&rdquo; he continued, by way of explanation, &ldquo;a man  perspires a deil o&rsquo; a lot, an&rsquo; the dust a&rsquo; gets on ye, and after ye hae a wash  and get it a&rsquo; aff, ye feel like anither fella&mdash;ye dae, don&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; and he looked  at one of the ploughmen for confirmation. But the ploughman had no wish to be drawn  into conversation at the table, and only grinned and looked away.</p>
<p>Duncan, after a pause, turned to the minister again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t suppose <i>ye</i> sweat  very much, dae ye, pairrson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duncan! Duncan!&rdquo; Mrs. McClure cried again, and Eaglefoot, in the act  of putting a potato into his mouth, changed his mind, and, dropping his fork,  broke into a low, audible chuckle. The others followed his example.</p>
<p>Duncan put down the carver. &ldquo;Ask a blessin&rsquo;, pairrson,&rdquo; he said in  solemn tones.</p>
<p>The minister bowed his head and said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;For what we are about to  receive the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Old Bill, who had been eating all through the piece, looked from one to  the other with a half-shamed expression on his face.</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure, noticing his discomfiture, leaned over the corner of the  table and whispered, &ldquo;It doesna matter.&rdquo; And Bill took fresh courage and began  the meal all over again.</p>
<p>It was a quiet, uneventful repast. No one but Duncan and the parson  conversed, and as the others finished they rose and shoved their seats back  against the wall, and sat there stiff-backed, telling each other in turn that  it had been a lot hotter that day than the day before.</p>
<p>An hour later the dogs started barking, and the sound of voices and the  tramping of horses were heard in the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re beginning to come,&rdquo; someone said, and Bill and the ploughmen,  glad of an excuse, rose and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we had better licht up the kirk,&rdquo; Duncan said to Mrs.  McClure, then went off to the sittingroom, where some chairs and the side-boards  and tail-boards of drays, resting on gin-cases, awaited the congregation.</p>
<p>After Bailey and some more of the elders supervised matters, and  readjusted the seats, and Mrs. McClure had explored the kitchen for an extra  candle or two, the minister entered and took his seat behind a little table  which served as a pulpit. Then the weird, heavily-booted congregation trooped  into the dimly-lighted room, and, taking their seats nervously, sat staring  expectantly at their pastor.</p>
<p>Duncan McClure gazed all round the room, and turned and looked to see  who was sitting behind him, then leaned across to his son Peter, and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dinna see that auld deil, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter smiled and shook his head sceptically. Peter was a nonbeliever  where Bill was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gang oot, Peter,&rdquo; Duncan whispered again, &ldquo;and ask him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter rose and went out. But Bill was not about. Bill was on his way to  Charley Jorgens&rsquo;s place, on the parson&rsquo;s horse. Charley Jorgens was a  particular friend of Bill&rsquo;s and owned a horse and dray with which he used to  make a living collecting dead bones and things that other people didn&rsquo;t take  any interest in. And sometimes he collected things that other people took a lot  of interest in.</p>
<p>Peter returned, and, taking his seat again, shook his head in the  negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leein&rsquo; auld deil!&rdquo; Duncan whispered in condemnation of Bill; then  turned his attention to the parson.</p>
<p>The poor parson was not an eloquent preacher, but he was earnest and  impressive, and his words held the congregation in rapt attention. They all sat  motionless, their eyes rivetted solemnly to the floor, listening intently.</p>
<p>The parson proceeded to outline the steps and stages of a criminal&rsquo;s  life. On the left-hand wall of the room he pointed in an imaginary way to the  infant in its mother&rsquo;s arms, and, in touching tones, said, &ldquo;Innocence.&rdquo; On the  right he pointed to the criminal in chains, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Guilt.&rdquo; Tears came  from the women&rsquo;s eyes, and the men exhibited restlessness.</p>
<p>The parson, in emphasis, struck the open Bible that lay before him on  the improvised pulpit, and a nest of startled cockroaches, glossy-backed,  well-fed and full-whiskered, unexpectedly fell from the table. The vermin raced  across the floor; but, when Mary Archibald gave a start and moved her skirts,  they wheeled in irregular order, and scampered towards Duncan McClure. Duncan,  who hadn&rsquo;t noticed them at first, suddenly opened his eyes and moved his foot.  The cockroaches turned again and raced back under cover of the table, where  they remained together, shouldering each other about and blinking at the  audience.</p>
<p>The congregation grinned, and Bill Andrews nudged Tom Smith. Tom Smith  struggled to retain his composure. Mary McBrown raised her eyes meaningly to  her mother, and they both turned red, and took out their handkerchiefs and  coughed into them. When they coughed, the cockroaches started nervously, and  seemed inclined to scatter, but took courage and settled down again, and  blinked more and more at the congregation.</p>
<p>Willie Smith nudged old Macfarlane; old Macfarlane turned his head  slowly, and, scowling at Willie, whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;Hae some sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The congregation seemed to lose interest in the sermon altogether;  their minds were all on the cockroaches. Presently the parson thumped the table  again, and added a new interest to the proceedings.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Jack of Hearts,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;King of Clubs,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Ace of Spades,&rdquo;  and the &ldquo;Queen of Diamonds,&rdquo; followed by a number of &ldquo;rags,&rdquo; dropped out of  some part of it and fell on the backs of the unsuspecting vermin.</p>
<p>All but one scattered suddenly. The one remained concealed under the  &ldquo;Ace of Spades&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Queen of Diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-h!&rdquo; Mary McBrown whimpered, involuntarily, as some of the vermin  arrived hurriedly at her feet. Her mother pinched her to silence her; then they  both made a choking noise and smothered their mirth. But Bill Thompson, from  the opposite side of the room, laughed outright, and, rising clumsily, made for  the door.</p>
<p>The parson paused for a moment and stared at Bill; then continued his  sermon without remark.</p>
<p>The congregation settled down, and were becoming absorbed again in the  minister&rsquo;s words, when the &ldquo;Ace of Hearts&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Queen of Diamonds,&rdquo;  balanced across each other, began to show signs of animation, and moved slowly  across the floor towards Mrs. McClure.</p>
<p>The congregation lost its solemnity altogether, and made a noise like  geese. The parson stopped abruptly, and eyed them warningly.</p>
<p>Duncan McClure glared at them and shook his head, then chuckled  himself.</p>
<p>The poor parson, with a dark look on his face, gave out the next  hymn&mdash;and saved the situation.</p>
<p>The congregation made a great noise finding the place in their hymn  books, and, rising hurriedly, sang and laughed in the same key.</p>
<p>The service ended; and Duncan McClure apologised to the minister for  the unseemly merriment of the congregation. Then the Church Committee took  possession of the room. On McClure&rsquo;s suggestion, they decided to rebuild the  church with their own labour, and to put the first nail in it the following  morning. Then they shook hands with the parson and with one another, and went  home.</p>
<p>Next morning the committee met at the appointed hour, each burdened  with some portion or other of a carpenter&rsquo;s kit. But they didn&rsquo;t make a start  on the church. There was no church to start on. It had all disappeared in the  night.</p>
<p>And when Duncan McClure returned home, he found Bill Eaglefoot had  disappeared, too.</p>
<p>Bill was helping Charley Jorgens to build a new house.</p>

  Bailey and the Morrows</b></h2>
<p>The Morrows were poor North of Ireland people, and lived on a selection  at the Grass Tree.</p>
<p>The selection was poor, too, and the Morrows had lived on it for  five-and-twenty years. Altogether they had ten children, nine of whom were  boys&mdash;the other was a girl. A kind, good-hearted girl, too, was Dulcie Morrow.  She was also pleasant and good-looking&mdash;so good-looking that everyone used to  draw comparisons between her and old Morrow. No one was able to see any  resemblance&mdash;no one except old Tom Hanihan, who was so blind that when he rode  out to look for cows, he had to take one of his boys behind him on the saddle  to see them for him.</p>
<p>The house the Morrows lived in was a four-roomed one covered with bark,  and walled in with bark, and the spouting that was round it, and which reached  within a couple of feet of the hole in the water-cask, was made of bark, too;  and the verandah flooring was all bark; and the outside fireplace, where  cooking could never be done, was built of bark, except one side of it, which  was a bag; and the old dog that always slept about the place, and never took  any notice of strangers, was called Bark. There was also a capacious barn made  of bark, nearly always empty; and finally, there were a couple of horses and a  few head of cattle on the selection, and a mortgage&mdash;not made of bark. And that  was about all the Morrows possessed, except a good deal of faith and hope, and  it was the hope that kept them happy. </p>
<p>The scant meal of stringy salt beef and dry bread and boiled pumpkin  was over, and it was night at Morrow&rsquo;s selection.</p>
<p>Inside, Dulcie lay dressed on her bed in the skillion room, burning a  smellsome, old, slush lamp, and by the dim light of it pouring over the  tattered pages of a copy of &ldquo;Fair Girls and Grey Horses&rdquo;&mdash;a copy given her one  day by a passing drover in exchange for a billy of hot water. On the rude sofa  in the front room, two of the youngest boys, tired out after a day in the  paddock cutting dead cornstalks, lay coiled up, one at each end.</p>
<p>Outside, the old couple sat on the verandah in silent, gloomy  contemplation. There was scarcely a sound, save the tramp, tramp, of one of the  old horses as it moved wearily about cropping the couch grass in the yard. Owls  flew round silently; the stars came out in clusters, and blinked and blinked.  To the west, the faintest flicker of a fire located MacPherson&rsquo;s place some two  miles off, under the brow of a ridge. To the east, a silvery streak appeared in  the sky, and broadened till the great round moon blazed up over the tree tops;  and the fences took shape, and the big, dead trees in the lane stood out like  ghosts, extending their shadowy arms to feel their way through the dimness.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Morrow spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Danny,&rdquo; she said, sorrowfully; &ldquo;he tells me in his letter they  have only had a fortnit&rsquo;s work between them since they went away in June, and  they&rsquo;ve no money yet to send. And Jimmy, he lost his horse swimmin&rsquo; a crick,  and he thinks they&rsquo;ll be coming home again if they dersent soon fall into  something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they can do no good here,&rdquo; her husband growled; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing  here for anyone; and if they can&rsquo;t soon send something to give the storekeeper,  I am sure I don&rsquo;t know what is going to happen,&rdquo; and he rose and walked up and  down the verandah. &ldquo;There will be no corn,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;not a bally cob!&rdquo;  Then, breaking off, he stopped short in front of his wife, and, leaning down  and looking into her face, hissed savagely, &ldquo;And has that girl made up her mind  yet? Is Dulcie going to take Bailey&rsquo;s son while she has the chance, and do  something to lift us all out of this infernal life, or is she still thinking of  that young Dawson, who hasn&rsquo;t a hair on his lip nor a shirt to his back any  more than she has herself? Now, I want to know what she&rsquo;s going to do, for  Bailey will be here to-night for settlement of his bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl is as determined as yourself, John,&rdquo; his wife replied; &ldquo;and,  whatever else she might do, I am afraid she won&rsquo;t marry Willie Bailey, no  matter how rich his father means to make him. And no one can blame her, perhaps;  for what girl would like to be tied to a man who&rsquo;s a cripple and half an  idiot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> want her to be,&rdquo;  Morrow thundered; &ldquo;and mightn&rsquo;t she as well be tied to him as anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be&mdash;but &rsquo;tis for herself to say, I think,&rdquo; the woman answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for <i>me</i>,&rdquo; from Morrow,  angrily.</p>
<p>Dulcie, who had left her room, and was standing listening at the door,  sighed anxiously, and bit her lip resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, very well; I don&rsquo;t wish to interfere,&rdquo; and Mrs. Morrow  remained silent and stared out into the moonlight.</p>
<p>A horseman rode in through the open slip-rails, and a voice called out,  &ldquo;Are you at home, Morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hello!&rdquo; Morrow cheerfully answered, stepping off the verandah;  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Mr. Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then both he and Mrs. Morrow welcomed the visitor warmly, and invited  him inside, where Mrs. Morrow apologised for the poorness of the furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Bailey said lightly. &ldquo;Wait till your husband  makes his fortune, Mrs. Morrow, and you&rsquo;ll be able to stock your house with  everything of the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when he does, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; Bailey interrupted, &ldquo;when your daughter marries that son of  mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it,&rdquo; Morrow put in; but Mrs. Morrow dropped her eyes  on the table, and played thoughtfully with some bread-crumbs that were  scattered there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I forgot to ask you how Dulcie is,&rdquo; Bailey went on, noticing the  girl was not present.</p>
<p>Morrow said she was &ldquo;fine,&rdquo; and Mrs. Morrow called for her daughter to  come and see Mr. Bailey.</p>
<p>But there was no response from Dulcie.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morrow rose and went to her daughter&rsquo;s room. The slush lamp was  still burning in its place, but Dulcie was not there.</p>
<p>The mother went to the back door, and called out several times without  receiving an answer. Then she returned to the front room with an anxious look  on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on with you; she <i>must</i> be  about,&rdquo; Morrow growled irritably, and, rising, went outside and bellowed &ldquo;<i>Dulcie!</i>&rdquo; in a variety of keys, and loud  enough to be heard on the other side of the range. Yet there was no answer.</p>
<p>Then a search, in which Bailey took part, was started inside and  outside the house; but twelve o&rsquo;clock came, and no trace had been discovered of  Dulcie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devilish strange!&rdquo; Bailey murmured, mounting his horse and riding  away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said, from under the bedclothes, &ldquo;I hear someone  knocking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson woke out of a deep sleep, and, sitting up in bed,  listened.</p>
<p>He heard a voice, which seemed to be in distress, call him by name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone, Jean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whoever can it be at such an hour,  for it&rsquo;s near morning!&rdquo; And, getting out of bed he partially dressed himself  and went to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; he exclaimed, when the light of the lamp he held in his  hand revealed the face of Dulcie Morrow. &ldquo;Whatever is amiss, Dulcie?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page125.jpg" alt="dulcie" width="511" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Dulcie burst into tears, and between her broken sobs said, &ldquo;Oh, Mr.  McCulloch, I&rsquo;m in trouble! I&rsquo;ve run away from father, and&mdash;and&mdash;and I want you  and Mrs. McCulloch to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! dear me! Come inside, my poor girl!&rdquo; the minister said,  taking her by the arm, &ldquo;and sit down and calm yourself; then tell me what is  the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dulcie, her hat all askew, and her skirts full of grass seed and wet  with dew, sat down, and, in a fresh burst of tears, lost control of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; the minister murmured, hurrying back to his bed-room to  acquaint his wife. But Mrs. McCulloch, who was in Dulcie&rsquo;s confidence, had  recognised the girl&rsquo;s voice, and was already throwing a wrapper over herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever has happened, Dulcie?&rdquo; she asked anxiously, entering the  sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bailey ca-ca-came,&rdquo; Dulcie sobbed, &ldquo;to our pl-pl-place, and  fa-fa-father was again going to try and mak-mak-make me marry Wi-Wi-Willie  Bailey, and I&mdash;I ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you did right to come to us, Dulcie,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said, sitting  beside the weeping girl and putting her arms about her. &ldquo;The brutes!&rdquo; she went  on. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry to think ill of your father; but Bailey was always a bad  man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand such conduct!&rdquo; the poor parson said, indignantly;  &ldquo;and it shall not be carried further&mdash;it shall not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch added, caressing Dulcie; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve come  all these miles alone this night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no further fear,&rdquo; from the minister; &ldquo;just comfort yourself, and  I will protect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to his wife, &ldquo;And, maybe, Jean, it would be well if we made a  fire and prepared her a cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dulcie struggled to speak, but was too overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch murmured, removing the unhappy girl&rsquo;s hat  for her and gently smoothing her hair; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mind them; just quiet yourself  while I get the tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jessie, who had been awakened and overhead all, came dressed from  her room, and said kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. McCulloch, you stay with Dulcie, and I&rsquo;ll get the tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Dulcie had taken the tea, and was calm again, Jessie in a  sisterly way took charge of her, and before dawn had broken they were both  comfortably in bed, receiving each other&rsquo;s confidences and weeping softly in  each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Next morning the minister sent a message to Duncan McClure, and that  afternoon Duncan arrived at the Manse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bailey was always a scoundrel,&rdquo; he said, angrily, when the poor parson  explained Dulcie&rsquo;s situation to him; &ldquo;an&rsquo; shouldna be an elder o&rsquo; anything. The  villain! to try an&rsquo; force yon halfwitted cripple o&rsquo; a son o&rsquo; his upon a guid  lassie like Dulcie, because he happened to haud her faither in his grip&mdash;an&rsquo;  against her will, too, pairrson. Th&rsquo; crawlin&rsquo; bleckguard! Why, I wouldna  permeet Black Luzzie to be mated wi&rsquo; sic a misfit body&mdash;&rsquo;twould deteriorate  posterity, so it would. Why, the man must ha&rsquo; th&rsquo; vera deil in him to think o&rsquo;  sic a diabolical ac&rsquo;. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve a mind tae gang to his hoose this vera meenit  an&rsquo; charge him wi&rsquo; it a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Duncan was suddenly saved the journey by the unexpected appearance  of Bailey at the garden gate of the Manse.</p>
<p>The poor parson, as Bailey calmly closed the gate and approached the  door, whispered to his wife and the two girls &ldquo;not to say anything,&rdquo; and warned  Duncan, who squared his shoulders and fixed his eyes on Bailey, &ldquo;not to lose  his temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bailey,&rdquo; Duncan said, before the other had time to speak; &ldquo;for  twa pins I would greet ye wi&rsquo; heavin&rsquo; ye oot ower yon palin&rsquo;s, a reception that  should a&rsquo; been gi&rsquo;en to the first deil, wha entered the garden o&rsquo; Eden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! it&rsquo;s <i>you</i>, McClure,&rdquo;  Bailey said, affecting indifference. &ldquo;Is Mr. McCulloch about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is aboot.&rdquo; Duncan answered, stepping aside to allow some of the  poor parson to be seen. &ldquo;An&rsquo; so is Mrs. McCulloch, and so is Jessie Braddon,  and so is Dulcie Morrow, Bailey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>she&rsquo;s</i> here,&rdquo; Bailey  said, feigning to look pleased, and addressing the minister; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just what  I&rsquo;ve come about. Her father and mother and everyone over our way have been  hunting high and low for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bailey!&rdquo; Duncan burst out, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re a leein&rsquo; skunk! &rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson held up his hands disapprovingly, and interrupted  Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, McClure,&rdquo; Bailey began calmly, his eyes flashing slightly  despite his assumed indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Bailey,&rdquo; Duncan interrupted boisterously, &ldquo;for peersecutin&rsquo;  a puir, innocent, guid lassie by squeezin&rsquo; her debt-ridden faither to force him  tae mak&rsquo; her consaint tae a union wi&rsquo; your cripple, crack-brain o&rsquo; a son, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;McClure! McClure! be silent!&rdquo; the poor parson cried, placing his hand  on Duncan&rsquo;s arm to restrain him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By&mdash;, I&rsquo;ll make you prove this!&rdquo; Bailey shouted, suddenly losing his  temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, that <i>will</i> I, then,&rdquo;  Duncan snarled naively, gently brushing the minister to one side. &ldquo;An&rsquo; dae ye  wish to be confronted wi&rsquo; the complainant hersel&rsquo;, Mister Bailey?&rdquo; And Duncan  looked over his shoulder at Dulcie, who was standing resolutely between her two  friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens! I&rsquo;ll make you prove this, McClure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ye be confronted wi&rsquo; the lassie hersel&rsquo;?&rdquo; and Duncan shoved his  big, hairy face close to Bailey&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page128.jpg" alt="hairy" width="501" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you prove all this,&rdquo; Bailey said again, and turned and  hurried out the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nae in a hurry tae hae it proved, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duncan said,  turning to the others, whose faces wore looks of relief. &ldquo;Being sic a cur, o&rsquo;  course he wouldna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the minister and Duncan settled down on the verandah to calmly  discuss Dulcie&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go wi&rsquo; ye,&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;tae see John Morrow. I canna understan&rsquo;  John. He is not at a&rsquo; a bad man, pairrson, but wi&rsquo; his cares an&rsquo; losses his  mind must hae become distrackit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, accompanied by McGure, the minister set out right away for Morrow&rsquo;s  place at the Grass Tree.</p>
<p>It was drawing towards sunset when they arrived there, and, as they  approached the slip-rails, Bailey unexpectedly passed out through them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bailey!&rdquo; Duncan called to him. &ldquo;We would baith be vera pleased  by ye&rsquo;re remainin&rsquo; a wee, to hear what we hae come to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bailey was in a sullen mood, and rode on without making answer.</p>
<p>Morrow, with a downcast look on his face, came from the house, and was  followed by his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Mrs. Morrow!&rdquo; Duncan shouted cheerfully. &ldquo;Hae ye had ye&rsquo;re tea  yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after alighting and giving his hand to Morrow, &ldquo;John, we&rsquo;ve heard  a&rsquo; aboot this business wi&rsquo; Bailey, an&rsquo; th&rsquo; meenister&rsquo;s come ower o&rsquo; purpose tae  gie ye a deil o&rsquo; a talkin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morrow began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to deny it,&rdquo; Morrow said bitterly, addressing the poor  parson. (&ldquo;I knew he wouldna,&rdquo; put in Duncan.) &ldquo;But why I wanted to act as I did  I&rsquo;m dashed if I can tell you&mdash;there!&rdquo; and he hung his head in remorseful  silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it was a&rsquo; because o&rsquo; the crawler pressin&rsquo; for settlement o&rsquo;  his bill?&rdquo; Duncan suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it must have been,&rdquo; Morrow mumbled sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, an&rsquo; there was never any call for it, John,&rdquo; McClure went on; &ldquo;for  ye were never the kin&rsquo; o&rsquo; man that I wouldna mesel&rsquo; hae rendered assistance  tae, an&rsquo; I tell ye noo that it horrified me when I heard tell o&rsquo; how ye wanted  to marry a guid lassie like Dulcie to that cripple o&rsquo; a Bailey in preference to  Danny Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Morrow sobbed loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, man,&rdquo; Duncan continued, forgetting it was the poor parson who had  come to do the talking, &ldquo;ye ought tae ha&rsquo; been prood to get sic an honest,  hard-workin&rsquo; lad as Danny Dawson tae tak&rsquo; her. I wouldna gie him for a&rsquo; the men  that ever worked at &lsquo;Loch Ness,&rsquo; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be prood mysel&rsquo; for him tae ask me for  ony o&rsquo; my dochters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more, McClure,&rdquo; Morrow mumbled; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough, and  whatever I&rsquo;ve got Bailey can take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; naethin&rsquo; frae ye, John; I&rsquo;ve eneuf confidence in ye to gi&rsquo;  my han&rsquo; on that,&rdquo; and Duncan extended his big, hard hand to Morrow, who took it  in silence.</p>
<p>Then the poor parson, in Dulcie&rsquo;s interests, spoke kindly and advisedly  to the Morrows, and, having promised that Mrs. McCulloch would drive the girl  home in the trap the next day, he and Duncan took leave of them and started  home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Poor Parson Takes an Outing</b></h2>
<p>Breakfast was just over when Duncan McClure, dressed in his best suit,  drove up to the door of the Manse in his trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely morning, Mr. McClure,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said, greeting him  from the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; Duncan answered, touching his hat; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a braw mornin&rsquo; after a&rsquo;  th&rsquo; dour days we&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister, recognising Duncan&rsquo;s boisterous voice, came to the door  with a smile on his face, and a roll of manuscript in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ca&rsquo;ed to tak&rsquo; ye oot o&rsquo; yer den for the day, pairrson, an&rsquo; gie ye  an airin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duncan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all the day?&rdquo; the minister answered thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, for a&rsquo; th&rsquo; day, till the sale is ower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister didn&rsquo;t seem to know anything about a sale. &ldquo;The big lan&rsquo;  auction. A&rsquo; th&rsquo; Grass-Tree estate is to be sell&rsquo;t in sma&rsquo; blocks th&rsquo; day,&rdquo;  Duncan explained, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; biddin&rsquo; for a bit for Peter if it doesna  rin intae too high a feegur. Sae get ye ready, an&rsquo; come alang. It&rsquo;ll dae ye  guid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the minister answered slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very good of you.&rdquo; Then,  turning to his wife, &ldquo;But I have my sermon to prepare for next&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh, dang it!&rdquo; Duncan interrupted, &ldquo;what maitters the sermon for ance  in a way, pairrson? Can you no gie them an auld ane? Deil a ane o&rsquo; them would  remember any o&rsquo;t. I wouldna mysel&rsquo;, vera often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch burst into a cheerful laugh, and, playfully touching her  husband under the chin, said, &ldquo;John, Mr. McClure has paid you a fine  compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan, with a serious look on his face, stared wonderingly at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if my sermons have so little effect as that, Mr. McClure,&rdquo;  the poor parson said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dang it!&rdquo; Duncan exclaimed; &ldquo;I didna mean sic a disparagement. The  sermons, ye ken, micht dae them a&rsquo; lot o&rsquo; guid, an&rsquo; mak&rsquo; them think o&rsquo; their  sins like the vera deil, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; that, but they wouldna remember the exack  words, ye ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister in a pacifying way assured Duncan that he &ldquo;kenned&rdquo; well no  offence was meant, but Mrs. McCulloch still continued to enjoy the situation,  and Duncan added gravely, &ldquo;Oh, I wouldna, pairrson, I wouldna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the minister, looking at his wife, again said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I could afford the day, Jean?&rdquo; And Jean, feeling sure he could,  urged him to join Duncan and take the full benefit of the outing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a deuce o&rsquo; a big crowd there,&rdquo; Duncan put in  enthusiastically, &ldquo;and you ought to get maitter by it, pairrson, to write  sairmons out o&rsquo; for a&rsquo; the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister smiled, and went off to his room to get ready. &ldquo;Why, I  quite forgot to ask if you have had breakfast, Mr. McClure,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch  said, apologetically.</p>
<p>Duncan&rsquo;s eyes twinkled like two stars, and a broad smile came over his  face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma certie, I deed that!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been lauchin&rsquo; to  mysel&rsquo; aboot it ever since. I hed it at Bailey&rsquo;s. The auld rrascal yelled out  to me when I was passin&rsquo; his place, an&rsquo; I got oot o&rsquo; th&rsquo; trap; an&rsquo; if ye hed  seen him at an ootside fire standin&rsquo; ower a big pot makin&rsquo; parritch, you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;  killed yoursel&rsquo; wi&rsquo; amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making it himself?&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by the hokey! His family are away some place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Spring Bluff,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch answered, remembering having heard of  their movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s the plaice he tell&rsquo;t me. Well&rdquo; (Duncan&rsquo;s eyes twinkled  more), &ldquo;he was standin&rsquo; ower this big black pot wi&rsquo; the fire blazin&rsquo; roond it  like the deil, an&rsquo; stirrin&rsquo; the parritch wi&rsquo; a spirtle as lang as ye&rsquo;re arm.  &lsquo;Are ye fond o&rsquo; burgoo, Mac?&rsquo; he&rsquo;d say to me every meenit, an&rsquo; then he&rsquo;d haud  up the spirtle, wi&rsquo; the parritch drippin&rsquo; frae it like tar, an&rsquo; lick at it wi&rsquo;  his rred tongue to tell if it was cooked eneugh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. McClure!&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch burst out, laughing, and put her hand  over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as true as gospel,&rdquo; McClure went on, earnestly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; then he&rsquo;d  pit the spirtle back into the pot an&rsquo; stir it a&rsquo; up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; when the breakfast was a&rsquo; rready on the table, an&rsquo; we baith sot  doon alang wi&rsquo; the men, he askit me would I hae some burgoo.&rdquo; (Duncan  chuckled.) &ldquo;&lsquo;It never agrees wi&rsquo; me,&rsquo; I tell&rsquo;t him.&rdquo; (Duncan paused.) &ldquo;But, by  jingo, Mrs. McCulloch, the men had a grreat appetite for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch gasped, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and ran off inside, while Duncan, his fat  sides shaking, sat chuckling cheerfully in the trap.</p>
<p>The minister, carrying a well-worn umbrella in his hand, appeared, and,  kissing his wife good-bye, climbed up and took a seat beside Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a&rsquo; richt wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; Duncan said, raising his hat to Mrs.  McCulloch, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll see he doesna rin awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ony body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch smiled amusedly, and the trap, creaking beneath its  burden, rolled away.</p>
<p>It was a glorious morning; a clear sky was overhead, the air clear and  crispy; birds were chirping and whistling in every tree, and the heavy dew on  the broad fields of green, soft wheat, extending on either side of the road,  glistened like jewels beneath the early sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s auld Bailey,&rdquo; Duncan said, recognising the form of the  storekeeper on ahead. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s puttin&rsquo; doon a bore on that lan&rsquo; o&rsquo; his that he  came by sae mysteriously, at Grass Tree, close by where they&rsquo;re haudin&rsquo; the sale,  an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s gaun oot there the day. I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; he strikes brimstone instead o&rsquo;  watter, pairrson,&rdquo; and Duncan flicked the horse with the whip to urge the brute  along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he gone down very deep with it?&rdquo; the minister asked, ignoring  Duncan&rsquo;s uncharitable wish towards a brother churchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad tae see him hauf as deep in debt, pairrson,&rdquo; and</p>
<p>The minister smiled, and, turning his head away noticed a cow standing  on her head and her front legs inside Murtagh&rsquo;s wheat crop. Her hind legs were  resting on the fence, twisted in the wires.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page134.jpg" alt="cow" width="750" height="604"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, look at that!&rdquo; he exclaimed, attracting Duncan&rsquo;s attention to  the animal.</p>
<p>Duncan stopped the trap and stared at her. Then he turned his head and  stared after Bailey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The indeependent auld hog, he seen her there, pairrson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo;  wouldna get doon tae dae a guid turn tae a neebour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the two of them alighted and approached the cow. The cow seemed to  take them for butchers, and struggled and moaned pitifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye auld sod,&rdquo; Duncan said reproachfully; &ldquo;sairves y&rsquo; richt.&rdquo; Then he  procured a short stick, the end of which he forced between the wires to ease  the strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ye ower the fence, pairrson,&rdquo; he called out, &ldquo;an&rsquo; frichten her  back a wee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister crawled through the wires, and the cow blew streaks of  froth at him and put out her tongue and bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; the minister murmured, standing clear and waving his  hands to induce her to back-pedal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna be frichtent for her, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan shouted, working hard at  the wires. &ldquo;She canna hairm y&rsquo;. Put yer haun&rsquo; on her shoother an&rsquo; shove her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister made several half-hearted attempts to put his hand on her  shoulder, but he didn&rsquo;t go as far as &ldquo;shoving&rdquo; her. The idea didn&rsquo;t seem to  appeal to him, and for a moment or two he stood inactive, staring hopelessly at  the struggling beast. All at once Duncan&rsquo;s plan succeeded, and with a rattling  of the wire the animal&rsquo;s hind legs dropped to the ground. Then, as though the  minister had been the cause of all the trouble, she bellowed angrily and rushed  at him. The minister turned and ran along the fence. The cow pursued him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna run frae her, pairrson!&rdquo; Duncan yelled, but, on hearing a noise  behind, he looked round and saw the horse running away with the trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, Wallace!&rdquo; he shouted, and chased the trap.</p>
<p>Duncan chased the trap for a quarter of a mile, calling out, &ldquo;Whoa,  Wallace&rdquo; between breaths. And when he captured the runaway and returned, the  minister was sitting on the road, pale and exhausted-looking, while the cow was  calmly enjoying the young wheat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she pit her horns tae ye, pairrson?&rdquo; Duncan asked anxiously.</p>
<p>The minister hadn&rsquo;t wind enough to reply. He dragged feebly at the end  of his coat, from which a large piece was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shouldna ha&rsquo; run, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said reprovingly. &ldquo;Ye should  ha&rsquo; stood yer grun&rsquo; an&rsquo; hit her a skelp on the snoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he helped the minister into the trap again and they drove on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter  24<br>
  The Land Sale</b></h2>
<p>As Duncan anticipated, a large crowd assembled at the sale. The ground  was covered with traps and conveyances of all values and descriptions; while a  hundred or more saddle-horses were fastened to trees, stumps, and the wheels of  drays. Politicians, who had no other way of filling in their time, were there;  a contingent of wealthy city men desirous of settling their sons on the best  land were there; all the old hands of the district, who had only a few pounds  to their name, were there, &ldquo;just to see how things would go&rdquo;; and their lanky  sons, who had no money at all to their name, but wanted to make homes for  themselves, were there also. The latter, for the most part, mooched about with  plans of the estate in their hands, pointing out the best pieces of land to  their parents. And the parents would pour over the plans and chew blades of  grass, and gaze thoughtfully at the noisy auctioneer, and think of their  banking accounts and wonder aloud &ldquo;if they could manage it.&rdquo; They would keep on  wondering until someone from the city would bid three or four pounds an acre  for some piece that they (the old hands) had in view; then they would gasp and  turn their eyes on the man who ventured such figures, and regard him as a  financial curiosity.</p>
<p>The day wore on, and the attendance grew larger and larger. Block after  block was put up and eagerly bid for, and knocked down at prices ranging from  three to seven pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gaun awfu&rsquo; dear, pairrson,&rdquo; McClure said, shaking his head, as he  waited for his turn to come. &ldquo;Frightfu&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the auctioneer read out the descriptions of the piece McClure  was anxious to secure for Peter, and Duncan nudged the minister and said, &ldquo;This  is th&rsquo; piece I&rsquo;m gaun tae hae a shot at,&rdquo; and the minister, who had been showing  symptoms of weariness, suddenly became interested in the proceedings again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten shillin&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Duncan called out cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten shillings an acre I&rsquo;m offered for this magnificent piece of dairy  land. Ten shillings for one of the choicest blocks in the whole estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a lull; no one seemed to want that particular piece; and  Duncan nudged the minister, and said excitedly, &ldquo;Bless me, if I dinna think  I&rsquo;ll get it for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen shillings,&rdquo; came slowly from a husky voice, the owner of which  was concealed in the thick of the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen shillings I am offered. Any advance on fifteen shillings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gang roon&rsquo; and keek wha&rsquo;s biddin&rsquo; against me, pairrson, an&rsquo; tell him  I&rsquo;ll gie him ten poon, tae haud his tongue,&rdquo; Duncan said excitedly.</p>
<p>The minister stared in surprise at Duncan, and remained motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At fifteen shillings&mdash;it&rsquo;s going at fifteen <i>shillings!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen and sax,&rdquo; hurriedly from Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen and six&mdash;seventeen and six&mdash;any advance on seventeen and six?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gang roon&rsquo;, pairrson, an&rsquo; tell him!&rdquo; Duncan fairly gasped to his  reverend companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of such a thing, McClure,&rdquo; the minister answered  warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poon&rsquo;!&rdquo; Duncan shouted, straining and stretching his neck to locate  his opponent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one pound an acre I&rsquo;m offered for a block worth all the rest of  the estate put together,&rdquo; the auctioneer rattled on. &ldquo;One pound five,&rdquo; from  Duncan&rsquo;s opponent.</p>
<p>At this stage John Jordan elbowed his way to Duncan, and said, &ldquo;Do you  know who&rsquo;s bidding against you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dinna,&rdquo; Duncan answered wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any advance on one pound five? Don&rsquo;t all speak at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eaglefoot,&rdquo; John Jordan said in Duncan&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ragged, dirty deil! Wha&rsquo;s puttin&rsquo; him up to it?&rdquo; Duncan exclaimed;  then, in the same breath to the auctioneer: </p>
<p>&ldquo;One poon&rsquo; ten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One pun&rsquo; ten, I&rsquo;m offered&mdash;one pun&rsquo; ten&mdash;one pun&rsquo; ten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bidding  for Bailey,&rdquo; Jordan whispered further, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll take &pound;50 to stand out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll nae get it, then; I&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; &rsquo;im pay for it,&rdquo; Duncan yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One pound twelve and six,&rdquo; from Eaglefoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three poonds!&rdquo; in sharp, angry tones from Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something like bidding, gentlemen,&rdquo; in encouraging tones from  the auctioneer. &ldquo;Three pounds I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three pounds ten,&rdquo; from Eaglefoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five poonds!&rdquo; Duncan roared before the man with the hammer could  repeat the former bid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five pounds ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven poonds,&rdquo; in determined tones from Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven pounds ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight poonds!&rdquo; Duncan yelled savagely.</p>
<p>The minister touched Duncan on the shoulder and whispered advisedly to  him not to lose his judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haud yer tongue, pairrson!&rdquo; Duncan howled, and the crowd laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine pounds,&rdquo; from Eaglefoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten poon&rsquo;,&rdquo; from Duncan, and the spectators surged round and urged him  to victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten pounds ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven poonds!&rdquo; Duncan roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve pounds,&rdquo; was the quick response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him hae it,&rdquo; Duncan cried eagerly, &ldquo;let him hae it; it&rsquo;s no worth  twa.&rdquo; And he smiled triumphantly and rejoiced with the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; the auctioneer asked, fixing his eyes on  Eaglefoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Mr. Bailey, I was biddin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Bill answered nervously, and the roars  of merriment that greeted the announcement were suddenly interrupted. Fresh  commotion set in. Bailey himself, with all his whiskers and his eyebrows burnt  off, and waving his hands about excitedly, rushed on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve struck fire at the bottom of the bore,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;It might be  a volcano, and the flame is burning high up in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd stared in wonder at Bailey, then in the direction of the  bore, where some gas or oil that was struck had ignited, and seemed to become  concerned about their personal safety. But the auctioneer, who feared the  spoiling of the sale, boldly declared Bailey was mad, and ordered his men to  take him away and tie him up. And his men cheerfully rushed Bailey, who made futile  efforts to resist, and, catching sight of the poor parson, appealed to him in a  pathetic voice. The minister made an attempt to protect the elder of his  church, and in solemn tones demanded his release, saying it was &ldquo;a wrong and unchristian  proceeding.</p>
<p>Then Duncan McClure interposed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna mind the auld rrascal, pairrson,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s no worth it.  An&rsquo; if he&rsquo;s no mad the noo, he will be when he kens a&rsquo; he has to pay for the  lan&rsquo; he bocht the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Duncan, taking the minister by the arm, led the way to the trap,  and drove him safely back to the Manse. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter  25<br>
  McClure Drops in for a Crack</b></h2>
<p>Jimmy McTaggart had just left the Manse when Duncan McClure  unexpectedly put in an appearance. At sight of Duncan Mrs. McCulloch started to  laugh&mdash;a laugh in which even the poor parson couldn&rsquo;t refrain from joining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you too, Mr. McClure! Surely not?&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said, shaking  hands merrily with the burly Scot.</p>
<p>Duncan smiled, and, looking mysteriously from one to the other, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blamed if I can tell what ye&rsquo;re lauchin&rsquo; at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch answered, her kindly eyes dancing with  merriment, &ldquo;only about half an hour ago Mr. Anderson came to tell us that they  were blessed with another young son; and he was no sooner gone than young Mr.  McGregor ran in with tidings of a daughter. And&rdquo; (laughing) &ldquo;he had no sooner  turned his back when&rdquo; (choking with mirth) &ldquo;Mr. McTaggart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-at!&rdquo; Duncan roared hilariously. &ldquo;Bless me, ye dinna tell me that  Jeemie McTaggart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, TWINS!&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch fairly shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losh!&rdquo; Duncan shouted, and, tumbling into a chair, dropped his head  between his knees and rocked about joyously. &ldquo;I wouldna hae thocht it o&rsquo;  McTaggart,&rdquo; he yelled, lifting his head again; &ldquo;I didna think he was sae  progressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister looked hard at Duncan; then he, too, laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I saw YOU coming in the gate, Mr. McClure,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch went on, after recovering herself</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-at!&rdquo; Duncan burst out afresh, the joke suddenly dawning on him.  &ldquo;Did ye think I was anither?&rdquo; and his head dropped again, while his sides shook  more. &ldquo;Losh me! nae sic thing! Ma auld wifie wouldna hae that noo. But, by  jove!&rdquo; (suddenly arresting his mirth, and gazing at the minister with a steady  serious eye) &ldquo;I tell ye what, pairrson. Ye ken yon bay mare o&rsquo; mine&mdash;the yin  that bolted wi&rsquo; ye past the kirk?&rdquo; (The minister remembered the animal well.)  &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s got a rrattlin&rsquo; guid foal, jist a day auld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister, who couldn&rsquo;t restrain himself, broke into another laugh,  and Mrs. McCulloch ran away to the kitchen.</p>
<p>A moment or two later, Jimmy McTaggart, out of breath, returned to know  if Mrs. McCulloch could lend the nurse a little cornflour till theirs came from  the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Jeemie McTaggart!&rdquo; Duncan shouted cheerfully, wheeling his  chair round to face the father of the twins, who remained standing at the door.  &ldquo;I believe ye&rsquo;ve been daein&rsquo; great things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Twa</i>,&rdquo; McTaggart answered  with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surprises me,&rdquo; Duncan went on seriously; &ldquo;for I usetae tell the  chaps that you wad dee a baimless unhappy auld beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yer see, yer never can tell,&rdquo; the other answered, with a short,  triumphant chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By hokey, ye canna, then,&rdquo; from Duncan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; queer hoo  things turn oot sometimes. I wadna wonder noo if ye hae a bigger faimly than  mysel&rsquo;. Ye&rsquo;ll as likely as no hae triplets next time&mdash;by jove, ye micht!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister looked hard at Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twa&rsquo;s whips,&rdquo; McTaggart answered concernedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twa&rsquo;s naething at a&rsquo;, mon,&rdquo; Duncan said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re nae muckle guid tae  a chap on a fairm, an&rsquo; they dinna mak&rsquo; a hoose merry at a&rsquo;. Look at a&rsquo; that&rsquo;s  runnin&rsquo; aboot oor hame, an&rsquo; ye wadna believe the deil o&rsquo; a sum they save us  spennin&rsquo; in wages. Aye, an&rsquo; if ye gang intil the hoose o&rsquo; a nicht, ye canna  hear yoursel&rsquo; speak&rdquo; (turning to the minister). &ldquo;They mak&rsquo; grreat fun for  theirsels, pairrson. Some nichts the beggars wreck a&rsquo; the furniture scrappin&rsquo;  wi&rsquo; ilk ither in their games and jackanape tricks, and they leave a&rsquo; for their  mither to redd-up. And when they&rsquo;re no haein&rsquo; that kin&rsquo; o&rsquo; fun, pairrson, they  get me in tae play the pipes, and they dance the Hielan&rsquo; fling or the Scotch  reels. But&rdquo; (turning to McTaggart) &ldquo;I think ye&rsquo;ve started too late tae hae  onything like that, Jeemie. Ye&rsquo;ll be a dour, crabby, auld beggar be the time  yours hae a&rsquo; grown up, and whenever any o&rsquo; them&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; a noise ye&rsquo;ll be  yellin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Haud ye&rsquo;r tongue,&rsquo; and sweering like the deil, an&rsquo; shakin&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re  crutch across the room at them a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McTaggart grinned at Duncan, and, receiving the cornflour from Mrs.  McCulloch, turned to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McTaggart!&rdquo; Duncan shouted. &ldquo;Ye hae nae tellt us wha the bairns are  like. Are they like yoursel&rsquo; or like the guid wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; McTaggart answered, turning back, &ldquo;ut&rsquo;s hard to tell yet. Some  say the boy&rsquo;s like me, and that the girl&rsquo;s like its mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that rrate, then,&rdquo; Duncan drawled, with a mischievous twinkle in  his eye, &ldquo;the boy &rsquo;ll be the ugly beggar o&rsquo; the brace.&rdquo; McTaggart was lost for  a reply, and hesitated and looked sheepishly from Duncan to the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye ken ye&rsquo;re not vera pretty, Mac,&rdquo; Duncan added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; McTaggart answered, forcing a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye look a grreat lot better sin&rsquo; ye started growin&rsquo; a baird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister couldn&rsquo;t help smiling at Duncan, and McTaggart, grinning  another sickly grin, mumbled &ldquo;Good-day&rdquo; again and left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McTaggart doesna like tae be chaffed aboot his looks, pairrson,&rdquo;  Duncan said to the minister. &ldquo;He canna stan&rsquo; it at a&rsquo;; an&rsquo; yet he&rsquo;s nae sic a  bad-lookin&rsquo; cove, but he&rsquo;s sae helpless to defend hissel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister smiled at his guest, and, by way of diversion, inquired  how the corn crop was turning out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Duncan answered thoughtfully, &ldquo;I expec&rsquo; to get a few bags frae  mine&rdquo; (Duncan expected about three hundred bags altogether), &ldquo;but auld Henning  Henssler, I believe, pairrson, will mak&rsquo; his bloomin&rsquo; fortune this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeedl&rdquo; the minister said, becoming interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Duncan went on, lifting his voice, &ldquo;he will that.&rdquo; Then, after a  pause:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hae ye ever been tae his place, pairrson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister had been there once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ever the auld chap tell ye,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how he stopped young Bill  Riley frae gaun after his big, fat dochter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister smiled and shook his head in the negative. Duncan rose to  his feet and, in the voice of the old German, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; I say me to dot shap, &lsquo;I vants no Irish mit Sherman, und  if come you here some more to court mit mein daughter, I court you mit mein  dorg.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister adjusted his spectacles, and stared through them at  Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dot shap he go avay den,&rsquo;&rdquo; Duncan continued, throwing his arms about,  &ldquo;&lsquo;und I not see him some more dill von efenin&rsquo; he dinks I am avay. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I  say, lettin&rsquo; Bismarck from der shain, &ldquo;dake him.&rdquo; Dot shap run like plazes, und  Bismarck he dake him by der leg, und ven I come he hef him by der droat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He could speak noddings,&rsquo;&rdquo; Duncan rattled on; &ldquo;&lsquo;he could only yust  kick; und ven I dake me dorg avay, Riley run like der vind till I see him no  more.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did the dog tear the man&rsquo;s flesh?&rdquo; the minister asked in horrified  tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, that&rsquo;s what I asked the auld chap mysel&rsquo;, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did he answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo; you be a foolidge shild, mein friend; Bismarck he hef no  deeth&mdash;he hef noding only a dongue,&rsquo;&rdquo; Duncan said, and roared laughing, while  the minister smiled placidly, and thought of Henssler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no the same as auld Riley&rsquo;s vairsion o&rsquo; it, pairrson,&rdquo;  Duncan said, recovering himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not?&rdquo; from the minister, who began to show symptoms of  weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naething like it at a&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a&rsquo;thegither deeferent. The auld chap says  that his son gied Henssler a deil o&rsquo; a hidin&rsquo;; but he&rsquo;s an awfu&rsquo; liar,  pairrson&mdash;the greatest liar that ever was born. De ye ken what he tellt me aboot  a watch he gat gien tae him once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister looked up wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tellt me,&rdquo; said Duncan, &ldquo;that he dropped it in a crick in a deep  place one Sawbath when he was goin&rsquo; tae the Grass Tree, an&rsquo; he couldna get it  oot; and when he cam&rsquo; back the next Sawbath, he pinted oot the place to a  blackfellow who was a great swimmer, an&rsquo; put saxpence in his palm. An&rsquo; the  blackfellow made the deil&rsquo;s ain dive, an&rsquo; cam&rsquo; up wi&rsquo; the watch in his mooth,  an&rsquo; it was gaun to the correct time o&rsquo; day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going?&rdquo; the minister said in tones of astonishment. &ldquo;How could a watch  go for a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him that, tae, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan replied with a smile, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he  just closed his een an&rsquo; said it <i>was an  eight-day watch</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister removed his spectacles and wiped them thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite forgot to ask after Mrs. McClure and the family,&rdquo; she said,  addressing Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re a&rsquo; brawly,&rdquo; Duncan drawled. &ldquo;The lassies an&rsquo; their mither,  I think, are gaun up tae see auld McStirling the day. Ye ken, I suppose, that  auld Jeemie is my wife&rsquo;s brither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch answered. &ldquo;And how is the old gentleman  getting along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt agen noo&mdash;that is, as richt as ye cuid expeck o&rsquo; him  for his age; but of coorse he&rsquo;s done for. His ee-sicht&rsquo;s a&rsquo; gane, an&rsquo; he  couldna see you or me if he was here in this room; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m beggared if I  believe the auld chap cuid see a sovereign if ye wus tae put it richt under his  nose.&rdquo; And Duncan smiled pleasantly at his own humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old fellow!&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch said sympathisingly. &ldquo;It is sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jove, it is that,&rdquo; Duncan answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rreal serious thing. I  wouldna like it tae happen tae me. I don&rsquo;t know what th&rsquo; deuce I&rsquo;d do wi&rsquo;  mysel&rsquo; if I went blin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; yet sometimes ye canna help lauchin&rsquo; like th&rsquo; vera deil at auld  McStirling; he does sic a lot o&rsquo; comic things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch stared thoughtfully at the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used tae be a teegur tae worrk ance, ye ken, and&rdquo; (laughing) &ldquo;he  thinks he is still. ... He gets hissel&rsquo; a hoe sometimes an&rsquo; staggers aboot the  grass-paddock under it cuttin&rsquo; Bathurst burrs, an&rsquo; he never cares a rrap which  side o&rsquo; the fence he cuts them on, an&rsquo; nine times oot o&rsquo; ten ye&rsquo;ll see him  wirin&rsquo; in like auld boots at the burr on Tam Smith&rsquo;s land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; Mrs. McCulloch murmured sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Tam never interferes wi&rsquo; him,&rdquo; Duncan said, and Mrs. McCulloch was  forced to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Peter took him tae toon in the sulky ae day,&rdquo; Duncan went on, &ldquo;an&rsquo;  gaun doon the main street, Peter got oot tae go intil a shop, and left the auld  chap tae mind the horse. Peter was a bit o&rsquo; a while gettin&rsquo; what he was after,  an&rsquo; the auld cove got tired o&rsquo; it, and thocht he&rsquo;d do a walk roon, an&rsquo; got doon  on tae the footpath. After a bit he thocht he&rsquo;d get back, and crawled up intil  a sulky that wasna his, and sat in it like a bloomin&rsquo; king. He was sittin&rsquo; in  it quite a guid while, when a couple of swell girls cam&rsquo; alang wi&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo;  pairrcels, and just stared at him wi&rsquo; grreat astonishment. One o&rsquo; them at last  asked him what he was doin&rsquo; up there, and tellt him it was her sulky, an&rsquo; the  auld chap yelled at her an&rsquo; tellt her to go to the deil, an&rsquo; said he&rsquo;d give her  in charge o&rsquo; a constable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McCulloch smiled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An if Peter hadna come alang just in time, I believe the auld fule wad  hae done it,&rdquo; Duncan concluded.</p>
<p>There was a long silence, during which the minister yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Duncan said, rising and putting on his hat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to ca&rsquo;  roon&rsquo; tae McIntyre&rsquo;s tae stick a pig for him, so I&rsquo;d better be makin&rsquo; trracks,&rdquo;  and off he strode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter  26<br>
  Retribution</b></h2>
<p>A second meeting of the church committee was to be held at McClure&rsquo;s  place one evening shortly after the timber of the ruined edifice had  disappeared, and Duncan, having finished his tea, was sitting in the cool of  the verandah waiting the arrival of his brother members.</p>
<p>Bill Eaglefoot, whom Duncan was not waiting for, unexpectedly came  along, and, with a weary, innocent expression on his face, asked if there &ldquo;was  anythink doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye sneaking, slithery houn&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;hae ye spent your  wages o&rsquo; sin a&rsquo;ready?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Bill pretended not to understand McClure&rsquo;s meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Jorgens nae paid ye for assistin&rsquo; him tae selec&rsquo; the timber  for his new hoose?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer what noo &rsquo;ouse? What are yer talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; Bill answered  sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, th&rsquo; hoose o&rsquo; worship that the twa o&rsquo; ye micht hae tae gang tae  jile for stealin&rsquo; afore vera lang,&rdquo; Duncan answered sternly.</p>
<p>Bill shuffled his feet, and displayed signs of restlessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never stole it,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, o&rsquo; course ye didna, ye whimperin&rsquo; auld skunk!&rdquo; Duncan shouted. &ldquo;Ye  wouldna dae onything wrang&mdash;ye couldna; nor Jorgens, either&mdash;ye&rsquo;re sic a pair o&rsquo;  saints!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen tae me,&rdquo; McClure went on; &ldquo;if a&rsquo; the timber ye took awa&rsquo;  isna back in its place be the end o&rsquo; the week, we&rsquo;ll hae ye baith put in jile;  and instead o&rsquo; Mr. Jorgens&rsquo;s new hoose bein&rsquo; opened wi&rsquo; prayer, as, nae doot,  ye baith intended it should, it&rsquo;ll be opened wi&rsquo; a polisman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t help what Jorgens does,&rdquo; Bill groaned in self-defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of coorse ye canna,&rdquo; Duncan replied, &ldquo;but ye could help him well  eneuch to steal the kirk. And ye <i>did</i> steal it, ye auld sod, ye! An&rsquo; if ye try to deny the fac&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll strangle ye  whaur ye stan&rsquo;!&rdquo; And Duncan rose and was approaching Bill in a threatening  manner, when Mrs. McClure appeared and warned him not to lose his temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I willna,&rdquo; he said, turning to his wife, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve lost eneugh  a&rsquo;ready ower sic a shivering sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be going over there to-night,&rdquo; Bill mumbled after a  silence, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell him what you&rsquo;ve said about bringing it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; ye can tell him if he doesna I&rsquo;ll get the twa o&rsquo; ye twenty year,&rdquo;  Duncan answered, seating himself again.</p>
<p>For a while Bill stood and stared at Duncan, like one who had something  on his mind and was afraid to unbosom himself. But McClure merely groaned and  ignored Bill.</p>
<p>Bailey arrived, and, mounting the verandah, cast a contemptuous look on  Bill, and said &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; to Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s you, is it, Bailey?&rdquo; Duncan drawled. &ldquo;We didna expec&rsquo; tae be  honoured wi&rsquo; <i>your</i> presence at the  meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they invited me to come,&rdquo; Bailey replied shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, nae doot&mdash;nae doot,&rdquo; dreamily from Duncan, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s tactfu&rsquo;  sometimes to refuse inveetations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo; Bailey retorted warmly. Eaglefoot deemed it a  favourable moment to unburden himself, and, interrupting, said humbly to  Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any chance at all of me getting a bit to eat at the kitchen  before I go back, Mr. McClure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gang tae the deil, ye cadging crawler, and bring back the kirk, or  I&rsquo;ll break ye&rsquo;re heid!&rdquo; And Duncan jumped to his feet and started Bill hobbling  down the steps like a dog with a tin on its tail.</p>
<p>Then, turning to Bailey, Duncan yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whit dae I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bailey persisted, with unusual display of courage; &ldquo;I want to  know what you mean by always tryin&rsquo; to disparage me the way you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, may be,&rdquo; Duncan answered, &ldquo;it doesna occur tae yer virtuous mind  that yer action in takin&rsquo; the piano frae the pairrson when he was sair  afflicted wi&rsquo; trouble hasna been forgotten by the committee or the  congregation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you reckon I took him down over his bloomin&rsquo; old piano, then?&rdquo;  Bailey cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Bailey,&rdquo; Duncan answered quietly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m certain ye reckon ye  did yoursel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey sneered contemptuously. Then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, McClure. I never took him down over it. He took ME down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan flew off the handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye dinna apologise for that, Bailey,&rdquo; he roared, rising to his feet  again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurl ye on tae ye&rsquo;re heid!&rdquo; And, yelling &ldquo;Apologise!&rdquo; Duncan took  his brother elder by the coat collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, McClure&mdash;I tell you he did!&rdquo; Bailey gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hae ye still the insolence tae repeat it, mon?&rdquo; McClure roared,  shaking Bailey like a rat.</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna ye interfere wi&rsquo; me, wumman!&rdquo; cried Duncan. &ldquo;The meeserable  crawler has insulted the meenister behin&rsquo; his baack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, Mrs. McClure&mdash;he did take me down,&rdquo; Bailey reiterated  sullenly. &ldquo;I gave him &pound;20 for the piano, which he said was nearly new and cost  him &pound;60, and it&rsquo;s no good at all; it won&rsquo;t go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan shook Bailey hard again, and yelled, &ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bailey gurgled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t play a tune, I tell yer; none of the keys &rsquo;ll make a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve been daein&rsquo; something tae it!&rdquo; Duncan roared suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;not a thing!&rdquo; Bailey squeaked. &ldquo;Why should I, when it&rsquo;s me  own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve been pittin&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re feet on tap o&rsquo; it!&rdquo; in indignant tones from  Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;no one has,&rdquo; from Bailey; &ldquo;it went wrong itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be the mice have got intil it,&rdquo; Mrs. McClure suggested, as an  explanation of the defection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hae ye been lettin&rsquo; the mice take leeberties wi&rsquo; it?&rdquo; Duncan howled,  shaking Bailey some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be one or two got into it,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but they  couldn&rsquo;t do it any harm. It was <i>never</i> any good, I tell you; and if you don&rsquo;t believe me you can have it for five  pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan released his hold of the storekeeper suddenly, and, peering into  his pale perspiring face, said calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hae it for five pun&rsquo;? Do ye mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; Bailey answered; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll be a fool if you buy  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull ye tak&rsquo; ma cheque the noo and gi&rsquo; me a clean receipt for the  piano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey willingly said he would, and Duncan went off and procured his  cheque-book and closed the bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, now,&rdquo; Duncan said advisedly, putting the receipt in his pocket,  &ldquo;conseederin&rsquo; the bit ill-feelin&rsquo;, I think it would be judicious if ye didna  stay for the meeting. An&rsquo; the morn I&rsquo;ll gang wi&rsquo; the dray an&rsquo; tak&rsquo; deleevery o&rsquo;  the piano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey took Duncan&rsquo;s advice, and turned and left just as the minister  and several of the committee entered the yard together.</p>
<p>The committee met in Duncan&rsquo;s sitting-room, and decided to take action  to recover the stolen timber from Jorgens, and to canvass the district for  fresh subscriptions to rebuild the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan suggested, &ldquo;if you an mysel&rsquo; were tae gang  roon&rsquo; personally we&rsquo;d collec&rsquo; quite a guid sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister fell in with Duncan&rsquo;s idea, and they arranged to start out  together some afternoon.</p>
<p>Next morning Duncan turned up early at Bailey&rsquo;s with the dray, and  Bailey cheerfully gave possession of the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, remember,&rdquo; he said warningly, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve told you what sort of  thing it is. So don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve taken you in when you get home and look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gie ye ma word on that, Bailey,&rdquo; Duncan answered confidently,  securing the instrument with ropes to the guard irons of the dray. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll  gie ye anither fiver for ye&rsquo;re honesty if it&rsquo;s only half sae bad as ye say it  is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey sniggered, and Duncan, mounting the shaft of the dray, drove off  with the piano.</p>
<p>When the instrument was lifted from the dray at Loch Ness and carried  inside by Duncan and several of the men, Mrs. McClure and the girls collected  eagerly about it, and admired it, and examined it all over. They ran their  fingers in turn over the keyboard, but to their amazement only a note or two  responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be eaten inside by the mice,&rdquo; one of the girls suggested, and  started to explore the interior of the instrument.</p>
<p>When it was opened up, a township of excited mice and other vermin  raced about the different compartments and made the machine jingle and vibrate.  Some of the mice arrived at the keyboard, and hurried along it and somersaulted  to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oot! Oot!&rdquo; Duncan exclaimed, making clumsy, frantic efforts to stamp  heavily on some of them as they scampered to the different corners of the  house. &ldquo;Whaur th&rsquo; deil hae they been a&rsquo; the time?&rdquo; Then he peered curiously  into the piano, and more mice, followed by a family of whiskered cockroaches,  came to the top.</p>
<p>Duncan struck at them hard with his felt hat, and knocked a lot of dust  out of it, and the girls squealed and pulled their skirts about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Loard only kens what mair it may contain!&rdquo; and Duncan &ldquo;keeked&rdquo;  cautiously into the piano again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ever ye see sic a thing?&rdquo; he exclaimed on making a discovery. &ldquo;Blow  me, Vi, it&rsquo;s fu&rsquo; o&rsquo; hay!&rdquo; And, inserting his arm, drew out a dusty accumulation  of straw and dust and young unfledged mice.</p>
<p>The girls shrieked cheerfully, and made nasty reflections on Mrs.  Bailey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Loard!&rdquo; Duncan cried, fishing out a collection of rag, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a  pocket o&rsquo; one o&rsquo; Bailey&rsquo;s auld pants&mdash;an&rsquo; a deid moose in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The females pulled ugly faces, and ordered their parent to throw the  rubbish outside.</p>
<p>Duncan dropped it on the floor and said: &ldquo;Haud ye till we see what mair  there is.&rdquo; And he dipped into the receptacle again. And when he drew out a  portion of another garment the girls shrieked and danced about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mrs.</i> Bailey&rsquo;s!&rdquo; they gasped,  and shrieked some more, as their parent, with a broad smile on his face, stood  holding the prize up to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldna fit YOU, Vi,&rdquo; Duncan said to Mrs. McClure, who was a big,  fat woman, and broke into a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it doon, mon, and dinna be a fule!&rdquo; Mrs. McClure cried, brushing  the tattered trophy from her husband&rsquo;s hands. And Duncan dropped the  dismembered garment on the other rubbish and looked into the piano once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, withdrawing his hand.</p>
<p>Then, after a silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nae wonder it wouldna play for the auld skinflint,&rdquo; he remarked,  closely inspecting the instrument when it had been cleared of all the rubbish  and vermin. &ldquo;A&rsquo; the cords are gnawed in twa wi&rsquo; the mice. The ends o&rsquo; them are  stickin&rsquo; oot a&rsquo; ower the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure regarded the damage lightly, and was sure it could be  easily remedied at little cost. And one of the girls remembered that a piano  expert was at that moment engaged at McGrogan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gang an&rsquo; tell him, Hetty, that I hae a job for him,&rdquo; Duncan said; and  Hetty poked her head into a bonnet and went straightway.</p>
<p>The expert returned with Hetty and set to work on the piano; and when  he had put it in order, later in the day, and played a lot on it for his own  amusement, he offered Duncan thirty pounds for it.</p>
<p>Duncan regarded him with a look of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thairty pun&rsquo;?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, mon, d&rsquo; ye ken it cost a&rsquo;maist a hunner  afore it was landed i&rsquo; the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; the expert said, looking closely at the instrument again;  &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll give you that for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye willna,&rdquo; Duncan replied firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, make it forty?&rdquo; the other said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor <i>saxty</i>,&rdquo; Duncan snapped.</p>
<p>The expert turned and eyed the instrument some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you play, Mr. McClure?&rdquo; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No on sic things as that, but I can rrattle the pipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bag-pipes?&rdquo; from the expert, with an amused smile creeping over  his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; Duncan returned proudly. &ldquo;Will I gie ye a blaw on them?&rdquo; And,  with the glitter of patriotism in his eye, he went off and returned with the  pipes under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whaat was that ye wer&rsquo; playin&rsquo; the noo?&rdquo; he said, striking an imposing  attitude in the middle of the room, and adjusting the pipes which suddenly  became seized with musical spasms. &ldquo;Oh, this?&rdquo; And the other struck a bar or  two of &ldquo;The Blue Bells of Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s it. Go ahead wi&rsquo; it, and I&rsquo;ll pick ye up,&rdquo; said Duncan.</p>
<p>The pianist smiled, and, squaring himself, began softly looking over  his shoulder the while. Then in a fusillade of musical fireworks Duncan  followed, and attracted all the members of the household to the room. The  expert swayed about over the keyboard for an interval, then with a loud burst  of merriment bounded to his feet and stood near the door gazing in cheerfulness  and wonder at Duncan. But Duncan, in his element, was solemn, and blew on&mdash;blew  till he was fairly exhausted. Then he lowered the pipes and said: Ye couldna keep  time wi&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expert cheerfully admitted he couldn&rsquo;t; and, seeming to fear Duncan  might inflict some more on him, seized his hat and went off, chuckling to  himself all the way to the gate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter  27<br>
  The Lord Loveth a Cheerful Giver</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ca&rsquo; on a&rsquo; those under the range fairst, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said  advisedly, when he and the minister were ready to set out to canvass the  district. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the hardest tae squeeze a saxpence oot o&rsquo;, up that way, and  we&rsquo;ll be feelin&rsquo; fresh tae tackle the beggars, pairrson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister nodded and smilingly joined Duncan.</p>
<p>A few miles along the road they met Jorgens with two horses in a dray,  returning the first instalment of the stolen church. Duncan stopped him, and,  with a twinkle in his eye, gazed up at the loading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sae ye&rsquo;ve thocht better o&rsquo; it, Jorgens?&rdquo; he said meaningly.</p>
<p>Jorgens looked ashamed, and, casting his eyes on the ground, mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken it only Eaglefoot told me yous wasn&rsquo;t  going to use it any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was the reason you went tae get it in the nicht?&rdquo; Duncan  answered, with a knowing glance at the minister. Then added quickly: &ldquo;It doesna  matter, Jorgens; we&rsquo;re no going tae interfere wi&rsquo; ye when ye&rsquo;re doing what&rsquo;s richt.  But I&rsquo;ve something here&rdquo; (drawing the subscription list from his pocket) &ldquo;which  ye micht oblige the meenister and mysel&rsquo; by writing ye&rsquo;re name on for a couple  of guineas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jorgens didn&rsquo;t quite understand, and stared at the paper as though he  suspected it were a summons.</p>
<p>Duncan explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want a sma&rsquo; subscription frae y&rsquo; to help rebuild the kirk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jorgens stammered. Then, after hesitating and thinking hard: &ldquo;A  subscription? But I don&rsquo;t go to church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, ye dinna,&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;which isna a bad thing for the kirk, may  be. But put ye&rsquo;re name doon, Jorgens, an&rsquo; like as no ye&rsquo;ll dae ae gude turn i&rsquo;  ye&rsquo;re lifetime that&rsquo;ll leeve after ye. An&rsquo; it may be the means o&rsquo; savin&rsquo; ye  frae gettin&rsquo; a roastin&rsquo; frae auld Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I was one who went to church&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye were,&rdquo; Duncan interrupted, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;d sneak oot o&rsquo; gi&rsquo;en, like mony  o&rsquo; them that dae gang. Here, noo, how much shall I put ye doon for, Jorgens?&rdquo;  And Duncan flourished a pencil.</p>
<p>Jorgens shuffled about, and mumbled, &ldquo;Well, I  couldn&rsquo;t give more than a guinea.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400061h-images/page156.jpg" alt="more" width="520" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, we&rsquo;ll let ye aff wi&rsquo; that.&rdquo; And Duncan dismounted and handed  the pencil to Jorgens. </p>
<p>When Jorgens signed the list Duncan said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye happen to hae the guinea on ye noo? If ye hae it&rsquo;ll get it aff  ye&rsquo;re mind, and save trouble in collec&rsquo;in&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a QUID on me,&rdquo; was the reluctant answer; &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t a  guinea .&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll dae&mdash;that&rsquo;ll dae!&rdquo; Duncan replied, holding out his hand for the  money. &ldquo;Ye can gie the shullin&rsquo; another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jorgens slowly and laboriously extracted a greasy crinkled pound note  from his trouser pocket and handed it over. Duncan took the money eagerly, and  scratched &ldquo;Paid &pound;1&rdquo; opposite the benefactor&rsquo;s name, and then mounted his horse  and went on with the minister. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadna got it out o&rsquo; him the day, pairrson,&rdquo; he remarked with a  chuckle, &ldquo;we wouldna hae seen it at a&rsquo;. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll wager y&rsquo; he&rsquo;s whippin&rsquo; the cat  and kickin&rsquo; himsel&rsquo; ower it a&rsquo;ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister said it would be a pity to take it from him if he was not  willing to give. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Duncan said; &ldquo;it doesna matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dinna ken how we&rsquo;ll get on here, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said anxiously,  as they approached McIre&rsquo;s place. &ldquo;Auld Tam&rsquo;s a mean auld beggar; an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s aye  puttin&rsquo; on a puir mooth. An&rsquo; sae&rsquo;s his wife.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The dogs barked, and old Tom McIre, who was standing studying the ways  of pigs, looked up, and, knowing the mission of the visitors, slipped behind  the haystack&mdash;but not before Duncan&rsquo;s quick eye had rested on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whaur&rsquo;s the boss?&rdquo; Duncan asked of Mrs. McIre, who came from the  kitchen with a blush and a lot of flour on her face. Mrs. McIre hesitated, then  looked around the horizon,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll be about at all this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he no?&rdquo; Duncan grunted, looking hard at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is Mrs. McClure and the children, Mr. McClure?&rdquo; Mrs. McIre  asked, changing the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re vera weel,&rdquo; Duncan answered absent-mindedly. Then eyeing the  haystack, which was a new one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha built yon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;McIre, himsel&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mrs. McIre answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I maun hae a keek at it,&rdquo; and Duncan dismounted and walking across the  yard, strolled round the stack.</p>
<p>Duncan, in a careless, innocent way, mooched to the rear of the stack,  and feigned surprise when he discovered McIre crouched in hiding there. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang it!&rdquo; he said, with a smile, &ldquo;I didna expec&rsquo; tae find you here, Tam.  Why, yer auld woman tellt the meenister that you were awa&rsquo; an&rsquo; wouldna be back  a&rsquo; the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McIre, with a guilty look on his face, held up his finger warningly,  and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna let on, McClure.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I willna, Tam&mdash;I willna&mdash;if y&rsquo; put ye&rsquo;re signature doon here for a fiver  to the building o&rsquo; the new kirk.&rdquo; And Duncan displayed the list. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldna! I canna afford a saxpence, McClure,&rdquo; McIre aswered  somemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You canna?&rdquo; from Duncan, warmly; &ldquo;and a heathen like Jorgens can  afford a guinea&rdquo; (showing the signature), and pays the money doon&rdquo; (taking the  greasy note from his pocket and displaying it). &ldquo;Hae some respec&rsquo; for yoursel&rsquo;,  Tam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>McIre seemed in distress. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Put yoursel&rsquo; doon for a fiver, mon,&rdquo; Duncan persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I canna, McClure!&rdquo; painfully from McIre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would ye hae it gang roond the country that a scallawag o&rsquo; the name o&rsquo;  Jorgens gied mair tae a gude cause than McIre,&rdquo; Duncan went on , feelingly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldna gie a fiver, McClure,&rdquo; and McIre hung his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gie four poons, then,&rdquo; McClure suggested, shoving the list and the  pencil into the other&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it two guineas,&rdquo; McIre murmured, preparing to write.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isna eneugh,&rdquo; Duncan answered; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s ane better than Jorgens;  sae I&rsquo;ll let ye aff wi&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McIre signed; then Duncan strolled leisurely back to the minister and  said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be getting along noo, pairrson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they said &ldquo;Good-day&rdquo; to Mrs. McIre, and rode on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gat auld Tam for two guineas,&rdquo; Duncan said with a pleased chuckle,  when they were out of hearing, and surprised the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t he away?&rdquo; he said, with a look of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasna flash eneugh dressed, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan answered, apologising  for McIre, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he didna care tae meet ye. He&rsquo;s a sensitive auld beggar, is  Tam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; the minister mused sympathisingly; and added after a  pause: &ldquo;But it was indeed liberal of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s leeberality itself, pairrson,&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;s taken the  richt way; but if he isna he&rsquo;s the vera deil tae extrac&rsquo; money fra. An&rsquo; wi&rsquo;  himsel&rsquo; an&rsquo; the heathen Jorgens heidin&rsquo; the list, &rsquo;twill be as easy to collec&rsquo;  frae the others as failin&rsquo; aff a log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Duncan proved a true prophet; for, when the adherents to the  church&mdash;and a good many who were not&mdash;were shown Jorgens&rsquo;s and McIre&rsquo;s names,  they each went one better; and at the end of a week&rsquo;s canvass the rebuilding of  the church was more than assured. And at the end of the month the carpenter had  completed the work, and a larger and more imposing house of worship took the  place of the one that had been blown down.</p>
<p>The opening of the new church was celebrated by a Sunday-school picnic,  on the eve of which the church committee formed themselves into a surprise  party, and waited upon the minister and his wife at the Manse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hae a few words tae say tae ye directly, pairrson, when ma dray  comes,&rdquo; Duncan said, moving to the door and looking out.</p>
<p>The minister didn&rsquo;t understand Duncan, and Mrs. McCulloch smiled  wonderingly at him.</p>
<p>The next moment the dray rolled up to the door of the Manse, and the  committee went out, and, lifting a piano from it, struggled with it inside and  set it down in a corner of the room&mdash;the minister and his wife the while looking  on in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. McCulloch,&rdquo; Duncan said, turning and facing them, &ldquo;on  behalf o&rsquo; the committee here, which doesna include Mr. Bailey, I hae grreat  pleasure in makin&rsquo; ye a praisent o&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re ain piano.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The tears ran silently down Mrs. McCulloch&rsquo;s cheeks; and the poor  parson could only show his gratitude by extending his hand to each of the  committee in turn.</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence; and when she had recovered her feelings,  Mrs. McCulloch took her place at the piano and started to play &ldquo;Thy  Will be Done.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ss an awfu&rsquo; pity,&rdquo; Duncan exclaimed, with sudden enthusiasm, &ldquo;that  I didna think tae bring the pipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Wedding</b></h2>
<p>Three months later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonely&rdquo; Matthewson, an old bachelor without kith or kin in the  country, died one day, and everyone was wondering to whom he had left his  freehold selection, which was worth a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>The poor parson came along to Duncan McClure&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Matthewson&rsquo;s will, and heard it read to-day,&rdquo; he said to Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye, pairrson?&rdquo; Duncan answered. &ldquo;I hope the auld beggar didna  leave onything tae me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister smiled and said, &ldquo;No; he left it all to Danny Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye dinna tell me that, pairrson?&rdquo; Duncan exclaimed with astonishment.  &ldquo;Losh! but I&rsquo;m glad tae hear he had sae much guid sense; I never expeckit it o&rsquo;  him; an&rsquo; yet I micht hae expeckit it, for he aye spoke weel o&rsquo; Danny, an&rsquo;  wouldna trust onybody else wi&rsquo; a pipefu&rsquo; o&rsquo; tobacco or the haudin&rsquo; o&rsquo; a horse.  An&rsquo; the lan&rsquo; is worth a thousand. Guid Loard! what pleasure it will gie tae  Bailey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor parson smiled; and Duncan stepped outside from the verandah  and yelled to Peter, who was chaffcutting at the barn, to &ldquo;sen&rsquo; the rightfu&rsquo;  heir an&rsquo; successor to &lsquo;Lochnagar&rsquo; doon at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send who?&rdquo; Peter shouted back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny Dawson, then,&rdquo; Duncan bellowed, &ldquo;if ye dinna ken him be his  title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, when Danny came along, Duncan seized him by the hand, and, again  ignoring the poor parson, made himself spokesman, and conveyed the good news  contained in the will to him.</p>
<p>Danny blushed modestly in the presence of the minister, and said he  didn&rsquo;t know &ldquo;why the old chap should think of him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I dinna, either,&rdquo; Duncan said roguishly; &ldquo;but these eccentric auld  bachelors dae queer things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister smiled at Duncan, then congratulated Danny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;, I suppose,&rdquo; McClure added, &ldquo;we can expeck a weddin&rsquo; noo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny blushed some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; may be ye&rsquo;ll baith consent tae gettin&rsquo; mairrit here at &lsquo;Loch  Ness,&rsquo; an&rsquo;, if ye dae, I&rsquo;ll gie the deil&rsquo;s ain spree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t mind, Mr.  McClure,&rdquo; Danny answered, laughing.</p>
<p>And in less than a month after, on a bright November day, when the  brown winter grasses, that covered the face of the great Bushland, had turned  to emerald green; when a glorious season was full in view and the selectors&rsquo;  homes were happy and bright; when Morrow&rsquo;s wheat was the pride of the place and  Morrow&rsquo;s hopes were high, the people from far and wide gathered at &ldquo;Loch Ness&rdquo;  to see the wedding and to stay for the dance.</p>
<p>And such a wedding! And such a dance! It was more than a wedding&mdash;it was  more than a dance. It was a christening as well&mdash;it was two christenings. Mrs.  MacPherson, taking time by the forelock, brought her new baby to be baptised;  and old Tom Jenkins, all the way from the big scrub, came along with his only  son, whose appellation, through lack of opportunity, had been neglected for  twenty-five years, and who, however, was known as Tom, to have him christened  also.</p>
<p>And the interest that was created in the latter ceremony put the  marriage and the wedding presents and everything else in the background, and  Danny and Dulcie for the moment were forgotten.</p>
<p>The spectators crowded into the room, and swarmed round the doors and  peered in through the windows, and grinned and guffawed at Tom, who looked  nervous, and wore long hair which turned up, like fish-hooks, at his coat  collar. And, when the poor parson took the glass of water in his hand, Tom  shuddered as though he anticipated a cold shower. And while the crowd made  jocular remarks outside, Duncan McClure, inside, said in his loud, roguish way  to old Jenkins:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hae ye quite made up ye&rsquo;re mind, Mister Jenkins, what tae ca&rsquo; yer  bairn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a loud burst of merriment, in the middle of which the &ldquo;bairn&rdquo;  shook its unkempt head, and said warningly to its father, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any  other bloomin&rsquo; name but the one I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another burst of merriment followed. And when, in response to the  minister, old Jenkins, remembering the last request of his dying wife,  stubbornly murmured, &ldquo;James Thomas,&rdquo; and the bairn promptly jumped to its feet,  and, in a hoarse voice, cried defiantly, &ldquo;Now, look here, father, I&rsquo;ll take  none of that!&rdquo; the roof was nearly lifted off the house.</p>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>When the ceremonies were completed, and the kissing and the  congratulations and the breakfast all over, Duncan McClure blew up his pipes,  and the dance commenced. And they danced all through the afternoon and all  through the night.</p>
<p>And when daylight came, the doors and windows were thronged again with  grinning faces, while, in the centre of the ball-room, with one hand upraised  and the other on his hip, and while the poor parson looked on and smiled, the  burly McClure capered lightly about, hopping dexterously across and in and out  the angles of two straps (taking the place of swords) crossed on the floor,  dancing the sword dance, while for music old Mrs. McIntyre, from a corner of  the room, chanted to him in Gaelic the time-honoured refrain of &ldquo;Gillie Callum&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
