  Mr. Bailey Calls on Fleming Stone</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take a case with a girl  in it,&rdquo; Fleming Stone declared; &ldquo;a girl is an appealing object, and I hate to  be appealed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His visitor and would-be client  stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a girl,&rdquo; he said,  looking a little puzzled, &ldquo;but she isn&rsquo;t really in the case. She is my  daughter, twenty years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she involved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody is involved, but myself.  If you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Mr. Stone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want you to  do,&rdquo; the detective returned, but instead of settling himself quietly to listen,  he drummed on his chair arm with his fingers, looked out the window and back  again, uncrossed and recrossed his feet and was so positively restless that his  caller began to fidget also.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact this was what  Stone wanted. When a client was disposed to be overly self-possessed and  secretive, Stone acted the part of the angel that troubled the waters, and  stirred up a gentle, noiseless ripple of unrest that not infrequently produced  indicative reactions.</p>
<p>But in this case the reactions  were not immediately forthcoming. The object of Stone&rsquo;s scrutiny seemed to have  his own reasons for fidgeting and needed no spur of outside irritation.</p>
<p>He rose abruptly and walked slowly  the length of the long room and back again.</p>
<p>A man who bore all the outward and  ordinary signs of his calling, Owen Duke Bailey looked the part of the  successful financier that he really was.</p>
<p>Not pompous of mien, not even  self-assertive, he bore himself with simple dignity and a modest, almost shy  air, as if endeavoring to justify to his own mind his presence in these  unfamiliar surroundings.</p>
<p>He had come to Fleming Stone with  no other introduction than a few words over the telephone making this  appointment, which he had promptly kept.</p>
<p>Now, in the presence of the  detective, the prospective client was apparently embarrassed, certainly  incapable of immediate action.</p>
<p>Changing his tactics, Stone ceased  drumming and fidgeting and sat motionless while he watched Bailey move slowly  along his chosen path.</p>
<p>The long living room of the  detective&rsquo;s New York apartment was interesting in its furniture and  appointments, but Owen Bailey paid slight attention to the pictures or objects  of art as he passed them.</p>
<p>In front of a fine water color,  signed by Detaille, he paused and his face lighted up as he noticed the  beautiful work on both horse and man in The Chansseur.</p>
<p>Then he went on to the end of the  room, turned and retraced his steps. He frowned a trifle as he came upon a  picture that hung the least fraction of an inch askew. Carefully he  straightened it to exactitude, then, seeming to come to a sudden determination,  he stepped briskly up to Stone and stood in front of him as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Stone, I am not the sort  of man who falls into a blue funk, whatever that is, at the threatened approach  of a bugaboo. When I have a baffling problem I puzzle it out; when I have a  challenge, I meet it. But there are problems that cannot be solved, situations  that cannot be met. I am up against one of these, and I have come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey was again master of  himself, he seemed to have walked off his nervous hesitation in his stroll  round the room.</p>
<p>He resumed his seat and looked at  Stone thoughtfully rather than apprehensively.</p>
<p>Yet the detective saw, or thought  he saw, fear in the unwavering blue eyes, in the rather thin lips set in a  straight line above a prominent and muscular jaw, and even in the slight  quivering of the sensitive nostrils.</p>
<p>Clearly, the man was forcing an  effect of calm decision which was artificial, but which Stone felt wiser to  accept at its face value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; he returned,  his dark eyes smiling with a casual kindliness. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s get at the matter  in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men were an utter  contrast. Stone, tall, well set up, entirely at ease, had put on his most  urbane air to help his guest over what seemed about to prove the crucial  difficulty of the introduction of the problem.</p>
<p>Bailey, vacillating between a  dogged determination to state his case and an almost insuperable difficulty in  doing so, showed perhaps at his worst.</p>
<p>A trifle under average height, a  trifle under average weight, the captain of finance had little to recommend him  physically.</p>
<p>And the indecision apparent on his  plain-featured face added no hint of the strength of character which the man  really possessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old fool,&rdquo; he said,  suddenly, blurting the words out as if in surprised discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nobody like you,&rdquo;  smiled Stone, glad to strike a lighter key. &ldquo;Have you received a threatening  letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-what!&rdquo; Bailey started forward  in his chair. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too difficult,&rdquo; returned the  other, smiling. &ldquo;When you back and fill about telling your troubles, and when  you pat your pocket, every few minutes, to make sure the precious missive is  safe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, of course. I should have  known. Now, with that for a starter I think I can forge ahead. Yes, Mr. Stone,  I have had a threatening letter, and anonymous at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know big business men  paid any attention to anonymous communications. I thought they deposited them  in the waste basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big business men, or men with big  business interests may have big private interests too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true,&rdquo; Stone spoke  seriously, now. &ldquo;And is your letter concerning such?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. It is not the first I  have had. The first two did go into the waste basket, but this one&mdash;it came this  morning&mdash;is so definite, so&mdash;so terrifying, that I have brought it to you. I am  not a coward, Mr. Stone, I have never before asked aid, even of a friend. But&mdash;  well, perhaps I am growing old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me see your letter,  Mr. Bailey? You have asked me to take up your case, and naturally I want to  learn details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Here it  is. It arrived this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mailed yesterday. In New York  city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone drew the letter from its  envelope and read these lines:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I have waited a fortnight to give  you the added anguish of suspense and fear. Now, I am ready to act. Expect the  final blow at any time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have reason to think this  serious?&rdquo; Stone asked, looking straight at Owen Bailey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no reason to think  otherwise,&rdquo; was the low-spoken answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who wrote it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure. There are two men  who figured in my past life. Either of those two may have written that note, or  it may have been some one else altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the writing,  then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a certainty. It looks as  if it might be the writing of either of the two men I spoke of. But I have not  heard from either for about ten years, and I have more or less forgotten their  penmanship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a few words, Mr. Bailey, of  your life in general.&rdquo; Stone spoke crisply. &ldquo;As a business man, I am sure you  want to tackle this matter in a business like way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; and Bailey nodded. As  Stone assumed the man was more approachable in this way than by social  amenities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live in New York?&rdquo; the  detective asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a Park Avenue apartment,  but we only occupy it for a few months late in the winter. My family prefer our  summer home, and we go there in early spring and stay till after the holidays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Connecticut, just over the  border. Canterbury Ridge is the post office. Our place is Cricklemere, on Lake  Nokomis, among the foothills of the Berkshires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are staying there at  present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the children want to be there  over the holidays. They have great sport at their Christmas parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey&rsquo;s face lightened up as  he spoke of his children, and Stone felt a thrill of pity for this kindly  father who was threatened by some evil-minded foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a large family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, two sons, and a  daughter. One son is married and he and his wife are with us much of the time.  We are a most united, domestic lot, and, of course, not one of them knows that  this trouble has come to me. I&rsquo;m hoping that, somehow, it can be wiped out and  they may never hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue eyes looked at Stone with  a troubled gaze, and Bailey ran his fingers through his thin hair. His hair,  left long on top, was of that peculiar silvery shade that comes when fair hair  turns gray, and when correctly adjusted added to his dignity; but when tousled,  as he now left it, it gave him a boyish appearance, which Stone rather liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will certainly hope to wipe  out the trouble,&rdquo; the detective assured him. &ldquo;Now, let us be methodical. When  did you get the first of these missives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about three weeks ago. I  tore it into bits and threw it away, but I can repeat it almost word for word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It said, &lsquo;For reasons of my own,  I don&rsquo;t care to show myself. I am going to kill you and then disappear again.&rsquo;  That&rsquo;s all. There was no signature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frightening enough, if you took  it seriously,&rdquo; Stone commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t  think then, of the men I now have in mind. I thought it was some crank, who  would follow up with a demand for money. Then about two weeks ago, I received  another letter. It ran like this, though I may not have it word for word. &lsquo;Did  you think I have forgotten? Are you not afraid? Well, you&rsquo;d better be, for your  life hangs by a thread.&rsquo; This time, too, I tore it up, but it clung to my  thoughts. I began to wonder if it could be the work of some one I knew, some  one who had motive other than the extortion of money. But I tried hard to  forget it all, and almost succeeded, until this morning I got the note I  brought to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am not surprised at your  present disturbance, Mr. Bailey, and I think your previous dismissal of the  matter shows courage. Of course, I know, you financial magnates get this sort  of thing often, but it must be more or less alarming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is,&rdquo; Bailey spoke wearily,  &ldquo;but it is often lost sight of in the press and rush of business and frequently  it has no sequel. Now, even this latest letter may be an idle threat, but I  want advice on the subject, so I came to you. I put the thing unreservedly in  your hands, I will give you all the information possible, and I hope and trust  you can free me from my fears and apprehensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will certainly try. Now, aside  from the two men you have spoken of, and whom we will take up later, is there  no one else you can suspect of sending these letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely no one. For ten years  I have been in my present office, and associated with the same partner, Mr.  Albert Sheridan. Our firm has an A 1 rating in every respect. We are brokers  who deal in securities of only the highest order. But all that you can discover  for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are entirely friendly with  your partner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. That is, we never  disagree. Of course, we are not congenial in every respect, but as a business  partnership ours leaves nothing to be desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what ways are you, then,  uncongenial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mainly in our tastes. Sheridan is  an out-doorsy man, while I like to sit by my study fire and read or look over  my collections and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your family must be out-doorsy,  to love the country home so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are. Winter or summer,  they love the lake, the hills, the drives, the gardens, all that makes country  life worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To return to the letters. You&rsquo;ve  had only the three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in the same handwriting and  on similar paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There seems to be no attempt  at disguise of penmanship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what surprises me. The  paper, in this instance, is obviously the second half of a divided sheet of  letter paper. Doubtless the first half bore an address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I thought.  Probably a hotel address. The other two were the same. A sheet torn in two and  the second half used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decent paper, but not a superior  sort. Well, now for your suspects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely call them  suspects, yet I can think of nobody else. First there is John Kennedy. He was  killed in the war, that is, he died in a French hospital. After his death I  received a letter from him, written by the nurse, while Kennedy lay on his  death bed. In this letter he accused me of treachery and threatened to take my  life if he ever got out of the hospital, which he hoped to do. If not, the  letter was to be sent to me, all the same. He didn&rsquo;t get out, he died there,  and later, I received the letter. I have kept it all these years for it seemed  to me very curious. He had no reason to accuse me of wrong doing; I scarcely  knew his wife, which was the subject that troubled him. After his death I  helped her to get a secretarial position, but I never told her, nor any one  else, of the letter he wrote me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have that letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it with me. It is one of  the &lsquo;documents in the case.&rsquo; But first I will tell you of the other man I have  in mind. These two constitute my entire list of &lsquo;enemies&rsquo; that I know of in my  whole life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other man is Arthur Dunbar, a  much younger man than Kennedy. About four years ago, he became acquainted with  my daughter Lolly&mdash;Lolita. Now, a young woman of twenty, she was then only  sixteen and a mere child in her worldly knowledge. He made improper advances to  her, and learning about it, I kicked him out of the house. He was about to  start for Africa, on a big game hunting expedition, and he declared that on his  return he would get even with me. I was told that he said he would kill me with  as little compunction as he would kill an African lion. I have not heard of his  return, but the time he planned to be away is up, and he may be back. I have no  definite reason to suspect him, but I tell you of him, because he and Kennedy  are the only ones in the world who have threatened to kill me that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case is interesting, Mr.  Bailey,&rdquo; Stone said, with some enthusiasm, &ldquo;and I congratulate you on your  clear-cut way of telling your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can you help me?&rdquo; queried the  other. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m after. I could be brave enough in an open fight, but I  confess I am terrified at the thought that some one is waiting to waylay me and  will strike at me from ambush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go back to Kennedy. If he died  in the French hospital, how can you fear him? You don&rsquo;t believe in spooks, do  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; though the letter  said he would haunt me or curse me from his grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t. Those post mortem  curses are not really dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Bailey absently  responded to Stone&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;But it may well be that he didn&rsquo;t die after all.  Reports at that time were not always reliable. Names became mixed, and many a  man has turned up alive after being listed as dead, and the other way round,  too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old a man is this Kennedy, if  alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About my own age. I am  fifty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other chap, Dunbar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose about thirty-five, or  so. The men are very different. Kennedy is, or was, a fine chap. If he thought  me interested in his wife, it was an honest belief, and he would at once see  red, and seek to kill me. Dunbar, on the other hand is a brute. He, I am told,  has no regard for the sanctity of a girl&rsquo;s honor, but will lead them astray at  his pleasure. Oh, of course, I know all about the ways and manners of the  present &lsquo;younger generation.&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t be the father of an up-to-date family  without being initiated into all the frankness and daring of the young people  of to-day. But Dunbar is not of that sort, he is rather the type of the lounge  lizard of ten years ago. However, I kicked him out of my house, literally, and  if he still resents it, he may be after my scalp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would prefer it should be he,  rather than Kennedy,&rdquo; Stone said, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, though I don&rsquo;t see how  you know that. But I&rsquo;d rather face a belligerent big game hunter than a snake  in the grass. Yet, after all, Mr. Stone, what can we do? I&rsquo;ve told you my  suspects. It may be neither of them. I may be killed to-night, to-morrow, any  time, and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to die! I&rsquo;m looking forward to the pleasantest part of  my life. I&rsquo;m thinking of retiring from business, and spending my days in quiet  pursuits that would harm nobody. I am a good, peaceable citizen, ready to do my  part in charitable and philanthropic works. Why must I be singled out to be  murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you told the police about  this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t want to. Unless  you think it necessary. I put myself unreservedly into your hands and shall do  whatever you advise. But what could the police do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do? They could give  you armed protection, could be at your side every moment. I can only strive by  my usual methods to find out who it is who is writing you these letters. And my  discovery, if I make it, may come too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey&rsquo;s light blue eyes looked  troubled. Again he rumpled his sparse hair and again he rose and walked the  length of the room and back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But&mdash;oh, well, I  suppose like everybody else, I have come to look upon a detective as a sort of  a wizard. I expect I thought you would take these letters and at once deduce  who wrote them, and have him behind bars by nightfall. However, Mr. Stone, I  want you to have a try at it. You may put your finger on the villain at once,  and clear up the whole matter without dragging in the thick-skinned and  thick-headed gentlemen of the Force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see your old letter from  Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his pocket-book Bailey  extracted a worn looking missive.</p>
<p>Mailed in France, about ten years  ago, the letter was signed in a faltering almost illegible hand, John Kennedy.  The pages were written in a neat clear script, entirely American in character.</p>
<p>Stone read it aloud, that their  minds might travel in unison.</p>
<p class="note">Bailey: Don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know  of your miserable treachery. I know the whole story. If I ever get out of this  damned place I will make a bee line for you, wherever you may be. And I&rsquo;ll have  my revenge. I&rsquo;ll wait, I think, till you&rsquo;re at the zenith of your wealth and  power, and then I shall kill you. The nurse who is writing this for me is  protesting, but I am making her go on with it. Well, that&rsquo;s all. If I get well  I shall kill you. If I die here, this will be sent to you, and I shall curse  you from my grave so long as you live.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>John Kennedy</i></p>
<p>Stone scrutinized the letter. It  was, beyond all doubt, genuine. The French paper, postmark and the worn  appearance of the creased sheet all bore token that it was just what it seemed  to be.</p>
<p>Then the detective compared the  signature of John Kennedy with the letter just received by his client.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell,&rdquo; he declared,  &ldquo;whether this note of to-day is in Kennedy&rsquo;s hand or not. That trembling  signature doesn&rsquo;t amount to much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t an expert tell?&rdquo; asked  Bailey. &ldquo;I thought they could learn lots from handwriting nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it. But if this Kennedy  is alive, it would seem there&rsquo;s little to do but to catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey smiled quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kennedy is not so easily caught.  If it&rsquo;s John, if he is alive, then my life is indeed in danger. He is an  implacable foe, a desperate devil. He is the sort to strike first and listen to  explanations afterward. But I am hoping you can prove that it is not John  Kennedy who is hounding me. I hope you can prove it is not his handwriting on  the new letter, or prove that he is really and positively dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I assisted her to  get a good position in a Chicago firm, but I&rsquo;ve not heard from her or of her  since. Of course, John&rsquo;s idea that I took any personal interest in her was  utterly a mistake. I have many faults but making up to other men&rsquo;s wives is not  among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Bailey, I don&rsquo;t deny  you have given me a hard nut to crack. I make no promises and I hold out little  assurance that I can solve your problem. It is so vague, there is so little to  take hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet surely, Mr. Stone, you must  frequently have cases that hinge on anonymous letters with nothing at all to  guide you to a conclusion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true. Now,  eliminating for the moment, these two suspects of whom you have told me, is  there no one else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you do not think not, you  think there is. But you do not wish to put a name to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that is so,&rdquo; Bailey said,  thoughtfully. &ldquo;How about your coming up to Cricklemere for a week-end? We could  talk things over, and you could get a line on my friends and neighbors and  possibly get a clew that never would occur to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just what am I to do? I can&rsquo;t  guard you from a possible assassin, as police protection could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And I can&rsquo;t think there is a  necessity for that just yet. I don&rsquo;t believe this enemy means to strike at  once, but he is playing for time. It may be, after all, just a roundabout way  of making a money demand. He may soon inform me that for a goodly sum, he will  cease all this threatening. Remember, I&rsquo;ve no real reason to suspect the two I  spoke of. It&rsquo;s only that I can think of nobody else. Well, you&rsquo;ll come up for a  few days, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will your family think? Do  they know of this at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word. I wouldn&rsquo;t have them  know of it for anything. But I&rsquo;ll merely say you&rsquo;re a business friend of mine,  up for the week-end, and ready for some skating, tobogganing and all that, as  well as some hobnobbing by the fireside with me. We all invite whoever we  choose, and we all welcome one another&rsquo;s guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d enjoy it,&rdquo; Stone agreed, with  one of his courteous smiles. &ldquo;When shall I come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day is Thursday. I&rsquo;m going up  this afternoon. You come along to-morrow afternoon. Here, I&rsquo;ll jot down  directions. Plan to stay several days or a week. Longer, if you like it.  Cricklemere, or Cricky as my children call it, is nothing if not hospitable.  You&rsquo;ll like it, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll like my people.&rdquo; </p>

  The Family At Cricklemere</b></h2>
<p>Cricklemere, as an architectural  proposition, was open to criticism.</p>
<p>But as the home of the Bailey  family, it was comfortable and satisfactory, and, in their eyes, beautiful.</p>
<p>The house, its entrance flush with  the level lawn, was of brick and stucco, and purported to be of Tudor design.</p>
<p>Owing to some alleged Connecticut  characteristics, it had been called Nutmeg Tudor by some waggish neighbors, but  the Baileys were a good-natured lot, and didn&rsquo;t resent the jibe.</p>
<p>It faced a profusion of flower  gardens, the center of which was an Italian sunken affair, but this was so  surrounded by beds of larkspur and delphinium, dahlias and asters, that it all  blended into a great mass of color, during the color season.</p>
<p>Now, in mid December, there were  no flowers, no green, save for the conifers and laurels; but Brock, the capable  and industrious gardener, turned his attention to the greenhouses, and always  managed a supply of flowers for the home.</p>
<p>The house was very long, owing to  additions that had been attached, as extra cars are added to a train.</p>
<p>Straight through, from front to  back ran a wide hall. On the right of this was the living room, also full  length, from front to back. Next to this room, was the library, in front, and  Owen Bailey&rsquo;s study, as he liked to call it, at the back. Beyond these was a  cheerful enclosed terrace, with fireplace and many windows; a much favored spot  in winter weather.</p>
<p>The other side of the hall  provided a large dining room, with a billiard room in front of it. Next, the  drawing room, and back of that a small breakfast room.</p>
<p>Beyond these, the sun parlor, all  of glass and opening on delightful terraces, from which a few steps showed the  way down to the lake.</p>
<p>Canterbury Ledge, though shelving  enough to justify the name, was not a great ledge. It rolled away down to the  lake in a series of small ridges not at all difficult to negotiate.</p>
<p>As the lake was used at all times,  in summer by bathers, boaters, fishers, and in winter by skaters, ice-boaters  and ice-cutters, it was a source of pleasure and profit to all who lived near  it.</p>
<p>The lake was beautiful, as all  Berkshire lakes are, and its wooded banks sloped gently up and away from the  shining water.</p>
<p>All round it were homes, many of  them belonging to city people, who, like the Baileys, spent more than half the  year in this delightful country. So with congenial neighbors, it was not  surprising that many families spent the Christmas holidays there, and had great  festivity and wassail.</p>
<p>On the day he had had his interview  with Fleming Stone, Owen Bailey motored up to Cricklemere, arriving about six  o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The broker usually spent about two  days of the week at his New York office, depending on his partner and the  telephone for further exigencies.</p>
<p>He was happy, or nearly so, in his  home, surrounded by his family, every member of which he admired and adored.</p>
<p>There was his wife, Blandena, just  past the half century mark, but looking all three stipulations of fair, fat and  forty.</p>
<p>She was a kindly woman, though of  a critical disposition. Lacking entirely in business sense, she was a thorough  housekeeper, wife and mother. So thorough, indeed, that she not only held the  reins in all household affairs but drove at top speed over any obstacles that  came in her way.</p>
<p>Yet she looked placid and  unconcerned always, rather a &ldquo;mistress of herself though China fall,&rdquo; effect.</p>
<p>She loved her husband, but in a  proprietary way, and in instances where she could not rule him with her rod of  iron, she made things so uncomfortable for him that he almost wished he had let  her do the ruling.</p>
<p>Not entirely, though, for Owen  Bailey had a vein of self-esteem that now and then came to the surface,  oftenest, however, to be subdued utterly by a glance of amused disdain from his  wife.</p>
<p>The eldest son, Owen Duke Bailey,  Jr., was called Duke by way of distinguishment. Perhaps because of the title,  perhaps because of his position of eldest son, he lorded it over the entire  household, even including his mother, who idolized him. But Duke was a good-natured  chap, and unless definitely crossed in his wishes, he made no trouble for  anybody. His own way he must have, but it was so much easier to let him have it  than to combat him, that he was seldom dissatisfied with the way things went.</p>
<p>Thirty years of age, he had expressed  scorn for a business career, and declared he was a creative genius. What he was  to create had not yet been definitely decided, for though he had tried  authorship, musical composition, painting and sculpture, none of these seemed  the true medium for the expression of his creative ability.</p>
<p>He had married a beautiful girl,  tall, slender and with wonderful brunette coloring. Naturally she became known  as the Duchess, and perfectly she carried the title.</p>
<p>Parke Bailey, the second son, now  twenty-three, was a merry boy, full of mischief and always smiling. He was  supposed to work in his father&rsquo;s office, but most of the time he was on  vacation by reason of house guests or social carryings on of some sort.</p>
<p>Lolita, called Lolly, was the only  girl, and so a spoiled and petted darling of both parents. She was a charming,  witch-like young person, with topaz eyes and glinting bronze hair, which curled  all over her head like baby ringlets.</p>
<p>She kept it short, refusing to  bother with a bun at the nape of her neck, and she danced through life, making  eyes at the boys and teasing her family as occasion offered.</p>
<p>This was the Bailey family, but  another, and not altogether harmonious element in the household, was Miss  Marigold Burt, a spinster, who had been a college chum of Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She came one day to make a visit,  and had been there ever since.</p>
<p>Nobody quite knew how it had come  about, but Miss Marigold was a fixture and could no more be dislodged than the  corner stone of the house itself.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey and his wife had talked  it over and speculated as to how the intruder could be removed, but nothing  ever came of their confabs any more than from the angry outbursts which the  children gave voice to, now and then.</p>
<p>So, Miss Burt stayed on, and her  tall, gaunt figure and large strong face continued to grace the Bailey home,  whether in the country or the city.</p>
<p>Miss Burt&rsquo;s features and  expression bore a resemblance to those of George Eliot, and noting this, Lolly  at once began to call her George, and, taken up by the others, it became an  accepted nickname.</p>
<p>Marigold Burt was in no way  remarkable for any talent or trait, but she was possessed of a courage and  perseverance which can be expressed only by the word, indomitable. And a nature  of this sort can easily withstand attacks from such easy-going, good-natured  people as the Baileys.</p>
<p>But though the Baileys themselves  were good natured, the two allied members of the household were scarcely to be  described by that epithet.</p>
<p>Both Miss Burt and Mrs. Owen Duke  Bailey, Jr., were possessed of decided opinions and had no hesitancy in airing  them. This produced more or less friction and, like the continual dropping that  wears away a stone, it had begun to react on the habitual good nature of the  Baileys themselves, until the erosion became more or less evident.</p>
<p>Not that George and the Duchess  ever sided with one another. If one espoused a cause or agreed to a  proposition, the other promptly ranged herself on the other side.</p>
<p>And as, just now, there were most  weighty questions before the house, and most important matters to be decided  upon, the troubles arising from diversity of opinions were serious indeed.</p>
<p>For the matter was nothing more  nor less than the refurnishing and redecorating of Cricklemere from top to  bottom.</p>
<p>They planned to leave the country  place soon after the holidays, and the work was to be all done and everything  in order for their arrival the next summer.</p>
<p>But in order to accomplish this a  uniform plan of furnishing must be agreed upon, and as a matter of fact, every  member of the family had a distinct and different preference.</p>
<p>Blandena, who, it would be  thought, would have the casting vote, was all for Colonial effects throughout.</p>
<p>Now, Owen was for this, too, but  they differed in that Mr. Bailey wanted all the Colonial furniture to be real,  authenticated antiques, while Blandena preferred reproductions. She defended  herself by insisting that the real antiques were everlastingly dropping to  pieces and falling apart, while the beautiful reproductions were firm and well  glued and would last forever.</p>
<p>In vain the two discussed this  situation, but could not seem to agree.</p>
<p>Yet it mattered little, for Duke  declared that he proposed to have his way in this matter, as he would own and  inhabit the house long after his seniors had been gathered to the rest of the  departed ancestors.</p>
<p>Duke, mindful of the comfort of  his various clubs, voted for comfortable furniture, large, soft easy chairs,  big, roomy tables, and no gimcracks or gewgaws.</p>
<p>He scorned piecrust stands and  Chippendale highboys, and voted for plain, substantial, but well made  furniture.</p>
<p>He ran small chance, however, of  success, as the Duchess had positively decided upon Spanish furnishings  throughout, and was all set to be exceedingly disagreeable if her decision  should be upset.</p>
<p>Parke and Lolly, though vociferous  in their choice, really cared little about the matter. They clamored for their  selections, but more because they wanted to be in the fray than because they  had very strong convictions.</p>
<p>Parke stood out for French Empire  stuff, because his latest inamorata told him that was what she liked. While  Lolly said, disdainfully, that of course there was nothing used to-day, except  modernistic appointments, though she supposed no one else present knew this.</p>
<p>Then Marigold Burt threw a bomb by  declaring that after all, there was nothing so good or appropriate as staunch,  strong mission furniture. Also, she knew a firm who would let her have it at  half rates, which reduction she would share with the Baileys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mission your eye!&rdquo; remarked Lolly,  dispassionately. &ldquo;Why, George, you might as well have red plush patent rockers  and onyx tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know of those things,  Baby?&rdquo; asked her mother, smiling at her. &ldquo;They passed while you were in your  cradle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot of &rsquo;em up in the attic this minute.  I&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em brought down if George says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at this point that Owen  Bailey arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dad,&rdquo; Lolly called out.  &ldquo;Do come and settle this question. Put your foot down, for once, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; and Bailey stamped  his foot with exaggerated ferocity, in attempt to be waggish.</p>
<p>But his byplay failed to make a  hit.</p>
<p>His wife said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to  clown, Owen, it doesn&rsquo;t suit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Dad, and act the tired  but dignified business man,&rdquo; advised Duke, &ldquo;and keep out of this controversy.  Your opinions won&rsquo;t get you anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they will,&rdquo; declared Lolly,  perching on the arm of her father&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>She was his acknowledged favorite.  A sort of Oedipus complex bound her to him, and she understood him better even  than his wife did.</p>
<p>Bailey was proud of his two sons,  but he loved his daughter, even though he secretly deplored the &ldquo;younger  generation&rdquo; ways that formed so large a part of her make-up.</p>
<p>Secretly, because if he spoke his  feelings aloud he would be hooted at, he well knew. And it was one of Owen  Bailey&rsquo;s chief ends in life to avoid being hooted at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, what&rsquo;s the racket  now?&rdquo; he inquired, jovially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furncher,&rdquo; Lolly informed him, as  she twisted his long, sparse top locks into spirals and let them hang down on  his brow. &ldquo;Now, Dad, you know, you must know, being so up to date and beyond,  as you are, you must feel convinced, that the modernistic craze is the only  possible outlet for your own personality. Isn&rsquo;t that so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He quite agrees,&rdquo; she said,  though she had waited for no answer. &ldquo;He says you must all do just as I direct,  and he will pay the bills without question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Lolly,&rdquo; adjured her  mother. &ldquo;Now, Owen, this matter must be settled. Do tell the children so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, children,&rdquo; Bailey beamed  around impartially, &ldquo;as your mother says, this thing must be decided. Now, you  all know my views&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep groan from Parke  interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;For  Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t go over them again. Also, we know they&rsquo;re out of the  question. To collect enough real mahogany stuff to fill this house would take a  life time. Better loot the Metropolitan Museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better have beautiful  reproductions,&rdquo; urged Blandena. &ldquo;Just as good to look at, and better in every  other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate anything make-believe,&rdquo;  began Bailey, but Marigold Burt interrupted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t make-believe&rdquo; she  declared. &ldquo;So long as you don&rsquo;t pretend it&rsquo;s real. A copy isn&rsquo;t an imposture.  If you don&rsquo;t have Mission things I think Blandena&rsquo;s suggestion is next best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have real&mdash;&rdquo; Owen  demurred. &ldquo;Maximilian is real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A howl of laughter greeted this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is&rdquo; agreed Parke, &ldquo;and  he&rsquo;s the only real thing in the house. Must we live up to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Owen Bailey,  judicially, &ldquo;that is a really fine acquisition of mine, and I think it must be  remembered and considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They referred to a magnificent  suit of armor, which Bailey had bought at an exorbitant price while at an  auction sale in New York of Maximilian armor.</p>
<p>It was truly the real thing, and  the envy of all antiquarians who knew enough about such things to judge its  worth.</p>
<p>Bailey, who was a student, and  more or less of a scholar, revered it, and as it stood on the landing of the  great staircase, he never failed to give it a nod of approval and pride as he  passed up or down.</p>
<p>The children irreverently poked  fun at it, called it old Max, and delighted to hang their hats or coats on it,  but in their hearts they were proud of it, and enjoyed hearing connoisseurs  praise it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Bailey went on, &ldquo;having  that valuable suit of armor as a starter, we could easily get an agent to find  us some fine pieces to go with it. Then other bits could be added later&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do hush, Owen,&rdquo; said his wife.  &ldquo;You know, perfectly well, we&rsquo;re going to do nothing of that sort. As mistress  of this house, I assert my rights to dictate as to its furnishing. Any other  proposition is absurd. Therefore, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Mums,&rdquo; put in Duke,  lazily, &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s disputing your right and all that sort of thing. But, we all  know your taste isn&rsquo;t really up to to-day&rsquo;s standards and so we want to help  you, not hinder you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blandena took no offense at this,  her firstborn couldn&rsquo;t offend her, but she smiled as any mother might at a  spoiled child, and said, with her most maternal air; &ldquo;Mother knows best, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;that  those sort of things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father,&rdquo; Lolly reproached  him, &ldquo;how many times must I tell you? That sort of things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why. There&rsquo;s a lot of  things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but only one sort. Now,  remember, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll try! How many times have  you tried, always to fail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Lolly, there are  worse things in this world than mistakes in grammar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in grammar, Father, in  English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not in grammar? Aren&rsquo;t those  mistakes in grammar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there can&rsquo;t be a mistake in  grammar&mdash;oh, never mind, talk any way you want to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left the arm of his chair and  crossed the room to sit beside Parke on the couch.</p>
<p>Dejectedly, Owen Bailey looked  round the circle.</p>
<p>Nobody was looking at him. He was  a negligible quantity, merely the man who paid the bills.</p>
<p>He was, was he? Well, he&rsquo;d show  them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well give over your  discussion,&rdquo; he said, putting all his determination into his voice, and as he  had a lot of determination, it vibrated finely in his speech. &ldquo;For I&rsquo;ve made up  my mind. And I suppose as I&rsquo;m the one who is to pay for this refurbishing, it  is no more than right that I should have the deciding vote as to what I am to  pay for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A group of astonished faces looked  at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for Pops!&rdquo; cried Parke.  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d think he had it in him? But you&rsquo;ve bit off more than you can chew, this  time. You see, the mater has it all fixed up and has practically given the  order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey looked at his wife, who  nodded, smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said, laughing  at Bailey&rsquo;s surprised face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Owen, you&rsquo;ll like it when it&rsquo;s all  finished. I know you will. And as you pick up real antiques, we can dispose of  the reproductions. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a graceful wave of her hand  she dismissed the subject.</p>
<p>Miss Burt, following a habit she  had, and a very annoying one, went to the piano and began to play and sing in a  low voice, some old-fashioned songs.</p>
<p>This time it was Silver Threads  Among the Gold, a special detestation of the younger generation.</p>
<p>They stood it for a few moments,  then at a nod from Parke, and a whispered word, they broke into a loud and  rollicking jazz song, that quite drowned out the plaintive notes of Miss Burt&rsquo;s  voice.</p>
<p>She rose from the piano and stood  in front of her hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;children  were not allowed to mock at a guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they mocking at you, George,  dear? I didn&rsquo;t know it. Don&rsquo;t do it again, children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Blandena resumed her air of  peaceful indifference to the whole world.</p>
<p>Owen came over and sat by her  side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that furniture,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>She gave him a playful tap on the  arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; she said, in a stage  whisper. &ldquo;A curtain lecture later, if you like. But not now. I&rsquo;m tired of the  subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey knew as well as if she had  put it into words, that the subject was settled for all time.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t mind very much, in fact,  he cared little about the furnishings, but he was continually playing a game  with himself, a game which he never won.</p>
<p>The game was to see if he ever  could get his own way, if it ran counter the wishes of any other member of the  family.</p>
<p>He very seldom scored, and never  in a matter of any importance.</p>
<p>But he was a fond husband and an  indulgent parent, and he accepted his defeats in a philosophical spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s for dinner, Mother?&rdquo; asked  Duke, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, son. I left it to  Cooper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I&rsquo;d better see her!&rdquo; and  Duke hurried from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the boy,&rdquo; said his mother.  &ldquo;Hope there&rsquo;s something he likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not, he&rsquo;ll soon see that there  is,&rdquo; the Duchess said, smiling, for Duke&rsquo;s epicureanism was a well known trait,  and if a meal was not to his liking the family dinner table was an  uncomfortable place indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in luck,&rdquo; Bailey said, a  little wistfully; &ldquo;my tastes are never consulted as to the menu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor, down-trodden worm!&rdquo;  cried Lolly, returning to her place on his chair arm, and patting his thin  hand.</p>
<p>Although normally healthy and  hale, Bailey was a thin wisp of a man, who looked far more frail than he really  was. His usually uncertain and vacillating gestures aided this misconception,  and he seldom got credit for the force of character which was really his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worm, nothing!&rdquo; he cried, stung  by his daughter&rsquo;s compassion. &ldquo;If I want roast ox for my dinner, I can have it.  Only I&rsquo;d like to be asked my preference once in a while, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you, Daddy,&rdquo; Lolly  promised him. &ldquo;After this, I&rsquo;ll ask you every day,&mdash;if I think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Lolly,&rdquo; sung out Parke, &ldquo;if  I were a psychoanalyst, I&rsquo;d say you had a &lsquo;father fixation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; Bailey said, sternly,  &ldquo;as you know, the term psychoanalysis is tabooed in this house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad,&rdquo; Lolly groaned, &ldquo;taboo,  not tabooed. It isn&rsquo;t a verb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s an ablative  absolute! I&rsquo;ll talk as I choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you won&rsquo;t, not when your  favorite daughter is trying her darndest to trim you up pretty as to your speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, I&rsquo;ll try. Taboo,  then. But cut out the psychoanalysis. I hate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke returned, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said,  gleefully. &ldquo;It seems we&rsquo;re to have a plain dinner, as the house party comes  tomorrow. But there&rsquo;s chicken livers en brochette for a starter, and then capon  and broiled mushrooms and some cheerful salad and a spot of lemon meringue pie.  &rsquo;Twill serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother looked at him fondly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s all right, Duke,&rdquo;  she said, with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; said Parke, &ldquo;I hear the  stately tread of the Earl of Northumberland. What, think you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush up,&rdquo; said Lolly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the  mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fuller, the butler, entered with  some letters on a tray. These he gave to Owen Bailey, and departed again.</p>
<p>It was so like a stage entrance  and exit that it brought a smile to all. Indeed, so dramatic was the whole  physical effect of this pearl of butlers, that Parke had dubbed him the Earl of  Northumberland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything for me?&rdquo; clamored Lolly,  and after running hastily over the letters, to be sure there was nothing for  himself, her father handed her the lot.</p>
<p>The girl distributed them and then  scurried over to a couch by a reading lamp to devour her own correspondence.</p>
<p>Marigold Burt, again at the piano,  soft pedaled through &ldquo;Only a Pansy Blossom&rdquo; humming the words in a low tone.</p>
<p>While Owen Bailey sat silent,  thinking over his interview with Fleming Stone, and wondering what courses the  celebrated detective would pursue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The First Tragedy</b></h2>
<p>The second story at Cricklemere,  was portioned off in a series of large bedrooms, each with its own bath.</p>
<p>The great hall, which, downstairs,  ran from front to back, was, upstairs, divided across the middle, and the rear  half was Parke&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
<p>Next him, on the left, as one  entered the house, were the two rooms of Duke and his wife, and in front of  those, were two guest rooms, one of which, was occupied by Marigold Burt, the  other, empty.</p>
<p>Cross corridors giving access to  these rooms led to the main hall and staircase.</p>
<p>On the other side, over the living  room, Lolly&rsquo;s room was in front, and a guest room back. This left the rooms  over the library and Owen Bailey&rsquo;s study for himself and his wife.</p>
<p>Blandena&rsquo;s room was in front and  Owen&rsquo;s at the back, with a boudoir between.</p>
<p>A spiral staircase led from the  study up to Owen&rsquo;s bedroom, and as the study opened on the covered terrace,  Bailey had access to his rooms, if he chose, without going through the house at  all.</p>
<p>This was in no sense clandestine,  but when the place was full of racketing young people, or when his wife was  entertaining an afternoon Bridge Club, it was a relief to the retiring  disposition of the man to gain his own quarters unnoticed.</p>
<p>As a small house party was  expected the next day, to spend the week-end, the whole family went early to  bed on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Lolly, thinking of her prospective  guests, dozed and woke intermittently, then, suddenly roused to wide awake  attention, she sat up in her bed and listened.</p>
<p>Surely she had heard a car. Who  could be coming around at midnight? She wondered, she even hoped it was some of  the boys of the house party, who had come ahead of time, just for a lark.</p>
<p>She got out of bed and looked from  the front window, down on the drive.</p>
<p>A good-looking car stood there,  but there was no one in it, so far as she could see. A full moon, high in the  heavens, made the place almost as light as day. She watched the car for a few  moments, then drew back into her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; she said, to  herself. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a burglar, he sure puts on side. And if not a burglar, why  doesn&rsquo;t he ring the bell or something. It isn&rsquo;t Jack Campbell&rsquo;s car, and  anyway, he&rsquo;d throw pebbles at my window, or something like that. Guess I&rsquo;ll  take a peep outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped on a kimono and  slippers, and softly opened the door to the hall.</p>
<p>The house faced South, and  consequently all the rooms on the front side were bathed in moonlight, quite  bright enough to see everything clearly. </p>
<p>The broad staircase that came up  from the first floor, branched both ways as it neared the top. On the landing,  where the stairs branched, stood the splendid suit of armor that they called  Max.</p>
<p>It shone like silver in the  moonlight, an imposing and impressive figure.</p>
<p>They all loved it, and Lolly gazed  at it admiringly. As she looked she thought the figure seemed to move.</p>
<p>Not at all frightened, but  decidedly curious, she at once concluded the burglar was hiding behind the  armor, and it was he who moved.</p>
<p>So she stared, and in a moment,  some one came cautiously out from behind Max, and stood revealed, in the  moonlight.</p>
<p>It was Marigold Burt, and Lolly  nearly burst into laughter at sight of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old George,&rdquo; she thought;  &ldquo;whatever is she up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shrank back out of sight,  but watched Miss Burt slowly climb the stairs and disappear into her own room,  which was opposite Lolly&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of St. Michael,&rdquo;  Lolly pondered, &ldquo;what can old George be up to? Had it anything to do with that  car out front? And is the car still there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran to the window but there  was no car in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I didn&rsquo;t dream that car,&rdquo;  she went on ruminating, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t dream that I saw George, hiding behind  Max. But it&rsquo;s queer as any dream. Well, there can&rsquo;t be anything wrong going on,  unless George started to elope and suddenly thought better of it. George! It&rsquo;s  too absurd. I&rsquo;ve a notion to go to her room and ask her what&rsquo;s up. No, I&rsquo;ll  wait till morning, and have fun with her at breakfast time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she snuggled back into bed and  went to sleep at once.</p>
<p>At the breakfast table, next  morning, she found only her father and Duke.</p>
<p>Blandena and the Duchess always  had their breakfast in their rooms, and Parke was an uncertain proposition as  to time and seasons.</p>
<p>But partly because she preferred  it, and partly that her father might not run any chance of eating alone, Lolly  always came down to breakfast.</p>
<p>George usually did, too, but this  morning she had not put in an appearance.</p>
<p>With the amiable intention of  teasing her, Lolly decided to make no mention of the doings of the night until  George was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fill up all the best guest  rooms with your youngsters, Lolly,&rdquo; her father said, as he consumed the waffles  and sirup which Duke had thoughtfully ordered overnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the girl, also intent  on the waffles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting a couple of men  myself. One, a Mr. Stone, who must have a nice room, say the one next to mine.  And also Sheridan is coming. He said either last night or this morning, so  he&rsquo;ll be along any time. Give him the corner front room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then I&rsquo;ll have to take  Grace Downing in with me. I don&rsquo;t see why you always want to invite a pack of  men when I&rsquo;m throwing a house party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, dear, but&mdash;well,  they&rsquo;re coming, and they must be properly looked after. If Sheridan doesn&rsquo;t  show up you can have the room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, blah! Of course, he&rsquo;ll show  up, and anyway, by the time we know it&rsquo;ll be too late. I do wish, Dad, you&rsquo;d  show a little consideration for the rest of us, and not selfishly look out for  your own interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rank injustice, for Owen  Bailey was always considerate of others and seldom obtruded his own wishes or  plans on the family circle.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was patient under  their tirades, and almost invariably bent his desires to theirs. If,  occasionally he put his foot down, he took it up again quickly, at the behest  of his wife or children, especially Lolly.</p>
<p>Indeed, she would probably have  talked him into giving up the guest rooms in question to her convenience and  allowing his friends to put up on the third floor, where the rooms were  attractive, though smaller than those below.</p>
<p>But their conversation was  interrupted by the entrance of the parlor maid, Agnes Ames, whose white face  and quivering lips betokened disaster of some sort.</p>
<p>This girl had been aptly described  by Duke as beautiful but dumb.</p>
<p>Her face was exquisite in its  contour and coloring. Heart-shaped, Duke said it was, but Parke called her  Kitten-face.</p>
<p>Not to her, of course; the Baileys  were not the sort to take any personal interest in a servant, so Agnes, though  lovely to look at was not looked at, save in her true relation.</p>
<p>Her hair was pure golden, with a  soft, natural curl; her eyes of deepest violet were wide set, and fringed with  incredibly long lashes. Her pink cheeks and pearly teeth were alluring, or  would have been if the girl had had one spark of responsiveness, or even  intelligence.</p>
<p>She looked and was absolutely  dumb, in the sense of paying no attention to and taking no interest in anything  that went on around her. Mrs. Cooper the cook, declared she couldn&rsquo;t make her  out. She had no realization of her own beauty, and no least trace of vanity or  pride.</p>
<p>When the Duchess first came into  the family, about two years ago, she kept sharp watch on her husband to see if  he ever gave Agnes a sly glance.</p>
<p>But she soon proved to her own satisfaction,  that Duke paid no more attention to the girl than if she had been plain. She  was not about much, but always ready when summoned. In addition to her duties  as parlor maid, she acted more or less as a personal maid to Mrs. Bailey and  Lolly. Martha preferred to look after her own belongings.</p>
<p>It was a standing joke among the  Baileys that young men, when guests at Cricklemere, sometimes tried to flirt  with the dumb beauty. But, as they afterward acknowledged, one might as well  try to cajole the suit of armor on the stairs. Agnes showed no more  responsiveness than Max would.</p>
<p>She appeared now in the breakfast  room door, her face, for perhaps the first time in their knowledge of it,  showing emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she breathed, in a whisper,  &ldquo;oh, please, Miss Lolly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Agnes,&rdquo; said Lolly, staring  at her, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bailey&mdash;Mrs. Bailey&mdash;she&rsquo;s  dead!&rdquo; the last words came out in a shriek, and the terrified girl, turned and  fled to the kitchen to the shelter of kindly Mrs. Cooper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Duke said, rising,  &ldquo;something has scared the little fool. But I&rsquo;ll go and see what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raced up the stairs two at a  time, and knocked at the door of his mother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Getting no answer, he opened the  door, but there was no one there. The bed covers were thrown back, but the room  was empty.</p>
<p>Duke tapped on the closed door  that led to the boudoir, but again there was no response.</p>
<p>By this time Mrs. Cooper had come  up, and met Duke in the hall outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bailey is in Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s  room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Agnes told me. Will you look in there, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cooper had been with the  Baileys over twenty years and Duke was the apple of her eye. As a boy she made  cookies and turnovers for him, and even now, her greatest joy was in his praise  of the viands she prepared.</p>
<p>Quickly Duke turned the knob of  his father&rsquo;s bedroom, and strode in. On the bed, robed in gay colored silk  pajamas, lay the body of Blandena Bailey, with the hilt of a dagger protruding  from her back.</p>
<p>Duke stopped still and gazed for a  moment at the awful sight.</p>
<p>The body lay in a natural  position, on its side, one arm beneath the head the other, outside the  coverlets.</p>
<p>The face was calm and the eyes  closed, as if she had died in her sleep.</p>
<p>The dagger, a handsome, ornate  thing, showed clearly against the sheets. It had been driven to the hilt in the  middle of Blandena&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Duke&rsquo;s eyes turned at once toward  a group of trophies on the wall. These weapons had been there for years, a  favorite possession of Owen Bailey&rsquo;s, who liked to collect odd bits of arms or  armor.</p>
<p>Obviously enough, one of the  daggers was missing from the wall, and though not entirely familiar with his  father&rsquo;s curios, Duke had no doubt the dagger in his mother&rsquo;s back had been  taken from the wall for its deadly purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touch her, Cooper,&rdquo; he whispered,  feeling he could not do it himself. &ldquo;Is she surely dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir,&rdquo; said the matter of  fact, though sympathetic Cooper. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s stone cold,&mdash;poor thing. Agnes said she  was. Who&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, of course. You stay here,  Cooper, till we can get the doctor up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke went downstairs more slowly  than he had come up. It was easy enough to say he&rsquo;d tell his father, but a  harder thing to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, what&rsquo;s the  matter?&rdquo; Lolly cried, as he entered the breakfast room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, son?&rdquo; said  Bailey, gently, as Duke seemed unable to reply. &ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;d seen a  ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if, Dad, not like,&rdquo; said  Lolly, half absently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you that many times&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush up, Loll,&rdquo; Duke cried,  his nerves giving way, &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s dead&mdash;killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Bailey started up from his  chair, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that, Father,&rdquo; Duke said,  his voice shaking. &ldquo;Somebody has&mdash;has killed her with a dagger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dagger!&rdquo; for a moment Owen  Bailey looked almost as imbecile as the maid, Agnes.</p>
<p>Then, for he possessed a wonderful  power of hiding his own emotion and sinking his own inclinations, he quickly  left the room.</p>
<p>He hurried across the larger  dining room, through the hall and up the stairs going directly to his own  bedroom.</p>
<p>The faithful Cooper stood at the  foot of the bed, her hands before her eyes to shut out the awful sight.</p>
<p>At sound of her master&rsquo;s step, she  looked up and saw him, as he stood looking at his dead wife, his clenched  hands, the knuckles showing white, testifying to the grip he had on himself.</p>
<p>Indeed, so filled with horror and  sorrow was he, that he well knew if he let himself go an inch he would go all  to pieces. He must, he told himself, forget his own feelings and do what he  could for his loved ones who were left to him.</p>
<p>He held out an arm as Lolly  entered, and after one glance at her mother, the girl fell into her father&rsquo;s  embrace and gave way to deep sobs.</p>
<p>Duke went to tell his wife about  it, and, after a moment or two, Owen Bailey gently led Lolly from the room. He  took her to her own room and bade her lie down for a time.</p>
<p>Then he telephoned Fenn, the  family doctor, asking him to come at once.</p>
<p>Then, his hand on the knob of  Parke&rsquo;s door, he faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must go through with it,&rdquo;  he told himself. &ldquo;I must carry on till the authorities come, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though well known as an organizer  and a director in his business relations, Owen had little experience of that  sort in his home life. His suggestions were invariably rejected or ridiculed by  the family. His help, if offered, was refused on the grounds that he was not  competent. His wishes were seldom considered at all, and almost never granted.</p>
<p>He had become accustomed to this  and only once in a great while did he resent it.</p>
<p>But now, this sudden thrusting  upon him of grave responsibilities, found him a little frightened, a good deal  embarrassed, but aware of a dogged determination to do what was clearly his  duty.</p>
<p>He went into Parke&rsquo;s room, waked  him up and told him in a straightforward way what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; demanded Parke, not  quite awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said his father,  gently. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll find out, my boy, and justice shall be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; agreed Parke, getting  more fully awake. &ldquo;Go along, Dad, I&rsquo;ll dress and come down in a jiffy. I want  to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I depend on you and  Duke for assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he left Parke he bethought  himself of Miss Burt.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like the woman, never  had liked her, and he found himself hoping that now Blandena was gone, she  would betake herself away from the Bailey home. Still his sense of right  decreed that Miss Burt be made acquainted with the tragedy, so he tapped at  Lolly&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>She opened it, red eyed and  disheveled looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child,&rdquo; he said, drawing her  to him, &ldquo;bathe your eyes and come on downstairs. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll feel better to  be with us all, than up here, grieving alone. And, will you help me, daughter,  by telling Miss Burt about it? It is right she should know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I will, Dad. I&rsquo;m a  coward to stick up here. There&rsquo;s lots to do. I must call off the party and all  that. Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell George, and I&rsquo;ll soon come down, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my brave girl. Don&rsquo;t give  way, if you can help it. But on the other hand don&rsquo;t try too hard to control  yourself. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing, and it&rsquo;s nearly killing me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Daddy,&rdquo; Lolly patted his  lean, haggard cheek. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> brave underneath. I always knew it. Well, I&rsquo;ll be  down soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned back into her room and  closed the door.</p>
<p>Bailey went on downstairs and met  the doctor coming up.</p>
<p>Turning, he took the medical man  to the room where the body of Blandena lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clean, swift drive,&rdquo; Doctor  Fenn declared, after some examination. &ldquo;What is she doing in here? This is your  bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bailey said. &ldquo;But always at  the full moon time, Blandena slept in here and I slept in her bed. Her windows  face the South, and the moon shining at the full, kept her awake nights. So she  usually, unless it was rainy weather, spent two or three nights in here every  full moon. We were so accustomed to this habit, we thought nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she is wearing your pajamas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey looked at the garment in  question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;She did,  sometimes. She&rsquo;s large, you know, in fact, a bit heavier than I am, and if I  had a set of pajamas that she admired, or liked the quality of the silk, or that,  she didn&rsquo;t hesitate to adopt them. We were like that, you know, small  intimacies and jokes. She would laugh like a child when she cribbed my favorite  belongings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Doctor Fenn nodded, &ldquo;she  was like that. Well, Bailey, the police must be called, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Will you do it?  I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m about at the end of my rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor chap, it all comes on you, I  suppose. Where are the young people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dressing, mostly. But I&rsquo;ll go  through with it all, Fenn. I don&rsquo;t want to bother the children. And they  couldn&rsquo;t help anyway. Unless Duke&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll do anything he can. Who could have  done this thing? And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey&rsquo;s pale blue eyes and white,  drawn face told Fenn how the man was suffering and he said, kindly;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on downstairs. Take another  cup of coffee, or something stronger, if you prefer. I&rsquo;ll have Mrs. Cooper stay  here till the police arrive, then she will be relieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey went on downstairs, pausing  a moment as he passed Maximilian. He patted the back of one steel gauntleted  hand, a favorite gesture of his, and went on quite unconscious of his action.</p>
<p>Reaching the hall, he turned off  into the living room, and passed through that to his study.</p>
<p>Here he took up his private  telephone and called Fleming Stone.</p>
<p>Getting the connection, he told  Stone in a few words what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you told any one else of  what you told me yesterday?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a soul. The local police  haven&rsquo;t come yet, but I don&rsquo;t propose to confide in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t. Shall I continue to  hold the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want you to, more than  ever. It&rsquo;s a different case now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell you over the  telephone. But I wish I&rsquo;d gone along with you last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to Heaven you had! This  might have been prevented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this conversation is  useless. Keep your own counsel as much as you can. Though, of course, you&rsquo;ll  have to answer questions. Don&rsquo;t antagonize the official detective. He won&rsquo;t  like my interference, you know, but if you still want me, I&rsquo;d be glad to go on  with the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do want you. I suppose  as things are now, you&rsquo;ll come in your own personality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;ll use my own name,  of course. But I doubt if your family or your guests will know who I am.  Needn&rsquo;t say much about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. What time will you  come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as I can make it.  I&rsquo;ll come in my own car, and drive myself. You can put me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. Good-by, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey turned from the instrument  to find Lolly looking and listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your friend, Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone, a private detective,  who is coming down to look into this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey rarely told an  untruth, and never unless, in his opinion, absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him. He&rsquo;s a  super-detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so I&rsquo;m told. Don&rsquo;t advertise  it, Lolly, Mr. Stone prefers the police should know no more than they have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dad. Trust me. But  I&rsquo;ve a story to tell. There was a car outside the house last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A car? Whose? At what time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Long about midnight. Dunno what  make, but it was a smart, first class car, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The murderer, I suppose. I mean,  I suppose he came in it. There was no one in it when I saw it. At that time he  must have been in the house. Didn&rsquo;t you hear anything, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sound, dear. But, you know  I sleep with my deaf ear up, and so it takes a loud sound to wake me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. Were both the  boudoir doors shut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. I know the one into  the room I slept in was shut. It&rsquo;s full moon, you know, so your mother took my  room for a few nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. She always does&mdash;did.  And she had on your pajamas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she frequently wore them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder. They&rsquo;re stunning,  and fitted her perfectly. But, Dad&mdash;I have a theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it to me, Puss, but don&rsquo;t go  airing theories to the police, you&rsquo;ll get yourself laughed at. Wait a moment.  Did you tell Miss Burt, as I asked you to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She nearly fainted. And that  reminds me, Dad. Last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a talk later, dear. I  see the police coming, and I must meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Daddy, wait just a sec till I  tell you my theory. Couldn&rsquo;t it be that as mother was in your bed, and wearing  your pajamas, and her hair is short and about the color of yours&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t it be  that the murderer was really gunning for you, and killed her thinking she was  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey looked at his  daughter. Hoyden though she often was, Lolly now looked grave and serious. Her  great topaz eyes gazed into her father&rsquo;s face, and she waited, breathless, for  his reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s  thought. &ldquo;Yes, Lolly, I agree with your theory. At least, I agree that it is a  possibility, for I can think of no reason why anybody should want to kill your  mother.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Vengeance Is Mine</b></h2>
<p>Owen Bailey remained in his study,  and the sheriff was brought to him there by Fuller.</p>
<p>The butler, more than ever,  assumed his lordly manner, and ushered the men into the room with superb  condescension.</p>
<p>Fuller was greatly perturbed. It  was not in his scheme of things to have murder committed in the household to  which he belonged, and the coming of the police was most disconcerting.</p>
<p>For the sheriff was accompanied by  two other men, who proved to be the local constable and a smart young detective  sergeant.</p>
<p>Sheriff Hunter was spokesman. He  was a pompous sort, quite evidently feeling the dignity and responsibility of  his position, but not quite certain what to do about it.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he had never  been called upon to look after a murder case before, and he was a trifle vague  as to the proper procedure, also as to the attitude he ought to take toward the  family.</p>
<p>Bailey, himself nervous and  anxious, felt a wave of reaction at sight of Hunter&rsquo;s embarrassment, and  bravely took the initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A terrible thing has happened,  Sheriff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and while, of course, you&rsquo;ll have to pursue your usual  routine, I want to ask you to spare my family as much as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly, Mr. Bailey,  I understand.&rdquo; Sheriff Hunter was a typical country politician of what has been  called the cracker-box school. He had ambitions, and he looked to the  influential citizens of his county for help. He had no least desire to  antagonize or to trouble them, and he was more than willing to accede to any  wish Mr. Owen Bailey might express.</p>
<p>A big, raw-boned chap he was,  uncouth of manner and awkward of mien. His shrewd, small eyes were gray, and  looked out from under bushy eyebrows that would have been better for a  trimming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I understand,&rdquo; he  repeated, more to convince himself than his hearers, for his understanding was  a limited one. &ldquo;You mean me to question you instead of your children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so far as you can  conscientiously do that, that is what I mean,&rdquo; agreed Owen Bailey. &ldquo;If you have  to talk to them, you must do so, but let me bear the brunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I see. That&rsquo;s your  fatherly instinct. Yes, yes. Now, you see, we have here Constable Leary, you  know him, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;re old friends,&rdquo; and  Bailey gave a faint smile and nod toward the constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And also,&rdquo; Sheriff Hunter spoke  with some pride, &ldquo;we have Sergeant Detective Whitney,&mdash;he&rsquo;s from Hartford, just  happened to be around here, and he&rsquo;s going to take hold of the case. It&rsquo;ll go  hard with the villains who did this terrible thing when Whitney gets on their  trail. We&rsquo;re lucky to have his help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here, Sergeant,&rdquo;  Bailey said, in a weary voice, &ldquo;and I do hope you can clear up the mystery and  put your hand on the criminal in short order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hoping a lot, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo;  the young man said, shaking his head. &ldquo;A murder mystery is not often cleared up  quickly,&mdash;sometimes not at all. But we&rsquo;ll do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney was an intelligent looking  lad, whose earnest brown eyes betokened sincerity of purpose and a determined  perseverance. His square, firm jaw was indicative of stubbornness, but a quick,  ready smile redeemed his countenance from severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bailey, still with  that weary, harassed air, &ldquo;get busy, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Owen Bailey&rsquo;s  mind was full of uncertainty about the impending arrival of Fleming Stone. He  didn&rsquo;t want to apprise these local police as yet, that he had engaged a private  detective, and yet, he had no wish to conceal such an important fact.</p>
<p>Yet he felt sure it would please  Stone better if he came unannounced, and after that Bailey could follow his  advices.</p>
<p>So, trusting that the present  examination would not call for definite disclosures that he was unwilling to  make, Owen Bailey settled himself for the ordeal. Constable Leary, feeling a  trifle left out, spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we should  first view the body and the scene of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; said Bailey,  rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Whitney said, &ldquo;we must get a  little information first. Let me put a few questions. Mr. Bailey, when did you  see your wife alive last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last evening, about eleven  o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the time you retired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We all went upstairs about  eleven. My wife and I have rooms in the East end of the house, hers is the  Southeast corner room, and mine the Northeast. There is a boudoir between.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mrs. Bailey was sleeping in  her room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It was always her habit to  change rooms with me during the three or four nights of the full moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because her windows, facing South,  let in such a flood of bright moonlight that it kept her awake. She didn&rsquo;t like  drawn curtains, so we simply changed rooms during the full of the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Invariably?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, usually. If it was a rainy  spell or cloudy nights, she stayed in her own room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And last night she  occupied your room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she did the night before  last also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Bailey, may we not  wonder whether the murderer did not intend his dreadful act to be directed  against yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly may. In fact, I  think myself that was the case. For I cannot imagine any one being desirous of  killing my wife. Mrs. Bailey had no enemies, she was beloved by all who knew  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless. And have you any  enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard question to answer.  I suppose no man can reach middle life without knowing some men he cannot  number among his friends. But there is no one I can definitely or positively  suspect of wanting to kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been a burglar,&rdquo;  Hunter put in, &ldquo;it probably was. Then, when he was surprised to find Mrs.  Bailey in that room, and when, as is likely, she tried to scream, he killed  her. What was the weapon used, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dagger, which was taken from a  trophy on the wall of my bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trophy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that I mean a semicircle of  ornamental daggers, fastened to the wall. They are of various designs and are  of value as curios.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the dagger used was wrenched  from its fastenings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not wrenched, merely lifted from  the two small hooks that held it in place. But here comes Doctor Fenn, will you  not refer this matter to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mercifully Fenn appeared then, and  was quite willing to spare Owen Bailey the pain of describing the stroke that  killed his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the doctor said; &ldquo;Mrs.  Bailey was stabbed with a sharp dagger, about eight inches long. It passed  between two ribs, straight to the heart and death was instantaneous. Doubtless  it occurred while she slept, and she had no knowledge of an assailant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t a burglar,&rdquo;  declared Hunter. &ldquo;Or at least, not a burglar alarmed for his safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were any valuables taken, Mr.  Bailey?&rdquo; asked Hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge, but I  haven&rsquo;t made a thorough search. However there was little or nothing of much  value in my bedroom. My wife kept her jewelry in a safe in the boudoir, and my  pearl studs and such of my belongings as could be called jewelry were also in  that. Outside of that, I think there was nothing in my room worth stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The antique daggers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are valuable to a  connoisseur or collector of such things, but they have small intrinsic value.  And anyway, I think they are undisturbed, save for the one that was used&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey paused abruptly,  evidently at the thought of the use the dagger was put to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us visit the room,&rdquo; said  Whitney. &ldquo;We can judge more intelligently then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I go with you?&rdquo; asked  Bailey, and noting his haggard face and trembling hands, Hunter said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not necessary, sir.  Will you await us here?&rdquo; Bailey nodded assent and the investigators left the  room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find their way,&rdquo; Doctor  Fenn said, as Bailey looked inquiringly at him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about them. Who  do you think did the thing, Owen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anybody. But I  suppose,&mdash;I have to suppose the attack was meant for me. Poor Blandena, to take  the stroke intended for me! I can&rsquo;t stand it, Fenn, I&rsquo;m all in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but you&rsquo;ve got to  stand it, you&rsquo;ve got to face it all. There will be bothers, Lord knows, but  after all, no one in the house can be suspected. Be thankful for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am, of course, but&mdash;who  will,&mdash;who can be suspected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An outsider,&mdash;some marauder, after  loot, doubtless. They&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A marauder wouldn&rsquo;t stab, even  supposing he thought he was stabbing me, without any provocation. If he was  after the jewelry, he must have known where the safe was&mdash;they say they always  do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they say so, but&mdash;oh, well,  I&rsquo;m no detective. Here they come back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three policemen trooped into  the room again. &ldquo;A strange case,&rdquo; declared Whitney. &ldquo;The lady was wearing a  man&rsquo;s pajamas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bailey, and once more  explained that unusual feature of the case</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that, then,&rdquo; said  Whitney, &ldquo;but it makes it all the more likely that the killer thought he was  striking at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Bailey responded. &ldquo;I  think that, too. Now to find out who he was. There is surely no one in Canterbury  Ledge who bears me ill will enough for such a deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor anywhere else,&rdquo; put in Doctor  Fenn. &ldquo;Take it from me, Sheriff, Mr. Bailey has no enemy who would do such a  thing. He is a most friendly man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; declared Constable  Leary. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known the family ever since they settled here. I&rsquo;ve seen the  children grow up, and a better, happier family I&rsquo;ve never known. Now, mark my  words, the killer was an intruder, who had other motives than murder. That came  about of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, of itself?&rdquo;  demanded Hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, he was scared into it,  maybe by a noise, maybe by a sort of caution but it was unpremeditated. He just  suddenly grabbed that dagger from the wall and jabbed it into his victim. Maybe  he thought it was Mr. Bailey, and maybe he didn&rsquo;t. Anyway, it was  unpremeditated and so, he didn&rsquo;t come here with murder in his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we can&rsquo;t be sure that Mrs.  Bailey was not awake,&rdquo; said Whitney. &ldquo;She may have opened her eyes and,  frightened at what she saw, quickly closed them again, and then received her  death blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you search the room?&rdquo; asked  Bailey. &ldquo;Did you find any clew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We searched it thoroughly,&rdquo;  Hunter said. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take long. And we found only one thing, which may or  may not be a clew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff held out a small strip  of metal, perhaps three inches long by half an inch wide. It was neatly shaped,  with curved ends and it bore, in raised letters, the words, <i>Vengeance is Mine</i>.</p>
<p>They all recognized it as a slip  of aluminum, stamped by an apparatus sometimes found in ferry houses or  Elevated stations, but more often at the pleasure beaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know these machines were  to be found now,&rdquo; said Doctor Fenn, gazing at the small strip. &ldquo;I thought they  were out of date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some left,&rdquo; Whitney  told him, &ldquo;especially at Coney Island and such places. And anyway, this needn&rsquo;t  have been made lately, it may be an old affair. Know anything about it, Mr.  Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bailey returned, shaking his  head. &ldquo;I used to cut them out for the children, but that was years ago. I  haven&rsquo;t seen a stamping machine like that of late. But I don&rsquo;t go to Coney  Island. Where was this thing found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the chiffonier, beside the  brushes. It was not hidden, yet neither was it very conspicuous. Now, since you  know nothing of this, and if your people also have no knowledge of it, it is  fairly probable it was left by the murderer, on purpose. If so, it is a  message, and if a message, I think it is far more likely it refers to Mr.  Bailey than to Mrs. Bailey. I may be all wrong, but it is imaginable that a  murderer should wreak vengeance on a man, though hardly on a woman. My theory  is that the man had a grievance and came here intending to kill Mr. Bailey. He  made a mistake, whether he knew it or not, and he went away, leaving this  message behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, he brought this with him,&rdquo;  said Hunter. &ldquo;And if that is so, the murder was premeditated. You&rsquo;re forging  ahead too fast, Whitney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; the  detective said, with his amiable smile. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Bailey, I assure you we will  be most discreet and tactful, but we will have to interview the other members  of the family. You may be present or not, as you prefer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d rather stay, I may be of  help to them in some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the affable detective found  his plans somewhat rudely upset by the advent of a new element.</p>
<p>Coroner Hale presented himself,  armed at all points and terrible as an army with banners.</p>
<p>He breezed into the room, and his  frowning face tacitly accused everybody present of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t I called sooner?&rdquo; he blustered.  &ldquo;Hunter, why didn&rsquo;t you notify me at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the imperturbable  sheriff. &ldquo;I sent Bill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bill! You might as well have  sent a mud turtle, it would make better time! Well, what have you done to  boggle up the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Doctor Hale,&rdquo; broke in  Owen Bailey&rsquo;s placating voice, &ldquo;these gentlemen have been very kindly and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have, have they? Well,  perhaps I shan&rsquo;t be so kindly! A murder case is not a kindergarten. Tell me  what you have learned, or think you have learned.&rdquo; Sheriff Hunter, entirely  unmoved by the coroner&rsquo;s fiery temper, told him in a few terse phrases just  what they had discovered. He voiced no theories, no opinions, but he stated the  facts with a directness that left the coroner no chance to criticise the recital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; he said,  hastily, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve done, it amounts to nothing, but perhaps you  have done no great harm. Mr. Bailey, whom do you suspect of having committed  this dastardly crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey, terribly upset  already, was almost thrown into a panic by this onslaught, and stared at the  coroner, with shaking hands clutching his shaking knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, sir, answer my  question. Surely that&rsquo;s not difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Bailey  suddenly faced the music, as was his way when cornered. &ldquo;It is easily answered,  as I have no slightest idea who the criminal is or can possibly be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t know  anybody who has it in for you, eh? For, after all I&rsquo;ve just heard, I make no  doubt the fatal blow was meant for you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may well be,&rdquo; agreed Bailey,  mildly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said myself it&rsquo;s much more likely that it was meant for me than  for my wife. But as to the identity of the marauder, I can form no opinion  whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the coroner, &ldquo;I wish  you could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you do,&rdquo; said Whitney,  dryly. &ldquo;It would help you a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale turned to glare at him, but  said no word of reply. Instead, he turned to Owen Bailey, and demanded that his  eldest son be sent for.</p>
<p>Soon Duke appeared, looking  handsome, debonair and very much at his ease. The sight of his attitude seemed  to act as a tonic to his father, who immediately sat up straighter and let a  look of courage steal into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were, I understand, the first  one to see your mother after her death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All wrong,&rdquo; returned Duke,  pleasantly; &ldquo;nothing like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. There may  have been any number. The first one I know of was our parlor maid, named  Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Agnes in,&rdquo; thundered the  coroner.</p>
<p>The maid was summoned, and came  slowly and shrinkingly into the room.</p>
<p>She was pitiably shy, frightened  and embarrassed, yet her beautiful face and exquisite little figure were as  lovely as ever.</p>
<p>Her hands were clasped to her  breast, and her great violet eyes seemed to implore kindness and gentle dealing.</p>
<p>Yet save for the detective  Whitney, no one gave the girl a sympathetic look. So far as the two Bailey men  were concerned, they paid no slightest attention to her, while the police only  looked upon her as a sort of curiosity, and Doctor Fenn merely looked on with  an amused interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found the body of your  mistress?&rdquo; the coroner shot at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; and the frightened hands  fluttered like broken-winged birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet. Control yourself.  Tell of the finding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to defy this monster, Agnes  did her best to obey him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went up with her coffee,&rdquo; she  began, and now, though faint, her voice was steady. &ldquo;I knew she was in Mr.  Bailey&rsquo;s room, because she was there yesterday morning. She sleeps there at the  full of the moon. I went in without knocking, those are my orders, and I saw  Mrs. Bailey in the bed. At first, I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;didn&rsquo;t notice anything, and I  touched her shoulder to wake her up. Those are my orders. Then I felt her  cold&mdash;I could feel it through the silk&mdash;and then, I saw&mdash;I saw the knife in her back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she facing you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. She was on her side  like, and turned over a little frontwards besides. Like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agnes, put her head down on her  hands, and rolled it a little sideways, indicating the position of Mrs.  Bailey&rsquo;s head on the pillow.</p>
<p>So beautiful she looked that  Whitney fairly caught his breath, but no one else seemed to notice the picture  she made.</p>
<p>Nor was the girl self-conscious.  It was plain to be seen she had no intention of creating a sensation. She was  intent on telling her story as that terrible coroner wanted and expected her  to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what did you do?&rdquo; went on  the harsh, inexorable voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went straight downstairs to get  somebody, anybody, to come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you found&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bailey and Mr. Duke and Miss  Lolly were all in the breakfast room. I just told them Mrs. Bailey was dead,  and then I went to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell Mrs. Cooper. I always  tell her everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do. Go, and send in  Mrs. Cooper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the cook arrived, the coroner  tried his ferocious glare on her, but the self-possessed woman failed to cringe  under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell what you know of the finding  of Mrs. Bailey, this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir. The maid Agnes  came running to the kitchen saying that the mistress was dead. I scarcely  thought it was true, I thought maybe she had fainted. But I hurried up to her  room, and in the hall I saw Mr. Duke, who had come upstairs. I told him Mrs.  Bailey was in Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s room and we went in there. The poor lady was dead,  with a dagger sticking out of her back. That&rsquo;s all I know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you, Mr. Duke Bailey. What  did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked at my mother, and I  asked Mrs. Cooper to touch her,&rdquo; he shuddered, &ldquo;and she did. She said my mother  was dead, and the sight of the dagger left small room for doubt of that fact. I  left Mrs. Cooper there and went downstairs and told my father. We sent for  Doctor Fenn and he sent for the police. That&rsquo;s all, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whom do you suspect of the  deed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no reason to suspect any  one. I know of no one who would wish to kill my mother, nor do I know of any  one who would desire my father&rsquo;s death. I say this, for it has been suggested  that the criminal may have thought it was my father who occupied that room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly was called then, and Parke  came in with her. The coroner raised no objections to the boy&rsquo;s presence, so he  stayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear any unusual noise in  the night?&rdquo; Hale asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Parke replied, &ldquo;but I sleep  like a log, and I never hear anything in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; put in Lolly. &ldquo;I heard  the murderer come and I saw his car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner whirled on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did! How do you know it was  the murderer&rsquo;s car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose else could it have been? We  don&rsquo;t have callers at midnight, and this was about twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see this car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parked out on the drive, in front  of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty conspicuous place for a  murderer to leave his car. Was no one in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when I saw it. He must have  been in the house then. When I looked out again, it was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing in the  meantime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Doing? Why,&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;nowhere in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where? Just where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I peeked out in the hall to  see if there was anything going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was. What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell the truth,  Miss, or you&rsquo;ll find yourself in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, dear,&rdquo; said her  father, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought I saw somebody on  the stairs, but when I looked again there was nobody there. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Fleming Stone Looks For Clews</b></h2>
<p>The Earl of Northumberland  answered a ring at the front doorbell.</p>
<p>Outside stood a tall,  distinguished looking man who eyed the butler appraisingly.</p>
<p>Fuller realized at once that this  visitor was not greatly impressed by his courtly manner, and he said,  respectfully, &ldquo;Will you come in, sir? Do you wish to see Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone,  entering. &ldquo;Are the police here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fuller smothered a gasp. Who was  this, who knew of the tragedy without being told?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. They are all in the  study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me there, then,&rdquo; and Fleming  Stone gave his coat and hat to a footman, who appeared opportunely.</p>
<p>He followed Fuller across the big  living room, to the study, where Fuller tapped at the closed door.</p>
<p>Constable Leary opened it, and  seeing a stranger, was about to close it again.</p>
<p>But Stone stepped forward, and  going straight to Owen Bailey, held out his hand.</p>
<p>Bailey rose to greet him, with an  effort. The man looked so dejected and forlorn, that even the arrival of the  celebrated detective seemed to have no encouraging effect upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Stone,&rdquo; he said, in a  dull, strained voice. &ldquo;Mr. Fleming Stone of New York City. He is here to visit  me, and will take charge of the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take charge of the case!&rdquo;  repeated Coroner Hale, unable to believe his ears. &ldquo;Hardly that, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Stone smiled slightly.  &ldquo;I think Mr. Bailey spoke thoughtlessly. What he means is, I&rsquo;m sure, that since  I am here, and I came for other reasons, I shall be glad to be of any help I  can to you who have the case in charge. You are the coroner, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hale, mollified more  by Stone&rsquo;s manner than his words. &ldquo;And this is Mr. Hunter, Sheriff of the  county, and Detective Sergeant Whitney, from Hartford. Also, Police Constable  Leary, of this village.&rdquo; Stone acknowledged the introductions courteously and,  sitting down beside Bailey, asked that the investigation be continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want next to talk to young Mr.  Bailey&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; Hale declared. He had taken the matter out of Hunter&rsquo;s hands  entirely, for which that worthy was profoundly grateful.</p>
<p>Whitney, the young detective, said  nothing, but his alert eyes and intelligent face showed that he was missing no  point of the inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure my wife is  downstairs yet,&rdquo; Duke said, indifferently. &ldquo;We never disturb her until she  comes down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Hale&rsquo;s voice  was sharp. &ldquo;Well, this morning will be an exception. Call her here at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his tone stirred  Lolly to action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for her,&rdquo; she  volunteered, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss, you stay right where  you are,&rdquo; Hale told her. &ldquo;Leary, go outside and get some one to fetch the  lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable obeyed, and Stone  spoke, in his most suave tones;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I have the main facts,  Sheriff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hale will tell you, he&rsquo;s the  coroner,&rdquo; returned Hunter, who was ill at ease in the presence of the city  detective.</p>
<p>The coroner, quickly ran over the  bare facts of the finding of Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s body, and Owen Bailey looked  piteously at Stone.</p>
<p>He wanted to say, &ldquo;You came too  late,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wish you had been here sooner,&rdquo; but a look of warning in Stone&rsquo;s  eyes made him understand no word was to be spoken until they could be alone.</p>
<p>After what seemed a long wait,  Martha Bailey appeared.</p>
<p>She looked very beautiful, and  carried herself with the dignity and grace that is frequently called &ldquo;the air  of a duchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her natural bright coloring needed  no artificial assistance, but it had been applied, artistically, yet  noticeably.</p>
<p>She wore what is called a magpie  dress,&mdash;a somewhat startling confection of black and white, rather bizarre of  design, but well suited to her glowing beauty.</p>
<p>Duke didn&rsquo;t rise at her entrance,  but motioned her to a chair at his side, in which she seated herself  deliberately and glanced unconcernedly about.</p>
<p>Members of the family were not  surprised at her manner, for it was an open secret that she and her  mother-in-law were not entirely congenial, and she could not be expected to  show great grief.</p>
<p>But the policemen looked at her  with curiosity, and wondered at her calm poise.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone was especially  interested in her, and scarcely took his eyes off her, though so veiling his  glance that it was unobtrusive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you last see Mrs.  Bailey?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last evening, when we all said  good night and went upstairs,&rdquo; replied the Duchess, with a supercilious stare,  meant to annihilate Hale, but which utterly failed of its intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke squirmed a little, and looked  imploringly at his wife. However, she ignored him and said, quietly;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not go in to speak to  Mrs. Bailey after she had retired to her bedroom or her boudoir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale suddenly held out to her a  small narrow strip of fine sandpaper, with straight edges and rounded ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be. I cannot be certain. I  have some like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is its use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is from my case of manicure  implements. It is for use on one&rsquo;s fingertips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this may be yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is yours, Mrs. Bailey. It has  been identified by Agnes, the ladies&rsquo; maid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes is not a ladies&rsquo; maid. She  is the parlor maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tells me she often acts as  maid to the ladies of this household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, she informed me that  you possess sandpaper strips like this and no one else in the house does. Those  belonging to the late Mrs. Bailey and to Miss Bailey are of a different style  and shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; and Martha looked at him,  a trifle insolently, &ldquo;what of it? I said it might be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is yours, and it was found  this morning under the edge of the dresser in the room which Mrs. Bailey occupied  last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she caught her breath  quickly and her face paled save where the tinge of rouge showed on her cheeks.  &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember now. I went in for a moment to speak to Mrs. Bailey, and  as I was then doing my finger nails, I carried my kit along with me. We  sometimes hobnobbed over our manicuring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a slight laugh, a forced,  artificial sound, that made both Stone and detective Whitney glance at her  sharply.</p>
<p>In fact the alertness of the  younger man drew Stone&rsquo;s attention to him and he hoped for a talk with him  soon. </p>
<p>Fleming Stone was almost always  bored by the preliminary investigation of a sheriff or coroner. They seemed so  roundabout of procedure, so slow of progress and so barren of results that he  longed to take the questioning into his own hands. As this was manifestly  impossible, he sat still and let his thoughts run over the strange situation.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey had come to him for  help, fearing an attack on his own life. Having heard of the changed bedrooms,  it was obvious that the attack had been made, the assailant supposing that he  was thrusting a dagger into the back of Bailey himself, when really he stabbed  Mrs. Bailey. It was not incredible, the moonlight in that room was not bright  and the lady had worn her husband&rsquo;s sleeping suit. Moreover, her hair was short  and shingled, and so that, with her face turned away, the error was easily  understood. Now, the thing was to find the criminal.</p>
<p>Though past the day when he hoped  to find initialled handkerchiefs or broken cuff-links, Stone still had a  hankering to search a room for clews, and it seemed to him this was a good time  to do it. Whatever the coroner learned from the members of the family, Stone  could get later, and he doubted if it would be much. Anyway, he was aching to  see that room, and so, without a word save a low-murmured, &ldquo;Excuse me, please,&rdquo;  he rose and went quietly from the study.</p>
<p>Of course, no one could stop him.  He closed the door behind him and quickly crossed the living room to the hall.</p>
<p>There he found Fuller, alert and  watchful.</p>
<p>Scarcely pausing on his way, Stone  said, shortly;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s room? That way?&rdquo; He  pointed toward the West end of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, the other way,&rdquo; said  Fuller, surprised into responsiveness, and Stone went on.</p>
<p>He mounted the broad staircase,  and at the landing, where it branched, he paused to look at the gorgeous suit  of armor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maximilian!&rdquo; he exclaimed, for  he knew about such things, and Maximilian armor was seldom seen outside of  museums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed a rather shrill  voice, &ldquo;do you know him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the West branch of the  staircase came a tall, strong-looking woman, with a face, it seemed to Stone,  like a horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know him? No,&rdquo; he said, in his  pleasant way. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you called him Maximilian,  and that is his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Named for his type, then. And a  fine example he is. Are you one of the family, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>People rarely took offense at  Fleming Stone&rsquo;s questions, unless he wished them to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Marigold Burt replied,  &ldquo;yes, I may say I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re just on your way to  the study, where the coroner is asking questions. Go along, then, for all the  family is supposed to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asking about&mdash;about Blandena&mdash;&rdquo; her  face turned ashy white and she looked more like George Eliot than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the tragedy, yes. Have you  any information to give out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I,&mdash;who are you? Police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a friend of Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s,  Stone is my name. And yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Stone! The great  detective! Oh, my! Why, &mdash;me&mdash;I&rsquo;m Miss Burt, Marigold Burt. I&mdash;I live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And tell me,&mdash;what did you  hear in the night &mdash;about midnight, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;I&mdash;nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you at that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in my bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, come, Miss Burt,  weren&rsquo;t you out here on the stairs,&mdash;maybe hiding behind Maximilian, to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you! What are you accusing  me of? Sir&mdash;&rdquo; So drawn and contorted with rage was her gaunt face, that Stone  stepped back a pace or two.</p>
<p>He decided that the female of the  species was sometimes a termagant and this was one of the times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please be more quiet,&rdquo; he urged,  &ldquo;at what time then were you out here, hiding behind the armor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&mdash;not at any time. I  don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the massive frame of the big  woman was quivering with fear, and her eyes stared at him from beneath their  bushy brows, full of horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Burt, take my advice and let  me be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; A shudder of relief  passed and left her more calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if you&rsquo;ll tell the truth.  Otherwise, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth about what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About last night. You were here,  at some time during the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, positively not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Stone bent down and picked  up a bedroom slipper from under the edge of the huge pedestal that held the  armor, &ldquo;what is this doing here? Is it not yours? It&rsquo;s too large for any of the  other ladies of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was large, a really enormous  slipper, made of a sort of Turkish towelling, with a faded blue ribbon bow on  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s mine. I dropped  it somewhere two nights ago, and I couldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two nights ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, night before last. I went  downstairs for my purse I had left down there, and when I reached my room  again, I had on only one slipper. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the unbeautiful shoe from  his hand, and folding it together, stuffed it into a capacious pocket of the  green sweater she wore.</p>
<p>Then without another word, she  passed him and went on downstairs.</p>
<p>Stone looked after her, a little  smile wrinkling his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer sort,&rdquo; he said to himself.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder Bailey has that put-upon look, with this she-dragon and that  young duchess to boss him. To say nothing of the butler, who is the very  essence of pomp and circumstance! Oh, well, great wealth brings its own  disturbances. Now to visit the scene of the crime,&mdash;the spot where the body was  found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone was not flippant in  the face of a tragedy, but his converse with himself was often in a light, even  frivolous vein.</p>
<p>He was not the sort of detective  who has to have a subordinate to unload his theories and deductions upon. He  communed only with himself, when he was thinking out a case.</p>
<p>He had often thought of setting up  an assistant, and had once been interested in a young lad, but on the whole he  concluded that he travels the fastest who travels alone, and Stone liked to  travel fast.</p>
<p>He did have a cousin, who, he  sometimes thought, might be useful, but that was as far as he had gone in the  matter.</p>
<p>Reaching the top of the stairs, he  saw the lovely parlor maid walking aimlessly along.</p>
<p>Her uniform told him she was a  servant, but her angelic face seemed to him like a vision straight from Heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Greuze could paint such line  and color,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Who are you, child?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Agnes, the maid,&rdquo; she said,  her eyes widening with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, you&rsquo;ve nothing  to fear. Which is Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; </p>
<p>His gentle, cultured voice seemed  to calm her, and she took him to the rooms of Duke and his wife, in the  Northwest corner of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean Mr. Duke&rsquo;s  wife,&rdquo; she said, calmly enough now. &ldquo;This is her room, and this is Mr. Duke&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, thank you. Run along.  I have an errand here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone had no errand in the  Duchess&rsquo; room, had indeed, no real reason for wanting to enter it, but he was  in an exploring mood, and thought it as well to take it in when occasion  offered.</p>
<p>It was evident the chambermaid had  not yet been her rounds. The bed was not made, and various articles of lingerie  and toiletry lay scattered about.</p>
<p>Stone quite understood how the  excitement in the household and the absence of its mistress would upset the  routine of daily work, and was not surprised at it. He glanced about with  slight interest, beyond a feeling of admiration for the beauty of the  furnishings and appointments.</p>
<p>The only thing he noticed was the  manicure case, which was upside down on the floor, the dainty implements of  blue enamel and shining steel scattered all about.</p>
<p>He gazed for a moment and then  left the room.</p>
<p>He gave a casual glance into  Duke&rsquo;s room, also into Parke&rsquo;s room, of which the door was flung wide open.</p>
<p>Then, seeing his own hat and coat,  also his bags in the next room, he concluded he must be domiciled there, and  stepped inside.</p>
<p>The ubiquitous Fuller appeared,  verified his assumption, and offered help in arranging his things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it all to you, Fuller.  Put things away, but for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, put &rsquo;em where I can find them! Don&rsquo;t  hide everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said the Earl of  Northumberland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, show me Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s  room,&mdash;Mrs. Bailey, Senior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. He opened a door at the  East end of the hall. &ldquo;This is her boudoir, sir. The room front is her room,  and the room back is Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, that will do, Fuller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone gazed thoughtfully  round the boudoir. It was what might be expected; a charmingly furnished,  dainty little apartment, with mirrors and pictures, chaise lounge and lace  pillows, book rack and smoking stand, all of fine type and good taste.</p>
<p>A hasty but careful search showed  no clew or unexpected finding, and Stone opened the door into Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s own  bedroom. This had been occupied by Owen Bailey the night before and some of his  belongings were still strewn about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should think the housekeeper  would get the maids to work on the bedrooms,&rdquo; thought Stone, who was a tidy  soul and had been brought up by a militant homemaker of a mother. &ldquo;Maybe she  didn&rsquo;t have a housekeeper, but I thought all rich folks did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despairing of picking up a few  unconsidered trifles, he went across the boudoir to the room where the victim  lay, the bedroom of Owen Bailey.</p>
<p>A young chap, assistant of the  coroner, was in charge. He looked at Stone apathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Stone. You taking care  of things here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. And if you ask me, I&rsquo;d like  to get clear of it. Not much fun to be shut up alone with that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, son, but if you&rsquo;re aiming to  be a coroner, some day, you have to get used to these things. Go out and walk  up and down the hall, or, better yet, step out on that balcony for a breath of  air. Do you good. I&rsquo;ll call you back when I&rsquo;m leaving. It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m a  detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! A detective from the city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why didn&rsquo;t you say  deteckative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks. I ain&rsquo;t in a story book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; Stone smiled.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim. Jim Paddock. I&rsquo;m Doc Hale&rsquo;s  driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jim, I&rsquo;ll remember  you. Now go out on the balcony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wide balcony ran across the  whole East end of the house, being over the covered terrace below. A spiral  stair ran down from the bedroom of Owen Bailey to his study on the first floor.</p>
<p>This staircase opening into both  Bailey&rsquo;s rooms, had no door at top or bottom, but ended in the two rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; mused the interested  detective, &ldquo;then anybody could have got into the house, or, for that matter  could have been in the house, and could have gone into Bailey&rsquo;s study, up this  stair, committed his crime, stepped down the stair again, and gone his way. Too  easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the still figure on  the bed. As soon as the preliminary inquiry should be over, he was sure the  body would be taken away. And he wanted to see it.</p>
<p>Yet he learned nothing from it.</p>
<p>The dagger had been driven into  the back with a sure, strong thrust. Yet that did not necessarily presuppose a  criminal with an accurate knowledge of anatomy. The average man had enough  gumption to hit the heart of his victim. Yes, and since the war, the average  woman, too.</p>
<p>Stone&rsquo;s thoughts flew back to the  strange woman he had met on the stairs.</p>
<p>She would make an ideal suspect.  So perfect a one that he judged it was too good a theory to be true.</p>
<p>He looked pityingly at the dead  face.</p>
<p>Blandena was pretty, and as is  sometimes the case, the waxen pallor of death increased her beauty, and made it  ethereal. Her hair was in tousled ringlets above her brow and her eyes were  closed, the long lashes lying on her white cheeks.</p>
<p>The gay colored pajamas struck an  inharmonious note, and Stone turned away from the none too pleasing picture.</p>
<p>He looked about the room. The gown  and lingerie of Mrs. Bailey still lay where she had placed it on undressing,  for the coroner had ordained that nothing be touched.</p>
<p>It told Stone nothing, however,  for he knew why she was in that room, and it surely gave color to the theory  that the fatal blow was meant for Owen Bailey and not for his wife.</p>
<p>Stone felt that he could do little  or nothing until he could have a talk with Bailey. If this whole affair was the  outcome of those letters the man had received, then it was indeed a pity Stone  hadn&rsquo;t arrived twenty-four hours sooner.</p>
<p>Yet, what could he have done? What  could he do now? Suppose the enemy made another attempt on the life of Owen  Bailey, and succeeded, how could Stone, or any one else stave it off? It would  require an armed guard, a regiment of soldiers.</p>
<p>And even then, a clever villain  could outwit them.</p>
<p>Yes, he must get an interview with  Bailey as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Giving a last glance around, he  saw on the floor, in a corner a small white lozenge. Not as small as an aspirin  tablet, yet not quite so large as a dime.</p>
<p>He picked it up gingerly by its  edge and laid it carefully in a scrap of paper which he put away in his pocketbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found sumpin?&rdquo; asked an exultant  voice, and Stone realized the bright eyes of Jimmy Paddock had been watching  him all the time.</p>
<p>However, he had no objections, but  he said to the boy, a little sharply;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy, if we&rsquo;re to be friends,  you must do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet, Mr. Stone, I sure will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;re not to tell  any one that I picked up something from the floor, until I say you may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K. Mr. Stone. Mum&rsquo;s the word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jimmy. Now, back to  your post, I&rsquo;m going downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  Mr. Sheridan Gets Into The Game</b></h2>
<p>As Stone reached the lower hall,  he saw Fuller opening the front door to admit a man who bustled in as one  familiar with the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Fuller,&rdquo; the newcomer said,  in a hearty voice, &ldquo;ah, sad news,&mdash;sad news indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the butler taking  the other&rsquo;s hat and coat. &ldquo;They are all in the study. Will you go there, Mr.  Sheridan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone to  himself, &ldquo;Sheridan,&mdash; the partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped along the hall and  spoke to the visitor. &ldquo;Mr. Sheridan?&rdquo; he said, extending a hand. &ldquo;Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s  partner? I am Fleming Stone, here in Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s interests. May I have a few  words with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Glad to, Mr. Stone. You  arrived quickly on the scene. I&rsquo;ve heard of you, and I&rsquo;m sure you can clear  this thing up if anybody can. Yes, yes. Where can we go, Fuller, and be alone a  little time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere you like, sir. Everybody  is in the study. Perhaps the billiard room, Mr. Sheridan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will do. Come along,  Stone. Now tell me a bit about it all. I know nothing at all, save that Mrs.  Bailey is dead.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You just came from New York?&rdquo;  Stone nodded at the big car he could see from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no. I left New York last  evening. I was a bit late getting started and I had the devil of a time with  tire troubles. One thing after another delayed me, and I didn&rsquo;t get to the  Canterbury Ledge till about midnight. So, as this house was dark, I went right  over to the Inn and put up there till morning. Not knowing, of course, that  there was trouble here, I left orders not to be awakened, and when I woke  myself, it was late indeed. You see, all that bother last night tired me out. I  slept,&mdash;Lord, how I did sleep! Well, then, when I came downstairs at the Inn I  was greeted with the terrible news from Cricky. I came right over, and here I  am. Now, I want to see Bailey first of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mr. Sheridan. I want  to see him, too. But if we go back to the study, we&rsquo;ll just have to sit and  listen to a country constable and a county sheriff asking routine questions over  and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know. Inane babble that  gets nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, they do get at the  facts, but with so much repetition and circumlocution that it&rsquo;s very slow work.  However, they have one bright lad in there. A young detective from Hartford.  That chap is a smart one, and I&rsquo;m depending on him to get details of the  inquiry later on. Now, here it is, Mr. Sheridan. I think a confab of you and  Mr. Bailey and myself, would get us lined up as to our policy and our immediate  action. Suppose we send for Mr. Bailey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just right. Just the thing. I  don&rsquo;t want to listen to that question and answer business, either.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He leaned over and pushed a bell  button, and when Fuller appeared, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the study door, Fuller, and  ask Mr. Bailey to come out here. If any objection is made, come back and  report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; and the Earl of  Northumberland walked majestically away.</p>
<p>In a few moments Owen Bailey  appeared.</p>
<p>He looked fagged and worn, which  did not surprise Stone, knowing the man.</p>
<p>It did surprise him, however, that  Bailey showed no welcome in his face for his partner.</p>
<p>No smile of greeting or look of  relief showed on his wearied face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sheridan,&rdquo; he said, dully,  &ldquo;so here you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; was the somewhat  unnecessary response, &ldquo;here I am. Now, I want to help. What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, here,&rdquo; returned Bailey.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than enough to go around, in the way of detectives and police.  All you can do to help, is to carry on at the office. So you may as well go  back there, and keep things shipshape. I don&rsquo;t know just when I can get back  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right. I&rsquo;ll do  that. But I&rsquo;ll stay here today. Can&rsquo;t rush too much, and besides, I want to  know how things are going. Who killed Blandena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey winced at the crudity  of speech, but he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m sure I have no  idea. The coroner grilled Martha unmercifully, but we know Martha didn&rsquo;t do it.  Of course, none of the family did. It was some outsider. And, of course, the  stroke was meant for me. It&rsquo;s by mere irony of fate that it descended on my  poor wife. And the end is not yet. The people, whoever they are, who did the  deed, will yet make good their error, and I shall follow Blandena. Not that I  care&mdash; much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey looked the picture of  despair.</p>
<p>Stone was truly sorry for him, but  he couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that a stronger character would have faced the  situation differently.</p>
<p>The detective was more or less a  reader of character, and he sized up Owen Bailey as a fine business man but one  who showed a submissive and vacillating nature in his home life. This was to  his credit, in a way, for he had always the welfare and happiness of his family  at heart, and he would and did let them walk over him roughshod, if it suited  their pleasure.</p>
<p>And now his family circle was  broken, the one dearest to him had been snatched away, and it was in keeping  with Bailey&rsquo;s way of receiving and accepting blame for everything, that he  should feel it was his fault that the fatal blow had reached the wrong victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she proposed sleeping in my  room last night. I thought nothing of it, it was her habitual custom. She slept  there the night before. Usually it is about three nights that the full moon  troubles her. A harmless practice, surely. Who could dream it would bring this  horror?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Bailey,&rdquo; Sheridan said,  &ldquo;it was in no way your fault. We all know of your wife&rsquo;s habit. She&rsquo;s been  doing that for years. But the intruder, whoever he was, didn&rsquo;t know of it, and  thought he had it in for you. I say this because it&rsquo;s inconceivable any one  should want to kill Blandena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; returned Bailey,  but Stone thought he detected a shade of doubt in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must look at all sides,&rdquo; Stone  said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say so positively that the blow was meant for Mr. Bailey,  though I agree that is the most likely supposition. But it won&rsquo;t do to omit  entirely the possibility of an intentional attack on Mrs. Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; and Owen Bailey&rsquo;s eyes  widened with horror. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t raise such a suggestion. Don&rsquo;t bring her name into  it any further than need be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of names or  of our wishes in the matter,&rdquo; Stone told him. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Bailey, knowing all you  know now, as to conditions and evidence and all that, do you want me to  continue to investigate the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do,&mdash;I certainly do! You know  who did it, that is, you don&rsquo;t know his name, nor do I, but you know it was the  same hand that sent me those letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What letters?&rdquo; asked Sheridan,  quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well tell him,&rdquo; Bailey  said, and in a few words he told his partner of the anonymous notes he had  received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anonymous letters!&rdquo; Sheridan  fairly snorted, &ldquo;and you paid any attention to such things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at first,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;but  at last I had to. I went to Mr. Stone only yesterday,&mdash;my God, it was only  yesterday! And he has the case in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, that puts a different  aspect on the matter,&rdquo; said Sheridan, looking over the letter which was shown  him.</p>
<p>Stone watched him carefully as he  read it, though without seeming to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you have the writing  traced?&rdquo; Sheridan said, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pen written,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;A  typewriter could be more easily traced, but unless we have a suspicion, how can  we go about it to trace a bit of penmanship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it couldn&rsquo;t have been  anybody in the house,&rdquo; Sheridan mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you in the house last  night?&rdquo; Bailey shot the question at him so suddenly that his partner fairly  jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I! What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About you. Your car was  here&mdash;nearly midnight, it was. Where were you, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bailey, you&rsquo;re losing your mind.  This trouble has unsettled you. Otherwise, I should take offense, serious  offense at your speech. Yes, I reached here from New York, about midnight, last  night. I drove up to the front door and got out. I walked all round the house,  to see if there was a light in any room. There was, in one or two bedrooms, but  none downstairs. So, I concluded not to rouse the household and I went to the  Inn for the night. I slept late this morning, and now, here I am, to help you,  or to leave you, if you make another accusing speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make an accusing  speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words were all right, it was  the look on your face that offended me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Albert. If you were  as distraught as I am, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to control your facial muscles,  either. I meant no accusation&mdash;how could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Owen. Forget it. Now,  Mr. Stone, perhaps you will tell me what, if anything, I can do to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then, the door was flung  open, and a small whirlwind, in the shape of Lolly Bailey came flying in, and  came to anchor in the outstretched arms of her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear? What&rsquo;s the  matter?&rdquo; he asked, smoothing her tumbled hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daddy, they&rsquo;ve fastened it on  Martha! On the Duchess! Think of it! How can they be so rotten? The Duchess and  Mumsie didn&rsquo;t always hit it off, I know, but she wouldn&rsquo;t kill her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; Owen Bailey  tried to quiet the turbulent child. &ldquo;Do you mean they really accuse Martha?  Dear, dear, I must see about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, wait, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; urged  Stone. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do any good by rushing in there, knowing no more than you  know now. Tell us more, Miss Lolly. What is the evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. You know they  found her sandpaper, and also, they found a shoe button, a pearl one, that they  have proved came off one of Martha&rsquo;s slippers. So, they say, she was the last  one to be in the room with Mother last night, and they say there was a row, and  she grabbed the dagger from the wall, and&mdash;oh, Mr. Stone, if you are any good at  all, do go and straighten it out! Tell &rsquo;em the Duchess couldn&rsquo;t,&mdash;just simply  couldn&rsquo;t do a thing like that! Mr. Sheridan, you know she couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do they know Mrs. Bailey Jr.  was the last one in the room?&rdquo; asked Stone, abruptly.</p>
<p>Lolly hesitated, then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Parke helped that along. He  says he was awake very late, reading a detective story in bed, and his door was  open. And he says he saw the Duchess go to Dad&rsquo;s room, he knew Mother was  sleeping there, and he saw her come away again, Martha, I mean, about half an  hour later. And he says nobody else passed his door all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But somebody could have come up  the little stairs from the study&mdash;&rdquo; said Bailey, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; agreed Lolly.  &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just what they did do. Now, I know something,&mdash;something I didn&rsquo;t  tell them. But if it&rsquo;ll help Martha, I&rsquo;ll tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, dear,&rdquo; her father said,  &ldquo;and let us judge whether you must tell the coroner or not. This girl is  impulsive,&rdquo; he smiled at Stone, &ldquo;and not always to be trusted for strict  accuracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is accurate enough,&rdquo;  and Lolly looked belligerent. &ldquo;I heard a noise last night, about twelve  o&rsquo;clock, and I got up and looked out the window and there was your car, Mr.  Sheridan. I didn&rsquo;t know then whose car it was, but I thought it might be some  of my friends, so I opened my door to the hall to listen for the doorbell. But  I heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know now it was my  car?&rdquo; asked Sheridan, looking amusedly at the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not being totally blind, I see it  parked outside now,&rdquo; Lolly said, scornfully. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s the same car. Well,  as I say, I heard nothing, but I saw George, yes, George herself, parked behind  Maximilian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited for expressions of  surprise, but received only a query from Fleming Stone, who said, with a  puzzled look, &ldquo;Who is George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean Miss Burt, a permanent  guest of the family. She looks like George Eliot, so we call her George. Well,  she stood, quiet like a mouse, behind Max,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the armor on the stairs, Mr.  Stone,&mdash;and while I was looking she slipped out and scuttled up to her own room.  Now far be it from me to accuse old George of murder, but&mdash;well, I&rsquo;d rather it&rsquo;d  be her than the Duchess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overcome by the excitement of the  occasion, Lolly put her head down on her father&rsquo;s shoulder and sobbed.</p>
<p>Of all the family, Lolly best  understood Owen Bailey&rsquo;s nature. She could ballyrag him about his faulty  English, she could chaff him about his shyness and his lack of what she called  backbone, and he never resented it. But if the others attempted similar  criticism, Bailey grew morose and sulky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Lolly,&rdquo; Bailey said, &ldquo;stop  crying. It isn&rsquo;t up to you to discover who did this thing. Don&rsquo;t try amateur  detective work, for pity&rsquo;s sake. Tell us all you know, and leave it to us to  inform the authorities or not as we think best. As to George, you&rsquo;re crazy to  think of her in connection with crime. She was most likely going down to the  library to get a book I loaned her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lent, Daddy,&rdquo; said Lolly, raising  her tear stained face. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no verb to loan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there, dear?&rdquo; said Bailey,  absent. &ldquo;Now, child, you run away, and Albert, I wish you&rsquo;d clear out for a  bit. I want to talk alone with Mr. Stone, and I&rsquo;m going to have it. Sheridan,  you&rsquo;d better go and see the coroner, and tell about stopping here last night.  If you don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll dig it up and pin the crime on you. I know their powers  of digging things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Sheridan,  showing no signs of fear.</p>
<p>He went away to join the group in  the study and Lolly went with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl is too active and  energetic,&rdquo; Bailey said, as he locked the door after her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll make trouble,  unless we can curb her impetuosity. The idea of her lugging in poor Miss Burt.  She is not a favorite of mine, but she is incapable of actual crime. So, too,  is my daughter-in-law. But these preliminary suspicions will doubtless wear  themselves out. Won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but not necessarily.  Now, Mr. Bailey, don&rsquo;t you propose to show your anonymous letter to the  police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I propose to do whatever you  advise, Mr. Stone. I want you to take the case and handle it in your own way. I  will do exactly as you tell me. But I held back all mention of my threatening  letters until I could confer with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you did right. Now, as I have  implied, I have small use for the mental powers of the coroner, sheriff and  constable. But the detective is a bright chap, and I shall be glad to work with  him. Yet we must not antagonize the local powers that be, so we will treat them  with all deference and consideration. And we must show them the letter you  have, and tell them about the others that you destroyed. There must be no  withholding of evidence, just where do your suspicions point, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in one direction. To the  writer of those letters. I&rsquo;ve thought about them&mdash;indeed, I never stop thinking  about them,&mdash;and I am sure the writer is one of those two men I told you of.  Sometimes I think it is one of them, again I think it is the other. How can we  find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll find out. I shall put  my agents on the track of the two men and I&rsquo;m sure we can run to earth one or  both of them in a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone was far from being  as sure of this as he pretended. But he was sorry for his client, and deemed it  a duty to say something in the way of encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll  arrest my daughter-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, anyway. But were her  relations with your wife unfriendly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, scarcely that, but they had  differing opinions on most subjects. The Duchess is high-strung, temperamental  and all that. My wife was easy-going comfort-loving, and hated turmoil of any  sort. Now, Martha has positive genius for stirring up trouble and keeping  things in hot water. At present she was standing out for a certain type of  furnishings in the house, while my wife wanted another sort. They squabbled  over it all the time. I&rsquo;ve no doubt Martha was in my wife&rsquo;s room,&mdash; that is, my  room,&mdash;last night, rowing about the furniture. I&rsquo;ve no doubt they both lost  their temper, and had high words. But that Martha snatched a dagger from the  wall and stabbed Blandena with it I cannot believe! Nobody could believe such a  thing as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as to Miss Burt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, as Lolly says, I&rsquo;d  rather believe it of her than of Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t judge a criminal  that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not.&rdquo; Owen Bailey  sighed. &ldquo;Well, all I can say is, I don&rsquo;t believe George did it, either. But  there&rsquo;s more possibility of her than of Duke&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Stone asked quickly.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Owen Bailey&rsquo;s  pale face showed a slowly rising blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a different type.  More&mdash;er&mdash;strong-minded, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve other reasons. Now, look  here, Mr. Bailey, if you&rsquo;re not going to be perfectly and entirely frank with  me, I drop this case right here. Tell me what you mean and all you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Mr. Stone, and I will be  entirely frank. Miss Burt, then, does me the honor to be&mdash;well, enamored of  me,&mdash;and while I do not return her sentiment in the slightest degree, yet one  cannot be rude to a lady, a house guest and an old friend of my wife&rsquo;s. So  marked has&mdash;er&mdash;admiration become of late, that I have been frequently  embarrassed, and really at my wits&rsquo; end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mrs. Bailey know of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to a degree. I mean she knew  what she occasionally saw, and what I told her. But she only laughed, thinking  it a great joke on me. Mrs. Bailey and I were absolutely congenial, and  entirely in each other&rsquo;s confidence. We had no spark of jealousy, for we both  knew there was no reason for such a feeling. So, Mrs. Bailey, who was a bit of  a tease, just laughed at Miss Burt&rsquo;s liking for me and chaffed me unmercifully  about it both in season and out of season. Of late, Miss Burt had begun to take  offense at this open joking, and she had told Mrs. Bailey so. I was glad to  learn this, for I thought it would stop my wife&rsquo;s teasing, but, on the  contrary, it seemed to egg her on. My family are all like that. They dearly  love to get a rise out of one another, or mock at a fad or foible. I cannot  hold my own in their encounters of wits, so I never take sides, but let them  run on, and not infrequently they wind up with a real quarrel. But it always  blows over quickly and is forgotten. I tell you all this that you may  understand the household, and especially Marigold Burt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was she on the stairs last  night, hiding behind the armor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she? I know of no real  reason. I spoke of a book in the library, but it is more probable, Mr. Stone, that  she was waiting there for me. This sounds rather fatuous and all that, I know.  But I have promised you the truth, and it is true that she has, at times,  waited on the stairs to say good night as I came up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone repressed the amusement he  couldn&rsquo;t help feeling. But the dejected looking man before him was so  unattractive and so little like a gay Lothario, that it seemed impossible any  woman, even a spinster like Marigold Burt, should try to vamp him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Bailey, tell me the  truth always. As to this Burt affair, don&rsquo;t take it too seriously. You know the  results of repressed inhibitions in a woman and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re in the realm of  psycho-analysis, Mr. Stone, and let me tell you right out, I&rsquo;ve no use for the  so-called science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Bailey, I won&rsquo;t  annoy you, then, with such references. Now, to get back to practical details. I  will look up the identification of your threatening correspondent. I will say,  also, that now, though I know few of the details of last night&rsquo;s tragedy, I feel  convinced that the criminal was no member of your family or household, no  chance burglar or marauder from outside, but was almost certainly the  evil-minded villain who sent you those letters. If I am right, we can surely  find him, though it may take some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And meantime, will they arrest  any one&mdash;any innocent person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, and I think not. But  we have a lot to do, and we must work fast. I shall have a talk with Detective  Whitney, and then I must go back to New York for a day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Stone,&mdash;suppose, after  having made the mistake they made last night, they go on and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get the right one?&rdquo; said  Stone, but he did not smile. &ldquo;There is indeed danger of that, Mr. Bailey. But  don&rsquo;t give way,&rdquo; he added hastily, as his client showed signs of utter  collapse. &ldquo;Are you always so swayed by fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never was before. I have  never been noted for bravery, but I am not a coward. Yet this affair last  night, has paralyzed me. My nerves are all on edge, I am shaken, stunned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see you are. Now, this  won&rsquo;t do. You must have a guard, a strong police guard, night and day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that is what I want! I  may be cowardly, I may be over apprehensive, but I crave protection. And, Mr.  Stone, it is not only for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it occurred to you, that  this fiendish enemy of mine, may not have made a mistake last night? May he not  have known that he would pierce my very soul by killing my dear wife instead of  myself?&rdquo; And, Bailey&rsquo;s voice sank to a whisper, &ldquo;may he not strike at others of  my family, before he reaches my miserable self?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all this had been in Stone&rsquo;s  mind before Bailey voiced it, and he was amazed to hear it put into words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hardly think that,&rdquo; he  said, a bit mendaciously. &ldquo;But a guard you must have and I&rsquo;ll see that such is  provided. Now, brace up, Mr. Bailey, try to get back your normal poise. You  have still the responsibility of your family on your shoulders, and you must  rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>For answer, Owen Bailey did  straighten up, physically, and showed a determination to obey Stone&rsquo;s behest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard about the aluminum  slip, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stone replied. &ldquo;That is our  best clew. There are so few places nowadays, where that could have been stamped  out, it is really helpful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; assented Bailey,  &ldquo;but, it&rsquo;s a fearful message. &lsquo;Vengeance is Mine,&rsquo; is not a joke, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; solemnly  agreed Fleming Stone. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  Fleming Stone Horns In</b></h2>
<p>The coroner and the sheriff came  to the door of the billiard room and knocked.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone admitted them, and  Sheriff Hunter began at once, in his blustering way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more to be done  just now, Mr. Bailey. I&rsquo;ve questioned all the crowd, and unless the murderer  was an intruder from outside, the evidence points in the direction of your  daughter-in-law, Mrs. Duke Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey&rsquo;s face turned a deep  red, and he exclaimed angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s utterly absurd! That girl  couldn&rsquo;t do such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Fleming Stone shook his head  at him, and turning to Hunter, said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re having an inquest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. To-morrow morning. We&rsquo;ll  know for certain then. The body can be removed now, shall I call the mortician,  Mr. Bailey, or will you do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call the firm, Mr. Hunter,  and I will see their representative, when he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll do that. Of  course, no one who was in the house last night may leave it to-day. That&rsquo;s  understood? Now, Mr. Stone how about you? You are determined to horn in on  this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Fleming Stone&rsquo;s rules,  adopted from Holy Writ, was to answer a fool according to his folly.</p>
<p>So he quietly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed. As Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s  friend and adviser, I hope to be of help to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t interfere too much  with young Whitney. He&rsquo;s an official detective; none of your amatoor about  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These innuendoes annoyed Bailey  more than they did Stone. He made allowance for the source of the slight, and  deemed it of no importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I liked the looks of Mr.  Whitney,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probly there&rsquo;s no work to be  done. If that there uppish young woman stabbed the old lady, it&rsquo;ll be easy to  prove it on her. And it&rsquo;s my opinion she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s my opinion she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  Stone rejoined, still suave of tone.</p>
<p>Hunter glowered at him, and  Coroner Hale, feeling left out, remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a strong-arm dame. One of  those tennis champs and golf shooters. She could drive a dagger if she wanted  to. And she&rsquo;s got a high temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t enough to convict  her,&rdquo; Stone observed, &ldquo;nor enough to accuse her. Everybody in this house is  probably a golf player and a tennis expert; they are all out-doorsy, athletic  people. You&rsquo;ll have to have more to go on than that, before you suspect Mrs.  Duke Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Hunter broke in  again. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s another suspect waiting. How about that old maid, Miss  Burt? She&rsquo;s not only strong physically, but in her mind, too. Hatchet-faced,  she is, and muscular besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Bailey put in, impatiently,  &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t accuse Miss Burt. She was devoted to my wife, an old school friend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she was, was she? And how  about her being devoted to you? How about her having plans that depended on the  removal of your present wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So meaningful was the look in  Hunter&rsquo;s eyes, so plainly evident the fact that he knew of Marigold&rsquo;s feelings  toward Bailey, that the latter collapsed utterly. He looked beseechingly at  Stone, who took up the burden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gathered that, I suppose,  from the gossip of servants.&rdquo; A surprised look on Hunter&rsquo;s face told him he had  guessed rightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Servants often exaggerate,&rdquo; Stone  went on, &ldquo;and I advise you to be careful. Miss Burt is an influential woman,  and would certainly resent any libellous gossip. And if you got your information  from that beautiful fool of a parlor maid, I may say that I wouldn&rsquo;t trust her  around the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dumbbell! She is good  looking, but she doesn&rsquo;t know enough to go in when it rains! No, I gathered no  information from her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care where you got it, it  isn&rsquo;t first hand. Have you talked with Miss Burt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to,&rdquo; said Hunter, a  little shamefacedly, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of her. She was pert and  in all ways a most unsatisfactory witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you have your  inquest to-morrow, you&rsquo;ll doubtless get at the truth, or enough of the truth,  to exonerate the family and its connections. Now, take a look at this letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone produced the anonymous  letter that Bailey had received, and both Hunter and Hale read it attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This puts a different face on the  matter,&rdquo; the sheriff said, &ldquo;do you know who wrote this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for certain,&rdquo; Stone told him,  and then showed him the old letter of ten years ago. He told him, too, of the  two other letters that Owen Bailey had received recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; agreed the coroner,  &ldquo;this opens up new ways to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;Now, go  ahead with your inquest, but watch your step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep these,&rdquo; Hunter said,  as he returned the letters to their respective envelopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; said Stone,  carelessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to New York this afternoon, and I thought I&rsquo;d refer them  to a graphology expert&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A handwriting expert then. One  who can tell if the ten year old letter and the recent one are written by the  same person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;can you do that? Then,  perhaps you&rsquo;d better. Bring them both back to me. When are you returning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can see about the  letters and do one or two other errands. If I miss the inquest, I can hear all  about it from you. You&rsquo;ll adjourn it, of course. When will the funeral services  be held, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saturday afternoon,&rdquo; said Owen  Bailey, with an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not be back in time to  attend,&rdquo; Stone told him, &ldquo;but I will, if I possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to go to New York, to-day  or to-morrow,&rdquo; Bailey said to the sheriff. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no objection to that, I  suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, Mr. Bailey.  Why don&rsquo;t you go down with Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will. I must go to the  office to sign some important papers and give my secretaries some instructions.  It will take but a few moments, but it must be done. I think I&rsquo;ll go down  to-morrow morning, and get back in time for the funeral. You won&rsquo;t need me at  the inquest, will you? And it upsets me horribly to listen to those questions  and answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be managed. I&rsquo;ll take your  deposition, myself, and as Mr. Stone surmises, there will doubtless be an  adjournment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two uncultured and uncouth  enforcers of law and order, went away, and at Stone&rsquo;s request, the young  detective, Whitney, came to talk to him.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey left them together,  and went to talk things over with his children.</p>
<p>Whitney was a smooth-faced,  clean-cut young man, with a deferential air toward Stone, but a manly attitude  of self-respect manifest in his behavior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud to be associated with you,  Mr. Stone, and I hope you will let me help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to have you,&rdquo; was the hearty  response. &ldquo;Now let us waste no words. Do you think the young Mrs. Bailey is the  criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. If she were she  couldn&rsquo;t,&mdash;she simply <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> show such bravado, such indifference to the  impression she is making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shrewd perception,&rdquo; Stone nodded  approval. &ldquo;Who, then, is the next most likely one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s much to be said for Miss  Burt,&rdquo; Whitney answered, slowly. &ldquo;She is in love with Mr. Bailey, Senior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find that out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the servants; the cook and  the butler both declare it&rsquo;s true. They say, too, she hated Mrs. Bailey, and  they frequently had pitched battles. It seems Mrs. Bailey was trying to get rid  of her and Miss Burt wouldn&rsquo;t leave. She installed herself here, and refused to  budge. She&rsquo;s a peculiar person, not a bad sort, I think, if taken the right  way, but stubborn and eccentric. Well, there&rsquo;s no real evidence against her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this?&rdquo; and Stone took  from his pocket the lozenge he had picked up from the floor of the room where  Mrs. Bailey had met her death.</p>
<p>Whitney stared at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of Miss Burt&rsquo;s  tablets,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a throat remedy. She has a chronic, hacking cough and  she&rsquo;s always eating those things for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve learned a lot about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s all in the day&rsquo;s  work. Where&rsquo;d you get this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the floor in the room where  Mrs. Bailey died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by golly, it was dropped  there last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, and I got this from that  dumb bunny with the angel face, yesterday Miss Burt was entirely out of these  lozenges, and Bunny had to run to the drug store to get her a supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the evening. After the dinner  was over and cleared away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it looks as if Miss Burt was  in Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s room last evening. Did she admit it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, she denied it.  Said she wasn&rsquo;t there. That&rsquo;s why I think she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Now, Mr. Whitney, take a  look at these letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Whitney gave his full  attention to the letters Stone offered, and the explanations of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;this fellow  has it in for Mr. Bailey, whether he killed Mrs. Bailey or not. I&rsquo;m ready to  shift over to his side! I&rsquo;ll lay off this family and go for Mr. Anon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see a handwriting  expert this afternoon, and I think he can tell whether the new letter is  written by John Kennedy or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be fine! What price Miss  Burt being John Kennedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s so big and sort of  masculine, you know, she might write like a man. Maybe she&rsquo;s the nurse who  wrote for Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all mixed up, man. This  letter of ten years </p>
<p>ago, from John Kennedy was written  by a nurse, but that&rsquo;s no good as evidence. But Mr. Bailey has provided me with  letters from John Kennedy and from another man, who is also his enemy, and we  must match up with those, as to the penmanship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. A bit complicated,  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much complicated as  uncertain. I doubt if we can get definite information. Now, as to that aluminum  strip. Where are those things made nowadays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only at the beaches, I think. I&rsquo;m  quite sure they&rsquo;re not in the ferry houses or L Road stations any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.  Now, one more thing. Did you see the slipper from which the shoe button fell  that is held as evidence against Mrs. Duke Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, and there&rsquo;s no doubt that  it&rsquo;s from her shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get them for me? The shoe  and the stray button, both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. They&rsquo;re in my  possession. Just a minute.&rdquo; He hurried from the room, and quickly returned with  a small gray suede shoe and a pearl shoe button.</p>
<p>As he had been told, Stone saw at  once the button was the counterpart of the one still on the shoe, a two-strap  slipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, returning  the shoe and the button to Whitney.</p>
<p>The younger man was disappointed  at the absence of enthusiasm or comment, and wrapped the shoe again in its  paper, tying it about with a string.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mrs. Duke Bailey is innocent,&rdquo;  Stone said, ruminatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only my opinion. I think  we shall have to look further. Well, failing our anonymous letter writer,  there&rsquo;s always Miss Burt to fall back on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the servants?&rdquo; Whitney put  forth this suggestion with some hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. But the crime doesn&rsquo;t seem  to me like the work of a servant. And where&rsquo;s the motive? Now, we know that  Mrs. Bailey, Junior and Miss Burt were in that room last night after Mrs.  Bailey went in there to sleep. Also, we know that an intruder from outside  could easily gain admittance by the stair from the study up to that bedroom. I  find that not half of the doors and windows are locked at night. They tell me  nobody in New England locks up at night. Robbery seems to be a lost art up  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. In the cities we  lock up, but in the small towns they never do. Well, Mr. Stone, I&rsquo;ll see you  tomorrow, after you get back from New York. Now; I&rsquo;ve a lot to do. I believe  they&rsquo;re putting a guard round the house, though what good that will do now, I  don&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Whitney. If this thing  is the work of the anonymous letter writer, he may try again to get at Mr.  Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then he&rsquo;ll be caught. By  the way, Mr. Stone, how much do you know about that Mr. Sheridan, partner of  Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a hunch. But&mdash;shall you  be at Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s office in New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then nose around a bit. See what  you can pick up as to Friend Sheridan. I hear he&rsquo;s been hitting it up on the  horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More suspects? All right,  Whitney, I&rsquo;ll ask a question here and there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney went off and the Earl of  Northumberland, in his lordly fashion, summoned Fleming Stone to luncheon.</p>
<p>The family were already assembled  at the table, and Owen Bailey apologized profusely because they had not waited  for Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fold up and put yourself  away, Dad,&rdquo; exclaimed Parke, weary of the repetition. &ldquo;Mr. Stone doesn&rsquo;t mind.  He doesn&rsquo;t want apologies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s a darling, Mr. Stone,&rdquo;  Lolly added. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really a hundred per cent American Beauty, with an apology  for a head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey looked at her and  shook his apologetic head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be frivolous, dearie,  when we are all under this great sorrow? And don&rsquo;t chatter. Maybe Mr. Stone  wants to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think about me, if you do, Mr.  Stone,&rdquo; said the Duchess, looking at him with her great dark eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one  who is in real trouble. That horrible, terrible sheriff person thinks I killed  Mother Bailey! Well, I didn&rsquo;t, but I scorned to harp on my innocence to that  old shark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so stubborn?&rdquo; her  husband said, despairingly. &ldquo;You <i>must</i> take this thing seriously. Isn&rsquo;t that so,  Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most emphatically so,&rdquo;  Stone replied. &ldquo;Please realize it, Mrs. Bailey. I am sure of your innocence,  all the family also feel sure of it, but if the coroner doesn&rsquo;t he can make a  lot of trouble for you at the inquest. Do put aside these resentful feelings of  yours and consider the rest of the Baileys, if you have no thought for  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fiddle-dee-dee,&rdquo; cried the  Duchess, tossing her lovely head, &ldquo;I am not afraid. An innocent person can&rsquo;t be  accused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, an <i>innocent</i> person can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  said Marigold Burt, with such a note of venom in her tone, that everybody  looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, George,&rdquo; drawled Parke, &ldquo;how  you do go on! Anybody&rsquo;d think you had it in for our Duchess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has it in for herself!&rdquo;  Marigold retorted. &ldquo;I saw her go into Blandena&rsquo;s room last night. I saw her  come out again, much later, looking angry and upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was,&rdquo; said the Duchess,  calmly. &ldquo;We had a fearful row. And all over that silly furniture! I&rsquo;m sorry now  I was so cross with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross!&rdquo; Marigold almost shrieked  the word. &ldquo;You call it being cross to take a dagger from the wall and kill  her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Owen Bailey, in what  he meant to be a stern voice, but which was more like the squeak of a  frightened rabbit.</p>
<p>But Duke interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and  you, too, Martha. If either of you had anything to do with Mother&rsquo;s death, it  was Miss Burt, not my wife. But it was neither. Dad has enemies that you  children don&rsquo;t know about. Haven&rsquo;t you, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;yes, indeed. Yet it says in  the Bible, &lsquo;a man&rsquo;s foes shall be they of his own household.&rsquo; I have enemies,  and I fear them, yet I would rather they did me harm than my own household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey spoke in a low, hushed  voice, that had the effect of quieting the quarrelsome women.</p>
<p>Lolly, who always understood her  father&rsquo;s mood, said, &ldquo;So would I. It&rsquo;s bad enough to have Mother gone, but it&rsquo;s  a thousand times worse to think anybody under this roof did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Loll,&rdquo; Parke cheered  her up, &ldquo;none of us did do it, we all know that. The inquest to-morrow will  prove it, if George and the Duchess behave themselves, and I&rsquo;m sure they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that, too,&rdquo; said  Fleming Stone. &ldquo;And as I have had more experience in these things than the rest  of you, I want to give you a solemn warning that levity or pertness is the very  worst armor you can assume against the proceedings of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, children,&rdquo; Owen Bailey said,  &ldquo;remember that. You are all so full of chaff and mockery here among yourselves,  try to realize that it&rsquo;s the worst possible policy to direct such chatter at  police officials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked the young guy,&rdquo; Lolly  said, &ldquo;I mean to cultivate his acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey shook his head at his  incorrigible daughter and sighed as he pushed away his untasted dessert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not going to New York with you, Stone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hunter telephoned I&rsquo;d better  be here this afternoon. I&rsquo;ll go down to-morrow morning. You carry on as you  intended. And I do hope you can bring back some helpful information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Stone went off to the city and  the rest put in a dismal afternoon trying to find something to do.</p>
<p>Duke insisted that his wife should  play some tennis, as he said she needed some outdoor exercise.</p>
<p>Lolly and Parke flatly refused to  join the game and so they played singles.</p>
<p>Parke read a detective story, and  Lolly awaited the coming of young Whitney, who had said he would come.</p>
<p>When he arrived Lolly at once  adopted him, and led him to a favorite arbor in the rose garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all you know,&rdquo; she  commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, and smiled at her,  &ldquo;you tell me all you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing loth, Lolly began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about these  enemies of my father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she confided, &ldquo;but unless you can pin it on them, have  a try at George&mdash;Miss Burt, you know. She&rsquo;s sweet on Dad, and she always sort of  felt that Mother stole him from her. You see, Dad knew Miss Burt first, and  they were friends, when Mother came along, and cut her out entirely. Well,  George was pretty sore and she and Mother didn&rsquo;t speak for years. Then, all of  a sudden, she came up here, made it up with Mother, who was always awfully  good-natured, and planted herself here to stay. She&rsquo;s still head over heels in  love with Father, and so, of course, you can see now, that she had motive and  nobody else around here has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; Whitney looked at  her oddly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I think so. I know so.  George&mdash;why, she was hiding on the stairs last night. I saw her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiding on the stairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that must have been  either just before or just after she killed Mother. What time did the doctors  say Mother died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About midnight, but they can&rsquo;t  say for certain, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Well, it was just about  midnight that I saw George hiding behind Max, the knight in armor, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was she hiding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you see? She was, as I  said, either going or coming from Mother&rsquo;s room. She went up through the study,  by the little staircase, and came down the same way. She could do all that and  make no sound on the thick rugs. We all close our room doors, except Parke, he  never does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, any one of you had equal  opportunity with Miss Burt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, but nobody else wanted  to kill Mother. She was so dear and gentle, who could want to kill her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you telling me all this,  Miss Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, because I think I ought  to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is not the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly stared at him, but her eyes  fell before his truth compelling gaze. Pretty Lolly, with her rumpled curls  falling over her brow, her bowed head sinking lower on her breast, and now, big  tears dropping from her hazel eyes, was on the verge of a tumultuous crying  spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged the  embarrassed detective, who had been egging her on for his own ends, and was now  afraid he would have a case of hysterics on his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the reason, then?&rdquo;  Lolly&rsquo;s mood changed to defiance, and Whitney welcomed the change. He could  manage her now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason is, that you don&rsquo;t  believe all this,&mdash;all this you&rsquo;ve been feeding me about Miss Burt. What you do  believe is that your sister-in-law committed this murder, and you don&rsquo;t want me  to suspect it, so you over-do matters by dragging in poor Miss Burt, who may  be, doubtless is, in love with your father, but who, I am sure, never killed  your mother for that reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did, she did! She was  jealous of Mother and envious, too. Besides getting Father, Mother had this  lovely home, she had her children, and she had plenty of money and everything  she wanted. She was loved and looked up to by the whole neighborhood. What has  George? Nothing at all! Of course, she was envious, and then, in addition, she  was wild over Father, so she was jealous as well. Now, it seemed to her,  perhaps she had worried over all this till she was nearly crazy, it seemed to  her, that if Mother was out of the way, she could catch Dad on the rebound, and  fall into this lap of luxury herself. It became an obsession with her, and then  the homicidal instinct was born. Oh I know a lot of psychoanalysis, and that&rsquo;s  how it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was, but you don&rsquo;t think  so. You&rsquo;re trumping up this yarn to head me off of digging up more evidence  against Mrs. Duke. You&rsquo;re afraid I&rsquo;ll find it. Aren&rsquo;t you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and then Lolly really did  burst into tears. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  The Beautiful Dumbbell</b></h2>
<p>The afternoon dragged along.</p>
<p>Lolly had, of course, sent word to  the guests expected for her house party so nobody came. As the gloomy  atmosphere of the house deepened, the young people grew more and more nervous  and irritable.</p>
<p>Also they grew more apprehensive  as to what the mysterious conditions an inquest might bring forth. Not one of  them had ever attended an inquest and while Parke declared it would be just the  same as the inquiry they had already been through, Duke insisted it would be  much more of a grilling, and a very serious matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just saying that to scare  me,&rdquo; declared his wife. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t scare so easy. I didn&rsquo;t kill Mother  Bailey, I don&rsquo;t know who did, and I decline to get stirred up over it. It&rsquo;s a  horrible thing, of course, but she&rsquo;s dead, and all this police business can&rsquo;t  bring her back to life. I think it&rsquo;s silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Martha, don&rsquo;t talk like  that,&rdquo; urged her father-in-law. &ldquo;You must admit that Duke and I know more about  these things than you do. That isn&rsquo;t the kind of a daughter you ought to be to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father,&rdquo; Lolly exclaimed, &ldquo;I  do think the very worst error you make is saying &lsquo;the kind of a daughter&rsquo;! I&rsquo;ve  told you over and over,&mdash;leave out the a!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean a daughter,&rdquo; and Owen  Bailey looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say a if you say kind  or sort. What kind of dog? That sort of girl. Not what kind of a dog? That sort  of a girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lolly, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let up  on those pedagogic parades while we have all these other troubles!&rdquo; begged  Parke. &ldquo;You are enough to drive Dad crazy and you have no sympathy for him at  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have so! More than all the rest  of you put together. I&rsquo;m his favorite child. I&rsquo;m the only one who understands  him. I see through all his moods and I realize and appreciate him at his true  worth, as none of you others do. I can discern his inhibitions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lolita,&rdquo; only when Owen Bailey  was very much in earnest did he call her that, &ldquo;Lolita, have I not forbidden  you to jabber that infernal psycho-rubbish in my hearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, Dad, but I keep  forgetting, you see. I have an Oedipus Complex,&mdash;oh, there I go again! Forgive  me, Daddums, I&rsquo;ll stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed the room to sit by  him, and petted him so affectionately, he left off scolding and smiled at her.</p>
<p>They were having tea in the big  living room. Not that anybody wanted tea, but it helped fill up the long, blank  hours. They tacitly avoided the dread subject that was uppermost in every mind,  and as a result there were many long silences.</p>
<p>During one of these, Marigold Burt  began to croon softly;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this dull world to me?<br>
Robin&rsquo;s not here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit that!&rdquo; shouted Duke. &ldquo;If you  must sing, George, make it Jazz and not a song about death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insulting, Duke,&rdquo; and with  a look of hatred at the young man, Miss Burt flounced out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; said Duke, &ldquo;I can  breathe better in her absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she could have  killed Mother?&rdquo; said Parke, suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading a story where the  criminal was a woman, and just the sort of woman,&mdash; no, Lolly, I didn&rsquo;t say a  woman,&mdash;George is. She hated Mother, we all know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Parke,&rdquo; said his  father, sternly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow such talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s been growing worse of  late,&rdquo; Parke went on, paying no attention to his father&rsquo;s admonition. &ldquo;More  touchy, and all that. Look how she skittled out just now. She didn&rsquo;t use to be  like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be her motive?&rdquo; asked  Duke, indifferently. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t kill Mother just because she had soured on  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, motive!&rdquo; exclaimed Lolly.  &ldquo;Why Mother left her a lot of money in her will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did!&rdquo; cried Duke, sitting up.  &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. George. She told me some time  ago. That was when she was sweet on mums. Then they had a falling out, and  George told me she was afraid Mummie would change her will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too easy,&rdquo; growled Parke. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the way all the detective stories work out. And it never is the one who was  afraid of being disinherited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know so much about  detectives,&rdquo; jeered Duke, &ldquo;what do you think about Dad&rsquo;s friend Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a hummer,&rdquo; Parke declared.  &ldquo;A regular A 1. But he&rsquo;s more human than the story book chaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; Duke informed  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he has common sense.  Also, he doesn&rsquo;t play the violin, nor take snuff, so far as I know, and he  doesn&rsquo;t jabber hifalutin stuff out of books. I bet he finds our murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to Heaven he does,&rdquo; echoed  Owen Bailey. &ldquo;Now, children, I have to go to New York in the morning. What do  you advise in the way of flowers? We want something nice, without having it too  ostentatious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baileys were always ready for  a conference and the merits of crossed palms, blankets of violets and orchid  showers were vigorously discussed.</p>
<p>The Duchess as usual, cast the  deciding vote and Owen Bailey made a memorandum of her wishes.</p>
<p>Then she went off with Duke for a  walk round the grounds until dinner time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Br-r-r, it&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; she shivered,  as she drew her great fur coat round her, &ldquo;and isn&rsquo;t it queer not to be allowed  off the place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you want to go?&rdquo; asked  her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere at all, but since I can&rsquo;t  go outside the gates, I want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we could, if we  explained to the patrolmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then if we could, I don&rsquo;t  want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a contradictory lot you  women are! Let&rsquo;s go down and watch them cut ice in the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went toward the icehouse,  near which the ice cutting took place, but they were too late. The ice cutters  had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; Martha said; &ldquo;it  always makes me cringe with the cold when I see them at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t mind it,&rdquo; Duke told  her. &ldquo;They work so hard and so fast, they keep warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duke,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who did that  stabbing act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he returned,  speaking slowly. &ldquo;I hate to think it was old George, but when Lolly said Mother  had left her some money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must have been George,  unless, they dig up those old enemies of Father Bailey&rsquo;s. You see, it all  depends on whether she was mistaken for him or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if she was, then, not  having got him this time, they&rsquo;ll try for him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hope it too hard. It may be  the only thing that will save you from suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Duke, don&rsquo;t say such horrid  things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, dear, change your  attitude a little. Act more like a normal, innocent woman. First thing you  know, you&rsquo;ll find yourself arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush your nonsense. I won&rsquo;t  listen to you. I&rsquo;m going back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cooper prepared an extra fine  dinner, to which Duke did full justice, but the others merely picked at. Even  Lolly and Parke, usually care-free and hungry, ate almost nothing and seemed  unable to talk or smile.</p>
<p>After dinner, Owen Bailey shut  himself into his study, Duke and his wife went to their rooms, Parke and Lolly  chose separate corners of the library and tried to read, while Marigold Burt,  wandered round the house, singing her old fashioned songs until she nearly  drove crazy all who heard her.</p>
<p>Earlier than usual they all went  to bed, and the moonlight fell unheeded on Owen Bailey, still sleeping in his  wife&rsquo;s room, and wondering whether he could ever go back to his own.</p>
<p>Stone had advised him not to  occupy his own room for the present, and to lock his doors, wherever he slept.</p>
<p>Bailey, though nervously timorous,  was not a physical coward, but, having promised Stone, he kept his word.</p>
<p>Nothing happened during the night,  and the silvery Maximilian stood in the bright flood of moonlight, looking very  militant and mediaeval.</p>
<p>Next morning Bailey left for New  York, before the others were astir. He had to do this in order to get back in  time for the funeral.</p>
<p>But the business at the office was  imperative, and he made the fastest possible trip.</p>
<p>It was his habit much of the time  to go to the office twice a week. If the weather permitted he went by motor,  otherwise by train.</p>
<p>He found his employees  respectfully sympathetic, and he spoke courteously to them as he told them the  main facts of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Though not revered in his home,  Bailey was looked up to by his office people, all of whom appreciated his great  business ability and efficiency.</p>
<p>Of his private secretary, he asked  a few questions. &ldquo;Has Mr. Stone been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she answered,  &ldquo;yesterday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he talk about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The anonymous letters you have  received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I knew. He said he had your  authority for his inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, he had. And how  much did you know, to tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him when the first one  came, and that thereafter, you had all the mail carried to you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I feared more of the  things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I told him you had had  three more,&mdash;of course, as you ran the letters over, I couldn&rsquo;t help seeing  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Miss Martin.  You did exactly right. I just want to know how matters stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he asked some questions  about Mr. Sheridan.&rdquo; Bailey nodded. &ldquo;Nothing intrusive, just about his  habits and ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to expenditures or  extravagance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you answered to the best  of your knowledge and belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. I said nothing about  the races, until he did, and then, I admitted I had heard about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick, Miss Martin,  discreet, yet doing your duty. Thank you. Now, for to-day&rsquo;s grist, and we will  rush it as much as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it came about, that Fleming  Stone finished up his business in the course of the morning and Owen Bailey did  also, and they were both back at Cricklemere at nearly the same time.</p>
<p>They found a late lunch awaiting  them, and then had more than an hour before time for the funeral.</p>
<p>So they foregathered in the study  with Hale and Hunter and Detective Whitney to tell them about the inquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; much to tell,&rdquo; said  Coroner Hale, in a dissatisfied tone. &ldquo;I still think there&rsquo;s a lot more to  learn from Mrs. Duke Bailey, but there was no gettin&rsquo; it out of her. And that  there Miss Burt, I don&rsquo;t get at all. She says one thing one minute and  contradicts it the next, and then says she didn&rsquo;t contradict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do, finally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adjourned, of course, there was  nothin&rsquo; else to do. Adjourned for a week, by which time we&rsquo;ll have to find out  something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found out something,&rdquo; Stone  said, and Whitney began to look more interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to see an eminent  Graphologist,&mdash;a handwriting expert, you know, and I showed him the various  letters. He was greatly interested, but he couldn&rsquo;t do much. It&rsquo;s a queer  situation. He says,&rdquo; Stone turned to Bailey, now, &ldquo;he is positive that that  latest letter you received was written by one or other of those two persons. I  mean, Kennedy or Dunbar. There are definite and unmistakable evidences that  point, or seem to point to both. He was greatly interested and wants a little  more time to decide between the two writers. But he is sure that one of them  did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they are both supposed to be  dead,&rdquo; Owen Bailey said, fear again coming into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so we must investigate their  history,&rdquo; Stone went on. &ldquo;If one is proved to be dead, that lightens our work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they&rsquo;re both dead?&rdquo; asked  Hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re all at sea,&rdquo; Stone  admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s where you  are,&rdquo; the Sheriff declared, with a frown. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t cotton much to those  skyentific rackets. Specially that handwriting business. I think that&rsquo;s just  his way of gettin&rsquo; out of it, sayin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s like both of their fists. I thought  handwriting was like fingerprints, no two alike. And here you got duplicates  right off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is indicative to know  that the characteristics of both these men show in the new note,&rdquo; Stone said, a  little stiffly, for he was himself a bit nonplused at the expert&rsquo;s report.  &ldquo;However, we shall know more about that later on. Then I looked up the matter  of the aluminum strip. I find there are no machines of that sort in the  stations or waiting rooms of New York City. So it must have been stamped out  down at Coney Island, or some such resort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not specially helpful,&rdquo; grunted  Sheriff Hunter. &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I learned that Arthur Dunbar  is alive, and is in Africa now, still engaged in exploration and big game  hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, is that so!&rdquo; exclaimed  Bailey, his face showing stark amazement. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he added, quickly, &ldquo;that  leaves only the possibility of Kennedy. It must be Kennedy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slumped down in his chair,  looking as if the very last drop of courage had oozed away from his finger  tips.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone felt pity for him,  rather than scorn, for he knew that the inferiority feeling, which Bailey so  often showed, could not be accompanied by great bravery and had little in  common with the characteristic known as grit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; he said,  cheerily. &ldquo;This may make it the more easy for us to nail Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather it had been the other  way,&rdquo; Bailey said, striving to show a bolder front, and succeeding to a degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; the  Sheriff promised. &ldquo;Now that we know the feller you want, we&rsquo;ll get him! Good  work, Mr. Stone. How&rsquo;d you manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to Travel Bureaus and  Lecture concerns and the Museum of Natural History, and got a little here and a  little there and then pieced it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re on our way now, but  we&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow about this Kennedy bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strong arms of the law  departed, and Owen Bailey rose wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doomed, Stone,&rdquo; he said, dejectedly.  &ldquo;If Kennedy is alive and after me, he&rsquo;ll never let up till he gets me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, take a brighter view of it  than that,&rdquo; urged Stone, with a cheerfulness that was entirely feigned, for he  was himself downcast by the thought of the dreaded Kennedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, anyway,&rdquo; Stone went on, &ldquo;put  Kennedy out of your mind for the present. You are going to your wife&rsquo;s funeral,  the last mark of respect you can pay the lady. Don&rsquo;t let your soul be in a  black torment of fear, because of your enemy. Let your thoughts dwell on higher  and holier things, at least for this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This good advice struck an  answering chord in Owen Bailey&rsquo;s heart, and he went away to prepare for the  services.</p>
<p>Stone had told him that he himself  might be late at the church, and would drop into one of the rear seats.</p>
<p>The detective planned to be late,  because he had some matters to attend to at Cricklemere before he went, if  indeed, he went at all.</p>
<p>When the family had all gone and  most of the servants, Stone started on a round of the bedrooms. He wanted to  make a search on his own account, not relying entirely on others&rsquo; reports.</p>
<p>He concluded to start with the  room in which Mrs. Bailey had died.</p>
<p>He went up the wide stairs,  pausing a moment to admire Max, who was a type of antique that greatly appealed  to Stone. He scrutinized the shining armor, from visor to spurs, and noted the  immaculate condition of the polished metal.</p>
<p>Then he went on his way, and  entered the room of the tragedy.</p>
<p>As was his habit he stepped  softly, though he felt sure there was no one else in the house save for a few  servants in the domestic offices.</p>
<p>But once inside the room, he was  certain he heard a footstep in the next room, the boudoir.</p>
<p>Going near the closed door, he  listened and heard some one moving about, then silence.</p>
<p>He flung open the door with a  sudden gesture, and saw, reclining on the chaise lounge the small figure of  Agnes the parlor maid.</p>
<p>Her lovely face was framed in a  pile of lace pillows, and over her was drawn a silk and lace coverlet.</p>
<p>Her eyes were closed, but as Stone  entered she opened them and gazed blankly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you want me, sir?&rdquo; she asked  rising on one elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know what you are doing  here! What do you mean by using Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s boudoir in this fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;yes,&mdash;yes, sir. Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agnes rose from the couch,  smoothed down her apron, and stood prettily at attention.</p>
<p>Stone looked at her closely.</p>
<p>Was she the absolute fool she  seemed, or was she playing a part?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t answered me,&rdquo; he  said, with a patient but persistent air. &ldquo;What are you doing here in Mrs.  Bailey&rsquo;s boudoir, lying on her couch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;well, you see,&mdash;I thought it  wouldn&rsquo;t matter to anybody, and I&mdash;I just wanted to see how it would seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words came out with a  rush, and the lovely face flushed a soft pink.</p>
<p>Though not at all susceptible to  woman&rsquo;s wiles, Stone couldn&rsquo;t take his eyes off the troubled little face, all  the lovelier for its blush of embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so that&rsquo;s it. You just wanted  to see how it felt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose there&rsquo;s no great  harm in that. But take my advice and don&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old enough to know better, then.  Run along, and remember what I said about not cutting up that trick again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spread the coverlet over the  couch, and piled the pillows with loving care, patting each one into place. She  showed no embarrassment, no self-consciousness, and utterly ignored Stone&rsquo;s  presence.</p>
<p>Then, all being arranged to her  liking she quietly went away.</p>
<p>A tap at the window drew Stone&rsquo;s  attention.</p>
<p>Turning, he saw the boy, Jimmy  Paddock, standing on the balcony outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemmein,&rdquo; he whispered, and Stone  did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! It&rsquo;s cold outside,&rdquo; he  exclaimed, blowing on his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Jimmy,&rdquo; Stone bade him.  &ldquo;Put your hands near the radiator,&mdash;not on it. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I druv Doc Hale to the  funeral, and I&rsquo;m pokin&rsquo; around waitin&rsquo; fer him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why come up here, and how&rsquo;d you  get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have ways of evadin&rsquo; the  constabulario!&rdquo; Jimmy chuckled. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Mr. Stone. I spicioned as  how that sassy brat of a Agnes was puttin&rsquo; one over on you, and I came along to  put you wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with  Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s all there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you ask me, I&rsquo;ll say  I am not quite sure she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you ain&rsquo;t? Well, then, lemme  tell you she&rsquo;s very, very much all there! She&rsquo;s as cute as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now, Jimmy, they come pretty  cute, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No cuter&rsquo;n Agnes Ames. She was up  here for a purpose, she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What purpose, think you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, I know. She was  seein&rsquo; could she adopt a few trifles of Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s belongin&rsquo;s, that nobody&rsquo;d  miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all this is outside my  territory. I&rsquo;m not here to watch the petty pilfering of parlor maids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better watch her. I&rsquo;ve  known her twenty-two years&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away! She just told me she was  sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you swallowed it, I s&rsquo;pose!  Well she was born the same year I was and I&rsquo;m twenty-two. Her mother and my  mother is cousins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, all women forget their  age on occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, if you don&rsquo;t  care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should I care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno. Fergit it. Can I do  anything for you, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jimmy, drive me over to the  church, if you will. I want to go to the funeral, even if I&rsquo;m a bit late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be very late, sir, come  along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone reached the church in time  for the last of the service, and sat in a rear pew, where he could watch the  people as they went out.</p>
<p>He was surprised at the expression  on Owen Bailey&rsquo;s face. The look of fear was gone, and in its place was a  peaceful calm that amazed the detective. He had been told that Bailey was a  religious man, now he believed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  Mr. Bailey Concocts His Famous Punch</b></h2>
<p>As might be expected, the evening  at Cricklemere after the funeral was depressing.</p>
<p>They all gathered in the living  room, each feeling a desire for the company of his fellows.</p>
<p>Sheridan was there for the week-end,  and as he and Stone were the guests, they felt it incumbent on them to try to  cheer up the others.</p>
<p>But their efforts failed, and at  last Duke said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shirk the subject? We all  want to talk about it, yet we refrain from bringing it up. Out with it, I say.  Dad, you&rsquo;re holding something back. Why don&rsquo;t you tell us? If you&rsquo;d rather,  we&rsquo;ll send the kids out of the room. I mean Parke and Lolly. The Duchess and I  can stand anything you have to tell us, but I object to being kept in the  dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey looked uncertainly at  Stone before he answered his son.</p>
<p>Immediately Lolly spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just guess you won&rsquo;t send me  out! I&rsquo;m Daddy&rsquo;s favorite child, and he wants me around all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you get that  pleasing fiction of yours about being a favorite,&rdquo; Parke said, frowning at her,  &ldquo;but if you enjoy it, keep right on thinking it&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve never heard Father  say anything of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; said Lolly,  making a face at her brother. &ldquo;Actions speak louder than words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went over and sat by her  father, who absent-mindedly put an arm round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, child,&rdquo; he said, as she  essayed to speak further. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Stone, do you advise my telling Duke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no reason against it,&rdquo;  Stone replied. &ldquo;And it seems to me they may as well all know it. Parke and Miss  Lolly are not children, really, and I think they are entitled to be in the  know, as well as your elder son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; said Bailey,  &ldquo;you tell them, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Fleming Stone told the story of  the anonymous letters already received and the possibility of further ones. He  told, too, of the two men who had enmity toward Bailey, and who had been  supposed dead, though this was not a certainty.</p>
<p>The children listened, in shocked  silence. Albert Sheridan, too, was hearing much of it for the first time, while  Marigold Burt threatened to become hysterical.</p>
<p>She was in love with Owen Bailey,  she did hope to win his affection now that Blandena was gone, but these  revelations were so horrifying that she forgot all else in listening to Stone&rsquo;s  recital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; the detective concluded his tale, &ldquo;that is how the matter  stands. The death of Mrs. Bailey, I feel sure, was an error, the murderer  thinking he was attacking Mr. Bailey. This, of itself, is significant,  as showing the murderer was some one unfamiliar with the ways and habits of  this household. But, of course, it is not certain. It may be that the death  blow was intended for Mrs. Bailey, and was dealt by some one who had a  grievance or hatred against the lady. Now, sad-hearted though we are, we must  turn our thoughts to the future. There may be another attack on Mr. Bailey. We  must expect it and prepare for it. There is a guard on the place, but it is  insufficient. I think it should be augmented by several more men. This place is  so large, it is almost impossible to patrol it fully, but we must do all we can  in the way of safety. I well know the scorn of anonymous letters shown by story  books, but in real life, you will find that they are not always thrown in the  waste basket. And these letters though unsigned, are traceable to these two  enemies of Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s earlier life. I don&rsquo;t want you young people to feel  unduly nervous or anxious, but I do think it wiser that you should know about  it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little they care,&rdquo; said Marigold  Burt, spitefully. &ldquo;Duke and the Duchess there, wouldn&rsquo;t shed a tear if their  father was killed the same way Blandena was! Young people to-day have no love  or respect for their elders, they have no thought for anything but their own  silly pleasures and vices!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why, George,&rdquo; said Parke,  who often averted a stormy scene by his frivolity, &ldquo;how you do run on! And what  a lot you know about us youngsters! I hoped we kept our pet vices hidden from  your eagle eye, but I see I was mistaken. Say, dearie, why don&rsquo;t you sing us a  little song? How about Last Rose of Summer? I haven&rsquo;t heard that for nearly two  weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush your noise, Parke, you&rsquo;re a  rude boy!&rdquo; Miss Burt glared at him. &ldquo;Owen, why don&rsquo;t you make your children  behave with common decency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, children,&rdquo; said Bailey,  absently, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t rag at Marigold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, make us some punch,  will you, Dad?&rdquo; Parke suggested. &ldquo;Mr. Stone, you have never tasted anything  like my father&rsquo;s punch! It beats the nectar of the gods and all that sort of  thing. He&rsquo;s a past grand master at punch making. Shall I order up the stuff,  Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey looked pleased at his  boy&rsquo;s compliments, and explained apologetically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a family tradition, Mr.  Stone, that my punch is extra fine. It isn&rsquo;t really, but my children choose to  think it is, so I humor their fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl of Northumberland  appeared in answer to Parke&rsquo;s ring, and Bailey directed him to bring the  ingredients for a bowl of punch.</p>
<p>They came soon, and seeing the  wheeled cellarette, filled with myriad bottles, Stone began to think it would  be indeed a potent brew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, sir,&rdquo; said  Bailey, smiling at the detective&rsquo;s look of surprise. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t use all these  things, and only in small quantities, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Bailey set himself to his  task with a zest. He waited for a pot of tea, which, he said, must form the  basis for every self-respecting punch. He scrutinized, selected and discarded  various bottles of strange appearance and foreign labels. He rose and went to  his study, returning with a green sirup that he said was a priceless absinthe,  of which he should use but the merest dash.</p>
<p>The spirits of all began to rise,  in anticipation of the cheering beverage in prospect, and Parke made up to  Marigold for his rudeness by being especially kind and polite to her.</p>
<p>They were a nice lot, these  Baileys, Stone concluded, and felt anew the poignant regret at the fate of the  gentle mother who had been so tragically snatched away.</p>
<p>The concoction completed, Fuller  brought a tray of glasses and some tiny sandwiches and cakes, and all partook  of the celebrated punch.</p>
<p>It was pronounced fine, and the  opinion was satisfactorily proved by the glasses passed for refilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there isn&rsquo;t a headache in a  carload,&rdquo; said Bailey, as he let Lolly have a replenishing.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the punch  enlivened the sad hearts and while the mirth was not hilarious, the  conversation was light and cheery, even gay.</p>
<p>Sheridan told some good stories,  Marigold Burt, at Parke&rsquo;s urgent request sang &ldquo;Father, dear father, come home  with me now,&rdquo; a number that always brought down the house.</p>
<p>At a fairly early hour they all  went to bed, and by midnight quiet and silence had settled down on the house of  Cricklemere.</p>
<p>The next day, being Sunday,  everybody was late rising. Even the servants were granted an extra hour of  sleep, and nobody else was awakened until he chose to rise of his own accord.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock, Owen Bailey was  still in bed, but awake. He was in his wife&rsquo;s bedroom, not yet feeling like  returning to the other room, with its tragic associations. Indeed, he was  thinking he would keep his present room permanently, as there was no reason why  he should not do so.</p>
<p>He lay there, thinking he would  get up in a few moments, when there was a knock on his door, followed by the  entrance of Fuller with a letter on a tray. It was a Special Delivery letter  which explained its arrival on Sunday.</p>
<p>Mechanically Bailey took it. It  was not an unheard of thing for him to get a special delivery letter on Sunday,  and the butler thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I signed for it, sir,&rdquo; he said,  and Bailey nodded a dismissal.</p>
<p>Alone again, he stared at the  envelope. It was in the writing of the sender of the anonymous notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good notion to let Stone  open it,&rdquo; he thought, but decided against this, and taking a paper cutter from  Blandena&rsquo;s night table, he slit the envelope.</p>
<p>He read these lines:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Well, I suppose you think you  hoaxed me. But I will get you yet. Or it may be I will strike at you through  your dear ones. Expect me soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all, there was no  signature.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey gave a deep sigh, and  rose from his bed. Slowly he bathed and dressed, his thoughts all on the letter  he had just read.</p>
<p>He was usually down to breakfast  on Sunday morning at about half-past nine.</p>
<p>Lolly always joined him, she was  thoughtful of her father&rsquo;s pleasure, and Miss Burt generally appeared. The  others were likely to sleep longer.</p>
<p>On this Sunday, he was rather  later than usual. He stepped through the boudoir and through his own room and  went down the spiral stair to the study.</p>
<p>Then on, through the living room,  across the hall, and into the breakfast room.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone was there ahead of  him, but no one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, we are the early birds,&rdquo;  Bailey said, as he took his seat. &ldquo;Well Mr. Stone, I can sing the hymn, &lsquo;Safely  through another night,&rsquo; at any rate. Yet I may never see another dawn. I&rsquo;ve had  a letter this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the same?&rdquo; Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the same. But eat your  breakfast, man. The letter will keep. After a while we can have a confab, by  ourselves. Try Mrs. Cooper&rsquo;s kidney omelette. They are always good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will. But let me see  the letter. What does it say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, here it is. No, stop,  here comes George! Wait till later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey put the letter back in his  pocket and Miss Burt came in.</p>
<p>She looked stolid and stupid,  Stone thought. But when he greeted her, she responded pleasantly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Lolly?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s  often the first one down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Lolly burst into  the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;oh, Daddy,  Max&rsquo;s hands are gone!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What, child? What are you talking  about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max! On the stairs! His hands are  gone, his gauntlets, you know. Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands gone? Gauntlets gone? I  don&rsquo;t understand. Stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, but they&rsquo;re  gone. Come and see!&rdquo; She tried to drag him away from the table, but he smiled  at her, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat your breakfast, Baby. We&rsquo;ll  see about Max afterward. Probably Fuller took them off to polish them or  something. A rivet loose, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, all right, then. But it  scared me stiff. And he looks so funny without his hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice it, George?&rdquo;  Bailey asked of Miss Burt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I hurried down the  stairs, and it&rsquo;s a dark day. I noticed nothing unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. I&rsquo;m an observant  chap, you know. But I assumed, as Mr. Bailey says, they had been taken away to  be polished or something of the sort. That armor comes apart easily, you know.  That is, well made armor does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max is certainly well made,&rdquo; Owen  Bailey declared, with the pride of the possessor.</p>
<p>Albert Sheridan appeared, but he  said he had not looked at the armor at all, and the subject was dropped. Soon  after, Duke&rsquo;s voice was heard, calling from the floor above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone, will you come up here,  please? Right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone rose and hastened from the  room, and ran up the stairs, to find Duke, fully dressed, standing outside the  open door of his wife&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
<p>He was white as a ghost and  trembling all over.</p>
<p>He tried to speak, but choked on  the words. &ldquo;She&mdash; Martha&mdash;she&rsquo;s go&mdash;go in and look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone entered the room,  and saw a sight which he was never able to forget as long as he lived.</p>
<p>The Duchess, the exquisite,  beautiful Martha, lay dead in her bed, but by the hand of a fiend!</p>
<p>She had been strangled, but her  torn and bleeding throat proved that something more brutal than human hands had  done the awful deed. Nor was the truth hidden. Beside her, on the bed, lay the  two gauntlets that were Maximilian&rsquo;s hands! Some one had taken these from the  armor, had donned them, and with them had crushed out the life of that lovely  girl.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone&rsquo;s first thought was  that the humiliation of his life had come upon him! Of what use was his  assistance? What had he done toward preventing this terrible thing? He had  tacitly assumed that though tragedy might come, yet nothing serious would  happen immediately. True, he had no reason for this assumption, no right to  predicate a respite.</p>
<p>He knew now, with a sickening  knowledge, he ought to have taken more precautions, had a stronger guard of  police, a watchman in the house,&mdash;he ought to have stayed awake himself,&mdash;oh,  there were a dozen things he could have done that might have staved off this  horror!</p>
<p>He did not, he could not look  again at the dreadful sight.</p>
<p>Nor could he say anything to Duke,  who stood, dazed and trembling before him.</p>
<p>He held out his hand and shrank  from the limp response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, and grasping  Duke&rsquo;s arm, he led him down the stairs. He took him into the living room, and  seated him on the big davenport, then went himself to the breakfast room.</p>
<p>His absence from the room had been  so short that no one had followed him.</p>
<p>All at the table turned startled  faces toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another blow has fallen,&rdquo; Stone  said, thinking it more merciful to tell the worst at once than to prolong the  suspense. &ldquo;Martha has been killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With darting eyes he watched the  expression on each face.</p>
<p>The Baileys, one and all shrank  beneath the blow, but Stone fancied he caught a faint smile of triumph in Miss  Burt&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>And also, he was almost certain  that Albert Sheridan smothered a sudden gleam as he dropped his own eyes before  Stone&rsquo;s scrutiny.</p>
<p>What did it all mean? Surely,  surely, none of these people was responsible for this death, or had any secret  knowledge of it.</p>
<p>Fuller, who was in the shadow of  the screen that hid the door of his pantry from those at table, stepped  forward, with a properly solemn countenance.</p>
<p>But here, too, Stone had the vague  but no less positive feeling that the butler was not overcome with grief at the  death of the Duchess. He remembered that the brusque manners of Martha had not  endeared her to the family and her overbearing ways with the servants had made  them actively dislike her. But surely they would forget petty dislikes in the  face of a tragedy such as this.</p>
<p>Then he remembered no one of them  knew, as yet, how terrible the conditions were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very dreadful,&rdquo; he went on,  still feeling the worst must be told and it was better to get it over. &ldquo;The  brute who killed her, must have taken the gauntlets from the armor on the  stairs, put them on himself and then strangled Mrs. Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scream from Lolly brought Parke  to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still,&rdquo; her brother  whispered. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t control yourself, go to your room. Have a thought for  Dad and Duke, don&rsquo;t put all your sympathy on your silly self!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harsh words, but they served the  purpose Parke intended.</p>
<p>Lolly stopped screaming as  suddenly as she had begun, and flying to her father&rsquo;s side, she sat quietly  down and slipped her little hand into his.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey gripped her fingers  until she nearly cried with pain, but she realized he didn&rsquo;t know he was doing  that, and she bore the hurt until she could wriggle loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s up there with the Duchess?&rdquo;  Parke said, in a frightened whisper</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;There  should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Parke offered, which was  real bravery on the boy&rsquo;s part, for he had a fear of death.</p>
<p>No one seemed to want to go with  him, so the lad went off alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one else ought to go, too,&rdquo;  Stone said. &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Owen Bailey directed, &ldquo;you  stay here. This is your place. Marigold, go up and stay by Parke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Burt would have gone down to  Avernus if Owen Bailey had bade her go, so, though she hated the errand, she  obeyed him. She left the room and joined Parke, who stood outside Martha&rsquo;s  door, not daring to go in.</p>
<p>Those left in the breakfast room,  by common consent rose and went into the living room, where Duke sat, exactly  as Stone had left him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, boy,&rdquo; said his father  sitting down beside him, and clasping his arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through this, and  now&mdash;you! Oh, my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey&rsquo;s voice shook, but  Duke paid no attention to him. He seemed physically stunned, and Lolly ran back  to the breakfast room and returned with a cup of strong coffee.</p>
<p>She bade Duke drink it, and still  with that dazed, semi-conscious air, he did so, draining the cup.</p>
<p>Then he returned to his apathy,  and Stone advised letting him alone for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;we would better hear the letter you received this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and taking it from  his pocket, Bailey handed it to Stone.</p>
<p>The detective read it aloud:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Well, I suppose you think you  hoaxed me. But I will get you yet. Or it may be I will strike at you through  your dear ones. Expect me soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, I think settles it.&rdquo; It was  Duke who spoke, and to the surprise of all, he spoke in his own natural voice,  and showed no trace now of the dazed air he had worn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no doubt, Father,  that it is those enemies, or one of them, you told us about. I suppose they  will not stop till they have wiped out the family. It seems to me that it is up  to you to go away from here.&rdquo; The young man spoke slowly, clearly, but with a  veiled ferocity that made his hearers shudder.</p>
<p>Stone thought he had never heard  such concentrated hate in a human voice.</p>
<p>There was some excuse for Duke,  when one remembered the fearful death of his wife, but it seemed to Stone even  that horror scarcely justified Duke&rsquo;s attitude toward his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away from here,&rdquo; said Owen  Bailey, slowly, &ldquo;so that they may kill me and leave you all in peace? Is that  what you mean, Duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Duke looked his father full  in the face, &ldquo;yes, that is what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Albert Sheridan,  rising and going to Duke, &ldquo;you shall not talk to your father like that in my  presence, at any rate! You are an inhuman scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Albert,&rdquo; Owen  Bailey interrupted him. &ldquo;Duke is beside himself, and I don&rsquo;t wonder. I&rsquo;m not  surprised, son, and I will go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t discuss that now,&rdquo; said  Fleming Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much else to be done.  Do you all realize this means a repetition of the police and the coroner and  all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my heavens!&rdquo; cried Lolly. &ldquo;We  may as well establish a resident jury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not mean to be  flippant, but they were all so accustomed to persiflage and also her nerves  were so taut, that she was liable to break out in any direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheridan,&rdquo; Stone said,  wanting to get action, &ldquo;will you telephone for Doctor Fenn. Tell him the case  is urgent, but don&rsquo;t give details over the wire. I shall go up and look at the  body, but I don&rsquo;t advise the rest of you to come&mdash;just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Stone really meant was to  look at the room, he had seen the body all he cared to. But he felt he must get  a survey of the room before the police came, in the hope of finding some real  clew to these terrible murders.</p>
<p>He found Marigold and Parke  outside the bedroom, neither of them willing to go inside after taking one  brief glance.</p>
<p>Stone went in and closed the door.</p>
<p>The dead woman was just as he had  before seen her. A closer inspection told him that while she may have been  strangled, her throat was also cut and bruised by the cruel fingers of the  steel gauntlets. How could any human brain conceive such a fiendish way of  killing?</p>
<p>Automatically, it seemed to Stone,  that precluded any member of the household having had a hand in it. No one  under that roof could do such a Satanic deed.</p>
<p>His thoughts flew to the big game  hunter. It could be imagined of him. </p>
<p>Or the other one, John Kennedy.  His hatred of Bailey,&mdash;if he wrote those letters, was so deep and unending, he  might stop at nothing to distress and grieve his enemy.</p>
<p>But that was for further  investigation. Just now, he was all for searching this bedroom.</p>
<p>He looked all about and searched  everywhere, but nothing could he find of the slightest use or information, save  one thing.</p>
<p>That was a slip of aluminum,  precisely like the one found before, and bearing the same words, &ldquo;Vengeance is  Mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It lay on the toilet table, and  Stone picked it up gingerly, by its edge in order to avoid marring possible  finger prints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though a murderer like this one  will leave no finger marks,&rdquo; he told himself. Nor could he see any on the  surface of the aluminum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brutal,&rdquo; he said to himself,  &ldquo;callous, heartless and diabolically clever! Those are the characteristics of  this Master Murderer. How much farther will he go? Until he gets Bailey,  himself, of course. But the fiendish thing is killing all these innocent  victims. This was no mistake, whether the death of the older Mrs. Bailey was or  not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my first failure has yet to  come. I wonder if it is to be this case. I confess I don&rsquo;t know which way to  turn. But first of all the guard must be strengthened. Then these two men must  be tracked down, either found or proved dead. And Bailey himself must be  protected. He&rsquo;s likely to be the next victim. Well, I have my work cut out for  me. Can I complete it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing I vow.&rdquo; He stepped to  the side of the dead woman and raised his right hand. &ldquo;If I do not discover and  punish your murderer, I will never take up another case!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  As to the Maximilian Armor</b></h2>
<p>Fleming Stone went to his own room  and locked himself in.</p>
<p>He felt he must have a few moments  alone to consider this new tragedy. It totally upset a theory that had been  forming in his mind, and opened out new possibilities of deviltry.</p>
<p>Stone thought back over the night.  The murder must have been committed during the small hours. He was no doctor,  but the condition of the body told him that much. Now why had he not heard any  footstep in the hall? To be sure there were two large rooms, also some closets  and bathrooms between his own room and the bedroom of Mrs. Duke, but he was  sensitive to a prowling footstep, however light. And always, after he was ready  to go to sleep, he set his room door ajar, for the purpose of hearing any  unusual sound.</p>
<p>Yet, had he done this last night?  He couldn&rsquo;t quite remember, but it seemed to him that when he left his room to  go to breakfast, he had to open the door.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;he thought deeply,&mdash;then he  had been unusually sleepy last night, and had slept unusually soundly. This  would explain his hearing no sound.</p>
<p>But why had he slept so well?</p>
<p>The punch! Yes, that was it. That  punch had been very good, and he had taken more than one glass of it. Of  course, it made him extra sleepy.</p>
<p>But, though abstemious enough,  Stone was not a teetotaller, and often he had had a stronger night-cap than  that, without any effect at all.</p>
<p>Was the punch drugged?</p>
<p>Not likely, for they all had it,  and none of the family showed any dullness or lethargy in the morning.</p>
<p>Moreover, who would drug the stuff  and why?</p>
<p>Stone, in his mind, ran rapidly  over the lot, and found that the only ones who could possibly be suspect, were  George and Duke, himself.</p>
<p>It was too terrible to think of  Duke in connection with that brutal murder of his wife, but Fleming Stone was  accustomed to looking his thoughts in the face, and he had heard rumors of the  quarrels that were frequent between Duke and Martha.</p>
<p>Duke&rsquo;s room was next to his  wife&rsquo;s, at the end of the long hall. If everybody was sleeping soundly,  heavily, because of a drugged drink, Duke could easily go to the armor on the  stairs, take the gauntlets from the figure and use them as a weapon.</p>
<p>Somebody had done it, and who else  would have even the shadow of a motive?</p>
<p>Yes, there was Miss Burt. Big and  strong enough to do the deed, hateful and vindictive enough to commit a crime,  possessed of a fearful temper, of which he had been told, though he had never  seen it manifested.</p>
<p>He balked at the thought of Miss  Burt, yet who else was there?</p>
<p>Owen Bailey and the two youngsters  were out of the question, and though his mind wandered to Albert Sheridan,  there was no real reason to suspect him.</p>
<p>Yet it must have been somebody in  the house, for the grounds outside were patrolled day and night.</p>
<p>Queer about that punch. He must  make some discreet inquiries.</p>
<p>Then, hearing steps in the hall,  he opened his door to see Doctor Fenn&rsquo;s tall form striding along toward  Martha&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>He followed, and went into the  room with the doctor.</p>
<p>Parke, who had brought the doctor  up, turned and fled from the scene. He had had all he wanted of this new  horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most awful sight I have ever  seen,&rdquo; said Fenn, gravely, as he looked at the dead woman. &ldquo;I have seen some  awful deaths in my day, but nothing like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He quickly completed the necessary  examination, and then stood, fairly quivering with fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanging is too good for this  killer!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Electrocution is too merciful! The villain should be  tortured! Mr. Stone, can you track him down, or are you at your wits&rsquo; end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Stone said,  slowly. &ldquo;Do you think he is a homicidal maniac, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no show of  frantic or furious action. See, the coverlets are scarcely disturbed, the body  is not distorted or tossed about. It looks as if he had come in silently, and  with those gauntlets on his hands had quickly and quietly choked her to death.  She died from strangulation, though those scratches and bleeding wounds are  also the result of the murderer&rsquo;s ferocity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could a woman have done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fenn looked at the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, slowly, &ldquo;a  strong, muscular woman could do it. Miss Burt could, but not Lolly or any of  the women servants here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well do you know Miss Burt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well enough,&rdquo; Fenn spoke in a  short, crisp tone. &ldquo;She is neurotic and self-repressed. An old maid, she  realizes the fact, but is not reconciled to it. This brings about mental  disorders, and makes her, at times, irresponsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really irresponsible? Capable of  an imperative impulse to crime&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t go so far as that. It  might be,&mdash;it could be possible, but without definite evidence I am not ready to  say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing must be said, without  evidence. But just between you and me, Doctor Fenn, do you know of any motive  Miss Burt might have had for wanting both these women out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, Mr. Stone, I don&rsquo;t want  to be quoted, but in the interests of truth and justice, I feel I ought to say  yes to that. Marigold Burt is very much in love with Owen Bailey, and she is  also in love with Duke Bailey. It isn&rsquo;t real love, you understand, it&rsquo;s the  result of her repressed, denied nature. She is at an age where these things  reach a climax, she is naturally romantic and sentimental, she is tortured by  jealousy and envy when she sees other women happy and contented with their  homes and husbands and children, while she is denied all those things. Many  unmarried women feel this way, but not all to the extent Marigold Burt does.  So, as a medical man, I say she could commit murder, but I have no valid or  definite reason to think she did. That&rsquo;s all I can say, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, doctor, keep your eye  on her, from your point of view, and I&rsquo;ll watch her from mine. I, too, can&rsquo;t  really suspect her, but we have to leave no loopholes. The fact of two women  being killed is odd of itself, unless a woman did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone went downstairs, then, and  found the living room crowded with people.</p>
<p>Sheriff Hunter, Constable Leary,  Coroner Hale and Detective Whitney were all there, and in far less polite and  deferential mood than they had been the day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain on the face of it,&rdquo;  the sheriff was shouting, &ldquo;that these murders are being done by some one in the  house! We have the grounds patrolled, and now, we shall put a man in the house.  Either a member of this family or one of the servants must be responsible for  these two crimes, and no one here present is to leave the premises except by my  express and individual permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four Baileys, Miss Burt and  Albert Sheridan were grouped together in one end of the room, while the frightened  servants huddled at the other end.</p>
<p>Except for the majestic calm shown  by the Earl of Northumberland, the whole staff were white-faced and trembling.</p>
<p>Agnes, her ethereal beauty set off  by her smart black dress and white cap and apron, kept close to Mrs. Cooper,  with the others ranged in rows behind them.</p>
<p>The sheriff, his voice still  raised to a loud pitch, stormed at Mrs. Cooper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that there figger on the  stairs, all in order yesterday?&rdquo; he bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order, sir? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cooper was not at all afraid  of him, and spoke in a quiet, low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say! Was it all  right? Shipshape? Hands, or gloves, or whatever you call &rsquo;em, in their right  place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, so far as I know. It&rsquo;s  Agnes&rsquo; work to dust the stairs. Was Max all right, Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; came in a whisper  from the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do them hands come off easy?&rdquo; he  went on, glaring round for whoever would, to answer him.</p>
<p>As nobody else spoke, Parke  volunteered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, undismayed at the  sheriff&rsquo;s truculence, &ldquo;yes, you just give &rsquo;em a twist and off they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. I&rsquo;ve lived with that chap  for twenty years. I&rsquo;ve had him all to pieces and put him together again, many a  time. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you take off those tin gloves  last night and kill your sister-in-law with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy. They&rsquo;re not made of tin,  and I didn&rsquo;t do the killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parke&rsquo;s lightness vanished. He  suddenly looked both anxious and menacing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I wish I did! I&rsquo;d  gladly use those gauntlets on his own beastly throat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s grave demeanor, and the  concentrated wrath in his tone, robbed his speech of any effect of melodrama or  bombast. He was so terribly in earnest that the sheriff was impressed, and  became a little quieter in his procedure.</p>
<p>Stone, seeing that this same  procedure was likely to be both long and slow, rose from his seat and went into  the library. As he passed, he nodded to Whitney to follow him, which that young  man gladly did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many various and sundry sorts  of fool that sheriff is,&rdquo; Stone said, in a calm, dispassionate tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is,&rdquo; agreed Whitney. &ldquo;But  what matter? A sheriff can&rsquo;t unravel a mystery like this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor a detective, either!&rdquo;  exclaimed Stone, whose nerves were a little frazzled this morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not a detective,&rdquo; Whitney  smiled, &ldquo;but how about two detectives? I have found out some few things, Mr.  Stone, and I&rsquo;d like to talk them over with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, boy. You can&rsquo;t begin  too soon! For the first time in my career, I feel really and truly up against  it. And yet, it is a detective axiom, that the more unusual and bizarre the  crime, the easier it is of solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place, I find  on good authority that Duke Bailey and his wife were not on good terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been here in the house  with them a couple of days, and they seemed to me like turtle doves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, before folks. But they  were quarrelsome when alone, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? Who can say when  they&rsquo;re alone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I made up to that lily  maid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I call her, to myself,  &lsquo;Elaine, the fair, Elaine, the lovable, Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat.&rsquo;  Isn&rsquo;t she like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In looks, yes. How does she  talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, except what you drag  out of her. I don&rsquo;t get her at all. She has no idea of her own beauty. Not a  particular of S. A. or even vanity. But if you hammer at her, you get some slow  dribbles of information. Well, she is ladies&rsquo; maid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to Mrs. Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but sometimes she does some  pressing or odd jobs for her, and when she has chanced to be with the Dukes  when they were otherwise alone, she says they quarreled just awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I see no reason not to.  She&rsquo;s no gossip or babbler, and I think when she does talk she tells the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, for a minute, there  was enough bad blood there for Duke to kill his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I think so yet, but  I&rsquo;m leaning that way. Anyway, I think somebody in the house did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, then, is where you and I  don&rsquo;t agree. I think it was an outsider, one of those old time enemies of Mr.  Bailey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be. I bow, of course, to  your superior judgment and greater experience. But how could the anonymous  gentleman get in last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the guard, though  well-intentioned, is not large enough. A big place like this would need an army  to patrol it thoroughly. I&rsquo;ll bet I could go in and out without being seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so could I. And the house is  never entirely locked up. I found that out from the under servants. The pompous  Fuller is supposed to lock it all up every night, but he never does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, the anonymous letter  writer can come and go at his pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so long as he is quiet about  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was certainly quiet about it  last night.&rdquo; Stone looked thoughtful. &ldquo;I am a very light sleeper, but I heard  no footstep. Yet there must have been some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hall carpets are very thick  and soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but that doesn&rsquo;t preclude  my hearing a step. Or, perhaps it isn&rsquo;t exactly hearing. I daresay I feel the  vibration or the atmospheric movement or something. Anyhow, I didn&rsquo;t last  night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, remembering, he told Whitney  about the punch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would explain it,&rdquo; the young  detective said. &ldquo;And it needn&rsquo;t have been drugged. The mixed drink would be  soporific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in my case,&rdquo; Stone persisted.  &ldquo;I still think it was doctored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Bailey mixed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but some one else could have  added a mild narcotic. Merely a trace, for nobody was much affected. Say, just  enough to make us all sleep soundly, yet not as if drugged. I say, Whitney,  scoot up and take a look in the various medicine chests, will you? I don&rsquo;t want  to put myself on record as yet, but you can do it, in your official capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will,&rdquo; and the young man  walked calmly across the living room, where the coroner was now conducting the  inquiry, and went, unnoticed, up the stairs.</p>
<p>He paused to look at Maximilian,  who, denuded of his steel gauntlets was a sorry sight.</p>
<p>Whitney went at his task,  methodically, and swiftly, and soon rejoined Stone with his report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a smitch of anything of the  sort in any medicine cabinet except Duke&rsquo;s. His, in his bathroom, contained  both sulphonal and veronal, either of which would do the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, they would. But that  bathroom is Mrs. Duke&rsquo;s as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But we aren&rsquo;t  suspecting her. Probably the stuff was hers. It&rsquo;s what women take when they  can&rsquo;t sleep. And a perfect vehicle for Duke&rsquo;s purpose, if he just wanted to  insure sound sleep for all last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort in Miss  Burt&rsquo;s bathroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort anywhere but  where I told you. I looked thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good egg, but doesn&rsquo;t it strike  you that whoever used it, if anybody did, would destroy or hide the container?  I think the fact that Duke left it there, in plain sight, rather lets him out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t think that. Let&rsquo;s  ask him and see how he reacts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, later on. Besides, if  Mrs. Duke had the stuff there, openly, anybody could take some, servants,  family or guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But unlikely, except for the  chambermaid or cleaners, who had occasion to go in that bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t used at all,&rdquo;  Stone concluded. &ldquo;Perhaps that mix-up of punch was enough to make us sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, here&rsquo;s another thing I found  out. As soon as I heard of this thing this morning, before I came over here, I  telephoned to the Bailey&rsquo;s lawyer, who is an uncle of mine. He didn&rsquo;t want to  tell me, but I made him, what the provisions of those two women&rsquo;s wills are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you over the  telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not! But he said if I&rsquo;d  stop there, he&rsquo;d tell me. So I stopped in a minute on my way. I just got the  principal data, but it&rsquo;s enlightening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart chap, Whitney.  Well, out with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin with Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s will.  I mean Mrs. Owen Bailey. It seems she had a lot of money and property, quite a  fortune in her own right. Now, she left a good sum to Miss Burt, her old school  friend. Then, if you please, she left quite a lump to be divided among the  servants! Especially a wad to that lily-maid, Agnes. And then, her firstborn,  our friend Duke, is residuary legatee, and a fine plum falls into his lap! I  don&rsquo;t know the figures, Uncle wouldn&rsquo;t tell me, but there&rsquo;s the situation. Now,  what price Duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Marigold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not a woman! But Fuller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! That mollusc  couldn&rsquo;t kill a gnat, I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, to get back to cases, let&rsquo;s  begin with the murder of the mother. Duke, Miss Burt and any of the servants  can be said to have had a motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is, if they knew the  terms of the will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest assured they did. Mrs.  Bailey was of the babbling sort, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard that, too. Well,  it gives the possibility of a motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And motive, too, for Mrs. Duke to  kill her mother-in-law. You know there&rsquo;s evidence against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence that she dropped a bit  of sandpaper in the bedroom, but any number of people may have entered the room  after that. However, there&rsquo;s her shoe button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good, the shoe button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Mr.  Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this, Whitney. That button  didn&rsquo;t drop off of Mrs. Duke&rsquo;s slipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it matched the one left on  the shoe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it had been on the shoe. But  it didn&rsquo;t drop off. It was cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. I examined that slipper,  and the button had been snipped off, leaving clean-cut ends of the thread that  had held it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why&mdash;who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, yet. But that&rsquo;s the  fact. Now, somebody cut off that button and dropped it in that room, to  incriminate Mrs. Duke. If any one in the house, it must have been Duke or Miss  Burt. And even if the anonymous intruder committed the murder, some one in the  house, afraid of being suspected, might have trumped up that evidence against  Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Miss Burt, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Stone spoke  dispiritedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so uncertain, so contradictory, that I don&rsquo;t know where  to begin. And&mdash;&rdquo; his voice sank to a whisper, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;ll be more  murders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! If so, then it will be  the outsider. If Duke or Miss Burt, for the old lady&rsquo;s money, they are through  now, but&mdash;oh, I say, that doesn&rsquo;t explain the killing of Mrs. Duke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not positively certain that  the two murders are the work of the same hand,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;Just suppose, for  a moment, that Duke killed his mother to get his inheritance. Parricides are  not absolutely unknown in the history of crime. This, then, automatically gave  Marigold Burt her money. Suppose, then, she was in love with Duke, and wanted  Martha out of the way, in hopes of marrying him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tommy rot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you know your psychology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t want to, if it  gives rise to such fiendish suggestions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s death was fiendish. You  can&rsquo;t get away from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss Burt is in love with old  Bailey. That&rsquo;s an open secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in love with man,&mdash;not a  man. And any doctor will explain to you that her case is not unique. But we  won&rsquo;t go into that now. You&rsquo;ve given me something to think about, Whitney. I  had a theory of my own, but it was so impossible of belief, I hated to tell it.  Now, let&rsquo;s go and see how far the coroner has progressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Stone. What do you  think about Mr. Sheridan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a suspect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, in the first murder.  You know, he and Bailey are not very friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know that. Bailey&rsquo;s  attitude toward him seems all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems, yes. But they are at  swords&rsquo; points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are. Sheridan plays the  races, and uses the firm&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard that hinted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the two partners have left  one another a big pile in their wills. Whoever lives longer will get a lot from  the one who goes first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not Sheridan, as the  killer of the first Mrs. Bailey. Thinking of course, that he was jabbing the  dagger into Owen Bailey himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone thought back.</p>
<p>He remembered Lolly&rsquo;s story of the  car in front of the door.</p>
<p>He told this to Whitney, who said,  quickly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that lets him out! A man  isn&rsquo;t coming into a house to commit murder, and leave his car parked out in  front!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, he may not have intended to  murder when he left the car. He may have suddenly found the house dark and the  way into the study open, and knowing Bailey&rsquo;s bedroom was just above, perhaps  he went up there to see him, socially. Then, finding him, as he thought, asleep  in his own bed, knowing of the convenient dagger, assuming nobody else was  awake, and remembering his money troubles, he may have given the fatal stroke  and fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have seen it was Mrs.  Bailey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he had no light but the  moonlight. And that&rsquo;s all he did have. For, had he snapped on an electric light  somebody would have seen or heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe. I believe you&rsquo;d  rather think it was Sheridan than any of the Baileys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes! I can&rsquo;t bear to  think it was Duke, or even Miss Burt. And&mdash;I don&rsquo;t dare let my thoughts rest on  Parke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I feel that way too.  Parke, had no motive, so far as we know. But who can tell about a young man of  to-day? He may be over head and ears in debt, he may have thought his mother  was his father, he may have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind all that, it&rsquo;s  pure speculation. Come along, and let&rsquo;s see how things are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Duke Loses His Temper</b></h2>
<p>The sheriff and the coroner were  still asking questions which led nowhere and drawing deductions that were even  more futile, when Fleming Stone and Tom Whitney returned to the living room.</p>
<p>Lolly and Parke had gone for a walk  round the place. The girl was faint with fatigue and excitement and the sheriff  granted her a brief respite.</p>
<p>Hunter was now attacking the  majestic Fuller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were Mr. and Mrs. Duke Bailey  ever at odds?&rdquo; asked the truculent voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At odds, sir?&rdquo; and the impassive  face of the butler was utterly blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Did they quarrel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarrel! Oh, no, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie. They did. They quarreled  like cats and dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this language necessary, Mr.  Hunter?&rdquo; came the suave tones of Albert Sheridan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything is necessary that will  drag the truth out of these dumb servants. I think they&rsquo;ve been primed to keep  secrets.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Primed, sir?&rdquo; said Fuller, in  that innocently inquiring way he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bribed, then. Paid to keep your  mouth shut. Do you understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Fuller looked pained, and  omitted his &ldquo;sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mistake. Servants at  Cricklemere have never been offered bribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so? Well, then, answer my  question. Have you ever known Mr. and Mrs. Duke Bailey to have high words, what  is known in common parlance as quarrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush your nonsense, Fuller,&rdquo;  Duke broke in. &ldquo;Of course, my wife and I have quarreled, Sheriff, not once, but  many times. Both having high tempers and imperfect self-control, it is not  surprising we should have ructions now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your butler, then, did not tell  the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess yes. He, like as not,  never heard our best efforts. They were usually in the privacy of our own  rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what subjects did you and your  wife quarrel, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any subject that turned up. The  color of my tie, the covering of the drawing room furniture, the idiosyncrasies  of other members of the family,&mdash;dozens of subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was one of these subjects  ever, by any chance, the men who admired your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you ask that, I may say that  it was. It was a fruitful subject of controversy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you quarreled about this  matter last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;no, we didn&rsquo;t quarrel last  night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you were dressing for  dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were overheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By one of the servants spying  about, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by one of the servants. Not  necessarily spying, as your voices were raised to a high pitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That delicious mess, called  Agnes, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was Agnes who overheard  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call her, let her repeat what we  said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunter summoned Agnes, who came  forward just as she would if answering an ordinary call.</p>
<p>She stood at attention, with no  more expression on her face than if she had been a wax doll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard Mr. and Mrs. Duke  Bailey quarreling last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Agnes, with utter  unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;If you have anything  more to do with Hal Barclay, I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did she reply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have to do with  anybody I please.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That right, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Duke said, looking  relieved, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s nothing. We&rsquo;ve often had far higher words than that. But  they meant nothing. I didn&rsquo;t kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen. Did you  hear anything about two or three o&rsquo;clock this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not! If I had I should have  roused the house, and sent for somebody. Anybody but you. Numskull! Can&rsquo;t you  see you&rsquo;re not getting anywhere? Not anywhere at all. Why don&rsquo;t you ask some  questions whose answers will mean something? Oh, well, go on! What do you want  to know next? Why don&rsquo;t you ask me right out if I killed my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not! But if I had do you  suppose I&rsquo;d tell you so? Now, are you going to find out who did kill her? I  want to know. I want to kill him. I did quarrel with my wife when she smiled on  any other man, that was because I loved her. I worshiped her! Kill her? I  should say not! But somebody has got to find out who did. What good is your  fool detective over there? What good is that super-detective my father engaged?  Can they find who killed my wife and my mother? No, they hem and haw and ask  silly questions. Then after a few days they give up the case. Oh, go on with  your farce of inquiry. It doesn&rsquo;t do any harm, I suppose, even though it  doesn&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke had relapsed into a sullen,  sulky mood, which was unpleasant to look upon but less alarming than his  belligerent spasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we will get at the truth,  after all, Mr. Duke Bailey,&rdquo; the sheriff said, with a superior smirk.</p>
<p>But Stone had heard enough. His  straightforward nature was annoyed by this futile driveling of a country  sheriff, and he preferred not to listen.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was formulating a new  theory and he longed to get at some evidence or information that might help. </p>
<p>He rose and went over to Owen  Bailey, to whom he spoke a few words.</p>
<p>Bailey rose, and excused himself  to the sheriff, saying that if wanted he would be in his study.</p>
<p>Whitney looked at Stone  beseechingly and as he passed him, Stone leaned down and whispered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow us in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men entered the study and  Stone closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son will get himself  disliked,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;if he lets himself run on like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Stone, but what can I  do? The children are all willful and obstinate. I&rsquo;ve tried to train them, but  Lord, they pay no attention to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they always like that? When  they were little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, always. From babyhood  they laughed at my rules and disobeyed my orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They obeyed their mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Blandena made them do  so. I don&rsquo;t know how she managed it, but she did. I envied her that power of  hers. But I couldn&rsquo;t manage the little rascals. They listened to my tirades,  laughed and ran away. Now, they&rsquo;re grown up, but it&rsquo;s the same. They never pay  any attention to my advice or reproof. I don&rsquo;t mind, of course, but sometimes  I&rsquo;d like to have the say in my own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you, Mr. Bailey.  Perhaps it will be different now, that these sorrows have come to you all. They  may bring your family more in accord. Now, tell me, have you any idea who  killed Mrs. Duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t, until just now when  Duke was talking. Then a light seemed to break in on it. Could it not have been  some of those beaux of Martha&rsquo;s? She was a great belle, you now. She had many  admirers, even since she has been Duke&rsquo;s wife. Manners and morals are different  now, you know, from what they were in my young days. Maybe Duke lost his head  and was so insulting to some one of these young men that he came here and took  his vengeance on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps she was the one at  fault. She might have lured an admirer on, to the top of his bent, then perhaps  threw him over and laughed at him. That might make him want to kill her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that, too, but it  isn&rsquo;t like Martha. A flirt, yes. A coquette? Of course. But not one to inflame  a suitor&rsquo;s passions until he was ready to kill her. Still it may be,&mdash;it may  be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, Mr. Bailey, supposing  it was one of these young, importunate lovers, what about the aluminum slips?  The two found in the two death chambers were exactly alike, you know. Now that  must mean that the same hand that committed one murder, committed both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so, yet, how could  it be? Who could desire the death of my wife and my daughter-in-law? Or,  granting my wife&rsquo;s death was by mistake, who would want to kill both me and  Martha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your first thought, of John  Kennedy is the true one, it may be that he did both these crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the only logical  supposition. Now, Mr. Stone, I am in no way criticising your methods, but, I am  sure you will pardon me if I say, you don&rsquo;t seem to be getting anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll pardon you, Mr.  Bailey, the more readily that I know you can&rsquo;t see what I am doing. I&rsquo;m sorry,  too, that I can&rsquo;t tell you, just now, but the truth is, a word dropped at  present might spoil all my plans for future success. I trust you will have  patience a short time longer, or, if you prefer it, I will give up the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, no. I don&rsquo;t want  anything of that sort. But I had hoped for more frankness, greater confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detectives do not work frankly,  or confidentially. My plans are of necessity secret. But I assure you, I am not  idle. Nor am I without results, even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Stone, I accept  your explanation, and I certainly wish you to continue on the case. Now, answer  me this. If my son Duke should get arrested, and should be in danger of trial,  I want to save him. The only way I can think of is for me to confess to the  crime,&mdash;to the two crimes,&mdash;and then disappear. I don&rsquo;t want to be put to death  for deeds I did not commit, but I am willing to sacrifice myself to the extent  of permanently disappearing, for the sake of my son. Do you advise this, in the  event of Duke&rsquo;s arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your proposition takes my breath  away,&rdquo; Stone said, looking at the white-faced man. &ldquo;Will you give me a little  time to think it over? Duke will not be arrested to-day, I am sure. I doubt if  he ever is. At any rate, until there is further sign of it, you need be in no  hurry with your Quixotic scheme. So let us drop the matter for a day or so,  anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree, unless his arrest should  come suddenly. In that case, I must carry out my plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Bailey. Let us  hope there will be no such predicament. Here comes Mr. Whitney. I wish you  would talk freely before him. He is a good detective and is working with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Whitney came into the room,  looking solemn. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve shifted suspicion to Miss Burt,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heavens!&rdquo; cried Bailey. &ldquo;We  can&rsquo;t let Marigold be arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; Whitney said,  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to stem the tide of justice. Let the coroner have his way, he will  anyhow, and try to look at it in a logical manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing now, Dad, that  Mr. Whitney is talking to you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke, who had flung open the door,  strode into the study, where Owen Bailey sat with two detectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bailey was doing nothing  reprehensible,&rdquo; Stone defended him. &ldquo;And Mr. Whitney was not reproving him  either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course you&rsquo;d stand up for  him, since he&rsquo;s paying your salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; agreed  Stone, who knew better than to get into a quarrel with Duke Bailey. He couldn&rsquo;t  admire the young man, yet there was something about him that the detective did  like. But his treatment of his father was not one of them.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone deeply resented the  way Owen Bailey was treated in his own house, and he never lost a chance to  remark upon it, even though he felt sure it would do no good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too ready, Mr. Duke, to  assume your father was in the wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he almost always is,&rdquo; Duke  retorted. &ldquo;How could I tell this was the unique instance in which he was right?  How about it, Dad? &rsquo;Fess up, now. Weren&rsquo;t you up to mischief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that. I wanted to go to  Marigold&rsquo;s assistance, but Mr. Whitney thought better not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not? I&rsquo;ll say so! Why,  you&rsquo;d only get the poor old girl in deeper. You know how your well meaning  efforts turn sour on us. And, besides, it may be that she&rsquo;s the one we&rsquo;re  after. You know, she detested Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Duke. I won&rsquo;t allow you to  slander the poor girl like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Father Bailey, just  &rsquo;cause she&rsquo;s intrigued by your manly charms&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush, Duke,&rdquo; ordered Stone,  annoyed at the bad taste he displayed, yet secretly amused at the thought of a  woman putting Owen Bailey on a pedestal. For while he liked the meek little  man, and was sorry for him when his children failed to show him proper respect,  yet he couldn&rsquo;t see him as a hero of romance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; Duke turned  to Fleming Stone, and spoke seriously, &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s will leaves a lot of kale to  Marigold. Now, George wants money, and she was in the room with Mother that  night, later than Martha was. Besides, we know now that Martha didn&rsquo;t kill  Mother. So, I say, it may well have been George in both cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would Marigold kill your  wife?&rdquo; asked Bailey, Senior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the same reason, Dad, she  would kill yours. I think she&rsquo;s a what do you call it,&mdash;homicidal maniac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Fenn says she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  Stone told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a doctor can be mistaken,  or he may have his own reasons for saying that. Seems to me she has all the  earmarks of that type of dementia. You know how queer she is, always singing  around and all that. And if she weren&rsquo;t queer, she couldn&rsquo;t plump herself down  in our midst and stay here for years with no invitation from anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does look outside of  normal,&rdquo; agreed Tom Whitney. &ldquo;And she didn&rsquo;t like your wife, Mr. Duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly did not. Now, look  here, you two,&mdash;I mean you two detectives,&mdash;I believe you are smart men and know  your business. Now, I want you to get busy and ferret out the truth of these  two murders. I inherit, I am told, quite a sum from my mother. I am willing to  spend it all on the work of detecting the murderer of our people. The Baileys  can&rsquo;t let a crime,&mdash;two crimes, go unavenged. My father, while he did engage Mr.  Stone, is apparently losing interest in the work, which is just what I expected  of him. Now, I propose to take up the matter, and I empower you two to do  whatever may be necessary, at any cost, but, as they say in the police station,  bring in your man. If the criminal is one of those old chaps who has it in for  Dad, all right, get him. Go to the ends of the earth, if you have to, but nab  him. Will you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fail to see the necessity for  your appeal, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;since your father has engaged my  services in this case, I am not at liberty to take up any other offer.  Moreover, as you both want the same thing, &mdash;the arrest and conviction of the  man or men who murdered your two wives,&mdash;it seems to me your somewhat  melodramatic speech is empty air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone well knew this would  enrage Duke Bailey, but he didn&rsquo;t care. He was so angry himself at the way Duke  spoke of his father, and so sorry for the dejected-looking man who watched his  son with saddened eyes and quivering lips, that he would willingly have fought  Duke had he been called upon to do so.</p>
<p>But as often happens when a bully  is called down, Duke collapsed like a punctured balloon, and quickly dropped  the subject of engaging detectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; he said,  hurriedly, &ldquo;if the man we want is one of those scallawags who is out for  revenge on Dad, we want to get him. And if not, then we want to look elsewhere  for our criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; said Stone, who  thought this a lame get out, but was willing to meet the offender half way.  &ldquo;Now, that you&rsquo;re with us, Mr. Duke, may we ask you a few questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as you say you slept so  soundly last night that you heard no sound in your wife&rsquo;s room, will you say if  you can think of any reason for your extra sound sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t extra sound. I always  sleep like that. Nothing wakens me short of a thunder clap or fire alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the punch we had  last night served to make us sleep more soundly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me. I slept peacefully, and  woke this morning feeling fine. If it had been the punch, I&rsquo;d had a bit of a  headache, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo; he  turned to Owen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here. What are you getting  at, Mr. Stone? Did you think the punch very strong? I assure you it was not.  The ingredients were all mild. I&rsquo;ll give you the recipe if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Bailey, it didn&rsquo;t seem strong.  Yet I slept more soundly than I have for years, and this morning, though I had  no headache, my head felt a trifle heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry, indeed. But  truly, I can&rsquo;t think it was the fault of the punch, for Parke had some and  Lolly, and I wouldn&rsquo;t give those children anything really strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. It was  doubtless owing to my worry over these troubles we are undergoing. Now, some  more questions as to the servants. I suppose they are all beyond any thought of  suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Owen said, slowly, &ldquo;I think  we can say yes to that. Fuller is a bit eccentric, but he is honest and  faithful, and I have no slightest doubt of his loyalty to the family. Mrs.  Cooper has been with us more than twenty-five years and is like one of the  family for trustworthiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that queer but beautiful  Agnes?&rdquo; Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about her,&rdquo; Owen  Bailey said, haughtily. &ldquo;I never notice the maids or under-men. The principals  I know and speak to. The underlings are engaged by Mrs. Cooper and mean nothing  to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Duke declared. &ldquo;Dad  never sees the maids. That Agnes is as pretty as a valentine, but he wouldn&rsquo;t  know her from Jane, the waitress, who is of the type of beauty commonly  ascribed to a mud fence. But none of the servants are in this thing, I&rsquo;m sure,  unless it should be Fuller. He is not a suspicious character to my mind, but he  is mysterious. So I hope you two will look him up and see what you can find out  about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the funeral of your wife be  held here, Mr. Duke, or at the church?&rdquo; asked Whitney.</p>
<p>Duke looked uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t quite decided,&rdquo; he  said, after a pause. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer it here at the house. You see, Martha is not  like mother. She had few friends up here, yet I don&rsquo;t want to take her down to  the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her relatives?&rdquo; said Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has no near ones. Her mother  is dead, and her father is traveling abroad. He must be notified, of course.  But I can&rsquo;t do it, I shall ask his lawyers to attend to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is so much to see to,&rdquo; Owen  Bailey said, with a sigh. &ldquo;And Sheridan is no help at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll look after the office,  won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in his slipshod way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him do it, any how, Mr.  Bailey,&rdquo; advised Stone, looking compassionately at the thin, loosely-hung frame  of the man before him. &ldquo;You have all you can manage with these troubles here at  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. If I get one more of  those letters from Kennedy,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure they are from Kennedy,&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll go  mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Duke told  him. &ldquo;People of your type don&rsquo;t go mad. They just sit around and wring their  hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had any clews to work on,&rdquo;  put in Whitney, partly to change the subject and shut up the unfilial son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have clews,&rdquo; Stone said,  slowly. &ldquo;There are the two aluminum strips. I have a notion that those will  lead to the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that possible?&rdquo; asked  Owen, showing interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see they are not very  available nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. Then you deduce the  murderer must have been recently at the beaches or wherever they do have those  machines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; Stone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no finger prints,&rdquo;  lamented Whitney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Stone, &ldquo;we have not.  There wasn&rsquo;t a sign of a finger print on the dagger that killed Mrs. Blandena  Bailey. Nor was there any on the gauntlets of the armor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A criminal like we have to deal  with now is not going to be fool enough to leave finger prints or footprints  either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;The  criminal in our case, for I feel certain there is only one, is the very acme of  cleverness and wickedness both. He is absolutely callous to all human feeling.  He is a brute, mentally and a fiend as well. It requires no powers of deduction  to know these things. A man who could utilize those terrible steel gauntlets as  a weapon, has no heart or soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is John Kennedy,&rdquo; Owen said,  thoughtfully, &ldquo;we must remember he was shell-shocked in the war. May that have  developed later into a mania and may he be half crazed, and not entirely  responsible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is so, he has no business  to be at large,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;I think Mr. Bailey, we must renew our efforts to  locate this man. If we can have a stronger and better guard on this house I  will go down to New York to-morrow and put some agents on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without meaning to be offensive,  Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Duke said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that you are doing any real good by staying  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Fleming Stone was not to be  drawn by this young whipper-snapper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t, Mr. Duke,&rdquo; he  said, with a slight smile. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know what I am doing.  I can&rsquo;t tell you, either at present. But rest assured, young man, I&rsquo;m far from  idle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds well,&rdquo; said Duke with a  burst of loud laughter.</p>
<p>Yet Stone refused to take offense,  and merely looked at him with a half smile and a half frown of reproach.</p>
<p>Duke studied the face of the  detective, then turned to Whitney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are in the know,&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Whitney, smiling,  too, &ldquo;Oh, my, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Stone nodded  approval. &ldquo;Some day, Duke, you&rsquo;ll know all about it.&rdquo; </p>
<br>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  Where Is John Kennedy?</b></h2>
<p>Whitney&rsquo;s assertion that he was  &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; was airy persiflage. He said it on general principle of backing  up Stone, and he was uncertain whether he did right or not.</p>
<p>But Stone reassured him, and then  proved his confidence in the young man by going off to New York and leaving him  in full charge of the case.</p>
<p>Of course, the police were  officially in charge, but this second murder had simply paralyzed them. Both  Hunter and Hale were at the end of their rope and though assistance had been  sent from Hartford, no one seemed able to cope with the appalling circumstances.</p>
<p>The death of Mrs. Owen Bailey was  adjudged to have been in error. All concerned agreed that the fatal blow had  been meant for Owen Bailey himself.</p>
<p>But the death of young Mrs. Bailey  put a different aspect on the case. She could not have been mistaken for her  husband. Who ever killed her knew what he was doing. And the means and manner  of her death were so horrible, so inhuman, that the whole countryside was stirred  to the fighting point.</p>
<p>But there was no one to fight. Had  there been a hint of suspicion against any known person, he would have been  mobbed and lynched by the crowd.</p>
<p>Nor was the excitement confined to  the neighborhood of Canterbury Ledge. The papers were, of course, full of the  story, and reporters beset Cricklemere in droves.</p>
<p>The elder members of the household  refused to see them, but Parke and Lolly were always ready to be interviewed,  and to be photographed. Lolly was compiling an enormous scrap book of pictures,  some of which, especially the landscapes, were really lovely.</p>
<p>The police were doing all they  could, but though their efforts were untiring the results were pitifully  meager.</p>
<p>They searched the house  continually, in relays, until the Baileys, who had been really patient, began  to revolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t so much mind going to my  room, and finding a couple of detectives turning out the drawers of my  chiffonier once more,&rdquo; Duke growled, &ldquo;but I am tired of their messing over  Martha&rsquo;s dainty belongings. They&rsquo;ve worn out her manicure case and as to her  lingerie, it&rsquo;s in tatters from their pawing at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; Lolly agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to confiscate all her best duds. Can I have them, Duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned. But  those detectives will be after you, if so much as a brassiere is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The armor on the stairs was  repeatedly taken to pieces and put together again. Parke was usually called  upon to do the putting together, as he understood Max better than strangers  could.</p>
<p>The searching, Duke declared, was  <i>ad libitum</i> and <i>ad nauseam</i>. Every bedroom, from Owen Bailey&rsquo;s, down to the  humblest scullery maid&rsquo;s was raked over time and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ought to be a closed season  for searching,&rdquo; Parke complained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suspected, yet they can&rsquo;t let my things  alone a whole day at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet everybody in the house was  suspected.</p>
<p>When by themselves, the police  detectives were loud in their insistence that the murderer was one of the  family or servants or guests.</p>
<p>They suspected Owen Bailey Sr. and  Owen Duke Bailey Jr. They hinted at the two younger children. They were loud in  denunciation of Miss Burt, who was adjudged a virago and a termagant. They also  suspected Mr. Sheridan, because a partner was a logical suspect.</p>
<p>For the same reason, Fuller came  in for their doubts. A butler was, in the story books, frequently the villain,  and Fuller was mysterious enough for anybody.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cooper, too, was adjudged a  suspicious character, for the simple reason that she was the least likely one  to suspect.</p>
<p>But all these theories were based  entirely on imagination. Not a shred of individual evidence was forthcoming  against anybody at all.</p>
<p>The dagger was tangible evidence,  so were the great steel gauntlets, but against whom?</p>
<p>The sandpaper, shoe button, cough  lozenge, all were clews, but were by no means positively accusing.</p>
<p>The aluminum strips, were definite  enough as clews, but they pointed nowhere in particular.</p>
<p>And so the desultory investigation  went on. Several days passed.</p>
<p>Martha&rsquo;s funeral, a small, sad  function, was held at the house, the searchers taking a few hours&rsquo; vacation  from their labors.</p>
<p>The preliminary inquiries had been  dragged through, and a definite and final inquest on both murders was set for  Saturday, nearly a week after the Sunday morning when Martha&rsquo;s death was  discovered.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone had gone to New York  on Monday, and was still there, it now being Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The family had relapsed into a  grim silence. When together, which was not often, they tried to keep up a  forced conversation, but it was a ghastly failure.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey honestly endeavored to  entertain his children and guests, but his attempts were met with scorn from  the children and indifference on the part of Marigold Burt and Albert Sheridan.</p>
<p>Duke was usually in a definitely  bad temper. He snapped at any one who spoke to him, and turned away from any  word of sympathy or affection from any one.</p>
<p>Neighbors ventured to call  occasionally, but few repeated the experiment.</p>
<p>Lolly and Parke, however, were not  so gloomy as the rest.</p>
<p>Always avid of new experiences,  they took deep interest in all the proceedings, followed the detectives as they  searched, chatted with the guards at the gates, and even made friends with the  surly sheriff and morose coroner.</p>
<p>And the reporters they considered  their especial property. Indeed, the representatives of the press soon learned  that, although the boy kid was fairly reliable, the girl kid would make up or  exaggerate stories for the purpose of impressing her audience.</p>
<p>No more anonymous letters had  arrived, and Duke opined that there would therefore be no further tragedy.</p>
<p>But his father shook his head,  saying they would never let up until he himself had paid the supreme penalty.</p>
<p>He had explained to his sons the  reason for John Kennedy&rsquo;s enmity, and said further, that he had no doubt that  shell shock or other war disaster, had rendered his brain irresponsible, and  time and brooding had turned him into a homicidal maniac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is he, Dad?&rdquo; asked  Parke. &ldquo;I agree with all you say, and I feel sure it must be Kennedy at the  bottom of all this, but how does he manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t know that, my  boy,&rdquo; Owen answered, wearily, as one who is worn out wondering, &ldquo;but as Mr.  Stone says, these murders are the work of a diabolically clever criminal. They  say a cunning brain and a callous heart can accomplish miracles of crime. If  you boys want me to, I will go away. You hinted at it, Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did. But I didn&rsquo;t really  mean it. I don&rsquo;t suppose, it would help you any. Personally, I don&rsquo;t believe  any more tragedies will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except to me,&rdquo; said his father.  &ldquo;John Kennedy will never rest till he gets me. I am not pessimistic, I merely  face the outlook. Mr. Stone thinks he can save me, but I confess I can&rsquo;t see  any reason for his opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; agreed Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there,&rdquo; Parke put in.  &ldquo;That Stone chap is nobody&rsquo;s fool. Just because he doesn&rsquo;t blat out all he  knows, you needn&rsquo;t think he is ignorant or idle. Give him his chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing so,&rdquo; Owen returned.  &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all wearing on me. Now to-morrow&rsquo;s the inquest. That&rsquo;s an awful  ordeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t feel so sorry for  yourself, Dad,&rdquo; Duke looked at him coldly. &ldquo;There are others who feel these  things just as keenly as you do. More so, perhaps. It&rsquo;s going to ruin my  career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey might have asked his son  just what his career was, but he knew such a question would bring down vials of  sarcastic wrath on his head, and he didn&rsquo;t feel like any further contention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Parke said. &ldquo;How can I  go back to school as the son of the house of the Bailey murders. Why, the case  is nation wide. The reporters say it&rsquo;s on the front page from Maine to  California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be on again when I&rsquo;m  attacked,&rdquo; Owen Bailey said, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not such a national  hero,&rdquo; Duke scoffed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rich, and when that&rsquo;s said, all&rsquo;s said. Mother&rsquo;s  and Martha&rsquo;s deaths were more important than yours can ever be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Duke,&rdquo; exclaimed Parke,  who often enough ballyragged his father himself, but hated to hear the others  do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; Owen said. &ldquo;I  am practically a failure, except in the matter of making money. Well, it will  all go to you boys soon, you two and Lolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Mr. Stone,&rdquo; cried  Duke, glad of a diversion. He was ashamed of his outbreak, but had no intention  of admitting that.</p>
<p>Stone came into the study, where  the three Bailey men sat, and greeted them cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find out anything, Mr. Stone?  Anything of any importance?&rdquo; asked Duke.</p>
<p>His words were decent enough but  his sneering face was so offending that Stone couldn&rsquo;t resist a whack at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Duke, but not for  curiosity seekers. I report only to Mr. Bailey, Senior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey was about to protest  that he was willing his sons should hear any news there was to be told, but a  quick glance from Stone made him pause and he said nothing.</p>
<p>Duke, rather stunned by this overt  act of Stone&rsquo;s left the room in a huff, and Parke, too, faded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not so much to tell, Mr.  Bailey,&rdquo; Stone said, sitting down beside him, &ldquo;but the reporters get so much  from your children, I think we&rsquo;d better be careful. As to the handwriting,  first. I saw the experts, two experts, in fact, to make sure. They agreed that  the writing of these lately received letters have characteristics that show in  both Kennedy&rsquo;s and Dunbar&rsquo;s writing. Of course, it must be remembered that the  letters from the two men, which you provided, were written ten years ago, and  these notes were written lately. But the strange fact remains that definite  peculiarities of both men&rsquo;s penmanship show in these later notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no expert,&rdquo; Owen Bailey said,  &ldquo;but I noticed that to a small extent. For instance, Kennedy always made very  large capital letters, and so does my present correspondent. Again, Dunbar had  a way of separating a word in the middle, and that, too, is the case in these  notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just what I mean. And  a professional graphologist, of course, found more such points. Now, what can  we deduce from that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Stone, I  haven&rsquo;t the analytical mind at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did these two men know one  another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very well. A long time  ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did each know the other was your  enemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I think, Mr. Bailey, that  one of these two men wrote these anonymous notes, and purposely introduced the  effects of the other&rsquo;s handwriting in an attempt to put you on the wrong  track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, that,&mdash;say it was  Kennedy&rsquo;s work,&mdash; that he used letter formations like Dunbar on purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that. Is it not possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite possible. But I don&rsquo;t see  how you thought of that.&rdquo; Bailey looked his admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is obvious, I think. And the  points that are apparently copied are salient peculiarities easily noticed. Of  the lesser and more obscure characteristics none is visible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, to which man do you ascribe  the letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two experts agreed,  independently, on Kennedy. They seemed to have no doubt about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; and Bailey drew a  deep sigh. &ldquo;You remember I told you I&rsquo;d rather fight a brave big-game hunter,  like Dunbar, than a poisonous snake in the grass like Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it is, in a way, a  relief to know which one we have to look for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, yes,&rdquo; Bailey smiled  grimly, &ldquo;but what a way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Stone went on, &ldquo;I turned  my attention to the hunting of Kennedy. Everything goes to show the man is  dead. The war records, hospital records and vital statistics all show that as a  fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, it isn&rsquo;t a fact,&rdquo;  Bailey said, earnestly. &ldquo;You know yourself how the records have been mistaken,  and you know men have been reported dead and turned up alive, years later. I  should indeed rejoice to know that John Kennedy is dead, but I can&rsquo;t believe on  the evidence of records. Then, too, these letters seem to me to argue the man  very much alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone, that proves his  devilish cunning. And it is not normal cunning, but the warped and distorted  cunning of an unbalanced mind. Kennedy, sane, was bad enough, but Kennedy,  shell-shocked, half-demented, crazed by his obsession of revenge, is a  desperate factor to deal with. I don&rsquo;t know where he is, but I know he will  never be found until he has accomplished my death, and probably not then. And,  meanwhile, is he to attack more of my loved ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face was pitiable. Stone  looked with deepest compassion on the grief stricken features, and rising,  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will redouble my exertions, Mr.  Bailey. I will devote my best efforts, my very life itself to this case. And I  shall solve its mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word, he left the  study and went up to his own room, pausing on the way to tell Fuller to send  Mr. Whitney to him as soon as he arrived.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark now, and as  Stone snapped on the electric lights of his bright, cheerful room, he wondered  why the dire shadow of tragedy must enfold a home like this.</p>
<p>By the time he had freshened  himself after his journey, Whitney appeared, smiling and eager, as always.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; he burst out, as Stone  gave him a chair and a cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, but I thought we&rsquo;d chat  up here this time. I&rsquo;m getting afraid of eavesdroppers. What do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney hastily recounted the  proceedings of the police and the detectives, and Stone told him about the  graphology experts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s Kennedy,&rdquo; Whitney mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks so,&rdquo; Stone agreed, &ldquo;but  after all, it makes little difference who it is if we can&rsquo;t catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no hope of catching  him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope, yes. That&rsquo;s what I ain&rsquo;t  got nothin&rsquo; else but! But hope doesn&rsquo;t go far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else you got?&rdquo; the younger  detective smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Energy and perseverance, that&rsquo;s  about all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they going to be enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; almost shouted  Whitney. &ldquo;I was certain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t yell so!  Didn&rsquo;t I bring you up here to keep things quiet? And then you raise the roof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse it, please! But I&rsquo;m so  bucked at what you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said anything yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to. Out with  it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the wrong track,  Whitney. I haven&rsquo;t any revelation to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a suspect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, but I have no evidence,  no clews, no reasons, no right to my suspect. And, too, the mere thought I have  in my mind is so vague, so nebulous that it isn&rsquo;t susceptible of proof, it  isn&rsquo;t even definite enough to put into words. It is just a fiendish, beastly  proposition, that&mdash;oh, it can&rsquo;t be true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which sounds as if you  were coming round to Miss Burt, who is, by the way, the favorite with our  revered coroner. What he won&rsquo;t do to her to-morrow on the witness stand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Friend Hunter favor the  lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix. He&rsquo;s gunning for the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep . . . Says he&rsquo;s the only one  on the premises who knows how to disjoint that tin woodman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, I could do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not really a  suspect, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not, though I&rsquo;d be as  likely a one as Parke. The kid hasn&rsquo;t it in him. He&rsquo;s just a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue with me, I don&rsquo;t  suspect Parke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you suspect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, like you, my suspicion is too  terrible to put into words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gleam in Whitney&rsquo;s bright eyes  told Stone this was merely guying him, and not a sincere statement. &ldquo;Honest,  Whitney, who&rsquo;s your man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Fuller, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. Fuller isn&rsquo;t in on  this deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the money. He wants cash  badly. He wants to retire,&mdash;he has arterio-sclerosis coming on, and he wants to  get a little place in the country and settle down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but why did he do in  Mrs. Duke, also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have known of his guilt.  She saw him, or heard him, and he feared her. He had opportunity to slip up to  her room Sunday morning, when everybody slept late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you may be right, but  you&rsquo;ve no real evidence, any more than any one else has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it rests between him and  Miss Burt. I don&rsquo;t believe in this mythical Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I think those experts  are the bunk. They get a point or two, and then make up a fairy tale to fit  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more truth than poetry in  that, Whitney. Now, clear out, will you, I have to dress for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Fleming Stone  went downstairs, the picture of a well groomed, well mannered gentleman,  without a care in the world.</p>
<p>The absence of the lady of the  house, in no way interfered with the domestic arrangements at Cricklemere. Although  Blandena was gone, Fuller and Mrs. Cooper carried on in the accustomed routine,  and the table was as carefully appointed, the flowers as beautifully arranged  as when the mistress presided.</p>
<p>Everybody dressed for dinner, it  had never occurred to them to change their customs because of the changed  household.</p>
<p>Stone went into the living room,  where cocktails were being served by the Earl of Northumberland and one of his  courtiers. Though the courtier, being shy by nature, was not scoring the same  success as his superior.</p>
<p>Stone took a seat by Marigold  Burt, and asked her regarding her health.</p>
<p>As he had foreseen, she launched  into a detailed description of her nerves and nervousness, and, also as he had  foreseen, he picked up a grain or two of information regarding the Baileys in  general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Sheridan?&rdquo; Stone  asked, looking around. &ldquo;And Parke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Marigold returned,  disinterestedly. &ldquo;Mr. Sheridan was out walking in the grounds, and came in  late. Parke is often late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheridan showed up, and at  Fuller&rsquo;s announcement, they went out to dinner, not waiting for Parke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why that kid must be  always late,&rdquo; Duke grumbled, and Lolly said, pertly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to you?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your business,&rdquo; retorted  her brother. &ldquo;Lolly always resents an inferred aspersion on Parke,&rdquo; said Owen  Bailey with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Father,&rdquo; Lolly cried, in an  exasperated tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you and told you not to say inferred when you mean  implied. You know better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit it, Lolly,&rdquo; said Duke,  scowling at her. &ldquo;If you must play schoolmarm to Dad, don&rsquo;t do it at the table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I like where I  like!&rdquo; the girl declared, not a bit ruffled at Duke&rsquo;s reproof. &ldquo;I say, I wonder  where Parke can be. Is he in his room, Fuller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Miss Lolly. Shall I  go and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to see, Fuller, don&rsquo;t go <i>and</i> see. Yes, go, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler went and returned with  the word that Parke was not in his room nor anywhere in the house, so far as he  could say.</p>
<p>Lolly jumped up from the table and  ran all over the house, calling, &ldquo;Parke, Parke,&rdquo; but received no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; Duke said. &ldquo;Must be over  to the Lawrences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to go  there,&rdquo; Lolly rejoined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to see the guards.</p>
<p>She was gone some time, and  returned looking white and scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They saw him cross the lawn about  six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but they haven&rsquo;t seen him since. They don&rsquo;t know where  he is. He hasn&rsquo;t left the grounds, for the guards are at both gates. Oh, I know  he&rsquo;s out there somewhere, dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran to her father&rsquo;s side, and  he put an arm round her, while she sobbed on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up, Lolly,&rdquo; Duke said,  harshly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a little fool. Parke&rsquo;s all right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll turn up. Eat your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the boy didn&rsquo;t turn up, that  night nor the next day, nor the next.</p>
<p>No trace was found of him, that  night, no word was heard of him, after the guards saw him walk across the lawn  at six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  What In The World Has Become Of Parke?</b></h2>
<p>The meal continued in a depressing  silence.</p>
<p>Fuller brought a chair for Lolly  next her father and she sat close beside him, eating no more of Mrs. Cooper&rsquo;s  delicious viands.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey wanted no more to eat,  either, though the others proceeded with the menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dad,&rdquo; urged Lolly, as  the dessert was finished, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go out and look for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child, we will. Fuller get  us some flashlights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One for me,&rdquo; said Stone, and,  equipped, the three started out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use my going,&rdquo; Duke said, half  apologetically, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t come if we did,&rdquo;  Lolly flung over her shoulder, in scorn.</p>
<p>They went first to the policeman  at the front gate. He had been there since four in the afternoon, and he  declared he had seen no sign of Mr. Parke Bailey, after he saw him stroll  across the lawn about six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>He was sure the boy had not gone  out of the gate he was guarding and he was equally positive he had not returned  across the lawn. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you could not see him, if he  had,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;it would be too dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have cats&rsquo; eyes,&rdquo; the man  said, with a faint smile. &ldquo;I can see good after I get accustomed to the  darkness. I&rsquo;m sure he didn&rsquo;t pass me but the once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, he strolled around by  the lake and back to the house that way,&rdquo; Stone suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belike, sir,&rdquo; returned the  anxious guard. &ldquo;Go you around that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked back around by the  lake, a peaceful sheet of ice now, but black, not silvery, for the moon had not  yet risen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go faster, Father,&rdquo; urged Lolly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m freezing, I didn&rsquo;t know it was so cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly because you&rsquo;re nervous and  alarmed, dear,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;You run back to the house, Mr. Stone and I  will search the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I have to stay, too. But  walk quickly. I can tell if there&rsquo;s any sign of Parke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell?&rdquo; asked Stone,  curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;ll sort  of sense his nearness, &mdash;if we find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They neared the garage as they  hastened along, and saw the door was open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cars are gone,&rdquo; Lolly said.  &ldquo;Both cars! Where are they, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Lolly. Where is  Wyatt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At his supper, most likely,&rdquo; said  the girl, absently. &ldquo;But the cars, where can they be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that Wyatt is at his  supper and the big car gone,&rdquo; said Bailey, in a puzzled tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his night  off, he must have taken the car and gone to the pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he allowed to do that?&rdquo; asked  Stone, a little surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bailey said, &ldquo;but with  things as they are at the house, the chauffeurs do pretty much as they like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have more than one chauffeur,  then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two, but Booth is subordinate.  Wyatt is most reliable and trustworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then might Booth have gone off  with the second car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The second car is Parke&rsquo;s own  car. Duke has one in town, but he doesn&rsquo;t bring it up here. Parke never allows  anybody to drive his car but himself. He is very choice of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; repeated Lolly. &ldquo;If  Parke&rsquo;s car is out, Parke is in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; exclaimed Bailey.  &ldquo;The boy has gone for a spin. He has eluded the guards in some way, and got out  under cover of the darkness. He&rsquo;ll come home soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Lolly demurred.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Wyatt&rsquo;s house and see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chauffeur lived in a small  cottage on the grounds, with his mother.</p>
<p>The mother was at home, but she  said Wyatt had gone to the movies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parke told him he might go,&rdquo;  the woman said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, Mrs. Wyatt, that&rsquo;s  all right, but we&rsquo;re wondering where Mr. Parke is. Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir. Dick came running in here  about six o&rsquo;clock and said he wanted a bite to eat quick, &rsquo;cause he had the  evening off with the car. He took his girl I expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was six o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; asked  Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a bit later, sir. Has Mr.  Parke taken his car, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;at least it isn&rsquo;t in the  garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he took it, sir. Nobody ever  takes Mr. Parke&rsquo;s car but himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;then he&rsquo;s  all right. He&rsquo;ll come back soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as they turned away, each felt  a doubt as to whether this prediction would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>They went on toward the rear gate  of the place. Although not walled all round, Cricklemere had many stretches of  wall and also lengths of hedge. But there were also many wide openings and  unwalled spaces, where a car could get out of the place without going by the  main road.</p>
<p>At the rear gate, the tradesmen&rsquo;s  and servants&rsquo; entrance, they spoke to the man on guard there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Mr. Parke, yes, sir. &rsquo;Long  about six or a bit after. He was crossing the big lawn at a pretty good clip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headed for the garage?&rdquo; asked  Bailey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going that way, yes, sir. I just  saw him scoot by, that&rsquo;s all. It was dark then, and it got darker fast, so I  didn&rsquo;t see him again. I don&rsquo;t know when he went back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t come back to the house  at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo; the man  turned a startled gaze at Parke&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Stone put in,  deeming it wise to let the policeman know the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where can he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His car is gone,&rdquo; Stone said,  &ldquo;could he get out without your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you asked Niles, at the  front gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he hasn&rsquo;t seen him in his  car at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I didn&rsquo;t, neither. But that  lad could do it. He could sneak round by the lake shore, the banks are so high  there we wouldn&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you hear his car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t notice it if I did.  There&rsquo;s dozens of cars comin&rsquo; and goin&rsquo; all the time. &rsquo;Course, most of &rsquo;em we  don&rsquo;t let in, but I mean we wouldn&rsquo;t notice the sound of a car. I&rsquo;d think Niles  would tend to it, and he&rsquo;d think I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go back to the house.  Keep your eye out for Mr. Parke&rsquo;s car and if he drives it in himself, tell him  to hurry to the house, we&rsquo;re anxious about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I will, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three, very cold now, went  back quickly to the house and sat down in front of the blazing log fire in the  living room.</p>
<p>They gave their report, and little  was said. It seemed absurd to fear anything sinister, just because Parke had  taken his car out without letting the guards know it,&mdash;it was just like his  daredevil ways. </p>
<p>After getting warmed, Lolly rose  and left the room, going slowly upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; said Marigold,  &ldquo;she&rsquo;s alarmed. I guess I&rsquo;ll go up and comfort her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let her alone, George!&rdquo;  roared Duke. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go near Lolly to-night. She doesn&rsquo;t want you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Marigold,&rdquo; Owen said, &ldquo;the  child is all upset over Parke&rsquo;s absence. Leave her to herself for a while,  anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in a moment more, Lolly came  running down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; she sobbed, and  going straight to Fleming Stone, she handed him a strip of stamped aluminum,  the duplicate of those they had found after the two tragic deaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;Parke is  dead. They got him somehow, and took him away. If he isn&rsquo;t dead, he&rsquo;s kidnaped,  and that&rsquo;s just as bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; her father tried to  soothe her. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t kidnap Parke! He&rsquo;s too smart for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where did that thing come  from?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;See, just the same exactly. &lsquo;Vengeance is Mine&rsquo; just like  the others. If it isn&rsquo;t an act of vengeance, where did that thing come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks bad,&rdquo; Albert Sheridan  said. &ldquo;You must call the police, Owen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey buried his face in his  hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do it, Albert, or you, Duke.  I can&rsquo;t stand another blow like this. Parke, my boy! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Owen,&rdquo; Miss Burt went and  sat by him, and tried to take his hand.</p>
<p>This was the last straw, and  Bailey jerked his hand away and actually glared at her.</p>
<p>Then recollecting himself, he  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Marigold, but I am  not quite myself. This new trouble has stunned me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s no trouble at all,&rdquo;  she said, brightly. &ldquo;Maybe Parke will come in soon, all hungry for his dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then did you put that lettered  thing in his room?&rdquo; demanded Lolly, stormily. &ldquo;It lay on top of his chiffonier,  just as the others did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt my boy&rsquo;s  disappearance is the work of the same man or men who are responsible for the  other tragedies,&rdquo; Bailey said, solemnly. &ldquo;I am beginning to think it may be a  gang, more than one person, I mean. Perhaps,&rdquo; he looked at Stone, &ldquo;perhaps  Kennedy and Dunbar joined forces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to puzzle it out now,  Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; Stone advised. &ldquo;The police will be here soon. Keep your nerve and  be ready to tell them coherently all you or we know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came.</p>
<p>Constable Leary and the sheriff  this time.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey had obeyed Stone&rsquo;s  kindly advice, and greeted the men with composure.</p>
<p>He told them in as few words as  possible that Parke was unaccountably missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not feel so alarmed,&rdquo; he  went on, &ldquo;except that my daughter discovered on the boy&rsquo;s bureau a metal strip  just like those that accompanied the deaths of my wife and daughter-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of them things!&rdquo;  exclaimed Hunter. &ldquo;By golly, that looks bad! Wasn&rsquo;t that young man supposed to  stay on these premises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it may be that he did,  so far as he was able. I mean it may be that he was carried off or lured away  by the enemies that have already struck at my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not lured away,&rdquo; and Hunter shook  his head. &ldquo;No luring for Master Parke! And again, not likely he was carried  off. He&rsquo;d put up a hell of a fight. But chloroformed, mebbe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; Lolly cried, in  desperation. &ldquo;If you know what happened, tell it, but don&rsquo;t run over a list of  horrors just for the enjoyment of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why, Miss Lolly,&rdquo; the  sheriff was honestly sorry, &ldquo;now you know we got to think this thing out.&rdquo;  Lolly ran out of the room, crying bitterly.</p>
<p>This time Miss Burt followed her,  and as Lolly entered her own room, Marigold slipped in too, flashed on the  lights, and bustled about, talking rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, dearie, you mustn&rsquo;t give way  like this. I don&rsquo;t believe anything dreadful has happened to Parke, he can take  care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone for a ride. He tired of  hanging around in the house, and who can blame him? Shall I telephone over to  the Lawrences&rsquo; and see if he&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, no. Do talk sense, George,  if you have to talk at all. I wish you&rsquo;d clear out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now, now, don&rsquo;t be snippy.  You know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George, who is doing all these  terrible things? Sometimes I have thought you had good sense and judgment. If  you have prove it now. Tell me, honestly what you think about it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s Fuller,&rdquo; said  Marigold Burt, slowly. She stared at Lolly with her gray deep-set eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a  queer Dick, always has been. He wanted his legacy from your mother, and I don&rsquo;t  know about Martha, but he must have had his reasons. Now, of course, he can&rsquo;t  be connected with Parke&rsquo;s disappearance, and that&rsquo;s why I say there&rsquo;s nothing  wrong with Parke. It was absurd to call the police in, when the boy hasn&rsquo;t been  gone two hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s more than that, but  then, there was the &lsquo;Vengeance&rsquo; strip. Who put that in Parke&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuller, may be. If he&rsquo;s the  murderer, he has a lot of those silly strips and he put one in Parke&rsquo;s room to  stir things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense. And, besides,  Fuller was in the dining room all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not all the time. He was in  and out. He could have run up to Parke&rsquo;s room half a dozen times if he had  wanted to, and nobody would have noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. Hark, who&rsquo;s  downstairs? Oh, it&rsquo;s Wyatt! I&rsquo;m going down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly was out of her room and half  way downstairs, before Marigold could pull herself together and follow.</p>
<p>She reached the living room, to  find Lolly questioning the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me, Wyatt,&rdquo; she was saying  imperiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind anybody else. Did Mr.  Parke tell you you could take the big car out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, Miss Lolly. He came to  the garage, and he said, &lsquo;Wyatt, of course we shan&rsquo;t need you this evening,  take the big car and go to the village. Go to the movies and take your girl, if  you like. Here&rsquo;s the price of your tickets. He gave me two dollars, and then he  walked off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a hurry?&rdquo; asked Hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in a hurry, exactly, but  fairly swift, too. I was that glad to get the treat, I hustled home for a bit  of grub, and then I went off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go to your home in the  big car?&rdquo; Lolly asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss, to save the time going  back after it. The show begins at seven, and I had to spruce up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You left Mr. Parke,&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno, exactly. He turned away,  and walked off, and it was pretty dark, and I was getting into the car, so I  didn&rsquo;t really see him again at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His car was in the garage when  you left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, ma&rsquo;am. He must have come  right back and taken it out. Decided to, sudden, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can take his car out by  himself, then, without assistance?&rdquo; Stone inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, yes, sir. Mr. Parke can do  anything with a car, or with a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, we must assume,&rdquo; Stone  proceeded, &ldquo;that Parke crossed the lawn at about six, as the guards report.  That he gave Wyatt permission to use the big car, that he then took his own  car, and disappeared into the night. Now, Wyatt, how could he get out of the  grounds without being seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, sir, but it  could be done. He&rsquo;d have to go down the ledge to the lake shore, and skirt  along, till he could get up on the road again, without being noticed. In the  dark, it would be mighty hard, and if he&rsquo;d had his lights on, or if he&rsquo;d used a  flash, he&rsquo;d been seen, sure. I don&rsquo;t see, myself, how he managed, but Mr. Parke  is a smart one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand all that,&rdquo; Owen  Bailey said, &ldquo;Parke is smart enough to elude the guards, but why doesn&rsquo;t he  come home now? He must know we&rsquo;d be alarmed, and it isn&rsquo;t like the boy to alarm  us. And, besides, what about the metal strip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could young Parke have done that  for a joke?&rdquo; asked the sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Lolly, angrily. &ldquo;Parke  isn&rsquo;t a beast! We are all unruly, ungodly children, but not one of us would do  such a low-down trick as that! I&rsquo;d be sure Parke had just gone for a joy ride,  except for that awful thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any finger prints on it?&rdquo; said  Leary, who resented being left out of the discussion, as he usually was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Hunter told him, with a  pitying look. &ldquo;Criminals don&rsquo;t leave finger prints anymore, and anyway, this  super criminal wouldn&rsquo;t. Not one of these three alumininum&mdash;aluminum messages  has shown any finger prints.&rdquo; Hunter always had trouble with the unfamiliar  word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sheriff,&rdquo; Fleming Stone  said, &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s no call to set a posse hunting for Parke Bailey, for  unless we find his empty car, we must conclude he&rsquo;s still in it, wherever he  is. And the guards at the gates and the two chauffeurs can easily search the  grounds for the car. If they don&rsquo;t find it, we&rsquo;ll have to conclude it is not on  the premises, and we must await further developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sense, sir,&rdquo; Hunter  agreed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll get some state troopers on the job. The moon comes up late,  and when it gives light enough, they can squint around a bit. You people here,  go to bed and get some rest. You can&rsquo;t do anything more to-night and to-morrow  there&rsquo;ll be the inquest, you know. Lord I never saw or heard of a case like  this! And now that boy gone! But he&rsquo;ll turn up. They don&rsquo;t kidnap lively young  men like him. Buck up, Mr. Bailey, you&rsquo;ll see your wild son back soon, I&rsquo;ll  warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t wild,&rdquo; murmured Owen,  resenting any aspersion on the absent boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. Well,  I&rsquo;ll be getting along. Come on, Leary there&rsquo;s lots to see to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shuffled awkwardly out, not  being versed in the polite exit from room, and Duke drew a long breath of  relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if we have to  have those creatures here once more, I shall move out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be for you, next time,&rdquo;  said Lolly, solemnly, fixing her glittering topaz eyes on her brother. &ldquo;If the  whole family is to be wiped out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush up, you little nuisance! Go  to bed, can&rsquo;t you? I believe you&rsquo;re at the bottom of all this trouble!&rdquo; Lolly  stared at him until he began to wriggle nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I believe you are,&rdquo; she said,  in a voice of concentrated hate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought all along, Duke, that you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, idiot! You make me  tired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke scowled at her, then rose,  with a little half laugh, and rang the bell for Fuller.</p>
<p>When that majestic functionary  came, Duke ordered whisky and soda, and later, the trays were brought in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, Fuller,&rdquo; Fleming  Stone said, as the butler was about to depart, &ldquo;you are in charge of the house,  did you see any one,&mdash;any stranger come in while we were at dinner, or shortly  before or after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, no stranger can get to  the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But somebody did, or who left  that metal strip in Mr. Parke&rsquo;s room? You don&rsquo;t suspect any of the servants of  disloyalty, do you, Fuller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet they are the only ones who  could have gone upstairs secretly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t, sir. I should have  heard them or seen them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no back stairway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, there is, but Mrs.  Cooper would have an eye on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then no servant could go upstairs  unnoticed, except Mrs. Cooper or yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a flicker of an eyelash to  show resentment at the implication, Fuller replied: &ldquo;That is correct, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried the butler,  startled for once out of his calm. &ldquo;No she never did such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no other solution.  Nobody could go up but you two; you didn&rsquo;t, therefore, she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she couldn&rsquo;t have. And,  anyway, the other servants will witness as to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit stalling, Fuller,&rdquo; Stone  said, crisply. &ldquo;You know you went up just after we sat down to dinner, to see  if Mr. Parke was in his room. Miss Lolly sent you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler&rsquo;s jaw dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you meant that  time, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean any time. If you had  wanted to, you could have left an aluminum strip on Mr. Parke&rsquo;s chiffonier  then. And, according to your own story, nobody else had any possible  opportunity to do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying you did, Fuller,  but I do say that to clear yourself you&rsquo;ll have to admit that somebody else  could have gone upstairs, unnoticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so, sir.&rdquo; Fuller&rsquo;s  confusion was increasing. &ldquo;There must have been a moment, when I couldn&rsquo;t  command a view of the staircase&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else, when Mrs. Cooper  couldn&rsquo;t command the back stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Anyway, it wasn&rsquo;t me&mdash;I,  sir.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, Fuller, I  don&rsquo;t think it was. But I do think you know who went upstairs, and you are  determined not to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red flush that rose on the  man&rsquo;s face, answered this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come clean, now,&rdquo; Stone advised.  &ldquo;And, unless you do, you will be suspected of knowing more than you should  about those metal strips. And that will lead&mdash; well, Fuller, you must know to  what dreadful suspicions that would lead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and Fuller  looked honestly troubled, &ldquo;must I incriminate a fellow servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuller, justice must be done. It  is awful to tell on another, but you are not doing it solely to save your own  skin. It is a time when truth must be told. Now, it is better for you to tell  us, here, than to have it dragged out of you to-morrow at the inquest, as it  most certainly will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me help you, Fuller.&rdquo; Stone&rsquo;s  voice was kindly. &ldquo;You hesitate to bring in the name of one so young and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression on the butler&rsquo;s  face proved to the detective that he had surmised rightly. He went on. &ldquo;You saw  Agnes go up the front stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the word was merely  breathed.</p>
<p>Stone, not surprised, realized  that Fuller was in love with the beautiful parlor maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she go up for?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her usual trick,&rdquo; Fuller  answered, with a distressed expression. &ldquo;She goes up whenever  she gets the chance, to loll in Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s boudoir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Stone nodded his head,  remembering the time he had found her doing just that. &ldquo;Bad manners, but not a  crime. You may go, Fuller.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Parke Is Found!</b></h2>
<p>Nobody really suspected Agnes of  wrong doing, further than the surreptitious visit to the boudoir. The girl was  too lacking in sense they all thought, to have been responsible in any way for  the two murders or the disappearance of Parke. Though of such exquisite beauty,  the Baileys showed no personal interest in the otherwise unattractive  personality. Stone had probed now and then, but had never received the faintest  hint that any of the Bailey men were lured by that lovely face.</p>
<p>The fact that Fuller was under the  spell, merely corroborated a notion Stone already held. Indeed, he thought, it  would be strange if Fuller could see that angelic beauty day after day, and not  succumb.</p>
<p>And to look upon Agnes as a  possible tool or accomplice, was also out of the question. It ought to be  looked into a bit, but Stone felt little curiosity in a quest he felt sure  would be futile.</p>
<p>Albert Sheridan was the only one  who leaned to the opinion that the dumbbell as she was often called, might be  implicated.</p>
<p>But Sheridan knew little of the  life of the Baileys. He was at Cricklemere more just at present than he had  ever been before in his life. He was running the office almost entirely, for  Owen Bailey went down to the city but seldom.</p>
<p>He was allowed to go and come as  he chose, for the police knew that his business required his presence, but he  had lost interest in his business affairs and declared that unless Sheridan  could see to things they could go unseen to.</p>
<p>Duke, a little alarmed lest harm  come to the Bailey fortunes remonstrated but his father, though listening  courteously, paid no heed to his son&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey was a broken man.  Never robust or athletic, he seemed to have shriveled and shrunken during these  days of horror.</p>
<p>One of the more sensational  reporters had dubbed Cricklemere Horror House, and the name had clung.</p>
<p>Lolly had asked Doctor Fenn to  prescribe for her father, but beyond some simple advice as to diet and rest,  Fenn could do nothing.</p>
<p>And now the disappearance of Parke  was wearing on him, and Owen Bailey sometimes looked as if his life hung by a  thread that might not wait to be severed by an assassin&rsquo;s knife.</p>
<p>Sheridan chided his partner for  taking so serious a view of the boy&rsquo;s absence. He told Bailey that for a young  man to go away in his car, and remain over night was not to be called a  &ldquo;disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Saturday morning now, and  the breakfast table, surrounded only by the three Baileys and their three  guests, seemed lonesome and deserted.</p>
<p>Lolly presided at the head of the  table, knowing that if she didn&rsquo;t Marigold would, and she didn&rsquo;t propose to  have that. She would have preferred to sit by her father, but she was  determined to hold the reins of household government.</p>
<p>She made Fuller and Cooper come to  her for orders, knowing that if George got a foothold, she would soon run the  place.</p>
<p>This morning they were all  specially gloomy in anticipation of the coming inquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired of sheriffs and  police and inquests,&rdquo; Lolly wailed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky not to be a  suspect,&rdquo; Duke told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gathered that they&rsquo;re going to suspect me next.  Innocent me! Do they think I&rsquo;d kill my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t always darling her  when she was alive,&rdquo; Marigold said, spitefully. &ldquo;The fights you two used to put  up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They meant nothing,&rdquo; Duke  growled, but he said no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me Parke&rsquo;s running away  tantamount to a confession,&rdquo; Sheridan observed, in acid tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Albert, you don&rsquo;t  mean that,&rdquo; said Owen in his mild way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do mean it, and his leaving the  message behind him, proves it, to my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer sort of mind you&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo;  Duke flashed at him. &ldquo;Parke is no more mixed up in this thing than I am, and  that is not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Lolly said, rising. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  nearly time for the Spanish Inquisition to begin. I mean to give those police a  song and dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Lolly dear,&rdquo; her father  began, but she interrupted him;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;Lolly dear&rsquo; me! I shall do  as I please, and you know it, Dad, or ought to know it by this time! Did you  ever have any control over me, even in piping times of peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Owen said, with a show of  spirit. &ldquo;No, I never did, but there was no such reason for it then as there is  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lay off, anyway. It won&rsquo;t  get you anywhere. Come on, everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly was right, it was time for  them to attend the inquest.</p>
<p>The great living room was filled  with people, neighbors, reporters, officials and house servants, all seemed to  Owen Bailey&rsquo;s troubled gaze to be mixed in together.</p>
<p>They took the seats reserved for  them and the queries began.</p>
<p>Coroner Hale was in his element.  Vain and pompous, as many coroners are, he gloried in the fact that at last he  was in the limelight, was at the head of the inquest on a great murder case,  the greatest case New England had ever known.</p>
<p>His questions were of the cut and  dried type. Witnesses were asked as to their vital statistics, their position  or business and their knowledge of the Bailey tragedies. As this brought out  little of interest and no new information Fleming Stone became very much bored  and gave himself up to his own thoughts.</p>
<p>He wished very much he knew where  Parke was. He had formed a tentative theory, founded on what seemed to him pure  reason. But the strange disappearance of Parke had knocked it out of kilter.  That is, if Parke had strangely disappeared. If the boy returned, unharmed,  Stone felt he could revive his theory, but if Parke had been&mdash;but what could he  have been? Kidnaping seemed absurd on the face of it. Accident was supposable,  but what sort of accident? If his car had broken down or smashed up, there  would be report of it however far away.</p>
<p>The theory that Parke had run  away, had plenty to support it. In such case he would have put the misleading  metal strip in his room. And if he were the murderer, he would have plenty of  those strips.</p>
<p>The strips themselves puzzled  Stone deeply. He had examined them over and over again, and come to no  conclusion save that they were not new.</p>
<p>He had had his agents punch out  similar strips from several machines at the beaches, and invariably the metal was  brighter than these in question.</p>
<p>That was in Parke&rsquo;s favor. The boy  surely had not prepared these things some time ago, for future use.</p>
<p>Yet somebody had apparently done  so, and that brought his mind back to the man Kennedy.</p>
<p>Clever chap, then. But the murderer  was indubitably clever, more than clever. A genius, almost a magician.</p>
<p>And wicked! How could a human  being be so lost to all humanity, all decency, as to take lives in that vile  and brutal way?</p>
<p>Yet it had been done. Why marvel  at the depraved creature that did it? Why not set to work and find him?</p>
<p>The motive must be colossal.  Nobody is going to perform such acts of black deviltry save for a compelling  reason. No commonplace hatred or ordinary revenge could account for those  beastly degrading murders. The murderer must indeed be a monster, a very  animal, without a soul.</p>
<p>Stone was roused from his reverie  by the sound of an odd voice.</p>
<p>It was the beautiful Agnes,  answering the coroner&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>Her voice was monotonous, rather  flat and yet with a certain musical quality. Like a xylophone struck only on a  few low keys.</p>
<p>She was, apparently, not  embarrassed, but entirely disinterested. It all seemed to mean nothing to her,  and probably that was just what it did mean to her.</p>
<p>She gazed at Hale with her wonderful  violet eyes, but it was an unseeing stare. She answered his queries, clearly  and straightforwardly, but with a detached air that made her seem aloof from  the scene.</p>
<p>The questions and answers got them  exactly nowhere.</p>
<p>Stone kept on watching her, when a  light flashed in his brain.</p>
<p>It was as if an unseen hand had  pressed a switch, and a flood of light followed.</p>
<p>With some difficulty he controlled  his facial expression, his quivering muscles, his throbbing pulses. </p>
<p>Had he solved the mystery? No,  there were too many contradictions, too great difficulties. He must watch and  wait, warily, craftily,&mdash;but, oh, if he should be right!</p>
<p>He looked round the crowd.  Everybody was there. The Baileys, their guests, their servants, their  neighbors, could it be that one of these sat there now with a black, guilty  heart, acting the role of innocence?</p>
<p>Marigold Burt was called next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live here?&rdquo; the coroner  asked, knowing full well the circumstances of her presence there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Miss Burt fairly  simpered in her anxiety to please.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whose invitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, Mrs. Bailey invited  me. We were at school together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She asked you to live here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe not quite that,&mdash;but  to make an indefinite visit,&mdash;yes, an indefinite visit.&rdquo; She repeated the phrase  as if pleased with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is clever,&rdquo; thought Stone,  obsessed with his new theory, &ldquo;but is she super humanly clever? Which is what  my suspect must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you propose to stay on here?&rdquo;  the coroner prodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I hope so,&rdquo; Marigold cast an  appealing glance at Owen Bailey, who either did not see it, or feigned not to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bailey had grown a bit tired  of your presence here, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understood wrong,&rdquo; said  Marigold, brightly. &ldquo;Mrs. Bailey, Senior, and I were the dearest friends. We  were congenial in every way. She just loved to have me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know better than that. Mrs.  Bailey did not want you here but she knew no way to get rid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how you talk!&rdquo; and Marigold  smiled roguishly. &ldquo;Somebody has been telling you tarradiddles, my dear sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner probed deeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact so anxious was the lady  of the house to have you go, and so determined were you to stay, that&mdash;was there  no other way but to kill her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale shot the question at her,  with the amiable intention of flustering, but George didn&rsquo;t fluster easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a bad man!&rdquo; she cried.  &ldquo;Poor little me! Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t kill a fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly looked disgusted. She knew  Marigold in this mood, and knew it was utterly impossible to get a sensible  answer when she chose to affect the simpering innocent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what were you doing on the  stairs, hiding behind the armor, the night Mrs. Blandena Bailey was stabbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear man, we&rsquo;ve been over  all that before. What did I tell you the other time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter, tell me the truth this  time. Remember you are on oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh! Must I tell the truth,  really? Well, then, I was on the stairs waiting for Mr. Owen Bailey to come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he must have gone up the  other stairs, from his study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you waiting for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash; you do ask such embarrassing  questions. Well, then,&mdash;sometimes, I like to see him alone to&mdash;to say  good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Bailey, well mannered man  though he was, gave utterance to a sound that is colloquially known as a snort.</p>
<p>The coroner, feeling that this  witness was a washout, asked her a few more unimportant questions.</p>
<p>But that smothered sound from Owen  Bailey had apparently aroused the lady&rsquo;s ire. She became vituperative,  denounced the whole Bailey family, charged them with the murders, jointly and  severally, and was so altogether abusive that the coroner dismissed her and  advised her to leave the room.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t do this, but sat  muttering and murmuring anathema all round.</p>
<p>Stone, unable to stand more of the  inutile procedure rose quietly and went out of the room.</p>
<p>Whitney soon joined him, but the  older detective said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d stick it, boy. We  must know what goes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the minutes will tell  us. That snail coroner will be days and days on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Stone returned,  moodily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much to do till Parke gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parke will never come back,&rdquo; said  Whitney, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; returned Stone with  equal gravity.</p>
<p>They left the house and walked  about in the cold, crisp winter air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly Christmas,&rdquo; Whitney said.  &ldquo;The Baileys were going to have an enormous Christmas party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;Poor  little Lolly is going through deep waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s all broken up over  Parke&rsquo;s loss. They were like twins, with a sympathy that was almost  telepathic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why doesn&rsquo;t she know where  the boy is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says he is dead. She knows  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay he is. Otherwise he&rsquo;d  be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he&rsquo;s kidnaped. I think  he&rsquo;s held for ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be. No use imagining. Are  you game for a walk down to the lake? It&rsquo;s awfully cold down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ahead. I&rsquo;ll brave it for a  time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went down the gentle incline  to the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they were cutting ice,&rdquo;  Whitney said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they finished  yesterday,&rdquo; Stone told him. &ldquo;I heard Duke say the icehouse was filled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful lake,&rdquo; and Whitney  gazed across the frozen expanse. &ldquo;Wonderful skating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or ice-boating. But I&rsquo;m  getting too old for such cold comforts. Let&rsquo;s go back. I&rsquo;m restless, Whitney. I  can&rsquo;t help feeling that the secret of this mystery is within my grasp but I  can&rsquo;t get the key to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right attitude. All  great detectives have that feeling. I never read a story yet, where the sleuth  didn&rsquo;t have that obsession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go &rsquo;way with you! I&rsquo;m in earnest.  I can&rsquo;t do anything here, I think I&rsquo;ll go down to New York to-night, and see  what I can do about Parke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broadcast it, for one thing. We  ought to send a description of Parke and the car all over the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that from up here. I  think, Mr. Stone, you ought to stay here. I&rsquo;d rather you would, anyway.&rdquo; So  Stone stayed, and he put in a dreary four days while the inquest dragged its  slow length along.</p>
<p>No word came from or of Parke.</p>
<p>The Baileys agreeing, Stone had  the matter broadcast practically all over the country. But there were no results.</p>
<p>He talked with the two chauffeurs,  and learned from them that the matter was a most curious mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Wyatt, &ldquo;if Mr. Parke  had gone off of this place in his car, he&rsquo;d have left a trace behind him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Stone objected, &ldquo;the  ground is altogether too hard for tire tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not altogether, sir. There&rsquo;s lots  of bits of ice and crusted snow, that would show a print in spots if a car  passed over &rsquo;em. And, sayin&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t go out by the road, which, of course, he  didn&rsquo;t, where did he go out? I&rsquo;ve been over every square foot of ground, not  only once but several times, and Booth has, too, and we can&rsquo;t see how he got  out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mystery,&rdquo; Stone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery? It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the car did go out! It isn&rsquo;t  here, is it? Well, it didn&rsquo;t rise up in the air and fly out! So it had to go  out on the ground. If it left no trace, that&rsquo;s as I said, because of the hard  ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, for bein&rsquo; so  obstinate, but I&rsquo;m a chauffeur, sir, and I know a lot about tire tracks. Why I  can show you the tracks of every delivery car that comes here, on the road, or  cross lots, as some of &rsquo;em do come. And I know the tracks of your car, and Mr.  Sheridan&rsquo;s car, and all the neighbors&rsquo; cars. And I can show you where lots of  these cars have made spotty busted marks on the crusted snow, and on the ice,  too. But is there a smitch of a trace of Mr. Parke&rsquo;s car? There is not! That&rsquo;s  why I say it&rsquo;s impossible, yet, there it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone was impressed by Wyatt&rsquo;s  positive assertions, for he knew of his integrity and reliability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these great, deep ruts?&rdquo;  Stone asked, as he noticed them, leading away from the garage and down toward  the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ice wagons, sir,&rdquo; Wyatt told  him. &ldquo;We cut enough ice for the icehouse here, and if there&rsquo;s some left over,  the ice men come and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not cutting now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, done for the season.  Well, Mr. Stone, you think over this car matter. I&rsquo;m not making up fairy tales,  sir. It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s truth, that lad couldn&rsquo;t get off this place, one way or  another, without leaving a tire mark somewhere. And there&rsquo;s been no snow to  cover &rsquo;em up. And there&rsquo;s been no sun to melt &rsquo;em. A little pale sunshine, but  this cold snap discounts that and every track put here for the last week, is  here now. Take it from me, Mr. Parke didn&rsquo;t go out of these grounds, &rsquo;cause  why? &rsquo;Cause he couldn&rsquo;t, lessen he left his mark. And did he leave his mark? He  did not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone told the chauffeur he would  give most careful thought to all he had said, and bade him hunt still more  assiduously for some prints, made by Parke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What type was his car?&rdquo; he  inquired, as he left the garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A closed sedan, sir. Nice and  warm he would be, no danger of freezing to death. And the car was in spick and  span order, I always see to it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Wyatt, I&rsquo;ll think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine thing to think over!&rdquo; he  told himself, bitterly. &ldquo;What can I think but that a roc flew down and grabbed  up car and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the very next morning he  revised his own suggestion of a roc.</p>
<p>He was sitting at the breakfast  table, though he had finished his meal.</p>
<p>The others were there, all  brooding and distrait. They had given up all semblance of polite conversation  and often allowed long silences, which were wearing to the nerves, but perhaps  better than the acrimonious talk they sometimes had instead.</p>
<p>Fuller brought a card to Stone,  who looked at it with some amusement.</p>
<p>It was a cheap white card, with a  name written on it in florid, ornate penmanship.</p>
<p>The name was Mr. James Paddock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Jimmy Paddock,  announced, as Stone entered the library, where the boy had been told to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; agreed Stone, rather  welcoming the sight of some one he could smile at. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, I&rsquo;m going to do something  for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Stone, I think I know  where Parke Bailey is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Stone rose and closed the  door. &ldquo;Speak softly, Jimmy, until I know more about this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir. Well, I&rsquo;ve had a notion  ever since he got lost that maybe&mdash;oh I s&rsquo;pose there&rsquo;s no sense to it. It&rsquo;s  going to sound silly when I tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather go outside? In the open  air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir. Lot&rsquo;s rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone fetched his hat and coat,  and the two went out the French window of the library, through the covered  terrace, and Jimmy led their steps down toward the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really, Jimmy!&rdquo; said Stone,  looking curiously at the frozen surface ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme tell you, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t get it outa my  mind that the ice cutters was here that day for the last time. And they always  go off, leaving a big open hole, of course. Well, sir, if Parke had,&mdash;if he had,  in any way, gone down that hole car and all, it would have friz over again that  night, &mdash;it was way below Zero you know,&mdash;and nobody would ever know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but why&mdash;how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now. you wait a minute. Ever since  that night, last Friday night it was, and now it&rsquo;s Thursday morning, I been a  watching this ice cuttin&rsquo; place every chanct I could get. And I was lucky that  way, &rsquo;cause Doc Hale, he&rsquo;s so het up with that inquest performance he don&rsquo;t  give me no work to do, while he&rsquo;s performin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the edge of the  lake now, and Jimmy pointed to the faint discernible square which he said was  the newly frozen over hole which the ice cut had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; Stone said, not  knowing whether to laugh at the boy or listen to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Jimmy went on,  earnestly, &ldquo;I knew that if Parke&rsquo;s car was down there, it&rsquo;d show up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show up? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this. If a car is down there  under the ice, it&rsquo;s going to let some engine oil bubble up and sooner or later  it&rsquo;ll show. Well, sir, I waited, and&mdash;here&rsquo;s her oil bubbles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone followed the pointing finger  and saw clearly the dark stains on the ice patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he asked, his  voice tense with excitement, &ldquo;I mean sure of what this means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure. Now, it&rsquo;s up to you to  prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get Wyatt and Booth,&rdquo;  Stone directed, &ldquo;and one of the police who are standing about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was soon done, and when a  hole was cut out in the ice and the spot explored with long poles and weighted  ropes, they found something there which they concluded might be a car.</p>
<p>Stone concluded not to interrupt  the inquest. He went back to the house and saw Duke and his father alone.</p>
<p>The Bailey men were frankly  incredulous, but agreed that the matter must be investigated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a car down there,&rdquo; Owen  said. &ldquo;That oil is from the ice cutters&rsquo; machinery, but all the same we must  see about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went back to the lake, and  Mr. Bailey directed that a derrick be obtained with all haste possible.</p>
<p>The delay in getting the derrick  was nerve racking, and Stone wondered if the ramifications of this terrible  case would ever end.</p>
<p>At any rate, if it should be  Parke&rsquo;s car down there, Wyatt&rsquo;s opinion would be vindicated, for no tire tracks  could be seen in among the great ruts made by the ice trucks.</p>
<p>At last the derrick arrived, and  was put to use.</p>
<p>Slowly it worked but at last a car  was brought to the surface.</p>
<p>It was Parke&rsquo;s car, and in it sat  the boy, frozen stiff, having been at the bottom of the lake, which was  thirty-five feet deep at that spot, for nearly a week.</p>
<p>A doctor was summoned from the  house, but his ministrations were addressed to Owen Bailey and not to the dead  boy.</p>
<p>Examination proved that the  emergency brake of the car was jammed on tight. It was evident Park had driven  out on the lake after the ice cutters had stopped work for the day. Then,  seeing open water, or thin ice ahead of him, he jammed on his brakes and  stopped the wheels, but not the car, which slid forward like a sled and carried  him to the bottom of the lake through the hole the ice cutters had made leaving  no trace of what had happened, as the hole rapidly froze over again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Lolly and the Veronal</b></h2>
<p>Unable to control his impatience  and excitement, Jimmy Paddock ran back to the house to tell the astonishing  news to Coroner Hale.</p>
<p>Unheeding murmured reproofs and  reproaches, the boy reached Hale&rsquo;s side and whispered to him.</p>
<p>The coroner&rsquo;s amazement whetted  the curiosity of the audience, and after a moment&rsquo;s thought, Hale announced the  finding of Parke&rsquo;s car and its gruesome occupant.</p>
<p>Panic ensued.</p>
<p>The coroner could scarcely make  his voice heard to adjourn the inquest.</p>
<p>In a moment there was no inquest  to adjourn. The entire audience rushed out of doors to see for themselves if  this shocking thing could be true.</p>
<p>Coroner Hale himself, knowing his  duty, called to the sheriff to follow, and the two men were soon at the lake&rsquo;s  edge.</p>
<p>There was wild confusion, shouting  and crowding, until more policemen appeared and reduced the mob to order.</p>
<p>The car, once landed on the thick  ice, was easily pushed to the shore, and at last, by order of the coroner, the  pathetic body of Parke Bailey was lifted out and carried to the house, where it  was laid upon a couch in the library.</p>
<p>Lolly, sobbing hysterically, clung  to the frozen corpse, and refused to leave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the girl away,&rdquo; the sheriff  blustered, and as the family&rsquo;s efforts were unavailing, Fleming Stone went to  her and whispered, &ldquo;Come with me, Lolly. I will help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose to her feet, looked at  him wonderingly, and let him lead her away.</p>
<p>He took her straight to her own  room, led her inside, and closed the door behind them both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d help me!&rdquo; she  cried, stormily. &ldquo;Did you mean it, and how are you going to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The high pitch of her voice and  the staccato utterance proved she was still in the grip of hysteria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help you, my child, until  you are more calm. I know it sounds absurd to you, but I&rsquo;m going to ask you to  lie down on your bed and rest a while and quiet your nerves. Then you and I  will have a serious talk, which we cannot do now, while you are all on edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had expected an angry refusal,  but to his great surprise, Lolly said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Mr. Stone. I can&rsquo;t  do anything until I quiet down. I will take a dose of veronal and that will  make me sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drugs! No, no, child, you mustn&rsquo;t  do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! I often do. Just a mild  form,&mdash;why, veronal won&rsquo;t hurt anybody. I have it right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it? You  oughtn&rsquo;t to have such stuff around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! It won&rsquo;t hurt me. I&rsquo;ll just  take one teeny-weeny tablet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; He spoke  sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you, if you&rsquo;re  cross.&rdquo; Lolly smiled at him, then went quickly into her bathroom, slammed the  door shut and locked it.</p>
<p>In a moment she returned, saying  triumphantly, &ldquo;Well, I won out, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a headstrong little piece  you are!&rdquo; Stone exclaimed, sensing the fact that he couldn&rsquo;t do anything in the  matter of the opiate, and he certainly wanted to keep the girl&rsquo;s friendship and  confidence. &ldquo;Tell me, where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You harp on that string like a  parrot! But it&rsquo;s no secret. I found it among Mother&rsquo;s things. She had lots of  drugs. Oh, nothing really wicked, but sulphonal and veronal and such things to  make her sleep. They&rsquo;re harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a kid like you,&rdquo; Stone  shook his head. &ldquo;Well, lie down then and have a nap. But don&rsquo;t take any more of  that stuff, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. Cross my heart,&rdquo; and  he felt sure she meant it.</p>
<p>He left the room, and went slowly  downstairs, uncertain whether he ought to send some one to look after her or  not.</p>
<p>But Marigold Burt was so  impossible as a nurse, and he didn&rsquo;t know the servants well enough to choose  one.</p>
<p>Surely that dumbbell beauty, would  be worse than useless!</p>
<p>Moreover, he was anxious to learn  anything he could regarding Parke&rsquo;s tragic death, and he joined the police  crowd, who, with Owen Bailey and Duke, were in the study.</p>
<p>Bailey, who had been looking ill  before, was pitiable now. A physical wreck he seemed, his white, haggard face  drawn and strained.</p>
<p>He looked up at Stone&rsquo;s entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he whispered, in a  voice barely audible, &ldquo;was it an accident, or,&mdash;was it&mdash;Kennedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Stone said,  gently. &ldquo;On the face of it, it looks like an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accident nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; the sheriff  grunted. &ldquo;Parke Bailey ain&rsquo;t the one to have a motor accident in any case.  Least of all, would he head out on the lake and steer straight for the hole the  ice cutters left, and which was only skimmed over with new ice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Hale agreed. &ldquo;Not Parke  Bailey! He was an expert driver, and a live wire generally. It was no  accident,&mdash;but it coulda been sooicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Musta been,&rdquo; corroborated Hunter.  &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t of been murder, this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it could,&rdquo; put in Jimmy  Paddock, who, by reason of having discovered the truth, was in high favor, &ldquo;if  Parke had been in his car, near the edge of the lake, say, somebody could have  given him a push and sent him scooting over the ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nobody did, sonny,&rdquo; Hunter  told him, &ldquo; &rsquo;cause there was nobody round to do that little thing. If any  intruder or marooder had busted in here, he woulda been seen by the guards at  the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, guards at the gates!&rdquo; Jimmy  snorted. &ldquo;They just look at the driveway. Anybody could sneak in between the  bushes or through the hedge! My, land! Guards, is it? This place ain&rsquo;t guarded  no more&rsquo;n the public highroad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Duke looked incredulous,  &ldquo;do you mean to say you think somebody murdered Parke? Maybe the same one who  did for the rest of the family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be,&rdquo; agreed Hale, &ldquo;that is if  it ain&rsquo;t sooicide. Now, I incline to that theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; Duke declared. &ldquo;Why in the  world would a youngster like that commit suicide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have,&rdquo; said Fleming  Stone. &ldquo;I think Parke has been greatly depressed by the two violent deaths in  the house, and it worked on his mind so that he became despondent and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Duke. &ldquo;He was  shocked and excited, &mdash;knocked galley-west, in fact,&mdash;but despondent, to the  extent of doing away with himself, no! A thousand times, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;  Stone asked.</p>
<p>The man roused himself a little,  looked at Stone with his tired, despairing eyes, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what to think! I  engaged you, Mr. Stone, to do my thinking for me, in these terrible matters.  How do I know what to think? Like Duke, I can&rsquo;t think the boy killed himself,  by such horrible means&mdash; yet, how could a murderer accomplish the deed? Parke  wasn&rsquo;t the sort to obey unquestioning, the word of a stranger. How could any  one have inveigled him out on that patch of thin ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he did get out there,&rdquo; said  Stone, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Somehow or other he did himself drive his car out there.  And then, he went down, and the hole froze over again. Now, there are only  three explanations; accident, suicide or murder. I incline to the last, because  I think Parke was not the sort to take his own life, and I can think of no  explanation for an accident. Can anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; Duke said. &ldquo;Parke  was a daredevil, but he was not foolhardy. He might have skated over that patch  of thin ice, to see if it would bear him, but I can&rsquo;t imagine his deliberately  going out on it in a car! And yet, the theory of murder is very improbable. How  could that have been brought about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say,&rdquo; Stone mused.  &ldquo;We must assume Parke in his car,&mdash;willingly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why willingly?&rdquo; Duke demurred.  &ldquo;Why not at the point of a pistol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could be!&rdquo; exclaimed Hale,  who could not imagine things for himself. &ldquo;Say Parke was starting off for a bit  of a ride, unknown to those bat-blind guards. Say, Mr. Murderer comes up to  him, and orders him to head for the lake. Say Parke starts to yell and is shut  up&mdash;there musta been more&rsquo;n one against him,&mdash;and, well, if he won&rsquo;t go out on  the lake, say they push his car along, him in it and all, and when they get to  that shelving beach, they give it a mighty shove, and off she goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take such a mighty  shove,&rdquo; said Jim Paddock. &ldquo;A mere push would do it. And that would explain the  brakes. You see the wheels were stopped, but the car slid over the ice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happened,&rdquo; declared  Hunter, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the only way it could&rsquo;ve happened. Now, to find the villains  that did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be smarter than  you have been so far, to find that out,&rdquo; jeered Paddock. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that smart  detec of yours? That Whitney feller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, where is Whitney?&rdquo;  asked Duke.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Whitney  appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the queerest thing,&rdquo; he  declared, looking mystified, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been searching the grounds, with some  troopers and some volunteers from the neighbors&rsquo; but we can&rsquo;t find a trace of  anybody having been here, either in a car or on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you expect to,&rdquo; asked  Stone, &ldquo;after nearly a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, it hasn&rsquo;t thawed at all.  The ice and snow-crusted roads and fields would take tire tracks, or even  footprints and hold them a long time. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they would  or not, there aren&rsquo;t any,&mdash; at least, none that we can find. That brings it back  to accident or suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, find out which it was!&rdquo;  Duke exclaimed. &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, do something! What are detectives good for,  anyway? I don&rsquo;t see as Mr. Whitney or Mr. Stone either has done a thing! I have  heard that the more violent or bizarre a crime is, the more easy it is of  solution. Surely the crimes in this family have been violent enough and bizarre  enough! As a family we are being steadily and surely wiped out. I suppose it  will be my turn next and then Dad and Lolly! Where is it to stop? If any! When  I think of my wife&rsquo;s cruel death, I could take those iron gloves and tear the  murderer&rsquo;s heart out of his breast! If it is a man! Sometimes I think only a  woman could invent those fiendish killings! The female of the species is more  deadly than the male! I wonder if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you are wondering!&rdquo;  The door from the hall flew open and Miss Burt fairly fell into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been listening at the  keyhole! I heard you, Duke Bailey! I know you mean me! Well, you don&rsquo;t suspect  me a bit more than I suspect you! So, there now! You and Martha quarreled all  the time. You wanted your mother&rsquo;s money, and now, you want to do away with  Parke and Lolly, so you&rsquo;ll be the only heir! You know your poor old father  can&rsquo;t live long. Look at him! Ill already from your terrible crimes! Yet nobody  drives it home to you. You pull wool over their eyes. You detectives, you see  nothing,&mdash;nothing at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Marigold, do be quiet,&rdquo; came  in a wail from Owen Bailey.</p>
<p>The harassed man felt he could  stand no more, and as Marigold had truly said, he looked ill from all the  excitement and horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t accuse you, George,&rdquo;  said Duke, looking at her with a half smile of contempt. &ldquo;I doubt if you&rsquo;d be  able to put over such a series of really clever criminal deeds! If I referred  to a woman, rest assured you are not the woman I had in my mind at all. Now, do  the handsome, George, and say you didn&rsquo;t really mean you suspected me, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke was not at all in flippant  mood, but he never had been able to take Marigold Burt seriously, and he never  could resist an opportunity to give her a ragging.</p>
<p>She glared at him, not at all sure  he hadn&rsquo;t meant her after all. But she was not to be silenced, and she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, Duke. I  wouldn&rsquo;t put it past you, and anyway, it rests between you and Albert  Sheridan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; cried Owen Bailey, shocked  into sudden speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your spick and span partner.  Oh, you haven&rsquo;t wit enough to suspect him, I know, but if you&rsquo;d keep your eyes  open a bit, you&rsquo;d see reasons galore for his guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, Dad,&rdquo; said Duke,  noting his father&rsquo;s irate face and pulsing veins. &ldquo;Do keep still,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have a  stroke! Let me tackle Marigold. Speak up, now, George, what possible motive  could Mr. Sheridan have for crime &mdash;our crimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a deep one,&rdquo; Marigold said, in  a hollow, sepulchral voice, &ldquo;he is a very deep one. He killed Blandena, of  course, by mistake for Owen, then he decided to kill off the rest of the  family, knowing that would bring about Owen&rsquo;s own death. Nobody could live  through many of these terrible scenes. Then, Albert can have his ambition  gratified,&mdash;he will be at the head of the firm,&mdash;he will be the firm. He is in  debt now,&mdash;oh, fearfully in debt. He can pay off his debts and have all the  Bailey money besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush that nonsense, George!&rdquo; Duke  commanded. &ldquo;I never heard such drivel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drivel, is it? I saw him myself,  that first night, as he got out of his car and tried to come in at a front  window. Where was he the night Martha was killed? Where was he the night Parke  disappeared? Right here every time! No, Duke, a woman never committed those  crimes, but it didn&rsquo;t need a strong man to do them. Albert Sheridan, gentleman  that he is, even dandy, could wield a dagger or a pair of steel gauntlets  easily. And he is clever enough to entrap Parke in some way. I don&rsquo;t know how  it was done, but you all know of Albert&rsquo;s ingenious mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen was staring at her, almost as  if impressed by her words.</p>
<p>Hunter and Hale were lapping it  all up, and wondering where they could find Sheridan.</p>
<p>Whitney looked frankly incredulous,  and Fleming Stone said, peremptorily,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send that woman out of the room.  Whether her tirade has any sense to it or not, we have no time to consider  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marigold went, when the sheriff  told her to, and Hunter turned to Fleming Stone as if he were the only one who  was in a position to advise the harried officers of the law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in anything like  this before,&rdquo; Hunter wailed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has ever been in any such  coil as this?&rdquo; the coroner cried. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody ever has! I don&rsquo;t  believe there ever was another such case. Do you, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very many, I should say. Now,  leaving for the moment, the solution of our mysteries, let us plan what to do.  For one thing we must increase the guard. Much as I should like to do so, I  cannot think this series of crimes is completed. Against my will, I have to  admit that it seems to me there may be more terrible deeds. Perhaps not, in  which case, we will all be grateful, but as a precaution I suggest more guards  and more care in locking up and protecting this house at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nobody came in at night to  kill Parke,&rdquo; said Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but somebody did in the cases  of Mrs. Bailey, and your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if it was an outsider,&rdquo; Duke  said, his thoughts flying back to Marigold, whom he did suspect, though he had  so strenuously denied it. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take any stock in the Sheridan suggestion,  can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; spoke up his father,  angrily. &ldquo;The idea of lugging in Albert&rsquo;s name! Duke, can&rsquo;t we get rid of that  Burt woman? Get her out of the house, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until after these murders are  cleared up, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo; Hunter told him. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;when will that be?&rsquo;  Have a heart. You know yourself we&rsquo;re doing our best, but this is a most  discouragin&rsquo; case,&mdash;or cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is,&rdquo; said Bailey, in a  choked, faint voice. &ldquo;And as I can&rsquo;t help you any just at present, I think I&rsquo;ll  go to my room for a time, and rest. This new trouble is almost unbearable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go with you, Mr. Bailey,&rdquo;  and young Whitney sprang to assist the broken, weary looking man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Dad&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Duke said,  speaking in a low voice. &ldquo;Now I want to say something. Do you suppose,&rdquo; he  looked from one to another, &ldquo;do you suppose, for a minute, that Lolly can be at  the bottom of all this? Now, listen,&mdash;before you bite my head off! I read a  story, two or three stories, lately, where the criminal was a lovely young  girl. It seems they have manias, that we know little about,&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; he paused,  silenced by the startled faces of his hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duke Bailey,&rdquo; Hunter fairly shouted  at him, &ldquo;one more such word as that, and I&rsquo;ll clap you in jail myself! Nothing  but your own guilt could make you hint at such a dastardly thing as you have  done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Sheriff,&rdquo; Stone said,  placatingly, &ldquo;a man has a right to voice his thoughts. Women,&mdash;yes, and young  girls, have been known to be the most depraved and vicious criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lolly!&rdquo; Hunter repeated, his  face aghast, &ldquo;Lolly Bailey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Stone soothed him, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say I subscribe to the theory, I don&rsquo;t even admit it might be a true one,  but I do say Duke has a right to suggest it. Remember Lolly&rsquo;s hysterical  nature. Her independent spirit. The free and easy ways of young people  nowadays. And, most of all, remember that we have no logical suspect, no real  criminal, against whom we have the slightest hint of evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not accusing Lolly,&rdquo; Duke  went on, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was at the table with us, the  night Parke disappeared,&rdquo; Stone said, reminiscently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Duke was impatient.  &ldquo;But she would have to have had an accomplice, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Hale fairly shouted at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hunter broke into guffaws of  laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your theory was crazy enough,  Duke,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without lugging in that nitwit. I guess we&rsquo;ll dismiss it all  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Duke said, &ldquo;let me  know when you get a better one.&rdquo; He flung himself out of the room, and the  others set to work in earnest to meet the conditions imposed upon them by the  discovery of Parke&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>It took some hours, and all were  appalled at the weary outlook.</p>
<p>Again the mortician and his men.  Again the coroner&rsquo;s inquest. Again the reporters coming, the neighbors&rsquo; visits,  the stunned household, the demoralized servants.</p>
<p>The three Baileys, Miss Burt, and  Mr. Sheridan all went to their rooms and stayed there, leaving Fleming Stone to  represent them as best he could.</p>
<p>That bewildered detective was at  his wits&rsquo; end. Not but what he had a suspicion, and a very definite one, as to  who the criminal might be, but he had no least shred of evidence and no hint of  anything like proof.</p>
<p>Yet he felt he must make a move,  even if he turned out to be wrong in his surmises.</p>
<p>At dinner time the whole family  reappeared. The rest had done them good, for though not cheerful, they were  quiet and courteous, and seemingly trying to help one another to bear the  cumulative troubles.</p>
<p>After dinner, they congregated in  the living room. By common consent the subject of the murders was not touched  upon at all.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was unlikely to  gain any hints or bits of information, Stone excused himself and went early up  to his room.</p>
<p>He locked himself in, and after  reading for an hour or two, to divert his mind a little, he went to bed.</p>
<p>It was perhaps four o&rsquo;clock when  he awoke.</p>
<p>On an impulse, he rose and  slipping on a dressing gown he noiselessly unlocked his door, and stepped out  into the hall. There was no moonlight now, only the dim light of an ornamental  electric lantern that hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>He listened, but the silence was  unbroken by the slightest sound.</p>
<p>He went along to the door of  Duke&rsquo;s bedroom, and put his ear to the panel.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone was blessed,&mdash;he  sometimes called it cursed,&mdash;with very acute hearing, and he listened intently  for the sound of breathing.</p>
<p>Not hearing it, he tapped lightly,  and then softly called, &ldquo;Duke, Duke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no response came, and, with a  determined gesture, he turned the knob of the door. But he found it locked, and  though he called again and rapped more loudly, no answer did he receive from  Duke Bailey&rsquo;s room. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  The Death of Duke Bailey</b></h2>
<p>Uncertain what to do, but  determined to find out if anything were wrong, Stone stood outside Duke&rsquo;s door,  when the door directly opposite opened, and Miss Burt&rsquo;s head appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; she  demanded. &ldquo;Who are you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Stone,&rdquo; he said, scanning the  unlovely apparition, whose dark flannel robe and hair twisted in curl papers  made a far from attractive ensemble. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t raise the house, unless&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s  necessary, and I begin to think it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she said,  crossing the hall and standing at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make Duke hear, and I&rsquo;m a  little anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder! I saw him going up to  bed last night. Fuller followed, carrying a tray with a decanter and a siphon  on it. I know what <i>that</i> means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, perhaps he&rsquo;s a bit  groggy, then. Shall we just leave him lay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so&mdash;oh, Mr. Stone,  you don&rsquo;t think,&mdash; do you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything, Miss  Burt, except that he must be very sound asleep&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s really a light sleeper&mdash;generally.  Parke slept like a log, but not Duke. Shall I get Fuller?&rdquo; Stone came nearer  liking the woman then, than he ever had before. She seemed more human, more  helpful than he had ever known her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, it can do no harm. Do  you know where he sleeps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She disappeared, toward a back  staircase, and Stone turned back to the unresponsive door.</p>
<p>But his repeated summons brought  no success, so he waited patiently for Fuller.</p>
<p>When the butler came, fully and  properly attired, Stone explained the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t feel alarmed,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;but for the cloud that seems to hang over this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I understand. But, you  see, Mr. Duke went to bed all right, about eleven or so, and he locked his door  at once. Nobody could get at him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. But I tell  you, Fuller, I must get into that room. Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. Shall we break in  the door, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! That is what they do in the  story books. Invariably they smash through a door, breaking the fine old panels,  when there are plenty of windows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Windows, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, windows! Don&rsquo;t be a fool,  Fuller!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get somebody, some strong chap,  and tell him to get a long ladder. Is there one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, of course. It will  be in the tool house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl of Northumberland stalked  majestically off, and Marigold reappeared, in a flowing robe of gold brocade.  Her forehead was fringed with curls and she was ready for any amazement.</p>
<p>Stone bade her bring a chair, as  they would probably have to wait for the slow movements of the servants.</p>
<p>Fuller returned for orders, and  Stone went downstairs and out doors with him, leaving Marigold in charge.</p>
<p>He ordered the ladder put against  the house at one of Duke&rsquo;s windows, and himself ran up its rounds.</p>
<p>The window was open at the top,  and Stone pushed up the lower sash, then the upper one, and stepped inside.</p>
<p>Finding the light switch he threw  it on and the ensuing flood of light revealed the inert body of Duke Bailey  lying on the bed.</p>
<p>Somewhat twisted and contorted, it  was easy to see the poor fellow had died in severe pain of some sort.</p>
<p>Stone quickly felt his pulse and  his heart, and finding the body cold, realized there was no hope of saving his  life.</p>
<p>He leaned out of the window and  spoke to Fuller:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put away the ladder again, and  come up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, before opening the door, he  took a swift glance round the room.</p>
<p>The tray Fuller had brought up,  was on the table, with a used glass beside it.</p>
<p>Stone smelled of the whisky in the  decanter, but noticed nothing unusual about its odor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;all  that will be investigated. I must notify Mr. Bailey. Oh, Lord, another one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone was deeply chagrined  at his inability to solve the mystery of the Bailey murders.</p>
<p>Yet he had spared no effort, had  omitted no detail of investigation or search. He could only ascribe his failure  to the Machiavellian cunning of the criminal.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible that one man  could compass all this villainy, yet Stone never for a moment doubted that there  was but one author and instrument of the crimes.</p>
<p>He opened the door to the hall,  and found Marigold there, her face filled with horror and apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another,&rdquo; Stone said, sadly.</p>
<p>It was nearing five o&rsquo;clock now,  and Stone concluded Owen Bailey ought to be informed.</p>
<p>He preferred to break the news  himself, so he went directly to the room that had been Blandena&rsquo;s and which  Owen was still using.</p>
<p>Softly turning the knob and  finding the door unlocked, he stepped inside.</p>
<p>A small night lamp was burning,  and by its light Stone could see the face of the sleeping man as he lay on the  pillow.</p>
<p>Very white and worn the face was,  with deep hollows under the sunken eyes.</p>
<p>Stone felt a wave of pity for the  tortured man, and wondered what the future held of happiness that might  recompense him for all this sorrow, if indeed, he were not himself swept into  the maelstrom of crime and death.</p>
<p>As he stood at the bedside, he  sensed another presence and turned to see Lolly, a kimono over her pajamas, standing  beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she  whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waken Father! He&rsquo;s been restless all night, and only just now  dropped off to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must waken him,&rdquo; Stone  returned, softly. &ldquo;Duke is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told her the news thus suddenly  on purpose to watch her reactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, in a funny little  squeal, which she tried to stifle with her hand against her lips.</p>
<p>But it wakened her father, who  opened dazed eyes on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, for he was  the sort that wakens at once alert and wide awake. &ldquo;What are you two doing  here? What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly five,&rdquo; Stone told him.  &ldquo;Mr. Bailey, they&rsquo;ve &mdash;they&rsquo;ve got Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; exclaimed the  anguished man, dropping back on his pillow, and closing his eyes. &ldquo;What&mdash; what  happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t investigated. I came straight to tell you. But you are ill, Mr. Bailey.  Suppose you stay in bed, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, indeed. I&rsquo;ll get my  gown,&mdash;I won&rsquo;t stop to dress now&mdash;oh, my son,&mdash;my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeming to fling off his lethargy by  sheer will power, Owen pushed his bare feet into slippers and threw a dressing  gown about him. Then without waiting for any one, he strode along the corridor  to Duke&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>He saw the shocking sight, and  turned his face away for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, controlling himself, he  leaned over and looked at the contorted face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;does it  look like&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped short, and began to give orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuller,&rdquo; he said, seeing the  butler hovering in the hall. &ldquo;Go and telephone for Doctor Fenn. Then, I see  you&rsquo;re dressed, rouse the other servants. Tell them to make coffee and get a  breakfast ready as soon as they can. Call Mr. Sheridan, and tell him what has  happened. If he asks for details refer him to me or to Mr. Stone. He will  probably want to get up, but if not, tell him to do as he pleases, and take him  some coffee. Do those things, then report back here. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey turned back into Duke&rsquo;s  room, and listened while Stone told him about having a ladder and climbing it  himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work,&rdquo; Bailey said. &ldquo;All  nonsense breaking in a door. Better cut out a pane of glass if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I think. Tell me  about last evening, after I came upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We didn&rsquo;t any of us stay  down long. Sheridan went to bed early and so did Marigold. Duke went up next,  and Lolly and I talked a little and then we came up together. That&rsquo;s all. I  went to bed at once, but I slept very poorly. I had just fallen into a doze, I  think, when you came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what Lolly said. Now,  Marigold says that Duke had Fuller bring up whisky and soda for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he often does. But Duke  doesn&rsquo;t drink much, he&rsquo;s an abstemious chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, he had a decanter and a  siphon. Why not a glass full?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Duke&rsquo;s way. But, look,  you can see for yourself the boy didn&rsquo;t take much. Fuller will tell you the  decanter was about half full. And it&rsquo;s a third full now. Why, are you thinking  he took too much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all. I&rsquo;m wondering  what killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that we&rsquo;ll have to wait for the  doctor&rsquo;s coming. By the way, I think I&rsquo;ll take a drop of this whisky myself.  I&rsquo;m all in, Stone, with these horrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do take a drink, Bailey, you need  it. But hold on, maybe that is poisoned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. If it killed my  boy, it can kill me!&rdquo; Rinsing the glass in the adjoining bathroom, Bailey  poured out a moderate drink and drained the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better have some, Stone,&rdquo; he  said, after a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want any just now.  Look out, don&rsquo;t lean too hard on that little table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he spoke too late, the small  table went over with a crash.</p>
<p>The whisky decanter was not on it,  but the siphon of soda was, and it was broken by the fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; Bailey said, picking  up the larger pieces, and throwing them in the bathroom wash-basin. &ldquo;Look,  Stone, here&rsquo;s nearly half the soda left in the lower part of the siphon. That  will be enough for the coroner to examine, when he looks for poison. He can  have the rest of this whisky, too, though my test of it ought to be enough.  Shall we dress now, or wait till Fenn comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dress now, while we have a  chance. You go along, and take your time, Mr. Bailey. I&rsquo;ll stay here until some  one comes, who is really responsible. I want to look around a bit, anyway.  Wait, tell me again about Duke&rsquo;s coming upstairs last night. Was that the  whisky and soda that we had before I came up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the same whisky. Fuller  brought another siphon, as there was so little of that left. You see, when Duke  went up, there was no one left downstairs but Lolly and myself, and as I didn&rsquo;t  want another drink, I told Duke he could have it. So, Fuller fixed a tray and  took it along. Do you suspect poisoning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. What else could it be?  He died practically in convulsions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but how could he have  been poisoned? Mightn&rsquo;t it be acute indigestion? Duke ate an enormous dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it might be. Doctor Fenn  will decide all that. I can&rsquo;t help feeling, Mr. Bailey, that I am disappointing  you in my work. But I assure you I am doing all that is humanly possible. And,  I must express my sympathy for you and my admiration of the way you meet these  successive blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet them!&rdquo; said Bailey,  dejectedly. &ldquo;I am crushed by them. If I seem to brace up and tackle the  terrible situation, it is only from a sense of duty. I am broken in spirit and  I am also breaking down physically.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give way. You still have  Lolly left to live for, and please God nothing must happen to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will,&rdquo; and Bailey&rsquo;s sunken  eyes looked piteously at Stone. &ldquo;She will go next, and then myself, and then  John Kennedy will be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a deep sigh, the stricken man  went away to his own room.</p>
<p>As soon as his door closed after  him, Lolly came from her room and joined Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to come while Dad  was here,&rdquo; she said, chokingly, &ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t stand it. Let me in, let me  see Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not, dear child,&rdquo; said  Stone, gently. &ldquo;Why not remember him as you last saw him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a child,&rdquo; Lolly returned,  &ldquo;and if I were, these experiences would do away with all childhood for me. Oh,  Mr. Stone, where will this thing end? Must I be the next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lolly, no! By God, you shall  not be sacrificed, if I have to put you in a convent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost as bad!&rdquo; and she gave a  faint little smile. &ldquo;Now, I must see Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one glance was enough, and the  girl turned away, shuddering.</p>
<p>Without a word, she left the room,  and Stone turned back to his occupation of scanning everything about in hope of  a clew.</p>
<p>But he well knew, if Duke was  really murdered, and if it was the work of the same hand as the others, he would  find no clew,&mdash;save and except the one he fully expected to find, and which he  did find, pushed partly beneath a clothes brush that lay on the chiffonier.</p>
<p>A strip of aluminum, the  counterpart of the others, with the same legend, &lsquo;Vengeance is Mine&rsquo; in raised  letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is murder,&rdquo; Stone  concluded, &ldquo;and by the same hand. Oh, why can&rsquo;t I get a line on it? An inkling  of the truth? Here was Duke, locked in his room, and poisoned, I can&rsquo;t doubt,  by something he ate or drank. Yet the drink is the same as the family and I,  myself, partook of during the evening. And it can&rsquo;t be a matter of acute  indigestion, now that I&rsquo;ve found the sign manual of the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though he hunted the bedroom  and the bathroom, and the dressing room which had been shared by Duke and his  wife, there was no unusual or indicative object to be found.</p>
<p>The whisky was dearly harmless,  for Bailey had taken a fair portion, and had swallowed it neat.</p>
<p>The glass of the soda siphon, was  almost intact, save that the metal spigot at the top had broken off, and this,  with some bits of broken glass was still in the marble basin in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Going to examine them, Stone found  the hot water faucet dripping, and a cloud of steam arising in consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needs a washer,&rdquo; the detective  commented as he tried to turn the faucet entirely off.</p>
<p>But the remaining part of the  container was more than half full of soda water and Stone knew analysis could  be made from that.</p>
<p>Doctor Fenn came, followed quickly  by young Whitney, whom the doctor had notified at once.</p>
<p>Stone tarried to listen to the  doctor&rsquo;s first reaction to the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prussic acid,&rdquo; Fenn said, as he  stooped to smell of the dead man&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Now, how did that come about?&rdquo; Stone  stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure? For I don&rsquo;t see how  it could have come about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, don&rsquo;t quote me, till I  investigate further. What about that whisky there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone told the doctor all he knew  about the whisky and soda water, explaining that Bailey had upset the table in  his nervous excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go next,&rdquo; prophesied the  doctor. &ldquo;If not by the murderer&rsquo;s hand, then by general collapse. He&rsquo;s due for  a stroke, in my opinion. But I must see about this chap. Lend a hand, Whitney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone went off to get  dressed, but on reaching his own room, he dropped on the edge of the bed, and  sat there fully ten minutes, lost in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s working out,&rdquo; he said to  himself, looking puzzled and worried. &ldquo;If I could only get a scrap of evidence.  If I only had one tangible and reliable clew. The metal strips are sure-fire  clews, but they are not evidence. Yet the murderer must have a store of the  things. I don&rsquo;t believe he stamps out a new one for each victim. If he did  that, they would be brighter. And, also, the machines nowadays, mostly print  the silly things in pink letters on white backgrounds. I&rsquo;ve found that out.  But, oh, the things I haven&rsquo;t found out! Now, how shall I stop this massacre?  Somebody wants to wipe out the whole Bailey family and I must find out who it  is! But every death is so different from the others. Last night, now, if Duke  locked his door at once, as Fuller says he did, and if nobody from the house  was admitted by Duke after that, then we have the familiar problem of the crime  in the hermetically sealed room. That has been adjudged child&rsquo;s play by the  detective story fans! H&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;d like to see how said child would play with this  case! Suppose that by questioning we are convinced that no member of the  household did go to Duke&rsquo;s room, after he locked the door, then it comes back  to an intruder by the window. Which means a ladder! Gracious goodness, I must  hop down and see if there are any other marks than those made by the ladder I  climbed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone hurried through his toilet,  greatly cast down at this new tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fine detective!&rdquo; he told  himself, scornfully. &ldquo;I ought to glance around Duke&rsquo;s bedroom, and say &lsquo;The  murderer is five feet, ten inches tall, and weighs one hundred and sixty-three  pounds. He has dark hair and&rsquo;&mdash;oh, tush, all those fool stunts are back numbers  now, along with the Trichinopoly cigar and the broken cuff-link. I&rsquo;ve got to  solve this mystery,&mdash;these mysteries, by pure reason, by absolute ratiocination.  And I&rsquo;m going to do it! I haven&rsquo;t a clew, I haven&rsquo;t a scrap of evidence, but I  have a hunch,&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t mean a fool hunch, like a policeman gets, I mean an  intelligent, intellectual, inexorable hunch, that demands attention.</p>
<p>And it includes that beautiful  doll, who has the misfortune to be a trifle shy on brains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He finished his dressing, while  humming the old song:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I once had a beautiful doll,  dears,<br>
The prettiest doll in the world&rdquo;;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&rdquo; he concluded, as he gave a  final pat to his tie, &ldquo;that beautiful doll is going to lead me in the way of  truth and righteousness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of which might argue that  Fleming Stone was taking this affair in a light manner, but the argument would  be unsound. He was more in earnest than he had ever been in his life, and more  determined to achieve success, even a belated success, than ever before.</p>
<p>Leaving his room, he paused to  note that the door of Duke&rsquo;s room was closed, so he went on downstairs to  breakfast.</p>
<p>Round the table, in the breakfast  room, he found Sheridan, Marigold, Lolly and her father.</p>
<p>No one was eating the delicious  food that Cooper had prepared, yet all were toying with it, and seemed bravely  trying to keep up the lagging conversation.</p>
<p>Stone concentrated his gaze on  Sheridan&rsquo;s face, though careful not to seem to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going down to New York,  to-day, Mr. Sheridan?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did expect to, but&mdash;&rdquo; he paused  and turned his glance on Owen Bailey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;d better go, Albert,&rdquo;  Bailey said. &ldquo;Those securities of Fowler and Co., must be looked after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said a voice  in the doorway, and Coroner Hale came into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just here,&rdquo; Hale went on.  &ldquo;May I have a cup of coffee, and will you people tell me a bit about this new  trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Bailey. &ldquo;Fuller,  lay a place for Doctor Hale. Sit there, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl of Northumberland  tiptilted his haughty nose at the idea of the police at table with his employer,  but he obeyed orders promptly.</p>
<p>Hale was terse and even abrupt in  his queries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who saw Duke last?&rdquo; he flung out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuller, so far as we know,&rdquo;  Bailey said, and the coroner turned to the butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went upstairs with Mr. Duke,&rdquo;  he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you?&rdquo; shouted Hale,  &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t he able to walk up alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My man isn&rsquo;t deaf, Doctor Hale,&rdquo;  said Bailey, pleasantly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scream so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale glowered angrily, but lowered  his voice a bit. &ldquo;Answer my question,&rdquo; he growled at Fuller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Mr. Duke did walk  upstairs alone. I followed with a tray for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was on the tray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A decanter of spirits, a siphon  of soda water, and a highball glass. Also a couple of biscuit on a small plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did Mr. Duke partake of these  in your presence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, he did not. I placed the  tray on a small table and left him. I heard him lock his door as I crossed the  hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only your word for all  this, my man,&rdquo; and the coroner looked at Fuller with an accusing stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the butler with  his usual imperturbability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no one to corroborate  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one or two of the other  servants, who were in the servants&rsquo; sitting room when I came down. I told  them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll learn what you told them.  Which ones were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cooper and Miss Agnes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought Stone, &ldquo;so the  dumbbell has come to be called Miss Agnes. I wonder why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for them,&rdquo; commanded Hale,  and promptly enough the two indicated appeared in the breakfast room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  How Could It Have Happened?</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What did Mr. Fuller tell you last  evening when he returned from taking Mr. Duke upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was addressed to Mrs.  Cooper, but the beautiful Agnes chose to answer it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he had taken all the  drink up to Mr. Duke&rsquo;s room, and he wondered if more would be wanted  downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak when you&rsquo;re spoken to,  Miss,&rdquo; Hale stormed at her. &ldquo;I asked Mrs. Cooper, not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great lovely eyes filled with  crystal tears, and Agnes looked like Guido Reni&rsquo;s repentant Magdalen.</p>
<p>But no one at the table paid the  least attention, and Stone marveled again that he had never seen any of the  family in the slightest degree intrigued by the girl&rsquo;s undeniable beauty.</p>
<p>To be sure, this morning they  could not be expected to take an interest in anything, but it had been always  the same.</p>
<p>Stone, at first, had fully  expected to find either Duke or Parke a victim to this exquisite creature, but  apparently, the Bailey men were above vulgar interest in a servant.</p>
<p>Further questioning brought no  further information, and as Sheridan and Miss Burt said exactly the same thing,  Stone concluded Bailey&rsquo;s account had been true and accurate.</p>
<p>Stone had gone upstairs, first of  all, the night before. Next had gone Sheridan and then, Marigold Burt.</p>
<p>Dismissing the two servants,  suddenly Hale turned to Lolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you and your father were the  last to remain downstairs last evening?&rdquo; he said, letting a more gentle note  creep into his harsh voice at the sight of her anguished face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she returned, &ldquo;Dad and I sat  here and talked for about half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you talk about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the terrible troubles we  have been having.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me, Hale,&rdquo; said Owen Bailey,  noticing how hard Lolly was trying to keep from sobbing aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; Lolly begged, &ldquo;I c-can&rsquo;t  t-talk any more!&rdquo; more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She buried her face in her  handkerchief, and her whole frame shook with tumultuous sobs.</p>
<p>Marigold, who sat next her, tried  to put an arm round her, but Lolly shook her off, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Hale said. &ldquo;After you  and Miss Lolly talked awhile, you both went upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bailey stated. &ldquo;Lolly went  first. Then I went to the front door and looked outside. It&rsquo;s a habit of mine,  I do it every night. Then I closed the front door and locked it, and went  upstairs to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see any one, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Lolly. As I passed her room,  her door stood ajar, and she called out, &lsquo;Good-night, Daddy,&rsquo; and I said,  &lsquo;Good-night, dear,&rsquo; and then I heard her door close, and I went in my room and  closed my door. That&rsquo;s all I know, until about five o&rsquo;clock this morning, when  Mr. Stone and my daughter waked me up and told me that Duke was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After staying up to talk to your  daughter, did you not feel a desire for another drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey looked at the coroner, with  a show of hauteur. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not addicted to spirits at all. I admit  that during these crucial times, I have indulged oftener than is my usual  habit. But I am not a drinking man, and last evening, I never thought of  wanting any more. If I had I should have asked Fuller to bring it. He took the  decanter up to Duke&rsquo;s room, because it was there at hand, and I said I wanted  no more. But my son was not at all given to over-indulgence. Like me, he has  taken more than usual of late. It is not surprising in view of what we are  going through. Duke frequently had spirits in his room, but he takes only a  little. Fuller can tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the butler said, being  asked, &ldquo;Mr. Duke often had a decanter in his room, of nights, but sometimes he  doesn&rsquo;t touch it at all. Then again, he&rsquo;ll take a drink, and once in a great  while, maybe a couple of drinks. But more than that, never, sir. I know,  because it&rsquo;s my business to check up on the wine and liquors that are  consumed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Bailey is also  abstemious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir,&rdquo; Fuller declared.  &ldquo;Mr. Bailey didn&rsquo;t hardly even touch whisky before these awful troubles began.  Since then, he has taken it now and then, but in the greatest moderation, sir.  I was not at all surprised when Mr. Bailey told me to take the decanter  upstairs, and then asked for no more for himself. No, sir, I was not surprised  a mite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone remembered Bailey&rsquo;s taking a  drink in Duke&rsquo;s room that morning, and he, too, felt no surprise that the man  should have felt the need of it.</p>
<p>Hale then turned to Fleming Stone,  with his queries. &ldquo;You were the first to find out what had happened, this  morning, I believe,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stone returned, and gave a  succinct account of his discovery from start to finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, about that broken siphon.  How did that happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my fault,&rdquo; put in Owen  Bailey. &ldquo;I upset the table on which the siphon stood. As a matter of fact, I  was beside myself with grief and horror. I felt that a small drink would brace  me up, if only temporarily. I am a most moderate drinker, but when I feel the  real need of it, I do not hesitate to take it. Mr. Stone cried out to have a  care, the whisky might be poisoned. But I was so desperately distressed at the  sight of my dead boy, I didn&rsquo;t care much whether it was poisoned or not. I  swallowed a drink, unheeding, but as it did me no harm, I suppose we may  conclude there was no poison in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be ascertained by  chemical analysis, Mr. Bailey, but as you say, it cannot have been poisoned or  it would have harmed you. Now, as to the soda water. Did you not use that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. As I said, I was  nearly distracted, and I swallowed my drink neat. Then, perhaps the sudden dose  of alcohol went to my head, I leaned upon the table so heavily that I tipped it  over. I confess I scarcely knew what I was doing. But, fortunately the glass  broke near the top, and much of the soda water remained in the container. So,  that, too, can be analyzed. Soon after that, I went to my own room and dressed.  My sudden dizziness passed off, and I felt none the worse for my indulgence.  Indeed, it did brace me up, physically, as was only natural. That is all I know  of the whole matter, Doctor Hale. But I hope that you and your detective, aided  by my private detective here, can solve this mystery even if the others  continue to baffle you. It would seem to my untrained mind that an intruder  must have come in by the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why does that seem so  self-evident, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it must have been so, or  else the murderer was let in at the door by Duke himself. Now, I happen to know  that the lock of Duke&rsquo;s room is somewhat out of order. The key sticks and  refuses to turn. It can be turned, if sufficient force is used, but it makes a  loud, grating sound, which can be heard by any one, if the house is still. I  think if Duke had unlocked his door, some one must have heard it. And, if not,  then the intruder must have entered by the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no balcony from his  windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That would imply a ladder,  would it not? I&rsquo;m not telling you how to do your own work, Mr. Coroner, but  common sense dictates what I have just said. I couldn&rsquo;t hear the noise I speak  of, because my room,&mdash; I&rsquo;m still using my wife&rsquo;s bedroom,&mdash;is too far away, and  moreover, I have a deaf ear, which if I sleep on the other one, and I usually  do, leaves me unable to hear any sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have heard Duke&rsquo;s door,  if he had unlocked it,&rdquo; Lolly said. &ldquo;I know that sound Father means, I&rsquo;ve heard  it every night lately, when Duke locks his door. I expect that&rsquo;s why Fuller  heard that door locked. And I was awake all night, until after four, anyway.  And I had my door ajar, because I was listening for Father to go to sleep. I  can always tell when he stops tossing restlessly about and goes to sleep. And I  was worried, because he has looked so ill, lately. So, I could hear anything  that went on in the hall. And nothing did. Up to four o&rsquo;clock, or half-past  three, anyway, there was no sound of Duke&rsquo;s door, or anybody else&rsquo;s. I was in  and out of the hall half a dozen times, listening at Father&rsquo;s door, and  wondering whether to go in and offer to read to him. Sometimes that quiets him.  But I didn&rsquo;t, and at last he fell asleep. Then I felt free to go to sleep  myself, and I did. But I was wakened again when I heard some one go into  Father&rsquo;s room. It was Mr. Stone,&mdash;and, of course, I haven&rsquo;t been asleep since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly had recovered her calm and  spoke in clear, level tones, that carried entire conviction.</p>
<p>Hale had no slightest doubt that  the girl was telling the exact truth, and Fleming Stone, after listening a few  moments to her straightforward narration, also believed her.</p>
<p>Stone took up the tale and related  how he had gone to tell Owen Bailey of the new tragedy, how Lolly had joined  him at her father&rsquo;s bedside, and how Bailey, himself, had risen quickly and  gone at once to Duke&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Hale, then, with his customary  circumlocution, questioned them all over again, this time giving Marigold her  coveted chance.</p>
<p>Still wearing her gold brocade  dressing gown, she preened herself as she stepped into the limelight.</p>
<p>But Hale cut her story short, and  interrupted with his questions the elaborate descriptions she essayed, so her  triumph was short lived.</p>
<p>Stone looked at her with utter  contempt. He detested all forms of self-love, and he classed vanity and egotism  among the worst of human faults.</p>
<p>Marigold was a mass of self-love,  and simply eaten up with egotism, he decided after he had listened to her  story.</p>
<p>But Hale made short work of her,  and turned to Sheridan.</p>
<p>To this witness, Stone listened  more carefully.</p>
<p>But Albert Sheridan declared he  knew absolutely nothing of the night&rsquo;s proceedings. He said he had gone to bed  at once, on reaching his room. That he had slept well, though not  uninterruptedly. That he had heard no sound of any sort or description in the  house, nor outside, either, until Fuller had come and awakened him and told him  the sad news.</p>
<p>Sheridan was a thorn in Stone&rsquo;s  flesh. He had no reason whatever to suspect Bailey&rsquo;s partner of wrongdoing of  any sort, yet the detective couldn&rsquo;t help the feeling that Sheridan was not  wholly truthful.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing to  rouse doubt in his story, and apparently the coroner was entirely satisfied of  Sheridan&rsquo;s detachment from the case.</p>
<p>The weary details were all  repeated.</p>
<p>The whole day was given over to  what they called preliminary inquiry.</p>
<p>It would seem that what was said  at the breakfast table was enough in that line, but there was more, much more,  before the coroner was ready to betake himself away.</p>
<p>The family and guests were quizzed  again, separately and in batches. The servants, indoors and outdoors, were  questioned by the hour.</p>
<p>Detective Whitney, called on by  the coroner to help, added his powers of querying, and the subject was worn  threadbare.</p>
<p>Sheriff Hunter and Doctor Fenn,  however, showed but slight interest in the coroner&rsquo;s earnest work, and seemed  to prefer to chat with Fleming Stone or Owen Bailey on the subject of the  murders.</p>
<p>Bailey, though still looking  shattered and ill, had pulled himself together in an evident determination to  face the thing bravely and keep up his dignity as head of the house.</p>
<p>Stone admired the way the man had  of rising to an emergency. He took up the reins of government and gave orders  in a clear steady voice, though when alone with Stone or the family, he sank  into an apathy from which he was only roused by some new necessity for his  generalship.</p>
<p>By late afternoon, the autopsy had  been performed, the contents of the decanter and siphon analyzed and the  medical report completed.</p>
<p>Its simple facts were plainly  stated and as plainly contradictory.</p>
<p>The autopsy proved beyond all  possibility of doubt that Duke Bailey had died from the effect of the poison  commonly called prussic acid, but known also as hydrocyanic acid. This had been  taken into the stomach and had caused immediate, almost instant death.</p>
<p>But, the contradictory evidence of  the analysis of the drinks was that the whisky remaining in the decanter was  entirely free from poison or deleterious substance of any kind, and the soda  water remaining in the glass container was equally pure and free from any  taint.</p>
<p>In a word, there was no poison in  the whisky or the soda, and if Duke had imbibed all of the liquid Fuller  carried upstairs, it could not have caused his death, unless from alcoholism,  which was not what he died of.</p>
<p>The means of his death was positively  hydrocyanic poisoning. The way in which the poison was or could have been  administered, was an absolute mystery.</p>
<p>They had carefully examined the  ground beneath Duke&rsquo;s windows, and could find no trace whatever of a ladder  having been placed there, except the one ordered by Stone and brought by Fuller  and his associates.</p>
<p>That ladder had left distinct  traces on the ground and on the painted woodwork of the house. Had there been  any other ladder, similarly used, it must have left its traces.</p>
<p>The intruder might have gained  admission to the house in some way, but even so, it was unlikely he could have  entered Duke&rsquo;s room, with its noise-making lock, and not have wakened the  sleeping man, who was acknowledged by all a light sleeper, even after a strong  nightcap.</p>
<p>The doctor said that Duke had died  about midnight, and up to that time, Lolly, Marigold and Stone himself declared  they had been awake. The grating key must have been heard by some of them, had  it been used.</p>
<p>Yet there it was, the inexplicable  situation.</p>
<p>Detective Whitney was all for  Fuller&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
<p>That energetic young man took  Stone aside and earnestly plead his cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Fuller,&rdquo; he told  Stone, &ldquo;because it can&rsquo;t be any one else. He saw Duke last, and then he heard  Duke lock his door. Now, nobody else could get to Duke, secretly, so Fuller  must have done the poisoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Stone, not greatly  impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he put the poison in the  glass, of course. Then, you see, there was no trace of poison in the whisky or  the soda, but the glass held it, and when Duke put in the whisky and splashed  in the soda,&mdash;there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingenious, but implausible,&rdquo;  Stone told him. &ldquo;Duke is no fool, and he wasn&rsquo;t at all intoxicated. He would  have smelled that stuff, prussic acid is pungent, it smells, you know, like  bitter almonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> smell it! I mean, however it was administered, and you have  to admit it <i>was</i> administered, Duke  didn&rsquo;t smell it, at least, not to the extent of refusing to take it because of  the odor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you assuming that there was  somebody there with him, giving him the stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Stone. But it  seems to me if we rule out Fuller there must have been. Unless we suggest  suicide, and I don&rsquo;t believe that, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not. Duke Bailey had no  reason for wanting to die. He and his wife were not an ideally happy couple,  but at the same time, he wasn&rsquo;t so cut up by her death, that he would take his  own life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Then, if  nobody else was there with him, and since the whisky and soda both have been given  clean bills of health, how did it come about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be you are right, and the  poison was put in the glass before Fuller took it upstairs. Though, mind you,  even that doesn&rsquo;t prove that Fuller did it. Another servant might have fixed  the glass, the beautiful dumbbell, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes! You don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not seriously. But get Fuller  in here and let&rsquo;s ask him a few things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in the library, and in  answer to their ring, Fuller appeared.</p>
<p>Stone let Whitney do the  questioning, and Fuller listened with his usual <i>savoir faire</i>.</p>
<p>He practically repeated the story  as they had already heard it. Then Whitney said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get the glass you  took up on Mr. Duke&rsquo;s tray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my pantry,&rdquo; returned the  butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re sure it was clean and  empty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fuller&rsquo;s really fine eyebrows went  up a trifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only clean glasses in  my pantry, sir. Yes, to my positive knowledge the glass on the tray in question  was both immaculately clean and absolutely empty, when I left it in Mr. Duke&rsquo;s  room. Is that all, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Whitney, not a bit awed  by the butler&rsquo;s hauteur, &ldquo;you said you heard Mr. Duke turn the key in his  lock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going along the hall to the rear  staircase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was immediately after you  left him, or did you delay in the hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not delay. There was no  reason to. I heard the door locked within a few seconds of my leaving the  room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, that is all, Fuller.  You may go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hates me,&rdquo; said Whitney,  smiling. &ldquo;It nearly finished him to remember his manners to me. Well, how about  it, now, Mr. Stone? What price Fuller for our hyper-criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; Stone said,  wearily. &ldquo;I wish I could think so, Whitney, it would simplify matters a lot. But  he isn&rsquo;t our man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Whitney had great respect for  Stone&rsquo;s superior knowledge and experience, but he still believed in his pet  theory, so he dropped the subject and found plenty of other matters to talk  about.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey drifted in then, and  the two detectives welcomed him and bade him sit with them.</p>
<p>They all three mulled over the  question of the whisky and soda, and Stone said, at last:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there was anything in  that soda water that&mdash;well, say a volatile poison, that evaporated after the top  was knocked off this morning, and before the analysis was made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bailey smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think, Mr. Stone you are the  most ingenious man I ever knew. That is a clever idea, though I doubt if any  poison is as volatile as all that. But, while I&rsquo;d be glad of any logical  explanation of the mystery, I&rsquo;ll have to put the kibosh on that. You see, I had  a drink out of that siphon, just before Fuller carried it upstairs. No, I  didn&rsquo;t take any more whisky, I didn&rsquo;t want it, but I splashed out a glass of  soda, which I sipped while I was talking with Lolly. Both she and Fuller will  corroborate this. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that I think you will doubt my word, but in  these investigations we must be very careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that settles the matter of  the siphon,&rdquo; Whitney said, triumphantly. &ldquo;If Mr. Bailey had a drink from it, it  couldn&rsquo;t have been doctored before that. And if after that, it must have been  done by Fuller, on his way upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Improbable,&rdquo; said Bailey, after a  pause. &ldquo;I mean improbable that Fuller could manage such a thing, on his way  upstairs with a well filled tray. Had he stopped <i>en route</i>, Duke would have noticed it. Moreover, I can&rsquo;t think of  the slightest reason Fuller could have had for killing Duke or anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked long and earnestly,  but came back always to the place whence they started, that the poisoning of  Duke Bailey was an inexplicable and insoluble mystery.</p>
<p>And so it remained.</p>
<p>The preliminary inquiries,  repeated again and again, brought no solution. The inquest, now turned into a  double inquest, including both Parke&rsquo;s and Duke&rsquo;s deaths, brought no solution.  The verdict of the long-suffering jury was necessarily what is called the open  verdict. What else could it be?</p>
<p>The newspapers were rampant with  their stories, true, partly true, and false.</p>
<p>Bailey had two of his secretaries  sent down from the office to take charge of his enormous mail, much of it  bringing advice as to how to find the murderer.</p>
<p>The press and the public had  spoused the idea that there was but one murderer, a super-criminal, half man  and half brute, with no heart or soul, but with a diabolically clever brain.</p>
<p>All the details of police routine  were carried out. Guards were stationed everywhere. Detectives of all ranks  infested the premises, each choosing his favorite case to investigate.</p>
<p>Some prowled along the lake edge  seeking clews to Parke&rsquo;s dreadful death. Others hunted evidence of some  intruder who could have poisoned Duke. Some contented themselves with gazing,  awed, at the armored figure on the stairs, though, except by special  permission, few succeeded in getting past Fuller&rsquo;s watchful presence. </p>
<p>The Homicide Bureau and the  Detective Division of the State Headquarters used their utmost ingenuity and  energy to help along, but no help availed, and a fortnight after Duke&rsquo;s death,  the whole problem of the murders was no further along than it was the day after  Duke died.</p>
<p>The household machinery at  Cricklemere went on as usual. The servants were so well trained, and the family  so used to following their own traditions and customs, that there was little  change.</p>
<p>Lolly and her father, the only  Baileys left, seemed to cling together more closely than ever, and Fleming  Stone wrestled with his great problem by day and by night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Last Ditch</b></h2>
<p>It was about a week after the  holiday season.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone had gone away from  Cricklemere over Christmas, saying he was wanted at a family gathering.</p>
<p>But really, he was working on the  case, more earnestly and industriously than he had ever worked on a case  before.</p>
<p>Now, he was returning to  Cricklemere, where Owen Bailey wanted him to stay for some time longer.</p>
<p>Stone told his client, that he was  not sure he could do any more than he had done toward clearing up the case, but  Bailey insisted on his making further trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel safer with you here,&rdquo;  Bailey had said. &ldquo;Yes, I know you haven&rsquo;t prevented any of these terrible  tragedies, but that was in no way your fault. A clever devil, such as the one  we are up against, is not to be brought to book easily. But I still hope that  he has shot his last bolt, and if you&rsquo;ll stay here a week or two longer, I  think I can feel safe alone. But we&rsquo;ll go down to the New York apartment, Lolly  and I. And I shall sell this place. Surely we never want to come up here  again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Lolly say to that?&rdquo;  Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She agrees with me. She&rsquo;s a good  girl, Lolly. She always understood me, even when the others thought I was not  worth listening to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now, they didn&rsquo;t think  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they did. But I don&rsquo;t hold  it up against them. Young people now know it all, and they think all parents  are old fogies. And Blandena always sided with the children. But Lolly,  now,&mdash;little Lolly, stood up for me through thick and thin, except that she  would bother the life out of me about the way I talked. Poor English, she  called it. Pooh, what difference did it make whether I said &lsquo;What kind of a  dog, or what kind of dog?&rsquo; But Lolly holds it a crime to make the least slip.  Well, the poor kiddy doesn&rsquo;t think about it so much now. She has other  troubles. It&rsquo;s awful for her to lose all the Christmas parties and festivities  round the neighborhood. But she won&rsquo;t hear of attending any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;You  couldn&rsquo;t expect her to. Will they have the usual carnival on the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Since Parke&rsquo;s awful affair,  they don&rsquo;t use the lake at all. No ice-boating and almost no skating. Well,  Stone, go to your people for Christmas, since you think you must, and come back  here as soon as you can manage it. I shall stay here a while longer. I&rsquo;ll go to  New York only when absolutely necessary. Sheridan is running things&mdash;running  them into the ground, I daresay, but I can&rsquo;t help that. I&rsquo;m an ill man. These  troubles have shattered me, body and soul. Go on, as you have planned, and let  me know when you are coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this Bailey had said the week  before Christmas, and now, at the end of the first week in January, Stone was  returning.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know everything he  wanted to know, but he did know a lot more than when he went away.</p>
<p>He arrived about five o&rsquo;clock of a  cold, blustery day, and found Owen and Lolly waiting for him in the living  room.</p>
<p>Marigold Burt was there, too, and  Stone concluded Bailey&rsquo;s efforts to oust her from his home circle, had so far,  failed.</p>
<p>Miss Burt was clad in deepest  mourning, as she had come to the conclusion such garb was proper.</p>
<p>But Lolly, though she wore a  little black silk frock, had white frills round the half low neck and half  short sleeves, and the costume was exceedingly becoming.</p>
<p>But the girl looked ill, Stone  thought, or at least, wearied and worn.</p>
<p>She seemed listless and distraite,  and the little hand she put into Stone&rsquo;s hearty grasp was cold and trembling.</p>
<p>Owen Bailey, on the contrary  seemed much improved in health. He was more quiet of mien and more smiling of  countenance.</p>
<p>Stone set it down to the fact that  the excitement of the murders had more or less subsided and the house was free  of policemen and detectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No new developments?&rdquo; Stone  asked, as he seated himself near the blazing fire.</p>
<p>He knew there were none, or he  would have been informed, but he asked the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bailey. &ldquo;I think the  police have decided to let the whole matter go as an unsolved mystery.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t speak very well for our  constabular but I feel sure they have done all they could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed they have,&rdquo; Stone agreed.  &ldquo;As I have and you have. But all we can do is as nothing when we are pitted  against a master criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is that,&rdquo; said Bailey,  musingly. &ldquo;I still think John Kennedy is at the root of the matter, but I think  he has accomplices or emissaries, who do his bidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A master criminal is like that,&rdquo;  Stone told him. &ldquo;He seldom works alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they dropped the sorrowful  subject, and by way of brightening the atmosphere Stone told stories of his  Christmas holidays, and made himself amusing and entertaining.</p>
<p>He kept a sharp watch on his  audience, without appearing to do so.</p>
<p>He noted that Marigold was  nervously on edge and he ascribed this condition to her fear that she would be  turned out on the cold world, when the Baileys left Cricklemere. However she  had received her legacy from Blandena and was now financially independent.</p>
<p>Lolly however, worried him. The  girl presided at the tea table, but though she strove to be natural and casual  of speech, the quick eye of the detective saw that she was wrought up to a  dangerous pitch, and he feared for her. Just what was wrong with her, he didn&rsquo;t  know, but he was sure it was something of recent occurrence and not alone the  tragic sorrows she had suffered.</p>
<p>But Owen Bailey was decidedly on  the mend. Stone had left him a broken down, terror stricken man. Now he seemed  almost if not quite his normal self, better physically, and far more at ease  mentally.</p>
<p>This puzzled Stone, for he knew of  no reason for such a change.</p>
<p>But he was on the job again, and  he had a few new clews, or, at least new directions in which to look for clews.</p>
<p>He fell into his old niche at  Cricky and became, as always a welcome guest.</p>
<p>The servants all liked him, and  the family were glad of his sympathetic presence and interesting chat.</p>
<p>He had the same room he had  occupied before, and when Fuller accompanied him to it, and helped unpack his  things, Stone talked a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are they all, Fuller?&rdquo; he  said, with the pleasant air he always showed the servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upside down, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and  Fuller came nearer and lowered his voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it at all. Mr. Bailey  he&rsquo;s getting gay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s seemingly forgetting  his troubles, and he&rsquo;s more like he used to be long ago. But Miss Lolly, she&rsquo;s  pining&mdash;or worrying herself sick. What&rsquo;s the matter, I dunno, but the child  can&rsquo;t live like she&rsquo;s going on. She eats next to nothing, and she takes no  exercise, and&mdash; I&rsquo;m thinking she cries a whole lot. Can&rsquo;t you help her, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Fleming Stone had ever had a  lingering suspicion of Fuller&rsquo;s implication in the murders it was wiped out  now. Surely, no wrong-doer could be so honestly and earnestly solicitous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll look after her,&rdquo;  Stone said, not wanting to seem to take the matter too seriously. &ldquo;How about  Miss Burt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much as usual, sir. As usual, I&rsquo;d  say. Troublesome, high-handed, hot-headed, general all-round nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not a criminal, Fuller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the beautiful dumbbell? Is  she still with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Agnes? Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call her Miss Agnes,  Fuller. You used to say Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s because&mdash;&rdquo; he  stopped, with a queer expression, then finished, lamely, &ldquo;well, just because.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Stone said, solemnly,  &ldquo;the best of reasons.&rdquo; It was late that evening when Marigold declared she was  in dire need of some fresh air, and begged of Owen that he accompany her for a  walk.</p>
<p>Clearly the man didn&rsquo;t want to go,  but as certainly she was bound that he should, and after a short discussion, he  capitulated, and the two went off for their stroll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always doing that,&rdquo; Lolly  said, as she was left alone with Fleming Stone. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s setting her cap for Dad,  you see, but,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll succeed. Now, Mr. Stone, we  have a few moments and I must talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; and Stone gave her his most  friendly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to begin,&rdquo; she  said, hesitatingly. &ldquo;But,&mdash;well, have you any idea who committed those terrible  murders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; he countered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, but it&rsquo;s so impossible,  so beyond all belief, I can&rsquo;t put it into words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try. Suppose for the sake  of argument we make believe we have confided our suspicions to each other, and  they both point to the same person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you can&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;nor do you. But  it may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it may be. And it would  explain much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would explain everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You see, Mr. Stone, I am a  little psychic&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t spoil it all. Give  over that sort of talk. Keep your feet on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lolly, where did you keep that  veronal or whatever it was you had after your mother died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the medicine closet in my own  bathroom. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then anybody could get at it, if  they were sly about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Do you think any  one did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know some one did. Don&rsquo;t you  know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought some one had been in  there. The things were messed around a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t the one I mean. The  person I have in mind would not leave things messed around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I caught her at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was not answered, for  at that moment Marigold and Owen returned and hastened to the fireside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too cold to walk,&rdquo; Marigold  declared. &ldquo;B-rr-r, it&rsquo;s awful! I got all the fresh air I wanted in a very few  minutes, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Bailey, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  chilled through. I think I&rsquo;ll make a jorum of punch. Do us all good, and serve  as a sort of celebration for Stone&rsquo;s return. Ring the bell, Lolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone felt amazed at the man&rsquo;s  light tone, and merry smile.</p>
<p>He had never known Bailey before  the troubles had begun, and he was uncertain how to take him.</p>
<p>But he made no comment, and merely  kept up his own end of the badinage and chat that followed.</p>
<p>The punch was concocted,  pronounced fine and enjoyed by them all.</p>
<p>Owen partook sparingly, Lolly  merely tasted hers, but Marigold and Stone liked the beverage and refilled  their glasses.</p>
<p>As they went upstairs, all of them  together, Lolly paused a moment in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must talk to you,&rdquo; she  whispered to Stone, &ldquo;make a chance to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, unobtrusively, and went  on to his own room.</p>
<p>Long that night he lay awake.</p>
<p>The punch did not make him sleepy  as it had that other time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was veronal in it&mdash;then,&rdquo; he  told himself, feeling sure of his statement. &ldquo;Lolly could have put it in,  Marigold could, Owen could, any of the servants could. Which gets me exactly  nowhere. Also, Duke or Parke could but I don&rsquo;t think either of them did. Oh,  Lord, if I could just get one sure proof! That&rsquo;s all I ask. But I can&rsquo;t accuse  on no evidence at all! If I did, I&rsquo;d only upset all possibility of final  success. I wonder what that Lolly child has up her sleeve. If she suspects  Marigold &mdash;oh, well, I must find the nest! That&rsquo;s what my old grandmother used  to say when she was bothered with ants or other &lsquo;varmints.&rsquo; Now there is a nest  of those aluminum strips somewhere, and I&rsquo;m going to find it.&rdquo; All of which  goes to prove that Fleming Stone&rsquo;s suspicions were directed toward somebody in  the house and not toward a rank outsider.</p>
<p>He slept well, and pleasantly, and  awoke betimes with no heaviness of the head, though he had it of the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just that one thing,&rdquo; he  mused as he made his toilette, &ldquo;Owen Bailey&rsquo;s taking that drink of whisky from  the decanter in Duke&rsquo;s room! That tears it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went downstairs and stopped,  surprised, on the threshold of the breakfast room.</p>
<p>A huge bunch of hothouse roses,  and a number of tied up parcels were at Lolly&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Bailey and Marigold were in their  chairs, but Lolly had not yet appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her birthday,&rdquo; explained  Bailey. &ldquo;Those are her gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait a minute,&rdquo; Stone  exclaimed, &ldquo;I have something for her, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran quickly upstairs, but he  did not go to his own room at once. Instead, he entered the room that had been  Blandena&rsquo;s, the room Owen now occupied.</p>
<p>The bed covers were thrown back,  and the fresh cold air blew in at the open window.</p>
<p>Quickly Stone took a book from the  well filled book case at one end of the room. It was an old fashioned family  album, filled with pictures of children and grownups in costumes whose styles  were nearly half a century old.</p>
<p>Scrutinizing a few of the  photographs, pinching one or two of them, Stone hurriedly replaced the volume  and hastened downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find I haven&rsquo;t it with me,  after all,&rdquo; he said, in a vexed tone. &ldquo;Just a little token for Lolly. But I  must have left it in New York. I&rsquo;ll give it to her some other time. Hark, here  she comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slow, listless step was heard  on the stairs, and Lolly came into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, seeing the  flowers and parcels. &ldquo;Who remembered it was my birthday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all did, dear,&rdquo; said her  father. &ldquo;Sit here by me and untie your presents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bravely, the girl tried to assume  an air of pleased gayety, but it was hard work.</p>
<p>Stone helped by saying, &ldquo;Lucky  girl, to have so many generous friends. Think of them, Lolly, not of yourself.&rdquo;  She flashed him a faint smile and buried her face in the fragant roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ordered these, Daddy,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;I know you did, &rsquo;cause you know how I love red roses. Oh, here&rsquo;s a gift  from Rosalie! How nice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapidly, and with some help she untied  all the parcels, and looked almost happily on the array of gifts. She was  touched at the attention of friends she had neglected of late, and glad to know  they still loved her.</p>
<p>Her father&rsquo;s gift was a diamond  and platinum wrist watch, which she immediately put on and was enchanted with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something from Isabel  Graham,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard from her in years. Nice of her to remember  my birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It proved to be a silver bracelet,  antique in appearance and evidently of fine silversmith&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; cried Marigold, and  Lolly nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not so nice as your bracelet,  Dad,&rdquo; she said, smiling down at the lovely wrist watch. &ldquo;Still this is rare, I  suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started to push her hand  through the bauble, when Fleming Stone gave a spring from his chair, and  grasped her hands, snatching the antique bracelet from her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; he cried, as she  involuntarily clung to her property, and startled at his stern tone, she  relaxed her hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Stone,&rdquo; said  Bailey, looking wonderingly at the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is, that I&rsquo;ve solved  the problem of the Bailey murders.&rdquo; Stone&rsquo;s voice was low and awed. &ldquo;The matter  is that if Lolly had put on that bracelet, another murder would have been added  to the list. Fuller, go to the telephone,&mdash;thank God we don&rsquo;t need Doctor Fenn  this time! Call Sheriff Hunter and tell him to hurry over here. Tell him to  bring anybody he wants, but to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, Stone! Have you  lost your mind?&rdquo; cried Bailey, all his nervous, alarmed manner returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; Stone  replied, in a tense voice. &ldquo;Lolly, who is this Isabel? Why would she send you a  poison bracelet,&mdash;a bracelet of the kind the Borgias used, a fiendish, deadly  thing! One moment more, and it would have scratched your arm, with a scratch  that meant inevitable, unavoidable death. Who is Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s a friend of mine,&mdash;she  lives in Wyoming. She has sent me silver trinkets before. The Indians out there  make them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians out there didn&rsquo;t make  this,&rdquo; declared Stone, keeping hold of the bracelet in its box, and also the  wrappings of the parcel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; Lolly said, faintly.  &ldquo;Yes, that is Isabel&rsquo;s writing, I know it well. And it is postmarked from her  home town in Wyoming. Oh, Mr. Stone, she never meant to harm me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Stone said, half  absently, it seemed. &ldquo;There they are,&rdquo; he almost shouted, as Hunter and Hale  and three stalwart troopers came to the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your man,&rdquo; Stone said,  solemnly. &ldquo;I accuse Owen Bailey as the murderer of his wife and three children,  and I accuse him of the attempted murder of his remaining child, here before  us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lolly gave a low moan, and for  once turned to the open arms of Marigold rather than to her father.</p>
<p>Bailey looked like a man bereft of  his senses. He was dazed, stunned, but he endeavored to deny the charge. &ldquo;What  does this mean?&rdquo; he blustered.</p>
<p>Stone, who was standing, now, and  with folded arms, gazing down on Bailey&rsquo;s face, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell us what it  means. The jib is up, Owen Bailey. I have known for some time you were the  criminal, but I could get no scrap of proof, no iota of evidence. Now I have  them, now I can denounce you for the fiend incarnate who planned and carried  out, alone and unaided these diabolical murders. Why? You tell them why, Bailey.  I know, but you tell them. I fancy you&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; Bailey said, his  face clearing and gaining a look of what was strangely like pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did plan these killings all  myself. And I&rsquo;ll tell you why!&rdquo; His voice was raised now, his eyes were  blazing, his face was distorted with Satanic glee, and he went on in ringing  tones. &ldquo;Because they deserved it, all of them! Because I worked for them,  slaved for them, gave my whole life to them, my whole mind, soul and body. I  gave all my energy, all my strength, all my brains, everything&mdash;everything I  possessed I gave to them. And all my love, all my affection&mdash;and what did they  do? They scorned me, they made fun of me, they ragged me and mocked me. Even  Lolly there never ceased hectoring me for the way I talked. My wife cared  nothing for me, my sons had no respect, no reverence for me. I am a capable  business man, everybody will tell you that. Because my success in that way was  realized and appreciated. I could go on, doing my work, making my fortune, filling  my position. But at home, where I wanted, I longed to be loved and appreciated,  I received only snubs and mockery. Oh I tried,&mdash;I tried hard to overcome these  habits of the family, and I tried to overcome my sensitiveness to them. But I  couldn&rsquo;t. It grew worse and worse as the years went on. If one of them had  loved me, had helped me, had even respected me, I could have pulled through.  Lolly came the nearest to understanding me, but she had that beastly way of  correcting me until I nearly went crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then came the desire for revenge.  I had tried all I knew how, done all I could and the conditions only grew  worse. So, in my brain the seeds of revenge began to terminate. It was a slow  growth. For eight years I have been planning and plotting my revenge. It had to  include them all for they all had scorned me. Yet during the eight years, many  times I put aside my plan and made further attempt to win the hearts of my own  family. Or, if not the hearts or affection, at least their recognizance of my  right to live! But the result was always the same. My overtures were hooted at,  ridiculed, turned down. I went on, planning. I had I thought looked out for  every emergency. I had plotted the perfect crime,&mdash;series of crimes. I was not  the weakling they deemed me, I was a power, I could wreak a terrible vengeance  on those who had scoffed at me. I think there never was a crime planned more  perfectly than mine, never was a plot laid more carefully, more meticulously as  to dangers and accidents. And then, when it was all completed, I went to  Fleming Stone and asked his help to protect me from impending trouble. How I  laughed in my sleeve to see him worried and anxious over my safety! But I  slipped up somewhere and I see now it was in employing so astute a detective.  If I&rsquo;d chosen more wisely I would have taken a less clever detective under my  roof. How did you tumble to it, Stone? What put you wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many things,&rdquo; Stone returned,  slowly. &ldquo;In fact, Bailey, I have suspected you for a long time, but I could get  no proof. You were clever, clever, too in your unusual and unexpected methods.  Who could have dreamed what you would do to Parke? How you would do for Martha?  And even yet, who knows how you killed Duke? But I know. I know it all, and  here&rsquo;s where you tripped, here&rsquo;s the thing that gave you away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out the old photograph  album, which he had secretly sent for.</p>
<p>Bailey went white at sight of the  old volume and all wondered what it meant.</p>
<p>Stone opened the book, and from  between two of the back to back photographs he drew an aluminum strip, exactly  like the ones found in the death chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the &lsquo;nest&rsquo; of them,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;When I found these I knew I had found our murderer. He stabbed his wife  himself, that first night. No one suspected him, of course. Then he softly went  to the armor on the stairs, secured the steel gauntlets, and killed Martha.  Again, nobody thought of him. Parke&rsquo;s terrible death is too bestial to talk  about. But I know that Bailey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; broke in the  wretched criminal, full of his demented vanity. &ldquo;I just told him to send Wyatt  off and then meet me, in his car, by the lake. The rest was easy. I made up a  plausible story about waiting to go to the edge of the lake, and before he  could get my meaning clear, I pushed the car,&mdash;oh a gentle little push, and whee!  he went straight across the ice, and down&mdash; down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him away!&rdquo; Stone ordered,  seeing the man was almost a maniac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; came the  cracked voice in reply, and a wild shrill burst of demoniac laughter, was the  last they heard of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew it, Lolly,&rdquo; Stone said,  gently, as the noise of the man&rsquo;s foot steps died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, brokenly, &ldquo;but  only lately. You see, I understood Father, and I know something of  psychoanalysis. He never wanted that word mentioned but that was because he  knew he was a victim of the inferiority complex. Oh it isn&rsquo;t nonsense, it&rsquo;s  fearful, dreadful sense. If I had realized sooner, I might have helped him. But  he was so sly, so secretive that none of us dreamed what he was going through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Lolly,&rdquo; Stone said,  gently. &ldquo;You have been saved from his maniacal wickedness, now, prove your  gratitude to Providence, by forgetting all you can of the whole dreadful past.  You can&rsquo;t blot it out entirely but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Isabel didn&rsquo;t send me  that bracelet,&rdquo; she said, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. She sent you  some little gift, and your father opened the parcel and substituted the poison  bracelet for her gift. Thank Heaven I was here! As to Duke, your father was  uncanny in his cleverness. He did not poison the whisky nor the soda water, but  he, after taking a glass full of the soda himself, smeared the inside of the  spigot with hydrocyanic paste. I found it, when I retrieved the broken top of  the spigot from the ashcan where it was thrown. It had lain in the wash basin  with the hot water running, till it was almost cleansed. But I scraped off a  bit of the poison, and the chemists backed me up. Still I couldn&rsquo;t pin it on  anybody until I had a link. The nest of metal strips is the link. Of course, he  put a very little veronal in the punch that first night he made it. That was to  insure our all sleeping soundly, yet not to have really a drugged sleep. Then  he could carry out his brutal murder of Martha uninterrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all the most carefully  prepared and wonderfully carried out crime I ever heard of, and I cannot feel  surprised that I was unable to fix on the murderer. It was planned by a devil  and carried out by a demon. I hope and trust I shall never be confronted with  another such!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing that set me on the  right track, was Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s taking a drink from that decanter, that might  have held poisoned whisky. That was a mistake on his part and it pointed  straight to the truth. For, unless he knew that whisky was not poisoned, he  wouldn&rsquo;t have tasted it. And how could he know that, unless he knew the truth  about the whole poisoning business. And how could he know that, except he was  himself the poisoner. After that I went to New York and set up a definite  search for the two men Bailey said he suspected. They were both dead, had  positively been dead for years. All reports to the contrary were faked. Oh, a  complicated case, but a fiendishly clever one. I found out, too, in the city,  that about six years ago, Baiiey took a course of lessons in graphology. He  became an expert forger, and also by his knowledge of the science of  handwriting, could reproduce the peculiarity of the penmanship of Kennedy and  Dunbar both. His anonymous letters were all written and ready long ago. His aluminum  strips were punched out years ago, too. He prepared his campaign like a  general, and put it over, up to the last ditch. I thank God I saved that  catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was his final objective?&rdquo;  asked Whitney, who was still with them, listening to Stone&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to tell you, but he  meant to get rid of all the family, Lolly included, and then&mdash;marry Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes!&rdquo; Marigold breathed in a  low, tense whisper. &ldquo;Yes. Though he was most careful, I did detect Bailey once  or twice give the girl a fleeting glance that had meaning in it. Also, when I  found her lounging in Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s boudoir, I sensed she had the effect of one  getting used to coming glories. Then when, lately Fuller began to call her Miss  Agnes, I was sure that Bailey had given orders to that effect. Especially as  Fuller wouldn&rsquo;t tell me why he did it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I make no excuses for the  awful work of Owen Bailey. I plead his cause not at all. But I do say he tried  at first. He saved Parke&rsquo;s life twice at the risk of his own. He rescued Duke  from the clutches of a confidence man and from blackmail. He kept Lolly from an  episode that would have been her ruin. He did give his life his work his love  to his family and they did reject it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us, as they sometimes say,  give the devil his due, though we can never forget that he was a devil.&rdquo;</p>
