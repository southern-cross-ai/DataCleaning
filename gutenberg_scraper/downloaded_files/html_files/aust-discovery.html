<h2>Australian Discovery</h2>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="5" color="#800000">&quot;1606
and all that&quot; - early maritime contact with
Australia</font></strong>
</p>

<p align="center">Much of the information on this page was provided
by Peter Reynders of <a href="http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au/"
target="_blank"><font color="#008000">Australia on the
Map.</font></a> AOTM is the history division of the Australasian
Hydrographic Society. Its aim is to help Australians to know their
early Maritime Contact History better.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width="10%">
</td>
<td width="80%">There have been many theories about who, from the
outside world, first <i>discovered</i> Australia. In any case,
aborigines had already been there for tens of thousand of years
before that <i>discovery</i>. Collingridge, Major and Stevens are
three writers who propose theories regarding the first discovery
and ebooks of their accounts can be accessed from the <a href=
"#books">list of books and Articles</a>, further down this page.

<p>The first <i>authenticated</i> landing on Australian soil
occurred in March 1606 when <a href="/pages/jansz.html" target=
"_blank">Willem Janszoon</a> (a.k.a. Willem Jansz--refer to this
<a href="/dutch-note.html"><sup>note</sup></a> for an explanation
of correct usage regarding Dutch surnames) and Jan Lodewijkszoon
van Rosingeyn, on board the Duyfken, charted about 300 km of the
west coast of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. An article in the
September 2005 Newsletter of <i>Australian National Placenames
Survey</i> states that &quot;The <a href=
"/pages/pennefather.html">Pennefather River</a>--located at 12� 14'
South and 141� 43' East on western Cape York Peninsula,
Queensland--is one of the most significant historical sites in
Australia. It is the place where, in 1606, the Indigenous people of
the Australian continent probably first sighted Europeans when the
Dutch jacht (or yacht) <i>Duyfken</i>, commanded by Willem
Janszoon, made landfall after a voyage from the Dutch East Indies
(now Indonesia). The river is 11 kilometres long and up to about 2
kilometres wide. Its headwaters are fed by Fish Creek in the north
and Bumungu Creek in the south. The current north side land tenure
is Deed of Grant in Trust managed by Aboriginal trustees appointed
by the Queensland Government and assisted by the Mapoon Aboriginal
Shire Council. The south side land tenure is Deed of Grant in Trust
managed by the Napranum Aboriginal Shire Council.&quot; More
information about the voyage of the <i>Duyfken</i> is given in the
article.</p>

<p><b>In 2006 Australians celebrated the 400th anniversary of the
event.</b>
</p>

<p>Percival Serle in his <a href="/ebooks15/1500721h.html" target=
"_blank">Dictionary of Australian Biography</a> has this to say
about Janszoon and his contact with the coast of Australia:
[Janszoon] &quot;was born possibly about 1570, probably at
Amsterdam, Holland [The Netherlands, to be correct. ed.]. Nothing
is known of his early life, and he is first heard of in 1598 as a
mate on the Hollandia, one of the vessels in the second Dutch fleet
to voyage to the East Indies. He returned to Holland, and on 21
December 1599, having been promoted to the position of first mate,
sailed again for the Indies. He made other voyages, but when he
left Holland in December 1603 in command of the Duyfken, as part of
a large fleet, the understanding was that this vessel was to remain
in the east for three years, and endeavour to find new sources of
trade. On 18 November 1605 Jansz[oon] left Bantam for Banda. From
Banda an east-south-east course was taken to the Kei group, thence
to Aru and the coast of New Guinea at De Jong's Point. Turning
south the Gulf of Carpentaria was entered and the Australian coast
was discovered at the mouth of the Pennefather River, on the Cape
York peninsula, probably in March 1606. The course continued to
latitude 13.59 when the Duyfken began her return journey. A visit
was made to Prince of Wales Island, the New Guinea coast was again
approached, and then a turn was made and Banda was reached in May
1606. For the first time some 200 miles of the Australian coastline
had been charted, though Jansz[oon] was not aware it was not part
of New Guinea.&quot;</p>

<p>There were many other contacts from that time until <a href=
"/pages/cook.html" target="_blank"><font color="#008000">James
Cook</font></a> sailed up the east coast in 1770. These events are
detailed in the <a href="#landing-list">Landing List</a> set out
below. An important &quot;player&quot; in the events set out in the
Landing List was the United East-Indies Company, the <i>Verenigde
Oostindische Compagnie</i> (VOC). Peter Reynders has written an
<a href="/VOC.html">article</a> about the VOC which details the
reasons for its demise.</p></td>
