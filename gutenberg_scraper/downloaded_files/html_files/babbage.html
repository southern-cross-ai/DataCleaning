<p>B. Herschel Babbage was the eldest son of the well-known inventor of the calculating
  machine. He had been educated as an engineer, and for a considerable time had
  followed his profession in Europe. He had been engaged on several main lines
  in England, and had worked in conjunction with the celebrated Brunel. He had
  also been commissioned by the Government of Piedmont to report on a line across
  the Alps by way of Mount Cenis. He had remained in Italy some years until his
  work was interrupted by the revolution. He had returned to England, and had
  subsequently come to South Australia in 1851, in the ship Hydaspes.</p>
<p>In 1851, the Colonial Secretary Earl Grey, assigned Babbage to perform a geological
  and mineralogical survey of the colony of South Australia requested by the colony's
  government and Babbage arrived in South Australia in November. Over the next
  few years worked on a number of government projects, first setting up the Government
  Gold Assay Office in Victoria Square.</p>
<p>Babbage began his exploration of South Australia in 1856 when sent to search
  for gold up to the Flinders Ranges, during which time he discovered the MacDonnell
  River, Blanchewater and Mount Hopeful (renamed Mount Babbage after him in 1857
  by George Goyder). Babbage also disproved the notion that Lake Torrens was a
  single horseshoe-shaped lake or inland sea, ascertaining a number of gaps in
  the lake, which were later traversed by other explorers such as Augustus Gregory
  and Peter Warburton.</p>
<p>In 1858 Babbage led an expedition to explore the north of the colony between
  Lake Torrens and Lake Gairdner. In June, near Pernatty Creek, he discovered
  the remains of William Coulthard of Angas Park, Nuriootpa, who had died of thirst
  around 10 March 1858 and in October he discovered Emerald Springs.</p>
<p>Babbage also discovered that Lake Eyre (sighted by Edward John Eyre in 1840)
  actually consisted of a large northern and a smaller southern lake. A peninsula
  on Lake Eyre North was named Babbage Peninsula in 1963.</p>
<p>As Babbage continued his explorations, sometimes accompanied by his son, Charles
  Whitmore Babbage, the government grew tired of his slow, methodical pace, and
  the Commissioner of Crown Lands, Francis Dutton, responded to the controversy
  by replacing him with Peter Warburton. Babbage complained of unfair treatment
  and petitioned the House of Assembly to conduct a parliamentary inquiry into
  the issue.</p>
<p>His last years were spent at his home on South Road, St Mary's, where he had
  an excellent vineyard and was a keen winemaker.</p>
