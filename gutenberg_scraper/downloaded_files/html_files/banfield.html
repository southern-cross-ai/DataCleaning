<p><b>From the Introduction to &quot;Last Leaves from Dunk
Island&quot; by A. H. Chisholm. The Introduction is not included in our copy of the ebook
as it is still copyright.</b>
</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, 1923, the small steamer <i>Innisfail</i> was
passing between Dunk Island and the coast of northern Queensland,
when the captain noticed a figure waving from the island beach.
Interpreting the signal as a greeting, he merely waved a response.
Then, as the vessel proceeded, the figure on the beach collapsed.
At once the <i>Innisfail</i> was stopped and a party went to
investigate.</p>

<p>It was in this manner that the world learned of the death of E.
J. Banfield, self-styled &quot;Beachcomber&quot; of Dunk Island,
the most renowned literary man of his kind in Australian history,
and, perhaps, the most striking naturalist-recluse of modern times.
The signaller on the beach was Mrs. Banfield, who had been alone
with her dead for three days. So ended a tropic idyll of
twenty-five years' duration.</p>

<p>The romance of Dunk Island, its genesis and development, have
been revealed, broadly, in the books of the Beachcomber. How the
couple grew to affinity with their insular environment; how they
befriended the blacks and grieved to part with them when the
Government established compulsory reservations elsewhere; how they
filled what far-off sceptics believed to be blank spaces of time;
how they narrowly escaped the vengeance of the jealous sea; how
they assisted science in respect of the life of the Isle and
adjacent seas; how they cherished flora and fauna even to their own
inconvenience (witness the abandonment of bee-keeping rather than
destroy bee-eating birds); how, in short, they lived their
sequestered life and made it fruitful, yet did not despise the
arrogant world without--these things have been told by the modern
Crusoe himself in <i>Confessions of a Beachcomber</i> (1908), <i>My
Tropic Isle</i> (1911), and <i>Tropic Days</i> (1918). And now,
with the appearance of this posthumous book, it is meet to consider
the career of this extraordinary man, to answer a few questions
maybe, [&quot;He kept his own personality rigidly In the
background.&quot;--Obituary notice In London <i>Times</i>.] and
certainly to correct some erroneous impressions.</p>

<p>Edmund James Banfield was born at Liverpool (England) on the 4th
of September, 1852, and was brought while a boy to Australia by his
father, who settled at Ararat, in Victoria. Adopting journalism as
a profession, he worked on various newspapers in the three eastern
colonies, and in 1882 went to northern Queensland, where he joined
the staff of the <i>Townsville Daily Bulletin.</i> For fifteen
years Banfield remained with that newspaper--years of arduous
labour, broken only by a visit to England.</p>

<p>That visit (1884) was marked by the removal of an injured eye
which had threatened serious trouble. It was marked also by a
pamphlet of some seventeen thousand words, descriptive of &quot;The
Torres Strait Route from Queensland to England.&quot; Most of all,
it was made memorable by the appearance on the scene of the future
Mrs. Banfield. Their parents were old friends; the young people met
when Banfield visited Liverpool, and they were married at
Townsville in 1886. &quot;As I look back,&quot; wrote Robert Louis
Stevenson, &quot;I think my marriage was the best move I ever made
in my life. Not only would I do it again; I cannot conceive the
idea of doing otherwise.&quot; These words, if not spoken or
written, were <i>lived</i> by the R.L.S. of Dunk Island. Indeed, it
is scarcely conceivable that his books would ever have been
written--or. indeed, that his life would have become so
fragrant--without the companionship of the cultured, courageous,
merry little woman who braved isolation on a lonely island for a
quartercentury.</p>

<p>And after Mrs. Banfield one thinks of Essie, most devoted of
retainers. Joining the Banfields in Townsville in 1889, this little
Irishwoman was with them until the departure for the Isle in 1897;
in 1904 she became a member of the &quot;settled community of
three,&quot; and remained there (save for brief visits to
Townsville) until after the passing of the Beachcomber. Sorrowfully
enough, she was away on holiday when he died.</p>

<p>Here it has to be said, that although the idyll of Dunk Island
had its beginning in a search for health, Banfield was not, as has
been widely supposed, a sufferer from phthisis. That break-down of
'97 was not organic; it was merely due to the weariness, the fever
and the fret of crowded years of newspaper work on the part of a
man compact of nervous energy. By reason of this break-down,
sanctuary became essential. Thereafter, there were few moments of
illness in the days of the sunburned, bright-eyed Beachcomber, and
doubtless he would have been living to-day had surgical aid been
available. Always his mentality, too, was sweetly sane--kept so by
good, if limited, comradeship and by his temperamental energies and
enthusiasms.</p>

<p>Dunk Island lies in the Pacific, a hundred and ten miles north
of Townsville, about sixty miles south of Cairns, and two and a
half miles off the coast of Queensland. It is merely a range of
hills running almost parallel with the main coast range; high and
bluff at the northern extremity, broad and bulging in the waist,
and falling away to a somewhat commonplace ending--low, narrow,
comparatively barren--in the south, with a central spur pointing
towards the south-west. Its area is about three and a half square
miles, the greatest length is three miles, and the coastline
measures between ten and twelve miles.</p>

<p>&quot;Steep, forest-clad declivities, baby precipices of grey
granite aureoled with orchids, tangled jungle from the splashline
of the Pacific to the crest of the range; fantastic rocks, linked
and corniced and skirted with oyster-masses; grey-fronded palms
springing from clefts among austere boulders; grassy slopes, with
groups of pandanus palms in steep hollows; and again forest and
jumbles of rock, characterize the weather side. On the sheltered
western aspect the less steep hills, wrapped in a patched but
rentless mantle of leafage, rest upon a level plateau of about
three hundred acres.</p>

<p>&quot;This plateau has an elevation of from ten to eighty feet
above a sandy, low-lying flat, drawn out into a western-pointing
spit by the never-ceasing action of the sea under alternating
breezes from S.E. to N.E. The conformation of this plateau and its
relation to the flat are certainly to be included among the
distinguishing features of the island.&quot; [&quot;Dunk Island;
Its General Characteristics,&quot; by E. J. Banfield, In the
<i>Proceedings</i> of the Geographical Society of Queensland, vol.
xxiii, 1908.]</p>

<p>It was from this plateau that the Banfieldian bungalow--a
charming bit of England transplanted to the tropics--smiled out at
vessels steaming or sailing through the Hinchinbrook Passage.</p>

<p>Why did Banfield drop the native name of Coonanglebah in favour
of Dunk? An American writer raised this point in a commemorative
notice. It is a trifle puzzling. Admitting that the native name is
&quot;older and of sweeter sound than that prescribed by
Cook,&quot; Banfield considered <i>Dunk</i> &quot;an apt
combination of geography and biography,&quot; inasmuch as in the
christening Captain Cook immortalized his &quot;noble patron&quot;
the Earl of Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty in his day, whose
family name was believed to be George Montagu Dunk. [CONFESSIONS OF
A BEACHCOMBER, p.24.] On this point, however, the Beachcomber
erred. The name of the Isle did not commemorate the Earl of
Sandwich; it was that of Lord Halifax, a Cabinet Minister from 1757
to 1765, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for two years of that time, and
First Lord of the Admiralty for four months in 1762. He was born a
Montagu, but in 1741 married a Kentish heiress and took her name,
Dunk. This aside, the supposition is that the name &quot;Dunk&quot;
was retained, firstly, in deference to the illustrious memory of
Cook; secondly, because of its old English flavour; and, thirdly,
as a concession to brevity. For the rest, the Beachcomber
interfered but slightly with native nomenclature.</p>

<p>Whatever the general conception as between Dunk and
Coonanglebah, the English name, backed, of course, by the amiable
&quot;confessions&quot; of the amateur Beachcomber, has been
sufficiently arresting to the popular imagination. Herman
Melville's Marquesas were too far off, wrapped in the mists of
Romance. Dunk Island and its neighbours--sweet-sounding Timana,
Bedarra, and the rest--were hard by Australia, moderately easy of
access, and offering comparatively little in the way of serious
hazards. &quot;Almost it makes one wish to go a-Dunking!&quot;
cried a staid reviewer of the first Banfield book. How that cry
echoed through the world is a story yet to be told. This is not the
place to write in detail of those victims of illusion who came from
Britain--some unheralded and unannounced, and none by
invitation--to join Banfield on his tropic Isle or to strive to
follow his example in mingling Reality and Romance.</p>

<p>Did they succeed? Not one. The hospitality of Dunk Island was
equal, temporarily, to the tax upon it, but intangible presences of
the other islands were not so courteous; those untamed genii of the
tropics weighed their guests in the balance, found the necessary
blending of philosophy and energy wanting, and flung them
aside.</p>

<p>It may be, as Banfield believed, that Dunk Island stood in a
category of its own. &quot;This delicious Isle,&quot; he cried,
after fifteen years of the lonely life, &quot;this unkempt,
unrestrained garden where the centuries gaze upon perpetual summer!
Small it is and of varied charms--set in the fountain of a
time-defying youth . . . . it typifies all that is tranquil, quiet,
easeful, dreamlike, for it is the Isle of Dreams.&quot; Certainly,
Dunk is the fairest and the best of the Family group. Decidedly,
too, it is more endearing, if only on the score of compactness,
than stern Hinchinbrook--the massive island a few miles to the
south, which Captain Cook, passing on the seaward side, believed to
be a mountain on the mainland. Withal, even if we concede little
Dunk to be first among the hundreds of islands, great and small,
that festoon the fifteen hundred miles of water between the Great
Barrier Reef and the coast of Queensland, we must still allow for
the human factor.</p>

<p>For all its charm, Dunk Island would have broken most men or
wrapped them in the mantle of the misanthrope. With Banfield it did
something very different. It stabilized the feeble frame and
mercurial temperament; it crystallized and yet extended his
interests and energies; and while withholding him from the sorry
scheme of things known as civilization, it gave him a definite and
worthy part in the work of the world. But after all, the strength
of the Isle was the strength of the Man. A happy balance!</p>

<p>The Beachcomber was very far from being self centred. He was,
quite literally, the guide, philosopher and friend of the
neighbourhood, from Maria Creek down the long coastline to
Cardwell. jealous to passion of the rights and welfare of his
friends in isolation--men, birds, dugongs, what-not--he would rush
to the relief at even a whisper of need. Cherishing the fair fame
of the Isle with filial devotion, he was broadly hospitable to
every visitor, from Governors and men of science to sailors on
survey-ships and casual collectors of oysters. Cherishing, too,
little less personally, the repute of the sparsely-settled
north-east of Australia as &quot;the most remarkable, and
beautiful, and essential part of the Commonwealth,&quot; he was apt
to wax angry with its detractors--ready, as his writings plainly
show, to defend its good name in spite of occasional harsh moods of
the tropic goddess.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the Beachcomber was compact of goodwill. &quot;With
all goodwill!&quot; he almost shouted in his letters. &quot;With
all goodwill!&quot; echoed his attitude to the world.</p>

<p>On one occasion, hearing shots on Purtaboi, an isle in Brammo
Bay, he motored across, to find a fresh-faced English naval officer
revelling in shooting nutmeg pigeons. The Beachcomber rated the lad
soundly, and the youngster, resenting the direct rebuke, replied in
kind. Banfield left, vowing vengeance in the form of legal
proceedings. This bird-killing was a heinous offence. Later, a boat
put off from the warship, and the captain and the delinquent came
ashore. The captain introduced himself, regretting that one of his
officers should have caused Mr. Banfield so much annoyance. Upon
this the kindly Islander could not restrain himself. He rushed in
with:</p>

<p>&quot;Now, really, Captain, I'm delighted to see you and your
officer. It--it is remarkable that I have never heard of the
incident you mention. No, really I haven't--or if I have, most
surely have I forgotten all about it. I'm so glad to see you both.
Now, come in., and we will give you some tea with jersey milk. It
is so kind of you fellows to come across to see me.&quot;</p>

<p>Was ever isolation more wholesome? Here were a man and woman who
dwelt apart from their kin through no sense of misanthropy and no
desire for self-assertion, [Ten years of island life had been
experienced before the notion of writing a book took form, and then
only through the stimulus of Sir Walter Strickland, a casual
visitor to the Isle.] who, while cordial in their welcome of
occasional fellows, were still content if left to themselves, and
who, insofar as climate and situation permitted, maintained their
birthright of refinement throughout the whole of that remarkable
quarter-century.</p>

<p>In 1901 Dunk Island was deserted for nine months while its
Prospero met the demands of his forsaken dukedom; that is, he
returned to Townsville to fill the place of a journalistic friend
who was making a trip abroad. Apart from this &quot;lapse,&quot;
the couple were absent from the Lonely Isle perhaps half a dozen
times in twenty-five years, and then only once did they go farther
than Townsville. The exception was a three-months' excursion to New
South Wales and Victoria in 1911, planned chiefly as a visit to
relatives.</p>

<p>Stevenson, away in Samoa, was drawn to Sydney much more often
than was Banfield, who lived on the Australian coastline. But
R.L.S. did not, and never would have, become so affiliated with
Samoa as E.J.B. did with Coonanglebah . Without especially drawing
a parallel between the island lives of the two writers, one finds
it most evident in the richness of devotion awarded each by his
self-sacrificing partner. Fanny Stevenson's wealth of companionship
and stimulus did not exceed that of Bertha Banfield.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Banfield might still have been the Beachcomber,
but scarcely the one whose memory we cherish. Not that he would
ever have become a lotus-eater. Never was a tropic islander more
charged with vitality. It was nervous energy that wrecked and
brought him to Dunk Island in the beginning; it was this, largely,
that sustained him in isolation. When he was past seventy it was a
rare thing to see Banfield really resting, an unknown thing to see
him idle. What struck Mr. H. J. Massingham, when he belatedly
discovered Banfield's books in 1923, was his &quot;extraordinary
industry.&quot; A shrewd assessment, this, and one that will be
endorsed by all who have been &quot;a-Dunking.&quot; Some of us had
dreamed of the Isle as a kind of insular Arden, with Banfield as
its banished Duke. That he fitted the part to the extent of being
&quot;exempt from public haunt&quot; and finding good in everything
is true enough; but he was far from being an easygoing philosopher.
His briskness, indeed, was a little bewildering in the light of
preconceived notions. One expected to loiter, perhaps to laze, in
the company of a kin-spirit who had ample time to stand and stare;
but one found that to laze on Dunk Island meant to do so alone.</p>

<p>The Beachcomber's step was brisk, his speech rapid (at times
vehement), his enthusiasms as extensive and keen as those of any
boy. Yet it is probable that he himself would have been the last to
admit energy as a dominating trait. (Has he not described himself
as a sedate man, who refused to be flurried by his own
wheelbarrow?) On returning to the Isle from his trip of 1911, he
poured out a series of articles on &quot;Southern Scenes
Re-visited,&quot; and in one of these he marvelled at &quot;The Age
of Hurry,&quot; confessing, incidentally, that until then he had
&quot;never seen any form of self-propelled vehicle other than a
sedate road-roller.&quot; Just previous to this, the sight of
&quot;a practical spring-cart, drawn by a real horse at a
trot,&quot; had amazed the Beachcomber as he gazed across the
channel to the wild mainland of northern Queensland. And in the
year of grace 1924,--how the world wags!--Mrs. Banfield was
startled by the sight of a motor-car on that same beach!</p>

<p>As to the influence of the Banfieldian activity on his nature
studies, it is a little doubtful whether he became an excellent
observer in spite of, or because of, this trait. Certainly his
taste for natural history was unforced and sincere. He was,
perhaps, a combination of Gilbert White and Thoreau, spiced and
quickened by the sun of the tropics; so that he wrote engagingly of
the wonder and beauty of his demesne--with an occasional excursion
(as in <i>Tropic Days</i>) into the realm of Imagination--and
accumulated a mass of valuable observations, including several
discoveries new to science.</p>

<p>In sooth, Banfield worked at agriculture and domestic and
semi-public duties as diligently as did Thoreau--was he not his own
magistrate, postman, architect, carpenter, painter, boatbuilder,
goatherd, and the rest?--and yet contrived to improve upon the
American recluse by being frankly human, and by keeping more or
less directly in touch with the fretful world. He had his books,
one or two newspapers (which Thoreau despised) and his English and
Australian periodicals. For a <i>quid pro quo</i>, he wrote
continually and amiably for all the world to read. Much of this
work was in the form of fugitive articles, and, not being adaptable
to book-form, will not be reprinted. On the whole, though, the
quality was commensurate with the quantity; and the quantity was
considerable.</p>

<p>It is to be noted, moreover, that a teeming brain triumphed over
a hand that did not take kindly to the pen. The Beachcomber's
scribble, indeed, was rather worse than that of most hurried
writers; in the days before the rattle of a typewriter rivalled the
&quot;clickity-clacking&quot; of the scrub-fowls on the Isle, that
handwriting gave Townsville compositors some hard thinking. Thus, I
find an old article written by &quot;Rob Krusoe&quot; (an early
penname) in which occurs the queer phrase &quot;Queen's jubilee
politics.&quot; The Beachcomber's emendation shows that he wrote
&quot;Queer jumble, politics !&quot;</p>

<p>That phrase, &quot;Queer jumble,&quot; might be applied, in all
goodwill, to some of Banfield's manuscript after he had been busy
revising. One of his &quot;Rural Homilies,&quot; clipped from the
<i>Townsville Bulletin</i>--from which journal much of the material
in the present book has been taken--would be roughly gummed to a
piece of copypaper, after which the article would be pen-scored
almost out of its original state. Assuredly, the volatile
Beachcomber was the keenest critic of his own work, though not
necessarily the best judge of it. Had he been spared to prepare
this volume, its phraseology would doubtless have been further
amended (probably not to any real purpose), and certain chapters,
quite worthy in themselves, might have been set aside. The title,
obviously, is not of his choosing. But the form of the work is
largely of the author's making; an unfinished scrap of a preface,
written while the great seastorm still was beating in his mind,
indicates that he regarded the story of the tempest of 1918 as
worthy of chief place in any further book he might prepare.</p>

<p>The staggering &quot;blow&quot; was not only the most striking
event in the twenty-five years of Banfield's rule on Dunk Island;
it was, as he suspected, &quot;the event of a century.&quot; This
has been attested recently by Mr. Charles Hedley, the eminent
conchologist, who ascribes to that cyclone the destruction of
certain coral-reefs some three hundred years old. Banfield had
already secured evidence in point by noting the destruction of a
patch of <i>Calophyllum</i> trees, remarked on by the explorer
Dalrymple in 1873.</p>

<p>But it was not the spectacular effects of the great storm that
kept it fresh in the Beachcomber's recollection. Like the
gentle-hearted Miranda, he grieved for its effects on humanity--for
the dire loss of life among both whites and blacks at the
Aboriginal Settlement on the mainland opposite. Despite his own
plight, Banfield was first to the rescue of that stricken
community, and his was the message that brought the tragedy under
official notice.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>Now are presented the last leaves gathered by this great-hearted
man, this strong, sane, public spirit in a cloistered setting, this
unpretentious writer of unpretentious homilies, this Beloved
Vagabond whose mental bent, self-confessed, &quot;enabled him to
take but a superficial view of most of the large, heavy and
unimportant aspects of life, but who found light in things and
subjects homely and casual; who perhaps had queer views on the
pursuit of happiness, and who, above all, had an inordinate passion
f or freedom and fresh air.&quot;</p>

<p>Now the Beachcomber, like his Scottish prototype, &quot;lies
where he longed to be.&quot; The sailors of the <i>Innisfail</i>
made a coffin; the captain read the burial service; and they buried
him in his own tropic garden--looking over the gem-like isle of
Purtaboi, in Brammo, the Bay of Butterflies, away to where
Bellenden Ker and the coastal ranges keep eternal vigil. Beside
that grave the blue-and-yellow sunbirds of his delight flit among
scarlet hibiscus flowers; the swamp pheasants that he knew more
intimately than any ornithologist, boom in the rioting grasses; and
the scrub-fowls, for which he cared so closely, clatter inquiringly
through the watches of the tropic night. A cairn has been raised
above the grave, and on it are words of Thoreau, words which the
Beachcomber both loved and lived: &quot;If a man does not keep pace
with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different
drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears.&quot;</p>
