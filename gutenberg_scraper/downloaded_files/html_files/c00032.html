    The Golden Slipper</b></h2>
  <p>"She's  here! I thought she would be. She's one of the three young ladies you see in  the right-hand box near the proscenium."</p>
  <p>The  gentleman thus addressed&mdash;a man of middle age and a member of the most exclusive  clubs&mdash;turned his opera glass toward the spot designated, and in some  astonishment retorted:</p>
  <p>"She?  Why those are the Misses Pratt and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Miss  Violet Strange; no other."</p>
  <p>"And  do you mean to say&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  do&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"That  yon silly little chit, whose father I know, whose fortune I know, who is seen  everywhere, and who is called one of the season's belles is an agent of yours;  a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"No  names here, please. You want a mystery solved. It is not a matter for the  police&mdash;that is, as yet,&mdash;and so you come to me, and when I ask for the facts, I  find that women and only women are involved, and that these women are not only  young but one and all of the highest society. Is it a man's work to go to the  bottom of a combination like this? No. Sex against sex, and, if possible, youth  against youth. Happily, I know such a person&mdash;a girl of gifts and  extraordinarily well placed for the purpose. Why she uses her talents in this  direction&mdash;why, with means enough to play the part natural to her as a  successful debutante, she consents to occupy herself with social and other  mysteries, you must ask her, not me. Enough that I promise you her aid if you  want it. That is, if you can interest her. She will not work otherwise."</p>
  <p>Mr.  Driscoll again raised his opera glass.</p>
  <p>"But  it's a comedy face," he commented. "It's hard to associate intellectuality with  such quaintness of expression. Are you sure of her discretion?"</p>
  <p>"Whom  is she with?"</p>
  <p>"Abner  Pratt, his wife, and daughters."</p>
  <p>"Is  he a man to entrust his affairs unadvisedly?"</p>
  <p>"Abner  Pratt! Do you mean to say that she is anything more to him than his daughters'  guest?"</p>
  <p>"Judge.  You see how merry they are. They were in deep trouble yesterday. You are  witness to a celebration."</p>
  <p>"And  she?"</p>
  <p>"Don't  you observe how they are loading her with attentions? She's too young to rouse  such interest in a family of notably unsympathetic temperament for any other  reason than that of gratitude."</p>
  <p>"It's  hard to believe. But if what you hint is true, secure me an opportunity at once  of talking to this youthful marvel. My affair is serious. The dinner I have  mentioned comes off in three days and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  know. I recognize your need; but I think you had better enter Mr. Pratt's box  without my intervention. Miss Strange's value to us will be impaired the moment  her connection with us is discovered."</p>
  <p>"Ah,  there's Ruthven! He will take me to Mr. Pratt's box," remarked Driscoll as the  curtain fell on the second act. "Any suggestions before I go?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  and an important one. When you make your bow, touch your left shoulder with  your right hand. It is a signal. She may respond to it; but if she does not, do  not be discouraged. One of her idiosyncrasies is a theoretical dislike of her  work. But once she gets interested, nothing will hold her back. That's all,  except this. In no event give away her secret. That's part of the compact, you  remember."</p>
  <p>Driscoll  nodded and left his seat for Ruthven's box. When the curtain rose for the third  time he could be seen sitting with the Misses Pratt and their vivacious young  friend. A widower and still on the right side of fifty, his presence there did  not pass unnoted, and curiosity was rife among certain onlookers as to which of  the twin belles was responsible for this change in his well-known habits.  Unfortunately, no opportunity was given him for showing. Other and younger men  had followed his lead into the box, and they saw him forced upon the good  graces of the fascinating but inconsequent Miss Strange whose rapid fire of  talk he was hardly of a temperament to appreciate.</p>
  <p>Did  he appear dissatisfied? Yes; but only one person in the opera house knew why.  Miss Strange had shown no comprehension of or sympathy with his errand. Though  she chatted amiably enough between duets and trios, she gave him no opportunity  to express his wishes though she knew them well enough, owing to the signal he  had given her.</p>
  <p>This  might be in character but it hardly suited his views; and, being a man of  resolution, he took advantage of an absorbing minute on the stage to lean  forward and whisper in her ear:</p>
  <p>"It's  my daughter for whom I request your services; as fine a girl as any in this  house. Give me a hearing. You certainly can manage it."</p>
  <p>She  was a small, slight woman whose naturally quaint appearance was accentuated by  the extreme simplicity of her attire. In the tier upon tier of boxes rising  before his eyes, no other personality could vie with hers in strangeness, or in  the illusive quality of her ever-changing expression. She was vivacity  incarnate and, to the ordinary observer, light as thistledown in fibre and in  feeling. But not to all. To those who watched her long, there came moments&mdash;say  when the music rose to heights of greatness&mdash;when the mouth so given over to  laughter took on curves of the rarest sensibility, and a woman's lofty soul  shone through her odd, bewildering features.</p>
  <p>Driscoll  had noted this, and consequently awaited her reply in secret hope.</p>
  <p>It  came in the form of a question and only after an instant's display of  displeasure or possibly of pure nervous irritability.</p>
  <p>"What  has she done?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing.  But slander is in the air, and any day it may ripen into public accusation."</p>
  <p>"Accusation  of what?" Her tone was almost pettish.</p>
  <p>"Of&mdash;of  theft," he murmured. "On a great scale," he emphasized, as the music rose to a  crash.</p>
  <p>"Jewels?"</p>
  <p>"Inestimable  ones. They are always returned by somebody. People say, by me."</p>
  <p>"Ah!"  The little lady's hands grew steady,&mdash;they had been fluttering all over her lap.  "I will see you to-morrow morning at my father's house," she presently  observed; and turned her full attention to the stage.</p>
  <p>Some  three days after this Mr. Driscoll opened his house on the Hudson to notable  guests. He had not desired the publicity of such an event, nor the opportunity  it gave for an increase of the scandal secretly in circulation against his  daughter. But the Ambassador and his wife were foreign and any evasion of the  promised hospitality would be sure to be misunderstood; so the scheme was  carried forward though with less eclat than possibly was expected.</p>
  <p>Among  the lesser guests, who were mostly young and well acquainted with the house and  its hospitality, there was one unique figure,&mdash;that of the lively Miss Strange,  who, if personally unknown to Miss Driscoll, was so gifted with the qualities  which tell on an occasion of this kind, that the stately young hostess hailed  her presence with very obvious gratitude.</p>
  <p>The  manner of their first meeting was singular, and of great interest to one of  them at least. Miss Strange had come in an automobile and had been shown her  room; but there was nobody to accompany her down-stairs afterward, and, finding  herself alone in the great hall, she naturally moved toward the library, the  door of which stood ajar. She had pushed this door half open before she noticed  that the room was already occupied. As a consequence, she was made the  unexpected observer of a beautiful picture of youth and love.</p>
  <p>A  young man and a young woman were standing together in the glow of a blazing  wood-fire. No word was to be heard, but in their faces, eloquent with passion,  there shone something so deep and true that the chance intruder hesitated on  the threshold, eager to lay this picture away in her mind with the other lovely  and tragic memories now fast accumulating there. Then she drew back, and  readvancing with a less noiseless foot, came into the full presence of Captain  Holliday drawn up in all the pride of his military rank beside Alicia, the  accomplished daughter of the house, who, if under a shadow as many whispered,  wore that shadow as some women wear a crown.</p>
  <p>Miss  Strange was struck with admiration, and turned upon them the brightest facet of  her vivacious nature all the time she was saying to herself: "Does she know why  I am here? Or does she look upon me only as an additional guest foisted upon  her by a thoughtless parent?"</p>
  <p>There  was nothing in the manner of her cordial but composed young hostess to show,  and Miss Strange, with but one thought in mind since she had caught the light  of feeling on the two faces confronting her, took the first opportunity that  offered of running over the facts given her by Mr. Driscoll, to see if any  reconcilement were possible between them and an innocence in which she must  henceforth believe.</p>
  <p>They  were certainly of a most damaging nature.</p>
  <p>Miss  Driscoll and four other young ladies of her own station in life had formed  themselves, some two years before, into a coterie of five, called The  Inseparables. They lunched together, rode together, visited together. So close  was the bond and their mutual dependence so evident, that it came to be the  custom to invite the whole five whenever the size of the function warranted it.  In fact, it was far from an uncommon occurrence to see them grouped at  receptions or following one another down the aisles of churches or through the  mazes of the dance at balls or assemblies. And no one demurred at this, for  they were all handsome and attractive girls, till it began to be noticed that,  coincident with their presence, some article of value was found missing from  the dressing-room or from the tables where wedding gifts were displayed.  Nothing was safe where they went, and though, in the course of time, each  article found its way back to its owner in a manner as mysterious as its previous  abstraction, the scandal grew and, whether with good reason or bad, finally  settled about the person of Miss Driscoll, who was the showiest, least  pecuniarily tempted, and most dignified in manner and speech of them all.</p>
  <p>Some  instances had been given by way of further enlightenment. This is one: A  theatre party was in progress. There were twelve in the party, five of whom  were the Inseparables. In the course of the last act, another lady&mdash;in fact,  their chaperon&mdash;missed her handkerchief, an almost priceless bit of lace.  Positive that she had brought it with her into the box, she caused a careful  search, but without the least success. Recalling certain whispers she had  heard, she noted which of the five girls were with her in the box. They were  Miss Driscoll, Miss Hughson, Miss Yates, and Miss Benedict. Miss West sat in  the box adjoining.</p>
  <p>A  fortnight later this handkerchief reappeared&mdash;and where? Among the cushions of a  yellow satin couch in her own drawing-room. The Inseparables had just made  their call and the three who had sat on the couch were Miss Driscoll, Miss  Hughson, and Miss Benedict.</p>
  <p>The  next instance seemed to point still more insistently toward the lady already  named. Miss Yates had an expensive present to buy, and the whole five  Inseparables went in an imposing group to Tiffany's. A tray of rings was set  before them. All examined and eagerly fingered the stock out of which Miss  Yates presently chose a finely set emerald. She was leading her friends away  when the clerk suddenly whispered in her ear, "I miss one of the rings."  Dismayed beyond speech, she turned and consulted the faces of her four  companions who stared back at her with immovable serenity. But one of them was  paler than usual, and this lady (it was Miss Driscoll) held her hands in her  muff and did not offer to take them out. Miss Yates, whose father had completed  a big "deal" the week before, wheeled round upon the clerk. "Charge it! charge  it at its full value," said she. "I buy both the rings."</p>
  <p>And  in three weeks the purloined ring came back to her, in a box of violets with no  name attached.</p>
  <p>The  third instance was a recent one, and had come to Mr. Driscoll's ears directly  from the lady suffering the loss. She was a woman of uncompromising integrity,  who felt it her duty to make known to this gentleman the following facts: She  had just left a studio reception, and was standing at the curb waiting for a  taxicab to draw up, when a small boy&mdash;a street arab&mdash;darted toward her from the  other side of the street, and thrusting into her hand something small and hard,  cried breathlessly as he slipped away, "It's yours, ma'am; you dropped it."  Astonished, for she had not been conscious of any loss, she looked down at her  treasure trove and found it to be a small medallion which she sometimes wore on  a chain at her belt. But she had not worn it that day, nor any day for weeks.  Then she remembered. She had worn it a month before to a similar reception at  this same studio. A number of young girls had stood about her admiring it&mdash;she  remembered well who they were; the Inseparables, of course, and to please them  she had slipped it from its chain. Then something had happened,&mdash;something which  diverted her attention entirely,&mdash;and she had gone home without the medallion;  had, in fact, forgotten it, only to recall its loss now. Placing it in her bag,  she looked hastily about her. A crowd was at her back; nothing to be  distinguished there. But in front, on the opposite side of the street, stood a  club-house, and in one of its windows she perceived a solitary figure looking  out. It was that of Miss Driscoll's father. He could imagine her conclusion.</p>
  <p>In  vain he denied all knowledge of the matter. She told him other stories which  had come to her ears of thefts as mysterious, followed by restorations as  peculiar as this one, finishing with, "It is your daughter, and people are  beginning to say so."</p>
  <p>And  Miss Strange, brooding over these instances, would have said the same, but for  Miss Driscoll's absolute serenity of demeanour and complete abandonment to  love. These seemed incompatible with guilt; these, whatever the appearances,  proclaimed innocence&mdash;an innocence she was here to prove if fortune favoured and  the really guilty person's madness should again break forth.</p>
  <p>For  madness it would be and nothing less, for any hand, even the most experienced,  to draw attention to itself by a repetition of old tricks on an occasion so  marked. Yet because it would take madness, and madness knows no law, she  prepared herself for the contingency under a mask of girlish smiles which made  her at once the delight and astonishment of her watchful and uneasy host.</p>
  <p>With  the exception of the diamonds worn by the Ambassadress, there was but one jewel  of consequence to be seen at the dinner that night; but how great was that  consequence and with what splendour it invested the snowy neck it adorned!</p>
  <p>Miss  Strange, in compliment to the noble foreigners, had put on one of her family  heirlooms&mdash;a filigree pendant of extraordinary sapphires which had once belonged  to Marie Antoinette. As its beauty flashed upon the women, and its value struck  the host, the latter could not restrain himself from casting an anxious eye  about the board in search of some token of the cupidity with which one person  there must welcome this unexpected sight.</p>
  <p>Naturally  his first glance fell upon Alicia, seated opposite to him at the other end of  the table. But her eyes were elsewhere, and her smile for Captain Holliday, and  the father's gaze travelled on, taking up each young girl's face in turn. All  were contemplating Miss Strange and her jewels, and the cheeks of one were  flushed and those of the others pale, but whether with dread or longing who  could tell. Struck with foreboding, but alive to his duty as host, he forced  his glances away, and did not even allow himself to question the motive or the  wisdom of the temptation thus offered.</p>
  <p>Two  hours later and the girls were all in one room. It was a custom of the  Inseparables to meet for a chat before retiring, but always alone and in the  room of one of their number. But this was a night of innovations; Violet was  not only included, but the meeting was held in her room. Her way with girls was  even more fruitful of result than her way with men. They might laugh at her,  criticize her or even call her names significant of disdain, but they never  left her long to herself or missed an opportunity to make the most of her  irrepressible chatter.</p>
  <p>Her  satisfaction at entering this charmed circle did not take from her piquancy,  and story after story fell from her lips, as she fluttered about, now here now  there, in her endless preparations for retirement. She had taken off her  historic pendant after it had been duly admired and handled by all present,  and, with the careless confidence of an assured ownership, thrown it down upon  the end of her dresser, which, by the way, projected very close to the open  window.</p>
  <p>"Are  you going to leave your jewel there?" whispered a voice in her ear as a burst  of laughter rang out in response to one of her sallies.</p>
  <p>Turning,  with a simulation of round-eyed wonder, she met Miss Hughson's earnest gaze  with the careless rejoinder, "What's the harm?" and went on with her story with  all the reckless ease of a perfectly thoughtless nature.</p>
  <p>Miss  Hughson abandoned her protest. How could she explain her reasons for it to one  apparently uninitiated in the scandal associated with their especial clique.</p>
  <p>Yes,  she left the jewel there; but she locked her door and quickly, so that they  must all have heard her before reaching their rooms. Then she crossed to the  window, which, like all on this side, opened on a balcony running the length of  the house. She was aware of this balcony, also of the fact that only young  ladies slept in the corridor communicating with it. But she was not quite sure  that this one corridor accommodated them all. If one of them should room  elsewhere! (Miss Driscoll, for instance). But no! the anxiety displayed for the  safety of her jewel precluded that supposition. Their hostess, if none of the  others, was within access of this room and its open window. But how about the  rest? Perhaps the lights would tell. Eagerly the little schemer looked forth,  and let her glances travel down the full length of the balcony. Two separate  beams of light shot across it as she looked, and presently another, and, after  some waiting, a fourth. But the fifth failed to appear. This troubled her, but  not seriously. Two of the girls might be sleeping in one bed.</p>
  <p>Drawing  her shade, she finished her preparations for the night; then with her kimono  on, lifted the pendant and thrust it into a small box she had taken from her  trunk. A curious smile, very unlike any she had shown to man or woman that day,  gave a sarcastic lift to her lips, as with a slow and thoughtful manipulation  of her dainty fingers she moved the jewel about in this small receptacle and  then returned it, after one quick examining glance, to the very spot on the  dresser from which she had taken it. "If only the madness is great enough!"  that smile seemed to say. Truly, it was much to hope for, but a chance is a  chance; and comforting herself with the thought, Miss Strange put out her  light, and, with a hasty raising of the shade she had previously pulled down,  took a final look at the prospect.</p>
  <p>Its  aspect made her shudder. A low fog was rising from the meadows in the far distance,  and its ghostliness under the moon woke all sorts of uncanny images in her  excited mind. To escape them she crept into bed where she lay with her eyes on  the end of her dresser. She had closed that half of the French window over  which she had drawn the shade; but she had left ajar the one giving free access  to the jewels; and when she was not watching the scintillation of her sapphires  in the moonlight, she was dwelling in fixed attention on this narrow opening.</p>
  <p>But  nothing happened, and two o'clock, then three o'clock struck, without a dimming  of the blue scintillations on the end of her dresser. Then she suddenly sat up.  Not that she heard anything new, but that a thought had come to her. "If an  attempt is made," so she murmured softly to herself, "it will be by&mdash;" She did  not finish. Something&mdash;she could not call it sound&mdash;set her heart beating  tumultuously, and listening&mdash;listening&mdash;watching&mdash;watching&mdash;she followed in her  imagination the approach down the balcony of an almost inaudible step, not  daring to move herself, it seemed so near, but waiting with eyes fixed, for the  shadow which must fall across the shade she had failed to raise over that half  of the swinging window she had so carefully left shut.</p>
  <p>At  length she saw it projecting slowly across the slightly illuminated surface.  Formless, save for the outreaching hand, it passed the casement's edge, nearing  with pauses and hesitations the open gap beyond through which the neglected  sapphires beamed with steady lustre. Would she ever see the hand itself appear  between the dresser and the window frame? Yes, there it comes,&mdash;small, delicate,  and startlingly white, threading that gap&mdash;darting with the suddenness of a  serpent's tongue toward the dresser and disappearing again with the pendant in  its clutch.</p>
  <p>As  she realizes this,&mdash;she is but young, you know,&mdash;as she sees her bait taken and  the hardly expected event fulfilled, her pent-up breath sped forth in a sigh  which sent the intruder flying, and so startled herself that she sank back in  terror on her pillow.</p>
  <p>The  breakfast-call had sounded its musical chimes through the halls. The Ambassador  and his wife had responded, so had most of the young gentlemen and ladies, but  the daughter of the house was not amongst them, nor Miss Strange, whom one  would naturally expect to see down first of all.</p>
  <p>These  two absences puzzled Mr. Driscoll. What might they not portend? But his  suspense, at least in one regard, was short. Before his guests were well  seated, Miss Driscoll entered from the terrace in company with Captain Holliday.  In her arms she carried a huge bunch of roses and was looking very beautiful.  Her father's heart warmed at the sight. No shadow from the night rested upon  her.</p>
  <p>But  Miss Strange!&mdash;where was she? He could not feel quite easy till he knew.</p>
  <p>"Have  any of you seen Miss Strange?" he asked, as they sat down at table. And his  eyes sought the Inseparables.</p>
  <p>Five  lovely heads were shaken, some carelessly, some wonderingly, and one, with a  quick, forced smile. But he was in no mood to discriminate, and he had beckoned  one of the servants to him, when a step was heard at the door and the  delinquent slid in and took her place, in a shamefaced manner suggestive of a  cause deeper than mere tardiness. In fact, she had what might be called a  frightened air, and stared into her plate, avoiding every eye, which was  certainly not natural to her. What did it mean? and why, as she made a poor  attempt at eating, did four of the Inseparables exchange glances of doubt and  dismay and then concentrate their looks upon his daughter? That Alicia failed  to notice this, but sat abloom above her roses now fastened in a great bunch  upon her breast, offered him some comfort, yet, for all the volubility of his  chief guests, the meal was a great trial to his patience, as well as a poor preparation  for the hour when, the noble pair gone, he stepped into the library to find  Miss Strange awaiting him with one hand behind her back and a piteous look on  her infantile features.</p>
  <p>"O,  Mr. Driscoll," she began,&mdash;and then he saw that a group of anxious girls hovered  in her rear&mdash;"my pendant! my beautiful pendant! It is gone! Somebody reached in  from the balcony and took it from my dresser in the night. Of course, it was to  frighten me; all of the girls told me not to leave it there. But I&mdash;I cannot  make them give it back, and papa is so particular about this jewel that I'm  afraid to go home. Won't you tell them it's no joke, and see that I get it  again. I won't be so careless another time."</p>
  <p>Hardly  believing his eyes, hardly believing his ears,&mdash;she was so perfectly the spoiled  child detected in a fault&mdash;he looked sternly about upon the girls and bade them  end the jest and produce the gems at once.</p>
  <p>But  not one of them spoke, and not one of them moved; only his daughter grew pale  until the roses seemed a mockery, and the steady stare of her large eyes was  almost too much for him to bear.</p>
  <p>The  anguish of this gave asperity to his manner, and in a strange, hoarse tone he  loudly cried:</p>
  <p>"One  of you did this. Which? If it was you, Alicia, speak. I am in no mood for nonsense.  I want to know whose foot traversed the balcony and whose hand abstracted these  jewels."</p>
  <p>A  continued silence, deepening into painful embarrassment for all. Mr. Driscoll  eyed them in ill-concealed anguish, then turning to Miss Strange was still  further thrown off his balance by seeing her pretty head droop and her gaze  fall in confusion.</p>
  <p>"Oh!  it's easy enough to tell whose foot traversed the balcony," she murmured. "It  left this behind." And drawing forward her hand, she held out to view a small  gold-coloured slipper. "I found it outside my window," she explained. "I hoped  I should not have to show it."</p>
  <p>A  gasp of uncontrollable feeling from the surrounding group of girls, then  absolute stillness.</p>
  <p>"I  fail to recognize it," observed Mr. Driscoll, taking it in his hand. "Whose  slipper is this?" he asked in a manner not to be gainsaid.</p>
  <p>Still  no reply, then as he continued to eye the girls one after another a voice&mdash;the  last he expected to hear&mdash;spoke and his daughter cried:</p>
  <p>"It  is mine. But it was not I who walked in it down the balcony."</p>
  <p>"Alicia!"</p>
  <p>A  month's apprehension was in that cry. The silence, the pent-up emotion brooding  in the air was intolerable. A fresh young laugh broke it.</p>
  <p>"Oh,"  exclaimed a roguish voice, "I knew that you were all in it! But the especial  one who wore the slipper and grabbed the pendant cannot hope to hide herself.  Her finger-tips will give her away."</p>
  <p>Amazement  on every face and a convulsive movement in one half-hidden hand.</p>
  <p>"You  see," the airy little being went on, in her light way, "I have some awfully  funny tricks. I am always being scolded for them, but somehow I don't improve.  One is to keep my jewelry bright with a strange foreign paste an old  Frenchwoman once gave me in Paris. It's of a vivid red, and stains the fingers  dreadfully if you don't take care. Not even water will take it off, see mine. I  used that paste on my pendant last night just after you left me, and being  awfully sleepy I didn't stop to rub it off. If your finger-tips are not red,  you never touched the pendant, Miss Driscoll. Oh, see! They are as white as  milk.</p>
  <p>"But  some one took the sapphires, and I owe that person a scolding, as well as  myself. Was it you, Miss Hughson? You, Miss Yates? or&mdash;" and here she paused  before Miss West, "Oh, you have your gloves on! You are the guilty one!" and  her laugh rang out like a peal of bells, robbing her next sentence of even a  suggestion of sarcasm. "Oh, what a sly-boots!" she cried. "How you have  deceived me! Whoever would have thought you to be the one to play the mischief!"</p>
  <p>Who  indeed! Of all the five, she was the one who was considered absolutely immune  from suspicion ever since the night Mrs. Barnum's handkerchief had been taken,  and she not in the box. Eyes which had surveyed Miss Driscoll askance now rose  in wonder toward hers, and failed to fall again because of the stoniness into  which her delicately-carved features had settled.</p>
  <p>"Miss  West, I know you will be glad to remove your gloves; Miss Strange certainly has  a right to know her special tormentor," spoke up her host in as natural a voice  as his great relief would allow.</p>
  <p>But  the cold, half-frozen woman remained without a movement. She was not deceived  by the banter of the moment. She knew that to all of the others, if not to  Peter Strange's odd little daughter, it was the thief who was being spotted and  brought thus hilariously to light. And her eyes grew hard, and her lips grey,  and she failed to unglove the hands upon which all glances were concentrated.</p>
  <p>"You  do not need to see my hands; I confess to taking the pendant."</p>
  <p>"Caroline!"</p>
  <p>A  heart overcome by shock had thrown up this cry. Miss West eyed her bosom-friend  disdainfully.</p>
  <p>"Miss  Strange has called it a jest," she coldly commented. "Why should you suggest  anything of a graver character?"</p>
  <p>Alicia  brought thus to bay, and by one she had trusted most, stepped quickly forward,  and quivering with vague doubts, aghast before unheard-of possibilities, she  tremulously remarked:</p>
  <p>"We  did not sleep together last night. You had to come into my room to get my  slippers. Why did you do this? What was in your mind, Caroline?"</p>
  <p>A  steady look, a low laugh choked with many emotions answered her.</p>
  <p>"Do  you want me to reply, Alicia? Or shall we let it pass?"</p>
  <p>"Answer!"</p>
  <p>It  was Mr. Driscoll who spoke. Alicia had shrunk back, almost to where a little  figure was cowering with wide eyes fixed in something like terror on the  aroused father's face.</p>
  <p>"Then  hear me," murmured the girl, entrapped and suddenly desperate. "I wore Alicia's  slippers and I took the jewels, because it was time that an end should come to  your mutual dissimulation. The love I once felt for her she has herself  deliberately killed. I had a lover&mdash;she took him. I had faith in life, in  honour, and in friendship. She destroyed all. A thief&mdash;she has dared to aspire  to him! And you condoned her fault. You, with your craven restoration of her  booty, thought the matter cleared and her a fit mate for a man of highest  honour."</p>
  <p>"Miss  West,"&mdash;no one had ever heard that tone in Mr. Driscoll's voice before, "before  you say another word calculated to mislead these ladies, let me say that this  hand never returned any one's booty or had anything to do with the restoration  of any abstracted article. You have been caught in a net, Miss West, from which  you cannot escape by slandering my innocent daughter."</p>
  <p>"Innocent!"  All the tragedy latent in this peculiar girl's nature blazed forth in the word.  "Alicia, face me. Are you innocent? Who took the Dempsey corals, and that  diamond from the Tiffany tray?"</p>
  <p>"It  is not necessary for Alicia to answer," the father interposed with not  unnatural heat. "Miss West stands self-convicted."</p>
  <p>"How  about Lady Paget's scarf? I was not there that night."</p>
  <p>"You  are a woman of wiles. That could be managed by one bent on an elaborate scheme  of revenge."</p>
  <p>"And  so could the abstraction of Mrs. Barnum's five-hundred-dollar handkerchief by  one who sat in the next box," chimed in Miss Hughson, edging away from the  friend to whose honour she would have pinned her faith an hour before. "I  remember now seeing her lean over the railing to adjust the old lady's shawl."</p>
  <p>With  a start, Caroline West turned a tragic gaze upon the speaker.</p>
  <p>"You  think me guilty of all because of what I did last night?"</p>
  <p>"Why  shouldn't I?"</p>
  <p>"And  you, Anna?"</p>
  <p>"Alicia  has my sympathy," murmured Miss Benedict.</p>
  <p>Yet  the wild girl persisted.</p>
  <p>"But  I have told you my provocation. You cannot believe that I am guilty of her sin;  not if you look at her as I am looking now."</p>
  <p>But  their glances hardly followed her pointing finger. Her friends&mdash;the comrades of  her youth, the Inseparables with their secret oath&mdash;one and all held themselves  aloof, struck by the perfidy they were only just beginning to take in. Smitten  with despair, for these girls were her life, she gave one wild leap and sank on  her knees before Alicia.</p>
  <p>"O  speak!" she began. "Forgive me, and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>A  tremble seized her throat; she ceased to speak and let fall her partially  uplifted hands. The cheery sound of men's voices had drifted in from the  terrace, and the figure of Captain Holliday could be seen passing by. The  shudder which shook Caroline West communicated itself to Alicia Driscoll, and  the former rising quickly, the two women surveyed each other, possibly for the  first time, with open soul and a complete understanding.</p>
  <p>"Caroline!"  murmured the one.</p>
  <p>"Alicia!"  pleaded the other.</p>
  <p>"Caroline,  trust me," said Alicia Driscoll in that moving voice of hers, which more than  her beauty caught and retained all hearts. "You have served me ill, but it was  not all undeserved. Girls," she went on, eyeing both them and her father with  the wistfulness of a breaking heart, "neither Caroline nor myself are worthy of  Captain Holliday's love. Caroline has told you her fault, but mine is perhaps a  worse one. The ring&mdash;the scarf&mdash;the diamond pins&mdash;I took them all&mdash;took them if I  did not retain them. A curse has been over my life&mdash;the curse of a longing I  could not combat. But love was working a change in me. Since I have known  Captain Holliday&mdash;but that's all over. I was mad to think I could be happy with  such memories in my life. I shall never marry now&mdash;or touch jewels again&mdash;my own  or another's. Father, father, you won't go back on your girl! I couldn't see  Caroline suffer for what I have done. You will pardon me and help&mdash;help&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Her  voice choked. She flung herself into her father's arms; his head bent over  hers, and for an instant not a soul in the room moved. Then Miss Hughson gave a  spring and caught her by the hand. "We are inseparable," said she, and kissed  the hand, murmuring, "Now is our time to show it."</p>
  <p>Then  other lips fell upon those cold and trembling fingers, which seemed to warm  under these embraces. And then a tear. It came from the hard eye of Caroline,  and remained a sacred secret between the two.</p>
  <p>"You  have your pendant?"</p>
  <p>Mr.  Driscoll's suffering eye shone down on Violet Strange's uplifted face as she  advanced to say good-bye preparatory to departure.</p>
  <p>"Yes,"  she acknowledged, "but hardly, I fear, your gratitude."</p>
  <p>And  the answer astonished her.</p>
  <p>"I  am not sure that the real Alicia will not make her father happier than the  unreal one has ever done."</p>
  <p>"And  Captain Holliday?"</p>
  <p>"He  may come to feel the same."</p>
  <p>"Then  I do not quit in disgrace?"</p>
  <p>"You  depart with my thanks."</p>
  <p>When  a certain personage was told of the success of Miss Strange's latest manoeuvre,  he remarked: "The little one progresses. We shall have to give her a case of  prime importance next."</p>
  <p align="center"><b>End Of Problem  I</b></p>
  <p><br>
      <br>
  </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Problem II <br>
    The Second Bullet</b></h2>
  <p>"You must see her."</p>
  <p>"No.  No."</p>
  <p>"She's  a most unhappy woman. Husband and child both taken from her in a moment; and  now, all means of living as well, unless some happy thought of yours&mdash;some  inspiration of your genius&mdash;shows us a way of re-establishing her claims to the  policy voided by this cry of suicide."</p>
  <p>But  the small wise head of Violet Strange continued its slow shake of decided  refusal.</p>
  <p>"I'm  sorry," she protested, "but it's quite out of my province. I'm too young to  meddle with so serious a matter."</p>
  <p>"Not  when you can save a bereaved woman the only possible compensation left her by  untoward fate?"</p>
  <p>"Let  the police try their hand at that."</p>
  <p>"They  have had no success with the case."</p>
  <p>"Or  you?"</p>
  <p>"Nor  I either."</p>
  <p>"And  you expect&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  Miss Strange. I expect you to find the missing bullet which will settle the  fact that murder and not suicide ended George Hammond's life. If you cannot,  then a long litigation awaits this poor widow, ending, as such litigation  usually does, in favour of the stronger party. There's the alternative. If you  once saw her&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"But  that's what I'm not willing to do. If I once saw her I should yield to her  importunities and attempt the seemingly impossible. My instincts bid me say no.  Give me something easier."</p>
  <p>"Easier  things are not so remunerative. There's money in this affair, if the insurance  company is forced to pay up. I can offer you&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"What?"</p>
  <p>There  was eagerness in the tone despite her effort at nonchalance. The other smiled  imperceptibly, and briefly named the sum.</p>
  <p>It  was larger than she had expected. This her visitor saw by the way her eyelids  fell and the peculiar stillness which, for an instant, held her vivacity in  check.</p>
  <p>"And  you think I can earn that?"</p>
  <p>Her  eyes were fixed on his in an eagerness as honest as it was unrestrained.</p>
  <p>He  could hardly conceal his amazement, her desire was so evident and the cause of  it so difficult to understand. He knew she wanted money&mdash;that was her avowed  reason for entering into this uncongenial work. But to want it so much! He  glanced at her person; it was simply clad but very expensively&mdash;how expensively  it was his business to know. Then he took in the room in which they sat.  Simplicity again, but the simplicity of high art&mdash;the drawing-room of one rich  enough to indulge in the final luxury of a highly cultivated taste, viz.:  unostentatious elegance and the subjection of each carefully chosen ornament to  the general effect.</p>
  <p>What  did this favoured child of fortune lack that she could be reached by such a  plea, when her whole being revolted from the nature of the task he offered her?  It was a question not new to him; but one he had never heard answered and was  not likely to hear answered now. But the fact remained that the consent he had  thought dependent upon sympathetic interest could be reached much more readily  by the promise of large emolument,&mdash;and he owned to a feeling of secret  disappointment even while he recognized the value of the discovery.</p>
  <p>But  his satisfaction in the latter, if satisfaction it were, was of very short  duration. Almost immediately he observed a change in her. The sparkle which had  shone in the eye whose depths he had never been able to penetrate, had  dissipated itself in something like a tear and she spoke up in that vigorous  tone no one but himself had ever heard, as she said:</p>
  <p>"No.  The sum is a good one and I could use it; but I will not waste my energy on a  case I do not believe in. The man shot himself. He was a speculator, and probably  had good reason for his act. Even his wife acknowledges that he has lately had  more losses than gains."</p>
  <p>"See  her. She has something to tell you which never got into the papers."</p>
  <p>"You  say that? You know that?"</p>
  <p>"On  my honour, Miss Strange."</p>
  <p>Violet  pondered; then suddenly succumbed.</p>
  <p>"Let  her come, then. Prompt to the hour. I will receive her at three. Later I have a  tea and two party calls to make."</p>
  <p>Her  visitor rose to leave. He had been able to subdue all evidence of his extreme  gratification, and now took on a formal air. In dismissing a guest, Miss  Strange was invariably the society belle and that only. This he had come to  recognize.</p>
  <p>The  case (well known at the time) was, in the fewest possible words, as follows:</p>
  <p>On  a sultry night in September, a young couple living in one of the large  apartment houses in the extreme upper portion of Manhattan were so annoyed by  the incessant crying of a child in the adjoining suite, that they got up, he to  smoke, and she to sit in the window for a possible breath of cool air. They  were congratulating themselves upon the wisdom they had shown in thus giving up  all thought of sleep&mdash;for the child's crying had not ceased&mdash;when (it may have  been two o'clock and it may have been a little later) there came from somewhere  near, the sharp and somewhat peculiar detonation of a pistol-shot.</p>
  <p>He  thought it came from above; she, from the rear, and they were staring at each  other in the helpless wonder of the moment, when they were struck by the  silence. The baby had ceased to cry. All was as still in the adjoining  apartment as in their own&mdash;too still&mdash;much too still. Their mutual stare turned  to one of horror. "It came from there!" whispered the wife. "Some accident has  occurred to Mr. or Mrs. Hammond&mdash;we ought to go&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Her  words&mdash;very tremulous ones&mdash;were broken by a shout from below. They were standing  in their window and had evidently been seen by a passing policeman. "Anything  wrong up there?" they heard him cry. Mr. Saunders immediately looked out.  "Nothing wrong here," he called down. (They were but two stories from the  pavement.) "But I'm not so sure about the rear apartment. We thought we heard a  shot. Hadn't you better come up, officer? My wife is nervous about it. I'll  meet you at the stair-head and show you the way."</p>
  <p>The  officer nodded and stepped in. The young couple hastily donned some wraps, and,  by the time he appeared on their floor, they were ready to accompany him.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  no disturbance was apparent anywhere else in the house, until the policeman  rang the bell of the Hammond apartment. Then, voices began to be heard, and  doors to open above and below, but not the one before which the policeman  stood.</p>
  <p>Another  ring, and this time an insistent one;&mdash;and still no response. The officer's hand  was rising for the third time when there came a sound of fluttering from behind  the panels against which he had laid his ear, and finally a choked voice  uttering unintelligible words. Then a hand began to struggle with the lock, and  the door, slowly opening, disclosed a woman clad in a hastily donned wrapper  and giving every evidence of extreme fright.</p>
  <p>"Oh!"  she exclaimed, seeing only the compassionate faces of her neighbours. "You  heard it, too! a pistol-shot from there&mdash;there&mdash;my husband's room. I have not  dared to go&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;O, have mercy and see if anything is wrong! It is so still&mdash;so  still, and only a moment ago the baby was crying. Mrs. Saunders, Mrs. Saunders,  why is it so still?"</p>
  <p>She  had fallen into her neighbour's arms. The hand with which she had pointed out a  certain door had sunk to her side and she appeared to be on the verge of  collapse.</p>
  <p>The  officer eyed her sternly, while noting her appearance, which was that of a  woman hastily risen from bed.</p>
  <p>"Where  were you?" he asked. "Not with your husband and child, or you would know what  had happened there."</p>
  <p>"I  was sleeping down the hall," she managed to gasp out. "I'm not well&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, why  do you all stand still and do nothing? My baby's in there. Go! go!" and, with  sudden energy, she sprang upright, her eyes wide open and burning, her small  well featured face white as the linen she sought to hide.</p>
  <p>The  officer demurred no longer. In another instant he was trying the door at which  she was again pointing.</p>
  <p>It  was locked.</p>
  <p>Glancing  back at the woman, now cowering almost to the floor, he pounded at the door and  asked the man inside to open.</p>
  <p>No  answer came back.</p>
  <p>With  a sharp turn he glanced again at the wife.</p>
  <p>"You  say that your husband is in this room?"</p>
  <p>She  nodded, gasping faintly, "And the child!"</p>
  <p>He  turned back, listened, then beckoned to Mr. Saunders. "We shall have to break  our way in," said he. "Put your shoulder well to the door. Now!"</p>
  <p>The  hinges of the door creaked; the lock gave way (this special officer weighed two  hundred and seventy-five, as he found out, next day), and a prolonged and  sweeping crash told the rest.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Hammond gave a low cry; and, straining forward from where she crouched in  terror on the floor, searched the faces of the two men for some hint of what  they saw in the dimly-lighted space beyond. Something dreadful, something which  made Mr. Saunders come rushing back with a shout:</p>
  <p>"Take  her away! Take her to our apartment, Jennie. She must not see&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Not  see! He realized the futility of his words as his gaze fell on the young woman  who had risen up at his approach and now stood gazing at him without speech,  without movement, but with a glare of terror in her eyes, which gave him his  first realization of human misery.</p>
  <p>His  own glance fell before it. If he had followed his instinct he would have fled  the house rather than answer the question of her look and the attitude of her  whole frozen body.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  in mercy to his speechless terror, perhaps in mercy to herself, she was the one  who at last found the word which voiced their mutual anguish.</p>
  <p>"Dead?"</p>
  <p>No  answer. None was needed.</p>
  <p>"And  my baby?"</p>
  <p>O,  that cry! It curdled the hearts of all who heard it. It shook the souls of men  and women both inside and outside the apartment; then all was forgotten in the  wild rush she made. The wife and mother had flung herself upon the scene, and,  side by side with the not unmoved policeman, stood looking down upon the  desolation made in one fatal instant in her home and heart.</p>
  <p>They  lay there together, both past help, both quite dead. The child had simply been  strangled by the weight of his father's arm which lay directly across the  upturned little throat. But the father was a victim of the shot they had heard.  There was blood on his breast, and a pistol in his hand.</p>
  <p>Suicide!  The horrible truth was patent. No wonder they wanted to hold the young widow  back. Her neighbour, Mrs. Saunders, crept in on tiptoe and put her arms about  the swaying, fainting woman; but there was nothing to say&mdash;absolutely nothing.</p>
  <p>At  least, they thought not. But when they saw her throw herself down, not by her  husband, but by the child, and drag it out from under that strangling arm and  hug and kiss it and call out wildly for a doctor, the officer endeavoured to  interfere and yet could not find the heart to do so, though he knew the child  was dead and should not, according to all the rules of the coroner's office, be  moved before that official arrived. Yet because no mother could be convinced of  a fact like this, he let her sit with it on the floor and try all her little  arts to revive it, while he gave orders to the janitor and waited himself for  the arrival of doctor and coroner.</p>
  <p>She  was still sitting there in wide-eyed misery, alternately fondling the little  body and drawing back to consult its small set features for some sign of life,  when the doctor came, and, after one look at the child, drew it softly from her  arms and laid it quietly in the crib from which its father had evidently lifted  it but a short time before. Then he turned back to her, and found her on her  feet, upheld by her two friends. She had understood his action, and without a  groan had accepted her fate. Indeed, she seemed incapable of any further speech  or action. She was staring down at her husband's body, which she, for the first  time, seemed fully to see. Was her look one of grief or of resentment for the  part he had played so unintentionally in her child's death? It was hard to  tell; and when, with slowly rising finger, she pointed to the pistol so tightly  clutched in the other outstretched hand, no one there&mdash;and by this time the room  was full&mdash;could foretell what her words would be when her tongue regained its  usage and she could speak.</p>
  <p>What  she did say was this:</p>
  <p>"Is  there a bullet gone? Did he fire off that pistol?" A question so manifestly one  of delirium that no one answered it, which seemed to surprise her, though she said  nothing till her glance had passed all around the walls of the room to where a  window stood open to the night,&mdash;its lower sash being entirely raised. "There!  look there!" she cried, with a commanding accent, and, throwing up her hands,  sank a dead weight into the arms of those supporting her.</p>
  <p>No  one understood; but naturally more than one rushed to the window. An open space  was before them. Here lay the fields not yet parcelled out into lots and built  upon; but it was not upon these they looked, but upon the strong trellis which  they found there, which, if it supported no vine, formed a veritable ladder  between this window and the ground.</p>
  <p>Could  she have meant to call attention to this fact; and were her words expressive of  another idea than the obvious one of suicide?</p>
  <p>If  so, to what lengths a woman's imagination can go! Or so their combined looks  seemed to proclaim, when to their utter astonishment they saw the officer, who  had presented a calm appearance up till now, shift his position and with a  surprised grunt direct their eyes to a portion of the wall just visible beyond  the half-drawn curtains of the bed. The mirror hanging there showed a  star-shaped breakage, such as follows the sharp impact of a bullet or a  fiercely projected stone.</p>
  <p>"He  fired two shots. One went wild; the other straight home."</p>
  <p>It  was the officer delivering his opinion.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Saunders, returning from the distant room where he had assisted in carrying  Mrs. Hammond, cast a look at the shattered glass, and remarked forcibly:</p>
  <p>"I  heard but one; and I was sitting up, disturbed by that poor infant. Jennie, did  you hear more than one shot?" he asked, turning toward his wife.</p>
  <p>"No,"  she answered, but not with the readiness he had evidently expected. "I heard  only one, but that was not quite usual in its tone. I'm used to guns," she  explained, turning to the officer. "My father was an army man, and he taught me  very early to load and fire a pistol. There was a prolonged sound to this shot;  something like an echo of itself, following close upon the first ping. Didn't  you notice that, Warren?"</p>
  <p>"I  remember something of the kind," her husband allowed.</p>
  <p>"He  shot twice and quickly," interposed the policeman, sententiously. "We shall  find a spent bullet back of that mirror."</p>
  <p>But  when, upon the arrival of the coroner, an investigation was made of the mirror  and the wall behind, no bullet was found either there or any where else in the  room, save in the dead man's breast. Nor had more than one been shot from his  pistol, as five full chambers testified. The case which seemed so simple had  its mysteries, but the assertion made by Mrs. Saunders no longer carried  weight, nor was the evidence offered by the broken mirror considered as  indubitably establishing the fact that a second shot had been fired in the  room.</p>
  <p>Yet  it was equally evident that the charge which had entered the dead speculator's  breast had not been delivered at the close range of the pistol found clutched  in his hand. There were no powder-marks to be discerned on his pajama-jacket,  or on the flesh beneath. Thus anomaly confronted anomaly, leaving open but one  other theory: that the bullet found in Mr. Hammond's breast came from the  window and the one he shot went out of it. But this would necessitate his  having shot his pistol from a point far removed from where he was found; and  his wound was such as made it difficult to believe that he would stagger far,  if at all, after its infliction.</p>
  <p>Yet,  because the coroner was both conscientious and alert, he caused a most rigorous  search to be made of the ground overlooked by the above mentioned window; a  search in which the police joined, but which was without any result save that  of rousing the attention of people in the neighbourhood and leading to a story  being circulated of a man seen some time the night before crossing the fields  in a great hurry. But as no further particulars were forthcoming, and not even  a description of the man to be had, no emphasis would have been laid upon this  story had it not transpired that the moment a report of it had come to Mrs.  Hammond's ears (why is there always some one to carry these reports?) she  roused from the torpor into which she had fallen, and in wild fashion  exclaimed:</p>
  <p>"I  knew it! I expected it! He was shot through the window and by that wretch. He  never shot himself." Violent declarations which trailed off into the one  continuous wail, "O, my baby! my poor baby!"</p>
  <p>Such  words, even though the fruit of delirium, merited some sort of attention, or so  this good coroner thought, and as soon as opportunity offered and she was  sufficiently sane and quiet to respond to his questions, he asked her whom she  had meant by that wretch, and what reason she had, or thought she had, of  attributing her husband's death to any other agency than his own disgust with  life.</p>
  <p>And  then it was that his sympathies, although greatly roused in her favour began to  wane. She met the question with a cold stare followed by a few ambiguous words  out of which he could make nothing. Had she said wretch? She did not remember.  They must not be influenced by anything she might have uttered in her first  grief. She was well-nigh insane at the time. But of one thing they might be  sure: her husband had not shot himself; he was too much afraid of death for  such an act. Besides, he was too happy. Whatever folks might say he was too  fond of his family to wish to leave it.</p>
  <p>Nor  did the coroner or any other official succeed in eliciting anything further  from her. Even when she was asked, with cruel insistence, how she explained the  fact that the baby was found lying on the floor instead of in its crib, her  only answer was: "His father was trying to soothe it. The child was crying  dreadfully, as you have heard from those who were kept awake by him that night,  and my husband was carrying him about when the shot came which caused George to  fall and overlay the baby in his struggles."</p>
  <p>"Carrying  a baby about with a loaded pistol in his hand?" came back in stern retort.</p>
  <p>She  had no answer for this. She admitted when informed that the bullet extracted  from her husband's body had been found to correspond exactly with those  remaining in the five chambers of the pistol taken from his hand, that he was  not only the owner of this pistol but was in the habit of sleeping with it  under his pillow; but, beyond that, nothing; and this reticence, as well as her  manner which was cold and repellent, told against her.</p>
  <p>A  verdict of suicide was rendered by the coroner's jury, and the life-insurance  company, in which Mr. Hammond had but lately insured himself for a large sum,  taking advantage of the suicide clause embodied in the policy, announced its  determination of not paying the same.</p>
  <p>Such  was the situation, as known to Violet Strange and the general public, on the  day she was asked to see Mrs. Hammond and learn what might alter her opinion as  to the justice of this verdict and the stand taken by the Shuler Life Insurance  Company.</p>
  <p>The  clock on the mantel in Miss Strange's rose-coloured boudoir had struck three,  and Violet was gazing in some impatience at the door, when there came a gentle  knock upon it, and the maid (one of the elderly, not youthful, kind) ushered in  her expected visitor.</p>
  <p>"You  are Mrs. Hammond?" she asked, in natural awe of the too black figure outlined  so sharply against the deep pink of the sea-shell room.</p>
  <p>The  answer was a slow lifting of the veil which shadowed the features she knew only  from the cuts she had seen in newspapers.</p>
  <p>"You  are&mdash;Miss Strange?" stammered her visitor; "the young lady who&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  am," chimed in a voice as ringing as it was sweet. "I am the person you have  come here to see. And this is my home. But that does not make me less  interested in the unhappy, or less desirous of serving them. Certainly you have  met with the two greatest losses which can come to a woman&mdash;I know your story  well enough to say that&mdash;; but what have you to tell me in proof that you should  not lose your anticipated income as well? Something vital, I hope, else I  cannot help you; something which you should have told the coroner's jury&mdash;and  did not."</p>
  <p>The  flush which was the sole answer these words called forth did not take from the  refinement of the young widow's expression, but rather added to it; Violet  watched it in its ebb and flow and, seriously affected by it (why, she did not  know, for Mrs. Hammond had made no other appeal either by look or gesture),  pushed forward a chair and begged her visitor to be seated.</p>
  <p>"We  can converse in perfect safety here," she said. "When you feel quite equal to  it, let me hear what you have to communicate. It will never go any further. I  could not do the work I do if I felt it necessary to have a confidant."</p>
  <p>"But  you are so young and so&mdash;so&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"So  inexperienced you would say and so evidently a member of what New Yorkers call  'society.' Do not let that trouble you. My inexperience is not likely to last  long and my social pleasures are more apt to add to my efficiency than to  detract from it."</p>
  <p>With  this Violet's face broke into a smile. It was not the brilliant one so often  seen upon her lips, but there was something in its quality which carried  encouragement to the widow and led her to say with obvious eagerness:</p>
  <p>"You  know the facts?"</p>
  <p>"I  have read all the papers."</p>
  <p>"I  was not believed on the stand."</p>
  <p>"It  was your manner&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  could not help my manner. I was keeping something back, and, being unused to  deceit, I could not act quite naturally."</p>
  <p>"Why  did you keep something back? When you saw the unfavourable impression made by  your reticence, why did you not speak up and frankly tell your story?"</p>
  <p>"Because  I was ashamed. Because I thought it would hurt me more to speak than to keep  silent. I do not think so now; but I did then&mdash;and so made my great mistake. You  must remember not only the awful shock of my double loss, but the sense of  guilt accompanying it; for my husband and I had quarreled that night, quarreled  bitterly&mdash;that was why I had run away into another room and not because I was  feeling ill and impatient of the baby's fretful cries."</p>
  <p>"So  people have thought." In saying this, Miss Strange was perhaps cruelly  emphatic. "You wish to explain that quarrel? You think it will be doing any  good to your cause to go into that matter with me now?"</p>
  <p>"I  cannot say; but I must first clear my conscience and then try to convince you  that quarrel or no quarrel, he never took his own life. He was not that kind.  He had an abnormal fear of death. I do not like to say it but he was a physical  coward. I have seen him turn pale at the least hint of danger. He could no more  have turned that muzzle upon his own breast than he could have turned it upon  his baby. Some other hand shot him, Miss Strange. Remember the open window, the  shattered mirror; and I think I know that hand."</p>
  <p>Her  head had fallen forward on her breast. The emotion she showed was not so  eloquent of grief as of deep personal shame.</p>
  <p>"You  think you know the man?" In saying this, Violet's voice sunk to a whisper. It  was an accusation of murder she had just heard.</p>
  <p>"To  my great distress, yes. When Mr. Hammond and I were married," the widow now  proceeded in a more determined tone, "there was another man&mdash;a very violent  one&mdash;who vowed even at the church door that George and I should never live out  two full years together. We have not. Our second anniversary would have been in  November."</p>
  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Let  me say this: the quarrel of which I speak was not serious enough to occasion  any such act of despair on his part. A man would be mad to end his life on  account of so slight a disagreement. It was not even on account of the person  of whom I've just spoken, though that person had been mentioned between us  earlier in the evening, Mr. Hammond having come across him face to face that  very afternoon in the subway. Up to this time neither of us had seen or heard  of him since our wedding-day."</p>
  <p>"And  you think this person whom you barely mentioned, so mindful of his old grudge  that he sought out your domicile, and, with the intention of murder, climbed  the trellis leading to your room and turned his pistol upon the shadowy figure  which was all he could see in the semi-obscurity of a much lowered gas-jet?"</p>
  <p>"A  man in the dark does not need a bright light to see his enemy when he is intent  upon revenge."</p>
  <p>Miss  Strange altered her tone.</p>
  <p>"And  your husband? You must acknowledge that he shot off his pistol whether the  other did or not."</p>
  <p>"It  was in self-defence. He would shoot to save his own life&mdash;or the baby's."</p>
  <p>"Then  he must have heard or seen&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"A  man at the window."</p>
  <p>"And  would have shot there?"</p>
  <p>"Or  tried to."</p>
  <p>"Tried  to?"</p>
  <p>"Yes;  the other shot first&mdash;oh, I've thought it all out&mdash;causing my husband's bullet to  go wild. It was his which broke the mirror."</p>
  <p>Violet's  eyes, bright as stars, suddenly narrowed.</p>
  <p>"And  what happened then?" she asked. "Why cannot they find the bullet?"</p>
  <p>"Because  it went out of the window;&mdash;glanced off and went out of the window."</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Hammond's tone was triumphant; her look spirited and intense.</p>
  <p>Violet  eyed her compassionately.</p>
  <p>"Would  a bullet glancing off from a mirror, however hung, be apt to reach a window so  far on the opposite side?"</p>
  <p>"I  don't know; I only know that it did," was the contradictory, almost absurd,  reply.</p>
  <p>"What  was the cause of the quarrel you speak of between your husband and yourself?  You see, I must know the exact truth and all the truth to be of any assistance  to you."</p>
  <p>"It  was&mdash;it was about the care I gave, or didn't give, the baby. I feel awfully to  have to say it, but George did not think I did my full duty by the child. He  said there was no need of its crying so; that if I gave it the proper attention  it would not keep the neighbours and himself awake half the night. And I&mdash;I got  angry and insisted that I did the best I could; that the child was naturally  fretful and that if he wasn't satisfied with my way of looking after it, he  might try his. All of which was very wrong and unreasonable on my part, as  witness the awful punishment which followed."</p>
  <p>"And  what made you get up and leave him?"</p>
  <p>"The  growl he gave me in reply. When I heard that, I bounded out of bed and said I  was going to the spare room to sleep; and if the baby cried he might just try  what he could do himself to stop it."</p>
  <p>"And  he answered?"</p>
  <p>"This,  just this&mdash;I shall never forget his words as long as I live&mdash;'If you go, you need  not expect me to let you in again no matter what happens.'"</p>
  <p>"He  said that?"</p>
  <p>"And  locked the door after me. You see I could not tell all that."</p>
  <p>"It  might have been better if you had. It was such a natural quarrel and so  unprovocative of actual tragedy."</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Hammond was silent. It was not difficult to see that she had no very keen  regrets for her husband personally. But then he was not a very estimable man  nor in any respect her equal.</p>
  <p>"You  were not happy with him," Violet ventured to remark.</p>
  <p>"I  was not a fully contented woman. But for all that he had no cause to complain  of me except for the reason I have mentioned. I was not a very intelligent  mother. But if the baby were living now&mdash;O, if he were living now&mdash;with what  devotion I should care for him."</p>
  <p>She  was on her feet, her arms were raised, her face impassioned with feeling.  Violet, gazing at her, heaved a little sigh. It was perhaps in keeping with the  situation, perhaps extraneous to it, but whatever its source, it marked a  change in her manner. With no further check upon her sympathy, she said very  softly:</p>
  <p>"It  is well with the child."</p>
  <p>The  mother stiffened, swayed, and then burst into wild weeping.</p>
  <p>"But  not with me," she cried, "not with me. I am desolate and bereft. I have not  even a home in which to hide my grief and no prospect of one."</p>
  <p>"But,"  interposed Violet, "surely your husband left you something? You cannot be quite  penniless?"</p>
  <p>"My  husband left nothing," was the answer, uttered without bitterness, but with all  the hardness of fact. "He had debts. I shall pay those debts. When these and  other necessary expenses are liquidated, there will be but little left. He made  no secret of the fact that he lived close up to his means. That is why he was  induced to take on a life insurance. Not a friend of his but knows his  improvidence. I&mdash;I have not even jewels. I have only my determination and an  absolute conviction as to the real nature of my husband's death."</p>
  <p>"What  is the name of the man you secretly believe to have shot your husband from the  trellis?"</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Hammond told her.</p>
  <p>It  was a new one to Violet. She said so and then asked:</p>
  <p>"What  else can you tell me about him?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing,  but that he is a very dark man and has a club-foot."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  what a mistake you've made."</p>
  <p>"Mistake?  Yes, I acknowledge that."</p>
  <p>"I  mean in not giving this last bit of information at once to the police. A man  can be identified by such a defect. Even his footsteps can be traced. He might  have been found that very day. Now, what have we to go upon?"</p>
  <p>"You  are right, but not expecting to have any difficulty about the insurance money I  thought it would be generous in me to keep still. Besides, this is only surmise  on my part. I feel certain that my husband was shot by another hand than his  own, but I know of no way of proving it. Do you?"</p>
  <p>Then  Violet talked seriously with her, explaining how their only hope lay in the  discovery of a second bullet in the room which had already been ransacked for  this very purpose and without the shadow of a result.</p>
  <p>A  tea, a musicale, and an evening dance kept Violet Strange in a whirl for the  remainder of the day. No brighter eye nor more contagious wit lent brilliance  to these occasions, but with the passing of the midnight hour no one who had  seen her in the blaze of electric lights would have recognized this favoured  child of fortune in the earnest figure sitting in the obscurity of an up-town  apartment, studying the walls, the ceilings, and the floors by the dim light of  a lowered gas-jet. Violet Strange in society was a very different person from  Violet Strange under the tension of her secret and peculiar work.</p>
  <p>She  had told them at home that she was going to spend the night with a friend; but  only her old coachman knew who that friend was. Therefore a very natural sense  of guilt mingled with her emotions at finding herself alone on a scene whose  gruesome mystery she could solve only by identifying herself with the place and  the man who had perished there.</p>
  <p>Dismissing  from her mind all thought of self, she strove to think as he thought, and act  as he acted on the night when he found himself (a man of but little courage)  left in this room with an ailing child.</p>
  <p>At  odds with himself, his wife, and possibly with the child screaming away in its  crib, what would he be apt to do in his present emergency? Nothing at first,  but as the screaming continued he would remember the old tales of fathers  walking the floor at night with crying babies, and hasten to follow suit.  Violet, in her anxiety to reach his inmost thought, crossed to where the crib  had stood, and, taking that as a start, began pacing the room in search of the  spot from which a bullet, if shot, would glance aside from the mirror in the  direction of the window. (Not that she was ready to accept this theory of Mrs.  Hammond, but that she did not wish to entirely dismiss it without putting it to  the test.)</p>
  <p>She  found it in an unexpected quarter of the room and much nearer the bed-head than  where his body was found. This, which might seem to confuse matters, served, on  the contrary to remove from the case one of its most serious difficulties.  Standing here, he was within reach of the pillow under which his pistol lay  hidden, and if startled, as his wife believed him to have been by a noise at  the other end of the room, had but to crouch and reach behind him in order to  find himself armed and ready for a possible intruder.</p>
  <p>Imitating  his action in this as in other things, she had herself crouched low at the  bedside and was on the point of withdrawing her hand from under the pillow,  when a new surprise checked her movement and held her fixed in her position,  with eyes staring straight at the adjoining wall. She had seen there what he  must have seen in making this same turn&mdash;the dark bars of the opposite  window-frame outlined in the mirror&mdash;and understood at once what had happened.  In the nervousness and terror of the moment, George Hammond had mistaken this  reflection of the window for the window itself, and shot impulsively at the man  he undoubtedly saw covering him from the trellis without. But while this  explained the shattering of the mirror, how about the other and still more  vital question, of where the bullet went afterward? Was the angle at which it  had been fired acute enough to send it out of a window diagonally opposed? No;  even if the pistol had been held closer to the man firing it than she had  reason to believe, the angle still would be oblique enough to carry it on to  the further wall.</p>
  <p>But  no sign of any such impact had been discovered on this wall. Consequently, the  force of the bullet had been expended before reaching it, and when it fell&mdash;</p>
  <p>Here,  her glance, slowly traveling along the floor, impetuously paused. It had  reached the spot where the two bodies had been found, and unconsciously her  eyes rested there, conjuring up the picture of the bleeding father and the  strangled child. How piteous and how dreadful it all was. If she could only  understand&mdash;Suddenly she rose straight up, staring and immovable in the dim  light. Had the idea&mdash;the explanation&mdash;the only possible explanation covering the  whole phenomena come to her at last?</p>
  <p>It  would seem so, for as she so stood, a look of conviction settled over her  features, and with this look, evidences of a horror which for all her fast  accumulating knowledge of life and its possibilities made her appear very small  and very helpless.</p>
  <p>A  half-hour later, when Mrs. Hammond, in her anxiety at hearing nothing more from  Miss Strange, opened the door of her room, it was to find, lying on the edge of  the sill, the little detective's card with these words hastily written across  it:</p>
  <p>I  do not feel as well as I could wish, and so have telephoned to my own coachman  to come and take me home. I will either see or write you within a few days. But  do not allow yourself to hope. I pray you do not allow yourself the least hope;  the outcome is still very problematical.</p>
  <p>When  Violet's employer entered his office the next morning it was to find a veiled  figure awaiting him which he at once recognized as that of his little deputy.  She was slow in lifting her veil and when it finally came free he felt a  momentary doubt as to his wisdom in giving her just such a matter as this to  investigate. He was quite sure of his mistake when he saw her face, it was so  drawn and pitiful.</p>
  <p>"You  have failed," said he.</p>
  <p>"Of  that you must judge," she answered; and drawing near she whispered in his ear.</p>
  <p>"No!"  he cried in his amazement.</p>
  <p>"Think,"  she murmured, "think. Only so can all the facts be accounted for."</p>
  <p>"I  will look into it; I will certainly look into it," was his earnest reply. "If  you are right&mdash;But never mind that. Go home and take a horseback ride in the  Park. When I have news in regard to this I will let you know. Till then forget  it all. Hear me, I charge you to forget everything but your balls and your  parties."</p>
  <p>And  Violet obeyed him.</p>
  <p>Some  few days after this, the following statement appeared in all the papers:</p>
  <p>"Owing  to some remarkable work done by the firm of &mdash; &amp; &mdash;, the well-known private  detective agency, the claim made by Mrs. George Hammond against the Shuler Life  Insurance Company is likely to be allowed without further litigation. As our  readers will remember, the contestant has insisted from the first that the  bullet causing her husband's death came from another pistol than the one found  clutched in his own hand. But while reasons were not lacking to substantiate  this assertion, the failure to discover more than the disputed track of a  second bullet led to a verdict of suicide, and a refusal of the company to pay.</p>
  <p>"But  now that bullet has been found. And where? In the most startling place in the  world, viz.: in the larynx of the child found lying dead upon the floor beside  his father, strangled as was supposed by the weight of that father's arm. The  theory is, and there seems to be none other, that the father, hearing a  suspicious noise at the window, set down the child he was endeavouring to  soothe and made for the bed and his own pistol, and, mistaking a reflection of  the assassin for the assassin himself, sent his shot sidewise at a mirror just  as the other let go the trigger which drove a similar bullet into his breast.  The course of the one was straight and fatal and that of the other deflected.  Striking the mirror at an oblique angle, the bullet fell to the floor where it  was picked up by the crawling child, and, as was most natural, thrust at once  into his mouth. Perhaps it felt hot to the little tongue; perhaps the child was  simply frightened by some convulsive movement of the father who evidently spent  his last moment in an endeavour to reach the child, but, whatever the cause, in  the quick gasp it gave, the bullet was drawn into the larynx, strangling him.</p>
  <p>"That  the father's arm, in his last struggle, should have fallen directly across the  little throat is one of those anomalies which confounds reason and misleads  justice by stopping investigation at the very point where truth lies and  mystery disappears.</p>
  <p>"Mrs.  Hammond is to be congratulated that there are detectives who do not give too  much credence to outward appearances."</p>
  <p>We  expect soon to hear of the capture of the man who sped home the death-dealing  bullet.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>End Of Problem  II</b></p>
  <p><br>
      <br>
  </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Problem III <br>
    An Intangible Clue</b></h2>
  <p>"Have you studied the case?"</p>
  <p>"Not  I."</p>
  <p>"Not  studied the case which for the last few days has provided the papers with such  conspicuous headlines?"</p>
  <p>"I  do not read the papers. I have not looked at one in a whole week."</p>
  <p>"Miss  Strange, your social engagements must be of a very pressing nature just now?"</p>
  <p>"They  are."</p>
  <p>"And  your business sense in abeyance?"</p>
  <p>"How  so?"</p>
  <p>"You  would not ask if you had read the papers."</p>
  <p>To  this she made no reply save by a slight toss of her pretty head. If her  employer felt nettled by this show of indifference, he did not betray it save  by the rapidity of his tones as, without further preamble and possibly without  real excuse, he proceeded to lay before her the case in question. "Last Tuesday  night a woman was murdered in this city; an old woman, in a lonely house where  she has lived for years. Perhaps you remember this house? It occupies a not  inconspicuous site in Seventeenth Street&mdash;a house of the olden time?"</p>
  <p>"No,  I do not remember."</p>
  <p>The  extreme carelessness of Miss Strange's tone would have been fatal to her  socially; but then, she would never have used it socially. This they both knew,  yet he smiled with his customary indulgence.</p>
  <p>"Then  I will describe it."</p>
  <p>She  looked around for a chair and sank into it. He did the same.</p>
  <p>"It  has a fanlight over the front door."</p>
  <p>She  remained impassive.</p>
  <p>"And  two old-fashioned strips of parti-coloured glass on either side."</p>
  <p>"And  a knocker between its panels which may bring money some day."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  you do remember! I thought you would, Miss Strange."</p>
  <p>"Yes.  Fanlights over doors are becoming very rare in New York."</p>
  <p>"Very  well, then. That house was the scene of Tuesday's tragedy. The woman who has  lived there in solitude for years was foully murdered. I have since heard that  the people who knew her best have always anticipated some such violent end for  her. She never allowed maid or friend to remain with her after five in the  afternoon; yet she had money&mdash;some think a great deal&mdash;always in the house."</p>
  <p>"I  am interested in the house, not in her."</p>
  <p>"Yet,  she was a character&mdash;as full of whims and crotchets as a nut is of meat. Her  death was horrible. She fought&mdash;her dress was torn from her body in rags. This  happened, you see, before her hour for retiring; some think as early as six in  the afternoon. And"&mdash;here he made a rapid gesture to catch Violet's wandering  attention&mdash;"in spite of this struggle; in spite of the fact that she was dragged  from room to room&mdash;that her person was searched&mdash;and everything in the house  searched&mdash;that drawers were pulled out of bureaus&mdash;doors wrenched off of  cupboards&mdash;china smashed upon the floor&mdash;whole shelves denuded and not a spot  from cellar to garret left unransacked, no direct clue to the perpetrator has  been found&mdash;nothing that gives any idea of his personality save his display of  strength and great cupidity. The police have even deigned to consult me,&mdash;an  unusual procedure&mdash;but I could find nothing, either. Evidences of fiendish  purpose abound&mdash;of relentless search&mdash;but no clue to the man himself. It's  uncommon, isn't it, not to have any clue?"</p>
  <p>"I  suppose so." Miss Strange hated murders and it was with difficulty she could be  brought to discuss them. But she was not going to be let off; not this time.</p>
  <p>"You  see," he proceeded insistently, "it's not only mortifying to the police but  disappointing to the press, especially as few reporters believe in the  No-thoroughfare business. They say, and we cannot but agree with them, that no  such struggle could take place and no such repeated goings to and fro through  the house without some vestige being left by which to connect this crime with  its daring perpetrator."</p>
  <p>Still  she stared down at her hands&mdash;those little hands so white and fluttering, so  seemingly helpless under the weight of their many rings, and yet so slyly  capable.</p>
  <p>"She  must have queer neighbours," came at last, from Miss Strange's reluctant lips.  "Didn't they hear or see anything of all this?"</p>
  <p>"She  has no neighbours&mdash;that is, after half-past five o'clock. There's a printing  establishment on one side of her, a deserted mansion on the other side, and  nothing but warehouses back and front. There was no one to notice what took  place in her small dwelling after the printing house was closed. She was the most  courageous or the most foolish of women to remain there as she did. But nothing  except death could budge her. She was born in the room where she died; was  married in the one where she worked; saw husband, father, mother, and five  sisters carried out in turn to their graves through the door with the fanlight  over the top&mdash;and these memories held her."</p>
  <p>"You  are trying to interest me in the woman. Don't."</p>
  <p>"No,  I'm not trying to interest you in her, only trying to explain her. There was  another reason for her remaining where she did so long after all residents had  left the block. She had a business."</p>
  <p>"Oh!"</p>
  <p>"She  embroidered monograms for fine ladies."</p>
  <p>"She  did? But you needn't look at me like that. She never embroidered any for me."</p>
  <p>"No?  She did first-class work. I saw some of it. Miss Strange, if I could get you  into that house for ten minutes&mdash;not to see her but to pick up the loose  intangible thread which I am sure is floating around in it somewhere&mdash;wouldn't  you go?"</p>
  <p>Violet  slowly rose&mdash;a movement which he followed to the letter.</p>
  <p>"Must  I express in words the limit I have set for myself in our affair?" she asked.  "When, for reasons I have never thought myself called upon to explain, I  consented to help you a little now and then with some matter where a woman's  tact and knowledge of the social world might tell without offence to herself or  others, I never thought it would be necessary for me to state that temptation  must stop with such cases, or that I should not be asked to touch the sordid or  the bloody. But it seems I was mistaken, and that I must stoop to be explicit.  The woman who was killed on Tuesday might have interested me greatly as an  embroiderer, but as a victim, not at all. What do you see in me, or miss in me,  that you should drag me into an atmosphere of low-down crime?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing,  Miss Strange. You are by nature, as well as by breeding, very far removed from  everything of the kind. But you will allow me to suggest that no crime is  low-down which makes imperative demand upon the intellect and intuitive sense  of its investigator. Only the most delicate touch can feel and hold the thread  I've just spoken of, and you have the most delicate touch I know."</p>
  <p>"Do  not attempt to flatter me. I have no fancy for handling befouled spider webs.  Besides, if I had&mdash;if such elusive filaments fascinated me&mdash;how could I,  well-known in person and name, enter upon such a scene without prejudice to our  mutual compact?"</p>
  <p>"Miss  Strange"&mdash;she had reseated herself, but so far he had failed to follow her  example (an ignoring of the subtle hint that her interest might yet be caught,  which seemed to annoy her a trifle), "I should not even have suggested such a  possibility had I not seen a way of introducing you there without risk to your  position or mine. Among the boxes piled upon Mrs. Doolittle's table&mdash;boxes of  finished work, most of them addressed and ready for delivery&mdash;was one on which  could be seen the name of&mdash;shall I mention it?"</p>
  <p>"Not  mine? You don't mean mine? That would be too odd&mdash;too ridiculously odd. I should  not understand a coincidence of that kind; no, I should not, notwithstanding  the fact that I have lately sent out such work to be done."</p>
  <p>"Yet  it was your name, very clearly and precisely written&mdash;your whole name, Miss  Strange. I saw and read it myself."</p>
  <p>"But  I gave the order to Madame Pirot on Fifth Avenue. How came my things to be  found in the house of this woman of whose horrible death we have been talking?"</p>
  <p>"Did  you suppose that Madame Pirot did such work with her own hands?&mdash;or even had it  done in her own establishment? Mrs. Doolittle was universally employed. She  worked for a dozen firms. You will find the biggest names on most of her  packages. But on this one&mdash;I allude to the one addressed to you&mdash;there was more  to be seen than the name. These words were written on it in another hand. Send  without opening. This struck the police as suspicious; sufficiently so, at  least, for them to desire your presence at the house as soon as you can make it  convenient."</p>
  <p>"To  open the box?"</p>
  <p>"Exactly."</p>
  <p>The  curl of Miss Strange's disdainful lip was a sight to see.</p>
  <p>"You  wrote those words yourself," she coolly observed. "While someone's back was  turned, you whipped out your pencil and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Resorted  to a very pardonable subterfuge highly conducive to the public's good. But  never mind that. Will you go?"</p>
  <p>Miss  Strange became suddenly demure.</p>
  <p>"I  suppose I must," she grudgingly conceded. "However obtained, a summons from the  police cannot be ignored even by Peter Strange's daughter."</p>
  <p>Another  man might have displayed his triumph by smile or gesture; but this one had  learned his role too well. He simply said:</p>
  <p>"Very  good. Shall it be at once? I have a taxi at the door."</p>
  <p>But  she failed to see the necessity of any such hurry. With sudden dignity she  replied:</p>
  <p>"That  won't do. If I go to this house it must be under suitable conditions. I shall  have to ask my brother to accompany me."</p>
  <p>"Your  brother!"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  he's safe. He&mdash;he knows."</p>
  <p>"Your  brother knows?" Her visitor, with less control than usual, betrayed very openly  his uneasiness.</p>
  <p>"He  does and&mdash;approves. But that's not what interests us now, only so far as it  makes it possible for me to go with propriety to that dreadful house."</p>
  <p>A  formal bow from the other and the words:</p>
  <p>"They  may expect you, then. Can you say when?"</p>
  <p>"Within  the next hour. But it will be a useless concession on my part," she pettishly  complained. "A place that has been gone over by a dozen detectives is apt to be  brushed clean of its cobwebs, even if such ever existed."</p>
  <p>"That's  the difficulty," he acknowledged; and did not dare to add another word; she was  at that particular moment so very much the great lady, and so little his  confidential agent.</p>
  <p>He  might have been less impressed, however, by this sudden assumption of manner,  had he been so fortunate as to have seen how she employed the three quarters of  an hour's delay for which she had asked.</p>
  <p>She  read those neglected newspapers, especially the one containing the following  highly coloured narration of this ghastly crime:</p>
  <p>"A  door ajar&mdash;an empty hall&mdash;a line of sinister looking blotches marking a guilty  step diagonally across the flagging&mdash;silence&mdash;and an unmistakable odour repugnant  to all humanity,&mdash;such were the indications which met the eyes of Officer  O'Leary on his first round last night, and led to the discovery of a murder  which will long thrill the city by its mystery and horror.</p>
  <p>"Both  the house and the victim are well known." Here followed a description of the  same and of Mrs. Doolittle's manner of life in her ancient home, which Violet  hurriedly passed over to come to the following:</p>
  <p>"As  far as one can judge from appearances, the crime happened in this wise: Mrs.  Doolittle had been in her kitchen, as the tea-kettle found singing on the stove  goes to prove, and was coming back through her bedroom, when the wretch, who  had stolen in by the front door which, to save steps, she was unfortunately in  the habit of leaving on the latch till all possibility of customers for the day  was over, sprang upon her from behind and dealt her a swinging blow with the  poker he had caught up from the hearthstone.</p>
  <p>"Whether  the struggle which ensued followed immediately upon this first attack or came  later, it will take medical experts to determine. But, whenever it did occur,  the fierceness of its character is shown by the grip taken upon her throat and  the traces of blood which are to be seen all over the house. If the wretch had  lugged her into her workroom and thence to the kitchen, and thence back to the  spot of first assault, the evidences could not have been more ghastly. Bits of  her clothing torn off by a ruthless hand, lay scattered over all these floors.  In her bedroom, where she finally breathed her last, there could be seen  mingled with these a number of large but worthless glass beads; and close  against one of the base-boards, the string which had held them, as shown by the  few remaining beads still clinging to it. If in pulling the string from her  neck he had hoped to light upon some valuable booty, his fury at his  disappointment is evident. You can almost see the frenzy with which he flung  the would-be necklace at the wall, and kicked about and stamped upon its  rapidly rolling beads.</p>
  <p>"Booty!  That was what he was after; to find and carry away the poor needlewoman's  supposed hoardings. If the scene baffles description&mdash;if, as some believe, he  dragged her yet living from spot to spot, demanding information as to her  places of concealment under threat of repeated blows, and, finally baffled,  dealt the finishing stroke and proceeded on the search alone, no greater  devastation could have taken place in this poor woman's house or effects. Yet  such was his precaution and care for himself that he left no finger-print  behind him nor any other token which could lead to personal identification.  Even though his footsteps could be traced in much the order I have mentioned,  they were of so indeterminate and shapeless a character as to convey little to  the intelligence of the investigator.</p>
  <p>"That  these smears (they could not be called footprints) not only crossed the hall  but appeared in more than one place on the staircase proves that he did not  confine his search to the lower storey; and perhaps one of the most interesting  features of the case lies in the indications given by these marks of the raging  course he took through these upper rooms. As the accompanying diagram will show  [we omit the diagram] he went first into the large front chamber, thence to the  rear where we find two rooms, one unfinished and filled with accumulated stuff  most of which he left lying loose upon the floor, and the other plastered, and  containing a window opening upon an alley-way at the side, but empty of all  furniture and without even a carpet on the bare boards.</p>
  <p>"Why  he should have entered the latter place, and why, having entered he should have  crossed to the window, will be plain to those who have studied the conditions.  The front chamber windows were tightly shuttered, the attic ones cumbered with  boxes and shielded from approach by old bureaus and discarded chairs. This one  only was free and, although darkened by the proximity of the house neighbouring  it across the alley, was the only spot on the storey where sufficient light  could be had at this late hour for the examination of any object of whose value  he was doubtful. That he had come across such an object and had brought it to  this window for some such purpose is very satisfactorily demonstrated by the  discovery of a worn out wallet of ancient make lying on the floor directly in  front of this window&mdash;a proof of his cupidity but also proof of his ill-luck.  For this wallet, when lifted and opened, was found to contain two hundred or  more dollars in old bills, which, if not the full hoard of their industrious  owner, was certainly worth the taking by one who had risked his neck for the  sole purpose of theft.</p>
  <p>"This  wallet, and the flight of the murderer without it, give to this affair,  otherwise simply brutal, a dramatic interest which will be appreciated not only  by the very able detectives already hot upon the chase, but by all other  inquiring minds anxious to solve a mystery of which so estimable a woman has been  the unfortunate victim. A problem is presented to the police&mdash;"</p>
  <p>There  Violet stopped.</p>
  <p>When,  not long after, the superb limousine of Peter Strange stopped before the little  house in Seventeenth Street, it caused a veritable sensation, not only in the  curiosity-mongers lingering on the sidewalk, but to the two persons within&mdash;the  officer on guard and a belated reporter.</p>
  <p>Though  dressed in her plainest suit, Violet Strange looked much too fashionable and  far too young and thoughtless to be observed, without emotion, entering a scene  of hideous and brutal crime. Even the young man who accompanied her promised to  bring a most incongruous element into this atmosphere of guilt and horror, and,  as the detective on guard whispered to the man beside him, might much better  have been left behind in the car.</p>
  <p>But  Violet was great for the proprieties and young Arthur followed her in.</p>
  <p>Her  entrance was a coup du theatre. She had lifted her veil in crossing the  sidewalk and her interesting features and general air of timidity were very  fetching. As the man holding open the door noted the impression made upon his  companion, he muttered with sly facetiousness:</p>
  <p>"You  think you'll show her nothing; but I'm ready to bet a fiver that she'll want to  see it all and that you'll show it to her."</p>
  <p>The  detective's grin was expressive, notwithstanding the shrug with which he tried  to carry it off.</p>
  <p>And  Violet? The hall into which she now stepped from the most vivid sunlight had  never been considered even in its palmiest days as possessing cheer even of the  stately kind. The ghastly green light infused through it by the coloured glass  on either side of the doorway seemed to promise yet more dismal things beyond.</p>
  <p>"Must  I go in there?" she asked, pointing, with an admirable simulation of nervous excitement,  to a half-shut door at her left. "Is there where it happened? Arthur, do you  suppose that there is where it happened?"</p>
  <p>"No,  no, Miss," the officer made haste to assure her. "If you are Miss Strange"  (Violet bowed), "I need hardly say that the woman was struck in her bedroom.  The door beside you leads into the parlour, or as she would have called it, her  work-room. You needn't be afraid of going in there. You will see nothing but  the disorder of her boxes. They were pretty well pulled about. Not all of them  though," he added, watching her as closely as the dim light permitted. "There  is one which gives no sign of having been tampered with. It was done up in  wrapping paper and is addressed to you, which in itself would not have seemed  worthy of our attention had not these lines been scribbled on it in a man's  handwriting: 'Send without opening.'"</p>
  <p>"How  odd!" exclaimed the little minx with widely opened eyes and an air of guileless  innocence. "Whatever can it mean? Nothing serious I am sure, for the woman did  not even know me. She was employed to do this work by Madame Pirot."</p>
  <p>"Didn't  you know that it was to be done here?"</p>
  <p>"No.  I thought Madame Pirot's own girls did her embroidery for her."</p>
  <p>"So  that you were surprised&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Wasn't  I!"</p>
  <p>"To  get our message."</p>
  <p>"I  didn't know what to make of it."</p>
  <p>The  earnest, half-injured look with which she uttered this disclaimer, did its  appointed work. The detective accepted her for what she seemed and, oblivious  to the reporter's satirical gesture, crossed to the work-room door, which he  threw wide open with the remark:</p>
  <p>"I  should be glad to have you open that box in our presence. It is undoubtedly all  right, but we wish to be sure. You know what the box should contain?"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  yes, indeed; pillow-cases and sheets, with a big S embroidered on them."</p>
  <p>"Very  well. Shall I undo the string for you?"</p>
  <p>"I  shall be much obliged," said she, her eye flashing quickly about the room  before settling down upon the knot he was deftly loosening.</p>
  <p>Her  brother, gazing indifferently in from the doorway, hardly noticed this look;  but the reporter at his back did, though he failed to detect its penetrating  quality.</p>
  <p>"Your  name is on the other side," observed the detective as he drew away the string  and turned the package over.</p>
  <p>The  smile which just lifted the corner of her lips was not in answer to this  remark, but to her recognition of her employer's handwriting in the words under  her name: Send without opening. She had not misjudged him.</p>
  <p>"The  cover you may like to take off yourself," suggested the officer, as he lifted  the box out of its wrapper.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  I don't mind. There's nothing to be ashamed of in embroidered linen. Or perhaps  that is not what you are looking for?"</p>
  <p>No  one answered. All were busy watching her whip off the lid and lift out the pile  of sheets and pillow-cases with which the box was closely packed.</p>
  <p>"Shall  I unfold them?" she asked.</p>
  <p>The  detective nodded.</p>
  <p>Taking  out the topmost sheet, she shook it open. Then the next and the next till she  reached the bottom of the box. Nothing of a criminating nature came to light.  The box as well as its contents was without mystery of any kind. This was not  an unexpected result of course, but the smile with which she began to refold  the pieces and throw them back into the box, revealed one of her dimples which  was almost as dangerous to the casual observer as when it revealed both.</p>
  <p>"There,"  she exclaimed, "you see! Household linen exactly as I said. Now may I go home?"</p>
  <p>"Certainly,  Miss Strange."</p>
  <p>The  detective stole a sly glance at the reporter. She was not going in for the  horrors then after all.</p>
  <p>But  the reporter abated nothing of his knowing air, for while she spoke of going,  she made no move towards doing so, but continued to look about the room till  her glances finally settled on a long dark curtain shutting off an adjoining  room.</p>
  <p>"There's  where she lies, I suppose," she feelingly exclaimed. "And not one of you knows  who killed her. Somehow, I cannot understand that. Why don't you know when  that's what you're hired for?" The innocence with which she uttered this was  astonishing. The detective began to look sheepish and the reporter turned aside  to hide his smile. Whether in another moment either would have spoken no one  can say, for, with a mock consciousness of having said something foolish, she  caught up her parasol from the table and made a start for the door.</p>
  <p>But  of course she looked back.</p>
  <p>"I  was wondering," she recommenced, with a half wistful, half speculative air,  "whether I should ask to have a peep at the place where it all happened."</p>
  <p>The  reporter chuckled behind the pencil-end he was chewing, but the officer  maintained his solemn air, for which act of self-restraint he was undoubtedly  grateful when in another minute she gave a quick impulsive shudder not  altogether assumed, and vehemently added: "But I couldn't stand the sight; no,  I couldn't! I'm an awful coward when it comes to things like that. Nothing in  all the world would induce me to look at the woman or her room. But I should  like&mdash;" here both her dimples came into play though she could not be said  exactly to smile&mdash;"just one little look upstairs, where he went poking about so  long without any fear it seems of being interrupted. Ever since I've read about  it I have seen, in my mind, a picture of his wicked figure sneaking from room  to room, tearing open drawers and flinging out the contents of closets just to  find a little money&mdash;a little, little money! I shall not sleep to-night just for  wondering how those high up attic rooms really look."</p>
  <p>Who  could dream that back of this display of mingled childishness and audacity  there lay hidden purpose, intellect, and a keen knowledge of human nature. Not  the two men who listened to this seemingly irresponsible chatter. To them she  was a child to be humoured and humour her they did. The dainty feet which had  already found their way to that gloomy staircase were allowed to ascend,  followed it is true by those of the officer who did not dare to smile back at  the reporter because of the brother's watchful and none too conciliatory eye.</p>
  <p>At  the stair head she paused to look back.</p>
  <p>"I  don't see those horrible marks which the papers describe as running all along  the lower hall and up these stairs."</p>
  <p>"No,  Miss Strange; they have gradually been rubbed out, but you will find some still  showing on these upper floors."</p>
  <p>"Oh!  oh! where? You frighten me&mdash;frighten me horribly! But&mdash;but&mdash;if you don't mind, I  should like to see."</p>
  <p>Why  should not a man on a tedious job amuse himself? Piloting her over to the small  room in the rear, he pointed down at the boards. She gave one look and then  stepped gingerly in.</p>
  <p>"Just  look!" she cried; "a whole string of marks going straight from door to window.  They have no shape, have they,&mdash;just blotches? I wonder why one of them is so  much larger than the rest?"</p>
  <p>This  was no new question. It was one which everybody who went into the room was sure  to ask, there was such a difference in the size and appearance of the mark  nearest the window. The reason&mdash;well, minds were divided about that, and no one  had a satisfactory theory. The detective therefore kept discreetly silent.</p>
  <p>This  did not seem to offend Miss Strange. On the contrary it gave her an opportunity  to babble away to her heart's content.</p>
  <p>"One,  two, three, four, five, six," she counted, with a shudder at every count. "And  one of them bigger than the others." She might have added, "It is the trail of  one foot, and strangely, intermingled at that," but she did not, though we may  be quite sure that she noted the fact. "And where, just where did the old  wallet fall? Here? or here?"</p>
  <p>She  had moved as she spoke, so that in uttering the last "here," she stood directly  before the window. The surprise she received there nearly made her forget the  part she was playing. From the character of the light in the room, she had  expected, on looking out, to confront a near-by wall, but not a window in that  wall. Yet that was what she saw directly facing her from across the  old-fashioned alley separating this house from its neighbour; twelve  unshuttered and uncurtained panes through which she caught a darkened view of a  room almost as forlorn and devoid of furniture as the one in which she then  stood.</p>
  <p>When  quite sure of herself, she let a certain portion of her surprise appear.</p>
  <p>"Why,  look!" she cried, "if you can't see right in next door! What a lonesome-looking  place! From its desolate appearance I should think the house quite empty."</p>
  <p>"And  it is. That's the old Shaffer homestead. It's been empty for a year."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  empty!" And she turned away, with the most inconsequent air in the world,  crying out as her name rang up the stair, "There's Arthur calling. I suppose he  thinks I've been here long enough. I'm sure I'm very much obliged to you,  officer. I really shouldn't have slept a wink to-night, if I hadn't been given  a peep at these rooms, which I had imagined so different." And with one  additional glance over her shoulder, that seemed to penetrate both windows and  the desolate space beyond, she ran quickly out and down in response to her  brother's reiterated call.</p>
  <p>"Drive  quickly!&mdash;as quickly as the law allows, to Hiram Brown's office in Duane  Street."</p>
  <p>Arrived  at the address named, she went in alone to see Mr. Brown. He was her father's  lawyer and a family friend.</p>
  <p>Hardly  waiting for his affectionate greeting, she cried out quickly. "Tell me how I  can learn anything about the old Shaffer house in Seventeenth Street. Now,  don't look so surprised. I have very good reasons for my request and&mdash;and&mdash;I'm in  an awful hurry."</p>
  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  know, I know; there's been a dreadful tragedy next door to it; but it's about  the Shaffer house itself I want some information. Has it an agent, a&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Of  course it has an agent, and here is his name."</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brown presented her with a card on which he had hastily written both name and  address.</p>
  <p>She  thanked him, dropped him a mocking curtsey full of charm, whispered "Don't tell  father," and was gone.</p>
  <p>Her  manner to the man she next interviewed was very different. As soon as she saw  him she subsided into her usual society manner. With just a touch of the  conceit of the successful debutante, she announced herself as Miss Strange of  Seventy-second Street. Her business with him was in regard to the possible  renting of the Shaffer house. She had an old lady friend who was desirous of  living downtown.</p>
  <p>In  passing through Seventeenth Street, she had noticed that the old Shaffer house  was standing empty and had been immediately struck with the advantages it  possessed for her elderly friend's occupancy. Could it be that the house was  for rent? There was no sign on it to that effect, but&mdash;etc.</p>
  <p>His  answer left her nothing to hope for.</p>
  <p>"It  is going to be torn down," he said.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  what a pity!" she exclaimed. "Real colonial, isn't it! I wish I could see the  rooms inside before it is disturbed. Such doors and such dear old-fashioned  mantelpieces as it must have! I just dote on the Colonial. It brings up such  pictures of the old days; weddings, you know, and parties;&mdash;all so different  from ours and so much more interesting."</p>
  <p>Is  it the chance shot that tells? Sometimes. Violet had no especial intention in  what she said save as a prelude to a pending request, but nothing could have  served her purpose better than that one word, wedding. The agent laughed and  giving her his first indulgent look, remarked genially:</p>
  <p>"Romance  is not confined to those ancient times. If you were to enter that house to-day  you would come across evidences of a wedding as romantic as any which ever took  place in all the seventy odd years of its existence. A man and a woman were  married there day before yesterday who did their first courting under its roof  forty years ago. He has been married twice and she once in the interval; but  the old love held firm and now at the age of sixty and over they have come  together to finish their days in peace and happiness. Or so we will hope."</p>
  <p>"Married!  married in that house and on the day that&mdash;"</p>
  <p>She  caught herself up in time. He did not notice the break.</p>
  <p>"Yes,  in memory of those old days of courtship, I suppose. They came here about five,  got the keys, drove off, went through the ceremony in that empty house,  returned the keys to me in my own apartment, took the steamer for Naples, and  were on the sea before midnight. Do you not call that quick work as well as  highly romantic?"</p>
  <p>"Very."  Miss Strange's cheek had paled. It was apt to when she was greatly excited.  "But I don't understand," she added, the moment after. "How could they do this  and nobody know about it? I should have thought it would have got into the  papers."</p>
  <p>"They  are quiet people. I don't think they told their best friends. A simple  announcement in the next day's journals testified to the fact of their  marriage, but that was all. I would not have felt at liberty to mention the  circumstances myself, if the parties were not well on their way to Europe."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  how glad I am that you did tell me! Such a story of constancy and the hold which  old associations have upon sensitive minds! But&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Why,  Miss? What's the matter? You look very much disturbed."</p>
  <p>"Don't  you remember? Haven't you thought? Something else happened that very day and  almost at the same time on that block. Something very dreadful&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Mrs.  Doolittle's murder?"</p>
  <p>"Yes.  It was as near as next door, wasn't it? Oh, if this happy couple had known&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"But  fortunately they didn't. Nor are they likely to, till they reach the other  side. You needn't fear that their honeymoon will be spoiled that way."</p>
  <p>"But  they may have heard something or seen something before leaving the street. Did  you notice how the gentleman looked when he returned you the keys?"</p>
  <p>"I  did, and there was no cloud on his satisfaction."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  how you relieve me!" One&mdash;two dimples made their appearance in Miss Strange's  fresh, young cheeks. "Well! I wish them joy. Do you mind telling me their  names? I cannot think of them as actual persons without knowing their names."</p>
  <p>"The  gentleman was Constantin Amidon; the lady, Marian Shaffer. You will have to  think of them now as Mr. and Mrs. Amidon."</p>
  <p>"And  I will. Thank you, Mr. Hutton, thank you very much. Next to the pleasure of  getting the house for my friend, is that of hearing this charming bit of news  its connection."</p>
  <p>She  held out her hand and, as he took it, remarked:</p>
  <p>"They  must have had a clergyman and witnesses."</p>
  <p>"Undoubtedly."</p>
  <p>"I  wish I had been one of the witnesses," she sighed sentimentally.</p>
  <p>"They  were two old men."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  no! Don't tell me that."</p>
  <p>"Fogies;  nothing less."</p>
  <p>"But  the clergyman? He must have been young. Surely there was some one there capable  of appreciating the situation?"</p>
  <p>"I  can't say about that; I did not see the clergyman."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  well! it doesn't matter." Miss Strange's manner was as nonchalant as it was  charming. "We will think of him as being very young."</p>
  <p>And  with a merry toss of her head she flitted away.</p>
  <p>But  she sobered very rapidly upon entering her limousine.</p>
  <p>"Hello!"</p>
  <p>"Ah,  is that you?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  I want a Marconi sent."</p>
  <p>"A  Marconi?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  to the Cretic, which left dock the very night in which we are so deeply  interested."</p>
  <p>"Good.  Whom to? The Captain?"</p>
  <p>"No,  to a Mrs. Constantin Amidon. But first be sure there is such a passenger."</p>
  <p>"Mrs.!  What idea have you there?"</p>
  <p>"Excuse  my not stating over the telephone. The message is to be to this effect. Did she  at any time immediately before or after her marriage to Mr. Amidon get a  glimpse of any one in the adjoining house? No remarks, please. I use the  telephone because I am not ready to explain myself. If she did, let her send a  written description to you of that person as soon as she reaches the Azores."</p>
  <p>"You  surprise me. May I not call or hope for a line from you early to-morrow?"</p>
  <p>"I  shall be busy till you get your answer."</p>
  <p>He  hung up the receiver. He recognized the resolute tone.</p>
  <p>But  the time came when the pending explanation was fully given to him. An answer  had been returned from the steamer, favourable to Violet's hopes. Mrs. Amidon  had seen such a person and would send a full description of the same at the  first opportunity. It was news to fill Violet's heart with pride; the filament  of a clue which had led to this great result had been so nearly invisible and  had felt so like nothing in her grasp.</p>
  <p>To  her employer she described it as follows:</p>
  <p>"When  I hear or read of a case which contains any baffling features, I am apt to feel  some hidden chord in my nature thrill to one fact in it and not to any of the  others. In this case the single fact which appealed to my imagination was the  dropping of the stolen wallet in that upstairs room. Why did the guilty man  drop it? and why, having dropped it, did he not pick it up again? but one  answer seemed possible. He had heard or seen something at the spot where it  fell which not only alarmed him but sent him in flight from the house."</p>
  <p>"Very  good; and did you settle to your own mind the nature of that sound or that  sight?"</p>
  <p>"I  did." Her manner was strangely businesslike. No show of dimples now. "Satisfied  that if any possibility remained of my ever doing this, it would have to be on  the exact place of this occurrence or not at all, I embraced your suggestion  and visited the house."</p>
  <p>"And  that room no doubt."</p>
  <p>"And  that room. Women, somehow, seem to manage such things."</p>
  <p>"So  I've noticed, Miss Strange. And what was the result of your visit? What did you  discover there?"</p>
  <p>"This:  that one of the blood spots marking the criminal's steps through the room was  decidedly more pronounced than the rest; and, what was even more important,  that the window out of which I was looking had its counterpart in the house on  the opposite side of the alley. In gazing through the one I was gazing through  the other; and not only that, but into the darkened area of the room beyond.  Instantly I saw how the latter fact might be made to explain the former one.  But before I say how, let me ask if it is quite settled among you that the  smears on the floor and stairs mark the passage of the criminal's footsteps!"</p>
  <p>"Certainly;  and very bloody feet they must have been too. His shoes&mdash;or rather his one  shoe&mdash;for the proof is plain that only the right one left its mark&mdash;must have  become thoroughly saturated to carry its traces so far."</p>
  <p>"Do  you think that any amount of saturation would have done this? Or, if you are  not ready to agree to that, that a shoe so covered with blood could have failed  to leave behind it some hint of its shape, some imprint, however faint, of heel  or toe? But nowhere did it do this. We see a smear&mdash;and that is all."</p>
  <p>"You  are right, Miss Strange; you are always right. And what do you gather from  this?"</p>
  <p>She  looked to see how much he expected from her, and, meeting an eye not quite as  free from ironic suggestion as his words had led her to expect, faltered a  little as she proceeded to say:</p>
  <p>"My  opinion is a girl's opinion, but such as it is you have the right to have it.  From the indications mentioned I could draw but this conclusion: that the blood  which accompanied the criminal's footsteps was not carried through the house by  his shoes;&mdash;he wore no shoes; he did not even wear stockings; probably he had  none. For reasons which appealed to his judgment, he went about his wicked work  barefoot; and it was the blood from his own veins and not from those of his  victim which made the trail we have followed with so much interest. Do you  forget those broken beads;&mdash;how he kicked them about and stamped upon them in  his fury? One of them pierced the ball of his foot, and that so sharply that it  not only spurted blood but kept on bleeding with every step he took. Otherwise,  the trail would have been lost after his passage up the stairs."</p>
  <p>"Fine!"  There was no irony in the bureau-chief's eye now. "You are progressing, Miss  Strange. Allow me, I pray, to kiss your hand. It is a liberty I have never  taken, but one which would greatly relieve my present stress of feeling."</p>
  <p>She  lifted her hand toward him, but it was in gesture, not in recognition of his  homage.</p>
  <p>"Thank  you," said she, "but I claim no monopoly on deductions so simple as these. I  have not the least doubt that not only yourself but every member of the force  has made the same. But there is a little matter which may have escaped the  police, may even have escaped you. To that I would now call your attention  since through it I have been enabled, after a little necessary groping, to  reach the open. You remember the one large blotch on the upper floor where the  man dropped the wallet? That blotch, more or less commingled with a fainter  one, possessed great significance for me from the first moment I saw it. How  came his foot to bleed so much more profusely at that one spot than at any other?  There could be but one answer: because here a surprise met him&mdash;a surprise so  startling to him in his present state of mind, that he gave a quick spring  backward, with the result that his wounded foot came down suddenly and forcibly  instead of easily as in his previous wary tread. And what was the surprise? I  made it my business to find out, and now I can tell you that it was the sight  of a woman's face staring upon him from the neighbouring house which he had  probably been told was empty. The shock disturbed his judgment. He saw his  crime discovered&mdash;his guilty secret read, and fled in unreasoning panic. He  might better have held on to his wits. It was this display of fear which led me  to search after its cause, and consequently to discover that at this especial  hour more than one person had been in the Shaffer house; that, in fact, a  marriage had been celebrated there under circumstances as romantic as any we  read of in books, and that this marriage, privately carried out, had been  followed by an immediate voyage of the happy couple on one of the White Star  steamers. With the rest you are conversant. I do not need to say anything about  what has followed the sending of that Marconi."</p>
  <p>"But  I am going to say something about your work in this matter, Miss Strange. The  big detectives about here will have to look sharp if&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Don't,  please! Not yet." A smile softened the asperity of this interruption. "The man  has yet to be caught and identified. Till that is done I cannot enjoy any one's  congratulations. And you will see that all this may not be so easy. If no one  happened to meet the desperate wretch before he had an opportunity to retie his  shoe-laces, there will be little for you or even for the police to go upon but  his wounded foot, his undoubtedly carefully prepared alibi, and later, a  woman's confused description of a face seen but for a moment only and that  under a personal excitement precluding minute attention. I should not be  surprised if the whole thing came to nothing."</p>
  <p>But  it did not. As soon as the description was received from Mrs. Amidon (a  description, by the way, which was unusually clear and precise, owing to the  peculiar and contradictory features of the man), the police were able to  recognize him among the many suspects always under their eye. Arrested, he  pleaded, just as Miss Strange had foretold, an alibi of a seemingly  unimpeachable character; but neither it, nor the plausible explanation with  which he endeavoured to account for a freshly healed scar amid the callouses of  his right foot, could stand before Mrs. Amidon's unequivocal testimony that he  was the same man she had seen in Mrs. Doolittle's upper room on the afternoon  of her own happiness and of that poor woman's murder.</p>
  <p>The  moment when, at his trial, the two faces again confronted each other across a  space no wider than that which had separated them on the dread occasion in  Seventeenth Street, is said to have been one of the most dramatic in the annals  of that ancient court room.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>End Of Problem  III</b></p>
  <h2 align="center"><br>
      <b><a name="IV"></a>Problem IV <br>
        The Grotto Spectre</b></h2>
  <p>Miss  Strange was not often pensive&mdash;at least not at large functions or when under the  public eye. But she certainly forgot herself at Mrs. Provost's musicale and  that, too, without apparent reason. Had the music been of a high order one  might have understood her abstraction; but it was of a decidedly mediocre  quality, and Violet's ear was much too fine and her musical sense too  cultivated for her to be beguiled by anything less than the very best.</p>
  <p>Nor  had she the excuse of a dull companion. Her escort for the evening was a man of  unusual conversational powers; but she seemed to be almost oblivious of his  presence; and when, through some passing courteous impulse, she did turn her  ear his way, it was with just that tinge of preoccupation which betrays the divided  mind.</p>
  <p>Were  her thoughts with some secret problem yet unsolved? It would scarcely seem so  from the gay remark with which she had left home. She was speaking to her  brother and her words were: "I am going out to enjoy myself. I've not a care in  the world. The slate is quite clean." Yet she had never seemed more out of tune  with her surroundings nor shown a mood further removed from trivial  entertainment. What had happened to becloud her gaiety in the short time which  had since elapsed?</p>
  <p>We  can answer in a sentence.</p>
  <p>She  had seen, among a group of young men in a distant doorway, one with a face so  individual and of an expression so extraordinary that all interest in the  people about her had stopped as a clock stops when the pendulum is held back.  She could see nothing else, think of nothing else. Not that it was so very  handsome&mdash;though no other had ever approached it in its power over her  imagination&mdash;but because of its expression of haunting melancholy,&mdash;a melancholy  so settled and so evidently the result of long-continued sorrow that her  interest had been reached and her heartstrings shaken as never before in her  whole life.</p>
  <p>She  would never be the same Violet again.</p>
  <p>Yet  moved as she undoubtedly was, she was not conscious of the least desire to know  who the young man was, or even to be made acquainted with his story. She simply  wanted to dream her dream undisturbed.</p>
  <p>It  was therefore with a sense of unwelcome shock that, in the course of the  reception following the programme, she perceived this fine young man approaching  herself, with his right hand touching his left shoulder in the peculiar way  which committed her to an interview with or without a formal introduction.</p>
  <p>Should  she fly the ordeal? Be blind and deaf to whatever was significant in his  action, and go her way before he reached her; thus keeping her dream intact?  Impossible. His eye prevented that. His glance had caught hers and she felt  forced to await his advance and give him her first spare moment.</p>
  <p>It  came soon, and when it came she greeted him with a smile. It was the first she  had ever bestowed in welcome of a confidence of whose tenor she was entirely  ignorant.</p>
  <p>To  her relief he showed his appreciation of the dazzling gift though he made no  effort to return it. Scorning all preliminaries in his eagerness to discharge  himself of a burden which was fast becoming intolerable, he addressed her at  once in these words:</p>
  <p>"You  are very good, Miss Strange, to receive me in this unconventional fashion. I am  in that desperate state of mind which precludes etiquette. Will you listen to  my petition? I am told&mdash;you know by whom&mdash;"(and he again touched his shoulder)  "that you have resources of intelligence which especially fit you to meet the  extraordinary difficulties of my position. May I beg you to exercise them in my  behalf? No man would be more grateful if&mdash;But I see that you do not recognize  me. I am Roger Upjohn. That I am admitted to this gathering is owing to the  fact that our hostess knew and loved my mother. In my anxiety to meet you and  proffer my plea, I was willing to brave the cold looks you have probably  noticed on the faces of the people about us. But I have no right to subject you  to criticism. I&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Remain."  Violet's voice was troubled, her self-possession disturbed; but there was a  command in her tone which he was only too glad to obey. "I know the name" (who  did not!) "and possibly my duty to myself should make me shun a confidence  which may burden me without relieving you. But you have been sent to me by one  whose behests I feel bound to respect and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Mistrusting  her voice, she stopped. The suffering which made itself apparent in the face  before her appealed to her heart in a way to rob her of her judgment. She did  not wish this to be seen, and so fell silent.</p>
  <p>He  was quick to take advantage of her obvious embarrassment. "Should I have been  sent to you if I had not first secured the confidence of the sender? You know  the scandal attached to my name, some of it just, some of it very unjust. If  you will grant me an interview to-morrow, I will make an endeavour to refute  certain charges which I have hitherto let go unchallenged. Will you do me this  favour? Will you listen in your own house to what I have to say?"</p>
  <p>Instinct  cried out against any such concession on her part, bidding her beware of one  who charmed without excellence and convinced without reason. But compassion  urged compliance and compassion won the day. Though conscious of weakness,&mdash;she,  Violet Strange on whom strong men had come to rely in critical hours calling  for well-balanced judgment,&mdash;she did not let this concern her, or allow herself  to indulge in useless regrets even after the first effect of his presence had  passed and she had succeeded in recalling the facts which had cast a cloud  about his name.</p>
  <p>Roger  Upjohn was a widower, and the scandal affecting him was connected with his  wife's death.</p>
  <p>Though  a degenerate in some respects, lacking the domineering presence, the strong  mental qualities, and inflexible character of his progenitors, the wealthy  Massachusetts Upjohns whose great place on the coast had a history as old as  the State itself, he yet had gifts and attractions of his own which would have  made him a worthy representative of his race, if only he had not fixed his  affections on a woman so cold and heedless that she would have inspired universal  aversion instead of love, had she not been dowered with the beauty and physical  fascination which sometimes accompany a hard heart and a scheming brain. It was  this beauty which had caught the lad; and one day, just as the careful father  had mapped out a course of study calculated to make a man of his son, that son  drove up to the gates with this lady whom he introduced as his wife.</p>
  <p>The  shock, not of her beauty, though that was of the dazzling quality which catches  a man in the throat and makes a slave of him while the first surprise lasts,  but of the overthrow of all his hopes and plans, nearly prostrated Homer  Upjohn. He saw, as most men did the moment judgment returned, that for all her  satin skin and rosy flush, the wonder of her hair and the smile which pierced  like arrows and warmed like wine, she was more likely to bring a curse into the  house than a blessing.</p>
  <p>And  so it proved. In less than a year the young husband had lost all his ambitions  and many of his best impulses. No longer inclined to study, he spent his days  in satisfying his wife's whims and his evenings in carousing with the friends  with which she had provided him. This in Boston whither they had fled from the  old gentleman's displeasure; but after their little son came the father insisted  upon their returning home, which led to great deceptions, and precipitated a  tragedy no one ever understood. They were natural gamblers&mdash;this couple&mdash;as all  Boston society knew; and as Homer Upjohn loathed cards, they found life slow in  the great house and grew correspondingly restless till they made a discovery&mdash;or  shall I say a rediscovery&mdash;of the once famous grotto hidden in the rocks lining  their portion of the coast. Here they found a retreat where they could hide  themselves (often when they were thought to be abed and asleep) and play  together for money or for a supper in the city or for anything else that  foolish fancy suggested. This was while their little son remained an infant;  later, they were less easily satisfied. Both craved company, excitement, and  gambling on a large scale; so they took to inviting friends to meet them in  this grotto which, through the agency of one old servant devoted to Roger to  the point of folly, had been fitted up and lighted in a manner not only  comfortable but luxurious. A small but sheltered haven hidden in the curve of  the rocks made an approach by boat feasible at high tide; and at low the  connection could be made by means of a path over the promontory in which this  grotto lay concealed. The fortune which Roger had inherited from his mother  made these excesses possible, but many thousands, let alone the few he could  call his, soon disappeared under the witchery of an irresponsible woman, and  the half-dozen friends who knew his secret had to stand by and see his ruin,  without daring to utter a word to the one who alone could stay it. For Homer  Upjohn was not a man to be approached lightly, nor was he one to listen to  charges without ocular proof to support them; and this called for courage, more  courage than was possessed by any one who knew them both.</p>
  <p>He  was a hard man was Homer Upjohn, but with a heart of gold for those he loved.  This, even his wary daughter-in-law was wise enough to detect, and for a long  while after the birth of her child she besieged him with her coaxing ways and  bewitching graces. But he never changed his first opinion of her, and once she  became fully convinced of the folly of her efforts, she gave up all attempt to  please him and showed an open indifference. This in time gradually extended till  it embraced not only her child but her husband as well. Yes, it had come to  that. His love no longer contented her. Her vanity had grown by what it daily  fed on, and now called for the admiration of the fast men who sometimes came up  from Boston to play with them in their unholy retreat. To win this, she dressed  like some demon queen or witch, though it drove her husband into deeper play  and threatened an exposure which would mean disaster not only to herself but to  the whole family.</p>
  <p>In  all this, as any one could see, Roger had been her slave and the willing victim  of all her caprices. What was it, then, which so completely changed him that a  separation began to be talked of and even its terms discussed? One rumour had  it that the father had discovered the secret of the grotto and exacted this as  a penalty from the son who had dishonoured him. Another, that Roger himself was  the one to take the initiative in this matter: That, on returning unexpectedly  from New York one evening and finding her missing from the house, he had traced  her to the grotto where he came upon her playing a desperate game with the one  man he had the greatest reason to distrust.</p>
  <p>But  whatever the explanation of this sudden change in their relations, there is but  little doubt that a legal separation between this ill-assorted couple was  pending, when one bleak autumn morning she was discovered dead in her bed under  circumstances peculiarly open to comment.</p>
  <p>The  physicians who made out the certificate ascribed her death to heart-disease,  symptoms of which had lately much alarmed the family doctor; but that a  personal struggle of some kind had preceded the fatal attack was evident from  the bruises which blackened her wrists. Had there been the like upon her throat  it might have gone hard with the young husband who was known to be  contemplating her dismissal from the house. But the discoloration of her wrists  was all, and as bruised wrists do not kill and there was besides no evidence  forthcoming of the two having spent one moment together for at least ten hours  preceding the tragedy but rather full and satisfactory testimony to the  contrary, the matter lapsed and all criminal proceedings were avoided.</p>
  <p>But  not the scandal which always follows the unexplained. As time passed and the  peculiar look which betrays the haunted soul gradually became visible in the  young widower's eyes, doubts arose and reports circulated which cast strange  reflections upon the tragic end of his mistaken marriage. Stories of the  disreputable use to which the old grotto had been put were mingled with vague  hints of conjugal violence never properly investigated. The result was his  general avoidance not only by the social set dominated by his high-minded  father, but by his own less reputable coterie, which, however lax in its moral  code, had very little use for a coward.</p>
  <p>Such  was the gossip which had reached Violet's ears in connection with this new  client, prejudicing her altogether against him till she caught that beam of  deep and concentrated suffering in his eye and recognized an innocence which  ensured her sympathy and led her to grant him the interview for which he so  earnestly entreated.</p>
  <p>He  came prompt to the hour, and when she saw him again with the marks of a  sleepless night upon him and all the signs of suffering intensified in his  unusual countenance, she felt her heart sink within her in a way she failed to  understand. A dread of what she was about to hear robbed her of all semblance  of self-possession, and she stood like one in a dream as he uttered his first  greetings and then paused to gather up his own moral strength before he began  his story. When he did speak it was to say:</p>
  <p>"I  find myself obliged to break a vow I have made to myself. You cannot understand  my need unless I show you my heart. My trouble is not the one with which men  have credited me. It has another source and is infinitely harder to bear.  Personal dishonour I have deserved in a greater or less degree, but the trial  which has come to me now involves a person more dear to me than myself, and is  totally without alleviation unless you&mdash;" He paused, choked, then recommenced  abruptly: "My wife"&mdash;Violet held her breath&mdash;"was supposed to have died from  heart-disease or&mdash;or some strange species of suicide. There were reasons for  this conclusion&mdash;reasons which I accepted without serious question till some  five weeks ago when I made a discovery which led me to fear&mdash;"</p>
  <p>The  broken sentence hung suspended. Violet, notwithstanding his hurried gesture,  could not restrain herself from stealing a look at his face. It was set in  horror and, though partially turned aside, made an appeal to her compassion to  fill the void made by his silence, without further suggestion from him.</p>
  <p>She  did this by saying tentatively and with as little show of emotion as possible:</p>
  <p>"You  feared that the event called for vengeance and that vengeance would mean  increased suffering to yourself as well as to another?"</p>
  <p>"Yes;  great suffering. But I may be under a most lamentable mistake. I am not sure of  my conclusions. If my doubts have no real foundation&mdash;if they are simply the  offspring of my own diseased imagination, what an insult to one I revere! What  a horror of ingratitude and misunderstanding&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Relate  the facts," came in startled tones from Violet. "They may enlighten us."</p>
  <p>He  gave one quick shudder, buried his face for one moment in his hands, then  lifted it and spoke up quickly and with unexpected firmness:</p>
  <p>"I  came here to do so and do so I will. But where begin? Miss Strange, you cannot  be ignorant of the circumstances, open and avowed, which attended my wife's  death. But there were other and secret events in its connection which happily  have been kept from the world, but which I must now disclose to you at any cost  to my pride and so-called honour. This is the first one: On the morning  preceding the day of Mrs. Upjohn's death, an interview took place between us at  which my father was present. You do not know my father, Miss Strange. A strong  man and a stern one, with a hold upon old traditions which nothing can shake.  If he has a weakness it is for my little boy Roger in whose promising traits he  sees the one hope which has survived the shipwreck of all for which our name  has stood. Knowing this, and realizing what the child's presence in the house  meant to his old age, I felt my heart turn sick with apprehension, when in the  midst of the discussion as to the terms on which my wife would consent to a  permanent separation, the little fellow came dancing into the room, his curls  atoss and his whole face beaming with life and joy.</p>
  <p>"She  had not mentioned the child, but I knew her well enough to be sure that at the  first show of preference on his part for either his grandfather or myself, she  would raise a claim to him which she would never relinquish. I dared not speak,  but I met his eager looks with my most forbidding frown and hoped by this show  of severity to hold him back. But his little heart was full and, ignoring her  outstretched arms, he bounded towards mine with his most affectionate cry. She  saw and uttered her ultimatum. The child should go with her or she would not  consent to a separation. It was useless for us to talk; she had said her last  word. The blow struck me hard, or so I thought, till I looked at my father.  Never had I beheld such a change as that one moment had made in him. He stood  as before; he faced us with the same silent reprobation; but his heart had run  from him like water.</p>
  <p>"It  was a sight to call up all my resources. To allow her to remain now, with my  feelings towards her all changed and my father's eyes fully opened to her stony  nature, was impossible. Nor could I appeal to law. An open scandal was my  father's greatest dread and divorce proceedings his horror. The child would  have to go unless I could find a way to influence her through her own nature. I  knew of but one&mdash;do not look at me, Miss Strange. It was dishonouring to us  both, and I'm horrified now when I think of it. But to me at that time it was  natural enough as a last resort. There was but one debt which my wife ever  paid, but one promise she ever kept. It was that made at the gaming-table. I  offered, as soon as my father, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, had  gone tottering from the room, to gamble with her for the child.</p>
  <p>"And  she accepted."</p>
  <p>The  shame and humiliation expressed in this final whisper; the sudden darkness&mdash;for  a storm was coming up&mdash;shook Violet to the soul. With strained gaze fixed on the  man before her, now little more than a shadow in the prevailing gloom, she  waited for him to resume, and waited in vain. The minutes passed, the darkness  became intolerable, and instinctively her hand crept towards the electric  button beneath which she was sitting. But she failed to press it. A tale so  dark called for an atmosphere of its own kind. She would cast no light upon it.  Yet she shivered as the silence continued, and started in uncontrollable dismay  when at length her strange visitor rose, and still, without speaking, walked  away from her to the other end of the room. Only so could he go on with the  shameful tale; and presently she heard his voice once more in these words:</p>
  <p>"Our  house is large and its rooms many; but for such work as we two contemplated  there was but one spot where we could command absolute seclusion. You may have  heard of it, a famous natural grotto hidden in our own portion of the coast and  so fitted up as to form a retreat for our miserable selves when escape from my  father's eye seemed desirable. It was not easy of access, and no one, so far as  we knew, had ever followed us there.</p>
  <p>"But  to ensure ourselves against any possible interruption, we waited till the whole  house was abed before we left it for the grotto. We went by boat and oh! the  dip of those oars! I hear them yet. And the witchery of her face in the  moonlight; and the mockery of her low fitful laugh! As I caught the sinister note  in its silvery rise and fall, I knew what was before me if I failed to retain  my composure. And I strove to hold it and to meet her calmness with stoicism  and the taunt of her expression with a mask of immobility. But the effort was  hopeless, and when the time came for dealing out the cards, my eyes were  burning in their sockets and my hands shivering like leaves in a rising gale.</p>
  <p>"We  played one game&mdash;and my wife lost. We played another&mdash;and my wife won. We played  the third&mdash;and the fate I had foreseen from the first became mine. The luck was  with her, and I had lost my boy!"</p>
  <p>A  gasp&mdash;a pause, during which the thunder spoke and the lightning flashed,&mdash;then a  hurried catching of his breath and the tale went on.</p>
  <p>"A  burst of laughter, rising gaily above the boom of the sea, announced her  victory&mdash;her laugh and the taunting words: 'You play badly, Roger. The child is  mine. Never fear that I shall fail to teach him to revere his father.' Had I a  word to throw back? No. When I realized anything but my dishonoured manhood, I  found myself in the grotto's mouth staring helplessly out upon the sea. The  boat which had floated us in at high tide lay stranded but a few feet away, but  I did not reach for it. Escape was quicker over the rocks, and I made for the  rocks.</p>
  <p>"That  it was a cowardly act to leave her there to find her way back alone at midnight  by the same rough road I was taking, did not strike my mind for an instant. I  was in flight from my own past; in flight from myself and the haunting dread of  madness. When I awoke to reality again it was to find the small door, by which  we had left the house, standing slightly ajar. I was troubled by this, for I  was sure of having closed it. But the impression was brief, and entering, I  went stumbling up to my room, leaving the way open behind me more from sheer  inability to exercise my will than from any thought of her.</p>
  <p>"Miss  Strange" (he had come out of the shadows and was standing now directly before  her), "I must ask you to trust implicitly in what I tell you of my further  experiences that fatal night. It was not necessary for me to pass my little  son's door in order to reach the room I was making for; but anguish took me  there and held me glued to the panels for what seemed a long, long time. When I  finally crept away it was to go to the room I had chosen in the top of the  house, where I had my hour of hell and faced my desolated future. Did I hear  anything meantime in the halls below? No. Did I even listen for the sound of  her return? No. I was callous to everything, dead to everything but my own  misery. I did not even heed the approach of morning, till suddenly, with a  shrillness no ear could ignore, there rose, tearing through the silence of the  house, that great scream from my wife's room which announced the discovery of  her body lying stark and cold in her bed.</p>
  <p>"They  said I showed little feeling." He had moved off again and spoke from somewhere  in the shadows. "Do you wonder at this after such a manifest stroke by a  benevolent Providence? My wife being dead, Roger was saved to us! It was the  one song of my still undisciplined soul, and I had to assume coldness lest they  should see the greatness of my joy. A wicked and guilty rejoicing you will say,  and you are right. But I had no memory then of the part I had played in this fatality.  I had forgotten my reckless flight from the grotto, which left her with no aid  but that of her own triumphant spirit to help her over those treacherous rocks.  The necessity for keeping secret this part of our disgraceful story led me to  exert myself to keep it out of my own mind. It has only come back to me in all  its force since a new horror, a new suspicion, has driven me to review  carefully every incident of that awful night.</p>
  <p>"I  was never a man of much logic, and when they came to me on that morning of  which I have just spoken and took me in where she lay and pointed to her  beautiful cold body stretched out in seeming peace under the satin coverlet,  and then to the pile of dainty clothes lying neatly folded on a chair with just  one fairy slipper on top, I shuddered at her fate but asked no questions, not  even when one of the women of the house mentioned the circumstance of the  single slipper and said that a search should be made for its mate. Nor was I as  much impressed as one would naturally expect by the whisper dropped in my ear  that something was the matter with her wrists. It is true that I lifted the  lace they had carefully spread over them and examined the discoloration which  extended like a ring about each pearly arm; but having no memories of any  violence offered her (I had not so much as laid hand upon her in the grotto),  these marks failed to rouse my interest. But&mdash;and now I must leap a year in my  story&mdash;there came a time when both of these facts recurred to my mind with  startling distinctness and clamoured for explanation.</p>
  <p>"I  had risen above the shock which such a death following such events would  naturally occasion even in one of my blunted sensibilities, and was striving to  live a new life under the encouragement of my now fully reconciled father, when  accident forced me to re-enter the grotto where I had never stepped foot since  that night. A favourite dog in chase of some innocent prey had escaped the  leash and run into its dim recesses and would not come out at my call. As I  needed him immediately for the hunt, I followed him over the promontory and,  swallowing my repugnance, slid into the grotto to get him. Better a plunge to  my death from the height of the rocks towering above it. For there in a remote  corner, lighted up by a reflection from the sea, I beheld my setter crouched  above an object which in another moment I recognized as my dead wife's missing  slipper. Here! Not in the waters of the sea or in the interstices of the rocks  outside, but here! Proof that she had never walked back to the house where she  was found lying quietly in her bed; proof positive; for I knew the path too  well and the more than usual tenderness of her feet.</p>
  <p>"How  then, did she get there; and by whose agency? Was she living when she went, or  was she already dead? A year had passed since that delicate shoe had borne her  from the boat into these dim recesses; but it might have been only a day, so  vividly did I live over in this moment of awful enlightenment all the events of  the hour in which we sat there playing for the possession of our child. Again I  saw her gleaming eyes, her rosy, working mouth, her slim, white hand, loaded  with diamonds, clutching the cards. Again I heard the lap of the sea on the  pebbles outside and smelt the odour of the wine she had poured out for us both.  The bottle which had held it; the glass from which she had drunk lay now in  pieces on the rocky floor. The whole scene was mine again and as I followed the  event to its despairing close, I seemed to see my own wild figure springing  away from her to the grotto's mouth and so over the rocks. But here fancy  faltered, caught by a quick recollection to which I had never given a thought  till now. As I made my way along those rocks, a sound had struck my ear from  where some stunted bushes made a shadow in the moonlight. The wind might have  caused it or some small night creature hustling away at my approach; and to  some such cause I must at the time have attributed it. But now, with brain  fired by suspicion, it seemed more like the quick intake of a human breath.  Some one had been lying there in wait, listening at the one loophole in the  rocks where it was possible to hear what was said and done in the heart of the  grotto. But who? who? and for what purpose this listening; and to what end did  it lead?</p>
  <p>"Though  I no longer loved even the memory of my wife, I felt my hair lift, as I asked  myself these questions. There seemed to be but one logical answer to the last,  and it was this: A struggle followed by death. The shoe fallen from her foot,  the clothes found folded in her room (my wife was never orderly), and the dimly  blackened wrists which were snow-white when she dealt the cards&mdash;all seemed to  point to such a conclusion. She may have died from heart-failure, but a  struggle had preceded her death, during which some man's strong fingers had  been locked about her wrists. And again the question rose, Whose?</p>
  <p>"If  any place was ever hated by mortal man that grotto was hated by me. I loathed  its walls, its floor, its every visible and invisible corner. To linger  there&mdash;to look&mdash;almost tore my soul from my body; yet I did linger and did look  and this is what I found by way of reward.</p>
  <p>"Behind  a projecting ledge of stone from which a tattered rug still hung, I came upon  two nails driven a few feet apart into a fissure of the rock. I had driven  those nails myself long before for a certain gymnastic attachment much in vogue  at the time, and on looking closer, I discovered hanging from them the  rope-ends by which I was wont to pull myself about. So far there was nothing to  rouse any but innocent reminiscences. But when I heard the dog's low moan and  saw him leap at the curled-up ends, and nose them with an eager look my way, I  remembered the dark marks circling the wrists about which I had so often  clasped my mother's bracelets, and the world went black before me.</p>
  <p>"When  consciousness returned&mdash;when I could once more move and see and think, I noted  another fact. Cards were strewn about the floor, face up and in a fixed order  as if laid in a mocking mood to be looked upon by reluctant eyes; and near the  ominous half-circle they made, a cushion from the lounge, stained horribly with  what I then thought to be blood, but which I afterwards found to be wine.  Vengeance spoke in those ropes and in the carefully spread-out cards, and  murder in the smothering pillow. The vengeance of one who had watched her  corroding influence eat the life out of my honour and whose love for our little  Roger was such that any deed which ensured his continued presence in the home  appeared not only warrantable but obligatory. Alas! I knew of but one person in  the whole world who could cherish feeling to this extent or possess sufficient  will power to carry her lifeless body back to the house and lay it in her bed  and give no sign of the abominable act from that day on to this.</p>
  <p>"Miss  Strange, there are men who have a peculiar conception of duty. My father&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"You  need not go on." How gently, how tenderly our Violet spoke. "I understand your  trouble&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Did  she? She paused to ask herself if this were so, and he, deaf perhaps to her  words, caught up his broken sentence and went on:</p>
  <p>"My  father was in the hall the day I came staggering in from my visit to the  grotto. No words passed, but our eyes met and from that hour I have seen death  in his countenance and he has seen it in mine, like two opponents, each struck  to the heart, who stand facing each other with simulated smiles till they fall.  My father will drop first. He is old&mdash;very old since that day five weeks ago;  and to see him die and not be sure&mdash;to see the grave close over a possible  innocence, and I left here in ignorance of the blissful fact till my own eyes  close forever, is more than I can hold up under; more than any son could.  Cannot you help me then to a positive knowledge? Think! think! A woman's mind  is strangely penetrating, and yours, I am told, has an intuitive faculty more  to be relied upon than the reasoning of men. It must suggest some means of  confirming my doubts or of definitely ending them."</p>
  <p>Then  Violet stirred and looked about at him and finally found voice.</p>
  <p>"Tell  me something about your father's ways. What are his habits? Does he sleep well  or is he wakeful at night?"</p>
  <p>"He  has poor nights. I do not know how poor because I am not often with him. His  valet, who has always been in our family, shares his room and acts as his  constant nurse. He can watch over him better than I can; he has no distracting  trouble on his mind."</p>
  <p>"And  little Roger? Does your father see much of little Roger? Does he fondle him and  seem happy in his presence?"</p>
  <p>"Yes;  yes. I have often wondered at it, but he does. They are great chums. It is a  pleasure to see them together."</p>
  <p>"And  the child clings to him&mdash;shows no fear&mdash;sits on his lap or on the bed and plays  as children do play with his beard or with his watch-chain?"</p>
  <p>"Yes.  Only once have I seen my little chap shrink, and that was when my father gave  him a look of unusual intensity,&mdash;looking for his mother in him perhaps."</p>
  <p>"Mr.  Upjohn, forgive me the question; it seems necessary. Does your father&mdash;or rather  did your father before he fell ill&mdash;ever walk in the direction of the grotto or  haunt in any way the rocks which surround it?"</p>
  <p>"I  cannot say. The sea is there; he naturally loves the sea. But I have never seen  him standing on the promontory."</p>
  <p>"Which  way do his windows look?"</p>
  <p>"Towards  the sea."</p>
  <p>"Therefore  towards the promontory?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"Can  he see it from his bed?"</p>
  <p>"No.  Perhaps that is the cause of a peculiar habit he has."</p>
  <p>"What  habit?"</p>
  <p>"Every  night before he retires (he is not yet confined to his bed) he stands for a few  minutes in his front window looking out. He says it's his good-night to the  ocean. When he no longer does this, we shall know that his end is very near."</p>
  <p>The  face of Violet began to clear. Rising, she turned on the electric light, and  then, reseating herself, remarked with an aspect of quiet cheer:</p>
  <p>"I  have two ideas; but they necessitate my presence at your place. You will not  mind a visit? My brother will accompany me."</p>
  <p>Roger  Upjohn did not need to speak, hardly to make a gesture; his expression was so  eloquent.</p>
  <p>She  thanked him as if he had answered in words, adding with an air of gentle  reserve: "Providence assists us in this matter. I am invited to Beverly next  week to attend a wedding. I was intending to stay two days, but I will make it  three and spend the extra one with you."</p>
  <p>"What  are your requirements, Miss Strange? I presume you have some."</p>
  <p>Violet  turned from the imposing portrait of Mr. Upjohn which she had been gravely  contemplating, and met the troubled eye of her young host with an enigmatical  flash of her own. But she made no answer in words. Instead, she lifted her  right hand and ran one slender finger thoughtfully up the casing of the door  near which they stood till it struck a nick in the old mahogany almost on a  level with her head.</p>
  <p>"Is  your son Roger old enough to reach so far?" she asked with another short look  at him as she let her finger rest where it had struck the roughened wood. "I  thought he was a little fellow."</p>
  <p>"He  is. That cut was made by&mdash;by my wife; a sample of her capricious willfulness.  She wished to leave a record of herself in the substance of our house as well  as in our lives. That nick marks her height. She laughed when she made it.  'Till the walls cave in or burn,' is what she said. And I thought her laugh and  smile captivating."</p>
  <p>Cutting  short his own laugh which was much too sardonic for a lady's ears, he made a  move as if to lead the way into another portion of the room. But Violet failed  to notice this, and lingering in quiet contemplation of this suggestive little  nick,&mdash;the only blemish in a room of ancient colonial magnificence,&mdash;she  thoughtfully remarked:</p>
  <p>"Then  she was a small woman?" adding with seeming irrelevance&mdash;"like myself."</p>
  <p>Roger  winced. Something in the suggestion hurt him, and in the nod he gave there was  an air of coldness which under ordinary circumstances would have deterred her  from pursuing this subject further. But the circumstances were not ordinary,  and she allowed herself to say:</p>
  <p>"Was  she so very different from me,&mdash;in figure, I mean?"</p>
  <p>"No.  Why do you ask? Shall we not join your brother on the terrace?"</p>
  <p>"Not  till I have answered the question you put me a moment ago. You wished to know  my requirements. One of the most important you have already fulfilled. You have  given your servants a half-holiday and by so doing ensured to us full liberty  of action. What else I need in the attempt I propose to make, you will find  listed in this memorandum." And taking a slip of paper from her bag, she  offered it to him with a hand, the trembling of which he would have noted had he  been freer in mind.</p>
  <p>As  he read, she watched him, her fingers nervously clutching her throat.</p>
  <p>"Can  you supply what I ask?" she faltered, as he failed to raise his eyes or make  any move or even to utter the groan she saw surging up to his lips. "Will you?"  she impetuously urged, as his fingers closed spasmodically on the paper, in  evidence that he understood at last the trend of her daring purpose.</p>
  <p>The  answer came slowly, but it came. "I will. But what&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Her  hand rose in a pleading gesture.</p>
  <p>"Do  not ask me, but take Arthur and myself into the garden and show us the flowers.  Afterwards, I should like a glimpse of the sea."</p>
  <p>He  bowed and they joined Arthur who had already begun to stroll through the  grounds.</p>
  <p>Violet  was seldom at a loss for talk even at the most critical moments. But she was  strangely tongue-tied on this occasion, as was Roger himself. Save for a few  observations casually thrown out by Arthur, the three passed in a disquieting  silence through pergola after pergola, and around beds gorgeous with every  variety of fall flowers, till they turned a sharp corner and came in full view  of the sea.</p>
  <p>"Ah!"  fell in an admiring murmur from Violet's lips as her eyes swept the horizon.  Then as they settled on a mass of rock jutting out from the shore in a great curve,  she leaned towards her host and softly whispered:</p>
  <p>"The  promontory?"</p>
  <p>He  nodded, and Violet ventured no farther, but stood for a little while gazing at  the tumbled rocks. Then, with a quick look back at the house, she asked him to  point out his father's window.</p>
  <p>He  did so, and as she noted how openly it faced the sea, her expression relaxed  and her manner lost some of its constraint. As they turned to re-enter the  house, she noticed an old man picking flowers from a vine clambering over one  end of the piazza.</p>
  <p>"Who  is that?" she asked.</p>
  <p>"Our  oldest servant, and my father's own man," was Roger's reply. "He is picking my  father's favourite flowers, a few late honeysuckles."</p>
  <p>"How  fortunate! Speak to him, Mr. Upjohn. Ask him how your father is this evening."</p>
  <p>"Accompany  me and I will; and do not be afraid to enter into conversation with him. He is  the mildest of creatures and devoted to his patient. He likes nothing better  than to talk about him."</p>
  <p>Violet,  with a meaning look at her brother, ran up the steps at Roger's side. As she  did so, the old man turned and Violet was astonished at the wistfulness with  which he viewed her.</p>
  <p>"What  a dear old creature!" she murmured. "See how he stares this way. You would  think he knew me."</p>
  <p>"He  is glad to see a woman about the place. He has felt our isolation&mdash;Good evening,  Abram. Let this young lady have a spray of your sweetest honeysuckle. And,  Abram, before you go, how is Father to-night? Still sitting up?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  sir. He is very regular in his ways. Nine is his hour; not a minute before and  not a minute later. I don't have to look at the clock when he says: 'There,  Abram, I've sat up long enough.'"</p>
  <p>"When  my father retires before his time or goes to bed without a final look at the  sea, he will be a very sick man, Abram."</p>
  <p>"That  he will, Mr. Roger; that he will. But he's very feeble to-night, very feeble. I  noticed that he gave the boy fewer kisses than usual. Perhaps he was put out  because the child was brought in a half-hour earlier than the stated time. He  don't like changes; you know that, Mr. Roger; he don't like changes. I hardly  dared to tell him that the servants were all going out in a bunch to-night."</p>
  <p>"I'm  sorry," muttered Roger. "But he'll forget it by to-morrow. I couldn't bear to  keep a single one from the concert. They'll be back in good season and meantime  we have you. Abram is worth half a dozen of them, Miss Strange. We shall miss  nothing."</p>
  <p>"Thank  you, Mr. Roger, thank you," faltered the old man. "I try to do my duty." And  with another wistful glance at Violet, who looked very sweet and youthful in  the half-light, he pottered away.</p>
  <p>The  silence which followed his departure was as painful to her as to Roger Upjohn.  When she broke it it was with this decisive remark:</p>
  <p>"That  man must not speak of me to your father. He must not even mention that you have  a guest to-night. Run after him and tell him so. It is necessary that your  father's mind should not be taken up with present happenings. Run."</p>
  <p>Roger  made haste to obey her. When he came back she was on the point of joining her  brother but stopped to utter a final injunction:</p>
  <p>"I  shall leave the library, or wherever we may be sitting, just as the clock  strikes half-past eight. Arthur will do the same, as by that time he will feel  like smoking on the terrace. Do not follow either him or myself, but take your  stand here on the piazza where you can get a full view of the right-hand wing  without attracting any attention to yourself. When you hear the big clock in  the hall strike nine, look up quickly at your father's window. What you see may  determine&mdash;oh, Arthur! still admiring the prospect? I do not wonder. But I find  it chilly. Let us go in."</p>
  <p>Roger  Upjohn, sitting by himself in the library, was watching the hands of the mantel  clock slowly approaching the hour of nine.</p>
  <p>Never  had silence seemed more oppressive nor his sense of loneliness greater. Yet the  boom of the ocean was distinct to the ear, and human presence no farther away  than the terrace where Arthur Strange could be seen smoking out his cigar in  solitude. The silence and the loneliness were in Roger's own soul; and, in face  of the expected revelation which would make or unmake his future, the  desolation they wrought was measureless.</p>
  <p>To  cut his suspense short, he rose at length and hurried out to the spot  designated by Miss Strange as the best point from which to keep watch upon his  father's window. It was at the end of the piazza where the honeysuckle hung,  and the odour of the blossoms, so pleasing to his father, well-nigh overpowered  him not only by its sweetness but by the many memories it called up. Visions of  that father as he looked at all stages of their relationship passed in a  bewildering maze before him. He saw him as he appeared to his childish eyes in  those early days of confidence when the loss of the mother cast them in mutual  dependence upon each other. Then a sterner picture of the relentless parent who  sees but one straight course to success in this world and the next. Then the  teacher and the matured adviser; and then&mdash;oh, bitter change! the man whose  hopes he had crossed&mdash;whose life he had undone, and all for her who now came  stealing upon the scene with her slim, white, jewelled hand forever lifted up  between them. And she! Had he ever seen her more clearly? Once more the dainty  figure stepped from fairy-land, beauteous with every grace that can allure and  finally destroy a man. And as he saw, he trembled and wished that these moments  of awful waiting might pass and the test be over which would lay bare his  father's heart and justify his fears or dispel them forever.</p>
  <p>But  the crisis, if crisis it was, was one of his own making and not to be hastened  or evaded. With one quick glance at his father's window, he turned in his  impatience towards the sea whose restless and continuous moaning had at length  struck his ear. What was in its call to-night that he should thus sway towards  it as though drawn by some dread magnetic force? He had been born to the  dashing of its waves and knew its every mood and all the passion of its song  from frolicsome ripple to melancholy dirge. But there was something odd and  inexplicable in its effect upon his spirit as he faced it at this hour. Grim  and implacable&mdash;a sound rather than a sight&mdash;it seemed to hold within its  invisible distances the image of his future fate. What this image was and why  he should seek for it in this impenetrable void, he did not know. He felt  himself held and was struggling with this influence as with an unknown enemy  when there rang out, from the hall within, the preparatory chimes for which his  ear was waiting, and then the nine slow strokes which signalized the moment  when he was to look for his father's presence at the window.</p>
  <p>Had  he wished, he could not have forborne that look. Had his eyes been closing in  death, or so he felt, the trembling lids would have burst apart at this call  and the revelations it promised.</p>
  <p>And  what did he see? What did that window hold for him?</p>
  <p>Nothing  that he might not have seen there any night at this hour. His father's figure  drawn up behind the panes in wistful contemplation of the night. No visible  change in his attitude, nothing forced or unusual in his manner. Even the hand,  lifted to pull down the shade, moves with its familiar hesitation. In a moment  more that shade will be down and&mdash;But no! the lifted hand falls back; the easy attitude  becomes strained, fixed. He is staring now&mdash;not merely gazing out upon the  wastes of sky and sea; and Roger, following the direction of his glance, stares  also in breathless emotion at what those distances, but now so impenetrable,  are giving to the eye.</p>
  <p>A  spectre floating in the air above the promontory! The spectre of a woman&mdash;of his  wife, clad, as she had been clad that fatal night! Outlined in supernatural  light, it faces them with lifted arms showing the ends of rope dangling from  either wrist. A sight awful to any eye, but to the man of guilty heart&mdash;</p>
  <p>Ah!  it comes&mdash;the cry for which the agonized son had been listening! An old man's  shriek, hoarse with the remorse of sleepless nights and days of unimaginable  regret and foreboding! It cuts the night. It cuts its way into his heart. He  feels his senses failing him, yet he must glance once more at the window and  see with his last conscious look&mdash;But what is this! a change has taken place in  the picture and he beholds, not the distorted form of his father sinking back  in shame and terror before this visible image of his secret sin, but that of  another weak, old man falling to the floor behind his back! Abram! the  attentive, seemingly harmless, guardian of the household! Abram! who had never  spoken a word or given a look in any way suggestive of his having played any  other part in the hideous drama of their lives than that of the humble and  sympathetic servant!</p>
  <p>The  shock was too great, the relief too absolute for credence. He, the listener at  the grotto? He, the avenger of the family's honour? He, the insurer of little  Roger's continuance with the family at a cost the one who loved him best would  rather have died himself than pay? Yes! there is no misdoubting this old  servitor's attitude of abject appeal, or the meaning of Homer Upjohn's joyfully  uplifted countenance and outspreading arms. The servant begs for mercy from  man, and the master is giving thanks to Heaven. Why giving thanks? Has he been  the prey of cankering doubts also? Has the father dreaded to discover that in  the son which the son has dreaded to discover in the father?</p>
  <p>It  might easily be; and as Roger recognizes this truth and the full tragedy of  their mutual lives, he drops to his knees amid the honeysuckles.</p>
  <p>"Violet,  you are a wonder. But how did you dare?"</p>
  <p>This  from Arthur as the two rode to the train in the early morning.</p>
  <p>The  answer came a bit waveringly.</p>
  <p>"I  do not know. I am astonished yet, at my own daring. Look at my hands. They have  not ceased trembling since the moment you threw the light upon me on the rocks.  The figure of old Mr. Upjohn in the window looked so august."</p>
  <p>Arthur,  with a short glance at the little hands she held out, shrugged his shoulders  imperceptibly. It struck him that the tremulousness she complained of was due  more to some parting word from their young host, than from prolonged awe at her  own daring. But he made no remark to this effect, only observed:</p>
  <p>"Abram  has confessed his guilt, I hear."</p>
  <p>"Yes,  and will die of it. The master will bury the man, and not the man the master."</p>
  <p>"And  Roger? Not the little fellow, but the father?"</p>
  <p>"We  will not talk of him," said she, her eyes seeking the sea where the sun in its  rising was battling with a troop of lowering clouds and slowly gaining the  victory.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>End Of  Problem IV</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Problem V <br>
    The Dreaming Lady</b></h2>
  <p>"And this is all you mean to  tell me?"</p>
  <p>"I  think you will find it quite enough, Miss Strange."</p>
  <p>"Just  the address&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"And  this advice: that your call be speedy. Distracted nerves cannot wait."</p>
  <p>Violet,  across whose wonted piquancy there lay an indefinable shadow, eyed her employer  with a doubtful air before turning away toward the door. She had asked him for  a case to investigate (something she had never done before), and she had even  gone so far as to particularize the sort of case she desired: "It must be an  interesting one," she had stipulated, "but different, quite different from the  last one. It must not involve death or any kind of horror. If you have a case  of subtlety without crime, one to engage my powers without depressing my  spirits, I beg you to let me have it. I&mdash;I have not felt quite like myself since  I came from Massachusetts." Whereupon, without further comment, but with a  smile she did not understand, he had handed her a small slip of paper on which  he had scribbled an address. She should have felt satisfied, but for some  reason she did not. She regarded him as capable of plunging her into an affair  quite the reverse of what she felt herself in a condition to undertake.</p>
  <p>"I  should like to know a little more," she pursued, making a move to unfold the  slip he had given her.</p>
  <p>But  he stopped her with a gesture.</p>
  <p>"Read  it in your limousine," said he. "If you are disappointed then, let me know. But  I think you will find yourself quite ready for your task."</p>
  <p>"And  my father?"</p>
  <p>"Would  approve if he could be got to approve the business at all. You do not even need  to take your brother with you."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  then, it's with women only I have to deal?"</p>
  <p>"Read  the address after you are headed up Fifth Avenue."</p>
  <p>But  when, with her doubts not yet entirely removed, she opened the small slip he  had given her, the number inside suggested nothing but the fact that her  destination lay somewhere near Eightieth Street. It was therefore with the  keenest surprise she beheld her motor stop before the conspicuous house of the  great financier whose late death had so affected the money-market. She had not  had any acquaintance with this man herself, but she knew his house. Everyone  knew that. It was one of the most princely in the whole city. C. Dudley Brooks  had known how to spend his millions. Indeed, he had known how to do this so  well that it was of him her father, also a financier of some note, had once  said he was the only successful American he envied.</p>
  <p>She  was expected; that she saw the instant the door was opened. This made her  entrance easy&mdash;an entrance further brightened by the delightful glimpse of a  child's cherubic face looking at her from a distant doorway. It was an  instantaneous vision, gone as soon as seen; but its effect was to rob the  pillared spaces of the wonderful hallway of some of their chill, and to modify  in some slight degree the formality of a service which demanded three men to  usher her into a small reception-room not twenty feet from the door of  entrance.</p>
  <p>Left  in this secluded spot, she had time to ask herself what member of the household  she would be called upon to meet, and was surprised to find that she did not  even know of whom the household consisted. She was sure of the fact that Mr.  Brooks had been a widower for many years before his death, but beyond that she  knew nothing of his domestic life. His son&mdash;but was there a son? She had never  heard any mention made of a younger Mr. Brooks, yet there was certainly some  one of his connection who enjoyed the rights of an heir. Him she must be  prepared to meet with a due composure, whatever astonishment he might show at  the sight of a slip of a girl instead of the experienced detective he had every  right to expect.</p>
  <p>But  when the door opened to admit the person she was awaiting, the surprise was  hers. It was a woman who stood before her, a woman and an oddity. Yet, in just  what her oddity lay, Violet found it difficult to decide. Was it in the  smoothness of her white locks drawn carefully down over her ears, or in the  contrast afforded by her eager eyes and her weak and tremulous mouth? She was  dressed in the heaviest of mourning and very expensively, but there was that in  her bearing and expression which made it impossible to believe that she took  any interest in her garments or even knew in which of her dresses she had been  attired.</p>
  <p>"I  am the person you have come here to see," she said. "Your name is not  unfamiliar to me, but you may not know mine. It is Quintard; Mrs. Quintard. I  am in difficulty. I need assistance&mdash;secret assistance. I did not know where to  go for it except to a detective agency; so I telephoned to the first one I saw  advertised; and&mdash;and I was told to expect Miss Strange. But I didn't think it  would be you though I suppose it's all right. You have come here for this  purpose, haven't you, though it does seem a little queer?"</p>
  <p>"Certainly,  Mrs. Quintard; and if you will tell me&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"My  dear, it's just this&mdash;yes, I will sit down. Last week my brother died. You have  heard of him no doubt, C. Dudley Brooks?"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  yes; my father knew him&mdash;we all knew him by reputation. Do not hurry, Mrs.  Quintard. I have sent my car away. You can take all the time you wish."</p>
  <p>"No,  no, I cannot. I'm in desperate haste. He&mdash;but let me go on with my story. My  brother was a widower, with no children to inherit. That everybody knows. But  his wife left behind her a son by a former husband, and this son of hers my  brother had in a measure adopted, and even made his sole heir in a will he drew  up during the lifetime of his wife. But when he found, as he very soon did,  that this young man was not developing in a way to meet such great  responsibilities, he made a new will&mdash;though unhappily without the knowledge of  the family, or even of his most intimate friends&mdash;in which he gave the bulk of  his great estate to his nephew Clement, who has bettered the promise of his  youth and who besides has children of great beauty whom my brother had learned  to love. And this will&mdash;this hoarded scrap of paper which means so much to us  all, is lost! lost! and I&mdash;" here her voice which had risen almost to a scream,  sank to a horrified whisper, "am the one who lost it."</p>
  <p>"But  there's a copy of it somewhere&mdash;there is always a copy&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  but you haven't heard all. My nephew is an invalid; has been an invalid for  years&mdash;that's why so little is known about him. He's dying of consumption. The  doctors hold out no hope for him, and now, with the fear preying upon him of  leaving his wife and children penniless, he is wearing away so fast that any  hour may see his end. And I have to meet his eyes&mdash;such pitiful eyes&mdash;and the look  in them is killing me. Yet, I was not to blame. I could not help&mdash;Oh, Miss  Strange," she suddenly broke in with the inconsequence of extreme feeling, "the  will is in the house! I never carried it off the floor where I sleep. Find it;  find it, I pray, or&mdash;"</p>
  <p>The  moment had come for Violet's soft touch, for Violet's encouraging word.</p>
  <p>"I  will try," she answered her.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Quintard grew calmer.</p>
  <p>"But,  first," the young girl continued, "I must know more about the conditions. Where  is this nephew of yours&mdash;the man who is ill?"</p>
  <p>"In  this house, where he has been for the last eight months."</p>
  <p>"Was  the child his of whom I caught a glimpse in the hall as I came in?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  will fight for that child!" Violet cried out impulsively. "I am sure his  father's cause is good. Where is the other claimant&mdash;the one you designate as  Carlos?"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  there's where the trouble is! Carlos is on the Mauretania, and she is due here  in a couple of days. He comes from the East where he has been touring with his  wife. Miss Strange, the lost will must be found before then, or the other will  be opened and read and Carlos made master of this house, which would mean our  quick departure and Clement's certain death."</p>
  <p>"Move  a sick man?&mdash;a relative as low as you say he is? Oh no, Mrs. Quintard; no one  would do that, were the house a cabin and its owners paupers."</p>
  <p>"You  do not know Carlos; you do not know his wife. We should not be given a week in  which to pack. They have no children and they envy Clement who has. Our only  hope lies in discovering the paper which gives us the right to remain here in  face of all opposition. That or penury. Now you know my trouble."</p>
  <p>"And  it is trouble; one from which I shall make every effort to relieve you. But  first let me ask if you are not worrying unnecessarily about this missing  document? If it was drawn up by Mr. Brooks's lawyer&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"But  it was not," that lady impetuously interrupted. "His lawyer is Carlos's near  relative, and has never been told of the change in my brother's intentions.  Clement (I am speaking now of my brother and not of my nephew) was a great  money-getter, but when it came to standing up for his rights in domestic  matters, he was more timid than a child. He was subject to his wife while she  lived, and when she was gone, to her relatives, who are all of a dominating  character. When he finally made up his mind to do us justice and eliminate  Carlos, he went out of town&mdash;I wish I could remember where&mdash;and had this will  drawn up by a stranger, whose name I cannot recall."</p>
  <p>Her  shaking tones, her nervous manner betrayed a weakness equalling, if not  surpassing, that of the brother who dared in secret what he had not strength to  acknowledge openly, and it was with some hesitation Violet prepared to ask  those definite questions which would elucidate the cause and manner of a loss  seemingly so important. She dreaded to hear some commonplace tale of  inexcusable carelessness. Something subtler than this&mdash;the presence of some  unsuspected agency opposed to young Clement's interest; some partisan of  Carlos; some secret undermining force in a house full of servants and  dependants, seemed necessary for the development of so ordinary a situation  into a drama justifying the exercise of her special powers.</p>
  <p>"I  think I understand now your exact position in the house, as well as the value  of the paper which you say you have lost. The next thing for me to hear is how  you came to have charge of this paper, and under what circumstances you were  led to mislay it. Do you not feel quite ready to tell me?"</p>
  <p>"Is&mdash;is  that necessary?" Mrs. Quintard faltered.</p>
  <p>"Very,"  replied Violet, watching her curiously.</p>
  <p>"I  didn't expect&mdash;that is, I hoped you would be able to point out, by some power we  cannot of course explain, just the spot where the paper lies, without having to  tell all that. Some people can, you know."</p>
  <p>"Ah,  I understand. You regarded me as unfit for practical work, and so credited me  with occult powers. But that is where you made a mistake, Mrs. Quintard; I'm  nothing if not practical. And let me add, that I'm as secret as the grave  concerning what my clients tell me. If I am to be of any help to you, I must be  made acquainted with every fact involved in the loss of this valuable paper.  Relate the whole circumstance or dismiss me from the case. You can have done  nothing more foolish or wrong than many&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  don't say things like that!" broke in the poor woman in a tone of great  indignation. "I have done nothing anyone could call either foolish or wicked. I  am simply very unfortunate, and being sensitive&mdash;But this isn't telling the  story. I'll try to make it all clear; but if I do not, and show any confusion,  stop me and help me out with questions. I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, where shall I begin?"</p>
  <p>"With  your first knowledge of this second will."</p>
  <p>"Thank  you, thank you; now I can go on. One night, shortly after my brother had been  given up by the physicians, I was called to his bedside for a confidential  talk. As he had received that day a very large amount of money from the bank, I  thought he was going to hand it over to me for Clement, but it was for  something much more serious than this he had summoned me. When he was quite  sure that we were alone and nobody anywhere within hearing, he told me that he  had changed his mind as to the disposal of his property and that it was to  Clement and his children, and not to Carlos, he was going to leave this house  and the bulk of his money. That he had had a new will drawn up which he showed  me&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Showed  you?"</p>
  <p>"Yes;  he made me bring it to him from the safe where he kept it; and, feeble as he  was, he was so interested in pointing out certain portions of it that he lifted  himself in bed and was so strong and animated that I thought he was getting  better. But it was a false strength due to the excitement of the moment, as I  saw next day when he suddenly died."</p>
  <p>"You  were saying that you brought the will to him from his safe. Where was the  safe?"</p>
  <p>"In  the wall over his head. He gave me the key to open it. This key he took from  under his pillow. I had no trouble in fitting it or in turning the lock."</p>
  <p>"And  what happened after you looked at the will?"</p>
  <p>"I  put it back. He told me to. But the key I kept. He said I was not to part with  it again till the time came for me to produce the will."</p>
  <p>"And  when was that to be?"</p>
  <p>"Immediately  after the funeral, if it so happened that Carlos had arrived in time to attend  it. But if for any reason he failed to be here, I was to let it lie till within  three days of his return, when I was to take it out in the presence of a Mr.  Delahunt who was to have full charge of it from that time. Oh, I remember all  that well enough! and I meant most earnestly to carry out his wishes, but&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Go  on, Mrs. Quintard, pray go on. What happened? Why couldn't you do what he  asked?"</p>
  <p>"Because  the will was gone when I went to take it out. There was nothing to show Mr.  Delahunt but the empty shelf."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  a theft! just a common theft! Someone overheard the talk you had with your  brother. But how about the key? You had that?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  I had that."</p>
  <p>"Then  it was taken from you and returned? You must have been careless as to where you  kept it&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"No,  I wore it on a chain about my neck. Though I had no reason to mistrust any one  in the house, I felt that I could not guard this key too carefully. I even kept  it on at night. In fact it never left me. It was still on my person when I went  into the room with Mr. Delahunt. But the safe had been opened for all that."</p>
  <p>"There  were two keys to it, then?"</p>
  <p>"No;  in giving me the key, my brother had strictly warned me not to lose it, as it  had no duplicate."</p>
  <p>"Mrs.  Quintard, have you a special confidant or maid?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  my Hetty."</p>
  <p>"How  much did she know about this key?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing,  but that it didn't help the fit of my dress. Hetty has cared for me for years.  There's no more devoted woman in all New York, nor one who can be more relied  upon to tell the truth. She is so honest with her tongue that I am bound to  believe her even when she says&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"What?"</p>
  <p>"That  it was I and nobody else who took the will out of the safe last night. That she  saw me come from my brother's room with a folded paper in my hand, pass with it  into the library, and come out again without it. If this is so, then that will  is somewhere in that great room. But we've looked in every conceivable place  except the shelves, where it is useless to search. It would take days to go  through them all, and meanwhile Carlos&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"We  will not wait for Carlos. We will begin work at once. But just one other  question. How came Hetty to see you in your walk through the rooms? Did she  follow you?"</p>
  <p>"Yes.  It's&mdash;it's not the first time I have walked in my sleep. Last night&mdash;but she will  tell you. It's a painful subject to me. I will send for her to meet us in the  library."</p>
  <p>"Where  you believe this document to lie hidden?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"I  am anxious to see the room. It is upstairs, I believe."</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>She  had risen and was moving rapidly toward the door. Violet eagerly followed her.</p>
  <p>Let  us accompany her in her passage up the palatial stairway, and realize the  effect upon her of a splendour whose future ownership possibly depended  entirely upon herself.</p>
  <p>It  was a cold splendour. The merry voices of children were lacking in these great  halls. Death past and to come infused the air with solemnity and mocked the  pomp which yet appeared so much a part of the life here that one could hardly  imagine the huge pillared spaces without it.</p>
  <p>To  Violet, more or less accustomed to fine interiors, the chief interest of this  one lay in its connection with the mystery then occupying her. Stopping for a  moment on the stair, she inquired of Mrs. Quintard if the loss she so deplored  had been made known to the servants, and was much relieved to find that, with  the exception of Mr. Delahunt, she had not spoken of it to any one but Clement.  "And he will never mention it," she declared, "not even to his wife. She has  troubles enough to bear without knowing how near she stood to a fortune."</p>
  <p>"Oh,  she will have her fortune!" Violet confidently replied. "In time, the lawyer  who drew up the will will appear. But what you want is an immediate triumph  over the cold Carlos, and I hope you may have it. Ah!"</p>
  <p>This  expletive was a sigh of sheer surprise.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Quintard had unlocked the library door and Violet had been given her first  glimpse of this, the finest room in New York.</p>
  <p>She  remembered now that she had often heard it so characterized, and, indeed, had  it been taken bodily from some historic abbey of the old world, it could not  have expressed more fully, in structure and ornamentation, the Gothic idea at  its best. All that it lacked were the associations of vanished centuries, and  these, in a measure, were supplied to the imagination by the studied mellowness  of its tints and the suggestion of age in its carvings.</p>
  <p>So  much for the room itself, which was but a shell for holding the great treasure  of valuable books ranged along every shelf. As Violet's eyes sped over their  ranks and thence to the five windows of deeply stained glass which faced her  from the southern end, Mrs. Quintard indignantly exclaimed:</p>
  <p>"And  Carlos would turn this into a billiard room!"</p>
  <p>"I  do not like Carlos," Violet returned hotly; then remembering herself, hastened  to ask whether Mrs. Quintard was quite positive as to this room being the one  in which she had hidden the precious document.</p>
  <p>"You  had better talk to Hetty," said that lady, as a stout woman of most  prepossessing appearance entered their presence and paused respectfully just  inside the doorway. "Hetty, you will answer any questions this young lady may  put. If anyone can help us, she can. But first, what news from the sick-room?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing  good. The doctor has just come for the third time today. Mrs. Brooks is crying  and even the children are dumb with fear."</p>
  <p>"I  will go. I must see the doctor. I must tell him to keep Clement alive by any  means till&mdash;"</p>
  <p>She  did not wait to say what; but Violet understood and felt her heart grow heavy.  Could it be that her employer considered this the gay and easy task she had  asked for?</p>
  <p>The  next minute she was putting her first question:</p>
  <p>"Hetty,  what did you see in Mrs. Quintard's action last night, to make you infer that  she left the missing document in this room?"</p>
  <p>The  woman's eyes, which had been respectfully studying her face, brightened with a  relief which made her communicative. With the self-possession of a perfectly  candid nature, she inquiringly remarked:</p>
  <p>"My  mistress has spoken of her infirmity?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  and very frankly."</p>
  <p>"She  walks in her sleep."</p>
  <p>"So  she said."</p>
  <p>"And  sometimes when others are asleep, and she is not."</p>
  <p>"She  did not tell me that."</p>
  <p>"She  is a very nervous woman and cannot always keep still when she rouses up at  night. When I hear her rise, I get up too; but, never being quite sure whether  she is sleeping or not, I am careful to follow her at a certain distance. Last  night I was so far behind her that she had been to her brother's room and left  it before I saw her face."</p>
  <p>"Where  is his room and where is hers?"</p>
  <p>"Hers  is in front on this same floor. Mr. Brooks's is in the rear, and can be reached  either by the hall or by passing through this room into a small one beyond,  which we called his den."</p>
  <p>"Describe  your encounter. Where were you standing when you saw her first?"</p>
  <p>"In  the den I have just mentioned. There was a bright light in the hall behind me  and I could see her figure quite plainly. She was holding a folded paper  clenched against her breast, and her movement was so mechanical that I was sure  she was asleep. She was coming this way, and in another moment she entered this  room. The door, which had been open, remained so, and in my anxiety I crept to  it and looked in after her. There was no light burning here at that hour, but  the moon was shining in in long rays of variously coloured light. If I had  followed her&mdash;but I did not. I just stood and watched her long enough to see her  pass through a blue ray, then through a green one, and then into, if not  through, a red one. Expecting her to walk straight on, and having some fears of  the staircase once she got into the hall, I hurried around to the door behind  you there to head her off. But she had not yet left this room. I waited and  waited and still she did not come. Fearing some accident, I finally ventured to  approach the door and try it. It was locked. This alarmed me. She had never  locked herself in anywhere before and I did not know what to make of it. Some  persons would have shouted her name, but I had been warned against doing that,  so I simply stood where I was, and eventually I heard the key turn in the lock  and saw her come out. She was still walking stiffly, but her hands were empty  and hanging at her side."</p>
  <p>"And  then?"</p>
  <p>"She  went straight to her room and I after her. I was sure she was dead asleep by this  time."</p>
  <p>"And  she was?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  Miss; but still full of what was on her mind. I know this because she stopped  when she reached the bedside and began fumbling with the waist of her wrapper.  It was for the key she was searching, and when her fingers encountered it  hanging on the outside, she opened her wrapper and thrust it in on her bare  skin."</p>
  <p>"You  saw her do all that?"</p>
  <p>"As  plainly as I see you now. The light in her room was burning brightly."</p>
  <p>"And  after that?"</p>
  <p>"She  got into bed. It was I who turned off the light."</p>
  <p>"Has  that wrapper of hers a pocket?"</p>
  <p>"No,  Miss."</p>
  <p>"Nor  her gown?"</p>
  <p>"No,  Miss."</p>
  <p>"So  she could not have brought the paper into her room concealed about her person?"</p>
  <p>"No,  Miss; she left it here. It never passed beyond this doorway."</p>
  <p>"But  might she not have carried it back to some place of concealment in the rooms  she had left?"</p>
  <p>The  woman's face changed and a slight flush showed through the natural brown of her  cheeks.</p>
  <p>"No,"  she disclaimed; "she could not have done that. I was careful to lock the  library door behind her before I ran out into the hall."</p>
  <p>"Then,"  concluded Violet, with all the emphasis of conviction, "it is here, and nowhere  else we must look for that document till we find it."</p>
  <p>Thus  assured of the first step in the task she had before her, Miss Strange settled  down to business.</p>
  <p>The  room, which towered to the height of two stories, was in the shape of a huge  oval. This oval, separated into narrow divisions for the purpose of  accommodating the shelves with which it was lined, narrowed as it rose above  the great Gothic chimney-piece and the five gorgeous windows looking towards  the south, till it met and was lost in the tracery of the ceiling, which was of  that exquisite and soul-satisfying order which we see in the Henry VII chapel  in Westminster Abbey. What break otherwise occurred in the circling round of  books reaching thus thirty feet or more above the head was made by the two  doors already spoken of and a narrow strip of wall at either end of the space  occupied by the windows. No furniture was to be seen there except a couple of  stalls taken from some old cathedral, which stood in the two bare places just  mentioned.</p>
  <p>But  within, on the extensive floor-space, several articles were grouped, and  Violet, recognizing the possibilities which any one of them afforded for the  concealment of so small an object as a folded document, decided to use method  in her search, and to that end, mentally divided the space before her into four  segments.</p>
  <p>The  first took in the door, communicating with the suite ending in Mr. Brooks's  bedroom. A diagram of this segment will show that the only article of furniture  in it was a cabinet.</p>
  <p>It  was at this cabinet Miss Strange made her first stop.</p>
  <p>"You  have looked this well through?" she asked as she bent over the glass case on  top to examine the row of mediaeval missals displayed within in a manner to  show their wonderful illuminations.</p>
  <p>"Not  the case," explained Hetty. "It is locked you see and no one has as yet  succeeded in finding the key. But we searched the drawers underneath with the  greatest care. Had we sifted the whole contents through our fingers, I could  not be more certain that the paper is not there."</p>
  <p>Violet  stepped into the next segment.</p>
  <p>This  was the one dominated by the huge fire-place. A rug lay before the hearth. To  this Violet pointed.</p>
  <p>Quickly  the woman answered: "We not only lifted it, but turned it over."</p>
  <p>"And  that box at the right?"</p>
  <p>"Is  full of wood and wood only."</p>
  <p>"Did  you take out this wood?"</p>
  <p>"Every  stick."</p>
  <p>"And  those ashes in the fire-place? Something has been burned there."</p>
  <p>"Yes;  but not lately. Besides, those ashes are all wood ashes. If the least bit of  charred paper had been mixed with them, we should have considered the matter  settled. But you can see for yourself that no such particle can be found." While  saying this, she had put the poker into Violet's hand. "Rake them about, Miss,  and make sure."</p>
  <p>Violet  did so, with the result that the poker was soon put back into place, and she  herself down on her knees looking up the chimney.</p>
  <p>"Had  she thrust it up there," Hetty made haste to remark, "there would have been  some signs of soot on her sleeves. They are white and very long and are always  getting in her way when she tries to do anything."</p>
  <p>Violet  left the fire-place after a glance at the mantel-shelf on which nothing stood  but a casket of open fretwork, and two coloured photographs mounted on small  easels. The casket was too open to conceal anything and the photographs lifted  too high above the shelf for even the smallest paper, let alone a document of  any size, to hide behind them.</p>
  <p>The  chairs, of which there were several in this part of the room, she passed with  just an inquiring look. They were all of solid oak, without any attempt at  upholstery, and although carved to match the stalls on the other side of the  room, offered no place for search.</p>
  <p>Her  delay in the third segment was brief. Here there was absolutely nothing but the  door by which she had entered, and the books. As she flitted on, following the  oval of the wall, a small frown appeared on her usually smooth forehead. She  felt the oppression of the books&mdash;the countless books. If indeed, she should  find herself obliged to go through them. What a hopeless outlook!</p>
  <p>But  she had still a segment to consider, and after that the immense table occupying  the centre of the room, a table which in its double capacity (for it was as  much desk as table) gave more promise of holding the solution of the mystery  than anything to which she had hitherto given her attention.</p>
  <p>The  quarter in which she now stood was the most beautiful, and, possibly, the most  precious of them all. In it blazed the five great windows which were the glory  of the room; but there are no hiding-places in windows, and much as she  revelled in colour, she dared not waste a moment on them. There was more hope  for her in the towering stalls, with their possible drawers for books.</p>
  <p>But  Hetty was before her in the attempt she made to lift the lids of the two great  seats.</p>
  <p>"Nothing  in either," said she; and Violet, with a sigh, turned towards the table.</p>
  <p>This  was an immense affair, made to accommodate itself to the shape of the room, but  with a hollowed-out space on the window-side large enough to hold a chair for  the sitter who would use its top as a desk. On it were various articles  suitable to its double use. Without being crowded, it displayed a pile of  magazines and pamphlets, boxes for stationery, a writing pad with its  accompaniments, a lamp, and some few ornaments, among which was a large box,  richly inlaid with pearl and ivory, the lid of which stood wide open.</p>
  <p>"Don't  touch," admonished Violet, as Hetty stretched out her hand to move some little  object aside. "You have already worked here busily in the search you made this  morning."</p>
  <p>"We  handled everything."</p>
  <p>"Did  you go through these pamphlets?"</p>
  <p>"We  shook open each one. We were especially particular here, since it was at this  table I saw Mrs. Quintard stop."</p>
  <p>"With  head level or drooped?"</p>
  <p>"Drooped."</p>
  <p>"Like  one looking down, rather than up, or around?"</p>
  <p>"Yes.  A ray of red light shone on her sleeve. It seemed to me the sleeve moved as  though she were reaching out."</p>
  <p>"Will  you try to stand as she did and as nearly in the same place as possible?"</p>
  <p>Hetty  glanced down at the table edge, marked where the gules dominated the blue and  green, and moved to that spot, and paused with her head sinking slowly towards  her breast.</p>
  <p>"Very  good," exclaimed Violet. "But the moon was probably in a very different  position from what the sun is now."</p>
  <p>"You  are right; it was higher up; I chanced to notice it."</p>
  <p>"Let  me come," said Violet.</p>
  <p>Hetty  moved, and Violet took her place but in a spot a step or two farther front.  This brought her very near to the centre of the table. Hanging her head, just  as Hetty had done, she reached out her right hand.</p>
  <p>"Have  you looked under this blotter?" she asked, pointing towards the pad she  touched. "I mean, between the blotter and the frame which holds it?"</p>
  <p>"I  certainly did," answered Hetty, with some pride.</p>
  <p>Violet  remained staring down. "Then you took off everything that was lying on it?"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  yes."</p>
  <p>Violet  continued to stare down at the blotter. Then impetuously:</p>
  <p>"Put  them back in their accustomed places."</p>
  <p>Hetty  obeyed.</p>
  <p>Violet  continued to look at them, then slowly stretched out her hand, but soon let it  fall again with an air of discouragement. Certainly the missing document was  not in the ink-pot or the mucilage bottle. Yet something made her stoop again  over the pad and subject it to the closest scrutiny.</p>
  <p>"If  only nothing had been touched!" she inwardly sighed. But she let no sign of her  discontent escape her lips, simply exclaiming as she glanced up at the towering  spaces overhead: "The books! the books! Nothing remains but for you to call up  all the servants, or get men from the outside and, beginning at one end&mdash;I  should say the upper one&mdash;take down every book standing within reach of a woman  of Mrs. Quintard's height."</p>
  <p>"Hear  first what Mrs. Quintard has to say about that," interrupted the woman as that  lady entered in a flutter of emotion springing from more than one cause.</p>
  <p>"The  young lady thinks that we should remove the books," Hetty observed, as her  mistress's eye wandered to hers from Violet's abstracted countenance.</p>
  <p>"Useless.  If we were to undertake to do that, Carlos would be here before half the job  was finished. Besides, Hetty must have told you my extreme aversion to nicely  bound books. I will not say that when awake I never place my hand on one, but  once in a state of somnambulism, when every natural whim has full control, I am  sure that I never would. There is a reason for my prejudice. I was not always  rich. I once was very poor. It was when I was first married and long before  Clement had begun to make his fortune. I was so poor then that frequently I  went hungry, and what was worse saw my little daughter cry for food. And why?  Because my husband was a bibliomaniac. He would spend on fine editions what  would have kept the family comfortable. It is hard to believe, isn't it? I have  seen him bring home a Grolier when the larder was as empty as that box; and it  made me hate books so, especially those of extra fine binding, that I have to  tear the covers off before I can find courage to read them."</p>
  <p>O  life! life! how fast Violet was learning it!</p>
  <p>"I  can understand your idea, Mrs. Quintard, but as everything else has failed, I  should make a mistake not to examine these shelves. It is just possible that we  may be able to shorten the task very materially; that we may not have to call  in help, even. To what extent have they been approached, or the books handled,  since you discovered the loss of the paper we are looking for?"</p>
  <p>"Not  at all. Neither of us went near them." This from Hetty.</p>
  <p>"Nor  any one else?"</p>
  <p>"No  one else has been admitted to the room. We locked both doors the moment we felt  satisfied that the will had been left here."</p>
  <p>"That's  a relief. Now I may be able to do something. Hetty, you look like a very strong  woman, and I, as you see, am very little. Would you mind lifting me up to these  shelves? I want to look at them. Not at the books, but at the shelves  themselves."</p>
  <p>The  wondering woman stooped and raised her to the level of the shelf she had  pointed out. Violet peered closely at it and then at the ones just beneath.</p>
  <p>"Am  I heavy?" she asked; "if not, let me see those on the other side of the door."</p>
  <p>Hetty  carried her over.</p>
  <p>Violet  inspected each shelf as high as a woman of Mrs. Quintard's stature could reach,  and when on her feet again, knelt to inspect the ones below.</p>
  <p>"No  one has touched or drawn anything from these shelves in twenty-four hours," she  declared. "The small accumulation of dust along their edges has not been  disturbed at any point. It was very different with the table-top. That shows  very plainly where you had moved things and where you had not."</p>
  <p>"Was  that what you were looking for? Well, I never!"</p>
  <p>Violet  paid no heed; she was thinking and thinking very deeply.</p>
  <p>Hetty  turned towards her mistress, then quickly back to Violet, whom she seized by  the arm.</p>
  <p>"What's  the matter with Mrs. Quintard?" she hurriedly asked. "If it were night, I  should think that she was in one of her spells."</p>
  <p>Violet  started and glanced where Hetty pointed. Mrs. Quintard was within a few feet of  them, but as oblivious of their presence as though she stood alone in the room.  Possibly, she thought she did. With fixed eyes and mechanical step she began to  move straight towards the table, her whole appearance of a nature to make  Hetty's blood run cold, but to cause that of Violet's to bound through her  veins with renewed hope.</p>
  <p>"The  one thing I could have wished!" she murmured under her breath. "She has fallen  into a trance. She is again under the dominion of her idea. If we watch and do  not disturb her she may repeat her action of last night, and herself show where  she has put this precious document."</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Mrs. Quintard continued to advance. A moment more, and her smooth white locks  caught the ruddy glow centred upon the chair standing in the hollow of the  table. Words were leaving her lips, and her hand, reaching out over the  blotter, groped among the articles scattered there till it settled on a large  pair of shears.</p>
  <p>"Listen,"  muttered Violet to the woman pressing close to her side. "You are acquainted  with her voice; catch what she says if you can."</p>
  <p>Hetty  could not; an undistinguishable murmur was all that came to her ears.</p>
  <p>Violet  took a step nearer. Mrs. Quintard's hand had left the shears and was hovering  uncertainly in the air. Her distress was evident. Her head, no longer steady on  her shoulders, was turning this way and that, and her tones becoming  inarticulate.</p>
  <p>"Paper!  I want paper" burst from her lips in a shrill unnatural cry.</p>
  <p>But  when they listened for more and watched to see the uncertain hand settle  somewhere, she suddenly came to herself and turned upon them a startled glance,  which speedily changed into one of the utmost perplexity.</p>
  <p>"What  am I doing here?" she asked. "I have a feeling as if I had almost seen&mdash;almost  touched&mdash;oh, it's gone! and all is blank again. Why couldn't I keep it till I  knew&mdash;" Then she came wholly to herself and, forgetting even the doubts of a  moment since, remarked to Violet in her old tremulous fashion:</p>
  <p>"You  asked us to pull down the books? But you've evidently thought better of it."</p>
  <p>"Yes,  I have thought better of it." Then, with a last desperate hope of re-arousing  the visions lying somewhere back in Mrs. Quintard's troubled brain, Violet ventured  to observe: "This is likely to resolve itself into a psychological problem,  Mrs. Quintard. Do you suppose that if you fell again into the condition of last  night, you would repeat your action and so lead us yourself to where the will  lies hidden?"</p>
  <p>"Possibly;  but it may be weeks before I walk again in my sleep, and meanwhile Carlos will  have arrived, and Clement, possibly, died. My nephew is so low that the doctor  is coming back at midnight. Miss Strange, Clement is a man in a thousand. He  says he wants to see you. Would you be willing to accompany me to his room for  a moment? He will not make many more requests and I will take care that the  interview is not prolonged."</p>
  <p>"I  will go willingly. But would it not be better to wait&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Then  you may never see him at all."</p>
  <p>"Very  well; but I wish I had some better news to give."</p>
  <p>"That  will come later. This house was never meant for Carlos. Hetty, you will stay  here. Miss Strange, let us go now."</p>
  <p>"You  need not speak; just let him see you."</p>
  <p>Violet  nodded and followed Mrs. Quintard into the sick-room.</p>
  <p>The  sight which met her eyes tried her young emotions deeply. Staring at her from  the bed, she saw two piercing eyes over whose brilliance death as yet had  gained no control. Clements's soul was in that gaze; Clement halting at the  brink of dissolution to sound the depths behind him for the hope which would  make departure easy. Would he see in her, a mere slip of a girl dressed in  fashionable clothes and bearing about her all the marks of social distinction,  the sort of person needed for the task upon the success of which depended his  darlings' future? She could hardly expect it. Yet as she continued to meet his  gaze with all the seriousness the moment demanded, she beheld those burning  orbs lose some of their demand and the fingers, which had lain inert upon the  bedspread, flutter gently and move as if to draw attention to his wife and the  three beautiful children clustered at the foot-board.</p>
  <p>He  had not spoken nor could she speak, but the solemnity with which she raised her  right hand as to a listening Heaven called forth upon his lips what was  possibly his last smile, and with the memory of this faint expression of  confidence on his part, she left the room, to make her final attempt to solve  the mystery of the missing document.</p>
  <p>Facing  the elderly lady in the hall, she addressed her with the force and soberness of  one leading a forlorn hope:</p>
  <p>"I  want you to concentrate your mind upon what I have to say to you. Do you think  you can do this?"</p>
  <p>"I  will try," replied the poor woman with a backward glance at the door which had  just been closed upon her.</p>
  <p>"What  we want," said she, "is, as I stated before, an insight into the workings of  your brain at the time you took the will from the safe. Try and follow what I  have to say, Mrs. Quintard. Dreams are no longer regarded by scientists as  prophecies of the future or even as spontaneous and irrelevant conditions of  thought, but as reflections of a near past, which can almost without exception  be traced back to the occurrences which caused them. Your action with the will  had its birth in some previous line of thought afterwards forgotten. Let us try  and find that thought. Recall, if you can, just what you did or read  yesterday."</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Quintard looked frightened.</p>
  <p>"But,  I have no memory," she objected. "I forget quickly, so quickly that in order to  fulfill my engagements I have to keep a memorandum of every day's events.  Yesterday? yesterday? What did I do yesterday? I went downtown for one thing,  but I hardly know where."</p>
  <p>"Perhaps  your memorandum of yesterday's doings will help you."</p>
  <p>"I  will get it. But it won't give you the least help. I keep it only for my own  eye, and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Never  mind; let me see it."</p>
  <p>And  she waited impatiently for it to be put in her hands.</p>
  <p>But  when she came to read the record of the last two days, this was all she found:</p>
  <p>Saturday:  Mauretania nearly due. I must let Mr. Delahunt know today that he's wanted here  to-morrow. Hetty will try on my dresses. Says she has to alter them. Mrs.  Peabody came to lunch, and we in such trouble! Had to go down street. Errand  for Clement. The will, the will! I think of nothing else. Is it safe where it  is? No peace of mind till to-morrow. Clement better this afternoon. Says he  must live till Carlos gets back; not to triumph over him, but to do what he can  to lessen his disappointment. My good Clement!</p>
  <p>So  nervous, I went to pasting photographs, and was forgetting all my troubles when  Hetty brought in another dress to try on.</p>
  <p>Quiet  in the great house, during which the clock on the staircase sent forth seven  musical peals. To Violet waiting alone in the library, they acted as a summons.  She was just leaving the room, when the sound of hubbub in the hall below held  her motionless in the doorway. An automobile had stopped in front, and several  persons were entering the house, in a gay and unseemly fashion. As she stood  listening, uncertain of her duty, she perceived the frenzied figure of Mrs.  Quintard approaching. As she passed by, she dropped one word: "Carlos!" Then  she went staggering on, to disappear a moment later down the stairway.</p>
  <p>This  vision lost, another came. This time it was that of Clements's wife leaning  from the marble balustrade above, the shadow of approaching grief battling with  the present terror in her perfect features. Then she too withdrew from view and  Violet, left for the moment alone in the great hall, stepped back into the  library and began to put on her hat.</p>
  <p>The  lights had been turned up in the grand salon and it was in this scene of  gorgeous colour that Mrs. Quintard came face to face with Carlos Pelacios.  Those who were witness to her entrance say that she presented a noble  appearance, as with the resolution of extreme desperation she stood waiting for  his first angry attack.</p>
  <p>He,  a short, thick-set, dark man, showing both in features and expression the  Spanish blood of his paternal ancestors, started to address her in tones of  violence, but changed his note, as he met her eye, to one simply sardonic.</p>
  <p>"You  here!" he began. "I assure you, madame, that it is a pleasure which is not without  its inconveniences. Did you not receive my cablegram requesting this house to  be made ready for my occupancy?"</p>
  <p>"I  did."</p>
  <p>"Then  why do I find guests here? They do not usually precede the arrival of their  host."</p>
  <p>"Clement  is very ill&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"So  much the greater reason that he should have been removed&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"You  were not expected for two days yet. You cabled that you were coming on the  Mauretania."</p>
  <p>"Yes,  I cabled that. Elisabetta,"&mdash;this to his wife standing silently in the  background&mdash;"we will go to the Plaza for tonight. At three o'clock tomorrow we  shall expect to find this house in readiness for our return. Later, if Mrs.  Quintard desires to visit us we shall be pleased to receive her. But"&mdash;this to  Mrs. Quintard herself&mdash;"you must come without Clement and the kids."</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Quintard's rigid hand stole up to her throat.</p>
  <p>"Clement  is dying. He is failing hourly," she murmured. "He may not live till morning."</p>
  <p>Even  Carlos was taken aback by this. "Oh, well!" said he, "we will give you two  days."</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Quintard gasped, then she walked straight up to him.</p>
  <p>"You  will give us all the time his condition requires and more, much more. He is the  real owner of this house, not you. My brother left a will bequeathing it to  him. You are my nephew's guests, and not he yours. As his representative I  entreat you and your wife to remain here until you can find a home to your  mind."</p>
  <p>The  silence seethed. Carlos had a temper of fire and so had his wife. But neither  spoke, till he had gained sufficient control over himself to remark without  undue rancour:</p>
  <p>"I  did not think you had the wit to influence your brother to this extent;  otherwise, I should have cut my travels short." Then harshly: "Where is this  will?"</p>
  <p>"It  will be produced." But the words faltered.</p>
  <p>Carlos  glanced at the man standing behind his wife; then back at Mrs. Quintard.</p>
  <p>"Wills  are not scribbled off on deathbeds; or if they are, it needs something more  than a signature to legalize them. I don't believe in this trick of a later  will. Mr. Cavanagh"&mdash;here he indicated the gentleman accompanying them&mdash;"has done  my father's business for years, and he assured me that the paper he holds in  his pocket is the first, last, and only expression of your brother's wishes. If  you are in a position to deny this, show us the document you mention; show us  it at once, or inform us where and in whose hands it can be found."</p>
  <p>"That,  for&mdash;for reasons I cannot give, I must refuse to do at present. But I am ready  to swear&mdash;"</p>
  <p>A  mocking laugh cut her short. Did it issue from his lips or from those of his  highstrung and unfeeling wife? It might have come from either; there was cause  enough.</p>
  <p>"Oh!"  she faltered, "may God have mercy!" and was sinking before their eyes, when she  heard her name, called from the threshold, and, looking that way, saw Hetty  beaming upon her, backed by a little figure with a face so radiant that  instinctively her hand went out to grasp the folded sheet of paper Hetty was  seeking to thrust upon her.</p>
  <p>"Ah!"  she cried, in a great voice, "you will not have to wait, nor Clement either.  Here is the will! The children have come into their own." And she fell at their  feet in a dead faint.</p>
  <p>"Where  did you find it? Oh! where did you find it? I have waited a week to know. When,  after Carlos's sudden departure, I stood beside Clement's death-bed and saw  from the look he gave me that he could still feel and understand, I told him  that you had succeeded in your task and that all was well with us. But I was  not able to tell him how you had succeeded or in what place the will had been  found; and he died, unknowing. But we may know, may we not, now that he is laid  away and there is no more talk of our leaving this house?"</p>
  <p>Violet  smiled, but very tenderly, and in a way not to offend the mourner. They were  sitting in the library&mdash;the great library which was to remain in Clement's  family after all&mdash;and it amused her to follow the dreaming lady's glances as  they ran in irrepressible curiosity over the walls. Had Violet wished, she  could have kept her secret forever. These eyes would never have discovered it.</p>
  <p>But  she was of a sympathetic temperament, our Violet, so after a moment's delay,  during which she satisfied herself that little, if anything, had been touched  in the room since her departure from it a week before, she quietly observed:</p>
  <p>"You  were right in persisting that you hid it in this room. It was here I found it.  Do you notice that photograph on the mantel which does not stand exactly  straight on its easel?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  <p>"Supposing  you take it down. You can reach it, can you not?"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  yes. But what&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Lift  it down, dear Mrs. Quintard; and then turn it round and look at its back."</p>
  <p>Agitated  and questioning, the lady did as she was bid, and at the first glance gave a  cry of surprise, if not of understanding. The square of brown paper, acting as  a backing to the picture, was slit across, disclosing a similar one behind it  which was still intact.</p>
  <p>"Oh!  was it hidden in here?" she asked.</p>
  <p>"Very  completely," assented Violet. "Pasted in out of sight by a lady who amuses  herself with mounting and framing photographs. Usually, she is conscious of her  work, but this time she performed her task in a dream."</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Quintard was all amazement.</p>
  <p>"I  don't remember touching these pictures," she declared. "I never should have  remembered. You are a wonderful person, Miss Strange. How came you to think  these photographs might have two backings? There was nothing to show that this  was so."</p>
  <p>"I  will tell you, Mrs. Quintard. You helped me."</p>
  <p>"I  helped you?"</p>
  <p>"Yes.  You remember the memorandum you gave me? In it you mentioned pasting  photographs. But this was not enough in itself to lead me to examine those on  the mantel, if you had not given me another suggestion a little while before.  We did not tell you this, Mrs. Quintard, at the time, but during the search we  were making here that day, you had a lapse into that peculiar state which  induces you to walk in your sleep. It was a short one, lasting but a moment,  but in a moment one can speak, and, this you did&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Spoke?  I spoke?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  you uttered the word 'paper!' not the paper, but 'paper!' and reached out towards  the shears. Though I had not much time to think of it then, afterwards upon  reading your memorandum I recalled your words, and asked myself if it was not  paper to cut, rather than to hide, you wanted. If it was to cut, and you were  but repeating the experience of the night before, then the room should contain  some remnants of cut paper. Had we seen any? Yes, in the basket, under the desk  we had taken out and thrown back again a strip or so of wrapping paper, which,  if my memory did not fail me, showed a clean-cut edge. To pull this strip out  again and spread it flat upon the desk was the work of a minute, and what I saw  led me to look all over the room, not now for the folded document, but for a  square of brown paper, such as had been taken out of this larger sheet. Was I  successful? Not for a long while, but when I came to the photographs on the  mantel and saw how nearly they corresponded in shape and size to what I was  looking for, I recalled again your fancy for mounting photographs and felt that  the mystery was solved.</p>
  <p>"A  glance at the back of one of them brought disappointment, but when I turned  about its mate&mdash;You know what I found underneath the outer paper. You had laid  the will against the original backing and simply pasted another one over it.</p>
  <p>"That  the discovery came in time to cut short a very painful interview has made me  joyful for a week.</p>
  <p>"And  now may I see the children?"</p>
  <p align="center"><b>End Of  Problem V</b></p>
  <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Problem VI <br>
    The House Of Clocks</b></h2>
  <p>Miss  Strange was not in a responsive mood. This her employer had observed on first  entering; yet he showed no hesitation in laying on the table behind which she  had ensconced herself in the attitude of one besieged, an envelope thick with  enclosed papers.</p>
  <p>"There,"  said he. "Telephone me when you have read them."</p>
  <p>"I  shall not read them."</p>
  <p>"No?"  he smiled; and, repossessing himself of the envelope, he tore off one end,  extracted the sheets with which it was filled, and laid them down still  unfolded, in their former place on the table-top.</p>
  <p>The  suggestiveness of the action caused the corners of Miss Srange's delicate lips  to twitch wistfully, before settling into an ironic smile.</p>
  <p>Calmly  the other watched her.</p>
  <p>"I  am on a vacation," she loftily explained, as she finally met his studiously  non-quizzical glance. "Oh, I know that I am in my own home!" she petulantly  acknowledged, as his gaze took in the room; "and that the automobile is at the  door; and that I'm dressed for shopping. But for all that I'm on a vacation&mdash;a  mental one," she emphasized; "and business must wait. I haven't got over the  last affair," she protested, as he maintained a discreet silence, "and the  season is so gay just now&mdash;so many balls, so many&mdash;But that isn't the worst.  Father is beginning to wake up&mdash;and if he ever suspects&mdash;" A significant gesture  ended this appeal.</p>
  <p>The  personage knew her father&mdash;everyone did&mdash;and the wonder had always been that she  dared run the risk of displeasing one so implacable. Though she was his  favourite child, Peter Strange was known to be quite capable of cutting her off  with a shilling, once his close, prejudiced mind conceived it to be his duty.  And that he would so interpret the situation, if he ever came to learn the  secret of his daughter's fits of abstraction and the sly bank account she was  slowly accumulating, the personage holding out this dangerous lure had no doubt  at all. Yet he only smiled at her words and remarked in casual suggestion:</p>
  <p>"It's  out of town this time&mdash;'way out. Your health certainly demands a change of air."</p>
  <p>"My  health is good. Fortunately, or unfortunately, as one may choose to look at it,  it furnishes me with no excuse for an outing," she steadily retorted, turning  her back on the table.</p>
  <p>"Ah,  excuse me!" the insidious voice apologized, "your paleness misled me. Surely a  night or two's change might be beneficial."</p>
  <p>She  gave him a quick side look, and began to adjust her boa.</p>
  <p>To  this hint he paid no attention.</p>
  <p>"The  affair is quite out of the ordinary," he pursued in the tone of one rehearsing  a part. But there he stopped. For some reason, not altogether apparent to the masculine  mind, the pin of flashing stones (real stones) which held her hat in place had  to be taken out and thrust back again, not once, but twice. It was to watch  this performance he had paused. When he was ready to proceed, he took the  musing tone of one marshalling facts for another's enlightenment:</p>
  <p>"A  woman of unknown instincts&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Pshaw!"  The end of the pin would strike against the comb holding Violet's  chestnut-coloured locks.</p>
  <p>"Living  in a house as mysterious as the secret it contains. But&mdash;" here he allowed his  patience apparently to forsake him, "I will bore you no longer. Go to your teas  and balls; I will struggle with my dark affairs alone."</p>
  <p>His  hand went to the packet of papers she affected so ostentatiously to despise. He  could be as nonchalant as she. But he did not lift them; he let them lie. Yet  the young heiress had not made a movement or even turned the slightest glance  his way.</p>
  <p>"A  woman difficult to understand! A mysterious house&mdash;possibly a mysterious crime!"</p>
  <p>Thus  Violet kept repeating in silent self-communion, as flushed with dancing she sat  that evening in a highly-scented conservatory, dividing her attention between  the compliments of her partner and the splash of a fountain bubbling in the  heart of this mass of tropical foliage; and when some hours later she sat down  in her chintz-furnished bedroom for a few minutes' thought before retiring, it  was to draw from a little oak box at her elbow the half-dozen or so folded  sheets of closely written paper which had been left for her perusal by her  persistent employer.</p>
  <p>Glancing  first at the signature and finding it to be one already favourably known at the  bar, she read with avidity the statement of events thus vouched for, finding  them curious enough in all conscience to keep her awake for another full hour.</p>
  <p>We  here subscribe it:</p>
  <p>I  am a lawyer with an office in the Times Square Building. My business is mainly  local, but sometimes I am called out of town, as witness the following summons  received by me on the fifth of last October.</p>
  <p>DEAR  SIR,&mdash;</p>
  <p>I  wish to make my will. I am an invalid and cannot leave my room. Will you come  to me? The enclosed reference will answer for my respectability. If it  satisfies you and you decide to accommodate me, please hasten your visit; I  have not many days to live. A carriage will meet you at Highland Station at any  hour you designate. Telegraph reply.</p>
  <p>A.  Postlethwaite, Gloom Cottage, &mdash;, N. J.</p>
  <p>The  reference given was a Mr. Weed of Eighty-sixth Street&mdash;a well-known man of  unimpeachable reputation.</p>
  <p>Calling  him up at his business office, I asked him what he could tell me about Mr.  Postlethwaite of Gloom Cottage, &mdash;, N. J. The answer astonished me:</p>
  <p>"There  is no Mr. Postlethwaite to be found at that address. He died years ago. There  is a Mrs. Postlethwaite&mdash;a confirmed paralytic. Do you mean her?"</p>
  <p>I  glanced at the letter still lying open at the side of the telephone:</p>
  <p>"The  signature reads A. Postlethwaite."</p>
  <p>"Then  it's she. Her name is Arabella. She hates the name, being a woman of no  sentiment. Uses her initials even on her cheques. What does she want of you?"</p>
  <p>"To  draw her will."</p>
  <p>"Oblige  her. It'll be experience for you." And he slammed home the receiver.</p>
  <p>I  decided to follow the suggestion so forcibly emphasized; and the next day saw  me at Highland Station. A superannuated horse and a still more superannuated  carriage awaited me&mdash;both too old to serve a busy man in these days of swift  conveyance. Could this be a sample of the establishment I was about to enter?  Then I remembered that the woman who had sent for me was a helpless invalid, and  probably had no use for any sort of turnout.</p>
  <p>The  driver was in keeping with the vehicle, and as noncommittal as the plodding  beast he drove. If I ventured upon a remark, he gave me a long and curious  look; if I went so far as to attack him with a direct question, he responded  with a hitch of the shoulder or a dubious smile which conveyed nothing. Was he  deaf or just unpleasant? I soon learned that he was not deaf; for suddenly,  after a jog-trot of a mile or so through a wooded road which we had entered from  the main highway, he drew in his horse, and, without glancing my way, spoke his  first word:</p>
  <p>"This  is where you get out. The house is back there in the bushes."</p>
  <p>As  no house was visible and the bushes rose in an unbroken barrier along the road,  I stared at him in some doubt of his sanity.</p>
  <p>"But&mdash;"  I began; a protest into which he at once broke, with the sharp direction:</p>
  <p>"Take  the path. It'll lead you straight to the front door."</p>
  <p>"I  don't see any path."</p>
  <p>For  this he had no answer; and confident from his expression that it would be  useless to expect anything further from him, I dropped a coin into his hand,  and jumped to the ground. He was off before I could turn myself about.</p>
  <p>"'Something  is rotten in the State of Denmark,'" I quoted in startled comment to myself;  and not knowing what else to do, stared down at the turf at my feet.</p>
  <p>A  bit of flagging met my eye, protruding from a layer of thick moss. Farther on I  espied another&mdash;the second, probably, of many. This, no doubt, was the path I  had been bidden to follow, and without further thought on the subject, I  plunged into the bushes which with difficulty I made give way before me.</p>
  <p>For  a moment all further advance looked hopeless. A more tangled, uninviting  approach to a so-called home, I had never seen outside of the tropics; and the  complete neglect thus displayed should have prepared me for the appearance of  the house I unexpectedly came upon, just as, the way seemed on the point of  closing up before me.</p>
  <p>But  nothing could well prepare one for a first view of Gloom Cottage. Its location  in a hollow which had gradually filled itself up with trees and some kind of  prickly brush, its deeply stained walls, once picturesque enough in their  grouping but too deeply hidden now amid rotting boughs to produce any other effect  than that of shrouded desolation, the sough of these same boughs as they rapped  a devil's tattoo against each other, and the absence of even the rising column  of smoke which bespeaks domestic life wherever seen&mdash;all gave to one who  remembered the cognomen Cottage and forgot the pre-cognomen of Gloom, a sense  of buried life as sepulchral as that which emanates from the mouth of some  freshly opened tomb.</p>
  <p>But  these impressions, natural enough to my youth, were necessarily transient, and  soon gave way to others more business-like. Perceiving the curve of an arch  rising above the undergrowth still blocking my approach, I pushed my way  resolutely through, and presently found myself stumbling upon the steps of an  unexpectedly spacious domicile, built not of wood, as its name of Cottage had  led me to expect, but of carefully cut stone which, while showing every mark of  time, proclaimed itself one of those early, carefully erected Colonial  residences which it takes more than a century to destroy, or even to wear to  the point of dilapidation.</p>
  <p>Somewhat  encouraged, though failing to detect any signs of active life in the heavily  shuttered windows frowning upon me from either side, I ran up the steps and  rang the bell which pulled as hard as if no hand had touched it in years.</p>
  <p>Then  I waited.</p>
  <p>But  not to ring again; for just as my hand was approaching the bell a second time,  the door fell back and I beheld in the black gap before me the oldest man I had  ever come upon in my whole life. He was so old I was astonished when his drawn  lips opened and he asked if I was the lawyer from New York. I would as soon  have expected a mummy to wag its tongue and utter English, he looked so thin  and dried and removed from this life and all worldly concerns.</p>
  <p>But  when I had answered his question and he had turned to marshal me down the hall  towards a door I could dimly see standing open in the twilight of an absolutely  sunless interior, I noticed that his step was not without some vigour, despite  the feeble bend of his withered body and the incessant swaying of his head,  which seemed to be continually saying No!</p>
  <p>"I  will prepare madam," he admonished me, after drawing a ponderous curtain two  inches or less aside from one of the windows. "She is very ill, but she will  see you."</p>
  <p>The  tone was senile, but it was the senility of an educated man, and as the  cultivated accents wavered forth, my mind changed in regard to the position he  held in the house. Interested anew, I sought to give him another look, but he  had already vanished through the doorway, and so noiselessly, it was more like  a shadow's flitting than a man's withdrawal.</p>
  <p>The  darkness in which I sat was absolute; but gradually, as I continued to look  about me, the spaces lightened and certain details came out, which to my  astonishment were of a character to show that the plain if substantial exterior  of this house with its choked-up approaches and weedy gardens was no sample of  what was to be found inside. Though the walls surrounding me were dismal  because unlighted, they betrayed a splendour unusual in any country house. The  frescoes and paintings were of an ancient order, dating from days when life and  not death reigned in this isolated dwelling; but in them high art reigned  supreme, an art so high and so finished that only great wealth, combined with  the most cultivated taste, could have produced such effects. I was still  absorbed in the wonder of it all, when the quiet voice of the old gentleman who  had let me in reached me again from the doorway, and I heard:</p>
  <p>"Madam  is ready for you. May I trouble you to accompany me to her room."</p>
  <p>I  rose with alacrity. I was anxious to see madam, if only to satisfy myself that  she was as interesting as the house in which she was self-immured.</p>
  <p>I  found her a great deal more so. But before I enter upon our interview, let me  mention a fact which had attracted my attention in my passage to her room.  During his absence my guide evidently had pulled aside other curtains than  those of the room in which he had left me. The hall, no longer a tunnel of  darkness, gave me a glimpse as we went by, of various secluded corners, and it  seemed as if everywhere I looked I saw&mdash;a clock. I counted four before I reached  the staircase, all standing on the floor and all of ancient make, though  differing much in appearance and value. A fifth one rose grim and tall at the  stair foot, and under an impulse I have never understood I stopped, when I  reached it, to note the time. But it had paused in its task, and faced me with  motionless hands and silent works&mdash;a fact which somehow startled me; perhaps,  because just then I encountered the old man's eye watching me with an  expression as challenging as it was unintelligible.</p>
  <p>I  had expected to see a woman in bed. I saw instead, a woman sitting up. You felt  her influence the moment you entered her presence. She was not young; she was  not beautiful;&mdash;never had been I should judge,&mdash;she had not even the usual marks  about her of an ultra strong personality; but that her will was law, had always  been, and would continue to be law so long as she lived, was patent to any eye  at the first glance. She exacted obedience consciously and unconsciously, and  she exacted it with charm. Some few people in the world possess this power.  They frown, and the opposing will weakens; they smile, and all hearts succumb.  I was hers from the moment I crossed the threshold till&mdash;But I will relate the  happenings of that instant when it comes.</p>
  <p>She  was alone, or so I thought, when I made my first bow to her stern but not  unpleasing presence. Seated in a great chair, with a silver tray before her  containing such little matters as she stood in hourly need of, she confronted  me with a piercing gaze startling to behold in eyes so colourless. Then she  smiled, and in obedience to that smile I seated myself in a chair placed very  near her own. Was she too paralysed to express herself clearly? I waited in  some anxiety till she spoke, when this fear vanished. Her voice betrayed the  character her features failed to express. It was firm, resonant, and instinct  with command. Not loud, but penetrating, and of a quality which made one listen  with his heart as well as with his ears. What she said is immaterial. I was  there for a certain purpose and we entered immediately upon the business of  that purpose. She talked and I listened, mostly without comment. Only once did  I interrupt her with a suggestion; and as this led to definite results, I will  proceed to relate the occurrence in full.</p>
  <p>In  the few hours remaining to me before leaving New York, I had learned (no matter  how) some additional particulars concerning herself and family; and when after  some minor bequests, she proceeded to name the parties to whom she desired to  leave the bulk of her fortune, I ventured, with some astonishment at my own  temerity, to remark:</p>
  <p>"But  you have a young relative! Is she not to be included in this partition of your  property?"</p>
  <p>A  hush. Then a smile came to life on her stiff lips, such as is seldom seen,  thank God, on the face of any woman, and I heard:</p>
  <p>"The  young relative of whom you speak, is in the room. She has known for some time  that I have no intention of leaving anything to her. There is, in fact, small  chance of her ever needing it."</p>
  <p>The  latter sentence was a muttered one, but that it was loud enough to be heard in  all parts of the room I was soon assured. For a quick sigh, which was almost a  gasp, followed from a corner I had hitherto ignored, and upon glancing that  way, I perceived, peering upon us from the shadows, the white face of a young  girl in whose drawn features and wide, staring eyes I beheld such evidences of  terror, that in an instant, whatever predilection I had hitherto felt for my  client, vanished in distrust, if not positive aversion.</p>
  <p>I  was still under the sway of this new impression, when Mrs. Postlethwaite's  voice rose again, this time addressing the young girl:</p>
  <p>"You  may go," she said, with such force in the command for all its honeyed  modulation, that I expected to see its object fly the room in frightened  obedience.</p>
  <p>But  though the startled girl had lost none of the terror which had made her face  like a mask, no power of movement remained to her. A picture of hopeless  misery, she stood for one breathless moment, with her eyes fixed in  unmistakable appeal on mine; then she began to sway so helplessly that I leaped  with bounding heart to catch her. As she fell into my arms I heard her sigh as  before. No common anguish spoke in that sigh. I had stumbled unwittingly upon a  tragedy, to the meaning of which I held but a doubtful key.</p>
  <p>"She  seems very ill," I observed with some emphasis, as I turned to lay my helpless  burden on a near-by sofa.</p>
  <p>"She's  doomed."</p>
  <p>The  words were spoken with gloom and with an attempt at commiseration which no  longer rang true in my ears.</p>
  <p>"She  is as sick a woman as I am myself," continued Mrs. Postlethwaite. "That is why  I made the remark I did, never imagining she would hear me at that distance. Do  not put her down. My nurse will be here in a moment to relieve you of your  burden."</p>
  <p>A  tinkle accompanied these words. The resolute woman had stretched out a finger,  of whose use she was not quite deprived, and touched a little bell standing on  the tray before her, an inch or two from her hand.</p>
  <p>Pleased  to obey her command, I paused at the sofa's edge, and taking advantage of the  momentary delay, studied the youthful countenance pressed unconsciously to my  breast.</p>
  <p>It  was one whose appeal lay less in its beauty, though that was of a touching  quality, than in the story it told,&mdash;a story, which for some unaccountable  reason&mdash;I did not pause to determine what one&mdash;I felt it to be my immediate duty  to know. But I asked no questions then; I did not even venture a comment; and  yielded her up with seeming readiness when a strong but none too intelligent  woman came running in with arms outstretched to carry her off. When the door  had closed upon these two, the silence of my client drew my attention back to  herself.</p>
  <p>"I  am waiting," was her quiet observation, and without any further reference to  what had just taken place under our eyes, she went on with the business  previously occupying us.</p>
  <p>I  was able to do my part without any too great display of my own disturbance. The  clearness of my remarkable client's instructions, the definiteness with which  her mind was made up as to the disposal of every dollar of her vast property,  made it easy for me to master each detail and make careful note of every wish.  But this did not prevent the ebb and flow within me of an undercurrent of  thought full of question and uneasiness. What had been the real purport of the  scene to which I had just been made a surprised witness? The few, but certainly  unusual, facts which had been given me in regard to the extraordinary relations  existing between these two closely connected women will explain the intensity  of my interest. Those facts shall be yours.</p>
  <p>Arabella  Merwin, when young, was gifted with a peculiar fascination which, as we have  seen, had not altogether vanished with age. Consequently she had many lovers,  among them two brothers, Frank and Andrew Postlethwaite. The latter was the  older, the handsomer, and the most prosperous (his name is remembered yet in  connection with South American schemes of large importance), but it was Frank  she married.</p>
  <p>That  real love, ardent if unreasonable, lay at the bottom of her choice, is evident  enough to those who followed the career of the young couple. But it was a  jealous love which brooked no rival, and as Frank Postlethwaite was of an  impulsive and erratic nature, scenes soon occurred between them which, while  revealing the extraordinary force of the young wife's character, led to no serious  break till after her son was born, and this, notwithstanding the fact that  Frank had long given up making a living, and that they were openly dependent on  their wealthy brother, now fast approaching the millionaire status.</p>
  <p>This  brother&mdash;the Peruvian King, as some called him&mdash;must have been an extraordinary  man. Though cherishing his affection for the spirited Arabella to the point of  remaining a bachelor for her sake, he betrayed none of the usual signs of  disappointed love; but on the contrary made every effort to advance her  happiness, not only by assuring to herself and husband an adequate income, but  by doing all he could in other and less open ways to lessen any sense she might  entertain of her mistake in preferring for her lifemate his self-centred and  unstable brother. She should have adored him; but though she evinced gratitude  enough, there is nothing to prove that she ever gave Frank Postlethwaite the  least cause to cherish any other sentiment towards his brother than that of  honest love and unqualified respect. Perhaps he never did cherish any other.  Perhaps the change which everyone saw in the young couple immediately after the  birth of their only child was due to another cause. Gossip is silent on this  point. All that it insists upon is that from this time evidences of a growing  estrangement between them became so obvious that even the indulgent Andrew  could not blind himself to it; showing his sense of trouble, not by lessening  their income, for that he doubled, but by spending more time in Peru and less  in New York where the two were living.</p>
  <p>However,&mdash;and  here we enter upon those details which I have ventured to characterize as  uncommon, he was in this country and in the actual company of his brother when  the accident occurred which terminated both their lives. It was the old story  of a skidding motor, and Mrs. Postlethwaite, having been sent for in great  haste to the small inn into which the two injured men had been carried, arrived  only in time to witness their last moments. Frank died first and Andrew some  few minutes later&mdash;an important fact, as was afterwards shown when the latter's  will came to be read.</p>
  <p>This  will was a peculiar one. By its provisions the bulk of the King's great  property was left to his brother Frank, but with this especial stipulation that  in case his brother failed to survive him, the full legacy as bequeathed to him  should be given unconditionally to his widow. Frank's demise, as I have already  stated, preceded his brother's by several minutes and consequently Arabella became  the chief legatee; and that is how she obtained her millions. But&mdash;and here a  startling feature comes in&mdash;when the will came to be administered, the secret  underlying the break between Frank and his wife was brought to light by a  revelation of the fact that he had practised a great deception upon her at the  time of his marriage. Instead of being a bachelor as was currently believed, he  was in reality a widower, and the father of a child. This fact, so long held  secret, had become hers when her own child was born; and constituted as she  was, she not only never forgave the father, but conceived such a hatred for the  innocent object of their quarrel that she refused to admit its claims or even  to acknowledge its existence.</p>
  <p>But  later&mdash;after his death, in fact&mdash;she showed some sense of obligation towards one  who under ordinary conditions would have shared her wealth. When the whole  story became heard, and she discovered that this secret had been kept from his  brother as well as from herself, and that consequently no provision had been  made in any way for the child thus thrown directly upon her mercy, she did the  generous thing and took the forsaken girl into her own home. But she never  betrayed the least love for her, her whole heart being bound up in her boy, who  was, as all agree, a prodigy of talent.</p>
  <p>But  this boy, for all his promise and seeming strength of constitution, died when  barely seven years old, and the desolate mother was left with nothing to fill  her heart but the uncongenial daughter of her husband's first wife. The fact  that this child, slighted as it had hitherto been, would, in the event of her  uncle having passed away before her father, have been the undisputed heiress of  a large portion of the wealth now at the disposal of her arrogant step-mother,  led many to expect, now that the boy was no more, that Mrs. Postlethwaite would  proceed to acknowledge the little Helena as her heir, and give her that place  in the household to which her natural claims entitled her.</p>
  <p>But  no such result followed. The passion of grief into which the mother was thrown  by the shipwreck of all her hopes left her hard and implacable, and when, as  very soon happened, she fell a victim to the disease which tied her to her  chair and made the wealth which had come to her by such a peculiar ordering of  circumstances little else than a mockery even in her own eyes, it was upon this  child she expended the full fund of her secret bitterness.</p>
  <p>And  the child? What of her? How did she bear her unhappy fate when she grew old  enough to realize it? With a resignation which was the wonder of all who knew  her. No murmurs escaped her lips, nor was the devotion she invariably displayed  to the exacting invalid who ruled her as well as all the rest of her household  with a rod of iron ever disturbed by the least sign of reproach. Though the  riches, which in those early days poured into the home in a measure far beyond  the needs of its mistress, were expended in making the house beautiful rather  than in making the one young life within it happy, she never was heard to utter  so much as a wish to leave the walls within which fate had immured her.  Content, or seemingly content, with the only home she knew, she never asked for  change or demanded friends or amusements. Visitors ceased coming; desolation  followed neglect. The garden, once a glory, succumbed to a riot of weeds and  undesirable brush, till a towering wall seemed to be drawn about the house  cutting it off from the activities of the world as it cut it off from the  approach of sunshine by day, and the comfort of a star-lit heaven by night. And  yet the young girl continued to smile, though with a pitifulness of late, which  some thought betokened secret terror and others the wasting of a body too  sensitive for such unwholesome seclusion.</p>
  <p>These  were the facts, known if not consciously specialized, which gave to the latter  part of my interview with Mrs. Postlethwaite a poignancy of interest which had  never attended any of my former experiences. The peculiar attitude of Miss  Postlethwaite towards her indurate tormentor awakened in my agitated mind  something much deeper than curiosity, but when I strove to speak her name with  the intent of inquiring more particularly into her condition, such a look  confronted me from the steady eye immovably fixed upon my own, that my  courage&mdash;or was it my natural precaution&mdash;bade me subdue the impulse and risk no  attempt which might betray the depth of my interest in one so completely  outside the scope of the present moment's business. Perhaps Mrs. Postlethwaite  appreciated my struggle; perhaps she was wholly blind to it. There was no  reading the mind of this woman of sentimental name but inflexible nature, and  realizing the fact more fully with every word she uttered I left her at last  with no further betrayal of my feelings than might be evinced by the  earnestness with which I promised to return for her signature at the earliest  possible moment.</p>
  <p>This  she had herself requested, saying as I rose:</p>
  <p>"I  can still write my name if the paper is pushed carefully along under my hand.  See to it that you come while the power remains to me."</p>
  <p>I  had hoped that in my passage downstairs I might run upon someone who would give  me news of Miss Postlethwaite, but the woman who approached to conduct me  downstairs was not of an appearance to invite confidence, and I felt forced to  leave the house with my doubts unsatisfied.</p>
  <p>Two  memories, equally distinct, followed me. One was a picture of Mrs.  Postlethwaite's fingers groping among her belongings on the little tray perched  upon her lap, and another of the intent and strangely bent figure of the old  man who had acted as my usher, listening to the ticking of one of the great  clocks. So absorbed was he in this occupation that he not only failed to notice  me when I went by, but he did not even lift his head at my cheery greeting.  Such mysteries were too much for me, and led me to postpone my departure from  town till I had sought out Mrs. Postlethwaite's doctor and propounded to him  one or two leading questions. First, would Mrs. Postlethwaite's present condition  be likely to hold good till Monday; and secondly, was the young lady living  with her as ill as her step-mother said.</p>
  <p>He  was a mild old man of the easy-going type, and the answers I got from him were  far from satisfactory. Yet he showed some surprise when I mentioned the extent  of Mrs. Postlethwaite's anxiety about her step-daughter, and paused, in the  dubious shaking of his head, to give me a short stare in which I read as much  determination as perplexity.</p>
  <p>"I  will look into Miss Postlethwaite's case more particularly," were his parting  words. And with this one gleam of comfort I had to be content.</p>
  <p>Monday's  interview was a brief one and contained nothing worth repeating. Mrs.  Postlethwaite listened with stoical satisfaction to the reading of the will I had  drawn up, and upon its completion rang her bell for the two witnesses awaiting  her summons, in an adjoining room. They were not of her household, but to all  appearance honest villagers with but one noticeable characteristic, an  overweening idea of Mrs. Postlethwaite's importance. Perhaps the spell she had  so liberally woven for others in other and happier days was felt by them at  this hour. It would not be strange; I had almost fallen under it myself, so  great was the fascination of her manner even in this wreck of her bodily  powers, when triumph assured, she faced us all in a state of complete  satisfaction.</p>
  <p>But  before I was again quit of the place, all my doubts returned and in fuller  force than ever. I had lingered in my going as much as decency would permit,  hoping to hear a step on the stair or see a face in some doorway which would  contradict Mrs. Postlethwaite's cold assurance that Miss Postlethwaite was no  better. But no such step did I hear, and no face did I see save the old, old  one of the ancient friend or relative, whose bent frame seemed continually to  haunt the halls. As before, he stood listening to the monotonous ticking of one  of the clocks, muttering to himself and quite oblivious of my presence.</p>
  <p>However,  this time I decided not to pass him without a more persistent attempt to gain  his notice. Pausing at his side, I asked him in the friendly tone I thought  best calculated to attract his attention, how Miss Postlethwaite was to-day. He  was so intent upon his task, whatever that was, that while he turned my way, it  was with a glance as blank as that of a stone image.</p>
  <p>"Listen!"  he admonished me. "It still says No! No! I don't think it will ever say  anything else."</p>
  <p>I  stared at him in some consternation, then at the clock itself which was the tall  one I had found run down at my first visit. There was nothing unusual in its  quiet tick, so far as I could hear, and with a compassionate glance at the old  man who had turned breathlessly again to listen, proceeded on my way without  another word.</p>
  <p>The  old fellow was daft. A century old, and daft.</p>
  <p>I  had worked my way out through the vines which still encumbered the porch, and  was taking my first steps down the walk, when some impulse made me turn and  glance up at one of the windows.</p>
  <p>Did  I bless the impulse? I thought I had every reason for doing so, when through a  network of interlacing branches I beheld the young girl with whom my mind was  wholly occupied, standing with her head thrust forward, watching the descent of  something small and white which she had just released from her hand.</p>
  <p>A  note! A note written by her and meant for me! With a grateful look in her  direction (which was probably lost upon her as she had already drawn back out  of sight), I sprang for it only to meet with disappointment. For it was no  billet-doux I received from amid the clustering brush where it had fallen; but  a small square of white cloth showing a line of fantastic embroidery. Annoyed  beyond measure, I was about to fling it down again, when the thought that it  had come from her hand deterred me, and I thrust it into my vest pocket. When I  took it out again&mdash;which was soon after I had taken my seat in the car&mdash;I  discovered what a mistake I should have made if I had followed my first  impulse. For, upon examining the stitches more carefully, I perceived that what  I had considered a mere decorative pattern was in fact a string of letters, and  that these letters made words, and that these words were:</p>
  <p>IDONOTWANTTODIEBUTISURELYWILLIF</p>
  <p>Or,  in plain writing:</p>
  <p>"I  do not want to die, but I surely will if&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Finish  the sentence for me. That is the problem I offer you. It is not a case for the  police but one well worth your attention, if you succeed in reaching the heart  of this mystery and saving this young girl.</p>
  <p>Only,  let no delay occur. The doom, if doom it is, is immanent. Remember that the  will is signed.</p>
  <p>"She  is too small; I did not ask you to send me a midget."</p>
  <p>Thus  spoke Mrs. Postlethwaite to her doctor, as he introduced into her presence a  little figure in nurse's cap and apron. "You said I needed care,&mdash;more care than  I was receiving. I answered that my old nurse could give it, and you objected  that she or someone else must look after Miss Postlethwaite. I did not see the  necessity, but I never contradict a doctor. So I yielded to your wishes, but  not without the proviso (you remember that I made a proviso) that whatever sort  of young woman you chose to introduce into this room, she should not be fresh  from the training schools, and that she should be strong, silent, and capable.  And you bring me this mite of a woman&mdash;is she a woman? she looks more like a  child, of pleasing countenance enough, but who can no more lift me&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Pardon  me!" Little Miss Strange had advanced. "I think, if you will allow me the  privilege, madam, that I can shift you into a much more comfortable position."  And with a deftness and ease certainly not to be expected from one of her  slight physique, Violet raised the helpless invalid a trifle more upon her  pillow.</p>
  <p>The  act, its manner, and the smile accompanying it, could not fail to please, and  undoubtedly did, though no word rewarded her from lips not much given to speech  save when the occasion was imperative. But Mrs. Postlethwaite made no further  objection to her presence, and, seeing this, the doctor's countenance relaxed and  he left the room with a much lighter step than that with which he had entered  it.</p>
  <p>And  thus it was that Violet Strange&mdash;an adept in more ways than one&mdash;became installed  at the bedside of this mysterious woman, whose days, if numbered, still held  possibilities of action which those interested in young Helena Postlethwaite's  fate would do well to recognize.</p>
  <p>Miss  Strange had been at her post for two days, and had gathered up the following:</p>
  <p>That  Mrs. Postlethwaite must be obeyed.</p>
  <p>That  her step-daughter (who did not wish to die) would die if she knew it to be the  wish of this domineering but apparently idolized woman.</p>
  <p>That  the old man of the clocks, while senile in some regards, was very alert and  quite youthful in others. If a century old&mdash;which she began greatly to doubt&mdash;he  had the language and manner of one in his prime, when unaffected by the  neighbourhood of the clocks, which seemed in some non-understandable way to  exercise an occult influence over him. At table he was an entertaining host;  but neither there nor elsewhere would he discuss the family, or dilate in any  way upon the peculiarities of a household of which he manifestly regarded  himself as the least important member. Yet no one knew them better, and when  Violet became quite assured of this, as well as of the futility of looking for  explanation of any kind from either of her two patients, she resolved upon an  effort to surprise one from him.</p>
  <p>She  went about it in this way. Noting his custom of making a complete round of the  clocks each night after dinner, she took advantage of Mrs. Postlethwaite's  inclination to sleep at this hour, to follow him from clock to clock in the  hope of overhearing some portion of the monologue with which he bent his head  to the swinging pendulum, or put his ear to the hidden works. Soft-footed and  discreet, she tripped along at his back, and at each pause he made, paused  herself and turned her ear his way. The extreme darkness of the halls, which  were more sombre by night than by day, favoured this attempt, and she was able,  after a failure or two, to catch the No! no! no! no! which fell from his lips  in seeming repetition of what he heard the most of them say.</p>
  <p>The  satisfaction in his tone proved that the denial to which he listened, chimed in  with his hopes and gave ease to his mind. But he looked his oldest when, after  pausing at another of the many time-pieces, he echoed in answer to its special  refrain, Yes! yes! yes! yes! and fled the spot with shaking body and a  distracted air.</p>
  <p>The  same fear and the same shrinking were observable in him as he returned from  listening to the least conspicuous one, standing in a short corridor, where  Violet could not follow him. But when, after a hesitation which enabled her to  slip behind the curtain hiding the drawing-room door, he approached and laid  his ear against the great one standing, as if on guard, at the foot of the  stairs, she saw by the renewed vigour he displayed that there was comfort for  him in its message, even before she caught the whisper with which he left it  and proceeded to mount the stairs:</p>
  <p>"It  says No! It always says No! I will heed it as the voice of Heaven."</p>
  <p>But  one conclusion could be the result of such an experiment to a mind like  Violet's. This partly touched old man not only held the key to the secret of  this house, but was in a mood to divulge it if once he could be induced to hear  command instead of dissuasion in the tick of this one large clock. But how  could he be induced? Violet returned to Mrs. Postlethwaite's bedside in a mood  of extreme thoughtfulness.</p>
  <p>Another  day passed, and she had not yet seen Miss Postlethwaite. She was hoping each  hour to be sent on some errand to that young lady's room, but no such  opportunity was granted her. Once she ventured to ask the doctor, whose visits  were now very frequent, what he thought of the young lady's condition. But as  this question was necessarily put in Mrs. Postlethwaite's presence, the answer  was naturally guarded, and possibly not altogether frank.</p>
  <p>"Our  young lady is weaker," he acknowledged. "Much weaker," he added with marked  emphasis and his most professional air, "or she would be here instead of in her  own room. It grieves her not to be able to wait upon her generous  benefactress."</p>
  <p>The  word fell heavily. Had it been used as a test? Violet gave him a look, though she  had much rather have turned her discriminating eye upon the face staring up at  them from the pillow. Had the alarm expressed by others communicated itself at  last to the physician? Was the charm which had held him subservient to the  mother, dissolving under the pitiable state of the child, and was he trying to  aid the little detective-nurse in her effort to sound the mystery of her  condition?</p>
  <p>His  look expressed benevolence, but he took care not to meet the gaze of the woman  he had just lauded, possibly because that gaze was fixed upon him in a way to  tax his moral courage. The silence which ensued was broken by Mrs.  Postlethwaite:</p>
  <p>"She  will live&mdash;this poor Helena&mdash;how long?" she asked, with no break in her voice's  wonted music.</p>
  <p>The  doctor hesitated, then with a candour hardly to be expected from him, answered:</p>
  <p>"I  do not understand Miss Postlethwaite's case. I should like, with your  permission, to consult some New York physician."</p>
  <p>"Indeed!"</p>
  <p>A  single word, but as it left this woman's thin lips Violet recoiled, and,  perhaps, the doctor did. Rage can speak in one word as well as in a dozen, and  the rage which spoke in this one was of no common order, though it was quickly  suppressed, as was all other show of feeling when she added, with a touch of  her old charm:</p>
  <p>"Of  course you will do what you think best, as you know I never interfere with a  doctor's decisions. But" and here her natural ascendancy of tone and manner  returned in all its potency, "it would kill me to know that a stranger was  approaching Helena's bedside. It would kill her. She's too sensitive to survive  such a shock."</p>
  <p>Violet  recalled the words worked with so much care by this young girl on a minute  piece of linen, I do not want to die, and watched the doctor's face for some  sign of resolution. But embarrassment was all she saw there, and all she heard  him say was the conventional reply:</p>
  <p>"I  am doing all I can for her. We will wait another day and note the effect of my  latest prescription."</p>
  <p>Another  day!</p>
  <p>The  deathly calm which overspread Mrs. Postlethwaite's features as this word left  the physician's lips warned Violet not to let another day go by without some  action. But she made no remark, and, indeed, betrayed but little interest in  anything beyond her own patient's condition. That seemed to occupy her wholly.  With consummate art she gave the appearance of being under Mrs. Postlethwaite's  complete thrall, and watched with fascinated eyes every movement of the one  unstricken finger which could do so much.</p>
  <p>This  little detective of ours could be an excellent actor when she chose.</p>
  <p>III</p>
  <p>To  make the old man speak! To force this conscience-stricken but rebellious soul  to reveal what the clock forbade! How could it be done?</p>
  <p>This  continued to be Violet's great problem. She pondered it so deeply during all  the remainder of the day that a little pucker settled on her brow, which  someone (I will not mention who) would have been pained to see. Mrs.  Postlethwaite, if she noticed it at all, probably ascribed it to her anxieties  as nurse, for never had Violet been more assiduous in her attentions. But Mrs.  Postlethwaite was no longer the woman she had been, and possibly never noted it  at all.</p>
  <p>At  five o'clock Violet suddenly left the room. Slipping down into the lower hall,  she went the round of the clocks herself, listening to every one. There was no  perceptible difference in their tick. Satisfied of this and that it was simply  the old man's imagination which had supplied them each with separate speech,  she paused before the huge one at the foot of the stairs,&mdash;the one whose dictate  he had promised himself to follow,&mdash;and with an eye upon its broad, staring  dial, muttered wistfully:</p>
  <p>"Oh!  for an idea! For an idea!"</p>
  <p>Did  this cumbrous relic of old-time precision turn traitor at this ingenuous plea?  The dial continued to stare, the works to sing, but Violet's face suddenly lost  its perplexity. With a wary look about her and a listening ear turned towards  the stair top, she stretched out her hand and pulled open the door guarding the  pendulum, and peered in at the works, smiling slyly to herself as she pushed it  back into place and retreated upstairs to the sick room.</p>
  <p>When  the doctor came that night she had a quiet word with him outside Mrs.  Postlethwaite's door. Was that why he was on hand when old Mr. Dunbar stole  from his room to make his nightly circuit of the halls below? Something quite  beyond the ordinary was in the good physician's mind, for the look he cast at  the old man was quite unlike any he had ever bestowed upon him before, and when  he spoke it was to say with marked urgency:</p>
  <p>"Our  beautiful young lady will not live a week unless I get at the seat of her  malady. Pray that I may be enabled to do so, Mr. Dunbar."</p>
  <p>A  blow to the aged man's heart which called forth a feeble "Yes, yes," followed  by a wild stare which imprinted itself upon the doctor's memory as the look of  one hopelessly old, who hears for the first time a distinct call from the grave  which has long been awaiting him!</p>
  <p>A  solitary lamp stood in the lower hall. As the old man picked his slow way down,  its small, hesitating flame flared up as in a sudden gust, then sank down  flickering and faint as if it, too, had heard a call which summoned it to  extinction.</p>
  <p>No  other sign of life was visible anywhere. Sunk in twilight shadows, the  corridors branched away on either side to no place in particular and serving,  to all appearance (as many must have thought in days gone by), as a mere  hiding-place for clocks.</p>
  <p>To  listen to their united hum, the old man paused, looking at first a little  distraught, but settling at last into his usual self as he started forward upon  his course. Did some whisper, hitherto unheard, warn him that it was the last  time he would tread that weary round? Who can tell? He was trembling very much  when with his task nearly completed, he stepped out again into the main hall  and crept rather than walked back to the one great clock to whose dictum he  made it a practice to listen last.</p>
  <p>Chattering  the accustomed words, "They say Yes! They are all saying Yes! now; but this one  will say No!" he bent his stiff old back and laid his ear to the unresponsive  wood. But the time for no had passed. It was Yes! yes! yes! yes! now, and as  his straining ears took in the word, he appeared to shrink where he stood and  after a moment of anguished silence, broke forth into a low wail, amid whose  lamentations one could hear:</p>
  <p>"The  time has come! Even the clock she loves best bids me speak. Oh! Arabella,  Arabella!"</p>
  <p>In  his despair he had not noticed that the pendulum hung motionless, or that the  hands stood at rest on the dial. If he had, he might have waited long enough to  have seen the careful opening of the great clock's tall door and the stepping  forth of the little lady who had played so deftly upon his superstition.</p>
  <p>He  was wandering the corridors like a helpless child, when a gentle hand fell on  his arm and a soft voice whispered in his ear:</p>
  <p>"You  have a story to tell. Will you tell it to me? It may save Miss Postlethwaite's  life."</p>
  <p>Did  he understand? Would he respond if he did; or would the shock of her appeal  restore him to a sense of the danger attending disloyalty? For a moment she  doubted the wisdom of this startling measure, then she saw that he had passed  the point of surprise and that, stranger as she was, she had but to lead the  way for him to follow, tell his story, and die.</p>
  <p>There  was no light in the drawing-room when they entered. But old Mr. Dunbar did not  seem to mind that. Indeed, he seemed to have lost all consciousness of present  surroundings; he was even oblivious of her. This became quite evident when the  lamp, in flaring up again in the hall, gave a momentary glimpse, of his  crouching, half-kneeling figure. In the pleading gesture of his trembling,  outreaching arms, Violet beheld an appeal, not to herself, but to some phantom  of his imagination; and when he spoke, as he presently did, it was with the  freedom of one to whom speech is life's last boon, and the ear of the listener  quite forgotten in the passion of confession long suppressed.</p>
  <p>"She  has never loved me," he began, "but I have always loved her. For me no other  woman has ever existed, though I was sixty-five years of age when I first saw  her, and had long given up the idea that there lived a woman who could sway me  from my even life and fixed lines of duty. Sixty-five! and she a youthful  bride! Was there ever such folly! Happily I realized it from the first, and  piled ashes on my hidden flame. Perhaps that is why I adore her to this day and  only give her over to reprobation because Fate is stronger than my age&mdash;stronger  even than my love.</p>
  <p>"She  is not a good woman, but I might have been a good man if I had never known the  sin which drew a line of isolation about her, and within which I, and only I,  have stood with her in silent companionship. What was this sin, and in what did  it have its beginning? I think its beginning was in the passion she had for her  husband. It was not the every-day passion of her sex in this land of equable  affections, but one of foreign fierceness, jealousy, and insatiable demand. Yet  he was a very ordinary man. I was once his tutor and I know. She came to know  it too, when&mdash;but I am rushing on too fast, I have much to tell before I reach  that point.</p>
  <p>"From  the first, I was in their confidence. Not that either he or she put me there,  but that I lived with them and was always around, and could not help seeing and  hearing what went on between them. Why he continued to want me in the house and  at his table, when I could no longer be of service to him, I have never known.  Possibly habit explains all. He was accustomed to my presence and so was she;  so accustomed they hardly noticed it, as happened one night, when after a  little attempt at conversation, he threw down the book he had caught up and,  addressing her by name, said without a glance my way, and quite as if he were  alone with her:</p>
  <p>"'Arabella,  there is something I ought to tell you. I have tried to find the courage to do  so many times before now but have always failed. Tonight I must.' And then he  made his great disclosure,&mdash;how, unknown to, his friends and the world, he was a  widower when he married her, and the father of a living child.</p>
  <p>"With  some women this might have passed with a measure of regret, and some possible  contempt for his silence, but not so with her. She rose to her feet&mdash;I can see  her yet&mdash;and for a moment stood facing him in the still, overpowering manner of  one who feels the icy pang of hate enter where love has been. Never was moment  more charged. I could not breathe while it lasted; and when at last she spoke,  it was with an impetuosity of concentrated passion, hardly less dreadful than  her silence had been.</p>
  <p>" 'You  a father! A father already!' she cried, all her sweetness swallowed up in  ungovernable wrath. 'You whom I expected to make so happy with a child? I curse  you and your brat. I&mdash;'</p>
  <p>"He  strove to placate her, to explain. But rage has no ears, and before I realized  my own position, the scene became openly tempestuous. That her child should be  second to another woman's seemed to awaken demon instincts within her. When he  ventured to hint that his little girl needed a mother's care, her irony bit  like corroding acid. He became speechless before it and had not a protest to  raise when she declared that the secret he had kept so long and so successfully  he must continue to keep to his dying day. That the child he had failed to own  in his first wife's lifetime should remain disowned in hers, and if possible be  forgotten. She should never give the girl a thought nor acknowledge her in any  way.</p>
  <p>"She  was Fury embodied; but the fury was of that grand order which allures rather  than repels. As I felt myself succumbing to its fascination and beheld how he  was weakening under it even more perceptibly than myself, I started from my  chair, and sought to glide away before I should hear him utter a fatal  acquiescence.</p>
  <p>"But  the movement I made unfortunately drew their attention to me, and after an  instant of silent contemplation of my distracted countenance, Frank said, as  though he were the elder by the forty years which separated us:</p>
  <p>"'You  have listened to Mrs. Postlethwaite's wishes. You will respect them of  course.'"</p>
  <p>That  was all. He knew and she knew that I was to be trusted; but neither of them has  ever known why.</p>
  <p>A  month later her child came, and was welcomed as though it were the first to  bear his name. It was a boy, and their satisfaction was so great that I looked  to see their old affection revive. But it had been cleft at the root, and  nothing could restore it to life. They loved the child; I have never seen  evidence of greater parental passion than they both displayed, but there their  feelings stopped. Towards each other they were cold. They did not even unite in  worship of their treasure. They gloated over him and planned for him, but  always apart. He was a child in a thousand, and as he developed, the mother  especially, nursed all her energies for the purpose of ensuring for him a  future commensurate with his talents. Never a very conscientious woman, and  alive to the advantages of wealth as demonstrated by the power wielded by her  rich brother-in-law, she associated all the boy's prospects with money, great  money, such money as Andrew had accumulated, and now had at his disposal for  his natural heirs.</p>
  <p>"Hence  came her great temptation,&mdash;a temptation to which she yielded, to the lasting  trouble of us all. Of this I must now make confession though it kills me to do  so, and will soon kill her. The deeds of the past do not remain buried, however  deep we dig their graves, but rise in an awful resurrection when we are  old&mdash;old&mdash;"</p>
  <p>Silence.  Then a tremulous renewal of his painful speech.</p>
  <p>Violet  held her breath to listen. Possibly the doctor, hidden in the darkest corner of  the room, did so also.</p>
  <p>"I  never knew how she became acquainted with the terms of her brother-in-law's  will. He certainly never confided them to her, and as certainly the lawyer who  drew up the document never did. But that she was well aware of its tenor is as  positive a fact as that I am the most wretched man alive tonight. Otherwise,  why the darksome deed into which she was betrayed when both the brothers lay  dying among strangers, of a dreadful accident?"</p>
  <p>"I  was witness to that deed. I had accompanied her on her hurried ride and was at  her side when she entered the inn where the two Postlethwaites lay. I was  always at her side in great joy or in great trouble, though she professed no  affection for me and gave me but scanty thanks."</p>
  <p>"During  our ride she had been silent and I had not disturbed that silence. I had much  to think of. Should we find him living, or should we find him dead? If dead,  would it sever the relations between us two? Would I ever ride with her again?"</p>
  <p>"When  I was not dwelling on this theme, I was thinking of the parting look she gave  her boy; a look which had some strange promise in it. What had that look meant  and why did my flesh creep and my mind hover between dread and a fearsome  curiosity when I recalled it? Alas! There was reason for all these sensations  as I was soon to learn.</p>
  <p>"We  found the inn seething with terror and the facts worse than had been  represented in the telegram. Her husband was dying. She had come just in time  to witness the end. This they told her before she had taken off her veil. If  they had waited&mdash;if I had been given a full glimpse of her face&mdash;But it was  hidden, and I could only judge of the nature of her emotions by the stern way  in which she held herself.</p>
  <p>"'Take  me to him,' was the quiet command, with which she met this disclosure. Then,  before any of them could move:</p>
  <p>"'And  his brother, Mr. Andrew Postlethwaite? Is he fatally injured too?'</p>
  <p>"The  reply was unequivocal. The doctors were uncertain which of the two would pass  away first.</p>
  <p>"You  must remember that at this time I was ignorant of the rich man's will, and  consequently of how the fate of a poor child of whom I had heard only one  mention, hung in the balance at that awful moment. But in the breathlessness  which seized Mrs. Postlethwaite at this sentence of double death, I realized  from my knowledge of her that something more than grief was at prey upon her  impenetrable heart, and shuddered to the core of my being when she repeated in that  voice which was so terrible because so expressionless:</p>
  <p>"'Take  me to them.'"</p>
  <p>They  were lying in one room, her husband nearest the door, the other in a small  alcove some ten feet away. Both were unconscious; both were surrounded by  groups of frightened attendants who fell back as she approached. A doctor stood  at the bed-head of her husband, but as her eye met his he stepped aside with a  shake of the head and left the place empty for her.</p>
  <p>"The  action was significant. I saw that she understood what it meant, and with  constricted heart watched her as she bent over the dying man and gazed into his  wide-open eyes, already sightless and staring. Calculation was in her look and  calculation only; and calculation, or something equally unintelligible, sent  her next glance in the direction of his brother. What was in her mind? I could  understand her indifference to Frank even at the crisis of his fate, but not  the interest she showed in Andrew. It was an absorbing one, altering her whole  expression. I no longer knew her for my dear young madam, and the jealousy I  had never felt towards Frank rose to frantic resentment in my breast as I  beheld what very likely might be a tardy recognition of the other's well-known  passion, forced into disclosure by the exigencies of the moment.</p>
  <p>"Alarmed  by the strength of my feelings, and fearing an equal disclosure on my own part,  I sought for a refuge from all eyes and found it in a little balcony opening  out at my right. On to this balcony I stepped and found myself face to face  with a star-lit heaven. Had I only been content with my isolation and the  splendour of the spectacle spread out before me! But no, I must look back upon  that bed and the solitary woman standing beside it! I must watch the settling  of her body into rigidity as a voice rose from beside the other Postlethwaite  saying, 'It is a matter of minutes now,' and then&mdash;and then&mdash;the slow creeping of  her hand to her husband's mouth, the outspreading of her palm across the livid  lips&mdash;its steady clinging there, smothering the feeble gasps of one already  moribund, till the quivering form grew still, and Frank Postlethwaite lay dead  before my eyes!</p>
  <p>"I  saw, and made no outcry, but she did, bringing the doctor back to her side with  the startled exclamation:</p>
  <p>"'Dead?  I thought he had an hour's life left in him, and he has passed before his  brother.'</p>
  <p>"I  thought it hate&mdash;the murderous impulse of a woman who sees her enemy at her  mercy and can no longer restrain the passion of her long-cherished antagonism;  and while something within me rebelled at the act, I could not betray her,  though silence made a murderer of me too. I could not. Her spell was upon me as  in another instant it was upon everyone else in the room. No suspicion of one  so self-repressed in her sadness disturbed the universal sympathy; and  encouraged by this blindness of the crowd, I vowed within myself never to  reveal her secret. The man was dead, or as good as dead, when she touched him;  and now that her hate was expended she would grow gentle and good.</p>
  <p>"But  I knew the worthlessness of this hope as well as my misconception of her  motive, when Frank's child by another wife returned to my memory, and Bella's  sin stood exposed."</p>
  <p>"But  only to myself. I alone knew that the fortune now wholly hers, and in  consequence her boy's, had been won by a crime. That if her hand had fallen in  comfort on her husband's forehead instead of in pressure on his mouth, he would  have outlived his brother long enough to have become owner of his millions; in  which case a rightful portion would have been insured to his daughter, now left  a penniless waif. The thought made my hair rise, as the proceedings over, I  faced her and made my first and last effort to rid my conscience of its new and  intolerable burden.</p>
  <p>"But  the woman I had known and loved was no longer before me. The crown had touched  her brows, and her charm which had been mainly sexual up to this hour had  merged into an intellectual force, with which few men's mentality could cope.  Mine yielded at once to it. From the first instant, I knew that a slavery of  spirit, as well as of heart, was henceforth to be mine.</p>
  <p>"She  did not wait for me to speak; she had assumed the dictator's attitude at once.</p>
  <p>"'I  know of what you are thinking,'" said she, "'and it is a subject you may  dismiss at once from your mind. Mr. Postlethwaite's child by his first wife is  coming to live with us. I have expressed my wishes in this regard to my lawyer,  and there is nothing left to be said. You, with your close mouth and dependable  nature, are to remain here as before, and occupy the same position towards my  boy that you did towards his father. We shall move soon into a larger house,  and the nature of our duties will be changed and their scope greatly increased;  but I know that you can be trusted to enlarge with them and meet every  requirement I shall see fit to make. Do not try to express your thanks. I see  them in your face.'</p>
  <p>"Did  she, or just the last feeble struggle my conscience was making to break the  bonds in which she held me, and win back my own respect? I shall never know,  for she left me on completion of this speech, not to resume the subject, then  or ever.</p>
  <p>"But  though I succumbed outwardly to her demands, I had not passed the point where  inner conflict ends and peace begins. Her recognition of Helena and her reception  into the family calmed me for a while, and gave me hope that all would yet be  well. But I had never sounded the full bitterness of madam's morbid heart, well  as I thought I knew it. The hatred she had felt from the first for her  husband's child ripened into frenzied dislike when she found her a living image  of the mother whose picture she had come across among Frank's personal effects.  To win a tear from those meek eyes instead of a smile to the sensitive lips was  her daily play. She seemed to exult in the joy of impressing upon the girl by  how little she had missed a great fortune, and I have often thought, much as I  tried to keep my mind free from all extravagant and unnecessary fancies, that  half of the money she spent in beautifying this house and maintaining art  industries and even great charitable institutions was spent with the base  purpose of demonstrating to this child the power of immense wealth, and in what  ways she might expect to see her little brother expend the millions in which  she had been denied all share.</p>
  <p>"I  was so sure of this that one night while I was winding up the clocks with which  Mrs. Postlethwaite in her fondness for old timepieces has filled the house, I  stopped to look at the little figure toiling so wearily upstairs, to bed, without  a mother's kiss. There was an appeal in the small wistful face which smote my  hard old heart, and possibly a tear welled up in my own eye when I turned back  to my duty."</p>
  <p>"Was  that why I felt the hand of Providence upon me, when in my halt before the one  clock to which any superstitious interest was attached&mdash;the great one at the  foot of the stairs&mdash;I saw that it had stopped and at the one minute of all  minutes in our wretched lives: Four minutes past two? The hour, the minute in  which Frank Postlethwaite had gasped his last under the pressure of his wife's  hand! I knew it&mdash;the exact minute I mean&mdash;because Providence meant that I should  know it. There had been a clock on the mantelpiece of the hotel room where he  and his brother had died and I had seen her glance steal towards it at the  instant she withdrew her palm from her husband's lips. The stare of that dial  and the position of its hands had lived still in my mind as I believed it did  in hers.</p>
  <p>"Four  minutes past two! How came our old timepiece here to stop at that exact moment  on a day when Duty was making its last demand upon me to remember Frank's  unhappy child? There was no one to answer; but as I looked and looked, I felt  the impulse of the moment strengthen into purpose to leave those hands undisturbed  in their silent accusation. She might see, and, moved by the coincidence,  tremble at her treatment of Helena.</p>
  <p>"But  if this happened&mdash;if she saw and trembled&mdash;she gave no sign. The works were  started up by some other hand, and the incident passed. But it left me with an  idea. That clock soon had a way of stopping and always at that one instant of  time. She was forced at length to notice it, and I remember, an occasion when  she stood stock-still with her eyes on those hands, and failed to find the  banister with her hand, though she groped for it in her frantic need for  support.</p>
  <p>"But  no command came from her to remove the worn-out piece, and soon its tricks, and  every lesser thing, were forgotten in the crushing calamity which befell us in  the sickness and death of little Richard.</p>
  <p>"Oh,  those days and nights! And oh, the face of the mother when the doctors told her  that the case was hopeless! I asked myself then, and I have asked myself a  hundred times since, which of all the emotions I saw pictured there bit the  deepest, and made the most lasting impression on her guilty heart? Was it  remorse? If so, she showed no change in her attitude towards Helena, unless it  was by an added bitterness. The sweet looks and gentle ways of Frank's young  daughter could not win against a hate sharpened by disappointment. Useless for  me to hope for it. Release from the remorse of years was not to come in that  way. As I realized this, I grew desperate and resorted again to the old trick  of stopping the clock at the fatal hour. This time her guilty heart responded.  She acknowledged the stab and let all her miseries appear. But how? In a way to  wring my heart almost to madness, and not benefit the child at all. She had her  first stroke that night. I had made her a helpless invalid.</p>
  <p>"That  was eight years ago, and since then what? Stagnation. She lived with her  memories, and I with mine. Helena only had a right to hope, and hope perhaps  she did, till&mdash;Is that the great clock talking? Listen! They all talk, but I  heed only the one. What does it say? Tell! tell! tell! Does it think I will be  silent now when I come to my own guilt? That I will seek to hide my weakness  when I could not hide her sin?"</p>
  <p>"Explain!"  It was Violet speaking, and her tone was stern in its command. "Of what guilt  do you speak? Not of guilt towards Helena; you pitied her too much&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"But  I pitied my dear madam more. It was that which affected me and drew me into  crime against my will. Besides, I did not know&mdash;not at first&mdash;what was in the  little bowl of curds and cream I carried to the girl each day. She had eaten  them in her step-mother's room, and under her step-mother's eye as long as she  had strength to pass from room to room, and how was I to guess that it was not  wholesome? Because she failed in health from day to day? Was not my dear madam  failing in health also; and was there poison in her cup? Innocent at that time,  why am I not innocent now? Because&mdash;Oh, I will tell it all; as though at the bar  of God. I will tell all the secrets of that day.</p>
  <p>"She  was sitting with her hand trembling on the tray from which I had just lifted  the bowl she had bid me carry to Helena. I had seen her so a hundred times  before, but not with just that look in her eyes, or just that air of desolation  in her stony figure. Something made me speak; something made me ask if she were  not quite so well as usual, and something made her reply with the dreadful  truth that the doctor had given her just two months more to live. My fright and  mad anguish stupefied me; for I was not prepared for this, no, not at all;&mdash;and  unconsciously I stared down at the bowl I held, unable to breathe or move or  even to meet her look."</p>
  <p>As  usual she misinterpreted my emotion.</p>
  <p>"'Why  do you stand like that?' I heard her say in a tone of great irritation. 'And  why do you stare into that bowl? Do you think I mean to leave that child to  walk these halls after I am carried out of them forever? Do you measure my hate  by such a petty yard-stick as that? I tell you that I would rot above ground  rather than enter it before she did?'</p>
  <p>"I  had believed I knew this woman; but what soul ever knows another's? What soul  ever knows itself?</p>
  <p>"'Bella!'  I cried; the first time I had ever presumed to address her so intimately.  'Would you poison the girl?' And from sheer weakness my fingers lost their  clutch, and the bowl fell to the floor, breaking into a dozen pieces.</p>
  <p>"For  a minute she stared down at these from over her tray, and then she remarked  very low and very quietly:</p>
  <p>"'Another  bowl, Humphrey, and fresh curds from the kitchen. I will do the seasoning. The  doses are too small to be skipped. You won't?'&mdash;I had shaken my head&mdash;'But you  will! It will not be the first time you have gone down the hall with this  mixture.'</p>
  <p>"'But  that was before I knew&mdash;' I began.</p>
  <p>"'And  now that you do, you will go just the same.' Then as I stood hesitating, a  thousand memories overwhelming me in an instant, she added in a voice to tear  the heart, 'Do not make me hate the only being left in this world who  understands and loves me.'</p>
  <p>"She  was a helpless invalid, and I a broken man, but when that word 'love' fell from  her lips, I felt the blood start burning in my veins, and all the crust of  habit and years of self-control loosen about my heart, and make me young again.  What if her thoughts were dark and her wishes murderous! She was born to rule  and sway men to her will even to their own undoing."</p>
  <p>"'I  wish I might kiss your hand,' was what I murmured, gazing at her white fingers  groping over her tray.</p>
  <p>"'You  may,' she answered, and hell became heaven to me for a brief instant. Then I  lifted myself and went obediently about my task.</p>
  <p>"But  puppet though I was, I was not utterly without sympathy. When I entered  Helena's room and saw how her startled eyes fell shrinkingly on the bowl I set  down before her, my conscience leaped to life and I could not help saying:</p>
  <p>"'Don't  you like the curds, Helena? Your brother used to love them very much.'</p>
  <p>"'His  were&mdash;'</p>
  <p>"'What,  Helena?'</p>
  <p>"'What  these are not,' she murmured.</p>
  <p>"I  stared at her, terror-stricken. So she knew, and yet did not seize the bowl and  empty it out of the window! Instead, her hand moved slowly towards it and drew  it into place before her.</p>
  <p>"'Yet  I must eat,' she said, lifting her eyes to mine in a sort of patient despair,  which yet was without accusation.</p>
  <p>"But  my hand had instinctively gone to hers and grasped it.</p>
  <p>"'Why  must you eat it?' I asked. 'If&mdash;if you do not find it wholesome, why do you  touch it?'</p>
  <p>"'Because  my step-mother expects me to,' she cried, 'and I have no other will than hers.  When I was a little, little child, my father made me promise that if I ever  came to live with her I would obey her simplest wish. And I always have. I will  not disappoint the trust he put in me.'</p>
  <p>"'Even  if you die of it?'</p>
  <p>"I  do not know whether I whispered these words or only thought them. She answered  as though I had spoken.</p>
  <p>"'I  am not afraid to die. I am more afraid to live. She may ask me some day to do  something I feel to be wrong.'</p>
  <p>"When  I fled down the hall that night, I heard one of the small clocks speak to me.  Tell! it cried, tell! tell! tell! tell! I rushed away from it with beaded  forehead and rising hair.</p>
  <p>"Then  another's note piped up. No it droned. No! no! no! no! I stopped and took  heart. Disgrace the woman I loved, on the brink of the grave? I&mdash;, who asked no  other boon from heaven than to see her happy, gracious, and good? Impossible. I  would obey the great clock's voice; the others were mere chatterboxes.</p>
  <p>"But  it has at last changed its tune, for some reason, quite changed its tune. Now,  it is Yes! Yes! instead of No! and in obeying it I save Helena. But what of  Bella? and O God, what of myself?"</p>
  <p>A  sigh, a groan, then a long and heavy silence, into which there finally broke  the pealing of the various clocks striking the hour. When all were still again  and Violet had drawn aside the portiere, it was to see the old man on his  knees, and between her and the thin streak of light entering from the hall, the  figure of the doctor hastening to Helena's bedside.</p>
  <p>When  with inducements needless to name, they finally persuaded the young girl to  leave her unholy habitation, it was in the arms which had upheld her once  before, and to a life which promised to compensate her for her twenty years of  loneliness and unsatisfied longing.</p>
  <p>But  a black shadow yet remained which she must cross before reaching the sunshine!</p>
  <p>It  lay at her step-mother's door.</p>
  <p>In  the plans made for Helena's release, Mrs. Postlethwaite's consent had not been  obtained nor was she supposed to be acquainted with the doctor's intentions  towards the child whose death she was hourly awaiting.</p>
  <p>It  was therefore with an astonishment, bordering on awe, that on their way  downstairs, they saw the door of her room open and herself standing alone and  upright on the threshold&mdash;she who had not been seen to take a step in years. In  the wonder of this miracle of suddenly restored power, the little procession  stopped,&mdash;the doctor with his hand upon the rail, the lover with his burden  clasped yet more protectingly to his breast. That a little speech awaited them  could be seen from the force and fury of the gaze which the indomitable woman  bent upon the lax and half-unconscious figure she beheld thus sheltered and  conveyed. Having but one arrow left in her exhausted quiver, she launched it  straight at the innocent breast which had never harboured against her a defiant  thought.</p>
  <p>"Ingrate!"  was the word she hurled in a voice from which all its seductive music had gone  forever. "Where are you going? Are they carrying you alive to your grave?"</p>
  <p>A  moan from Helena's pale lips, then silence. She had fainted at that barbed  attack. But there was one there who dared to answer for her and he spoke  relentlessly. It was the man who loved her.</p>
  <p>"No,  madam. We are carrying her to safety. You must know what I mean by that. Let  her go quietly and you may die in peace. Otherwise&mdash;"</p>
  <p>She  interrupted him with a loud call, startling into life the echoes of that  haunted hall:</p>
  <p>"Humphrey!  Come to me, Humphrey!"</p>
  <p>But  no Humphrey appeared.</p>
  <p>Another  call, louder and more peremptory than before:</p>
  <p>"Humphrey!  I say, Humphrey!"</p>
  <p>But  the answer was the same&mdash;silence, and only silence. As the horror of this grew,  the doctor spoke:</p>
  <p>"Mr.  Humphrey Dunbar's ears are closed to all earthly summons. He died last night at  the very hour he said he would&mdash;four minutes after two."</p>
  <p>"Four  minutes after two!" It came from her lips in a whisper, but with a revelation  of her broken heart and life. "Four minutes after two!" And defiant to the  last, her head rose, and for an instant, for a mere breath of time, they saw  her as she had looked in her prime, regal in form, attitude, and expression;  then the will which had sustained her through so much, faltered and succumbed,  and with a final reiteration of the words "Four minutes after two!" she broke  into a rattling laugh, and fell back into the arms of her old nurse.</p>
  <p>And  below, one clock struck the hour and then another. But not the big one at the  foot of the stairs. That still stood silent, with its hands pointing to the  hour and minute of Frank Postlethwaite's hastened death.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>End Of  Problem VI</b></p>
  <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Problem VII <br>
    The Doctor, His Wife, And The Clock</b></h2>
  <p>Violet  had gone to her room. She had a task before her. That afternoon, a packet had  been left at the door, which, from a certain letter scribbled in one corner,  she knew to be from her employer. The contents of that packet must be read, and  she had made herself comfortable with the intention of setting to work at once.  But ten o'clock struck and then eleven before she could bring herself to give  any attention to the manuscript awaiting her perusal. In her present mood, a  quiet sitting by the fire, with her eyes upon the changeful flame, was  preferable to the study of any affair her employer might send her. Yet, because  she was conscious of the duty she thus openly neglected, she sat crouched over  her desk with her hand on the mysterious packet, the string of which, however,  she made no effort to loosen.</p>
  <p>What  was she thinking of?</p>
  <p>We  are not alone in our curiosity on this subject. Her brother Arthur, coming  unperceived into the room, gives tokens of a similar interest. Never before had  he seen her oblivious to an approaching step; and after a momentary  contemplation of her absorbed figure, so girlishly sweet and yet so deeply  intent, he advances to her side, and peering earnestly into her face, observes  with a seriousness quite unusual to him:</p>
  <p>"Puss,  you are looking worried,&mdash;not like yourself at all. I've noticed it for some  time. What's up. Getting tired of the business?"</p>
  <p>"No&mdash;not  altogether&mdash;that is, it's not that, if it's anything. I'm not sure that it's  anything. I&mdash;"</p>
  <p>She  had turned back to her desk and was pushing about the various articles with  which it was plentifully bespread; but this did not hide the flush which had  crept into her cheeks and even dyed the snowy whiteness of her neck. Arthur's  astonishment at this evidence of emotion was very great; but he said nothing,  only watched her still more closely, as with a light laugh she regained her  self-possession, and with the practical air of a philosopher uttered this trite  remark:</p>
  <p>"Everyone  has his sober moments. I was only thinking&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Of  some new case?"</p>
  <p>"Not  exactly." The words came softly but with a touch of mingled humour and gravity  which made Arthur stare again.</p>
  <p>"See  here, Puss!" he cried. His tone had changed. "I've just come up from the den.  Father and I have had a row&mdash;a beastly row."</p>
  <p>"A  row? You and father? Oh, Arthur, I don't like that. Don't quarrel with father.  Don't, don't. Some day he and I may have a serious difference about what I am  doing. Don't let him feel that he has lost us all."</p>
  <p>"That's  all right, Puss; but I've got to think of you a bit. I can't see you spoil all  your good times with these police horrors and not do something to help.  To-morrow I begin life as a salesman in Clarke &amp; Stebbin's. The salary is  not great, but every little helps and I don't dislike the business. But father  does. He had rather see me loafing about town setting the fashions for fellows  as idle as myself than soil my hands with handling merchandise. That's why we  quarreled. But don't worry. Your name didn't come up, or&mdash;or&mdash;you know whose. He  hasn't an idea of why I want to work&mdash;There, Violet there!"</p>
  <p>Two  soft arms were around his neck and Violet was letting her heart out in a  succession of sisterly kisses.</p>
  <p>"O,  Arthur, you good, good boy! Together we'll soon make up the amount, and then&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Then  what?"</p>
  <p>A sweet  soft look robbed her face of its piquancy, but gave it an aspect of  indescribable beauty quite new to Arthur's eyes.</p>
  <p>Tapping  his lips with a thoughtful forefinger, he asked:</p>
  <p>"Who  was that sombre-looking chap I saw bowing to you as we came out of church last  Sunday?"</p>
  <p>She  awoke from her dreamy state with an astonishing quickness.</p>
  <p>"He?  Surely you remember him. Have you forgotten that evening in Massachusetts&mdash;the  grotto&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  it's Upjohn, is it? Yes, I remember him. He's fond of church, isn't he? That  is, when he's in New York."</p>
  <p>Her  lips took a roguish curve then a very serious one; but she made no answer.</p>
  <p>"I  have noticed that he's always in his seat and always looking your way."</p>
  <p>"That's  very odd of him," she declared, her dimples coming and going in a most  bewildering fashion. "I can't imagine why he should do that."</p>
  <p>"Nor  I,&mdash;" retorted Arthur with a smile. "But he's human, I suppose. Only do be  careful, Violet. A man so melancholy will need a deal of cheering."</p>
  <p>He  was gone before he had fully finished this daring remark, and Violet, left  again with her thoughts, lost her glowing colour but not her preoccupation. The  hand which lay upon the packet already alluded to did not move for many  minutes, and when she roused at last to the demands of her employer, it was  with a start and a guilty look at the small gold clock ticking out its  inexorable reminder.</p>
  <p>"He  will want an answer the first thing in the morning," she complained to herself.  And opening the packet, she took out first a letter, and then a mass of  typewritten manuscript.</p>
  <p>She  began with the letter which was as characteristic of the writer as all the  others she had had from his hand; as witness:</p>
  <p>You  probably remember the Hasbrouck murder,&mdash;or, perhaps, you don't; it being one of  a time previous to your interest in such matters. But whether you remember it  or not, I beg you to read the accompanying summary with due care and attention  to business. When you have well mastered it with all its details, please  communicate with me in any manner most convenient to yourself, for I shall have  a word to say to you then, which you may be glad to hear, if as you have lately  intimated you need to earn but one or two more substantial rewards in order to  cry halt to the pursuit for which you have proved yourself so well qualified.</p>
  <p>The  story, in deference to yourself as a young and much preoccupied woman, has been  written in a way to interest. Though the work of an everyday police detective,  you will find in it no lack of mystery or romance; and if at the end you  perceive that it runs, as such cases frequently do, up against a perfectly  blank wall, you must remember that openings can be made in walls, and that the  loosening of one weak stone from its appointed place, sometimes leads to the  downfall of all.</p>
  <p>So  much for the letter.</p>
  <p>Laying  it aside, with a shrug of her expressive shoulders, Violet took up the  manuscript.</p>
  <p>Let  us take it up too. It runs thus:</p>
  <p>On  the 17th of July, 19&mdash;, a tragedy of no little interest occurred in one of the  residences of the Colonnade in Lafayette Place.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Hasbrouck, a well known and highly respected citizen, was attacked in his room  by an unknown assailant, and shot dead before assistance could reach him. His  murderer escaped, and the problem offered to the police was how to identify  this person who, by some happy chance or by the exercise of the most remarkable  forethought, had left no traces behind him, or any clue by which he could be  followed.</p>
  <p>The  details of the investigation which ended so unsatisfactorily are here given by  the man sent from headquarters at the first alarm.</p>
  <p>When,  some time after midnight on the date above mentioned, I reached Lafayette  Place, I found the block lighted from end to end. Groups of excited men and  women peered from the open doorways, and mingled their shadows with those of  the huge pillars which adorn the front of this picturesque block of dwellings.</p>
  <p>The  house in which the crime had been committed was near the centre of the row,  and, long before I reached it, I had learned from more than one source that the  alarm was first given to the street by a woman's shriek, and secondly by the  shouts of an old man-servant who had appeared, in a half-dressed condition, at  the window of Mr. Hasbrouck's room, crying "Murder! murder!"</p>
  <p>But  when I had crossed the threshold, I was astonished at the paucity of facts to  be gleaned from the inmates themselves. The old servant, who was the first to  talk, had only this account of the crime to give:</p>
  <p>The  family, which consisted of Mr. Hasbrouck, his wife, and three servants, had  retired for the night at the usual hour and under the usual auspices. At eleven  o'clock the lights were all extinguished, and the whole household asleep, with  the possible exception of Mr. Hasbrouck himself, who, being a man of large  business responsibilities, was frequently troubled with insomnia.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  Mrs. Hasbrouck woke with a start. Had she dreamed the words that were ringing  in her ears, or had they been actually uttered in her hearing? They were short,  sharp words, full of terror and menace, and she had nearly satisfied herself  that she had imagined them, when there came, from somewhere near the door, a  sound she neither understood nor could interpret, but which filled her with  inexplicable terror, and made her afraid to breathe, or even to stretch forth her  hand towards her husband, whom she supposed to be sleeping at her side. At  length another strange sound, which she was sure was not due to her  imagination, drove her to make an attempt to rouse him, when she was horrified  to find that she was alone in bed, and her husband nowhere within reach.</p>
  <p>Filled  now with something more than nervous apprehension, she flung herself to the  floor, and tried to penetrate with frenzied glances, the surrounding darkness.  But the blinds and shutters both having been carefully closed by Mr. Hasbrouck  before retiring, she found this impossible, and she was about to sink in terror  to the floor, when she heard a low gasp on the other side of the room followed  by a suppressed cry.</p>
  <p>"God!  what have I done!"</p>
  <p>The  voice was a strange one, but before the fear aroused by this fact could  culminate in a shriek of dismay, she caught the sound of retreating footsteps,  and, eagerly listening, she heard them descend the stairs and depart by the  front door.</p>
  <p>Had  she known what had occurred&mdash;had there been no doubt in her mind as to what lay  in the darkness on the other side of the room&mdash;it is likely that, at the noise  caused by the closing front door, she would have made at once for the balcony  that opened out from the window before which she was standing, and taken one  look at the flying figure below. But her uncertainty as to what lay hidden from  her by the darkness chained her feet to the floor, and there is no knowing when  she would have moved, if a carriage had not at that moment passed down Astor  Place, bringing with it a sense of companionship which broke the spell holding  her, and gave her strength to light the gas which was in ready reach of her  hand.</p>
  <p>As  the sudden blaze illuminated the room, revealing in a burst the old familiar  walls and well-known pieces of furniture, she felt for a moment as if released  from some heavy nightmare and restored to the common experiences of life. But  in another instant her former dread returned, and she found herself quaking at  the prospect of passing around the foot of the bed into that part of the room  which was as yet hidden from her eyes.</p>
  <p>But  the desperation which comes with great crises finally drove her from her  retreat; and, creeping slowly forward, she cast one glance at the floor before  her, when she found her worst fears realized by the sight of the dead body of  her husband lying prone before the open doorway, with a bullet-hole in his  forehead.</p>
  <p>Her  first impulse was to shriek, but, by a powerful exercise of will, she checked  herself, and ringing frantically for the servants who slept on the top floor of  the house, flew to the nearest window and endeavoured to open it. But the  shutters had been bolted so securely by Mr. Hasbrouck, in his endeavour to shut  out all light and sound, that by the time she had succeeded in unfastening  them, all trace of the flying murderer had vanished from the street.</p>
  <p>Sick  with grief and terror, she stepped back into the room just as the three  frightened servants descended the stairs. As they appeared in the open doorway,  she pointed at her husband's inanimate form, and then, as if suddenly realizing  in its full force the calamity which had befallen her, she threw up her arms,  and sank forward to the floor in a dead faint.</p>
  <p>The  two women rushed to her assistance, but the old butler, bounding over the bed,  sprang to the window, and shrieked his alarm to the street.</p>
  <p>In  the interim that followed, Mrs. Hasbrouck was revived, and the master's body  laid decently on the bed; but no pursuit was made, nor any inquiries started  likely to assist me in establishing the identity of the assailant.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  everyone both in the house and out, seemed dazed by the unexpected catastrophe,  and as no one had any suspicions to offer as to the probable murderer, I had a  difficult task before me.</p>
  <p>I  began in the usual way, by inspecting the scene of the murder. I found nothing  in the room, or in the condition of the body itself, which added an iota to the  knowledge already obtained. That Mr. Hasbrouck had been in bed; that he had  risen upon hearing a noise; and that he had been shot before reaching the door,  were self-evident facts. But there was nothing to guide me further. The very  simplicity of the circumstances caused a dearth of clues, which made the  difficulty of procedure as great as any I had ever encountered.</p>
  <p>My  search through the hall and down the stairs elicited nothing; and an  investigation of the bolts and bars by which the house was secured, assured me  that the assassin had either entered by the front door, or had already been  secreted in the house when it was locked up for the night.</p>
  <p>"I  shall have to trouble Mrs. Hasbrouck for a short interview," I hereupon  announced to the trembling old servant, who had followed me like a dog about  the house.</p>
  <p>He  made no demur, and in a few minutes I was ushered into the presence of the  newly made widow, who sat quite alone, in a large chamber in the rear. As I  crossed the threshold she looked up, and I encountered a good, plain face,  without the shadow of guile in it.</p>
  <p>"Madam,"  said I, "I have not come to disturb you. I will ask two or three questions  only, and then leave you to your grief. I am told that some words came from the  assassin before he delivered his fatal shot. Did you hear these distinctly  enough to tell me what they were?"</p>
  <p>"I  was sound asleep," said she, "and dreamt, as I thought, that a fierce, strange  voice cried somewhere to some one: 'Ah! you did not expect me!' But I dare not  say that these words were really uttered to my husband, for he was not the man  to call forth hate, and only a man in the extremity of passion could address  such an exclamation in such a tone as rings in my memory in connection with the  fatal shot which woke me."</p>
  <p>"But  that shot was not the work of a friend," I argued. "If, as these words seem to  prove, the assassin had some other motive than plunder in his assault, then  your husband had an enemy, though you never suspected it."</p>
  <p>"Impossible!"  was her steady reply, uttered in the most convincing tone. "The man who shot  him was a common burglar, and frightened at having been betrayed into murder,  fled without looking for booty. I am sure I heard him cry out in terror and  remorse: 'God! what have I done!'"</p>
  <p>"Was  that before you left the side of the bed?"</p>
  <p>"Yes;  I did not move from my place till I heard the front door close. I was paralysed  by fear and dread."</p>
  <p>"Are  you in the habit of trusting to the security of a latch-lock only in the  fastening of your front door at night? I am told that the big key was not in  the lock, and that the bolt at the bottom of the door was not drawn."</p>
  <p>"The  bolt at the bottom of the door is never drawn. Mr. Hasbrouck was so good a man  that he never mistrusted any one. That is why the big lock was not fastened.  The key, not working well, he took it some days ago to the locksmith, and when  the latter failed to return it, he laughed, and said he thought no one would  ever think of meddling with his front door."</p>
  <p>"Is  there more than one night-key to your house?" I now asked.</p>
  <p>She  shook her head.</p>
  <p>"And  when did Mr. Hasbrouck last use his?"</p>
  <p>"To-night,  when he came home from prayer meeting," she answered, and burst into tears.</p>
  <p>Her  grief was so real and her loss so recent that I hesitated to afflict her by  further questions. So returning to the scene of the tragedy, I stepped out upon  the balcony which ran in front. Soft voices instantly struck my ears. The  neighbours on either side were grouped in front of their own windows, and were  exchanging the remarks natural under the circumstances. I paused, as in duty  bound, and listened. But I heard nothing worth recording, and would have  instantly reentered the house, if I had not been impressed by the appearance of  a very graceful woman who stood at my right. She was clinging to her husband,  who was gazing at one of the pillars before him in a strange fixed way which  astonished me till he attempted to move, and then I saw that he was blind. I  remembered that there lived in this row a blind doctor, equally celebrated for  his skill and for his uncommon personal attractions, and greatly interested not  only by his affliction, but in the sympathy evinced by his young and  affectionate wife, I stood still, till I heard her say in the soft and  appealing tones of love:</p>
  <p>"Come  in, Constant; you have heavy duties for to-morrow, and you should get a few  hours' rest if possible."</p>
  <p>He  came from the shadow of the pillar, and for one minute I saw his face with the  lamplight shining full upon it. It was as regular of feature as a sculptured  Adonis, and it was as white.</p>
  <p>"Sleep!"  he repeated, in the measured tones of deep but suppressed feeling. "Sleep! with  murder on the other side of the wall!" And he stretched out his arms in a dazed  way that insensibly accentuated the horror I myself felt of the crime which had  so lately taken place in the room behind me.</p>
  <p>She,  noting the movement, took one of the groping hands in her own and drew him  gently towards her.</p>
  <p>"This  way," she urged; and, guiding him into the house, she closed the window and  drew down the shades.</p>
  <p>I  have no excuse to offer for my curiosity, but the interest excited in me by  this totally irrelevant episode was so great that I did not leave the  neighbourhood till I had learned something of this remarkable couple.</p>
  <p>The  story told me was very simple. Dr. Zabriskie had not been born blind, but had  become so after a grievous illness which had stricken him down soon after he  received his diploma. Instead of succumbing to an affliction which would have  daunted most men, he expressed his intention of practising his profession, and  soon became so successful in it that he found no difficulty in establishing  himself in one of the best paying quarters of the city. Indeed, his intuition  seemed to have developed in a remarkable degree after the loss of his sight,  and he seldom, if ever, made a mistake in diagnosis. Considering this fact, and  the personal attractions which gave him distinction, it was no wonder that he  soon became a popular physician whose presence was a benefaction and whose word  law.</p>
  <p>He  had been engaged to be married at the time of his illness, and when he learned  what was likely to be its result, had offered to release the young lady from  all obligation to him. But she would not be released, and they were married.  This had taken place some five years previous to Mr. Hasbrouck's death, three  of which had been spent by them in Lafayette Place.</p>
  <p>So  much for the beautiful woman next door.</p>
  <p>There  being absolutely no clue to the assailant of Mr. Hasbrouck, I naturally looked  forward to the inquest for some evidence upon which to work. But there seemed  to be no underlying facts to this tragedy. The most careful study into the  habits and conduct of the deceased brought nothing to light save his general  beneficence and rectitude, nor was there in his history or in that of his wife,  any secret or hidden obligation calculated to provoke any such act of revenge  as murder. Mrs. Hasbrouck's surmise that the intruder was simply a burglar, and  that she had rather imagined than heard the words which pointed to the shooting  as a deed of vengeance, soon gained general credence.</p>
  <p>But  though the police worked long and arduously in this new direction their efforts  were without fruit and the case bids fair to remain an unsolvable mystery.</p>
  <p>That  was all. As Violet dropped the last page from her hand, she recalled a certain  phrase in her employer's letter. "If at the end you come upon a perfectly blank  wall&mdash;" Well, she had come upon this wall. Did he expect her to make an opening  in it? Or had he already done so himself, and was merely testing her much  vaunted discernment.</p>
  <p>Piqued  by the thought, she carefully reread the manuscript, and when she had again  reached its uncompromising end, she gave herself up to a few minutes of  concentrated thought, then, taking a sheet of paper from the rack before her,  she wrote upon it a single sentence, and folding the sheet, put it in an envelope  which she left unaddressed. This done, she went to bed and slept like the child  she really was.</p>
  <p>At  an early hour the next morning she entered her employer's office. Acknowledging  with a nod his somewhat ceremonious bow, she handed him the envelope in which  she had enclosed that one mysterious sentence.</p>
  <p>He  took it with a smile, opened it offhand, glanced at what she had written, and  flushed a vivid red.</p>
  <p>"You  are a&mdash;brick," he was going to say, but changed the last word to one more in  keeping with her character and appearance. "Look here. I expected this from you  and so prepared myself." Taking out a similar piece of paper from his own  pocket-book, he laid it down beside hers on the desk before him. It also held a  single sentence and, barring a slight difference of expression, the one was the  counterpart of the other. "The one loose stone," he murmured.</p>
  <p>"Seen  and noted by both."</p>
  <p>"Why  not?" he asked. Then as she glanced expectantly his way, he earnestly added:  "Together we may be able to do something. The reward offered by Mrs. Hasbrouck  for the detection of the murderer was a very large one. She is a woman of  means. I have never heard of its being withdrawn."</p>
  <p>"Then  it never has been," was Violet's emphatic conclusion, her dimples enforcing the  statement as only such dimples can. "But&mdash;what do you want of me in an affair of  this kind? Something more than to help you locate the one possible clue to  further enlightenment. You would not have mentioned the big reward just for  that."</p>
  <p>"Perhaps  not. There is a sequel to the story I sent you. I have written it out, with my  own hand. Take it home and read it at your leisure. When you see into what an  unhappy maze my own inquiries have led me, possibly you will be glad to assist  me in clearing up a situation which is inflicting great suffering on one whom  you will be the first to pity. If so, a line mentioning the fact will be much  appreciated by me." And disregarding her startled look and the impetuous  shaking of her head, he bowed her out with something more than his accustomed  suavity but also with a seriousness which affected her in spite of herself and  effectually held back the protest it was in her heart to make. She was glad of  this when she read his story; but later on&mdash;</p>
  <p>However,  it is not for me to intrude Violet, or Violet's feelings into an affair which  she is so anxious to forget. I shall therefore from this moment on, leave her  as completely out of this tale of crime and retribution as is possible and keep  a full record of her work. When she is necessary to the story, you will see her  again. Meanwhile, read with her, this relation of her employer's unhappy  attempt to pursue an investigation so openly dropped by the police. You will  perceive, from its general style and the accentuation put upon the human side  of this sombre story, a likeness to the former manuscript which may prove to  you, as it certainly did to Violet, to whose consideration she was indebted for  the readableness of the policeman's report, which in all probability had been a  simple statement of facts.</p>
  <p>But  there, I am speaking of Violet again. To prevent a further mischance of this  nature, I will introduce at once the above mentioned account.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>II</b></p>
  <p>No  man in all New York was ever more interested than myself in the Hasbrouck  affair, when it was the one and only topic of interest at a period when news  was unusually scarce. But, together with many such inexplicable mysteries, it  had passed almost completely from my mind, when it was forcibly brought back,  one day, by a walk I took through Lafayette Place.</p>
  <p>At  sight of the long row of uniform buildings, with their pillared fronts and  connecting balconies every detail of the crime which had filled the papers at  the time with innumerable conjectures returned to me with extraordinary  clearness, and, before I knew it, I found myself standing stockstill in the  middle of the block with my eye raised to the Hasbrouck house and my ears&mdash;or  rather my inner consciousness, for no one spoke I am sure&mdash;ringing with a  question which, whether the echo of some old thought or the expression of a new  one, so affected me by the promise it held of some hitherto unsuspected clue,  that I hesitated whether to push this new inquiry then or there by an attempted  interview with Mrs. Hasbrouck, or to wait till I had given it the thought which  such a stirring of dead bones rightfully demanded.</p>
  <p>You  know what that question was. I shall have communicated it to you, if you have  not already guessed it, before perusing these lines:</p>
  <p>"Who  uttered the scream which gave the first alarm of Mr. Hasbrouck's violent  death?"</p>
  <p>I  was in a state of such excitement as I walked away&mdash;for I listened to my better  judgment as to the inadvisability of my disturbing Mrs. Hasbrouck with these  new inquiries&mdash;that the perspiration stood out on my forehead. The testimony she  had given at the inquest recurred to me, and I remembered as distinctly as if  she were then speaking, that she had expressly stated that she did not scream  when confronted by the sight of her husband's dead body. But someone had  screamed and that very loudly. Who was it, then? One of the maids, startled by  the sudden summons from below, or someone else&mdash;some involuntary witness of the  crime, whose testimony had been suppressed at the inquest, by fear or  influence?</p>
  <p>The  possibility of having come upon a clue even at this late day so fired my  ambition that I took the first opportunity of revisiting Lafayette Place.  Choosing such persons as I thought most open to my questions, I learned that  there were many who could testify to having heard a woman's shrill scream on  that memorable night, just prior to the alarm given by old Cyrus, but no one  who could tell from whose lips it had come. One fact, however, was immediately  settled. It had not been the result of the servant-women's fears. Both of the  girls were positive that they had uttered no sound, nor had they themselves  heard any till Cyrus rushed to the window with his wild cries. As the scream,  by whomever given, was uttered before they descended the stairs, I was  convinced by these assurances that it had issued from one of the front windows,  and not from the rear of the house, where their own rooms lay. Could it be that  it had sprung from the adjoining dwelling, and that&mdash;</p>
  <p>I  remembered who had lived there and was for ringing the bell at once. But,  missing the doctor's sign, I made inquiries and found that he had moved from  the block. However, a doctor is soon found, and in less than fifteen, minutes I  was at the door of his new home, where I asked, not for him, but for Mrs.  Zabriskie.</p>
  <p>It  required some courage to do this, for I had taken particular notice of the  doctor's wife at the inquest, and her beauty, at that time, had worn such an  aspect of mingled sweetness and dignity that I hesitated to encounter it under  any circumstances likely to disturb its pure serenity. But a clue once grasped  cannot be lightly set aside by a true detective, and it would have taken more  than a woman's frowns to stop me at this point.</p>
  <p>However,  it was not with frowns she received me, but with a display of emotion for which  I was even less prepared. I had sent up my card and I saw it trembling in her  hand as she entered the room. As she neared me, she glanced at it, and with a  show of gentle indifference which did not in the least disguise her extreme  anxiety, she courteously remarked:</p>
  <p>"Your  name is an unfamiliar one to me. But you told my maid that your business was  one of extreme importance, and so I have consented to see you. What can an  agent from a private detective office have to say to me?"</p>
  <p>Startled  by this evidence of the existence of some hidden skeleton in her own closet, I  made an immediate attempt to reassure her.</p>
  <p>"Nothing  which concerns you personally," said I. "I simply wish to ask you a question in  regard to a small matter connected with Mr. Hasbrouck's violent death in Lafayette  Place, a couple of years ago. You were living in the adjoining house at the  time I believe, and it has occurred to me that you might on that account be  able to settle a point which has never been fully cleared up."</p>
  <p>Instead  of showing the relief I expected, her pallor increased and her fine eyes, which  had been fixed curiously upon me, sank in confusion to the floor.</p>
  <p>"Great  heaven!" thought I. "She looks as if at one more word from me, she would fall  at my feet in a faint. What is this I have stumbled upon!"</p>
  <p>"I  do not see how you can have any question to ask me on that subject," she began  with an effort at composure which for some reason disturbed me more than her  previous open display of fear. "Yet if you have," she continued, with a rapid  change of manner that touched my heart in spite of myself, "I shall, of course,  do my best to answer you."</p>
  <p>There  are women whose sweetest tones and most charming smiles only serve to awaken  distrust in men of my calling; but Mrs. Zabriskie was not of this number. Her face  was beautiful, but it was also candid in its expression, and beneath the  agitation which palpably disturbed her, I was sure there lurked nothing either  wicked or false. Yet I held fast by the clue which I had grasped as it were in  the dark, and without knowing whither I was tending, much less whither I was  leading her, I proceeded to say:</p>
  <p>"The  question which I presume to put to you as the next door neighbour of Mr.  Hasbrouck is this: Who was the woman who on the night of that gentleman's  assassination screamed out so loudly that the whole neighbourhood heard her?"</p>
  <p>The  gasp she gave answered my question in a way she little realized, and struck as  I was by the impalpable links that had led me to the threshold of this hitherto  unsolvable mystery, I was about to press my advantage and ask another question,  when she quickly started forward and laid her hand on my lips.</p>
  <p>Astonished,  I looked at her inquiringly, but her head was turned aside, and her eyes, fixed  upon the door, showed the greatest anxiety. Instantly I realized what she  feared. Her husband was entering the house, and she dreaded lest his ears  should catch a word of our conversation.</p>
  <p>Not  knowing what was in her mind, and unable to realize the importance of the  moment to her, I yet listened to the advance of her blind husband with an  almost painful interest. Would he enter the room where we were, or would he  pass immediately to his office in the rear? She seemed to wonder too, and  almost held her breath as he neared the door, paused, and stood in the open  doorway, with his ear turned towards us.</p>
  <p>As  for myself, I remained perfectly still, gazing at his face in mingled surprise  and apprehension. For besides its beauty, which was of a marked order, as I  have already observed, it had a touching expression which irresistibly aroused  both pity and interest in the spectator. This may have been the result of his  affliction, or it may have sprung from some deeper cause; but, whatever its  source, this look in his face produced a strong impression upon me and interested  me at once in his personality. Would he enter; or would he pass on? Her look of  silent appeal showed me in which direction her wishes lay, but while I answered  her glance by complete silence, I was conscious in some indistinct way that the  business I had undertaken would be better furthered by his entrance.</p>
  <p>The  blind have often been said to possess a sixth sense in place of the one they  have lost. Though I am sure we made no noise, I soon perceived that he was  aware of our presence. Stepping hastily forward he said, in the high and  vibrating tone of restrained passion:</p>
  <p>"Zulma,  are you there?"</p>
  <p>For  a moment I thought she did not mean to answer, but knowing doubtless from  experience the impossibility of deceiving him, she answered with a cheerful  assent, dropping her hand as she did so from before my lips.</p>
  <p>He  heard the slight rustle which accompanied the movement, and a look I found it  hard to comprehend flashed over his features, altering his expression so  completely that he seemed another man.</p>
  <p>"You  have someone with you," he declared, advancing another step, but with none of  the uncertainty which usually accompanies the movements of the blind. "Some  dear friend," he went on, with an almost sarcastic emphasis and a forced smile  that had little of gaiety in it.</p>
  <p>The  agitated and distressed blush which answered him could have but one  interpretation. He suspected that her hand had been clasped in mine, and she  perceived his thought and knew that I perceived it also.</p>
  <p>Drawing  herself up, she moved towards him, saying in a sweet womanly tone:</p>
  <p>"It  is no friend, Constant, not even an acquaintance. The person whom I now present  to you is a representative from some detective agency. He is here upon a  trivial errand which will soon be finished, when I will join you in the  office."</p>
  <p>I  knew she was but taking a choice between two evils, that she would have saved  her husband the knowledge of my calling as well as of my presence in the house,  if her self-respect would have allowed it; but neither she nor I anticipated  the effect which this introduction of myself in my business capacity would  produce upon him.</p>
  <p>"A  detective," he repeated, staring with his sightless eyes, as if, in his  eagerness to see, he half hoped his lost sense would return. "He can have no  trivial errand here; he has been sent by God Himself to&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Let  me speak for you," hastily interposed his wife, springing to his side and  clasping his arm with a fervour that was equally expressive of appeal and  command. Then turning to me, she explained: "Since Mr. Hasbrouck's  unaccountable death, my husband has been labouring under an hallucination which  I have only to mention, for you to recognize its perfect absurdity. He  thinks&mdash;oh! do not look like that, Constant; you know it is an hallucination  which must vanish the moment we drag it into broad daylight&mdash;that he&mdash;he, the  best man in all the world, was himself the assailant of Mr. Hasbrouck."</p>
  <p>"Good  God!"</p>
  <p>"I  say nothing of the impossibility of this being so," she went on in a fever of  expostulation. "He is blind, and could not have delivered such a shot even if  he had desired to; besides, he had no weapon. But the inconsistency of the  thing speaks for itself, and should assure him that his mind is unbalanced and  that he is merely suffering from a shock that was greater than we realized. He  is a physician and has had many such instances in his own practice. Why, he was  very much attached to Mr. Hasbrouck! They were the best of friends, and though  he insists that he killed him, he cannot give any reason for the deed."</p>
  <p>At  these words the doctor's face grew stern, and he spoke like an automaton  repeating some fearful lesson:</p>
  <p>"I  killed him. I went to his room and deliberately shot him. I had nothing against  him, and my remorse is extreme. Arrest me and let me pay the penalty of my crime.  It is the only way in which I can obtain peace."</p>
  <p>Shocked  beyond all power of self-control by this repetition of what she evidently  considered the unhappy ravings of a madman, she let go his arm and turned upon  me in frenzy.</p>
  <p>"Convince  him!" she cried. "Convince him by your questions that he never could have done  this fearful thing."</p>
  <p>I  was labouring under great excitement myself, for as a private agent with no  official authority such as he evidently attributed to me in the blindness of  his passion, I felt the incongruity of my position in the face of a matter of  such tragic consequence. Besides, I agreed with her that he was in a  distempered state of mind, and I hardly knew how to deal with one so fixed in  his hallucination and with so much intelligence to support it. But the  emergency was great, for he was holding out his wrists in the evident  expectation of my taking him into instant custody; and the sight was killing  his wife, who had sunk on the floor between us, in terror and anguish.</p>
  <p>"You  say you killed Mr. Hasbrouck," I began. "Where did you get your pistol, and  what did you do with it after you left his house?"</p>
  <p>"My  husband had no pistol; never had any pistol," put in Mrs. Zabriskie, with  vehement assertion. "If I had seen him with such a weapon&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  threw it away. When I left the house, I cast it as far from me as possible, for  I was frightened at what I had done, horribly frightened."</p>
  <p>"No  pistol was ever found," I answered with a smile, forgetting for the moment that  he could not see. "If such an instrument had been found in the street after a  murder of such consequence, it certainly would have been brought to the  police."</p>
  <p>"You  forget that a good pistol is valuable property," he went on stolidly. "Someone  came along before the general alarm was given; and seeing such a treasure lying  on the sidewalk, picked it up and carried it off. Not being an honest man, he  preferred to keep it to drawing the attention of the police upon himself."</p>
  <p>"Hum,  perhaps," said I; "but where did you get it. Surely you can tell where you  procured such a weapon, if, as your wife intimates, you did not own one."</p>
  <p>"I  bought it that selfsame night of a friend; a friend whom I will not name, since  he resides no longer in this country. I&mdash;" He paused; intense passion was in his  face; he turned towards his wife, and a low cry escaped him, which made her  look up in fear.</p>
  <p>"I  do not wish to go into any particulars," said he. "God forsook me and I  committed a horrible crime. When I am punished, perhaps peace will return to me  and happiness to her. I would not wish her to suffer too long or too bitterly  for my sin."</p>
  <p>"Constant!"  What love was in the cry! It seemed to move him and turn his thoughts for a  moment into a different channel.</p>
  <p>"Poor  child!" he murmured, stretching out his hands by an irresistible impulse  towards her. But the change was but momentary, and he was soon again the stern  and determined self-accuser. "Are you going to take me before a magistrate?" he  asked. "If so, I have a few duties to perform which you are welcome to witness."</p>
  <p>This  was too much; I felt that the time had come for me to disabuse his mind of the  impression he had unwittingly formed of me. I therefore said as considerately  as I could:</p>
  <p>"You  mistake my position, Dr. Zabriskie. Though a detective of some experience, I  have no connection with the police and no right to intrude myself in a matter  of such tragic importance. If, however, you are as anxious as you say to  subject yourself to police examination, I will mention the same to the proper  authorities, and leave them to take such action as they think best."</p>
  <p>"That  will be still more satisfactory to me," said he; "for though I have many times  contemplated giving myself up, I have still much to do before I can leave my  home and practice without injury to others. Good-day; when you want me you will  find me here."</p>
  <p>He  was gone, and the poor young wife was left crouching on the floor alone.  Pitying her shame and terror, I ventured to remark that it was not an uncommon  thing for a man to confess to a crime he had never committed, and assured her  that the matter would be inquired into very carefully before any attempt was  made upon his liberty.</p>
  <p>She  thanked me, and slowly rising, tried to regain her equanimity; but the manner  as well as the matter of her husband's self-condemnation was too overwhelming  in its nature for her to recover readily from her emotions.</p>
  <p>"I  have long dreaded this," she acknowledged. "For months I have foreseen that he  would make some rash communication or insane avowal. If I had dared, I would  have consulted some physician about this hallucination of his; but he was so  sane on other points that I hesitated to give my dreadful secret to the world.  I kept hoping that time and his daily pursuits would have their effect and  restore him to himself. But his illusion grows, and now I fear that nothing  will ever convince him that he did not commit the deed of which he accuses  himself. If he were not blind I would have more hope, but the blind have so  much time for brooding."</p>
  <p>"I  think he had better be indulged in his fancies for the present," I ventured.  "If he is labouring under an illusion it might be dangerous to cross him."</p>
  <p>"If?"  she echoed in an indescribable tone of amazement and dread. "Can you for a  moment harbour the idea that he has spoken the truth?"</p>
  <p>"Madam,"  I returned, with something of the cynicism of my calling, "what caused you to  give such an unearthly scream just before this murder was made known to the  neighbourhood?"</p>
  <p>She  stared, paled, and finally began to tremble, not, as I now believe, at the  insinuation latent in my words, but at the doubts which my question aroused in  her own breast.</p>
  <p>"Did  I?" she asked; then with a burst of candour which seemed inseparable from her  nature, she continued: "Why do I try to mislead you or deceive myself? I did give  a shriek just before the alarm was raised next door; but it was not from any  knowledge I had of a crime having been committed, but because I unexpectedly  saw before me my husband whom I supposed to be on his way to Poughkeepsie. He  was looking very pale and strange, and for a moment I thought I stood face to  face with his ghost. But he soon explained his appearance by saying that he had  fallen from the train and had only been saved by a miracle from being  dismembered; and I was just bemoaning his mishap and trying to calm him and  myself, when that terrible shout was heard next door of 'Murder! murder!'  Coming so soon after the shock he had himself experienced, it quite unnerved  him, and I think we can date his mental disturbance from that moment. For he  began immediately to take a morbid interest in the affair next door, though it  was weeks, if not months, before he let a word fall of the nature of those you  have just heard. Indeed it was not till I repeated to him some of the  expressions he was continually letting fall in his sleep, that he commenced to  accuse himself of crime and talk of retribution."</p>
  <p>"You  say that your husband frightened you on that night by appearing suddenly at the  door when you thought him on his way to Poughkeepsie. Is Dr. Zabriskie in the  habit of thus going and coming alone at an hour so late as this must have  been?"</p>
  <p>"You  forget that to the blind, night is less full of perils than the day. Often and  often has my husband found his way to his patients' houses alone after  midnight; but on this especial evening he had Leonard with him. Leonard was his  chauffeur, and always accompanied him when he went any distance."</p>
  <p>"Well,  then," said I, "all we have to do is to summon Leonard and hear what he has to  say concerning this affair. He will surely know whether or not his master went  into the house next door."</p>
  <p>"Leonard  has left us," she said. "Dr. Zabriskie has another chauffeur now. Besides (I  have nothing to conceal from you), Leonard was not with him when he returned to  the house that evening or the doctor would not have been without his  portmanteau till the next day. Something&mdash;I have never known what&mdash;caused them to  separate, and that is why I have no answer to give the doctor when he accuses  himself of committing a deed that night so wholly out of keeping with every  other act of his life."</p>
  <p>"And  have you never asked Leonard why they separated and why he allowed his master  to come home alone after the shock he had received at the station?"</p>
  <p>"I  did not know there was any reason for my doing so till long after he had left  us."</p>
  <p>"And  when did he leave?"</p>
  <p>"That  I do not remember. A few weeks or possibly a few days after that dreadful  night."</p>
  <p>"And  where is he now?"</p>
  <p>"Ah,  that I have not the least means of knowing. But," she objected, in sudden  distrust, "what do you want of Leonard? If he did not follow Dr. Zabriskie to  his own door, he could tell us nothing that would convince my husband that he  is labouring under an illusion."</p>
  <p>"But  he might tell us something which would convince us that Dr. Zabriskie was not  himself after the accident; that he&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Hush!"  came from her lips in imperious tones. "I will not believe that he shot Mr.  Hasbrouck even if you prove him to have been insane at the time. How could he?  My husband is blind. It would take a man of very keen sight to force himself  into a house closed for the night, and kill a man in the dark at one shot."</p>
  <p>"On  the contrary, it is only a blind man who could do this," cried a voice from the  doorway. "Those who trust to eyesight must be able to catch a glimpse of the  mark they aim at, and this room, as I have been told, was without a glimmer of  light. But the blind trust to sound, and as Mr. Hasbrouck spoke&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Oh!"  burst from the horrified wife, "is there no one to stop him when he speaks like  that?"</p>
  <p align="center"><b>III</b></p>
  <p>As you  will see, this matter, so recklessly entered into, had proved to be of too  serious a nature for me to pursue it farther without the cognizance of the  police. Having a friend on the force in whose discretion I could rely, I took  him into my confidence and asked for his advice. He pooh-poohed the doctor's  statements, but said that he would bring the matter to the attention of the  superintendent and let me know the result. I agreed to this, and we parted with  the mutual understanding that mum was the word till some official decision had  been arrived at. I had not long to wait. At an early day he came in with the  information that there had been, as might be expected, a division of opinion  among his superiors as to the importance of Dr. Zabriskie's so-called confession,  but in one point they had been unanimous and that was the desirability of his  appearing before them at Headquarters for a personal examination. As, however,  in the mind of two out of three of them his condition was attributed entirely  to acute mania, it had been thought best to employ as their emissary one in  whom he had already confided and submitted his case to,&mdash;in other words, myself.  The time was set for the next afternoon at the close of his usual office hours.</p>
  <p>He  went without reluctance, his wife accompanying him. In the short time which  elapsed between their leaving home and entering Headquarters, I embraced the  opportunity of observing them, and I found the study equally exciting and  interesting. His face was calm but hopeless, and his eye, dark and  unfathomable, but neither frenzied nor uncertain. He spoke but once and  listened to nothing, though now and then his wife moved as if to attract his  attention, and once even stole her hand towards his, in the tender hope that he  would feel its approach and accept her sympathy. But he was deaf as well as  blind; and sat wrapped up in thoughts which she, I know, would have given  worlds to penetrate.</p>
  <p>Her  countenance was not without its mystery also. She showed in every lineament  passionate concern and misery, and a deep tenderness from which the element of  fear was not absent. But she, as well as he, betrayed that some  misunderstanding deeper than any I had previously suspected drew its intangible  veil between them and made the near proximity in which they sat at once a  heart-piercing delight and an unspeakable pain. What was the misunderstanding;  and what was the character of the fear that modified her every look of love in  his direction? Her perfect indifference to my presence proved that it was not  connected with the position in which he had placed himself towards the police  by his voluntary confession of crime, nor could I thus interpret the  expression, of frantic question which now and then contracted her features, as  she raised her eyes towards his sightless orbs, and strove to read in his firm  set lips the meaning of those assertions she could only ascribe to loss of  reason.</p>
  <p>The  stopping of the carriage seemed to awaken both from thoughts that separated  rather than united them. He turned his face in her direction, and she  stretching forth her hand, prepared to lead him from the carriage, without any  of that display of timidity which had previously been evident in her manner.</p>
  <p>As  his guide she seemed to fear nothing; as his lover, everything.</p>
  <p>"There  is another and a deeper tragedy underlying the outward and obvious one," was my  inward conclusion, as I followed them into the presence of the gentlemen  awaiting them.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Zabriskie's quiet appearance was in itself a shock to those who had anticipated  the feverish unrest of a madman; so was his speech, which was calm,  straightforward, and quietly determined.</p>
  <p>"I  shot Mr. Hasbrouck," was his steady affirmation, given without any show of  frenzy or desperation. "If you ask me why I did it, I cannot answer; if you ask  me how, I am ready to state all that I know concerning the matter."</p>
  <p>"But,  Dr. Zabriskie," interposed one of the inspectors, "the why is the most  important thing for us to consider just now. If you really desire to convince  us that you committed this dreadful crime of killing a totally inoffensive man,  you should give us some reason for an act so opposed to all your instincts and  general conduct."</p>
  <p>But  the doctor continued unmoved:</p>
  <p>"I  had no reason for murdering Mr. Hasbrouck. A hundred questions can elicit no  other reply; you had better keep to the how."</p>
  <p>A  deep-drawn breath from the wife answered the looks of the three gentlemen to  whom this suggestion was offered. "You see," that breath seemed to protest,  "that he is not in his right mind."</p>
  <p>I  began to waver in my own opinion, and yet the intuition which has served me in  cases seemingly as impenetrable as this bade me beware of following the general  judgment.</p>
  <p>"Ask  him to inform you how he got into the house," I whispered to Inspector D&mdash;, who  sat nearest me.</p>
  <p>Immediately  the inspector put the question which I had suggested:</p>
  <p>"By  what means did you enter Mr. Hasbrouck's house at so late an hour as this  murder occurred?"</p>
  <p>The  blind doctor's head fell forward on his breast, and he hesitated for the first  and only time.</p>
  <p>"You  will not believe me," said he; "but the door was ajar when I came to it. Such  things make crime easy; it is the only excuse I have to offer for this dreadful  deed."</p>
  <p>The  front door of a respectable citizen's house ajar at half-past eleven at night!  It was a statement that fixed in all minds the conviction of the speaker's  irresponsibility. Mrs. Zabriskie's brow cleared, and her beauty became for a  moment dazzling as she held out her hands in irrepressible relief towards those  who were interrogating her husband. I alone kept my impassibility. A possible  explanation of this crime had flashed like lightning across my mind; an  explanation from which I inwardly recoiled, even while I felt forced to  consider it.</p>
  <p>"Dr.  Zabriskie," remarked the inspector formerly mentioned as friendly to him, "such  old servants as those kept by Mr. Hasbrouck do not leave the front door ajar at  twelve o'clock at night."</p>
  <p>"Yet  ajar it was," repeated the blind doctor, with quiet emphasis; "and finding it  so, I went in. When I came out again, I closed it. Do you wish me to swear to  what I say? If so, I am ready."</p>
  <p>What  reply could they give? To see this splendid-looking man, hallowed by an  affliction so great that in itself it called forth the compassion of the most  indifferent, accusing himself of a cold-blooded crime, in tones which sounded  dispassionate because of the will forcing their utterance, was too painful in  itself for any one to indulge in unnecessary words. Compassion took the place  of curiosity, and each and all of us turned involuntary looks of pity upon the  young wife pressing so eagerly to his side.</p>
  <p>"For  a blind man," ventured one, "the assault was both deft and certain. Are you  accustomed to Mr. Hasbrouck's house, that you found your way with so little  difficulty to his bedroom?"</p>
  <p>"I  am accustomed&mdash;" he began.</p>
  <p>But  here his wife broke in with irrepressible passion:</p>
  <p>"He  is not accustomed to that house. He has never been beyond the first floor. Why,  why do you question him? Do you not see&mdash;"</p>
  <p>His  hand was on her lips.</p>
  <p>"Hush!"  he commanded. "You know my skill in moving about a house; how I sometimes  deceive those who do not know me into believing that I can see, by the  readiness with which I avoid obstacles and find my way even in strange and  untried scenes. Do not try to make them think I am not in my right mind, or you  will drive me into the very condition you attribute to me."</p>
  <p>His  face, rigid, cold, and set, looked like that of a mask. Hers, drawn with horror  and filled with question that was fast taking the form of doubt, bespoke an  awful tragedy from which more than one of us recoiled.</p>
  <p>"Can  you shoot a man dead without seeing him?" asked the Superintendent, with  painful effort.</p>
  <p>"Give  me a pistol and I will show you," was the quick reply.</p>
  <p>A  low cry came from the wife. In a drawer near to every one of us there lay a  pistol, but no one moved to take it out. There was a look in the doctor's eye  which made us fear to trust him with a pistol just then.</p>
  <p>"We  will accept your assurance that you possess a skill beyond that of most men,"  returned the Superintendent. And beckoning me forward, he whispered: "This is a  case for the doctors and not for the police. Remove him quietly, and notify Dr.  Southyard of what I say."</p>
  <p>But  Dr. Zabriskie, who seemed to have an almost supernatural acuteness of hearing,  gave a violent start at this, and spoke up for the first time with real passion  in his voice:</p>
  <p>"No,  no, I pray you. I can bear anything but that. Remember, gentlemen, that I am  blind; that I cannot see who is about me; that my life would be a torture if I  felt myself surrounded by spies watching to catch some evidence of madness in  me. Rather conviction at once, death, dishonour, and obloquy. These I have  incurred. These I have brought upon myself by crime, but not this worse  fate&mdash;oh! not this worse fate."</p>
  <p>His  passion was so intense and yet so confined within the bounds of decorum, that  we felt strangely impressed by it. Only the wife stood transfixed, with the  dread growing in her heart, till her white, waxen visage seemed even more terrible  to contemplate than his passion-distorted one.</p>
  <p>"It  is not strange that my wife thinks me demented," the doctor continued, as if  afraid of the silence that answered him. "But it is your business to  discriminate, and you should know a sane man when you see him."</p>
  <p>Inspector  D&mdash; no longer hesitated.</p>
  <p>"Very  well," said he, "give me the least proof that your assertions are true, and we  will lay your case before the prosecuting attorney."</p>
  <p>"Proof?  Is not a man's word&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"No  man's confession is worth much without some evidence to support it. In your  case there is none. You cannot even produce the pistol with which you assert  yourself to have committed the deed."</p>
  <p>"True,  true. I was frightened by what I had done, and the instinct of  self-preservation led me to rid myself of the weapon in any way I could. But  someone found this pistol; someone picked it up from the sidewalk of Lafayette  Place on that fatal night. Advertise for it. Offer a reward. I will give you  the money." Suddenly he appeared to realize how all this sounded. "Alas!" cried  he, "I know the story seems improbable; but it is not the probable things that  happen in this life, as, you should know, who every day dig deep into the heart  of human affairs."</p>
  <p>Were  these the ravings of insanity? I began to understand the wife's terror.</p>
  <p>"I  bought the pistol," he went on, "of&mdash;alas! I cannot tell you his name.  Everything is against me. I cannot adduce one proof; yet even she is beginning  to fear that my story is true. I know it by her silence, a silence that yawns  between us like a deep and unfathomable gulf."</p>
  <p>But  at these words her voice rang out with passionate vehemence.</p>
  <p>"No,  no, it is false! I will never believe that your hands have been plunged in  blood. You are my own pure-hearted Constant, cold, perhaps, and stern, but with  no guilt upon your conscience save in your own wild imagination."</p>
  <p>"Zulma,  you are no friend to me," he declared, pushing her gently aside. "Believe me  innocent, but say nothing to lead these others to doubt my word."</p>
  <p>And  she said no more, but her looks spoke volumes.</p>
  <p>The  result was that he was not detained, though he prayed for instant commitment.  He seemed to dread his own home, and the surveillance to which he instinctively  knew he would henceforth be subjected. To see him shrink from his wife's hand  as she strove to lead him from the room was sufficiently painful; but the  feeling thus aroused was nothing to that with which we observed the keen and  agonized expectancy of his look as he turned and listened for the steps of the  officer who followed him.</p>
  <p>"From  this time on I shall never know whether or not I am alone," was his final  observation as he left the building.</p>
  <p>Here  is where the matter rests and here, Miss Strange, is where you come in. The  police were for sending an expert alienist into the house; but agreeing with  me, and, in fact, with the doctor himself, that if he were not already out of  his mind, this would certainly make them so, they, at my earnest intercession,  have left the next move to me.</p>
  <p>That  move as you must by this time understand involves you. You have advantages for  making Mrs. Zabriskie's acquaintance of which I beg you to avail yourself. As  friend or patient, you must win your way into that home? You must sound to its  depths one or both of these two wretched hearts. Not so much now for any  possible reward which may follow the elucidation of this mystery which has come  so near being shelved, but for pity's sake and the possible settlement of a  question which is fast driving a lovely member of your sex distracted.</p>
  <p>May  I rely on you? If so&mdash;</p>
  <p>Various  instructions followed, over which Violet mused with a deprecatory shaking of  her head till the little clock struck two. Why should she, already in a state  of secret despondency, intrude herself into an affair at once so painful and so  hopeless?</p>
  <p align="center"><b>IV</b></p>
  <p>But  by morning her mood changed. The pathos of the situation had seized upon her in  her dreams, and before the day was over, she was to be seen, as a prospective  patient, in Dr. Zabriskie's office. She had a slight complaint as her excuse,  and she made the most of it. That is, at first, but as the personality of this  extraordinary man began to make its usual impression, she found herself  forgetting her own condition in the intensity of interest she felt in his.  Indeed, she had to pull herself together more than once lest he should suspect  the double nature of her errand, and she actually caught herself at times  rejoicing in his affliction since it left her with only her voice to think of,  in her hated but necessary task of deception.</p>
  <p>That  she succeeded in this effort, even with one of his nice ear, was evident from  the interested way in which he dilated upon her malady, and the minute  instructions he was careful to give her&mdash;the physician being always uppermost in  his strange dual nature, when he was in his office or at the bedside of the  sick;&mdash;and had she not been a deep reader of the human soul she would have left  his presence in simple wonder at his skill and entire absorption in an exacting  profession.</p>
  <p>But  as it was, she carried with her an image of subdued suffering, which drove her,  from that moment on, to ask herself what she could do to aid him in his fight  against his own illusion; for to associate such a man with a senseless and  cruel murder was preposterous.</p>
  <p>What  this wish, helped by no common determination, led her into, it was not in her  mind to conceive. She was making her one great mistake, but as yet she was in  happy ignorance of it, and pursued the course laid out for her without a doubt  of the ultimate result.</p>
  <p>Having  seen and made up her mind about the husband, she next sought to see and gauge  the wife. That she succeeded in doing this by means of one of her sly little  tricks is not to the point; but what followed in natural consequence is very  much so. A mutual interest sprang up between them which led very speedily to  actual friendship. Mrs. Zabriskie's hungry heart opened to the sympathetic  little being who clung to her in such evident admiration; while Violet, brought  face to face with a real woman, succumbed to feelings which made it no  imposition on her part to spend much of her leisure in Zulma Zabriskie's  company.</p>
  <p>The  result were the following naive reports which drifted into her employer's  office from day to day, as this intimacy deepened.</p>
  <p>The  doctor is settling into a deep melancholy, from which he tries to rise at  times, but with only indifferent success. Yesterday he rode around to all his  patients for the purpose of withdrawing his services on the plea of illness.  But he still keeps his office open, and today I had the opportunity of  witnessing his reception and treatment of the many sufferers who came to him  for aid. I think he was conscious of my presence, though an attempt had been  made to conceal it. For the listening look never left his face from the moment  he entered the room, and once he rose and passed quickly from wall to wall,  groping with out-stretched hands into every nook and corner, and barely  escaping contact with the curtain behind which I was hidden. But if he  suspected my presence, he showed no displeasure at it, wishing perhaps for a  witness to his skill in the treatment of disease.</p>
  <p>And  truly I never beheld a finer manifestation of practical insight in cases of a  more or less baffling nature. He is certainly a most wonderful physician, and I  feel bound to record that his mind is as clear for business as if no shadow had  fallen upon it.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Zabriskie loves his wife, but in a way torturing to himself and to her. If she  is gone from the house he is wretched, and yet when she returns he often  forbears to speak to her, or if he does speak it is with a constraint that  hurts her more than his silence. I was present when she came in today. Her  step, which had been eager on the stairway, flagged as she approached the room,  and he naturally noted the change and gave his own interpretation to it. His  face, which had been very pale, flushed suddenly, and a nervous trembling  seized him which he sought in vain to hide. But by the time her tall and  beautiful figure stood in the doorway, he was his usual self again in all but the  expression of his eyes, which stared straight before him in an agony of longing  only to be observed in those who have once seen.</p>
  <p>"Where  have you been, Zulma?" he asked, as contrary to his wont, he moved to meet her.</p>
  <p>"To  my mother's, to Arnold &amp; Constable's, and to the hospital, as you  requested," was her quick answer, made without faltering or embarrassment.</p>
  <p>He  stepped still nearer and took her hand, and as he did so my eye fell on his and  I noted that his finger lay over her pulse in seeming unconsciousness.</p>
  <p>"Nowhere  else?" he queried.</p>
  <p>She  smiled the saddest kind of smile and shook her head; then, remembering that he  could not see this movement, she cried in a wistful tone:</p>
  <p>"Nowhere  else, Constant; I was too anxious to get back."</p>
  <p>I  expected him to drop her hand at this, but he did not; and his finger still  rested on her pulse.</p>
  <p>"And  whom did you see while you were gone?" he continued.</p>
  <p>She  told him, naming over several names.</p>
  <p>"You  must have enjoyed yourself," was his cold comment, as he let go her hand and  turned away. But his manner showed relief, and I could not but sympathize with  the pitiable situation of a man who found himself forced into means like this  for probing the heart of his young wife.</p>
  <p>Yet  when I turned towards her, I realized that her position was but little happier  than his. Tears are no strangers to her eyes, but those which welled up at this  moment seemed to possess a bitterness that promised but little peace for her  future. Yet she quickly dried them and busied herself with ministrations for  his comfort.</p>
  <p>If  I am any judge of woman, Zulma Zabriskie is superior to most of her sex. That  her husband mistrusts her is evident, but whether this is the result of the  stand she has taken in his regard, or only a manifestation of dementia, I have  as yet been unable to determine. I dread to leave them alone together, and yet  when I presume to suggest that she should be on her guard in her interviews  with him, she smiles very placidly and tells me that nothing would give her  greater joy than to see him lift his hand against her, for that would argue  that he is not accountable for his deeds or assertions.</p>
  <p>Yet  it would be a grief to see her injured by this passionate and unhappy man.</p>
  <p>You  have said that you wanted all the details I could give; so I feel bound to say  that Dr. Zabriskie tries to be considerate of his wife, though he often fails  in the attempt. When she offers herself as his guide, or assists him with his  mail or performs any of the many acts of kindness by which she continually  manifests her sense of his affliction, he thanks her with courtesy and often  with kindness, yet I know she would willingly exchange all his set phrases for  one fond embrace or impulsive smile of affection. It would be too much to say  that he is not in the full possession of his faculties, and yet upon what other  hypothesis can we account for the inconsistencies of his conduct?</p>
  <p>I  have before me two visions of mental suffering. At noon I passed the office  door, and looking within, saw the figure of Dr. Zabriskie seated in his great  chair, lost in thought or deep in those memories which make an abyss in one's  consciousness. His hands, which were clenched, rested upon the arms of his  chair, and in one of them I detected a woman's glove, which I had no difficulty  in recognizing as one of the pair worn by his wife this morning. He held it as  a tiger might hold his prey or a miser his gold, but his set features and  sightless eyes betrayed that a conflict of emotions was being waged within him,  among which tenderness had but little share.</p>
  <p>Though  alive as he usually is to every sound, he was too absorbed at this moment to  notice my presence, though I had taken no pains to approach quietly. I  therefore stood for a full minute watching him, till an irresistible sense of  the shame at thus spying upon a blind man in his moments of secret anguish  compelled me to withdraw. But not before I saw his features relax in a storm of  passionate feeling, as he rained kisses after kisses on the senseless kid he  had so long held in his motionless grasp. Yet when an hour later he entered the  dining-room on his wife's arm, there was nothing in his manner to show that he  had in any way changed in his attitude towards her.</p>
  <p>The  other picture was more tragic still. I was seeking Mrs. Zabriskie in her own  room, when I caught a fleeting vision of her tall form, with her arms thrown up  over her head in a paroxysm of feeling which made her as oblivious to my  presence as her husband had been several hours before. Were the words that  escaped her lips "Thank God we have no children!" or was this exclamation  suggested to me by the passion and unrestrained impulse of her action?</p>
  <p>So  much up to date. Interesting enough, or so her employer seemed to think, as he  went hurriedly through the whole story, one special afternoon in his office,  tapping each sheet as he laid it aside with his sagacious forefinger, as though  he would say, "Enough! My theory still holds good; nothing contradictory here;  on the contrary complete and undisputable confirmation of the one and only explanation  of this astounding crime."</p>
  <p>What  was that theory; and in what way and through whose efforts had he been enabled  to form one? The following notes may enlighten us. Though written in his own  hand, and undoubtedly a memorandum of his own activities, he evidently thinks  it worth while to reperuse them in connection with those he had just laid  aside.</p>
  <p>We  can do no better than read them also.</p>
  <p>We  omit dates.</p>
  <p>Watched  the Zabriskie mansion for five hours this morning, from the second story window  of an adjoining hotel. Saw the doctor when he drove away on his round of  visits, and saw him when he returned. A coloured man accompanied him.</p>
  <p>Today  I followed Mrs. Zabriskie. She went first to a house in Washington Place where  I am told her mother lives. Here she stayed some time, after which she drove  down to Canal Street, where she did some shopping, and later stopped at the  hospital, into which I took the liberty of following her. She seemed to know  many there, and passed from cot to cot with a smile in which I alone discerned  the sadness of a broken heart. When she left, I left also, without having  learned anything beyond the fact that Mrs. Zabriskie is one who does her duty  in sorrow as in joy. A rare, and trustworthy woman I should say, and yet her  husband does not trust her. Why?</p>
  <p>I  have spent this day in accumulating details in regard to Dr. and Mrs.  Zabriskie's life previous to the death of Mr. Hasbrouck. I learned from sources  it would be unwise to quote just here, that Mrs. Zabriskie had not lacked  enemies to charge her with coquetry; that while she had never sacrificed her  dignity in public, more than one person had been heard to declare that Dr.  Zabriskie was fortunate in being blind, since the sight of his wife's beauty  would have but poorly compensated him for the pain he would have suffered in  seeing how that beauty was admired.</p>
  <p>That  all gossip is more or less tinged with exaggeration I have no doubt, yet when a  name is mentioned in connection with such stories, there is usually some truth  at the bottom of them. And a name is mentioned in this case, though I do not  think it worth my while to repeat it here; and loth as I am to recognize the  fact, it is a name that carries with it doubts that might easily account for  the husband's jealousy. True, I have found no one who dares hint that she still  continues to attract attention or to bestow smiles in any direction save where  they legally belong. For since a certain memorable night which we all know,  neither Dr. Zabriskie nor his wife have been seen save in their own domestic  circle, and it is not into such scenes that this serpent, to whom I have just  alluded, ever intrudes, nor is it in places of sorrow or suffering that his  smile shines, or his fascinations flourish.</p>
  <p>And  so one portion of my theory is proved to be sound. Dr. Zabriskie is jealous of  his wife; whether with good cause or bad I am not prepared to decide; since her  present attitude, clouded as it is by the tragedy in which she and her husband  are both involved, must differ very much from that which she held when her life  was unshadowed by doubt, and her admirers could be counted by the score.</p>
  <p>I  have just found out where Leonard is. As he is in service some miles up the  river, I shall have to be absent from my post for several hours, but I consider  the game well worth the candle.</p>
  <p>Light  at last. I have not only seen Leonard, but succeeded in making him talk. His  story is substantially this: That on the night so often mentioned, he packed  his master's portmanteau at eight o'clock and at ten called a taxi and rode  with the doctor to the Central station. He was told to buy tickets to  Poughkeepsie where his master had been called in consultation, and having done  this, hurried back to join Dr. Zabriskie on the platform. They had walked  together as far as the cars, and Dr. Zabriskie was just stepping on to the  train, when a man pushed himself hurriedly between them and whispered something  into his master's ear, which caused him to fall back and lose his footing. Dr.  Zabriskie's body slid half under the car, but he was withdrawn before any harm  was done, though the cars gave a lurch at that moment which must have  frightened him exceedingly, for his face was white when he rose to his feet,  and when Leonard offered to assist him again on the train, he refused to go and  said he would return home and not attempt to ride to Poughkeepsie that night.</p>
  <p>The  gentleman, whom Leonard now saw to be Mr. Stanton, an intimate friend of Dr.  Zabriskie, smiled very queerly at this, and taking the doctor's arm led him  back to his own auto. Leonard naturally followed them, but the doctor, hearing  his steps, turned and bade him, in a very peremptory tone, to take the cars  home, and then, as if on second thought, told him to go to Poughkeepsie in his  stead and explain to the people there that he was too shaken up by his misstep  to do his duty, and that he would be with them next morning. This seemed  strange to Leonard, but he had no reasons for disobeying his master's orders,  and so rode to Poughkeepsie. But the doctor did not follow him the next day; on  the contrary he telegraphed for him to return, and when he got back dismissed  him with a month's wages. This ended Leonard's connection with the Zabriskie  family.</p>
  <p>A  simple story bearing out what the wife has already told us; but it furnishes a  link which may prove invaluable. Mr. Stanton, whose first name is Theodore,  knows the real reason why Dr. Zabriskie returned home on the night of the  seventeenth of July, 19&mdash;. Mr. Stanton, consequently, is the man to see, and  this shall be my business tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Checkmate!  Theodore Stanton is not in this country. Though this points him out as the man  from whom Dr. Zabriskie bought the pistol, it does not facilitate my work,  which is becoming more and more difficult.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stanton's whereabouts are not even known to his most intimate friends. He  sailed from this country most unexpectedly on the eighteenth of July a year  ago, which was the day after the murder of Mr. Hasbrouck. It looks like a  flight, especially as he has failed to maintain open communication even with  his relatives. Was he the man who shot Mr. Hasbrouck? No; but he was the man  who put the pistol in Dr. Zabriskie's hand that night, and whether he did this  with purpose or not, was evidently so alarmed at the catastrophe which followed  that he took the first outgoing steamer to Europe. So far, all is clear, but  there are mysteries yet to be solved, which will require my utmost tact. What  if I should seek out the gentleman with whose name that of Mrs. Zabriskie has  been linked, and see if I can in any way connect him with Mr. Stanton or the  events of that night.</p>
  <p>Eureka!  I have discovered that Mr. Stanton cherished a mortal hatred for the gentleman  above mentioned. It was a covert feeling, but no less deadly on that account;  and while it never led him into any extravagances, it was of force sufficient  to account for many a secret misfortune occurring to that gentleman. Now if I  can prove that he is the Mephistopheles who whispered insinuations into the ear  of our blind Faust, I may strike a fact that will lead me out of this maze.</p>
  <p>But  how can I approach secrets so delicate without compromising the woman I feel  bound to respect if only for the devoted love she manifests for her unhappy  husband!</p>
  <p>I  shall have to appeal to Joe Smithers. This is something which I always hate to  do, but as long as he will take money, and as long as he is fertile in  resources for obtaining the truth from people I am myself unable to reach, I  must make use of his cupidity and his genius. He is an honourable fellow in one  way, and never retails as gossip what he acquires for our use. How will he  proceed in this case, and by what tactics will he gain the very delicate  information which we need? I own that I am curious to see.</p>
  <p>I  shall really have to put down at length the incidents of this night. I always  knew that Joe Smithers was invaluable not only to myself but to the police, but  I really did not know he possessed talents of so high an order. He wrote me  this morning that he had succeeded in getting Mr. T&mdash;'s promise to spend the evening  with him, and advised me that if I desired to be present as well, his own  servant would not be at home, and that an opener of bottles would be required.</p>
  <p>As  I was very anxious to see Mr. T&mdash; with my own eyes, I accepted this invitation  to play the spy, and went at the proper hour to Mr. Smithers's rooms. I found  them picturesque in the extreme. Piles of books stacked here and there to the  ceiling made nooks and corners which could be quite shut off by a couple of old  pictures set into movable frames capable of swinging out or in at the whim or  convenience of the owner.</p>
  <p>As  I had use for the dark shadows cast by these pictures, I pulled them both out,  and made such other arrangements as appeared likely to facilitate the purpose I  had in view; then I sat down and waited for the two gentlemen who were expected  to come in together.</p>
  <p>They  arrived almost immediately, whereupon I rose and played my part with all  necessary discretion. While ridding Mr. T&mdash; of his overcoat, I stole a look at  his face. It is not a handsome one, but it boasts of a gay, devil-may-care  expression which doubtless makes it dangerous to many women, while his manners  are especially attractive, and his voice the richest and most persuasive that I  ever heard. I contrasted him, almost against my will, with Dr. Zabriskie, and  decided that with most women the former's undoubted fascinations of speech and  bearing would outweigh the latter's great beauty and mental endowments; but I  doubted if they would with her.</p>
  <p>The  conversation which immediately began was brilliant but desultory, for Mr.  Smithers, with an airy lightness for which he is remarkable, introduced topic  after topic, perhaps for the purpose of showing off Mr. T-'s versatility, and  perhaps for the deeper and more sinister purpose of shaking the kaleidoscope of  talk so thoroughly, that the real topic which we were met to discuss should not  make an undue impression on the mind of his guest.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  one, two, three bottles passed, and I had the pleasure of seeing Joe Smithers's  eye grow calmer and that of Mr. T&mdash; more brilliant and more uncertain. As the  last bottle was being passed, Joe cast me a meaning glance, and the real  business of the evening began.</p>
  <p>I  shall not attempt to relate the half dozen failures which Joe made in  endeavouring to elicit the facts we were in search of, without arousing the  suspicion of his visitor. I am only going to relate the successful attempt.  They had been talking now for some hours, and I, who had long before been waved  aside from their immediate presence, was hiding my curiosity and growing  excitement behind one of the pictures, when I suddenly heard Joe say:</p>
  <p>"He  has the most remarkable memory I ever met. He can tell to a day when any  notable event occurred."</p>
  <p>"Pshaw!"  answered his companion, who, by the way, was known to pride himself upon his  own memory for dates, "I can state where I went and what I did on every day in  the year. That may not embrace what you call 'notable events,' but the memory  required is all the more remarkable, is it not?"</p>
  <p>"Pooh!"  was his friend's provoking reply, "you are bluffing, Ben; I will never believe  that."</p>
  <p>Mr.  T-, who had passed by this time into that stage of intoxication which makes  persistence in an assertion a duty as well as a pleasure, threw back his head,  and as the wreaths of smoke rose in airy spirals from his lips, reiterated his  statement, and offered to submit to any test of his vaunted powers which the  other might dictate.</p>
  <p>"You  keep a diary&mdash;" began Joe.</p>
  <p>"Which  at the present moment is at home," completed the other.</p>
  <p>"Will  you allow me to refer to it tomorrow, if I am suspicious of the accuracy of  your recollections?"</p>
  <p>"Undoubtedly,"  returned the other.</p>
  <p>"Very  well, then, I will wager you a cool fifty that you cannot tell where you were  between the hours of ten and eleven on a certain night which I will name."</p>
  <p>"Done!"  cried the other, bringing out his pocket-book and laying it on the table before  him.</p>
  <p>Joe  followed his example and then summoned me.</p>
  <p>"Write  a date down here," he commanded, pushing a piece of paper towards me, with a  look keen as the flash of a blade. "Any date, man," he added, as I appeared to  hesitate in the embarrassment I thought natural under the circumstances. "Put  down day, month, and year, only don't go too far back; not farther than two  years."</p>
  <p>Smiling  with the air of a flunkey admitted to the sports of his superiors, I wrote a  line and laid it before Mr. Smithers, who at once pushed it with a careless  gesture towards his companion. You can of course guess the date I made use of:  July 17, 19&mdash;. Mr. T&mdash;, who had evidently looked upon this matter as mere play,  flushed scarlet as he read these words, and for one instant looked as if he had  rather fly the house than answer Joe Smithers's nonchalant glance of inquiry.</p>
  <p>"I  have given my word and will keep it," he said at last, but with a look in my  direction that sent me reluctantly back to my retreat. "I don't suppose you  want names," he went on; "that is, if anything I have to tell is of a delicate  nature?"</p>
  <p>"Oh,  no," answered the other, "only facts and places."</p>
  <p>"I  don't think places are necessary either," he returned. "I will tell you what I  did and that must serve you. I did not promise to give number and street."</p>
  <p>"Well,  well," Joe exclaimed; "earn your fifty, that is all. Show that you remember  where you were on the night of"&mdash;and with an admirable show of indifference he  pretended to consult the paper between them&mdash;"the seventeenth of July, two years  ago, and I shall be satisfied."</p>
  <p>"I  was at the club for one thing," said Mr. T-; "then I went to see a lady friend,  where I stayed until eleven. She wore a blue muslin&mdash;What is that?"</p>
  <p>I  had betrayed myself by a quick movement which sent a glass tumbler crashing to  the floor. Zulma Zabriskie had worn a blue muslin on that same night. You will  find it noted in the report given me by the policeman who saw her on their  balcony.</p>
  <p>"That  noise?" It was Joe who was speaking. "You don't know Reuben as well as I do or  you wouldn't ask. It is his practice, I am sorry to say, to accentuate his  pleasure in draining my bottles by dropping a glass at every third one."</p>
  <p>Mr.  T&mdash; went on.</p>
  <p>"She  was a married woman and I thought she loved me; but&mdash;and this is the greatest  proof I can offer you that I am giving you a true account of that night&mdash;she had  not the slightest idea of the extent of my passion, and only consented to see  me at all because she thought, poor thing, that a word from her would set me  straight, and rid her of attentions she evidently failed to appreciate. A sorry  figure for a fellow like me to cut; but you caught me on the most detestable  date in my calendar and&mdash;"</p>
  <p>There  he ceased being interesting and I anxious. The secret of a crime for which  there seemed to be no reasonable explanation is no longer a mystery to me. I  have but to warn Miss Strange&mdash;</p>
  <p>He  had got thus far when a sound in the room behind him led him to look up. A lady  had entered; a lady heavily veiled and trembling with what appeared to be an  intense excitement.</p>
  <p>He  thought he knew the figure, but the person, whoever it was, stood so still and  remained so silent, he hesitated to address her; which seeing, she pushed up  her veil and all doubt vanished.</p>
  <p>It  was Violet herself. In disregard of her usual practice she had come alone to  the office. This meant urgency of some kind. Had she too sounded this mystery?  No, or her aspect would not have worn this look of triumph. What had happened  then? He made an instant endeavour to find out.</p>
  <p>"You  have news," he quietly remarked. "Good news, I should judge, by your very  cheery smile."</p>
  <p>"Yes;  I think I have found the way of bringing Dr. Zabriskie to himself."</p>
  <p>Astonished  beyond measure, so little did these words harmonize with the impressions and  conclusions at which he had just arrived, something very like doubt spoke in  his voice as he answered with the simple exclamation:</p>
  <p>"You  do!"</p>
  <p>"Yes.  He is obsessed by a fixed idea, and must be given an opportunity to test the  truth of that idea. The shock of finding it a false one may restore him to his  normal condition. He believes that he shot Mr. Hasbrouck with no other guidance  than his sense of hearing. Now if it can be proved that his hearing is an  insufficient guide for such an act (as of course it is) the shock of the  discovery may clear his brain of its cobwebs. Mrs. Zabriskie thinks so, and the  police&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"What's  that? The police?"</p>
  <p>"Yes,  Dr. Zabriskie would be taken before them again this morning. No entreaties on  the part of his wife would prevail; he insisted upon his guilt and asked her to  accompany him there; and the poor woman found herself forced to go. Of course  he encountered again the same division of opinion among the men he talked with.  Three out of the four judged him insane, which observing, he betrayed great  agitation and reiterated his former wish to be allowed an opportunity to prove  his sanity by showing his skill in shooting. This made an impression; and a  disposition was shown to grant his request then and there. But Mrs. Zabriskie  would not listen to this. She approved of the experiment but begged that it  might be deferred till another day and then take place in some spot remote from  the city. For some reason they heeded her, and she has just telephoned me that  this attempt of his is to take place tomorrow in the New Jersey woods. I am  sorry that this should have been put through without you; and when I tell you  that the idea originated with me&mdash;that from some word I purposely let fall one  day, they both conceived this plan of ending the uncertainty that was devouring  their lives, you will understand my excitement and the need I have of your  support. Tell me that I have done well. Do not show me such a face&mdash;you frighten  me&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  do not wish to frighten you. I merely wish to know just who are going on this  expedition."</p>
  <p>"Some  members of the police, Dr. Zabriskie, his wife, and&mdash;and myself. She begged&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"You  must not go."</p>
  <p>"Why?  The affair is to be kept secret. The doctor will shoot, fail&mdash;Oh!" she suddenly  broke in, alarmed by his expression, "you think he will not fail&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  think that you had better heed my advice and stay out of it. The affair is now  in the hands of the police, and your place is anywhere but where they are."</p>
  <p>"But  I go as her particular friend. They have given her the privilege of taking with  her one of her own sex and she has chosen me. I shall not fail her. Father is  away, and if the awful disappointment you suggest awaits her, there is all the  more reason why she should have some sympathetic support?"</p>
  <p>This  was so true, that the fresh protest he was about to utter died on his lips.  Instead, he simply remarked as he bowed her out:</p>
  <p>"I  foresee that we shall not work much longer together. You are nearing the end of  your endurance."</p>
  <p>He  never forgot the smile she threw back at him.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>V</b></p>
  <p>There  are some events which impress the human mind so deeply that their memory  mingles with all after-experiences. Though Violet had made it a rule to forget  as soon as possible the tragic episodes incident to the strange career upon  which she had so mysteriously embarked, there was destined to be one scene, if  not more, which she has never been able to dismiss at will.</p>
  <p>This  was the sight which met her eyes from the bow of the small boat in which Dr.  Zabriskie and his wife were rowed over to Jersey on the afternoon which saw the  end of this most sombre drama.</p>
  <p>Though  it was by no means late in the day, the sun was already sinking, and the bright  red glare which filled the west and shone full upon the faces of the half dozen  people before her added much to the tragic nature of the scene, though she was  far from comprehending its full significance.</p>
  <p>The  doctor sat with his wife in the stern and it was upon their faces Violet's  glance was fixed. The glare shone luridly on his sightless eyeballs, and as she  noticed his unwinking lids, she realized as never before what it was to be  blind in the midst of sunshine. His wife's eyes, on the contrary, were lowered,  but there was a look of hopeless misery in her colourless face which made her  appearance infinitely pathetic, and Violet felt confident that if he could only  have seen her, he would not have maintained the cold and unresponsive manner  which chilled the words on his poor wife's lips and made all advance on her  part impossible.</p>
  <p>On  the seat in front of them sat an inspector and from some quarter, possibly from  under the inspector's coat, there came the monotonous ticking of the small  clock, which was to serve as a target for the blind man's aim.</p>
  <p>This  ticking was all Violet heard, though the river was alive with traffic and large  and small boats were steaming by them on every side. And I am sure it was all  that Mrs. Zabriskie heard also, as with hand pressed to her heart, and eyes  fixed on the opposite shore, she waited for the event which was to determine  whether the man she loved was a criminal or only a being afflicted of God and  worthy of her unceasing care and devotion.</p>
  <p>As  the sun cast its last scarlet gleam over the water, the boat grounded, and  Violet was enabled to have one passing word with Mrs. Zabriskie. She hardly  knew what she said but the look she received in return was like that of a  frightened child.</p>
  <p>But  there was always to be seen in Mrs. Zabriskie's countenance this characteristic  blending of the severe and the childlike, and beyond an added pang of pity for  this beautiful but afflicted woman, Violet let the moment pass without giving  it the weight it perhaps demanded.</p>
  <p>"The  doctor and his wife had a long talk last night," was whispered in her ear as  she wound her way with the rest into the heart of the woods. With a start she  turned and perceived her employer following close behind her. He had come by  another boat.</p>
  <p>"But  it did not seem to heal whatever breach lies between them," he proceeded. Then,  in a quick, anxious tone, he whispered: "Whatever happens, do not lift your  veil. I thought I saw a reporter skulking in the rear."</p>
  <p>"I  will be careful," Violet assured him, and could say no more, as they had  already reached the ground which had been selected for this trial at arms, and  the various members of the party were being placed in their several positions.</p>
  <p>The  doctor, to whom light and darkness were alike, stood with his face towards the  western glow, and at his side were grouped the inspector and the two  physicians. On the arm of one of the latter hung Dr. Zabriskie's overcoat,  which he had taken off as soon as he reached the field.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Zabriskie stood at the other end of the opening near a tall stump, upon which  it had been decided that the clock should be placed when the moment came for  the doctor to show his skill. She had been accorded the privilege of setting  the clock on this stump, and Violet saw it shining in her hand as she paused for  a moment to glance back at the circle of gentlemen who were awaiting her  movements. The hands of the clock stood at five minutes to five, though Violet  scarcely noted it at the time, for Mrs. Zabriskie was passing her and had  stopped to say:</p>
  <p>"If  he is not himself, he cannot be trusted. Watch him carefully and see that he  does no mischief to himself or others. Ask one of the inspectors to stand at  his right hand, and stop him if he does not handle his pistol properly."</p>
  <p>Violet  promised, and she passed on, setting the clock upon the stump and immediately  drawing back to a suitable distance at the right, where she stood, wrapped in  her long dark cloak. Her face shone ghastly white, even in its environment of  snow-covered boughs, and noting this, Violet wished the minutes fewer between  the present moment and the hour of five, at which time he was to draw the  trigger.</p>
  <p>"Dr.  Zabriskie," quoth the inspector, "we have endeavoured to make this trial a  perfectly fair one. You are to have a shot at a small clock which has been  placed within a suitable distance, and which you are expected to hit, guided  only by the sound which it will make in striking the hour of five. Are you  satisfied with the arrangement?"</p>
  <p>"Perfectly.  Where is my wife?"</p>
  <p>"On  the other side of the field some ten paces from the stump upon which the clock  is fixed." He bowed, and his face showed satisfaction.</p>
  <p>"May  I expect the clock to strike soon?"</p>
  <p>"In  less than five minutes," was the answer.</p>
  <p>"Then  let me have the pistol; I wish to become acquainted with its size and weight."</p>
  <p>We  glanced at each other, then across at her.</p>
  <p>She  made a gesture; it was one of acquiescence.</p>
  <p>Immediately  the inspector placed the weapon in the blind man's hand. It was at once  apparent that he understood the instrument, and Violet's hopes which had been  strong up to this moment, sank at his air of confidence.</p>
  <p>"Thank  God I am blind this hour and cannot see her," fell from his lips, then, before  the echo of these words had died away, he raised his voice and observed calmly  enough, considering that he was about to prove himself a criminal in order to  save himself from being thought a madman:</p>
  <p>"Let  no one move. I must have my ears free for catching the first stroke of the  clock." And he raised the pistol before him.</p>
  <p>There  was a moment of torturing suspense and deep, unbroken silence. Violet's eyes  were on him so she did not watch the clock, but she was suddenly moved by some  irresistible impulse to note how Mrs. Zabriskie was bearing herself at this  critical moment, and casting a hurried glance in her direction she perceived  her tall figure swaying from side to side, as if under an intolerable strain of  feeling. Her eyes were on the clock, the hands of which seemed to creep with  snail-like pace along the dial, when unexpectedly, and a full minute before the  minute hand had reached the stroke of five, Violet caught a movement on her  part, saw the flash of something round and white show for an instant against  the darkness of her cloak, and was about to shriek warning to the doctor, when  the shrill, quick stroke of a clock rang out on the frosty air, followed by the  ping and flash of a pistol.</p>
  <p>A  sound of shattered glass, followed by a suppressed cry, told the bystanders  that the bullet had struck the mark, but before any one could move, or they could  rid their eyes of the smoke which the wind had blown into their faces, there  came another sound which made their hair stand on end and sent the blood back  in terror to their hearts. Another clock was striking, which they now perceived  was still standing upright on the stump where Mrs. Zabriskie had placed it.</p>
  <p>Whence  came the clock, then, which had struck before the time and been shattered for  its pains? One quick look told them. On the ground, ten paces to the right, lay  Zulma Zabriskie, a broken clock at her side, and in her breast a bullet which  was fast sapping the life from her sweet eyes.</p>
  <p>They  had to tell him, there was such pleading in her looks; and never will any of  the hearers forget the scream which rang from his lips as he realized the  truth. Breaking from their midst, he rushed forward, and fell at her feet as if  guided by some supernatural instinct.</p>
  <p>"Zulma,"  he shrieked, "what is this? Were not my hands dyed deep enough in blood that  you should make me answerable for your life also?"</p>
  <p>Her  eyes were closed but she opened them. Looking long and steadily at his agonized  face, she faltered forth:</p>
  <p>"It  is not you who have killed me; it is your crime. Had you been innocent of Mr.  Hasbrouck's death your bullet would never have found my heart. Did you think I  could survive the proof that you had killed that good man?"</p>
  <p>"I  did it unwittingly. I&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Hush!"  she commanded, with an awful look, which happily he could not see. "I had  another motive. I wished to prove to you, even at the cost of my life, that I  loved you, had always loved you, and not&mdash;"</p>
  <p>It  was now his turn to silence her. His hand crept to her lips, and his despairing  face turned itself blindly towards those about them.</p>
  <p>"Go!"  he cried; "leave us! Let me take a last farewell of my dying wife, without  listeners or spectators."</p>
  <p>Consulting  the eye of her employer who stood close beside her, and seeing no hope in it,  Violet fell slowly back. The others, followed, and the doctor was left alone  with his wife. From the distant position they took, they saw her arms creep  round his neck, saw her head fall confidingly on his breast, then silence  settled upon them, and upon all nature, the gathering twilight deepening, till  the last glow disappeared from the heavens above and from the circle of  leafless trees which enclosed this tragedy from the outside world.</p>
  <p>But  at last there came a stir, and Dr. Zabriskie, rising up before them with the  dead body of his wife held closely to his breast, confronted them with a  countenance so rapturous that he looked like a man transfigured.</p>
  <p>"I  will carry her to the boat," said he. "Not another hand shall touch her. She  was my true wife, my true wife!" And he towered into an attitude of such  dignity and passion that for a moment he took on heroic proportions and they  forgot that he had just proved himself to have committed a cold-blooded and  ghastly crime.</p>
  <p>The  stars were shining when the party again took their seats in the boat; and if  the scene of their crossing to Jersey was impressive, what shall be said of the  return?</p>
  <p>The  doctor, as before, sat in the stern, an awesome figure, upon which the moon  shone with a white radiance that seemed to lift his face out of the surrounding  darkness and set it like an image of frozen horror before their eyes. Against  his breast he held the form of his dead wife, and now and then Violet saw him  stoop as if he were listening for some token of life from her set lips. Then he  would lift himself again with hopelessness stamped upon his features, only to  lean forward in renewed hope that was again destined to disappointment.</p>
  <p>Violet  had been so overcome by this tragic end to all her hopes, that her employer had  been allowed to enter the boat with her. Seated at her side in the seat  directly in front of the doctor, he watched with her these simple tokens of a  breaking heart, saying nothing till they reached midstream, when true to his  instincts for all his awe and compassion, he suddenly bent towards him and  said:</p>
  <p>"Dr.  Zabriskie, the mystery of your crime is no longer a mystery to me. Listen and  see if I do not understand your temptation, and how you, a conscientious and  God-fearing man, came to slay your innocent neighbour.</p>
  <p>"A  friend of yours, or so he called himself, had for a long time filled your ears  with tales tending to make you suspicious of your wife and jealous of a certain  man whom I will not name. You knew that your friend had a grudge against this  man, and so for many months turned a deaf ear to his insinuations. But finally  some change which you detected in your wife's bearing or conversation roused  your own suspicions, and you began to doubt her truth and to curse your  blindness, which in a measure rendered you helpless. The jealous fever grew and  had risen to a high point when one night&mdash;a memorable night&mdash;this friend met you  just as you were leaving town, and with cruel craft whispered in your ear that  the man you hated was even then with your wife and that if you would return at  once to your home you would find him in her company.</p>
  <p>"The  demon that lurks at the heart of all men, good or bad, thereupon took complete  possession of you, and you answered this false friend by saying that you would  not return without a pistol. Whereupon he offered to take you to his house and  give you his. You consented, and getting rid of your servant by sending him to  Poughkeepsie with your excuses, you entered your friend's automobile.</p>
  <p>"You  say you bought the pistol, and perhaps you did, but, however that may be, you  left his house with it in your pocket, and declining companionship, walked  home, arriving at the Colonnade a little before midnight.</p>
  <p>"Ordinarily  you have no difficulty in recognizing your own doorstep. But, being in a heated  frame of mind, you walked faster than usual and so passed your own house and  stopped at that of Mr. Hasbrouck, one door beyond. As the entrances of these  houses are all alike, there was but one way by which you could have made  yourself sure that you had reached your own dwelling, and that was by feeling  for the doctor's sign at the side of the door. But you never thought of that.  Absorbed in dreams of vengeance, your sole impulse was to enter by the quickest  means possible. Taking out your night key, you thrust it into the lock. It  fitted, but it took strength to turn it, so much strength that the key was  twisted and bent by the effort. But this incident, which would have attracted  your attention at another time, was lost upon you at this moment. An entrance  had been effected, and you were in too excited a frame of mind to notice at  what cost, or to detect the small differences apparent in the atmosphere and  furnishings of the two houses, trifles which would have arrested your attention  under other circumstances, and made you pause before the upper floor had been  reached.</p>
  <p>"It  was while going up the stairs that you took out your pistol, so that by the  time you arrived at the front room door you held it already drawn and cocked in  your hand. For, being blind, you feared escape on the part of your victim, and  so waited for nothing but the sound of a man's voice before firing. When,  therefore, the unfortunate Mr. Hasbrouck, roused by this sudden intrusion,  advanced with an exclamation of astonishment, you pulled the trigger, and  killed him on the spot. It must have been immediately upon his fall that you  recognized from some word he uttered, or from some contact you may have had  with your surroundings, that you were in the wrong house and had killed the  wrong man; for you cried out, in evident remorse, 'God! what have I done!' and  fled without approaching your victim.</p>
  <p>"Descending  the stairs, you rushed from the house, closing the front door behind you and  regaining your own without being seen. But here you found yourself baffled in  your attempted escape, by two things. First, by the pistol you still held in  your hand, and secondly, by the fact that the key upon which you depended for  entering your own door was so twisted out of shape that you knew it would be  useless for you to attempt to use it. What did you do in this emergency? You  have already told us, though the story seemed so improbable at the time, you  found nobody to believe it but myself. The pistol you flung far away from you  down the pavement, from which, by one of those rare chances which sometimes  happen in this world, it was presently picked up by some late passer-by of more  or less doubtful character. The door offered less of an obstacle than you had  anticipated; for when you turned again you found it, if I am not greatly  mistaken, ajar, left so, as we have reason to believe, by one who had gone out  of it but a few minutes before in a state which left him but little master of  his actions. It was this fact which provided you with an answer when you were  asked how you succeeded in getting into Mr. Hasbrouck's house after the family  had retired for the night.</p>
  <p>"Astonished  at the coincidence, but hailing with gladness the deliverance which it offered,  you went in and ascended at once into your wife's presence; and it was from her  lips, and not from those of Mrs. Hasbrouck, that the cry arose which startled  the neighbourhood and prepared men's minds for the tragic words which were  shouted a moment later from the next house.</p>
  <p>"But  she who uttered the scream knew of no tragedy save that which was taking place  in her own breast. She had just repulsed a dastardly suitor, and seeing you  enter so unexpectedly in a state of unaccountable horror and agitation, was  naturally stricken with dismay, and thought she saw your ghost, or what was  worse, a possible avenger; while you, having failed to kill the man you sought,  and having killed a man you esteemed, let no surprise on her part lure you into  any dangerous self-betrayal. You strove instead to soothe her, and even  attempted to explain the excitement under which you laboured, by an account of  your narrow escape at the station, till the sudden alarm from next door  distracted her attention, and sent both your thoughts and hers in a different  direction. Not till conscience had fully awakened and the horror of your act  had had time to tell upon your sensitive nature, did you breathe forth those  vague confessions, which, not being supported by the only explanations which  would have made them credible, led her, as well as the police, to consider you  affected in your mind. Your pride as a man and your consideration for her as a  woman kept you silent, but did not keep the worm from preying upon your heart.</p>
  <p>"Am  I not correct in my surmises, Dr. Zabriskie, and is not this the true  explanation of your crime?"</p>
  <p>With  a strange look, he lifted up his face.</p>
  <p>"Hush!"  said he; "you will waken her. See how peacefully she sleeps! I should not like  to have her wakened now, she is so tired, and I&mdash;I have not watched over her as  I should."</p>
  <p>Appalled  at his gesture, his look, his tone, Violet drew back, and for a few minutes no  sound was to be heard but the steady dip-dip of the oars and the lap-lap of the  waters against the boat. Then there came a quick uprising, the swaying before  her of something dark and tall and threatening, and before she could speak or  move, or even stretch forth her hands to stay him, the seat before her was empty  and darkness had filled the place where but an instant previous he had sat, a  fearsome figure, erect and rigid as a sphinx.</p>
  <p>What  little moonlight there was, only served to show a few rising bubbles, marking  the spot where the unfortunate man had sunk with his much-loved burden. As the  widening circles fled farther and farther out, the tide drifted the boat away,  and the spot was lost which had seen the termination of one of earth's saddest  tragedies.</p>

  <p>"One  more! just one more well paying affair, and I promise to stop; really and truly  to stop."</p>
  <p>"But,  Puss, why one more? You have earned the amount you set for yourself,&mdash;or very  nearly,&mdash;and though my help is not great, in three months I can add enough&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"No,  you cannot, Arthur. You are doing well; I appreciate it; in fact, I am just  delighted to have you work for me in the way you do, but you cannot, in your  present position, make enough in three months, or in six, to meet the situation  as I see it. Enough does not satisfy me. The measure must be full, heaped up,  and running over. Possible failure following promise must be provided for.  Never must I feel myself called upon to do this kind of thing again. Besides, I  have never got over the Zabriskie tragedy. It haunts me continually. Something  new may help to put it out of my head. I feel guilty. I was responsible&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"No,  Puss. I will not have it that you were responsible. Some such end was bound to  follow a complication like that. Sooner or later he would have been driven to  shoot himself&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"But  not her."</p>
  <p>"No,  not her. But do you think she would have given those few minutes of perfect  understanding with her blind husband for a few years more of miserable life?"</p>
  <p>Violet  made no answer; she was too absorbed in her surprise. Was this Arthur? Had a  few weeks' work and a close connection with the really serious things of life  made this change in him? Her face beamed at the thought, which seeing, but not  understanding what underlay this evidence of joy, he bent and kissed her,  saying with some of his old nonchalance:</p>
  <p>"Forget  it, Violet; only don't let any one or anything lead you to interest yourself in  another affair of the kind. If you do, I shall have to consult a certain friend  of yours as to the best way of stopping this folly. I mention no names. Oh! you  need not look so frightened. Only behave; that's all."</p>
  <p>"He's  right," she acknowledged to herself, as he sauntered away; "altogether right."</p>
  <p>Yet  because she wanted the extra money&mdash;</p>
  <p>The  scene invited alarm,&mdash;that is, for so young a girl as Violet, surveying it from  an automobile some time after the stroke of midnight. An unknown house at the  end of a heavily shaded walk, in the open doorway of which could be seen the  silhouette of a woman's form leaning eagerly forward with arms outstretched in  an appeal for help! It vanished while she looked, but the effect remained,  holding her to her seat for one startled moment. This seemed strange, for she  had anticipated adventure. One is not summoned from a private ball to ride a  dozen miles into the country on an errand of investigation, without some  expectation of encountering the mysterious and the tragic. But Violet Strange,  for all her many experiences, was of a most susceptible nature, and for the  instant in which that door stood open, with only the memory of that expectant  figure to disturb the faintly lit vista of the hall beyond, she felt that grip  upon the throat which comes from an indefinable fear which no words can explain  and no plummet sound.</p>
  <p>But  this soon passed. With the setting of her foot to ground, conditions changed  and her emotions took on a more normal character. The figure of a man now stood  in the place held by the vanished woman; and it was not only that of one she  knew but that of one whom she trusted&mdash;a friend whose very presence gave her  courage. With this recognition came a better understanding of the situation,  and it was with a beaming eye and unclouded features that she tripped up the  walk to meet the expectant figure and outstretched hand of Roger Upjohn.</p>
  <p>"You  here!" she exclaimed, amid smiles and blushes, as he drew her into the hall.</p>
  <p>He  at once launched forth into explanations mingled with apologies for the  presumption he had shown in putting her to this inconvenience. There was  trouble in the house&mdash;great trouble. Something had occurred for which an  explanation must be found before morning, or the happiness and honour of more  than one person now under this unhappy roof would be wrecked. He knew it was  late&mdash;that she had been obliged to take a long and dreary ride alone, but her  success with the problem which had once come near wrecking his own life had  emboldened him to telephone to the office and&mdash;"But you are in ball-dress," he  cried in amazement. "Did you think&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"I  came from a ball. Word reached me between the dances. I did not go home. I had  been bidden to hurry."</p>
  <p>He  looked his appreciation, but when he spoke it was to say:</p>
  <p>"This  is the situation. Miss Digby&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"The  lady who is to be married tomorrow?"</p>
  <p>"Who  hopes to be married tomorrow."</p>
  <p>"How,  hopes?"</p>
  <p>"Who  will be married tomorrow, if a certain article lost in this house tonight can  be found before any of the persons who have been dining here leave for their  homes."</p>
  <p>Violet  uttered an exclamation.</p>
  <p>"Then,  Mr. Cornell," she began&mdash;</p>
  <p>"Mr.  Cornell has our utmost confidence," Roger hastened to interpose. "But the  article missing is one which he might reasonably desire to possess and which he  alone of all present had the opportunity of securing. You can therefore see why  he, with his pride&mdash;the pride of a man not rich, engaged to marry a woman who  is&mdash;should declare that unless his innocence is established before daybreak, the  doors of St. Bartholomew will remain shut to-morrow."</p>
  <p>"But  the article lost&mdash;what is it?"</p>
  <p>"Miss  Digby will give you the particulars. She is waiting to receive you," he added  with a gesture towards a half-open door at their right.</p>
  <p>Violet  glanced that way, then cast her looks up and down the hall in which they stood.</p>
  <p>"Do  you know that you have not told me in whose house I am? Not hers, I know. She  lives in the city."</p>
  <p>"And  you are twelve miles from Harlem. Miss Strange, you are in the Van Broecklyn  mansion, famous enough you will acknowledge. Have you never been here before?"</p>
  <p>"I  have been by here, but I recognized nothing in the dark. What an exciting place  for an investigation!"</p>
  <p>"And  Mr. Van Broecklyn? Have you never met him?"</p>
  <p>"Once,  when a child. He frightened me then."</p>
  <p>"And  may frighten you now; though I doubt it. Time has mellowed him. Besides, I have  prepared him for what might otherwise occasion him some astonishment. Naturally  he would not look for just the sort of lady investigator I am about to  introduce to him."</p>
  <p>She  smiled. Violet Strange was a very charming young woman, as well as a keen  prober of odd mysteries.</p>
  <p>The  meeting between herself and Miss Digby was a sympathetic one. After the first  inevitable shock which the latter felt at sight of the beauty and fashionable  appearance of the mysterious little being who was to solve her difficulties,  her glance, which, under other circumstances, might have lingered unduly upon  the piquant features and exquisite dressing of the fairy-like figure before  her, passed at once to Violet's eyes, in whose steady depths beamed an  intelligence quite at odds with the coquettish dimples which so often misled  the casual observer in his estimation of a character singularly subtle and  well-poised.</p>
  <p>As  for the impression she herself made upon Violet, it was the same she made upon  everyone. No one could look long at Florence Digby and not recognize the  loftiness of her spirit and the generous nature of her impulses. In person she  was tall and as she leaned to take Violet's hand, the difference between them  brought out the salient points in each, to the great admiration of the one  onlooker.</p>
  <p>Meantime,  for all her interest in the case in hand, Violet could not help casting a  hurried look about her, in gratification of the curiosity incited by her  entrance into a house signalized from its foundation by such a series of tragic  events. The result was disappointing. The walls were plain, the furniture  simple. Nothing suggestive in either, unless it was the fact that nothing was  new, nothing modern. As it looked in the days of Burr and Hamilton so it looked  to-day, even to the rather startling detail of candles which did duty on every  side in place of gas.</p>
  <p>As  Violet recalled the reason for this, the fascination of the past seized upon  her imagination. There was no knowing where this might have carried her, had  not the feverish gleam in Miss Digby's eyes warned her that the present held  its own excitement. Instantly, she was all attention and listening with  undivided mind to that lady's disclosures.</p>
  <p>They  were brief and to the following effect:</p>
  <p>The  dinner which had brought some half-dozen people together in this house had been  given in celebration of her impending marriage. But it was also in a way meant  as a compliment to one of the other guests, a Mr. Spielhagen, who, during the  week, had succeeded in demonstrating to a few experts the value of a discovery  he had made which would transform a great industry.</p>
  <p>In  speaking of this discovery, Miss Digby did not go into particulars, the whole  matter being far beyond her understanding; but in stating its value she openly  acknowledged that it was in the line of Mr. Cornell's own work, and one which  involved calculations and a formula which, if prematurely disclosed, would  invalidate the contract Mr. Spielhagen hoped to make, and thus destroy his  present hopes.</p>
  <p>Of  this formula but two copies existed. One was locked up in a safe deposit vault  in Boston, the other he had brought into the house on his person, and it was  the latter which was now missing, having been abstracted during the evening  from a manuscript of sixteen or more sheets, under circumstances which she  would now endeavour to relate.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Van Broecklyn, their host, had in his melancholy life but one interest which  could be at all absorbing. This was for explosives. As consequence, much of the  talk at the dinner-table had been on Mr. Spielhagen's discovery, and possible  changes it might introduce into this especial industry. As these, worked out  from a formula kept secret from the trade, could not but affect greatly Mr.  Cornell's interests, she found herself listening intently, when Mr. Van  Broecklyn, with an apology for his interference, ventured to remark that if Mr.  Spielhagen had made a valuable discovery in this line, so had he, and one which  he had substantiated by many experiments. It was not a marketable one, such as  Mr. Spielhagen's was, but in his work upon the same, and in the tests which he  had been led to make, he had discovered certain instances he would gladly name,  which demanded exceptional procedure to be successful. If Mr. Spielhagen's  method did not allow for these exceptions, nor make suitable provision for them,  then Mr. Spielhagen's method would fail more times than it would succeed. Did  it so allow and so provide? It would relieve him greatly to learn that it did.</p>
  <p>The  answer came quickly. Yes, it did. But later and after some further  conversation, Mr. Spielhagen's confidence seemed to wane, and before they left  the dinner-table, he openly declared his intention of looking over his  manuscript again that very night, in order to be sure that the formula therein  contained duly covered all the exceptions mentioned by Mr. Van Broecklyn.</p>
  <p>If  Mr. Cornell's countenance showed any change at this moment, she for one had not  noticed it; but the bitterness with which he remarked upon the other's good  fortune in having discovered this formula of whose entire success he had no  doubt, was apparent to everybody, and naturally gave point to the circumstances  which a short time afterward associated him with the disappearance of the same.</p>
  <p>The  ladies (there were two others besides herself) having withdrawn in a body to  the music-room, the gentlemen all proceeded to the library to smoke. Here,  conversation loosed from the one topic which had hitherto engrossed it, was  proceeding briskly, when Mr. Spielhagen, with nervous gesture, impulsively  looked about him and said:</p>
  <p>"I  cannot rest till I have run through my thesis again. Where can I find a quiet  spot? I won't be long; I read very rapidly."</p>
  <p>It  was for Mr. Van Broecklyn to answer, but no word coming from him, every eye  turned his way, only to find him sunk in one of those fits of abstraction so  well known to his friends, and from which no one who has this strange man's  peace of mind at heart ever presumes to rouse him.</p>
  <p>What  was to be done? These moods of their singular host sometimes lasted half an  hour, and Mr. Spielhagen had not the appearance of a man of patience. Indeed he  presently gave proof of the great uneasiness he was labouring under, for  noticing a door standing ajar on the other side of the room, he remarked to  those around him:</p>
  <p>"A  den! and lighted! Do you see any objection to my shutting myself in there for a  few minutes?"</p>
  <p>No  one venturing to reply, he rose, and giving a slight push to the door,  disclosed a small room exquisitely panelled and brightly lighted, but without  one article of furniture in it, not even a chair.</p>
  <p>"The  very place," quoth Mr. Spielhagen, and lifting a light cane-bottomed chair from  the many standing about, he carried it inside and shut the door behind him.</p>
  <p>Several  minutes passed during which the man who had served at table entered with a tray  on which were several small glasses evidently containing some choice liqueur.  Finding his master fixed in one of his strange moods, he set the tray down and,  pointing to one of the glasses, said:</p>
  <p>"That  is for Mr. Van Broecklyn. It contains his usual quieting powder." And urging  the gentlemen to help themselves, he quietly left the room. Mr. Upjohn lifted  the glass nearest him, and Mr. Cornell seemed about to do the same when he  suddenly reached forward and catching up one farther off started for the room  in which Mr. Spielhagen had so deliberately secluded himself.</p>
  <p>Why  he did all this&mdash;why, above all things, he should reach across the tray for a  glass instead of taking the one under his hand, he can no more explain than why  he has followed many another unhappy impulse. Nor did he understand the nervous  start given by Mr. Spielhagen at his entrance, or the stare with which that  gentleman took the glass from his hand and mechanically drank its contents,  till he saw how his hand had stretched itself across the sheet of paper he was  reading, in an open attempt to hide the lines visible between his fingers. Then  indeed the intruder flushed and withdrew in great embarrassment, fully  conscious of his indiscretion but not deeply disturbed till Mr. Van Broecklyn,  suddenly arousing and glancing down at the tray placed very near his hand  remarked in some surprise: "Dobbs seems to have forgotten me." Then indeed, the  unfortunate Mr. Cornell realized what he had done. It was the glass intended  for his host which he had caught up and carried into the other room&mdash;the glass  which he had been told contained a drug. Of what folly he had been guilty, and  how tame would be any effort at excuse!</p>
  <p>Attempting  none, he rose and with a hurried glance at Mr. Upjohn who flushed in sympathy  at his distress, he crossed to the door he had lately closed upon Mr.  Spielhagen. But feeling his shoulder touched as his hand pressed the knob, he  turned to meet the eye of Mr. Van Broecklyn fixed upon him with an expression  which utterly confounded him.</p>
  <p>"Where  are you going?" that gentleman asked.</p>
  <p>The  questioning tone, the severe look, expressive at once of displeasure and  astonishment, were most disconcerting, but Mr. Cornell managed to stammer  forth:</p>
  <p>"Mr.  Spielhagen is in here consulting his thesis. When your man brought in the  cordial, I was awkward enough to catch up your glass and carry it in to. Mr.  Spielhagen. He drank it and I&mdash;I am anxious to see if it did him any harm."</p>
  <p>As  he uttered the last word he felt Mr. Van Broecklyn's hand slip from his  shoulder, but no word accompanied the action, nor did his host make the least  move to follow him into the room.</p>
  <p>This  was a matter of great regret to him later, as it left him for a moment out of  the range of every eye, during which he says he simply stood in a state of shock  at seeing Mr. Spielhagen still sitting there, manuscript in hand, but with head  fallen forward and eyes closed; dead, asleep or&mdash;he hardly knew what; the sight  so paralysed him.</p>
  <p>Whether  or not this was the exact truth and the whole truth, Mr. Cornell certainly  looked very unlike himself as he stepped back into Mr. Van Broecklyn's  presence; and he was only partially reassured when that gentleman protested  that there was no real harm in the drug, and that Mr. Spielhagen would be all  right if left to wake naturally and without shock. However, as his present  attitude was one of great discomfort, they decided to carry him back and lay  him on the library lounge. But before doing this, Mr. Upjohn drew from his  flaccid grasp, the precious manuscript, and carrying it into the larger room  placed it on a remote table, where it remained undisturbed till Mr. Spielhagen,  suddenly coming to himself at the end of some fifteen minutes, missed the  sheets from his hand, and bounding up, crossed the room to repossess himself of  them.</p>
  <p>His  face, as he lifted them up and rapidly ran through them with ever-accumulating  anxiety, told them what they had to expect.</p>
  <p>The  page containing the formula was gone!</p>
  <p>Violet  now saw her problem.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>II</b></p>
  <p>There  was no doubt about the loss I have mentioned; all could see that page 13 was  not there. In vain a second handling of every sheet, the one so numbered was  not to be found. Page 14 met the eye on the top of the pile, and page 12  finished it off at the bottom, but no page 13 in between, or anywhere else.</p>
  <p>Where  had it vanished, and through whose agency had this misadventure occurred? No  one could say, or, at least, no one there made any attempt to do so, though  everybody started to look for it.</p>
  <p>But  where look? The adjoining small room offered no facilities for hiding a  cigar-end, much less a square of shining white paper. Bare walls, a bare floor,  and a single chair for furniture, comprised all that was to be seen in this  direction. Nor could the room in which they then stood be thought to hold it, unless  it was on the person of some one of them. Could this be the explanation of the  mystery? No man looked his doubts; but Mr. Cornell, possibly divining the  general feeling, stepped up to Mr. Van Broecklyn and in a cool voice, but with  the red burning hotly on either cheek, said, so as to be heard by everyone  present:</p>
  <p>"I  demand to be searched&mdash;at once and thoroughly."</p>
  <p>A  moment's silence, then the common cry:</p>
  <p>"We  will all be searched."</p>
  <p>"Is  Mr. Spielhagen sure that the missing page was with the others when he sat down  in the adjoining room to read his thesis?" asked their perturbed host.</p>
  <p>"Very  sure," came the emphatic reply. "Indeed, I was just going through the formula  itself when I fell asleep."</p>
  <p>"You  are ready to assert this?"</p>
  <p>"I  am ready to swear it."</p>
  <p>Mr.  Cornell repeated his request.</p>
  <p>"I  demand that you make a thorough search of my person. I must be cleared, and  instantly, of every suspicion," he gravely asserted, "or how can I marry Miss  Digby to-morrow."</p>
  <p>After  that there was no further hesitation. One and all subjected themselves to the  ordeal suggested; even Mr. Spielhagen. But this effort was as futile as the  rest. The lost page was not found.</p>
  <p>What  were they to think? What were they to do?</p>
  <p>There  seemed to be nothing left to do, and yet some further attempt must be made  towards the recovery of this important formula. Mr. Cornell's marriage and Mr.  Spielhagen's business success both depended upon its being in the latter's  hands before six in the morning, when he was engaged to hand it over to a  certain manufacturer sailing for Europe on an early steamer.</p>
  <p>Five  hours!</p>
  <p>Had  Mr. Van Broecklyn a suggestion to offer? No, he was as much at sea as the rest.</p>
  <p>Simultaneously  look crossed look. Blankness was on every face.</p>
  <p>"Let  us call the ladies," suggested one.</p>
  <p>It  was done, and however great the tension had been before, it was even greater  when Miss Digby stepped upon the scene. But she was not a woman to be shaken  from her poise even by a crisis of this importance. When the dilemma had been  presented to her and the full situation grasped, she looked first at Mr.  Cornell and then at Mr. Spielhagen, and quietly said:</p>
  <p>"There  is but one explanation possible of this matter. Mr. Spielhagen will excuse me,  but he is evidently mistaken in thinking that he saw the lost page among the  rest. The condition into which he was thrown by the unaccustomed drug he had  drank, made him liable to hallucinations. I have not the least doubt he thought  he had been studying the formula at the time he dropped off to sleep. I have  every confidence in the gentleman's candour. But so have I in that of Mr.  Cornell," she supplemented, with a smile.</p>
  <p>An  exclamation from Mr. Van Broecklyn and a subdued murmur from all but Mr.  Spielhagen testified to the effect of this suggestion, and there is no saying  what might have been the result if Mr. Cornell had not hurriedly put in this  extraordinary and most unexpected protest:</p>
  <p>"Miss  Digby has my gratitude," said he, "for a confidence which I hope to prove to be  deserved. But I must say this for Mr. Spielhagen. He was correct in stating  that he was engaged in looking over his formula when I stepped into his  presence with the glass of cordial. If you were not in a position to see the  hurried way in which his hand instinctively spread itself over the page he was  reading, I was; and if that does not seem conclusive to you, then I feel bound  to state that in unconsciously following this movement of his, I plainly saw  the number written on the top of the page, and that number was&mdash;13."</p>
  <p>A  loud exclamation, this time from Spielhagen himself, announced his gratitude  and corresponding change of attitude toward the speaker.</p>
  <p>"Wherever  that damned page has gone," he protested, advancing towards Cornell with  outstretched hand, "you have nothing to do with its disappearance."</p>
  <p>Instantly  all constraint fled, and every countenance took on a relieved expression. But  the problem remained.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  those very words passed some one's lips, and with their utterance Mr. Upjohn  remembered how at an extraordinary crisis in his own life he had been helped  and an equally difficult problem settled, by a little lady secretly attached to  a private detective agency. If she could only be found and hurried here before  morning, all might yet be well. He would make the effort. Such wild schemes  sometimes work. He telephoned to the office and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Was  there anything else Miss Strange would like to know?</p>
  <p align="center"><b>III</b></p>
  <p>Miss  Strange, thus appealed to, asked where the gentlemen were now.</p>
  <p>She  was told that they were still all together in the library; the ladies had been  sent home.</p>
  <p>"Then  let us go to them," said Violet, hiding under a smile her great fear that here  was an affair which might very easily spell for her that dismal word, failure.</p>
  <p>So  great was that fear that under all ordinary circumstances she would have had no  thought for anything else in the short interim between this stating of the  problem and her speedy entrance among the persons involved. But the  circumstances of this case were so far from ordinary, or rather let me put it  in this way, the setting of the case was so very extraordinary, that she  scarcely thought of the problem before her, in her great interest in the house  through whose rambling halls she was being so carefully guided. So much that  was tragic and heartrending had occurred here. The Van Broecklyn name, the Van  Broecklyn history, above all the Van Broecklyn tradition, which made the house  unique in the country's annals (of which more hereafter), all made an appeal to  her imagination, and centred her thoughts on what she saw about her. There was a door which no man ever opened&mdash;had never opened since Revolutionary times&mdash;should  she see it? Should she know it if she did see it? Then Mr. Van Broecklyn  himself! just to meet him, under any conditions and in any place, was an event.  But to meet him here, under the pall of his own mystery! No wonder she had no  words for her companions, or that her thoughts clung to this anticipation in  wonder and almost fearsome delight.</p>
  <p>His  story was a well-known one. A bachelor and a misanthrope, he lived absolutely  alone save for a large entourage of servants, all men and elderly ones at that.  He never visited. Though he now and then, as on this occasion, entertained  certain persons under his roof, he declined every invitation for himself,  avoiding even, with equal strictness, all evening amusements of whatever kind,  which would detain him in the city after ten at night. Perhaps this was to  ensure no break in his rule of life never to sleep out of his own bed. Though  he was a man well over fifty he had not spent, according to his own statement,  but two nights out of his own bed since his return from Europe in early  boyhood, and those were in obedience to a judicial summons which took him to  Boston.</p>
  <p>This  was his main eccentricity, but he had another which is apparent enough from  what has already been said. He avoided women. If thrown in with them during his  short visits into town, he was invariably polite and at times companionable,  but he never sought them out, nor had gossip, contrary to its usual habit, ever  linked his name with one of the sex.</p>
  <p>Yet  he was a man of more than ordinary attraction. His features were fine and his  figure impressive. He might have been the cynosure of all eyes had he chosen to  enter crowded drawing-rooms, or even to frequent public assemblages, but having  turned his back upon everything of the kind in his youth, he had found it  impossible to alter his habits with advancing years; nor was he now expected  to. The position he had taken was respected. Leonard Van Broecklyn was no  longer criticized.</p>
  <p>Was  there any explanation for this strangely self-centred life? Those who knew him  best seemed to think so. In the first place he had sprung from an unfortunate  stock. Events of unusual and tragic nature had marked the family of both  parents. Nor had his parents themselves been exempt from this seeming fatality.  Antagonistic in tastes and temperament, they had dragged on an unhappy  existence in the old home, till both natures rebelled, and a separation ensued  which not only disunited their lives but sent them to opposite sides of the  globe never to return again. At least, that was the inference drawn from the  peculiar circumstances attending the event. On the morning of one  never-to-be-forgotten day, John Van Broecklyn, the grandfather of the present  representative of the family, found the following note from his son lying on  the library table:</p>
  <p>"FATHER:</p>
  <p>"Life  in this house, or any house, with her is no longer endurable. One of us must  go. The mother should not be separated from her child. Therefore it is I whom  you will never see again. Forget me, but be considerate of her and the boy.</p>
  <p>"WILLIAM."</p>
  <p>Six  hours later another note was found, this time from the wife:</p>
  <p>"FATHER:</p>
  <p>"Tied  to a rotting corpse what does one do? Lop off one's arm if necessary to rid one  of the contact. As all love between your son and myself is dead, I can no  longer live within the sound of his voice. As this is his home, he is the one  to remain in it. May our child reap the benefit of his mother's loss and his  father's affection.</p>
  <p>"RHODA."</p>
  <p>Both  were gone, and gone forever. Simultaneous in their departure, they preserved  each his own silence and sent no word back. If the one went east and the other  west, they may have met on the other side of the globe, but never again in the  home which sheltered their boy. For him and for his grandfather they had sunk  from sight in the great sea of humanity, leaving them stranded on an isolated  and mournful shore. The grand-father steeled himself to the double loss, for  the child's sake; but the boy of eleven succumbed. Few of the world's great  sufferers, of whatever age or condition, have mourned as this child mourned, or  shown the effects of his grief so deeply or so long. Not till he had passed his  majority did the line, carved in one day in his baby forehead, lose any of its  intensity; and there are those who declare that even later than that, the  midnight stillness of the house was disturbed from time to time by his muffled  shriek of "Mother! Mother!", sending the servants from the house, and adding  one more horror to the many which clung about this accursed mansion.</p>
  <p>Of  this cry Violet had heard, and it was that and the door&mdash;But I have already told  you about the door which she was still looking for, when her two companions  suddenly halted, and she found herself on the threshold of the library, in full  view of Mr. Van Broecklyn and his two guests.</p>
  <p>Slight  and fairy-like in figure, with an air of modest reserve more in keeping with  her youth and dainty dimpling beauty than with her errand, her appearance  produced an astonishment none of which the gentlemen were able to disguise.  This the clever detective, with a genius for social problems and odd elusive  cases! This darling of the ball-room in satin and pearls! Mr. Spielhagen  glanced at Mr. Cornell, and Mr. Cornell at Mr. Spielhagen, and both at Mr.  Upjohn, in very evident distrust. As for Violet, she had eyes only for Mr. Van  Broecklyn who stood before her in a surprise equal to that of the others but  with more restraint in its expression.</p>
  <p>She  was not disappointed in him. She had expected to see a man, reserved almost to  the point of austerity. And she found his first look even more awe-compelling  than her imagination had pictured; so much so indeed, that her resolution  faltered, and she took a quick step backward; which seeing, he smiled and her  heart and hopes grew warm again. That he could smile, and smile with absolute  sweetness, was her great comfort when later&mdash;But I am introducing you too  hurriedly to the catastrophe. There is much to be told first.</p>
  <p>I  pass over the preliminaries, and come at once to the moment when Violet, having  listened to a repetition of the full facts, stood with downcast eyes before  these gentlemen, complaining in some alarm to herself: "They expect me to tell  them now and without further search or parley just where this missing page is.  I shall have to balk that expectation without losing their confidence. But  how?"</p>
  <p>Summoning  up her courage and meeting each inquiring eye with a look which seemed to carry  a different message to each, she remarked very quietly:</p>
  <p>"This  is not a matter to guess at. I must have time and I must look a little deeper  into the facts just given me. I presume that the table I see over there is the  one upon which Mr. Upjohn laid the manuscript during Mr. Spielhagen's  unconsciousness."</p>
  <p>All  nodded.</p>
  <p>"Is  it&mdash;I mean the table&mdash;in the same condition it was then? Has nothing been taken  from it except the manuscript?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing."</p>
  <p>"Then  the missing page is not there," she smiled, pointing to its bare top. A pause,  during which she stood with her gaze fixed on the floor before her. She was  thinking and thinking hard.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  she came to a decision. Addressing Mr. Upjohn she asked if he were quite sure  that in taking the manuscript from Mr. Spielhagen's hand he had neither  disarranged nor dropped one of its pages.</p>
  <p>The  answer was unequivocal.</p>
  <p>"Then,"  she declared, with quiet assurance and a steady meeting with her own of every  eye, "as the thirteenth page was not found among the others when they were  taken from this table, nor on the persons of either Mr. Cornell or Mr.  Spielhagen, it is still in that inner room."</p>
  <p>"Impossible!"  came from every lip, each in a different tone. "That room is absolutely empty."</p>
  <p>"May  I have a look at its emptiness?" she asked, with a naive glance at Mr. Van  Broecklyn.</p>
  <p>"There  is positively nothing in the room but the chair Mr. Spielhagen sat on,"  objected that gentleman with a noticeable air of reluctance.</p>
  <p>"Still,  may I not have a look at it?" she persisted, with that disarming smile she kept  for great occasions.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Van Broecklyn bowed. He could not refuse a request so urged, but his step was  slow and his manner next to ungracious as he led the way to the door of the  adjoining room and threw it open.</p>
  <p>Just  what she had been told to expect! Bare walls and floors and an empty chair! Yet  she did not instantly withdraw, but stood silently contemplating the panelled  wainscoting surrounding her, as though she suspected it of containing some  secret hiding-place not apparent to the eye.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Van Broecklyn, noting this, hastened to say:</p>
  <p>"The  walls are sound, Miss Strange. They contain no hidden cupboards."</p>
  <p>"And  that door?" she asked, pointing to a portion of the wainscoting so exactly like  the rest that only the most experienced eye could detect the line of deeper  colour which marked an opening.</p>
  <p>For  an instant Mr. Van Broecklyn stood rigid, then the immovable pallor, which was  one of his chief characteristics, gave way to a deep flush as he explained:</p>
  <p>"There  was a door there once; but it has been permanently closed. With cement," he forced  himself to add, his countenance losing its evanescent colour till it shone  ghastly again in the strong light.</p>
  <p>With  difficulty Violet preserved her show of composure. "The door!" she murmured to  herself. "I have found it. The great historic door!" But her tone was light as  she ventured to say:</p>
  <p>"Then  it can no longer be opened by your hand or any other?"</p>
  <p>"It  could not be opened with an axe."</p>
  <p>Violet  sighed in the midst of her triumph. Her curiosity had been satisfied, but the  problem she had been set to solve looked inexplicable. But she was not one to  yield easily to discouragement. Marking the disappointment approaching to  disdain in every eye but Mr. Upjohn's, she drew herself up&mdash;(she had not far to  draw) and made this final proposal.</p>
  <p>"A  sheet of paper," she remarked, "of the size of this one cannot be spirited  away, or dissolved into thin air. It exists; it is here; and all we want is  some happy thought in order to find it. I acknowledge that that happy thought  has not come to me yet, but sometimes I get it in what may seem to you a very  odd way. Forgetting myself, I try to assume the individuality of the person who  has worked the mystery. If I can think with his thoughts, I possibly may follow  him in his actions. In this case I should like to make believe for a few  moments that I am Mr. Spielhagen" (with what a delicious smile she said this)  "I should like to hold his thesis in my hand and be interrupted in my reading  by Mr. Cornell offering his glass of cordial; then I should like to nod and  slip off mentally into a deep sleep. Possibly in that sleep the dream may come  which will clarify the whole situation. Will you humour me so far?"</p>
  <p>A  ridiculous concession, but finally she had her way; the farce was enacted and  they left her as she had requested them to do, alone with her dreams in the  small room.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  they heard her cry out, and in another moment she appeared before them, the  picture of excitement.</p>
  <p>"Is  this chair standing exactly as it did when Mr. Spielhagen occupied it?" she  asked.</p>
  <p>"No,"  said Mr. Upjohn, "it faced the other way."</p>
  <p>She  stepped back and twirled the chair about with her disengaged hand.</p>
  <p>"So?"</p>
  <p>Mr.  Upjohn and Mr. Spielhagen both nodded, so did the others when she glanced at  them.</p>
  <p>With  a sign of ill-concealed satisfaction, she drew their attention to herself; then  eagerly cried:</p>
  <p>"Gentlemen,  look here!"</p>
  <p>Seating  herself, she allowed her whole body to relax till she presented the picture of  one calmly asleep. Then, as they continued to gaze at with fascinated eyes, not  knowing what to expect, they saw something white escape from her lap and slide  across the floor till it touched and was stayed by the wainscot. It was the top  page of the manuscript she held, and as some inkling of the truth reached their  astonished minds, she sprang impetuously to her feet and, pointing to the  fallen sheet, cried:</p>
  <p>"Do  you understand now? Look where it lies and then look here!"</p>
  <p>She  had bounded towards the wall and was now on her knees pointing to the bottom of  the wainscot, just a few inches to the left of the fallen page.</p>
  <p>"A  crack!" she cried, "under what was once the door. It's a very thin one, hardly  perceptible to the eye. But see!" Here she laid her finger on the fallen paper  and drawing it towards her, pushed it carefully against the lower edge of the  wainscot. Half of it at once disappeared.</p>
  <p>"I  could easily slip it all through," she assured them, withdrawing the sheet and  leaping to her feet in triumph. "You know now where the missing page lies, Mr.  Spielhagen. All that remains is for Mr. Van Broecklyn to get it for you."</p>
  <p align="center"><b>IV</b></p>
  <p>The  cries of mingled astonishment and relief which greeted this simple elucidation  of the mystery were broken by a curiously choked, almost unintelligible, cry.  It came from the man thus appealed to, who, unnoticed by them all, had started  at her first word and gradually, as action followed action, withdrawn himself  till he now stood alone and in an attitude almost of defiance behind the large  table in the centre of the library.</p>
  <p>"I  am sorry," he began, with a brusqueness which gradually toned down into a  forced urbanity as he beheld every eye fixed upon him in amazement, "that  circumstances forbid my being of assistance to you in this unfortunate matter.  If the paper lies where you say, and I see no other explanation of its loss, I  am afraid it will have to remain there for this night at least. The cement in  which that door is embedded is thick as any wall; it would take men with  pickaxes, possibly with dynamite, to make a breach there wide enough for any  one to reach in. And we are far from any such help."</p>
  <p>In  the midst of the consternation caused by these words, the clock on the mantel  behind his back rang out the hour. It was but a double stroke, but that meant  two hours after midnight and had the effect of a knell in the hearts of those  most interested.</p>
  <p>"But  I am expected to give that formula into the hands of our manager before six  o'clock in the morning. The steamer sails at a quarter after."</p>
  <p>"Can't  you reproduce a copy of it from memory?" some one asked; "and insert it in its  proper place among the pages you hold there?"</p>
  <p>"The  paper would not be the same. That would lead to questions and the truth would  come out. As the chief value of the process contained in that formula lies in  its secrecy, no explanation I could give would relieve me from the suspicions  which an acknowledgment of the existence of a third copy, however well hidden,  would entail. I should lose my great opportunity."</p>
  <p>Mr.  Cornell's state of mind can be imagined. In an access of mingled regret and  despair, he cast a glance at Violet, who, with a nod of understanding, left the  little room in which they still stood, and approached Mr. Van Broecklyn.</p>
  <p>Lifting  up her head,&mdash;for he was very tall,&mdash;and instinctively rising on her toes the  nearer to reach his ear, she asked in a cautious whisper:</p>
  <p>"Is  there no other way of reaching that place?"</p>
  <p>She  acknowledged afterwards, that for one moment her heart stood still from fear,  such a change took place in his face, though she says he did not move a muscle.  Then, just when she was expecting from him some harsh or forbidding word, he  wheeled abruptly away from her and crossing to a window at his side, lifted the  shade and looked out. When he returned, he was his usual self so far as she  could see.</p>
  <p>"There  is a way," he now confided to her in a tone as low as her own, "but it can only  be taken by a child."</p>
  <p>"Not  by me?" she asked, smiling down at her own childish proportions.</p>
  <p>For  an instant he seemed taken aback, then she saw his hand begin to tremble and  his lips twitch. Somehow&mdash;she knew not why&mdash;she began to pity him, and asked  herself as she felt rather than saw the struggle in his mind, that here was a  trouble which if once understood would greatly dwarf that of the two men in the  room behind them.</p>
  <p>"I  am discreet," she whisperingly declared. "I have heard the history of that  door&mdash;how it was against the tradition of the family to have it opened. There  must have been some very dreadful reason. But old superstitions do not affect  me, and if you will allow me to take the way you mention, I will follow your  bidding exactly, and will not trouble myself about anything but the recovery of  this paper, which must lie only a little way inside that blocked-up door."</p>
  <p>Was  his look one of rebuke at her presumption, or just the constrained expression  of a perturbed mind? Probably, the latter, for while she watched him for some  understanding of his mood, he reached out his hand and touched one of the satin  folds crossing her shoulder.</p>
  <p>"You  would soil this irretrievably," said he.</p>
  <p>"There  is stuff in the stores for another," she smiled. Slowly his touch deepened into  pressure. Watching him she saw the crust of some old fear or dominant  superstition melt under her eyes, and was quite prepared, when he remarked,  with what for him was a lightsome air:</p>
  <p>"I  will buy the stuff, if you will dare the darkness and intricacies of our old  cellar. I can give you no light. You will have to feel your way according to my  direction."</p>
  <p>"I  am ready to dare anything."</p>
  <p>He  left her abruptly.</p>
  <p>"I  will warn Miss Digby," he called back. "She shall go with you as far as the  cellar."</p>
  <p align="center"><b>V</b></p>
  <p>Violet  in her short career as an investigator of mysteries had been in many a  situation calling for more than womanly nerve and courage. But never&mdash;or so it  seemed to her at the time&mdash;had she experienced a greater depression of spirit  than when she stood with Miss Digby before a small door at the extreme end of  the cellar, and understood that here was her road&mdash;a road which once entered,  she must take alone.</p>
  <p>First,  it was such a small door! No child older than eleven could possibly squeeze  through it. But she was of the size of a child of eleven and might possibly  manage that difficulty.</p>
  <p>Secondly:  there are always some unforeseen possibilities in every situation, and though  she had listened carefully to Mr. Van Broecklyn's directions and was sure that  she knew them by heart, she wished she had kissed her father more tenderly in  leaving him that night for the ball, and that she had not pouted so undutifully  at some harsh stricture he had made. Did this mean fear? She despised the  feeling if it did.</p>
  <p>Thirdly:  She hated darkness. She knew this when she offered herself for this  undertaking; but she was in a bright room at the moment and only imagined what  she must now face as a reality. But one jet had been lit in the cellar and that  near the entrance. Mr. Van Broecklyn seemed not to need light, even in his  unfastening of the small door which Violet was sure had been protected by more  than one lock.</p>
  <p>Doubt,  shadow, and a solitary climb between unknown walls, with only a streak of light  for her goal, and the clinging pressure of Florence Digby's hand on her own for  solace&mdash;surely the prospect was one to tax the courage of her young heart to its  limit. But she had promised, and she would fulfill. So with a brave smile she  stooped to the little door, and in another moment had started her journey.</p>
  <p>For  journey the shortest distance may seem when every inch means a heart-throb and  one grows old in traversing a foot. At first the way was easy; she had but to  crawl up a slight incline with the comforting consciousness that two people  were within reach of her voice, almost within sound of her beating heart. But  presently she came to a turn, beyond which her fingers failed to reach any wall  on her left. Then came a step up which she stumbled, and farther on a short  flight, each tread of which she had been told to test before she ventured to  climb it, lest the decay of innumerable years should have weakened the wood too  much to bear her weight. One, two, three, four, five steps! Then a landing with  an open space beyond. Half of her journey was done. Here she felt she could  give a minute to drawing her breath naturally, if the air, unchanged in years,  would allow her to do so. Besides, here she had been enjoined to do a certain  thing and to do it according to instructions. Three matches had been given her  and a little night candle. Denied all light up to now, it was at this point she  was to light her candle and place it on the floor, so that in returning she  should not miss the staircase and get a fall. She had promised to do this, and  was only too happy to see a spark of light scintillate into life in the  immeasurable darkness.</p>
  <p>She  was now in a great room long closed to the world, where once officers in  Colonial wars had feasted, and more than one council had been held. A room,  too, which had seen more than one tragic happening, as its almost unparalleled  isolation proclaimed. So much Mr. Van Broecklyn had told her; but she was  warned to be careful in traversing it and not upon any pretext to swerve aside  from the right-hand wall till she came to a huge mantelpiece. This passed, and  a sharp corner turned, she ought to see somewhere in the dim spaces before her  a streak of vivid light shining through the crack at the bottom of the  blocked-up door. The paper should be somewhere near this streak.</p>
  <p>All  simple, all easy of accomplishment, if only that streak of light were all she  was likely to see or think of. If the horror which was gripping her throat  should not take shape! If things would remain shrouded in impenetrable  darkness, and not force themselves in shadowy suggestion upon her excited  fancy! But the blackness of the passage-way through which she had just  struggled was not to be found here. Whether it was the effect of that small  flame flickering at the top of the staircase behind her, or of some change in  her own powers of seeing, surely there was a difference in her present outlook.  Tall shapes were becoming visible&mdash;the air was no longer blank&mdash;she could  see&mdash;Then suddenly she saw why. In the wall high up on her right was a window.  It was small and all but invisible, being covered on the outside with vines,  and on the inside with the cobwebs of a century. But some small gleams from the  star-light night came through, making phantasms out of ordinary things, which  unseen were horrible enough, and half seen choked her heart with terror.</p>
  <p>"I  cannot bear it," she whispered to herself even while creeping forward, her hand  upon the wall. "I will close my eyes" was her next thought. "I will make my own  darkness," and with a spasmodic forcing of her lids together, she continued to  creep on, passing the mantelpiece, where she knocked against something which  fell with an awful clatter.</p>
  <p>This  sound, followed as it was by that of smothered voices from the excited group  awaiting the result of her experiment from behind the impenetrable wall she  should be nearing now if she had followed her instructions aright, freed her  instantly from her fancies; and opening her eyes once more, she cast a look  ahead, and to her delight, saw but a few steps away, the thin streak of bright  light which marked the end of her journey.</p>
  <p>It  took her but a moment after that to find the missing page, and picking it up in  haste from the dusty floor, she turned herself quickly about and joyfully began  to retrace her steps. Why then, was it that in the course of a few minutes more  her voice suddenly broke into a wild, unearthly shriek, which ringing with  terror burst the bounds of that dungeon-like room, and sank, a barbed shaft,  into the breasts of those awaiting the result of her doubtful adventure, at  either end of this dread no-thoroughfare.</p>
  <p>What  had happened?</p>
  <p>If  they had thought to look out, they would have seen that the moon&mdash;held in check  by a bank of cloud occupying half the heavens&mdash;had suddenly burst its bounds and  was sending long bars of revealing light into every uncurtained window.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>VI</b></p>
  <p>Florence  Digby, in her short and sheltered life, had possibly never known any very great  or deep emotion. But she touched the bottom of extreme terror at that moment,  as with her ears still thrilling with Violet's piercing cry, she turned to look  at Mr. Van Broecklyn, and beheld the instantaneous wreck it had made of this  seemingly strong man. Not till he came to lie in his coffin would he show a  more ghastly countenance; and trembling herself almost to the point of falling,  caught him by the arm and sought to read his face what had happened. Something  disastrous she was sure; something which he had feared and was partially  prepared for, yet which in happening had crushed him. Was it a pitfall into  which the poor little lady had fallen? If so&mdash;But he is speaking&mdash;mumbling low  words to himself. Some of them she can hear. He is reproaching  himself&mdash;repeating over and over that he should never have taken such a chance;  that he should have remembered her youth&mdash;the weakness of a young girl's nerve.  He had been mad, and now&mdash;and now&mdash;</p>
  <p>With  the repetition of this word his murmuring ceased. All his energies were now  absorbed in listening at the low door separating him from what he was agonizing  to know&mdash;a door impossible to enter, impossible to enlarge&mdash;a barrier to all  help&mdash;an opening whereby sound might pass but nothing else, save her own small  body, now lying&mdash;where?</p>
  <p>"Is  she hurt?" faltered Florence, stooping, herself, to listen. "Can you hear  anything&mdash;anything?"</p>
  <p>For  an instant he did not answer; every faculty was absorbed in the one sense; then  slowly and in gasps he began to mutter:</p>
  <p>"I  think&mdash;I hear&mdash;something. Her step&mdash;no, no, no step. All is as quiet as death; not  a sound, not a breath&mdash;she has fainted. O God! O God! Why this calamity on top  of all!"</p>
  <p>He  had sprung to his feet at the utterance this invocation, but next moment was  down on knees again, listening&mdash;listening.</p>
  <p>Never  was silence more profound; they were hearkening for murmurs from a tomb.  Florence began to sense the full horror of it all, and was swaying helplessly  when Mr. Van Broecklyn impulsively lifted his hand in an admonitory Hush! and  through the daze of her faculties a small far sound began to make itself heard,  growing louder as she waited, then becoming faint again, then altogether  ceasing only to renew itself once more, till it resolved into an approaching  step, faltering in its course, but coming ever nearer and nearer.</p>
  <p>"She's  safe! She's not hurt!" sprang from Florence's lips in inexpressible relief; and  expecting Mr. Van Broecklyn to show an equal joy, she turned towards him, with  the cheerful cry,</p>
  <p>"Now  if she has been so fortunate as to that missing page, we shall all be repaid  for our fright."</p>
  <p>A  movement on his part, a shifting of position which brought him finally to his  feet, but he gave no other proof of having heard her, nor did his countenance  mirror her relief. "It is as if he dreaded, instead of hailed, her return," was  Florence's inward comment as she watched him involuntarily recoil at each fresh  token of Violet's advance.</p>
  <p>Yet  because this seemed so very unnatural, she persisted in her efforts to lighten  the situation, and when he made no attempt to encourage Violet in her approach,  she herself stooped and called out a cheerful welcome which must have rung  sweetly in the poor little detective's ears.</p>
  <p>A  sorry sight was Violet, when, helped by Florence, she finally crawled into view  through the narrow opening and stood once again on the cellar floor. Pale,  trembling, and soiled with the dust of years, she presented a helpless figure  enough, till the joy in Florence's face recalled some of her spirit, and,  glancing down at her hand in which a sheet of paper was visible, she asked for  Mr. Spielhagen.</p>
  <p>"I've  got the formula," she said. "If you will bring him, I will hand it over to him  here."</p>
  <p>Not  a word of her adventure; nor so much as one glance at Mr. Van Broecklyn,  standing far back in the shadows.</p>
  <p>Nor  was she more communicative, when, the formula restored and everything made  right with Mr. Spielhagen, they all came together again in the library for a  final word. "I was frightened by the silence and the darkness, and so cried  out," she explained in answer to their questions. "Any one would have done so who  found himself alone in so musty a place," she added, with an attempt at  lightsomeness which deepened the pallor on Mr. Van Broecklyn's cheek, already  sufficiently noticeable to have been remarked upon by more than one.</p>
  <p>"No  ghosts?" laughed Mr. Cornell, too happy in the return of his hopes to be fully  sensible of the feelings of those about him. "No whispers from impalpable lips  or touches from spectre hands? Nothing to explain the mystery of that room long  shut up that even Mr. Van Broecklyn declares himself ignorant of its secret?"</p>
  <p>"Nothing,"  returned Violet, showing her dimples in full force now.</p>
  <p>"If  Miss Strange had any such experiences&mdash;if she has anything to tell worthy of so  marked a curiosity, she will tell it now," came from the gentleman just alluded  to, in tones so stern and strange that all show of frivolity ceased on the  instant. "Have you anything to tell, Miss Strange?"</p>
  <p>Greatly  startled, she regarded him with widening eyes for a moment, then with a move  towards the door, remarked, with a general look about her:</p>
  <p>"Mr.  Van Broecklyn knows his own house, and doubtless can relate its histories if he  will. I am a busy little body who having finished my work am now ready to  return home, there to wait for the next problem which an indulgent fate may offer  me."</p>
  <p>She  was near the threshold&mdash;she was about to take her leave, when suddenly she felt  two hands fall on her shoulder, and turning, met the eyes of Mr. Van Broecklyn  burning into her own.</p>
  <p>"You  saw!" dropped in an almost inaudible whisper from his lips.</p>
  <p>The  shiver which shook her answered him better than any word.</p>
  <p>With  an exclamation of despair, he withdrew his hands, and facing the others now  standing together in a startled group, he said, as soon as he could recover  some of his self-possession:</p>
  <p>"I  must ask for another hour of your company. I can no longer keep my sorrow to  myself. A dividing line has just been drawn across my life, and I must have the  sympathy of someone who knows my past, or I shall go mad in my self-imposed  solitude. Come back, Miss Strange. You of all others have the prior right to  hear."</p>
  <p align="center"><b>VII</b></p>
  <p>"I  shall have to begin," said he, when they were all seated and ready to listen,  "by giving you some idea, not so much of the family tradition, as of the effect  of this tradition upon all who bore the name of Van Broecklyn. This is not the  only house, even in America, which contains a room shut away from intrusion. In  England there are many. But there is this difference between most of them and  ours. No bars or locks forcibly held shut the door we were forbidden to open.  The command was enough; that and the superstitious fear which such a command,  attended by a long and unquestioning obedience, was likely to engender.</p>
  <p>"I  know no more than you do why some early ancestor laid his ban upon this room. But  from my earliest years I was given to understand that there was one latch in  the house which was never to be lifted; that any fault would be forgiven sooner  than that; that the honour of the whole family stood in the way of  disobedience, and that I was to preserve that honour to my dying day. You will  say that all this is fantastic, and wonder that sane people in these modern  times should subject themselves to such a ridiculous restriction, especially  when no good reason was alleged, and the very source of the tradition from  which it sprung forgotten. You are right; but if you look long into human  nature, you will see that the bonds which hold the firmest are not material  ones&mdash;that an idea will make a man and mould a character&mdash;that it lies at the  source of all heroisms and is to be courted or feared as the case may be.</p>
  <p>"For  me it possessed a power proportionate to my loneliness. I don't think there was  ever a more lonely child. My father and mother were so unhappy in each other's  companionship that one or other of them was almost always away. But I saw  little of either even when they were at home. The constraint in their attitude  towards each other affected their conduct towards me. I have asked myself more  than once if either of them had any real affection for me. To my father I spoke  of her; to her of him; and never pleasurably. This I am forced to say, or you  cannot understand my story. Would to God I could tell another tale! Would to  God I had such memories as other men have of a father's clasp, a mother's  kiss&mdash;but no! my grief, already profound, might have become abysmal. Perhaps it  is best as it is; only, I might have been a different child, and made for  myself a different fate&mdash;who knows.</p>
  <p>"As  it was, I was thrown almost entirely upon my own resources for any amusement.  This led me to a discovery I made one day. In a far part of the cellar behind  some heavy casks, I found a little door. It was so low&mdash;so exactly fitted to my  small body, that I had the greatest desire to enter it. But I could not get around  the casks. At last an expedient occurred to me. We had an old servant who came  nearer loving me than any one else. One day when I chanced to be alone in the  cellar, I took out my ball and began throwing it about. Finally it landed  behind the casks, and I ran with a beseeching cry to Michael, to move them.</p>
  <p>"It  was a task requiring no little strength and address, but he managed, after a  few herculean efforts, to shift them aside and I saw with delight, my way  opened to that mysterious little door. But I did not approach it then; some  instinct deterred me. But when the opportunity came for me to venture there  alone, I did so, in the most adventurous spirit, and began my operations by  sliding behind the casks and testing the handle of the little door. It turned,  and after a pull or two the door yielded. With my heart in my mouth, I stooped  and peered in. I could see nothing&mdash;a black hole and nothing more. This caused  me a moment's hesitation. I was afraid of the dark&mdash;had always been. But  curiosity and the spirit of adventure triumphed. Saying to myself that I was  Robinson Crusoe exploring the cave, I crawled in, only to find that I had  gained nothing. It was as dark inside as it had looked to be from without.</p>
  <p>"There  was no fun in this, so I crawled back, and when I tried the experiment again,  it was with a bit of candle in my hand, and a surreptitious match or two. What  I saw, when with a very trembling little hand I had lighted one of the matches,  would have been disappointing to most boys, but not to me. The litter and old  boards I saw in odd corners about me were full of possibilities, while in the  dimness beyond I seemed to perceive a sort of staircase which might lead&mdash;I do  not think I made any attempt to answer that question even in my own mind, but  when, after some hesitation and a sense of great daring, I finally crept up  those steps, I remember very well my sensation at finding myself in front of a  narrow closed door. It suggested too vividly the one in Grandfather's little  room&mdash;the door in the wainscot which we were never to open. I had my first real  trembling fit here, and at once fascinated and repelled by this obstruction I  stumbled and lost my candle, which, going out in the fall, left me in total  darkness and a very frightened state of mind. For my imagination which had been  greatly stirred by my own vague thoughts of the forbidden room, immediately  began to people the space about me with ghoulish figures. How should I escape  them, how ever reach my own little room again undetected and in safety?</p>
  <p>"But  these terrors, deep as they were, were nothing to the real fright which seized  me when, the darkness finally braved, and the way found back into the bright,  wide-open halls of the house, I became conscious of having dropped something  besides the candle. My match-box was gone&mdash;not my match-box, but my  grandfather's which I had found lying on his table and carried off on this  adventure, in all the confidence of irresponsible youth. To make use of it for  a little while, trusting to his not missing it in the confusion I had noticed  about the house that morning, was one thing; to lose it was another. It was no  common box. Made of gold and cherished for some special reason well known to  himself, I had often hear him say that some day I would appreciate its value, and  be glad to own it. And I had left it in that hole and at any minute he might  miss it&mdash;possibly ask for it! The day was one of torment. My mother was away or  shut up in her room. My father&mdash;I don't know just what thoughts I had about him.  He was not to be seen either, and the servants cast strange looks at me when I  spoke his name. But I little realized the blow which had just fallen upon the  house in his definite departure, and only thought of my own trouble, and of how  I should meet my grandfather's eye when the hour came for him to draw me to his  knee for his usual good-night.</p>
  <p>"That  I was spared this ordeal for the first time this very night first comforted me,  then added to my distress. He had discovered his loss and was angry. On the  morrow he would ask me for the box and I would have to lie, for never could I  find the courage to tell him where I had been. Such an act of presumption he  would never forgive, or so I thought as I lay and shivered in my little bed.  That his coldness, his neglect, sprang from the discovery just made that my  mother as well as my father had just fled the house forever was as little known  to me as the morning calamity. I had been given my usual tendance and was  tucked safely into bed; but the gloom, the silence which presently settled upon  the house had a very different explanation in my mind from the real one. My sin  (for such it loomed large in my mind by this time) coloured the whole situation  and accounted for every event.</p>
  <p>"At  what hour I slipped from my bed on to the cold floor, I shall never know. To me  it seemed to be in the dead of night; but I doubt if it were more than ten. So  slowly creep away the moments to a wakeful child. I had made a great resolve.  Awful as the prospect seemed to me,&mdash;frightened as I was by the very thought,&mdash;I  had determined in my small mind to go down into the cellar, and into that  midnight hole again, in search of the lost box. I would take a candle and  matches, this time from my own mantel-shelf, and if everyone was asleep, as  appeared from the deathly quiet of the house, I would be able to go and come  without anybody ever being the wiser.</p>
  <p>"Dressing  in the dark, I found my matches and my candle and, putting them in one of my  pockets, softly opened my door and looked out. Nobody was stirring; every light  was out except a solitary one in the lower hall. That this still burned  conveyed no meaning to my mind. How could I know that the house was so still  and the rooms dark because everyone was out searching for some clue to my  mother's flight? If I had looked at the clock&mdash;but I did not; I was too intent  upon my errand, too filled with the fever of my desperate undertaking, to be  affected by anything not bearing directly upon it.</p>
  <p>"Of  the terror caused by my own shadow on the wall as I made the turn in the hall  below, I have as keen a recollection today as though it happened yesterday. But  that did not deter me; nothing deterred me, till safe in the cellar I crouched  down behind the casks to get my breath again before entering the hole beyond.</p>
  <p>"I  had made some noise in feeling my way around these casks, and I trembled lest  these sounds had been heard upstairs! But this fear soon gave place to one far  greater. Other sounds were making themselves heard. A din of small skurrying  feet above, below, on every side of me! Rats! rats in the wall! rats on the  cellar bottom! How I ever stirred from the spot I do not know, but when I did  stir, it was to go forward, and enter the uncanny hole.</p>
  <p>"I  had intended to light my candle when I got inside; but for some reason I went  stumbling along in the dark, following the wall till I got to the steps where I  had dropped the box. Here a light was necessary, but my hand did not go to my  pocket. I thought it better to climb the steps first, and softly one foot found  the tread and then another. I had only three more to climb and then my right  hand, now feeling its way along the wall, would be free to strike a match. I  climbed the three steps and was steadying myself against the door for a final  plunge, when something happened&mdash;something so strange, so unexpected, and so  incredible that I wonder I did not shriek aloud in my terror. The door was  moving under my hand. It was slowly opening inward. I could feel the chill made  by the widening crack. Moment by moment this chill increased; the gap was  growing&mdash;a presence was there&mdash;a presence before which I sank in a small heap  upon the landing. Would it advance? Had it feet&mdash;hands? Was it a presence which  could be felt?</p>
  <p>"Whatever  it was, it made no attempt to pass, and presently I lifted my head only to  quake anew at the sound of a voice&mdash;a human voice&mdash;my mother's voice&mdash;so near me  that by putting out my arms I might have touched her.</p>
  <p>"She  was speaking to my father. I knew from the tone. She was saying words which,  little understood as they were, made such a havoc in my youthful mind that I  have never forgotten the effect.</p>
  <p>"'I  have come!' she said. 'They think I have fled the house and are looking far and  wide for me. We shall not be disturbed. Who would think of looking here for  either you or me.'</p>
  <p>"Here!  The word sank like a plummet in my breast. I had known for some few minutes  that I was on the threshold of the forbidden room; but they were in it. I can  scarcely make you understand the tumult which this awoke in my brain. Somehow,  I had never thought that any such braving of the house's law would be possible.</p>
  <p>"I  heard my father's answer, but it conveyed no meaning to me. I also realized  that he spoke from a distance,&mdash;that he was at one end of the room while we were  at the other. I was presently to have this idea confirmed, for while I was  striving with all my might and main to subdue my very heart-throbs so that she  would not hear me or suspect my presence, the darkness&mdash;I should rather say the  blackness of the place yielded to a flash of lightning&mdash;heat lightning, all  glare and no sound&mdash;and I caught an instantaneous vision of my father's figure  standing with gleaming things about him, which affected me at the moment as  supernatural, but which, in later years, I decided to have been weapons hanging  on a wall.</p>
  <p>"She  saw him too, for she gave a quick laugh and said they would not need any  candles; and then, there was another flash and I saw something in his hand and  something in hers, and though I did not yet understand, I felt myself turning  deathly sick and gave a choking gasp which was lost in the rush she made into  the centre of the room, and the keenness of her swift low cry.</p>
  <p>"'Garde-toi!  for only one of us will ever leave this room alive!'</p>
  <p>"A  duel! a duel to the death between this husband and wife&mdash;this father and  mother&mdash;in this hole of dead tragedies and within the sight and hearing of their  child! Has Satan ever devised a scheme more hideous for ruining the life of an  eleven-year-old boy!</p>
  <p>"Not  that I took it all in at once. I was too innocent and much too dazed to  comprehend such hatred, much less the passions which engender it. I only knew  that something horrible&mdash;something beyond the conception of my childish mind&mdash;was  going to take place in the darkness before me; and the terror of it made me  speechless; would to God it had made me deaf and blind and dead!</p>
  <p>"She  had dashed from her corner and he had slid away from his, as the next fantastic  glare which lit up the room showed me. It also showed the weapons in their  hands, and for a moment I felt reassured when I saw that these were swords, for  I had seen them before with foils in their hands practising for exercise, as  they said, in the great garret. But the swords had buttons on them, and this  time the tips were sharp and shone in the keen light.</p>
  <p>"An  exclamation from her and a growl of rage from him were followed by movements I  could scarcely hear, but which were terrifying from their very quiet. Then the  sound of a clash. The swords had crossed.</p>
  <p>"Had  the lightning flashed forth then, the end of one of them might have occurred.  But the darkness remained undisturbed, and when the glare relit the great room  again, they were already far apart. This called out a word from him; the one  sentence he spoke&mdash;I can never forget it:</p>
  <p>"'Rhoda,  there is blood on your sleeve; I have wounded you. Shall we call it off and  fly, as the poor creatures in there think we have, to the opposite ends of the  earth?'</p>
  <p>"I  almost spoke; I almost added my childish plea to his for them to stop&mdash;to  remember me and stop. But not a muscle in my throat responded to my agonized  effort. Her cold, clear 'No!' fell before my tongue was loosed or my heart  freed from the ponderous weight crushing it.</p>
  <p>"'I  have vowed and I keep my promises,' she went on in a tone quite strange to me.  'What would either's life be worth with the other alive and happy in this  world.'</p>
  <p>"He  made no answer; and those subtle movements&mdash;shadows of movements I might almost  call them&mdash;recommenced. Then there came a sudden cry, shrill and poignant&mdash;had  Grandfather been in his room he would surely have heard it&mdash;and the flash coming  almost simultaneously with its utterance, I saw what has haunted my sleep from  that day to this, my father pinned against the wall, sword still in hand, and  before him my mother, fiercely triumphant, her staring eyes fixed on his and&mdash;</p>
  <p>"Nature  could bear no more; the band loosened from my throat; the oppression lifted  from my breast long enough for me to give one wild wail and she turned, saw  (heaven sent its flashes quickly at this moment) and recognizing my childish  form, all the horror of her deed (or so I have fondly hoped) rose within her,  and she gave a start and fell full upon the point upturned to receive her.</p>
  <p>"A  groan; then a gasping sigh from him, and silence settled upon the room and upon  my heart, and so far as I knew upon the whole created world.</p>
  <p>"That  is my story, friends. Do you wonder that I have never been or lived like other  men?"</p>
  <p>After  a few moments of sympathetic silence, Mr. Van Broecklyn went on, to say:</p>
  <p>"I  don't think I ever had a moment's doubt that my parents both lay dead on the  floor of that great room. When I came to myself&mdash;which may have been soon, and  may not have been for a long while&mdash;the lightning had ceased to flash, leaving  the darkness stretching like a blank pall between me and that spot in which  were concentrated all the terrors of which my imagination was capable. I dared  not enter it. I dared not take one step that way. My instinct was to fly and  hide my trembling body again in my own bed; and associated with this, in fact  dominating it and making me old before my time, was another&mdash;never to tell;  never to let any one, least of all my grandfather&mdash;know what that forbidden room  now contained. I felt in an irresistible sort of way that my father's and  mother's honour was at stake. Besides, terror held me back; I felt that I  should die if I spoke. Childhood has such terrors and such heroisms. Silence  often covers in such, abysses of thought and feeling which astonish us in later  years. There is no suffering like a child's, terrified by a secret which it  dare not for some reason disclose.</p>
  <p>"Events  aided me. When, in desperation to see once more the light and all the things  which linked me to life&mdash;my little bed, the toys on the window-sill, my squirrel  in its cage&mdash;I forced myself to retraverse the empty house, expecting at every  turn to hear my father's voice or come upon the image of my mother&mdash;yes, such  was the confusion of my mind, though I knew well enough even then that they  were dead and that I should never hear the one or see the other. I was so  benumbed with the cold in my half-dressed condition, that I woke in a fever  next morning after a terrible dream which forced from my lips the cry of  'Mother! Mother!'&mdash;only that.</p>
  <p>"I  was cautious even in delirium. This delirium and my flushed cheeks and shining  eyes led them to be very careful of me. I was told that my mother was away from  home; and when after two days of search they were quite sure that all effort to  find either her or my father were likely to prove fruitless, that she had gone  to Europe where we would follow her as soon as I was well. This promise,  offering as it did, a prospect of immediate release from the terrors which were  consuming me, had an extraordinary effect upon me. I got up out of my bed  saying that I was well now and ready to start on the instant. The doctor,  finding my pulse equable, and my whole condition wonder fully improved, and  attributing it, as was natural, to my hope of soon joining my mother, advised  my whim to be humoured and this hope kept active till travel and intercourse  with children should give me strength and prepare me for the bitter truth  ultimately awaiting me. They listened to him and in twenty-four hours our  preparations were made. We saw the house closed&mdash;with what emotions surging in  one small breast, I leave you to imagine&mdash;and then started on our long tour. For  five years we wandered over the continent of Europe, my grandfather finding  distraction, as well as myself, in foreign scenes and associations.</p>
  <p>"But  return was inevitable. What I suffered on reentering this house, God and my  sleepless pillow alone know. Had any discovery been made in our absence; or  would it be made now that renovation and repairs of all kinds were necessary?  Time finally answered me. My secret was safe and likely to continue so, and  this fact once settled, life became endurable, if not cheerful. Since then I  have spent only two nights out of this house, and they were unavoidable. When  my grandfather died I had the wainscot door cemented in. It was done from this  side and the cement painted to match the wood. No one opened the door nor have  I ever crossed its threshold. Sometimes I think I have been foolish; and  sometimes I know that I have been very wise. My reason has stood firm; how do I  know that it would have done so if I had subjected myself to the possible  discovery that one or both of them might have been saved if I had disclosed  instead of concealed my adventure."</p>
  <p>A  pause during which white horror had shone on every face; then with a final  glance at Violet, he said:</p>
  <p>"What  sequel do you see to this story, Miss Strange? I can tell the past, I leave you  to picture the future."</p>
  <p>Rising,  she let her eye travel from face to face till it rested on the one awaiting it,  when she answered dreamily:</p>
  <p>"If  some morning in the news column there should appear an account of the ancient  and historic home of the Van Broecklyns having burned to the ground in the  night, the whole country would mourn, and the city feel defrauded of one of its  treasures. But there are five persons who would see in it the sequel which you  ask for."</p>
  <p>When  this happened, as it did happen, some few weeks later, the astonishing  discovery was made that no insurance had been put upon this house. Why was it  that after such a loss Mr. Van Broecklyn seemed to renew his youth? It was a  constant source of comment among his friends.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>End Of  Problem VIII</b></p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Problem IX <br>
    Violet's Own</b></h2>
  <p>"It has been too much for  you?"</p>
  <p>"I  am afraid so."</p>
  <p>It  was Roger Upjohn who had asked the question; it was Violet who answered. They  had withdrawn from a crowd of dancers to a balcony, half-shaded, half open to  the moon,&mdash;a balcony made, it would seem, for just such stolen interviews  between waltzes.</p>
  <p>Now,  as it happened, Roger's face was in the shadow, but Violet's in the full light.  Very sweet it looked, very ethereal, but also a little wan. He noticed this and  impetuously cried:</p>
  <p>"You  are pale; and your hand! see, how it trembles!"</p>
  <p>Slowly  withdrawing it from the rail where it had rested, she sent one quick glance his  way and, in a low voice, said:</p>
  <p>"I  have not slept since that night."</p>
  <p>"Four  days!" he murmured. Then, after a moment of silence, "You bore yourself so  bravely at the time, I thought, or rather, I hoped, that success had made you  forget the horror. I could not have slept myself, if I had known&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"It  is part of the price I pay," she broke in gently. "All good things have to be  paid for. But I see&mdash;I realize that you do not consider what I am doing good.  Though it helps other people&mdash;has helped you&mdash;you wonder why, with all the  advantages I possess, I should meddle with matters so repugnant to a woman's  natural instincts."</p>
  <p>Yes,  he wondered. That was evident from his silence. Seeing her as she stood there,  so quaintly pretty, so feminine in look and manner&mdash;in short, such a flower&mdash;it  was but natural that he should marvel at the incongruity she had mentioned.</p>
  <p>"It  has a strange, odd look," she admitted, after a moment of troubled hesitation.  "The most considerate person cannot but regard it as a display of egotism or of  a most mercenary spirit. The cheque you sent me for what I was enabled to do  for you in Massachusetts (the only one I have ever received which I have been  tempted to refuse) shows to what extent you rated my help and my&mdash;my  expectations. Had I been a poor girl struggling for subsistence, this generosity  would have warmed my heart as a token of your desire to cut that struggle  short. But taken with your knowledge of my home and its luxuries, it has often  made me wonder what you thought."</p>
  <p>"Shall  I tell you?"</p>
  <p>He  had stepped forward at this question and his countenance, hitherto concealed,  became visible in the moonlight. She no longer recognized it. Transformed by  feeling, it shone down upon her, instinct with all that is finest and best in  masculine nature. Was she ready for this revelation of what she had  nevertheless dreamed of for many more nights than four? She did not know, and  instinctively drew herself back till it was she who now stood in the  semi-obscurity made by the drooping vines. From this retreat, she faltered  forth a very tremulous No, which in another moment was disavowed by a Yes so  faint it was little more than a murmur, followed by a still fainter, Tell me.</p>
  <p>But  he did not seem in any haste to obey, sweetly as her low-toned injunction must  have sounded in his ears. On the contrary, he hesitated to speak, growing paler  every minute as he sought to catch a glimpse of her downcast face so  tantalizingly hidden from him. Did she recognize the nature of the feelings  which held him back, or was she simply gathering up sufficient courage to plead  her own cause? Whatever her reason, it was she, not he, who presently spoke  saying as if no time had elapsed:</p>
  <p>"But  first, I feel obliged to admit that it was money I wanted, that I had to have.  Not for myself. I lack nothing and could have more if I wished. Father has  never limited his generosity in any matter affecting myself, but&mdash;" She drew a  deep breath and, coming out of the shadow, lifted a face to him so changed from  its usual expression as to make him start. "I have a cause at heart&mdash;one which  should appeal to my father and does not; and for that purpose I have sacrificed  myself, in many ways, though&mdash;though I have not disliked my work up to this last  attempt. Not really. I want to be honest and so must admit that much. I have  even gloried (quietly and all by myself, of course) over the solution of a  mystery which no one else seemed able to penetrate. I am made that way. I have  known it ever since&mdash;but that is a story all by itself. Some day I may tell it  to you, but not now."</p>
  <p>"No,  not now." The emphasis sent the colour into her cheek but did not relieve his  pallor. "Miss Strange, I have always felt, even in my worst days, that the man  who for selfish ends brought a woman under the shadow of his own unhappy  reputation was a man to be despised. And I think so still, and yet&mdash;and  yet&mdash;nothing in the world but your own word or look can hold me back now from  telling you that I love you&mdash;love you notwithstanding my unworthy past, my  scarring memories, my all but blasted hopes. I do not expect any response; you are  young; you are beautiful; you are gifted with every grace; but to speak,&mdash;to say  over and over again, 'I love you, I love you!' eases my heart and makes my  future more endurable. Oh, do not look at me like that unless&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>
  <p>But  the bright head did not fall, nor the tender gaze falter; and driven out of  himself, Roger Upjohn was about to step passionately forward, when, seized by  fresh compunction, he hoarsely cried:</p>
  <p>"It  is not right. The balance dips too much my way. You bring me everything. I can  give you nothing but what you already possess abundance&mdash;love, and money.  Besides, your father&mdash;"</p>
  <p>She  interrupted him with a glance at once arch and earnest.</p>
  <p>"I  had a talk with Father this morning. He came to my room, and&mdash;and it was very  near being serious. Someone had told him I was doing things on the sly which he  had better look into; and of course he asked questions and&mdash;and I answered them.  He wasn't pleased&mdash;in fact he was very displeased,&mdash;I don't think we can blame  him for that&mdash;but we had no open break for I love him dearly, for all my  opposing ways, and he saw that, and it helped, though he did say after I had  given my promise to stop where I was and never to take up such work again,  that&mdash;" here she stole a shy look at the face bent so eagerly towards her&mdash;"that  I had lost my social status and need never hope now for the attentions  of&mdash;of&mdash;well, of such men as he admires and puts faith in. So you see," her  dimples all showing, "that I am not such a very good match for an Upjohn of  Massachusetts, even if he has a reputation to recover and an honourable name to  achieve. The scale hangs more evenly than you think."</p>
  <p>"Violet!"</p>
  <p>A  mutual look, a moment of perfect silence, then a low whisper, airy as the  breath of flowers rising from the garden below: "I have never known what  happiness was till this moment. If you will take me with my story untold&mdash;"</p>
  <p>"Take  you! take you!" The man's whole yearning heart, the loss and bitterness of  years, the hope and promise of the future, all spoke in that low,  half-smothered exclamation. Violet's blushes faded under its fervency, and only  her spirit spoke, as leaning towards him, she laid her two hands in his, and  said with all a woman's earnestness:</p>
  <p>"I  do not forget little Roger, or the father who I hope may have many more days  before him in which to bid good-night to the sea. Such union as ours must be  hallowed, because we have so many persons to make happy besides ourselves."</p>
  <p>The  evening before their marriage, Violet put a dozen folded sheets of closely  written paper in his hand. They contained her story; let us read it with him.</p>
  <p>DEAR  ROGER,&mdash;</p>
  <p>I  could not have been more than seven years old, when one night I woke up  shivering, at the sound of angry voices. A conversation which no child should  ever have heard, was going on in the room where I lay. My father was talking to  my sister&mdash;perhaps, you do not know that I have a sister; few of my personal  friends do,&mdash;and the terror she evinced I could well understand but not his  words nor the real cause of his displeasure.</p>
  <p>There  are times even yet when the picture, forced upon my infantile consciousness at  that moment of first awakening, comes back to me with all its original  vividness. There was no light in the room save such as the moon made; but that  was enough to reveal the passion burningly alive in either face, as, bending  towards each other, she in supplication and he in a tempest of wrath which knew  no bounds, he uttered and she listened to what I now know to have been a  terrible arraignment.</p>
  <p>I  may have an interesting countenance; you have told me so sometimes; but she&mdash;she  was beautiful. My elder by ten years, she had stood in my mother's stead to me  for almost as long as I could remember, and as I saw her lovely features  contorted with pain and her hands extended in a desperate plea to one who had  never shown me anything but love, my throat closed sharply and I could not cry  out though I wanted to, nor move head or foot though I longed with all my heart  to bury myself in the pillows.</p>
  <p>For  the words I heard were terrifying, little as I comprehended their full purport.  He had surprised her talking from her window to someone down below, and after  saying cruel things about that, he shouted out: "You have disgraced me, you  have disgraced yourself, you have disgraced your brother and your little sister.  Was it not enough that you should refuse to marry the good man I had picked out  for you, that you should stoop to this low-down scoundrel&mdash;this&mdash;" I did not hear  what else he called him, I was wondering so to whom she had been stooping; I  had never seen her stoop except to tie my little shoes.</p>
  <p>But  when she cried out as she did after an interval, "I love him! I love him!" then  I listened again, for she spoke as though she were in dreadful pain, and I did  not know that loving made one ill and unhappy. "And I am going to marry him," I  heard her add, standing up, as she said it, very straight and tall.</p>
  <p>Marry!  I knew what that meant. A long aisle in a church; women in white and big music  in the air behind. I had been flower-girl at a wedding once and had not forgotten.  We had had ice cream and cake and&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  my childish thoughts stopped short at the answer she received and all the words  which followed&mdash;words which burned their way into my infantile brain and left  scorched places in my memory which will never be eradicated. He spoke  them&mdash;spoke them all; she never answered again after that once, and when he was  gone did not move for a long time and when she did it was to lie down, stiff  and straight, just as she had stood, on her bed alongside mine.</p>
  <p>I  was frightened; so frightened, my little brass bed rattled under me. I wonder  she did not hear it. But she heard nothing; and after awhile she was so still I  fell asleep. But I woke again. Something hot had fallen on my cheek. I put up  my hand to brush it away and did not know even when I felt my fingers wet that  it was a tear from my sister-mother's eye.</p>
  <p>For  she was kneeling then; kneeling close beside me and her arm was over my small  body; and the bed was shaking again but not this time with my tremors only. And  I was sorry and cried too until I dropped off to sleep again with her arm still  passionately embracing me.</p>
  <p>In  the morning, she was gone.</p>
  <p>It  must have been that very afternoon that Father came in where Arthur and I were  trying to play,&mdash;trying, but not quite succeeding, for I had been telling  Arthur, for whom I had a great respect in those days, what had happened the  night before, and we had been wondering in our childish way if there would be a  wedding after all, and a church full of people, and flowers, and kissing, and  lots of good things to eat, and Arthur had said No, it was too expensive; that  that was why Father was so angry; and comforted by the assertion, I was taking  up my doll again, when the door opened and Father stepped in.</p>
  <p>It  was a great event&mdash;any visit from him to the nursery&mdash;and we both dropped our  toys and stood staring, not knowing whether he was going to be nice and kind as  he sometimes was, or scold us as I had heard him scold our beautiful sister.</p>
  <p>Arthur  showed at once what he thought, for without the least hesitation he took the  one step which placed him in front of me, where he stood waiting with his two  little fists hanging straight at his sides but manfully clenched in full  readiness for attack. That this display of pigmy chivalry was not quite without  its warrant is evident to me now, for Father did not look like himself or act  like himself any more than he had the night before.</p>
  <p>However,  we had no cause for fear. Having no suspicion of my having been awake during  his terrible interview with Theresa, he saw only two lonely and forsaken  children, interrupted in their play.</p>
  <p>Can  I remember what he said to us? Not exactly, though Arthur and I often went over  it choked whispers in some secret nook of the dreary old house; but his  meaning&mdash;that we took in well enough. Theresa had left us. She would never come  back. We were not to look out of the window for her, or run to the door when  the bell rang. Our mother had left us too, a long time ago, and she lay in the  cemetery where we sometimes carried flowers. Theresa was not in the cemetery,  but we must think of her as there; though not as if she had any need of  flowers. Having said this, he looked at us quietly for a minute. Arthur was  trying very hard not to cry, but I was sobbing like the lost child I was, with  my cheek against the floor where I had thrown myself when he said that awful  thing about the cemetery. She there! my sister-mother there! I think he felt a  little sorry for me; for he half stooped as if to lift me up. But he  straightened again and said very sternly:</p>
  <p>"Now,  children, listen to me. When God takes people to heaven and leaves us only  their cold, dead bodies we carry flowers to their graves and talk about them  some if not very much. But when people die because they love dark ways better  than light, then we do not remember them with gifts and we do not talk about  them. Your sister's name has been spoken for the last time in this house. You,  Arthur, are old enough to know what I mean when I say that I will never listen  to another word about her from either you or Violet as long as you and I live.  She is gone and nothing that is mine shall she ever touch again.</p>
  <p>"You  hear me, Arthur; you hear me, Violet. Heed me, or you go too."</p>
  <p>His  aspect was terrible, so was his purpose; much more terrible than we realized at  the time with our limited understanding and experience. Later, we came to know  the full meaning of this black drop which had been infused into our lives. When  we saw every picture of her destroyed which had been in the house; her name cut  out from the leaves of books; the little tokens she had given us  surreptitiously taken away, till not a vestige of her once beloved presence  remained, we began to realize that we had indeed lost her.</p>
  <p>But  children as young as we were then do not long retain the poignancy of their  first griefs. Gradually my memories of that awful night ceased to disturb my  dreams and I was sixteen before they were again recalled to me with any  vividness, and then it was by accident. I had been strolling through a picture  gallery and had stopped short to study more particularly one which had  especially taken my fancy. There were two ladies sitting on a bench behind me  and one of them was evidently very deaf, for their talk was loud, though I am  sure they did not mean for me to hear, for they were discussing my family. That  is, one of them had said:</p>
  <p>"That's  Violet Strange. She will never be the beauty her sister was; but perhaps that's  not to be deplored. Theresa made a great mess of it."</p>
  <p>"That's  true. I hear that she and the Signor have been seen lately here in town. In  poverty, of course. He hadn't even as much go in him as the ordinary  singing-master."</p>
  <p>I  suppose I should have hurried away, and left this barbed arrow to rankle where  it fell. But I could not. I had never learned a word of Theresa's fate and that  word poverty, proving that she was alive and suffering, held me to my place to  hear what more they might say of her who for years had been for me an  indistinct figure bathed in cruel moonlight.</p>
  <p>"I  have never approved of Peter Strange's conduct at that time," one of the voices  now went on. "He didn't handle her right. She had a lovely disposition and  would have listened to him had he been more gentle with her. But it isn't in  him. I hope this one&mdash;"</p>
  <p>I  didn't hear the end of that. I had no interest in anything they might say about  myself. It was of her I wanted to hear, of her. Weren't they going to say  anything more about my poor sister? Yes; it was a topic which interested both  and presently I heard:</p>
  <p>"He'll  never do anything for her, no matter what happens; I've heard him say so. And  Laura has vowed the same." (Laura is our aunt.) "Besides, Theresa has a pride  of her own quite equal to her father's. She wouldn't take anything from him  now. She'd rather struggle on. I'm told&mdash;I don't know how true it is&mdash;that she's  working in a department store; one of the Sixth Avenue ones. Oh, there's Mrs.  Vandegraff! Don't you want to speak to her?"</p>
  <p>They  moved off, leaving me still gazing with unseeing eyes at the picture before  which I stood planted, and saying over and over in monotonous iteration, "One  of the department stores in Sixth Avenue! One of the department stores in Sixth  Avenue!"</p>
  <p>Which  department store?</p>
  <p>I  meant to find out.</p>
  <p>I  do not know whether up till then I had had the least consciousness of  possessing what is called the detective instinct. But, at the prospect of this  quest, so much like that of the proverbial needle in a haystack, as I did not  even know my sister's married name and something within me forbade my asking  it, I experienced an odd sense of elation followed by a certainty of success  which in five minutes changed me from an irresponsible girl to a woman with a  deliberate purpose in life.</p>
  <p>I  am not going to write down here all the details of that search. Some day I may  relate them to you, but not now. I looked first for a beautiful woman, for the  straight, slim, and exquisite creature I remembered. I did not find her. Then I  tried another course. Her figure might have changed in the ten years which had  elapsed; so might her expression. I would look for a woman with beautiful dark  eyes; time could not have altered them. I had forgotten the effect of constant  weeping. And I saw many eyes, but not hers; not the ones I had seen smiling  upon me as I lay in my crib before the days I was lifted to the dignity of the  little brass bed. So I gave that up too and listened to the inner voice which  said, "You must wait for her to recognize you. You can never hope to recognize  her." And it was by following this plan that I found her. I had arranged to  have my name spoken aloud at every counter where I bargained; and oh, the  bargains I sought, and the garments I had tried on! But I made little progress  until one day, after my name had been uttered a little louder than usual I saw  a woman turn from rearranging gowns on a hanger, and give me one look.</p>
  <p>I  uttered a low cry and sprang impetuously, forward. Instantly she turned her  back and went on hanging, or trying to hang up, gowns on the rack before her.  Had I been mistaken? She was not the sister of my dreams, but there was  something fine in her outline; something distinguished in the way she carried  her head which&mdash;</p>
  <p>Next  minute my last doubt fled! She had fallen her length on the floor and lay with  her face buried in her hands in a dead faint.</p>
  <p>Oh,  Roger, Roger, Roger! I had that dear head on my breast in a moment. I talked to  her, I whispered prayers in her unconscious ear. I did everything I should not  have done till they all thought me demented. When she came to, as she did under  other ministrations than mine, I was for carrying her off in my limousine. But  she shook her head with a gesture of such disapproval, that I realized I could  not do that. The limousine was my father's, and nothing of his was ever to be  used for her again. I would call a cab; but she told me that she had not the  money to pay for it and she would not take mine. Carfare she had; five cents  would take her home. I need not worry.</p>
  <p>She  smiled as she said this and for an instant I saw my dream-sister again in this  weary half-disheartened woman. But the smile was a fleeting one, for this was  to be her last day in the store; she had no talent as a saleswoman and was  merely working out her week.</p>
  <p>I  felt my heart sink heavily at this, for the evidences of poverty were plainly  to be seen in her clothes and the thinness of her face and figure. How could I  help? What could I do? I took her to a restaurant for food and talk, and before  she would order, she looked into her purse, with the result that we had only a  little toast and tea. It was all she could afford and I, with a hundred dollars  in bills at that moment in my bag, could not offer her anything more though she  was needing nourishment and dishes piled with savoury meats were going by us  every moment.</p>
  <p>I  think, if she had let me, I would have dared my father's displeasure and been  disobedient to his wishes by giving her one wholesome meal. But she was as  resolute of mind as he, and, as she said afterwards, had chosen her course in  life and must abide by it. My love she would accept. It took nothing from  Father and gave her what her heart was pining for&mdash;had pined for for years. But  nothing more&mdash;not another thing more. She would not even let me go home with  her; and I knew why when her eyes fell at the searching look I gave her. Something  would turn up, and when her husband's health was better and she had found  another position she would send me her address and then I could come and see  her. As we walked out of the restaurant we ran against a gentleman I knew. He  stopped me for a passing word and in that minute she disappeared. I did not try  to follow her. I could get her street and number from the store where she had  worked.</p>
  <p>But  when I had done this and embraced the first opportunity which offered to visit  her, I found that she had moved away in the interim, leaving everything behind  in payment of her rent, except such small things as she and her husband could  carry. This was discouraging as it left me without any clue by which to follow  them. But I was determined not to yield to her desire for concealment in the  difficult and disheartening task I now saw before me.</p>
  <p>Seeking  advice from the man who has since become my employer, I entered upon this  second search with a quiet resolution which admitted of no defeat. It took me  six months, but I finally found her, and satisfied with knowing where she was,  desisted from rushing in upon her, till I had caught one glimpse of her husband  whom, in the last six months, I had heard described but had never seen. To  understand her, it was perhaps necessary to understand him, and if I could not  hope to do this offhand, I could not fail to get some idea of the man from even  the most casual look.</p>
  <p>He  was, as I soon learned, the fetcher and carrier of the small m&eacute;nage; and the  day came when I met him face to face in the street where they lived. Did he  disappoint me; or did I see something in his appearance to justify her  desertion of her father's home and her present life of poverty? If I say Yes to  the first question, I must also say it to the last. If handsome once, he was  not handsome now; but with a personality such as his, this did not matter. He  had that better thing&mdash;that greatest gift of the gods&mdash;charm. It was in his  bearing, his movement, the regard of his weary eye; more than that it was in  his very nature or it would have vanished long ago under disappointment and  privation.</p>
  <p>But  that was all there was to the man,&mdash;a golden net in which my sister's youthful  fancy had been caught and no doubt held meshed to this very day. I felt less  like blaming her for her folly, after that instant's view of him as we passed  each other in the street. But, as I took time to think, I found myself growing  sorrier and sorrier for her and yet, in a way, gladder and gladder, for the man  was a physical wreck and would soon pass out of her life leaving her to my love  and possibly to our father's forgiveness.</p>
  <p>But  I did not know Theresa. After her husband's death, which occurred very soon,  she let me come to her and we had a long talk. Shall I ever forget it or the  sight of her beauty in that sordid room? For, account for it as you will, the  loveliness which had fled under her sense of complete isolation had slowly  regained its own with the recognition that she still had a place in the heart  of her little sister. Not even the sorrow she felt for the loss of her  suffering husband&mdash;and she did mourn him; this I am glad to say&mdash;could more than  temporarily stay this. Six months of ease and wholesome food would make her&mdash;I  hardly dared to think what. For I knew, without asking her, or she telling me,  that she would accept neither; that she was as determined now, as ever that  nothing which came directly or indirectly from Father should go to the  rebuilding of her life. That she intended to start anew and work her way up to  a place where I should be glad to see her she did say. But nothing more. She  was still the sister-mother, loving, but sufficient to herself, though she had  but ten dollars left in the world, as she showed me with a smile that made her  beautiful as an angel.</p>
  <p>I  can see that shabby little purse yet with its one poor greasy bill;&mdash;a sum to  her but to me the price of a luncheon or a gift of flowers. How I longed, as I  looked at it to tear every jewel from my poor, bedecked body and fling them one  and all into her lap. I had worn them in profusion, though carefully hidden  under my coat, in the hope that she would accept one of them at least, But she  refused all, even such as had been gifts of friends and schoolmates, only  humouring me this far, that she let me hang them for a few minutes about her  neck and in her hair and then pull them all off again. But this one vision of  her in the splendour she was born to comforted me. Henceforth in wearing them  it would be of her and not of myself I should think.</p>
  <p>Well,  I had to leave her and go home to my French and Italian lessons, my  music-masters and all the luxuries of our father's house. Should I ever see her  again? I did not know; she had not promised. I could not go often into the  quarter where she lived, without rousing suspicion; and she had bidden me not  to come again for a month. So I waited, half fearing she would flit again  before the month was up. But she did not. She was still there when&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  I am going too fast. The meeting I was about to mention was a very memorable  one to me, and I must describe it from the beginning. I had ridden in my own  car as near as I dared to the street where she lived; the rest of the way I  went on foot with one of the servants&mdash;a new one&mdash;following close behind me. I  was not exactly afraid, but the actions of some of the people I had encountered  at my former visit warned me to be a little careful for my father's sake if not  for my own. Her room&mdash;she had but one&mdash;was high up in a triangular court it was  no pleasure to enter. But love and loyalty heed nothing but the object sought,  and I was hunting about for the dark doorway which opened upon the staircase  leading to her room when&mdash;and this was the great moment of my life&mdash;a sudden  stream of melody floated down into that noisome court, which from its  clearness, its accuracy, its richness, and its feeling startled me as I had  never before been startled even by the first notes of the world's greatest  singers. What a voice for a place like this! What a voice for any place! Whose  could it be? With a start, I stopped short, in the middle of that court,  heedless of the crowd of pushing, shouting children who at once gathered about  me. I had been struck by an old recollection. My sister used to sing. I  remembered where her piano had stood in the great drawing-room. It had been  carted away during those dreadful weeks and her music all burned; but the  vision of her graceful figure bending over the keyboard was one not to be  forgotten even by a thoughtless child. Could it be&mdash;oh, heaven! if this voice  were hers! Her future was certain; she had but to sing.</p>
  <p>In  a transport of hope I rushed for the dim entrance the children had pointed out  and flew up to her room. As I reached it, I heard a trill as perfect as  Tetrazzini's. The singer was Theresa; there could be no more doubt. Theresa!  exercising a grand voice as only a great artist would or could.</p>
  <p>The  joy of it made me almost faint. I leaned against her door and sobbed. Then when  I thought I could speak quite calmly, I went in.</p>
  <p>Roger,  you must understand me now,&mdash;my desire for money and the means I have taken to  obtain it. My sister had the makings of a prima-donna. Her husband, of whose  ability I had formed so low an estimate, had trained her with consummate skill  and judgment. All she needed was a year with some great maestro in the foreign  atmosphere of art. But this meant money&mdash;not hundreds but thousands, and the one  sure source to which we might rightfully look for any such amount was  effectually closed to us. It is true we had relatives&mdash;an aunt on our mother's  side, and I mentioned her to Theresa. But she would not listen to the  suggestion. She would take nothing from any one whom she would find it hard to  face in case of failure. Love must go with an advance involving so much risk;  love deep enough and strong enough to feel no loss save that of a defeated  hope. In short, to be acceptable, the money must come from me, and as this was  manifestly impossible, she considered the matter closed and began to talk of a  position she had been offered in some choir. I let her talk, listening and not  listening; for the idea had come to me that if in some way I could earn money,  she might be induced to take it. Finally, I asked her. She laughed, letting her  kisses answer me. But I did not laugh. If she had capabilities in one way, I  had them in another.</p>
  <p>I  went home to think.</p>
  <p>Two  weeks later, I began, in a very quiet way to do certain work for the man who  had helped me in my second search for Theresa. The money I have earned has been  immense; since it was troubles of the rich I was given to settle, and I was  almost always successful. Every cent has gone to her. She has been in Europe  for a year and last week she made her debut. You read about it in the papers,  but neither you nor any one else in this country but myself knew that under the  name she chosen to assume, Theresa Strange, the long forgotten beauty, has  recovered that place in the world, to which her love and genius entitle her.</p>
  <p>This  is my story and hers. From now on, you are the third in the secret. Some day,  my father will be the fourth. I think then, a new dawn of love will arise for  us all, which will stay the whitening of his dear head&mdash;for I believe in him  after all. Yesterday when he passed the wall where her picture once hung&mdash;no  other has ever hung there&mdash;I saw him stop and look up, and, Roger, when he  passed me a minute later, there was a tear in his hard eye.</p>
