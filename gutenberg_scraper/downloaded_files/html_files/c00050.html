    Two Little Shoes</b></h2>
  <p>The  morning of August eighteenth, 190&mdash;, was a memorable one to me. For two months I  had had a run of bad luck. During that time I had failed to score in at least  three affairs of unusual importance, and the result was a decided loss in  repute as well as great financial embarrassment. As I had a mother and two  sisters to support and knew but one way to do it, I was in a state of profound  discouragement. This was before I took up the morning papers. After I had  opened and read them, not a man in New York could boast of higher hopes or  greater confidence in his power to rise by one bold stroke from threatened  bankruptcy to immediate independence.</p>
  <p>The  paragraph which had occasioned this amazing change must have passed under the  eyes of many of you. It created a wide-spread excitement at the time and raised  in more than one breast the hope of speedy fortune. It was attached to, or  rather introduced, the most startling feature of the week, and it ran thus:</p>
  <p align="center" class="newspaper"><b>A FORTUNE FOR A CHILD</b></p>
  <p class="newspaper"><i>By  cable from Southampton.</i> </p>
  <p class="newspaper">A  reward of five thousand dollars is offered, by Philo Ocumpaugh, to whoever will  give such information as will lead to the recovery, alive or dead, of his  six-year-old daughter, Gwendolen, missing since the afternoon of August the  16th, from her home in &mdash; on-the-Hudson, New York, U. S. A.</p>
  <p>Fifty  thousand dollars additional and no questions asked if she is restored unharmed  within the week to her mother at Homewood.</p>
  <p>All  communications to be addressed to Samuel Atwater, &mdash; on-the-Hudson.</p>
  <p>A  minute description of the child followed, but this did not interest me, and I  did not linger over it. The child was no stranger to me. I knew her well and  consequently was quite aware of her personal characteristics. It was the great  amount offered for her discovery and restoration which moved me so deeply.  Fifty thousand dollars! A fortune for any man. More than a fortune to me, who  stood in such need of ready money. I was determined to win this extraordinary  sum. I had my reason for hope and, in the light of this unexpectedly munificent  reward, decided to waive all the considerations which had hitherto prevented me  from stirring in the matter.</p>
  <p>There  were other reasons less selfish which gave impetus to my resolve. I had done  business for the Ocumpaughs before and been well treated in the transaction. I  recognized and understood both Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s peculiarities and those of his  admired and devoted wife. As man and woman they were kindly, honorable and  devoted to many more interests than those connected with their own wealth. I  also knew their hearts to be wrapped up in this child,&mdash;the sole offspring of a  long and happy union, and the actual as well as prospective inheritor of more  millions than I shall ever see thousands, unless I am fortunate enough to solve  the mystery now exercising the sympathies of the whole New York public.</p>
  <p>You  have all heard of this child under another name. From her birth she has been  known as the Millionaire Baby, being the direct heir to three fortunes, two of  which she had already received. I saw her first when she was three years old&mdash;a  cherubic little being, lovely to look upon and possessing unusual qualities for  so young a child. Indeed, her picturesque beauty and appealing ways would have  attracted all eyes and won all hearts, even if she had not represented in her  small person the wealth both of the Ocumpaugh and Rathbone families. There was  an individuality about her, combined with sensibilities of no ordinary nature,  which fully accounted for the devoted affection with which she was universally  regarded; and when she suddenly disappeared, it was easy to comprehend, if one  did not share, the thrill of horror which swept from one end of our broad  continent to the other. Those who knew the parents, and those who did not,  suffered an equal pang at the awful thought of this petted innocent lost in the  depths of the great unknown, with only the false caresses of her abductors to  comfort her for the deprivation of all those delights which love and unlimited  means could provide to make a child of her years supremely happy.</p>
  <p>Her  father&mdash;and this was what gave the keen edge of horror to the whole occurrence&mdash;was  in Europe when she disappeared. He had been cabled at once and his answer was  the proffered reward with which I have opened this history. An accompanying  despatch to his distracted wife announced his relinquishment of the project  which had taken him abroad and his immediate return on the next steamer sailing  from Southampton. As this chanced to be the fastest on the line, we had reason  to expect him in six days; meanwhile&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  to complete my personal recapitulations. When the first news of this startling  abduction flashed upon my eyes from the bulletin boards, I looked on the matter  as one of too great magnitude to be dealt with by any but the metropolitan  police; but as time passed and further details of the strange and seemingly  inexplicable affair came to light, I began to feel the stirring of the  detective instinct within me (did I say that I was connected with a private  detective agency of some note in the metropolis?) and a desire, quite apart  from any mere humane interest in the event itself, to locate the intelligence  back of such a desperate crime: an intelligence so keen that, up to the present  moment, if we may trust the published accounts of the affair, not a clue had  been unearthed by which its author could be traced, or the means employed for  carrying off this petted object of a thousand cares.</p>
  <p>To  be sure, there was a theory which eliminated all crime from the occurrence as  well as the intervention of any one in the child&rsquo;s fate: she might have strayed  down to the river and been drowned. But the probabilities were so opposed to  this supposition, that the police had refused to embrace it, although the  mother had accepted it from the first, and up to the present moment, or so it  was stated, had refused to consider any other. As she had some basis for this  conclusion&mdash;I am still quoting the papers, you understand&mdash;I was not disposed to  ignore it in the study I proceeded to make of the situation. The details, as I  ran them over in the hurried trip I now made up the river to &mdash;, were as  follows:</p>
  <p>On  the afternoon of Wednesday, August sixteenth, 190&mdash;, the guests assembled in  Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s white and gold music-room were suddenly thrown into confusion  by the appearance among them of a young girl in a state of great perturbation,  who, running up to the startled hostess, announced that Gwendolen, the petted  darling of the house, was missing from the bungalow where she had been lying  asleep, and could not be found, though a dozen men had been out on search.</p>
  <p>The  wretched mother, who, as it afterward transpired, had not only given the orders  by which the child had been thus removed from the excitement up at the house,  but had actually been herself but a few moments before to see that the little  one was well cared for and happy, seemed struck as by a mortal blow at these  words and, uttering a heart-rending scream, ran out on the lawn. A crowd of  guests rushed after her, and as they followed her flying figure across the lawn  to the small copse in which lay hidden this favored retreat, they could hear,  borne back on the wind, the wild protests of the young nurse, that she had left  the child for a minute only and then to go no farther than the bench running  along the end of the bungalow facing the house; that she had been told she  could sit there and listen to the music, but that she never would have left the  child&rsquo;s side for a minute if she had not supposed she would hear her least  stir&mdash;protests which the mother scarcely seemed to heed, and which were  presently lost in the deep silence which fell on all, as, brought to a stand in  the thick shrubbery surrounding the bungalow, they saw the mother stagger up to  the door, look in and turn toward them with death in her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  river!&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;the river!&rdquo; and heedless of all attempt to stop her,  heedless even of the efforts made by the little one&rsquo;s nurse to draw her  attention to the nearness of a certain opening in the high hedge marking off  the Ocumpaugh grounds on this side, she ran down the bank in the direction of  the railway, but fainted before she had more than cleared the thicket. When  they lifted her up, they all saw the reason for this. She had come upon a  little shoe which she held with frantic clutch against her breast&mdash;her child&rsquo;s  shoe, which, as she afterward acknowledged, she had loosened with her own hand  on the little one&rsquo;s foot.</p>
  <p>Of  course, after this the whole hillside was searched down to the fence which  separated it from the railroad track. But no further trace of the missing child  was found, nor did it appear possible to any one that she could have strayed  away in this direction. For not only was the bank exceedingly steep and the  fence at its base impassable, but a gang of men, working as good fortune would  have it, at such a point on the road below as to render it next to impossible  for her to have crossed the track within a half-mile either way without being  observed, had one and all declared that not one of them had seen her or any  other person descend the slope.</p>
  <p>This,  however, made but little impression on the mother. She would listen to no hints  of abduction, but persisted in her declaration that the river had swallowed her  darling, and would neither rest nor turn her head from its waters till some  half a dozen men about the place had been set systematically to work to drag  the stream.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  the police had been notified and the whole town aroused. The search, which had  been carried on up to this time in a frantic but desultory way, now became  methodical. Nor was it confined to the Ocumpaugh estate. All the roads and  byways within half a mile either way were covered by a most careful  investigation. All the near-by houses were entered, especially those which the  child was most in the habit of frequenting, but no one had seen her, nor could  any trace of her presence be found. At five o&rsquo;clock all hope of her return was  abandoned and, much against Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s wish, who declared that the news  of the child&rsquo;s death would affect her father far less than the dreadful  possibilities of an abduction, the exact facts of the case had been cabled to  Mr. Ocumpaugh.</p>
  <p>The  night and another day passed, bringing but little relief to the situation. Not  an eye had as yet been closed in Homewood, nor had the search ceased for an  instant. Not an inch of the great estate had been overlooked, yet men could  still be seen beating the bushes and peering into all the secluded spots which  once had formed the charm of this delightful place. As on the land, so on the  river. All the waters in the dock had been dragged, yet the work went on, some  said under the very eye of Mrs. Ocumpaugh. But there was no result as yet.</p>
  <p>In  the city the interest was intense. The telegraph at police headquarters had  been clicking incessantly for thirty-six hours under the direction, some said,  of the superintendent himself. Everything which could be done had been done,  but as yet the papers were able to report nothing beyond some vague stories of  a child, with its face very much bound up, having been seen at the heels of a  woman in the Grand Central Station in New York, and hints of a covered wagon, with  a crying child inside, which had been driven through Westchester County at a  great pace shortly before sunset on the previous day, closely followed by a  buggy with the storm-apron up, though the sun shone and there was not a cloud  in the sky; but nothing definite, nothing which could give hope to the  distracted mother or do more than divide the attention of the police between  two different but equally tenable theories. Then came the cablegram from Mr.  Ocumpaugh, which threw amateur as well as professional detectives into the  field. Among the latter was myself; which naturally brings me back once more to  my own conclusions.</p>
  <p>Of  one thing I felt sure. Very early in my cogitations, before we had quitted the  Park Avenue tunnel in fact, I had decided in my own mind that if I were to  succeed in locating the lost heiress, it must be by subtler methods than lay  open to the police. I was master of such methods (in this case at least), and  though one of many owning to similar hopes on this very train which was rushing  me through to Homewood, I had no feeling but that of confidence in a final  success. How well founded this confidence was, will presently appear.</p>
  <p>The  number of seedy-looking men with a mysterious air who alighted in my company at  &mdash; station and immediately proceeded to make their way up the steep street  toward Homewood, warned me that it would soon be extremely difficult for any  one to obtain access to the parties most interested in the child&rsquo;s loss. Had I  not possessed the advantage of being already known to Mrs. Ocumpaugh, I should  have immediately given up all hope of ever obtaining access to her presence;  and even with this fact to back me, I approached the house with very little  confidence in my ability to win my way through the high iron gates I had so  frequently passed before without difficulty.</p>
  <p>And  indeed I found them well guarded. As I came nearer, I could see man after man  being turned away, and not till my card had been handed in, and a hurried note  to boot, did I obtain permission to pass the first boundary. Another note  secured me admission to the house, but there my progress stopped. Mrs.  Ocumpaugh had already been interviewed by five reporters and a special agent  from the New York police. She could see no one else at present. If, however, my  business was of importance, an opportunity would be given me to see Miss  Porter. Miss Porter was her companion and female factotum.</p>
  <p>As  I had calculated upon having a half-dozen words with the mother herself, I was  greatly thrown out by this; but going upon the principle that &ldquo;half a loaf was  better than no bread,&rdquo; I was about to express a desire to see Miss Porter, when  an incident occurred which effectually changed my mind in this regard.</p>
  <p>The  hall in which I was standing and which communicated with the side door by which  I had entered, ended in a staircase, leading, as I had reason to believe, to  the smaller and less pretentious rooms in the rear of the house. While I  hesitated what reply to give the girl awaiting my decision, I caught the sound  of soft weeping from the top of this staircase, and presently beheld the figure  of a young woman coming slowly down, clad in coat and hat and giving every  evidence both in dress and manner of leaving for good. It was Miss Graham, a  young woman who held the position of nursery-governess to the child. I had seen  her before, and had no small admiration for her, and the sensations I  experienced at the sight of her leaving the house where her services were  apparently no longer needed, proved to me, possibly for the first time, that I  had more heart in my breast than I had ever before realized. But it was not  this which led me to say to the maid standing before me that I preferred to see  Mrs. Ocumpaugh herself, and would call early the next day. It was the thought  that this sorrowing girl would have to pass the gauntlet of many prying eyes on  her way to the station and that she might be glad of an escort whom she knew  and had shown some trust in. Also,&mdash;but the reasons behind that also will soon  become sufficiently apparent.</p>
  <p>I was  right in supposing that my presence on the porch outside would be a pleasing  surprise to her. Though her tears continued to flow she accepted my proffered  companionship with gratitude, and soon we were passing side by side across the  lawn toward a short cut leading down the bank to the small flag-station used by  the family and by certain favored neighbors. As we threaded the shrubbery,  which is very thick about the place, she explained to me the cause of her  abrupt departure. The sight of her, it seems, had become insupportable to Mrs.  Ocumpaugh. Though no blame could be rightfully attached to her, it was  certainly true that the child had been carried off while in her charge, and  however hard it might be for <i>her</i>, few could blame the mother for wishing  her removed from the house desolated by her lack of vigilance. But she was a  good girl and felt the humiliation of her departure almost in the light of a  disgrace.</p>
  <p>As  we came again into an open portion of the lawn, she stopped short and looked  back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she cried, gripping me by the arm, &ldquo;there is Mrs. Ocumpaugh still at the  window. All night she has stood there, except when she flew down to the river  at the sound of some imaginary call from the boats. She believes, she really  believes, that they will yet come upon Gwendolen&rsquo;s body in the dock there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Following  the direction of her glance, I looked up. Was that Mrs. Ocumpaugh&mdash;that haggard,  intent figure with eyes fixed in awful expectancy on the sinister group I could  picture to myself down at the water&rsquo;s edge? Never could I have imagined such a  look on features I had always considered as cold as they were undeniably  beautiful. As I took in the misery it expressed, that awful waiting for an  event momently anticipated, and momently postponed, I found myself, without  reason and simply in response to the force of her expression, unconsciously  sharing her expectation, and with a momentary forgetfulness of all the  probabilities, was about to turn toward the spot upon which her glances were  fixed, when a touch on my arm recalled me to myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;  whispered my trembling companion. &ldquo;She may look down and see us here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  yielded to her persuasion and turned away into the cluster of trees that lay  between us and that opening in the hedge through which our course lay. Had I  been alone I should not have budged till I had seen some change&mdash;any change&mdash;in  the face whose appearance had so deeply affected me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Ocumpaugh certainly believes that the body of her child lies in the water,&rdquo; I  remarked, as we took our way onward as rapidly as possible. &ldquo;Do you know her  reasons for this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  says, and I think she is right so far, that the child has been bent for a long  time on fishing; that she has heard her father talk repeatedly of his great  luck in Canada last year and wished to try the sport for herself; that she has  been forbidden to go to the river, but must have taken the first opportunity  when no eye was on her to do so; and&mdash;and&mdash;Mrs. Ocumpaugh shows a bit of string  which she found last night in the bushes alongside the tracks when she ran  down, as I have said, at some imaginary shout from the boats&mdash;a string which she  declares she saw rolled up in Gwendolen&rsquo;s hand when she went into the bungalow  to look at her. Of course, it may not be the same, but Mrs. Ocumpaugh thinks it  is, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think it possible, after all, that the child did stray down to the water?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  was the vehement disclaimer. &ldquo;Gwendolen&rsquo;s feet were excessively tender. She  could not have taken three steps in only one shoe. I should have heard her cry out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  if she went in some one&rsquo;s arms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  stranger&rsquo;s? She had a decided instinct against strangers. Never could any one  she did not know and like have carried her so far as that without her waking.  Then those men on the track,&mdash;they would have seen her. No, Mr. Trevitt, it was  not in <i>that</i> direction she went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  force of her emphasis convinced me that she had an opinion of her own in regard  to this matter. Was it one she was ready to impart?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what direction, then?&rdquo; I asked, with a gentleness I hoped would prove  effective.</p>
  <p>Her  impulse was toward a frank reply. I saw her lips part and her eyes take on the  look which precedes a direct avowal, but, as chance would have it, we came at  that moment upon the thicket inclosing the bungalow, and the sight of its  picturesque walls, showing brown through the verdure of the surrounding  shrubbery, seemed to act as a check upon her, for, with a quick look and a  certain dry accent quite new in her speech, she suddenly inquired if I did not  want to see the place from which Gwendolen had disappeared.</p>
  <p>Naturally  I answered in the affirmative and followed her as she turned aside into the  circular path which embraces this hidden retreat; but I had rather have heard  her answer to my question, than to have gone anywhere or seen anything at that  moment. Yet, when in full view of the bungalow&rsquo;s open door, she stopped to  point out to me the nearness of the place to that opening in the hedge we had  just been making for, and when she even went so far as to indicate the tangled  little path by which that opening could be reached directly from the farther  end of the bungalow, I considered that my question had been answered, though in  another way than I anticipated, even before I noted the slight flush which rose  to her cheek under my earnest scrutiny.</p>
  <p>As  it is important for the exact location of the bungalow to be understood, I  subjoin a diagram of this part of the ground:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="c00050-images/page020.png" width="776" height="750"></p>
  <p>As  I took this all in, I ventured to ask some particulars of the family living so  near the Ocumpaughs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  occupies that house?&rdquo; I asked, pointing to the sloping roofs and ornamental  chimneys arising just beyond us over the hedge-rows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that is Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s home. She is a widow and Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s dearest friend.  How she loved Gwendolen! How we all loved her! And now, that <i>wretch</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  burst into tears. They were genuine ones; so was her grief.</p>
  <p>I  waited till she was calm again, then I inquired very softly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  wretch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not been inside,&rdquo; she suggested, pointing sharply to the bungalow.</p>
  <p>I  took the implied rebuke and entered the door she indicated. A man was sitting  within, but he rose and went out when he saw us. He wore a policeman&rsquo;s badge  and evidently recognized her or possibly myself. I noted, however, that he did  not go far from the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is only a den,&rdquo; remarked Miss Graham.</p>
  <p>I  looked about me. She had described it perfectly: a place to lounge in on an  August day like the present. Walls of Georgia pine across one of which hung a  series of long dark rugs; a long, low window looking toward the house, a few  articles of bamboo furniture describe the place. Among the latter was a couch.  It was drawn up underneath the window, on the other side of which ran the bench  where my companion declared she had been sitting while listening to the music.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  you think my attention would have been caught by the sound of any one moving  about here?&rdquo; she cried, pointing to the couch and then to the window. &ldquo;But the  window was closed and the door, as you see, is round the corner from the bench.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  person with a very stealthy step, apparently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  she admitted. &ldquo;Oh, how can I ever forgive myself! how can I ever, ever forgive  myself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  she stood wringing her hands in sight of that empty couch, I cast a  scrutinizing glance about me, which led me to remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  interior looks new; much newer than the outside. It has quite a modern air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the bungalow is old, very old; but this room, or den, or whatever you might  call it, was all remodeled and fitted up as you see it now when the new house  went up. It had long been abandoned as a place of retreat, and had fallen into  such decay that it was a perfect eyesore to all who saw it. Now it is likely to  be abandoned again, and for what a reason! Oh, the dreadful place! How I hate  it, now Gwendolen is gone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment. I notice another thing. This room does not occupy the whole of the  bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Either  she did not hear me or thought it unnecessary to reply; and perceiving that her  grief had now given way to an impatience to be gone, I did not press the  matter, but led the way myself to the door. As we entered the little path which  runs directly to that outlet in the hedge marked E, I ventured to speak again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have reasons, or so it appears, for believing that the child was carried off  through this very path?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  reply was impetuous:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  else could she have been spirited away so quickly? Besides,&mdash;&rdquo; here her eye  stole back at me over her shoulder,&mdash;&ldquo;I have since remembered that as I ran out  of the bungalow in my fright at finding the child gone, I heard the sound of  wheels on Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s driveway. It did not mean much to me then, for I  expected to find the child somewhere about the grounds; but <i>now</i>, when I  come to think, it means everything, for a child&rsquo;s cry mingled with it (or I  imagined that it did) and that child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  I forcibly interposed, &ldquo;the police should know this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  do; and so does Mrs. Ocumpaugh; but she has only the one idea, and nothing can  move her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  remembered the wagon with the crying child inside which had been seen on the  roads the previous evening, and my heart fell a little in spite of myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t  Mrs. Carew tell us something about this?&rdquo; I asked, with a gesture toward the  house we were now passing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Mrs. Carew went to New York that morning and had only just returned when we  missed Gwendolen. She had been for her little nephew, who has lately been made  an orphan, and she was too busy making him feel at home to notice if a carriage  had passed through her grounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  servants then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  had none. All had been sent away. The house was quite empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought this rather odd, but having at this moment reached the long flight of  steps leading down the embankment, I made no reply till we reached the foot.  Then I observed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought Mrs. Carew was very intimate with Mrs. Ocumpaugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is; they are more like sisters than mere friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she goes to New York the very day her friend gives a musicale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she had good reasons for that. Mrs. Carew is planning to sail this week for  Europe, and this was her only opportunity for getting her little nephew, who is  to go with her. But I don&rsquo;t know as she will sail, now. She is wild with grief  over Gwendolen&rsquo;s loss, and will not feel like leaving Mrs. Ocumpaugh till she  knows whether we shall ever see the dear child again. But, I shall miss my  train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  her step visibly hastened.</p>
  <p>As  it was really very nearly due, I had not the heart to detain her. But as I  followed in her wake I noticed that for all her hurry a curious hesitancy crept  into her step at times, and I should not have been surprised at any moment to  see her stop and confront me on one of the two remaining long flights of steps  leading down the steep hillside.</p>
  <p>But  we both reached the base without her having yielded to this impulse, and  presently we found ourselves in full view of the river and the small  flag-station located but a few rods away toward the left. As we turned toward  the latter, we both cast an involuntary look back at the Ocumpaugh dock, where  a dozen men could be seen at work dragging the river-bed with grappling irons.  It made a sadly suggestive picture, and the young girl at my side shuddered  violently as we noted the expression of morbid curiosity on the faces of such  onlookers, men and women, as were drawn up at the end of the small point on  which the boat-house stood.</p>
  <p>But  I had another reason than this for urging her on. I had noticed how, at the  sight of her slight figure descending the slope, some half-dozen men or so had  separated themselves from this group, with every appearance of intending to  waylay and question her. She noticed this too, and drawing up more closely to  my side, exclaimed with marked feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Save  me from these men and I will tell you something that no one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here she stopped, here our very thoughts stopped. A shout had risen from the  group at the water-edge; a shout which made us both turn, and even caused the  men who had started to follow us to wheel about and rush back to the dock with  every appearance of intense excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it? What can it be?&rdquo; faltered my greatly-alarmed companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have found something. See! what is that the man in the boat is holding up? It  looks like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  she was already half-way to the point, outstripping the very men whose  importunities she had shrunk from a moment before. I was not far behind her,  and almost immediately we found ourselves wedged among the agitated group  leaning over the little object which had been tossed ashore into the first hand  outstretched to receive it.</p>
  <p>It  was a second little shoe&mdash;filled with sand and dripping with water, but  recognizable as similar to the one already found on the preceding day high up  on the bank. As this fact was borne in on us all, a groan of pity broke from  more than one pair of lips, and eye after eye stole up the hillside to that far  window in the great pile above us where the mother&rsquo;s form could be dimly  discerned swaying in an agitation caught from our own excitement.</p>
  <p>But  there was one amongst us whose glance never left that little shoe. The train  she had been so anxious to take whistled and went thundering by, but she never  moved or noticed. Suddenly she reached out her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see it, please,&rdquo; she entreated. &ldquo;I was her nurse; let me take it in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man who held it passed it over. She examined it long and closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it is hers,&rdquo; said she. But in another moment she had laid it down with what I  thought was a very peculiar look.</p>
  <p>Instantly  it was caught up and carried with a rush up the slope to where Mrs. Ocumpaugh  could be seen awaiting it with outstretched arms. But I did not linger to mark  her reception of it. Miss Graham had drawn me to one side and was whispering in  my ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must talk to you. I can not keep back another moment what I think or what I  feel. Some one is playing with Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s fears. That shoe is Gwendolen&rsquo;s,  but it is not the mate of the one found on the bank above. That was for the  left foot <i>and so is this one</i>. Did you not notice?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  &ldquo;A Fearsome Man&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The  effect of this statement upon me was greater than even she had contemplated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  thought the child had been stolen for the reward she would bring?&rdquo; she  continued. &ldquo;She was not; she was taken out of pure hate, and that is why I  suffer so. What may they not do to her! In what hole hide her! My darling, O my  darling!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was going off into hysterics, but the look and touch I gave her recalled her to  herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  need to be calm,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;You, because you have something of importance to  impart, and I, because of the action I must take as soon as the facts you have  concealed become known to me. What gives you such confidence in this belief,  which I am sure is not shared by the police, and who is the <i>some one</i> who, as you say, is playing upon Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s fears? A short time ago it  was as <i>the wretch</i> you spoke of him. Are not <i>some one</i> and <i>the  wretch</i> one and the same person, and can you not give him now a name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  had been moving all this time in the direction of the station and had now  reached the foot of the platform. Pausing, she cast a last look up the bank.  The trees were thick and hid from our view the Ocumpaugh mansion, but in  imagination she beheld the mother moaning over that little shoe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall never return there,&rdquo; she muttered; &ldquo;why do I hesitate so to speak!&rdquo; Then  in a burst, as I watched her in growing excitement: &ldquo;She&mdash;Mrs. Ocumpaugh&mdash;begged  me not to tell what she believed had nothing to do with our Gwendolen&rsquo;s loss.  But I can not keep silence. This proof of a conspiracy against herself  certainly relieves me from any promise I may have made her. Mr. Trevitt, I am  positive that I know who carried off Gwendolen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was becoming interesting, intensely interesting to me. Glancing about and  noting that the group down at the water-edge had become absorbed again in  renewed efforts toward further discoveries, I beckoned her to follow me into the  station. It was but a step, but it gave me time to think. What was I  encouraging this young girl to do? To reveal to <i>me</i>, who had no claim  upon her but that of friendship, a secret which had not been given to the  police? True, it might not be worth much, but it was also true that it might be  worth a great deal. Did she know how much? I wanted money&mdash;few wanted it  more&mdash;but I felt that I could not listen to her story till I had fairly settled  this point. I therefore hastened to interpose a remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Graham, you are good enough to offer to reveal some fact hitherto concealed. Do  you do this because you have no closer friend than myself, or because you do  not know what such knowledge may be worth to the person you give it to&mdash;in  money, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  money? I am not thinking of money,&rdquo; was her amazed reply; &ldquo;I am thinking of  Gwendolen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand, but you should think of the practical results as well. Have you not  heard of the enormous reward offered by Mr. Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  thousand dollars for information; and fifty thousand to the one who will bring  her back within the week unharmed. Mr. Ocumpaugh cabled to that effect  yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a large sum,&rdquo; she faltered, and for a moment she hesitated. Then, with a  sweet and candid look which sank deep into my heart, she added gravely: &ldquo;I had  rather not think of money in connection with Gwendolen. If what I have to tell  leads to her recovery, you can be trusted, I know, to do what is right toward  me. Mr. Trevitt, the man who stole her from her couch and carried her away  through Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s grounds in a wagon or otherwise, is a long-haired, heavily  whiskered man of sixty or more years of age. His face is deeply wrinkled, but  chiefly marked by a long scar running down between his eyebrows, which are so shaggy  that they would quite hide his eyes if they were not lit up with an  extraordinary expression of resolution, carried almost to the point of frenzy;  a fearsome man, making your heart stand still when he pauses to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Startled  as I had seldom been, for reasons which will hereafter appear, I surveyed her  in mingled wonder and satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  name?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  I stopped to look at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Mrs. Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think so. She only knows what I told her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what did you tell her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  who are these?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two  or three persons had entered the station, probably to wait for the next train.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one who will molest you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  she was not content till we had withdrawn to where the time-table hung up on  the opposite wall. Turning about as if to consult it, she told the following  story. I never see a time-table now but I think of her expression as she stood  there looking up as if her mind were fixed on what she probably did not see at  all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last  Wednesday&mdash;no, it was on the Wednesday preceding&mdash;I was taking a ride with  Gwendolen on one of the side roads branching off toward Fordham. We were in her  own little pony cart, and as we seldom rode together like this, she had been  chattering about a hundred things till her eyes danced in her head and she  looked as lovely as I had ever seen her. But suddenly, just as we were about to  cross a small wooden bridge, I saw her turn pale and her whole sensitive form  quiver. &lsquo;Some one I don&rsquo;t like,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;There is some one about whom I don&rsquo;t  like. Drive on, Ellie, drive on.&rsquo; But before I could gather up the reins a  figure which I had not noticed before stepped from behind a tree at the farther  end of the bridge, and advancing into the middle of the road with arms thrown  out, stopped our advance. I have told you how he looked, but I can give you no  idea of the passionate fury lighting up his eyes, or the fiery dignity with  which he held his place and kept us subdued to his will till he had looked the  shrinking child all over, and laughed, not as a madman laughs, oh, much too  slow and ironically for that! but like one who takes an unholy pleasure in  mocking the happy present with evil prophecy. Nothing that I can say will make  you see him as I saw him in that one instant, and though there was much in the  circumstance to cause fear, I think it was more awe than fright we felt, so  commanding was his whole appearance and so forcible the assurance with which he  held us there till he was ready to move. Gwendolen cried out, but the imploring  sound had no effect upon him; it only reawakened his mirth and led him to say,  in a clear, cold, mocking tone which I hear yet, &lsquo;Cry out, little one, for your  short day is nearly over. Silks and feathers and carriages and servants will  soon be a half-forgotten memory to you; and right it is that it should be so.  Ten days, little one, only ten days more.&rsquo; And with that he moved, and,  slipping aside behind the tree, allowed us to drive on. Mr. Trevitt, yesterday  saw the end of those ten days, and where is she now? Only that man knows. He is  one man in a thousand. Can not you find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned; a train was coming, a train which it was very evident she felt it her  duty to take. I had no right to detain her, but I found time for a question or  two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you told Mrs. Ocumpaugh this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  moment we arrived home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she? What did she think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Ocumpaugh is not a talkative woman. She grew very white and clasped the child  passionately in her arms. But the next minute she had to all appearance  dismissed the whole occurrence from her thoughts. &lsquo;Some socialistic fanatic,&rsquo;  she called him and merely advised me to stop driving with Gwendolen for the  present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you recall the matter to her when you found the child missing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but then she appeared to regard it in a superstitious way only. It was a  warning of death, she said, and the man an irresponsible clairvoyant. When I  tried to urge my own idea upon her and describe how I thought he might have  obtained access to the bungalow and carried her off, while still asleep, to  some vehicle awaiting them in Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s grounds, she only rebuked me for my  folly and bade me keep still about the whole occurrence, saying that I should  only be getting some poor half-demented old wretch into trouble for something  for which he was not in the least responsible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very considerate woman,&rdquo; I remarked; to which Miss Graham made reply as the  train came storming up:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  knows how considerate, even if she has dismissed me rather suddenly from her  service. Don&rsquo;t let that wretch&rdquo;&mdash;again she used the word&mdash;&ldquo;deceive her or you  into thinking that the little one perished in the water. Gwendolen is alive, I  say. Find him and you will find her. I saw his resolution in his eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  she made a rush for the cars, and I had time only to get her future address  before the train started and all further opportunity of conversation between us  was over for that day.</p>
  <p>I  remained behind because I was by no means through with my investigations. What  she had told me only convinced me of the necessity I had already recognized of  making myself master of all that could be learned at Homewood before  undertaking the very serious business of locating the child or even the aged  man just described to me, and who I was now sure had been the chief, if not the  sole, instrument in her abduction.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    A Charming Woman</b></h2>
  <p>Stopping  only long enough to send a telegram to my partner in New York, (for which  purpose I had to walk along the tracks to the main station) I returned by the  short cut to Homewood. My purpose in doing this was twofold. I should have a  chance of seeing if the men were still at work in the river, and I should also  have the added opportunity of quietly revisiting the bungalow, on the floor of  which I had noted some chalk-marks, which I felt called for a closer  examination than I had given them. As I came in view of the dock, I saw that  the men were still busy, but at a point farther out in the river, as if all  hope had been abandoned of their discovering anything more inshore. But the chalk-marks  in the bungalow were almost forgotten by me in the interest I experienced in a  certain adventure which befell me on my way there.</p>
  <p>I  had just reached the opening in the hedge communicating with Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s  grounds, when I heard steps on the walk inside and a woman&rsquo;s rich voice saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  that will do. You must play on the other side of the house, Harry. And Dinah,  see that he does so, and that he does not cross the hall again till I come  back. The sight of so merry a child might kill Mrs. Ocumpaugh if she happened  to look this way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Moved  by the tone, which was one in a thousand, I involuntarily peered through the  outlet I was passing, in the hope of catching a glimpse of its owner, and thus  was favored with the sight of a face which instantly fixed itself in my memory  as one of the most enchanting I had ever encountered. Not from its beauty, yet  it may have been beautiful; nor from its youth, for the woman before me was not  youthful, but from the extraordinary eloquence of its expression caught at a  rare moment when the heart, which gave it life, was full. She was standing  half-way down the path, throwing kisses to a little boy who was leaning toward  her from an upper window. The child was laughing with glee, and it was this  laugh she was trying to check; but her countenance, as she made the effort, was  almost as merry as his, and yet was filled with such solemn joy&mdash;such ecstasy of  motherhood I should be inclined to call it, if I had not been conscious that  this must be Mrs. Carew and the child her little nephew&mdash;that in my admiration  for this exhibition of pure feeling, I forgot to move on as she advanced into  the hedge-row, and so we came face to face. The result was as extraordinary to  me as all the rest. Instantly all the gay abandonment left her features, and  she showed me a grave, almost troubled, countenance, more in keeping with her  severe dress, which was as nearly like mourning as it could be and not be made  of crape.</p>
  <p>It  was such a sudden change and of so complete a character, that I was thrown off  my guard for a moment and probably betrayed the curiosity I undoubtedly felt;  for she paused as she reached me, and, surveying me very quietly but very  scrutinizingly too, raised again that marvelous voice of hers and pointedly  observed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is a private path, sir. Only the friends of Mrs. Ocumpaugh or of myself pass  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a speech calculated to restore my self-possession. With a bow which  evidently surprised her, I answered with just enough respect to temper my  apparent presumption:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am here in the interests of Mrs. Ocumpaugh, to assist her in finding her child.  Moments are precious; so I ventured to approach by the shorter way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me!&rdquo; The words did not come instantly, but after some hesitation, during which  she kept her eyes on my face in a way to rob me of all thought save that she  possessed a very strong magnetic quality, to which it were well for a man like  myself to yield. &ldquo;You will be my friend, too, if you succeed in restoring  Gwendolen.&rdquo; Then quickly, as she crossed to the Ocumpaugh grounds: &ldquo;You do not  look like a member of the police. Are you here at Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s bidding, and  has she at last given up all expectation of finding her child in the river?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I,  too, thought a minute before answering, then I put on my most candid  expression, for was not this woman on her way to Mrs. Ocumpaugh, and would she  not be likely to repeat what she heard me say?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know how Mrs. Ocumpaugh feels at present. But I know what her dearest  wish is&mdash;to see her child again alive and well. That wish I shall do my best to  gratify. It is true that I am not a police detective, but I have an agency of  my own, well-known to both Mrs. and Mr. Ocumpaugh. All its resources will be  devoted to this business and I hope to succeed, madam. If, as I suspect, you  are on your way to Mrs. Ocumpaugh, please tell her that Robert Trevitt, of  Trevitt and Jupp, hopes to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>will</i>,&rdquo;  she emphasized. Then stepping back to me in all the grace of her thrilling  personality, she eagerly added: &ldquo;If there is any information I can give, do not  be afraid to ask me. I love children, and would give anything in the world to  see Mrs. Ocumpaugh as happy with Gwendolen again as I am with my little nephew.  Are you quite sure that there is any possibility of this? I was told that the  child&rsquo;s shoe has been found in the river; but almost immediately following this  information came the report that there was something odd about this shoe, and  that Mrs. Ocumpaugh had gone into hysterics. Do <i>you</i> know what they meant  by that? I was just going over to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did know what they meant, but I preferred to seem ignorant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not seen Mrs. Ocumpaugh,&rdquo; I evasively rejoined. &ldquo;But <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t look  for the child to be drawn from the water.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I,&rdquo; she repeated, with a hoarse catch in her breath. &ldquo;It is thirty-six hours  since we lost her. Time enough for the current to have carried her sweet little  body far away from here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  surveyed the lady before me in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then <i>you</i> think she strayed down to the water?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  it would madden me to believe otherwise; loving her so well, and her parents so  well, I dare not think of a worse fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taking  advantage of her amiability and the unexpected opportunity it offered for a  leading question, I hereupon ventured to say: &ldquo;You were not at home, I hear,  when she vanished from the bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  that is, if it happened before three o&rsquo;clock. I arrived from the station just  as the clock was striking the hour, and having my little nephew with me, I was  too much occupied in reconciling him to his new home, to hear or see anything  outside. Most unfortunate!&rdquo; she mourned, &ldquo;most unfortunate! I shall never cease  reproaching myself. A tragedy at my door&rdquo;&mdash;here she glanced across the shrubbery  at the bungalow&mdash;&ldquo;and I occupied with my own affairs!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a flush, the undoubted result of her own earnestness, she turned as if to go.  But I could not let her depart without another question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, Mrs. Carew, but you gave me permission to seem importunate. With the  exception of her nurse, you were the one person nearest the bungalow at the  time. Didn&rsquo;t you hear a carriage drive through your grounds at about the hour  the alarm was first started? I know you have been asked this before, but not by  me; and it is a very important fact to have settled; very important for those  who wish to discover this child at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  reply she gave me a look of very honest amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I did,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I came in a carriage myself from the station and  naturally heard it drive away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  her look, at her word, the thread which I had seized with such avidity seemed  to slip from my fingers. Had little Miss Graham&rsquo;s theory no better foundation  than this? and were the wheels she heard only those of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s departing  carriage? I resolved to press the matter even if I ran the risk of displeasing  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Carew&mdash;for it must be Mrs. Carew I am addressing&mdash;did your little nephew cry when  you first brought him to the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think he did,&rdquo; she admitted slowly; &ldquo;I think he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  must have given evidence of the sudden discouragement this brought me, for her  lips parted and her whole frame trembled with sudden earnestness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you think&mdash;did any one think&mdash;that those cries came from Gwendolen? That she was  carried out through my grounds? Could any one have thought that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been told that the nursery-governess did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little  Miss Graham? Poor girl! she is but defending herself from despair. She is ready  to believe everything but that the child is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  it so? Was I following the false light of a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp? No, no; the  strange coincidence of the threat made on the bridge with the disappearance of  the child on the day named, was at least real. The thread had not altogether  escaped from my hands. It was less tangible, but it was still there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be right,&rdquo; I acquiesced, for I saw that her theories were entirely opposed  to those of Miss Graham. &ldquo;But we must try everything, <i>everything</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was about to ask whether she had ever seen in the adjoining grounds, or on the  roads about, an old man with long hair and a remarkable scar running down  between his eyebrows, when a young girl in the cap and apron of a maid-servant  came running through the shrubbery from the Ocumpaugh house, and, seeing Mrs.  Carew, panted out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do come over to the house, Mrs. Carew. Mrs. Ocumpaugh has been told that the  two shoes which have been found, one on the bank and the other in the river,  are not mates, and it has quite distracted her. She has gone to her room and  will let no one else in. We can hear her moaning and crying, but we can do  nothing. Perhaps she will see you. She called for you, I know, before she shut  her door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will go.&rdquo; Mrs. Carew had turned quite pale, and from standing upright in the  road, had moved so as to gain support from one of the hedges.</p>
  <p>I  expected to see her turn and go as soon as her trembling fit was over, but she  did not, though she waved the girl away as if she intended to follow her. Had I  not learned to distrust my own impression of people&rsquo;s motives from their  manners and conduct, I should have said that she was waiting for me to precede  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  shoes and not mates!&rdquo; she finally exclaimed. &ldquo;What does she mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  that another shoe has been drawn up from the river-bottom which does not mate  the one picked up near the bungalow. Both are for the left foot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  gasped this sympathetic woman. &ldquo;And what inference can we draw from that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  should not have answered her; but the command in her eyes or the thrilling  effect of her manner compelled me, and I spoke the truth at once, just as I  might have done to Mrs. Ocumpaugh, or, better still, to Mr. Ocumpaugh, if  either had insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  one,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;There is a conspiracy on the part of one or more persons to  delude Mrs. Ocumpaugh into believing the child dead. They blundered over it,  but they came very near succeeding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  blundered, and what is the meaning of the conspiracy you hint at? Tell me. Tell  me what such men as you think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  plastic features had again shown a change. She was all anxiety now; cheeks  burning, eyes blazing&mdash;a very beautiful woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  think that the case looks serious. We think from the very mystery it displays,  that there is a keen intelligence back of this crime. I can not go any further  than that. The affair is as yet too obscure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  amaze me!&rdquo; she faltered, making an effort to collect her thoughts. &ldquo;I have  always thought, just as Mrs. Ocumpaugh has, that the child had somehow found  her way to the water and was drowned. But if all this is true we shall have to  face a worse evil. A conspiracy against such a tender little being as that! A  conspiracy, and for what? Not to extort money, or why these blundering efforts  to make the child appear dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was the same sympathetic woman, agitated by real feeling as before, yet at this  moment&mdash;I do not understand now just why&mdash;I became aware of an inner movement of  caution against too great a display of candor on my own part.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,  it is all a mystery at present. I am sure that the police will tell you the  same. But another day may bring developments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us hope so!&rdquo; was her ardent reply, accompanied by a gesture, the freedom of  which suited her style and person as it would not have done those of a less  impressionable woman. And, seeing that I had no intention of leaving the spot  where I stood, she moved at last from where she held herself upright against  the hedge, and entered the Ocumpaugh grounds. &ldquo;Will you call in to see me  to-morrow?&rdquo; she asked, pausing to look back at a turn in the path. &ldquo;I shall not  sleep to-night for thinking of those possible developments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  you permit me,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;that is, if I am still here. Affairs may call me  away at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and so with me. Affairs may call me away also. I was to sail on Saturday for  Liverpool. Only Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s distress detains me. If the situation  lightens, if we hear any good news to-night, or even early to-morrow, I shall  continue my preparations, which will take me again to New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will call if you are at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave me a slight nod and vanished.</p>
  <p>Why  did I stand a good three minutes where she had left me, thinking, but not  getting anything from my thoughts, save that I was glad that I had not been  betrayed into speaking of the old man Miss Graham had met on the bridge? Yet it  might have been well, after all, if I had done so, if only to discover whether  Mrs. Ocumpaugh had confided this occurrence to her most intimate friend.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    Chalk-Marks</b></h2>
  <p>My  next move was toward the bungalow. Those chalk-marks still struck me as being  worthy of investigation, and not only they, but the bungalow itself. That certainly  merited a much closer inspection than I had been able to give it under Miss  Graham&rsquo;s eye.</p>
  <p>It  was not quite a new place to me, nor was I so ignorant of its history (and it  had a history) as I had appeared to be in my conversation with Miss Graham).  Originally it had been a stabling place for horses; and tradition said that it  had once harbored for a week the horse of General Washington. This was when the  house on the knoll above had been the seat and home of one of our most famous  Revolutionary generals. Later, as the trees grew up around this building, it  attracted the attention of a new owner, William Ocumpaugh, the first of that  name to inhabit Homewood, and he, being a man of reserved manners and very  studious habits, turned it into what we would now call, as Miss Graham did, a  den, but which he styled a pavilion, and used as a sort of study or  reading-room.</p>
  <p>His  son, who inherited it, Judge Philo Ocumpaugh, grandfather of the present Philo,  was as studious as his father, but preferred to read and write in the quaint  old library up at the house, famous for its wide glass doors opening on to the  lawn, and its magnificent view of the Hudson. His desk, which many remember (it  has a place in the present house, I believe), was so located that for forty years  or more he had this prospect ever before him, a prospect which included the  sight of his own pavilion, around which, for no cause apparent to his  contemporaries, he had caused a high wall to be built, effectually shutting in  both trees and building.</p>
  <p>This  wall has since been removed; but I have often heard it spoken of, and always  with a certain air of mystery; possibly because, as I have said, there seemed  no good reason for its erection, the place holding no treasure and the gate  standing always open; possibly because of its having been painted, in defiance  of all harmony with everything about the place, a dazzling white; and possibly  because it had not been raised till after the death of the judge&rsquo;s first wife,  who, some have said, breathed her last within the precincts it inclosed.</p>
  <p>However  that may be, there seems to be no doubt that this place exerted, very likely  against his will, for he never visited it, a singular fascination over the  secretive mind of this same upright but strangely taciturn ancestor of the  Ocumpaughs. For during the forty years in which he wrote and read at this desk,  the shutters guarding the door overlooking those decaying walls were never  drawn to, or so the tradition runs; and when he died, it was found that, by a  clause in his will, this pavilion, hut or bungalow, all of which names it bore  at different stages of its existence, was recommended to the notice of his  heirs as an object which they were at liberty to leave in its present forsaken  condition, though he did not exact this, but which was never, under any  circumstances or to serve any purpose, to be removed from its present site, or  even to suffer any demolition save such as came with time and the natural round  of the seasons, to whose tender mercies he advised it to be left. In other  words, it was to stand, and to stand unmolested, till it fell of its own  accord, or was struck to the earth by lightning&mdash;a tragic alternative in the  judgment of those who knew it for a structure of comparative insignificance,  and one which, in the minds of many, and perhaps I may say in my own, appeared  to point to some serious and unrevealed cause not unlinked with the almost  forgotten death of that young wife to which I have just alluded.</p>
  <p>This  was years ago, far back in the fifties, and his son, who was a minor at his  death, grew up and assumed his natural proprietorship. The hut&mdash;it was nothing  but a hut now&mdash;had remained untouched&mdash;a ruin no longer habitable. The spirit, as  well as the letter, of that particular clause in his father&rsquo;s will had so far  been literally obeyed. The walls being of stone, had withstood decay, and still  rose straight and firm; but the roof had begun to sag, and whatever of woodwork  yet remained about it had rotted and fallen away, till the building was little  more than a skeleton, with holes for its windows and an open gap for its door.</p>
  <p>As  for the surrounding wall, it no longer stood out, an incongruous landmark, from  its background of trees and shrubbery. Young shoots had started up and old  branches developed till brick and paint alike were almost concealed from view  by a fresh girdle of greenery.</p>
  <p>And  now comes the second mystery.</p>
  <p>Sometime  after this latter Ocumpaugh had attained his majority&mdash;his name was Edwin, and  he was, as you already imagine, the father of the present Philo&mdash;he made an  attempt&mdash;a daring one it was afterward called&mdash;to brighten this neglected spot  and restore it to some sort of use, by giving a supper to his friends within  its broken-down walls.</p>
  <p>This  supper was no orgy, nor were the proprieties in any way transgressed by so  harmless a festivity; yet from this night a singular change was observed in  this man. Pleasure no longer charmed him, and instead of repeating the  experiment I have just described, he speedily evinced such an antipathy to the  scene of his late revel that only from the greatest necessity would he ever  again visit that part of the grounds.</p>
  <p>What  did it mean? What had occurred on that night of innocent enjoyment to disturb  or alarm him? Had some note in his own conscience been struck by an act which,  in his cooler moments, he may have looked upon as a species of sacrilege? Or  had some whisper from the past reached him amid the feasting, the laughing and  the jesting, to render these old walls henceforth intolerable to him? He never  said, but whatever the cause of this sudden aversion, the effect was deep and  promised to be lasting. For, one morning, not long after this event, a party of  workmen was seen leaving these grounds at daybreak, and soon it was noised  about that a massive brick partition had been put up across the interior of  this same pavilion, completely shutting off, for no reason that any one could  see, some ten feet of what had been one long and undivided room.</p>
  <p>It  was a strange act enough; but when, a few days later, it was followed by one  equally mysterious, and they saw the encircling wall which had been so  carefully raised by Judge Ocumpaugh ruthlessly pulled down, and every sign of  its former presence there destroyed, wonder filled the highway and the  curiosity of neighbors and friends passed all bounds.</p>
  <p>But  no explanations were volunteered then or ever. People might query and peer, but  they learned nothing. What was left open to view told no tales beyond the old  one, and as for the single window which was the sole opening into the shut-off  space, it was then, as now, so completely blocked up by a network of closely  impacted vines, that it offered little more encouragement than the wall itself  to the eyes of such curiosity-mongers as crept in by way of the hedge-rows to  steal a look at the hut, and if possible gain a glimpse of an interior which  had suddenly acquired, by the very means taken to shut it off from every human  eye, a new importance pointing very decidedly toward the tragic.</p>
  <p>But  soon even this semblance of interest died out or was confined to strange tales  whispered under breath on weird nights at neighboring firesides, and the old  neglect prevailed once more. The whole place&mdash;new brick and old stone&mdash;seemed  doomed to a common fate under the hand of time, when the present Philo  Ocumpaugh, succeeding to the property, brought new wealth and business  enterprise into the family, and the old house on the hill was replaced by the  marble turrets of Homewood, and this hut&mdash;or rather the portion open to  improvement&mdash;was restored to some sort of comfort, and rechristened the  bungalow.</p>
  <p>Was  fate to be appeased by this effort at forgetfulness? No. In emulation of the  long abandoned portion so hopelessly cut off by that dividing wall, this  brightly-furnished adjunct to the great house had linked itself in the minds of  men to a new mystery&mdash;the mystery which I had come there to solve, if wit and  patience could do it, aided by my supposedly unshared knowledge of a fact  connecting me with this family&rsquo;s history in a way it little dreamed of.</p>
  <p>Naturally,  my first look was at the building itself. I have described its location and the  room from which the child was lost. What I wanted to see now, after studying  those chalk-marks, was whether that partition which had been put in, was as  impassable as was supposed.</p>
  <p>The  policeman on guard having strolled a few feet away, I approached the open  doorway without hindrance, and at once took that close look I had promised  myself, of the marks which I had observed scrawled broadly across the floor  just inside the threshold. They were as interesting and fully as important as I  had anticipated. Though nearly obliterated by the passing of the policeman&rsquo;s  feet across them, I was still enabled to read the one word which appeared to me  significant.</p>
  <p>If  you will glance at the following reproduction of a snap-shot which I took of  this scrawl, you will see what I mean.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="c00050-images/page060.png" width="736" height="179"></p>
  <p>The  significant character was the 16. Taken with the &ldquo;ust,&rdquo; there could be no doubt  that the whole writing had been a record of the date on which the child had  disappeared: August 16, 190-.</p>
  <p>This  in itself was of small consequence if the handwriting had not possessed those  marked peculiarities which I believed belonged to but one man&mdash;a man I had once  known&mdash;a man of reverend aspect, upright carriage and a strong distinguishing  mark, like an old-time scar, running straight down between his eyebrows. This  had been my thought when I first saw it. It was doubly so on seeing it again  after the doubts expressed by Miss Graham of a threatening old man who  possessed similar characteristics.</p>
  <p>Satisfied  on this point, I turned my attention to what still more seriously occupied it.  The three or four long rugs, which hung from the ceiling across the whole wall  at my left, evidently concealed the mysterious partition put up in Mr.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s time directly across this portion of the room. Was it a  totally unbroken partition? I had been told so; but I never accept such  assertions without a personal investigation.</p>
  <p>Casting  a glance through the doorway and seeing that it would take my dreaming friend,  the policeman, some two or three minutes yet to find his way back to his post,  I hastily lifted these rugs aside, one after the other, and took a look behind  them. A stretch of Georgia pine, laid, as I readily discovered by more than one  rap of my knuckles, directly over the bricks it was intended to conceal, was  visible under each; from end to end a plain partition with no indications of  its having been tampered with since the alterations were first made.</p>
  <p>Dismissing  from my mind one of those vague possibilities, which add such interest to the  calling of a detective, I left the place, with my full thought concentrated on  the definite clue I had received from the chalk-marks.</p>
  <p>But  I had not walked far before I met with a surprise which possibly possessed a  significance equal to anything I had already observed, if only I could have  fully understood it.</p>
  <p>On  the path into which I now entered, I encountered again the figure of Mrs.  Carew. Her face was turned full on mine, and she had evidently retraced her  steps to have another instant&rsquo;s conversation with me. The next moment I was  sure of this. Her eyes, always magnetic, shone with increasing brightness as I  advanced to meet her, and her manner, while grave, was that of a woman quite conscious  of the effect she produced by her least word or action.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have returned to tell you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I have more confidence in your  efforts than in those of the police officers around here. If Gwendolen&rsquo;s fate  is determined by any one it will be by you. So I want to be of aid to you if I  can. Remember that. I may have said this to you before, but I wish to impress  it upon you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a flutter in her movements which astonished me. She was surveying me in a  straightforward way, and I could not but feel the fire and force of her look.  Happily she was no longer a young woman or I might have misunderstood the  disturbance which took place in my own breast as I waited for the musical tones  to cease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very good,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;I need help, and shall be only too glad to receive  your assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yet  I did question her, though I presently found myself walking toward the house at  her side. She may not have expected me to presume so far. Certainly she showed  no dissatisfaction when, at a parting in the path, I took my leave of her and  turned my face in the direction of the gates. A strange sweet woman, with a  power quite apart from the physical charms which usually affect men of my age,  but one not easily read nor parted from unless one had an imperative errand, as  I had.</p>
  <p>This  errand was to meet and forestall the messenger boy whom I momently expected  with the answer to my telegram. That an opportunity for gossip was likewise  afforded by the motley group of men and boys drawn up near one of the gate-posts,  gave an added interest to the event which I was quite ready to appreciate.  Approaching this group, I assimilated myself with it as speedily as possible,  and, having some tact for this sort of thing, soon found myself the recipient  of various gratuitous opinions as to the significance of the find which had  offered such a problem both to the professional and unprofessional detective.  Two mis-mated shoes! Had Gwendolen Ocumpaugh by any chance worn such? No&mdash;or the  ones mating them would have been found in her closet, and this, some one  shouted out, had not been done. Only the one corresponding to that fished up  from the waters of the dock had come to light; the other, the one which the  child must really have worn, was no nearer being found than the child herself.  What did it all mean? No one knew; but all attempted some sort of hazardous  guess which I was happy to see fell entirely short of the mark.</p>
  <p>There  was not a word of the vindictive old man described by Miss Graham, till I  myself introduced the topic. My reason or rather my excuse for introducing it  was this:</p>
  <p>On  the gate-post near me I had observed the remnants of a strip of paper which had  been pasted there and afterward imperfectly torn off. It had an unsightly look,  but I did not pay much attention to it till some movement in the group forced  me a little nearer to the post, when I was surprised enough to see that this  scrap of paper showed signs of words, and that these words gave evidence of  being a date written in the very hand I now had no difficulty in recognizing as  that of the old man uppermost in my own mind, even if he were not the one whom  Miss Graham had seen on the bridge. This date&mdash;strange to say&mdash;was the same  significant one already noted on the floor of the bungalow&mdash;a fact which I felt  merited an explanation if any one about me could give it.</p>
  <p>Waiting,  therefore, for a lull in the remarks passing between the stable-men and other  employees about the place, I drew the attention of the first man who would  listen, to the half torn-off strip of paper on the post, and asked if that was  the way the Ocumpaughs gave notice of their entertainments.</p>
  <p>He  started, then turned his back on me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  wasn&rsquo;t put there for the entertainment,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;that was pasted up there  by some one who wanted to show off his writin&rsquo;. There don&rsquo;t seem to be no other  reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  the man who spoke these words had thereby proved himself a blockhead, I edged  away from him as soon as possible toward a very decent looking fellow who  appeared to have more brains than speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know who pasted that date upon the post?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
  <p>He  answered very directly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  or I should have been laying for him long before this. Why, it is not only  there you can see it. I found it pinned to the carriage cushions one day just  as I was going to drive Mrs. Ocumpaugh out.&rdquo; (Evidently I had struck upon the  coachman.) &ldquo;And not only that. One of the girls up at the house&mdash;one as I knows  pretty well&mdash;tells me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care who hears it now&mdash;that it was written across a  card which was left at the door for Mrs. Ocumpaugh, and all in the same  handwriting, which is not a common one, as you can see. This means something,  seeing it was the date when our bad luck fell on us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had noted that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t mean to say that these things were written and put about before the date  you see on them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I do. Would we have noticed since? But who are you, sir, if I may ask? One of  them detective fellows? If so, I have a word to say: Find that child or Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s blood will be on your head! She&rsquo;ll not live till Mr. Ocumpaugh  comes home unless she can show him his child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  I called out, for he was turning away toward the stable. &ldquo;You know who wrote  those slips?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it. No one does. Not that anybody thinks much about them but me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police must,&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  be, but they don&rsquo;t say anything about it. Somehow it looks to me as if they  were all at sea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly  they are,&rdquo; I remarked, letting him go as I caught sight of a small boy coming  up the road with several telegrams in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  one of those directed to Robert Trevitt?&rdquo; I asked, crowding up with the rest,  as his small form was allowed to slip through the gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spec&rsquo;s  there is,&rdquo; he replied, looking them over and handing me one.</p>
  <p>I  carried it to one side and hastily tore it open. It was, as I expected, from my  partner, and read as follows:</p>
  <p class="telegram">Man  you want has just returned after two days&rsquo; absence. Am on watch. Saw him just  alight from buggy with what looked like sleeping child in his arms. Closed and  fastened front door after him. Safe for to-night.</p>
  <p>Did  I allow my triumph to betray itself? I do not think so. The question which kept  down my elation was this: Would I be the first man to get there?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    The Old House In Yonkers</b></h2>
  <p>The  old man whose handwriting I had now positively identified was a former employer  of mine. I had worked in his office when a lad. He was a doctor of very fair  reputation in Westchester County, and I recognized every characteristic of his  as mentioned by Miss Graham, save the frenzy which she described as accompanying  his address.</p>
  <p>In  those days he was calm and cold and, while outwardly scrupulous, capable of  forgetting his honor as a physician under a sufficiently strong temptation. I  had left him when new prospects opened, and in the years which had elapsed had  contented myself with the knowledge that his shingle still hung out in Yonkers,  though his practice was nothing to what it used to be when I was in his employ.  Now I was going to see him again.</p>
  <p>That  his was the hand which had stolen Gwendolen seemed no longer open to doubt.  That she was under his care in the curious old house I remembered in the heart  of Yonkers, seemed equally probable; but why so sordid a man&mdash;one who loved  money above everything else in the world&mdash;should retain the child one minute after  the publication of the bountiful reward offered by Mr. Ocumpaugh, was what I  could not at first understand. Miss Graham&rsquo;s theory of hate had made no  impression on me. He was heartless and not likely to be turned aside from any  project he had formed, but he was not what I considered vindictive where  nothing was to be gained. Yet my comprehension of him had been but a boy&rsquo;s  comprehension, and I was now prepared to put a very different estimate on one  whose character had never struck me as being an open one, even when my own had  been most credulous.</p>
  <p>That  my enterprise, even with the knowledge I possessed of this man, promised well  or held out any prospects of easy fulfilment, I no longer allowed myself to  think. If money was his object&mdash;and what other could influence a man of his  temperament?&mdash;the sum offered by Mr. Ocumpaugh, large though it was, had  apparently not sufficed to satisfy his greed. He was holding back the child, or  so I now believed, in order to wring a larger, possibly a double, amount from the  wretched mother. Fifty thousand was a goodly sum, but one hundred thousand was  better; and this man had gigantic ideas where his cupidity was concerned. I  remember how firmly he had once stood out for ten thousand dollars when he had  been offered five; and I began to see, though in an obscure way as yet, how it  might very easily be a part of his plan to work Mrs. Ocumpaugh up to a positive  belief in the child&rsquo;s death before he came down upon her for the immense reward  he had fixed his heart upon. The date he had written all over the place might  thus find some explanation in a plan to weaken her nerve before pressing his  exorbitant claims upon her.</p>
  <p>Nothing  was clear, yet everything was possible in such a nature; and anxious to enter  upon the struggle both for my own sake and that of the child of whose condition  under that terrible eye I scarcely dared to think, I left Homewood in haste and  took the first train for Yonkers. Though the distance was not great, I had  fully arranged my plans before entering the town where so many of my boyish  years had been spent. I knew the old fox well enough, or thought I did, to be  certain that I should have anything but an easy entrance into his house, in  case it still harbored the child whom my partner had seen carried in there. I  anticipated difficulties, but was concerned about none but the possibility of  not being able to bring myself face to face with him. Once in his presence, the  knowledge which I secretly possessed of an old but doubtful transaction of his,  would serve to make him mine even to the point of yielding up the child he had  forcibly abducted. But would he accord me an interview? Could I, without appeal  to the police&mdash;and you can readily believe I was not anxious to allow them to  put their fingers in my pie&mdash;force him to open his door and let me into his  house, which, as I well recalled, he locked up at nine&mdash;after which he would  receive no one, not even a patient?</p>
  <p>It  was not nine yet, but it was very near that hour. I had but twenty minutes in  which to mount the hill to the old house marked by the doctor&rsquo;s sign and by  another peculiarity of so distinct a nature that it would serve to characterize  a dwelling in a city as large as New York&mdash;though I doubt if New York can show  its like from the Battery to the Bronx. The particulars of this I will mention  later. I have first to relate the relief I felt when, on entering the old  neighborhood, I heard in response to a few notes of a certain popular melody  which I had allowed to leave my lips, an added note or two which warned me that  my partner was somewhere hidden among the alleys of this very unaristocratic  quarter. Indeed, from the sound, I judged him to be in the rear of the doctor&rsquo;s  house and, being anxious to hear what he had to say before advancing upon the  door which might open my way to easy fortune or complete defeat, I paused a few  steps off and waited for his appearance.</p>
  <p>He  was at my elbow before I had either seen or heard him. He was always light of  foot, but this time he seemed to have no tread at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  here,&rdquo; was his comforting assurance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both?&rdquo;  I whispered back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  one else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  A boy drove away the buggy and has not come back. Sawbones keeps no girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the child quiet? Has there been no alarm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a breath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  cops in the neighborhood? No spies around?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one. We&rsquo;ve got it all this time. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nobody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the doctor; he&rsquo;s fastening up his house. I must hasten; nothing would induce me  to let that innocent remain under his roof all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not the windows he is at.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  door, the big front door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  gave my partner a surprised look, undoubtedly lost in the darkness, and drew a  step nearer the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  just the same old gloom-box,&rdquo; I exclaimed, and paused for an instant to mark the  changes which had taken place in the surroundings. They were very few and I  turned back to fix my eye on the front door where a rattling sound could be  heard, as of some one fingering the latch. It was this door which formed the  peculiarity of the house. In itself it was like any other that was  well-fashioned and solid, but it opened upon space&mdash;that is, if it was ever  opened, which I doubted. The stoop and even the railing which had once guarded  it, had all been removed, leaving a bare front, with this inhospitable entrance  shut against every one who had not the convenience for mounting to it by a  ladder. There was another way in, but this was round on one side, and did not  present itself to the eye unless one approached from the west end of the  street; so that to half the passers-by the house looked like a deserted one  till they came abreast of the flagged path which led to the office door. As the  windows had never been unclosed in my day and were not now, I took it for  granted that they had remained thus inhospitably shut during all the years of  my absence, which certainly offered but little encouragement to a man bent on  an errand which would soon take him into those dismal precincts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  goes on behind those shuttered windows?&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;I know of one thing, but  what else?&rdquo; The one thing was the counting of money and the arranging of  innumerable gold pieces on the great top of a baize-covered table in what I  should now describe as the back parlor. I remembered how he used to do it. I  caught him at it once, having crept up one windy night from my little room off  the office to see what kept the doctor up so late.</p>
  <p>As  I now stood listening in the dark street to those strange touches on a door  disused for years, I recalled the tremor with which I rounded the top of the  stair that night of long ago and the mingled fear and awe with which I  recognized, not only such a mint of money as I had never seen out of the bank  before, but the greedy and devouring passion with which he pushed the  glittering coins about and handled the bank-notes and gloated over the pile it  all made when drawn together by his hooked fingers, till the sound, perhaps, of  my breathing in the dark hall startled him with a thought of discovery, and his  two hands came together over that pile with a gesture more eloquent even than  the look with which he seemed to penetrate the very shadows in the silent space  wherein I stood. It was a vision short, but inexpressibly vivid, of the miser  incarnate, and having seen it and escaped detection, as was my undeserved luck  that night, I needed never to ask again why he had been willing to accept risks  from which most men shrink from fear if not from conscience. He loved money,  not as the spender loves it, openly and with luxurious instincts, but secretly  and with a knavish dread of discovery which spoke of treasure ill acquired.</p>
  <p>And  now he was seeking to add to his gains, and I stood on the outside of his house  listening to sounds I did not understand, instead of attempting to draw him to  the office-door by ringing the bell he never used to disconnect till nine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know that I don&rsquo;t quite like the noises which are being made up there?&rdquo;  came in a sudden whisper to my ear. &ldquo;Supposing it was the child trying to get  out! She does not know there is no stoop; she seemed sleeping or half-dead when  he carried her in, and if by any chance she has got hold of the key and the  door should open&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  I cried, starting forward in horror of the thought he had suggested. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> opening. I see a thread of light. What does it mean, Jupp? The child? No; there  is more than a child&rsquo;s strength in that push. Hist!&rdquo; Here I drew him flat  against the wall. The door above had swung back and some one was stamping on  the threshold over our heads in what appeared to be an outburst of ungovernable  fury.</p>
  <p>That  it was the doctor I could not doubt. But why this anger; why this mad gasping  after breath and the half-growl, half-cry, with which he faced the night and  the quiet of a street which to his glance, passing as it did over our heads,  must have appeared altogether deserted? We were consulting each other&rsquo;s faces  for some explanation of this unlooked-for outbreak, when the door above us  suddenly slammed to and we heard a renewal of that fumbling with lock and key  which had first drawn our attention. But the hand was not sure or the hall was  dark, for the key did not turn in the lock. Suddenly awake to my opportunity, I  wheeled Jupp about and, making use of his knee and back, climbed up till I was  enabled to reach the knob and turn it just as the man within had stepped back,  probably to procure more light.</p>
  <p>The  result was that the door swung open and I stumbled in, falling almost face  downward on the marble floor faintly checkered off to my sight in the dim light  of a lamp set far back in a bare and dismal hall. I was on my feet again in an  instant and it was in this manner, and with all the disadvantages of a hatless  head and a disordered countenance, that I encountered again my old employer  after five years of absence.</p>
  <p>He  did not recognize me. I saw it by the look of alarm which crossed his features  and the involuntary opening of his lips in what would certainly have been a  loud cry if I had not smiled and cried out with false gaiety:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, doctor, I never came in by that door before. Pardon my awkwardness. The  step is somewhat high from the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  smile is my own, they say; at all events it served to enlighten him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob  Trevitt,&rdquo; he exclaimed, but with a growl of displeasure I could hardly condemn  under the circumstances.</p>
  <p>I  hastened to push my advantage, for he was looking very threateningly toward the  door which was swaying gently and in an inviting way to a man who if old, had  more power in his arms than I had in my whole body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mr.</i> Trevitt,&rdquo; I corrected; &ldquo;and on a very important errand. I am here on behalf of  Mrs. Ocumpaugh, whose child you have at this moment under your roof.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
    Doctor Pool</b></h2>
  <p>It  was a direct attack and for a minute I doubted if I had not made a mistake in  making it so suddenly and without gloves. His face purpled, the veins on his  forehead started out, his great form shook with an ire that in such domineering  natures as his can only find relief in a blow. But the right hand did not rise  nor the heavy fist fall. With admirable self-restraint he faced me for a  moment, without attempting either protest or denial. Then his blazing eyes  cooled down, and with a sudden gesture which at once relaxed his extreme  tension of nerve and muscle, he pointed toward the end of the hall and remarked  with studied politeness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  office is below, as you know. Will you oblige me by following me there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  feared him, for I saw that studiously as he sought to hide his impressions, he  too regarded the moment as one of critical significance. But I assumed an air  of perfect confidence, merely observing as I left the neighborhood of the front  door and the proximity of Jupp:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have friends on the outside who are waiting for me; so you must not keep me too  long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was bending to take up the lamp from a small table near the basement stair as I  threw out these words in apparent carelessness, and the flash which shot from  under his shaggy brows was thus necessarily heightened by the glare in which he  stood. Yet with all allowances made I marked him down in my own mind as  dangerous, and was correspondingly surprised when he turned on the top step of  the narrow staircase I remembered so vividly from the experience I have before  named, and in the mildest of accents remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  stairs are a trifle treacherous. Be careful to grasp the hand-rail as you come  down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  the game deeper than I thought? In all my remembrance of him I had never before  seen him look benevolent, and it alarmed me, coming as it did after the  accusation I had made. I felt tempted to make a stand and demand that the  interview be held then and there. For I knew his subterranean office very well,  and how difficult it would be to raise a cry there which could be heard by any  one outside. Still, with a muttered, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I proceeded to follow him  down, only stopping once in the descent to listen for some sound by which I  could determine in which room of the many I knew to be on this floor the little  one lay, on whose behalf I was incurring a possible bullet from the pistol I  once saw lurking amongst bottles and corks in one of the innumerable drawers of  the doctor&rsquo;s table. But all was still around and overhead; too still for my  peace of mind, in which dreadful visions began to rise of a drugged or dying  child, panting out its innocent breath in darkness and solitude. Yet no. With  those thousands to be had for the asking, any man would be a fool to injure or  even seriously to frighten a child upon whose good condition they depended;  much less a miser whose whole heart was fixed on money.</p>
  <p>The  clock struck as I put foot on the landing; so much can happen in twenty minutes  when events crowd and the passions of men reach their boiling-point! I expected  to see the old man try that door, even to double bolt it as in the years gone  by. But he merely threw a look that way and proceeded on down the three or four  steps which led into the species of basement where he had chosen to fix his  office. In another moment that dim and dismal room broke upon my view under the  vague light of the small and poorly-trimmed lamp he carried. I saw again its  musty walls covered with books, where there were shelves laden with bottles and  a loose array of miscellaneous objects I had often handled but out of which I  never could make any meaning. I recognized it all and detected but few changes.  But these were startling ones. The old lounge standing under the two barred  windows which I had often likened in my own mind to those of a jail, had been  recovered; and lying on the table, which I had always regarded with a mixture  of awe and apprehension, I perceived something which I had never seen there  before: a Bible, with its edges worn and its leaves rumpled as if often and  eagerly handled.</p>
  <p>I  was so struck by this last discovery that I stopped, staring, in the doorway,  looking from the sacred volume to his worn but vigorous figure drawn up in the  middle of the room, with the lamp still in his hand and his small but brilliant  eyes fixed upon mine with a certain ironical glitter in them, which gave me my  first distrust of the part I had come there to play.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will waste no words,&rdquo; said he, setting down the lamp, and seizing with his  disengaged hand the long locks of his flowing beard. &ldquo;In what respect are you a  messenger from Mrs. Ocumpaugh, and what makes you think I have her child in  this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  found it easier to answer the last question first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know the child is here,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;because my partner saw you bring her in. I  have gone into the detective business since leaving you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was an astonishing edge to his smile and I felt that I should have to make the  most of that old discovery of mine, if I were to hold my own with this man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  may I ask,&rdquo; he coldly continued, &ldquo;how you have succeeded in connecting me with  this young child&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  straight as a string,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;You threatened the child to its face in the  hearing of its nurse some two weeks ago, on a certain bridge where you stopped  them. You even set the day when the little Gwendolen should pass from luxury to  poverty.&rdquo; Here I cast an involuntary glance about the room where the only sign  of comfort was the newly upholstered lounge. &ldquo;That day was the sixteenth, and  we all know what happened on that date. If this is not plain enough&mdash;&rdquo; I had  seen his lip curl&mdash;&ldquo;allow me to add, by way of explanation, that you have seen fit  to threaten Mrs. Ocumpaugh herself with this date, for I know well the hand  which wrote <i>August 16</i> on the bungalow floor and in various other places  about Homewood where her eye was likely to fall.&rdquo; And I let my own fall on a  sort of manuscript lying open not far from the Bible, which still looked so out  of place to me on this pagan-hearted old miser&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;Such chirography as  yours is not to be mistaken,&rdquo; I completed, with a short gesture toward the  disordered sheets he had left spread out to every eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. A detective without doubt. Did you play the detective here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last question leaped like a shot from his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not denied the threats to which I have just called your attention,&rdquo; was my  cautious reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  need of that?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Are you not a&mdash;<i>detective</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was sarcasm, as well as taunt in the way he uttered that last word. I was  conscious of being at a loss, but put a bold front on the matter and proceeded  as if conscious of no secret misgiving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you deny as well that you have been gone two days from this place? That during  this time a doctor&rsquo;s buggy, drawn by a horse I should know by description,  having harnessed him three times a day for two years, was seen by more than one  observer in the wake of a mysterious wagon from the interior of which a child&rsquo;s  crying could be heard? The wagon did not drive up to this house to-night, but  the buggy did, and from it you carried a child which you brought with you into  this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a sudden down-bringing of his old but powerful hand on the top of the table  before him, he seemed about to utter an oath or some angry invective. But again  he controlled himself, and eying me without any show of shame or even of desire  to contradict any of my assertions, he quietly declared:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are after that reward, I observe. Well, you won&rsquo;t get it. Like many others of  your class you can follow a trail, but the insight to start right and to end in  triumphant success is given only to a genius, and you are not a genius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a blush I could not control, I advanced upon him, crying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have forestalled me. You have telegraphed or telephoned to Mr. Atwater&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not left my house since I came in here three hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;  I began.</p>
  <p>But  he hushed me with a look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not a matter of money,&rdquo; he declared almost with dignity. &ldquo;Those who think to  reap dollars from the distress which has come upon the Ocumpaugh family will  eat ashes for their pains. Money will be spent, but none of it earned, unless  you, or such as you, are hired at so much an hour to&mdash;follow trails.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Greatly  astounded not only by the attitude he took, but by the calm and almost  indifferent way in which he mentioned what I had every reason to believe to be  the one burning object of his existence, I surveyed him with undisguised astonishment  till another thought, growing out of the silence of the many-roomed house above  us, gripped me with secret dread; and I exclaimed aloud and without any attempt  at subterfuge:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is dead, then! the child is dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know,&rdquo; was his reply.</p>
  <p>The  four words were uttered with undeniable gloom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not know?&rdquo; I echoed, conscious that my jaw had fallen, and that I was  staring at him with fright in my eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I wish I did. I would give half of my small savings to know where that innocent  baby is to-night. Sit down!&rdquo; he vehemently commanded. &ldquo;You do not understand  me, I see. You confound the old Doctor Pool with the new.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  confound nothing,&rdquo; I violently retorted in strong revulsion against what I had  now come to look upon as the attempt of a subtile actor to turn aside my  suspicions and brave out a dangerous situation by a ridiculous subterfuge. &ldquo;I  understand the miser whom I have beheld gloating over his hoard in the room  above, and I understand the doctor who for money could lend himself to a fraud,  the secret results of which are agitating the whole country at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo;  The word came with difficulty. &ldquo;So you <i>did</i> play the detective, even as a  boy. Pity I had not recognized your talents at the time. But no&mdash;&rdquo; he  contradicted himself with great rapidity; &ldquo;I was not a redeemed soul then; I  might have done you harm. I might have had more if not worse sins to atone for  than I have now.&rdquo; And with scant appearance of having noted the doubtful manner  in which I had received this astonishing outburst, he proceeded to cry aloud  and with a commanding gesture: &ldquo;Quit this. You have undertaken more than you  can handle. You, a messenger from Mrs. Ocumpaugh? Never. You are but the  messenger of your own cupidity; and cupidity leads by the straightest of roads  directly down to hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  you proved six long years ago. Lead me to the child I believe to be in this  house or I will proclaim aloud the pact you entered into then&mdash;a pact to which I  was an involuntary witness whose word, however, will not go for less on that  account. Behind the curtain still hanging over that old closet I stood while&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  hand had seized my arm with a grip few could have proceeded under.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  rest was whispered in my ear.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="c00050-images/page090.jpg" width="564" height="750"></p>
  <p>I  nodded and felt that he was mine now. But the laugh which the next minute broke  from his lips dashed my assurance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the ways of the world!&rdquo; he cried. Then in a different tone and not without  reverence: &ldquo;Oh, the ways of God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  made no reply. For every reason I felt that the next word must come from him.</p>
  <p>It  was an unexpected one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was Doctor Pool unregenerate and more heedful of the things of this world than  of those of the world to come. You have to deal with quite a different man now.  It is of that very sin I am now repenting in sackcloth and ashes. I live but to  expiate it. Something has been done toward accomplishing this, but not enough.  I have been played upon, used. This I will avenge. New sin is a poor apology  for an old one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  scarcely heeded him. I was again straining my ears to catch a smothered sob or  a frightened moan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you listening for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the sound of little Gwendolen&rsquo;s voice. It is worth fifty thousand dollars, you  remember. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I listen for it? Besides, I have a real and  uncontrollable sympathy for the child. I am determined to restore her to her  home. Your blasphemous babble of a changed heart does not affect me. You are  after a larger haul than the sum offered by Mr. Ocumpaugh. You want some of  Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s fortune. I have suspected it from the first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want? Little you know what I want&rdquo;&mdash;then quickly, convincingly: &ldquo;You are  strangely deceived. Little Miss Ocumpaugh is not here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that I hear, then?&rdquo; was the quick retort with which I hailed the sigh,  unmistakably from infantile lips, which now rose from some place very much  nearer us than the hollow regions overhead toward which my ears had been so  long turned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo;  He flashed with uncontrollable passion, and if I am not mistaken clenched his  hands so violently as to bury his nails in his flesh. &ldquo;Would you like to see  what that is? Come!&rdquo;&mdash;and taking up the lamp, he moved, much to my surprise as  well as to my intense interest, toward the door of the small cupboard where I  had myself slept when in his service.</p>
  <p>That  he still meditated some deviltry which would call for my full presence of mind  to combat successfully, I did not in the least doubt. Yet the agitation under  which I crossed the floor was more the result of an immediate anticipation of  seeing&mdash;and in this place of all others in the world&mdash;the child about whom my  thoughts had clung so persistently for forty-two hours, than of any results to  myself in the way of injury or misfortune. Though the room was small and my  passage across it necessarily short, I had time to remember Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s  pitiful countenance as I saw it gazing in agony of expectation from her window  overlooking the river, and to catch again the sounds, less true and yet  strangely thrilling, of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s voice as she said: &ldquo;A tragedy at my doors  and I occupied with my own affairs!&rdquo; Nor was this all. A recollection of Miss  Graham&rsquo;s sorrow came up before my eyes also, and, truest of all, most  penetrating to me of all the loves which seemed to encompass this rare and  winsome infant, the infinite tenderness with which I once saw Mr. Ocumpaugh  lift her to his breast, during one of my interviews with him at Homewood.</p>
  <p>All  this before the door had swung open. Afterward, I saw nothing and thought of  nothing but the small figure lying in the spot where I had once pillowed my own  head, and with no more luxuries or even comforts about her than had been my lot  under this broad but by no means hospitable roof.</p>
  <p>A  bare wall, a narrow cot, a table with a bottle and glass on it and the child in  the bed&mdash;that was all. But God knows, it was enough to me at that breathless  moment; and advancing eagerly, I was about to stoop over the little head sunk  deep in its pillow, when the old man stepped between and with a short laugh  remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no such hurry. I have something to say first, in explanation of the anger you  have seen me display; an anger which is unseemly in a man professing to have  conquered the sins and passions of lost humanity. I did follow this child. You  were right in saying that it was my horse and buggy which were seen in the wake  of the wagon which came from the region of Homewood and lost itself in the  cross-roads running between the North River and the Sound. For two days and a  night I followed it, through more difficulties than I could relate in an hour,  stopping in lonely woods, or at wretched taverns, watching, waiting for the  transfer of the child, whose destination I was bound to know even if it cost me  a week of miserable travel without comfortable food or decent lodging. I could  hear the child cry out from time to time&mdash;an assurance that I was not following  a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp&mdash;but not till to-day, not till very late to-day, did any  words pass between me and the man and woman who drove the wagon. At Fordham,  just as I suspected them of making final efforts to escape me, they came to a  halt and I saw the man get out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  immediately got out too. As we faced each other, I demanded what the matter  was. He appeared reckless. &lsquo;Are you a doctor?&rsquo; he asked. I assured him that I  was. At which he blurted out: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;ve been following us so  long, and I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ve got a job for you. A child in our wagon is ill.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a start I attempted to look over the old man&rsquo;s shoulder toward the bed. But the  deep, if irregular, breathing of the child reassured me, and I turned to hear  the doctor out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  gave me my chance. &lsquo;Let me see her,&rsquo; I cried. The man&rsquo;s eye lowered. I did not  like his face at all. &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s anything serious,&rsquo; he growled, &lsquo;I shall cut. It  isn&rsquo;t my flesh and blood nor yet my old woman&rsquo;s there. You&rsquo;ll have to find some  place for the brat besides my wagon if it&rsquo;s anything that won&rsquo;t get cured  without nu&rsquo;ssin&rsquo;. So come along and have a look.&rsquo; I followed him, perfectly  determined to take the child under my own care, sick or well. &lsquo;Where were you  going to take her?&rsquo; I asked. I didn&rsquo;t ask who she was; why should I? &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t  know as I am obliged to tell,&rsquo; was his surly reply. &lsquo;Where we are going oursel&rsquo;s,&rsquo;  he reluctantly added. &lsquo;But not to nu&rsquo;ss. I&rsquo;ve no time for nu&rsquo;ssin&rsquo; brats, nor  my wife neither. We have a journey to make. Sarah!&rsquo;&mdash;this to his wife, for by  this time we were beside the wagon,&mdash;&rsquo;lift up the flap and hold the youngster&rsquo;s  hand out. Here&rsquo;s a doctor who will tell us if it&rsquo;s fever or not.&rsquo; A puny hand  and wrist were thrust out. I felt the pulse and then held out my arms. &lsquo;Give me  the child,&rsquo; I commanded. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s sick enough for a hospital.&rsquo; A grunt from the  woman within, an oath from the man, and a bundle was presently put in my arms,  from which a little moan escaped as I strode with it toward my buggy. &lsquo;I do not  ask your name,&rsquo; I called back to the man who reluctantly followed me. &lsquo;Mine is  Doctor Pool and I live in Yonkers.&rsquo; He muttered something about not peachin&rsquo; on  a poor man who was really doin&rsquo; an unfortunate a kindness, and then slunk  hurriedly back and was gone, wagon, wife and all, by the time I had whipped up  my tired old nag and turned about toward Yonkers. But I had the child safe and  sound in my arms, and my fears of its fate were relieved. It was not well, but  I anticipated nothing serious. When it moaned I pressed it a little closer to  my breast and that was all. In three-quarters of an hour we were in Yonkers. In  fifteen minutes I had it on this bed, and had begun to unroll the shawl in  which it was closely wrapped. Did you ever see the child about whom there has  been all this coil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  about three years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  years! I have seen her within a fortnight; yet I could carry that young one in  my arms for a whole hour without the least suspicion that I was making a fool  of myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quickly  slipping aside, he allowed me to approach the bed and take my first look at the  sleeping child&rsquo;s face. It was a sweet one but I did not need the hint he had  given me to find the features strange, and lacking every characteristic of  those of Gwendolen Ocumpaugh. Yet as the cutting off of the hair will often  change the whole aspect of the face&mdash;and this child&rsquo;s hair was short&mdash;I was  stooping in great excitement to notice more particularly the contour of cheek  and chin which had given individuality to the little heiress, when the doctor  touched me on the arm and drew my attention to a pair of little trousers and a  shirt which were hanging on the door behind me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  are the clothes I came upon under that great shawl. The child I have been  following and whom I have brought into my house under the impression it was  Gwendolen Ocumpaugh is not even a girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  &ldquo;Find The Child!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>I  could well understand the wrath to which this man had given way, by the feeling  which now took hold of my own breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  boy!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  incredulous, I leaned over the child and lifted into the full light of the lamp  one of the little hands I saw lying outside of the coverlet. There was no  mistaking it for a girl&rsquo;s hand, let alone a little lady&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  we are both fools!&rdquo; I vociferated in my unbounded indignation, careful however  to lay the small hand gently back on the panting breast. And turning away both  from the doctor and his small patient, I strolled back into the office.</p>
  <p>The  bubble whose gay colors I had followed with such avidity had burst in my face  with a vengeance.</p>
  <p>But  once from under the influence of the doctor&rsquo;s sarcastic eye, my better nature  reasserted itself. Wheeling about, I threw this question back:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that is a boy and a stranger, where is Gwendolen Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  moan from the bed and a hurried movement on the part of the doctor, who took  this opportunity to give the child another dose of medicine, were my sole  response. Waiting till the doctor had finished his task and drawn back from the  bedside, I repeated the question and with increased emphasis:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where,  then, is Gwendolen Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  the doctor did not answer, though he turned my way and even stepped forward;  his long visage, cadaverous from fatigue and the shock of his disappointment,  growing more and more somber as he advanced.</p>
  <p>When  he came to a stand by the table, I asked again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the child idolized by Mr. Ocumpaugh and mourned to such a degree by his  almost maddened wife that they say she will die if the little girl is not  found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  threat in my tones brought a response at last,&mdash;a response which astonished me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  I not said that I do not know? Do you not believe me? Do you think me as blind  to-day to truth and honor as I was six years ago? Have you no idea of repentance  and regeneration from sin? You are a detective. Find me that child. You shall  have money&mdash;hundreds&mdash;thousands&mdash;if you can bring me proofs of her being yet  alive. If the Hudson has swallowed her&mdash;&rdquo; here his figure rose, dilated and took  on a majesty which impressed itself upon me through all my doubts&mdash;&ldquo;I will have  vengeance on whoever has thus dared the laws of God and man as I would on the  foulest murderer in the foulest slums of that city which breeds wickedness in  high places as in low. I lock hands no longer with Belial. Find me the child,  or make me at least to know the truth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no doubting the passion which drove these words hot from his lips. I  recognized at last the fanatic whom Miss Graham had so graphically described in  relating her extraordinary adventure on the bridge; and met him with this one  question, which was certainly a vital one:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  dropped a shoe from the little one&rsquo;s closet, into the water under the dock? Did  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  His reply came quick and sharp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  I insisted, &ldquo;you have had something to do with this child&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not answer. A sullen look was displacing the fire of resolve in the eyes I  saw sinking slowly before mine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not acknowledge it,&rdquo; he muttered; adding, however, in what was little short  of a growl: &ldquo;Not yet, not till it becomes my duty to avenge innocent blood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  foretold the date.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drop  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were in league with the abductor,&rdquo; I persisted. &ldquo;I declare to your face, in  spite of all the vaunted scruples with which you seek to blind me to your  guilt, that you were in league with the abductor, knowing what money Mrs.  Ocumpaugh would pay. Only he was too smart for you, and perhaps too  unscrupulous. You would stop short of murder, now that you have got religion.  But his conscience is not so nice and so you fear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not know what I fear and I am not going to tell you. It is enough that I am  conscious of my own uprightness and that I say, Find the child! You have  incentive enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was true and it was growing stronger every minute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confine  yourself to such clues as are apparent to every eye,&rdquo; he now admonished me with  an eagerness that seemed real. &ldquo;If they are pointed by some special knowledge  you believe yourself to have gained, that is all the better&mdash;perhaps. I do not  propose to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  saw that he had uttered his ultimatum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I have, nevertheless, one more question to ask which relates to  those very clues. You can not refuse to answer it if you are really desirous of  aiding me in my efforts. Where did you first come upon the wagon which you  followed so many hours in the belief that it held Gwendolen Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  mused a moment with downcast head, his nervous frame trembling with the force  with which he threw his whole weight on the hand he held outspread on the table  before him. Then he calmly replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell you that. At the gate of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s grounds. You know them? They  adjoin the Ocumpaughs&rsquo; on the left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  surprise made me lower my head but not so quickly that I did not catch the  oblique glint of his eye as he mentioned the name which I was so little  prepared to hear in this connection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was in my buggy on the highroad,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;There was a constant passing  by of all kinds of vehicles on their way to and from the Ocumpaugh entertainment,  but none that attracted my attention till I caught sight of the covered wagon I  have endeavored to describe, being driven out of the adjoining grounds. Then I  pricked up my ears, for a child was crying inside in the smothered way that  tells of a hand laid heavily over the mouth. I thought I knew what child this  was, but you have been a witness to my disappointment after forty-eight hours  of travel behind that wretched wagon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  came out of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s grounds?&rdquo; I repeated, ignoring everything but the one  important fact. &ldquo;And during the time, you say, when Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s guests  were assembling? Did you see any other vehicle leave by the same gate at or  before that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a carriage. It appeared to have no one in it. Indeed, I know that it was empty,  for I peered into it as it rolled by me down the street. Of course I do not  know what might have been under the seats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  was my sharp retort. &ldquo;That was the carriage in which Mrs. Carew had come up  from the train. Did it pass out before the wagon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  by some minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is nothing, then, to be gained by that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  does not seem to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  his accent in uttering this simple phrase peculiar? I looked up to make sure.  But his face, which had been eloquent with one feeling or another during every  minute of this long interview till the present instant, looked strangely  impassive, and I did not know how to press the question hovering on my lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have given me a heavy task,&rdquo; I finally remarked, &ldquo;and you offer very little  assistance in the way of conjecture. Yet you must have formed some.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  toyed with his beard, combing it with his nervous, muscular fingers, and as I  watched how he lingered over the tips, caressing them before he dropped them, I  felt that he was toying with my perplexities in much the same fashion and with  an equal satisfaction. Angry and out of all patience with him, I blurted out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will do without your aid. I will solve this mystery and earn your money if not  that of Mr. Ocumpaugh, with no assistance save that afforded by my own wits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect you will,&rdquo; he retorted; and for the first time since I burst in upon him  like one dropping from the clouds through the unapproachable doorway on the  upper floor, he lost that look of extreme tension which had nerved his aged  figure into something of the aspect of youth. With it vanished his  impressiveness. It was simply a tired old man I now followed upstairs to the  side door. As I paused to give him a final nod and an assurance of intended  good faith toward him, he made a kindly enough gesture in the direction of my  old room below and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  worry about the little fellow down there. He&rsquo;ll come out all right. I shan&rsquo;t  visit on him the extravagance of my own folly. I am a Christian now.&rdquo; And with  this encouraging remark he closed the door and I found myself alone in the dark  alley.</p>
  <p>My  first sense of relief came from the coolness of the night air on my flushed  forehead and cheeks. After the stifling atmosphere of this underground room,  reeking with the fumes of the lamp and the heat of a struggle which his dogged  confidence in himself had made so unequal, it was pleasurable just to sense the  quiet and the cool of the night and feel myself released from the bondage of a  presence from which I had frequently recoiled but had never thoroughly felt the  force of till to-night; my next, from the touch and voice of my partner who at  that moment rose from before the basement windows where he had evidently been  lying for a long time outstretched.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  have you two been doing down there?&rdquo; was his very natural complaint. &ldquo;I tried  to listen, I tried to see; but beyond a few scattered words when your voices  rose to an excited pitch, I have learned nothing but that you were in no danger  save from the overthrow of your scheme. That has failed, has it not? You would  have interrupted me long ago if you had found the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I acknowledged, drawing him down the alley, &ldquo;I have failed for to-night, but I  start afresh to-morrow. Though how I can rest idle for nine hours, not knowing  under what roof, if under any, that doomed innocent may be lying, I do not  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must rest; you are staggering with fatigue now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it, only with uncertainty. I don&rsquo;t see my way. Let us go down street  and see if any news has come over the wires since I left Homewood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  first, what a spooky old house that is! And what did the old gentleman have to  say of your tumbling in on him from space without a &lsquo;By your leave&rsquo; or even an &lsquo;Excuse  me&rsquo;? Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  told him enough to allay his curiosity. That was all I thought necessary,&mdash;and  he seemed satisfied. Jupp is a good fellow, quite willing to confine himself to  his particular end of the business which does not include the thinking end. Why  should it?</p>
  <p>There  was no news&mdash;this we soon learned&mdash;only some hints of a contemplated move on the  part of the police in a district where some low characters had been seen  dragging along a resisting child of an unexpectedly refined appearance. As no  one could describe this child and as I had refused from the first to look upon  this case as one of ordinary abduction, I laid little stress on the report,  destined though it was to appear under startling head-lines on the morrow, and  startled my more credulous partner quite out of his usual equanimity, by ordering  him on our arrival at the station to buy me a ticket for &mdash;, as I was going back  to Homewood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Homewood, so late!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  It will not be late there&mdash;or if it is, anxious hearts make light sleepers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  shoulders rose a trifle, but he bought the ticket.</p>

  &ldquo;Philo! Philo! Philo!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Never  have I felt a weirder sensation than when I stepped from the cars on to the  solitary platform from which a few hours before I had seen the little  nursery-governess depart for New York. The train, soon to disappear in the  darkness of the long perspective, was all that gave life and light to the  scene, and when it was gone, nothing remained to relieve the gloom or to break  the universal stillness save the quiet lap of the water and the moaning of the  wind through the trees which climbed the heights to Homewood.</p>
  <p>I  had determined to enter if possible by way of the private path, though I  expected to find it guarded against just such intrusion. In approaching it I  was given a full view of the river and thus was in a position to note that the  dock and adjoining banks were no longer bright with lanterns in the hands of  eager men bending with fixed eyes over the flowing waters. The search which had  kept so many busy at this spot for well on to two days had been abandoned; and  the darkness seemed doubly dark and the silence doubly oppressive in contrast.</p>
  <p>Yet  hope spoke in the abandonment; and with renewed spirit and a more than lively  courage, I turned toward the little gate through which I had passed twice  before that day. As I expected, a silent figure rose up from the shadows to  prevent me; but it fell back at the mention of my name and business, thus  proving the man to be in the confidence of Mrs. Ocumpaugh or, at the least, in  that of Miss Porter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am come for a social chat with the coachman,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;Lights burn late in  such extensive stables. Don&rsquo;t worry about me. The people at the house are in  sympathy with my investigation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  we stretch the truth at great crises.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;But keep away from the house. Our orders are  imperative to allow no one to approach it again to-night, except with the child  in hand or with such news as would gain instant admission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trust  me,&rdquo; said I, as I went up the steps.</p>
  <p>It  was so dark between the hedge-rows that my ascent became mere groping. I had a  lantern in my pocket which I had taken from Jupp, but I did not choose to make  use of it. I preferred to go on and up, trusting to my instinct to tell me when  I had reached a fresh flight of steps.</p>
  <p>A  gleam of light from Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s upper windows was the first intimation I  received that I was at the top of the bank, and in another moment I was  opposite the gap in the hedge opening upon her grounds.</p>
  <p>For  no particular reason that I know of, I here paused and took a long survey of  what was, after all, nothing but a cluster of shadows broken here and there by  squares of subdued light I felt a vague desire to enter&mdash;to see and talk again  with the charming woman whose personality had made such an impression upon me,  if only to understand the peculiar feelings which those indistinguishable walls  awakened, and why such a sense of anticipation should disturb my admiration of  this woman and the delight which I had experienced in every accent of her  trained and exquisite voice.</p>
  <p>I was  standing very still and in almost total darkness. The shock, therefore, was  great when, in finally making up my mind to move, I became conscious of a  presence near me, totally indiscernible and as silent as myself.</p>
  <p>Whose?</p>
  <p>No  watchman, or he would have spoken at the rustle I made stumbling back against  the hedge-row. Some marauder, then, or a detective, like myself? I would not  waste time in speculating; better to decide the question at once, for the  situation was eery, the person, whoever he was, stood so near and so still, and  so directly in the way of my advance.</p>
  <p>Drawing  the lantern from my pocket, I pushed open the slide and flashed the light on  the immovable figure before me. The face I beheld staring into mine was one  quite unknown to me, but as I took in its expression, my arm gradually fell,  and with it the light from the man&rsquo;s features, till face and form were lost  again in the darkness, leaving in my disturbed mind naught but an impression;  but such an impression!</p>
  <p>The  countenance thus flashed upon my vision must have been a haunting one at any  time, but seen as I saw it, at a moment of extreme self-abandonment, the effect  was startling. Yet I had sufficient control over myself to utter a word or two  of apology, which was not answered, if it was even heard.</p>
  <p>A  more exact description may be advisable. The person whom I thus encountered  hesitating before Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s house was a man of meager build, sloping  shoulders and handsome but painfully pinched features. That he was a gentleman  of culture and the nicest refinement was evident at first glance; that this  culture and refinement were at this moment under the dominion of some fierce  thought or resolve was equally apparent, giving to his look an absorption which  the shock attending the glare I had thus suddenly thrown on his face could not  immediately dispel.</p>
  <p>Dazed  by an encounter for which he seemed even less prepared than myself, he stood  with his heart in his face, if I may so speak, and only gradually came to  himself as the sense of my proximity forced itself in upon his suffering and  engrossed mind. When I saw that he had quite emerged from his dream, I dropped  the light. But I did not forget his look; I did not forget the man, though I  hastened to leave him, in my desire to fulfill the purpose for which I had  entered these grounds at so late an hour.</p>
  <p>My  plan was, as I have said, to visit the Ocumpaugh stables and have a chat with  the coachman. I had no doubt of my welcome and not much doubt of myself. Yet as  I left the vicinity of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s cottage and came upon the great house of  the Ocumpaughs looming in the moonlight above its marble terraces, I felt  impressed as never before both by the beauty and magnificence of the noble  pile, and shrank with something like shame from the presumption which had led  me to pit my wits against a mystery having its birth in so much grandeur and  material power. The prestige of great wealth as embodied in this superb  structure well-nigh awed me from my task and I was passing the twin pergolas  and flower-bordered walks with hesitating foot, when I heard through one of the  open windows a cry which made me forget everything but our common heritage of  sorrow and the equal hold it has on high and low.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philo!&rdquo;  the voice rang out in a misery to wring the heart of the most callous. &ldquo;Philo!  Philo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s name called aloud by his suffering wife. Was she in delirium? It  would seem so; but why Philo! always Philo! and not once Gwendolen?</p>
  <p>With  hushed steps, ears ringing and heart palpitating with new and indefinable sensations,  I turned into the road to the stables.</p>
  <p>There  were men about and I caught one glimpse of a maid&rsquo;s pretty head looking from  one of the rear windows, but no one stopped me, and I reached the stable just  as a man came sauntering out to take his final look at the weather.</p>
  <p>It  was the fellow I sought, Thomas the coachman.</p>
  <p>I  had not miscalculated the nature of my man. In ten minutes we were seated  together on an open balcony, smoking and beguiling the time with a little  harmless gossip. After a free and easy discussion of the great event, mingled  with the naturally-to-be-expected criticism of the police, we proceeded under  my guidance to those particulars for which I had risked losing this very  valuable hour.</p>
  <p>He  mentioned Mrs. Ocumpaugh; I mentioned Mrs. Carew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  beautiful woman,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p>I  thought he looked astonished. &ldquo;<i>She</i> beautiful?&rdquo; was his doubtful  rejoinder. &ldquo;What do you think of Mrs. Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is handsome, too, but in a different way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so. I&rsquo;ve driven rich and I&rsquo;ve driven poor. I&rsquo;ve even sat on the  box in front of an English duchess, but never have I seen such features as Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s why I consent to drive an American millionaire&rsquo;s wife when  I might be driving the English nobility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  statue!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;cold!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough, but one you never tire of looking at. Besides, she can light up  wonderfully. I&rsquo;ve seen her when she was all a-quiver, and lovely as the  loveliest. And when do you think that was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  she had her child in her arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  spoke in lowered tones as befitted the suggestion and the circumstances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he drawled, between thoughtful puffs of smoke; &ldquo;when Mr. Ocumpaugh sat on the  seat beside her. This, when I was driving the victoria. I often used to make  excuse for turning my head about so as to catch a glimpse of her smile at some  fine view and the way she looked up at him to see if he was enjoying it as much  as she. I like women who love their husbands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she has nothing to complain of in him. He worships the ground she walks on; and  he more than worshiped the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here <i>his</i> voice fell.</p>
  <p>I  brought the conversation back as quickly as I could to Mrs. Carew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  like pale women,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Now I like a woman who looks plain one minute, and  perfectly charming the next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what people say of Mrs. Carew. I know of lots who admire that kind. The little  girl for one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gwendolen?  Was she attracted to Mrs. Carew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Attracted?  I&rsquo;ve seen her go to her from her mother&rsquo;s lap like a bird to its nest. Many a  time have I driven the carriage with Mrs. Ocumpaugh sitting up straight inside,  and her child curled up in this other woman&rsquo;s arms with not a look or word for  her mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did Mrs. Ocumpaugh seem to like that?&rdquo; I asked between puffs of my cigar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she&rsquo;s one of the cold ones, you know! At least you say so; but I feel sure that  for the last three years&mdash;that is, ever since this woman came into the  neighborhood&mdash;her heart has been slowly breaking. This last blow will kill her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought of the moaning cry of &ldquo;Philo! Philo!&rdquo; which at intervals I still seemed  to hear issue from that upper window in the great house, and felt that there  might be truth in his fears.</p>
  <p>But  it was of Mrs. Carew I had come to talk and not of Mrs. Ocumpaugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Children&rsquo;s  fancies are unaccountable,&rdquo; I sententiously remarked; &ldquo;but perhaps there is  some excuse for this one. Mrs. Carew has what you call magnetism&mdash;a personality  which I should imagine would be very appealing to a child. I never saw such  expression in a human face. Whatever her mood, she impresses each passing  feeling upon you as the one reality of her life. I can not understand such  changes, but they are very fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they are easy enough to understand in her case. She was an actress once. I  myself have seen her on the stage&mdash;in London. I used to admire her there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  actress!&rdquo; I repeated, somewhat taken aback.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I forget what name she played under. But she&rsquo;s a very great lady now; in with  all the swells and rich enough to own a yacht if she wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  a widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, a widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  let a moment of silence pass, then nonchalantly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  is she going to Europe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this was too much for my simple-hearted friend. He neither knew nor had any  conjecture ready. But I saw that he did not deplore her resolve. His reason for  this presently appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the little one is found, the mother will want all her caresses. Let Mrs. Carew  hug the boy that God in his mercy has thrown into her arms and leave other  children to their mothers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  rose to leave, when I bethought me and stopped to ask another question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the gentleman I have seen about here&mdash;a man with a handsome face, but very  pale and thin in his appearance, so much so that it is quite noticeable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean Mr. Rathbone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know his name. A light complexioned man, who looks as if greatly  afflicted by some disease or secret depression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that is Mr. Rathbone, sure. He is sickly-looking enough and not without his  trouble, too. They say&mdash;but it&rsquo;s all gossip, of course&mdash;that he has set his heart  on the widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Carew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, who else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  she would be a fool to care for him, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thomas  laughed&mdash;a little uneasily, I could not help thinking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid we&rsquo;re talking scandal,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You know the relationship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  relationship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  his relationship to the family. He is Gwendolen&rsquo;s cousin and I have heard it  said that he&rsquo;s named after her in Madam Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,  I see! The next heir, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  to the Rathbone property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that if she is not found&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  sickly man, in that case, would be well worth the marrying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Mrs. Carew so fond of money as all that? I thought she was a woman of property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is; but it takes money to make some men interesting. He isn&rsquo;t handsome enough,  or independent enough to go entirely on his own merits. Besides, he has a troop  of relatives hanging on to him&mdash;blood-suckers who more than eat up his salary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  business man, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  in some New York house. He was always very fond of Gwendolen, and I am not  surprised to hear that he is very much cut up by our trouble. I always thought  well of Mr. Rathbone myself,&rdquo;&mdash;which same ended the conversation so far as my  interest in it was concerned.</p>

    The Bungalow</b></h2>
  <p>As  soon as I could break away and leave him I did, and betook myself to Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s  house. My resolve was taken. Late as it was, I would attempt an interview with  her. The lights still burning above and below gave me the necessary courage.  Yet I was conscious of some embarrassment in presenting my name to the  astonished maid, who was in the act of extinguishing the hall-light when my  vigorous ring prevented her. Seeing her doubtful look and the hesitation with  which she held the door, I told her that I would wait outside on the porch till  she had carried up my name to Mrs. Carew. This seemed to relieve her and in a  moment I was standing again under the vines waiting for permission to enter the  house. It came very soon, and I had to conquer a fresh embarrassment at the  sight of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s nimble and gracious figure descending the stairs in all  eagerness to greet me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; she asked, running hastily forward so that we met in the center of the  hall. &ldquo;Good news? Nothing else could have brought you back again so soon&mdash;and at  an hour so late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a dangerous na&iuml;vet&eacute; in the way she uttered the last three words which made  me suspect the actress. Indeed I was quite conscious as I met her thrilling and  expressive glance, that I should never feel again the same confidence in her  sincerity. My judgment had been confounded and my insight rendered helpless by  what I had heard of her art, and the fact that she had once been a capable  player of &ldquo;parts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  I was man enough and detective enough not to betray my suspicion, now that I  was brought face to face with her. It had always been latent in my breast, even  in the very midst of my greatest admiration for her. Yet I had never  acknowledged to myself of what I suspected her, nor did I now&mdash;not quite&mdash;not  enough to give that point to my attack which would have insured me immediate  victory or defeat. I was obliged to feel my way and so answered, with every  appearance of friendly confidence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear then that I shall be obliged to ask your pardon. I have no good news;  rather what might be called, if not bad, of a very perplexing character. The  child has been traced&rdquo;&mdash;here I purposely let my voice halt for an instant&mdash;&ldquo;here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;  her eyes opened, her lips parted in a look of surprise so ingenuous that  involuntarily I felt forced to add, by way of explanation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child, I mean, who was carried screaming along the highway in a wagon and for  whom the police&mdash;and others&mdash;have for two days been looking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she ejaculated with a slight turn of her head aside as she motioned me toward a  chair. &ldquo;And is that child Gwendolen? Or don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; She was all eagerness  as she again faced me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will be known to-morrow,&rdquo; I rejoined, resisting the beautiful brightness of her  face with an effort that must have left its mark on my own features; for she  smiled with unconscious triumph as she held my eyes for a minute in hers saying  softly, &ldquo;O how you excite me! Tell me more. Where was the wagon found? Who is  with it? And how much of all this have you told Mrs. Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  the last question she had risen, involuntarily, it seemed, and as though she would  rush to her friend if I did not at once reassure her of that friend&rsquo;s knowledge  of a fact which seemed to throw a gleam of hope upon a situation hitherto  entirely unrelieved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Ocumpaugh has been told nothing,&rdquo; I hastily returned, answering the last and  most important question first. &ldquo;Nor must she be; at least not till certainty  replaces doubt. She is in a critical state, I am told. To rouse her hopes  to-night only to dash them again to-morrow would be cruel policy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  her eyes still on my face, Mrs. Carew slowly reseated herself. &ldquo;Then there are  doubts,&rdquo; she faltered; &ldquo;doubts of its being Gwendolen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is always doubt,&rdquo; I replied, and openly paused in manifest non-committal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she somewhat wildly exclaimed, covering her face with her hands&mdash;beautiful hands  covered with jewels&mdash;&ldquo;what suspense! what bitter and cruel suspense! I feel it  almost as much as if it were my Harry!&rdquo; was the final cry with which she  dropped them again. And she did feel it. Her features had blanched and her form  was shaking. &ldquo;But you have not answered my questions as to where this wagon is  at present and under whose care? Can&rsquo;t you see how anxious I must be about  that&mdash;if it should prove to be Gwendolen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Carew, if I could tell you that, I could tell you more; we shall both have to  wait till to-morrow. Meanwhile, I have a favor to ask. Have you by any chance  the means of entrance to the bungalow? I have a great and inappeasable desire  to see for myself if all the nooks and corners of that place have given up their  secrets. It&rsquo;s an egotistical desire, no doubt&mdash;and may strike you as folly of  the rankest&mdash;but we detectives have learned to trust nobody in our  investigations, and I shall never be satisfied till I have looked this whole  spot over inch by inch for the clue which may yet remain there. If there is a  clue I must find it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clue?&rdquo;  She was looking at me a little breathlessly. &ldquo;Clue to what? Then she wasn&rsquo;t in  the wagon; you are still seeking her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always  seeking her,&rdquo; I put in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  surely not in the bungalow!&rdquo; Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s expression was one of extreme  surprise. &ldquo;What can you find there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know. But I want to look. I can go to the house for a key, but it is  late; and it seems unpardonable to disturb Mrs. Ocumpaugh. Yet I shall have to  do this if you have not a key; for I shall not sleep till I have satisfied  myself that nothing can be discovered on the immediate scene of Gwendolen&rsquo;s  disappearance, to help forward the rescue we both are so intent upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right,&rdquo; was the hesitating reply I received. &ldquo;I have a key; I will fetch it  and if you do not mind, I will accompany you to the bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  would give me greater pleasure,&rdquo; I replied with my best bow; white lies come  easy in our trade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not keep you a minute,&rdquo; she said, rising and going into the hall. But in  an instant she was back. &ldquo;A word to my maid and a covering for my head,&rdquo; she  explained, &ldquo;and I will be with you.&rdquo; Her manner pointed unmistakably to the  door.</p>
  <p>I  had no alternative but to step out on the porch to await her. But she was true  to her word and in a moment she had joined me, with the key in her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  what adventures!&rdquo; was her breathless cry. &ldquo;Shall I ever forget this dreadful,  this interminable week! But it is dark. Even the moon is clouded over. How  shall we see? There are no lights in the bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a lantern in my pocket. My only hope is that no stray gleam from it may  pierce the shrubbery and bring the police upon us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you fear the police?&rdquo; she chatted away, almost as a child might.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I want to do my work alone. There will be little glory or little money in  it if they share any of my discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  It was an irrepressible exclamation, or so it seemed: but I should not have  noted it if I had not caught, or persuaded myself that I had caught, the  oblique glint from her eye which accompanied it. But it was very dark just at  this time and I could be sure of nothing but that she kept close to my side and  seemed more than once on the point of addressing me in the short distance we  traversed before reaching the bungalow. But nothing save inarticulate murmurs  left her lips and soon we were too busy, in our endeavors to unlock the door,  to think of conversation.</p>
  <p>The  key she had brought was rusty. Evidently she had not often made use of it. But  after a few futile efforts I succeeded in making it work, and we stepped into  the small building in a silence that was only less profound than the darkness  in which we instantly found ourselves enveloped. Light was under my hand,  however, and in another moment there opened before us the small square room  whose every feature had taken on a ghostly and unfamiliar air from the strange  hour and the unwonted circumstances. I saw how her impressionable nature was  affected by the scene, and made haste to assume the offhand air I thought most  likely to overcome her apprehension. But the effect of the blank walls before  her, relieved, but in no reassuring way, by the long dark folds of the rugs  hanging straight down over the mysterious partition, held its own against my well-meant  efforts, and I was not surprised to hear her voice falter as she asked what I  expected to find there.</p>
  <p>I  pointed to a chair and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will sit down, I will show you, not what I expect to find, but how a  detective goes about his work. Whatever our expectations, however small or  however great, we pay full attention to details. Now the detail which has  worried me in regard to this place is the existence of a certain space in this  building unaccounted for by these four walls; in other words, the portion which  lies behind these rugs,&rdquo;&mdash;and throwing aside the same, I let the flame from my  lantern play over the walled-up space which I had before examined with little  satisfaction. &ldquo;This partition,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;seems as firm as any of the  walls, but I want to make sure that it hides nothing. If the child should be in  some hole back of this partition, what a horror and what an outrage!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it is impossible!&rdquo; came almost in a shriek from the woman behind me. &ldquo;The  opening is completely walled up. I have never known of its being otherwise. It  looked like that when I came here three years ago. There is no possible passage  through that wall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  was it ever closed up? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly. The family are very reticent about it. Some fancy of Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s  father, I believe. He was an odd man; they tell all manner of stories about  him. If anything offended him, he rid himself of it immediately. He took a  distaste to that end of the hut, as they used to call it in the old days before  it was remodeled to suit the house, so he had it walled up. That is all we know  about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could see behind that wall,&rdquo; I muttered, dropping back the rug I had all  this time held in my hand. &ldquo;I feel some mystery here which I can not grasp.&rdquo;  Then as I flashed my lantern about in every direction with no visible result,  added with the effort which accompanies such disappointments: &ldquo;There is nothing  here, Mrs. Carew. Though it is the scene of the child&rsquo;s disappearance it gives  me nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    Temptation</b></h2>
  <p>The  sharp rustle of her dress as she suddenly rose struck upon my ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let us go,&rdquo; she cried, with just a slight quiver of eagerness in her wonderful  voice. I comprehended its culture now. &ldquo;The place is ghostly at this hour of  the night. I believe that I am really afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a muttered reassurance, I allowed the full light of the lantern to fall  directly on her face. She <i>was</i> afraid. There was no other explanation  possible for her wild staring eyes and blue quivering lips. For the instant I  hardly knew her; then her glance rose to mine and she smiled and it was with  difficulty I refrained from acknowledging in words my appreciation of her  wonderful flexibility of expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are astonished to see me so affected,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is not so strange as you  think&mdash;it is superstition&mdash;the horror of what once happened here&mdash;the reason for  that partition&mdash;I know the whole story, for all my attempts to deny it just now.  The hour, too, is unfortunate&mdash;the darkness&mdash;your shifting, mysterious light. It  was late like this&mdash;and dark&mdash;with just the moon to illumine the scene, when  she&mdash;Mr. Trevitt, do you want to know the story of this place?&mdash;the old, much  guessed-at, never-really-understood story which led first to its complete  abandonment, then to the building of that dividing wall and finally to the  restoration of this portion and of this alone? Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eagerness, in such startling contrast to the reticence she had shown on this  very subject a few minutes before, affected me peculiarly. I wanted to hear the  story&mdash;any one would who had listened to the gossip of this neighborhood for  years, but&mdash;</p>
  <p>She  evidently did not mean to give me time to understand my own hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have the whole history&mdash;the touching, hardly-to-be-believed history&mdash;up at my  house at this very moment. It was written by&mdash;no, I will let you guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  na&iuml;vet&eacute; of her smile made me forget the force of its late expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Ocumpaugh?&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  Mr. Ocumpaugh? There have been so many.&rdquo; She began slowly, naturally, to move  toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can  not guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I shall have to tell you. It was written by the one who&mdash;Come! I will tell you  outside. I haven&rsquo;t any courage here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t read the story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind; tell me who the writer was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s father; he, by whose orders this partition was put up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you have <i>his</i> story&mdash;written&mdash;and by himself! You are fortunate, Mrs.  Carew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had turned the lantern from her face, but not so far that I did not detect the  deep flush which dyed her whole countenance at these words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; she emphatically returned, meeting my eyes with a steady look I was not  sufficiently expert with women&rsquo;s ways, or at all events with this woman&rsquo;s ways,  to understand. &ldquo;Seldom has such a tale been written&mdash;seldom, let us thank God,  has there been an equal occasion for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  interest me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>And  she did. Little as this history might have to do with the finding of Gwendolen,  I felt an almost imperative necessity of satisfying my curiosity in regard to  it, though I knew she had deliberately roused this curiosity for a purpose  which, if not comprehensible to me, was of marked importance to her and not  altogether for the reason she had been pleased to give me. Possibly it was on  account of this last mentioned conviction that I allowed myself to be so  interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is late,&rdquo; she murmured with a final glance towards those dismal hangings which  in my present mood I should not have been so greatly surprised to see stir  under her look. &ldquo;However, if you will pardon the hour and accept a seat in my  small library, I will show you what only one other person has seen besides  myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a temptation; for several reasons it was a temptation; yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to see why I am frightened of this place,&rdquo; she said, flashing her eyes  upon me with an almost girlish appeal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will go,&rdquo; said I; and following her quickly out, I locked the bungalow door,  and ignoring the hand she extended toward me, dropped the key into my pocket.</p>
  <p>I  thought I heard a little gasp&mdash;the least, the smallest of sounds possible. But if  so, the feeling which prompted it was not apparent in her manner or her voice  as she led the way back to her house, and ushered me into a hall full of  packing-boxes and the general litter accompanying an approaching departure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will excuse the disorder,&rdquo; she cried as she piloted me through these various  encumbrances to a small but exquisitely furnished room still glorying in its  full complement of ornaments and pictures. &ldquo;This trouble which has come to one  I love has made it very hard for me to do anything. I feel helpless, at times,  completely helpless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dejection she expressed was but momentary, however. In another instant she was  pointing out a chair and begging me to make myself comfortable while she went  for the letter (I think she called it a letter) which I had come there to read.</p>
  <p>What  was I to think of her? What was I to think of myself? And what would the story  tell me to warrant the loss of what might have proved a most valuable hour? I  had not answered these questions when she re&euml;ntered with a bundle in her hand  of discolored&mdash;I should almost call them mouldered&mdash;sheets of much crumpled  paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These&mdash;&rdquo;  she began; then, seeing me look at them with something like suspicion, she  paused until she caught my eye, when she added gravely, &ldquo;these came to me from  Mrs. Ocumpaugh. How she got them you will have to ask her. I should say,  judging from appearances&mdash;&rdquo; Here she took a seat opposite me at a small table  near which I had been placed&mdash;&ldquo;that they must have been found in some old chest  or possibly in some hidden drawer of one of those curious antique desks of  which more than one was discovered in the garrets of the old house when it was  pulled down to give place to the new one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this letter, as you call it, so old?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is dated thirty-five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  garret must have been a damp one,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p>She  flashed me a look&mdash;I thought of it more than once afterward&mdash;and asked if she  should do the reading or I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo;  I rejoined, all afire with the prospect of listening to her remarkable voice in  what I had every reason to believe would call forth its full expression. &ldquo;Only  let me look at those sheets first, and understand as perfectly as I may, just  what it is you are going to read to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an explanation written for his heirs by Mr. Ocumpaugh. The story itself,&rdquo; she  went on, handing me over the papers she held, &ldquo;begins abruptly. From the way  the sheet is torn across at the top, I judge that the narrative itself was  preceded by some introductory words now lacking. When I have read it to you, I  will tell you what I think those introductory words were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  handed back the sheets. There seemed to be a spell in the air&mdash;possibly it arose  from her manner, which was one to rouse expectation even in one whose  imagination had not already been stirred by a visit at night and in more than  commonly bewildering company to the place whose dark and hitherto unknown  secret I was about to hear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am ready,&rdquo; I said, feeling my strange position, but not anxious to change it  just then for any other conceivable one.</p>
  <p>She  drew a deep breath; again fixed me with her strange, compelling eyes, and with  the final remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  present no longer exists, we are back in the seventies&mdash;&rdquo; began this enthralling  tale.</p>
  <p>I  did not move till the last line dropped from her lips.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    The Secret Of The Old Pavilion</b></h2>
  <p>I  was as sane that night as I had ever been in my life. I am quite sure of this,  though I had had a merry time enough earlier in the evening with my friends in  the old pavilion (that time-honored retreat of my ancestors), whose desolation  I had thought to dissipate with a little harmless revelry. Wine does not  disturb my reason&mdash;the little wine I drank under that unwholesome roof&mdash;nor am I  a man given to sudden excitements or untoward impulses.</p>
  <p>Yet  this thing happened to me.</p>
  <p>It  was after leaving the pavilion. My companions had all ridden away and I was  standing on the lawn beyond my library windows, recalling my pleasure with them  and gazing somewhat idly, I own, at that bare portion of the old wall where the  tree fell a year ago (the place where the moon strikes with such a glitter when  it rides high, as it did that night), when&mdash;believe it or not, it is all one to  me&mdash;I became conscious of a sudden mental dread, inexplicable and alarming,  which, seizing me after an hour of unmixed pleasure and gaiety, took such a  firm grip upon my imagination that I fain would have turned my back upon the  night and its influences, only my eyes would not leave that open space of wall  where I now saw pass&mdash;not the shadow, but the veritable body of a large, black,  hungry-looking dog, which, while I looked, turned into the open gateway  connecting with the pavilion and disappeared.</p>
  <p>With  it went the oppression which held me spell-bound. The ice melted from my blood;  I could move my limbs, and again control my thoughts and exercise my will.</p>
  <p>Forcing  a laugh, I whistled to that dog. The lights with which the banquet had been  illuminated were out, and every servant had left the place; but the tables had  not been entirely cleared; and I could well understand what had drawn this  strange animal thither. I whistled then, and whistled peremptorily; but no dog  answered my call. Angry, for the rules are strict at my stables in regard to  wandering brutes, I strode toward the pavilion. Entering the great gap in the  wall where a gate had once hung, I surveyed the dismal interior before me, with  feelings I could not but consider odd in a strong man like myself. Though the  wine was scarcely dry in the glass which an hour before I had raised in this  very spot amid cheers and laughter, I found it a difficult matter to re&euml;nter  there now, in the dead of night, alone and without light.</p>
  <p>For  this building, harmless as it had always seemed, had been, in a way, cursed.  For no reason that he ever gave, my father had doomed this ancient adjunct to  our home to perpetual solitude and decay. By his will he had forbidden it to be  destroyed&mdash;a wish respected by my guardians and afterward by myself&mdash;and though  there was nothing to hinder its being cared for and in a manner used, the dismal  influence which had pervaded the place ever since his death had, under the  sensations I have mentioned, deepened into horror and an unspeakable  repugnance.</p>
  <p>Yet  never having had any reason to believe myself a coward, I took boldly enough  the few steps necessary to carry me inside its dismal precincts; and meeting  with nothing but darkness and silence, began to whistle again for the dog I had  certainly seen enter here.</p>
  <p>But  no dog appeared.</p>
  <p>Hastening  out, I took my way toward the stables. As I did so I glanced back, and again,  my eyes fell on that place in the wall gleaming white in the moonlight. Again I  felt the chill, the horror! Again my eyes remained glued to this one spot; and  again I beheld the passing of that dog, running with jaws extended and, head  held low&mdash;fearsome, uncanny, supernaturally horrible; a thing to flee from, if  one could only flee instead of standing stock-still on the sward, gazing with  eyes that seemed starting from their sockets till it had plunged through that  gap in the wall and again disappeared.</p>
  <p>The  occult and the imaginary have never appealed to me, and the moment I felt  myself a man again, I hurried on to the stables to call up my man Jared.</p>
  <p>But  half-way there I paused, struck by an odd remembrance. This father of mine, Philo  Ocumpaugh, had died, or so his old servants had said, under peculiar  circumstances. I had forgotten them till now&mdash;such stories make poor headway  with me&mdash;but if I was not mistaken, the facts were these:</p>
  <p>He  had been ailing long, and his nurses had got used to the sight of his gaunt,  white figure sitting propped up, but speechless, in the great bed opposite the  stretch of blank wall in the corner bedroom, where a picture of his first wife,  the wife of his youth, had once hung, but which, for some years now, had been  removed to where there were fewer shadows and more sunlight. He had never been  a talkative man, and in all the five years of my own memory of him, I had never  heard him raise his voice except in command, or when the duties of hospitality  required it. Now, with the shadow of death upon him, he was absolutely  speechless, and his nurses were obliged to guess at his wishes by the movement  of his hands or the direction of his eyes. Yet he was not morose, and sometimes  was seen to struggle with the guards holding his tongue, as though he would  fain have loosed himself from their inexorable control. Yet he never succeeded  in doing so, and the nurses sat by and saw no difference in him, till suddenly  the candle, posed on a table near by, flickered and went out, leaving only  moonlight in the room. It was moonlight so brilliant that the place seemed  brighter than before, though the beams were all concentrated on one spot, a  blank space in the middle of the wall upon which those two dim orbs in the bed  were fixed in an expectancy none there understood, for none knew that the  summons had come, and that for him the angel of death was at that moment  standing in the room.</p>
  <p>Yet  as moonlight is not the natural light for a sick man&rsquo;s bedside, one amongst  them had risen for another candle, when something&mdash;I had never stopped to hear  them say what&mdash;made him pause and look back, when he saw distinctly outlined  upon the white wall-space I have mentioned, the figure&mdash;the unimaginable figure  of a dog, large, fierce and hungry-looking, which dashed by and&mdash;was gone.  Simultaneously a cry came from the bed, the first words for months&mdash;&ldquo;Aline!&rdquo;&mdash;the  name of his girl-wife, dead and gone for years. All sprang; some to chase the  dog, one to aid and comfort the sick man. But no dog was there, nor did he need  comfort more. He had died with that cry on his lips, and as they gazed at his  face, sunk low now in his pillow as if he had started up and fallen back, a  dead weight, they felt the terror of the moment grow upon them till they, too,  were speechless. For the aged features were drawn into lines of unspeakable  anguish and horror.</p>
  <p>But  as the night passed and morning came, all these lines smoothed out, and when  they buried him, those who had known him well talked of the beautiful serenity  which illumined the face which, since their first remembrance of him, had  carried the secret of a profound and unbroken melancholy. Of the dog, nothing  was said, even in whispers, till time had hallowed that grave, and the little  children about, grown to be men and women. Then the garrulity of age had its  way.</p>
  <p>This  story, and the images it called up, came like a shock as I halted there, and  instead of going on to the stables, I turned my steps toward the house, where I  summoned from his bed a certain old servant who had lived longer in the family  than myself.</p>
  <p>Bidding  him bring a lantern, I waited for him on the porch, and when he came, I told  him what I had seen. Instantly I knew that it was no new story to him. He  turned very pale and set down the lantern, which was shaking very visibly in  his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you look up?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;when you were in the pavilion, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  why should I? The dog was on the ground. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us go down to the pavilion,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I want to see for myself if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  what, Jared?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned his eyes on me, but did not answer. Stooping, I lifted the lantern and  put it in his hand. He was quaking like a leaf, but there was a determination  in his face far beyond the ordinary. What made him quake&mdash;he who knew of this  dog only by hearsay&mdash;and what, in spite of this fear, gave him such resolution?  I followed in his wake to see what it was.</p>
  <p>The  moon still shone clear upon the lawn, and it was with a certain renewal of my  former apprehensions that I approached the spot on the wall where I had seen  what I was satisfied not to see again. But though I glanced that way&mdash;what man  could have avoided it?&mdash;I perceived nothing but the bare paint, and we went on  and passed in without a word, Jared leading the way.</p>
  <p>But  once on the threshold of the pavilion itself, it was for him to show the  coward. Turning, he made me a gesture; one I did not understand; and seeing  that I did not understand it, he said, after a fearful look around:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not mind the dog; that was but an appearance. Lift your eyes to the  ceiling&mdash;over there&mdash;at the extreme end toward the south&mdash;do you see&mdash;<i>what</i> do you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  I replied, amazed at what struck me as utter folly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;  he repeated in a relieved voice, as he lifted up his lantern. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; came in a  sort of muttered shriek from his lips, as he pointed up, here and there, along  the farther ceiling, over which the light now played freely and fully. &ldquo;What is  that spot, and that spot, and that? They were not there to-day. I was in here  before the banquet, and <i>I</i> would have seen. What is it? Master, what is  it? They call it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well, what do they call it?&rdquo; I asked impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blood!  Do you not see that it is blood? What else is red and shiny and shows in such  great drops&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;  I vociferated, taking the lantern in my own hand. &ldquo;Blood on the ceiling of my  old pavilion? Where could it come from? There was no quarrel, no fight; only  hilarity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did the dog come from?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
  <p>I  dropped my arm, staring at him in mingled anger and a certain half-understood  sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think these stains&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  as unreal as the dog? Yes, master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Feeling  as if I were in a dream, I tossed up the lantern again. The drops were still  there, but no longer single or scattered. From side to side, the ceiling at  this one end of the building oozed with the thick red moisture to which he had  given so dreadful a name.</p>
  <p>Stepping  back for fear the stains would resolve themselves into rain and drop upon my  forehead, I stared at Jared, who had now retreated toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think it blood?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  some have smelt and tasted it. We have never talked about it, but this is not  an uncommon occurrence. To-morrow all these stains will be gone. They come when  the dog circles the wall. Whence, no one knows. It is our mystery. All the old  servants have heard of it more than once. The new ones have never been told.  Nor would I have told you if you had not seen the dog. It was a matter of honor  with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at him, saw that he believed every word he said, threw another glance at  the ceiling, and led the way out. When we had reached the house again, I said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are acquainted with the tradition underlying these appearances, as you call  them. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  could not tell me. He knew no more than he had already stated&mdash;gossip and old  wives&rsquo; tales. But later, a certain manuscript came into my possession through  my lawyer, which I will append to this.</p>
  <p>It  was written by my unhappy father, some little time before his last illness, and  given into the charge of the legal representative of our family, with the  express injunction that its seal was to remain intact if for twenty years the  apparition which had haunted him did not present itself to the eyes of any of  his children. But if within that time his experience should repeat itself in  theirs, this document was to be handed over to the occupant of Homewood.  Nineteen out of the twenty years had elapsed, without the dog being seen or the  ceiling of the pavilion dropping blood. But not the twentieth; hence, the document  was mine.</p>
  <p>You  can easily conceive with what feelings I opened it. It was headed with this  simple line:</p>
  <p>MY  STORY WHICH I CAN WRITE BUT COULD NEVER TELL.</p>
  <p>I  am cursed with an inability to speak when I am most deeply moved, either by  anger or tenderness. This misfortune has wrecked my life. On the verge of old  age, the sorrows and the mistakes of my early life fill my thoughts so  completely that I see but one face, hear but one voice; yet when she was  living&mdash;when <i>she</i> could see and hear, my tongue was silent and she never  knew. Aline! my Aline!</p>
  <p>I  married her when I was thirty-five and she eighteen. All the world knows this;  but what it does not know is that I loved her&mdash;toy, plaything that she was&mdash;a  body without a mind&mdash;(or, so I considered her)&mdash;while she had but followed the  wishes of her relatives in giving her sweet youth to a cold and reticent man  who might love, indeed, but who had no power to tell that love, or even to show  it in the ways which women like, and which she liked, as I found out when it  was too late.</p>
  <p>I  could not help but love her. It was ingrained within me; a part of the curse of  my life to love this gentle, thoughtless, alluring thing to which I had given  my name. She had a smile&mdash;it did not come often&mdash;which tore at my heart-strings  as it welled up, just stirring the dimples in her cheeks, and died away again  in a strange and moving sweetness. Though I reckoned her at her worth; knew  that her charm was all physical; that she neither did nor could understand a  passion like mine, much less return it, it was none the less irresistible, and  I have known myself to stand before a certain book-shelf in the turn of the  stairway for many minutes together, because I knew that she would soon be  coming down, and that, when she did, some ribbon from her gown would flutter by  me, and I should feel the soft contact and go away happy to my books. Yet, if  she stopped to look back at me, I could only return her look with one she  doubtless called harsh, for she had not eyes to see below the surface.</p>
  <p>I  tell you all this, lest you may not understand. She was not your mother and you  may begrudge me the affection I felt for her; if so, thrust these leaves into  the fire and seek not the explanation of what has surprised you; for there is  no word written here which does not find its meaning in the intense love I bore  for her, my young girl-wife, and the tragedy which this love has brought into  my life. She was slight in body, slight in mind and of slight feeling. I first  discovered this last on the day I put my mother&rsquo;s ring on her finger. She  laughed as I fitted it close and kissed the little hand. Not from embarrassment  or childish impulse; I could have understood that; but indifferently, like one  who did not know and never could. Yet I married her, and for six months lived  in a fool&rsquo;s paradise. Then came that ball. It was held near here, very near; at  one of our neighbor&rsquo;s, in fact. I remember that we walked, and that, coming to  the driveway, I lifted her and carried her across. Not with a smile&mdash;do not  think it. More likely with a frown, though my heart was warm and happy; for  when I set her down, she shook herself, and I thought she did it to hide a  shudder, and then I could not have spoken a word had my life depended on it.</p>
  <p>I  little knew what lay back of that shudder. Even after I had seen her dance with  him, not only once, but twice, I never dreamed that her thoughts, light though  they were, were not all with me. It took that morsel of paper and the plain  words it contained to satisfy me of this, and then&mdash;But passion is making me  incoherent. What do you know of that scrap of paper, hidden from the whole  world from the moment I first read it till this hour of full confession? It  fluttered from some one&rsquo;s hand during the dance. I did not see whose. I only  saw it after it had fallen at my feet, and as it lay there open I naturally  read the words. They were written by a man to a woman, urging flight and  setting the hour and place for meeting. I was conscious of shame in reading it,  and let these last details escape me. As I put it in my pocket I remember  thinking, &ldquo;Some poor devil made miserable!&rdquo; for there had been hint in it of  the husband. But I had no thought&mdash;I swear it before God&mdash;of who that husband was  till I beheld her flit back through the open doorway, with terror in her mien  and searching eyes fixed on the floor. Then hell opened before me, and I saw my  happiness go down into gulfs I had never before sounded, even in imagination.</p>
  <p>But  even at that evil hour my countenance scarcely changed&mdash;I was opposite a mirror,  and I caught a glimpse of myself as I moved. But there must have been some  change in my voice&mdash;for when I addressed her, she started and turned her face  upon me with a wild and pathetic look which knocked so at my heart that I  wished I had never read those words, and so could return her the paper with no  misgiving as to its contents. But having read it, I could not do this; so,  beyond a petty greeting, I said nothing and let the moment pass, and she with  it; for couples were dancing and she was soon again in the whirl. I am not a  dancing man myself, and I had leisure to think and madden myself with  contemplation of my wrecked life and questions as to what I should do to her  and to him, and to the world where such things could happen. I had forgotten  the details of time and place, or rather had put them out of my mind, and I  would not look at the words again&mdash;could not. But as the minutes went by, the  remembrance returned, startling and convincing, that the hour was two and the  place&mdash;our old pavilion.</p>
  <p>I  walked about after that like a man in whose breast the sources of life are  frozen. I chatted&mdash;I who never chatted&mdash;with women, and with men. I even  smiled&mdash;once. That was when my little white-faced wife asked me if it were not  time to go home. Even a man under torture might find strength to smile if the  inquisitor should ask if he were not ready to be released.</p>
  <p>And  we went home.</p>
  <p>I  did not carry her this time across the driveway; but when we parted in the  library, where I always spent an hour before retiring, I picked out a lily from  a vase of flowers standing on my desk and held it out to her. She stared at it  for a moment, quite as white as the lily, then she slowly put out her hand and  took it. I felt no mercy after that, and bade her good-night with the remark  that I should have to write far into the morning, and that she need not worry  over my light, which I should not probably put out till she was half through  with her night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
  <p>For  answer, she dropped the lily. I found it next morning lying withered and brown  in the hall-way.</p>
  <p>That  light did burn far into the morning; but I was not there to trim it. Before the  fatal hour had struck, I had left the house and made my way to the pavilion. As  I crossed the sward I saw the gleam of a lantern at the masthead of a small boat  riding near our own landing-place, and I understood where he was at this hour,  and by what route he hoped to take my darling. &ldquo;A route she will never travel,&rdquo;  thought I, striving to keep out of my mind and conscience the vision of another  route, another travel, which that sweet young body might take if my mood held  and my purpose strengthened.</p>
  <p>There  was no moon that night, and the copse in which our pavilion stands was like a  blot against the starless heavens. As I drew near it, my dog, the invariable  companion of my walks, lifted a short, sharp bark from the stables. But I knew  whose hand had fastened him, and I went on without giving him a thought. At the  door of the pavilion I stopped. All was dark within as without, and the silence  was something to overwhelm the heart. She was not there then, nor was he. But  he would be coming soon, and up or down between the double hedge-rows.</p>
  <p>I  went to meet him. It was a small detail, but possibly a necessary one. In her  eyes he was probably handsome and gifted with all that I openly lacked. But he  was shallow and small for a man like me to be concerned about. I laughed  inwardly and with very conceivable scorn as I heard the faint fall of his  footsteps in the darkness. It was nearly two and he meant to be prompt.</p>
  <p>Our  coming together in that narrow path was very much what I expected it to be. I  had put out my arms and touched the hedge on either side, so that he could not  escape me. When I heard him drawing close, I found the voice I had not had for  her, and observed very quietly and with the cold politeness of a messenger:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  wife finds herself indisposed since the ball, and begs to be excused from  joining you in the pleasant sail you proposed to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That,  and no more; except that when he started and almost fell into my arms, I found  strength to add:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wind blows fresh to-night; you will have no difficulty in leaving this shore.  The difficulty will be to return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had no heart to kill him; he was young and he was frightened. I heard the sob  in his throat as I dropped my arm and he went flying down to the river.</p>
  <p>This  was child&rsquo;s play; the rest&mdash;</p>
  <p>My  portion is to tell it; forty years ago it all befell, and till now no word of  it has ever left my lips.</p>
  <p>There  was no sound of her advancing tread across the lawn as I stepped back into my  own grounds to enter the pavilion. But as I left the path and put foot inside  the wall, I heard a far, faint sound like the harsh closing of a door in timid  hands, followed by another bark from the dog, louder and sharper than the  first&mdash;for he did not recognize my Aline as mistress, though I had striven for  six months to teach him the place she held in my heart.</p>
  <p>By  this I knew she was coming, and that what preparations I had to make must be  made soon. They were not many. Entering the well-known place, I lit the lantern  I had brought with me and set it down near the door. It cast a feeble light  about the entrance, but left great shadows in the rear. This I had calculated  on, and into these shadows I now stepped.</p>
  <p>The  pavilion, as you remember it, is not what it was then. I had used it little,  fancying more my own library up at the house, but it was not utterly without  furnishings, and to young eyes might even look attractive, with love, or  fancied love, to mellow its harsh lines and lend romance to its solitude. At  this hour and under these circumstances it was a dismal hole to me; and as I  stood there waiting, I thought how the place fitted the deed&mdash;if deed it was to  be.</p>
  <p>I  had always thought her timid, afraid of the night and all threatening things.  But as I listened to the sound of her soft footfall at the door, I realized  that even her breast could grow strong under the influence of a real or fancied  passion. It was a shock&mdash;but I did not cry out&mdash;only set my teeth together and  turned a little so that what light there was would fall on my form rather than  on my face.</p>
  <p>She  entered; I felt rather than heard the tremulous push she gave to the door, and  the quick drawing in of her breath as she put her foot across the threshold.  These sapped my courage. This fear, this almost hesitation, drew me from  thoughts of myself to thoughts of her, and it was in a daze of mingled purposes  and regrets that I felt her at last at my side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walter!&rdquo;  fell softly, doubtfully from her lips.</p>
  <p>It  was the name of him the dip of whose oars as he made for his boat I could now  faintly hear in the river below us.</p>
  <p>Turning,  I looked her in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are late,&rdquo; said I. God gave me words in my extremity. &ldquo;Walter has gone.&rdquo; Then,  as the madness of terror replaced love in her eyes, I lifted her forcibly and  carried her to the window, where I drew aside the vines. &ldquo;That is his boat&rsquo;s  lantern you see drawing away from the dock. I bade him God-speed. He will not  come again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  a word she looked, then fell back on my arm. It was not life which forsook her  face, and left her whole sweet body inert&mdash;that I could have borne, for did she  not merit death who had killed my love, killed me?&mdash;but happiness, the glow of  youthful blood, the dreams of a youthful brain. And seeing this, seeing that  the heart I thought a child&rsquo;s heart had gone down in this shipwreck, I felt my  anger swell and master me body and soul, and before I knew it, I was towering  over her and she was cowering at my feet, crushed and with hands held up in  defense, hands that had been like rose-leaves in my grasp, futile hands, but  raised now in entreaty for her life to me, to me who had loved her.</p>
  <p>Why  did they not move me? Why did my muscles tighten instead of relax? I do not  know; I had never thought myself a cruel man, but at that instant I felt that  this toy of my strong manhood had done harm far beyond its value, and that it  would comfort me to break it and toss it far aside; only I could not bear the  cry which now left her lips:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so young! not yet, not yet, Philo! I am so young! Let me live a little  while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  it a woman&rsquo;s plea, conscious of the tenderness she appealed to, or only a child&rsquo;s  instinctive grasping after life, just life? If it were the first, it would be  easy to finish; but a child&rsquo;s terror, a child&rsquo;s longing&mdash;that pulled hard at my  manhood, and under the possibility, my own arm fell.</p>
  <p>Instantly  her head drooped. No defense did she utter; no further plea did she make; she  simply waited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have deserved death.&rdquo; This I managed to utter. &ldquo;But if you will swear to obey  me, you shall not pay your forfeit till you have had a further taste of life.  Not in my house; there is not sufficient freedom within its walls for you; but  in the broad world, where people dance and sing and grow old at their leisure,  without duty and without care. For three months you shall have this, and have  it to your heart&rsquo;s content. Then you shall come back to me my true wife, if  your heart so prompts; if not, to tell me of your failure and quit me for ever.  But&mdash;&rdquo; Here I fear my voice grew terrible, for her hands instinctively rose  again. &ldquo;Those three months must be lived unstained. As you are in God&rsquo;s sight  this hour, I demand of you to swear that, if you forget this or disregard it,  or for any cause subject my name to dishonor, that you will return unbidden at  the first moment your reason returns to you, to take what punishment I will. On  this condition I send you away to-night. Aline, will you promise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not answer; but her face rose. I did not understand its look. There was pathos  in it, and something else. That something else troubled me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you dissatisfied?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Is the time too short? Do you want more months for  dancing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head and the little hands rose again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not send me away,&rdquo; she faintly entreated; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why&mdash;but I&mdash;had rather  stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  me? Impossible. Are you ready to promise, Aline?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  she rose and looked me in the eye with courage, almost with resolution.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I live!&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>And  I knew she would keep her word.</p>
  <p>The  next thing I remember of that night was the sight of her little white,  shivering figure looking out at me from the carriage that was to carry her  away. The night was cold, and I had tucked her in with as much care as I might  have done the evening before, when I still worshiped her, still thought her  mine, or at least as much mine as she was any one&rsquo;s. When I had done this and  pressed a generous gift into her hand, I stood a minute at the carriage door,  in pity of her aspect. She looked so pinched and pale, so dazed and hopeless.  Had she been alone&mdash;but the companion with whom I had provided her was at her  side and my tongue was tied. I turned, and the driver started up the horses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philo!&rdquo;  I heard blown by me on the wind.</p>
  <p>Was  it she who called? No, for there was anguish in the cry, the anguish of a  woman, and she was only a frightened, disheartened child whom I had sent away  to&mdash;dance.</p>
  <p>One  month, two months went by, and I began to take up my life. Another, and she  would be home for good or ill. I thought that I could live through that other.  I had heard of her; not from her&mdash;that I did not require; and the stories were  all of the same character. She was enjoying life in the great city to which I  had sent her; radiant at night, if a little spiritless by day. She was at  balls, at concerts and at theaters. She wore jewels and shone with the best; I  might be proud of her conquests and the sweetness and dignity with which she  bore herself. Thus her friends wrote.</p>
  <p>But  she wrote nothing; I had not required it. Once, some one&mdash;a visitor at the  house&mdash;spoke of having seen her. &ldquo;She was surrounded with admirers,&rdquo; he had  said. &ldquo;How early our American women ripen!&rdquo; was his comment. &ldquo;She held her head  like one who has held sway for years; but I thought her a trifle worn; as if  pleasure absorbed too much of her sleep. You must look out for her, Judge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  I smiled grimly enough, I own, to think just how I was looking out for her.</p>
  <p>Then  came the thunderbolt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am told that no one ever sees her in the day-time; that she is always busy,  days. But she does not look as if she took that time for rest. What can your  little wife be doing? You ought to hurry up that important opinion of yours and  go see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was right; what was she doing? And why shouldn&rsquo;t I go see? There was no  obstacle but my own will, but that is the greatest obstacle a man can have. I  remained at Homewood, but the four weeks of our further probation looked like a  year.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  I had my way with the pavilion. I have shown you my heart, sometimes at its  best, oftenest at its worst. I will show it to you again in this. I had a wall  built round it, close against the thicket in which it lay embedded. This wall  was painted white, and near it I had lamps placed which were lit at nightfall.  Should a figure pass that wall I could see it from my window. No one could  enter that doorway now, without running the risk of my seeing him from where I  sat at my desk.</p>
  <p>Did  I feel easier? I do not know that I did. I merely followed an impulse I dared  not name to myself.</p>
  <p>Two  weeks of this final month went by. Then (it was in the evening) some one came  running up from the grounds, with the message that Mrs. Ocumpaugh had ridden  into the gate, but that she was not ready to enter the house. Would I meet her  at the pavilion?</p>
  <p>I  was in the library, at my desk, with my eyes on the wall, when this was told  me. I had just seen the fierce figure of that unmanageable dog of mine run by  that white surface, and my lips were open to order him tied up, when he, and  everything else in this whole world, was forgotten in this crushing news of her  return. For the three months were not up and her presence here could mean but  one thing&mdash;she had found temptation too much for her, and she had come back to  tell me so in obedience to her promise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will go meet Mrs. Ocumpaugh,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>The  man stared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will go meet Mrs. Ocumpaugh now,&rdquo; I repeated, and tried to rise.</p>
  <p>But  my limbs refused; death had entered my heart, and it was some few minutes  before I found myself upon the lawn outside.</p>
  <p>When  I got there I was trembling and so uncertain of movement that I tottered at the  gate. But seeing signs of her presence within, I straightened myself and went  in.</p>
  <p>She  was standing at the extreme end of the room when I entered, in the full light  of the solitary moonbeam which shot in at the western casement. She had thrown  aside her hat and coat, and never in all my life had I seen anything so  ethereal as the worn face and wasted form she thus disclosed. Had it not been  for the haunting and pathetic smile which by some freak of fate gave poignancy  to her otherwise infantile beauty, I should not have known the woman who stood  there with my name formed on her lips.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="c00050-images/page168.jpg" width="800" height="658"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Destroyed!&rdquo;  was my thought; and the rage which I felt that moment against fate flushed my  whole being, and my arms went up, not in threat against her, but to an avenging  Heaven, when I heard an impetuous rush, an angry growl, and the delicate,  trembling figure went down under the leap of the monstrous animal which I had  taught to love me, but could never teach to love her.</p>
  <p>In  horror and unspeakable anguish of soul I called off the dog; and, stooping with  bitter cries, I took her in my arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo;  I gasped. &ldquo;Hurt, Aline?&rdquo; I looked at her anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she whispered, &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; And before I realized my own feelings or the passion  with which I drew her to my breast, she had nestled her head against my heart,  smiled and died.</p>
  <p>The  shock of the dog&rsquo;s onslaught had killed her.</p>
  <p>I  would not believe it at first, but when I was quite sure, I took out the pistol  I carried in my breast and shot the cowering brute midway between the eyes.</p>
  <p>When  this was done, I turned back to her. There was no light but the moon, and I  needed no other. The clear beams falling on her face made her look pure and  stainless and sweet. I could almost have loved her again as I marked the tender  smile which lingered from that passing moment on her lips. &ldquo;Happy,&rdquo; she had  said. What did she mean by that &ldquo;Happy&rdquo;? As I asked myself I heard a cry. The  companion who had been with her had rushed in at the doorway, and was gazing in  sorrow and amazement at the white form lying outstretched and senseless against  that farther wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  she cried, in a tone that assured me she had not seen the dog lying in his  blood at my back; &ldquo;dead already? dead at the first glance? at the first word?  Ah, she knew better than I, poor lamb. I thought she would get well if she once  got home. She wearied so for you, sir, and for Homewood!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought myself quite mad; past understanding aright the words addressed to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  wearied&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  all her soul for you and Homewood,&rdquo; the young woman repeated. &ldquo;That is, since  her illness developed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  illness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she has been ill ever since she went away. The cold of that first journey was  too much for her. But she kept up for several weeks&mdash;doing what no other woman  ever did before with so little strength and so little hope. Danced at night  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;what  by day, what?&rdquo; I could hardly get the words out of my mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Studied.  Learned what she thought you would like&mdash;French&mdash;music&mdash;politics. It was to have been  a surprise. Poor soul! it took her very life. She did not sleep&mdash;Oh, sir, what  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was standing over her, probably a terrifying figure. Lights were playing before  my eyes, strange sounds were in my ears, everything about me seemed resolving  itself into chaos.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; I finally gasped. &ldquo;She studied&mdash;to please <i>me</i>? Why did she  come back, then, so soon&mdash;&rdquo; I paused, choked. I had been about to give away my  secret. &ldquo;I mean, why did she come thus suddenly, without warning me of what I  might expect? I would have gone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told her so; but she was very determined to come to you herself&mdash;to this very  pavilion. She had set the time later, but this morning the doctor told her that  her symptoms were alarming, and without consulting him or heeding the advice of  any of us, she started for home. She was buoyant on the way, and more than once  I heard her softly repeating your name. Her heart was very loving&mdash;Oh, sir, you  are ill!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; I cried, crushing my hand against my mouth to keep down the cry of anguish  and despair which tore its way up from my heart. &ldquo;Before other hands touch her,  other eyes see her, tell me when she began&mdash;I will not say to love me, but to  weary for me and&mdash;Homewood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  she has told you herself. Here is the letter, sir, she bade me give you if she  did not reach here alive. She wrote it this morning, after the doctor told her  what I have said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give&mdash;give&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  put it in my hand. I glanced at it in the moonlight, read the first few words,  and felt the world reel round me. Thrusting the letter in my breast, I bade the  woman, who watched me with fascinated eyes, to go now and rouse the house. When  she was gone I stepped back into the shadows, and catching hold of the  murderous beast, I dragged him out and about the wall to a thick clump of  bushes. Here I left him and went back to my darling. When they came in, they  found her in my arms. Her head had fallen back and I was staring, staring, at  her white throat.</p>
  <p>That  night, when all was done for her which could be done, I shut myself into my  library and again opened that precious letter. I give it, to show how men may  be mistaken when they seek to weigh women&rsquo;s souls:</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p class="note"><i>My  Husband</i>:</p>
  <p class="note">I  love you. As I shall be dead when you read this, I may say so without fear of  rebuff. I did not love you then; I did not love anybody; I was thoughtless and  fond of pleasure, and craved affectionate words. He saw this and worked on my  folly; but when his project failed and I saw his boat creep away, I found that  what feeling I had was for the man who had thwarted him, and I felt myself  saved.</p>
  <p class="note">If  I had not taken cold that night I might have lived to prove this. I know that  you do not love me very much, but perhaps you would have done so had you seen  me grow a little wiser and more like what your wife should be. I was trying  when&mdash;O Philo, I can not write&mdash;I can not think. I am coming to you&mdash;I  love&mdash;forgive&mdash;and take me back again, alive or dead. I love you&mdash;I love&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>As  I finished, the light, which had been burning low, suddenly went out. The  window which opened before me was still unshuttered. Before me, across the wide  spaces of the lawn, shone the pavilion wall, white in the moonlight As I stared  in horror at it, a trembling seized my whole body, and the hair on my head  rose. The dark figure of a running dog had passed across it&mdash;<i>the dog which  lay dead under the bushes</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s  punishment,&rdquo; I murmured, and laid my head down on that pathetic letter and  sobbed.</p>
  <p>The  morning found me there. It was not till later that the man sent to bury the dog  came to me with the cry, &ldquo;Something is wrong with the pavilion! When I went in  to close the window I found the ceiling at that end of the room strangely  dabbled. It looks like blood. And the spots grew as I looked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aghast,  bruised in spirit and broken of heart, I went down, after that sweet body was  laid in its grave, to look. The stains he had spoken of were gone. But I lived  to see them reappear,&mdash;as you have.</p>
  <p>God  have mercy on our souls!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Behind The Wall</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;A  most pathetic and awesome history!&rdquo; I exclaimed, after the pause which  instinctively followed the completion of this tale, read as few of its kind  have ever been read, by this woman of infinite resources in feeling and  expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it not? Do you wonder that a visit in the dead of night to a spot associated  with such superstitious horrors should frighten me?&rdquo; she added as she bundled  up the scattered sheets with a reckless hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not. I am not sure but that I am a little bit frightened myself,&rdquo; I smiled,  following with my eye a single sheet which had escaped to the floor. &ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo;  I cried, stooping to lift it. As I did so I observed that it was the first  sheet, the torn one&mdash;and that a line or so of writing was visible at the top  which I was sure had not been amongst those she had read.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  words are those?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, they are half gone as you can see. They have nothing to do with the  story. I read you the whole of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mistress  as she was of her moods and expression I detected traces of some slight  confusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  putting up of the partition is not explained,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that was put up in horror of the stains which from time to time broke out on  the ceiling at that end of the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  wished to ask her if this was her conclusion or if that line or two I have  mentioned was more intelligible than she had acknowledged it to be. But I  refrained from a sense of propriety.</p>
  <p>If  she appreciated my forbearance she did not show it. Rising, she thrust the  papers into a cupboard, casting a scarcely perceptible glance at the clock as  she did so.</p>
  <p>I took  the hint and rose. Instantly she was all smiles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have forgotten something, Mr. Trevitt. Surely you do not intend to carry away  with you my key to the bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was thinking of it,&rdquo; I returned lightly. &ldquo;I am not quite through with that key.&rdquo;  Then before she could recover from her surprise, I added with such suavity as I  had been able to acquire in my intercourse with my more cultivated clients:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have to thank you, Mrs. Carew, for an hour of thrilling interest. Absorbed  though I am in the present mystery, my mind has room for the old one. Possibly  because there is sometimes a marked connection between old family events and  new. There may be some such connection in this case. I should like the  opportunity of assuring myself there is not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  said nothing; I thought I understood why. More suavely yet, I continued, with a  slight, a very slight movement toward the door: &ldquo;Rarely have I had the pleasure  of listening to such a tale read by such an interpreter. It will always remain  in my memory, Mrs. Carew. But the episode is over and I return to my present  duty and the bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bungalow! You are going back to the bungalow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Immediately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for? Didn&rsquo;t you see all there was to see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what there can be left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of consequence, most likely, but you can not wish me to have any doubts on the  subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  carelessness of her tone did not communicate itself to her manner. Seeing that  my unexpected proposition had roused her alarm, I grew wary and remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was always overscrupulous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a lift of her shoulders&mdash;a dainty gesture which I congratulated myself I could  see unmoved&mdash;she held out her hand in a mute appeal for the key, but seeing that  I was not to be shaken in my purpose, reached for the wrap she had tossed on a  chair and tied it again over her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Accompany  you,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again?  I thought the place frightened you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I had rather visit any other spot in the whole world; but  if it is your intention to go back there, it is mine to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very good,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
  <p>But  I was seriously disconcerted notwithstanding. I had reckoned, upon a quiet hour  in the bungalow by myself; moreover, I did not understand her motive for never  trusting me there alone. Yet as this very distrust was suggestive, I put a good  face on the matter and welcomed her company with becoming alacrity. After all,  I might gain more than I could possibly lose by having her under my eye for a  little longer. Strong as was her self-control there were moments when the real  woman showed herself, and these moments were productive.</p>
  <p>As  we were passing out she paused to extinguish a lamp which was slightly  smoking,&mdash;I also thought she paused an instant to listen. At all events her ears  were turned toward the stairs down which there came the murmur of two voices,  one of them the little boy&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is time Harry was asleep,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I promised to sing to him. You won&rsquo;t be  long, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  need not be very long,&rdquo; was my significant retort. &ldquo;I can not speak for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  I playing with her curiosity or anxieties or whatever it was that affected her?  I hardly knew; I spoke as impulse directed and waited in cold blood&mdash;or was it  hot blood?&mdash;to see how she took it.</p>
  <p>Carelessly  enough, for she was a famous actress except when taken by surprise. Checking an  evident desire of calling out some direction up stairs, she followed me to the  door, remarking cheerfully, &ldquo;You can not be very long either; the place is not  large enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  excuse&mdash;or rather the one I made to myself for thus returning to a place I had  seemingly exhausted, was this. In the quick turn I had made in leaving on the  former occasion, my foot had struck the edge of the large rug nailed over the  center of the floor, and unaccountably loosened it. To rectify this mishap, and  also to see how so slight a shock could have lifted the large brass nails by  which it had been held down to the floor, seemed reason enough for my action.  But how to draw her attention to so insignificant a fact without incurring her  ridicule I could not decide in our brief passage back to the bungalow, and  consequently was greatly relieved when, upon opening the door and turning my  lantern on the scene, I discovered that in our absence the rug had torn itself  still farther free from the floor and now lay with one of its corners well  curled over&mdash;the corner farthest from the door and nearest the divan where  little Gwendolen had been lying when she was lifted and carried away&mdash;where?</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew saw it too and cast me a startled look which I met with a smile possibly  as ambiguous as the feeling which prompted it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  has been here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  we do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did; or rather my foot struck the edge of the rug as I turned to go out with  you. Shall I replace it and press back the nails?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will be so good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Do  what she would there was eagerness in her tone. Remarking this, I decided to  give another and closer look at the floor and the nails. I found the latter had  not been properly inserted; or rather that there were two indentations for  every nail, a deep one and one quite shallow. This caused me to make some  examination of the others, those which had not been drawn from the floor, and I  found that one or two of them were equally insecure, but not all; only those  about this one corner.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew, who had paused, confused and faltering in the doorway, in her dismay at  seeing me engaged in this inspection instead of in replacing the rug as I had  proposed, now advanced a step, so that our glances met as I looked up with the  remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  rug seems to have been lately raised at this corner. Do you know if the police  had it up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t. I believe so&mdash;oh, Mr. Trevitt,&rdquo; she cried, as I rose to my feet with the  corner of the rug in my hand, &ldquo;what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had run forward impetuously and was now standing close beside me&mdash;inconveniently  close.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to raise this rug,&rdquo; I informed her. &ldquo;That is, just at this corner.  Pardon me, I shall have to ask you to move.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  of course,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Oh, what is going to happen now?&rdquo; Then as she  watched me: &ldquo;There is&mdash;there <i>is</i> something under it. A door in the  floor&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;Mrs. Ocumpaugh never told me of this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you suppose she knew it?&rdquo; I inquired, looking up into her face, which was very  near but not near enough to be in the full light of the lantern, which was  pointed another way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  rug appears to have been almost soldered to the floor, everywhere but here.  There! it is thrown back. Now, if you will be so very good as to hold the  lantern, I will try and lift up the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not. See, how my hands shake! What are we about to discover? Nothing, I  pray, nothing. Suspense would be better than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you will be able to hold it,&rdquo; I urged, pressing the lantern upon her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I have never been devoid of courage. But&mdash;but&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me to descend with you,&rdquo;  she prayed, as she lifted the lantern and turned it dexterously enough on that  portion of the door where a ring lay outlined in the depths of its outermost  plank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not; but you will come just the same; you can not help it,&rdquo; I hazarded, as  with the point of my knife-blade I lifted the small round of wood which filled  into the ring and thus made the floor level.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  if this door is not locked, we will have it up,&rdquo; I cried, pulling at the ring  with a will. The door was not locked and it came up readily enough, discovering  some half-dozen steps, down which I immediately proceeded to climb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can not stay here alone,&rdquo; she protested, and prepared to follow me in haste  just as I expected her to do the moment she saw the light withdrawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Step  carefully,&rdquo; I enjoined. &ldquo;If you will honor me with your hand&mdash;&rdquo; But she was at  my side before the words were well out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it? What kind of place do you make it out to be; and is there anything here  you&mdash;do&mdash;not&mdash;want&mdash;to see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  flashed the light around and incidentally on her. She was not trembling now.  Her cheeks were red, her eyes blazing. She was looking at me, and not at the  darksome place about her. But as this was natural, it being a woman&rsquo;s way to  look for what she desires to learn in the face of the man who for the moment is  her protector, I shifted the light into the nooks and corners of the low, damp  cellar in which we now found ourselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bins  for wine and beer,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;but nothing in them.&rdquo; Then as I measured the  space before me with my eye, &ldquo;It runs under the whole house. See, it is much  larger than the room above.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she mechanically repeated.</p>
  <p>I  lowered the lantern to the floor but quickly raised it again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that on the other side?&rdquo; I queried. &ldquo;I am sure there is a break in the wall  over in that corner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not see,&rdquo; she gasped; certainly she was very much frightened. &ldquo;Are you  going to cross the floor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and if you do not wish to follow me, sit down on these steps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I will go where you go; but this is very fearful. Why, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had stepped aside in order to avoid a trail of footprints I saw extending  across the cellar floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  around this way,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;If you will follow me I will keep you from being  too much frightened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did as I told her. Softly her steps fell in behind mine; and thus with wary  tread and peering eyes we made our way to the remote end, where we found&mdash;or  rather where I found&mdash;that the break which I had noticed in the uniformity of  the wall was occasioned by a pile of old boxes, arranged so as to make steps up  to a hole cut through the floor above.</p>
  <p>With  a sharp movement I wheeled upon her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you see that?&rdquo; I asked, pointing back over my shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steps,&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;going up into that part of the building where&mdash;where&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you attempt them with me? Or will you stay here, in the darkness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;will&mdash;stay&mdash;here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was said with shortened breath; but she seemed less frightened than when we  started to cross the cellar. At all events a fine look of daring had displaced  the tremulous aspect which had so changed the character of her countenance a  few minutes before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will make short work of it,&rdquo; I assured her as I hastily ran up the steps. &ldquo;Drop  your face into your hands and you will not be conscious of the darkness.  Besides, I will talk to you all the time. There! I have worked my way up  through the hole. I have placed my lantern on the floor above and I see&mdash;What!  are you coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Indeed,  she was close beside me, maintaining her footing on the toppling boxes by a  grip on my disengaged arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you see?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Wait! let me pull you up; we might as well stand on the  floor as on these boxes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Climbing  into the room above, I offered her my hand, and in another moment we stood  together in the noisome precincts of that abominable spot, with whose doleful  story she had just made me acquainted.</p>
  <p>A  square of impenetrable gloom confronted me at the first glance&mdash;what might not  be the result of a second?</p>
  <p>I  turned to consult the appearance of the lady beside me before I took this  second look. Had she the strength to stand the ordeal? Was she as much moved&mdash;or  possibly more moved than myself? As a woman, and the intimate friend of the  Ocumpaughs, she should be. But I could not perceive that she was. For some  reason, once in view of this mysterious place, she was strangely, inexplicably,  impassibly calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can bear it?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must&mdash;only end it quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; I replied, and I held out my lantern.</p>
  <p>I  am not a superstitious man, but instinctively I looked up before I looked about  me. I have no doubt that Mrs. Carew did the same. But no stains were to be seen  on those blackened boards now; or rather, they were dark with one continuous  stain; and next moment I was examining with eager scrutiny the place itself.</p>
  <p>Accustomed  to the appearance of the cheerful and well-furnished room on the other side of  the partition, it was a shock to me (I will not say what it was to her) to meet  the bare decaying walls and mouldering appurtenances of this dismal hole. True,  we had just come from a description of the place in all the neglect of its many  years of desolation, yet the smart finish of the open portion we had just left  poorly prepared us for what we here encountered.</p>
  <p>But  the first impression over&mdash;an impression which was to recur to me many a night  afterward in dreams&mdash;I remembered the nearer and more imperative cause which had  drawn us thither, and turning the light into each and every corner, looked  eagerly for what I so much dreaded to find.</p>
  <p>A  couch to which some old cushions still clung stood against the farther wall.  Thank God! it was empty; so were all the corners of the room. Nothing living  and&mdash;nothing dead!</p>
  <p>Turning  quickly upon Mrs. Carew, I made haste to assure her that our fears were quite  unfounded.</p>
  <p>But  she was not even looking my way. Her eyes were on the ground, and she seemed  merely waiting&mdash;in some impatience, evidently, but yet merely waiting&mdash;for me to  finish and be gone.</p>
  <p>This  was certainly odd, for the place was calculated in itself to rouse curiosity,  especially in one who knew its story. A table, thick with dust and blurred with  dampness, still gave tokens of a bygone festivity&mdash;among which a bottle and some  glasses stood conspicuous. Cards were there too, dingy and green with  mould&mdash;some on the tables&mdash;some on the floor; while the open lid of a small desk  pushed up close to a book-case full of books, still held a rusty pen and the  remnants of what looked like the mouldering sheets of unused paper. As for the  rest&mdash;desolation, neglect, horror&mdash;but no <i>child</i>.</p>
  <p>The  relief was enormous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a dreadful place,&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;but it might have been worse. Do you want  to see things nearer? Shall we cross the floor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no. We have not found Gwendolen; let us go. Oh, let us go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  thrill of feeling had crept into her voice. Who could wonder? Yet I was not  ready to humor her very natural sensibilities by leaving quite so abruptly. The  floor interested me; the cushions of that old couch interested me; the sawn  boards surrounding the hole&mdash;indeed, many things.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will go in a moment,&rdquo; I assured her; &ldquo;but, first, cast your eyes along the  floor. Don&rsquo;t you see that some one has preceded us here; and that not so very  long ago? Some one with dainty feet and a skirt that fell on the ground; in  short, a woman and&mdash;a lady!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; she faltered, very much frightened; then quickly: &ldquo;Show me, show  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  pointed out the marks in the heavy dust of the long neglected floor; they were  unmistakable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;what it is to be a detective! But who could have been here? Who  would want to be here? I think it is horrible myself, and if I were alone I  should faint from terror and the close air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will not remain much longer,&rdquo; I assured her, going straight to the couch. &ldquo;I do  not like it either, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  have you found now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  voice seemed to come from a great distance behind me. Was this on account of  the state of her nerves or mine? I am willing to think the latter, for at that  moment my eye took in two unexpected details. A dent as of a child&rsquo;s head in  one of the mangy sofa-pillows and a crushed bit of colored sugar which must  once have been a bit of choice confectionery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  one besides a lady has been here,&rdquo; I decided, pointing to the one and bringing  back the other. &ldquo;See! this bit of candy is quite fresh. You must acknowledge  that. <i>This</i> was not walled up years ago with the rest of the things we  see about us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes stared at the sugary morsel I held out toward her in my open palm. Then  she made a sudden rush which took her to the side of the couch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gwendolen  here?&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;Gwendolen here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I began; &ldquo;do not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="c00050-images/page192.jpg" width="800" height="646"></p>
  <p>But  she had already left the spot and was backing toward the opening up which we  had come. As she met my eye she made a quick turn and plunged below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must have air,&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
  <p>With  a glance at the floor over which she had so rapidly passed, I hastily followed  her, smiling grimly to myself. Intentionally or unintentionally, she had by  this quick passage to and fro effectually confused, if not entirely  obliterated, those evidences of a former intrusion which, with misguided  judgment, I had just pointed out to her. But recalling the still more perfect  line of footprints left below to which I had not called her attention, I felt  that I could afford to ignore the present mishap.</p>
  <p>As  I reached the cellar bottom I called to her, for she was already half-way  across.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you notice where the boards had been sawed?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;The sawdust is still on  the floor, and it smells as fresh as if the saw had been at work there  yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, no doubt,&rdquo; she answered back over her shoulder, still hurrying on so  that I had to run lest she should attempt the steps in utter darkness.</p>
  <p>When  I reached the floor of the bungalow she was in the open door panting. Watching  her with one eye, I drew back the trap into place and replaced the rug and the  three nails I had loosened. Then I shut the slide of the lantern and joined her  where she stood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you feel better?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;It was a dismal quarter of an hour. But it was not  a lost one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  drew the door to and locked it before she answered; then it was with a  question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you make of all this, Mr. Trevitt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  replied as directly as the circumstances demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,  it is a startling answer to the question you put me before we first left your  house. You asked then if the child in the wagon was Gwendolen. How could it  have been she with this evidence before us of her having been concealed here at  the very time that wagon was being driven away from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think you have reason enough&mdash;&rdquo; she began and stopped, and did not speak  again till we halted at the foot of her own porch. Then with the frank accent  most in keeping with her general manner, however much I might distrust both  accent and manner, she added as if no interval had intervened: &ldquo;If those signs  you noted are proofs to you that Gwendolen was shut up in that walled-off  portion of the bungalow while some were seeking her in the water and others in  the wagon, <i>then where is she now</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  &ldquo;We Shall Have To Begin Again&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>It  was a leading question which I was not surprised to see accompanied by a very  sharp look from beneath the cloudy wrap she had wound about her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  suspect some one or something,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Carew, with a return of the  indefinable manner which had characterized her in the beginning of our  interview. &ldquo;Whom? What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  should have liked to answer her candidly, and in the spirit, if not the words,  of the prophet of old, but her womanliness disarmed me. With her eyes on me I  could get no further than a polite acknowledgment of defeat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Carew, I am all at sea. We shall have to begin again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she answered like an echo&mdash;was it sadly or gladly?&mdash;&ldquo;you will have to begin  again.&rdquo; Then with a regretful accent: &ldquo;And I can not help you, for I am going  to sail to-morrow. I positively must go. Cablegrams from the other side hurry  me. I shall have to leave Mrs. Ocumpaugh in the midst of her distress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  time does your steamer sail, Mrs. Carew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, from the Cunard docks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nearly  sixteen hours from now. Perhaps fate&mdash;or my efforts&mdash;will favor us before then  with some solution of this disheartening problem. Let us hope so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  quick shudder to hide which she was reaching out her hand, when the door behind  us opened and a colored girl looked out. Instantly and with the slightest  possible loss of self-possession Mrs. Carew turned to motion the intruder back,  when the girl suddenly blurted out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mrs. Carew, Harry is so restless. He is sleepy, he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will be up instantly. Tell him that I will be up instantly.&rdquo; Then as the girl  disappeared, she added, with a quick smile: &ldquo;You see I haven&rsquo;t any toys for  him. Not being a mother I forgot to put them in his trunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  though in response to these words the maid again showed herself in the doorway.  &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Carew,&rdquo; she eagerly exclaimed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little toy in the hall  here, brought over by one of Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s maids. The girl said that hearing  that the little boy fretted, Mrs. Ocumpaugh had picked out one of her little  girl&rsquo;s playthings and sent it over with her love. It&rsquo;s a little horse, ma&rsquo;am,  with curly mane and a long tail. I am sure &lsquo;twill just please Master Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew turned upon me a look brimming with feeling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  thoughtfulness! What self-control!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Take up the horse, Dinah. It  was one of Gwendolen&rsquo;s favorite playthings,&rdquo; she explained to me as the girl  vanished.</p>
  <p>I  did not answer. I was hearing again in my mind that desolate cry of &ldquo;Philo!  Philo! Philo!&rdquo; which an hour or so before had rung down to me from Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s open window. There had been a wildness in the tone, which spoke of  a tossing head on a feverish pillow. Certainly an irreconcilable picture with  the one just suggested by Mrs. Carew of the considerate friend sending out the  toys of her lost one to a neighbor&rsquo;s peevish child.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew appeared to notice the preoccupation with which I lingered on the lower  step.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  like children,&rdquo; she hazarded. &ldquo;Or have you interested yourself in this matter  purely from business reasons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Business  reasons were sufficient,&rdquo; was my guarded reply. &ldquo;But I like children very much.  I should be most happy if I could see this little Harry of yours nearer. I have  only seen him from a distance, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  drew back a step; then she met my look squarely in the moonlight. Her face was  flushed, but I attempted no apology for a presumption which could have but one  excuse. I meant that she should understand me if I did not her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You <i>must</i> love children,&rdquo; she remarked, but not with her usual correctness of  tone. Then before I could attempt an answer to the implied sarcasm a proud  light came into her eyes, and with a gracious bend of her fine figure she met  my look with one equally as frank, and cheerfully declared:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall. Come early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  another moment she had vanished inside and closed the door. I was defeated for  the nonce, or else she was all she appeared to be and I a dreaming fool.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    Espionage</b></h2>
  <p>As  I moved slowly away into the night the question thus raised in my own mind  assumed greater and more vital consequence. Was she a true woman or what my  fears pictured her&mdash;the scheming, unprincipled abductor of Gwendolen Ocumpaugh?  She looked true, sometimes acted so; but I had heard and seen what would rouse  any man&rsquo;s suspicions, and though I was not in a position to say: &ldquo;Mrs. Carew,  this was not your first visit to that scene of old tragedy. You have been there  before, and with Gwendolen in your arms,&rdquo; I was morally certain that this was  so; that Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s most trusted friend was responsible for the  disappearance of her child, and I was not quite sure that the child was not now  under her very roof.</p>
  <p>It  was very late by this time, but I meant, if possible, to settle some of these  doubts before I left the neighborhood of the cottage.</p>
  <p>How?  By getting a glimpse of Mrs. Carew with her mask off; in the company of the  child, if I could compass it; if not, then entirely alone with her own  thoughts, plans and subtleties.</p>
  <p>It  was an act more in line with my partner&rsquo;s talents than my own, but I could not  afford to let this deter me. I had had my chance with her, face to face. For  hours I had been in her company. I had seen her in various stages of emotion,  sometimes real and sometimes assumed, but at no moment had I been sure of her,  possibly because at no moment had she been sure of me. In our first visit to  the bungalow; in her own little library, during the reading of that engrossing  tale by which she had so evidently attempted to lull my suspicions awakened by  her one irrepressible show of alarm on the scene of Gwendolen&rsquo;s disappearance,  and afterward when she saw that they might be so lulled but not dispelled; in  the cellar; and, above all, in that walled-off room where we had come across  the signs of Gwendolen&rsquo;s presence, which even she could not disavow, she had  felt my eyes upon her and made me conscious that she had so felt them. Now she  must believe them removed, and if I could but gain the glimpse I speak of I  should see this woman as she was.</p>
  <p>I  thought I could manage this.</p>
  <p>I  had listened to the maid&rsquo;s steps as she returned up stairs, and I believed I  knew in what direction they had tended after she reached the floor above. I  would just see if one of the windows on the south side was lighted, and, if so,  if it was in any way accessible.</p>
  <p>To  make my way through the shrubbery without rousing the attention of any one  inside or out required a circumspection that tried me greatly. But by dint of  strong self-control I succeeded in getting to the vantage-place I sought,  without attracting attention or causing a single window to fly up. This  reassured me, and perceiving a square of light in the dark mass of wall before  me I peered about among the trees overlooking this part of the building for one  I could climb without too much difficulty.</p>
  <p>The  one which looked most feasible was a maple with low-growing branches, and  throwing off my coat I was soon half-way to its top and on a level, or nearly  so, with the window on which I had fixed my eye.</p>
  <p>There  were no curtains to this window&mdash;the house being half dismantled in anticipation  of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s departure&mdash;but it was still protected by a shade, and this was  drawn down, nearly to the ledge.</p>
  <p>But  not quite. A narrow space intervened which, to an eye placed where mine was,  offered a peep-hole of more or less satisfactory proportions, and this space, I  soon saw, widened perceptibly from time to time as the wind caught at the shade  and blew it in.</p>
  <p>With  utmost caution I shifted my position till I could bring my eye fairly in line  with the interior of this room, and finding that the glimpse given revealed  little but a blue wall and some snowy linen, I waited for the breeze to blow  that I might see more.</p>
  <p>It  came speedily, and in a gust which lifted the shade and thus disclosed the  whole inside of the room. It was an instantaneous glimpse, but in that moment  the picture projected upon my eye satisfied me that, despite my doubts, despite  my causes for suspicion, I had been doing this woman the greatest injustice in  supposing that her relations to the child she had brought into her home were  other than she had made out.</p>
  <p>She  had come up as she had promised, and had seated herself on the bed with her  face turned toward the window. I could thus catch its whole expression&mdash;an  expression this time involuntary and natural as the feelings which prompted it.  The child, with his newly-obtained toy clutched in one hand, knelt on the  coverlet with his head pressed against her breast, saying his prayers. I could  hear his soft murmur, though I could not catch the words.</p>
  <p>But  sweet as was the sight of his little white-clad form burying its head, with its  mass of dusky curls, against the breast in which he most confided, it was not  this alone which gave to the moment its almost sacred character. It was the  rapturous look with which Mrs. Carew gazed down on this little head&mdash;the  mother-look, which admits of nothing false, and which when once seen on a woman&rsquo;s  face, whether she be mother in fact or mother only in heart&mdash;idealizes her in  the mind for ever.</p>
  <p>Eloquent  with love and holy devotion the scene flashed upon my eyes for a moment and was  gone. But that moment made its impression, and settled for good and all the  question with which I had started upon this adventure. She <i>was</i> the true  woman and I was the dreaming fool.</p>
  <p>As  I realized this I also realized that three days out of the seven were gone.</p>

    A Phantasm</b></h2>
  <p>I  certainly had every right to conclude that this would end my adventures for the  day. But I soon found that I was destined to have yet another experience before  returning to my home in New York.</p>
  <p>The  weather had changed during the last hour and at the moment I emerged from the  shadows of the hedge-row into the open space fronting the Ocumpaugh dock, a  gleam of lightning shot across the west and by it I saw what looked like the  dusky figure of a man leaning against a pile at the extreme end of the  boat-house. Something in the immobility maintained by this figure in face of  the quick flashes which from time to time lit up the scene, reminded me of the  presence I had come upon hours before in front of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s house; and moved  by the instinct of my calling, I took advantage of the few minutes yet  remaining before train time, to make my way in its direction, cautiously, of  course, and with due allowance for the possible illumination following those  fitful bursts of light which brought everything to view in one moment, only to  plunge it all back into the profoundest obscurity the next.</p>
  <p>I  had two motives for my proceeding. One, as I say, sprang from the natural  instinct of investigation; the other was kindlier and less personal.</p>
  <p>I  did not understand the meaning of the posture which this person had now  assumed; nor did I like it. Why should this man&mdash;why should any man stand like  this at the dead of night staring into waters, which, if they had their tale to  tell, had not yet told it&mdash;unless his interest in the story he read there was  linked with emotions such as it was my business to know? For those most openly  concerned in Gwendolen&rsquo;s loss, the search had ceased; why, then, this lone and  lingering watch on the part of one who might, for all I knew, be some  over-zealous detective, but who I was rather inclined to believe was a person  much more closely concerned in the child&rsquo;s fate, viz: the next heir-in-law, Mr.  Rathbone. If it were he, his presence there savored of mystery or it savored of  the tragic. The latter seemed the more likely hypothesis, judging from the  expression of his face, as seen by me under the lantern. It behooved me then to  approach him, but to approach him in the shadow of the boat-house.</p>
  <p>What  passed in the next few minutes seemed to me unreal and dreamlike. I was tired,  I suppose, and so more than usually susceptible. Night had no unfamiliar  effects for me, even night on the borders of this great river; nor was my  occupation a new one, or the expectation I felt, as fearful and absorbing as  that with which an hour or two before I had raised my lantern in that room in  which the doleful mystery of half a century back, trenched upon the still more  moving mystery of to-day. Yet, that experience had the sharpness of fact; while  this had only the vagueness of a phantasm.</p>
  <p>I  was very near him but the lightning had ceased to flash, and I found it  impossible to discern whether or not the form I had come there to identify, yet  lingered in its old position against the pile.</p>
  <p>I  therefore awaited the next gleam with great anxiety, an anxiety only partly  alleviated by the certainty I felt of hearing the faint, scarcely recognizable  sound of his breathing. Had the storm passed over? Would no more flashes come?  Ah, he is moving&mdash;that is a sigh I hear&mdash;no detective&rsquo;s exclamation of  impatience, but a sufferer&rsquo;s sigh of depression or remorse. What was in the man&rsquo;s  mind?</p>
  <p>A  steamboat or some equally brilliantly illuminated craft was passing, far out in  the channel; the shimmer of its lights gave sudden cheer to the distant  prospect; the churning of its paddles suggested life and action and  irresistibly drew my eyes that way. Would his follow? Would I find his attitude  changed?</p>
  <p>Ah!  the long delayed flash has come and gone. He is standing there yet, but no  longer in an attitude of contemplation. On the contrary, he is bending over the  waters searching with eager aspect, where so many had searched before him, and,  in the instant, as his face and form leaped into sight, I beheld his clenched  right hand fall on his breast and heard on his lips the one word&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guilty!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  &ldquo;An All-Conquering Beauty&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>I  was one of the first to procure and read a New York paper next morning. Would I  discover in the columns any hint of the preceding day&rsquo;s events in Yonkers,  which, if known, must for ever upset the wagon theory? No, that secret was  still my secret, only shared by the doctor, who, so far as I understood him,  had no intention of breaking his self-imposed silence till his fears of some  disaster to the little one had received confirmation. I had therefore several  hours before me yet for free work.</p>
  <p>The  first thing I did was to hunt up Miss Graham.</p>
  <p>She  met me with eagerness; an eagerness I found it difficult to dispel with my  disappointing news in regard to Doctor Pool.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not the man,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Can you think of any other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head, her large gray eyes showing astonishment and what I felt bound  to regard as an honest bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to mention a name,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  I know?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know of no other person capable of wronging that child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are probably right. But there is a gentleman&mdash;one interested in the family&mdash;a man  with something to gain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Rathbone? You must not mention him in any such connection. He is one of the  best men I know&mdash;kind, good, and oh, so sensitive! A dozen fortunes wouldn&rsquo;t  tempt a man of his stamp to do any one living a wrong, let alone a little  innocent child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; but there are other temptations greater than money to some men;  infinitely greater to one as sensitive as you say he is. What if he loved a  woman! What if his only hope of winning her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must not think that of him,&rdquo; she again interposed. &ldquo;Nothing could make a  villain of <i>him</i>. I have seen him too many times in circumstances which  show a man&rsquo;s character. He is good through and through, and in all that  concerns Gwendolen, honorable to the core. I once saw him save her life at the  risk of his own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did? When? Years ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  lately; within the last year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did. They were convincing. As I listened, the phantasm of the night before  assumed fainter and fainter proportions. When she had finished I warmly  remarked that I was glad to hear the story of so heroic an act.</p>
  <p>And  I was. Not that I ascribed too deep a significance to the word which had  escaped Mr. Rathbone on the dock, but because I was glad to have my instinctive  confidence in the man verified by facts.</p>
  <p>It  seemed to clear the way before me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ellie,&rdquo;  said I (it seemed both natural and proper to call her by that name now), &ldquo;what  explanation would you give if, under any circumstances (all circumstances are  possible, you know), you heard this gentleman speak of feeling guilty in  connection with Gwendolen Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should have to know the circumstances,&rdquo; was her quiet answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me imagine some. Say that it was night, late night, at an hour when the most  hardened amongst us are in a peculiarly responsive condition; say that he had  been, spending hours near the house of the woman he had long loved but had  quite despaired of winning in his greatly hampered condition, and with the  fever of this longing upon him, but restrained by emotions the nature of which  we can not surmise, had now found his way down to the river&mdash;to the spot where  boats have clustered and men crouched in the gruesome and unavailing search we  know of; say that he hung there long over the water, gazing down in silence, in  solitude, alone, as he thought, with his own conscience and the suggestions  offered by that running stream where some still think, despite facts, despite  all the probabilities, that Gwendolen has found rest, and when his heart was  full, should be seen to strike his breast and utter, with a quick turn of his  face up the hill, this one word, &lsquo;Guilty&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  would I think? This: That being overwrought by the struggle you mention (a  struggle we can possibly understand when we consider the unavoidable  consciousness which must be his of the great change which would be effected in  all his prospects if Gwendolen should not be found), he gave the name of guilt  to feelings which some would call simply human.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ellie,  you are an oracle.&rdquo; This thought of hers had been my thought ever since I had  had time really to reflect upon the matter. &ldquo;I wonder if you will have an  equally wise reply to give to my next question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not say. I speak from intuition; I am not really wise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Intuition  is above wisdom. Does your intuition tell you that Mrs. Carew is the true  friend she professes to be to Mrs. Ocumpaugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that is a different thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  clear brow I loved&mdash;there! how words escape a man!&mdash;lost its smoothness and her  eyes took on a troubled aspect, while her words came slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know how to answer that offhand. Sometimes I have felt that her very  soul was knit to that of Mrs. Ocumpaugh, and again I have had my doubts. But  never deep ones; never any such as would make it easy for me to answer the  question you have just put me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  her love for Gwendolen sincere?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; oh, yes. That is, I always thought so, and with no qualification, till  something in her conduct when she first heard of Gwendolen&rsquo;s disappearance&mdash;I  can not describe it&mdash;gave me a sense of disappointment. She was shocked, of  course, and she was grieved, but not hopelessly so. There was something lacking  in her manner&mdash;we all felt it; Mrs. Ocumpaugh felt it, and let her dear friend  go the moment she showed the slightest inclination to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  were excuses for Mrs. Carew, just at that time,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You forget the new  interest which had come into her life. It was natural that she should be  preoccupied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  thoughts of her little nephew?&rdquo; replied Miss Graham. &ldquo;True, true; but she had  been so fond of Gwendolen! You would have thought&mdash;But why all this talk about  Mrs. Carew? You don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;you surely can not believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Mrs. Carew is a charming woman? Oh, yes, but I do. Mr. Rathbone shows good  taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  is she the one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you not know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  yet I have seen them together many times. Now I understand much that has always  been a mystery to me. He never pressed his suit; he loved, but never harassed  her. Oh, he is a good man!&rdquo; This with emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she a good woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Graham&rsquo;s eyes suddenly fell, then rose again until they met mine fully and  frankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no reason,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to believe her otherwise. I have never seen  anything in her to hinder my esteem; only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finish  that &lsquo;only.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  does not appeal to me as many less gifted women do. Perhaps I am secretly  jealous of the extreme fondness Gwendolen has always shown for her. If so, the  fault is in me, not in her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  I said in reply is not germane to this story.</p>
  <p>After  being assured by a few more discreet inquiries in some other perfectly safe  quarters that Miss Graham&rsquo;s opinion of Mr. Rathbone was shared by those who  best knew him, I returned to the one spot most likely to afford me a clue to,  if no explanation of, this elusive mystery.</p>
  <p>What  did I propose to myself? First, to revisit Mrs. Carew and make the acquaintance  of the boy Harry. I no longer doubted his being just what she called him, but  she had asked me to call for this purpose and I had no excuse for declining the  invitation, even if I had desired to do so. Afterward&mdash;but first let us finish  with Mrs. Carew.</p>
  <p>As  she entered her reception-room that morning she looked so bright&mdash;that is, with  the instinctive brightness of a naturally vivacious temperament&mdash;that I wondered  if I had been mistaken in my thought that she had had no sleep all that night,  simply because many of the lights in her house had not been put out till  morning. But an inspection of her face revealed lines of care, which only her  smile could efface, and she was not quite ready for smiles, affable and  gracious as she showed herself.</p>
  <p>Her  first words, just as I expected, were:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is nothing in the papers about the child in the wagon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  everything does not get into the papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  what we saw and what we found in the bungalow last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hardly think so. That is our own special clue, Mrs. Carew&mdash;if it is a clue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to regard it as such.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a shrug I declared that we had come upon a mystery of some kind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the child is not dead? That you feel demonstrated&mdash;or don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I said last night, I do not know what to think. Ah; is that the little boy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she gaily responded, as the glad step of a child was heard descending the  stairs. &ldquo;Harry! come here, Harry!&rdquo; she cried, with that joyous accent which a  child&rsquo;s presence seems to call out in some women. &ldquo;Here is a gentleman who  would like to shake hands with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  sprite of a child entered; a perfect sunbeam irradiating the whole room. If,  under the confidence induced by the vision I had had of him on his knees the  night before, any suspicion remained in my mind of his being Gwendolen  Ocumpaugh in disguise, it vanished at sight of the fearless head, lifted high  in boyish freedom, and the gay swish, swish of the whip in his nervous little  hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry  is playing horse,&rdquo; he cried, galloping toward me in what he evidently  considered true jockey style.</p>
  <p>I  made a gesture and stopped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do, little man? What did you say your name is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo;  this very stoutly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry  what? Harry Carew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Harry; just Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how do you like it here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like it; I like it better than my old home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was your old home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was with uncongenial people, and he is very sensitive,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Carew,  softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like it here,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and I like the big ocean. I am going on the ocean.  And I like horses. Get up, Dandy!&rdquo; and he cracked his whip and was off again on  his imaginary trot.</p>
  <p>I  felt very foolish over the doubts I had so openly evinced. This was not only a  boy to the marrow of his bones, but he was, as any eye could see, the near  relative she called him. In my embarrassment I rose; at all events I soon found  myself standing near the door with Mrs. Carew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fine fellow!&rdquo; I enthusiastically exclaimed; &ldquo;and startlingly like you in expression.  He is your nephew, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she replied, somewhat wistfully I thought.</p>
  <p>I  felt that I should apologize for&mdash;well, perhaps for the change she must have  discerned in my manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  likeness caused me a shock. I was not prepared for it, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked at me quite wonderingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have never heard any one speak of it before. I am glad that you see it.&rdquo; And  she seemed glad, very glad.</p>
  <p>But  I know that for some reason she was gladder yet when I turned to depart.  However, she did not hasten me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do next?&rdquo; she inquired, as she courteously led the way through  the piles of heaped-up boxes and baskets, the number of which had rather grown  than diminished since my visit the evening before. &ldquo;Pardon my asking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Resort  to my last means,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;See and talk with Mrs. Ocumpaugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  instant of hesitation on her part, so short, however, that I could hardly  detect it, then she declared:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can not do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is ill; I am sure that they will let no one approach her. One of her maids was  in this morning. She did not even ask me to come over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I shall make the effort. The illness which affects Mrs.  Ocumpaugh can be best cured by the restoration of her child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you have not found Gwendolen?&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I have discovered footprints on the dust of the bungalow floor, and, as you  know, a bit of candy which looks as if it had been crushed in a sleeping child&rsquo;s  hand, and I am in need of every aid possible in order to make the most of these  discoveries. They may point the way to Gwendolen&rsquo;s present whereabouts and they  may not. But they shall be given every chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoop!  get up! get up!&rdquo; broke in a childish voice from the upper landing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I not right?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always;  only I am sorry for Mrs. Ocumpaugh. May I tell you&mdash;&rdquo; as I laid my hand upon the  outer door-knob&mdash;&ldquo;just how to approach her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  if you will be so good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would not ask for Miss Porter. Ask for Celia; she is Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s special  maid. Let her carry your message&mdash;if you feel that it will do any good to  disturb her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you; the recommendation is valuable. Good morning, Mrs. Carew. I may not see  you again; may I wish you a safe journey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly;  are we not almost friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Why  did I not make my bow and go? There was nothing more to be said&mdash;at least by me.  Was I held by something in her manner? Doubtless, for while I was thus  reasoning with myself she followed me out on to the porch, and with some remark  as to the beauty of the morning, led me to an opening in the vines, whence a  fine view could be caught of the river.</p>
  <p>But  it was not for the view she had brought me there. This was evident enough from  her manner, and soon she paused in her observations on the beauties of nature,  and with a strange ringing emphasis for which I was not altogether prepared,  remarked with feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may be making a mistake&mdash;I was always an unconventional woman&mdash;but I think you  ought to know something of Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s private history before you see her.  It is not a common one&mdash;at least it has its romantic elements&mdash;and an  acquaintance with some of its features is almost necessary to you if you expect  to approach her on so delicate a matter with any hope of success. But perhaps  you are better informed on this subject than I supposed? Detectives are a mine  of secret intelligence, I am told; possibly you have already learned from some  other source the story of her marriage and homecoming to Homewood and the  peculiar circumstances of her early married life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I disclaimed in great relief, and I have no doubt with unnecessary vivacity. &ldquo;On  the contrary, I have never heard anything said in regard to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you like to? Men have not the curiosity of women, and I do not wish to bore  you, but&mdash;I see that I shall not do that,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Sit down, Mr.  Trevitt; I shall not detain you long; I have not much time myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  she sank into a chair in saying this, I had no alternative but to follow her  example. I took pains, however, to choose one which brought me into the shadow  of the vines, for I felt some embarrassment at this new turn in the  conversation, and was conscious that I should have more or less difficulty in  hiding my only too intense interest in all that concerned the lady of whom we  were speaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Ocumpaugh was a western woman,&rdquo; Mrs. Carew began softly; &ldquo;the oldest of five  daughters. There was not much money in the family, but she had beauty, a  commanding, all-conquering beauty; not the beauty you see in her to-day, but  that exquisite, persuasive loveliness which seizes upon the imagination as well  as moves the heart. I have a picture of her at eighteen&mdash;but never mind that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  it affection for her friend which made Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s always rich voice so very  mellow? I wished I knew; but I was successful, I think, in keeping that wish  out of my face, and preserving my manner of the simply polite listener.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Ocumpaugh was on a hunting trip,&rdquo; she proceeded, after a slight glance my way. &ldquo;He  had traveled the world over and seen beautiful women everywhere; but there was  something in Marion Allison which he had found in no other, and at the end of  their first interview he determined to make her his wife. A man of impulses,  but also a man of steady resolution, Mr. Trevitt. Perhaps you know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  bowed. &ldquo;A strong man,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a romantic one. He had this intention from the first, as I have said, but he  wished to make himself sure of her heart. He knew how his advantages counted;  how hard it is for a woman to disassociate the man from his belongings, and having  a spirit of some daring, he resolved that this &lsquo;pearl of the west&rsquo;&mdash;so I have  heard him call her&mdash;should marry the man and not his money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he as wealthy then as now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost.  Possibly he was not quite such a power in the financial world, but he had  Homewood in almost as beautiful a condition as now, though the new house was  not put up till after his marriage. He courted her&mdash;not as the landscape painter  of Tennyson&rsquo;s poem&mdash;but as a rising young business man who had made his way  sufficiently to give her a good home. This home he did not have to describe,  since her own imagination immediately pictured it as much below the one she  lived in, as he was years younger than her hardworked father. Delighted with  this na&iuml;vet&eacute;, he took pains not to disabuse her mind of the simple prospects  with which she was evidently so well satisfied, and succeeded in marrying her  and bringing her as far as our station below there, without her having the  least suspicion of the splendor she was destined for. And now, Mr. Trevitt,  picture, if you can, the scene of that first arrival. I have heard it described  by him and I have heard it described by her. He was dressed plainly; so was  she; and lest the surprise should come before the proper moment, he had brought  her on a train little patronized by his friends. The sumptuousness of the  solitary equipage standing at the depot platform must, in consequence, have  struck her all the more forcibly, and when he turned and asked her if she did  not admire this fine turn-out, you can imagine the lovely smile with which she  acknowledged its splendor and then turned away to look up and down for the  street-car she expected to take with him to their bridal home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  says that he caught her back with the remark that he was glad she liked it  because it was hers and many more like it. But she insists that he did not say  a word, only smiled in a way to make her see for whom the carriage door was  being held open. Such was her entrance into wealth and love and alas! into  trouble. For the latter followed hard upon the two first. Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s  mother, who had held sway at Homewood for thirty years or more, was hard as the  nether millstone. She was a Rathbone and had brought both wealth and  aristocratic connections into the family. She had no sympathy for penniless  beauties (she was a very plain woman herself) and made those first few years of  her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s life as nearly miserable as any woman&rsquo;s can be who adores  her husband. I have heard that it was a common experience for this  sharp-tongued old lady to taunt her with the fact that she brought nothing into  the family but herself&mdash;not even a <i>towel</i>; and when two years passed and  no child came, the biting criticisms became so frequent that a cloud fell over  the young wife&rsquo;s sensitive beauty, which no after happiness has ever succeeded  in fully dispelling. Matters went better after Gwendolen came, but in reckoning  up the possible defects in Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s character you should never forget  the twist that may have been given to it by that mother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard of Madam Ocumpaugh,&rdquo; I remarked, rising, anxious to end an interview  whose purport was more or less enigmatic to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is dead now&mdash;happily. A woman like that is accountable for much more than she  herself ever realizes. But one thing she never succeeded in doing: she never  shook Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s love for his wife or hers for him. Whether it was the  result of that early romantic episode of which I have spoken, or whether their  natures are peculiarly congenial, the bond between them has been one of  exceptional strength and purity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be their comfort now,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew smiled, but in a dubious way that added to my perplexity and made me  question more seriously than ever just what her motive had been in subjecting  me to these very intimate reminiscences of one I was about to approach on an  errand of whose purport she could have only a general idea.</p>
  <p>Had  she read my inmost soul? Did she wish to save her friend, or save herself, or  even to save me from the result of a blind use of such tools as were the only  ones afforded me? Impossible to determine. She was at this present moment, as  she had always been, in fact, an unsolvable problem to me, and it was not at  this hurried time and with such serious work before me that I could venture to  make any attempt to understand her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will let me know the outcome of your talk with Mrs. Ocumpaugh?&rdquo; she cried, as I  moved to the front of the porch.</p>
  <p>It  was for me to look dubious now. I could make no such promise as that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will let you know the instant there is any good news,&rdquo; I assured her.</p>
  <p>And  with that I moved off, but not before hearing the peremptory command with which  she entered the house:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Dinah, quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Evidently,  her preparations for departure were to be pushed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    In The Green Boudoir</b></h2>
  <p>So  far in this narrative I have kept from the reader nothing but an old experience  of which I was now to make use. This experience involved Mrs. Ocumpaugh, and  was the cause of the confidence which I had felt from the first in my ability  to carry this search through to a successful termination. I believed that in  some secret but as yet undiscovered way, it offered a key to this tragedy. And  I still believed this, little as I had hitherto accomplished and blind as the  way continued to look before me.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless,  it was with anything but a cheerful heart that I advanced that morning through  the shrubbery toward the Ocumpaugh mansion.</p>
  <p>I  dreaded the interview I had determined to seek. I was young, far too young, to  grapple with the difficulties it involved; yet I saw no way of avoiding it, or  of saving either Mrs. Ocumpaugh or myself from the suffering it involved.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew had advised that I should first see the girl called Celia. But Mrs. Carew  knew nothing of the real situation. I did not wish to see any girl. I felt that  no such intermediary would answer in a case like this. Nor did I choose to  trust Miss Porter. Yet to Miss Porter alone could I appeal.</p>
  <p>The  sight of a doctor&rsquo;s gig standing at the side door gave me my first shock. Mrs.  Ocumpaugh was ill, then, really ill. Yet if I came to make her better? I stood  irresolute till I saw the doctor come out; then I walked boldly up and asked  for Miss Porter.</p>
  <p>Just  what Mrs. Carew had advised me not to do.</p>
  <p>Miss  Porter came. She recognized me, but only to express her sorrow that Mrs.  Ocumpaugh was totally unfit to see any one to-day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if he brings news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have news, but of a delicate nature. I should like the privilege of imparting  the same to Mrs. Ocumpaugh herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, if I urge it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can not see you. The doctor who has just gone says that at all hazards she must  be kept quiet to-day. Won&rsquo;t Mr. Atwater do? Is it&mdash;is it good news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  Mrs. Ocumpaugh alone can say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  Mr. Atwater; I will call him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to say to <i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me advise you. Leave it to Mrs. Ocumpaugh. Take this paper up to her&mdash;it is only  a sketch&mdash;and inform her that the person who drew it has something of importance  to say either to her or to Mr. Atwater, and let her decide which it shall be.  You may, if you wish, mention my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  hold my credentials,&rdquo; I said and smiled.</p>
  <p>She  glanced at the paper I had placed in her hand. It was a folded one, fastened  something like an envelope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not conceive,&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
  <p>I  did not scruple to interrupt her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Ocumpaugh has a right to the privilege of seeing what I have sketched there,&rdquo; I  said with what impressiveness I could, though my heart was heavy with doubt. &ldquo;Will  you believe that what I ask is for the best and take this envelope to her? It  may mean the ultimate restoration of her child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  paper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Miss Porter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not try to hide her incredulity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not see how a picture&mdash;yet you seem very much in earnest&mdash;and I know she has  confidence in you, she and Mr. Ocumpaugh, too. I will take it to her if you can  assure me that good will come of it and no more false hopes to destroy the  little courage she has left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not promise that. I believe that she will wish to receive me and hear all I  have to say after seeing what that envelope contains. That is as far as I can  honestly go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does not satisfy me. If it were not for the nearness of Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s return,  I would have nothing to do with it. He must hear at Sandy Hook that some definite  news has been received of his child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right, Miss Porter, he must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  idolized Gwendolen. He is a man of strong feelings; very passionate and much  given to follow the impulse of the moment. If his suspense is not ended at the  earliest possible instant, the results may be such as I dare not contemplate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it; that is why I have pushed matters to this point. You will carry that  up to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  ifs. Lay it before her where she sits and come away. But not beyond call. You  are a good woman&mdash;I see it in your face&mdash;do not watch her as she unfolds this  paper. Persons of her temperament do not like to have their emotions observed,  and this will cause her emotion. That can not be helped, Miss Porter. Sincerely  and honestly I tell you that it is impossible for her best friends to keep her  from suffering now; they can only strive to keep that suffering from becoming  permanent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a hard task you have set me,&rdquo; complained the poor woman; &ldquo;but I will do what  I can. Anything must be better for Mrs. Ocumpaugh than the suspense she is now  laboring under.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo;  I enjoined, with the full force of my secret anxiety, &ldquo;that no eye but hers  must fall upon this drawing. Not that it would convey meaning to anybody but  herself, but because it is her affair and her affair only, and you are the  woman to respect another person&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave me a final scrutinizing look and left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  grant that I have made no mistake!&rdquo; was the inward prayer with which I saw her  depart.</p>
  <p>My  fervency was sincere. I was myself frightened at what I had done.</p>
  <p>And  what had I done? Sent her a sketch drawn by myself of Doctor Pool and of his  office. If it recalled to her, as I felt it must, the remembrance of a certain  memorable visit she had once paid there, she would receive me.</p>
  <p>When  Miss Porter re&euml;ntered some fifteen minutes later, I saw that my hazardous  attempt had been successful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;  said she; but with no cheerful alacrity, rather with an air of gloom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was&mdash;was  Mrs. Ocumpaugh very much disturbed by what she saw?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear so. She was half-asleep when I went in, dreaming as it seemed, and  pleasantly. It was cruel to disturb her; indeed I had not the heart, so I just  laid the folded paper near her hand and waited, but not too near, not within  sight of her face. A few minutes later&mdash;interminable minutes to me&mdash;I heard the  paper rattle, but I did not move. I was where she could see me, so she knew  that she was not alone and presently I caught the sound of a strange noise from  her lips, then a low cry, then the quick inquiry in sharper and more peremptory  tones than I had ever before heard from her, &lsquo;Where did this come from? Who has  dared to send me this?&rsquo; I advanced quickly. I told her about you and your  desire to see her; how you had asked me to bring her up this little sketch so  that she would know that you had real business with her; that I regretted  troubling her when she felt so weak, but that you promised revelations or some  such thing&mdash;at which I thought she grew very pale. Are you quite convinced that  you have news of sufficient importance to warrant the expectations you have  raised in her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see her,&rdquo; I prayed.</p>
  <p>She  made a sign and we both left the room.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Ocumpaugh awaited me in her own boudoir on the second floor. As we went up the  main staircase I was afforded short glimpses of room after room of varying  richness and beauty, among them one so dainty and delicate in its coloring that  I presumed to ask if it were that of the missing child.</p>
  <p>Miss  Porter&rsquo;s look as she shook her head roused my curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should be glad to see her room,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>She  stopped, seemed to consider the matter for a moment, then advanced quickly and,  beckoning me to follow, led me to a certain door which she quietly opened. One  look, and my astonishment became apparent. The room before me, while large and  sunny, was as simple, I had almost said as bare, as my sister&rsquo;s at home. No  luxurious furnishings here, no draperies of silk and damask, no half-lights  drawing richness from stained glass, no gleam of silver or sparkle of glass on  bedecked dresser or carved mantel. Not even the tinted muslins I had seen in  some nurseries; but a plain set of furniture on a plain carpet with but one  object of real adornment within the four walls. That was a picture of the  Madonna opposite the bed, and that was beautiful. But the frame was of the  cheapest&mdash;a simple band of oak.</p>
  <p>Catching  Miss Porter&rsquo;s eye as we quietly withdrew, I ventured to ask whose taste this  was.</p>
  <p>The  answer was short and had a decided ring of disapproval in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  mother&rsquo;s. Mrs. Ocumpaugh believes in simple surroundings for children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she dressed Gwendolen like a princess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  for the world&rsquo;s eye. But in her own room she wore gingham aprons which  effectually covered up her ribbons and laces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  motive for all this was in a way evident to me, but somehow what I had just  seen did not add to my courage for the coming interview.</p>
  <p>We  stopped at the remotest door of this long hall. As Miss Porter opened it I  summoned up all my nerve, and the next moment found myself standing in the  presence of the imposing figure of Mrs. Ocumpaugh drawn up in the embrasure of  a large window overlooking the Hudson. It was the same window, doubtless, in  which she had stood for two nights and a day watching for some sign from the boats  engaged in dragging the river-bed. Her back was to me and she seemed to find it  difficult to break away from her fixed attitude; for several minutes elapsed  before she turned slowly about and showed me her face.</p>
  <p>When  she did, I stood appalled. Not a vestige of color was to be seen on cheek, lip  or brow. She was the beautiful Mrs. Ocumpaugh still, but the heart which had  sent the hues of life to her features, was beating slow&mdash;slow&mdash;and the effect was  heartbreaking to one who had seen her in her prime and the full glory of her  beauty as wife and mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo;  I faltered out, bowing my head as if before some powerful rebuke, though her  lips were silent and her eyes pleading rather than accusing. Truly, I had  ventured far in daring to recall to this woman an hour which at this miserable  time she probably would give her very life to forget. &ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; I repeated,  with even a more humble intonation than before, for she did not speak and I  hardly knew how to begin the conversation. Still she said nothing, and at last  I found myself forced to break the unbearable silence by some definite remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have presumed,&rdquo; I therefore continued, advancing but a step toward her who made  no advance at all, &ldquo;to send you a hurried sketch of one who says he knows you,  that you might be sure I was not one of the many eager but irresponsible men  who offer help in your great trouble without understanding your history or that  of the little one to whose seemingly unaccountable disappearance all are  seeking a clue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  history!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  words seemed forced from her, but no change in eye or look accompanied them;  nor could I catch a motion of her lips when she presently added in a far-away  tone inexpressibly affecting, &ldquo;<i>Her</i> history! Did he bid you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Pool? He has given me no commands other than to find the child. I am not here  as an agent of his. I am here in Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s interest and your own; with  some knowledge&mdash;a little more knowledge than others have perhaps&mdash;to aid me in  the business of recovering this child. Madam, the police are seeking her in the  holes and slums of the great city and at the hands of desperate characters who  make a living out of the terrors and griefs of the rich. But this is not where  I should look for Gwendolen Ocumpaugh. I should look nearer, just as you have  looked nearer; and I should use means which I am sure have not commended  themselves to the police. These means you can doubtless put in my hands. A  mother knows many things in connection with her child which she neither thinks  to impart nor would, under any ordinary circumstances, give up, especially to a  stranger. I am not a stranger; you have seen me in Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s confidence;  will you then pardon me if I ask what may strike you as impertinent questions,  but which may lead to the discovery of the motive if not to the method of the  little one&rsquo;s abduction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand&mdash;&rdquo; She was trying to shake off her apathy. &ldquo;I feel confused,  sick, almost like one dying. How can I help? Haven&rsquo;t I done everything? I  believe that she strayed to the river and was drowned. I still believe her  dead. Otherwise we should have news&mdash;real news&mdash;and we don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  intensity with which she uttered the last two words brought a line of red into  her gasping lips. She was becoming human, and for a minute I could not help  drawing a comparison between her and her friend Mrs. Carew as the latter had  just appeared to me in her little half-denuded house on the other side of the  hedge-row. Both beautiful, but owing their charms to quite different sources, I  surveyed this woman, white against the pale green of the curtain before which  she stood, and imperceptibly but surely the glowing attractions of the  gay-hearted widow who had found a child to love, faded before the cold  loveliness of this bereaved mother, wan with suffering and alive with terrors  of whose depth I could judge from the clutch with which she still held my  little sketch.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  I had attempted some kind of answer to Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s heart-rending appeal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  do not hear because she was not taken from you simply for the money her return  would bring. Indeed, after hours of action and considerable thinking, I am  beginning to doubt if she was taken for money at all. Can you not think of some  other motive? Do you not know of some one who wanted the child from&mdash;<i>love</i>,  let us say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did  her lips frame it, or did I see it in her eyes? Certainly I heard no sound, yet  I was conscious that she repeated the word in her mind, if not aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know I have startled you,&rdquo; I pursued. &ldquo;But, pardon me&mdash;I can not help my  presumption&mdash;I must be personal&mdash;I must even go so far as to probe the wound I  have made. You have a claim to Gwendolen not to be doubted, not to be gainsaid.  But isn&rsquo;t there some one else who is conscious of possessing certain claims  also? I do not allude to Mr. Ocumpaugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean&mdash;some relative&mdash;aunt&mdash;cousin&mdash;&rdquo; She was fully human now, and very keenly  alert. &ldquo;Mr. Rathbone, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mrs. Ocumpaugh, none of these.&rdquo; Then as the paper rattled in her hand and I saw  her eyes fall in terror on it, I said as calmly and respectfully as I could: &ldquo;You  have a secret, Mrs. Ocumpaugh; that secret I share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  paper trembled from her clasp and fell fluttering downward. I pointed at it and  waited till our eyes met, possibly that I might give her some encouragement  from my look if not from my words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was a boy in Doctor Pool&rsquo;s employ some five years ago, and one day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  paused; she had made me a supplicating gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I not go on?&rdquo; I finally asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me a minute,&rdquo; was her low entreaty. &ldquo;O God! O God! that I should have thought  myself secure all these years, with two in the world knowing my fatal secret!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  learned it by accident,&rdquo; I went on, when I saw her eye turn again on mine. &ldquo;On  a certain night six years ago, I was in the office behind an old curtain&mdash;you  remember the curtain hanging at the left of the doctor&rsquo;s table over that break  in the book-shelves. I had no business there. I had been meddling with things  which did not belong to me and, when I heard the doctor&rsquo;s step at the door, was  glad to shrink into this refuge and wait for an opportunity to escape. It did  not come very soon. First he had one patient, then another. The last one was  you; I heard your name and caught a glimpse of your face as you went out. It  was a very interesting story you told him&mdash;I was touched by it though I hardly  understood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was swaying from side to side, swaying so heavily that I instinctively pushed  forward a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit,&rdquo;  I prayed. &ldquo;You are not strong enough for this excitement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  glanced at me vaguely, shook her head, but made no move toward accepting the  proffered chair. She submitted, however, when I continued to press it upon her;  and I felt less a brute and hard-hearted monster when I saw her sitting with  folded hands before me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  bring this up,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you may understand what I mean when I say that  some one else&mdash;another woman, in fact, may feel her claim upon this child  greater than yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean the real mother. Is she known? The doctor swore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know the real mother. I only know that you are not; that to win some  toleration from your mother-in-law, to make sure of your husband&rsquo;s lasting  love, you won the doctor over to a deception which secured a seeming heir to  the Ocumpaughs. Whose child was given you, is doubtless known to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stared, aghast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  You do not know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I did not wish to. Nor was she ever to know me or my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  this hope has also failed. I thought that in this mother, we might find the  child&rsquo;s abductor.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  &ldquo;You Look As If&mdash;As If&mdash;&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>I  had studiously avoided looking at her while these last few words passed between  us, but as the silence which followed this final outburst continued, I felt  forced to glance her way if only to see what my next move should be. I found  her gazing straight at me with a bright spot on either cheek, looking as if  seared there by a red-hot iron.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a detective,&rdquo; she said, as our regards met. &ldquo;You have known this shameful  secret always, yet have met my husband constantly and have never told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I saw no reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you never, when you saw how completely my husband was deceived, how fortunes  were bequeathed to Gwendolen, gifts lavished on her, her small self made almost  an idol of, because all our friends, all our relatives saw in her a true Ocumpaugh,  think it wicked to hold your peace and let this all go on as if she were the  actual offspring of my husband and myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I may have wondered at your happiness; I may have thought of the consequences  if ever he found out, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  dared not go on; the quick, the agonizing nerve of her grief and suffering had  been touched and I myself quailed at the result. Stammering some excuse, I  waited for her soundless anguish to subside; then, when I thought she could  listen, completed my sentence by saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not allow my thoughts to stray quite so far, Mrs. Ocumpaugh. Not till my  knowledge of your secret promised to be of use did I let it rise to any  proportion in my mind. I had too much sympathy for your difficulties; I have  to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  hint of comfort, perhaps from the only source which could afford her any,  seemed to move her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean that you are my friend?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That you would help me, if any  help were possible, to keep my secret and&mdash;my husband&rsquo;s love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did not know how to dash the first spark of hope I had seen in her from the  beginning of this more than painful interview. To avoid it, I temporized a  trifle and answered with ready earnestness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would do much, Mrs. Ocumpaugh, to make the consequences of your act as  ineffective as possible and still be true to the interests of Mr. Ocumpaugh. If  the child can be found&mdash;you wish that? You loved her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  yes, I loved her.&rdquo; There was no mistaking the wistfulness of her tone. &ldquo;Too  well, far too well; only my husband more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can find her&mdash;that is the first thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a faint rejoinder. I looked at her again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>You  do not wish her found</i>,&rdquo; I suddenly declared.</p>
  <p>She  started, rose to her feet, then suddenly sat again as if she felt that she  could not stand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you say that? How dare you? how can you say that? My husband loves her, I  love her&mdash;she is our own child, if not by birth, by every tie which endears a  child to a parent. Has that wicked man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Pool!&rdquo; I put in, for she stopped, gasping.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Doctor Pool, whom I wish to God I had never seen&mdash;has he told you any such lies  as that? the man who swore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  put out my hand to calm her. I feared for her reason if not for her life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  careful,&rdquo; I enjoined. &ldquo;Your walls are thick but tones like yours are penetrating.&rdquo;  Then as I saw she would be answered, I replied to the question still alive in  her face: &ldquo;No; Doctor Pool has not talked of you. I saw it in your own manner,  madam; it or something else. Perhaps it was something else&mdash;another secret which  I have not shared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  moistened her lips and, placing her two hands on the knobs of the chair in  which she sat, leaned passionately forward. Who could say she was cold now? Who  could see anything but a feeling heart in this woman, beautiful beyond all  precedent in her passion and her woe?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is&mdash;it was&mdash;a secret. I have to confess to the abnormal. The child did not love  me; has never loved me. Lavish as I have been in my affection and caresses, she  has never done aught but endure them. Though she believes me her own mother,  she has shrunk from me with all the might of her nature from the very first. It  was God&rsquo;s punishment for the lie by which I strove to make my husband believe  himself the father which in God&rsquo;s providence he was not. I have borne it; but  my life has been a living hell. It was that you saw in my face&mdash;nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was bound to believe her. The child had made her suffer, but she was bent upon  recovering her&mdash;of course. I dared not contemplate any other alternative. Her  love for her husband precluded any other desire on her part. And so I admitted,  when after a momentary survey of the task yet before me, I ventured to remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we find ourselves once more at the point from which we started. Where shall we  look for his child? Mrs. Ocumpaugh, perhaps it would aid us in deciding this  question if you told me, sincerely told me, why you had such strong belief in  Gwendolen&rsquo;s having been drowned in the river. You did believe this&mdash;I saw you at  the window. You are not an actress like your friend&mdash;you expected to see her  body drawn from those waters. For twenty-four hours you expected it, though  every one told you it was impossible. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  crept a step nearer to me, her tones growing low and husky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you see? I&mdash;I&mdash;thought that to escape me, she might have leaped into the water.  She was capable of it. Gwendolen had a strong nature. The struggle between duty  and repulsion made havoc even in her infantile breast. Besides, we had had a  scene that morning&mdash;a secret scene in which she showed absolute terror of me. It  broke my heart, and when she disappeared in that mysterious way&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;one of  her shoes was found on the slope, what was I to think but that she had chosen  to end her misery&mdash;this child! this babe I had loved as my own flesh and  blood!&mdash;in the river where she had been forbidden to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suicide  by a child of six! You gave another reason for your persistent belief, at the  time, Mrs. Ocumpaugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  I to give this one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  no one could expect you to do that, even if there had been no secret to  preserve and the child had been your own. But the child did not go to the  river. You are convinced of that now, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  then did she go? Or rather, to what place was she taken? Somewhere near;  somewhere within easy reach, for the alarm soon rose and then she could not be  found. Mrs. Ocumpaugh, I am going to ask you an apparently trivial and  inconsequent question. Was Gwendolen very fond of sweets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was sitting upright now, staring me in the face in unconcealed astonishment and  a little fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  sort of candy&mdash;pardon me if I seem impertinent&mdash;had you in your house on the  Wednesday the child disappeared? Any which she could have got at or the nurse  given her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  were the confections brought by the caterer; none other that I know of; I did  not indulge her much in sweets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  there anything peculiar about these confections either in taste or appearance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t taste them. In appearance they were mostly round and red, with a  brandied cherry inside. Why, sir, why do you ask? What have these miserable  lumps of sugar to do with Gwendolen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,  do you recognize this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  took from my pocket the crushed mass of colored sugar and fruit I had picked up  from the musty cushions of the old sofa in the walled-up room of the bungalow.</p>
  <p>She  took it and looked up, staring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is one of them,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where did you get it? You look as if&mdash;as if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had come upon a clue to Gwendolen? Madam, I believe I have. This candy has been  held in a hot little hand. Miss Graham or one of the girls must have given it  to her as she ran through the dining-room or across the side veranda on her way  to the bungalow. She did not eat it offhand; she evidently fell asleep before  eating it, but she clutched it very tight, only dropping it, I judge, when her  muscles were quite relaxed by sleep; and then not far; the folds of her dress  caught it, for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you telling me?&rdquo; The interruption was sudden, imperative. &ldquo;I saw Gwendolen  asleep; she held a string in her hand but no candy, and if she did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you examine both hands, madam? Think! Great issues hang on a right settlement  of this fact. Can you declare that she did not have this candy in one of her  little hands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can not declare that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I shall always believe she did, and this same sweetmeat, this morsel from the  table set for your guests on the afternoon of the sixteenth of this month, I  found last night in the disused portion of the bungalow walled up by Mr.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s father, but made accessible since by an opening let into the floor  from the cellar. This latter I was enabled to reach by means of a trap-door  concealed under the rug in the open part of this same building.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  am all confused. Say that again,&rdquo; she pleaded, starting once more to her feet,  but this time without meeting my eyes. &ldquo;In the disused part of the bungalow?  How came you there? No one ever goes there&mdash;it is a forbidden place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child has been there&mdash;and lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  her fingers began to tremble and twist themselves together. &ldquo;You have something  more than this to tell me. Gwendolen has been found and&mdash;&rdquo; her looks became  uncertain and wandered, as I thought, toward the river.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has not been found, but the woman who carried her into that place will soon be  discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?  Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had risen by this time and could answer her on a level and face to face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the trail of her steps leads straight along the cellar floor. We have but to  measure these footprints.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what?&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  find the abductor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  silence, during which one long breath issued from her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it a man&rsquo;s or woman&rsquo;s steps?&rdquo; she finally asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman&rsquo;s, daintily shod; a woman of about the size of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?  Why do you play with my anguish?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I hate to mention the name of a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  What do you know of my friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much. I happened to meet one of them, and as she is a very fine woman with  exquisitely shod feet, I naturally think of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; Her hand was on my arm, her face close to mine. &ldquo;Speak! speak!  the name!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Carew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had purposely refrained up to this moment from bringing this lady, even by a  hint, into the conversation. I did it now under an inner protest. But I had not  dared to leave it out. The footprints I alluded to were startlingly like those  left by her in other parts of the cellar floor; besides, I felt it my duty to  see how Mrs. Ocumpaugh bore this name, notwithstanding my almost completely  restored confidence in its owner.</p>
  <p>She  did not bear it well. She flushed and turned quickly from my side, walking away  to the window, where she again took up her stand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would have shown better taste by not following your first impulse,&rdquo; she  remarked. &ldquo;Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s footsteps in that old cellar! You presume, sir, and  make me lose confidence in your judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s feet have been all over that cellar floor. She accompanied  me through it last night, at the time I found this crushed bonbon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  could see that Mrs. Ocumpaugh was amazed, well-nigh confounded, but her manner  altered from that moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  I did. I related the doubts I had felt concerning the completeness of the  police investigation as regarded the bungalow; my visit there at night with  Mrs. Carew, and the discoveries we had made. Then I alluded again to the  footprints and the important clue they offered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the child?&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Where is the child? If taken there, why wasn&rsquo;t  she found there? Don&rsquo;t you see that your conclusions are all wild&mdash;incredible? A  dream? An impossibility?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  go by the signs,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;There seems to be nothing else to go by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you want&mdash;you intend, to measure those steps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is why I am here, Mrs. Ocumpaugh. To request permission to continue this  investigation and to ask for the key to the bungalow. Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s is no longer  available; or rather, I should prefer to proceed without it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  sudden impulse she advanced rapidly toward me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is Mrs. Carew doing this morning?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Preparing  for departure. She is quite resolved to sail to-day. Do you wish to see her? Do  you wish her confirmation of my story? I think she will come, if you send for  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need.&rdquo; This after an instant&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;I have perfect confidence in  Mrs. Carew; and in you too,&rdquo; she added, with what she meant for a kind look.  She was by nature without coquetry, and this attempt to please, in the midst of  an overwhelming distress absorbing all her faculties, struck me as the most  pitiful effort I had ever seen. My feeling for her made it very hard for me to  proceed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I may go on?&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, of course. I don&rsquo;t know where the key is; I shall have to give orders.  You will wait a few minutes, somewhere in one of the adjoining rooms, while I  look up Mr. Atwater?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was trembling, feverish, impatient.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall <i>I</i> not look up Mr. Atwater for you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I am feeling better. I can go myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  another moment she had left the room, having forgotten her own suggestion that  I should await her return in some adjoining apartment.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    Frenzy</b></h2>
  <p>Five  minutes&mdash;ten minutes&mdash;elapsed and I became greatly impatient. I walked the floor;  I stared from the window; I did everything I could think of to pass away these  unendurable moments of suspense with creditable self-possession. But I failed  utterly.</p>
  <p>As  the clock ticked off the quarter hour, and then the half, I grew not only  impatient but seriously alarmed, and flinging down the book I had taken up as a  last resort, stepped from the room, in the hope of coming across some one in  the hall whom I could interrogate.</p>
  <p>But  the house seemed strangely quiet, and when I had walked the full length of the  hall without encountering either maid or mistress, I summoned up courage to  return to the room I had left and ring the bell.</p>
  <p>No  answer, though I waited long for it.</p>
  <p>Thinking  that I had not pressed the button hard enough, I made a second attempt, but  again there was no answer.</p>
  <p>Was  anything amiss? Had she&mdash;</p>
  <p>My  thought did not complete itself. In sudden apprehension of I knew not what, I  dashed from the room and made my way down stairs without further ceremony.</p>
  <p>The  unnatural stillness which had attracted my attention above was repeated on the  floor below. No one in the rooms, no one in the passages.</p>
  <p>Disturbed  as I had not been yet by anything which had occurred in connection with this  harrowing affair, I leaped to the nearest door and stepped out on the lawn.</p>
  <p>My  first glance was toward the river. All was as usual there. With my worst fears  dispelled, but still a prey to doubts for which as yet I had no name, I moved  toward the kitchen windows, expecting of course to find some one there who  would explain the situation to me. But not a head appeared at my call. The  kitchen, too, was deserted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is not chance,&rdquo; I involuntarily exclaimed, and was turning toward the stables  when I perceived a child, the son of one of the gardeners, crossing the lawn at  a run, and hailing him, asked where everybody had gone that the house seemed  deserted.</p>
  <p>He  looked back but kept on running, shouting as he did so:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess they&rsquo;re all down at the bungalow! I&rsquo;m going there. Men are digging up the  cellar. Mrs. Ocumpaugh says she&rsquo;s afraid Miss Gwendolen&rsquo;s body is buried there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aghast  and perhaps a trifle conscience-stricken, I stood stock-still in the sunshine.  So this was what I had done! Driven her to frenzy; roused her imagination to  such a point that she saw her darling&mdash;always her darling even if another woman&rsquo;s  child&mdash;lying under the clay across which I had attempted simply to prove that  she had been carried. Or&mdash;no! I would not think that! A detective of my  experience outwitted by this stricken, half-dead woman whom I had trembled to  see try to stand upon her feet? Impossible! Yet the thought brought the blood  to my cheek.</p>
  <p>Digging  up the bungalow cellar! That meant destroying those footprints before I had  secured a single impression of the same. I should have roused her curiosity  only, not her terror.</p>
  <p>Now  all might be lost unless I could arrive in time to&mdash;do what? Order the work  stopped? With what face could I do that with her standing by in all the  authority of motherhood&mdash;frenzied motherhood&mdash;seeking the possible body of her  child! My affair certainly looked dubious. Yet I started for the bungalow like  the rest, and on a run, too. Perhaps Providence would favor me and some  expedient suggest itself by which I might still save the clue upon which so  many hopes hung.</p>
  <p>The  excitement which had now drawn every person on the place in the one direction,  was at its height as I burst through the thicket into the path running  immediately about the bungalow. Those who could get in at the door had done so,  filling the room whence Gwendolen had disappeared, with awe-struck men and  chattering women. Some had been allowed to descend through the yawning  trap-door, down which all were endeavoring to peer, and, fortified by this  fact, I armed myself with an appearance of authority despite my sense of  presumption, and pushed and worked my own way to these steps, saying that I had  come to aid Mrs. Ocumpaugh, whose attention I declared I had been the first to  direct to this place.</p>
  <p>Struck  with my manner if not with my argument, they yielded to my importunity and  allowed me to pass down. The stroke of the spade and the harsh voice of the man  directing the work greeted my disquieted ears. With a bound I cleared the last  half-dozen steps and, alighting on the cellar bottom, was soon able, in spite  of the semi-darkness, to look about me and get some notion of the scene.</p>
  <p>A  dozen men were working&mdash;the full corps of gardeners without doubt&mdash;and a single  glance sufficed to show me that such of the surface as had not been upturned by  their spades had been harried by their footsteps. Useless now to promulgate my  carefully formed theory, with any hope of proof to substantiate it. The crushed  bonbon, the piled-up boxes and the freshly sawed hole were enough without doubt  to establish the fact that the child had been carried into the walled-up room  above, but the link which would have fixed the identity of the person so  carrying her was gone from my chain of evidence for ever. She who should have  had the greatest interest in establishing this evidence was leaning on the arm  of Miss Porter and directing, with wavering finger and a wild air, the  movements of the men, who, in a frenzy caught from her own, dug here and dug  there as that inexorable finger pointed.</p>
  <p>Sobs  choked Miss Porter; but Mrs. Ocumpaugh was beyond all such signs of grief. Her  eyes moved; her breast heaved; now and then a confused command left her lips,  but that was all. Yet to me she was absolutely terrifying, and it took all the  courage left from my disappointment for me to move so as to attract her  attention. When I saw that I had succeeded in doing this, I regretted the  impulse which had led me to break into her mood. The change which my sudden  appearance caused in her was too abrupt; too startling. I feared the effects,  and put up my hand in silent deprecation as her lips essayed to move in what  might be some very disturbing command. If she heeded it I can not say. What she  said was this:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the child&mdash;I&rsquo;m looking for the child! She was brought here. You proved that she  was brought here. Then why don&rsquo;t we find her, or&mdash;or her little innocent body?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="c00050-images/page268.jpg" width="800" height="641"></p>
  <p>I  did not attempt an answer; I dared not&mdash;I merely turned away into a corner,  where I should be out of the way of the men. A thought was rising in my mind; a  thought which might have led to some definite action if her voice had not risen  shrilly and with a despairing utterance in these words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Useless!  It is not here she will be found. I was mad to think it. Pull up your spades  and go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  murmur of relief from one end of the cellar to the other, and every spade was  drawn out of the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could have told you,&rdquo; ventured one more hardy than the rest, &ldquo;that there was no  use disturbing this old clay for any such purpose. Any one could see that no  spade has been at work here before in years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said  that I was mad,&rdquo; she repeated, and waved the men away.</p>
  <p>Slowly  they retreated with clattering spades and a heavy tread. The murmur which  greeted them above slowly died out, and the bungalow was deserted by all but  our three selves. When quite sure of this, I turned, and Miss Porter&rsquo;s eyes met  mine with a reproachful glance easy enough for me to understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will go, too,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Ocumpaugh. &ldquo;Oh! this has been like losing my  darling for the second time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Real  grief is unmistakable. Recognizing the heartfelt tone in which these words were  uttered, I recurred to the idea of frenzy with all the sympathy her situation  called for. Yet I felt that I could not let her leave before we had come to  some understanding. But how express myself? How say here and now in the  presence of a sympathetic but unenlightened third party what it would certainly  be difficult enough for me to utter to herself in the privacy of that secluded  apartment in which we had met and talked before our confidence was broken into  by this impetuous act of hers.</p>
  <p>Not  seeing at the moment any natural way out of my difficulties, I stood in painful  confusion, conscious of Miss Porter&rsquo;s eyes and also conscious that unless some  miracle came to my assistance I must henceforth play but a sorry figure in this  affair, when my eyes, which had fallen to the ground, chanced upon a morsel of  paper so insignificant in size and of such doubtful appearance that the two  ladies must have wondered to see me stoop and with ill-concealed avidity pick  it up and place it in my pocket.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Ocumpaugh, whose false strength was fast leaving her, now muttered some words  which were quite unintelligible to me, though they caused Miss Porter to make  me a motion very expressive of a dismissal. I did not accept it as such,  however, without making one effort to regain my advantage. At the foot of the  steps I paused and glanced back at Mrs. Ocumpaugh. She was still looking my  way, but her chin had fallen on her breast, and she seemed to sustain herself  erect only by a powerful effort. Again her pitiable and humiliating position  appealed to me, and it was with some indication of feeling that I finally said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I not to have an opportunity of finishing the conversation so unhappily  interrupted, Mrs. Ocumpaugh? I am not satisfied, and I do not believe you can  be, with the partial disclosures I then made. Afford me, I pray, a continuation  of that interview, if only to make plain to me your wishes. Otherwise I may  fall into some mistake&mdash;say or do something which I might regret&mdash;for matters can  not stand where they are. You know that, do you not, madam?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ad&egrave;le!  go! go!&rdquo; This to Miss Porter. &ldquo;I must have a few words more with Mr. Trevitt. I  had forgotten what I owe him in the frenzy which possessed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you wish to talk to him <i>here</i>?&rdquo; asked that lady, with very marked  anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; it is too cold, too dark. I think I can walk to Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s. Will you join  me there, Mr. Trevitt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  bowed; but as she passed near me in going out, I whispered in her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should suggest that we hold our talk anywhere but at Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s house, since  she is liable to be the chief subject of our conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  more than ever. Her share in the child&rsquo;s disappearance was not eliminated or  affected in any way by the destruction of her footprints.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will go back to the house; I will see him in my own room,&rdquo; Mrs. Ocumpaugh  suddenly announced to her greatly disturbed companion. &ldquo;Mr. Trevitt will follow  in a few minutes. I must have time to think&mdash;to compose myself&mdash;to decide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was evidently thinking aloud. Anxious to save her from any self-betrayal, I  hastily interrupted her, saying quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will be at your boudoir door in a half-hour from now. I myself have something  to think of in the interim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  careful!&rdquo; It was Miss Porter who stopped to utter this word in my ear. &ldquo;Be very  careful, I entreat. Her heart-strings are strained almost to breaking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  answered with a look. She could not be more conscious of this than I was.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  &ldquo;What Do You Know?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>I  was glad of that half-hour. I, too, wanted a free moment in which to think and  examine the small scrap of paper I had picked up from this cellar floor. In the  casual glance I had given it, it had seemed to offer me a fresh clue, quite  capable of replacing the old one; and I did not change my mind on a second  examination; the shape, the hue, the few words written on it, even the musty  smell pervading it, all going to prove it to be the one possible link which  could reunite the chain whose continuity I had believed to be gone for ever.</p>
  <p>Rejoicing  in my good luck, yet conscious of still moving in very troubled waters, I cast  a glance in the direction of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s house, from the door of the bungalow  whence I had seen Mrs. Ocumpaugh depart, and asked myself why Mrs. Carew, of  all persons in the vicinity, had been the only one to hang back from this scene  of excitement. It was not like her to hide herself at such a crisis (how  invariably she had followed me in each and every visit I had paid here!), and  though I remembered all her reasons for preoccupation, her absence under the  present conditions bore an aspect of guilt which sent my mind working in a  direction which was not entirely new to me, but which I had not as yet  resolutely faced.</p>
  <p>Guilt!  The word recalled that other and similar one uttered by Mr. Rathbone in that  adventure which had impressed me as so unreal, and still held its place in my  mind as something I had dreamed.</p>
  <p>He  was looking up when he said it, up the hill, up toward Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s house. He  had struck his own breast, but he had looked up, not down; and though I had  naturally associated the word he had used with himself&mdash;and Miss Graham, with a  womanly intuition, had supplied me with an explanation of the same which was  neither far-fetched nor unnatural, yet all through this day of startling  vicissitudes and unimaginable interviews, faint doubts, bidden and unbidden,  had visited my mind, which at this moment culminated in what I might call the  irresistible question as to whether he might not have had in mind some one  nearer and dearer than himself when he uttered that accusing word.</p>
  <p>Her  position, as I saw it now, did not make this supposition too monstrous for  belief; that is, if she secretly loved this man who did not dare, or was too  burdened with responsibility, to woo her. And who can penetrate a woman&rsquo;s mind?  To give him&mdash;possibly without his knowledge&mdash;what every one who knew him declared  him to stand in special need of&mdash;money and relief from too exacting work&mdash;might  have seemed motive enough to one of her warm and impulsive temperament, for  eliminating the child she cared for, but not as she cared for him. It was hard  to think it; it would be harder yet to act upon it; but the longer I stood  there brooding, the more I felt my conviction grow that from her and from her  alone, we should yet obtain definite traces of the missing child, if only Mrs.  Ocumpaugh would uphold me in the attempt.</p>
  <p>But  would Mrs. Ocumpaugh do this? I own that I had my doubts. Some hidden cause or  instinct which I had not been able to reach, though I had plunged deep into the  most galling secrets of her life, seemed to stand in the way of her full  acceptance of the injury I believed her to have received from Mrs. Carew; or  rather, in the way of her public acknowledgment of it. Though she would fain  have this upturning of the bungalow cellar pass for an act of frenzy, I could  not quite bring myself to look upon it as such since taking a final observation  of its condition.</p>
  <p>Though  her professed purpose had been to seek the body of her child, the spades had  not gone deeper than their length. It had been harrowing, not digging, she had  ordered, and harrowing meant nothing more than an obliteration of the  footprints which I had menaced her with comparing with those of Mrs. Carew. Why  this show of consideration to one she might call friend, but who could hold no  comparison in her mind with the safely or recovery of the child which, if not  hers, was the beloved object of her husband&rsquo;s heart and only too deeply  cherished by herself? Did she fear her charming neighbor? Was the bond between  them founded on something besides love, and did she apprehend that a discovery  of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s connection with Gwendolen&rsquo;s disappearance would only  precipitate her own disgrace and open up to public recognition the false  relationship she held toward the little heiress? Hard questions these, but ones  which must soon be faced and answered; for wretched as was Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s  position and truly as I sympathized with her misery, I was none the less  resolved, to force such acknowledgments from her as would allow me to approach  Mrs. Carew with a definite accusation such as even that daring spirit could not  withstand.</p>
  <p>Thus  resolved, and resisting all temptation to hazard an interview with the latter  lady before I had seen Mrs. Ocumpaugh again, I made my way up slowly through  the grounds and entered by the side door just as my watch told me that the  half-hour of my waiting was over.</p>
  <p>Miss  Porter was in the upper hall, but turned aside at my approach with a meaning  gesture in the direction of the boudoir. I thought that her eyes looked red;  certainly she was trembling very much; and with this poor preparation for an  interview before which the strongest and most experienced man might quail, I  advanced for the second time that morning to the door behind which the  distracted mother awaited me.</p>
  <p>If  I knocked I do not remember it. I rather think she opened the door for me  herself upon hearing my step in the hall. At all events we were soon standing  again face to face, and the battle of our two wills&mdash;for it would be nothing  less now&mdash;had begun.</p>
  <p>She  was the first to speak. Braving my inquiring look with eyes in whose depths  determination struggled with growing despair, she asked me peremptorily, almost  wildly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you told any one? Do you mean to publish my shame to the world? I see decision  in your face. Does it mean that? Tell me! Does it mean that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  madam; far be it from me to harbor such an intention unless driven to it by the  greatest necessity. Your secret is your own; my only reason for betraying my knowledge  of it was the hope I cherished of its affording us some clue to the identity of  Gwendolen&rsquo;s abductor. It has not done so yet, may never do so; then let us  leave that topic and return to the clue offered by the carrying of that child  into the long-closed room back of the bungalow. Mrs. Ocumpaugh, intentionally  or unintentionally, the proof upon which I relied for settling the identity of  the person so carrying her has been destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a flush which her seemingly bloodless condition made perfectly startling, she  drew back, breaking into wild disclaimers:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know&mdash;I fear&mdash;I was too wild&mdash;too eager. I thought only of what might lie under  that floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a half-foot of earth, madam? The spades did not enter any deeper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a sudden access of courage, born possibly of her despair, she sought neither to  attempt denial nor palliate the fact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if this was my intention&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t acknowledge it&mdash;you must recognize my  reason. I do not believe&mdash;you can not make me believe&mdash;that Gwendolen was carried  into that room by Mrs. Carew. But I could see that you believed it, and to save  her the shame of such an accusation and all that might follow from it, I&mdash;oh,  Mr. Trevitt, you do not think this possible! Do you know so little of the  impulses of a mind, bewildered as mine has been by intolerable suffering?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can understand madness, and I am willing to think that you were mad just  then&mdash;especially as no harm has been done and I can still accuse Mrs. Carew of a  visit to that room, with the proof in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; The steady voice was faltering, but I could not say with what  emotion&mdash;hope for herself&mdash;doubt of me&mdash;fear for her friend; it might have been  any of these; it might have been all. &ldquo;Was there a footprint left, then? You  say proof. Do you mean proof? A detective does not use that word lightly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be sure that I would not,&rdquo; I returned. Then in answer to the appeal of her  whole attitude and expression: &ldquo;No, there were no footprints left; but I came  upon something else which I have sufficient temerity to believe will answer the  same purpose. Remember that my object is first to convince you and afterward  Mrs. Carew, that it will be useless for her to deny that she has been in that  room. Once that is understood, the rest will come easy; for we know the child  was there, and it is not a place she could have found alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  proof!&rdquo; She had no strength for more than that &ldquo;The proof! Mr. Trevitt, the  proof!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  put my hand in my pocket, then drew it out again empty, making haste, however,  to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Ocumpaugh, I do not want to distress you, but I must ask you a few questions  first. Do you know the secret of that strangely divided room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  in a general way. Mr. Ocumpaugh has never told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not seen the written account of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  given into Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s hand such an account?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew&rsquo;s duplicity was assuming definite proportions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  there is such an account and I have listened to a reading of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  madam. Mrs. Carew read it to me last night in her own house. She told me it  came to her from your hands. You see she is not always particular in her  statements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  lift of the hand, whether in deprecation or appeal I could not say, was all the  answer this received. I saw that I must speak with the utmost directness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  account was in the shape of a letter on several sheets of paper. These sheets  were very old, and were torn as well as discolored. I had them in my hand and  noticed that a piece was lacking from one of them. Mrs. Ocumpaugh, are you  ready to repeat that Mrs. Carew did not receive this old letter from you or  obtain it in any way you know of from the house we are now in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had rather not be forced to contradict Mrs. Carew,&rdquo; was the low reply; &ldquo;but in  justice to you I must acknowledge that I hear of this letter for the first  time. God grant&mdash;but what can any old letter have to do with the agonizing  question before us? I am not strong, Mr. Trevitt&mdash;I am suffering&mdash;do not confuse  and burden me, I pray&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon,  I am not saying one unnecessary word. These old sheets&mdash;a secret from the  family&mdash;did not come from this house. Whence, then, did they come into Mrs.  Carew&rsquo;s possession? I see you have forestalled my answer; and if you will now  glance at this end of paper, picked up by me in your presence from the cellar  floor across which we both know that her footsteps have passed, you will see  that it is a proof capable of convicting her of the fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  held out the scrap I now took from my pocket.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s hand refused to take it or her eyes to consult it.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless  I still held it out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  read the few words you will find there,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;They are in explanation of  the document itself, but they will serve to convince you that the letter to  which they were attached, and which is now in Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s hands, came from  that decaying room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; The gesture which accompanied this exclamation was more than one of  refusal, it was that of repulse. &ldquo;I can not see&mdash;I do not need to&mdash;I am  convinced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, but that is not enough, Mrs. Ocumpaugh. I want you to be certain. Let me  read these words. The story they prefaced is unknown to you; let it remain so;  all I need to tell you about it is this: that it was written by Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s  father&mdash;he who raised this partition and who is the undoubted author of these  lines. Remember that they headed the letter:</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perish  with the room whose ceiling oozes blood! If in time to come any man reads these  lines, he will know why I pulled down the encircling wall built by my father,  and why I raised a new one across this end of the pavilion.&rsquo;&ldquo;</i> </p>
  <p>Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blood!&rdquo;  she repeated. &ldquo;A ceiling oozing blood!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  old superstition, Mrs. Ocumpaugh, quite unworthy your attention at this moment.  Do not let your mind dwell upon that portion of what I have read, but on the  word &lsquo;<i>room</i>&rsquo;. &lsquo;Perish with the room!&rsquo; We know what room was meant; there  can be but one. I have myself seen the desk from which these sheets were  undoubtedly taken&mdash;and for them to be in the hand of a certain person argues&mdash;&rdquo;  Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s hand went up in dissuasion, but I relentlessly finished&mdash;&ldquo;that  she has been in that room! Are you more than convinced of this now? Are you  sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not need to make reply; eyes and attitude spoke for her. But it was the  look and attitude of despair, not hope. Evidently she had the very greatest  reason to fear Mrs. Carew, who possibly had her hard side as well as her  charming one.</p>
  <p>To  ease the situation, I spoke what was in both our minds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that you are sure. That makes my duty very plain, Mrs. Ocumpaugh. My next  visit must be upon Mrs. Carew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  spirit which, from the beginning of this later interview, had infused fresh  strength into her feeble frame, seemed to forsake her at this simple  declaration; her whole form drooped, and the eyes, which had rested on mine,  turned in their old way to the river.</p>
  <p>I  took advantage of this circumstance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  one who knows you well, who knows the child well, dropped the wrong shoe into  the river.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  murmur, nothing more, from Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s set lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  it&mdash;I do not say that it was&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see any reason why it should be&mdash;but could  it have been Mrs. Carew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  a sound this time, not a sound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was down at the dock that night. Did you know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  gesture, but whether of assent or dissent I could not tell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  know of no other person who was there but the men employed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;What  do you know?&rdquo;</i> </p>
  <p>With  all her restraint gone&mdash;a suffering and despairing woman, Mrs. Ocumpaugh was on  her knees, grasping my arm with both hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quit  this torture! tell me that you know it all and leave me to&mdash;to&mdash;die!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was confounded; and as I looked at her face, strained back in wild appeal, I  was more than confounded, I was terrified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,  what does this mean? Are you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lock  the door!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;no one must come in here now. I have said so much that I  must say more. Listen and be my friend; oh, be my friend! <i>Those were my  footsteps you saw in the bungalow. It was I who carried Gwendolen into that  secret hole.</i>&rdquo;</p>

    Providence</b></h2>
  <p>Had  I suspected this? Had all my efforts for the last half-hour been for the  purpose of entrapping her into some such avowal? I do not know. My own feelings  at the time are a mystery to me; I blundered on, with a blow here and a blow  there, till I hit this woman in a vital spot, and achieved the above mentioned  result.</p>
  <p>I  was not happy when I reached it. I felt no elation; scarcely any relief. It all  seemed so impossible. She marked the signs of incredulity in my face and spoke  up quickly, almost sharply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not believe me. I will prove the truth of what I say. Wait&mdash;wait!&rdquo;&mdash;and  running to a closet, she pulled out a drawer&mdash;where was her weakness now?&mdash;and  brought from it a pair of soiled white slippers. &ldquo;If the house had been  ransacked,&rdquo; she proceeded pantingly, &ldquo;these would have told their own tale. I  was shocked when I saw their condition, and kept my guests waiting till I  changed them. Oh, they will fit the footprints.&rdquo; Her smile was ghastly. Softly  she set the shoes down. &ldquo;Mrs. Carew helped me; she went for the child at night.  Oh, we are in a terrible strait, we two, unless you will stand by us like a  friend&mdash;and you will do that, won&rsquo;t you, Mr. Trevitt? No one else knows what I  have just confessed&mdash;not even Doctor Pool, though he suspects me in ways I never  dreamed of. Money shall not stand in the way&mdash;I have a fortune of my own  now&mdash;nothing shall stand in the way, if you will have pity on Mrs. Carew and  myself and help us to preserve our secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,  what secret? I pray you to make me acquainted with the whole matter in all its  details before you ask my assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you do not know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  altogether, and I must know it altogether. First, what has become of the child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is safe and happy. You have seen her; you mentioned doing so just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  rose before her in intense excitement. What a plot! I stood aghast at its  daring and the success it had so nearly met with.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  had moments of suspicion,&rdquo; I admitted, after a short examination of this  beautiful woman&rsquo;s face for the marks of strength which her part in this plot  seemed to call for. &ldquo;But they all vanished before Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s seemingly open  manner and the perfect boyishness of the child. Is she an actress  too&mdash;Gwendolen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  when she plays horse and Indian and other boyish games. She is only acting out her  nature. She has no girl tastes; she is all boy, and it was by means of these  instincts that Mrs. Carew won her. She promised her that if she would leave  home and go with her to Europe she would cut her hair and call her Harry, and  dress her so that every one would think her a boy. And she promised her  something else&mdash;that she should go to her father&mdash;Gwendolen idolizes Mr.  Ocumpaugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. You wonder why, if I loved my husband, I should send away the one  cherished object of his life. It is because our love was threatened by this  very object. I saw nothing but death and chaos before me if I kept her. My  husband adores the child, but he hates and despises a falsehood and my secret  was threatened by the one man who knows it&mdash;your Doctor Pool. My accomplice  once, he declared himself ready to become my accuser if the child remained  under the Ocumpaugh roof one day after the date he fixed for her removal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  I ejaculated, with sudden comprehension of the full meaning of the scrawls I  had seen in so many parts of the grounds. &ldquo;And by what right did he demand  this? What excuse did he give you? His wish for money, immense money&mdash;old miser  that he is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  for money I could have given him. His motive is a less tangible one. He has  scruples, he says&mdash;religious scruples following a change of heart. Oh, he was a  cruel man to meet, determined, inexorable. I could not move or influence him.  The proffer of money only hurt my cause. A fraud had been perpetrated, he said,  and Mr. Ocumpaugh must know it. Would I confess the truth to him myself? No.  Then he would do so for me and bring proofs to substantiate his statements. I  thought all was lost&mdash;my husband&rsquo;s confidence, his love, his pleasure even in  the child, for it was his own blood that he loved in her, and her connection  with his family of whose prestige he has an exaggerated idea. Made desperate by  the thought, I faced this cruel doctor&mdash;(it was in his own office; he had  presumed upon that old secret linking us together to summon me there)&mdash;and told  him solemnly that rather than do this I would kill myself. And he almost bade  me, &lsquo;Kill!&rsquo; but refrained when the word had half left his lips and changed it  to a demand for the child&rsquo;s immediate removal from the benefits it enjoyed  under false pretenses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  from this Mrs. Ocumpaugh went on to relate how he had told her that Gwendolen  had inherited fortunes because she was believed to be an Ocumpaugh; that not  being an Ocumpaugh she must never handle those fortunes, winding up with some  such language as this: &ldquo;Manage it how you will, only relieve me from the  oppression of feeling myself a party to the grossest of deceptions. Can not the  child run away and be lost? I am willing to aid you in that, even to paying for  her bringing up in some decent, respectable way, such as would probably have  been her lot if you had not interfered to place her in the way of millions.&rdquo; It  was a mad thought, half meant and apparently wholly impossible to carry out  without raising suspicions as damaging as confession itself. But it took an immediate  hold upon the miserable woman he addressed, though she gave little evidence of  it, for he proceeded to add in a hard tone: &ldquo;That or immediate confession to  your husband, with me by to substantiate your story. No slippery woman&rsquo;s tricks  will go down with me. Fix the date here and now and I promise to stand back and  await the result in total silence. Dally with it by so much as an hour, and I  am at your gates with a story that all must hear.&rdquo; Is it a matter of wonder  that the stricken woman, without counsel and prohibited, from the very nature  of her secret, from seeking counsel uttered the first one that came to mind and  went home to brood over her position and plan how she could satisfy his demands  with the least cost to herself, her husband and the child?</p>
  <p>Mr.  Ocumpaugh was in Europe. This was her one point of comfort. What was done could  be done in his absence, and this fact greatly minimized any risk she was likely  to incur. When he returned he would find the house in mourning, for she had  already decided within herself that only by apparent death could this child be  safely robbed of her endowments as an Ocumpaugh and an heiress. He would  grieve, but his grief would lack the sting of shame, and so in course of time  would soften into a lovely memory of one who had been as the living sunshine to  him and, like the sunshine, brief in its shining. Thus and thus only could she  show her consideration for him. For herself no consideration was possible. It  must always be her fate to know the child alive yet absolutely removed from  her. This was a sorrow capable of no alleviation, for Gwendolen was  passionately dear to her, all the dearer, perhaps, because the mother-thirst  had never been satisfied; because she had held the cup in hand but had never  been allowed to drink. The child&rsquo;s future&mdash;how to rob her of all she possessed,  yet secure her happiness and the prospect of an honorable estate&mdash;ah, there was  the difficulty! and one she quite failed to solve till, in a paroxysm of terror  and despair, after five sleepless nights, she took Mrs. Carew into her  confidence and implored her aid.</p>
  <p>The  free, resourceful, cheery nature of the broader-minded woman saw through the  difficulty at once. &ldquo;Give her to me,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I love little children  passionately and have always grieved over my childless condition. I will take  Gwendolen, raise her and fill her little heart so full of love she will never  miss the magnificence she has been brought to look upon as her birthright. Only  I shall have to leave this vicinity&mdash;perhaps the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you would be willing?&rdquo; asked the poor mother&mdash;mother by right of many years of  service, if not of blood.</p>
  <p>The  answer broke her heart though it was only a smile. But such a smile&mdash;confident,  joyous, triumphant; the smile of a woman who has got her heart&rsquo;s wish, while  she, she, must henceforth live childless.</p>
  <p>So  that was settled, but not the necessary ways and means of accomplishment; those  came only with time. The two women had always been friends, so their frequent  meetings in the green boudoir did not waken a suspicion. A sudden trip to  Europe was decided on by Mrs. Carew and by degrees the whole plot perfected. In  her eyes it looked feasible enough and they both anticipated complete success.  Having decided that the scheme as planned by them could be best carried out in  the confusion of a great entertainment, cards were sent out for the sixteenth,  the date agreed upon in the doctor&rsquo;s office as the one which should see a  complete change in Gwendolen&rsquo;s prospects. It was also settled that on the same  day Mrs. Carew should bring home, from a certain small village in Connecticut,  her little nephew who had lately been left an orphan. There was no deception  about this nephew. Mrs. Carew had for some time supplied his needs and paid for  his board in the farm-house where he had been left, and in the emergency which  had just come up, she took care to publish to all her friends that she was  going to bring him home and take him with her to Europe. Further, a market-man  and woman with whom Mrs. Carew had had dealings for years were persuaded to  call at her house shortly after three that afternoon, to take this nephew of  hers by a circuitous and prolonged ride through the country to an institution  in which she had had him entered under an assumed name. All this in one day.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Mrs. Carew undertook to open with her own hands a passage from the cellar of  the bungalow into the long closed room behind the partition. This was to insure  such a safe retreat for the child during the first search, that by no possibility  could anything be found to contradict the testimony of the little shoe which  Mrs. Ocumpaugh purposed presenting to all eyes as found on the slope leading to  that great burial-place, the river. Otherwise the child might have been passed  over to Mrs. Carew at once. All this being decided upon, each waited to perform  the part assigned her&mdash;Mrs. Carew in a fever of delight&mdash;for she was passionately  devoted to Gwendolen and experienced nothing but rapture at the prospect of  having this charming child all to herself&mdash;Mrs. Ocumpaugh, whose only recompense  would be freedom from a threatening exposure which would cost her the only  thing she prized, her husband&rsquo;s love, in a condition of cold dread, relieved  only by the burning sense of the necessity of impressing upon the whole world,  and especially upon Mr. Ocumpaugh, an absolute belief in the child&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>This  was her first care. To this her mind clung with an agony of purpose which was  the fittest preparation possible for real display of feeling when the time came.  But she forgot one thing&mdash;they both forgot one thing&mdash;that chance or Providence  might ordain that witnesses should be on the road below Homewood to prove that  the child did not cross the track at the time of her disappearance. To them it  seemed enough to plead the child&rsquo;s love for the water, her desire to be allowed  to fish, the opportunity given her to escape, and&mdash;the little shoes. Such  short-sightedness in face of a great peril could be pardoned Mrs. Ocumpaugh on  the verge of delirium under her cold exterior, but Mrs. Carew should have taken  this possibility into account; and would have done so, probably, had she not  been completely absorbed in the part she would be called upon to play when the  exchange of children should be made and Gwendolen be intrusted to her charge  within a dozen rods of her own home. This she could dwell on with the whole  force of her mind; this she could view in all its relations and make such a  study of as to provide herself against all contingencies. But the obvious  danger of a gang of men being placed just where they could serve as witnesses,  in contradiction of the one fact upon which the whole plot was based, never  even struck her imagination.</p>
  <p>The  nursery-governess whose heart was divided between her duty to the child and her  strong love of music, was chosen as their unconscious accomplice in this fraud.  As the time for the great musicale approached, she was bidden to amuse  Gwendolen in the bungalow, with the understanding that if the child fell asleep  she might lay her on the divan and so far leave her as to take her place on the  bench outside where the notes of the solo singers could reach her. That  Gwendolen would fall asleep and fall asleep soon, the wretched mother well  knew, for she had given her a safe but potent sleeping draft which could not  fail to insure a twelve hours&rsquo; undisturbed slumber to so healthy a child. The  fact that the little one had shrunk more than ever from her attentions that  morning both hurt and encouraged her. Certainly it would make it easier for  Mrs. Carew to influence Gwendolen. In her own mind filled with terrible images  of her husband&rsquo;s grief and her long prospective dissimulation, one picture rose  in brilliant contrast to the dark one embodying her own miserable future and  that of the soon-to-be bereaved father. It was that of the perfect joy of the  hungry-hearted child in the arms of the woman she loved best. It brought her  cheer&mdash;it brought her anguish. It was a salve to her conscience and a mortal  thrust in an already festering wound. She shut it from her eyes as much as  possible,&mdash;and so, the hour came.</p>
  <p>We  know its results&mdash;how far the scheme succeeded and whence its great failure  arose. Gwendolen fell asleep almost immediately on reaching the bungalow and  Miss Graham, dreaming no harm and having the most perfect confidence in Mrs.  Ocumpaugh, took advantage of the permission she had received, and slipped  outside to sit on the bench and listen to the music. Presently Mrs. Ocumpaugh  appeared, saying that she had left her guests for a moment just to take a look  at Gwendolen and see if all were well with her.</p>
  <p>As  she needed no attendance, Miss Graham might stay where she was. And Miss Graham  did, taking great pleasure in the music, which was the finest she had ever  heard. Meanwhile Mrs. Ocumpaugh entered the bungalow, and, untying the child&rsquo;s  shoes as she had frequently done before when she found her asleep, she lifted  her and carried her just as she was down the trap, the door of which she had  previously raised. The darkness lurking in such places, a darkness which had  rendered it so impenetrable at midnight, was relieved to some extent in  daylight by means of little grated openings in the wall under the beams, so  that her chief difficulty lay in holding up her long dress and sustaining the  heavy child at the same time. But the exigency of the moment and her  apprehension lest Miss Graham should re&euml;nter the bungalow before she could  finish her task and escape, gave great precision to her movements, and in an  incredibly short space of time she had reached those musty precincts which, if  they should not prove the death of the child, would safely shelter her from  every one&rsquo;s eye, till the first excitement of her loss was over, and the  conviction of her death by drowning became a settled fact in every mind.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s return was a flight. She had brought one of the little shoes with  her, concealed in a pocket she had made especially for it in the trimmings of  her elaborate gown. She found the bungalow empty, the trap still raised, and  Miss Graham, toward whom she cast a hurried look through the window, yet in her  place, listening with enthralled attention to the great tenor upon whose  magnificent singing Mrs. Ocumpaugh had relied for the successful carrying out  of what she and Mrs. Carew considered the most critical part of the plot. So  far then, all was well. She had but to drop the trap-door carefully to its  place, replace the corner of the carpet she had pulled up, push down with her  foot the two or three nails she had previously loosened, and she would be quite  at liberty to quit the place and return to her guests.</p>
  <p>But  she found that this was not as easy as she had imagined. The clogs of a  terrible, almost a criminal, consciousness held back her steps. She stumbled as  she left the bungalow and stopped to catch her breath as if the oppression of  the room in which she had immured her darling had infected the sunny air of  this glorious day and made free breathing an impossibility. The weights on her  feet were so palpable to her that she unconsciously looked down at them. This  was how she came to notice the dust on her shoes. Alive to the story it told,  she burst the spell which held her and made a bound toward the house.</p>
  <p>Rushing  to her room she shook her skirts and changed her shoes, and thus freed from all  connecting links with that secret spot, re&euml;ntered among her guests, as  beautiful and probably as wretched a woman as the world contained that day.</p>
  <p>Yet  not as wretched as she could be. There were depths beneath these depths. If he  should ever know! If he should ever come to look at her with horrified, even  alienated eyes! Ah, that were the end&mdash;that would mean the river for her&mdash;the  river which all were so soon to think had swallowed the little Gwendolen. Was  that Miss Graham coming? Was the stir she now heard outside, the first  indication of the hue and cry which would soon ring through the whole place and  her shrinking heart as well? No, no, not yet. She could still smile, must smile  and smite her two glove-covered hands together in simulated applause of notes  and tones she did not even hear. And no one noted anything strange in that  smile or in that gracious bringing together of hands, which if any one had had  the impulse to touch&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  no one thought of doing that. A heart may bleed drop by drop to its death in  our full sight without our suspecting it, if the eyes above it still beam with  natural brightness. And hers did that. She had always been called impassive.  God be thanked that no warmth was expected from her and that no one would  suspect the death she was dying, if she did not cry out. But the moment came  when she did cry out. Miss Graham entered, told her story, and all Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s pent-up agony burst its bounds in a scream which to others seemed  but the natural outburst of an alarmed mother. She fled to the bungalow,  because that seemed the natural thing to do, and never forgetting what was  expected of her, cried aloud in presence of its emptiness: &ldquo;The river! the  river!&rdquo; and went stumbling down the bank.</p>
  <p>The  shoe was near her hand and she drew it out as she went on. When they found her  she had fainted; the excess of excitement has this natural outcome. She did not  have to play a part, the humiliation of her own deed and the terrors yet to  come were eating up her very soul. Then came the blow, the unexpected,  overwhelming blow of finding that the deception planned with such care&mdash;a  deception upon the success of which the whole safety of the scheme depended&mdash;was  likely to fail just for the simple reason that a dozen men could swear that the  child had never crossed the track. She was dazed&mdash;confounded. Mrs. Carew was not  by to counsel her; she had her own part in this business to play; and Mrs.  Ocumpaugh, conscious of being mentally unfit for any new planning, conscious  indeed of not being able to think at all, simply followed her instinct and held  to the old cry in face of proof, of persuasion, of reason even; and so, did the  very wisest thing possible, no one expecting reason in a mother reeling under  such a vital shock.</p>
  <p>But  the cooler, more subtile and less guilty Mrs. Carew had some judgment left, if  her friend had lost hers. Her own part had been well played. She had brought  her nephew home without giving any one, not even the maid she had provided  herself with in New York, an opportunity to see his face; and she had passed  him over, dressed in quite different clothes, to the couple in the farm-wagon,  who had carried him, as she supposed, safely out of reach and any possibility  of discovery. You see her calculations failed here also. She did not credit the  doctor with even the little conscience he possessed, and, unconscious of his  near waiting on the highway in anxious watch for the event concerning which he  had his own secret doubts, she deluded herself into thinking that all they had  to fear was a continuation of the impression that Gwendolen had not gone down  to the river and been drowned.</p>
  <p>When,  therefore, she had acted out her little part&mdash;received the searching party and  gone with them all over the house even to the door of the room where she said  her little nephew was resting after his journey&mdash;(Did they look in? Perhaps, and  perhaps not, it mattered little, for the bed had been arranged against this  contingency and no one but a detective bent upon ferreting out crime would have  found it empty)&mdash;she asked herself how she could strengthen the situation and  cause the theory advanced by Mrs. Ocumpaugh to be received, notwithstanding the  evidence of seeming eye-witnesses. The result was the throwing of a second shoe  into the water as soon as it was dark enough for her to do this unseen. As she  had to approach the river by her own grounds, and as she was obliged to choose  a place sufficiently remote from the lights about the dock not to incur the  risk of being detected in her hazardous attempt, the shoe fell at a spot  farther down stream than the searchers had yet reached, and the intense  excitement I had myself seen in Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s face the day I made my first  visit to Homewood, sprang from the agony of suspense with which she watched,  after twenty-four hours of alternating expectation and disappointment, the  finding of this second shoe which, with fanatic confidence, she hoped would  bring all the confirmation to be desired of her oft-repeated declaration that  the child would yet be found in the river.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  to the infinite dismay of both, the matter had been placed in the hands of the  police and word sent to Mr. Ocumpaugh, not that the child was dead, but  missing. This meant world-wide publicity and the constant coming and going  about Homewood of the very men whose insight and surveillance were most to be  dreaded. Mrs. Ocumpaugh sank under the terrors thus accumulating upon her; but  Mrs. Carew, of different temperament and history, rose to meet them with a  courage which bade fair to carry everything before it.</p>
  <p>As  midnight approached (the hour agreed upon in their compact) she prepared to go  for Gwendolen. Mrs. Ocumpaugh, who had not forgotten what was expected of her  at that hour, roused as the clock struck twelve, and uttering a loud cry,  rushed from her place in the window down to the lawn, calling out that she had  heard the men shout aloud from the boats. Her plan was to draw every one who  chanced to be about, down to the river bank, in order to give Mrs. Carew full  opportunity to go and come unseen on her dangerous errand. And she apparently  succeeded in this, for by the time she had crept back in seeming disappointment  to the house, a light could be seen burning behind a pink shade in one of Mrs.  Carew&rsquo;s upper windows&mdash;the signal agreed upon between them of the presence of  Gwendolen in her new home.</p>
  <p>But  small was the relief as yet. The shoe had not been found, and at any moment  some intruder might force his way into Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s house and, in spite of all  her precautions, succeed in obtaining a view of the little Harry and recognize  in him the missing child.</p>
  <p>Of  these same precautions some mention must be made. The artful widow had begun by  dismissing all her help, giving as an excuse her speedy departure for Europe,  and the colored girl she had brought up from New York saw no difference in the  child running about the house in its little velvet suit from the one who, with  bound-up face and a heavy shade over his eyes, came up in the cars with her in  Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s lap. Her duties being limited to a far-off watch on the child to  see that it came to no harm, she was the best witness possible in case of  police intrusion or neighborhood gossip. As for Gwendolen herself, the novelty  of the experience and the prospect held out by a speedy departure to &ldquo;papa&rsquo;s  country&rdquo; kept her amused and even hilarious. She laughed when her hair was cut  short, darkened and parted. She missed but one thing, and that was her pet  plaything which she used to carry to bed with her at night. The lack of this  caused some tears&mdash;a grief which was divined by Mrs. Ocumpaugh, who took pains  to assuage it in the manner we all know.</p>
  <p>But  this was after the finding of the second shoe; the event so long anticipated  and so little productive. Somehow, neither Mrs. Carew nor Mrs. Ocumpaugh had  taken into consideration the fact of the child&rsquo;s shoes being rights and lefts,  and when this attempt to second the first deception was decided on, it was  thought a matter of congratulation that Gwendolen had been supplied with two  pairs of the same make and that one pair yet remained in her closet. The mate  of that shown by Mrs. Ocumpaugh was still on the child&rsquo;s foot in the bungalow,  but there being no difference in any of them, what was simpler than to take one  of these and fling it where it would be found. Alas! the one seized upon by  Mrs. Carew was for the same foot as that already shown and commented on, and  thus this second attempt failed even more completely than the first, and people  began to cry, &ldquo;A conspiracy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  a conspiracy it was, but one which might yet have succeeded if Doctor Pool&rsquo;s  suspicion of Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s intentions, and my own secret knowledge of Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s real position toward this child, could have been eliminated from  the situation. But with those two factors against them, detection had crept  upon them in unknown ways, and neither Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s frantic clinging to the  theory she had so recklessly advanced, nor Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s determined effort to  meet suspicion with the brave front calculated to disarm it, was of any avail.  The truth would have its way and their secret stood revealed.</p>
  <p>This  was the story told me by Mrs. Ocumpaugh; not in the continuous and detailed  manner I have here set down, but in disjointed sentences and wild bursts of  disordered speech. When it was finished she turned upon me eyes full of haggard  inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  fate is in your hands,&rdquo; she falteringly declared. &ldquo;What will you do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the hardest question which had ever been put me. For minutes I contemplated  her in a silence which must have been one prolonged agony to her. I did not see  my way; I did not see my duty. Then the fifty thousand dollars!</p>
  <p>At  last, I replied as follows:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Ocumpaugh, if you will let me advise you, as a man intensely interested in the  happiness of yourself and husband, I would suggest your meeting him at  quarantine and telling him the whole truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would rather die,&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  only by doing what I suggest can you find any peace in life. The consciousness  that others know your secret will come between you and any satisfaction you can  ever get out of your husband&rsquo;s continued confidence. A wrong has been done; you  are the only one to right it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not. I can die, but I can not do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  for a minute I thought she would die then and there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Pool is a fanatic; he will pursue you until he is assured that the child is in  good hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can assure him of that now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next  month his exactions may take another direction. You can never trust a man who  thinks he has a mission. Pardon my presumption. No mercenary motive prompts  what I am saying now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you intend to publish my story, if I do not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  hesitated again. Such questions can not be decided in a moment. Then, with a  certain consciousness of doing right, I answered earnestly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  no one but to Mr. Ocumpaugh do I feel called upon to disclose what really  concerns no one but yourself and him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hands rose toward me in a gesture which may have been an expression of  gratitude or only one of simple appeal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not due until Saturday,&rdquo; I added gently.</p>
  <p>No  answer from the cold lips. I do not think she could have spoken if she had  tried.</p>

    On The Second Terrace</b></h2>
  <p>My  first step on leaving Homewood was to seek a public telephone. Calling up  Doctor Pool in Yonkers, I assured him that he might rest easy as to the young patient  to whose doubtful condition he had called my attention. That she was in good  hands and was doing well. That I had seen her and would give him all necessary  particulars when I came to interview him later in the day. To his uneasy  questions I vouchsafed little reply. I was by no means sure of the advisability  of taking him into my full confidence. It was enough for him to know that his  demands had been complied with without injury to the child.</p>
  <p>Before  hanging up the receiver, I put him a question on my own behalf. How was the boy  in his charge? The growl he returned me was very non-committal, and afforded me  some food for thought as I turned back to Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s cottage, where I now  proposed to make a final visit.</p>
  <p>I  entered from the road. The heavily wooded grounds looked desolate. The copper  beeches which are the glory of the place seemed to have lost color since I last  saw them above the intervening hedges. Even the house, as it gradually emerged  to view through the close shrubbery, wore a different aspect from usual. In  another moment I saw why. Every shutter was closed and not a vestige of life  was visible above or below. Startled, for I had not expected quite so hasty a  departure on her part, I ran about to the side door where I had previously entered  and rang fit to wake the dead. Only solitary echoes came from within and I was  about to curse the time I had lost in telephoning to Doctor Pool, when I heard  a slight sound in the direction of the private path, and, leaping hastily to  the opening, caught the glimpse of something or somebody disappearing down the  first flight of steps.</p>
  <p>Did  I run? You may believe I did, at least till I had descended the first terrace;  then my steps grew gradually wary and finally ceased; for I could hear voices  ahead of me on the second terrace to which I had now come, and these voices  came from persons standing still. If I rushed on I should encounter these  persons, and this was undesirable. I accordingly paused just short of the top,  and so heard what raised the moment into one of tragic importance.</p>
  <p>One  of the speakers was Mrs. Carew&mdash;there was no doubting this&mdash;the other was Mr.  Rathbone. From no other lips than his could I hope to hear words uttered with  such intensity, though he was guarded in his speech, or thought he was, which  is not always the same thing.</p>
  <p>He  was pleading with her, and my heart stood still with the sense of threatening  catastrophe as I realized the attitude of the pair. He, as every word showed,  was still ignorant of Gwendolen&rsquo;s fate, consequently of the identity of the  child who I had every reason to believe was at that very moment fluttering a  few steps below in the care of the colored maid, whose voice I could faintly  hear; she, with his passion to meet and quell, had this secret to maintain;  hearing his wild entreaties with one ear and listening for the possible  outbursts of the not-to-be-restrained child with the other; mad to go&mdash;to catch  her train before discovery overwhelmed her, yet not daring to hasten him, for  his mood was a man&rsquo;s mood and not to be denied. I felt sorry for her, and cast  about in my mind what aid to give the situation, when the passion of his words  seized me, and I forgot her position in the interest I began to feel in his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Valerie,  Valerie,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;this is cruelty. You go with no good cause that I can  see&mdash;put the sea between us, and yet say no word to make the parting endurable.  You understand what I suffer&mdash;my hateful thoughts, my dread, which is not so  much dread as&mdash;Oh, that I should say it! Oh, that I should feel it!&mdash;hope;  guilty, unpardonable hope. Yet you refuse me the little word, the kindly look,  which would alleviate the oppression of my feelings and give me the thought of  you to counteract this eternal brooding upon Gwendolen and her possible fate. I  want a promise&mdash;conditional, O God! but yet a promise; and you simply bid me to  have patience; to wait&mdash;as if a man could wait who sees his love, his life, his  future trembling in the balance against the fate of a little child. If you  loved me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  The feeling in that word was not for him. I felt it at once; it was for her  secret, threatened every instant she lingered there by some move, by some word  which might escape a thoughtless child. &ldquo;You do not understand me, Justin. You  talk with no comprehension of myself or of the event. Six months from now, if  all goes well, you will see that I have been kind, not cruel. I can not say any  more; I should not have said so much. Go back, dear friend, and let me take the  train with Harry. The sea is not impassable. We shall meet again, and then&mdash;&rdquo;  Did she pause to look behind her down those steps&mdash;to make some gesture of  caution to the uneasy child?&mdash;&ldquo;you will forgive me for what seems cruelty to you  now. I can not do differently. With all the world weeping over the doubtful  fate of this little child, you can not expect me to&mdash;to make any promise  conditional upon her <i>death</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man&rsquo;s cry drove the irony of the situation out of my mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Puerilities!  all puerilities. A man&rsquo;s life&mdash;soul&mdash;are worth some sacrifices. If you loved me&mdash;&rdquo;  A quick ingathering of his breath, then a low moan, then the irrepressible cry  she vainly sought to hush, &ldquo;O Valerie, you are silent! You do not love me! Two  years of suffering! two years of repression, then this delirium of hope, of  possibility, and you <i>silent</i>! I will trouble you no more. Gwendolen alive  or Gwendolen dead, what is it to me! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  there is no doubt on that topic; the child is <i>dead</i>. Let that be  understood between us.&rdquo; This was whispered, and whispered very low, but the air  seemed breathless at that moment and I heard her. &ldquo;This is my last word to you.  You will have your fortune, whether you have my love or not. Remember that,  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Auntie,  make Dinah move away; I want to see the man you are talking to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gwendolen  had spoken.</p>

    A Coral Bead</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Mr. Rathbone who first found voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  what a state have I come when in every woman&rsquo;s face, even in hers who is  dearest, I see expressions I no longer understand, and in every child&rsquo;s voice  catch the sound of Gwendolen&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s  voice is not like Gwendolen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; came in desperate protest from the ready widow.  A daring assertion for her to make to him who had often held this child in his  arms for hours together. &ldquo;You are not yourself, Justin. I am sorry. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;  Almost she gave her promise, almost she risked her future, possibly his, by  saying, under the stress of her fears, what her heart did not prompt her to,  when&mdash;</p>
  <p>A  quick move on her part, a low cry on his, and he came rushing up the steps.</p>
  <p>I  had advanced at her hesitating words and shown myself.</p>
  <p>When  Mr. Rathbone was well up the terrace (he hardly honored me with a look as he  went by), I slowly began my descent to where she stood with her back toward me  and her arms thrown round the child she had evidently called to her in her  anxiety to conceal the little beaming face from this new intruder.</p>
  <p>That  she had not looked as high as my face I felt assured; that she would not show  me hers unless I forced her to seemed equally certain. Every step I took  downward was consequently of moment to me. I wondered how I should come out of  this; what she would do; what I myself should say. The bold course commended  itself to me. No more circumlocution; no more doubtful playing of the game with  this woman. I would take the bull by the horns and&mdash;</p>
  <p>I  had reached the step on which she crouched. I could catch sight of the child&rsquo;s  eyes over her shoulder, a shoulder that quivered&mdash;was it with the storm of the  last interview, or with her fear of this? I would see.</p>
  <p>Pausing,  I said to her with every appearance of respect, but in my most matter-of-fact  tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Carew, may I request you to send Gwendolen down to the girl I see below there?  I have something to say to you before you leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Gwendolen!</i> </p>
  <p>With  a start which showed how completely she was taken by surprise, Mrs. Carew rose.  She may have recognized my voice and she may not; it is hard to decide in such  an actress. Whether she did or not, she turned with a frown, which gave way to  a ravishing smile as her eyes met my face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;  she said, and without any betrayal in voice or gesture that she recognized that  her hopes, and those of the friend to whose safety she had already sacrificed  so much, had just received their death-blow, she gave a quick order to the girl  who, taking the child by the hand, sat down on the steps Mrs. Carew now quitted  and laid herself out to be amusing.</p>
  <p>Gravely  Mrs. Carew confronted me on the terrace below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo;  said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just come from Mrs. Ocumpaugh,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
  <p>The  veiled head dropped a trifle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  could not sustain herself! So all is lost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends. But I must request you not to leave the country till Mr. Ocumpaugh  returns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  flash of her eye startled me. &ldquo;Who can detain me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if I wish to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did not answer in kind. I had no wish to rouse this woman&rsquo;s opposition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think you will want to go when you remember Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s condition.  Would you leave her to bear the full burden of this deception alone? She is a  broken woman. Her full story is known to me. I have the profoundest sympathy  for her. She has only three days in which to decide upon her course. I have  advised her to tell the whole truth to her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  word was but a breath, but I heard it. Yet I felt no resentment against this  woman. No one could, under the spell of so much spirit and grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I not advise her right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  but you must not detain <i>me</i>. You must do nothing to separate me from this  child. I will not bear it. I have experienced for days now what motherhood  might be, and nothing on earth shall rob me of my present rights in this child.&rdquo;  Then as she met my unmoved countenance: &ldquo;If you know Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s whole  history, you know that neither she nor her husband has any real claim on the  child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that you are mistaken,&rdquo; I quickly protested. &ldquo;Six years of care and affection  such as they have bestowed on Gwendolen, to say nothing of the substantial form  which these have taken from the first, constitute a claim which all the world  must recognize, if you do not. Think of Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s belief in her relation  to him! Think of the shock which awaits him, when he learns that she is not of  his blood and lineage!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, I know.&rdquo; Her fingers worked nervously; the woman was showing through the  actress. &ldquo;But I will not give up the child. Ask anything but that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,  I have had the honor so far to make but one requirement&mdash;that you do not carry  the child out of the country&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  I uttered this ultimatum, some influence, acting equally upon both, caused us  to turn in the direction of the river; possibly an apprehension lest some word  of this conversation might be overheard by the child or the nurse. A surprise  awaited us which effectually prevented Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s reply. In the corner of the  Ocumpaugh grounds stood a man staring with all his eyes at the so-called little  Harry. An expression of doubt was on his face. I knew the minute to be critical  and was determined to make the most of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know that man?&rdquo; I whispered to Mrs. Carew.</p>
  <p>The  answer was brief but suggestive of alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  one of the gardeners over there&mdash;one of whom Gwendolen is especially fond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  the one to fear, then. Engage his attention while I divert hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  this in a whisper while the man was summoning up courage to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  pretty child,&rdquo; he stammered, as Mrs. Carew advanced toward him smiling. &ldquo;Is  that your little nephew I&rsquo;ve heard them tell about? Seems to me he looks like  our own little lost one; only darker and sturdier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  sturdier,&rdquo; I heard her say as I made haste to accost the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo;  I cried, recalling my old address when I was in training for a gentleman; &ldquo;your  aunt is in a hurry. The cars are coming; don&rsquo;t you hear the whistle? Will you  trust yourself to me? Let me carry you&mdash;I mean, pick-a-back, while we run for  the train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sweet eyes looked up&mdash;it was fortunate for Mrs. Carew that no one but myself had  ever got near enough to see those eyes or she could hardly have kept her  secret&mdash;and at first slowly, then with instinctive trust, the little arms rose  and I caught her to my breast, taking care as I did so to turn her quite away  from the man whom Mrs. Carew was about leaving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;  I shouted back, &ldquo;we shall be late!&rdquo;&mdash;and made a dash for the gate.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew joined me, and none of us said anything till we reached the station  platform. Then as I set the child down, I gave her one look. She was beaming  with gratitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  saved us, together with the few words I could edge in between his loud regrets  at my going and his exclamations of grief over Gwendolen&rsquo;s loss. On the train I  shall fear nothing. If you will lift him up I will wrap him in this shawl as if  he were ill. Once in New York&mdash;are you not going to permit me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  go to New York, yes; but not to the steamer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  showed anger, but also an admirable self-control. Far off we could catch the sounding  thrill of the approaching train.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  yield,&rdquo; she announced suddenly. And opening the bag at her side, she fumbled in  it for a card which she presently put in my hand. &ldquo;I was going there for lunch,&rdquo;  she explained. &ldquo;Now I will take a room and remain until I hear from you.&rdquo; Here  she gave me a quick look. &ldquo;You do not appear satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes,&rdquo; I stammered, as I looked at the card and saw her name over that of an  inconspicuous hotel in the down-town portion of New York City. &ldquo;I merely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  nearing of the train gave me the opportunity of cutting short the sentence I  should have found it difficult to finish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is the child,&rdquo; I exclaimed, lifting the little one, whom she immediately  enveloped in the light but ample wrap she had chosen as a disguise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by&mdash;Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by!  I like you. Your arms are strong and you don&rsquo;t shake me when you run.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Carew smiled. There was deep emotion in her face. &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo; she  murmured in a tone implying promise. Happily I understood the French phrase.</p>
  <p>I  bowed and drew back. Was I wrong in letting her slip from my surveillance? The  agitation I probably showed must have caused her some thought. But she would  have been more than a diviner of mysteries to have understood its cause. Her  bag, when she had opened it before my eyes, had revealed among its contents a  string of remarkable corals. A bead similar in shape, color and marking rested  at that very moment over my own heart. Was that necklace one bead short? With a  start of conviction I began to believe so and that I was the man who could  complete it. If that was so&mdash;why, then&mdash;then&mdash;</p>
  <p>It  isn&rsquo;t often that a detective&rsquo;s brain reels&mdash;but mine did then.</p>
  <p>The  train began to move&mdash;</p>
  <p>This  discovery, the greatest of all, if I were right, would&mdash;</p>
  <p>I  had no more time to think.</p>
  <p>Instinctively,  with a quick jump, I made my place good on the rear car.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  &ldquo;Shall I Give Him My Word, Harry?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>I  did not go all the way to New York on the train which Mrs. Carew and the child  had taken. I went only as far as Yonkers.</p>
  <p>When  I reached Doctor Pool&rsquo;s house, I thought it entirely empty. Even the office  seemed closed. But appearances here could not always be trusted, and I rang the  bell with a vigor which must have awakened echoes in the uninhabited upper  stories. I know that it brought the doctor to the door, and in a state of  doubtful amiability. But when he saw who awaited him, his appearance changed  and he welcomed me in with a smile or what was as nearly like one as his  austere nature would permit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  now! Want your money? Seems to me you have earned it with unexpected ease.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  such great ease,&rdquo; I replied, as he carefully closed the door and locked it &ldquo;I  know that I feel as tired as I ever did in my life. The child is in New York  under the guardianship of a woman who is really fond of her. You can dismiss  all care concerning her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see&mdash;and who is the woman? Name her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not trust me, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust no one in business matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is not a business matter&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not asked for money. I am not going to till I can perfectly satisfy you  that all deception is at an end so far as Mr. Ocumpaugh at least is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you would play fair, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was too interested in noting how each of his hands involuntarily closed on  itself, in his relief at not being called upon to part with some of his  hoardings, to answer with aught but a nod.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have your reasons for keeping close, of course,&rdquo; he growled as he led the way  toward the basement stairs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not out of the woods, is that it? Or has  the great lady bargained with you?&mdash;Um? Um?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  threw the latter ejaculations back over his shoulder as he descended to the  office. They displeased me, and I made no attempt to reply. In fact, I had no  reply ready. Had I bargained with Mrs. Ocumpaugh? Hardly. Yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is handsome enough,&rdquo; the old man broke in sharply, cutting in two my  self-communings. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fellow of some stamina, if you have got at her  secret without making her a promise. So the child is well! That&rsquo;s good! There&rsquo;s  one long black mark eliminated from my account. But I have not closed the book,  and I am not going to, till my conscience has nothing more to regret. It is not  enough that the child is handed over to a different life; the fortunes that  have been bequeathed her must be given to him who would have inherited them had  this child not been taken for a veritable Ocumpaugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  raises a nice point,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  one that will drag all false things to light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  action in the matter along with the rest,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  but do you think I shall stop because of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not look as if he would stop because of anything.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you not think Mrs. Ocumpaugh worthy some pity? Her future is a ghastly one,  whichever way you look at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  sinned,&rdquo; was his uncompromising reply. &ldquo;The wages of sin is death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  such death!&rdquo; I protested; &ldquo;death of the heart, which is the worst death of all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  shrugged his shoulders, leading the way into the office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  her beware!&rdquo; he went on surlily. &ldquo;Last month I saw my duty no further than the  exaction of this child&rsquo;s dismissal from the home whose benefits she enjoyed  under a false name. To-day I am led further by the inexorable guide which  prompts the anxious soul. All that was wrong must be made good. Mr. Ocumpaugh  must know on whom his affections have been lavished. I will not yield. The  woman has done wrong; and she shall suffer for it till she rises, a redeemed  soul, into a state of mind that prefers humiliation to a continuance in a life  of deception. You may tell her what I say&mdash;that is, if you enjoy the right of  conversation with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  look he shot me at this was keen as hate and spite could make it. I was glad  that we were by this time in the office, and that I could avoid his eye by a  quick look about the well-remembered place. This proof of the vindictive  pursuit he had marked out for himself was no surprise to me. I expected no  less, yet it opened up difficulties which made my way, as well as hers, look  dreary in the prospect. He perceived my despondency and smiled; then suddenly  changed his tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not ask after the little patient I have here. Come, Harry, come; here is  some one I will let you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  door of my old room swung open and I do not know which surprised me most, the  kindness in the rugged old voice I had never before heard lifted in tenderness,  or the look of confidence and joy on the face of the little boy who now came  running in. So inexorable to a remorseful and suffering woman, and so full of  consideration for a stranger&rsquo;s child!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost  well,&rdquo; pronounced the doctor, and lifted him on his knee. &ldquo;Do you know this  child&rsquo;s parentage and condition?&rdquo; he sharply inquired, with a quick look toward  me.</p>
  <p>I  saw no reason for not telling the truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is an orphan, and was destined for an institution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Positively.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I shall keep the child. Harry, will you stay with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  my amazement the little arms crept round his neck. A smile grim enough, in my  estimation, but not at all frightful to the child, responded to this appeal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not like the old man and woman,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Pool&rsquo;s whole manner showed triumph. &ldquo;I shall treat him better than I did you,&rdquo;  he remarked. &ldquo;I am a regenerate man now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  bowed; I was very uneasy; there was a question I wanted to ask and could not in  the presence of this child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is hardly of an age to take my place,&rdquo; I observed, still under the spell of my  surprise, for the child was handling the old man&rsquo;s long beard, and seeming  almost as happy as Gwendolen did in Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will have one of his own,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s unexpected reply.</p>
  <p>I  rose. I saw that he did not intend to dismiss the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like your word, in return for the relief I have undoubtedly brought you,  that you will not molest certain parties till the three days are up which I  have mentioned as the limit of my own silence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I give him my word, Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  child, startled by the abrupt address, drew his fingers from the long beard he  was playfully stroking and, eyeing me with elfish gravity, seemed to ponder the  question as if some comprehension of its importance had found entrance into his  small brain. Annoyed at the doctor&rsquo;s whim, yet trusting to the child&rsquo;s  intuition, I waited with inner anxiety for what those small lips would say, and  felt an infinite relief, even if I did not show it, when he finally uttered a  faint &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and hid his face again on the doctor&rsquo;s breast.</p>
  <p>My  last remembrance of them both was the picture they made as the doctor closed  the door upon me, with the sweet, confiding child still clasped in his arms.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
    The Work Of An Instant</b></h2>
  <p>I  did not take the car at the corner. I was sure that Jupp was somewhere around,  and I had a new mission for him of more importance than any he could find here  now. I was just looking about for him when I heard cries and screams at my back,  and, turning, saw several persons all running one way. As that way was the one  by which I had just come, I commenced running too, and in another moment was  one of a crowd collected before the doctor&rsquo;s door. I mean the great front door  which, to my astonishment, I had already seen was wide open. The sight which  there met my eyes almost paralyzed me.</p>
  <p>Stretched  on the pavement, spotted with blood, lay the two figures I had seen within the  last five minutes beaming with life and energy. The old man was dead, the child  dying, one little hand outstretched as if in search of the sympathetic touch  which had made the last few hours perhaps the sweetest of his life. How had it  happened? Was it suicide on the doctor&rsquo;s part or just pure accident? Either way  it was horrible, but&mdash;I looked about me; there was a man ready to give  explanations. He had seen it all. The doctor had been racing with the child in  the long hall. He had opened the door, probably for air. A sudden dash of the  child had brought him to the verge, the doctor had plunged to save him, and  losing his balance toppled headlong to the street, carrying the child with him.</p>
  <p>It  was all the work of an instant.</p>
  <p>One  moment two vigorous figures&mdash;the next, a mass of crushed humanity!</p>
  <p>A  sight to stagger a man&rsquo;s soul! But the thought which came with it staggered me  still more.</p>
  <p>The  force which had been driving Mrs. Ocumpaugh to her fate was removed. Henceforth  her secret was safe if&mdash;if I chose to have it so.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  &ldquo;He Will Never Forgive&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>I  was walking away when a man touched me. Some one had seen me come from the  doctor&rsquo;s office a few minutes before. Of course this meant detention till the  coroner should arrive. I quarreled with the circumstances but felt forced to  submit. Happily Jupp now came to the front and I was able to send him to New  York to keep that watch over Mrs. Carew, without which I could not have rested  quiet an hour. One great element of danger was removed most remarkably, if not  providentially, from the path I had marked out for myself; but there still  remained that of this woman&rsquo;s possible impulses under her great determination  to keep Gwendolen in her own care. But with Jupp to watch the dock, and a man  in plain clothes at the door of the small hotel she was at present bound for, I  thought I might remain in Yonkers contentedly the whole day.</p>
  <p>It  was not, however, till late the next afternoon that I found myself again in  Homewood. I had heard from Jupp. The steamer had sailed, but without two  passengers who had been booked for the voyage. Mrs. Carew and the child were  still at the address she had given me. All looked well in that direction; but  what was the aspect of affairs in Homewood? I trembled in some anticipation of  what these many hours of bitter thought might have effected in Mrs. Ocumpaugh.  Evidently nothing to lessen the gloom into which the whole household had now  fallen. Miss Porter, who came in haste to greet me, wore the careworn look of a  long and unrelieved vigil. I was not astonished when she told me that she had  not slept a wink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could I,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;when Mrs. Ocumpaugh did not close her eyes? She did not  even lie down, but sat all night in an arm-chair which she had wheeled into  Gwendolen&rsquo;s room, staring like one who sees nothing out into the night through  the window which overlooks the river. This morning we can not make her speak.  Her eyes are dry with fever; only now and then she utters a little moan. The  doctor says she will not live to see her husband, unless something comes to  rouse her. But the papers give no news, and all the attempts of the police end  in nothing. You saw what a dismal failure their last attempt was. The child on  which they counted proved to be both red-haired and pock-marked. Gwendolen  appears to be lost, lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  spite of the despair thus expressed my way seemed to open a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I can break Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s dangerous apathy if you will let me see her  again. Will you let me try?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  nurse&mdash;we have a nurse now&mdash;will not consent, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  telephone to the doctor. Tell him I am the only man who can do anything for  Mrs. Ocumpaugh. This will not be an exaggeration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  I will get his order. I do not know why I have so much confidence in you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  another fifteen minutes she came to lead me to Mrs. Ocumpaugh.</p>
  <p>I  entered without knocking; they told me to. She was seated, as they said, in a  large chair, but with no ease to herself; for she was not even leaning against  its back, but sat with body strained forward and eyes fixed on the ripple of  the great river where, from what she had intimated to me in our last interview,  she probably saw her grave. There was a miniature in her hand, but I saw at  first glance that it was not the face of Gwendolen over which her fingers  closed so spasmodically. It was her husband&rsquo;s portrait which she held, and it  was his face, aroused and full of denunciation, which she evidently saw in her  fancy as I drew nearer her in my efforts to attract her attention; for a shiver  suddenly contracted her lovely features and she threw her arms out as if to  ward from herself something which she had no power to meet. In doing this her  head turned slightly and she saw me.</p>
  <p>Instantly  the spell under which she sat frozen yielded to a recognition of something  besides her own terrible brooding. She let her arms drop, and the lips which  had not spoken that morning moved slightly. I waited respectfully. I saw that  in another moment she would speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have come,&rdquo; she panted out at last, &ldquo;to hear my decision. It is too soon. The  steamer has twenty-four hours yet before it can make port. I have not finished  weighing my life against the good opinion of him I live for.&rdquo; Then faintly&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs.  Carew has gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  New York,&rdquo; I finished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  farther than that?&rdquo; she asked anxiously. &ldquo;She has not sailed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not see how it was compatible with my duty to let her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s whole form collapsed; the dangerous apathy was creeping over her  again. &ldquo;You are deciding for me,&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke very faintly&mdash;&ldquo;you and Doctor Pool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Should  I tell her that Doctor Pool was dead? No, not yet. I wanted her to choose the  noble course for Mr. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s sake&mdash;yes, and for her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I ventured to rejoin. &ldquo;You are the only one who can settle your own fate. The  word must come from you. I am only trying to make it possible for you to meet  your husband without any additional wrong to blunt his possible forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he will never forgive&mdash;and I have lost all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  the set look returned in its full force.</p>
  <p>I  made my final attempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Ocumpaugh, we may never have another moment together in confidence. There is  one thing I have never told you, something which I think you ought to know, as  it may affect your whole future course. It concerns Gwendolen&rsquo;s real mother.  You say you do not know her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; do not bring up that. I do not want to know her. My darling is happy with  Mrs. Carew&mdash;too happy. O God! Give me no opportunity for disturbing that  contentment. Don&rsquo;t you see that I am consumed with jealousy? That I might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was roused enough now, cheek and lip and brow were red; even her eyes looked  blood-shot. Alarmed, I put out my hand in a soothing gesture, and when her  voice stopped and her words trailed off into an inarticulate murmur I made  haste to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen  to my little story. It will not add to your pain, rather alleviate it. When I  hid behind the curtain on that day we all regret, I did not slip from my post  at your departure. I knew that another patient awaited the doctor&rsquo;s convenience  in my own small room, where he had hastily seated her when your carriage drove  up. I also knew that this patient had overheard what you said as well as I, for  impervious as the door looked I had often heard the doctor&rsquo;s mutterings when he  thought I was safe beyond ear-shot, if not asleep. And I wanted to see how she  would act when she rejoined the doctor; for I had heard a little of what she  had said before, and was quite aware that she could help you out of your  difficulty if she wished. She was a married woman, or rather had been, but she  had no use for a child, being very poor and anxious to earn her own living.  Would she embrace this opportunity to part with it when it came? You may  imagine my interest, boy though I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did she? Was she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She was ready to make her compact with the doctor just as you had done. Before  she left everything was arranged for. It was her child you  took&mdash;reared&mdash;loved&mdash;and have now lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  another time she might have resented these words, especially the last; but I  had roused her curiosity, her panting eager curiosity, and she let them pass  altogether unchallenged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see this woman? Was she of common blood, common manners? It does not seem  possible&mdash;Gwendolen is by nature so dainty in all her ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  woman was a lady. I did not see her face, it was heavily veiled, but I heard  her voice; it was a lady&rsquo;s voice and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  wore beautiful jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jewels?  You said she was poor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  she declared herself, but she had on her neck under her coat a string of beads  which were both valuable and of exquisite workmanship. I know, because it broke  just as she was leaving, and the beads fell all over the floor, and one rolled  my way and I picked it up, scamp that I was, when both their backs were turned  in their search for the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  bead&mdash;a costly bead&mdash;and you were not found out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mrs. Ocumpaugh, she never seemed to miss it. She was too excited over what she  had just done to count correctly. She thought she had them all. But this has  been in my pocket for six years. Perhaps you have seen its like; I never have,  in jeweler&rsquo;s shop or elsewhere, till yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday?&rdquo;  Her great eyes, haggard with suffering, rose to mine, then they fell on the  bead which I had taken from my pocket. The cry she gave was not loud, but it  effectually settled all my doubts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you know of Mrs. Carew before she came to &mdash;?&rdquo; I asked impressively.</p>
  <p>For  minutes she did not answer; she was trembling like a leaf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  mother!&rdquo; she exclaimed at last. &ldquo;Her mother! her own mother! And she never  hinted it to me by word or look. Oh, Valerie, Valerie, what tortures we have  both suffered! and now you are happy while I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grief  seemed to engulf her. Feeling my position keenly, I walked to the window, but  soon turned and came back in response to her cry: &ldquo;I must see Mrs. Carew  instantly. Give my orders. I will start at once to New York. They will think I  have gone to be on hand to meet Mr. Ocumpaugh, and will say that I have not the  strength. Override their objections. I put my whole cause in your hands. You  will go with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  pleasure, madam.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  thus was that terrifying apathy broken up, to be succeeded by a spell of  equally terrifying energy.</p>

    The Final Struggle</b></h2>
  <p>She,  however, did not get off that night. I dared not push the matter to the point  of awakening suspicion, and when the doctor said that the ship was not due for  twenty hours and that it would be madness for her to start without a night&rsquo;s  rest and two or three good meals, I succumbed and she also to the few hours&rsquo;  delay. More than that, she consented to retire, and when I joined her in her  carriage the following morning, it was to find her physically stronger, even if  the mind was still a prey to deepest anguish and a torturing indecision. Her  nurse accompanied us and the maid called Celia, so conversation was  impossible&mdash;a fact I did not know whether to be thankful for or not. On the cars  she was shielded as much as possible from every one&rsquo;s gaze, and when we reached  New York we were driven at once to the Plaza. As I noticed the respect and  intense sympathy with which her presence was met by those who saw nothing in  her broken aspect but a mother&rsquo;s immeasurable grief, I wondered at the secrets  which lie deep down in the hearts of humanity, and what the effect would be if  I should suddenly shout aloud:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is more wretched than you think. Her suspense is one that the child&rsquo;s return  would not appease. Dig deeper into mortal fear and woe if you would know what  has changed this beautiful woman into a shadow in five days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  I myself did not know her mind. I could neither foresee what she contemplated  nor what the effect of seeing the child again would have upon her. I only knew  that she must never for a moment be out of sight of some one who loved her. I  myself never left the hall upon which her room opened, a precaution for which I  felt grateful when, late in the evening, she opened the door and, seeing me,  stepped out fully dressed for the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  and tell Sister Angelina that I may be trusted with you,&rdquo; she said. Sister  Angelina was the nurse.</p>
  <p>Of  course I did as she bade me, and after some few more difficulties I succeeded  in getting her into a carriage without attracting any special attention. Once  there she breathed more easily, and so did I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  take me to <i>her</i>,&rdquo; she said. Whether she meant Mrs. Carew or Gwendolen, I  never knew.</p>
  <p>I  now saw that the hour had come for telling her that she no longer need have any  fear of Doctor Pool. Whatever she contemplated must be done with a true  knowledge of where she stood and to just what extent her secret remained  endangered. I do not know if she felt grateful. I almost think that for the  first few minutes she felt rather frightened than relieved to find herself free  to act as her wishes and the preservation of her place in her husband&rsquo;s heart  and the world&rsquo;s regard impelled her. For she never for a moment seemed to  doubt, that now the doctor was gone I would yield to her misery and prove  myself the friend she had begged me to be from the first. She turned herself  toward me and sought to read my face, but it was rather to find out what I  expected of her than what she had yet to fear from me. I noted this and  muttered some words of confidence; but her mood had already changed, and they  fell on deaf ears.</p>
  <p>I  was not present at the meeting of the two women. That is, I remained in what  they would call a private parlor, while Mrs. Ocumpaugh passed into the inner  room, where she knew she would find Mrs. Carew and the child. Nor did I hear  much. Some words came through the partition. I caught most of Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s  explanation of how she came to give up her new-born child. She was an actress  at the time with a London success to her credit, but with no hold as yet in  this country. She was booked for a tour the coming season; the husband who  might have seen to the child was dead; she had no friends, no relatives here  save a brother poorer than herself, and the mother instinct had not awakened.  She bartered her child away as she would have parted with any other encumbrance  likely to interfere with her career. But&mdash;here her voice rose and I heard  distinctly: &ldquo;A fortune was suddenly left me. An old admirer dying abroad bequeathed  me two million dollars, and I found myself rich, admired and independent, with  no one on earth to care for or to share the happiness of what seemed to me,  after the brilliant life I had hitherto led, a dreary inaction. Love had no  interest for me. I had had a husband, and that part of my nature had been  satisfied. What I wanted now&mdash;and the wish presently grew into a passion&mdash;was my  child. From passion it grew to mania. Knowing the name of her to whom I had  yielded it (I had overheard it in the doctor&rsquo;s office), I hunted up your  residence and came one day to Homewood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  some old servant can be found there to-day who could tell you of the strange,  deeply veiled lady who was found one evening at sunset, clinging to the gate  with both hands and sobbing as she looked in at the triumphant little heiress  racing up and down the walks with the great mastiff, Don. They will say that it  was some poor crazy woman, or some mother who had buried her own little  darling; but it was I, Marion, it was I, looking upon the child I had sold for  a half-year&rsquo;s independence; I who was broken-hearted now for her smiles and  touches and saw them all given to strangers, who had made her a princess, but  who could never give her such love as I felt for her then in my madness. I went  away that time, but I came again soon with the titles of the adjoining property  in my pocket. I could not keep away from the sight of her, and felt that the  torture would be less to see her in your arms than not to see her at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer was not audible, but I could well imagine what it was. As every one  knew, the false mother had not long held out against the attractions of the  true one. Instinct had drawn the little one to the heart that beat responsive  to its own.</p>
  <p>What  followed I could best judge from the frightened cry which the child suddenly  gave. She had evidently waked to find both women at her bedside. Mrs. Carew&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hush!  hush!&rdquo; did not answer this time; the child was in a frenzy, and evidently  turned from one to the other, sobbing out alternately, &ldquo;I will not be a girl  again. I like my horse and going to papa and sailing on the big ocean, in  trousers and a little cap,&rdquo; and the softer phrases she evidently felt better  suited to Mrs. Ocumpaugh&rsquo;s deep distress: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel bad, mamma, you shall  come see me some time. Papa will send for you. I am going to him.&rdquo; Then  silence, then such a struggle of woman-heart with woman-heart as I hope never  to be witness to again. Mrs. Ocumpaugh was pleading with Mrs. Carew, not for  the child, but for her life. Mr. Ocumpaugh would be in port the next morning;  if she could show him the child all would be well. Mr. Trevitt would manage the  details; take the credit of having found Gwendolen somewhere in this great  city, and that would insure him the reward and them his silence. (I heard  this.) There was no one else to fear. Doctor Pool, the cause of all this  misery, was dead; and in the future, her heart being set to rest about her  secret, she would be happier and make the child happier, and they could enjoy  her between them, and she would be unselfish and let Gwendolen spend an hour or  more every day with Mrs. Carew, on some such plea as lessons in vocal-training  and music.</p>
  <p>Thus  pleaded Mrs. Ocumpaugh.</p>
  <p>But  the mother hardly listened. She had eaten with the child, slept with the child  and almost breathed with the child for three days now, and the ecstasy of the  experience had blinded her to any other claim than her own. She pitied Mrs.  Ocumpaugh, pitied most of all her deceived husband, but no grief of theirs could  equal that of Rachel crying for her child. Let Mrs. Ocumpaugh remember that  when the evil days come. She had separated child from mother! child from  mother! Oh, how the wail swept through those two rooms!</p>
  <p>I  dared not prophesy to myself at this point how this would end. I simply waited.</p>
  <p>Their  voices had sunk after each passionate outbreak, and I was only able to catch  now and then a word which told me that the struggle was yet going on.</p>
  <p>But  finally there came a lull, and while I wondered, the door flew suddenly open  and I saw Mrs. Ocumpaugh standing on the threshold, pallid and stricken,  looking back at the picture made by the other two as Mrs. Carew, fallen on her  knees by the bedside, held to her breast the panting child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not go against nature,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Keep Gwendolen, and may God have pity  upon me and Philo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stepped forward. Meeting my eye, she faltered this last word:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  advice was good. To-morrow when I meet my husband I will tell him who found the  child and why that child is not at my side to greet him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>That  night I had a vision. I saw a door&mdash;shut, ominous. Before that door stood a  woman, tall, pale, beautiful. She was there to enter, but to what no mortal  living could say. She saw nothing but loss and the hollowness of a living death  behind that closed door.</p>
  <p>But  who knows? Angels spring up unknown on the darkest road, and perhaps&mdash;</p>
  <p>Here  the vision broke; the day and its possibilities lay before me.</p>
