  <br>
  SUMMER LIGHTNING</h2>

  <p class="first">It was Mr. Ricardo's habit as soon as the second week of
  August came round to travel to Aix-les-Bains, in Savoy, where for five or six
  weeks he lived pleasantly. He pretended to take the waters in the morning, he
  went for a ride in his motor-car in the afternoon, he dined at the Cercle in
  the evening, and spent an hour or two afterwards in the baccarat-rooms at the
  Villa des Fleurs. An enviable, smooth life without a doubt, and it is certain
  that his acquaintances envied him. At the same time, however, they laughed at
  him and, alas with some justice; for he was an exaggerated person. He was to
  be construed in the comparative. Everything in his life was a trifle
  overdone, from the fastidious arrangement of his neckties to the feminine
  nicety of his little dinner-parties. In age Mr. Ricardo was approaching the
  fifties; in condition he was a widower &mdash; a state greatly to his liking,
  for he avoided at once the irksomeness of marriage and the reproaches justly
  levelled at the bachelor; finally, he was rich, having amassed a fortune in
  Mincing Lane, which he had invested in profitable securities.</p>

  <p>Ten years of ease, however, had not altogether obliterated in him the
  business look. Though he lounged from January to December, he lounged with
  the air of a financier taking a holiday; and when he visited, as he
  frequently did, the studio of a painter, a stranger would have hesitated to
  decide whether he had been drawn thither by a love of art or by the
  possibility of an investment. His "acquaintances" have been mentioned, and
  the word is suitable. For while he mingled in many circles, he stood aloof
  from all. He affected the company of artists, by whom he was regarded as one
  ambitious to become a connoisseur; and amongst the younger business men, who
  had never dealt with him, he earned the disrespect reserved for the
  dilettante. If he had a grief, it was that he had discovered no great man who
  in return for practical favours would engrave his memory in brass. He was a
  Maecenas without a Horace, an Earl of Southampton without a Shakespeare. In a
  word, Aix-les-Bains in the season was the very place for him; and never for a
  moment did it occur to him that he was here to be dipped in agitations, and
  hurried from excitement to excitement. The beauty of the little town, the
  crowd of well-dressed and agreeable people, the rose- coloured life of the
  place, all made their appeal to him. But it was the Villa des Fleurs which
  brought him to Aix. Not that he played for anything more than an occasional
  louis; nor, on the other hand, was he merely a cold looker-on. He had a
  bank-note or two in his pocket on most evenings at the service of the victims
  of the tables. But the pleasure to his curious and dilettante mind lay in the
  spectacle of the battle which was waged night after night between raw nature
  and good manners. It was extraordinary to him how constantly manners
  prevailed. There were, however, exceptions.</p>

  <p>For instance. On the first evening of this particular visit he found the
  rooms hot, and sauntered out into the little semicircular garden at the back.
  He sat there for half an hour under a flawless sky of stars watching the
  people come and go in the light of the electric lamps, and appreciating the
  gowns and jewels of the women with the eye of a connoisseur; and then into
  this starlit quiet there came suddenly a flash of vivid life. A girl in a
  soft, clinging frock of white satin darted swiftly from the rooms and flung
  herself nervously upon a bench. She could not, to Ricardo's thinking, be more
  than twenty years of age. She was certainly quite young. The supple
  slenderness of her figure proved it, and he had moreover caught a glimpse, as
  she rushed out, of a fresh and very pretty face; but he had lost sight of it
  now. For the girl wore a big black satin hat with a broad brim, from which a
  couple of white ostrich feathers curved over at the back, and in the shadow
  of that hat her face was masked. All that he could see was a pair of long
  diamond eardrops, which sparkled and trembled as she moved her head &mdash;
  and that she did constantly. Now she stared moodily at the ground; now she
  flung herself back; then she twisted nervously to the right, and then a
  moment afterwards to the left; and then again she stared in front of her,
  swinging a satin slipper backwards and forwards against the pavement with the
  petulance of a child. All her movements were spasmodic; she was on the verge
  of hysteria. Ricardo was expecting her to burst into tears, when she sprang
  up and as swiftly as she had come she hurried back into the rooms. "Summer
  lightning," thought Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>Near to him a woman sneered, and a man said, pityingly: "She was pretty,
  that little one. It is regrettable that she has lost."</p>

  <p>A few minutes afterwards Ricardo finished his cigar and strolled back into
  the rooms, making his way to the big table just on the right hand of the
  entrance, where the play as a rule runs high. It was clearly running high
  tonight. For so deep a crowd thronged about the table that Ricardo could only
  by standing on tiptoe see the faces of the players. Of the banker he could
  not catch a glimpse. But though the crowd remained, its units were constantly
  changing, and it was not long before Ricardo found himself standing in the
  front rank of the spectators, just behind the players seated in the chairs.
  The oval green table was spread out beneath him littered with bank-notes.
  Ricardo turned his eyes to the left, and saw seated at the middle of the
  table the man who was holding the bank. Ricardo recognised him with a start
  of surprise. He was a young Englishman, Harry Wethermill, who, after a
  brilliant career at Oxford and at Munich, had so turned his scientific genius
  to account that he had made a fortune for himself at the age of
  twenty-eight.</p>

  <p>He sat at the table with the indifferent look of the habitual player upon
  his cleanly chiselled face. But it was plain that his good fortune stayed at
  his elbow tonight, for opposite to him the croupier was arranging with
  extraordinary deftness piles of bank-notes in the order of their value. The
  bank was winning heavily. Even as Ricardo looked Wethermill turned up "a
  natural," and the croupier swept in the stakes from either side.</p>

  <p>"Faites vos jeux, messieurs. Le jeu est fait?" the croupier cried, all in
  a breath, and repeated the words. Wethermill waited with his hand upon the
  wooden frame in which the cards were stacked. He glanced round the table
  while the stakes were being laid upon the cloth, and suddenly his face
  flashed from languor into interest. Almost opposite to him a small,
  white-gloved hand holding a five-louis note was thrust forward between the
  shoulders of two men seated at the table. Wethermill leaned forward and shook
  his head with a smile. With a gesture he refused the stake. But he was too
  late. The fingers of the hand had opened, the note fluttered down onto the
  cloth, the money was staked.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="c00070-images/AtTheVillaRose01.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>At once he leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Il y a une suite," he said quietly. He relinquished the bank rather than
  play against that five-louis note. The stakes were taken up by their
  owners.</p>

  <p>The croupier began to count Wethermill's winnings, and Ricardo, curious to
  know whose small, delicately gloved hand it was which had brought the game to
  so abrupt a termination, leaned forward. He recognised the young girl in the
  white satin dress and the big black hat whose nerves had got the better of
  her a few minutes since in the garden. He saw her now clearly, and thought
  her of an entrancing loveliness. She was moderately tall, fair of skin, with
  a fresh colouring upon her cheeks which she owed to nothing but her youth.
  Her hair was of a light brown with a sheen upon it, her forehead broad, her
  eyes dark and wonderfully clear. But there was something more than her beauty
  to attract him. He had a strong belief that somewhere, some while ago, he had
  already seen her. And this belief grew and haunted him. He was still vaguely
  puzzling his brains to fix the place when the croupier finished his
  reckoning.</p>

  <p>"There are two thousand louis in the bank," he cried. "Who will take on
  the bank for two thousand louis?"</p>

  <p>No one, however, was willing. A fresh bank was put up for sale, and
  Wethermill, still sitting in the dealer's chair, bought it. He spoke at once
  to an attendant, and the man slipped round the table, and, forcing his way
  through the crowd, carried a message to the girl in the black hat. She looked
  towards Wethermill and smiled; and the smile made her face a miracle of
  tenderness. Then she disappeared, and in a few moments Ricardo saw a way open
  in the throng behind the banker, and she appeared again only a yard or two
  away, just behind Wethermill. He turned, and taking her hand into his, shook
  it chidingly.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't let you play against me, Celia," he said, in English; "my
  luck's too good tonight. So you shall be my partner instead. I'll put in the
  capital and we'll share the winnings."</p>

  <p>The girl's face flushed rosily. Her hand still lay clasped in his. She
  made no effort to withdraw it.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do that," she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said he. "See!" and loosening her fingers he took from them the
  five-louis note and tossed it over to the croupier to be added to his bank.
  "Now you can't help yourself. We're partners."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed, and the company at the table smiled, half in sympathy,
  half with amusement. A chair was brought for her, and she sat down behind
  Wethermill, her lips parted, her face joyous with excitement. But all at once
  Wethermill's luck deserted him. He renewed his bank three times, and had lost
  the greater part of his winnings when he had dealt the cards through. He took
  a fourth bank, and rose from that, too, a loser.</p>

  <p>"That's enough, Celia," he said. "Let us go out into the garden; it will
  be cooler there,"</p>

  <p>"I have taken your good luck away," said the girl remorsefully. Wethermill
  put his arm through hers.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to take yourself away before you can do that," he answered,
  and the couple walked together out of Ricardo's hearing.</p>

  <p>Ricardo was left to wonder about Celia. She was just one of those problems
  which made Aix-les-Bains so unfailingly attractive to him. She dwelt in some
  street of Bohemia; so much was clear. The frankness of her pleasure, of her
  excitement, and even of her distress proved it. She passed from one to the
  other while you could deal a pack of cards. She was at no pains to wear a
  mask. Moreover, she was a young girl of nineteen or twenty, running about
  those rooms alone, as unembarrassed as if she had been at home. There was the
  free use, too, of Christian names. Certainly she dwelt in Bohemia. But it
  seemed to Ricardo that she could pass in any company and yet not be
  overpassed. She would look a little more picturesque than most girls of her
  age, and she was certainly a good deal more soignee than many, and she had
  the Frenchwoman's knack of putting on her clothes. But those would be all the
  differences, leaving out the frankness. Ricardo wondered in what street of
  Bohemia she dwelt. He wondered still more when he saw her again half an hour
  afterwards at the entrance to the Villa des Fleurs. She came down the long
  hall with Harry Wethermill at her side. The couple were walking slowly, and
  talking as they walked with so complete an absorption in each other that they
  were unaware of their surroundings. At the bottom of the steps a stout woman
  of fifty-five over- jewelled, and over-dressed and raddled with paint,
  watched their approach with a smile of good-humoured amusement. When they
  came near enough to hear she said in French:</p>

  <p>"Well, Célie, are you ready to go home?"</p>

  <p>The girl looked up with a start.</p>

  <p>"Of course, madame," she said, with a certain submissiveness which
  surprised Ricardo. "I hope I have not kept you waiting."</p>

  <p>She ran to the cloak-room, and came back again with her cloak.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Harry," she said, dwelling upon his name and looking out upon
  him with soft and smiling eyes.</p>

  <p>"I shall see you tomorrow evening," he said, holding her hand. Again she
  let it stay within his keeping, but she frowned, and a sudden gravity settled
  like a cloud upon her face. She turned to the elder woman with a sort of
  appeal.</p>

  <p>"No, I do not think we shall be here, tomorrow, shall we, madame?" she
  said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," said madame briskly. "You have not forgotten what we have
  planned? No, we shall not be here tomorrow; but the night after &mdash;
  yes."</p>

  <p>Celia turned back again to Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we have plans for tomorrow," she said, with a very wistful note of
  regret in her voice; and seeing that madame was already at the door, she bent
  forward and said timidly, "But the night after I shall want you."</p>

  <p>"I shall thank you for wanting me," Wethermill rejoined; and the girl tore
  her hand away and ran up the steps.</p>

  <p>Harry Wethermill returned to the rooms. Mr. Ricardo did not follow him. He
  was too busy with the little problem which had been presented to him that
  night. What could that girl, he asked himself, have in common with the
  raddled woman she addressed so respectfully? Indeed, there had been a note of
  more than respect in her voice. There had been something of affection. Again
  Mr. Ricardo found himself wondering in what street in Bohemia Celia dwelt
  &mdash; and as he walked up to the hotel there came yet other questions to
  amuse him.</p>

  <p>"Why," he asked, "could neither Celia nor madame come to the Villa des
  Fleurs tomorrow night? What are the plans they have made? And what was it in
  those plans which had brought the sudden gravity and reluctance into Celia's
  face?"</p>

  <p>Ricardo had reason to remember those questions during the next few days,
  though he only idled with them now.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2"><small>CHAPTER 2</small></a><br>
  <br>
  A CRY FOR HELP</h2>

  <p class="first">It was on a Monday evening that Ricardo saw Harry Wethermill
  and the girl Celia together. On the Tuesday he saw Wethermill in the rooms
  alone and had some talk with him.</p>

  <p>Wethermill was not playing that night, and about ten o'clock the two men
  left the Villa des Fleurs together.</p>

  <p>"Which way do you go?" asked Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"Up the hill to the Hotel Majestic," said Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"We go together, then. I, too, am staying there," said the young man, and
  they climbed the steep streets together. Ricardo was dying to put some
  questions about Wethermill's young friend of the night before, but discretion
  kept him reluctantly silent. They chatted for a few moments in the hall upon
  indifferent topics and so separated for the night. Mr. Ricardo, however, was
  to learn something more of Celia the next morning; for while he was fixing
  his tie before the mirror Wethermill burst into his dressing-room. Mr.
  Ricardo forgot his curiosity in the surge of his indignation. Such an
  invasion was an unprecedented outrage upon the gentle tenor of his life. The
  business of the morning toilette was sacred. To interrupt it carried a subtle
  suggestion of anarchy. Where was his valet? Where was Charles, who should
  have guarded the door like the custodian of a chapel?</p>

  <p>"I cannot speak to you for at least another half-hour," said Mr. Ricardo,
  sternly.</p>

  <p>But Harry Wethermill was out of breath and shaking with agitation.</p>

  <p>"I can't wait," he cried, with a passionate appeal. "I have got to see
  you. You must help me, Mr. Ricardo &mdash; you must, indeed!"</p>

  <p>Ricardo spun round upon his heel. At first he had thought that the help
  wanted was the help usually wanted at Aix-les-Bains. A glance at Wethermills
  face, however, and the ringing note of anguish in his voice, told him that
  the thought was wrong. Mr. Ricardo slipped out of his affectations as out of
  a loose coat. "What has happened?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Something terrible." With shaking fingers Wethermill held out a
  newspaper. "Read it," he said.</p>

  <p>It was a special edition of a local newspaper, Le Journal de Savoie, and
  it bore the date of that morning.</p>

  <p>"They are crying it in the streets," said Wethermill. "Read!"</p>

  <p>A short paragraph was printed in large black letters on the first page,
  and leaped to the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Late last night," it ran, "an appalling murder was committed at the Villa
  Rose, on the road to Lac Bourget. Mme. Camille Dauvray, an elderly, rich
  woman who was well known at Aix, and had occupied the villa every summer for
  the last few years, was discovered on the floor of her salon, fully dressed
  and brutally strangled, while upstairs, her maid, Helène Vauquier, was found
  in bed, chloroformed, with her hands tied securely behind her back. At the
  time of going to press she had not recovered consciousness, but the doctor,
  Emile Peytin, is in attendance upon her, and it is hoped that she will be
  able shortly to throw some light on this dastardly affair. The police are
  properly reticent as to the details of the crime, but the following statement
  may be accepted without hesitation:</p>

  <p>"The murder was discovered at twelve o'clock at night by the sergent-de-
  ville Perrichet, to whose intelligence more than a word of praise is due, and
  it is obvious from the absence of all marks upon the door and windows that
  the murderer was admitted from within the villa. Meanwhile Mme. Dauvray's
  motor-car has disappeared, and with it a young Englishwoman who came to Aix
  with her as her companion. The motive of the crime leaps to the eyes. Mme.
  Dauvray was famous in Aix for her jewels, which she wore with too little
  prudence. The condition of the house shows that a careful search was made for
  them, and they have disappeared. It is anticipated that a description of the
  young Englishwoman, with a reward for her apprehension, will be issued
  immediately. And it is not too much to hope that the citizens of Aix, and
  indeed of Prance, will be cleared of all participation in so cruel and
  sinister a crime."</p>

  <p>Ricardo read through the paragraph with a growing consternation, and laid
  the paper upon his dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"It is infamous," cried Wethermill passionately.</p>

  <p>"The young Englishwoman is, I suppose, your friend Miss Celia?" said
  Ricardo slowly.</p>

  <p>Wethermill started forward.</p>

  <p>"You know her, then?" he cried in amazement.</p>

  <p>"No; but I saw her with you in the rooms. I heard you call her by that
  name."</p>

  <p>"You saw us together?" exclaimed Wethermill. "Then you can understand how
  infamous the suggestion is."</p>

  <p>But Ricardo had seen the girl half an hour before he had seen her with
  Harry Wethermill. He could not but vividly remember the picture of her as she
  flung herself on to the bench in the garden in a moment of hysteria, and
  petulantly kicked a satin slipper backwards and forwards against the stones.
  She was young, she was pretty, she had a charm of freshness, but &mdash; but
  &mdash; strive against it as he would, this picture in the recollection began
  more and more to wear a sinister aspect. He remembered some words spoken by a
  stranger. "She is pretty, that little one. It is regrettable that she has
  lost."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo arranged his tie with even a greater deliberation than he
  usually employed.</p>

  <p>"And Mme. Dauvray?" he asked. "She was the stout woman with whom your
  young friend went away?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Wethermill.</p>

  <p>Ricardo turned round from the mirror.</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Hanaud is at Aix. He is the cleverest of the French detectives. You know
  him. He dined with you once."</p>

  <p>It was Mr. Ricardo's practice to collect celebrities round his dinner-
  table, and at one such gathering Hanaud and Wethermill had been present
  together.</p>

  <p>"You wish me to approach him?"</p>

  <p>"At once."</p>

  <p>"It is a delicate position," said Ricardo. "Here is a man in charge of a
  case of murder, and we are quietly to go to him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>To his relief Wethermill interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he cried; "he is not in charge of the case. He is on his
  holiday. I read of his arrival two days ago in the newspaper. It was stated
  that he came for rest. What I want is that he should take charge of the
  case."</p>

  <p>The superb confidence of Wethermill shook Mr. Ricardo for a moment, but
  his recollections were too clear.</p>

  <p>"You are going out of your way to launch the acutest of French detectives
  in search of this girl. Are you wise, Wethermill?"</p>

  <p>Wethermill sprang up from his chair in desperation.</p>

  <p>"You, too, think her guilty! You have seen her. You think her guilty
  &mdash; like this detestable newspaper, like the police."</p>

  <p>"Like the police?" asked Ricardo sharply.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Harry Wethermill sullenly. "As soon as I saw that rag I ran
  down to the villa. The police are in possession. They would not let me into
  the garden. But I talked with one of them. They, too, think that she let in
  the murderers."</p>

  <p>Ricardo took a turn across the room. Then he came to a stop in front of
  Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," he said solemnly. "I saw this girl half an hour before I
  saw you. She rushed out into the garden. She flung herself on to a bench. She
  could not sit still. She was hysterical. You know what that means. She had
  been losing. That's point number one."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo ticked it off upon his finger.</p>

  <p>"She ran back into the rooms. You asked her to share the winnings of your
  bank. She consented eagerly. And you lost. That's point number two. A little
  later, as she was going away, you asked her whether she would be in the rooms
  the next night &mdash; yesterday night &mdash; the night when the murder was
  committed. Her face clouded over. She hesitated. She became more than grave.
  There was a distinct impression as though she shrank from the contemplation
  of what it was proposed she should do on the next night. And then she
  answered you, 'No, we have other plans.' That's number three." And Mr.
  Ricardo ticked off his third point.</p>

  <p>"Now," he asked, "do you still ask me to launch Hanaud upon the case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and at once," cried Wethermill.</p>

  <p>Ricardo called for his hat and his stick.</p>

  <p>"You know where Hanaud is staying?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Wethermill, and he led Ricardo to an unpretentious little
  hotel in the centre of the town. Ricardo sent in his name, and the two
  visitors were immediately shown into a small sitting-room, where M. Hanaud
  was enjoying his morning chocolate. He was stout and broad-shouldered, with a
  full and almost heavy face. In his morning suit at his breakfast-table he
  looked like a prosperous comedian.</p>

  <p>He came forward with a smile of welcome, extending both his hands to Mr.
  Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my good friend," he said, "it is pleasant to see you. And Mr.
  Wethermill," he exclaimed, holding a hand out to the young inventor.</p>

  <p>"You remember me, then?" said Wethermill gladly.</p>

  <p>"It is my profession to remember people," said Hanaud, with a laugh. "You
  were at that amusing dinner-party of Mr. Ricardo's in Grosvenor Square."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," said Wethermill, "I have come to ask your help."</p>

  <p>The note of appeal in his voice was loud. M. Hanaud drew up a chair by the
  window and motioned to Wethermill to take it. He pointed to another, with a
  bow of invitation to Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Let me hear," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>"It is the murder of Mme. Dauvray," said Wethermill.</p>

  <p>Hanaud started.</p>

  <p>"And in what way, monsieur," he asked, "are you interested in the murder
  of Mme. Dauvray?"</p>

  <p>"Her companion," said Wethermill, "the young English girl &mdash; she is a
  great friend of mine."</p>

  <p>Hanaud's face grew stern. Then came a sparkle of anger in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"And what do you wish me to do, monsieur?" he asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"You are upon your holiday, M. Hanaud. I wish you &mdash; no, I implore
  you," Wethermill cried, his voice ringing with passion, "to take up this
  case, to discover the truth, to find out what has become of Celia."</p>

  <p>Hanaud leaned back in his chair with his hands upon the arms. He did not
  take his eyes from Harry Wethermill, but the anger died out of them.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he said, "I do not know what your procedure is in England. But
  in France a detective does not take up a case or leave it alone according to
  his pleasure. We are only servants. This affair is in the hands of M.
  Fleuriot, the Juge d'lnstruction of Aix."</p>

  <p>"But if you offered him your help it would be welcomed," cried Wethermill.
  "And to me that would mean so much. There would be no bungling. There would
  be no waste of time. Of that one would be sure."</p>

  <p>Hanaud shook his head gently. His eyes were softened now by a look of
  pity. Suddenly he stretched out a forefinger.</p>

  <p>"You have, perhaps, a photograph of the young lady in that card-case in
  your breast-pocket."</p>

  <p>Wethermill flushed red, and, drawing out the card-case, handed the
  portrait to Hanaud. Hanaud looked at it carefully for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"It was taken lately, here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; for me," replied Wethermill quietly.</p>

  <p>"And it is a good likeness?"</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>"How long have you known this Mlle. Célie?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Wethermill looked at Hanaud with a certain defiance.</p>

  <p>"For a fortnight."</p>

  <p>Hanaud raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"You met her here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"In the rooms, I suppose? Not at the house of one of your friends?"</p>

  <p>"That is so," said Wethermill quietly. "A friend of mine who had met her
  in Paris introduced me to her at my request."</p>

  <p>Hanaud handed back the portrait and drew forward his chair nearer to
  Wethermill. His face had grown friendly. He spoke with a tone of respect.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, I know something of you. Our friend, Mr. Ricardo, told me your
  history; I asked him for it when I saw you at his dinner. You are of those
  about whom one does ask questions, and I know that you are not a romantic
  boy, but who shall say that he is safe from the appeal of beauty? I have seen
  women, monsieur, for whose purity of soul I would myself have stood security,
  condemned for complicity in brutal crimes on evidence that could not be
  gainsaid; and I have known them turn foul-mouthed, and hideous to look upon,
  the moment after their just sentence has been pronounced." "No doubt,
  monsieur," said Wethermill, with perfect quietude. "But Celia Harland is not
  one of those women."</p>

  <p>"I do not now say that she is," said Hanaud. "But the Juge d'lnstruction
  here has already sent to me to ask for my assistance, and I refused. I
  replied that I was just a good bourgeois enjoying his holiday. Still it is
  difficult quite to forget one's profession. It was the Commissaire of Police
  who came to me, and naturally I talked with him for a little while. The case
  is dark, monsieur, I warn you."</p>

  <p>"How dark?" asked Harry Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," said Hanaud, drawing his chair still closer to the
  young man. "Understand this in the first place. There was an accomplice
  within the villa. Some one let the murderers in. There is no sign of an
  entrance being forced; no lock was picked, there is no mark of a thumb on any
  panel, no sign of a bolt being forced. There was an accomplice within the
  house. We start from that."</p>

  <p>Wethermill nodded his head sullenly. Ricardo drew his chair up towards the
  others. But Hanaud was not at that moment interested in Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, let us see who there are in Mme. Dauvray's household. The
  list is not a long one. It was Mme. Dauvray's habit to take her luncheon and
  her dinner at the restaurants, and her maid was all that she required to get
  ready her 'petit dejeuner' in the morning and her 'sirop' at night. Let us
  take the members of the household one by one. There is first the chauffeur,
  Henri Servettaz. He was not at the villa last night. He came back to it early
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Ricardo, in a significant exclamation. Wethermill did not stir.
  He sat still as a stone, with a face deadly white and eyes burning upon
  Hanaud's face.</p>

  <p>"But wait," said Hanaud, holding up a warning hand to Ricardo. "Servettaz
  was in Chambery, where his parents live. He travelled to Chambery by the two
  o'clock train yesterday. He was with them in the afternoon. He went with them
  to a cafe in the evening. Moreover, early this morning the maid, Helène
  Vauquier, was able to speak a few words in answer to a question. She said
  Servettaz was in Chambery. She gave his address. A telephone message was sent
  to the police in that town, and Servettaz was found in bed. I do not say that
  it is impossible that Servettaz was concerned in the crime. That we shall
  see. But it is quite clear, I think, that it was not he who opened the house
  to the murderers, for he was at Chambery in the evening, and the murder was
  already discovered here by midnight. Moreover &mdash; it is a small point
  &mdash; he lives, not in the house, but over the garage in a corner of the
  garden. Then besides the chauffeur there was a charwoman, a woman of Aix, who
  came each morning at seven and left in the evening at seven or eight.
  Sometimes she would stay later if the maid was alone in the house, for the
  maid is nervous. But she left last night before nine &mdash; there is
  evidence of that &mdash; and the murder did not take place until afterwards.
  That is also a fact, not a conjecture. We can leave the charwoman, who for
  the rest has the best of characters, out of our calculations. There remain
  then, the maid, Helène Vauquier, and" &mdash; he shrugged his shoulders
  &mdash; "Mlle. Célie."</p>

  <p>Hanaud reached out for the matches and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Let us take first the maid, Helène Vauquier. Forty years old, a Normandy
  peasant woman &mdash; they are not bad people, the Normandy peasants,
  monsieur &mdash; avaricious, no doubt, but on the whole honest and most
  respectable. We know something of Helène Vauquier, monsieur. See!" and he
  took up a sheet of paper from the table. The paper was folded lengthwise,
  written upon only on the inside. "I have some details here. Our police system
  is, I think, a little more complete than yours in England. Helène Vauquier
  has served Mme. Dauvray for seven years. She has been the confidential friend
  rather than the maid. And mark this, M. Wethermill! During those seven years
  how many opportunities has she had of conniving at last night's crime? She
  was found chloroformed and bound. There is no doubt that she was
  chloroformed. Upon that point Dr. Peytin is quite, quite certain. He saw her
  before she recovered consciousness. She was violently sick on awakening. She
  sank again into unconsciousness. She is only now in a natural sleep. Besides
  those people, there is Mlle. Célie. Of her, monsieur, nothing is known. You
  yourself know nothing of her. She comes suddenly to Aix as the companion of
  Mme. Dauvray &mdash; a young and pretty English girl. How did she become the
  companion of Mme. Dauvray?"</p>

  <p>Wethermill stirred uneasily in his seat. His face flushed. To Mr. Ricardo
  that had been from the beginning the most interesting problem of the case.
  Was he to have the answer now?</p>

  <p>"I do not know," answered Wethermill, with some hesitation, and then it
  seemed that he was at once ashamed of his hesitation. His accent gathered
  strength, and in a low but ringing voice, he added: "But I say this. You have
  told me, M. Hanaud, of women who looked innocent and were guilty. But you
  know also of women and girls who can live untainted and unspoilt amidst
  surroundings which are suspicious."</p>

  <p>Hanaud listened, but he neither agreed nor denied. He took up a second
  slip of paper.</p>

  <p>"I shall tell you something now of Mme. Dauvray," he said. "We will not
  take up her early history. It might not be edifying and, poor woman, she is
  dead. Let us not go back beyond her marriage seventeen years ago to a wealthy
  manufacturer of Nancy, whom she had met in Paris. Seven years ago M. Dauvray
  died, leaving his widow a very rich woman. She had a passion for jewellery,
  which she was now able to gratify. She collected jewels. A famous necklace, a
  well-known stone &mdash; she was not, as you say, happy till she got it. She
  had a fortune in precious stones &mdash; oh, but a large fortune! By the
  ostentation of her jewels she paraded her wealth here, at Monte Carlo, in
  Paris. Besides that, she was kind-hearted and most impressionable. Finally,
  she was, like so many of her class, superstitious to the degree of
  folly."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Mr. Ricardo started in his chair. Superstitious! The word was a
  sudden light upon his darkness. Now he knew what had perplexed him during the
  last two days. Clearly &mdash; too clearly &mdash; he remembered where he had
  seen Celia Harland, and when. A picture rose before his eyes, and it seemed
  to strengthen like a film in a developing-dish as Hanaud continued:</p>

  <p>"Very well! take Mme. Dauvray as we find her &mdash; rich, ostentatious,
  easily taken by a new face, generous, and foolishly superstitious &mdash; and
  you have in her a living provocation to every rogue. By a hundred instances
  she proclaimed herself a dupe. She threw down a challenge to every criminal
  to come and rob her. For seven years Helène Vauquier stands at her elbow and
  protects her from serious trouble. Suddenly there is added to her &mdash;
  your young friend, and she is robbed and murdered. And, follow this, M.
  Wethermill, our thieves are, I think, more brutal to their victims than is
  the case with you."</p>

  <p>Wethermill shut his eyes in a spasm of pain and the pallor of his face
  increased.</p>

  <p>"Suppose that Celia were one of the victims?" he cried in a stifled
  voice.</p>

  <p>Hanaud glanced at him with a look of commiseration.</p>

  <p>"That perhaps we shall see," he said. "But what I meant was this. A
  stranger like Mlle. Célie might be the accomplice in such a crime as the
  crime of the Villa Rose, meaning only robbery. A stranger might only have
  discovered too late that murder would be added to the theft."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in strong, clear colours, Ricardo's picture stood out before
  his eyes. He was startled by hearing Wethermill say, in a firm voice:</p>

  <p>"My friend Ricardo has something to add to what you have said."</p>

  <p>"I!" exclaimed Ricardo. How in the world could Wethermill know of that
  clear picture in his mind?</p>

  <p>"Yes. You saw Celia Harland on the evening before the murder."</p>

  <p>Ricardo stared at his friend. It seemed to him that Harry Wethermill had
  gone out of his mind. Here he was corroborating the suspicions of the police
  by facts &mdash; damning and incontrovertible facts.</p>

  <p>"On the night before the murder," continued Wethermill quietly, "Celia
  Harland lost money at the baccarat-table. Ricardo saw her in the garden
  behind the rooms, and she was hysterical. Later on that same night he saw her
  again with me, and he heard what she said. I asked her to come to the rooms
  on the next evening &mdash; yesterday, the night of the crime &mdash; and her
  face changed, and she said, 'No, we have other plans for tomorrow. But the
  night after I shall want you.'"</p>

  <p>Hanaud sprang up from his chair.</p>

  <p>"And YOU tell me these two things!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Wethermill. "You were kind enough to say to me I was not a
  romantic boy. I am not. I can face facts."</p>

  <p>Hanaud stared at his companion for a few moments. Then, with a remarkable
  air of consideration, he bowed.</p>

  <p>"You have won, monsieur," he said. "I will take up this case. But," and
  his face grew stern and he brought his fist down upon the table with a bang,
  "I shall follow it to the end now, be the consequences bitter as death to
  you."</p>

  <p>"That is what I wish, monsieur," said Wethermill.</p>

  <p>Hanaud locked up the slips of paper in his lettercase. Then he went out of
  the room and returned in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"We will begin at the beginning," he said briskly. "I have telephoned to
  the Depot. Perrichet, the sergent-de-ville who discovered the crime, will be
  here at once. We will walk down to the villa with him, and on the way he
  shall tell us exactly what he discovered and how he discovered it. At the
  villa we shall find Monsieur Fleuriot, the Juge d'lnstruction, who has
  already begun his examination, and the Commissaire of Police. In company with
  them we will inspect the villa. Except for the removal of Mme. Dauvray's body
  from the salon to her bedroom and the opening of the windows, the house
  remains exactly as it was."</p>

  <p>"We may come with you?" cried Harry Wethermill eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, on one condition &mdash; that you ask no questions, and answer none
  unless I put them to you. Listen, watch, examine &mdash; but no
  interruptions!"</p>

  <p>Hanaud's manner had altogether changed. It was now authoritative and
  alert. He turned to Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"You will swear to what you saw in the garden and to the words you heard?"
  he asked. "They are important."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ricardo.</p>

  <p>But he kept silence about that clear picture in his mind which to him
  seemed no less important, no less suggestive.</p>

  <p>The Assembly Hall at Leamington, a crowded audience chiefly of ladies, a
  platform at one end on which a black cabinet stood. A man, erect and with
  something of the soldier in his bearing, led forward a girl, pretty and fair-
  haired, who wore a black velvet dress with a long, sweeping train. She moved
  like one in a dream. Some half-dozen people from the audience climbed on to
  the platform, tied thy girl's hands with tape behind her back, and sealed the
  tape. She was led to the cabinet, and in full view of the audience fastened
  to a bench. Then the door of the cabinet was closed, the people upon the
  platform descended into the body of the hall, and the lights were turned very
  low. The audience sat in suspense, and then abruptly in the silence and the
  darkness there came the rattle of a tambourine from the empty platform.
  Rappings and knockings seemed to flicker round the panels of the hall, and in
  the place where the door of the cabinet should be there appeared a splash of
  misty whiteness. The whiteness shaped itself dimly into the figure of a
  woman, a face dark and Eastern became visible, and a deep voice spoke in a
  chant of the Nile and Antony. Then the vision faded, the tambourines and
  cymbals rattled again. The lights were turned up, the door of the cabinet
  thrown open, and the girl in the black velvet dress was seen fastened upon
  the bench within.</p>

  <p>It was a spiritualistic performance at which Julius Ricardo had been
  present two years ago. The young, fair-haired girl in black velvet, the
  medium, was Celia Harland.</p>

  <p>That was the picture which was in Ricardo's mind, and Hanaud's description
  of Mme. Dauvray made a terrible commentary upon it. "Easily taken by a new
  face, generous, and foolishly superstitious, a living provocation to every
  rogue." Those were the words, and here was a beautiful girl of twenty versed
  in those very tricks of imposture which would make Mme. Dauvray her natural
  prey!</p>

  <p>Ricardo looked at Wethermill, doubtful whether he should tell what he knew
  of Celia Harland or not. But before he had decided a knock came upon the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Here is Perrichet," said Hanaud, taking up his hat. "We will go down to
  the Villa Rose."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3"><small>CHAPTER 3</small></a><br>
  <br>
  PERRICHET'S STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">Perrichet was a young, thick-set man, with, a red, fair
  face, and a moustache and hair so pale in colour that they were almost
  silver. He came into the room with an air of importance.</p>

  <p>"Aha!" said Hanaud, with a malicious smile. "You went to bed late last
  night, my friend. Yet you were up early enough to read the newspaper. Well, I
  am to have the honour of being associated with you in this case."</p>

  <p>Perrichet twirled his cap awkwardly and blushed.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is pleased to laugh at me," he said. "But it was not I who
  called myself intelligent. Though indeed I would like to be so, for the good
  God knows I do not look it."</p>

  <p>Hanaud clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Then congratulate yourself! It is a great advantage to be intelligent and
  not to look it. We shall get on famously. Come!"</p>

  <p>The four men descended the stairs, and as they walked towards the villa
  Perrichet related, concisely and clearly, his experience of the night.</p>

  <p>"I passed the gate of the villa about half-past nine," he said. "The gate
  was dosed. Above the wall and bushes of the garden I saw a bright light in
  the room upon the first floor which faces the road at the south-western comer
  of the villa. The lower windows I could not see. More than an hour afterwards
  I came back, and as I passed the villa again I noticed that there was now no
  light in the room upon the first floor, but that the gate was open. I
  thereupon went into the garden, and, pulling the gate, let it swing to and
  latch. But it occurred to me as I did so that there might be visitors at the
  villa who had not yet left, and for whom the gate had been set open. I
  accordingly followed the drive which winds round to the front door. The front
  door is not on the side of the villa which faces the road, but at the back.
  When I came to the open space where the carriages turn, I saw that the house
  was in complete darkness. There were wooden latticed doors to the long
  windows on the ground floor, and these were closed. I tried one to make
  certain, and found the fastenings secure. The other windows upon that floor
  were shuttered. No light gleamed anywhere. I then left the garden, closing
  the gate behind me. I heard a clock strike the hour a few minutes afterwards,
  so that I can be sure of the time. It was now eleven o'clock. I came round a
  third time an hour after, and to my astonishment I found the gate once more
  open. I had left it closed and the house shut up and dark. Now it stood open!
  I looked up to the windows and I saw that in a room on the second floor,
  close beneath the roof, a light was burning brightly. That room had been dark
  an hour before. I stood and watched the light for a few minutes, thinking
  that I should see it suddenly go out. But it did not: it burned quite
  steadily. This light and the gate opened and reopened aroused my suspicions.
  I went again into the garden, but this time with greater caution. It was a
  clear night, and, although there was no moon, I could see without the aid of
  my lantern. I stole quietly along the drive. When I came round to the front
  door, I noticed immediately that the shutters of one of the ground-floor
  windows were swung back, and that the inside glass window which descended to
  the ground stood open. The sight gave me a shock. Within the house those
  shutters had been opened. I felt the blood turn to ice in my veins and a
  chill crept along my spine. I thought of that solitary light burning steadily
  under the roof. I was convinced that something terrible had happened."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. Quite so," said Hanaud. "Go on, my friend."</p>

  <p>"The interior of the room gaped black," Perrichet resumed. "I crept up to
  the window at the side of the wall and dashed my lantern into the room. The
  window, however, was in a recess which opened into the room through an arch,
  and at each side of the arch curtains were draped. The curtains were not
  closed, but between them I could see nothing but a strip of the room. I
  stepped carefully in, taking heed not to walk on the patch of grass before
  the window. The light of my lantern showed me a chair overturned upon the
  floor, and to my right, below the middle one of the three windows in the
  right-hand side wall, a woman lying huddled upon the floor. It was Mme.
  Dauvray. She was dressed. There was a little mud upon her shoes, as though
  she had walked after the rain had ceased. Monsieur will remember that two
  heavy showers fell last evening between six and eight."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hanaud, nodding his approval.</p>

  <p>"She was quite dead. Her face was terribly swollen and black, and a piece
  of thin strong cord was knotted so tightly about her neck and had sunk so
  deeply into her flesh that at first I did not see it. For Mme. Dauvray was
  stout."</p>

  <p>"Then what did you do?" asked Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"I went to the telephone which was in the hall and rang up the police.
  Then I crept upstairs very cautiously, trying the doors. I came upon no one
  until I reached the room under the roof where the light was burning; there I
  found Helène Vauquier, the maid, snoring in bed in a terrible fashion."</p>

  <p>The four men turned a bend in the road. A few paces away a knot of people
  stood before a gate which a sergent-de-ville guarded.</p>

  <p>"But here we are at the villa," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>They all looked up and, from a window at the corner upon the first floor a
  man looked out and drew in his head.</p>

  <p>"That is M. Besnard, the Commissaire of our police in Aix," said
  Perrichet.</p>

  <p>"And the window from which he looked," said Hanaud, "must be the window of
  that room in which you saw the bright light at half-past nine on your first
  round?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'sieur," said Perrichet; "that is the window."</p>

  <p>They stopped at the gate. Perrichet spoke to the sergent-de-ville, who at
  once held the gate open. The party passed into the garden of the villa.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4"><small>CHAPTER 4</small></a><br>
  <br>
  AT THE VILLA</h2>

  <p class="first">The drive curved between trees and high bushes towards the
  back of the house, and as the party advanced along it a small, trim,
  soldier-like man, with a pointed beard, came to meet them. It was the man who
  had looked out from the window, Louis Besnard, the Commissaire of Police.</p>

  <p>"You are coming, then, to help us, M. Hanaud!" he cried, extending his
  hands. "You will find no jealousy here; no spirit amongst us of anything but
  good will; no desire except one to carry out your suggestions. All we wish is
  that the murderers should be discovered. Mon Dieu, what a crime! And so young
  a girl to be involved in it! But what will you?"</p>

  <p>"So you have already made your mind up on that point!" said Hanaud
  sharply.</p>

  <p>The Commissaire shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Examine the villa and then judge for yourself whether any other
  explanation is conceivable," he said; and turning, he waved his hand towards
  the house. Then he cried, "Ah!" and drew himself into an attitude of
  attention. A tall, thin man of about forty-five years, dressed in a frock
  coat and a high silk hat, had just come round an angle of the drive and was
  moving slowly towards them. He wore the soft, curling brown beard of one who
  has never used a razor on his chin, and had a narrow face with eyes of a very
  light grey, and a round bulging forehead.</p>

  <p>"This is the Juge d'Instruction?" asked Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"Yes; M. Fleuriot," replied Louis Besnard in a whisper.</p>

  <p>M. Fleuriot was occupied with his own thoughts, and it was not until
  Besnard stepped forward noisily on the gravel that he became aware of the
  group in the garden.</p>

  <p>"This is M. Hanaud, of the Sûreté in Paris," said Louis Besnard.</p>

  <p>M. Fleuriot bowed with cordiality.</p>

  <p>"You are very welcome, M. Hanaud. You will find that nothing at the villa
  has been disturbed. The moment the message arrived over the telephone that
  you were willing to assist us I gave instructions that all should be left as
  we found it. I trust that you, with your experience, will see a way where our
  eyes find none."</p>

  <p>Hanaud bowed in reply.</p>

  <p>"I shall do my best, M. Fleuriot. I can say no more," he said.</p>

  <p>"But who are these gentlemen?" asked Fleuriot, waking, it seemed, now for
  the first time to the presence of Harry Wethermill and Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"They are both friends of mine," replied Hanaud. "If you do not object I
  think their assistance may be useful. Mr. Wethermill, for instance, was
  acquainted with Celia Harland."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried the judge; and his face took on suddenly a keen and eager
  look. "You can tell me about her perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"All that I know I will tell readily," said Harry Wethermill.</p>

  <p>Into the light eyes of M. Fleuriot there came a cold, bright gleam. He
  took a step forward. His face seemed to narrow to a greater sharpness. In a
  moment, to Mr. Ricardo's thought, he ceased to be the judge; he dropped from
  his high office; he dwindled into a fanatic.</p>

  <p>"She is a Jewess, this Celia Harland?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"No, M. Fleuriot, she is not," replied Wethermill. "I do not speak in
  disparagement of that race, for I count many friends amongst its members. But
  Celia Harland is not one of them."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Fleuriot; and there was something of disappointment, something,
  too, of incredulity, in his voice. "Well, you will come and report to me when
  you have made your investigation." And he passed on without another question
  or remark.</p>

  <p>The group of men watched him go, and it was not until he was out of
  earshot that Besnard turned with a deprecating gesture to Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, he is a good judge, M. Hanaud &mdash; quick, discriminating,
  sympathetic; but he has that bee in his bonnet, like so many others.
  Everywhere he must see l'affaire Dreyfus. He cannot get it out of his head.
  No matter how insignificant a woman is murdered, she must have letters in her
  possession which would convict Dreyfus. But you know! There are thousands
  like that &mdash; good, kindly, just people in the ordinary ways of life, but
  behind every crime they see the Jew."</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"I know; and in a Juge d'Instruction it is very embarrassing. Let us walk
  on."</p>

  <p>Half-way between the gate and the villa a second carriage-road struck off
  to the left, and at the entrance to it stood a young, stout man in black
  leggings.</p>

  <p>"The chauffeur?" asked Hanaud. "I will speak to him."</p>

  <p>The Commissaire called the chauffeur forward.</p>

  <p>"Servettaz," he said, "you will answer any questions which monsieur may
  put to you."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, M. le Commissaire," said the chauffeur. His manner was
  serious, but he answered readily. There was no sign of fear upon his
  face.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been with Mme. Dauvray?" Hanaud asked.</p>

  <p>"Four months, monsieur. I drove her to Aix from Paris."</p>

  <p>"And since your parents live at Chambery you wished to seize the
  opportunity of spending a day with them while you were so near?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"When did you ask for permission?"</p>

  <p>"On Saturday, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Did you ask particularly that you should have yesterday, the
  Tuesday?"</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur; I asked only for a day whenever it should be convenient to
  madame."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Hanaud. "Now, when did Mme. Dauvray tell you that you
  might have Tuesday?"</p>

  <p>Servettaz hesitated. His face became troubled. When he spoke, he spoke
  reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"It was not Mme. Dauvray, monsieur, who told me that I might go on
  Tuesday," he said.</p>

  <p>"Not Mme. Dauvray! Who was it, then?" Hanaud asked sharply.</p>

  <p>Servettaz glanced from one to another of the grave faces which confronted
  him.</p>

  <p>"It was Mlle. Célie," he said, "who told me."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Hanaud, slowly. "It was Mlle. Célie. When did she tell
  you?"</p>

  <p>"On Monday morning, monsieur. I was cleaning the car. She came to the
  garage with some flowers in her hand which she had been cutting in the
  garden, and she said: 'I was right, Alphonse. Madame has a kind heart. You
  can go to- morrow by the train which leaves Aix at 1.52 and arrives at
  Chambery at nine minutes after two.'"</p>

  <p>Hanaud started.</p>

  <p>"'I was right, Alphonse.' Were those her words? And 'Madame has a kind
  heart.' Come, come, what is all this?" He lifted a warning finger and said
  gravely, "Be very careful, Servettaz."</p>

  <p>"Those were her words, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"'I was right, Alphonse. Madame has a kind heart'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Then Mlle. Célie had spoken to you before about this visit of yours to
  Chambery," said Hanaud, with his eyes fixed steadily upon the chauffeur's
  face. The distress upon Servettaz's face increased. Suddenly Hanaud's voice
  rang sharply. "You hesitate. Begin at the beginning. Speak the truth,
  Servettaz!"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, I am speaking the truth," said the chauffeur. "It is true I
  hesitate... I have heard this morning what people are saying... I do not know
  what to think. Mlle. Célie was always kind and thoughtful for me... But it is
  true" &mdash; and with a kind of desperation he went on &mdash; "yes, it is
  true that it was Mlle. Célie who first suggested to me that I should ask for
  a day to go to Chambery."</p>

  <p>"When did she suggest it?"</p>

  <p>"On the Saturday."</p>

  <p>To Mr. Ricardo the words were startling. He glanced with pity towards
  Wethermill. Wethermill, however, had made up his mind for good and all. He
  stood with a dogged look upon his face, his chin thrust forward, his eyes
  upon the chauffeur. Besnard, the Commissaire, had made up his mind, too. He
  merely shrugged his shoulders. Hanaud stepped forward and laid his hand
  gently on the chauffeur's arm.</p>

  <p>"Come, my friend," he said, "let us hear exactly how this happened!"</p>

  <p>"Mlle. Célie," said Servettaz, with genuine compunction in his voice,
  "came to the garage on Saturday morning and ordered the car for the
  afternoon. She stayed and talked to me for a little while, as she often did.
  She said that she had been told that my parents lived at Chambery, and since
  I was so near I ought to ask for a holiday. For it would not be kind if I did
  not go and see them."</p>

  <p>"That was all?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Very well." And the detective resumed at once his brisk voice and alert
  manner. He seemed to dismiss Servettaz's admission from his mind. Ricardo had
  the impression of a man tying up an important document which for the moment
  he has done with, and putting it away ticketed in some pigeon-hole in his
  desk. "Let us see the garage!"</p>

  <p>They followed the road between the bushes until a turn showed them the
  garage with its doors open.</p>

  <p>"The doors were found unlocked?"</p>

  <p>"Just as you see them."</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded. He spoke again to Servettaz. "What did you do with the key
  on Tuesday?"</p>

  <p>"I gave it to Helène Vauquier, monsieur, after I had locked up the garage.
  And she hung it on a nail in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Hanaud. "So any one could easily, have found it last
  night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur &mdash; if one knew where to look for it."</p>

  <p>At the back of the garage a row of petrol-tins stood against the brick
  wall.</p>

  <p>"Was any petrol taken?" asked Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur; there was very little petrol in the car when I went away.
  More was taken, but it was taken from the middle tins &mdash; these." And he
  touched the tins.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Hanaud, and he raised his eyebrows thoughtfully. The
  Commissaire moved with impatience.</p>

  <p>"From the middle or from the end &mdash; what does it matter?" he
  exclaimed. "The petrol was taken."</p>

  <p>Hanaud, however, did not dismiss the point so lightly.</p>

  <p>"But it is very possible that it does matter," he said gently. "For
  example, if Servettaz had had no reason to examine his tins it might have
  been some while before he found out that the petrol had been taken."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, yes," said Servettaz. "I might even have forgotten that I had not
  used it myself."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Hanaud, and he turned to Besnard.</p>

  <p>"I think that may be important. I do not know," he said.</p>

  <p>"But since the car is gone," cried Besnard, "how could the chauffeur not
  look immediately at his tins?"</p>

  <p>The question had occurred to Ricardo, and he wondered in what way Hanaud
  meant to answer it. Hanaud, however, did not mean to answer it. He took
  little notice of it at all. He put it aside with a superb indifference to the
  opinion which his companions might form of him.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," he said, carelessly. "Since the car is gone, as you say, that
  is so." And he turned again to Servettaz.</p>

  <p>"It was a powerful car?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sixty horse-power," said Servettaz.</p>

  <p>Hanaud turned to the Commissaire.</p>

  <p>"You have the number and description, I suppose? It will be as well to
  advertise for it. It may have been seen; it must be somewhere."</p>

  <p>The Commissaire replied that the description had already been printed, and
  Hanaud, with a nod of approval, examined the ground. In front of the garage
  there was a small stone courtyard, but on its surface there was no trace of a
  footstep.</p>

  <p>"Yet the gravel was wet," he said, shaking his head. "The man who fetched
  that car fetched it carefully."</p>

  <p>He turned and walked back with his eyes upon the ground. Then he ran to
  the grass border between the gravel and the bushes.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said to Wethermill; "a foot has pressed the blades of grass
  down here, but very lightly &mdash; yes, and there again. Some one ran along
  the border here on his toes. Yes, he was very careful."</p>

  <p>They turned again into the main drive, and, following it for a few yards,
  came suddenly upon a space in front of the villa. It was a small toy
  pleasure- house, looking on to a green lawn gay with flower-beds. It was
  built of yellow stone, and was almost square in shape. A couple of ornate
  pillars flanked the door, and a gable roof, topped by a gilt vane, surmounted
  it. To Ricardo it seemed impossible that so sordid and sinister a tragedy had
  taken place within its walls during the last twelve hours. It glistened so
  gaudily in the blaze of sunlight. Here and there the green outer shutters
  were closed; here and there the windows stood open to let in the air and
  light. Upon each side of the door there was a window lighting the hall, which
  was large; beyond those windows again, on each side, there were glass doors
  opening to the ground and protected by the ordinary green latticed shutters
  of wood, which now stood hooked back against the wall. These glass doors
  opened into rooms oblong in shape, which ran through towards the back of the
  house, and were lighted in addition by side windows. The room upon the
  extreme left, as the party faced the villa, was the dining-room, with the
  kitchen at the back; the room on the right was the salon in which the murder
  had been committed. In front of the glass door to this room a strip of what
  had once been grass stretched to the gravel drive. But the grass had been
  worn away by constant use, and the black mould showed through. This strip was
  about three yards wide, and as they approached they saw, even at a distance,
  that since the rain of last night it had been trampled down.</p>

  <p>"We will go round the house first," said Hanaud, and he turned along the
  side of the villa and walked in the direction of the road. There were four
  windows just above his head, of which three lighted the salon, and the fourth
  a small writing-room behind it. Under these windows there was no disturbance
  of the ground, and a careful investigation showed conclusively that the only
  entrance used had been the glass doors of the salon facing the drive. To that
  spot, then, they returned. There were three sets of footmarks upon the soil.
  One set ran in a distinct curve from the drive to the side of the door, and
  did not cross the others.</p>

  <p>"Those," said Hanaud, "are the footsteps of my intelligent friend,
  Perrichet, who was careful not to disturb the ground."</p>

  <p>Perrichet beamed all over his rosy face, and Besnard nodded at him with
  condescending approval.</p>

  <p>"But I wish, M. le Commissaire" &mdash; and Hanaud pointed to a blur of
  marks &mdash; "that your other officers had been as intelligent. Look! These
  run from the glass door to the drive, and, for all the use they are to us, a
  harrow might have been dragged across them."</p>

  <p>Besnard drew himself up.</p>

  <p>"Not one of my officers has entered the room by way of this door. The
  strictest orders were given and obeyed. The ground, as you see it, is the
  ground as it was at twelve o'clock last night."</p>

  <p>Hanaud's face grew thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he said, and he stooped to examine the second set of marks.
  They were at the righthand side of the door. "A woman and a man," he said.
  "But they are mere hints rather than prints. One might almost think&mdash;"
  He rose up without finishing his sentence, and he turned to the third set and
  a look of satisfaction gleamed upon his face. "Ah! here is something more
  interesting," he said.</p>

  <p>There were just three impressions; and, whereas the blurred marks were at
  the side, these three pointed straight from the middle of the glass doors to
  the drive. They were quite clearly defined, and all three were the
  impressions made by a woman's small, arched, high-heeled shoe. The position
  of the marks was at first sight a little peculiar. There was one a good yard
  from the window, the impression of the right foot, and the pressure of the
  sole of the shoe was more marked than that of the heel. The second, the
  impression of the left foot, was not quite so far from the first as the first
  was from the window, and here again the heel was the more lightly defined.
  But there was this difference &mdash; the mark of the toe, which was pointed
  in the first instance, was, in this, broader and a trifle blurred. Close
  beside it the right foot was again visible; only now the narrow heel was more
  clearly defined than the ball of the foot. It had, indeed, sunk half an inch
  into the soft ground. There were no further imprints. Indeed, these two were
  not merely close together, they were close to the gravel of the drive and on
  the very border of the grass.</p>

  <p>Hanaud looked at the marks thoughtfully. Then he turned to the
  Commissaire.</p>

  <p>"Are there any shoes in the house which fit those marks?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We have tried the shoes of all the women &mdash; Célie Harland, the
  maid, and even Mme. Dauvray. The only ones which fit at all are those taken
  from Célie Harland's bedroom."</p>

  <p>He called to an officer standing in the drive, and a pair of grey suede
  shoes were brought to him from the hall.</p>

  <p>"See, M. Hanaud, it is a pretty little foot which made those clear
  impressions," he said, with a smile; "a foot arched and slender. Mme.
  Dauvray's foot is short and square, the maid's broad and flat. Neither Mme.
  Dauvray nor Helène Vauquier could have worn these shoes. They were lying, one
  here, one there, upon the floor of Célie Harland's room, as though she had
  kicked them off in a hurry. They are almost new, you see. They have been worn
  once, perhaps, no more, and they fit with absolute precision into those
  footmarks, except just at the toe of that second one."</p>

  <p>Hanaud took the shoes and, kneeling down, placed them one after the other
  over the impressions. To Ricardo it was extraordinary how exactly they
  covered up the marks and filled the indentations.</p>

  <p>"I should say," said the Commissaire, "that Célie Harland went away
  wearing a new pair of shoes made on the very same last as those."</p>

  <p>As those she had left carelessly lying on the floor of her room for the
  first person to notice, thought Ricardo! It seemed as if the girl had gone
  out of her way to make the weight of evidence against her as heavy as
  possible. Yet, after all, it was just through inattention to the small
  details, so insignificant at the red moment of crime, so terribly instructive
  the next day, that guilt was generally brought home.</p>

  <p>Hanaud rose to his feet and handed the shoes back to the officer.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "so it seems. The shoemaker can help us here. I see the
  shoes were made in Aix."</p>

  <p>Besnard looked at the name stamped in gold letters upon the lining of the
  shoes.</p>

  <p>"I will have inquiries made," he said.</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded, took a measure from his pocket and measured the ground
  between the window and the first footstep, and between the first footstep and
  the other two.</p>

  <p>"How tall is Mlle. Célie?" he asked, and he addressed the question to
  Wethermill. It struck Ricardo as one of the strangest details in all this
  strange affair that the detective should ask with confidence for information
  which might help to bring Celia Harland to the guillotine from the man who
  had staked his happiness upon her innocence.</p>

  <p>"About five feet seven," he answered.</p>

  <p>Hanaud replaced his measure in his pocket. He turned with a grave face to
  Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"I warned you fairly, didn't I?" he said.</p>

  <p>Wethermill's white face twitched.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "I am not afraid." But there was more of anxiety in his
  voice than there had been before.</p>

  <p>Hanaud pointed solemnly to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Read the story those footprints write in the mould there. A young and
  active girl of about Mlle. Célie's height, and wearing a new pair of Mlle.
  Célie's shoes, springs from that room where the murder was committed, where
  the body of the murdered woman lies. She is running. She is wearing a long
  gown. At the second step the hem of the gown catches beneath the point of her
  shoe. She stumbles. To save herself from falling she brings up the other foot
  sharply and stamps the heel down into the ground. She recovers her balance.
  She steps on to the drive. It is true the gravel here is hard and takes no
  mark, but you will see that some of the mould which has clung to her shoes
  has dropped off. She mounts into the motor-car with the man and the other
  woman and drives off &mdash; some time between eleven and twelve."</p>

  <p>"Between eleven and twelve? Is that sure?" asked Besnard.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied Hanaud. "The gate is open at eleven, and Perrichet
  closes it. It is open again at twelve. Therefore the murderers had not gone
  before eleven. No; the gate was open for them to go, but they had not gone.
  Else why should the gate again be open at midnight?"</p>

  <p>Besnard nodded in assent, and suddenly Perrichet started forward, with his
  eyes full of horror.</p>

  <p>"Then, when I first closed the gate," he cried, "and came into the garden
  and up to the house they were here &mdash; in that room? Oh, my God!" He
  stared at the window, with his mouth open.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, my friend, that is so," said Hanaud gravely.</p>

  <p>"But I knocked upon the wooden door, I tried the bolts; and they were
  within &mdash; in the darkness within, holding their breath not three yards
  from me."</p>

  <p>He stood transfixed.</p>

  <p>"That we shall see," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>He stepped in Perrichet's footsteps to the sill of the room. He examined
  the green wooden doors which opened outwards, and the glass doors which
  opened inwards, taking a magnifying-glass from his pocket. He called Besnard
  to his side.</p>

  <p>"See!" he said, pointing to the woodwork.</p>

  <p>"Finger-marks!" asked Besnard eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes; of hands in gloves," returned Hanaud. "We shall learn nothing from
  these marks except that the assassins knew their trade."</p>

  <p>Then he stooped down to the sill, where some traces of steps were visible.
  He rose with a gesture of resignation.</p>

  <p>"Rubber shoes," he said, and so stepped into the room, followed by
  Wethermill and the others. They found themselves in a small recess which was
  panelled with wood painted white, and here and there delicately carved into
  festoons of flowers. The recess ended in an arch, supported by two slender
  pillars, and on the inner side of the arch thick curtains of pink silk were
  hung. These were drawn back carelessly, and through the opening between them
  the party looked down the length of the room beyond. They passed within.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5"><small>CHAPTER 5</small></a><br>
  <br>
  IN THE SALON</h2>

  <p class="first">Julius Ricardo pushed aside the curtains with a thrill of
  excitement. He found himself standing within a small oblong room which was
  prettily, even daintily, furnished. On his left, close by the recess, was a
  small fireplace with the ashes of a burnt-out fire in the grate. Beyond the
  grate a long settee covered in pink damask, with a crumpled cushion at each
  end, stood a foot or two away from the wall, and beyond the settee the door
  of the room opened into the hall. At the end a long mirror was let into the
  panelling, and a writing- table stood by the mirror. On the right were the
  three windows, and between the two nearest to Mr. Ricardo was the switch of
  the electric light. A chandelier hung from the ceiling, an electric lamp
  stood upon the writing-table, a couple of electric candles on the
  mantel-shelf. A round satinwood table stood under the windows, with three
  chairs about it, of which one was overturned, one was placed with its back to
  the electric switch, and the third on the opposite side facing it.</p>

  <p>Ricardo could hardly believe that he stood actually upon the spot where,
  within twelve hours, a cruel and sinister tragedy had taken place. There was
  so little disorder. The three windows on his right showed him the blue sunlit
  sky and a glimpse of flowers and trees; behind him the glass doors stood open
  to the lawn, where birds piped cheerfully and the trees murmured of summer.
  But he saw Hanaud stepping quickly from place to place, with an extraordinary
  lightness of step for so big a man, obviously engrossed, obviously reading
  here and there some detail, some custom of the inhabitants of that room.</p>

  <p>Ricardo leaned with careful artistry against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Now, what has this room to say to me?" he asked importantly. Nobody paid
  the slightest attention to his question, and it was just as well. For the
  room had very little information to give him. He ran his eye over the white
  Louis Seize furniture, the white panels of the wall, the polished floor, the
  pink curtains. Even the delicate tracery of the ceiling did not escape his
  scrutiny. Yet he saw nothing likely to help him but an overturned chair and a
  couple of crushed cushions on a settee. It was very annoying, all the more
  annoying because M. Hanaud was so uncommonly busy. Hanaud looked carefully at
  the long settee and the crumpled cushions, and he took out his measure and
  measured the distance between the cushion at one end and the cushion at the
  other. He examined the table, he measured the distance between the chairs. He
  came to the fireplace and raked in the ashes of the burnt-out fire. But
  Ricardo noticed a singular thing. In the midst of his search Hanaud's eyes
  were always straying back to the settee, and always with a look of extreme
  perplexity, as if he read there something, definitely something, but
  something which he could not explain. Finally he went back to it; he drew it
  farther away from the wall, and suddenly with a little cry he stooped and
  went down on his knees. When he rose he was holding some torn fragments of
  paper in his hand. He went over to the writing-table and opened the
  blotting-book. Where it fell open there were some sheets of note-paper, and
  one particular sheet of which half had been torn off. He compared the pieces
  which he held with that torn sheet, and seemed satisfied.</p>

  <p>There was a rack for note-paper upon the table, and from it he took a
  stiff card.</p>

  <p>"Get me some gum or paste, and quickly," he said. His voice had become
  brusque, the politeness had gone from his address. He carried the card and
  the fragments of paper to the round table. There he sat down and, with
  infinite patience, gummed the fragments on to the card, fitting them together
  like the pieces of a Chinese puzzle.</p>

  <p>The others over his shoulders could see spaced words, written in pencil,
  taking shape as a sentence upon the card. Hanaud turned abruptly in his seat
  toward Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"You have, no doubt, a letter written by Mlle. Célie?"</p>

  <p>Wethermill took his letter-case from his pocket and a letter out of the
  case. He hesitated for a moment as he glanced over what was written. The four
  sheets were covered. He folded back the letter, so that only the two inner
  sheets were visible, and handed it to Hanaud. Hanaud compared it with the
  handwriting upon the card.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said at length, and the three men gathered behind him. On the
  card the gummed fragments of paper revealed a sentence:</p>

  <p>"Je ne sais pas."</p>

  <p>"'I do not know,'" said Ricardo; "now this is very important."</p>

  <p>Beside the card Celia's letter to Wethermill was laid.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" asked Hanaud.</p>

  <p>Besnard, the Commissaire of Police, bent over Hanaud's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"There are strong resemblances," he said guardedly.</p>

  <p>Ricardo was on the look-out for deep mysteries. Resemblances were not
  enough for him; they were inadequate to the artistic needs of the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Both were written by the same hand," he said definitely; "only in the
  sentence written upon the card the handwriting is carefully disguised."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the Commissaire, bending forward again. "Here is an idea! Yes,
  yes, there are strong differences."</p>

  <p>Ricardo looked triumphant.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are differences," said Hanaud. "Look how long the up stroke of
  the 'p' is, how it wavers! See how suddenly this 's' straggles off, as though
  some emotion made the hand shake. Yet this," and touching Wethermill's letter
  he smiled ruefully, "this is where the emotion should have affected the pen."
  He looked up at Wethermill's face and then said quietly:</p>

  <p>"You have given us no opinion, monsieur. Yet your opinion should be the
  most valuable of all. Were these two papers written by the same hand?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," answered Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"And I, too," cried Hanaud, in a sudden exasperation, "je ne sais pas. I
  do not know. It may be her hand carelessly counterfeited. It may be her hand
  disguised. It may be simply that she wrote in a hurry with her gloves
  on."</p>

  <p>"It may have been written some time ago," said Mr. Ricardo, encouraged by
  his success to another suggestion.</p>

  <p>"No; that is the one thing it could not have been," said Hanaud. "Look
  round the room. Was there ever a room better tended? Find me a little pile of
  dust in any one corner if you can! It is all as clean as a plate. Every
  morning, except this one morning, this room has been swept and polished. The
  paper was written and torn up yesterday."</p>

  <p>He enclosed the card in an envelope as he spoke, and placed it in his
  pocket. Then he rose and crossed again to the settee. He stood at the side of
  it, with his hands clutching the lapels of his coat and his face gravely
  troubled. After a few moments of silence for himself, of suspense for all the
  others who watched him, he stooped suddenly. Slowly, and with extraordinary
  care, he pushed his hands under the head-cushion and lifted it up gently, so
  that the indentations of its surface might not be disarranged. He carried it
  over to the light of the open window. The cushion was covered with silk, and
  as he held it to the sunlight all could see a small brown stain.</p>

  <p>Hanaud took his magnifying-glass from his pocket and bent his head over
  the cushion. But at that moment, careful though he had been, the down swelled
  up within the cushion, the folds and indentations disappeared, the silk
  covering was stretched smooth.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Besnard tragically. "What have you done?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud's face flushed. He had been guilty of a clumsiness &mdash; even
  he.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo took up the tale.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he exclaimed, "what have you done?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud looked at Ricardo in amazement at his audacity.</p>

  <p>"Well, what have I done?" he asked. "Come! tell me!"</p>

  <p>"You have destroyed a clue," replied Ricardo impressively.</p>

  <p>The deepest dejection at once overspread Hanaud's burly face.</p>

  <p>"Don't say that, M. Ricardo, I beseech you!" he implored. "A clue! and I
  have destroyed it! But what kind of a clue? And how have I destroyed it? And
  to what mystery would it be a clue if I hadn't destroyed it? And what will
  become of me when I go back to Paris, and say in the Rue de Jérusalem, 'Let
  me sweep the cellars, my good friends, for M. Ricardo knows that I destroyed
  a clue. Faithfully he promised me that he would not open his mouth, but I
  destroyed a clue, and his perspicacity forced him into speech.'"</p>

  <p>It was the turn of M. Ricardo to grow red.</p>

  <p>Hanaud turned with a smile to Besnard.</p>

  <p>"It does not really matter whether the creases in this cushion remain," he
  said, "we have all seen them." And he replaced the glass in his pocket.</p>

  <p>He carried that cushion back and replaced it. Then he took the other,
  which lay at the foot of the settee, and carried it in its turn to the
  window. This was indented too, and ridged up, and just at the marks the nap
  of the silk was worn, and there was a slit where it had been cut. The
  perplexity upon Hanaud's face greatly increased. He stood with the cushion in
  his hands, no longer looking at it, but looking out through the doors at the
  footsteps so clearly defined &mdash; the foot-steps of a girl who had run
  from this room and sprung into a motor-car and driven away. He shook his
  head, and, carrying back the cushion, laid it carefully down. Then he stood
  erect, gazed about the room as though even yet he might force its secrets out
  from its silence, and cried, with a sudden violence:</p>

  <p>"There is something here, gentlemen, which I do not understand."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo heard some one beside him draw a deep breath, and turned.
  Wethermill stood at his elbow. A faint colour had come back to his cheeks,
  his eyes were fixed intently upon Hanaud's face.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" he asked; and Hanaud replied brusquely:</p>

  <p>"It's not my business to hold opinions, monsieur; my business is to make
  sure."</p>

  <p>There was one point, and only one, of which he had made every one in that
  room sure. He had started confident. Here was a sordid crime, easily
  understood. But in that room he had read something which had troubled him,
  which had raised the sordid crime on to some higher and perplexing level.</p>

  <p>"Then M. Fleuriot after all might be right?" asked the Commissaire
  timidly.</p>

  <p>Hanaud stared at him for a second, then smiled.</p>

  <p>"L'affaire Dreyfus?" he cried. "Oh la, la, la! No, but there is something
  else."</p>

  <p>What was that something? Ricardo asked himself. He looked once more about
  the room. He did not find his answer, but he caught sight of an ornament upon
  the wall which drove the question from his mind. The ornament, if so it could
  be called, was a painted tambourine with a bunch of bright ribbons tied to
  the rim; and it was hung upon the wall between the settee and the fireplace
  at about the height of a man's head. Of course it might be no more than it
  seemed to be &mdash; a rather gaudy and vulgar toy, such as a woman like Mme.
  Dauvray would be very likely to choose in order to dress her walls. But it
  swept Ricardo's thoughts back of a sudden to the concert-hall at Leamington
  and the apparatus of a spiritualistic show. After all, he reflected
  triumphantly, Hanaud had not noticed everything, and as he made the
  reflection Hanaud's voice broke in to corroborate him.</p>

  <p>"We have seen everything here; let us go upstairs," he said. "We will
  first visit the room of Mlle. Célie. Then we will question the maid, Helène
  Vauquier."</p>

  <p>The four men, followed by Perrichet, passed out by the door into the hall
  and mounted the stairs. Celia's room was in the southwest angle of the villa,
  a bright and airy room, of which one window overlooked the road, and two
  others, between which stood the dressing-table, the garden. Behind the room a
  door led into a little white-tiled bathroom. Some towels were tumbled upon
  the floor beside the bath. In the bedroom a dark-grey frock of tussore and a
  petticoat were flung carelessly on the bed; a big grey hat of Ottoman silk
  was lying upon a chest of drawers in the recess of a window; and upon a chair
  a little pile of fine linen and a pair of grey silk stockings, which matched
  in shade the grey suede shoes, were tossed in a heap.</p>

  <p>"It was here that you saw the light at half-past nine?" Hanaud said,
  turning to Perrichet.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur," replied Perrichet.</p>

  <p>"We may assume, then, that Mlle. Célie was changing her dress at that
  time."</p>

  <p>Besnard was looking about him, opening a drawer here, a wardrobe
  there.</p>

  <p>"Mlle. Célie," he said, with a laugh, "was a particular young lady, and
  fond of her fine clothes, if one may judge from the room and the order of the
  cupboards. She must have changed her dress last night in an unusual
  hurry."</p>

  <p>There was about the whole room a certain daintiness, almost, it seemed to
  Mr. Ricardo, a fragrance, as though the girl had impressed something of her
  own delicate self upon it. Wethermill stood upon the threshold watching with
  a sullen face the violation of this chamber by the officers of the
  police.</p>

  <p>No such feelings, however, troubled Hanaud. He went over to the dressing-
  room and opened a few small leather cases which held Celia's ornaments. In
  one or two of them a trinket was visible; others were empty. One of these
  latter Hanaud held open in his hand, and for so long that Besnard moved
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"You see it is empty, monsieur," he said, and suddenly Wethermill moved
  forward into the room.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that," said Hanaud dryly.</p>

  <p>It was a case made to hold a couple of long ear-drops &mdash; those
  diamond ear-drops, doubtless, which Mr. Ricardo had seen twinkling in the
  garden.</p>

  <p>"Will monsieur let me see?" asked Wethermill, and he took the case in his
  hands. "Yes," he said. "Mlle. Célie's ear-drops," and he handed the case back
  with a thoughtful air.</p>

  <p>It was the first time he had taken a definite part in the investigation.
  To Ricardo the reason was clear. Harry Wethermill had himself given those
  ear- drops to Celia. Hanaud replaced the case and turned round.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing more for us to see here," he said. "I suppose that no
  one has been allowed to enter the room?" And he opened the door.</p>

  <p>"No one except Helène Vauquier," replied the Commissaire.</p>

  <p>Ricardo felt indignant at so obvious a piece of carelessness. Even
  Wethermill looked surprised. Hanaud merely shut the door again.</p>

  <p>"Oho, the maid!" he said. "Then she has recovered!"</p>

  <p>"She is still weak," said the Commissaire. "But I thought it was necessary
  that we should obtain at once a description of what Célie Harland wore when
  she left the house. I spoke to M. Fleuriot about it, and he gave me
  permission to bring Helène Vauquier here, who alone could tell us. I brought
  her here myself just before you came. She looked through the girl's wardrobe
  to see what was missing."</p>

  <p>"Was she alone in the room?"</p>

  <p>"Not for a moment," said M. Besnard haughtily. "Really, monsieur, we are
  not so ignorant of how an affair of this kind should be conducted. I was in
  the room myself the whole time, with my eye upon her."</p>

  <p>"That was just before I came," said Hanaud. He crossed carelessly to the
  open window which overlooked the road and, leaning out of it, looked up the
  road to the corner round which he and his friends had come, precisely as the
  Commissaire had done. Then he turned back into the room.</p>

  <p>"Which was the last cupboard or drawer that Helène Vauquier touched?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"This one."</p>

  <p>Besnard stooped and pulled open the bottom drawer of a chest which stood
  in the embrasure of the window. A light-coloured dress was lying at the
  bottom.</p>

  <p>"I told her to be quick," said Besnard, "since I had seen that you were
  coming. She lifted this dress out and said that nothing was missing there. So
  I took her back to her room and left her with the nurse."</p>

  <p>Hanaud lifted the light dress from the drawer, shook it out in front of
  the window, twirled it round, snatched up a corner of it and held it to his
  eyes, and then, folding it quickly, replaced it in the drawer.</p>

  <p>"Now show me the first drawer she touched." And this time he lifted out a
  petticoat, and, taking it to the window, examined it with a greater care.
  When he had finished with it he handed it to Ricardo to put away, and stood
  for a moment or two thoughtful and absorbed. Ricardo in his turn examined the
  petticoat. But he could see nothing unusual. It was an attractive petticoat,
  dainty with frills and lace, but it was hardly a thing to grow thoughtful
  over. He looked up in perplexity and saw that Hanaud was watching his
  investigations with a smile of amusement.</p>

  <p>"When M. Ricardo has put that away," he said, "we will hear what Helène
  Vauquier has to tell us."</p>

  <p>He passed out of the door last, and, locking it, placed the key in his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Helène Vauquier's room is, I think, upstairs," he said. And he moved
  towards the staircase.</p>

  <p>But as he did so a man in plain clothes, who had been waiting upon the
  landing, stepped forward. He carried in his hand a piece of thin, strong
  whipcord.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Durette!" cried Besnard. "Monsieur Hanaud, I sent Durette this
  morning round the shops of Aix with the cord which was found knotted round
  Mme. Dauvray's neck."</p>

  <p>Hanaud advanced quickly to the man.</p>

  <p>"Well! Did you discover anything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur," said Durette. "At the shop of M. Corval, in the Rue du
  Casino, a young lady in a dark-grey frock and hat bought some cord of this
  kind at a few minutes after nine last night. It was just as the shop was
  being closed. I showed Corval the photograph of Célie Harland which M. le
  Commissaire gave me out of Mme. Dauvray's room, and he identified it as the
  portrait of the girl who had bought the cord."</p>

  <p>Complete silence followed upon Durette's words. The whole party stood like
  men stupefied. No one looked towards Wethermill; even Hanaud averted his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is very important," he said awkwardly. He turned away and,
  followed by the others, went up the stairs to the bedroom of Helène
  Vauquier.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6"><small>CHAPTER 6</small></a><br>
  <br>
  HELÈNE VAUQUIER'S EVIDENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">A nurse opened the door. Within the room Helène Vauquier was
  leaning back in a chair. She looked ill, and her face was very white. On the
  appearance of Hanaud, the Commissaire, and the others, however, she rose to
  her feet. Ricardo recognised the justice of Hanaud's description. She stood
  before them a hard-featured, tall woman of thirty-five or forty, in a neat
  black stuff dress, strong with the strength of a peasant, respectable,
  reliable. She looked what she had been, the confidential maid of an elderly
  woman. On her face there was now an aspect of eager appeal.</p>

  <p>"Oh, monsieur!" she began, "let me go from here &mdash; anywhere &mdash;
  into prison if you like. But to stay here &mdash; where in years past we were
  so happy &mdash; and with madame lying in the room below. No, it is
  insupportable."</p>

  <p>She sank into her chair, and Hanaud came over to her side.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said, in a soothing voice. "I can understand your feelings,
  my poor woman. We will not keep you here. You have, perhaps, friends in Aix
  with whom you could stay?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, monsieur!" Helène cried gratefully. "Oh, but I thank you! That I
  should have to sleep here tonight! Oh, how the fear of that has frightened
  me!"</p>

  <p>"You need have had no such fear. After all, we are not the visitors of
  last night," said Hanaud, drawing a chair close to her and patting her hand
  sympathetically. "Now, I want you to tell these gentlemen and myself all that
  you know of this dreadful business. Take your time, mademoiselle! We are
  human."</p>

  <p>"But, monsieur, I know nothing," she cried. "I was told that I might go to
  bed as soon as I had dressed Mlle. Célie for the séance."</p>

  <p>"Séance!" cried Ricardo, startled into speech. The picture of the Assembly
  Hall at Leamington was again before his mind. But Hanaud turned towards him,
  and, though Hanaud's face retained its benevolent expression, there was a
  glitter in his eyes which sent the blood into Ricardo's face.</p>

  <p>"Did you speak again, M. Ricardo?" the detective asked. "No? I thought it
  was not possible." He turned back to Helène Vauquier. "So Mlle. Célie
  practised séances. That is very strange. We will hear about them. Who knows
  what thread may lead us to the truth?"</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, it is not right that you should seek the truth from me. For,
  consider this! I cannot speak with justice of Mlle. Célie. No, I cannot! I
  did not like her. I was jealous &mdash; yes, jealous, Monsieur, you want the
  truth &mdash; I hated her!" And the woman's face flushed and she clenched her
  hand upon the arm of her chair. "Yes, I hated her. How could I help it?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Hanaud gently. "Why could you not help it?"</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier leaned back again, her strength exhausted, and smiled
  languidly.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you. But remember it is a woman speaking to you, and things
  which you will count silly and trivial mean very much to her. There was one
  night last June &mdash; only last June! To think of it! So little while ago
  there was no Mlle. Célie&mdash;" and, as Hanaud raised his hand, she said
  hurriedly, "Yes, yes; I will control myself. But to think of Mme. Dauvray
  now!"</p>

  <p>And thereupon she blurted out her story and explained to Mr. Ricardo the
  question which had so perplexed him: how a girl of so much distinction as
  Celia Harland came to be living with a woman of so common a type as Mme.
  Dauvray.</p>

  <p>"Well, one night in June," said Helène Vauquier, "madame went with a party
  to supper at the Abbaye Restaurant in Montmartre. And she brought home for
  the first time Mlle. Célie. But you should have seen her! She had on a little
  plaid skirt and a coat which was falling to pieces, and she was starving
  &mdash; yes, starving. Madame told me the story that night as I undressed
  her. Mlle. Célie was there dancing amidst the tables for a supper with any
  one who would be kind enough to dance with her."</p>

  <p>The scorn of her voice rang through the room. She was the rigid,
  respectable peasant woman, speaking out her contempt. And Wethermill must
  needs listen to it. Ricardo dared not glance at him.</p>

  <p>"But hardly any one would dance with her in her rags, and no one would
  give her supper except madame. Madame did. Madame listened to her story of
  hunger and distress. Madame believed it, and brought her home. Madame was so
  kind, so careless in her kindness. And now she lies murdered for a reward!"
  An hysterical sob checked the woman's utterances, her face began to work, her
  hands to twitch.</p>

  <p>"Come, come!" said Hanaud gently, "calm yourself, mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier paused for a moment or two to recover her composure. "I
  beg your pardon, monsieur, but I have been so long with madame &mdash; oh,
  the poor woman! Yes, yes, I will calm myself. Well, madame brought her home,
  and in a week there was nothing too good for Mlle. Célie. Madame was like a
  child. Always she was being deceived and imposed upon. Never she learnt
  prudence. But no one so quickly made her way to madame's heart as Mlle.
  Célie. Mademoiselle must live with her. Mademoiselle must be dressed by the
  first modistes. Mademoiselle must have lace petticoats and the softest linen,
  long white gloves, and pretty ribbons for her hair, and hats from Caroline
  Reboux at twelve hundred francs. And madame's maid must attend upon her and
  deck her out in all these dainty things. Bah!"</p>

  <p>Vauquier was sitting erect in her chair, violent, almost rancorous with
  anger. She looked round upon the company and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I told you not to come to me!" she said, "I cannot speak impartially, or
  even gently of mademoiselle. Consider! For years I had been more than
  madame's maid &mdash; her friend; yes, so she was kind enough to call me. She
  talked to me about everything, consulted me about everything, took me with
  her everywhere. Then she brings home, at two o'clock in the morning, a young
  girl with a fresh, pretty face, from a Montmartre restaurant, and in a week I
  am nothing at all &mdash; oh, but nothing &mdash; and mademoiselle is
  queen."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is quite natural," said Hanaud sympathetically. "You would not
  have been human, mademoiselle, if you had not felt some anger. But tell us
  frankly about these séances. How did they begin?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, monsieur," Vauquier answered, "it was not difficult to begin them.
  Mme. Dauvray had a passion for fortune-tellers and rogues of that kind. Any
  one with a pack of cards and some nonsense about a dangerous woman with black
  hair or a man with a limp &mdash; Monsieur knows the stories they string
  together in dimly lighted rooms to deceive the credulous &mdash; any one
  could make a harvest out of madame's superstitions. But monsieur knows the
  type."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do," said Hanaud, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Well, after mademoiselle had been with us three weeks, she said to me one
  morning when I was dressing her hair that it was a pity madame was always
  running round the fortune-tellers, that she herself could do something much
  more striking and impressive, and that if only I would help her we could
  rescue madame from their clutches. Sir, I did not think what power I was
  putting into Mlle. Célie's hands, or assuredly I would have refused. And I
  did not wish to quarrel with Mlle. Célie; so for once I consented, and,
  having once consented, I could never afterwards refuse, for, if I had,
  mademoiselle would have made some fine excuse about the psychic influence not
  being en rapport, and meanwhile would have had me sent away. While if I had
  confessed the truth to madame, she would have been so angry that I had been a
  party to tricking her that again I would have lost my place. And so the
  séances went on."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hanaud. "I understand that your position was very difficult.
  We shall not, I think," and he turned to the Commissaire confidently for
  corroboration of his words, "be disposed to blame you."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said the Commissaire. "After all, life is not so
  easy."</p>

  <p>"Thus, then, the séances began," said Hanaud, leaning forward with a keen
  interest. "This is a strange and curious story you are telling me, Mlle.
  Vauquier. Now, how were they conducted? How did you assist? What did Mlle.
  Célie do? Rap on the tables in the dark and rattle tambourines like that one
  with the knot of ribbons which hangs upon the wall of the salon?"</p>

  <p>There was a gentle and inviting irony in Hanaud's tone. M. Ricardo was
  disappointed. Hanaud had after all not overlooked the tambourine. Without
  Ricardo's reason to notice it, he had none the less observed it and borne it
  in his memory.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, monsieur, the tambourines and the rapping on the table!" cried
  Helène. "That was nothing &mdash; oh, but nothing at all. Mademoiselle Célie
  would make spirits appear and speak!"</p>

  <p>"Really! And she was never caught out! But Mlle. Célie must have been a
  remarkably clever girl."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she was of an address which was surprising. Sometimes madame and I
  were alone. Sometimes there were others, whom madame in her pride had
  invited. For she was very proud, monsieur, that her companion could introduce
  her to the spirits of dead people. But never was Mlle. Célie caught out. She
  told me that for many years, even when quite a child, she had travelled
  through England giving these exhibitions."</p>

  <p>"Oho!" said Hanaud, and he turned to Wethermill. "Did you know that?" he
  asked in English.</p>

  <p>"I did not," he said. "I do not now."</p>

  <p>Hanaud shook his head.</p>

  <p>"To me this story does not seem invented," he replied. And then he spoke
  again in French to Helène Vauquier. "Well, continue, mademoiselle! Assume
  that the company is assembled for our séance."</p>

  <p>"Then Mlle. Célie, dressed in a long gown of black velvet, which set off
  her white arms and shoulders well &mdash; oh, mademoiselle did not forget
  those little trifles," Helène Vauquier interrupted her story, with a return
  of her bitterness, to interpolate &mdash; "mademoiselle would sail into the
  room with her velvet train flowing behind her, and perhaps for a little while
  she would say there was a force working against her, and she would sit silent
  in a chair while madame gaped at her with open eyes. At last mademoiselle
  would say that the powers were favourable and the spirits would manifest
  themselves to night. Then she would be placed in a cabinet, perhaps with a
  string tied across the door outside &mdash; you will understand it was my
  business to see after the string &mdash; and the lights would be turned down,
  or perhaps out altogether. Or at other times we would sit holding hands round
  a table, Mlle. Célie between Mme. Dauvray and myself. But in that case the
  lights would be turned out first, and it would be really my hand which held
  Mme. Dauvray's. And whether it was the cabinet or the chairs, in a moment
  mademoiselle would be creeping silently about the room in a little pair of
  soft- soled slippers without heels, which she wore so that she might not be
  heard, and tambourines would rattle as you say, and fingers touch the
  forehead and the neck, and strange voices would sound from corners of the
  room, and dim apparitions would appear &mdash; the spirits of great ladies of
  the past, who would talk with Mme. Dauvray. Such ladies as Mme. de
  Castiglione, Marie Antoinette, Mme. de Medici &mdash; I do not remember all
  the names, and very likely I do not pronounce them properly. Then the voices
  would cease and the lights be turned up, and Mlle. Célie would be found in a
  trance just in the same place and attitude as she had been when the lights
  were turned out. Imagine, messieurs, the effect of such séances upon a woman
  like Mme. Dauvray. She was made for them. She believed in them implicitly.
  The words of the great ladies from the past &mdash; she would remember and
  repeat them, and be very proud that such great ladies had come back to the
  world merely to tell her &mdash; Mme. Dauvray &mdash; about their lives. She
  would have had séances all day, but Mlle. Célie pleaded that she was left
  exhausted at the end of them. But Mlle. Célie was of an address! For instance
  &mdash; it will seem very absurd and ridiculous to you, gentlemen, but you
  must remember what Mme. Dauvray was &mdash; for instance, madame was
  particularly anxious to speak with the spirit of Mme. de Montespan. Yes, yes!
  She had read all the memoirs about that lady. Very likely Mlle. Célie had put
  the notion into Mme. Dauvray's head, for madame was not a scholar. But she
  was dying to hear that famous woman's voice and to catch a dim glimpse of her
  face. Well, she was never gratified. Always she hoped. Always Mlle. Célie
  tantalised her with the hope. But she would not gratify it. She would not
  spoil her fine affairs by making these treats too common. And she acquired
  &mdash; how should she not? &mdash; a power over Mme. Dauvray which was
  unassailable. The fortune-tellers had no more to say to Mme. Dauvray. She did
  nothing but felicitate herself upon the happy chance which had sent her Mlle.
  Célie. And now she lies in her room murdered!"</p>

  <p>Once more Helène's voice broke upon the words. But Hanaud poured her out a
  glass of water and held it to her lips. Helène drank it eagerly.</p>

  <p>"There, that is better, is it not?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur," said Helène Vauquier, recovering herself. "Sometimes,
  too," she resumed, "messages from the spirits would flutter down in writing
  on the table."</p>

  <p>"In writing?" exclaimed Hanaud quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes; answers to questions. Mlle. Célie had them ready. Oh, but she was of
  an address altogether surprising.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Hanaud slowly; and he added, "But sometimes, I suppose, the
  questions were questions which Mlle. Célie could not answer?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," Helène Vauquier admitted, "when visitors were present. When
  Mme. Dauvray was alone &mdash; well, she was an ignorant woman, and any
  answer would serve. But it was not so when there were visitors whom Mlle.
  Célie did not know, or only knew slightly. These visitors might be putting
  questions to test her, of which they knew the answers, while Mlle. Célie did
  not."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Hanaud. "What happened then?"</p>

  <p>All who were listening understood to what point he was leading Helène
  Vauquier. All waited intently for her answer.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"It was all one to Mlle. Célie."</p>

  <p>"She was prepared with an escape from the difficulty?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly prepared."</p>

  <p>Hanaud looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I can think of no way out of it except the one," and he looked round to
  the Commissaire and to Ricardo as though he would inquire of them how many
  ways they had discovered. "I can think of no escape except that a message in
  writing should flutter down from the spirit appealed to saying frankly," and
  Hanaud shrugged his shoulders, "'I do not know.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh no no, monsieur," replied Helène Vauquier in pity for Hanaud's
  misconception, "I see that you are not in the habit of attending séances. It
  would never do for a spirit to admit that it did not know. At once its
  authority would be gone, and with it Mlle. Célie's as well. But on the other
  hand, for inscrutable reasons the spirit might not be allowed to answer."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Hanaud, meekly accepting the correction. "The spirit
  might reply that it was forbidden to answer, but never that it did not
  know."</p>

  <p>"No, never that," [agreed] Helène. So it seemed that Hanaud must look
  elsewhere for the explanation of that sentence. "I do not know." Helène
  continued: "Oh, Mlle. Célie &mdash; it was not easy to baffle her, I can tell
  you. She carried a lace scarf which she could drape about her head, and in a
  moment she would be, in the dim light, an old, old woman, with a voice so
  altered that no one could know it. Indeed, you said rightly, monsieur &mdash;
  she was clever."</p>

  <p>To all who listened Helène Vauquier's story carried its conviction. Mme.
  Dauvray rose vividly before their minds as a living woman. Célie's trickeries
  were so glibly described that they could hardly have been invented, and
  certainly not by this poor peasant-woman whose lips so bravely struggled with
  Medici, and Montespan, and the names of the other great ladies. How, indeed,
  should she know of them at all? She could never have had the inspiration to
  concoct the most convincing item of her story &mdash; the queer craze of Mme.
  Dauvray for an interview with Mme. de Montespan. These details were assuredly
  the truth.</p>

  <p>Ricardo, indeed, knew them to be true. Had he not himself seen the girl in
  her black velvet dress shut up in a cabinet, and a great lady of the past
  dimly appear in the darkness? Moreover, Helène Vauquier's jealousy was so
  natural and inevitable a thing. Her confession of it corroborated all her
  story.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said Hanaud, "we come to last night. There was a séance held
  in the salon last night."</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur," said Vauquier, shaking her head; "there was no séance last
  night."</p>

  <p>"But already you have said&mdash;" interrupted the Commissaire; and Hanaud
  held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"Let her speak, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur shall hear," said Vauquier.</p>

  <p>It appeared that at five o'clock in the afternoon Mme. Dauvray and Mlle.
  Célie prepared to leave the house on foot. It was their custom to walk down
  at this hour to the Villa des Fleurs, pass an hour or so there, dine in a
  restaurant, and return to the Rooms to spend the evening. On this occasion,
  however, Mme. Dauvray informed Helène that they should be back early and
  bring with them a friend who was interested in, but entirely sceptical of,
  spiritualistic manifestations. "But we shall convince her tonight, Célie,
  "she said confidently; and the two women then went out. Shortly before eight
  Helène closed the shutters both of the upstair and the downstair windows and
  of the glass doors into the garden, and returned to the kitchen, which was at
  the back of the house &mdash; that is, on the side facing the road. There had
  been a fall of rain at seven which had lasted for the greater part of the
  hour, and soon after she had shut the windows the rain fell again in a heavy
  shower, and Helène, knowing that madame felt the chill, lighted a small fire
  in the salon. The shower lasted until nearly nine, when it ceased altogether
  and the night cleared up.</p>

  <p>It was close upon half-past nine when the bell rang from the salon.
  Vauquier was sure of the hour, for the charwoman called her attention to the
  clock.</p>

  <p>"I found Mme. Dauvray, Mlle Célie, and another woman in the salon,"
  continued Helène Vauquier.</p>

  <p>"Madame had let them in with her latchkey."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the other woman!" cried Besnard. "Had you seen her before?"</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"What was she like?"</p>

  <p>"She was sallow, with black hair and bright eyes like beads. She was short
  and about forty-five years old, though it is difficult to judge of these
  things. I noticed her hands, for she was taking her gloves off, and they
  seemed to me to be unusually muscular for a woman."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Louis Besnard. "That is important."</p>

  <p>"Mme. Dauvray was, as she always was before a séance, in a feverish
  flutter. 'You will help Mlle. Célie to dress, Helène, and be very quick,' she
  said; and with an extraordinary longing she added, 'Perhaps we shall see her
  tonight.' Her, you understand, was Mme. de Montespan. And she turned to the
  stranger and said, "You will believe, Adele, after tonight."</p>

  <p>"Adele!" said the Commissaire wisely. "Then Adele was the strange woman's
  name?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Hanaud dryly.</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier reflected.</p>

  <p>"I think Adele was the name," she said in a more doubtful tone. "It
  sounded like Adele."</p>

  <p>The irrepressible Mr. Ricardo was impelled to intervene.</p>

  <p>"What Monsieur Hanaud means," he explained, with the pleasant air of a man
  happy to illuminate the dark intelligence of a child, "is that Adele was
  probably a pseudonym."</p>

  <p>Hanaud turned to him with a savage grin.</p>

  <p>"Now that is sure to help her!" he cried. "A pseudonym! Helène Vauquier is
  sure to understand that simple and elementary word. How bright this M.
  Ricardo is! Where shall we find a new pin more bright? I ask you," and he
  spread out his hands in a despairing admiration.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo flushed red, but he answered never a word. He must endure
  gibes and humiliations like a schoolboy in a class. His one constant fear was
  lest he should be turned out of the room. The Commissaire diverted wrath from
  him however.</p>

  <p>"What he means by pseudonym," he said to Helène Vauquier, explaining Mr.
  Ricardo to her as Mr. Ricardo had presumed to explain Hanaud, "is a false
  name. Adele may have been, nay, probably was, a false name adopted by this
  strange woman."</p>

  <p>"Adele, I think, was the name used," replied Helène, the doubt in her
  voice diminishing as she searched her memory. "I am almost sure."</p>

  <p>"Well, we will call her Adele," said Hanaud impatiently. "What does it
  matter? Go on, Mademoiselle Vauquier."</p>

  <p>"The lady sat upright and squarely upon the edge of a chair, with a sort
  of defiance, as though she was determined nothing should convince her, and
  she laughed incredulously."</p>

  <p>Here, again, all who heard were able vividly to conjure up the scene
  &mdash; the defiant sceptic sitting squarely on the edge of her chair,
  removing her gloves from her muscular hands; the excited Mme. Dauvray, so
  absorbed in the determination to convince; and Mlle. Célie running from the
  room to put on the black gown which would not be visible in the dim
  light.</p>

  <p>"Whilst I took off mademoiselle's dress," Vauquier continued, "she said:
  'When I have gone down to the salon you can go to bed, Helène. Mme. Adele'
  &mdash; yes, it was Adele &mdash; 'will be fetched by a friend in a motorcar,
  and I can let her out and fasten the door again. So if you hear the car you
  will know that it has come for her.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she said that!" said Hanaud quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

  <p>Hanaud looked gloomily towards Wethermill. Then he exchanged a sharp
  glance with the Commissaire, and moved his shoulders in an almost
  imperceptible shrug. But Mr. Ricardo saw it, and construed it into one word.
  He imagined a jury uttering the word "Guilty."</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier saw the movement too.</p>

  <p>"Do not condemn her too quickly, monsieur," she, said, with an impulse of
  remorse. "And not upon my words. For, as I say, I &mdash; hated her."</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded reassuringly, and she resumed:</p>

  <p>"I was surprised, and I asked mademoiselle what she would do without her
  confederate. But she laughed, and said there would be no difficulty. That is
  partly why I think there was no séance held last night. Monsieur, there was a
  note in her voice that evening which I did not as yet understand.
  Mademoiselle then took her bath while I laid out her black dress and the
  slippers with the soft, noiseless soles. And now I tell you why I am sure
  there was no séance last night &mdash; why Mlle. Célie never meant there
  should be one."</p>

  <p>"Yes, let us hear that," said Hanaud curiously, and leaning forward with
  his hands upon his knees.</p>

  <p>"You have here, monsieur, a description of how mademoiselle was dressed
  when she went away." Helène Vauquier picked up a sheet of paper from the
  table at her side. "I wrote it out at the request of M. le Commissaire." She
  handed the paper to Hanaud, who glanced through it as she continued. "Well,
  except for the white lace coat, monsieur, I dressed Mlle. Célie just in that
  way. She would have none of her plain black robe. No, Mlle. Célie must wear
  her fine new evening frock of pale reseda-green chiffon over soft clinging
  satin, which set off her fair beauty so prettily. It left her white arms and
  shoulders bare, and it had a long train, and it rustled as she moved. And
  with that she must put on her pale green silk stockings, her new little satin
  slippers to match, with the large paste buckles &mdash; and a sash of green
  satin looped through another glittering buckle at the side of the waist, with
  long ends loosely knotted together at the knee. I must tie her fair hair with
  a silver ribbon, and pin upon her curls a large hat of reseda green with a
  golden-brown ostrich feather drooping behind. I warned mademoiselle that
  there was a tiny fire burning in the salon. Even with the fire-screen in
  front of it there would still be a little light upon the floor, and the
  glittering buckles on her feet would betray her, even if the rustle of her
  dress did not. But she said she would kick her slippers off. Ah, gentlemen,
  it is, after all, not so that one dresses for a séance," she cried, shaking
  her head. "But it is just so &mdash; is it not? &mdash; that one dresses to
  go to meet a lover."</p>

  <p>The suggestion startled every one who heard it. It fairly took Mr.
  Ricardo's breath away. Wethermill stepped forward with a cry of revolt. The
  Commissaire exclaimed, admiringly, "But here is an idea!" Even Hanaud sat
  back in his chair, though his expression lost nothing of its impassivity, and
  his eyes never moved from Helène Vauquier's face.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" she continued, "I will tell you what I think. It was my habit to
  put out some sirop and lemonade and some little cakes in the dining-room,
  which, as you know, is at the other side of the house across the hall. I
  think it possible, messieurs, that while Mlle. Célie was changing her dress
  Mme. Dauvray and the stranger, Adele, went into the dining-room. I know that
  Mlle. Célie, as soon as she was dressed, ran downstairs to the salon. Well,
  then, suppose Mlle. Célie had a lover waiting with whom she meant to run
  away. She hurries through the empty salon, opens the glass doors, and is
  gone, leaving the doors open. And the thief, an accomplice of Adele, finds
  the doors open and hides himself in the salon until Mme. Dauvray returns from
  the dining-room. You see, that leaves Mlle. Célie innocent."</p>

  <p>Vauquier leaned forward eagerly, her white face flushing. There was a
  moment's silence, and then Hanaud said:</p>

  <p>"That is all very well, Mlle. Vauquier. But it does not account for the
  lace coat in which the girl went away. She must have returned to her room to
  fetch that after you had gone to bed."</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier leaned back with an air of disappointment.</p>

  <p>"That is true. I had forgotten the coat. I did not like Mlle. Célie, but I
  am not wicked&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nor for the fact that the sirop and the lemonade had not been touched in
  the dining-room," said the Commissaire, interrupting her.</p>

  <p>Again the disappointment overspread Vauquier's face.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" she asked. "I did not know &mdash; I have been kept a
  prisoner here."</p>

  <p>The Commissaire cut her short with a cry of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Listen! listen!" he exclaimed excitedly. "Here is a theory which accounts
  for all, which combines Vauquier's idea with ours, and Vauquier's idea is, I
  think, very just, up to a point. Suppose, M. Hanaud, that the girl was going
  to meet her lover, but the lover is the murderer. Then all becomes clear. She
  does not run away to him; she opens the door for him and lets him in."</p>

  <p>Both Hanaud and Ricardo stole a glance at Wethermill. How did he take the
  theory? Wethermill was leaning against the wall, his eyes closed, his face
  white and contorted with a spasm of pain. But he had the air of a man
  silently enduring an outrage rather than struck down by the conviction that
  the woman he loved was worthless.</p>

  <p>"It is not for me to say, monsieur," Helène Vauquier continued. "I only
  tell you what I know. I am a woman, and it would be very difficult for a girl
  who was eagerly expecting her lover so to act that another woman would not
  know it. However uncultivated and ignorant the other woman was, that at all
  events she would know. The knowledge would spread to her of itself, without a
  word. Consider, gentlemen!" And suddenly Helène Vauquier smiled. "A young
  girl tingling with excitement from head to foot, eager that her beauty just
  at this moment should be more fresh, more sweet than ever it was, careful
  that her dress should set it exquisitely off. Imagine it! Her lips ready for
  the kiss! Oh, how should another woman not know? I saw Mlle. Célie, her
  cheeks rosy, her eyes bright. Never had she looked so lovely. The pale-green
  hat upon her fair head heavy with its curls! From head to foot she looked
  herself over, and then she sighed &mdash; she sighed with pleasure because
  she looked so pretty. That was Mlle. Célie last night, monsieur. She gathered
  up her train, took her long white gloves in the other hand, and ran down the
  stairs, her heels clicking on the wood, her buckles glittering. At the bottom
  she turned and said to me:</p>

  <p>"'Remember, Helène, you can go to bed.' That was it monsieur."</p>

  <p>And now violently the rancour of Helène Vauquier's feelings burst out once
  more.</p>

  <p>"For her the fine clothes, the pleasure, and the happiness. For me &mdash;
  I could go to bed!"</p>

  <p>Hanaud looked again at the description which Helène Vauquier had written
  out, and read it through carefully. Then he asked a question, of which
  Ricardo did not quite see the drift.</p>

  <p>"So," he said, "when this morning you suggested to Monsieur the
  Commissaire that it would be advisable for you to go through Mlle. Célie's
  wardrobe, you found that nothing more had been taken away except the white
  lace coat?"</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now, after Mlle. Célie had gone down the stairs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I put the lights out in her room and, as she had ordered me to do, I went
  to bed. The next thing that I remember &mdash; but no! It terrifies me too
  much to think of it."</p>

  <p>Helène shuddered and covered her face spasmodically with her hands. Hanaud
  drew her hands gently down.</p>

  <p>"Courage! You are safe now, mademoiselle. Calm yourself!"</p>

  <p>She lay back with her eyes closed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes; it is true. I am safe now. But oh! I feel I shall never dare to
  sleep again!" And the tears swam in her eyes. "I woke up with a feeling of
  being suffocated. Mon Dieu! There was the light burning in the room, and a
  woman, the strange woman with the strong hands, was holding me down by the
  shoulders, while a man with his cap drawn over his eyes and a little black
  moustache pressed over my lips a pad from which a horribly sweet and sickly
  taste filled my mouth. Oh, I was terrified! I could not scream. I struggled.
  The woman told me roughly to keep quiet. But I could not. I must struggle.
  And then with a brutality unheard of she dragged me up on to my knees while
  the man kept the pad right over my mouth. The man, with the arm which was
  free, held me close to him, and she bound my hands with a cord behind me.
  Look!"</p>

  <p>She held out her wrists. They were terribly bruised. Red and angry lines
  showed where the cord had cut deeply into her flesh.</p>

  <p>"Then they flung me down again upon my back, and the next thing I remember
  is the doctor standing over me and this kind nurse supporting me."</p>

  <p>She sank back exhausted in her chair and wiped her forehead with her
  handkerchief. The sweat stood upon it in beads.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, mademoiselle," said Hanaud gravely. "This has been a trying
  ordeal for you. I understand that. But we are coming to the end. I want you
  to read this description of Mlle. Célie through again to make sure that
  nothing is omitted." He gave the paper into the maid's hands. "It will be
  advertised, so it is important that it should be complete. See that you have
  left out nothing."</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier bent her head over the paper.</p>

  <p>"No," said Helène at last. "I do not think I have omitted anything." And
  she handed the paper back.</p>

  <p>"I asked you," Hanaud continued suavely, "because I understand that Mlle.
  Célie usually wore a pair of diamond ear-drops, and they are not mentioned
  here."</p>

  <p>A faint colour came into the maid's face.</p>

  <p>"That is true, monsieur. I had forgotten. It is quite true."</p>

  <p>"Any one might forget," said Hanaud, with a reassuring smile. "But you
  will remember now. Think! think! Did Mlle. Célie wear them last night?" He
  leaned forward, waiting for her reply. Wethermill too, made a movement. Both
  men evidently thought the point of great importance. The maid looked at
  Hanaud for a few moments without speaking.</p>

  <p>"It is not from me, mademoiselle, that you will get the answer," said
  Hanaud quietly.</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur. I was thinking," said the maid, her face flushing at the
  rebuke.</p>

  <p>"Did she wear them when she went down the stairs last night?" he
  insisted.</p>

  <p>"I think she wore them," she said doubtfully. Ye-es &mdash; yes," and the
  words came now firm and clear. "I remember well. Mlle. Célie had taken them
  off before her bath, and they lay on the dressing-table. She put them into
  her ears while I dressed her hair and arranged the bow of ribbon in it."</p>

  <p>"Then we will add the earrings to your description," said Hanaud, as he
  rose from his chair with the paper in his hand, "and for the moment we need
  not trouble you any more about Mademoiselle Célie." He folded the paper up,
  slipped it into his letter-case, and put it away in his pocket. "Let us
  consider that poor Madame Dauvray! Did she keep much money in the house?"</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur; very little. She was well known in Aix and her cheques were
  everywhere accepted without question. It was a high pleasure to serve madame,
  her credit was so good," said Helène Vauquier, raising her head as though she
  herself had a share in the pride of that good credit.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," Hanaud agreed. "There are many fine households where the
  banking account is overdrawn, and it cannot be pleasant for the
  servants."</p>

  <p>"They are put to so many shifts to hide it from the servants of their
  neighbours," said Helène. "Besides," and she made a little grimace of
  contempt, "a fine household and an overdrawn banking account &mdash; it is
  like a ragged petticoat under a satin dress. That was never the case with
  Madame Dauvray."</p>

  <p>"So that she was under no necessity to have ready money always in her
  pocket," said Hanaud. "I understand that. But at times perhaps she won at the
  Villa des Fleurs?"</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier shook her head.</p>

  <p>"She loved the Villa des Fleurs, but she never played for high sums and
  often never played at all. If she won a few louis, she was as delighted with
  her gains and as afraid to lose them again at the tables as if she were of
  the poorest, and she stopped at once. No, monsieur; twenty or thirty louis
  &mdash; there was never more than that in the house."</p>

  <p>"Then it was certainly for her famous collection of jewellery that Madame
  Dauvray was murdered?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Now, where did she keep her jewellery?"</p>

  <p>"In a safe in her bedroom, monsieur. Every night she took off what she had
  been wearing and locked it up with the rest. She was never too tired for
  that."</p>

  <p>"And what did she do with the keys?"</p>

  <p>"That I cannot tell you. Certainly she locked her rings and necklaces away
  whilst I undressed her. And she laid the keys upon the dressing-table or the
  mantel-shelf &mdash; anywhere. But in the morning the keys were no longer
  where she had left them. She had put them secretly away."</p>

  <p>Hanaud turned to another point.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that Mademoiselle Célie knew of the safe and that the jewels
  were kept there?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes! Mademoiselle indeed was often in Madame Dauvray's room when she
  was dressing or undressing. She must often have seen madame take them out and
  lock them up again. But then, monsieur, so did I."</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded to her with a friendly smile.</p>

  <p>"Thank you once more, mademoiselle," he said. "The torture is over. But of
  course Monsieur Fleuriot will require your presence."</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier looked anxiously towards him.</p>

  <p>"But meanwhile I can go from this villa, monsieur?" she pleaded, with a
  trembling voice.</p>

  <p>"Certainly; you shall go to your friends at once."</p>

  <p>"Oh, monsieur, thank you!" she cried, and suddenly she gave way. The tears
  began to flow from her eyes. She buried her face in her hands and sobbed. "It
  is foolish of me, but what would you?" She jerked out the words between her
  sobs. "It has been too terrible."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Hanaud soothingly. "The nurse will put a few things
  together for you in a bag. You will not leuve Aix, of course, and I will send
  some one with you to your friends."</p>

  <p>The maid started violently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, not a sergent-de-ville, monsieur, I beg of you. I should be
  disgraced."</p>

  <p>"No. It shall be a man in plain clothes, to see that you are not hindered
  by reporters on the way."</p>

  <p>Hanaud turned towards the door. On the dressing-table a cord was lying. He
  took it up and spoke to the nurse.</p>

  <p>"Was this the cord with which Helène Vauquier's hands were tied?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur," she replied.</p>

  <p>Hanaud handed it to the Commissaire.</p>

  <p>"It will be necessary to keep that," he said.</p>

  <p>It was a thin piece of strong whipcord. It was the same kind of cord as
  that which had been found tied round Mme. Dauvray's throat. Hanaud opened the
  door and turned back to the nurse.</p>

  <p>"We will send for a cab for Mlle. Vauquier. You will drive with her to her
  door. I think after that she will need no further help. Pack up a few things
  and bring them down. Mlle. Vauquier can follow, no doubt, now without
  assistance." And, with a friendly nod, he left the room.</p>

  <p>Ricardo had been wondering, through the examination, in what light Hanaud
  considered Helène Vauquier. He was sympathetic, but the sympathy might merely
  have been assumed to deceive. His questions betrayed in no particular the
  colour of his mind. Now, however, he made himself clear. He informed the
  nurse, in the plainest possible way, that she was no longer to act as jailer.
  She was to bring Vauquier's things down; but Vauquier could follow by
  herself. Evidently Helène Vauquier was cleared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7"><small>CHAPTER 7</small></a><br>
  <br>
  A STARTLING DISCOVERY</h2>

  <p class="first">Harry Wethermill, however, was not so easily satisfied.</p>

  <p>"Surely, monsieur, it would be well to know whither she is going," he
  said, "and to make sure that when she has gone there she will stay there
  &mdash; until we want her again?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud looked at the young man pityingly.</p>

  <p>"I can understand, monsieur, that you hold strong views about Helène
  Vauquier. You are human, like the rest of us. And what she has said to us
  just now would not make you more friendly. But &mdash; but&mdash;" and he
  preferred to shrug his shoulders rather than to finish in words his sentence.
  "However," he said, "we shall take care to know where Helène Vauquier is
  staying. Indeed, if she is at all implicated in this affair we shall learn
  more if we leave her free than if we keep her under lock and key. You see
  that if we leave her quite free, but watch her very, very carefully, so as to
  awaken no suspicion, she may be emboldened to do something rash &mdash; or
  the others may."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo approved of Hanaud's reasoning.</p>

  <p>"That is quite true," he said. "She might write a letter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, or receive one," added Hanaud, "which would be still more
  satisfactory for us &mdash; supposing, of course, that she has anything to do
  with this affair"; and again he shrugged his shoulders. He turned towards the
  Commissaire.</p>

  <p>"You have a discreet officer whom you can trust?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. A dozen."</p>

  <p>"I want only one."</p>

  <p>"And here he is," said the Commissaire.</p>

  <p>They were descending the stairs. On the landing of the first floor
  Durette, the man who had discovered where the cord was bought, was still
  waiting. Hanaud took Durette by the sleeve in the familiar way which he so
  commonly used and led him to the top of the stairs, where the two men stood
  for a few moments apart. It was plain that Hanaud was giving, Durette
  receiving, definite instructions. Durette descended the stairs; Hanaud came
  back to the others.</p>

  <p>"I have told him to fetch a cab," he said, "and convey Helène Vauquier to
  her friends." Then he looked at Ricardo, and from Ricardo to the Commissaire,
  while he rubbed his hand backwards and forwards across his shaven chin.</p>

  <p>"I tell you," he said, "I find this sinister little drama very interesting
  to me. The sordid, miserable struggle for mastery in this household of Mme.
  Dauvray &mdash; eh? Yes, very interesting. Just as much patience, just as
  much effort, just as much planning for this small end as a general uses to
  defeat an army &mdash; and, at the last, nothing gained. What else is
  politics? Yes, very interesting."</p>

  <p>His eyes rested upon Wethermill's face for a moment, but they gave the
  young man no hope. He took a key from his pocket</p>

  <p>"We need not keep this room locked," he said. "We know all that there is
  to be known." And he inserted the key into the lock of Celia's room and
  turned it.</p>

  <p>"But is that wise, monsieur?" said Besnard.</p>

  <p>Hanaud shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The case is in your hands," said the Commissaire. To Ricardo the
  proceedings seemed singularly irregular. But if the Commissaire was content,
  it was not for him to object.</p>

  <p>"And where is my excellent friend Perrichet?" asked Hanaud; and leaning
  over the balustrade he called him up from the hall.</p>

  <p>"We will now," said Hanaud, "have a glance into this poor murdered woman's
  room."</p>

  <p>The room was opposite to Celia's. Besnard produced the key and unlocked
  the door. Hanaud took off his hat upon the threshold and then passed into the
  room with his companions. Upon the bed, outlined under a sheet, lay the rigid
  form of Mme. Dauvray. Hanaud stepped gently to the bedside and reverently
  uncovered the face. For a moment all could see it &mdash; livid, swollen,
  unhuman.</p>

  <p>"A brutal business," he said in a low voice, and when he turned again to
  his companions his face was white and sickly. He replaced the sheet and gazed
  about the room.</p>

  <p>It was decorated and furnished in the same style as the salon downstairs,
  yet the contrast between the two rooms was remarkable.</p>

  <p>Downstairs, in the salon, only a chair had been overturned. Here there was
  every sign of violence and disorder. An empty safe stood open in one corner;
  the rugs upon the polished floor had been tossed aside; every drawer had been
  torn open, every wardrobe burst; the very bed had been moved from its
  position.</p>

  <p>"It was in this safe that Madame Dauvray hid her jewels each night," said
  the Commissaire as Hanaud gazed about the room.</p>

  <p>"Oh, was it so?" Hanaud asked slowly. It seemed to Ricardo that he read
  something in the aspect of this room too, which troubled his mind and
  increased his perplexity.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Besnard confidently. "Every night Mme. Dauvray locked her
  jewels away in this safe. Vauquier told us so this morning. Every night she
  was never too tired for that. Besides, here" &mdash; and putting his hand
  into the safe he drew out a paper &mdash; "here is the list of Mme. Dauvray's
  jewellery."</p>

  <p>Plainly, however, Hanaud was not satisfied. He took the list and glanced
  through the items. But his thoughts were not concerned with it.</p>

  <p>"If that is so," he said slowly, "Mme Dauvray kept her jewels in this
  safe, why has every drawer been ransacked, why was the bed moved? Perrichet,
  lock the door &mdash; quietly &mdash; from the inside. That is right. Now
  lean your back against it."</p>

  <p>Hanaud waited until he saw Perrichet's broad back against the door. Then
  he went down upon his knees, and, tossing the rugs here and there, examined
  with the minutest care the inlaid floor. By the side of the bed a Persian mat
  of blue silk was spread. This in its turn he moved quickly aside. He bent his
  eyes to the ground, lay prone, moved this way and that to catch the light
  upon the floor, then with a spring he rose upon his knees. He lifted his
  finger to his lips. In a dead silence he drew a pen-knife quickly from his
  pocket and opened it. He bent down again and inserted the blade between the
  cracks of the blocks. The three men in the room watched him with an intense
  excitement. A block of wood rose from the floor, he pulled it out, laid it
  noiselessly down, and inserted his hand into the opening.</p>

  <p>Wethermill at Ricardo's elbow uttered a stifled cry. "Hush!" whispered
  Hanaud angrily. He drew out his hand again. It was holding a green leather
  jewel-case. He opened it, and a diamond necklace flashed its thousand colours
  in their faces. He thrust in his hand again and again and again, and each
  time that be withdrew it, it held a jewel-case. Before the astonished eyes of
  his companions he opened them. Ropes of pearls, collars of diamonds,
  necklaces of emeralds, rings of pigeon-blood rubies, bracelets of gold
  studded with opals- Mme. Dauvray's various jewellery was disclosed.</p>

  <p>"But that is astounding," said Besnard, in an awe-struck voice.</p>

  <p>"Then she was never robbed after all?" cried Ricardo.</p>

  <p>Hanaud rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What a piece of irony!" he whispered. "The poor woman is murdered for her
  jewels, the room's turned upside down, and nothing is found. For all the
  while they lay safe in this cache. Nothing is taken except what she wore. Let
  us see what she wore."</p>

  <p>"Only a few rings, Helène Vauquier thought," said Besnard. "But she was
  not sure."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Hanaud. "Well, let us make sure!" and, taking the list from the
  safe, he compared it with the jewellery in the cases on the floor, ticking
  off the items one by one. When he had finished he knelt down again, and,
  thrusting his hand into the hole, felt carefully about.</p>

  <p>"There is a pearl necklace missing," he said. "A valuable necklace, from
  the description in the list and some rings. She must have been wearing them;"
  and he sat back upon his heels. "We will send the intelligent Perrichet for a
  bag," he said, "and we will counsel the intelligent Perrichet not to breathe
  a word to any living soul of what he has seen in this room. Then we will seal
  up in the bag the jewels, and we will hand it over to M. le Commissaire, who
  will convey it with the greatest secrecy out of this villa. For the list
  &mdash; I will keep it," and he placed it carefully in his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>He unlocked the door and went out himself on to the landing. He looked
  down the stairs and up the stairs; then he beckoned Perrichet to him.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he whispered. "Be quick, and when you come back hide the bag
  carefully under your coat."</p>

  <p>Perrichet went down the stairs with pride written upon his face. Was he
  not assisting the great M. Hanaud from the Sûreté in Paris? Hanaud returned
  into Mme. Dauvray's room and closed the door. He looked into the eyes of his
  companions.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see the scene?" he asked with a queer smile of excitement. He
  had forgotten Wethermill; he had forgotten even the dead woman shrouded
  beneath the sheet. He was absorbed. His eyes were bright, his whole face
  vivid with life. Ricardo saw the real man at this moment &mdash; and feared
  for the happiness of Harry Wethermill. For nothing would Hanaud now turn
  aside until he had reached the truth and set his hands upon the quarry. Of
  that Ricardo felt sure. He was trying now to make his companions visualise
  just what he saw and understood.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see it? The old woman locking up her jewels in this safe every
  night before the eyes of her maid or her companion, and then, as soon as she
  was alone, taking them stealthily out of the safe and hiding them in this
  secret place. But I tell you &mdash; this is human. Yes, it is interesting
  just because it is so human. Then picture to yourselves last night, the
  murderers opening this safe and finding nothing &mdash; oh, but nothing!
  &mdash; and ransacking the room in deadly haste, kicking up the rugs, forcing
  open the drawers, and always finding nothing &mdash; nothing &mdash; nothing.
  Think of their rage, their stupefaction, and finally their fear! They must
  go, and with one pearl necklace, when they had hoped to reap a great fortune.
  Oh, but this is interesting &mdash; yes, I tell you &mdash; I, who have seen
  many strange things &mdash; this is interesting."</p>

  <p>Perrichet returned with a canvas bag, into which Hanaud placed the jewel-
  cases. He sealed the bag in the presence of the four men and handed it to
  Besnard. He replaced the block of wood in the floor, covered it over again
  with the rug, and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he said, in a low voice, and with a gravity which impressed them
  all. "There is something in this house which I do not understand. I have told
  you so. I tell you something more now. I am afraid &mdash; I am afraid." And
  the word startled his hearers like a thunderclap, though it was breathed no
  louder than a whisper, "Yes, my friends," he repeated, nodding his head,
  "terribly afraid." And upon the others fell a discomfort, an awe, as though
  something sinister and dangerous were present in the room and close to them.
  So vivid was the feeling, instinctively they drew nearer together. "Now, I
  warn you solemnly. There must be no whisper that these jewels have been
  discovered; no newspaper must publish a hint of it; no one must suspect that
  here in this room we have found them. Is that understood?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the Commissaire.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"To be sure, monsieur," said Perrichet.</p>

  <p>As for Harry Wethermill, he made no reply. His burning eyes were fixed
  upon Hanaud's face, and that was all. Hanaud, for his part, asked for no
  reply from him. Indeed, he did not look towards Harry Wethermill's face at
  all. Ricardo understood. Hanaud did not mean to be deterred by the suffering
  written there.</p>

  <p>He went down again into the little gay salon lit with flowers and August
  sunlight, and stood beside the couch gazing at it with troubled eyes. And, as
  he gazed, he closed his eyes and shivered. He shivered like a man who has
  taken a sudden chill. Nothing in all this morning's investigations, not even
  the rigid body beneath the sheet, nor the strange discovery of the jewels,
  had so impressed Ricardo. For there he had been confronted with facts,
  definite and complete; here was a suggestion of unknown horrors, a hint, not
  a fact, compelling the imagination to dark conjecture. Hanaud shivered. That
  he had no idea why Hanaud shivered made the action still more significant,
  still more alarming. And it was not Ricardo alone who was moved by it. A
  voice of despair rang through the room. The voice was Harry Wethermill's, and
  his face was ashy white.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur!" he cried, "I do not know what makes you shudder; but I am
  remembering a few words you used this morning."</p>

  <p>Hanaud turned upon his heel. His face was drawn and grey and his eyes
  blazed.</p>

  <p>"My friend, I also am remembering those words," he said. Thus the two men
  stood confronting one another, eye to eye, with awe and fear in both their
  faces.</p>

  <p>Ricardo was wondering to what words they both referred, when the sound of
  wheels broke in upon the silence. The effect upon Hanaud was magical. He
  thrust his hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Helène Vauquier's cab," he said lightly. He drew out his cigarette-case
  and lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Let us see that poor woman safely off. It is a closed cab I hope."</p>

  <p>It was a closed landau. It drove past the open door of the salon to the
  front door of the house. In Hanaud's wake they all went out into the hall.
  The nurse came down alone carrying Helène Vauquier's bag. She placed it in
  the cab and waited in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Helène Vauquier has fainted," she said anxiously: "she does not
  come." And she moved towards the stairs.</p>

  <p>Hanaud took a singularly swift step forward and stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Why should you think that?" he asked, with a queer smile upon his face,
  and as he spoke a door closed gently upstairs. "See," he continued, "you are
  wrong: she is coming."</p>

  <p>Ricardo was puzzled. It had seemed to him that the door which had closed
  so gently was nearer than Helène Vauquier's door. It seemed to him that the
  door was upon the first, not the second landing. But Hanaud had noticed
  nothing strange; so it could not be. He greeted Helène Vauquier with a smile
  as she came down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"You are better, mademoiselle," he said politely.</p>

  <p>"One can see that. There is more colour in your cheeks. A day or two, and
  you will be yourself again."</p>

  <p>He held the door open while she got into the cab. The nurse took her seat
  beside her; Durette mounted on the box. The cab turned and went down the
  drive.</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, mademoiselle," cried Hanaud, and he watched until the high
  shrubs hid the cab from his eyes. Then he behaved in an extraordinary way. He
  turned and sprang like lightning up the stairs. His agility amazed Ricardo.
  The others followed upon his heels. He flung himself at Celia's door and
  opened it He burst into the room, stood for a second, then ran to the window.
  He hid behind the curtain, looking out. With his hand he waved to his
  companions to keep back. The sound of wheels creaking and rasping rose to
  their ears. The cab had just come out into the road. Durette upon the box
  turned and looked towards the house. Just for a moment Hanaud leaned from the
  window, as Besnard, the Commissaire, had done, and, like Besnard again, he
  waved his hand. Then he came back into the room and saw, standing in front of
  him, with his mouth open and his eyes starting out of his head, Perrichet
  &mdash; the intelligent Perrichet.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," cried Perrichet, "something has been taken from this
  room."</p>

  <p>Hanaud looked round the room and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said.</p>

  <p>"But yes, monsieur," Perrichet insisted. "Oh, but yes. See! Upon this
  dressing-table there was a small pot of cold cream. It stood here, where my
  finger is, when we were in this room an hour ago. Now it is gone."</p>

  <p>Hanaud burst into a laugh.</p>

  <p>"My friend Perrichet," he said ironically, "I will tell you the newspaper
  did not do you justice. You are more intelligent. The truth, my excellent
  friend, lies at the bottom of a well; but you would find it at the bottom of
  a pot of cold cream. Now let us go. For in this house, gentlemen, we have
  nothing more to do."</p>

  <p>He passed out of the room. Perrichet stood aside, his face crimson, his
  attitude one of shame. He had been rebuked by the great M. Hanaud, and justly
  rebuked. He knew it now. He had wished to display his intelligence &mdash;
  yes, at all costs he must show how intelligent he was. And he had shown
  himself a fool. He should have kept silence about that pot of cream.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8"><small>CHAPTER 8</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP</h2>

  <p class="first">Hanaud walked away from the Villa Rose in the company of
  Wethermill and Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"We will go and lunch," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes; come to my hotel," said Harry Wethermill. But Hanaud shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"No; come with me to the Villa des Fleurs," he replied. "We may learn
  something there; and in a case like this every minute is of importance. We
  have to be quick."</p>

  <p>"I may come too?" cried Mr. Ricardo eagerly.</p>

  <p>"By all means," replied Hanaud, with a smile of extreme courtesy. "Nothing
  could be more delicious than monsieur's suggestions"; and with that remark he
  walked on silently.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo was in a little doubt as to the exact significance of the
  words. But he was too excited to dwell long upon them. Distressed though he
  sought to be at his friend's grief, he could not but assume an air of
  importance. All the artist in him rose joyfully to the occasion. He looked
  upon himself from the outside. He fancied without the slightest justification
  that people were pointing him out. "That man has been present at the
  investigation at the Villa Rose," he seemed to hear people say. "What strange
  things he could tell us if he would!"</p>

  <p>And suddenly, Mr. Ricardo began to reflect. What, after all, could he have
  told them?</p>

  <p>And that question he turned over in his mind while he ate his luncheon.
  Hanaud wrote a letter between the courses. They were sitting at a corner
  table, and Hanaud was in the corner with his back to the wall. He moved his
  plate, too, over the letter as he wrote it. It would have been impossible for
  either of his guests to see what he had written, even if they had wished.
  Ricardo, indeed, did wish. He rather resented the secrecy with which the
  detective, under a show of openness, shrouded his thoughts and acts. Hanaud
  sent the waiter out to fetch an officer in plain clothes, who was in
  attendance at the door, and he handed the letter to this man. Then he turned
  with an apology to his guests.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary that we should find out," he explained, "as soon as
  possible, the whole record of Mlle. Célie."</p>

  <p>He lighted a cigar, and over the coffee he put a question to Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me what you make of the case. What M. Wethermill thinks &mdash;
  that is clear, is it not? Helène Vauquier is the guilty one. But you, M.
  Ricardo? What is your opinion?"</p>

  <p>Ricardo took from his pocket-book a sheet of paper and from his pocket a
  pencil. He was intensely flattered by the request of Hanaud, and he proposed
  to do himself justice. "I will make a note here of what I think the salient
  features of the mystery"; and he proceeded to tabulate the points in the
  following way:</p>

  <p>(1) Celia Harland made her entrance into Mme. Dauvray's household under
  very doubtful circumstances.</p>

  <p>(2) By methods still more doubtful she accquired an extraordinary
  ascendency over Mme. Dauvray's mind.</p>

  <p>(3) If proof were needed how complete that ascendency was, a glance at
  Celia Harland's wardrobe would suffice; for she wore the most expensive
  clothes.</p>

  <p>(4) It was Celia Harland who arranged that Servettaz, the chauffeur,
  should be absent at Chambery on the Tuesday night &mdash; the night of the
  murder.</p>

  <p>(5) It was Celia Harland who bought the cord with which Mme. Dauvray was
  strangled and Helène Vauquier bound.</p>

  <p>(6) The footsteps outside the salon show that Celia Harland ran from the
  salon to the motor-car.</p>

  <p>(7) Celia Harland pretended that there should be a séance on the Tuesday,
  but she dressed as though she had in view an appointment with a lover,
  instead of a spiritualistic stance.</p>

  <p>(8) Celia Harland has disappeared.</p>

  <p>These eight points are strongly suggestive of Celia Harland's complicity
  in the murder. But I have no clue which will enable me to answer the
  following questions:</p>

  <p>(a) Who was the man who took part in the crime? (b) Who was the woman who
  came to the villa on the evening of the murder with Mme. Dauvray and Celia
  Harland?</p>

  <p>(c) What actually happened in the salon? How was the murder committed?</p>

  <p>(d) Is Helène Vauquier's story true?</p>

  <p>(e) What did the torn-up scrap of writing mean? (Probably spirit writing
  in Celia Harland's hand.)</p>

  <p>(f) Why has one cushion on the settee a small, fresh, brown stain, which
  is probably blood? Why is the other cushion torn?</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo had a momentary thought of putting down yet another question.
  He was inclined to ask whether or no a pot of cold cream had disappeared from
  Celia Harland's bedroom; but he remembered that Hanaud had set no store upon
  that incident, and he refrained. Moreover, he had come to the end of his
  sheet of paper. He handed it across the table to Hanaud and leaned back in
  his chair, watching the detective with all the eagerness of a young author
  submitting his first effort to a critic.</p>

  <p>Hanaud read it through slowly. At the end he nodded his head in
  approval.</p>

  <p>"Now we will see what M. Wethermill has to say," he said, and he stretched
  out the paper towards Harry Wethermill, who throughout the luncheon had not
  said a word.</p>

  <p>"No, no," cried Ricardo.</p>

  <p>But Harry Wethermill already held the written sheet in his hand. He smiled
  rather wistfully at his friend.</p>

  <p>"It is best that I should know just what you both think," he said, and in
  his turn he began to read the paper through. He read the first eight points,
  and then beat with his fist upon the table.</p>

  <p>"No no," he cried; "it is not possible! I don't blame you, Ricardo. These
  are facts, and, as I said, I can face facts. But there will be an explanation
  &mdash; if only we can discover it."</p>

  <p>He buried his face for a moment in his hands. Then he took up the paper
  again.</p>

  <p>"As for the rest, Helène Vauquier lied," he cried violently, and he tossed
  the paper to Hanaud. "What do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud smiled and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever go for a voyage on a ship?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; why?"</p>

  <p>"Because every day at noon three officers take an observation to determine
  the ship's position &mdash; the captain, the first officer, and the second
  officer. Each writes his observation down, and the captain takes the three
  observations and compares them. If the first or second officer is out in his
  reckoning, the captain tells him so, but he does not show his own. For at
  times, no doubt, he is wrong too. So, gentlemen, I critcise your
  observations, but I do not show you mine."</p>

  <p>He took up Ricardo's paper and read it through again.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said pleasantly. "But the two questions which are most
  important, which alone can lead us to the truth &mdash; how do they come to
  be omitted from your list, Mr. Ricardo?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud put the question with his most serious air. But Ricardo was none
  the less sensible of the raillery behind the solemn manner. He flushed and
  made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Still," continued Hanaud, "here are undoubtedly some questions. Let us
  consider them! Who was the man who took a part in the crime? Ah, if we only
  knew that, what a lot of trouble we should save ourselves! Who was the woman?
  What a good thing it would be to know that too! How clearly, after all, Mr.
  Ricardo puts his finger on the important points! What did actually happen in
  the salon?" And as he quoted that question the raillery died out of his
  voice. He leaned his elbows on the table and bent forward.</p>

  <p>"What did actually happen in that little pretty room, just twelve hours
  ago?" he repeated. "When no sunlight blazed upon the lawn, and all the birds
  were still, and all the windows shuttered and the world dark, what happened?
  What dreadful things happened? We have not much to go upon. Let us formulate
  what we know. We start with this. The murder was not the work of a moment. It
  was planned with great care and cunning, and carried out to the letter of the
  plan. There must be no noise, no violence. On each side of the Villa Rose
  there are other villas; a few yards away the road runs past. A scream, a cry,
  the noise of a struggle &mdash; these sounds, or any one of them, might be
  fatal to success. Thus the crime was planned; and there WAS no scream, there
  WAS no struggle. Not a chair was broken, and only a chair upset. Yes, there
  were brains behind that murder. We know that. But what do we know of the
  plan? How far can we build it up? Let us see. First, there was an accomplice
  in the house &mdash; perhaps two."</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Harry Wethermill.</p>

  <p>Hanaud took no notice of the interruption.</p>

  <p>"Secondly the woman came to the house with Mme. Dauvray and Mlle. Célie
  between nine and half-past nine. Thirdly, the man came afterwards, but before
  eleven, set open the gate, and was admitted into the salon, unperceived by
  Mme. Dauvray. That also we can safely assume. But what happened in the salon?
  Ah! There is the question." Then he shrugged his shoulders and said with the
  note of raillery once more in his voice:</p>

  <p>"But why should we trouble our heads to puzzle out this mystery, since M.
  Ricardo knows?"</p>

  <p>"I?" cried Ricardo in amazement.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," replied Hanaud calmly. "For I look at another of your
  questions. 'WHAT DID THE TORN-UP SCRAP OF WRITING MEAN?' and you add:
  'Probably spirit-writing.' Then there was a séance held last night in the
  little salon! Is that so?"</p>

  <p>Harry Wethermill started. Mr. Ricardo was at a loss.</p>

  <p>"I had not followed my suggestion to its conclusion," he admitted
  humbly.</p>

  <p>"No," said Hanaud. "But I ask myself in sober earnest, 'Was there a séance
  held in the salon last night?' Did the tambourine rattle in the darkness on
  the wall?"</p>

  <p>"But if Helène Vauquier's story is all untrue?" cried Wethermill, again in
  exasperation.</p>

  <p>"Patience, my friend. Her story was not all untrue. I say there were
  brains behind this crime; yes, but brains, even the cleverest, would not have
  invented this queer, strange story of the séances and of Mme. de Montespan.
  That is truth. But yet, if there were a séance held, if the scrap of paper
  were spirit-writing in answer to some awkward question, why &mdash; and here
  I come to my first question, which M. Ricardo has omitted &mdash; why did
  Mlle. Célie dress herself with so much elegance last night? What Vauquier
  said is true. Her dress was not suited to a séance. A light- coloured,
  rustling frock, which would be visible in a dim light, or even in the dark,
  which would certainly be heard at every movement she made, however lightly
  she stepped, and a big hat &mdash; no no! I tell you, gentlemen, we shall not
  get to the bottom of this mystery until we know why Mlle. Célie dressed
  herself as she did last night." "Yes," Ricardo admitted. "I overlooked that
  point." "Did she&mdash;" Hanaud broke off and bowed to Wethermill with a
  grace and a respect which condoned his words. "You must bear with me, my
  young friend, while I consider all these points. Did she expect to join that
  night a lover &mdash; a man with the brains to devise this crime? But if so
  &mdash; and here I come to the second question omitted from M. Ricardo's list
  &mdash; why, on the patch of grass outside the door of the salon, were the
  footsteps of the man and woman so carefully erased, and the footsteps of
  Mlle. Célie &mdash; those little footsteps so easily identified &mdash; left
  for all the world to see and recognise?"</p>

  <p>Ricardo felt like a child in the presence of his schoolmaster. He was
  convicted of presumption. He had set down his questions with the belief that
  they covered the ground. And here were two of the utmost importance, not
  forgotten, but never even thought of.</p>

  <p>"Did she go, before the murder, to join a lover? Or after it? At some
  time, you will remember, according to Vauquier's story, she must have run
  upstairs to fetch her coat. Was the murder committed during the interval when
  she was upstairs? Was the salon dark when she came down again? Did she run
  through it quickly, eagerly, noticing nothing amiss? And, indeed, how should
  she notice anything if the salon were dark, and Mme. Dauvray's body lay under
  the windows at the side?"</p>

  <p>Ricardo leaned forward eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That must be the truth," he cried; and Wethermill's voice broke hastily
  in:</p>

  <p>"It is not the truth and I will tell you why. Celia Harland was to have
  married me this week."</p>

  <p>There was so much pain and misery in his voice that Ricardo was moved as
  he had seldom been. Wethermill buried his face in his hands. Hanaud shook his
  head and gazed across the table at Ricardo with an expression which the
  latter was at no loss to understand. Lovers were impracticable people. But he
  &mdash; Hanaud &mdash; he knew the world. Women had fooled men before
  today.</p>

  <p>Wethermill snatched his hands away from before his face.</p>

  <p>"We talk theories," he cried desperately, "of what may have happened at
  the villa. But we are not by one inch nearer to the man and woman who
  committed the crime. It is for them we have to search."</p>

  <p>"Yes; but except by asking ourselves questions, how shall we find them, M.
  Wethermill?" said Hanaud. "Take the man! We know nothing of him. He has left
  no trace. Look at this town of Aix, where people come and go like a crowd
  about the baccarat-table! He may be at Marseilles today. He may be in this
  very room where we are taking our luncheon. How shall we find him?"</p>

  <p>Wethermill nodded his head in a despairing assent.</p>

  <p>"I know. But it is so hard to sit still and do nothing," he cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but we are not sitting still," said Hanaud; and Wethermill looked up
  with a sudden interest. "All the time that we have been lunching here the
  intelligent Perrichet has been making inquiries. Mme. Dauvray and Mlle. Célie
  left the Villa Rose at five, and returned on foot soon after nine with the
  strange woman. And there I see Perrichet himself waiting to be summoned."</p>

  <p>Hanaud beckoned towards the sergent-de-ville.</p>

  <p>"Perrichet will make an excellent detective," he said; "for he looks more
  bovine and foolish in plain clothes than he does in uniform."</p>

  <p>Perrichet advanced in his mufti to the table.</p>

  <p>"Speak, my friend," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"I went to the shop of M. Corval. Mlle. Célie was quite alone when she
  bought the cord. But a few minutes later, in the Rue du Casino, she and Mme.
  Dauvray were seen together, walking slowly in the direction of the villa. No
  other woman was with them."</p>

  <p>"That is a pity," said Hanaud quietly, and with a gesture he dismissed
  Perrichet.</p>

  <p>"You see, we shall find out nothing &mdash; nothing," said Wethermill,
  with a groan.</p>

  <p>"We must not yet lose heart, for we know a little more about the woman
  than we do about the man," said Hanaud consolingly.</p>

  <p>"True," exclaimed Ricardo. "We have Helène Vauquier's description of her.
  We must advertise it."</p>

  <p>Hanaud smiled.</p>

  <p>"But that is a fine suggestion," he cried. "We must think over that," and
  he clapped his hand to his forehead with a gesture of self-reproach. "Why did
  not such a fine idea occur to me, fool that I am! However, we will call the
  head waiter."</p>

  <p>The head waiter was sent for and appeared before them.</p>

  <p>"You knew Mme. Dauvray?" Hanaud asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur &mdash; oh, the poor woman! And he flung up his hands.</p>

  <p>"And you knew her young companion?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, monsieur. They generally had their meals here. See, at that
  little table over there! I kept it for them. But monsieur knows well" &mdash;
  and the waiter looked towards Harry Wethermill &mdash; "for monsieur was
  often with them."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hanaud. "Did Mme. Dauvray dine at that little table last
  night?"</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur. She was not here last night."</p>

  <p>"Nor Mlle. Célie?"</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur! I do not think they were in the Villa des Fleurs at
  all."</p>

  <p>"We know they were not," exclaimed Ricardo. "Wethermill and I were in the
  rooms and we did not see them."</p>

  <p>"But perhaps you left early," objected Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"No," said Ricardo. "It was just ten o'clock when we reached the
  Majestic."</p>

  <p>"You reached your hotel at ten," Hanaud repeated. "Did you walk straight
  from here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then you left here about a quarter to ten. And we know that Mme. Dauvray
  was back at the villa soon after nine. Yes &mdash; they could not have been
  here last night," Hanaud agreed, and sat for a moment silent. Then he turned
  to the head waiter.</p>

  <p>"Have you noticed any woman with Mme. Dauvray and her companion
  lately?"</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur. I do not think so."</p>

  <p>"Think! A woman, for instance, with red hair."</p>

  <p>Harry Wethermill started forward. Mr. Ricardo stared at Hanaud in
  amazement. The waiter reflected.</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur. I have seen no woman with red hair."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Hanaud, and the waiter moved away.</p>

  <p>"A woman with red hair!" cried Wethermill. "But Helène Vauquier described
  her. She was sallow; her eyes, her hair, were dark."</p>

  <p>Hanaud turned with a smile to Harry Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"Did Helène Vauquier, then, speak the truth?" he asked. "No; the woman who
  was in the salon last night, who returned home with Mme. Dauvray and Mlle.
  Célie, was not a woman with black hair and bright black eyes. Look!" And,
  fetching his pocket-book from his pocket, he unfolded a sheet of paper and
  showed them, lying upon its white surface a long red hair.</p>

  <p>"I picked that up on the table-the round satinwood table in the salon. It
  was easy not to see it, but I did see it. Now, that is not Mlle. Célie's
  hair, which is fair; nor Mme. Dauvray's, which is dyed brown; nor Helène
  Vauquier's, which is black; nor the charwoman's, which, as I have taken the
  trouble to find out, is grey. It is therefore from the head of our unknown
  woman. And I will tell you more. This woman with the red hair &mdash; she is
  in Geneva."</p>

  <p>A startled exclamation burst from Ricardo. Harry Wethermill sat slowly
  down. For the first time that day there had come some colour into his cheeks,
  a sparkle into his eye.</p>

  <p>"But that is wonderful!" he cried. "How did you find that out?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud leaned back in his chair and took a pull at his cigar. He was
  obviously pleased with Wethermill's admiration.</p>

  <p>"Yes, how did you find it out?" Ricardo repeated.</p>

  <p>Hanaud smiled.</p>

  <p>"As to that," he said, "remember I am the captain of the ship, and I do
  not show you my observation." Ricardo was disappointed. Harry Wethermill,
  however, started to his feet.</p>

  <p>"We must search Geneva, then," he cried. "It is there that we should be,
  not here drinking our coffee at the Villa des Fleurs."</p>

  <p>Hanaud raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"The search is not being overlooked. But Geneva is a big city. It is not
  easy to search Geneva and find, when we know nothing about the woman for whom
  we are searching, except that her hair is red, and that probably a young girl
  last night was with her. It is rather here, I think &mdash; in Aix &mdash;
  that we must keep our eyes wide open."</p>

  <p>"Here!" cried Wethermill in exasperation. He stared at Hanaud as though he
  were mad.</p>

  <p>"Yes, here; at the post office &mdash; at the telephone exchange. Suppose
  that the man is in Aix, as he may well be; some time he will wish to send a
  letter, or a telegram, or a message over the telephone. That, I tell you, is
  our chance. But here is news for us."</p>

  <p>Hanaud pointed to a messenger who was walking towards them. The man handed
  Hanaud an envelope.</p>

  <p>"From M. le Commissaire," he said; and he saluted and retired. "From M. le
  Commissaire?" cried Ricardo excitedly.</p>

  <p>But before Hanaud could open the envelope Harry Wethermill laid a hand
  upon his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Before we pass to something new, M. Hanaud," he said, "I should be very
  glad if you would tell me what made you shiver in the salon this morning. It
  has distressed me ever since. What was it that those two cushions had to tell
  you?"</p>

  <p>There was a note of anguish in his voice difficult to resist. But Hanaud
  resisted it. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Again," he said gravely, "I am to remind you that I am captain of the
  ship and do not show my observation."</p>

  <p>He tore open the envelope and sprang up from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Mme. Dauvray's motor-car has been found," he cried. "Let us go!"</p>

  <p>Hanaud called for the bill and paid it. The three men left the Villa des
  Fleurs together.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9"><small>CHAPTER 9</small></a><br>
  <br>
  MME. DAUVRAY'S MOTOR-CAR</h2>

  <p class="first">They got into a cab outside the door. Perrichet mounted the
  box, and the cab was driven along the upward-winding road past the Hotel
  Bernascon. A hundred yards beyond the hotel the cab stopped opposite to a
  villa. A hedge separated the garden of the villa from the road, and above the
  hedge rose a board with the words "To Let" upon it. At the gate a gendarme
  was standing, and just within the gate Ricardo saw Louis Besnard, the
  Commissaire, and Servettaz, Mme. Dauvray's chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"It is here," said Besnard, as the party descended from the cab, "in the
  coach-house of this empty villa."</p>

  <p>"Here?" cried Ricardo in amazement.</p>

  <p>The discovery upset all his theories. He had expected to hear that it had
  been found fifty leagues away; but here, within a couple of miles of the
  Villa Rose itself &mdash; the idea seemed absurd! Why take it away at all
  &mdash; unless it was taken away as a blind? That supposition found its way
  into Ricardo's mind, and gathered strength as he thought upon it; for Hanaud
  had seemed to lean to the belief that one of the murderers might be still in
  Aix. Indeed, a glance at him showed that he was not discomposed by their
  discovery.</p>

  <p>"When was it found?" Hanaud asked.</p>

  <p>"This morning. A gardener comes to the villa on two days a week to keep
  the grounds in order. Fortunately Wednesday is one of his days. Fortunately,
  too, there was rain yesterday evening. He noticed the tracks of the wheels
  which you can see on the gravel, and since the villa is empty he was
  surprised. He found the coach-house door forced and the motor-car inside it.
  When he went to his luncheon he brought the news of his discovery to the
  depot."</p>

  <p>The party followed the Commissaire along the drive to the coach-house.</p>

  <p>"We will have the car brought out," said Hanaud to Servettaz.</p>

  <p>It was a big and powerful machine with a limousine body, luxuriously
  fitted and cushioned in the shade of light grey. The outside panels of the
  car were painted a dark grey. The car had hardly been brought out into the
  sunlight before a cry of stupefaction burst from the lips of Perrichet.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he cried, in utter abasement. "I shall never forgive myself &mdash;
  never, never!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Hanaud asked, turning sharply as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Perrichet was standing with his round eyes staring and his mouth
  agape.</p>

  <p>"Because, monsieur, I saw that car &mdash; at four o'clock this morning
  &mdash; at the corner of the road &mdash; not fifty yards from the Villa
  Rose."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"You saw it!" exclaimed Wethermill.</p>

  <p>Upon their faces was reflected now the stupefaction of Perrichet.</p>

  <p>"But you must have made a mistake," said the Commissaire.</p>

  <p>"No, no, monsieur," Perrichet insisted. "It was that car. It was that
  number. It was just after daylight. I was standing outside the gate of the
  villa on duty where M. le Commissaire had placed me. The car appeared at the
  corner and slackened speed. It seemed to me that it was going to turn into
  the road and come down past me. But instead the driver, as if he were now
  sure of his way, put the car at its top speed and went on into Aix."</p>

  <p>"Was any one inside the car?" asked Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur; it was empty."</p>

  <p>"But you saw the driver!" exclaimed Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"Yes; what was he like?" cried the Commissaire.</p>

  <p>Perrichet shook his head mournfully.</p>

  <p>"He wore a talc mask over the upper part of his face, and had a little
  black moustache, and was dressed in a heavy great-coat of blue with a white
  collar."</p>

  <p>"That is my coat, monsieur," said Servettaz, and as he spoke he lifted it
  up from the chauffeur's seat. "It is Mme. Dauvray's livery."</p>

  <p>Harry Wethermill groaned aloud.</p>

  <p>"We have lost him. He was within our grasp &mdash; he, the murderer!
  &mdash; and he was allowed to go!"</p>

  <p>Perrichet's grief was pitiable.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he pleaded, "a car slackens its speed and goes on again
  &mdash; it is not so unusual a thing. I did not know the number of Mme.
  Dauvray's car. I did not even know that it had disappeared"; and suddenly
  tears of mortification filled his eyes. "But why do I make these excuses?" he
  cried. "It is better, M. Hanaud, that I go back to my uniform and stand at
  the street corner. I am as foolish as I look."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, my friend," said Hanaud, clapping the disconsolate man upon the
  shoulder. "You remembered the car and its number. That is something &mdash;
  and perhaps a great deal," he added gravely. "As for the talc mask and the
  black moustache, that is not much to help us, it is true." He looked at
  Ricardo's crestfallen face and smiled. "We might arrest our good friend M.
  Ricardo upon that evidence, but no one else that I know."</p>

  <p>Hanaud laughed immoderately at his joke. He alone seemed to feel no
  disappointment at Perrichet's oversight. Ricardo was a little touchy on the
  subject of his personal appearance, and bridled visibly. Hanaud turned
  towards Servettaz.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "you know how much petrol was taken from the garage?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me, by the amount which has been used, how far that car was
  driven last night?" Hanaud asked.</p>

  <p>Servettaz examined the tank.</p>

  <p>"A long way, monsieur. From a hundred and thirty to a hundred and fifty
  kilometers, I should say."</p>

  <p>"Yes, just about that distance, I should say," cried Hanaud.</p>

  <p>His eyes brightened, and a smile, a rather fierce smile, came to his lips.
  He opened the door, and examined with a minute scrutiny the floor of the
  carriage, and as he looked, the smile faded from his face. Perplexity
  returned to it. He took the cushions, looked them over and shook them
  out.</p>

  <p>"I see no sign&mdash;" he began, and then he uttered a little shrill cry
  of satisfaction. From the crack of the door by the hinge he picked off a tiny
  piece of pale green stuff, which he spread out upon the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, what is this?" he said to Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"It is a green fabric," said Ricardo very wisely.</p>

  <p>"It is green chiffon," said Hanaud. "And the frock in which Mlle. Célie
  went away was of green chiffon over satin. Yes, Mlle. Célie travelled in this
  car."</p>

  <p>He hurried to the driver's seat. Upon the floor there was some dark mould.
  Hanaud cleaned it off with his knife and held some of it in the palm of his
  hand. He turned to Servettaz.</p>

  <p>"You drove the car on Tuesday morning before you went to Chambery?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Where did you take up Mme. Dauvray and Mlle. Célie?"</p>

  <p>"At the front door of the Villa Rose."</p>

  <p>"Did you get down from the seat at all?"</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur; not after I left the garage."</p>

  <p>Hanaud returned to his companions.</p>

  <p>"See!" And he opened his hand. "This is black soil &mdash; moist from last
  night's rain &mdash; soil like the soil in front of Mme. Dauvray's salon.
  Look, here is even a blade or two of the grass"; and he turned the mould over
  in the palm of his hand. Then he took an empty envelope from his pocket and
  poured the soil into it and gummed the flap down. He stood and frowned at the
  motor-car.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, "how I am puzzled! There was a man last night at the
  Villa Rose. There were a man's blurred footmarks in the mould before the
  glass door. That man drove madame's car for a hundred and fifty kilometers,
  and he leaves the mould which clung to his boots upon the floor of his seat.
  Mlle. Célie and another woman drove away inside the car. Mlle. Célie leaves a
  fragment of the chiffon tunic of her frock which caught in the hinge. But
  Mlle. Célie made much clearer impressions in the mould than the man. Yet on
  the floor of the carriage there is no trace of her shoes. Again I say there
  is something here which I do not understand." And he spread out his hands
  with an impulsive gesture of despair</p>

  <p>"It looks as if they had been careful and he careless," said Mr. Ricardo,
  with the air of a man solving a very difficult problem.</p>

  <p>"What a mind!" cried Hanaud, now clasping his hands together in
  admiration. "How quick and how profound!"</p>

  <p>There was at times something elphantinely elfish in M. Hanaud's demeanour,
  which left Mr. Ricardo at a loss. But he had come to notice that these
  undignified manifestations usually took place when Hanaud had reached a
  definite opinion upon some point which had perplexed him.</p>

  <p>"Yet there is perhaps, another explanation," Hanaud continued. "For
  observe, M. Ricardo. We have other evidence to show that the careless one was
  Mlle. Célie. It was she who left her footsteps so plainly visible upon the
  grass, not the man. However, we will go back to M. Wethermill's room at the
  Hotel Majestic and talk this matter over. We know something now. Yes, we know
  &mdash; what do we know, monsieur?" he asked, suddenly turning with a smile
  to Ricardo, and, as Ricardo paused: "Think it over while we walk down to M.
  Wethermill's apartment in the Hotel Majestic."</p>

  <p>"We know that the murderer has escaped," replied Ricardo hotly.</p>

  <p>"The murderer is not now the most important object of our search. He is
  very likely at Marseilles by now. We shall lay our hands on him, never fear,"
  replied Hanaud, with a superb gesture of disdain. "But it was thoughtful of
  you to remind me of him. I might so easily have clean forgotten him, and then
  indeed my reputation would have suffered an eclipse." He made a low, ironical
  bow to Ricardo and walked quickly down the road.</p>

  <p>"For a cumbersome man he is extraordinarily active," said Mr. Ricardo to
  Harry Wethermill, trying to laugh, without much success. "A heavy, clever,
  middle-aged man, liable to become a little gutter-boy at a moment's
  notice."</p>

  <p>Thus he described the great detective, and the description is quoted. For
  it was Ricardo's best effort in the whole of this business.</p>

  <p>The three men went straight to Harry Wethermill's apartment, which
  consisted of a sitting-room and a bedroom on the first floor. A balcony ran
  along outside. Hanaud stepped out on to it, looked about him, and
  returned.</p>

  <p>"It is as well to know that we cannot be overheard," he said.</p>

  <p>Harry Wethermill meanwhile had thrown himself into a chair. The mask he
  had worn had slipped from its fastenings for a moment. There was a look of
  infinite suffering upon his face. It was the face of a man tortured by misery
  to the snapping-point.</p>

  <p>Hanaud, on the other hand, was particularly alert. The discovery of the
  motor-car had raised his spirits. He sat at the table.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what we have learnt," he said, "and it is of importance.
  The three of them &mdash; the man, the woman with the red hair, and Mlle.
  Célie &mdash; all drove yesterday night to Geneva. That is only one thing we
  have learnt."</p>

  <p>"Then you still cling to Geneva?" said Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"More than ever," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>He turned in his chair towards Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my poor friend!" he said, when he saw the young man's distress.</p>

  <p>Harry Wethermill sprang up with a gesture as though to sweep the need of
  sympathy away.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You have a road map, perhaps?" said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Wethermill, "mine is here. There it is"; and crossing the room
  he brought it from a sidetable and placed it in front of Hanaud. Hanaud took
  a pencil from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"One hundred and fifty kilometers was about the distance which the car had
  travelled. Measure the distances here, and you will see that Geneva is the
  likely place. It is a good city to hide in. Moreover the car appears at the
  corner at daylight. How does it appear, there? What road is it which comes
  out at that corner? The road from Geneva. I am not sorry that it is Geneva,
  for the Chef de la Sûreté is a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"And what else do we know?" asked Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"This," said Hanaud. He paused impressively. "Bring up your chair to the
  table, M. Wethermill, and consider whether I am right or wrong"; and he
  waited until Harry Wethermill had obeyed. Then he laughed in a friendly way
  at himself.</p>

  <p>"I cannot help it," he said; "I have an eye for dramatic effects. I must
  prepare for them when I know they are coming. And one, I tell you, is coming
  now."</p>

  <p>He shook his finger at his companions. Ricardo shifted and shuffled in his
  chair. Harry Wethermill kept his eyes fixed on Hanaud's face, but he was
  quiet, as he had been throughout the long inquiry.</p>

  <p>Hanaud lit a cigarette and took his time.</p>

  <p>"What I think is this. The man who drove the car into Geneva drove it
  back, because &mdash; he meant to leave it again in the garage of the Villa
  Rose."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" cried Ricardo, flinging himself back. The theory so calmly
  enunciated took his breath away.</p>

  <p>"Would he have dared?" asked Harry Wethermill.</p>

  <p>Hanaud leaned across and tapped his fingers on the table to emphasise his
  answer.</p>

  <p>"All through this crime there are two things visible &mdash; brains and
  daring; clever brains and extraordinary daring. Would he have dared? He dared
  to be at the corner close to the Villa Rose at daylight. Why else should he
  have returned except to put back the car? Consider! The petrol is taken from
  tins which Servettaz might never have touched for a fortnight, and by that
  time he might, as he said, have forgotten whether he had not used them
  himself. I had this possibility in my mind when I put the questions to
  Servettaz about the petrol which the Commissaire thought so stupid. The
  utmost care is taken that there shall be no mould left on the floor of the
  carriage. The scrap of chiffon was torn off, no doubt, when the women finally
  left the car, and therefore not noticed, or that, too, would have been
  removed. That the exterior of the car was dirty betrayed nothing, for
  Servettaz had left it uncleaned."</p>

  <p>Hanaud leaned back and, step by step, related the journey of the car.</p>

  <p>"The man leaves the gate open; he drives into Geneva the two women, who
  are careful that their shoes shall leave no marks upon the floor. At Geneva
  they get out. The man returns. If he can only leave the car in the garage he
  covers all traces of the course he and his friends have taken. No one would
  suspect that the car had ever left the garage. At the corner of the road,
  just as he is turning down to the villa, he sees a sergent-de-ville at the
  gate. He knows that the murder is discovered. He puts on full speed and goes
  straight out of the town. What is he to do? He is driving a car for which the
  police in an hour or two, if not now already, will be surely watching. He is
  driving it in broad daylight. He must get rid of it, and at once, before
  people are about to see it, and to see him in it. Imagine his feelings! It is
  almost enough to make one pity him. Here he is in a car which convicts him as
  a murderer, and he has nowhere to leave it. He drives through Aix. Then on
  the outskirts of the town he finds an empty villa. He drives in at the gate,
  forces the door of the coach-house, and leaves his car there. Now, observe!
  It is no longer any use for him to pretend that he and his friends did not
  disappear in that car. The murder is already discovered, and with the murder
  the disappearance of the car. So he no longer troubles his head about it. He
  does not remove the traces of mould from the place where his feet rested,
  which otherwise, no doubt, he would have done. It no longer matters. He has
  to run to earth now before he is seen. That is all his business. And so the
  state of the car is explained. It was a bold step to bring that car back
  &mdash; yes, a bold and desperate step. But a clever one. For, if it had
  succeeded, we should have known nothing of their movements &mdash; oh, but
  nothing &mdash; nothing. Ah! I tell you this is no ordinary blundering
  affair. They are clever people who devised this crime &mdash; clever, and of
  an audacity which is surprising."</p>

  <p>Then Hanaud lit another cigarette.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo, on the other hand, could hardly continue to smoke for
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand your calmness," he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"No?" said Hanaud. "Yet it is so obvious. You are the amateur, I am the
  professional &mdash; that is all."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I must go" he said and as he turned towards the door a cry sprang from
  Mr. Ricardo's lips "It is true. I am the amateur. Yet I have knowledge,
  Monsieur Hanaud which the professional would do well to obtain."</p>

  <p>Hanaud turned a guarded face towards Ricardo. There was no longer any
  raillery in his manner. He spoke slowly, coldly.</p>

  <p>"Let me have it then!"</p>

  <p>"I have driven in my motor-car from Geneva to Aix," Ricardo cried
  excitedly. "A bridge crosses a ravine high up amongst the mountains. At the
  bridge there is a Custom House. There &mdash; at the Pont de la Caille
  &mdash; your car is stopped. It is searched. You must sign your name in a
  book. And there is no way round. You would find sure and certain proof
  whether or no Madame Dauvray's car travelled last night to Geneva. Not so
  many travellers pass along that road at night. You would find certain proof
  too of how many people were in the car. For they search carefully at the Pont
  de la Caille."</p>

  <p>A dark flush overspread Hanaud's face. Ricardo was in the seventh Heaven.
  He had at last contributed something to the history of this crime. He had
  repaired an omission. He had supplied knowledge to the omniscient. Wethermill
  looked up drearily like one who has lost heart.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you must not neglect that clue," he said.</p>

  <p>Hanaud replied testily:</p>

  <p>"It is not a clue. M. Ricardo tells that he travelled from Geneva into
  France and that his car was searched. Well, we know already that the officers
  are particular at the Custom Houses of France. But travelling from France
  into Switzerland is a very different affair. In Switzerland, hardly a glance,
  hardly a word." That was true. M. Ricardo crestfallen recognized the truth.
  But his spirits rose again at once. "But the car came back from Geneva into
  France!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but when the car came back, the man was alone in it," Hanaud
  answered. "I have more important things to attend to. For instance I must
  know whether by any chance they have caught our man at Marseilles." He laid
  his hand on Wethermill's shoulder. "And you, my friend, I should counsel you
  to get some sleep. We may need all our strength tomorrow. I hope so." He was
  speaking very bravely. "Yes, I hope so."</p>

  <p>Wethermill nodded.</p>

  <p>"I shall try," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's better," said Hanaud cheerfully. "You will both stay here this
  evening; for if I have news, I can then ring you up."</p>

  <p>Both men agreed, and Hanaud went away. He left Mr. Ricardo profoundly
  disturbed. "That man will take advice from no one," he declared. "His vanity
  is colossal. It is true they are not particular at the Swiss Frontier. Still
  the car would have to stop there. At the Custom House they would know
  something. Hanaud ought to make inquiries." But neither Ricardo nor Harry
  Wethermill heard a word more from Hanaud that night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10"><small>CHAPTER 10</small></a><br>
  <br>
  NEWS FROM GENEVA</h2>

  <p class="first">The next morning, however, before Mr. Ricardo was out of his
  bed, M. Hanaud was announced. He came stepping gaily into the room, more
  elephantinely elfish than ever.</p>

  <p>"Send your valet away," he said. And as soon as they were alone he
  produced a newspaper, which he flourished in Mr. Ricardo's face and then
  dropped into his hands.</p>

  <p>Ricardo saw staring him in the face a full description of Celia Harland,
  of her appearance and her dress, of everything except her name, coupled with
  an intimation that a reward of four thousand francs would be paid to any one
  who could give information leading to the discovery of her whereabouts to Mr.
  Ricardo, the Hotel Majestic, Aix-les-Bains!</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo sat up in his bed with a sense of outrage.</p>

  <p>"You have done this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Why have you done it?" Mr. Ricardo cried.</p>

  <p>Hanaud advanced to the bed mysteriously on the tips of his toes.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," he said, in his most confidential tones. "Only it must
  remain a secret between you and me. I did it &mdash; because I have a sense
  of humour."</p>

  <p>"I hate publicity," said Mr. Ricardo acidly.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand you have four thousand francs," protested the
  detective. "Besides, what else should I do? If I name myself, the very people
  we are seeking to catch &mdash; who, you may be sure, will be the first to
  read this advertisement &mdash; will know that I, the great, the incomparable
  Hanaud, am after them; and I do not want them to know that. Besides" &mdash;
  and he spoke now in a gentle and most serious voice &mdash; "why should we
  make life more difficult for Mlle. Célie by telling the world that the police
  want her? It will be time enough for that when she appears before the Juge
  d'Instruction."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo grumbled inarticulately, and read through the advertisement
  again.</p>

  <p>"Besides, your description is incomplete," he said. "There is no mention
  of the diamond earrings which Celia Harland was wearing when she went
  away."</p>

  <p>"Ah! so you noticed that!" exclaimed Hanaud. "A little more experience and
  I should be looking very closely to my laurels. But as for the earrings
  &mdash; I will tell you, Mlle. Célie was not wearing them when she went away
  from the Villa Rose."</p>

  <p>"But &mdash; but," stammered Ricardo, "the case upon the dressing-room
  table was empty."</p>

  <p>"Still, she was not wearing them, I know," said Hanaud decisively.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" cried Ricardo, gazing at Hanaud with awe in his eyes.
  "How could you know?"</p>

  <p>"Because" &mdash; and Hanaud struck a majestic attitude, like a king in a
  play &mdash; "because I am the captain of the ship."</p>

  <p>Upon that Mr. Ricardo suffered a return of his ill-humour.</p>

  <p>"I do not like to be trifled with," he remarked, with as much dignity as
  his ruffled hair and the bed-clothes allowed him. He looked sternly at the
  newspaper, turning it over, and then he uttered a cry of surprise.</p>

  <p>"But this is yesterday's paper!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday evening's paper," Hanaud corrected.</p>

  <p>"Printed at Geneva!"</p>

  <p>"Printed, and published and sold at Geneva," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"When did you send the advertisement in, then?"</p>

  <p>"I wrote a letter while we were taking our luncheon," Hanaud explained.
  "The letter was to Besnard, asking him to telegraph the advertisement at
  once."</p>

  <p>"But you never said a word about it to us," Ricardo grumbled.</p>

  <p>"No. And was I not wise?" said Hanaud, with complacency. "For you would
  have forbidden me to use your name."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't go so far as that," said Ricardo reluctantly. His indignation
  was rapidly evaporating. For there was growing up in his mind a pleasant
  perception that the advertisement placed him in the limelight.</p>

  <p>He rose from his bed.</p>

  <p>"You will make yourself comfortable in the sitting-room while I have my
  bath."</p>

  <p>"I will, indeed," replied Hanaud cheerily. "I have already ordered my
  morning chocolate. I have hopes that you may have a telegram very soon. This
  paper was cried last night through the streets of Geneva."</p>

  <p>Ricardo dressed for once in a way with some approach to ordinary celerity,
  and joined Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"Has nothing come?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No. This chocolate is very good; it is better than that which I get in my
  hotel."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" cried Ricardo, who was fairly twittering with excitement.
  "You sit there talking about chocolate while my cup shakes in my
  fingers."</p>

  <p>"Again I must remind you that you are the amateur, I the professional, my
  friend."</p>

  <p>As the morning drew on, however, Hanaud's professional quietude deserted
  him. He began to start at the sound of footsteps in the corridor, to glance
  every other moment from the window, to eat his cigarettes rather than to
  smoke them. At eleven o'clock Ricardo's valet brought a telegram into the
  room. Ricardo seized it.</p>

  <p>"Calmly, my friend," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>With trembling fingers Ricardo tore it open. He jumped in his chair.
  Speechless, he handed the telegram to Hanaud. It had been sent from Geneva,
  and it ran thus:</p>

  <p>"Expect me soon after three. &mdash; MARTHE GOBIN."</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"I told you I had hopes." All his levity had gone in an instant from his
  manner. He spoke very quietly.</p>

  <p>"I had better send for Wethermill?" asked Ricardo.</p>

  <p>Hanaud shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"As you like. But why raise hopes in that poor man's breast which an hour
  or two may dash for ever to the ground? Consider! Marthe Gobin has something
  to tell us. Think over those eight points of evidence which you drew up
  yesterday in the Villa des Fleurs, and say whether what she has to tell us is
  more likely to prove Mlle. Célie's innocence than her guilt. Think well, for
  I will be guided by you, M. Ricardo," said Hanaud solemnly. "If you think it
  better that your friend should live in torture until Marthe Gobin comes, and
  then perhaps suffer worse torture from the news she brings, be it so. You
  shall decide. If, on the other hand, you think it will be best to leave M.
  Wethermill in peace until we know her story, be it so. You shall decide."</p>

  <p>Ricardo moved uneasily. The solemnity of Hanaud's manner impressed him. He
  had no wish to take the responsibility of the decision upon himself. But
  Hanaud sat with his eyes strangely fixed upon Ricardo, waiting for his
  answer.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Ricardo, at length, "good news will be none the worse for
  waiting a few hours. Bad news will be a little the better."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hanaud; "so I thought you would decide." He took up a
  Continental Bradshaw from a bookshelf in the room. "From Geneva she will come
  through Culoz. Let us see!" He turned over the pages. "There is a train from
  Culoz which reaches Aix at seven minutes past three. It is by that train she
  will come. You have a motor-car?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Will you pick me up in it at three at my hotel? We will drive
  down to the station and see the arrivals by that train. It may help us to get
  some idea of the person with whom we have to deal. That is always an
  advantage. Now I will leave you, for I have much to do. But I will look in
  upon M. Wethermill as I go down and tell him that there is as yet no
  news."</p>

  <p>He took up his hat and stick, and stood for a moment staring out of the
  window. Then he roused himself from his reverie with a start.</p>

  <p>"You look out upon Mont Revard, I see. I think M. Wethermill's view over
  the garden and the town is the better one," he said, and went out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock Ricardo called in his car, which was an open car of high
  power, at Hanaud's hotel, and the two men went to the station. They waited
  outside the exit while the passengers gave up their tickets. Amongst them a
  middle-aged, short woman, of a plethoric tendency, attracted their notice.
  She was neatly but shabbily dressed in black; her gloves were darned, and she
  was obviously in a hurry. As she came out she asked a commissionaire:</p>

  <p>"How far is it to the Hotel Majestic?"</p>

  <p>The man told her the hotel was at the very top of the town, and the way
  was steep.</p>

  <p>"But madame can go up in the omnibus of the hotel," he suggested. Madame,
  however, was in too much of a hurry. The omnibus would have to wait for
  luggage. She hailed a closed cab and drove off inside it.</p>

  <p>"Now, if we go back in the car, we shall be all ready for her when she
  arrives," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>They passed the cab, indeed, a few yards up the steep hill which leads
  from the station. The cab was moving at a walk.</p>

  <p>"She looks honest," said Hanaud, with a sigh of relief. "She is some good
  bourgeoise anxious to earn four thousand francs."</p>

  <p>They reached the hotel in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"We may need your car again the moment Marthe Gobin has gone," said
  Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"It shall wait here," said Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"No," said Hanaud; "let it wait in the little street at the back of my
  hotel. It will not be so noticeable there. You have petrol for a long
  journey?"</p>

  <p>Ricardo gave the order quietly to his chauffeur, and followed Hanaud into
  the hotel. Through a glass window they could see Wethermill smoking a cigar
  over his coffee.</p>

  <p>"He looks as if he had not slept," said Ricardo.</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded sympathetically, and beckoned Ricardo past the window.</p>

  <p>"But we are nearing the end. These two days have been for him days of
  great trouble; one can see that very clearly. And he has done nothing to
  embarrass us. Men in distress are apt to be a nuisance. I am grateful to M.
  Wethermill. But we are nearing the end. Who knows? Within an hour or two we
  may have news for him."</p>

  <p>He spoke with great feeling, and the two men ascended the stairs to
  Ricardo's rooms. For the second time that day Hanaud's professional calm
  deserted him. The window overlooked the main entrance to the hotel. Hanaud
  arranged the room, and, even while he arranged it, ran every other second and
  leaned from the window to watch for the coming of the cab.</p>

  <p>"Put the bank-notes upon the table," he said hurriedly. "They will
  persuade her to tell us all that she has to tell. Yes, that will do. She is
  not in sight yet? No."</p>

  <p>"She could not be. It is a long way from the station," said Ricardo, "and
  the whole distance is uphill."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is true," Hanaud replied. "We will not embarrass her by sitting
  round the table like a tribunal. You will sit in that arm-chair."</p>

  <p>Ricardo took his seat, crossed his knees, and joined the tips of his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"So! not too judicial!" said Hanaud; "I will sit here at the table.
  Whatever you do, do not frighten her." Hanaud sat down in the chair which he
  had placed for himself. "Marthe Gobin shall sit opposite, with the light upon
  her face. So!" And, springing up, he arranged a chair for her. "Whatever you
  do, do not frighten her," he repeated. "I am nervous. So much depends upon
  this interview." And in a second he was back at the window.</p>

  <p>Ricardo did not move. He arranged in his mind the interrogatory which was
  to take place. He was to conduct it. He was the master of the situation. All
  the limelight was to be his. Startling facts would come to light elicited by
  his deft questions. Hanaud need not fear. He would not frighten her. He would
  be gentle, he would be cunning. Softly and delicately he would turn this good
  woman inside out, like a glove. Every artistic fibre in his body vibrated to
  the dramatic situation.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Hanaud leaned out of the window.</p>

  <p>"It comes! it comes!" he said in a quick, feverish whisper. "I can see the
  cab between the shrubs of the drive."</p>

  <p>"Let it come!" said Mr. Ricardo superbly.</p>

  <p>Even as he sat he could hear the grating of wheels upon the drive. He saw
  Hanaud lean farther from the window and stamp impatiently upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"There it is at the door," he said; and for a few seconds he spoke no
  more. He stood looking downwards, craning his head, with his back towards
  Ricardo.</p>

  <p>Then, with a wild and startled cry, he staggered back into the room. His
  face was white as wax, his eyes full of horror, his mouth open.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" exclaimed Ricardo, springing to his feet.</p>

  <p>"They are lifting her out! She doesn't move! They are lifting her
  out!"</p>

  <p>For a moment he stared into Ricardo's face &mdash; paralysed by fear. Then
  he sprang down the stairs. Ricardo followed him.</p>

  <p>There was confusion in the corridor. Men were running, voices were crying
  questions. As they passed the window they saw Wethermill start up, aroused
  from his lethargy. They knew the truth before they reached the entrance of
  the hotel. A cab had driven up to the door from the station; in the cab was
  an unknown woman stabbed to the heart.</p>

  <p>"She should have come by the omnibus," Hanaud repeated and repeated
  stupidly. For the moment he was off his balance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11"><small>CHAPTER 11</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE UNOPENED LETTER</h2>

  <p class="first">The hall of the hotel had been cleared of people. At the
  entrance from the corridor a porter barred the way.</p>

  <p>"No one can pass," said he.</p>

  <p>"I think that I can," said Hanaud, and he produced his card. "From the
  Sûreté at Paris."</p>

  <p>He was allowed to enter, with Ricardo at his heels. On the ground lay
  Marthe Gobin; the manager of the hotel stood at her side; a doctor was on his
  knees. Hanaud gave his card to the manager.</p>

  <p>"You have sent word to the police?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the manager.</p>

  <p>"And the wound?" asked Hanaud, kneeling on the ground beside the doctor.
  It was a very small wound, round and neat and clean, and there was very
  little blood. "It was made by a bullet," said Hanaud &mdash; "some tiny
  bullet from an air-pistol."</p>

  <p>"No," answered the doctor.</p>

  <p>"No knife made it," Hanaud asserted.</p>

  <p>"That is true," said the doctor. "Look!" and he took up from the floor by
  his knee the weapon which had caused Marthe Gobin's death. It was nothing but
  an ordinary skewer with a ring at one end and a sharp point at the other, and
  a piece of common white firewood for a handle. The wood had been split, the
  ring inserted and spliced in position with strong twine. It was a rough
  enough weapon, but an effective one. The proof of its effectiveness lay
  stretched upon the floor beside them.</p>

  <p>Hanaud gave it to the manager of the hotel.</p>

  <p>"You must be very careful of this, and give it as it is to the
  police."</p>

  <p>Then he bent once more over Marthe Gobin.</p>

  <p>"Did she suffer?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"No; death must have been instantaneous," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I am glad of that," said Hanaud, as he rose again to his feet.</p>

  <p>In the doorway the driver of the cab was standing.</p>

  <p>"What has he to say?" Hanaud asked.</p>

  <p>The man stepped forward instantly. He was an old, red-faced, stout man,
  with a shiny white tall hat, like a thousand drivers of cabs.</p>

  <p>"What have I to say, monsieur?" he grumbled in a husky voice. "I take up
  the poor woman at the station and I drive her where she bids me, and I find
  her dead, and my day is lost. Who will pay my fare, monsieur?"</p>

  <p>"I will," said Hanaud. "There it is," and he handed the man a five-franc
  piece. "Now, answer me! Do you tell me that this woman was murdered in your
  cab and that you knew nothing about it?"</p>

  <p>"But what should I know? I take her up at the station, and all the way up
  the hill her head is every moment out of the window, crying, 'Faster,
  faster!' Oh, the good woman was in a hurry! But for me I take no notice. The
  more she shouts, the less I hear; I bury my head between my shoulders, and I
  look ahead of me and I take no notice. One cannot expect cab-horses to run up
  these hills; it is not reasonable." "So you went at a walk," said Hanaud. He
  beckoned to Ricardo, and said to the manager: "M. Besnard will, no doubt, be
  here in a few minutes, and he will send for the Juge d'Instruction. There is
  nothing that we can do."</p>

  <p>He went back to Ricardo's sitting-room and flung himself into a chair. He
  had been calm enough downstairs in the presence of the doctor and the body of
  the victim. Now, with only Ricardo for a witness, he gave way to
  distress.</p>

  <p>"It is terrible," he said. "The poor woman! It was I who brought her to
  Aix. It was through my carelessness. But who would have thought &mdash; ?" He
  snatched his hands from his face and stood up. "I should have thought," he
  said solemnly. "Extraordinary daring &mdash; that was one of the qualities of
  my criminal. I knew it, and I disregarded it. Now we have a second
  crime."</p>

  <p>"The skewer may lead you to the criminal," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"The skewer!" cried Hanaud. "How will that help us? A knife, yes &mdash;
  perhaps. But a skewer!"</p>

  <p>"At the shops &mdash; there will not be so many in Aix at which you can
  buy skewers &mdash; they may remember to whom they sold one within the last
  day or so."</p>

  <p>"How do we know it was bought in the last day or so?" cried Hanaud
  scornfully. "We have not to do with a man who walks into a shop and buys a
  single skewer to commit a murder with, and so hands himself over to the
  police. How often must I say it!"</p>

  <p>The violence of his contempt nettled Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"If the murderer did not buy it, how did he obtain it?" he asked
  obstinately.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my friend, could he not have stolen it? From this or from any hotel
  in Aix? Would the loss of a skewer be noticed, do you think? How many people
  in Aix today have had rognons a la brochette for their luncheon! Besides, it
  is not merely the death of this poor woman which troubles me. We have lost
  the evidence which she was going to bring to us. She had something to tell us
  about Célie Harland which now we shall never hear. We have to begin all over
  again, and I tell you we have not the time to begin all over again. No, we
  have not the time. Time will be lost, and we have no time to lose." He buried
  his face again in his hands and groaned aloud. His grief was so violent and
  so sincere that Ricardo, shocked as he was by the murder of Marthe Gobin, set
  himself to console him.</p>

  <p>"But you could not have foreseen that at three o'clock in the afternoon at
  Aix&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hanaud brushed the excuse aside.</p>

  <p>"It is no extenuation. I OUGHT to have foreseen. Oh, but I will have no
  pity now," he cried, and as he ended the words abruptly his face changed. He
  lifted a trembling forefinger and pointed. There came a sudden look of life
  into his dull and despairing eyes.</p>

  <p>He was pointing to a side-table on which were piled Mr. Ricardo's
  letters.</p>

  <p>"You have not opened them this morning?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No. You came while I was still in bed. I have not thought of them till
  now."</p>

  <p>Hanaud crossed to the table, and, looking down at the letters, uttered a
  cry.</p>

  <p>"There's one, the big envelope," he said, his voice shaking like his hand.
  "It has a Swiss stamp."</p>

  <p>He swallowed to moisten his throat. Ricardo sprang across the room and
  tore open the envelope. There was a long letter enclosed in a handwriting
  unknown to him. He read aloud the first lines of the letter:</p>

  <p>"I write what I saw and post it tonight, so that no one may be before me
  with the news. I will come over tomorrow for the money."</p>

  <p>A low exclamation from Hanaud interrupted the words.</p>

  <p>"The signature! Quick!"</p>

  <p>Ricardo turned to the end of the letter.</p>

  <p>"Marthe Gobin."</p>

  <p>"She speaks, then! After all she speaks!" Hanaud whispered in a voice of
  awe. He ran to the door of the room, opened it suddenly, and, shutting it
  again, locked it. "Quick! We cannot bring that poor woman back to life; but
  we may still&mdash;" He did not finish his sentence. He took the letter
  unceremoniously from Ricardo's hand and seated himself at the table. Over his
  shoulder Mr. Ricardo, too, read Marthe Gobin's letter.</p>

  <p>It was just the sort of letter, which in Ricardo's view, Marthe Gobin
  would have written &mdash; a long, straggling letter which never kept to the
  point, which exasperated them one moment by its folly and fired them to
  excitement the next.</p>

  <p>It was dated from a small suburb of Geneva, on the western side of the
  lake, and it ran as follows:</p>

  <p>"The suburb is but a street close to the lake-side, and a tram runs into
  the city. It is quite respectable, you understand, monsieur, with a hotel at
  the end of it, and really some very good houses. But I do not wish to deceive
  you about the social position of myself or my husband. Our house is on the
  wrong side of the street &mdash; definitely &mdash; yes. It is a small house,
  and we do not see the water from any of the windows because of the better
  houses opposite. M. Gobin, my husband, who was a clerk in one of the great
  banks in Geneva, broke down in health in the spring, and for the last three
  months has been compelled to keep indoors. Of course, money has not been
  plentiful, and I could not afford a nurse. Consequently I myself have been
  compelled to nurse him. Monsieur, if you were a woman, you would know what
  men are when they are ill &mdash; how fretful, how difficult. There is not
  much distraction for the woman who nurses them. So, as I am in the house most
  of the day, I find what amusement I can in watching the doings of my
  neighbours. You will not blame me.</p>

  <p>"A month ago the house almost directly opposite to us was taken furnished
  for the summer by a Mme. Rossignol. She is a widow, but during the last
  fortnight a young gentleman has come several times in the afternoon to see
  her, and it is said in the street that he is going to marry her. But I cannot
  believe it myself. Monsieur is a young man of perhaps thirty, with smooth,
  black hair. He wears a moustache, a little black moustache, and is altogether
  captivating. Mme. Rossignol is five or six years older, I should think
  &mdash; a tall woman, with red hair and a bold sort of coarse beauty. I was
  not attracted by her. She seemed not quite of the same world as that charming
  monsieur who was said to be going to marry her. No; I was not attracted by
  Adele Rossignol."</p>

  <p>And when he had come to that point Hanaud looked up with a start.</p>

  <p>"So the name was Adele," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ricardo. "Helène Vauquier spoke the truth."</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded with a queer smile upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there she spoke the truth. I thought she did."</p>

  <p>"But she said Adele's hair was black," interposed Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there she didn't," said Hanaud drily, and his eyes dropped again to
  the paper.</p>

  <p>"I knew her name was Adele, for often I have heard her servant calling her
  so, and without any 'Madame' in front of the name. That is strange, is it
  not, to hear an elderly servant-woman calling after her mistress, 'Adele,'
  just simple 'Adele'? It was that which made me think monsieur and madame were
  not of the same world. But I do not believe that they are going to be
  married. I have an instinct about it. Of course, one never knows with what
  extraordinary women the nicest men will fall in love. So that after all these
  two may get married. But if they do, I do not think they will be happy.</p>

  <p>"Besides the old woman there was another servant, a man, Hippolyte, who
  served in the house and drove the carriage when it was wanted &mdash; a
  respectable man. He always touched his hat when Mme. Rossignol came out of
  the house. He slept in the house at night, although the stable was at the end
  of the street. I thought he was probably the son of Jeanne, the
  servant-woman. He was young, and his hair was plastered down upon his
  forehead, and he was altogether satisfied with himself and a great favorite
  amongst the servants in the street. The carriage and the horse were hired
  from Geneva. That is the household of Mme. Rossignol."</p>

  <p>So far, Mr. Ricardo read in silence. Then he broke out again.</p>

  <p>"But we have them! The red-haired woman called Adele; the man with the
  little black moustache. It was he who drove the motor-car!"</p>

  <p>Hanaud held up his hand to check the flow of words, and both read on
  again:</p>

  <p>"At three o'clock on Tuesday afternoon madame was driven away in the
  carriage, and I did not see it return all that evening. Of course, it may
  have returned to the stables by another road. But it was not unusual for the
  carriage to take her into Geneva and wait a long time. I went to bed at
  eleven, but in the night M. Gobin was restless, and I rose to get him some
  medicine. We slept in the front of the house, monsieur, and while I was
  searching for the matches upon the table in the middle of the room I heard
  the sound of carriage wheels in the silent street. I went to the window, and,
  raising a corner of the curtains, looked out. M. Gobin called to me fretfully
  from the bed to know why I did not light the candle and get him what he
  wanted. I have already told you how fretful sick men can be, always
  complaining if just for a minute one distracts oneself by looking out of the
  window. But there! One can do nothing to please them. Yet how right I was to
  raise the blind and look out of the window! For if I had obeyed my husband I
  might have lost four thousand francs. And four thousand francs are not to be
  sneezed at by a poor woman whose husband lies in bed.</p>

  <p>"I saw the carriage stop at Mme. Rossignol's house. Almost at once the
  house door was opened by the old servant, although the hall of the house and
  all the windows in the front were dark. That was the first thing that
  surprised me. For when madame came home late and the house was dark, she used
  to let herself in with a latchkey. Now, in the dark house, in the early
  morning, a servant was watching for them. It was strange.</p>

  <p>"As soon as the door of the house was opened the door of the carriage
  opened too, and a young lady stepped quickly out on to the pavement. The
  train of her dress caught in the door, and she turned round, stooped, freed
  it with her hand, and held it up off the ground. The night was clear, and
  there was a lamp in the street close by the door of Mme. Rossignol's house.
  As she turned I saw her face under the big green hat. It was very pretty and
  young, and the hair was fair. She wore a white coat, but it was open in front
  and showed her evening frock of pale green. When she lifted her skirt I saw
  the buckles sparkling on her satin shoes. It was the young lady for whom you
  are advertising, I am sure. She remained standing just for a moment without
  moving, while Mme. Rossignol got out. I was surprised to see a young lady of
  such distinction in Mme. Rossignol's company. Then, still holding her skirt
  up, she ran very lightly and quickly across the pavement into the dark house.
  I thought, monsieur, that she was very anxious not to be seen. So when I saw
  your advertisement I was certain that this was the young lady for whom you
  are searching. "I waited for a few moments and saw the carriage drive off
  towards the stable at the end of the street. But no light went up in any of
  the rooms in front of the house. And M. Gobin was so fretful that I dropped
  the corner of the blind, lit the candle, and gave him his cooling drink. His
  watch was on the table at the bedside, and I saw that it was five minutes to
  three. I will send you a telegram tomorrow, as soon as I am sure at what hour
  I can leave my husband. Accept, monsieur, I beg you, my most distinguished
  salutations.</p>

  <p>"MARTHE GOBIN."</p>

  <p>Hanaud leant back with an extraordinary look of perplexity upon his face.
  But to Ricardo the whole story was now clear. Here was an independent
  witness, without the jealousy or rancours of Helène Vauquier. Nothing could
  be more damning than her statement; it corroborated those footmarks upon the
  soil in front of the glass door of the salon. There was nothing to be done
  except to set about arresting Mlle. Célie at once.</p>

  <p>"The facts work with your theory, M. Hanaud. The young man with the black
  moustache did not return to the house at Geneva. For somewhere upon the road
  close to Geneva he met the carriage. He was driving back the car to
  Aix&mdash;" And then another thought struck him: "But no!" he cried. "We are
  altogether wrong. See! They did not reach home until five minutes to
  three."</p>

  <p>Five minutes to three! But this demolished the whole of Hanaud's theory
  about the motor-car. The murderers had left the villa between eleven and
  twelve, probably before half-past eleven. The car was a machine of sixty
  horse- power, and the roads were certain to be clear. Yet the travellers only
  reached their home at three. Moreover, the car was back in Aix at four. It
  was evident they did not travel by the car.</p>

  <p>"Geneva time is an hour later than French time," said Hanaud shortly. It
  seemed as if the corroboration of this letter disappointed him. "A quarter to
  three in Mme. Gobin's house would be a quarter to two by our watches
  here."</p>

  <p>Hanaud folded up the letter, and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"We will go now, and we will take this letter with us." Hanaud looked
  about the room, and picked up a glove lying upon a table. "I left this behind
  me," he said, putting it into his pocket. "By the way, where is the telegram
  from Marthe Gobin?"</p>

  <p>"You put it in your letter-case."</p>

  <p>"Oh, did I?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud took out his letter-case and found the telegram within it. His face
  lightened.</p>

  <p>"Good!" he said emphatically. "For, since we have this telegram, there
  must have been another message sent from Adele Rossignol to Aix saying that
  Marthe Gobin, that busybody, that inquisitive neighbour, who had no doubt
  seen M. Ricardo's advertisement, was on her way hither. Oh it will not be put
  as crudely as that, but that is what the message will mean. We shall have
  him." And suddenly his face grew very stern. "I MUST catch him, for Marthe
  Gobin's death I cannot forgive. A poor woman meaning no harm, and murdered
  like a sheep under our noses. No, that I cannot forgive."</p>

  <p>Ricardo wondered whether it was the actual murder of Marthe Gobin or the
  fact that he had been beaten and outwitted which Hanaud could not forgive.
  But discretion kept him silent.</p>

  <p>"Let us go," said Hanaud. "By the lift, if you please; it will save
  time."</p>

  <p>They descended into the hall close by the main door. The body of Marthe
  Gobin had been removed to the mortuary of the town. The life of the hotel had
  resumed its course.</p>

  <p>"M. Besnard has gone, I suppose?" Hanaud asked of the porter; and,
  receiving an assent, he walked quickly out of the front door.</p>

  <p>"But there is a shorter way," said Ricardo, running after him: "across the
  garden at the back and down the steps."</p>

  <p>"It will make no difference now," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>They hurried along the drive and down the road which circled round the
  hotel and dipped to the town.</p>

  <p>Behind Hanaud's hotel Ricardo's car was waiting.</p>

  <p>"We must go first to Besnard's office. The poor man will be at his wits'
  end to know who was Mme. Gobin and what brought her to Aix. Besides, I wish
  to send a message over the telephone."</p>

  <p>Hanaud descended and spent a quarter of an hour with the Commissaire. As
  he came out he looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"We shall be in time, I think," he said. He climbed into the car. "The
  murder of Marthe Gobin on her way from the station will put our friends at
  their ease. It will be published, no doubt, in the evening papers, and those
  good people over there in Geneva will read it with amusement. They do not
  know that Marthe Gobin wrote a letter yesterday night. Come, let us go!"</p>

  <p>"Where to?" asked Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Where to?" exclaimed Hanaud. "Why, of course, to Geneva."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"

  <br>
  THE ALUMINIUM FLASK</h2>

  <p class="first">"I have telephoned to Lemerre, the Chef de la Sûreté at
  Geneva," said Hanaud, as the car sped out of Aix along the road to Annecy.
  "He will have the house watched. We shall be in time. They will do nothing
  until dark."</p>

  <p>But though he spoke confidently there was a note of anxiety in his voice,
  and he sat forward in the car, as though he were already straining his eyes
  to see Geneva.</p>

  <p>Ricardo was a trifle disappointed. They were on the great journey to
  Geneva. They were going to arrest Mlle. Célie and her accomplices. And Hanaud
  had not come disguised. Hanaud, in Ricardo's eyes, was hardly living up to
  the dramatic expedition on which they had set out. It seemed to him that
  there was something incorrect in the great detective coming out on the chase
  without a false beard.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear friend, why shouldn't I?" pleaded Hanaud. "We are going to
  dine together at the Restaurant du Nord, over the lake, until it grows dark.
  It is not pleasant to eat one's soup in a false beard. Have you tried it?
  Besides, everybody stares so, seeing perfectly well that it is false. Now, I
  do not want tonight that people should know me for a detective; so I do not
  go disguised."</p>

  <p>"Humorist!" said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"There! you have found me out!" cried Hanaud, in mock alarm. "Besides, I
  told you this morning that that is precisely what I am."</p>

  <p>Beyond Annecy, they came to the bridge over the ravine. At the far end of
  it, the car stopped. A question, a hurried glance into the body of the car,
  and the officers of the Customs stood aside.</p>

  <p>"You see how perfunctory it is," said Hanaud and with a jerk the car moved
  on. The jerk threw Hanaud against Mr. Ricardo. Something hard in the
  detective's pocket knocked against his companion.</p>

  <p>"You have got them?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"The handcuffs."</p>

  <p>Another disappointment awaited Ricardo. A detective without a false beard
  was bad enough, but that was nothing to a detective without handcuffs. The
  paraphernalia of justice were sadly lacking. However, Hanaud consoled Mr.
  Ricardo by showing him the hard thing; it was almost as thrilling as the
  handcuffs, for it was a loaded revolver.</p>

  <p>"There will be danger, then?" said Ricardo, with a tremor of excitement.
  "I should have brought mine."</p>

  <p>"There would have been danger, my friend," Hanaud objected gravely, "if
  you had brought yours."</p>

  <p>They reached Geneva as the dusk was falling, and drove straight to the
  restaurant by the side of the lake and mounted to the balcony on the first
  floor. A small, stout man sat at a table alone in a corner of the balcony. He
  rose and held out his hands.</p>

  <p>"My friend, M. Lemerre, the Chef de la Sûreté of Geneva," said Hanaud,
  presenting the little man to his companion.</p>

  <p>There were as yet only two couples dining in the restaurant, and Hanaud
  spoke so that neither could overhear him. He sat down at the table.</p>

  <p>"What news?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None," said Lemerre. "No one has come out of the house, no one has gone
  in."</p>

  <p>"And if anything happens while we dine?"</p>

  <p>"We shall know," said Lemerre. "Look, there is a man loitering under the
  trees there. He will strike a match to light his pipe."</p>

  <p>The hurried conversation was ended.</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hanaud. "We will dine, then, and be gay."</p>

  <p>He called to the waiter and ordered dinner. It was after seven when they
  sat down to dinner, and they dined while the dusk deepened. In the street
  below the lights flashed out, throwing a sheen on the foliage of the trees at
  the water's side. Upon the dark lake the reflections of lamps rippled and
  shook. A boat in which musicians sang to music, passed by with a cool splash
  of oars. The green and red lights of the launches glided backwards and
  forwards. Hanaud alone of the party on the balcony tried to keep the
  conversation upon a light and general level. But it was plain that even he
  was overdoing his gaiety. There were moments when a sudden contraction of the
  muscles would clench his hands and give a spasmodic jerk to his shoulders. He
  was waiting uneasily, uncomfortably, until darkness should come.</p>

  <p>"Eat," he cried &mdash; "eat, my friends," playing with his own barely
  tasted food.</p>

  <p>And then, at a sentence from Lemerre, his knife and fork clattered on his
  plate, and he sat with a face suddenly grown white.</p>

  <p>For Lemerre said, as though it was no more than a matter of ordinary
  comment:</p>

  <p>"So Mme. Dauvray's jewels were, after all, never stolen?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud started.</p>

  <p>"You know that? How did you know it?"</p>

  <p>"It was in this evening's paper. I bought one on the way here. They were
  found under the floor of the bedroom."</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke a newsboy's voice rang out in the street below them.
  Lemerre was alarmed by the look upon his friend's face.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter, Hanaud?" he asked, with some solicitude.</p>

  <p>"It matters&mdash;" and Hanaud rose up abruptly.</p>

  <p>The boy's voice sounded louder in the street below. The words became
  distinct to all upon that balcony.</p>

  <p>"The Aix murder! Discovery of the jewels!"</p>

  <p>"We must go," Hanaud whispered hoarsely. "Here are life and death in the
  balance, as I believe, and there" &mdash; he pointed down to the little group
  gathering about the newsboy under the trees &mdash; "there is the command
  which way to tip the scales."</p>

  <p>"It was not I who sent it," said Ricardo eagerly.</p>

  <p>He had no precise idea what Hanaud meant by his words; but he realised
  that the sooner he exculpated himself from the charge the better.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was not you. I know that very well," said Hanaud. He called
  for the bill. "When is that paper published?"</p>

  <p>"At seven," said Lemerre.</p>

  <p>"They have been crying it in the streets of Geneva, then, for more than
  half an hour."</p>

  <p>He sat drumming impatiently upon the table until the bill should be
  brought.</p>

  <p>"By Heaven, that's clever!" he muttered savagely. "There's a man who gets
  ahead of me at every turn. See, Lemerre, I take every care, every precaution,
  that no message shall be sent. I let it be known, I take careful pains to let
  it be known, that no message can be sent without detection following, and
  here's the message sent by the one channel I never thought to guard against
  and stop. Look!"</p>

  <p>The murder at the Villa Rose and the mystery which hid its perpetration
  had aroused interest. This new development had quickened it. From the balcony
  Hanaud could see the groups thickening about the boy and the white sheets of
  the newspapers in the hands of passers-by.</p>

  <p>"Every one in Geneva or near Geneva will know of this message by now."</p>

  <p>"Who could have told?" asked Ricardo blankly, and Hanaud laughed in his
  face, but laughed without any merriment.</p>

  <p>"At last!" he cried, as the waiter brought the bill, and just as he had
  paid it the light of a match flared up under the trees.</p>

  <p>"The signal!" said Lemerre.</p>

  <p>"Not too quickly," whispered Hanaud.</p>

  <p>With as much unconcern as each could counterfeit, the three men descended
  the stairs and crossed the road. Under the trees a fourth man joined them
  &mdash; he who had lighted his pipe.</p>

  <p>"The coachman, Hippolyte," he whispered, "bought an evening paper at the
  front door of the house from a boy who came down the street shouting the
  news. The coachman ran back into the house."</p>

  <p>"When was this?" asked Lemerre.</p>

  <p>The man pointed to a lad who leaned against the balustrade above the lake,
  hot and panting for breath.</p>

  <p>"He came on his bicycle. He has just arrived."</p>

  <p>"Follow me," said Lemerre.</p>

  <p>Six yards from where they stood a couple of steps led down from the
  embankment on to a wooden landing-stage, where boats were moored. Lemerre,
  followed by the others, walked briskly down on to the landing-stage. An
  electric launch was waiting. It had an awning and was of the usual type which
  one hires at Geneva. There were two sergeants in plain clothes on board, and
  a third man, whom Ricardo recognised.</p>

  <p>"That is the man who found out in whose shop the cord was bought," he said
  to Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is Durette. He has been here since yesterday."</p>

  <p>Lemerre and the three who followed him stepped into it, and it backed away
  from the stage and, turning, sped swiftly outwards from Geneva. The gay
  lights of the shops and the restaurants were left behind, the cool darkness
  enveloped them; a light breeze blew over the lake, a trail of white and
  tumbled water lengthened out behind and overhead, in a sky of deepest blue,
  the bright stars shone like gold.</p>

  <p>"If only we are in time!" said Hanaud, catching his breath.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Lemerre; and in both their voices there was a strange note
  of gravity.</p>

  <p>Lemerre gave a signal after a while, and the boat turned to the shore and
  reduced its speed. They had passed the big villas. On the bank the gardens of
  houses &mdash; narrow, long gardens of a street of small houses &mdash;
  reached down to the lake, and to almost each garden there was a rickety
  landing-stage of wood projecting into the lake. Again Lemerre gave a signal,
  and the boat's speed was so much reduced that not a sound of its coming could
  be heard. It moved over the water like a shadow, with not so much as a curl
  of white at its bows.</p>

  <p>Lemerre touched Hanaud on the shoulder and pointed to a house in a row of
  houses. All the windows except two upon the second floor and one upon the
  ground floor were in absolute darkness, and over those upper two the wooden
  shutters were closed. But in the shutters there were diamond-shaped holes,
  and from these holes two yellow beams of light, like glowing eyes upon the
  watch, streamed out and melted in the air.</p>

  <p>"You are sure that the front of the house is guarded?" asked Hanaud
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Lemerre.</p>

  <p>Ricardo shivered with excitement. The launch slid noiselessly into the
  bank and lay hidden under its shadow. Hanaud turned to his associates with
  his finger to his lips. Something gleamed darkly in his hand. It was the
  barrel of his revolver. Cautiously the men disembarked and crept up the bank.
  First came Lemerre, then Hanaud; Ricardo followed him, and the fourth man,
  who had struck the match under the trees, brought up the rear. The other
  three officers remained in the boat.</p>

  <p>Stooping under the shadow of the side wall of the garden, the invaders
  stole towards the house. When a bush rustled or a tree whispered in the light
  wind, Ricardo's heart jumped to his throat. Once Lemerre stopped, as though
  his ears heard a sound which warned him of danger. Then cautiously he crept
  on again. The garden was a ragged place of unmown lawn and straggling bushes.
  Behind each one Mr. Ricardo seemed to feel an enemy. Never had he been in so
  strait a predicament. He, the cultured host of Grosvenor Square, was creeping
  along under a wall with Continental policemen; he was going to raid a
  sinister house by the Lake of Geneva. It was thrilling. Fear and excitement
  gripped him in turn and let him go, but always he was sustained by the pride
  of the man doing an out-of-the-way thing. "If only my friends could see me
  now!" The ancient vanity was loud in his bosom. Poor fellows, they were upon
  yachts in the Solent or on grouse-moors in Scotland, or on golf-links at
  North Berwick. He alone of them all was tracking malefactors to their doom by
  Leman's Lake.</p>

  <p>From these agreeable reflections Ricardo was shaken. Lemerre stopped. The
  raiders had reached the angle made by the side wall of the garden and the
  house. A whisper was exchanged, and the party turned and moved along the
  house wall towards the lighted window on the ground floor. As Lemerre reached
  it he stooped. Then slowly his forehead and his eyes rose above the sill and
  glanced this way and that into the room. Mr. Ricardo could see his eyes
  gleaming as the light from the window caught them. His face rose completely
  over the sill. He stared into the room without care or apprehension, and then
  dropped again out of the reach of the light. He turned to Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"The room is empty," he whispered. Hanaud turned to Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Pass under the sill, or the light from the window will throw your shadow
  upon the lawn."</p>

  <p>The party came to the back door of the house. Lemerre tried the handle of
  the door, and to his surprise it yielded. They crept into the passage. The
  last man closed the door noiselessly, locked it, and removed the key. A panel
  of light shone upon the wall a few paces ahead. The door of the lighted room
  was open. As Ricardo stepped silently past it, he looked in. It was a parlour
  meanly furnished. Hanaud touched him on the arm and pointed to the table.</p>

  <p>Ricardo had seen the objects at which Hanaud pointed often enough without
  uneasiness; but now, in this silent house of crime, they had the most
  sinister and appalling aspect. There was a tiny phial half full of a
  dark-brown liquid, beside it a little leather case lay open, and across the
  case, ready for use or waiting to be filled, was a bright morphia needle.
  Ricardo felt the cold creep along his spine, and shivered.</p>

  <p>"Come," whispered Hanaud.</p>

  <p>They reached the foot of a flight of stairs, and cautiously mounted it.
  They came out in a passage which ran along the side of the house from the
  back to the front. It was unlighted, but they were now on the level of the
  street, and a fan-shaped glass window over the front door admitted a pale
  light. There was a street lamp near to the door, Ricardo remembered. For by
  the light of it Marthe Gobin had seen Celia Harland run so nimbly into this
  house.</p>

  <p>For a moment the men in the passage held their breath. Some one strode
  heavily by on the pavement outside &mdash; to Mr. Ricardo's ear a most
  companionable sound. Then a clock upon a church struck the half-hour
  musically, distantly. It was half-past eight. And a second afterwards a tiny
  bright light shone. Hanaud was directing the light of a pocket electric torch
  to the next flight of stairs.</p>

  <p>Here the steps were carpeted, and once more the men crept up. One after
  another they came out upon the next landing. It ran, like those below it,
  along the side of the house from the back to the front, and the doors were
  all upon their left hand. From beneath the door nearest to them a yellow line
  of light streamed out.</p>

  <p>They stood in the darkness listening. But not a sound came from behind the
  door. Was this room empty, too? In each one's mind was the fear that the
  birds had flown. Lemerre carefully took the handle of the door and turned it.
  Very slowly and cautiously he opened the door. A strong light beat out
  through the widening gap upon his face. And then, though his feet did not
  move, his shoulders and his face drew back. The action was significant
  enough. This room, at all events, was not empty. But of what Lemerre saw in
  the room his face gave no hint. He opened the door wider, and now Hanaud saw.
  Ricardo, trembling with excitement, watched him. But again there was no
  expression of surprise, consternation, or delight. He stood stolidly and
  watched. Then he turned to Ricardo, placed a finger on his lips, and made
  room. Ricardo crept on tiptoe to his side. And now he too could look in. He
  saw a brightly lit bedroom with a made bed. On his left were the shuttered
  windows overlooking the lake. On his right in the partition wall a door stood
  open. Through the door he could see a dark, windowless closet, with a small
  bed from which the bedclothes hung and trailed upon the floor, as though some
  one had been but now roughly dragged from it. On a table, close by the door,
  lay a big green hat with a brown ostrich feather, and a white cloak. But the
  amazing spectacle which kept him riveted was just in front of him. An old hag
  of a woman was sitting in a chair with her back towards them. She was mending
  with a big needle the holes in an old sack, and while she bent over her work
  she crooned to herself some French song. Every now and then she raised her
  eyes, for in front of her, under her charge, Mlle. Célie, the girl of whom
  Hanaud was in search, lay helpless upon a sofa. The train of her delicate
  green frock swept the floor. She was dressed as Helène Vauquier had
  described. Her gloved hands were tightly bound behind her back, her feet were
  crossed so that she could not have stood, and her ankles were cruelly
  strapped together. Over her face and eyes a piece of coarse sacking was
  stretched like a mask, and the ends were roughly sewn together at the back of
  her head. She lay so still that, but for the labouring of her bosom and a
  tremor which now and again shook her limbs, the watchers would have thought
  her dead. She made no struggle of resistance; she lay quiet and still. Once
  she writhed, but it was with the uneasiness of one in pain, and the moment
  she stirred the old woman's hand went out to a bright aluminium flask which
  stood on a little table at her side.</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet, little one!" she ordered in a careless, chiding voice, and
  she rapped with the flask peremptorily upon the table. Immediately, as though
  the tapping had some strange message of terror for the girl's ear, she
  stiffened her whole body and lay rigid.</p>

  <p>"I am not ready for you yet, little fool," said the old woman, and she
  bent again to her work.</p>

  <p>Ricardo's brain whirled. Here was the girl whom they had come to arrest,
  who had sprung from the salon with so much activity of youth across the
  stretch of grass, who had run so quickly and lightly across the pavement into
  this very house, so that she should not be seen. And now she was lying in her
  fine and delicate attire a captive, at the mercy of the very people who were
  her accomplices.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a scream rang out in the garden &mdash; a shrill, loud scream,
  close beneath the windows. The old woman sprang to her feet. The girl on the
  sofa raised her head. The old woman took a step towards the window, and then
  she swiftly turned towards the door. She saw the men upon the threshold. She
  uttered a bellow of rage. There is no other word to describe the sound. It
  was not a human cry; it was the bellow of an angry animal. She reached out
  her hand towards the flask, but before she could grasp it Hanaud seized her.
  She burst into a torrent of foul oaths. Hanaud flung her across to Lemerre's
  officer, who dragged her from the room.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" said Hanaud, pointing to the girl, who was now struggling
  helplessly upon the sofa. "Mlle. Célie!"</p>

  <p>Ricardo cut the stitches of the sacking. Hanaud unstrapped her hands and
  feet. They helped her to sit up. She shook her hands in the air as though
  they tortured her, and then, in a piteous, whimpering voice, like a child's,
  she babbled incoherently and whispered prayers. Suddenly the prayers ceased.
  She sat stiff, with eyes fixed and staring. She was watching Lemerre, and she
  was watching him fascinated with terror. He was holding in his hand the
  large, bright aluminium flask. He poured a little of the contents very
  carefully on to a piece of the sack; and then with an exclamation of anger he
  turned towards Hanaud. But Hanaud was supporting Celia; and so, as Lemerre
  turned abruptly towards him with the flask in his hand, he turned abruptly
  towards Celia too. She wrenched herself from Hanaud's arms, she shrank
  violently away. Her white face flushed scarlet and grew white again. She
  screamed loudly, terribly; and after the scream she uttered a strange, weak
  sigh, and so fell sideways in a swoon. Hanaud caught her as she fell. A light
  broke over his face.</p>

  <p>"Now I understand!" he cried. "Good God! That's horrible."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13"><small>CHAPTER 13</small></a><br>
  <br>
  IN THE HOUSE AT GENEVA</h2>

  <p class="first">It was well, Mr. Ricardo thought, that some one understood.
  For himself, he frankly admitted that he did not. Indeed, in his view the
  first principles of reasoning seemed to be set at naught. It was obvious from
  the solicitude with which Celia Harland was surrounded that every one except
  himself was convinced of her innocence. Yet it was equally obvious that any
  one who bore in mind the eight points he had tabulated against her must be
  convinced of her guilt. Yet again, if she were guilty, how did it happen that
  she had been so mishandled by her accomplices? He was not allowed however, to
  reflect upon these remarkable problems. He had too busy a time of it. At one
  moment he was running to fetch water wherewith to bathe Celia's forehead. At
  another, when he had returned with the water, he was distracted by the
  appearance of Durette, the inspector from Aix, in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"We have them both," he said &mdash; "Hippolyte and the woman. They were
  hiding in the garden."</p>

  <p>"So I thought," said Hanaud, "when I saw the door open downstairs, and the
  morphia-needle on the table."</p>

  <p>Lemerre turned to one of the officers.</p>

  <p>"Let them be taken with old Jeanne in cabs to the depot."</p>

  <p>And when the man had gone upon his errand Lemerre spoke to Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"You will stay here tonight to arrange for their transfer to Aix?"</p>

  <p>"I will leave Durette behind," said Hanaud. "I am needed at Aix. We will
  make a formal application for the prisoners." He was kneeling by Celia's side
  and awkwardly dabbing her forehead with a wet handkerchief. He raised a
  warning hand. Celia Harland moved and opened her eyes. She sat up on the
  sofa, shivering, and looked with dazed and wondering eyes from one to another
  of the strangers who surrounded her. She searched in vain for a familiar
  face.</p>

  <p>"You are amongst good friends. Mlle. Célie," said Hanaud with great
  gentleness.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wonder! I wonder!" she cried piteously.</p>

  <p>"Be very sure of it," he said heartily, and she clung to the sleeve of his
  coat with desperate hands.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are friends," she said; "else why &mdash; ?" and she moved
  her numbed limbs to make certain that she was free. She looked about the
  room. Her eyes fell upon the sack and widened with terror.</p>

  <p>"They came to me a little while ago in that cupboard there &mdash; Adele
  and the old woman Jeanne. They made me get up. They told me they were going
  to take me away. They brought my clothes and dressed me in everything I wore
  when I came, so that no single trace of me might be left behind. Then they
  tied me." She tore off her gloves and showed them her lacerated wrists. "I
  think they meant to kill me &mdash; horribly." And she caught her breath and
  whimpered like a child. Her spirit was broken.</p>

  <p>"My poor girl, all that is over," said Hanaud. And he stood up.</p>

  <p>But at the first movement he made she cried incisively, "No," and
  tightened the clutch of her fingers upon his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"But, mademoiselle, you are safe," he said, with a smile. She stared at
  him stupidly. It seemed the words had no meaning for her. She would not let
  him go. It was only the feel of his coat within the clutch of her fingers
  which gave her any comfort.</p>

  <p>"I want to be sure that I am safe," she said, with a wan little smile.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, mademoiselle, what have you had to eat and drink during the last
  two days?"</p>

  <p>"Is it two days?" she asked. "I was in the dark there. I did not know. A
  little bread, a little water."</p>

  <p>"That's what is wrong," said Hanaud. "Come, let us go from here!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" Celia cried eagerly. She rose to her feet, and tottered.
  Hanaud put his arm about her. "You are very kind," she said in a low voice,
  and again doubt looked out from her face and disappeared. "I am sure that I
  can trust you."</p>

  <p>Ricardo fetched her cloak and slipped it on her shoulders. Then he brought
  her hat, and she pinned it on. She turned to Hanaud; unconsciously familiar
  words rose to her lips.</p>

  <p>"Is it straight?" she asked. And Hanaud laughed outright, and in a moment
  Celia smiled herself.</p>

  <p>Supported by Hanaud she stumbled down the stairs to the garden. As they
  passed the open door of the lighted parlour at the back of the house Hanaud
  turned back to Lemerre and pointed silently to the morphia-needle and the
  phial. Lemerre nodded his head, and going into the room took them away. They
  went out again into the garden. Celia Harland threw back her head to the
  stars and drew in a deep breath of the cool night air.</p>

  <p>"I did not think," she said in a low voice, "to see the stars again."</p>

  <p>They walked slowly down the length of the garden, and Hanaud lifted her
  into the launch. She turned and caught his coat.</p>

  <p>"You must come too," she said stubbornly.</p>

  <p>Hanaud sprang in beside her.</p>

  <p>"For tonight," he said gaily, "I am your papa!"</p>

  <p>Ricardo and the others followed, and the launch moved out over the lake
  under the stars. The bow was turned towards Geneva, the water tumbled behind
  them like white fire, the night breeze blew fresh upon their faces. They
  disembarked at the landing-stage, and then Lemerre bowed to Celia and took
  his leave. Hanaud led Celia up on to the balcony of the restaurant and
  ordered supper. There were people still dining at the tables.</p>

  <p>One party indeed sitting late over their coffee Ricardo recognised with a
  kind of shock. They had taken their places, the very places in which they now
  sat, before he and Hanaud and Lemerre had left the restaurant upon their
  expedition of rescue. Into that short interval of time so much that was
  eventful had been crowded.</p>

  <p>Hanaud leaned across the table to Celia and said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, if I may suggest it, it would be as well if you put on your
  gloves; otherwise they may notice your wrists."</p>

  <p>Celia followed his advice. She ate some food and drank a glass of
  champagne. A little colour returned to her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind to me, you and monsieur your friend," she said, with a
  smile towards Ricardo. "But for you&mdash;" and her voice shook.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Hanaud &mdash; "all that is over; we will not speak of
  it."</p>

  <p>Celia looked out across the road on to the trees, of which the dark
  foliage was brightened and made pale by the lights of the restaurant. Out on
  the water some one was singing.</p>

  <p>"It seems impossible to me," she said in a low voice, "that I am here, in
  the open air, and free."</p>

  <p>Hanaud looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Mlle. Célie, it is past ten o'clock. M. Ricardo's car is waiting there
  under the trees. I want you to drive back to Aix. I have taken rooms for you
  at an hotel, and there will be a nurse from the hospital to look after
  you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, monsieur," she said; "you have thought of everything. But I
  shall not need a nurse."</p>

  <p>"But you will have a nurse," said Hanaud firmly. "You feel stronger now
  &mdash; yes, but when you lay your head upon your pillow, mademoiselle, it
  will be a comfort to you to know that you have her within call. And in a day
  or two," he added gently, "you will perhaps be able to tell us what happened
  on Tuesday night at the Villa Rose?"</p>

  <p>Celia covered her face with her hands for a few moments. Then she drew
  them away and said simply:</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur, I will tell you."</p>

  <p>Hanaud bowed to her with a genuine deference.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, mademoiselle," he said, and in his voice there was a strong
  ring of sympathy.</p>

  <p>They went downstairs and entered Ricardo's motor car.</p>

  <p>"I want to send a telephone message," said Hanaud, "if you will wait
  here."</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Celia decisively, and she again laid hold of his coat, with a
  pretty imperiousness, as though he belonged to her.</p>

  <p>"But I must," said Hanaud with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Then I will come too," said Celia, and she opened the door and set a foot
  upon the step.</p>

  <p>"You will not, mademoiselle," said Hanaud, with a laugh. "Will you take
  your foot back into that car? That is better. Now you will sit with your
  friend, M. Ricardo, whom, by the way, I have not yet introduced to you. He is
  a very good friend of yours, mademoiselle, and will in the future be a still
  better one."</p>

  <p>Ricardo felt his conscience rather heavy within him, for he had come out
  to Geneva with the fixed intention of arresting her as a most dangerous
  criminal. Even now he could not understand how she could be innocent of a
  share in Mme. Dauvray's murder. But Hanaud evidently thought she was. And
  since Hanaud thought so, why, it was better to say nothing if one was
  sensitive to gibes. So Ricardo sat and talked with her while Hanaud ran back
  into the restaurant. It mattered very little, however, what he said, for
  Celia's eyes were fixed upon the doorway through which Hanaud had
  disappeared. And when he came back she was quick to turn the handle of the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Now, mademoiselle, we will wrap you up in M. Ricardo's spare motor-coat
  and cover your knees with a rug and put you between us, and then you can go
  to sleep."</p>

  <p>The car sped through the streets of Geneva. Celia Harland, with a little
  sigh of relief, nestled down between the two men.</p>

  <p>"If I knew you better," she said to Hanaud, "I should tell you &mdash;
  what, of course, I do not tell you now &mdash; that I feel as if I had a big
  Newfoundland dog with me."</p>

  <p>"Mlle. Célie," said Hanaud, and his voice told her that he was moved,
  "that is a very pretty thing which you have said to me."</p>

  <p>The lights of the city fell away behind them. Now only a glow in the sky
  spoke of Geneva; now even that was gone and with a smooth continuous purr the
  car raced through the cool darkness. The great head lamps threw a bright
  circle of light before them and the road slipped away beneath the wheels like
  a running tide. Celia fell asleep. Even when the car stopped at the Pont de
  La Caille she did not waken. The door was opened, a search for contrabrand
  was made, the book was signed, still she did not wake. The car sped on.</p>

  <p>"You see, coming into France is a different affair," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Still, I will own it, you caught me napping yesterday.</p>

  <p>"I did?" exclaimed Ricardo joyfully.</p>

  <p>"You did," returned Hanaud. "I had never heard of the Pont de La Caille.
  But you will not mention it? You will not ruin me?"</p>

  <p>"I will not," answered. M. Ricardo, superb in his magnanimity. "You are a
  good detective."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you! thank you!" cried Hanaud in a voice which shook &mdash;
  surely with emotion. He wrung Ricardo's hand. He wiped an imaginary tear from
  his eye.</p>

  <p>And still Celia slept. M. Ricardo looked at her. He said to Hanaud in a
  whisper:</p>

  <p>"Yet I do not understand. The car, though no serious search was made, must
  still have stopped at the Pont de La Caille on the Swiss side. Why did she
  not cry for help then? One cry and she was safe. A movement even was enough.
  Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"I think so," he answered, with a very gentle look at Celia. "Yes, I think
  so."</p>

  <p>When Celia was aroused she found that the car had stopped before the door
  of an hotel, and that a woman in the dress of a nurse was standing in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"You can trust Marie," said Hanaud. And Celia turned as she stood upon the
  ground and gave her hands to the two men.</p>

  <p>"Thank you! Thank you both!" she said in a trembling voice. She looked at
  Hanaud and nodded her head. "You understand why I thank you so very
  much?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hanaud. "But, mademoiselle" &mdash; and he bent over the car
  and spoke to her quietly, holding her hand &mdash; "there is <i>always</i> a
  big Newfoundland dog in the worst of troubles &mdash; if only you will look
  for him. I tell you so &mdash; I, who belong to the Sûreté in Paris. Do not
  lose heart!" And in his mind he added: "God forgive me for the lie." He shook
  her hand and let it go; and gathering up her skirt she went into the hall of
  the hotel.</p>

  <p>Hanaud watched her as she went. She was to him a lonely and pathetic
  creature, in spite of the nurse who bore her company.</p>

  <p>"You must be a good friend to that young girl, M. Ricardo," he said. "Let
  us drive to your hotel."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ricardo. And as they went the curiosity which all the way from
  Geneva had been smouldering within him burst into flame.</p>

  <p>"Will you explain to me one thing?" he asked. "When the scream came from
  the garden you were not surprised. Indeed, you said that when you saw the
  open door and the morphia-needle on the table of the little room downstairs
  you thought Adele and the man Hippolyte were hiding in the garden."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did think so."</p>

  <p>"Why? And why did the publication that the jewels had been discovered so
  alarm you?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Hanaud. "Did not you understand that? Yet it is surely clear
  and obvious, if you once grant that the girl was innocent, was a witness of
  the crime, and was now in the hands of the criminals. Grant me those
  premisses, M. Ricardo, for a moment, and you will see that we had just one
  chance of finding the girl alive in Geneva. From the first I was sure of
  that. What was the one chance? Why, this! She might be kept alive on the
  chance that she could be forced to tell what, by the way, she did not know,
  namely, the place where Mme. Dauvray's valuable jewels were secreted. Now,
  follow this. We, the police, find the jewels and take charge of them. Let
  that news reach the house in Geneva, and on the same night Mlle. Célie loses
  her life, and not &mdash; very pleasantly. They have no further use for her.
  She is merely a danger to them. So I take my precautions &mdash; never mind
  for the moment what they were. I take care that if the murderer is in Aix and
  gets wind of our discovery he shall not be able to communicate his news."</p>

  <p>"The Post Office would have stopped letters or telegrams," said Ricardo.
  "I understand."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," replied Hanaud. "No, I took my precautions, which were
  of quite a different kind, before I knew the house in Geneva or the name of
  Rossignol. But one way of communication I did not think of. I did not think
  of the possibility that the news might be sent to a newspaper, which of
  course would publish it and cry it through the streets of Geneva. The moment
  I heard the news I knew we must hurry. The garden of the house ran down to
  the lake. A means of disposing of Mlle. Célie was close at hand. And the
  night had fallen. As it was, we arrived just in time, and no earlier than
  just in time. The paper had been bought, the message had reached the house,
  Mlle. Célie was no longer of any use, and every hour she stayed in that house
  was of course an hour of danger to her captors."</p>

  <p>"What were they going to do?" asked Ricardo.</p>

  <p>Hanaud shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is not pretty &mdash; what they were going to do. We reach the garden
  in our launch. At that moment Hippolyte and Adele, who is most likely
  Hippolyte's wife, are in the lighted parlour on the basement floor. Adele is
  preparing her morphia-needle. Hippolyte is going to get ready the rowing-boat
  which was tied at the end of the landing-stage. Quietly as we came into the
  bank, they heard or saw us. They ran out and hid in the garden, having no
  time to lock the garden door, or perhaps not daring to lock it lest the sound
  of the key should reach our ears. We find that door upon the latch, the door
  of the room open; on the table lies the morphia-needle. Upstairs lies Mlle.
  Célie &mdash; she is helpless, she cannot see what they are meaning to
  do."</p>

  <p>"But she could cry out," exclaimed Ricardo. "She did not even do
  that!"</p>

  <p>"No, my friend, she could not cry out," replied Hanaud very seriously. "I
  know why. She could not. No living man or woman could. Rest assured of
  that!"</p>

  <p>Ricardo was mystified; but since the captain of the ship would not show
  his observation, he knew it would be in vain to press him.</p>

  <p>"Well, while Adele was preparing her morphia-needle and Hippolyte was
  about to prepare the boat, Jeanne upstairs was making her preparation too.
  She was mending a sack. Did you see Mlle. Célie's eyes and face when first
  she saw that sack? Ah! she understood! They meant to give her a dose of
  morphia, and, as soon as she became unconscious, they were going perhaps to
  take some terrible precaution&mdash;" Hanaud paused for a second. "I only say
  perhaps as to that. But certainly they were going to sew her up in that sack,
  row her well out across the lake, fix a weight to her feet, and drop her
  quietly overboard. She was to wear everything which she had brought with her
  to the house. Mlle. Célie would have disappeared for ever, and left not even
  a ripple upon the water to trace her by!"</p>

  <p>Ricardo clenched his hands.</p>

  <p>"But that's horrible!" he cried; and as he uttered the words the car
  swerved into the drive and stopped before the door of the Hotel Majestic.</p>

  <p>Ricardo sprang out. A feeling of remorse seized hold of him. All through
  that evening he had not given one thought to Harry Wethermill, so utterly had
  the excitement of each moment engrossed his mind.</p>

  <p>"He will be glad to know!" cried Ricardo. "Tonight, at all events, he
  shall sleep. I ought to have telegraphed to him from Geneva that we and Miss
  Celia were coming back." He ran up the steps into the hotel.</p>

  <p>"I took care that he should know," said Hanaud, as he followed in
  Ricardo's steps.</p>

  <p>"Then the message could not have reached him, else he would have been
  expecting us," replied Ricardo, as he hurried into the office, where a clerk
  sat at his books.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Wethermill in?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The clerk eyed him strangely.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wethermill was arrested this evening," he said.</p>

  <p>Ricardo stepped back.</p>

  <p>"Arrested! When?"</p>

  <p>"At twenty-five minutes past ten," replied the clerk shortly.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Hanaud quietly. "That was my telephone message."</p>

  <p>Ricardo stared in stupefaction at his companion.</p>

  <p>"Arrested!" he cried. "Arrested! But what for?"</p>

  <p>"For the murders of Marthe Gobin and Mme. Dauvray," said Hanaud. "Good-
  night."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14"><small>CHAPTER 14</small></a><br>
  <br>
  MR. RICARDO IS BEWILDERED</h2>

  <p class="first">Ricardo passed a most tempestuous night. He was tossed
  amongst dark problems. Now it was Harry Wethermill who beset him. He repeated
  and repeated the name, trying to grasp the new and sinister suggestion which,
  if Hanaud were right, its sound must henceforth bear. Of course Hanaud might
  be wrong. Only, if he were wrong, how had he come to suspect Harry
  Wethermill? What had first directed his thoughts to that seemingly
  heart-broken man? And when? Certain recollections became vivid in Mr.
  Ricardo's mind &mdash; the luncheon at the Villa Rose, for instance. Hanaud
  had been so insistent that the woman with the red hair was to be found in
  Geneva, had so clearly laid it down that a message, a telegram, a letter from
  Aix to Geneva, would enable him to lay his hands upon the murderer in Aix. He
  was isolating the house in Geneva even so early in the history of his
  investigations, even so soon he suspected Harry Wethermill. Brains and
  audacity &mdash; yes, these two qualities he had stipulated in the criminal.
  Ricardo now for the first time understood the trend of all Hanaud's talk at
  that luncheon. He was putting Harry Wethermill upon his guard, he was
  immobilising him, he was fettering him in precautions; with a subtle skill he
  was forcing him to isolate himself. And he was doing it deliberately to save
  the life of Celia Harland in Geneva. Once Ricardo lifted himself up with the
  hair stirring on his scalp. He himself had been with Wethermill in the
  baccarat- rooms on the very night of the murder. They had walked together up
  the hill to the hotel. It could not be that Harry Wethermill was guilty. And
  yet, he suddenly remembered, they had together left the rooms at an early
  hour. It was only ten o'clock when they had separated in the hall, when they
  had gone, each to his own room. There would have been time for Wethermill to
  reach the Villa Rose and do his dreadful work upon that night before twelve,
  if all had been arranged beforehand, if all went as it had been arranged. And
  as he thought upon the careful planning of that crime, and remembered
  Wethermill's easy chatter as they had strolled from table to table in the
  Villa des Fleurs, Ricardo shuddered. Though he encouraged a taste for the
  bizarre, it was with an effort. He was naturally of an orderly mind, and to
  touch the eerie or inhuman caused him a physical discomfort. So now he
  marvelled in a great uneasiness at the calm placidity with which Wethermill
  had talked, his arm in his, while the load of so dark a crime to be committed
  within the hour lay upon his mind. Each minute he must have been thinking,
  with a swift spasm of the heart, "Should such a precaution fail &mdash;
  should such or such an unforeseen thing intervene," yet there had been never
  a sign of disturbance, never a hint of any disquietude.</p>

  <p>Then Ricardo's thoughts turned as he tossed upon his bed to Celia Harland,
  a tragic and a lonely figure. He recalled the look of tenderness upon her
  face when her eyes had met Harry Wethermill's across the baccarat-table in
  the Villa des Fleurs. He gained some insight into the reason why she had
  clung so desperately to Hanaud's coat-sleeve yesterday. Not merely had he
  saved her life. She was lying with all her world of trust and illusion broken
  about her, and Hanaud had raised her up. She had found some one whom she
  trusted &mdash; the big Newfoundland dog, as she expressed it. Mr. Ricardo
  was still thinking of Celia Harland when the morning came. He fell asleep,
  and awoke to find Hanaud by his bed.</p>

  <p>"You will be wanted today," said Hanaud.</p>

  <p>Ricardo got up and walked down from the hotel with the detective. The
  front door faces the hillside of Mont Revard, and on this side Mr. Ricardo's
  rooms looked out. The drive from the front door curves round the end of the
  long building and joins the road, which then winds down towards the town past
  the garden at the back of the hotel. Down this road the two men walked, while
  the supporting wall of the garden upon their right hand grew higher and
  higher above their heads. They came to a steep flight of steps which makes a
  short cut from the hotel to the road, and at the steps Hanaud stopped.</p>

  <p>"Do you see?" he said. "On the opposite side there are no houses; there is
  only a wall. Behind the wall there are climbing gardens and the ground falls
  steeply to the turn of the road below. There's a flight of steps leading down
  which corresponds with the flight of steps from the garden. Very often
  there's a sergent-de-ville stationed on the top of the steps. But there was
  not one there yesterday afternoon at three. Behind us is the supporting wall
  of the hotel garden. Well, look about you. We cannot be seen from the hotel.
  There's not a soul in sight &mdash; yes, there's some one coming up the hill,
  but we have been standing here quite long enough for you to stab me and get
  back to your coffee on the verandah of the hotel."</p>

  <p>Ricardo started back.</p>

  <p>"Marthe Gobin!" he cried. "It was here, then?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded.</p>

  <p>"When we returned from the station in your motor-car and went up to your
  rooms we passed Harry Wethermill sitting upon the verandah over the garden
  drinking his coffee. He had the news then that Marthe Gobin was on her
  way."</p>

  <p>"But you had isolated the house in Geneva. How could he have the news?"
  exclaimed Ricardo, whose brain was whirling.</p>

  <p>"I had isolated the house from him, in the sense that he dared not
  communicate with his accomplices. That is what you have to remember. He could
  not even let them know that they must not communicate with him. So he
  received a telegram. It was carefully worded. No doubt he had arranged the
  wording of any message with the care which was used in all the preparations.
  It ran like this" &mdash; and Hanaud took a scrap of paper from his pocket
  and read out from it a copy of the telegram: "'Agent arrives Aix 3.7 to
  negotiate purchase of your patent.' The telegram was handed in at Geneva
  station at 12.45, five minutes after the train had left which carried Marthe
  Gobin to Aix. And more, it was handed in by a man strongly resembling
  Hippolyte Tace" &mdash; that we know."</p>

  <p>"That was madness," said Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"But what else could they do over there in Geneva? They did not know that
  Harry Wethermill was suspected. Harry Wethermill had no idea of it himself.
  But, even if they had known, they must take the risk. Put yourself into their
  place for a moment. They had seen my advertisement about Célie Harland in the
  Geneva paper. Marthe Gobin, that busybody who was always watching her
  neighbours, was no doubt watched herself. They see her leave the house, an
  unusual proceeding for her with her husband ill, as her own letter tells us.
  Hippolyte follows her to the station, sees her take her ticket to Aix and
  mount into the train. He must guess at once that she saw Célie Harland enter
  their house, that she is travelling to Aix with the information of her
  whereabouts. At all costs she must be prevented from giving that information.
  At all risks, therefore, the warning telegram must be sent to Harry
  Wethermill."</p>

  <p>Ricardo recognised the force of the argument.</p>

  <p>"If only you had heard of the telegram yesterday in time!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes!" Hanaud agreed. "But it was only sent off at a quarter to one.
  It was delivered to Wethermill and a copy was sent to the Prefecture, but the
  telegram was delivered first."</p>

  <p>"When was it delivered to Wethermill?" asked Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"At three. We had already left for the station. Wethermill was sitting on
  the verandah. The telegram was brought to him there. It was brought by a
  waiter in the hotel who remembers the incident very well. Wethermill has
  seven minutes and the time it will take for Marthe Gobin to drive from the
  station to the Majestic. What does he do? He runs up first to your rooms,
  very likely not yet knowing what he must do. He runs up to verify his
  telegram."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of that?" cried Ricardo. "How can you be? You were at the
  station with me. What makes you sure?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud produced a brown kid glove from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"This."</p>

  <p>"That is your glove; you told me so yesterday."</p>

  <p>"I told you so," replied Hanaud calmly; "but it is not my glove. It is
  Wethermill's; there are his initials stamped upon the lining &mdash; see? I
  picked up that glove in your room, after we had returned from the station. It
  was not there before. He went to your rooms. No doubt he searched for a
  telegram. Fortunately he did not examine your letters, or Marthe Gobin would
  never have spoken to us as she did after she was dead,"</p>

  <p>"Then what did he do?" asked Ricardo eagerly; and, though Hanaud had been
  with him at the entrance to the station all this while, he asked the question
  in absolute confidence that the true answer would be given to him.</p>

  <p>"He returned to the verandah wondering what he should do. He saw us come
  back from the station in the motor-car and go up to your room. We were alone.
  Marthe Gobin, then, was following. There was his chance. Marthe Gobin must
  not reach us, must not tell her news to us. He ran down the garden steps to
  the gate. No one could see him from the hotel. Very likely he hid behind the
  trees, whence he could watch the road. A cab comes up the hill; there's a
  woman in it &mdash; not quite the kind of woman who stays at your hotel, M.
  Ricardo. Yet she must be going to your hotel, for the road ends. The driver
  is nodding on his box, refusing to pay any heed to his fare lest again she
  should bid him hurry. His horse is moving at a walk. Wethermill puts his head
  in at the window and asks if she has come to see M. Ricardo. Anxious for her
  four thousand francs, she answers 'Yes.' Perhaps he steps into the cab,
  perhaps as he walks by the side he strikes, and strikes hard and strikes
  surely. Long before the cab reaches the hotel he is back again on the
  verandah."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ricardo, "it's the daring of which you spoke which made the
  crime possible &mdash; the same daring which made him seek your help. That
  was unexampled."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Hanaud. "There's an historic crime in your own country,
  monsieur. Cries for help were heard in a by-street of a town. When people ran
  to answer them, a man was found kneeling by a corpse. It was the kneeling man
  who cried for help, but it was also the kneeling man who did the murder. I
  remembered that when I first began to suspect Harry Wethermill."</p>

  <p>Ricardo turned eagerly.</p>

  <p>"And when &mdash; when did you first begin to suspect Harry
  Wethermill?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud smiled and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That you shall know in good time. I am the captain of the ship." His
  voice took on a deeper note. "But I prepare you. Listen! Daring and brains,
  those were the property of Harry Wethermill &mdash; yes. But it is not he who
  is the chief actor in the crime. Of that I am sure. He was no more than one
  of the instruments."</p>

  <p>"One of the instruments? Used, then, by whom?" asked Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"By my Normandy peasant-woman, M. Ricardo," said Hanaud. "Yes, there's the
  dominating figure &mdash; cruel, masterful, relentless &mdash; that strange
  woman, Helène Vauquier. You are surprised? You will see! It is not the man of
  intellect and daring; it's my peasant-woman who is at the bottom of it
  all."</p>

  <p>"But she's free!" exclaimed Ricardo. "You let her go free!"</p>

  <p>"Free!" repeated Ricardo. "She was driven straight from the Villa Rose to
  the depot. She has been kept au secret ever since."</p>

  <p>Ricardo stared in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Already you knew of her guilt?"</p>

  <p>"Already she had lied to me in her description of Adele Rossignol. Do you
  remember what she said &mdash; a black-haired woman with beady eyes; and I
  only five minutes before had picked up from the table &mdash; this."</p>

  <p>He opened his pocket-book, and took from an envelope a long strand of red
  hair.</p>

  <p>"But it was not only because she lied that I had her taken to the depot. A
  pot of cold cream had disappeared from the room of Mlle Célie."</p>

  <p>"Then Perrichet after all was right."</p>

  <p>"Perrichet after all was quite wrong &mdash; not to hold his tongue. For
  in that pot of cold cream, as I was sure, were hidden those valuable diamond
  earrings which Mlle. Célie habitually wore."</p>

  <p>The two men had reached the square in front of the Etablissement des
  Bains. Ricardo dropped on to a bench and wiped his forehead.</p>

  <p>"But I am in a maze," he cried. "My head turns round. I don't know where I
  am."</p>

  <p>Hanaud stood in front of Ricardo, smiling. He was not displeased with his
  companion's bewilderment; it was all so much of tribute to himself.</p>

  <p>"I am the captain of the ship," he said.</p>

  <p>His smile irritated Ricardo, who spoke impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I should be very glad," he said, "if you would tell me how you discovered
  all these things. And what it was that the little salon on the first morning
  had to tell to you? And why Celia Harland ran from the glass doors across the
  grass to the motor-car and again from the carriage into the house on the
  lake? Why she did not resist yesterday evening? Why she did not cry for help?
  How much of Helène Vauquier's evidence was true and how much false? For what
  reason Wethermill concerned himself in this affair? Oh! and a thousand things
  which I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the cushions, and the scrap of paper, and the aluminium flask," said
  Hanaud; and the triumph faded from his face. He spoke now to Ricardo with a
  genuine friendliness. "You must not be angry with me if I keep you in the
  dark for a little while. I, too, Mr. Ricardo, have artistic inclinations. I
  will not spoil the remarkable story which I think Mlle. Célie will be ready
  to tell us. Afterwards I will willingly explain to you what I read in the
  evidences of the room, and what so greatly puzzled me then. But it is not the
  puzzle or its solution," he said modestly, "which is most interesting here.
  Consider the people. Mme. Dauvray, the old, rich, ignorant woman, with her
  superstitions and her generosity, her desire to converse with Mme. de
  Montespan and the great ladies of the past, and her love of a young, fresh
  face about her; Helène Vauquier, the maid with her six years of confidential
  service, who finds herself suddenly supplanted and made to tend and dress in
  dainty frocks the girl who has supplanted her; the young girl herself, that
  poor child, with her love of fine clothes, the Bohemian who, brought up
  amidst trickeries and practising them as a profession, looking upon them and
  upon misery and starvation and despair as the commonplaces of life, keeps a
  simplicity and a delicacy and a freshness which would have withered in a day
  had she been brought up otherwise; Harry Wethermill, the courted and
  successful man of genius.</p>

  <p>"Just imagine if you can what his feelings must have been, when in Mme.
  Dauvray's bedroom, with the woman he had uselessly murdered lying rigid
  beneath the sheet, he saw me raise the block of wood from the inlaid floor
  and take out one by one those jewel cases for which less than twelve hours
  before he had been ransacking that very room. But what he must have felt! And
  to give no sign! Oh, these people are the interesting problems in this story.
  Let us hear what happened on that terrible night. The puzzle &mdash; that can
  wait." In Mr. Ricardo's view Hanaud was proved right. The extraordinary and
  appalling story which was gradually unrolled of what had happened on that
  night of Tuesday in the Villa Rose exceeded in its grim interest all the
  mystery of the puzzle. But it was not told at once.</p>

  <p>The trouble at first with Mlle. Célie was a fear of sleep. She dared not
  sleep &mdash; even with a light in the room and a nurse at her bedside. When
  her eyes were actually closing she would force herself desperately back into
  the living world. For when she slept she dreamed through again that dark and
  dreadful night of Tuesday and the two days which followed it, until at some
  moment endurance snapped and she woke up screaming. But youth, a good
  constitution, and a healthy appetite had their way with her in the end.</p>

  <p>She told her share of the story &mdash; she told what happened. There was
  apparently one terrible scene when she was confronted with Harry Wethermill
  in the office of Monsieur Fleuriot, the Juge d'lnstruction, and on her knees,
  with the tears streaming down her face, besought him to confess the truth.
  For a long while he held out. And then there came a strange and human turn to
  the affair. Adele Rossignol &mdash; or, to give her real name, Adele Tace,
  the wife of Hippolyte &mdash; had conceived a veritable passion for Harry
  Wethermill. He was of a not uncommon type, cold and callous in himself, yet
  with the power to provoke passion in women. And Adele Tace, as the story was
  told of how Harry Wethermill had paid his court to Celia Harland, was seized
  with a vindictive jealousy.</p>

  <p>Hanaud was not surprised. He knew the woman-criminal of his country
  &mdash; brutal, passionate, treacherous. The anonymous letters in a woman's
  handwriting which descend upon the Rue de Jérusalem, and betray the men who
  have committed thefts, had left him no illusions upon that figure in the
  history of crime. Adele Rossignol ran forward to confess, so that Harry
  Wethermill might suffer to the last possible point of suffering. Then at last
  Wethermill gave in and, broken down by the ceaseless interrogations of the
  magistrate, confessed in his turn too. The one, and the only one, who stood
  firmly throughout and denied the crime was Helène Vauquier. Her thin lips
  were kept contemptuously closed, whatever the others might admit. With a
  white, hard face, quietly and respectfully she faced the magistrate week
  after week. She was the perfect picture of a servant who knew her place. And
  nothing was wrung from her. But without her help the story became complete.
  And Ricardo was at pains to write it out.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15"><small>CHAPTER 15</small></a><br>
  <br>
  CELIA'S STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">The story begins with the explanation of that circumstance
  which had greatly puzzled Mr. Ricardo &mdash; Celia's entry into the
  household of Mme. Dauvray.</p>

  <p>Celia's father was a Captain Harland, of a marching regiment, who had
  little beyond good looks and excellent manners wherewith to support his
  position. He was extravagant in his tastes, and of an easy mind in the
  presence of embarrassments. To his other disadvantages he added that of
  falling in love with a pretty girl no better off than himself. They married,
  and Celia was born. For nine years they managed, through the wife's constant
  devotion, to struggle along and to give their daughter an education. Then,
  however, Celia's mother broke down under the strain and died. Captain
  Harland, a couple of years later, went out of the service with discredit,
  passed through the bankruptcy court, and turned showman. His line was
  thought-reading; he enlisted the services of his daughter, taught her the
  tricks of his trade, and became "The Great Fortinbras" of the music-halls.
  Captain Harland would move amongst the audience, asking the spectators in a
  whisper to think of a number or of an article in their pockets, after the
  usual fashion, while the child, in her short frock, with her long fair hair
  tied back with a ribbon, would stand blind- folded upon the platform and reel
  off the answers with astonishing rapidity. She was singularly quick,
  singularly receptive.</p>

  <p>The undoubted cleverness of the performance, and the beauty of the child,
  brought to them a temporary prosperity. The Great Fortinbras rose from the
  music-halls to the assembly rooms of provincial towns. The performance became
  genteel, and ladies flocked to the matinees.</p>

  <p>The Great Fortinbras dropped his pseudonym and became once more Captain
  Harland.</p>

  <p>As Celia grew up, he tried a yet higher flight &mdash; he became a
  spiritualist, with Celia for his medium. The thought-reading entertainments
  became thrilling séances, and the beautiful child, now grown into a beautiful
  girl of seventeen, created a greater sensation as a medium in a trance than
  she had done as a lightning thought-reader.</p>

  <p>"I saw no harm in it," Celia explained to M. Fleuriot, without any attempt
  at extenuation. "I never understood that we might be doing any hurt to any
  one. People were interested. They were to find us out if they could, and they
  tried to and they couldn't. I looked upon it quite simply in that way. It was
  just my profession. I accepted it without any question. I was not troubled
  about it until I came to Aix."</p>

  <p>A startling exposure, however, at Cambridge discredited the craze for
  spiritualism, and Captain Harland's fortunes declined. He crossed with his
  daughter to France and made a disastrous tour in that country, wasted the
  last of his resources in the Casino at Dieppe, and died in that town, leaving
  Celia just enough money to bury him and to pay her third-class fare to
  Paris.</p>

  <p>There she lived honestly but miserably. The slimness of her figure and a
  grace of movement which was particularly hers obtained her at last a
  situation as a mannequin in the show-rooms of a modiste. She took a room on
  the top floor of a house in the Rue St. Honoré and settled down to a hard and
  penurious life.</p>

  <p>"I was not happy or contented &mdash; no," said Celia frankly and
  decisively. "The long hours in the close rooms gave me headaches and made me
  nervous. I had not the temperament. And I was very lonely &mdash; my life had
  been so different. I had had fresh air, good clothes, and freedom. Now all
  was changed. I used to cry myself to sleep up in my little room, wondering
  whether I would ever have friends. You see, I was quite young &mdash; only
  eighteen &mdash; and I wanted to live."</p>

  <p>A change came in a few months, but a disastrous change. The modiste
  failed. Celia was thrown out of work, and could get nothing to do. Gradually
  she pawned what clothes she could spare; and then there came a morning when
  she had a single five-franc piece in the world and owed a month's rent for
  her room. She kept the five-franc piece all day and went hungry, seeking for
  work. In the evening she went to a provision shop to buy food, and the man
  behind the counter took the five-franc piece. He looked at it, rung it on the
  counter, and, with a laugh, bent it easily in half.</p>

  <p>"See here, my little one," he said, tossing the coin back to her, "one
  does not buy good food with lead."</p>

  <p>Celia dragged herself out of the shop in despair. She was starving. She
  dared not go back to her room. The thought of the concierge at the bottom of
  the stairs, insistent for the rent, frightened her. She stood on the pavement
  and burst into tears. A few people stopped and watched her curiously, and
  went on again. Finally a sergent-de-ville told her to go away.</p>

  <p>The girl moved on with the tears running down her cheeks. She was
  desperate, she was lonely.</p>

  <p>"I thought of throwing myself into the Seine," said Celia simply, in
  telling her story to the Juge d'Instruction. "Indeed, I went to the river.
  But the water looked so cold, so terrible, and I was young. I wanted so much
  to live. And then &mdash; the night came, and the lights made the city
  bright, and I was very tired and &mdash; and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And, in a word, the young girl went up to Montmartre in desperation, as
  quickly as her tired legs would carry her. She walked once or twice timidly
  past the restaurants, and, finally, entered one of them, hoping that some one
  would take pity on her and give her some supper. She stood just within the
  door of the supper-room. People pushed past her &mdash; men in evening dress,
  women in bright frocks and jewels. No one noticed her. She had shrunk into a
  corner, rather hoping not to be noticed, now that she had come. But the
  novelty of her surroundings wore off. She knew that for want of food she was
  almost fainting. There were two girls engaged by the management to dance
  amongst the tables while people had supper &mdash; one dressed as a page in
  blue satin, and the other as a Spanish dancer. Both girls were kind. They
  spoke to Celia between their dances. They let her waltz with them. Still no
  one noticed her. She had no jewels, no fine clothes, no chic &mdash; the
  three indispensable things. She had only youth and a pretty face.</p>

  <p>"But," said Celia, "without jewels and fine clothes and chic these go for
  nothing in Paris. At last, however, Mme. Dauvray came in with a party of
  friends from a theatre, and saw how unhappy I was, and gave me some supper.
  She asked me about myself, and I told her. She was very kind, and took me
  home with her, and I cried all the way in the carriage. She kept me a few
  days, and then she told me that I was to live with her, for often she was
  lonely too, and that if I would she would some day find me a nice,
  comfortable husband and give me a marriage portion. So all my troubles seemed
  to be at an end," said Celia, with a smile.</p>

  <p>Within a fortnight Mme. Dauvray confided to Celia that there was a new
  fortune-teller come to Paris, who, by looking into a crystal, could tell the
  most wonderful things about the future. The old woman's eyes kindled as she
  spoke. She took Celia to the fortune-teller's rooms next day, and the girl
  quickly understood the ruling passion of the woman who had befriended her. It
  took very little time then for Celia to notice how easily Mme. Dauvray was
  duped, how perpetually she was robbed. Celia turned the problem over in her
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Madame had been very good to me. She was kind and simple," said Celia,
  with a very genuine affection in her voice. "The people whom we knew laughed
  at her, and were ungenerous. But there are many women whom the world respects
  who are worse than ever was poor Mme. Dauvray. I was very fond of her, so I
  proposed to her that we should hold a séance, and I would bring people from
  the spirit world I knew that I could amuse her with something much more
  clever and more interesting than the fortune-tellers. And at the same time I
  could save her from being plundered. That was all I thought about."</p>

  <p>That was all she thought about, yes. She left Helène Vauquier out of her
  calculations, and she did not foresee the effect of her stances upon Mme.
  Dauvray. Celia had no suspicions of Helène Vauquier. She would have laughed
  if any one had told her that this respectable and respectful middle- aged
  woman, who was so attentive, so neat, so grateful for any kindness, was
  really nursing a rancorous hatred against her. Celia had sprung from
  Montmartre suddenly; therefore Helène Vauquier despised her. Celia had taken
  her place in Mme. Dauvray's confidence, had deposed her unwittingly, had
  turned the confidential friend into a mere servant; therefore Helène Vauquier
  hated her. And her hatred reached out beyond the girl, and embraced the old,
  superstitious, foolish woman, whom a young and pretty face could so easily
  beguile. Helène Vauquier despised them both, hated them both, and yet must
  nurse her rancour in silence and futility. Then came the séances, and at
  once, to add fuel to her hatred, she found herself stripped of those gifts
  and commissions which she had exacted from the herd of common tricksters who
  had been wont to make their harvest out of Mme. Dauvray. Helène Vauquier was
  avaricious and greedy, like so many of her class. Her hatred of Celia, her
  contempt for Mme. Dauvray, grew into a very delirium. But it was a delirium
  she had the cunning to conceal. She lived at white heat, but to all the world
  she had lost nothing of her calm.</p>

  <p>Celia did not foresee the hatred she was arousing; nor, on the other hand,
  did she foresee the overwhelming effect of these spiritualistic séances on
  Mme. Dauvray. Celia had never been brought quite close to the credulous
  before.</p>

  <p>"There had always been the row of footlights," she said. "I was on the
  platform; the audience was in the hall; or, if it was at a house, my father
  made the arrangements. I only came in at the last moment, played my part, and
  went away. It was never brought home to me that some amongst these people
  really and truly believed. I did not think about it. Now, however, when I saw
  Mme. Dauvray so feverish, so excited, so firmly convinced that great ladies
  from the spirit world came and spoke to her, I became terrified. I had
  aroused a passion which I had not suspected. I tried to stop the séances, but
  I was not allowed. I had aroused a passion which I could not control. I was
  afraid that Mme. Dauvray's whole life &mdash; it seems absurd to those who
  did not know her, but those who did will understand &mdash; yes, her whole
  life and happiness would be spoilt if she discovered that what she believed
  in was all a trick."</p>

  <p>She spoke with a simplicity and a remorse which it was difficult to
  disbelieve. M. Fleuriot, the judge, now at last convinced that the Dreyfus
  affair was for nothing in the history of this crime, listened to her with
  sympathy.</p>

  <p>"That is your explanation, mademoiselle," he said gently. "But I must tell
  you that we have another."</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur?" Celia asked.</p>

  <p>"Given by Helène Vauquier," said Fleuriot.</p>

  <p>Even after these days Celia could not hear that woman's name without a
  shudder of fear and a flinching of her whole body. Her face grew white, her
  lips dry.</p>

  <p>"I know, monsieur, that Helène Vauquier is not my friend," she said. "I
  was taught that very cruelly."</p>

  <p>"Listen, mademoiselle, to what she says," said the judge, and he read out
  to Celia an extract or two from Hanaud's report of his first interview with
  Helène Vauquier in her bedroom at the Villa Rose.</p>

  <p>"You hear what she says. 'Mme. Dauvray would have had séances all day, but
  Mlle. Célie pleaded that she was left exhausted at the end of them. But Mlle.
  Célie was of an address.' And again, speaking of Mme. Dauvray's queer craze
  that the spirit of Mme. de Montespan should be called up, Helène Vauquier
  says: 'She was never gratified. Always she hoped. Always Mlle. Célie
  tantalised her with the hope. She would not spoil her fine affairs by making
  these treats too common.' Thus she attributes your reluctance to multiply
  your experiments to a desire to make the most profit possible out of your
  wares, like a good business woman."</p>

  <p>"It is not true, monsieur," cried Celia earnestly. "I tried to stop the
  séances because now for the first time I recognised that I had been playing
  with a dangerous thing. It was a revelation to me. I did not know what to do.
  Mme. Dauvray would promise me everything, give me everything, if only I would
  consent when I refused. I was terribly frightened of what would happen. I did
  not want power over people. I knew it was not good for her that she should
  suffer so much excitement. No, I did not know what to do. And so we all moved
  to Aix."</p>

  <p>And there she met Harry Wethermill on the second day after her arrival,
  and proceeded straightway for the first time to fall in love. To Celia it
  seemed that at last that had happened for which she had so longed. She began
  really to live as she understood life at this time. The day, until she met
  Harry Wethermill, was one flash of joyous expectation; the hours when they
  were together a time of contentment which thrilled with some chance meeting
  of the hands into an exquisite happiness. Mme. Dauvray understood quickly
  what was the matter, and laughed at her affectionately.</p>

  <p>"Célie, my dear," she said, "your friend, M. Wethermill &mdash; 'Arry, is
  it not? See, I pronounce your tongue &mdash; will not be as comfortable as
  the nice, fat, bourgeois gentleman I meant to find for you. But, since you
  are young, naturally you want storms. And there will be storms, Célie," she
  concluded, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Celia blushed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose there will," she said regretfully. There were, indeed, moments
  when she was frightened of Harry Wethermill, but frightened with a delicious
  thrill of knowledge that he was only stern because he cared so much.</p>

  <p>But in a day or two there began to intrude upon her happiness a stinging
  dissatisfaction with her past life. At times she fell into melancholy,
  comparing her career with that of the man who loved her. At times she came
  near to an extreme irritation with Helène Vauquier. Her lover was in her
  thoughts. As she put it herself:</p>

  <p>"I wanted always to look my best, and always to be very good."</p>

  <p>Good in the essentials of life, that is to be understood. She had lived in
  a lax world. She was not particularly troubled by the character of her
  associates; she was untouched by them; she liked her fling at the baccarat-
  tables. These were details, and did not distress her. Love had not turned her
  into a Puritan. But certain recollections plagued her soul. The visit to the
  restaurant at Montmartre, for instance, and the séances. Of these, indeed,
  she thought to have made an end. There were the baccarat-rooms, the beauty of
  the town and the neighbourhood to distract Mme. Dauvray. Celia kept her
  thoughts away from séances. There was no séance as yet held in the Villa
  Rose. And there would have been none but for Helène Vauquier.</p>

  <p>One evening, however, as Harry Wethermill walked down from the Cercle to
  the Villa des Fleurs, a woman's voice spoke to him from behind.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur!"</p>

  <p>He turned and saw Mme. Dauvray's maid. He stopped under a street lamp, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Well, what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>The woman hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I hope monsieur will pardon me," she said humbly. "I am committing a
  great impertinence. But I think monsieur is not very kind to Mlle.
  Célie."</p>

  <p>Wethermill stared at her.</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean?" he asked angrily.</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier looked him quietly in the face.</p>

  <p>"It is plain, monsieur, that Mlle. Célie loves monsieur. Monsieur has led
  her on to love him. But it is also plain to a woman with quick eyes that
  monsieur himself cares no more for mademoiselle than for the button on his
  coat. It is not very kind to spoil the happiness of a young and pretty girl,
  monsieur."</p>

  <p>Nothing could have been more respectful than the manner in which these
  words were uttered. Wethermill was taken in by it. He protested earnestly,
  fearing lest the maid should become an enemy.</p>

  <p>"Helène, it is not true that I am playing with Mlle. Célie. Why should I
  not care for her?"</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier shrugged her shoulders. The question needed no answer.</p>

  <p>"Why should I seek her so often if I did not care?"</p>

  <p>And to this question Helène Vauquier smiled &mdash; a quiet, slow,
  confidential smile.</p>

  <p>"What does monsieur want of Mme. Dauvray?" she asked. And the question was
  her answer.</p>

  <p>Wethermill stood silent. Then he said abruptly:</p>

  <p>"Nothing, of course; nothing." And he walked away.</p>

  <p>But the smile remained on Helène Vauquier's face. What did they all want
  of Mme. Dauvray? She knew very well. It was what she herself wanted &mdash;
  with other things. It was money &mdash; always money. Wethermill was not the
  first to seek the good graces of Mme. Dauvray through her pretty companion.
  Helène Vauquier went home. She was not discontented with her conversation.
  Wethermill had paused long enough before he denied the suggestion of her
  words. She approached him a few days later a second time and more openly. She
  was shopping in, the Rue du Casino when he passed her. He stopped of his own
  accord and spoke to her. Helène Vauquier kept a grave and respectful face.
  But there was a pulse of joy at her heart. He was coming to her hand.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," she said, "you do not go the right way." And again her strange
  smile illuminated her face. "Mlle. Célie sets a guard about Mme. Dauvray. She
  will not give to people the opportunity to find madame generous."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Wethermill slowly. "Is that so?" And he turned and walked by
  Helène Vauquier's side.</p>

  <p>"Never speak of Mme. Dauvray's wealth, monsieur, if you would keep the
  favour of Mlle. Célie. She is young, but she knows her world."</p>

  <p>"I have not spoken of money to her," replied Wethermill; and then he burst
  out laughing. "But why should you think that I &mdash; I, of all men &mdash;
  want money?" he asked.</p>

  <p>And Helène answered him again enigmatically.</p>

  <p>"If I am wrong, monsieur, I am sorry, but you can help me too," she said,
  in her submissive voice. And she passed on, leaving Wethermill rooted to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>It was a bargain she proposed &mdash; the impertinence of it! It was a
  bargain she proposed &mdash; the value of it! In that shape ran Harry
  Wethermill's thoughts. He was in desperate straits, though to the world's eye
  he was a man of wealth. A gambler, with no inexpensive tastes, he had been
  always in need of money. The rights in his patent he had mortgaged long ago.
  He was not an idler; he was no sham foisted as a great man on an ignorant
  public. He had really some touch of genius, and he cultivated it assiduously.
  But the harder he worked, the greater was his need of gaiety and
  extravagance. Gifted with good looks and a charm of manner, he was popular
  alike in the great world and the world of Bohemia. He kept and wanted to keep
  a foot in each. That he was in desperate straits now, probably Helène
  Vauquier alone in Aix had recognised. She had drawn her inference from one
  simple fact. Wethermill asked her at a later time when they were better
  acquainted how she had guessed his need.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," she replied, "you were in Aix without a valet, and it seemed
  to me that you were of that class of men who would never move without a valet
  so long as there was money to pay his wages. That was my first thought. Then
  when I saw you pursue your friendship with Mlle. Célie &mdash; you, who so
  clearly to my eyes did not love her &mdash; I felt sure."</p>

  <p>On the next occasion that the two met, it was again Harry Wethermill who
  sought Helène Vauquier. He talked for a minute or two upon indifferent
  subjects, and then he said quickly:</p>

  <p>"I suppose Mme. Dauvray is very rich?"</p>

  <p>"She has a great fortune in jewels," said Helène Vauquier.</p>

  <p>Wethermill started. He was agitated that evening, the woman saw. His hands
  shook, his face twitched. Clearly he was hard put to it. For he seldom
  betrayed himself. She thought it time to strike.</p>

  <p>"Jewels which she keeps in the safe in her bedroom," she added.</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you &mdash; &mdash; ?" he began, and stopped.</p>

  <p>"I said that I too needed help," replied Helène, without a ruffle of her
  composure.</p>

  <p>It was nine o'clock at night. Helène Vauquier had come down to the Casino
  with a wrap for Mme. Dauvray. The two people were walking down the little
  street of which the Casino blocks the end. And it happened that an attendant
  at the Casino, named Alphonse Ruel, passed them, recognised them both, and
  &mdash; smiled to himself with some amusement. What was Wethermill doing in
  company with Mme. Dauvray's maid? Ruel had no doubt. Ruel had seen Wethermill
  often enough these recent days with Mme. Dauvray's pretty companion. Ruel had
  all a Frenchman's sympathy with lovers. He wished them well, those two young
  and attractive people, and hoped that the maid would help their plans.</p>

  <p>But as he passed he caught a sentence spoken suddenly by Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is true; I must have money." And the agitated voice and words
  remained fixed in his memory. He heard, too, a warning "Hush!" from the maid.
  Then they passed out of his hearing. But he turned and saw that Wethermill
  was talking volubly. What Harry Wethermill was saying he was saying in a
  foolish burst of confidence.</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it, Helène &mdash; you alone." He had mortgaged his
  patent twice over &mdash; once in France, once in England &mdash; and the
  second time had been a month ago. He had received a large sum down, which
  went to pay his pressing creditors. He had hoped to pay the sum back from a
  new invention.</p>

  <p>"But Helène, I tell you," he said, "I have a conscience." And when she
  smiled he explained. "Oh, not what the priests would call a conscience; that
  I know. But none the less I have a conscience &mdash; a conscience about the
  things which really matter, at all events to me. There is a flaw in that new
  invention. It can be improved; I know that. But as yet I do not see how, and
  &mdash; I cannot help it &mdash; I must get it right; I cannot let it go
  imperfect when I know that it's imperfect, when I know that it can be
  improved, when I am sure that I shall sooner or later hit upon the needed
  improvement. That is what I mean when I say I have a conscience."</p>

  <p>Helena Vauquier smiled indulgently. Men were queer fish. Things which were
  really of no account troubled and perplexed them and gave them sleepless
  nights. But it was not for her to object, since it was one of these queer
  anomalies which was giving her her chance.</p>

  <p>"And the people are finding out that you have sold your rights twice
  over," she said sympathetically. "That is a pity, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"They know," he answered; "those in England know."</p>

  <p>"And they are very angry?"</p>

  <p>"They threaten me," said Wethermill. "They give me a month to restore the
  money. Otherwise there will be disgrace, imprisonment, penal servitude."</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier walked calmly on. No sign of the intense joy which she
  felt was visible in her face, and only a trace of it in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur will, perhaps, meet me tomorrow in Geneva," she said. And she
  named a small cafe in a back street. "I can get a holiday for the afternoon."
  And as they were near to the villa and the lights, she walked on ahead.</p>

  <p>Wethermill loitered behind. He had tried his luck at the tables and had
  failed. And &mdash; and &mdash; he must have the money.</p>

  <p>He travelled, accordingly, the next day to Geneva, and was there presented
  to Adele Tace and Hippolyte.</p>

  <p>"They are trusted friends of mine," said Helène Vauquier to Wethermill,
  who was not inspired to confidence by the sight of the young man with the big
  ears and the plastered hair. As a matter of fact, she had never met them
  before they came this year to Aix.</p>

  <p>The Tace family, which consisted of Adele and her husband and Jeanne, her
  mother, were practised criminals. They had taken the house in Geneva
  deliberately in order to carry out some robberies from the great villas on
  the lake-side. But they had not been fortunate; and a description of Mme.
  Dauvray's jewellery in the woman's column of a Geneva newspaper had drawn
  Adele Tace over to Aix. She had set about the task of seducing Mme. Dauvray's
  maid, and found a master, not an instrument.</p>

  <p>In the small cafe on that afternoon of July Helène Vauquier instructed her
  accomplices, quietly and methodically, as though what she proposed was the
  most ordinary stroke of business. Once or twice subsequently Wethermill, who
  was the only safe go-between, went to the house in Geneva, altering his hair
  and wearing a moustache, to complete the arrangements. He maintained firmly
  at his trial that at none of these meetings was there any talk of murder.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said the judge, with a savage sarcasm. "In decent
  conversation there is always a reticence. Something is left to be
  understood."</p>

  <p>And it is difficult to understand how murder could not have been an
  essential part of their plan, since &mdash; &mdash; But let us see what
  happened.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16"><small>CHAPTER 16</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE FIRST MOVE</h2>

  <p class="first">On the Friday before the crime was committed Mme. Dauvray
  and Celia dined at the Villa des Fleurs. While they were drinking their
  coffee Harry Wethermill joined them. He stayed with them until Mme. Dauvray
  was ready to move, and then all three walked into the baccarat rooms
  together. But there, in the throng of people, they were separated.</p>

  <p>Harry Wethermill was looking carefully after Celia, as a good lover
  should. He had, it seemed, no eyes for any one else; and it was not until a
  minute or two had passed that the girl herself noticed that Mme. Dauvray was
  not with them.</p>

  <p>"We will find her easily," said Harry.</p>

  <p>"Of course," replied Celia.</p>

  <p>"There is, after all, no hurry," said Wethermill, with a laugh; "and
  perhaps she was not unwilling to leave us together."</p>

  <p>Celia dimpled to a smile.</p>

  <p>"Mme. Dauvray is kind to me," she said, with a very pretty timidity.</p>

  <p>"And yet more kind to me," said Wethermill in a low voice which brought
  the blood into Celia's cheeks.</p>

  <p>But even while he spoke he soon caught sight of Mme. Dauvray standing by
  one of the tables; and near to her was Adele Tace. Adele had not yet made
  Mme. Dauvray's acquaintance; that was evident. She was apparently unaware of
  her; but she was gradually edging towards her. Wethermill smiled, and Celia
  caught the smile.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked, and her head began to turn in the direction of
  Mme. Dauvray.</p>

  <p>"Why, I like your frock &mdash; that's all," said Wethermill at once; and
  Celia's eyes went down to it.</p>

  <p>"Do you?" she said, with a pleased smile. It was a dress of dark blue
  which suited her well. "I am glad. I think it is pretty." And they passed
  on.</p>

  <p>Wethermill stayed by the girl's side throughout the evening. Once again he
  saw Mme. Dauvray and Adele Tace. But now they were together; now they were
  talking. The first step had been taken. Adele Tace had scraped acquaintance
  with Mme. Dauvray. Celia saw them almost at the same moment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there is Mme. Dauvray," she cried, taking a step towards her.</p>

  <p>Wethermill detained the girl.</p>

  <p>"She seems quite happy," he said; and, indeed, Mme. Dauvray was talking
  volubly and with the utmost interest, the jewels sparkling about her neck.
  She raised her head, saw Celia, nodded to her affectionately, and then
  pointed her out to her companion. Adele Tace looked the girl over with
  interest and smiled contentedly. There was nothing to be feared from her. Her
  youth, her very daintiness, seemed to offer her as the easiest of
  victims.</p>

  <p>"You see Mme. Dauvray does not want you," said Harry Wethermill. "Let us
  go and play chemin-de-fer"; and they did, moving off into one of the further
  rooms.</p>

  <p>It was not until another hour had passed that Celia rose and went in
  search of Mme. Dauvray. She found her still talking earnestly to Adele Tace.
  Mme. Dauvray got up at once.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready to go, dear?" she asked, and she turned to Adele Tace.
  "This is Célie, Mme. Rossignol," she said, and she spoke with a marked
  significance and a note of actual exultation in her voice.</p>

  <p>Celia, however, was not unused to this tone. Mme. Dauvray was proud of her
  companion, and had a habit of showing her off, to the girl's discomfort. The
  three women spoke a few words, and then Mme. Dauvray and Celia left the rooms
  and walked to the entrance-doors. But as they walked Celia became
  alarmed.</p>

  <p>She was by nature extraordinarily sensitive to impressions. It was to that
  quick receptivity that the success of "The Great Fortinbras" had been chiefly
  due. She had a gift of rapid comprehension. It was not that she argued, or
  deducted, or inferred. But she felt. To take a metaphor from the work of the
  man she loved, she was a natural receiver. So now, although no word was
  spoken, she was aware that Mme. Dauvray was greatly excited &mdash; greatly
  disturbed; and she dreaded the reason of that excitement and disturbance.</p>

  <p>While they were driving home in the motor-car she said apprehensively:</p>

  <p>"You met a friend then, to-night, madame?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mme. Dauvray; "I made a friend. I had not met Mme. Rossignol
  before. A bracelet of hers came undone, and I helped her to fasten it. We
  talked afterwards. She lives in Geneva."</p>

  <p>Mme. Dauvray was silent for a moment or two. Then she turned impulsively
  and spoke in a voice of appeal.</p>

  <p>"Célie, we talked of things"; and the girl moved impatiently. She
  understood very well what were the things of which Mme. Dauvray and her new
  friend had talked. "And she laughed... I could not bear it."</p>

  <p>Celia was silent, and Mme. Dauvray went on in a voice of awe:</p>

  <p>"I told her of the wonderful things which happened when I sat with Helène
  in the dark &mdash; how the room filled with strange sounds, how ghostly
  fingers touched my forehead and my eyes. She laughed &mdash; Adele Rossignol
  laughed, Célie. I told her of the spirits with whom we held converse. She
  would not believe. Do you remember the evening, Célie, when Mme. de
  Castiglione came back an old, old woman, and told us how, when she had grown
  old and had lost her beauty and was very lonely, she would no longer live in
  the great house which was so full of torturing memories, but took a small
  appartement near by, where no one knew her; and how she used to walk out late
  at night, and watch, with her eyes full of tears, the dark windows which had
  been once so bright with light? Adele Rossignol would not believe. I told her
  that I had found the story afterwards in a volume of memoirs. Adele Rossignol
  laughed and said no doubt you had read that volume yourself before the
  séance."</p>

  <p>Celia stirred guiltily.</p>

  <p>"She had no faith in you, Célie. It made me angry, dear. She said that you
  invented your own tests. She sneered at them. A string across a cupboard! A
  child, she said, could manage that; much more, then, a clever young lady. Oh,
  she admitted that you were clever! Indeed, she urged that you were far too
  clever to submit to the tests of some one you did not know. I replied that
  you would. I was right, Célie, was I not?"</p>

  <p>And again the appeal sounded rather piteously in Mme. Dauvray's voice.</p>

  <p>"Tests!" said Celia, with a contemptous laugh. And, in truth, she was not
  afraid of them. Mme. Dauvray's voice at once took courage.</p>

  <p>"There!" she cried triumphantly. "I was sure. I told her so. Célie, I
  arranged with her that next Tuesday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And Celia interrupted quickly.</p>

  <p>"No! Oh, no!"</p>

  <p>Again there was silence; and then Mme. Dauvray said gently, but very
  seriously:</p>

  <p>"Célie, you are not kind."</p>

  <p>Celia was moved by the reproach.</p>

  <p>"Oh, madame!" she cried eagerly. "Please don't think that. How could I be
  anything else to you who are so kind to me?"</p>

  <p>"Then prove it, Célie. On Tuesday I have asked Mme. Rossignol to come; and
  &mdash; " The old woman's voice became tremulous with excitement. "And
  parhaps &mdash; who knows? &mdash; perhaps SHE will appear to us."</p>

  <p>Celia had no doubt who "she" was. She was Mme. de Montespan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, madame!" she stammered. "Here, at Aix, we are not in the spirit
  for such things,"</p>

  <p>And then, in a voice of dread, Mme. Dauvray asked: "Is it true, then, what
  Adele said?"</p>

  <p>And Celia started violently. Mme. Dauvray doubted.</p>

  <p>"I believe it would break my heart, my dear, if I were to think that; if I
  were to know that you had tricked me," she said, with a trembling voice.
  Celia covered her face with her hands. It would be true. She had no doubt of
  it. Mme. Dauvray would never forgive herself &mdash; would never forgive
  Celia. Her infatuation had grown so to engross her that the rest of her life
  would surely be embittered. It was not merely a passion &mdash; it was a
  creed as well. Celia shrank from the renewal of these séances. Every fibre in
  her was in revolt. They were so unworthy &mdash; so unworthy of Harry
  Wethermill, and of herself as she now herself wished to be. But she had to
  pay now; the moment for payment had come.</p>

  <p>"Célie," said Mme. Dauvray, "it isn't true! Surely it isn't true?"</p>

  <p>Celia drew her hands away from her face.</p>

  <p>"Let Mme. Rossignol come on Tuesday!" she cried, and the old woman caught
  the girl's hand and pressed it with affection.</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you! thank you!" she cried. "Adele Rossignol laughs to-night;
  we shall convince her on Tuesday, Célie! Célie, I am so glad!" And her voice
  sank into a solemn whisper, pathetically ludicrous. "It is not right that she
  should laugh! To bring people back through the gates of the spirit-world
  &mdash; that is wonderful."</p>

  <p>To Celia the sound of the jargon learnt from her own lips, used by herself
  so thoughtlessly in past times, was odious. "For the last time," she pleaded
  to herself. All her life was going to change; though no word had yet been
  spoken by Harry Wethermill, she was sure of it. Just for this one last time,
  then, so that she might leave Mme. Dauvray the colours of her belief, she
  would hold a séance at the Villa Rose.</p>

  <p>Mme. Dauvray told the news to Helène Vauquier when they reached the
  villa.</p>

  <p>"You will be present, Helène," she cried excitedly. "It will be Tuesday.
  There will be the three of us."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if madame wishes," said Helène submissively. She looked round
  the room. "Mlle. Célie can be placed on a chair in that recess and the
  curtains drawn, whilst we &mdash; madame and madame's friend and I &mdash;
  can sit round this table under the side windows."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Celia, "that will do very well."</p>

  <p>It was Madame Dauvray's habit when she was particularly pleased with Celia
  to dismiss her maid quickly, and to send her to brush the girl's hair at
  night; and in a little while on this night Helène went to Celia's room. While
  she brushed Celia's hair she told her that Servettaz's parents lived at
  Chambery, and that he would like to see them.</p>

  <p>"But the poor man is afraid to ask for a day," she said. "He has been so
  short a time with madame."</p>

  <p>"Of course madame will give him a holiday if he asks," replied Celia with
  a smile. "I will speak to her myself to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"It would be kind of mademoiselle," said Helène Vauquier. "But
  perhaps&mdash;" She stopped.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Celia.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps mademoiselle would do better still to speak to Servattaz himself
  and encourage him to ask with his own lips. Madame has her moods, is it not
  so? She does not always like it to be forgotten that she is the
  mistress."</p>

  <p>On the next day accordingly Celia did speak to Servettaz, and Servettaz
  asked for his holiday.</p>

  <p>"But of course," Mme. Dauvray at once replied. "We must decide upon a
  day."</p>

  <p>It was then that Helène Vauquier ventured humbly upon a suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Since madame has a friend coming here on Tuesday, perhaps that would be
  the best day for him to go. Madame would not be likely to take a long drive
  that afternoon."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," replied Mme. Dauvray. "We shall all three dine together
  early in Aix and return here."</p>

  <p>"Then I will tell him he may go to-morrow," said Celia.</p>

  <p>For this conversation took place on the Monday, and in the evening Mme.
  Dauvray and Celia went as usual to the Villa des Fleurs and dined there.</p>

  <p>"I was in a bad mind," said Celia, when asked by the Juge d'Instruction to
  explain that attack of nerves in the garden which Ricardo had witnessed. "I
  hated more and more the thought of the séance which was to take place on the
  morrow. I felt that I was disloyal to Harry. My nerves were all tingling. I
  was not nice that night at all," she added quaintly. "But at dinner I
  determined that if I met Harry after dinner, as I was sure to do, I would
  tell him the whole truth about myself. However, when I did meet him I was
  frightened. I knew how stern he could suddenly look. I dreaded what he would
  think. I was too afraid that I should lose him. No, I could not speak; I had
  not the courage. That made me still more angry with myself, and so I &mdash;
  I quarrelled at once with Harry. He was surprised; but it was natural, wasn't
  it? What else should one do under such circumstances. except quarrel with the
  man one loved? Yes, I really quarrelled with him, and said things which I
  thought and hoped would hurt. Then I ran away from him lest I should break
  down and cry. I went to the tables and lost at once all the money I had
  except one note of five louis. But that did not console me. And I ran out
  into the garden, very unhappy. There I behaved like a child, and Mr. Ricardo
  saw me. But it was not the little money I had lost which troubled me; no, it
  was the thought of what a coward I was. Afterwards Harry and I made it up,
  and I thought, like the little fool I was, that he wanted to ask me to marry
  him. But I would not let him that night. Oh! I wanted him to ask me &mdash; I
  was longing for him to ask me &mdash; but not that night. Somehow I felt that
  the séance and the tricks must be all over and done with before I could
  listen or answer."</p>

  <p>The quiet and simple confession touched the magistrate who listened to it
  with profound pity. He shaded his eyes with his hand. The girl's sense of her
  unworthiness, the love she had given so unstintingly to Harry Wethermill, the
  deep pride she had felt in the delusion that he loved her too, had in it an
  irony too bitter. But he was aroused to anger against the man.</p>

  <p>"Go on, mademoiselle," he said. But in spite of himself his voice
  trembled.</p>

  <p>"So I arranged with him that we should meet on Wednesday, as Mr. Ricardo
  heard."</p>

  <p>"You told him that you would 'want him' on Wednesday," said the Judge
  quoting Mr. Ricardo's words.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Celia. "I meant that the last word of all these deceptions
  would have been spoken. I should be free to hear what he had to say to me.
  You see, monsieur, I was so sure that I knew what it was he had to say to me
  &mdash; "and her voice broke upon the words. She recovered herself with an
  effort. "Then I went home with Mme. Dauvray."</p>

  <p>On the morning of Tuesday, however, there came a letter from Adele Tace,
  of which no trace was afterwards discovered. The letter invited Mme. Dauvray
  and Celia to come out to Annecy and dine with her at an hotel there. They
  could then return together to Aix. The proposal fitted well with Mme.
  Dauvray's inclinations. She was in a feverish mood of excitement.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it will be better that we dine quietly together in a place where
  there is no noise and no crowd, and where no one knows us," she said; and she
  looked up the time-table. "There is a train back which reaches Aix at nine
  o'clock," she said, "so we need not spoil Servettaz' holiday."</p>

  <p>"His parents will be expecting him," Helène Vauquier added.</p>

  <p>Accordingly Servettaz left for Chambery by the 1.50 train from Aix; and
  later on in the afternoon Mme. Dauvray and Celia went by train to Annecy. In
  the one woman's mind was the queer longing that "she" should appear and speak
  to-night; in the girl's there was a wish passionate as a cry. "This shall be
  the last time," she said to herself again and again &mdash; "the very
  last."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Helène Vauquier, it must be held, burnt carefully Adele Taces
  letter. She was left in the Villa Rose with the charwoman to keep her
  company. The charwoman bore testimony that Helène Vauquier certainly did burn
  a letter in the kitchen-stove, and that after she had burned it she sat for a
  long time rocking herself in a chair, with a smile of great pleasure upon her
  face, and now and then moistening her lips with her tongue. But Helène
  Vauquier kept her mouth sealed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17"><small>CHAPTER 17</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE AFTERNOON OF TUESDAY</h2>

  <p class="first">Mme. Dauvray and Celia found Adele Rossignol, to give Adele
  Tace the name which she assumed, waiting for them impatiently in the garden
  of an hotel at Annecy, on the Promenade du Paquier. She was a tall, lithe
  woman, and she was dressed, by the purse and wish of Helène Vauquier, in a
  robe and a long coat of sapphire velvet, which toned down the coarseness of
  her good looks and lent something of elegance to her figure.</p>

  <p>"So it is mademoiselle," Adele began, with a smile of raillery, "who is so
  remarkably clever."</p>

  <p>"Clever?" answered Celia, looking straight at Adele, as though through her
  she saw mysteries beyond. She took up her part at once. Since for the last
  time it had got to be played, there must be no fault in the playing. For her
  own sake, for the sake of Mme. Dauvray's happiness, she must carry it off to-
  night with success. The suspicions of Adele Rossignol must obtain no
  verification. She spoke in a quiet and most serious voice. "Under spirit-
  control no one is clever. One does the bidding of the spirit which
  controls."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," said Adele in a malicious tone. "I only hope you will see to
  it, mademoiselle, that some amusing spirits control you this evening and
  appear before us."</p>

  <p>"I am only the living gate by which the spirit forms pass from the realm
  of mind into the world of matter," Celia replied.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Adele comfortably. "Now let us be sensible and dine. We
  can amuse ourselves with mademoiselle's rigmaroles afterwards."</p>

  <p>Mme. Dauvray was indignant. Celia, for her part, felt humiliated and
  small. They sat down to their dinner in the garden, but the rain began to
  fall and drove them indoors. There were a few people dining at the same hour,
  but none near enough to overhear them. Alike in the garden and the
  dining-room, Adele Tace kept up the same note of ridicule and disbelief. She
  had been carefully tutored for her work. She was able to cite the stock cases
  of exposure &mdash; "les freres Davenport," as she called them, Eusapia
  Palladino and Dr. Slade. She knew the precautions which had been taken to
  prevent trickery and where those precautions had failed. Her whole
  conversation was carefully planned to one end, and to one end alone. She
  wished to produce in the minds of her companions so complete an impression of
  her scepticism that it would seem the most natural thing in the world to both
  of them that she should insist upon subjecting Celia to the severest tests.
  The rain ceased, and they took their coffee on the terrace of the hotel. Mme.
  Dauvray had been really pained by the conversation of Adele Tace. She had all
  the missionary zeal of a fanatic.</p>

  <p>"I do hope, Adele, that we shall make you believe. But we shall. Oh, I am
  confident we shall." And her voice was feverish.</p>

  <p>Adele dropped for the moment her tone of raillery.</p>

  <p>"I am not unwilling to believe," she said, "but I cannot. I am interested
  &mdash; yes. You see how much I have studied the subject. But I cannot
  believe. I have heard stories of how these manifestations are produced
  &mdash; stories which make me laugh. I cannot help it. The tricks are so
  easy. A young girl wearing a black frock which does not rustle &mdash; it is
  always a black frock, is it not, because a black frock cannot be seen in the
  dark? &mdash; carrying a scarf or veil, with which she can make any sort of
  headdress if only she is a little clever, and shod in a pair of felt-soled
  slippers, is shut up in a cabinet or placed behind a screen, and the lights
  are turned down or out &mdash; " Adele broke off with a comic shrug of the
  shoulders. "Bah! It ought not to deceive a child."</p>

  <p>Celia sat with a face which WOULD grow red. She did not look, but none the
  less she was aware that Mme. Dauvray was gazing at her with a perplexed frown
  and some return of her suspicion showing in her eyes. Adele Tace was not
  content to leave the subject there.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she said, with a smile, "Mlle. Célie dresses in that way for a
  séance?"</p>

  <p>"Madame shall see tonight," Celia stammered, and Camille Dauvray rather
  sternly repeated her words.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Adele shall see tonight. I myself will decide what you shall wear,
  Célie."</p>

  <p>Adele Tace casually suggested the kind of dress which she would
  prefer.</p>

  <p>"Something light in colour with a train, something which will hiss and
  whisper if mademoiselle moves about the room &mdash; yes, and I think one of
  mademoiselle's big hats," she said. "We will have mademoiselle as modern as
  possible, so that, when the great ladies of the past appear in the coiffure
  of their day, we may be sure it is not Mlle. Célie who represents them."</p>

  <p>"I will speak to Helène," said Mme. Dauvray, and Adele Tace was
  content.</p>

  <p>There was a particular new dress of which she knew, and it was very
  desirable that Mlle. Célie should wear it tonight. For one thing, if Celia
  wore it, it would help the theory that she had put it on because she expected
  that night a lover; for another, with that dress there went a pair of satin
  slippers which had just come home from a shoemaker at Aix, and which would
  leave upon soft mould precisely the same imprints as the grey suede shoes
  which the girl was wearing now.</p>

  <p>Celia was not greatly disconcerted by Mme. Rossignol's precautions. She
  would have to be a little more careful, and Mme. de Montespan would be a
  little longer in responding to the call of Mme. Dauvray than most of the
  other dead ladies of the past had been. But that was all. She was, however,
  really troubled in another way. All through dinner, at every word of the
  conversation, she had felt her reluctance towards this séance swelling into a
  positive disgust. More than once she had felt driven by some uncontrollable
  power to rise up at the table and cry out to Adele:</p>

  <p>"You are right! It IS trickery. There is no truth in it."</p>

  <p>But she had mastered herself. For opposite to her sat her patroness, her
  good friend, the woman who had saved her. The flush upon Mme. Dauvray's
  cheeks and the agitation of her manner warned Celia how much hung upon the
  success of this last séance. How much for both of them!</p>

  <p>And in the fullness of that knowledge a great fear assailed her. She began
  to be afraid, so strong was her reluctance, that she would not bring her
  heart into the task. "Suppose I failed tonight because I could not force
  myself to wish not to fail!" she thought, and she steeled herself against the
  thought. Tonight she must not fail. For apart altogether from Mme. Dauvray's
  happiness, her own, it seemed, was at stake too.</p>

  <p>"It must be from my lips that Harry learns what I have been," she said to
  herself, and with the resolve she strengthened herself.</p>

  <p>"I will wear what you please," she said, with a smile. "I only wish Mme.
  Rossignol to be satisfied."</p>

  <p>"And I shall be," said Adele, "if&mdash;" She leaned forward in anxiety.
  She had come to the real necessity of Helène Vauquier's plan. "If we abandon
  as quite laughable the cupboard door and the string across it; if, in a word,
  mademoiselle consents that we tie her hand and foot and fasten her securely
  in a chair. Such restraints are usual in the experiments of which I have
  read. Was there not a medium called Mlle. Cook who was secured in this way,
  and then remarkable things, which I could not believe, were supposed to have
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I permit it," said Celia, with indifference; and Mme. Dauvray
  cried enthusiastically:</p>

  <p>"Ah, you shall believe tonight in those wonderful things!"</p>

  <p>Adele Tace leaned back. She drew a breath. It was a breath of relief.</p>

  <p>"Then we will buy the cord in Aix," she said.</p>

  <p>"We have some, no doubt, in the house," said Mme. Dauvray.</p>

  <p>Adele shook her head and smiled.</p>

  <p>"My dear madame, you are dealing with a sceptic. I should not be
  content."</p>

  <p>Celia shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Let us satisfy Mme. Rossignol," she said.</p>

  <p>Celia, indeed, was not alarmed by this last precaution. For her it was a
  test less difficult than the light-coloured rustling robe. She had appeared
  upon so many platforms, had experienced too often the bungling efforts of
  spectators called up from the audience, to be in any fear. There were very
  few knots from which her small hands and supple fingers had not learnt long
  since to extricate themselves. She was aware how much in all these matters
  the personal equation counted. Men who might, perhaps, have been able to tie
  knots from which she could not get free were always too uncomfortable and
  self- conscious, or too afraid of hurting her white arms and wrists, to do
  it. Women, on the other hand, who had no compunctions of that kind, did not
  know how.</p>

  <p>It was now nearly eight o'clock; the rain still held off.</p>

  <p>"We must go," said Mme. Dauvray, who for the last half-hour had been
  continually looking at her watch.</p>

  <p>They drove to the station and took the train. Once more the rain came
  down, but it had stopped again before the train steamed into Aix at nine
  o'clock.</p>

  <p>"We will take a cab," said Mme. Dauvray: "it will save time."</p>

  <p>"It will do us good to walk, madame," pleaded Adele. The train was full.
  Adele passed quickly out from the lights of the station in the throng of
  passengers and waited in the dark square for the others to join her. "It is
  barely nine. A friend has promised to call at the Villa Rose for me after
  eleven and drive me back in a motor-car to Geneva, so we have plenty of
  time."</p>

  <p>They walked accordingly up the hill, Mme. Dauvray slowly, since she was
  stout, and Celia keeping pace with her. Thus it seemed natural that Adele
  Tace should walk ahead, though a passer-by would not have thought she was of
  their company. At the corner of the Rue du Casino Adele waited for them and
  said quickly:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, you can get some cord, I think, at the shop there," and she
  pointed to the shop of M. Corval. "Madame and I will go slowly on; you, who
  are the youngest, will easily catch us up." Celia went into the shop, bought
  the cord, and caught Mme. Dauvray up before she reached the villa.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mme. Rossignol?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"She went on," said Camille Dauvray. "She walks faster than I do."</p>

  <p>They passed no one whom they knew, although they did pass one who
  recognised them, as Perrichet had discovered. They came upon Adele, waiting
  for them at the corner of the road, where it turns down toward the villa.</p>

  <p>"It is near here &mdash; the Villa Rose?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A minute more and we are there."</p>

  <p>They turned in at the drive, closed the gate behind them, and walked up to
  the villa.</p>

  <p>The windows and the glass doors were closed, the latticed shutters
  fastened. A light burned in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Helène is expecting us," said Mme. Dauvray, for as they approached she
  saw the front door open to admit them, and Helène Vauquier in the doorway.
  The three women went straight into the little salon, which was ready with the
  lights up and a small fire burning. Celia noticed the fire with a trifle of
  dismay. She moved a fire-screen in front of it.</p>

  <p>"I can understand why you do that, mademoiselle," said Adele Rossignol,
  with a satirical smile. But Mme. Dauvray came to the girl's help.</p>

  <p>"She is right, Adele. Light is the great barrier between us and the
  spirit-world," she said solemnly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the hall Helène Vauquier locked and bolted the front door.
  Then she stood motionless, with a smile upon her face and a heart beating
  high. All through that afternoon she had been afraid that some accident at
  the last moment would spoil her plan, that Adele Tace had not learned her
  lesson, that Célie would take fright, that she would not return. Now all
  those fears were over. She had her victims safe within the villa. The
  charwoman had been sent home. She had them to herself. She was still standing
  in the hall when Mme. Dauvray called aloud impatiently:</p>

  <p>"Helène! Helène!"</p>

  <p>And when she entered the salon there was still, as Celia was able to
  recall, some trace of her smile lingering upon her face.</p>

  <p>Adele Rossignol had removed her hat and was taking off her gloves. Mme.
  Dauvray was speaking impatiently to Celia.</p>

  <p>"We will arrange the room, dear, while Helène helps you to dress. It will
  be quite easy. We shall use the recess."</p>

  <p>And Celia, as she ran up the stairs, heard Mme. Dauvray discussing with
  her maid what frock she should wear. She was hot, and she took a hurried
  bath. When she came from her bathroom she saw with dismay that it was her new
  pale- green evening gown which had been laid out. It was the last which she
  would have chosen. But she dared not refuse it. She must still any suspicion.
  She must succeed. She gave herself into Helène's hands. Celia remembered
  afterwards one or two points which passed barely heeded at the time. Once
  while Helène was dressing her hair she looked up at the maid in the mirror
  and noticed a strange and rather horrible grin upon her face, which
  disappeared the moment their eyes met. Then again, Helène was extraordinarily
  slow and extraordinarily fastidious that evening. Nothing satisfied her,
  neither the hang of the girl's skirt, the folds of her sash, nor the
  arrangement of her hair.</p>

  <p>"Come, Helène, be quick," said Celia. "You know how madame hates to be
  kept waiting at these times. You might be dressing me to go to meet my
  lover," she added, with a blush and a smile at her own pretty reflection in
  the glass; and a queer look came upon Helène Vauquier's face. For it was at
  creating just this very impression that she aimed.</p>

  <p>"Very well, mademoiselle," said Helène. And even as she spoke Mme.
  Dauvray's voice rang shrill and irritable up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Célie! Célie!"</p>

  <p>"Quick, Helène," said Celia. For she herself was now anxious to have the
  séance over and done with.</p>

  <p>But Helène did not hurry. The more irritable Mme. Dauvray became, the more
  impatient with Mlle. Célie, the less would Mlle. Célie dare to refuse the
  tests Adele wished to impose upon her. But that was not all. She took a
  subtle and ironic pleasure to-night in decking out her victim's natural
  loveliness. Her face, her slender throat, her white shoulders, should look
  their prettiest, her grace of limb and figure should be more alluring than
  ever before. The same words, indeed, were running through both women's
  minds.</p>

  <p>"For the last time," said Celia to herself, thinking of these horrible
  séances, of which to-night should see the end.</p>

  <p>"For the last time," said Helène Vauquier too. For the last time she laced
  the girl's dress. There would be no more patient and careful service for
  Mlle. Célie after to-night. But she should have it and to spare to- night.
  She should be conscious that her beauty had never made so strong an appeal;
  that she was never so fit for life as at the moment when the end had come.
  One thing Helène regretted. She would have liked Celia &mdash; Celia, smiling
  at herself in the glass &mdash; to know suddenly what was in store for her!
  She saw in imagination the colour die from the cheeks, the eyes stare wide
  with terror.</p>

  <p>"Célie! Célie!"</p>

  <p>Again the impatient voice rang up the stairs, as Helène pinned the girl's
  hat upon her fair head. Célie sprang up, took a quick step or two towards the
  door, and stopped in dismay. The swish of her long satin train must betray
  her. She caught up the dress and tried again. Even so, the rustle of it was
  heard.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to be very careful. You will help me, Helène?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, mademoiselle. I will sit underneath the switch of the light in
  the salon. If madame, your visitor, makes the experiment too difficult, I
  will find a way to help you," said Helène Vauquier, and as she spoke she
  handed Celia a long pair of white gloves.</p>

  <p>"I shall not want them," said Celia.</p>

  <p>"Mme. Dauvray ordered me to give them to you," replied Helène.</p>

  <p>Celia took them hurriedly, picked up a white scarf of tulle, and ran down
  the stairs. Helène Vauquier listened at the door and heard madame's voice in
  feverish anger.</p>

  <p>"We have been waiting for you, Célie. You have been an age."</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier laughed softly to herself, took out Celia's white frock
  from the wardrobe, turned off the lights, and followed her down to the hall.
  She placed the cloak just outside the door of the salon. Then she carefully
  turned out all the lights in the hall and in the kitchen and went into the
  salon. The rest of the house was in darkness. This room was brightly lit; and
  it had been made ready.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18"><small>CHAPTER 18</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE SÉANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">Helène Vauquier locked the door of the salon upon the inside
  and placed the key upon the mantel-shelf, as she had always done whenever a
  séance had been held. The curtains had been loosened at the sides of the
  arched recess in front of the glass doors, ready to be drawn across. Inside
  the recess, against one of the pillars which supported the arch, a high stool
  without a back, taken from the hall, had been placed, and the back legs of
  the stool had been lashed with cord firmly to the pillar, so that it could
  not be moved. The round table had been put in position, with three chairs
  about it. Mme. Dauvray waited impatiently. Celia stood apparently
  unconcerned, apparently lost to all that was going on. Her eyes saw no one.
  Adele looked up at Celia, and laughed maliciously.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, I see, is in the very mood to produce the most wonderful
  phenomena. But it will be better, I think, madame," she said, turning to Mme.
  Dauvray, "that Mlle. Célie should put on those gloves which I see she has
  thrown on to a chair. It will be a little more difficult for mademoiselle to
  loosen these cords, should she wish to do so."</p>

  <p>The argument silenced Celia. If she refused this condition now she would
  excite Mme. Dauvray to a terrible suspicion. She drew on her gloves ruefully
  and slowly, smoothed them over her elbows, and buttoned them. To free her
  hands with her fingers and wrists already hampered in gloves would not be so
  easy a task. But there was no escape. Adele Rossignol was watching her with a
  satiric smile. Mme. Dauvray was urging her to be quick. Obeying a second
  order the girl raised her skirt and extended a slim foot in a pale-green silk
  stocking and a satin slipper to match. Adele was content. Celia was wearing
  the shoes she was meant to wear. They were made upon the very same last as
  those which Celia had just kicked off upstairs. An almost imperceptible nod
  from Helène Vauquier, moreover, assured her.</p>

  <p>She took up a length of the thin cord.</p>

  <p>"Now, how are we to begin?" she said awkwardly. "I think I will ask you,
  mademoiselle, to put your hands behind you."</p>

  <p>Celia turned her back and crossed her wrists. She stood in her satin
  frock, with her white arms and shoulders bare, her slender throat supporting
  her small head with its heavy curls, her big hat &mdash; a picture of young
  grace and beauty. She would have had an easy task that night had there been
  men instead of women to put her to the test. But the women were intent upon
  their own ends: Mme. Dauvray eager for her séance, Adele Tace and Helène
  Vauquier for the climax of their plot.</p>

  <p>Celia clenched her hands to make the muscles of her wrists rigid to resist
  the pressure of the cord. Adele quietly unclasped them and placed them palm
  to palm. And at once Celia became uneasy. It was not merely the action,
  significant though it was of Adele's alertness to thwart her, which troubled
  Celia. But she was extraordinarily receptive of impressions, extraordinarily
  quick to feel, from a touch, some dim sensation of the thought of the one who
  touched her. So now the touch of Adele's swift, strong, nervous hands caused
  her a queer, vague shock of discomfort. It was no more than that at the
  moment, but it was quite definite as that.</p>

  <p>"Keep your hands so, please, mademoiselle," said Adele; "your fingers
  loose."</p>

  <p>And the next moment Celia winced and had to bite her lip to prevent a cry.
  The thin cord was wound twice about her wrists, drawn cruelly tight and then
  cunningly knotted. For one second Celia was thankful for her gloves; the
  next, more than ever she regretted that she wore them. It would have been
  difficult enough for her to free her hands now, even without them. And upon
  that a worse thing befell her.</p>

  <p>"I beg mademoiselle's pardon if I hurt her," said Adele.</p>

  <p>And she tied the girl's thumbs and little fingers. To slacken the knots
  she must have the use of her fingers, even though her gloves made them
  fumble. Now she had lost the use of them altogether. She began to feel that
  she was in master-hands. She was sure of it the next instant. For Adele stood
  up, and, passing a cord round the upper part of her arms, drew her elbows
  back. To bring any strength to help her in wriggling her hands free she must
  be able to raise her elbows. With them trussed in the small of her back she
  was robbed entirely of her strength. And all the time her strange uneasiness
  grew. She made a movement of revolt, and at once the cord was loosened.</p>

  <p>"Mlle. Célie objects to my tests," said Adele, with a laugh, to Mme.
  Dauvray. "And I do not wonder."</p>

  <p>Celia saw upon the old woman's foolish and excited face a look of
  veritable consternation.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid, Célie?" she asked.</p>

  <p>There was anger, there was menace in the voice, but above all these there
  was fear &mdash; fear that her illusions were to tumble about her. Celia
  heard that note and was quelled by it. This folly of belief, these séances,
  were the one touch of colour in Mme. Dauvray's life. And it was just that
  instinctive need of colour which had made her so easy to delude. How strong
  the need is, how seductive the proposal to supply it, Celia knew well. She
  knew it from the experience of her life when the Great Fortinbras was at the
  climax of his fortunes. She had travelled much amongst monotonous, drab towns
  without character or amusements. She had kept her eyes open. She had seen
  that it was from the denizens of the dull streets in these towns that the
  quack religions won their recruits. Mme. Dauvray's life had been a
  featureless sort of affair until these experiments had come to colour it.
  Madame Dauvray must at any rate preserve the memory of that colour.</p>

  <p>"No," she said boldly; "I am not afraid," and after that she moved no
  more.</p>

  <p>Her elbows were drawn firmly back and tightly bound. She was sure she
  could not free them. She glanced in despair at Helène Vauquier, and then some
  glimmer of hope sprang up. For Helène Vauquier gave her a look, a smile of
  reassurance. It was as if she said, "I will come to your help." Then, to make
  security still more sure, Adele turned the girl about as unceremoniously as
  if she had been a doll, and, passing a cord at the back of her arms, drew
  both ends round in front and knotted them at her waist.</p>

  <p>"Now, Célie," said Adele, with a vibration in her voice which Celia had
  not remarked before.</p>

  <p>Excitement was gaining upon her, as upon Mme. Dauvray. Her face was
  flushed and shiny, her manner peremptory and quick. Celia's uneasiness grew
  into fear. She could have used the words which Hanaud spoke the next day in
  that very room &mdash; "There is something here which I do not understand."
  The touch of Adele Tact's hands communicated something to her &mdash;
  something which filled her with a vague alarm. She could not have formulated
  it if she would; she dared not if she could. She had but to stand and
  submit.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Adele.</p>

  <p>She took the girl by the shoulders and set her in a clear space in the
  middle of the room, her back to the recess, her face to the mirror, where all
  could see her.</p>

  <p>"Now, Célie" &mdash; she had dropped the "Mlle." and the ironic suavity of
  her manner &mdash; "try to free yourself."</p>

  <p>For a moment the girl's shoulders worked, her hands fluttered. But they
  remained helplessly bound.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you will be content, Adele, to-night," cried Mme. Dauvray
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>But even in the midst of her eagerness &mdash; so thoroughly had she been
  prepared &mdash; there lingered a flavour of doubt, of suspicion. In Celia's
  mind there was still the one desperate resolve.</p>

  <p>"I must succeed to-night," she said to herself &mdash; "I must!"</p>

  <p>Adele Rossignol kneeled on the floor behind her. She gathered in carefully
  the girl's frock. Then she picked up the long train, wound it tightly round
  her limbs, pinioning and swathing them in the folds of satin, and secured the
  folds with a cord about the knees.</p>

  <p>She stood up again.</p>

  <p>"Can you walk, Célie?" she asked. "Try!"</p>

  <p>With Helène Vauquier to support her if she fell, Celia took a tiny
  shuffling step forward, feeling supremely ridiculous. No one, however, of her
  audience was inclined to laugh. To Mme. Dauvray the whole business was as
  serious as the most solemn ceremonial. Adele was intent upon making her knots
  secure. Helène Vauquier was the well-bred servant who knew her place. It was
  not for her to laugh at her young mistress, in however ludicrous a situation
  she might be.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Adele, "we will tie mademoiselle's ankles, and then we shall
  be ready for Mme. de Montespan."</p>

  <p>The raillery in her voice had a note of savagery in it now. Celia's vague
  terror grew. She had a feeling that a beast was waking in the woman, and with
  it came a growing premonition of failure. Vainly she cried to herself, "I
  must not fail to-night." But she felt instinctively that there was a stronger
  personality than her own in that room, taming her, condemning her to failure,
  influencing the others.</p>

  <p>She was placed in a chair. Adele passed a cord round her ankles, and the
  mere touch of it quickened Celia to a spasm of revolt. Her last little
  remnant of liberty was being taken from her. She raised herself, or rather
  would have raised herself. But Helène with gentle hands held her in the
  chair, and whispered under her breath:</p>

  <p>"Have no fear! Madame is watching."</p>

  <p>Adele looked fiercely up into the girl's face.</p>

  <p>"Keep still, hein, la petite!" she cried. And the epithet &mdash; "little
  one" &mdash; was a light to Celia. Till now, upon these occasions, with her
  black ceremonial dress, her air of aloofness, her vague eyes, and the dignity
  of her carriage, she had already produced some part of their effect before
  the séance had begun. She had been wont to sail into the room, distant,
  mystical. She had her audience already expectant of mysteries, prepared for
  marvels. Her work was already half done. But now of all that help she was
  deprived. She was no longer a person aloof, a prophetess, a seer of visions;
  she was simply a smartly-dressed girl of today, trussed up in a ridiculous
  and painful position &mdash; that was all. The dignity was gone. And the more
  she realised that, the more she was hindered from influencing her audience,
  the less able she was to concentrate her mind upon them, to will them to
  favour her. Mme. Dauvray's suspicions, she was sure, were still awake. She
  could not quell them. There was a stronger personality than hers at work in
  the room. The cord bit through her thin stockings into her ankles. She dared
  not complain. It was savagely tied. She made no remonstrance. And then Helène
  Vauquier raised her up from the chair and lifted her easily off the ground.
  For a moment she held her so. If Celia had felt ridiculous before, she knew
  that she was ten times more so now. She could see herself as she hung in
  Helène Vauquier's arms, with her delicate frock ludicrously swathed and
  swaddled about her legs. But, again, of those who watched her no one
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"We have had no such tests as these," Mme. Dauvray explained, half in
  fear, half in hope.</p>

  <p>Adele Rossignol looked the girl over and nodded her head with
  satisfaction. She had no animosity towards Celia; she had really no feeling
  of any kind for her or against her. Fortunately she was unaware at this time
  that Harry Wethermill had been paying his court to her or it would have gone
  worse with Mlle. Célie before the night was out. Mlle. Célie was just a pawn
  in a very dangerous game which she happened to be playing, and she had
  succeeded in engineering her pawn into the desired condition of helplessness.
  She was content.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," she said, with a smile, "you wish me to believe. You have
  now your opportunity."</p>

  <p>Opportunity! And she was helpless. She knew very well that she could never
  free herself from these cords without Helène's help. She would fail,
  miserably and shamefully fail.</p>

  <p>"It was madame who wished you to believe," she stammered.</p>

  <p>And Adele Rossignol laughed suddenly &mdash; a short, loud, harsh laugh,
  which jarred upon the quiet of the room. It turned Celia's vague alarm into a
  definite terror. Some magnetic current brought her grave messages of fear.
  The air about her seemed to tingle with strange menaces. She looked at Adele.
  Did they emanate from her? And her terror answered her "Yes." She made her
  mistake in that. The strong personality in the room was not Adele Rossignol,
  but Helène Vauquier, who held her like a child in her arms. But she was
  definitely aware of danger, and too late aware of it. She struggled vainly.
  From her head to her feet she was powerless. She cried out hysterically to
  her patron:</p>

  <p>"Madame! Madame! There is something &mdash; a presence here &mdash; some
  one who means harm! I know it!"</p>

  <p>And upon the old woman's face there came a look, not of alarm, but of
  extraordinary relief. The genuine, heartfelt cry restored her confidence in
  Celia.</p>

  <p>"Some one &mdash; who means harm!" she whispered, trembling with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"Ah, mademoiselle is already under control," said Helène, using the jargon
  which she had learnt from Celia's lips.</p>

  <p>Adele Rossignol grinned.</p>

  <p>"Yes, la petite is under control," she repeated, with a sneer; and all the
  elegance of her velvet gown was unable to hide her any longer from Celia's
  knowledge. Her grin had betrayed her. She was of the dregs. But Helène
  Vauquier whispered:</p>

  <p>"Keep still, mademoiselle. I shall help you."</p>

  <p>Vauquier carried the girl into the recess and placed her upon the stool.
  With a long cord Adele bound her by the arms and the waist to the pillar, and
  her ankles she fastened to the rung of the stool, so that they could not
  touch the ground.</p>

  <p>"Thus we shall be sure that when we hear rapping it will be the spirits,
  and not the heels, which rap," she said. "Yes, I am contented now." And she
  added, with a smile, "Célie may even have her scarf," and, picking up a white
  scarf of tulle which Celia had brought down with her, she placed it
  carelessly round her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Helène Vauquier whispered in Celia's ear.</p>

  <p>To the cord about Celia's waist Adele was fastening a longer line.</p>

  <p>"I shall keep my foot on the other end of this," she said, "when the
  lights are out, and I shall know then if our little one frees herself."</p>

  <p>The three women went out of the recess. And the next moment the heavy silk
  curtains swung across the opening, leaving Celia in darkness. Quickly and
  noiselessly the poor girl began to twist and work her hands. But she only
  bruised her wrists. This was to be the last of the séances. But it must
  succeed! So much of Mme. Dauvray's happiness, so much of her own, hung upon
  its success. Let her fail to-night, she would be surely turned from the door.
  The story of her trickery and her exposure would run through Aix. And she had
  not told Harry! It would reach his ears from others. He would never forgive
  her. To face the old, difficult life of poverty and perhaps starvation again,
  and again alone, would be hard enough; but to face it with Harry Wethermill's
  contempt added to its burdens &mdash; as the poor girl believed she surely
  would have to do &mdash; no, that would be impossible! Not this time would
  she turn away from the Seine, because it was so terrible and cold. If she had
  had the courage to tell him yesterday, he would have forgiven, surely he
  would! The tears gathered in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks. What would
  become of her now? She was in pain besides. The cords about her arms and
  ankles tortured her. And she feared &mdash; yes, desperately she feared the
  effect of the exposure upon Mme. Dauvray. She had been treated as a daughter;
  now she was in return to rob Mme. Dauvray of the belief which had become the
  passion of her life.</p>

  <p>"Let us take our seats at the table," she heard Mme. Dauvray say. "Helène,
  you are by the switch of the electric light. Will you turn it off?" And upon
  that Helène whispered, yet so that the whisper reached to Celia and awakened
  hope:</p>

  <p>"Wait! I will see what she is doing."</p>

  <p>The curtains opened, and Helène Vauquier slipped to the girl's side.</p>

  <p>Celia checked her tears. She smiled imploringly, gratefully.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" asked Helène, in a voice so low that the movement of
  her mouth rather than the words made the question clear.</p>

  <p>Celia raised her head to answer. And then a thing incomprehensible to her
  happened. As she opened her lips Helène Vauquier swiftly forced a
  handkerchief in between the girl's teeth, and lifting the scarf from her
  shoulders wound it tightly twice across her mouth, binding her lips, and made
  it fast under the brim of her hat behind her head. Celia tried to scream; she
  could not utter a sound. She stared at Helène with incredulous, horror-
  stricken eyes. Helène nodded at her with a cruel grin of satisfaction, and
  Celia realised, though she did not understand, something of the rancour and
  the hatred which seethed against her in the heart of the woman whom she had
  supplanted. Helène Vauquier meant to expose her to-night; Celia had not a
  doubt of it. That was her explanation of Helène Vauquier's treachery; and
  believing that error, she believed yet another &mdash; that she had reached
  the terrible climax of her troubles. She was only at the beginning of
  them.</p>

  <p>"Helène!" cried Mme. Dauvray sharply. "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>The maid instantly slid back into the room.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle has not moved," she said.</p>

  <p>Celia heard the women settle in their chairs about the table.</p>

  <p>"Is madame ready?" asked Helène; and then there was the sound of the snap
  of a switch. In the salon darkness had come.</p>

  <p>If only she had not been wearing her gloves, Celia thought, she might
  possibly have just been able to free her fingers and her supple hands from
  their bonds. But as it was she was helpless. She could only sit and wait
  until the audience in the salon grew tired of waiting and came to her. She
  closed her eyes, pondering if by any chance she could excuse her failure. But
  her heart sank within her as she thought of Mme. Rossignol's raillery. No, it
  was all over for her...</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes, and she wondered. It seemed to her that there was
  more light in the recess than there had been when she closed them. Very
  likely her eyes were growing used to the darkness. Yet &mdash; yet &mdash;
  she ought not to be able to distinguish quite so clearly the white pillar
  opposite to her. She looked towards the glass doors and understood. The
  wooden shutters outside the doors were not quite closed. They had been
  carelessly left unbolted. A chink from lintel to floor let in a grey thread
  of light. Celia heard the women whispering in the salon, and turned her head
  to catch the words.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear any sound?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Was that a hand which touched me?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"We must wait."</p>

  <p>And so silence came again, and suddenly there was quite a rush of light
  into the recess. Celia was startled. She turned her head back again towards
  the window. The wooden door had swung a little more open. There was a wider
  chink to let the twilight of that starlit darkness through. And as she
  looked, the chink slowly broadened and broadened, the door swung slowly back
  on hinges which were strangely silent. Celia stared at the widening panel of
  grey light with a vague terror. It was strange that she could hear no whisper
  of wind in the garden. Why, oh, why was that latticed door opening so
  noiselessly? Almost she believed that the spirits after all... And suddenly
  the recess darkened again, and Celia sat with her heart leaping and shivering
  in her breast. There was something black against the glass doors &mdash; a
  man. He had appeared as silently, as suddenly, as any apparition. He stood
  blocking out the light, pressing his face against the glass, peering into the
  room.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  </div><br>

  <p>For a moment the shock of horror stunned her. Then she tore frantically at
  the cords. All thought of failure, of exposure, of dismissal had fled from
  her. The three poor women &mdash; that was her thought &mdash; were sitting
  unwarned, unsuspecting, defenceless in the pitch-blackness of the salon. A
  few feet away a man, a thief, was peering in. They were waiting for strange
  things to happen in the darkness. Strange and terrible things would happen
  unless she could free herself, unless she could warn them. And she could not.
  Her struggles were mere efforts to struggle, futile, a shiver from head to
  foot, and noiseless as a shiver. Adele Rossignol had done her work well and
  thoroughly. Celia's arms, her waist, her ankles were pinioned; only the
  bandage over her mouth seemed to be loosening. Then upon horror, horror was
  added. The man touched the glass doors, and they swung silently inwards.
  They, too, had been carelessly left unbolted. The man stepped without a sound
  over the sill into the room. And, as he stepped, fear for herself drove out
  for the moment from Celia's thoughts fear for the three women in the black
  room. If only he did not see her! She pressed herself against the pillar. He
  might overlook her, perhaps! His eyes would not be so accustomed to the
  darkness of the recess as hers. He might pass her unnoticed &mdash; if only
  he did not touch some fold of her dress.</p>

  <p>And then, in the midst of her terror, she experienced so great a revulsion
  from despair to joy that a faintness came upon her, and she almost swooned.
  She saw who the intruder was. For when he stepped into the recess he turned
  towards her, and the dim light struck upon him and showed her the contour of
  his face. It was her lover, Harry Wethermill. Why he had come at this hour,
  and in this strange way, she did not consider. Now she must attract his eyes,
  now her fear was lest he should not see her.</p>

  <p>But he came at once straight towards her. He stood in front of her,
  looking into her eyes. But he uttered no cry. He made no movement of
  surprise. Celia did not understand it. His face was in the shadow now and she
  could not see it. Of course, he was stunned, amazed. But &mdash; but &mdash;
  he stood almost as if he had expected to find her there and just in that
  helpless attitude. It was absurd, of course, but he seemed to look upon her
  helplessness as nothing out of the ordinary way. And he raised no hand to set
  her free. A chill struck through her. But the next moment he did raise his
  hand and the blood flowed again, at her heart. Of course, she was in the
  darkness. He had not seen her plight. Even now he was only beginning to be
  aware of it. For his hand touched the bandage over her mouth &mdash;
  tentatively. He felt for the knot under the broad brim of her hat at the back
  of her head. He found it. In a moment she would be free. She kept her head
  quite still, and then &mdash; why was he so long? she asked herself. Oh, it
  was not possible! But her heart seemed to stop, and she knew that it was not
  only possible &mdash; it was true: he was tightening the scarf, not loosening
  it. The folds bound her lips more surely. She felt the ends drawn close at
  the back of her head. In a frenzy she tried to shake her head free. But he
  held her face firmly and finished his work. He was wearing gloves, she
  noticed with horror, just as thieves do. Then his hands slid down her
  trembling arms and tested the cord about her wrists. There was something
  horribly deliberate about his movements. Celia, even at that moment, even
  with him, had the sensation which had possessed her in the salon. It was the
  personal equation on which she was used to rely. But neither Adele nor this
  &mdash; this STRANGER was considering her as even a human being. She was a
  pawn in their game, and they used her, careless of her terror, her beauty,
  her pain. Then he freed from her waist the long cord which ran beneath the
  curtain to Adele Rossignol's foot. Celia's first thought was one of relief.
  He would jerk the cord unwittingly. They would come into the recess and see
  him. And then the real truth flashed in upon her blindingly. He had jerked
  the cord, but he had jerked it deliberately. He was already winding it up in
  a coil as it slid noiselessly across the polished floor beneath the curtains
  towards him. He had given a signal to Adele Rossignol. All that woman's
  scepticism and precaution against trickery had been a mere blind, under cover
  of which she had been able to pack the girl away securely without arousing
  her suspicions. Helène Vauquier was in the plot, too. The scarf at Celia's
  mouth was proof of that. As if to add proof to proof, she heard Adele
  Rossignol speak in answer to the signal.</p>

  <p>"Are we all ready? Have you got Mme. Dauvray's left hand, Helène?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame," answered the maid.</p>

  <p>"And I have her right hand. Now give me yours, and thus we are in a circle
  about the table."</p>

  <p>Celia, in her mind, could see them sitting about the round table in the
  darkness, Mme. Dauvray between the two women, securely held by them. And she
  herself could not utter a cry &mdash; could not move a muscle to help
  her.</p>

  <p>Wethermill crept back on noiseless feet to the window, closed the wooden
  doors, and slid the bolts into their sockets. Yes, Helène Vauquier was in the
  plot. The bolts and the hinges would not have worked so smoothly but for her.
  Darkness again filled the recess instead of the grey twilight. But in a
  moment a faint breath of wind played upon Celia's forehead, and she knew that
  the man had parted the curtains and slipped into the room. Celia let her head
  fall towards her shoulder. She was sick and faint with terror. Her lover was
  in this plot &mdash; the lover in whom she had felt so much pride, for whose
  sake she had taken herself so bitterly to task. He was the associate of Adele
  Rossignol, of Helène Vauquier. He had used her, Celia, as an instrument for
  his crime. All their hours together at the Villa des Fleurs &mdash; here to-
  night was their culmination. The blood buzzed in her ears and hammered in the
  veins of her temples. In front of her eyes the darkness whirled, flecked with
  fire. She would have fallen, but she could not fall. Then, in the silence, a
  tambourine jangled. There was to be a séance to-night, then, and the séance
  had begun. In a dreadful suspense she heard Mme. Dauvray speak.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19"><small>CHAPTER 19</small></a><br>
  <br>
  HELÈNE EXPLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">And what she heard made her blood run cold.</p>

  <p>Mme Dauvray spoke in a hushed, awestruck voice.</p>

  <p>"There is a presence in the room."</p>

  <p>It was horrible to Celia that the poor woman was speaking the jargon which
  she herself had taught to her.</p>

  <p>"I will speak to it," said Mme. Dauvray, and raising her voice a little,
  she asked: "Who are you that come to us from the spirit-world?"</p>

  <p>No answer came, but all the while Celia knew that Wethermill was stealing
  noiselessly across the floor towards that voice which spoke this professional
  patter with so simple a solemnity.</p>

  <p>"Answer!" she said. And the next moment she uttered a little shrill cry
  &mdash; a cry of enthusiasm. "Fingers touch my forehead &mdash; now they
  touch my cheek &mdash; now they touch my throat!"</p>

  <p>And upon that the voice ceased. But a dry, choking sound was heard, and a
  horrible scuffling and tapping of feet upon the polished floor, a sound most
  dreadful. They were murdering her &mdash; murdering an old, kind woman
  silently and methodically in the darkness. The girl strained and twisted
  against the pillar furiously, like an animal in a trap. But the coils of rope
  held her; the scarf suffocated her. The scuffling became a spasmodic sound,
  with intervals between, and then ceased altogether. A voice spoke &mdash; a
  man's voice &mdash; Wethermill's. But Celia would never have recognised it
  &mdash; it had so shrill and fearful an intonation.</p>

  <p>"That's horrible," he said, and his voice suddenly rose to a scream.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Helène Vauquier whispered sharply. "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"She fell against me &mdash; her whole weight. Oh!"</p>

  <p>"You are afraid of her!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" And in the darkness Wethermill's voice came querulously
  between long breaths. "Yes, NOW I am afraid of her!"</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier replied again contemptuously. She spoke aloud and quite
  indifferently. Nothing of any importance whatever, one would have gathered,
  had occurred.</p>

  <p>"I will turn on the light," she said. And through the chinks in the
  curtain the bright light shone. Celia heard a loud rattle upon the table, and
  then fainter sounds of the same kind. And as a kind of horrible accompaniment
  there ran the laboured breathing of the man, which broke now and then with a
  sobbing sound. They were stripping Mme. Dauvray of her pearl necklace, her
  bracelets, and her rings. Celia had a sudden importunate vision of the old
  woman's fat, podgy hands loaded with brilliants. A jingle of keys
  followed.</p>

  <p>"That's all," Helène Vauquier said. She might have just turned out the
  pocket of an old dress.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of something heavy and inert falling with a dull crash
  upon the floor. A woman laughed, and again it was Helène Vauquier.</p>

  <p>"Which is the key of the safe?" asked Adele.</p>

  <p>And Helène Vauquier replied:-</p>

  <p>"That one."</p>

  <p>Celia heard some one drop heavily into a chair. It was Wethermill, and he
  buried his face in his hands. Helène went over to him and laid her hand upon
  his shoulder and shook him.</p>

  <p>"Do you go and get her jewels out of the safe," she said, and she spoke
  with a rough friendliness.</p>

  <p>"You promised you would blindfold the girl," he cried hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier laughed.</p>

  <p>"Did I?" she said. "Well, what does it matter?" "There would have been no
  need to &mdash; " And his voice broke off shudderingly.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't there? And what of us &mdash; Adele and me? She knows certainly
  that we are here. Come, go and get the jewels. The key of the door's on the
  mantelshelf. While you are away we two will arrange the pretty baby in
  there."</p>

  <p>She pointed to the recess; her voice rang with contempt. Wethermill
  staggered across the room like a drunkard, and picked up the key in trembling
  fingers. Celia heard it turn in the lock, and the door bang. Wethermill had
  gone upstairs.</p>

  <p>Celia leaned back, her heart fainting within her. Arrange! It was her turn
  now. She was to be "arranged." She had no doubt what sinister meaning that
  innocent word concealed. The dry, choking sound, the horrid scuffling of feet
  upon the floor, were in her ears. And it had taken so long &mdash; so
  terribly long!</p>

  <p>She heard the door open again and shut again. Then steps approached the
  recess. The curtains were flung back, and the two women stood in front of her
  &mdash; the tall Adele Rossignol with her red hair and her coarse good looks
  and her sapphire dress, and the hard-featured, sallow maid. The maid was
  carrying Celia's white coat. They did not mean to murder her, then. They
  meant to take her away, and even then a spark of hope lit up in the girl's
  bosom. For even with her illusions crushed she still clung to life with all
  the passion of her young soul.</p>

  <p>The two women stood and looked at her; and then Adele Rossignol burst out
  laughing. Vauquier approached the girl, and Celia had a moment's hope that
  she meant to free her altogether, but she only loosed the cords which fixed
  her to the pillar and the high stool.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle will pardon me for laughing," said Adele Rossignol politely;
  "but it was mademoiselle who invited me to try my hand. And really, for so
  smart a young lady, mademoiselle looks too ridiculous."</p>

  <p>She lifted the girl up and carried her back writhing and struggling into
  the salon. The whole of the pretty room was within view, but in the embrasure
  of a window something lay dreadfully still and quiet. Celia held her head
  averted. But it was there, and, though it was there, all the while the women
  joked and laughed, Adele Rossignol feverishly, Helène Vauquier with a real
  glee most horrible to see.</p>

  <p>"I beg mademoiselle not to listen to what Adele is saying," exclaimed
  Helène. And she began to ape in a mincing, extravagant fashion the manner of
  a saleswoman in a shop. "Mademoiselle has never looked so ravishing. This
  style is the last word of fashion. It is what there is of most chic. Of
  course, mademoiselle understands that the costume is not intended for playing
  the piano. Nor, indeed, for the ballroom. It leaps to one's eyes that dancing
  would be difficult. Nor is it intended for much conversation. It is a costume
  for a mood of quiet reflection. But I assure mademoiselle that for pretty
  young ladies who are the favourites of rich old women it is the style most
  recommended by the criminal classes."</p>

  <p>All the woman's bitter rancour against Celia, hidden for months beneath a
  mask of humility, burst out and ran riot now. She went to Adele Rossignol's
  help, and they flung the girl face downwards upon the sofa. Her face struck
  the cushion at one end, her feet the cushion at the other. The breath was
  struck out of her body. She lay with her bosom heaving.</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier watched her for a moment with a grin, paying herself now
  for her respectful speeches and attendance.</p>

  <p>"Yes, lie quietly and reflect, little fool!" she said savagely. "Were you
  wise to come here and interfere with Helène Vauquier? Hadn't you better have
  stayed and danced in your rags at Montmartre? Are the smart frocks and the
  pretty hats and the good dinners worth the price? Ask yourself these
  questions, my dainty little friend!"</p>

  <p>She drew up a chair to Celia's side, and sat down upon it comfortably.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what we are going to do with you, Mlle. Célie. Adele
  Rossignol and that kind gentleman, M. Wethermill, are going to take you away
  with them. You will be glad to go, won't you, dearie? For you love M.
  Wethermill, don't you? Oh, they won't keep you long enough for you to get
  tired of them. Do not fear! But you will not come back, Mile. Célie. No; you
  have seen too much to-night. And every one will think that Mlle. Célie helped
  to murder and rob her benefactress. They are certain to suspect some one, so
  why not you, pretty one?"</p>

  <p>Celia made no movement. She lay trying to believe that no crime had been
  committed, that that lifeless body did not lie against the wall. And then she
  heard in the room above a bed wheeled roughly from its place.</p>

  <p>The two women heard it too, and looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"He should look in the safe," said Vauquier. "Go and see what he is
  doing."</p>

  <p>And Adele Rossignol ran from the room.</p>

  <p>As soon as she was gone Vauquier followed to the door, listened, closed it
  gently, and came back. She stooped down.</p>

  <p>"Mlle. Célie," she said, in a smooth, silky voice, which terrified the
  girl more than her harsh tones, "there is just one little thing wrong in your
  appearance, one tiny little piece of bad taste, if mademoiselle will pardon a
  poor servant the expression. I did not mention it before Adele Rossignol; she
  is so severe in her criticism, is she not? But since we are alone, I will
  presume to point out to mademoiselle that those diamond eardrops which I see
  peeping out under the scarf are a little ostentatious in her present
  predicament. They are a provocation to thieves. Will mademoiselle permit me
  to remove them?"</p>

  <p>She caught her by the neck and lifted her up. She pushed the lace scarf up
  at the side of Celia's head. Celia began to struggle furiously, convulsively.
  She kicked and writhed, and a little tearing sound was heard. One of her
  shoe-buckles had caught in the thin silk covering of the cushion and slit it.
  Helène Vauquier let her fall. She felt composedly in her pocket, and drew
  from it an aluminium flask &mdash; the same flask which Lemerre was afterward
  to snatch up in the bedroom in Geneva. Celia stared at her in dread. She saw
  the flask flashing in the light. She shrank from it. She wondered what new
  horror was to grip her. Helène unscrewed the top and laughed pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Mlle. Célie is under control," she said. "We shall have to teach her that
  it is not polite in young ladies to kick." She pressed Celia down with a hand
  upon her back, and her voice changed. "Lie still," she commanded savagely.
  "Do you hear? Do you know what this is, Mlle. Célie?" And she held the flask
  towards the girl's face. "This is vitriol, my pretty one. Move, and I'll
  spoil these smooth white shoulders for you. How would you like that?"</p>

  <p>Celia shuddered from head to foot, and, burying her face in the cushion,
  lay trembling. She would have begged for death upon her knees rather than
  suffer this horror. She felt Vauquier's fingers lingering with a dreadful
  caressing touch upon her shoulders and about her throat. She was within an
  ace of the torture, the disfigurement, and she knew it. She could not pray
  for mercy. She could only lie quite still, as she was bidden, trying to
  control the shuddering of her limbs and body.</p>

  <p>"It would be a good lesson for Mlle. Célie," Helène continued slowly. "I
  think that if Mlle. Célie will forgive the liberty I ought to inflict it. One
  little tilt of the flask and the satin of these pretty shoulders&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off suddenly and listened. Some sound heard outside had given
  Celia a respite, perhaps more than a respite. Helène set the flask down upon
  the table. Her avarice had got the better of her hatred. She roughly plucked
  the earrings out of the girl's ears. She hid them quickly in the bosom of her
  dress with her eye upon the door. She did not see a drop of blood gather on
  the lobe of Celia's ear and fall into the cushion on which her face was
  pressed. She had hardly hidden them away before the door opened and Adele
  Rossignol burst into the room.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" asked Vauquier.</p>

  <p>"The safe's empty. We have searched the room. We have found nothing," she
  cried.</p>

  <p>"Everything is in the safe," Helène insisted.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The two women ran out of the room and up the stairs. Celia, lying on the
  settee, heard all the quiet of the house change to noise and confusion. It
  was as though a tornado raged in the room overhead. Furniture was tossed
  about and over the room, feet stamped and ran, locks were smashed in with
  heavy blows. For many minutes the storm raged. Then it ceased, and she heard
  the accomplices clattering down the stairs without a thought of the noise
  they made. They burst into the room. Harry Wethermill was laughing
  hysterically, like a man off his head. He had been wearing a long dark
  overcoat when he entered the house; now he carried the coat over his arm. He
  was in a dinner-jacket, and his black clothes were dusty and disordered.</p>

  <p>"It's all for nothing!" he screamed rather than cried. "Nothing but the
  one necklace and a handful of rings!"</p>

  <p>In a frenzy he actually stooped over the dead woman and questioned
  her.</p>

  <p>"Tell us &mdash; where did you hide them?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"The girl will know," said Helène.</p>

  <p>Wethermill rose up and looked wildly at Celia.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said.</p>

  <p>He had no scruple, no pity any longer for the girl. There was no gain from
  the crime unless she spoke. He would have placed his head in the guillotine
  for nothing. He ran to the writing-table, tore off half a sheet of paper, and
  brought it over with a pencil to the sofa. He gave them to Vauquier to hold,
  and drawing out the sofa from the wall slipped in behind. He lifted up Celia
  with Rossignol's help, and made her sit in the middle of the sofa with her
  feet upon the ground. He unbound her wrists and fingers, and Vauquier placed
  the writing-pad and the paper on the girl's knees. Her arms were still
  pinioned above the elbows; she could not raise her hands high enough to
  snatch the scarf from her lips. But with the pad held up to her she could
  write.</p>

  <p>"Where did she keep her jewels! Quick! Take the pencil and write," said
  Wethermill, holding her left wrist.</p>

  <p>Vauquier thrust the pencil into her right hand, and awkwardly and slowly
  her gloved fingers moved across the page.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she wrote; and, with an oath, Wethermill snatched the
  paper up, tore it into pieces, and threw it down.</p>

  <p>"You have got to know," he said, his face purple with passion, and he
  flung out his arm as though he would dash his fist into her face. But as he
  stood with his arm poised there came a singular change upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anything?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p>All listened, and all heard in the quiet of the night a faint click, and
  after an interval they heard it again, and after another but shorter interval
  yet once more.</p>

  <p>"That's the gate," said Wethermill in a whisper of fear, and a pulse of
  hope stirred within Celia.</p>

  <p>He seized her wrists, crushed them together behind her, and swiftly
  fastened them once more. Adele Rossignol sat down upon the floor, took the
  girl's feet upon her lap, and quietly wrenched off her shoes.</p>

  <p>"The light," cried Wethermill in an agonised voice, and Helena Vauquier
  flew across the room and turned it off.</p>

  <p>All three stood holding their breath, straining their ears in the dark
  room. On the hard gravel of the drive outside footsteps became faintly
  audible, and grew louder and came near. Adele whispered to Vauquier:</p>

  <p>"Has the girl a lover?"</p>

  <p>And Helène Vauquier, even at that moment, laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>All Celia's heart and youth rose in revolt against her extremity. If she
  could only free her lips! The footsteps came round the corner of the house,
  they sounded on the drive outside the very window of this room. One cry, and
  she would be saved. She tossed back her head and tried to force the
  handkerchief out from between her teeth. But Wethermill's hand covered her
  mouth and held it closed. The footsteps stopped, a light shone for a moment
  outside. The very handle of the door was tried. Within a few yards help was
  there &mdash; help and life. Just a frail latticed wooden door stood between
  her and them. She tried to rise to her feet. Adele Rossignol held her legs
  firmly. She was powerless. She sat with one desperate hope that, whoever it
  was who was in the garden, he would break in. Were it even another murderer,
  he might have more pity than the callous brutes who held her now; he could
  have no less. But the footsteps moved away. It was the withdrawal of all
  hope. Celia heard Wethermill behind her draw a long breath of relief. That
  seemed to Celia almost the cruellest part of the whole tragedy. They waited
  in the darkness until the faint click of the gate was heard once more. Then
  the light was turned up again.</p>

  <p>"We must go," said Wethermill. All the three of them were shaken. They
  stood looking at one another, white and trembling. They spoke in whispers. To
  get out of the room, to have done with the business &mdash; that had suddenly
  become their chief necessity.</p>

  <p>Adele picked up the necklace and the rings from the satin-wood table and
  put them into a pocket-bag which was slung at her waist.</p>

  <p>"Hippolyte shall turn these things into money," she said. "He shall set
  about it to-morrow. We shall have to keep the girl now &mdash; until she
  tells us where the rest is hidden."</p>

  <p>"Yes, keep her," said Helène. "We will come over to Geneva in a few days,
  as soon as we can. We will persuade her to tell." She glanced darkly at the
  girl. Celia shivered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's it," said Wethermill. "But don't harm her. She will tell of
  her own will. You will see. The delay won't hurt now. We can't come back and
  search for a little while."</p>

  <p>He was speaking in a quick, agitated voice. And Adele agreed. The desire
  to be gone had killed even their fury at the loss of their prize. Some time
  they would come back, but they would not search now &mdash; they were too
  unnerved.</p>

  <p>"Helène," said Wethermill, "get to bed. I'll come up with the chloroform
  and put you to sleep."</p>

  <p>Helène Vauquier hurried upstairs. It was part of her plan that she should
  be left alone in the villa chloroformed. Thus only could suspicion be averted
  from herself. She did not shrink from the completion of the plan now. She
  went, the strange woman, without a tremor to her ordeal. Wethermill took the
  length of rope which had fixed Celia to the pillar.</p>

  <p>"I'll follow," he said, and as he turned he stumbled over the body of Mme.
  Dauvray. With a shrill cry he kicked it out of his way and crept up the
  stairs. Adele Rossignol quickly set the room in order. She removed the stool
  from its position in the recess, and carried it to its place in the hall. She
  put Celia's shoes upon her feet, loosening the cord from her ankles. Then she
  looked about the floor and picked up here and there a scrap of cord. In the
  silence the clock upon the mantelshelf chimed the quarter past eleven. She
  screwed the stopper on the flask of vitriol very carefully, and put the flask
  away in her pocket. She went into the kitchen and fetched the key of the
  garage. She put her hat on her head. She even picked up and drew on her
  gloves, afraid lest she should leave them behind; and then Wethermill came
  down again. Adele looked at him inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"It is all done," he said, with a nod of the head. "I will bring the car
  down to the door. Then I'll drive you to Geneva and come back with the car
  here."</p>

  <p>He cautiously opened the latticed door of the window, listened for a
  moment, and ran silently down the drive. Adele closed the door again, but she
  did not bolt it. She came back into the room; she looked at Celia, as she lay
  back upon the settee, with a long glance of indecision. And then, to Celia's
  surprise &mdash; for she had given up all hope &mdash; the indecision in her
  eyes became pity. She suddenly ran across the room and knelt down before
  Celia. With quick and feverish hands she untied the cord which fastened the
  train of her skirt about her knees.</p>

  <p>At first Celia shrank away, fearing some new cruelty. But Adele's voice
  came to her ears, speaking &mdash; and speaking with remorse.</p>

  <p>"I can't endure it!" she whispered. "You are so young &mdash; too young to
  be killed."</p>

  <p>The tears were rolling down Celia's cheeks. Her face was pitiful and
  beseeching.</p>

  <p>"Don't look at me like that, for God's sake, child!" Adele went on, and
  she chafed the girl's ankles for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Can you stand?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Celia nodded her head gratefully. After all, then, she was not to die. It
  seemed to her hardly possible. But before she could rise a subdued whirr of
  machinery penetrated into the room, and the motor-car came slowly to the
  front of the villa.</p>

  <p>"Keep still!" said Adele hurriedly, and she placed herself in front of
  Celia.</p>

  <p>Wethermill opened the wooden door, while Celia's heart raced in her
  bosom.</p>

  <p>"I will go down and open the gate," he whispered. "Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Wethermill disappeared; and this time he left the door open. Adele helped
  Celia to her feet. For a moment she tottered; then she stood firm.</p>

  <p>"Now run!" whispered Adele. "Run, child, for your life!"</p>

  <p>Celia did not stop to think whither she should run, or how she should
  escape from Wethermill's search. She could not ask that her lips and her
  hands might be freed. She had but a few seconds. She had one thought &mdash;
  to hide herself in the darkness of the garden. Celia fled across the room,
  sprang wildly over the sill, ran, tripped over her skirt, steadied herself,
  and was swung off the ground by the arms of Harry Wethermill.</p>

  <p>"There we are," he said, with his shrill, wavering laugh. "I opened the
  gate before." And suddenly Celia hung inert in his arms.</p>

  <p>The light went out in the salon. Adele Rossignol, carrying Celia's cloak,
  stepped out at the side of the window.</p>

  <p>"She has fainted," said Wethermill. "Wipe the mould off her shoes and off
  yours too &mdash; carefully. I don't want them to think this car has been out
  of the garage at all."</p>

  <p>Adele stooped and obeyed. Wethermill opened the door of the car and flung
  Celia into a seat. Adele followed and took her seat opposite the girl.
  Wethermill stepped carefully again on to the grass, and with the toe of his
  shoe scraped up and ploughed the impressions which he and Adele Rossignol had
  made on the ground, leaving those which Celia had made. He came back to the
  window.</p>

  <p>"She has left her footmarks clear enough," he whispered. "There will be no
  doubt in the morning that she went of her own free will."</p>

  <p>Then he took the chauffeur's seat, and the car glided silently down the
  drive and out by the gate. As soon as it was on the road it stopped. In an
  instant Adele Rossignol's head was out of the window.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she exclaimed in fear.</p>

  <p>Wethermill pointed to the roof. He had left the light burning in Helène
  Vauquier's room.</p>

  <p>"We can't go back now," said Adele in a frantic whisper. "No; it is over.
  I daren't go back." And Wethermill jammed down the lever. The car sprang
  forward, and humming steadily over the white road devoured the miles. But
  they had made their one mistake.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20"><small>CHAPTER 20</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE GENEVA ROAD</h2>

  <p class="first">The car had nearly reached Annecy before Celia woke to
  consciousness. And even then she was dazed. She was only aware that she was
  in the motor-car and travelling at a great speed. She lay back, drinking in
  the fresh air. Then she moved, and with the movement came to her recollection
  and the sense of pain. Her arms and wrists were still bound behind her, and
  the cords hurt her like hot wires. Her mouth, however, and her feet were
  free. She started forward, and Adele Rossignol spoke sternly from the seat
  opposite.</p>

  <p>"Keep still. I am holding the flask in my hand. If you scream, if you make
  a movement to escape, I shall fling the vitriol in your face," she said.</p>

  <p>Celia shrank back, shivering.</p>

  <p>"I won't! I won't!" she whispered piteously. Her spirit was broken by the
  horrors of the night's adventure. She lay back and cried quietly in the
  darkness of the carriage. The car dashed through Annecy. It seemed incredible
  to Celia that less than six hours ago she had been dining with Mme. Dauvray
  and the woman opposite, who was now her jailer. Mme. Dauvray lay dead in the
  little salon, and she herself &mdash; she dared not think what lay in front
  of her. She was to be persuaded &mdash; that was the word &mdash; to tell
  what she did not know. Meanwhile her name would be execrated through Aix as
  the murderess of the woman who had saved her. Then suddenly the car stopped.
  There were lights outside. Celia heard voices. A man was speaking to
  Wethermill. She started and saw Adele Tace's arm flash upwards. She sank back
  in terror; and the car rolled on into the darkness. Adele Tace drew a breath
  of relief. The one point of danger had been passed. They had crossed the Pont
  de la Caille, they were in Switzerland.</p>

  <p>Some long while afterwards the car slackened its speed. By the side of it
  Celia heard the sound of wheels and of the hooves of a horse. A single-horsed
  closed landau had been caught up as it jogged along the road. The motor-car
  stopped; close by the side of it the driver of the landau reined in his
  horse. Wethermill jumped down from the chauffeur's seat, opened the door of
  the landau, and then put his head in at the window of the car.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready? Be quick!"</p>

  <p>Adele turned to Celia.</p>

  <p>"Not a word, remember!"</p>

  <p>Wethermill flung open the door of the car. Adele took the girl's feet and
  drew them down to the step of the car. Then she pushed her out. Wethermill
  caught her in his arms and carried her to the landau. Celia dared not cry
  out. Her hands were helpless, her face at the mercy of that grim flask. Just
  ahead of them the lights of Geneva were visible, and from the lights a silver
  radiance overspread a patch of sky. Wethermill placed her in the landau;
  Adele sprang in behind her and closed the door. The transfer had taken no
  more than a few seconds. The landau jogged into Geneva; the motor turned and
  sped back over the fifty miles of empty road to Aix.</p>

  <p>As the motor-car rolled away, courage returned for a moment to Celia. The
  man &mdash; the murderer &mdash; had gone. She was alone with Adele Rossignol
  in a carriage moving no faster than an ordinary trot. Her ankles were free,
  the gag had been taken from her lips. If only she could free her hands and
  choose a moment when Adele was off her guard she might open the door and
  spring out on to the road. She saw Adele draw down the blinds of the
  carriage, and very carefully, very secretly, Celia began to work her hands
  behind her. She was an adept; no movement was visible, but, on the other
  hand, no success was obtained. The knots had been too cunningly tied. And
  then Mme. Rossignol touched a button at her side in the leather of the
  carriage.</p>

  <p>The touch turned on a tiny lamp in the roof of the carriage, and she
  raised a warning hand to Celia.</p>

  <p>"Now keep very quiet."</p>

  <p>Right through the empty streets of Geneva the landau was quietly driven.
  Adele had peeped from time to time under the blind. There were few people in
  the streets. Once or twice a sergent-de-ville was seen under the light of a
  lamp. Celia dared not cry out. Over against her, persistently watching her,
  Adele Rossignol sat with the open flask clenched in her hand, and from the
  vitriol Celia shrank with an overwhelming terror. The carriage drove out from
  the town along the western edge of the lake.</p>

  <p>"Now listen," said Adele. "As soon as the landau stops the door of the
  house opposite to which it stops will open. I shall open the carriage door
  myself and you will get out. You must stand close by the carriage door until
  I have got out. I shall hold this flask ready in my hand. As soon as I am out
  you will run across the pavement into the house. You won't speak or
  scream."</p>

  <p>Adele Rossignol turned out the lamp and ten minutes later the carriage
  passed down the little street and attracted Mme. Gobin's notice. Marthe Gobin
  had lit no light in her room. Adele Rossignol peered out of the carriage. She
  saw the houses in darkness. She could not see the busybody's face watching
  the landau from a dark window. She cut the cords which fastened the girl's
  hands. The carriage stopped. She opened the door. Celia sprang out on to the
  pavement. She sprang so quickly that Adele Rossignol caught and held the
  train of her dress. But it was the fear of the vitriol which had made her
  spring so nimbly. It was that, too, which made her run so lightly and quickly
  into the house. The old woman who acted as servant, Jeanne Tace, received
  her. Celia offered no resistance. The fear of vitriol had made her supple as
  a glove. Jeanne hurried her down the stairs into the little parlour at the
  back of the house, where supper was laid, and pushed her into a chair. Celia
  let her arms fall forward on the table. She had no hope now. She was
  friendless and alone in a den of murderers, who meant first to torture, then
  to kill her. She would be held up to execration as a murderess. No one would
  know how she had died or what she had suffered. She was in pain, and her
  throat burned. She buried her face in her arms and sobbed. All her body shook
  with her sobbing. Jeanne Rossignol took no notice. She treated Célie just as
  the others had done. Celia was la petite, against whom she had no animosity,
  by whom she was not to be touched to any tenderness. La petite had
  unconsciously played her useful part in their crime. But her use was ended
  now, and they would deal with her accordingly. She removed the girl's hat and
  cloak and tossed them aside.</p>

  <p>"Now stay quiet until we are ready for you," she said. And Celia, lifting
  her head, said in a whisper:</p>

  <p>"Water!"</p>

  <p>The old woman poured some from a jug and held the glass to Celia's
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," whispered Celia gratefully, and Adele came into the room. She
  told the story of the night to Jeanne, and afterwards to Hippolyte when he
  joined them.</p>

  <p>"And nothing gained!" cried the older woman furiously. "And we have hardly
  a five-franc piece in the house."</p>

  <p>"Yes, something," said Adele. "A necklace &mdash; a good one &mdash; some
  good rings, and bracelets. And we shall find out where the rest is hid
  &mdash; from her." And she nodded at Celia.</p>

  <p>The three people ate their supper, and, while they ate it, discussed
  Celia's fate. She was lying with her head bowed upon her arms at the same
  table, within a foot of them. But they made no more of her presence than if
  she had been an old shoe. Only once did one of them speak to her.</p>

  <p>"Stop your whimpering," said Hippolyte roughly. "We can hardly hear
  ourselves talk."</p>

  <p>He was for finishing with the business altogether to-night.</p>

  <p>"It's a mistake," he said. "There's been a bungle, and the sooner we are
  rid of it the better. There's a boat at the bottom of the garden."</p>

  <p>Celia listened and shuddered. He would have no more compunction over
  drowning her than he would have had over drowning a blind kitten.</p>

  <p>"It's cursed luck," he said. "But we have got the necklace &mdash; that's
  something. That's our share, do you see? The young spark can look for the
  rest."</p>

  <p>But Helène Vauquier's wish prevailed. She was the leader. They would keep
  the girl until she came to Geneva.</p>

  <p>They took her upstairs into the big bedroom overlooking the lake. Adele
  opened the door of the closet, where a truckle-bed stood, and thrust the girl
  in.</p>

  <p>"This is my room," she said warningly, pointing to the bedroom. "Take care
  I hear no noise. You might shout yourself hoarse, my pretty one; no one else
  would hear you. But I should, and afterwards &mdash; we should no longer be
  able to call you 'my pretty one,' eh?"</p>

  <p>And with a horrible playfulness she pinched the girl's cheek.</p>

  <p>Then with old Jeanne's help she stripped Celia and told her to get into
  bed.</p>

  <p>"I'll give her something to keep her quiet," said Adele, and she fetched
  her morphia-needle and injected a dose into Celia's arm.</p>

  <p>Then they took her clothes away and left her in the darkness. She heard
  the key turn in the lock, and a moment after the sound of the bedstead being
  drawn across the doorway. But she heard no more, for almost immediately she
  fell asleep.</p>

  <p>She was awakened some time the next day by the door opening. Old Jeanne
  Tace brought her in a jug of water and a roll of bread, and locked her up
  again. And a long time afterwards she brought her another supply. Yet another
  day had gone, but in that dark cupboard Celia had no means of judging time.
  In the afternoon the newspaper came out with the announcement that Mme.
  Dauvray's jewellery had been discovered under the boards. Hippolyte brought
  in the newspaper, and, cursing their stupidity, they sat down to decide upon
  Celia's fate. That, however, was soon arranged. They would dress her in
  everything which she wore when she came, so that no trace of her might be
  discovered. They would give her another dose of morphia, sew her up in a sack
  as soon as she was unconscious, row her far out on to the lake, and sink her
  with a weight attached. They dragged her out from the cupboard, always with
  the threat of that bright aluminium flask before her eyes. She fell upon her
  knees, imploring their pity with the tears running down her cheeks; but they
  sewed the strip of sacking over her face so that she should see nothing of
  their preparations. They flung her on the sofa, secured her as Hanaud had
  found her, and, leaving her in the old woman's charge, sent down Adele for
  her needle and Hippolyte to get ready the boat. As Hippolyte opened the door
  he saw the launch of the Chef de la Sûreté glide along the bank.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21"><small>CHAPTER 21</small></a><br>
  <br>
  HANAUD EXPLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">This is the story as Mr. Ricardo wrote it out from the
  statement of Celia herself and the confession of Adele Rossignol. Obscurities
  which had puzzled him were made clear. But he was still unaware how Hanaud
  had worked out the solution.</p>

  <p>"You promised me that you would explain," he said, when they were both
  together after the trial was over at Aix. The two men had just finished
  luncheon at the Cercle and were sitting over their coffee. Hanaud lighted a
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"There were difficulties, of course," he said; "the crime was so carefully
  planned. The little details, such as the footprints, the absence of any mud
  from the girl's shoes in the carriage of the motor-car, the dinner at Annecy,
  the purchase of the cord, the want of any sign of a struggle in the little
  salon, were all carefully thought out. Had not one little accident happened,
  and one little mistake been made in consequence, I doubt if we should have
  laid our hands upon one of the gang. We might have suspected Wethermill; we
  should hardly have secured him, and we should very likely never have known of
  the Tace family. That mistake was, as you no doubt are fully
  aware&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The failure of Wethermill to discover Mme. Dauvray's jewels," said
  Ricardo at once.</p>

  <p>"No, my friend," answered Hanaud. "That made them keep Mlle. Célie alive.
  It enabled us to save her when we had discovered the whereabouts of the gang.
  It did not help us very much to lay our hands upon them. No; the little
  accident which happened was the entrance of our friend Perrichet into the
  garden while the murderers were still in the room. Imagine that scene, M.
  Ricardo. The rage of the murderers at their inability to discover the plunder
  for which they had risked their necks, the old woman crumpled up on the floor
  against the wall, the girl writing laboriously with fettered arms 'I do not
  know' under threats of torture, and then in the stillness of the night the
  clear, tiny click of the gate and the measured, relentless footsteps. No
  wonder they were terrified in that dark room. What would be their one
  thought? Why, to get away &mdash; to come back perhaps later, when Mlle.
  Célie should have told them what, by the way, she did not know, but in any
  case to get away now. So they made their little mistake, and in their hurry
  they left the light burning in the room of Helène Vauquier, and the murder
  was discovered seven hours too soon for them."</p>

  <p>"Seven hours!" said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The household did not rise early. It was not until seven that the
  charwoman came. It was she who was meant to discover the crime. By that time
  the motor-car would have been back three hours ago in its garage. Servettaz,
  the chauffeur, would have returned from Chambery some time in the morning, he
  would have cleaned the car, he would have noticed that there was very little
  petrol in the tank, as there had been when he had left it on the day before.
  He would not have noticed that some of his many tins which had been full
  yesterday were empty to-day. We should not have discovered that about four in
  the morning the car was close to the Villa Rose and that it had travelled,
  between midnight and five in the morning, a hundred and fifty
  kilometres."</p>

  <p>"But you had already guessed 'Geneva,'" said Ricardo. "At luncheon, before
  the news came that the car was found, you had guessed it."</p>

  <p>"It was a shot," said Hanaud. "The absence of the car helped me to make
  it. It is a large city and not very far away, a likely place for people with
  the police at their heels to run to earth in. But if the car had been
  discovered in the garage I should not have made that shot. Even then I had no
  particular conviction about Geneva. I really wished to see how Wethermill
  would take it. He was wonderful."</p>

  <p>"He sprang up."</p>

  <p>"He betrayed nothing but surprise. You showed no less surprise than he
  did, my good friend. What I was looking for was one glance of fear. I did not
  get it."</p>

  <p>"Yet you suspected him &mdash; even then you spoke of brains and audacity.
  You told him enough to hinder him from communicating with the red- haired
  woman in Geneva. You isolated him. Yes, you suspected him."</p>

  <p>"Let us take the case from the beginning. When you first came to me, as I
  told you, the Commissaire had already been with me. There was an interesting
  piece of evidence already in his possession. Adolphe Ruel &mdash; who saw
  Wethermill and Vauquier together close by the Casino and overheard that cry
  of Wethermill's, 'It is true: I must have money!' &mdash; had already been
  with his story to the Commissaire. I knew it when Harry Wethermill came into
  the room to ask me to take up the case. That was a bold stroke, my friend.
  The chances were a hundred to one that I should not interrupt my holiday to
  take up a case because of your little dinner-party in London. Indeed, I
  should not have interrupted it had I not known Adolphe Ruel's story. As it
  was I could not resist. Wethermill's very audacity charmed me. Oh yes, I felt
  that I must pit myself against him. So few criminals have spirit, M. Ricardo.
  It is deplorable how few. But Wethermill! See in what a fine position he
  would have been if only I had refused. He himself had been the first to call
  upon the first detective in France. And his argument! He loved Mlle. Célie.
  Therefore she must be innocent! How he stuck to it! People would have said,
  'Love is blind,' and all the more they would have suspected Mile. Célie. Yes,
  but they love the blind lover. Therefore all the more would it have been
  impossible for them to believe Harry Wethermill had any share in that grim
  crime."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo drew his chair closer in to the table.</p>

  <p>"I will confess to you," he said, "that I thought Mlle. Célie was an
  accomplice."</p>

  <p>"It is not surprising," said Hanaud. "Some one within the house was an
  accomplice &mdash; we start with that fact. The house had not been broken
  into. There was Mlle. Célie's record as Helène Vauquier gave it to us, and a
  record obviously true. There was the fact that she had got rid of Servettaz.
  There was the maid upstairs very ill from the chloroform. What more likely
  than that Mlle. Célie had arranged a séance, and then when the lights were
  out had admitted the murderer through that convenient glass door?"</p>

  <p>"There were, besides, the definite imprints of her shoes," said Mr.
  Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that is precisely where I began to feel sure that she was
  innocent," replied Hanaud dryly. "All the other footmarks had been so
  carefully scored and ploughed up that nothing could be made of them. Yet
  those little ones remained so definite, so easily identified, and I began to
  wonder why these, too, had not been cut up and stamped over. The murderers
  had taken, you see, an excess of precaution to throw the presumption of guilt
  upon Mlle. Célie rather than upon Vauquier. However, there the footsteps
  were. Mlle. Célie had sprung from the room as I described to Wethermill. But
  I was puzzled. Then in the room I found the torn-up sheet of notepaper with
  the words, 'Je ne sais pas,' in mademoiselle's handwriting. The words might
  have been spirit-writing, they might have meant anything. I put them away in
  my mind. But in the room the settee puzzled me. And again I was troubled
  &mdash; greatly troubled."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw that."</p>

  <p>"And not you alone," said Hanaud, with a smile. "Do you remember that loud
  cry Wethermill gave when we returned to the room and once more I stood before
  the settee? Oh, he turned it off very well. I had said that our criminals in
  France were not very gentle with their victims, and he pretended that it was
  in fear of what Mlle. Célie might be suffering which had torn that cry from
  his heart. But it was not so. He was afraid &mdash; deadly afraid &mdash; not
  for Mlle. Célie, but for himself. He was afraid that I had understood what
  these cushions had to tell me."</p>

  <p>"What did they tell you?" asked Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"You know now," said Hanaud. "They were two cushions, both indented, and
  indented in different ways. The one at the head was irregularly indented
  &mdash; something shaped had pressed upon it. It might have been a face
  &mdash; it might not; and there was a little brown stain which was fresh and
  which was blood. The second cushion had two separate impressions, and between
  them the cushion was forced up in a thin ridge; and these impressions were
  more definite. I measured the distance between the two cushions, and I found
  this: that supposing &mdash; and it was a large supposition &mdash; the
  cushions had not been moved since those impressions were made, a girl of
  Mlle. Célie's height lying stretched out upon the sofa would have her face
  pressing down upon one cushion and her feet and insteps upon the other. Now,
  the impressions upon the second cushion and the thin ridge between them were
  just the impressions which might have been made by a pair of shoes held close
  together. But that would not be a natural attitude for any one, and the mark
  upon the head cushion was very deep. Supposing that my conjectures were true,
  then a woman would only lie like that because she was helpless, because she
  had been flung there, because she could not lift herself &mdash; because, in
  a word, her hands were tied behind her back and her feet fastened together.
  Well, then, follow this train of reasoning, my friend! Suppose my conjectures
  &mdash; and we had nothing but conjectures to build upon-were true, the woman
  flung upon the sofa could not be Helène Vauquier, for she would have said so;
  she could have had no reason for concealment. But it must be Mlle. Célie.
  There was the slit in the one cushion and the stain on the other which, of
  course, I had not accounted for. There was still, too, the puzzle of the
  footsteps outside the glass doors. If Mlle. Célie had been bound upon the
  sofa, how came she to run with her limbs free from the house? There was a
  question &mdash; a question not easy to answer."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but there was also another question. Suppose that Mlle. Célie was,
  after all, the victim, not the accomplice; suppose she had been flung tied
  upon the sofa; suppose that somehow the imprint of her shoes upon the ground
  had been made, and that she had afterwards been carried away, so that the
  maid might be cleared of all complicity &mdash; in that case it became
  intelligible why the other footprints were scored out and hers left. The
  presumption of guilt would fall upon her. There would be proof that she ran
  hurriedly from the room and sprang into a motor-car of her own free will.
  But, again, if that theory were true, then Helène Vauquier was the accomplice
  and not Mlle. Célie."</p>

  <p>"I follow that."</p>

  <p>"Then I found an interesting piece of evidence with regard to the strange
  woman who came: I picked up a long red hair &mdash; a very important piece of
  evidence about which I thought it best to say nothing at all. It was not
  Mlle. Célie's hair, which is fair; nor Vauquier's, which is black; nor Mme.
  Dauvray's, which is dyed brown; nor the charwoman's, which is grey. It was,
  therefore, the visitor's. Well, we went upstairs to Mile. Célie's room."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Ricardo eagerly. "We are coming to the pot of cream."</p>

  <p>"In that room we learnt that Helène Vauquier, at her own request, had
  already paid it a visit. It is true the Commissaire said that he had kept his
  eye on her the whole time. But none the less from the window he saw me coming
  down the road, and that he could not have done, as I made sure, unless he had
  turned his back upon Vauquier and leaned out of the window. Now at the time I
  had an open mind about Vauquier. On the whole I was inclined to think she had
  no share in the affair. But either she or Mlle. Célie had, and perhaps both.
  But one of them &mdash; yes. That was sure. Therefore I asked what drawers
  she touched after the Commissaire had leaned out of the window. For if she
  had any motive in wishing to visit the room she would have satisfied it when
  the Commissaire's back was turned. He pointed to a drawer, and I took out a
  dress and shook it, thinking that she may have wished to hide something. But
  nothing fell out. On the other hand, however, I saw some quite fresh grease-
  marks, made by fingers, and the marks were wet. I began to ask myself how it
  was that Helène Vauquier, who had just been helped to dress by the nurse, had
  grease upon her fingers. Then I looked at a drawer which she had examined
  first of all. There were no grease-marks on the clothes she had turned over
  before the Commissaire leaned out of the window. Therefore it followed that
  during the few seconds when he was watching me she had touched grease. I
  looked about the room, and there on the dressing-table close by the chest of
  drawers was a pot of cold cream. That was the grease Helène Vauquier had
  touched. And why &mdash; if not to hide some small thing in it which,
  firstly, she dared not keep in her own room; which, secondly, she wished to
  hide in the room of Mlle. Célie; and which, thirdly, she had not had an
  opportunity to hide before? Now bear those three conditions in mind, and tell
  me what the small thing was."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"I know now," he said. "You told me. The earrings of Mlle. Célie. But I
  should not have guessed it at the time."</p>

  <p>"Nor could I &mdash; at the time," said Hanaud. "I kept my open mind about
  Helène Vauquier; but I locked the door and took the key. Then we went and
  heard Vauquier's story. The story was clever, because so much of it was
  obviously, indisputably true. The account of the séances, of Mme. Dauvray's
  superstitions, her desire for an interview with Mme. de Montespan &mdash;
  such details are not invented. It was interesting, too, to know that there
  had been a séance planned for that night! The method of the murder began to
  be clear. So far she spoke the truth. But then she lied. Yes, she lied, and
  it was a bad lie, my friend. She told us that the strange woman Adele had
  black hair. Now I carried in my pocket-book proof that that woman's hair was
  red. Why did she lie, except to make impossible the identification of that
  strange visitor? That was the first false step taken by Helène Vauquier.</p>

  <p>"Now let us take the second. I thought nothing of her rancour against
  Mlle. Célie. To me it was all very natural. She &mdash; the hard peasant
  woman no longer young, who had been for years the confidential servant of
  Mme. Dauvray, and no doubt had taken her levy from the impostors who preyed
  upon her credulous mistress &mdash; certainly she would hate this young and
  pretty outcast whom she has to wait upon, whose hair she has to dress.
  Vauquier &mdash; she would hate her. But if by any chance she were in the
  plot &mdash; and the lie seemed to show she was &mdash; then the séances
  showed me new possibilities. For Helène used to help Mlle. Célie. Suppose
  that the séance had taken place, that this sceptical visitor with the red
  hair professed herself dissatisfied with Vauquier's method of testing the
  medium, had suggested another way, Mlle. Célie could not object, and there
  she would be neatly and securely packed up beyond the power of offering any
  resistance, before she could have a suspicion that things were wrong. It
  would be an easy little comedy to play. And if that were true &mdash; why,
  there were my sofa cushions partly explained."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see!" cried Ricardo, with enthusiasm. "You are wonderful."</p>

  <p>Hanaud was not displeased with his companion's enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"But wait a moment. We have only conjectures so far, and one fact that
  Helène Vauquier lied about the colour of the strange woman's hair. Now we get
  another fact. Mlle. Célie was wearing buckles on her shoes. And there is my
  slit in the sofa cushions. For when she is flung on to the sofa, what will
  she do? She will kick, she will struggle. Of course it is conjecture. I do
  not as yet hold pigheadedly to it. I am not yet sure that Mlle. Célie is
  innocent. I am willing at any moment to admit that the facts contradict my
  theory. But, on the contrary, each fact that I discover helps it to take
  shape.</p>

  <p>"Now I come to Helène Vauquier's second mistake. On the evening when you
  saw Mlle. Célie in the garden behind the baccarat-rooms you noticed that she
  wore no jewellery except a pair of diamond eardrops. In the photograph of her
  which Wethermill showed me, again she was wearing them. Is it not, therefore,
  probable that she usually wore them? When I examined her room I found the
  case for those earrings &mdash; the case was empty. It was natural, then, to
  infer that she was wearing them when she came down to the séance."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, I read a description &mdash; a carefully written description
  &mdash; of the missing girl, made by Helène Vauquier after an examination of
  the girl's wardrobe. There is no mention of the earrings. So I asked her
  &mdash; 'Was she not wearing them?' Helène Vauquier was taken by surprise.
  How should I know anything of Mlle. Célie's earrings? She hesitated. She did
  not quite know what answer to make. Now, why? Since she herself dressed Mile.
  Célie, and remembers so very well all she wore, why does she hesitate? Well,
  there is a reason. She does not know how much I know about those diamond
  eardrops. She is not sure whether we have not dipped into that pot of cold
  cream and found them. Yet without knowing she cannot answer. So now we come
  back to our pot of cold cream."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" cried Mr. Ricardo. "They were there."</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit," said Hanaud. "Let us see how it works out. Remember the
  conditions. Vauquier has some small thing which she must hide, and which she
  wishes to hide in Mlle. Célie's room. For she admitted that it was her
  suggestion that she should look through mademoiselle's wardrobe. For what
  reason does she choose the girl's room, except that if the thing were
  discovered that would be the natural place for it? It is, then, something
  belonging to Mlle. Célie. There was a second condition we laid down. It was
  something Vauquier had not been able to hide before. It came, then, into her
  possession last night. Why could she not bide it last night? Because she was
  not alone. There were the man and the woman, her accomplices. It was
  something, then, which she was concerned in hiding from them. It is not rash
  to guess, then, that it was some piece of the plunder of which the other two
  would have claimed their share &mdash; and a piece of plunder belonging to
  Mlle. Célie. Well, she has nothing but the diamond eardrops. Suppose Vauquier
  is left alone to guard Mlle. Célie while the other two ransack Mme. Dauvray's
  room. She sees her chance. The girl cannot stir hand or foot to save herself.
  Vauquier tears the eardrops in a hurry from her ears &mdash; and there I have
  my drop of blood just where I should expect it to be. But now follow this!
  Vauquier hides the earrings in her pocket. She goes to bed in order to be
  chloroformed. She knows that it is very possible that her room will be
  searched before she regains consciousness, or before she is well enough to
  move. There is only one place to hide them in, only one place where they will
  be safe. In bed with her. But in the morning she must get rid of them, and a
  nurse is with her. Hence the excuse to go to Mlle. Célie's room. If the
  eardrops are found in the pot of cold cream, it would only be thought that
  Mlle. Célie had herself hidden them there for safety. Again it is conjecture,
  and I wish to make sure. So I tell Vauquier she can go away, and I leave her
  unwatched. I have her driven to the depot instead of to her friends, and
  searched. Upon her is found the pot of cream, and in the cream Mlle. Célie's
  eardrops. She has slipped into Mlle. Célie's room, as, if my theory was
  correct, she would be sure to do, and put the pot of cream into her pocket.
  So I am now fairly sure that she is concerned in the murder.</p>

  <p>"We then went to Mme. Dauvray's room and discovered her brilliants and her
  ornaments. At once the meaning of that agitated piece of hand-writing of
  Mlle. Célie's becomes clear. She is asked where the jewels are hidden. She
  cannot answer, for her mouth, of course, is stopped. She has to write. Thus
  my conjectures get more and more support. And, mind this, one of the two
  women is guilty &mdash; Célie or Vauquier. My discoveries all fit in with the
  theory of Célie's innocence. But there remain the footprints, for which I
  found no explanation.</p>

  <p>"You will remember I made you all promise silence as to the finding of
  Mme. Dauvray's jewellery. For I thought, if they have taken the girl away so
  that suspicion may fall on her and not on Vauquier, they mean to dispose of
  her. But they may keep her so long as they have a chance of finding out from
  her Mme. Dauvray's hiding-place. It was a small chance but our only one. The
  moment the discovery of the jewellery was published the girl's fate was
  sealed, were my theory true.</p>

  <p>"Then came our advertisement and Mme. Gobin's written testimony. There was
  one small point of interest which I will take first: her statement that Adele
  was the Christian name of the woman with the red hair, that the old woman who
  was the servant in that house in the suburb of Geneva called her Adele, just
  simply Adele. That interested me, for Helène Vauquier had called her Adele
  too when she was describing to us the unknown visitor. 'Adele' was what Mme.
  Dauvray called her."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ricardo. "Helène Vauquier made a slip there. She should have
  given her a false name."</p>

  <p>Hanaud nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is the one slip she made in the whole of the business. Nor did she
  recover herself very cleverly. For when the Commissaire pounced upon the
  name, she at once modified her words. She only thought now that the name was
  Adele, or something like it. But when I went on to suggest that the name in
  any case would be a false one, at once she went back upon her modifications.
  And now she was sure that Adele was the name used. I remembered her
  hesitation when I read Marthe Gobin's letter. They helped to confirm me in my
  theory that she was in the plot; and they made me very sure that it was an
  Adele for whom we had to look. So far well. But other statements in the
  letter puzzled me. For instance, 'She ran lightly and quickly across the
  pavement into the house, as though she were afraid to be seen.' Those were
  the words, and the woman was obviously honest. What became of my theory then?
  The girl was free to run, free to stoop and pick up the train of her gown in
  her hand, free to shout for help in the open street if she wanted help. No;
  that I could not explain until that afternoon, when I saw Mlle. Célie's
  terror-stricken eyes fixed upon that flask, as Lemerre poured a little out
  and burnt a hole in the sack. Then I understood well enough. The fear of
  vitriol!" Hanaud gave an uneasy shudder. "And it is enough to make any one
  afraid! That I can tell you. No wonder she lay still as a mouse upon the sofa
  in the bedroom. No wonder she ran quickly into the house. Well, there you
  have the explanation. I had only my theory to work upon even after Mme.
  Gobin's evidence. But as it happened it was the right one. Meanwhile, of
  course, I made my inquiries into Wethermill's circumstances. My good friends
  in England helped me. They were precarious. He owed money in Aix, money at
  his hotel. We knew from the motor-car that the man we were searching for had
  returned to Aix. Things began to look black for Wethermill. Then you gave me
  a little piece of information."</p>

  <p>"I!" exclaimed Ricardo, with a start.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You told me that you walked up to the hotel with Harry Wethermill on
  the night of the murder and separated just before ten. A glance into his
  rooms which I had &mdash; you will remember that when we had discovered the
  motor-car I suggested that we should go to Harry Wethermill's rooms and talk
  it over &mdash; that glance enabled me to see that he could very easily have
  got out of his room on to the verandah below and escaped from the hotel by
  the garden quite unseen. For you will remember that whereas your rooms look
  out to the front and on to the slope of Mont Revard, Wethermill's look out
  over the garden and the town of Aix. In a quarter of an hour or twenty
  minutes he could have reached the Villa Rose. He could have been in the salon
  before half-past ten, and that is just the hour which suited me perfectly.
  And, as he got out unnoticed, so he could return. So he did return! My
  friend, there are some interesting marks upon the window-sill of Wethermill's
  room and upon the pillar just beneath it. Take a look, M. Ricardo, when you
  return to your hotel. But that was not all. We talked of Geneva in Mr.
  Wethermill's room, and of the distance between Geneva and Aix. Do you
  remember that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Ricardo.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember too that I asked him for a road-book?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; to make sure of the distance. I do."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but it was not to make sure of the distance that I asked for the
  road-book, my friend. I asked in order to find out whether Harry Wethermill
  had a road-book at all which gave a plan of the roads between here and
  Geneva. And he had. He handed it to me at once and quite naturally. I hope
  that I took it calmly, but I was not at all calm inside. For it was a new
  road-book, which, by the way, he bought a week before, and I was asking
  myself all the while &mdash; now what was I asking myself, M. Ricardo?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Ricardo, with a smile. "I am growing wary. I will not tell you
  what you were asking yourself, M. Hanaud. For even were I right you would
  make out that I was wrong, and leap upon me with injuries and gibes. No, you
  shall drink your coffee and tell me of your own accord."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Hanaud, laughing, "I will tell you. I was asking myself: 'Why
  does a man who owns no motor-car, who hires no motor-car, go out into Aix and
  buy an automobilist's road-map? With what object?' And I found it an
  interesting question. M. Harry Wethermill was not the man to go upon a
  walking tour, eh? Oh, I was obtaining evidence. But then came an overwhelming
  thing &mdash; the murder of Marthe Gobin. We know now how he did it. He
  walked beside the cab, put his head in at the window, asked, 'Have you come
  in answer to the advertisement?' and stabbed her straight to the heart
  through her dress. The dress and the weapon which he used would save him from
  being stained with her blood. He was in your room that morning, when we were
  at the station. As I told you, he left his glove behind. He was searching for
  a telegram in answer to your advertisement. Or he came to sound you. He had
  already received his telegram from Hippolyte. He was like a fox in a cage,
  snapping at every one, twisting vainly this way and that way, risking
  everything and every one to save his precious neck. Marthe Gobin was in the
  way. She is killed. Mlle. Célie is a danger. So Mile. Célie must be
  suppressed. And off goes a telegram to the Geneva paper, handed in by a
  waiter from the cafe at the station of Chambery before five o'clock.
  Wethermill went to Chambery that afternoon when we went to Geneva. Once we
  could get him on the run, once we could so harry and bustle him that he must
  take risks &mdash; why, we had him. And that afternoon he had to take
  them."</p>

  <p>"So that even before Marthe Gobin was killed you were sure that Wethermill
  was the murderer?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud's face clouded over.</p>

  <p>"You put your finger on a sore place, M. Ricardo. I was sure, but I still
  wanted evidence to convict. I left him free, hoping for that evidence. I left
  him free, hoping that he would commit himself. He did, but &mdash; well, let
  us talk of some one else. What of Mlle. Célie?"</p>

  <p>Ricardo drew a letter from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I have a sister in London, a widow," he said. "She is kind. I, too, have
  been thinking of what will become of Mlle. Célie. I wrote to my sister, and
  here is her reply. Mlle. Célie will be very welcome."</p>

  <p>Hanaud stretched out his hand and shook Ricardo's warmly.</p>

  <p>"She will not, I think, be for very long a burden. She is young. She will
  recover from this shock. She is very pretty, very gentle. If &mdash; if no
  one comes forward whom she loves and who loves her &mdash; I &mdash; yes, I
  myself, who was her papa for one night, will be her husband forever."</p>

  <p>He laughed inordinately at his own joke; it was a habit of M. Hanaud's.
  Then he said gravely:</p>

  <p>"But I am glad, M. Ricardo, for Mlle. Célie's sake that I came to your
  amusing dinner-party in London."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ricardo was silent for a moment. Then he asked:</p>

  <p>"And what will happen to the condemned?"</p>

  <p>"To the women? Imprisonment for life."</p>

  <p>"And to the man?"</p>

  <p>Hanaud shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the guillotine. Perhaps New Caledonia. How can I say? I am not
  the President of the Republic."</p>
