<p>I am still uncertain which surprised me more, the telegram
calling my attention to the advertisement, or the advertisement
itself. The telegram is before me as I write. It would appear to
have been handed in at Vere Street at eight o'clock in the morning
of May 11, 1897, and received before half-past at Holloway B.O. And
in that drab region it duly found me, unwashed but at work before
the day grew hot and my attic insupportable.</p>

<p class="note">"See Mr. Maturin's advertisement Daily Mail might
suit you earnestly beg try will speak if necessary ----"</p>

<p>I transcribe the thing as I see it before me, all in one breath
that took away mine; but I leave out the initials at the end, which
completed the surprise. They stood very obviously for the knighted
specialist whose consulting-room is within a cab-whistle of Vere
Street, and who once called me kinsman for his sins. More recently
he had called me other names. I was a disgrace, qualified by an
adjective which seemed to me another. I had made my bed, and I
could go and lie and die in it. If I ever again had the insolence
to show my nose in that house, I should go out quicker than I came
in. All this, and more, my least distant relative could tell a poor
devil to his face; could ring for his man, and give him his brutal
instructions on the spot; and then relent to the tune of this
telegram! I have no phrase for my amazement. I literally could not
believe my eyes. Yet their evidence was more and more conclusive: a
very epistle could not have been more characteristic of its sender.
Meanly elliptical, ludicrously precise, saving half-pence at the
expense of sense, yet paying like a man for "Mr." Maturin, that was
my distinguished relative from his bald patch to his corns. Nor was
all the rest unlike him, upon second thoughts. He had a reputation
for charity; he was going to live up to it after all. Either that,
or it was the sudden impulse of which the most calculating are
capable at times; the morning papers with the early cup of tea,
this advertisement seen by chance, and the rest upon the spur of a
guilty conscience.</p>

<p>Well, I must see it for myself, and the sooner the better,
though work pressed. I was writing a series of articles upon prison
life, and had my nib into the whole System; a literary and
philanthropical daily was parading my "charges," the graver ones
with the more gusto; and the terms, if unhandsome for creative
work, were temporary wealth to me. It so happened that my first
check had just arrived by the eight o'clock post; and my position
should be appreciated when I say that I had to cash it to obtain a
<i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>

<p>Of the advertisement itself, what is to be said? It should speak
for itself if I could find it, but I cannot, and only remember that
it was a "male nurse and constant attendant" that was "wanted for
an elderly gentleman in feeble health". A male nurse! An absurd tag
was appended, offering "liberal salary to University or
public-school man"; and of a sudden I saw that I should get this
thing if I applied for it. What other "University or public-school
man" would dream of doing so? Was any other in such straits as I?
And then my relenting relative; he not only promised to speak for
me, but was the very man to do so. Could any recommendation compete
with his in the matter of a male nurse? And need the duties of such
be necessarily loathsome and repellent? Certainly the surroundings
would be better than those of my common lodging-house and own
particular garret; and the food; and every other condition of life
that I could think of on my way back to that unsavory asylum. So I
dived into a pawnbroker's shop, where I was a stranger only upon my
present errand, and within the hour was airing a decent if
antiquated suit, but little corrupted by the pawnbroker's moth, and
a new straw hat, on the top of a tram.</p>

<p>The address given in the advertisement was that of a flat at
Earl's Court, which cost me a cross-country journey, finishing with
the District Railway and a seven minutes' walk. It was now past
mid-day, and the tarry wood-pavement was good to smell as I strode
up the Earl's Court Road. It was great to walk the civilized world
again. Here were men with coats on their backs, and ladies in
gloves. My only fear was lest I might run up against one or other
whom I had known of old. But it was my lucky day. I felt it in my
bones. I was going to get this berth; and sometimes I should be
able to smell the wood-pavement on the old boy's errands; perhaps
he would insist on skimming over it in his bath-chair, with me
behind.</p>

<p>I felt quite nervous when I reached the flats. They were a small
pile in a side street, and I pitied the doctor whose plate I saw
upon the palings before the ground-floor windows; he must be in a
very small way, I thought. I rather pitied myself as well. I had
indulged in visions of better flats than these. There were no
balconies. The porter was out of livery. There was no lift, and my
invalid on the third floor! I trudged up, wishing I had never lived
in Mount Street, and brushed against a dejected individual coming
down. A full-blooded young fellow in a frock-coat flung the right
door open at my summons.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Maturin live here?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"That's right," said the full-blooded young man, grinning all
over a convivial countenance.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I've come about his advertisement in the Daily
Mail."</p>

<p>"You're the thirty-ninth," cried the blood; "that was the
thirty-eighth you met upon the stairs, and the day's still young.
Excuse my staring at you. Yes, you pass your prelim., and can come
inside; you're one of the few. We had most just after breakfast,
but now the porter's heading off the worst cases, and that last
chap was the first for twenty minutes. Come in here."</p>

<p>And I was ushered into an empty room with a good bay-window,
which enabled my full-blooded friend to inspect me yet more
critically in a good light; this he did without the least false
delicacy; then his questions began.</p>

<p>" 'Varsity man?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Public school?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>I told him, and he sighed relief.</p>

<p>"At last! You're the very first I've not had to argue with as to
what is and what is not a public school. Expelled?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, after a moment's hesitation; "no, I was not
expelled. And I hope you won't expel me if I ask a question in my
turn?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Maturin's son?"</p>

<p>"No, my name's Theobald. You may have seen it down below."</p>

<p>"The doctor?" I said.</p>

<p>"His doctor," said Theobald, with a satisfied eye. "Mr.
Maturin's doctor. He is having a male nurse and attendant by my
advice, and he wants a gentleman if he can get one. I rather think
he'll see you, though he's only seen two or three all day. There
are certain questions which he prefers to ask himself, and it's no
good going over the same ground twice. So perhaps I had better tell
him about you before we get any further."</p>

<p>And he withdrew to a room still nearer the entrance, as I could
hear, for it was a very small flat indeed. But now two doors were
shut between us, and I had to rest content with murmurs through the
wall until the doctor returned to summon me.</p>

<p>"I have persuaded my patient to see you," he whispered, "but I
confess I am not sanguine of the result. He is very difficult to
please. You must prepare yourself for a querulous invalid, and for
no sinecure if you get the billet."</p>

<p>"May I ask what's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"By all means&mdash;when you've got the billet."</p>

<p>Dr. Theobald then led the way, his professional dignity so
thoroughly intact that I could not but smile as I followed his
swinging coat-tails to the sick-room. I carried no smile across the
threshold of a darkened chamber which reeked of drugs and twinkled
with medicine bottles, and in the middle of which a gaunt figure
lay abed in the half-light.</p>

<p>"Take him to the window, take him to the window," a thin voice
snapped, "and let's have a look at him. Open the blind a bit. Not
as much as that, damn you, not as much as that!"</p>

<p>The doctor took the oath as though it had been a fee. I no
longer pitied him. It was now very clear to me that he had one
patient who was a little practice in himself. I determined there
and then that he should prove a little profession to me, if we
could but keep him alive between us. Mr. Maturin, however, had the
whitest face that I have ever seen, and his teeth gleamed out
through the dusk as though the withered lips no longer met about
them; nor did they except in speech; and anything ghastlier than
the perpetual grin of his repose I defy you to imagine. It was with
this grin that he lay regarding me while the doctor held the
blind.</p>

<p>"So you think you could look after me, do you?"</p>

<p>"I'm certain I could, sir."</p>

<p>"Single-handed, mind! I don't keep another soul. You would have
to cook your own grub and my slops. Do you think you could do all
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I think so."</p>

<p>"Why do you? Have you any experience of the kind?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, none."</p>

<p>"Then why do you pretend you have?"</p>

<p>"I only meant that I would do my best."</p>

<p>"Only meant, only meant! Have you done your best at everything
else, then?"</p>

<p>I hung my head. This was a facer. And there was something in my
invalid which thrust the unspoken lie down my throat.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have not," I told him plainly.</p>

<p>"He, he, he!" the old wretch tittered; "and you do well to own
it; you do well, sir, very well indeed. If you hadn't owned up, out
you would have gone, out neck-and-crop! You've saved your bacon.
You may do more. So you are a public-school boy, and a very good
school yours is, but you weren't at either University. Is that
correct?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"What did you do when you left school?"</p>

<p>"I came in for money."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I spent my money."</p>

<p>"And since then?"</p>

<p>I stood like a mule.</p>

<p>"And since then, I say!"</p>

<p>"A relative of mine will tell you if you ask him. He is an
eminent man, and he has promised to speak for me. I would rather
say no more myself."</p>

<p>"But you shall, sir, but you shall! Do you suppose that I
suppose a public-school boy would apply for a berth like this if
something or other hadn't happened? What I want is a gentleman of
sorts, and I don't much care what sort; but you've got to tell me
what did happen, if you don't tell anybody else. Dr. Theobald, sir,
you can go to the devil if you won't take a hint. This man may do
or he may not. You have no more to say to it till I send him down
to tell you one thing or the other. Clear out, sir, clear out; and
if you think you've anything to complain of, you stick it down in
the bill!"</p>

<p>In the mild excitement of our interview the thin voice had
gathered strength, and the last shrill insult was screamed after
the devoted medico, as he retired in such order that I felt certain
he was going to take this trying patient at his word. The bedroom
door closed, then the outer one, and the doctor's heels went
drumming down the common stair. I was alone in the flat with this
highly singular and rather terrible old man.</p>

<p>"And a damned good riddance!" croaked the invalid, raising
himself on one elbow without delay. "I may not have much body left
to boast about, but at least I've got a lost old soul to call my
own. That's why I want a gentleman of sorts about me. I've been too
dependent on that chap. He won't even let me smoke, and he's been
in the flat all day to see I didn't. You'll find the cigarettes
behind the Madonna of the Chair."</p>

<p>It was a steel engraving of the great Raffaelle, and the frame
was tilted from the wall; at a touch a packet of cigarettes tumbled
down from behind.</p>

<p>"Thanks; and now a light."</p>

<p>I struck the match and held it, while the invalid inhaled with
normal lips; and suddenly I sighed. I was irresistibly reminded of
my poor dear old Raffles. A smoke-ring worthy of the great A. J.
was floating upward from the sick man's lips.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page012.jpg" alt=""
width="519" height="750">
</p>

<p>"And now take one yourself. I have smoked more poisonous
cigarettes. But even these are not Sullivans!"</p>

<p>I cannot repeat what I said. I have no idea what I did. I only
know&mdash;I only knew&mdash;that it was A. J. Raffles in the
flesh!</p>

<p align="center"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>"Yes, Bunny, it was the very devil of a swim; but I defy you to
sink in the Mediterranean. That sunset saved me. The sea was on
fire. I hardly swam under water at all, but went all I knew for the
sun itself; when it set I must have been a mile away; until it did
I was the invisible man. I figured on that, and only hope it wasn't
set down as a case of suicide. I shall get outed quite soon enough,
Bunny, but I'd rather be dropped by the hangman than throw my own
wicket away."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear old chap, to think of having you by the hand again!
I feel as though we were both aboard that German liner, and all
that's happened since a nightmare. I thought that time was the
last!"</p>

<p>"It looked rather like it, Bunny. It was taking all the risks,
and hitting at everything. But the game came off, and some day I'll
tell you how."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm in no hurry to hear. It's enough for me to see you
lying there. I don't want to know how you came there, or why,
though I fear you must be pretty bad. I must have a good look at
you before I let you speak another word!"</p>

<p>I raised one of the blinds, I sat upon the bed, and I had that
look. It left me all unable to conjecture his true state of health,
but quite certain in my own mind that my dear Raffles was not and
never would be the man that he had been. He had aged twenty years;
he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no
trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about
the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep. On the
other hand, the eyes themselves were alight and alert as ever; they
were still keen and gray and gleaming, like finely tempered steel.
Even the mouth, with a cigarette to close it, was the mouth of
Raffles and no other: strong and unscrupulous as the man himself.
It was only the physical strength which appeared to have departed;
but that was quite sufficient to make my heart bleed for the dear
rascal who had cost me every tie I valued but the tie between us
two.</p>

<p>"Think I look much older?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"A bit," I admitted. "But it is chiefly your hair."</p>

<p>"Whereby hangs a tale for when we've talked ourselves out,
though I have often thought it was that long swim that started it.
Still, the Island of Elba is a rummy show, I can assure you. And
Naples is a rummier!"</p>

<p>"You went there after all?"</p>

<p>"Rather! It's the European paradise for such as our noble
selves. But there's no place that's a patch on little London as a
non-conductor of heat; it never need get too hot for a fellow here;
if it does it's his own fault. It's the kind of wicket you don't
get out on, unless you get yourself out. So here I am again, and
have been for the last six weeks. And I mean to have another
knock."</p>

<p>"But surely, old fellow, you're not awfully fit, are you?"</p>

<p>"Fit? My dear Bunny, I'm dead&mdash;I'm at the bottom of the
sea&mdash;and don't you forget it for a minute."</p>

<p>"But are you all right, or are you not?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm half-poisoned by Theobald's prescriptions and putrid
cigarettes, and as weak as a cat from lying in bed."</p>

<p>"Then why on earth lie in bed, Raffles?"</p>

<p>"Because it's better than lying in gaol, as I am afraid
<i>you</i> know, my poor dear fellow. I tell you I am dead; and my
one terror is of coming to life again by accident. Can't you see? I
simply dare not show my nose out of doors&mdash;by day. You have no
idea of the number of perfectly innocent things a dead man daren't
do. I can't even smoke Sullivans, because no one man was ever so
partial to them as I was in my lifetime, and you never know when
you may start a clew."</p>

<p>"What brought you to these mansions?"</p>

<p>"I fancied a flat, and a man recommended these on the boat; such
a good chap, Bunny; he was my reference when it came to signing the
lease. You see I landed on a stretcher&mdash;most pathetic
case&mdash;old Australian without a friend in old
country&mdash;ordered Engadine as last chance&mdash;no go&mdash;not
an earthly&mdash;sentimental wish to die in London&mdash;that's the
history of Mr. Maturin. If it doesn't hit you hard, Bunny, you're
the first. But it hit friend Theobald hardest of all. I'm an income
to him. I believe he's going to marry on me."</p>

<p>"Does he guess there's nothing wrong?"</p>

<p>"Knows, bless you! But he doesn't know I know he knows, and
there isn't a disease in the dictionary that he hasn't treated me
for since he's had me in hand. To do him justice, I believe he
thinks me a hypochondriac of the first water; but that young man
will go far if he keeps on the wicket. He has spent half his nights
up here, at guineas apiece."</p>

<p>"Guineas must be plentiful, old chap!"</p>

<p>"They have been, Bunny. I can't say more. But I don't see why
they shouldn't be again."</p>

<p>I was not going to inquire where the guineas came from. As if I
cared! But I did ask old Raffles how in the world he had got upon
my tracks; and thereby drew the sort of smile with which old
gentlemen rub their hands, and old ladies nod their noses. Raffles
merely produced a perfect oval of blue smoke before replying.</p>

<p>"I was waiting for you to ask that, Bunny; it's a long time
since I did anything upon which I plume myself more. Of course, in
the first place, I spotted you at once by these prison articles;
they were not signed, but the fist was the fist of my sitting
rabbit!"</p>

<p>"But who gave you my address?"</p>

<p>"I wheedled it out of your excellent editor; called on him at
dead of night, when I occasionally go afield like other ghosts, and
wept it out of him in five minutes. I was your only relative; your
name was not your own name; if he insisted I would give him mine.
He didn't insist, Bunny, and I danced down his stairs with your
address in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Last night?"</p>

<p>"No, last week."</p>

<p>"And so the advertisement was yours, as well as the
telegram!"</p>

<p>I had, of course, forgotten both in the high excitement of the
hour, or I should scarcely have announced my belated discovery with
such an air. As it was I made Raffles look at me as I had known him
look before, and the droop of his eyelids began to sting.</p>

<p>"Why all this subtlety?" I petulantly exclaimed. "Why couldn't
you come straight away to me in a cab?"</p>

<p>He did not inform me that I was hopeless as ever. He did not
address me as his good rabbit.</p>

<p>He was silent for a time, and then spoke in a tone which made me
ashamed of mine.</p>

<p>"You see, there are two or three of me now, Bunny: one's at the
bottom of the Mediterranean, and one's an old Australian desirous
of dying in the old country, but in no immediate danger of dying
anywhere. The old Australian doesn't know a soul in town; he's got
to be consistent, or he's done. This sitter Theobald is his only
friend, and has seen rather too much of him; ordinary dust won't do
for his eyes. Begin to see? To pick you out of a crowd, that was
the game; to let old Theobald help to pick you, better still! To
start with, he was dead against my having anybody at all; wanted me
all to himself, naturally; but anything rather than kill the goose!
So he is to have a fiver a week while he keeps me alive, and he's
going to be married next month. That's a pity in some ways, but a
good thing in others; he will want more money than he foresees, and
he may always be of use to us at a pinch. Meanwhile he eats out of
my hand."</p>

<p>I complimented Raffles on the mere composition of his telegram,
with half the characteristics of my distinguished kinsman squeezed
into a dozen odd words; and let him know how the old ruffian had
really treated me. Raffles was not surprised; we had dined together
at my relative's in the old days, and filed for reference a
professional valuation of his household goods. I now learnt that
the telegram had been posted, with the hour marked for its
despatch, at the pillar nearest Vere Street, on the night before
the advertisement was due to appear in the Daily Mail. This also
had been carefully prearranged; and Raffles's only fear had been
lest it might be held over despite his explicit instructions, and
so drive me to the doctor for an explanation of his telegram. But
the adverse chances had been weeded out and weeded out to the
irreducible minimum of risk.</p>

<p>His greatest risk, according to Raffles, lay nearest home:
bedridden invalid that he was supposed to be, his nightly terror
was of running into Theobald's arms in the immediate neighborhood
of the flat. But Raffles had characteristic methods of minimizing
even that danger, of which something anon; meanwhile he recounted
more than one of his nocturnal adventures, all, however, of a
singularly innocent type; and one thing I noticed while he talked.
His room was the first as you entered the flat. The long inner wall
divided the room not merely from the passage but from the outer
landing as well. Thus every step upon the bare stone stairs could
be heard by Raffles where he lay; and he would never speak while
one was ascending, until it had passed his door. The afternoon
brought more than one applicant for the post which it was my duty
to tell them that I had already obtained. Between three and four,
however, Raffles, suddenly looking at his watch, packed me off in a
hurry to the other end of London for my things.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you must be famishing, Bunny. It's a fact that I eat
very little, and that at odd hours, but I ought not to have
forgotten you. Get yourself a snack outside, but not a square meal
if you can resist one. We've got to celebrate this day this
night!"</p>

<p>"To-night?" I cried.</p>

<p>"To-night at eleven, and Kellner's the place. You may well open
your eyes, but we didn't go there much, if you remember, and the
staff seems changed. Anyway we'll risk it for once. I was in last
night, talking like a stage American, and supper's ordered for
eleven sharp."</p>

<p>"You made as sure of me as all that!"</p>

<p>"There was no harm in ordering supper. We shall have it in a
private room, but you may as well dress if you've got the
duds."</p>

<p>"They're at my only forgiving relative's."</p>

<p>"How much will get them out, and square you up, and bring you
back bag and baggage in good time?"</p>

<p>I had to calculate.</p>

<p>"A tenner, easily."</p>

<p>"I had one ready for you. Here it is, and I wouldn't lose any
time if I were you. On the way you might look up Theobald, tell him
you've got it and how long you'll be gone, and that I can't be left
alone all the time. And, by Jove, yes! You get me a stall for the
Lyceum at the nearest agent's; there are two or three in High
Street; and say it was given you when you come in. That young man
shall be out of the way to-night."</p>

<p>I found our doctor in a minute consulting-room and his
shirt-sleeves, a tall tumbler at his elbow; at least I caught sight
of the tumbler on entering; thereafter he stood in front of it,
with a futility which had my sympathy.</p>

<p>"So you've got the billet," said Dr. Theobald. "Well, as I told
you before, and as you have since probably discovered for yourself,
you won't find it exactly a sinecure. My own part of the business
is by no means that; indeed, there are those who would throw up the
case, after the kind of treatment that you have seen for yourself.
But professional considerations are not the only ones, and one
cannot make too many allowances in such a case."</p>

<p>"But what is the case?" I asked him. "You said you would tell me
if I was successful."</p>

<p>Dr. Theobald's shrug was worthy of the profession he seemed
destined to adorn; it was not incompatible with any construction
which one chose to put upon it. Next moment he had stiffened. I
suppose I still spoke more or less like a gentleman. Yet, after
all, I was only the male nurse. He seemed to remember this
suddenly, and he took occasion to remind me of the fact.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, "that was before I knew you were altogether
without experience; and I must say that I was surprised even at Mr.
Maturin's engaging you after that; but it will depend upon yourself
how long I allow him to persist in so curious an experiment. As for
what is the matter with him, my good fellow, it is no use my giving
you an answer which would be double Dutch to you; moreover, I have
still to test your discretionary powers. I may say, however, that
that poor gentleman presents at once the most complex and most
troublesome case, which is responsibility enough without certain
features which make it all but insupportable. Beyond this I must
refuse to discuss my patient for the present; but I shall certainly
go up if I can find time."</p>

<p>He went up within five minutes. I found him there on my return
at dusk. But he did not refuse my stall for the Lyceum, which
Raffles would not allow me to use myself, and presented to him
off-hand without my leave.</p>

<p>"And don't you bother any more about me till to-morrow," snapped
the high thin voice as he was off. "I can send for you now when I
want you, and I'm hoping to have a decent night for once."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>It was half-past ten when we left the flat, in an interval of
silence on the noisy stairs. The silence was unbroken by our wary
feet. Yet for me a surprise was in store upon the very landing.
Instead of going downstairs, Raffles led me up two flights, and so
out upon a perfectly flat roof.</p>

<p>"There are two entrances to these mansions," he explained
between stars and chimney-stacks: "one to our staircase, and
another round the corner. But there's only one porter, and he lives
in the basement underneath us, and affects the door nearest home.
We miss him by using the wrong stairs, and we run less risk of old
Theobald. I got the tip from the postmen, who come up one way and
down the other. Now, follow me, and look out!"</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page028.jpg" alt=""
width="537" height="750">
</p>

<p>There was indeed some necessity for caution, for each half of
the building had its L-shaped well dropping sheer to the base, the
parapets so low that one might easily have tripped over them into
eternity. However, we were soon upon the second staircase, which
opened on the roof like the first. And twenty minutes of the next
twenty-five we spent in an admirable hansom, skimming east.</p>

<p>"Not much change in the old hole, Bunny. More of these
magic-lantern advertisements ... and absolutely the worst bit of
taste in town, though it's saying something, in that equestrian
statue with the gilt stirrups and fixings; why don't they black the
buffer's boots and his horse's hoofs while they are about it? ...
More bicyclists, of course. That was just beginning, if you
remember. It might have been useful to us.... And there's the old
club, getting put into a crate for the Jubilee; by Jove, Bunny, we
ought to be there. I wouldn't lean forward in Piccadilly, old chap.
If you're seen I'm thought of, and we shall have to be jolly
careful at Kellner's.... Ah, there it is! Did I tell you I was a
low-down stage Yankee at Kellner's? You'd better be another, while
the waiter's in the room."</p>

<p>We had the little room upstairs; and on the very threshold I,
even I, who knew my Raffles of old, was taken horribly aback. The
table was laid for three. I called his attention to it in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Why, yep!" came through his nose. "Say, boy, the lady, she's
not comin', but you leave that tackle where 'tis. If I'm liable to
pay, I guess I'll have all there is to it."</p>

<p>I have never been in America, and the American public is the
last on earth that I desire to insult; but idiom and intonation
alike would have imposed upon my inexperience. I had to look at
Raffles to make sure that it was he who spoke, and I had my own
reasons for looking hard.</p>

<p>"Who on earth was the lady?" I inquired aghast at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>"She isn't on earth. They don't like wasting this room on two,
that's all. Bunny&mdash;my Bunny&mdash;here's to us both!"</p>

<p>And we clinked glasses swimming with the liquid gold of
Steinberg, 1868; but of the rare delights of that supper I can
scarcely trust myself to write. It was no mere meal, it was no
coarse orgy, but a little feast for the fastidious gods, not
unworthy of Lucullus at his worst. And I who had bolted my skilly
at Wormwood Scrubbs, and tightened my belt in a Holloway attic, it
was I who sat down to this ineffable repast! Where the courses were
few, but each a triumph of its kind, it would be invidious to
single out any one dish; but the Jambon de Westphalie au Champagne
tempts me sorely. And then the champagne that we drank, not the
quantity but the quality! Well, it was Pol Roger, '84, and quite
good enough for me; but even so it was not more dry, nor did it
sparkle more, than the merry rascal who had dragged me thus far to
the devil, but should lead me dancing the rest of the way. I was
beginning to tell him so. I had done my honest best since my
reappearance in the world; but the world had done its worst by me.
A further antithesis and my final intention were both upon my
tongue when the waiter with the Chateau Margaux cut me short; for
he was the bearer of more than that great wine; bringing also a
card upon a silver tray.</p>

<p>"Show him up," said Raffles, laconically.</p>

<p>"And who is this?" I cried when the man was gone. Raffles
reached across the table and gripped my arm in a vice. His eyes
were steel points fixed on mine.</p>

<p>"Bunny, stand by me," said he in the old irresistible voice, a
voice both stern and winning. "Stand by me, Bunny&mdash;if there's
a row!"</p>

<p>And there was time for nothing more, the door flying open, and a
dapper person entering with a bow; a frock-coat on his back, gold
pince-nez on his nose; a shiny hat in one hand, and a black bag in
the other.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, gentlemen," said he, at home and smiling.</p>

<p>"Sit down," drawled Raffles in casual response. "Say, let me
introduce you to Mr. Ezra B. Martin, of Shicawgo. Mr. Martin is my
future brother-in-law. This is Mr. Robinson, Ezra, manager to
Sparks &amp; Company, the cellerbrated joolers on Re-gent
Street."</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears, but contented myself with a nod. I
altogether distrusted my ability to live up to my new name and
address.</p>

<p>"I figured on Miss Martin bein' right here, too," continued
Raffles, "but I regret to say she's not feelin' so good. We light
out for Parrus on the 9 A. M. train to-morrer mornin', and she
guessed she'd be too dead. Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Robinson;
but you'll see I'm advertisin' your wares."</p>

<p>Raffles held his right hand under the electric light, and a
diamond ring flashed upon his little finger. I could have sworn it
was not there five minutes before.</p>

<p>The tradesman had a disappointed face, but for a moment it
brightened as he expatiated on the value of that ring and on the
price his people had accepted for it. I was invited to guess the
figure, but I shook a discreet head. I have seldom been more
taciturn in my life.</p>

<p>"Forty-five pounds," cried the jeweller; "and it would be cheap
at fifty guineas."</p>

<p>"That's right," assented Raffles. "That'd be dead cheap, I
allow. But then, my boy, you gotten ready cash, and don't you
forget it."</p>

<p>I do not dwell upon my own mystification in all this. I merely
pause to state that I was keenly enjoying that very element.
Nothing could have been more typical of Raffles and the past. It
was only my own attitude that was changed.</p>

<p>It appeared that the mythical lady, my sister, had just become
engaged to Raffles, who seemed all anxiety to pin her down with
gifts of price. I could not quite gather whose gift to whom was the
diamond ring; but it had evidently been paid for; and I voyaged to
the moon, wondering when and how. I was recalled to this planet by
a deluge of gems from the jeweller's bag. They lay alight in their
cases like the electric lamps above. We all three put our heads
together over them, myself without the slightest clew as to what
was coming, but not unprepared for violent crime. One does not do
eighteen months for nothing.</p>

<p>"Right away," Raffles was saying. "We'll choose for her, and
you'll change anything she don't like. Is that the idea?"</p>

<p>"That was my suggestion, sir."</p>

<p>"Then come on, Ezra. I guess you know Sadie's taste. You help me
choose."</p>

<p>And we chose&mdash;lord! What did we not choose? There was her
ring, a diamond half-hoop. It cost L95, and there was no attempt to
get it for L90. Then there was a diamond necklet&mdash;two hundred
guineas, but pounds accepted. That was to be the gift of the
bridegroom. The wedding was evidently imminent. It behooved me to
play a brotherly part. I therefore rose to the occasion; calculated
she would like a diamond star (L116), but reckoned it was more than
I could afford; and sustained a vicious kick under the table for
either verb. I was afraid to open my mouth on finally obtaining the
star for the round hundred. And then the fat fell in the fire; for
pay we could not; though a remittance (said Raffles) was "overdo
from Noo York."</p>

<p>"But I don't know you, gentlemen," the jeweller exclaimed. "I
haven't even the name of your hotel!"</p>

<p>"I told you we was stoppin' with friends," said Raffles, who was
not angry, though thwarted and crushed. "But that's right, sir! Oh,
that's dead right, and I'm the last man to ask you to take Quixotic
risks. I'm tryin' to figure a way out. Yes, <i>sir</i>, that's what
I'm tryin' to do."</p>

<p>"I wish you could, sir," the jeweller said, with feeling. "It
isn't as if we hadn't seen the color of your money. But certain
rules I'm sworn to observe; it isn't as if I was in business for
myself; and&mdash;you say you start for Paris in the morning!"</p>

<p>"On the 9 A. M. train," mused Raffles; "and I've heard no-end
yarns about the joolers' stores in Parrus. But that ain't fair;
don't you take no notice o' that. I'm tryin' to figure a way out.
Yes, <i>sir</i>!"</p>

<p>He was smoking cigarettes out of a twenty-five box; the
tradesman and I had cigars. Raffles sat frowning with a pregnant
eye, and it was only too clear to me that his plans had miscarried.
I could not help thinking, however, that they deserved to do so, if
he had counted upon buying credit for all but L400 by a single
payment of some ten per cent. That again seemed unworthy of
Raffles, and I, for my part, still sat prepared to spring any
moment at our visitor's throat.</p>

<p>"We could mail you the money from Parrus," drawled Raffles at
length. "But how should we know you'd hold up your end of the
string, and mail us the same articles we've selected to-night?"</p>

<p>The visitor stiffened in his chair. The name of his firm should
be sufficient guarantee for that.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm no better acquainted with their name than they are
with mine," remarked Raffles, laughing. "See here, though! I got a
scheme. You pack 'em in this!"</p>

<p>He turned the cigarettes out of the tin box, while the jeweller
and I joined wondering eyes.</p>

<p>"Pack 'em in this," repeated Raffles, "the three things we want,
and never mind the boxes; you can pack 'em in cotton-wool. Then
we'll ring for string and sealing wax, seal up the lot right here,
and you can take 'em away in your grip. Within three days we'll
have our remittance, and mail you the money, and you'll mail us
this darned box with my seal unbroken! It's no use you lookin' so
sick, Mr. Jooler; you won't trust us any, and yet we're goin' to
trust you some. Ring the bell, Ezra, and we'll see if they've
gotten any sealing-wax and string."</p>

<p>They had; and the thing was done. The tradesman did not like it;
the precaution was absolutely unnecessary; but since he was taking
all his goods away with him, the sold with the unsold, his
sentimental objections soon fell to the ground. He packed necklet,
ring, and star, with his own hands, in cotton-wool; and the
cigarette-box held them so easily that at the last moment, when the
box was closed, and the string ready, Raffles very nearly added a
diamond bee-brooch at L51 10s. This temptation, however, he
ultimately overcame, to the other's chagrin. The cigarette-box was
tied up, and the string sealed, oddly enough, with the diamond of
the ring that had been bought and paid for.</p>

<p>"I'll chance you having another ring in the store the dead spit
of mine," laughed Raffles, as he relinquished the box, and it
disappeared into the tradesman's bag. "And now, Mr. Robinson, I
hope you'll appreciate my true hospitality in not offering you any
thing to drink while business was in progress. That's Chateau
Margaux, sir, and I should judge it's what you'd call an
eighteen-carat article."</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>In the cab which we took to the vicinity of the flat, I was
instantly snubbed for asking questions which the driver might
easily overhear, and took the repulse just a little to heart. I
could make neither head nor tail of Raffles's dealings with the man
from Regent Street, and was naturally inquisitive as to the meaning
of it all. But I held my tongue until we had regained the flat in
the cautious manner of our exit, and even there until Raffles
rallied me with a hand on either shoulder and an old smile upon his
face.</p>

<p>"You rabbit!" said he. "Why couldn't you wait till we got
home?"</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you tell me what you were going to do?" I retorted
as of yore.</p>

<p>"Because your dear old phiz is still worth its weight in
innocence, and because you never could act for nuts! You looked as
puzzled as the other poor devil; but you wouldn't if you had known
what my game really was."</p>

<p>"And pray what was it?"</p>

<p>"That," said Raffles, and he smacked the cigarette-box down upon
the mantelpiece. It was not tied. It was not sealed. It flew open
from the force of the impact. And the diamond ring that cost L95,
the necklet for L200, and my flaming star at another L100, all
three lay safe and snug in the jeweller's own cotton-wool!</p>

<p>"Duplicate boxes!" I cried.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page038.jpg" alt=""
width="554" height="750">
</p>

<p>"Duplicate boxes, my brainy Bunny. One was already packed and
weighted, and in my pocket. I don't know whether you noticed me
weighing the three things together in my hand? I know that neither
of you saw me change the boxes, for I did it when I was nearest
buying the bee-brooch at the end, and you were too puzzled, and the
other Johnny too keen. It was the cheapest shot in the game; the
dear ones were sending old Theobald to Southampton on a fool's
errand yesterday afternoon, and showing one's own nose down Regent
Street in broad daylight while he was gone; but some things are
worth paying for, and certain risks one must always take. Nice
boxes, aren't they? I only wished they contained a better
cigarette; but a notorious brand was essential; a box of Sullivans
would have brought me to life to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But they oughtn't to open it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Nor will they, as a matter of fact. Meanwhile, Bunny, I may
call upon you to dispose of the boodle."</p>

<p>"I'm on for any mortal thing!"</p>

<p>My voice rang true, I swear, but it was the way of Raffles to
take the evidence of as many senses as possible. I felt the cold
steel of his eyes through mine and through my brain. But what he
saw seemed to satisfy him no less than what he heard, for his hand
found my hand, and pressed it with a fervor foreign to the man.</p>

<p>"I know you are, and I knew you would be. Only remember, Bunny,
it's my turn next to pay the shot!"</p>

<p>You shall hear how he paid it when the time came.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AJubileePresent" id=
"AJubileePresent"></a>A Jubilee Present</b>
</h2>

<p>The Room of Gold, in the British Museum, is probably well enough
known to the inquiring alien and the travelled American. A true
Londoner, however, I myself had never heard of it until Raffles
casually proposed a raid.</p>

<p>"The older I grow, Bunny, the less I think of your so-called
precious stones. When did they ever bring in half their market
value in L.s.d. There was the first little crib we ever cracked
together&mdash;you with your innocent eyes shut. A thousand pounds
that stuff was worth; but how many hundreds did it actually fetch.
The Ardagh emeralds weren't much better; old Lady Melrose's
necklace was far worse; but that little lot the other night has
about finished me. A cool hundred for goods priced well over four;
and L35 to come off for bait, since we only got a tenner for the
ring I bought and paid for like an ass. I'll be shot if I ever
touch a diamond again! Not if it was the Koh-I-noor; those few
whacking stones are too well known, and to cut them up is to
decrease their value by arithmetical retrogression. Besides, that
brings you up against the Fence once more, and I'm done with the
beggars for good and all. You talk about your editors and
publishers, you literary swine. Barabbas was neither a robber nor a
publisher, but a six-barred, barbed-wired, spike-topped Fence. What
we really want is an Incorporated Society of Thieves, with some
public-spirited old forger to run it for us on business lines."</p>

<p>Raffles uttered these blasphemies under his breath, not, I am
afraid, out of any respect for my one redeeming profession, but
because we were taking a midnight airing on the roof, after a whole
day of June in the little flat below. The stars shone overhead, the
lights of London underneath, and between the lips of Raffles a
cigarette of the old and only brand. I had sent in secret for a box
of the best; the boon had arrived that night; and the foregoing
speech was the first result. I could afford to ignore the insolent
asides, however, where the apparent contention was so manifestly
unsound.</p>

<p>"And how are you going to get rid of your gold?" said I,
pertinently.</p>

<p>"Nothing easier, my dear rabbit."</p>

<p>"Is your Room of Gold a roomful of sovereigns?"</p>

<p>Raffles laughed softly at my scorn.</p>

<p>"No, Bunny, it's principally in the shape of archaic ornaments,
whose value, I admit, is largely extrinsic. But gold is gold, from
Phoenicia to Klondike, and if we cleared the room we should
eventually do very well."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I should melt it down into a nugget, and bring it home from the
U.S.A. to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Make them pay up in hard cash across the counter of the Bank of
England. And you <i>can</i> make them."</p>

<p>That I knew, and so said nothing for a time, remaining a hostile
though a silent critic, while we paced the cool black leads with
our bare feet, softly as cats.</p>

<p>"And how do you propose to get enough away," at length I asked,
"to make it worth while?"</p>

<p>"Ah, there you have it," said Raffles. "I only propose to
reconnoitre the ground, to see what we can see. We might find some
hiding-place for a night; that, I am afraid, would be our only
chance."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been there before?"</p>

<p>"Not since they got the one good, portable piece which I believe
that they exhibit now. It's a long time since I read of it&mdash;I
can't remember where&mdash;but I know they have got a gold cup of
sorts worth several thousands. A number of the immorally rich
clubbed together and presented it to the nation; and two of the
richly immoral intend to snaffle it for themselves. At any rate we
might go and have a look at it, Bunny, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Think! I seized his arm.</p>

<p>"When? When? When?" I asked, like a quick-firing gun.</p>

<p>"The sooner the better, while old Theobald's away on his
honeymoon."</p>

<p>Our medico had married the week before, nor was any
fellow-practitioner taking his work&mdash;at least not that
considerable branch of it which consisted of Raffles&mdash;during
his brief absence from town. There were reasons, delightfully
obvious to us, why such a plan would have been highly unwise in Dr.
Theobald. I, however, was sending him daily screeds, and both
matutinal and nocturnal telegrams, the composition of which
afforded Raffles not a little enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Well, then, when&mdash;when?" I began to repeat.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if you like."</p>

<p>"Only to look?"</p>

<p>The limitation was my one regret.</p>

<p>"We must do so, Bunny, before we leap."</p>

<p>"Very well," I sighed. "But to-morrow it is!"</p>

<p>And the morrow it really was.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>I saw the porter that night, and, I still think, bought his
absolute allegiance for the second coin of the realm. My story,
however, invented by Raffles, was sufficiently specious in itself.
That sick gentleman, Mr. Maturin (as I had to remember to call
him), was really, or apparently, sickening for fresh air. Dr.
Theobald would allow him none; he was pestering me for just one day
in the country while the glorious weather lasted. I was myself
convinced that no possible harm could come of the experiment. Would
the porter help me in so innocent and meritorious an intrigue? The
man hesitated. I produced my half-sovereign. The man was lost. And
at half-past eight next morning&mdash;before the heat of the
day&mdash;Raffles and I drove to Kew Gardens in a hired landau
which was to call for us at mid-day and wait until we came. The
porter had assisted me to carry my invalid downstairs, in a
carrying-chair hired (like the landau) from Harrod's Stores for the
occasion.</p>

<p>It was little after nine when we crawled together into the
gardens; by half-past my invalid had had enough, and out he
tottered on my arm; a cab, a message to our coachman, a timely
train to Baker Street, another cab, and we were at the British
Museum&mdash;brisk pedestrians now&mdash;not very many minutes
after the opening hour of 10 A.M.</p>

<p>It was one of those glowing days which will not be forgotten by
many who were in town at the time. The Diamond Jubilee was upon us,
and Queen's weather had already set in. Raffles, indeed, declared
it was as hot as Italy and Australia put together; and certainly
the short summer nights gave the channels of wood and asphalt and
the continents of brick and mortar but little time to cool. At the
British Museum the pigeons were crooning among the shadows of the
grimy colonnade, and the stalwart janitors looked less stalwart
than usual, as though their medals were too heavy for them. I
recognized some habitual Readers going to their labor underneath
the dome; of mere visitors we seemed among the first.</p>

<p>"That's the room," said Raffles, who had bought the two-penny
guide, as we studied it openly on the nearest bench; "number 43,
upstairs and sharp round to the right. Come on, Bunny!"</p>

<p>And he led the way in silence, but with a long methodical stride
which I could not understand until we came to the corridor leading
to the Room of Gold, when he turned to me for a moment.</p>

<p>"A hundred and thirty-nine yards from this to the open street,"
said Raffles, "not counting the stairs. I suppose we <i>could</i>
do it in twenty seconds, but if we did we should have to jump the
gates. No, you must remember to loaf out at slow march, Bunny,
whether you like it or not."</p>

<p>"But you talked about a hiding-place for a night?"</p>

<p>"Quite so&mdash;for all night. We should have to get back, go on
lying low, and saunter out with the crowd next day&mdash;after
doing the whole show thoroughly."</p>

<p>"What! With gold in our pockets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And gold in our boots, and gold up the sleeves and legs of our
suits! You leave that to me, Bunny, and wait till you've tried two
pairs of trousers sewn together at the foot! This is only a
preliminary reconnoitre. And here we are."</p>

<p>It is none of my business to describe the so-called Room of
Gold, with which I, for one, was not a little disappointed. The
glass cases, which both fill and line it, may contain unique
examples of the goldsmith's art in times and places of which one
heard quite enough in the course of one's classical education; but,
from a professional point of view, I would as lief have the
ransacking of a single window in the West End as the pick of all
those spoils of Etruria and of ancient Greece. The gold may not be
so soft as it appears, but it certainly looks as though you could
bite off the business ends of the spoons, and stop your own teeth
in doing so. Nor should I care to be seen wearing one of the rings;
but the greatest fraud of all (from the aforesaid standpoint) is
assuredly that very cup of which Raffles had spoken. Moreover, he
felt this himself.</p>

<p>"Why, it's as thin as paper," said he, "and enamelled like a
middle-aged lady of quality! But, by Jove, it's one of the most
beautiful things I ever saw in my life, Bunny. I should like to
have it for its own sake, by all my gods!"</p>

<p>The thing had a little square case of plate-glass all to itself
at one end of the room. It may have been the thing of beauty that
Raffles affected to consider it, but I for my part was in no mood
to look at it in that light. Underneath were the names of the
plutocrats who had subscribed for this national gewgaw, and I fell
to wondering where their L8,000 came in, while Raffles devoured his
two-penny guide-book as greedily as a school-girl with a zeal for
culture.</p>

<p>"Those are scenes from the martyrdom of St. Agnes," said he ...
" 'translucent on relief ... one of the finest specimens of its
kind.' I should think it was! Bunny, you Philistine, why can't you
admire the thing for its own sake? It would be worth having only to
live up to! There never was such rich enamelling on such thin gold;
and what a good scheme to hang the lid up over it, so that you can
see how thin it is. I wonder if we could lift it, Bunny, by hook or
crook?"</p>

<p>"You'd better try, sir," said a dry voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>The madman seemed to think we had the room to ourselves. I knew
better, but, like another madman, had let him ramble on unchecked.
And here was a stolid constable confronting us, in the short tunic
that they wear in summer, his whistle on its chain, but no
truncheon at his side. Heavens! how I see him now: a man of medium
size, with a broad, good-humored, perspiring face, and a limp
moustache. He looked sternly at Raffles, and Raffles looked merrily
at him.</p>

<p>"Going to run me in, officer?" said he. "That <i>would</i> be a
joke&mdash;my hat!"</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page052.jpg" alt=""
width="568" height="750">
</p>

<p>"I didn't say as I was, sir," replied the policeman. "But that's
queer talk for a gentleman like you, sir, in the British Museum!"
And he wagged his helmet at my invalid, who had taken his airing in
frock-coat and top-hat, the more readily to assume his present
part.</p>

<p>"What!" cried Raffles, "simply saying to my friend that I'd like
to lift the gold cup? Why, so I should, officer, so I should! I
don't mind who hears me say so. It's one of the most beautiful
things I ever saw in all my life."</p>

<p>The constable's face had already relaxed, and now a grin peeped
under the limp moustache. "I daresay there's many as feels like
that, sir," said he.</p>

<p>"Exactly; and I say what I feel, that's all," said Raffles
airily. "But seriously, officer, is a valuable thing like this
quite safe in a case like that?"</p>

<p>"Safe enough as long as I'm here," replied the other, between
grim jest and stout earnest. Raffles studied his face; he was still
watching Raffles; and I kept an eye on them both without putting in
my word.</p>

<p>"You appear to be single-handed," observed Raffles. "Is that
wise?"</p>

<p>The note of anxiety was capitally caught; it was at once
personal and public-spirited, that of the enthusiastic savant,
afraid for a national treasure which few appreciated as he did
himself. And, to be sure, the three of us now had this treasury to
ourselves; one or two others had been there when we entered; but
now they were gone.</p>

<p>"I'm not single-handed," said the officer, comfortably. "See
that seat by the door? One of the attendants sits there all day
long."</p>

<p>"Then where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Talking to another attendant just outside. If you listen you'll
hear them for yourself."</p>

<p>We listened, and we did hear them, but not just outside. In my
own mind I even questioned whether they were in the corridor
through which we had come; to me it sounded as though they were
just outside the corridor.</p>

<p>"You mean the fellow with the billiard-cue who was here when we
came in?" pursued Raffles.</p>

<p>"That wasn't a billiard-cue! It was a pointer," the intelligent
officer explained.</p>

<p>"It ought to be a javelin," said Raffles, nervously. "It ought
to be a poleaxe! The public treasure ought to be better guarded
than this. I shall write to the Times about it&mdash;you see if I
don't!"</p>

<p>All at once, yet somehow not so suddenly as to excite suspicion,
Raffles had become the elderly busybody with nerves; why, I could
not for the life of me imagine; and the policeman seemed equally at
sea.</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, sir," said he, "I'm all right; don't you bother
your head about <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"But you haven't even got a truncheon!"</p>

<p>"Not likely to want one either. You see, sir, it's early as yet;
in a few minutes these here rooms will fill up; and there's safety
in numbers, as they say."</p>

<p>"Oh, it will fill up soon, will it?"</p>

<p>"Any minute now, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"It isn't often empty as long as this, sir. It's the Jubilee, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, what if my friend and I had been professional
thieves? Why, we could have over-powered you in an instant, my good
fellow!"</p>

<p>"That you couldn't; leastways, not without bringing the whole
place about your ears."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall write to the Times, all the same. I'm a
connoisseur in all this sort of thing, and I won't have unnecessary
risks run with the nation's property. You said there was an
attendant just outside, but he sounds to me as though he were at
the other end of the corridor. I shall write to-day!"</p>

<p>For an instant we all three listened; and Raffles was right.
Then I saw two things in one glance. Raffles had stepped a few
inches backward, and stood poised upon the ball of each foot, his
arms half raised, a light in his eyes. And another kind of light
was breaking over the crass features of our friend the
constable.</p>

<p>"Then shall I tell you what <i>I'll</i> do?" he cried, with a
sudden clutch at the whistle-chain on his chest. The whistle flew
out, but it never reached his lips. There were a couple of sharp
smacks, like double barrels discharged all but simultaneously, and
the man reeled against me so that I could not help catching him as
he fell.</p>

<p>"Well done, Bunny! I've knocked him out&mdash;I've knocked him
out! Run you to the door and see if the attendants have heard
anything, and take them on if they have."</p>

<p>Mechanically I did as I was told. There was no time for thought,
still less for remonstrance or reproach, though my surprise must
have been even more complete than that of the constable before
Raffles knocked the sense out of him. Even in my utter
bewilderment, however, the instinctive caution of the real criminal
did not desert me. I ran to the door, but I sauntered through it,
to plant myself before a Pompeiian fresco in the corridor; and
there were the two attendants still gossiping outside the further
door; nor did they hear the dull crash which I heard even as I
watched them out of the corner of each eye.</p>

<p>It was hot weather, as I have said, but the perspiration on my
body seemed already to have turned into a skin of ice. Then I
caught the faint reflection of my own face in the casing of the
fresco, and it frightened me into some semblance of myself as
Raffles joined me with his hands in his pockets. But my fear and
indignation were redoubled at the sight of him, when a single
glance convinced me that his pockets were as empty as his hands,
and his mad outrage the most wanton and reckless of his whole
career.</p>

<p>"Ah, very interesting, very interesting, but nothing to what
they have in the museum at Naples or in Pompeii itself. You must go
there some day, Bunny. I've a good mind to take you myself.
Meanwhile&mdash;slow march! The beggar hasn't moved an eyelid. We
may swing for him if you show indecent haste!"</p>

<p>"We!" I whispered. "We!"</p>

<p>And my knees knocked together as we came up to the chatting
attendants. But Raffles must needs interrupt them to ask the way to
the Prehistoric Saloon.</p>

<p>"At the top of the stairs."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Then we'll work round that way to the Egyptian
part."</p>

<p>And we left them resuming their providential chat.</p>

<p>"I believe you're mad," I said bitterly as we went.</p>

<p>"I believe I was," admitted Raffles; "but I'm not now, and I'll
see you through. A hundred and thirty-nine yards, wasn't it? Then
it can't be more than a hundred and twenty now&mdash;not as much.
Steady, Bunny, for God's sake. It's <i>slow</i> march&mdash;for our
lives."</p>

<p>There was this much management. The rest was our colossal luck.
A hansom was being paid off at the foot of the steps outside, and
in we jumped, Raffles shouting "Charing Cross!" for all Bloomsbury
to hear.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page058.jpg" alt=""
width="603" height="750">
</p>

<p>We had turned into Bloomsbury Street without exchanging a
syllable when he struck the trap-door with his fist.</p>

<p>"Where the devil are you driving us?"</p>

<p>"Charing Cross, sir."</p>

<p>"I said King's Cross! Round you spin, and drive like blazes, or
we miss our train! There's one to York at 10:35," added Raffles as
the trap-door slammed; "we'll book there, Bunny, and then we'll
slope through the subway to the Metropolitan, and so to ground via
Baker Street and Earl's Court."</p>

<p>And actually in half an hour he was seated once more in the
hired carrying chair, while the porter and I staggered upstairs
with my decrepit charge, for whose shattered strength even one hour
in Kew Gardens had proved too much! Then, and not until then, when
we had got rid of the porter and were alone at last, did I tell
Raffles, in the most nervous English at my command, frankly and
exactly what I thought of him and of his latest deed. Once started,
moreover, I spoke as I have seldom spoken to living man; and
Raffles, of all men, stood my abuse without a murmur; or rather he
sat it out, too astounded even to take off his hat, though I
thought his eyebrows would have lifted it from his head.</p>

<p>"But it always was your infernal way," I was savagely
concluding. "You make one plan, and yet you tell me
another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not to-day, Bunny, I swear!"</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me you really did start with the bare idea of
finding a place to hide in for a night?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did."</p>

<p>"It was to be the mere reconnoitre you pretended?"</p>

<p>"There was no pretence about it, Bunny."</p>

<p>"Then why on earth go and do what you did?"</p>

<p>"The reason would be obvious to anyone but you," said Raffles,
still with no unkindly scorn. "It was the temptation of a
minute&mdash;the final impulse of the fraction of a second, when
Roberto saw that I was tempted, and let me see that he saw it. It's
not a thing I care to do, and I sha'n't be happy till the papers
tell me the poor devil is alive. But a knock-out shot was the only
chance for us then."</p>

<p>"Why? You don't get run in for being tempted, nor yet for
showing that you are!"</p>

<p>"But I should have deserved running in if I hadn't yielded to
such a temptation as that, Bunny. It was a chance in a hundred
thousand! We might go there every day of our lives, and never again
be the only outsiders in the room, with the billiard-marking
Johnnie practically out of ear-shot at one and the same time. It
was a gift from the gods; not to have taken it would have been
flying in the face of Providence."</p>

<p>"But you didn't take it," said I. "You went and left it
behind."</p>

<p>I wish I had had a Kodak for the little smile with which Raffles
shook his head, for it was one that he kept for those great moments
of which our vocation is not devoid. All this time he had been
wearing his hat, tilted a little over eyebrows no longer raised.
And now at last I knew where the gold cup was.</p>

<p>It stood for days upon his chimney-piece, this costly trophy
whose ancient history and final fate filled newspaper columns even
in these days of Jubilee, and for which the flower of Scotland Yard
was said to be seeking high and low. Our constable, we learnt, had
been stunned only, and, from the moment that I brought him an
evening paper with the news, Raffles's spirits rose to a height
inconsistent with his equable temperament, and as unusual in him as
the sudden impulse upon which he had acted with such effect. The
cup itself appealed to me no more than it had done before.
Exquisite it might be, handsome it was, but so light in the hand
that the mere gold of it would scarcely have poured three figures
out of the melting-pot. And what said Raffles but that he would
never melt it at all!</p>

<p>"Taking it was an offence against the laws of the land, Bunny.
That is nothing. But destroying it would be a crime against God and
Art, and may I be spitted on the vane of St. Mary Abbot's if I
commit it!"</p>

<p>Talk such as this was unanswerable; indeed, the whole affair had
passed the pale of useful comment; and the one course left to a
practical person was to shrug his shoulders and enjoy the joke.
This was not a little enhanced by the newspaper reports, which
described Raffles as a handsome youth, and his unwilling accomplice
as an older man of blackguardly appearance and low type.</p>

<p>"Hits us both off rather neatly, Bunny," said he. "But what none
of them do justice to is my dear cup. Look at it; only look at it,
man! Was ever anything so rich and yet so chaste? St. Agnes must
have had a pretty bad time, but it would be almost worth it to go
down to posterity in such enamel upon such gold. And then the
history of the thing. Do you realize that it's five hundred years
old and has belonged to Henry the Eighth and to Elizabeth among
others? Bunny, when you have me cremated, you can put my ashes in
yonder cup, and lay us in the deep-delved earth together!"</p>

<p>"And meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"It is the joy of my heart, the light of my life, the delight of
mine eye."</p>

<p>"And suppose other eyes catch sight of it?"</p>

<p>"They never must; they never shall."</p>

<p>Raffles would have been too absurd had he not been thoroughly
alive to his own absurdity; there was nevertheless an underlying
sincerity in his appreciation of any and every form of beauty,
which all his nonsense could not conceal. And his infatuation for
the cup was, as he declared, a very pure passion, since the
circumstances debarred him from the chief joy of the average
collector, that of showing his treasure to his friends. At last,
however, and at the height of his craze, Raffles and reason seemed
to come together again as suddenly as they had parted company in
the Room of Gold.</p>

<p>"Bunny," he cried, flinging his newspaper across the room, "I've
got an idea after your own heart. I know where I can place it after
all!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean the cup?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then I congratulate you."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"Upon the recovery of your senses."</p>

<p>"Thanks galore. But you've been confoundedly unsympathetic about
this thing, Bunny, and I don't think I shall tell you my scheme
till I've carried it out."</p>

<p>"Quite time enough," said I.</p>

<p>"It will mean your letting me loose for an hour or two under
cloud of this very night. To-morrow's Sunday, the Jubilee's on
Tuesday, and old Theobald's coming back for it."</p>

<p>"It doesn't much matter whether he's back or not if you go late
enough."</p>

<p>"I mustn't be late. They don't keep open. No, it's no use your
asking any questions. Go out and buy me a big box of Huntley &amp;
Palmer's biscuits; any sort you like, only they must be theirs, and
absolutely the biggest box they sell."</p>

<p>"My dear man!"</p>

<p>"No questions, Bunny; you do your part and I'll do mine."</p>

<p>Subtlety and success were in his face. It was enough for me, and
I had done his extraordinary bidding within a quarter of an hour.
In another minute Raffles had opened the box and tumbled all the
biscuits into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>"Now newspapers!"</p>

<p>I fetched a pile. He bid the cup of gold a ridiculous farewell,
wrapped it up in newspaper after newspaper, and finally packed it
in the empty biscuit-box.</p>

<p>"Now some brown paper. I don't want to be taken for the grocer's
young man."</p>

<p>A neat enough parcel it made, when the string had been tied and
the ends cut close; what was more difficult was to wrap up Raffles
himself in such a way that even the porter should not recognize him
if they came face to face at the corner. And the sun was still up.
But Raffles would go, and when he did I should not have known him
myself.</p>

<p>He may have been an hour away. It was barely dusk when he
returned, and my first question referred to our dangerous ally, the
porter. Raffles had passed him unsuspected in going, but had
managed to avoid him altogether on the return journey, which he had
completed by way of the other entrance and the roof. I breathed
again.</p>

<p>"And what have you done with the cup?"</p>

<p>"Placed it!"</p>

<p>"How much for? How much for?"</p>

<p>"Let me think. I had a couple of cabs, and the postage was a
tanner, with another twopence for registration. Yes, it cost me
exactly five-and-eight."</p>

<p>"<i>It</i> cost <i>you</i>! But what did you <i>get</i> for it,
Raffles?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my boy."</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"Not a crimson cent."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised. I never thought it had a market value. I
told you so in the beginning," I said, irritably. "But what on
earth have you done with the thing?"</p>

<p>"Sent it to the Queen."</p>

<p>"You haven't!"</p>

<p>Rogue is a word with various meanings, and Raffles had been one
sort of rogue ever since I had known him; but now, for once, he was
the innocent variety, a great gray-haired child, running over with
merriment and mischief.</p>

<p>"Well, I've sent it to Sir Arthur Bigge, to present to her
Majesty, with the loyal respects of the thief, if that will do for
you," said Raffles. "I thought they might take too much stock of me
at the G.P.O. if I addressed it to the Sovereign her-self. Yes, I
drove over to St. Martin's-le-Grand with it, and I registered the
box into the bargain. Do a thing properly if you do it at all."</p>

<p>"But why on earth," I groaned, "do such a thing at all?"</p>

<p>"My dear Bunny, we have been reigned over for sixty years by
infinitely the finest monarch the world has ever seen. The world is
taking the present opportunity of signifying the fact for all it is
worth. Every nation is laying of its best at her royal feet; every
class in the community is doing its little level&mdash;except ours.
All I have done is to remove one reproach from our fraternity."</p>

<p>At this I came round, was infected with his spirit, called him
the sportsman he always was and would be, and shook his daredevil
hand in mine; but, at the same time, I still had my qualms.</p>

<p>"Supposing they trace it to us?" said I.</p>

<p>"There's not much to catch hold of in a biscuit-box by Huntley
&amp; Palmer," replied Raffles; "that was why I sent you for one.
And I didn't write a word upon a sheet of paper which could
possibly be traced. I simply printed two or three on a virginal
post-card&mdash;another half-penny to the bad&mdash;which might
have been bought at any post-office in the kingdom. No, old chap,
the G.P.O. was the one real danger; there was one detective I
spotted for myself; and the sight of him has left me with a thirst.
Whisky and Sullivans for two, Bunny, if you please."</p>

<p>Raffles was soon clinking his glass against mine.</p>

<p>"The Queen," said he. "God bless her!"</p>

<p>A piano-organ was pouring the metallic music through our open
windows, while a voice of brass brayed the words, which I have
since obtained, and print above for identification by such as know
their Italy better than I. They will not thank me for reminding
them of a tune so lately epidemic in that land of aloes and blue
skies; but at least it is unlikely to run in their heads as the
ribald accompaniment to a tragedy; and it does in mine.</p>

<p>It was in the early heat of August, and the hour that of the
lawful and necessary siesta for such as turn night into day. I was
therefore shutting my window in a rage, and wondering whether I
should not do the same for Raffles, when he appeared in the silk
pajamas to which the chronic solicitude of Dr. Theobald confined
him from morning to night.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Bunny," said he. "I rather like that thing, and
want to listen. What sort of fellows are they to look at, by the
way?"</p>

<p>I put my head out to see, it being a primary rule of our quaint
establishment that Raffles must never show himself at any of the
windows. I remember now how hot the sill was to my elbows, as I
leant upon it and looked down, in order to satisfy a curiosity in
which I could see no point.</p>

<p>"Dirty-looking beggars," said I over my shoulder: "dark as dark;
blue chins, oleaginous curls, and ear-rings; ragged as they make
them, but nothing picturesque in their rags."</p>

<p>"Neapolitans all over," murmured Raffles behind me; "and that's
a characteristic touch, the one fellow singing while the other
grinds; they always have that out there."</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page070.jpg" alt=""
width="516" height="750">
</p>

<p>"He's rather a fine chap, the singer," said I, as the song
ended. "My hat, what teeth! He's looking up here, and grinning all
round his head; shall I chuck him anything?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have no reason to love the Neapolitans; but it takes me
back&mdash;it takes me back! Yes, here you are, one each."</p>

<p>It was a couple of half-crowns that Raffles put into my hand,
but I had thrown them into the street for pennies before I saw what
they were. Thereupon I left the Italians bowing to the mud, as well
they might, and I turned to protest against such wanton waste. But
Raffles was walking up and down, his head bent, his eyes troubled;
and his one excuse disarmed remonstrance.</p>

<p>"They took me back," he repeated. "My God, how they took me
back!"</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped in his stride.</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Bunny, old chap; but if you like you
shall. I always meant to tell you some day, but never felt worked
up to it before, and it's not the kind of thing one talks about for
talking's sake. It isn't a nursery story, Bunny, and there isn't a
laugh in it from start to finish; on the contrary, you have often
asked me what turned my hair gray, and now you are going to
hear."</p>

<p>This was promising, but Raffles's manner was something more. It
was unique in my memory of the man. His fine face softened and set
hard by turns. I never knew it so hard. I never knew it so soft.
And the same might be said of his voice, now tender as any woman's,
now flying to the other extreme of equally unwonted ferocity. But
this was toward the end of his tale; the beginning he treated
characteristically enough, though I could have wished for a less
cavalier account of the island of Elba, where, upon his own
showing, he had met with much humanity.</p>

<p>"Deadly, my dear Bunny, is not the word for that glorified snag,
or for the mollusks, its inhabitants. But they started by wounding
my vanity, so perhaps I am prejudiced, after all. I sprung myself
upon them as a shipwrecked sailor&mdash;a sole
survivor&mdash;stripped in the sea and landed without a
stitch&mdash;yet they took no more interest in me than you do in
Italian organ-grinders. They were decent enough. I didn't have to
pick and steal for a square meal and a pair of trousers; it would
have been more exciting if I had. But what a place! Napoleon
couldn't stand it, you remember, but he held on longer than I did.
I put in a few weeks in their infernal mines, simply to pick up a
smattering of Italian; then got across to the mainland in a little
wooden timber-tramp; and ungratefully glad I was to leave Elba
blazing in just such another sunset as the one you won't
forget.</p>

<p>"The tramp was bound for Naples, but first it touched at Baiae,
where I carefully deserted in the night. There are too many English
in Naples itself, though I thought it would make a first happy
hunting-ground when I knew the language better and had altered
myself a bit more. Meanwhile I got a billet of several sorts on one
of the loveliest spots that ever I struck on all my travels. The
place was a vineyard, but it overhung the sea, and I got taken on
as tame sailorman and emergency bottle-washer. The wages were the
noble figure of a lira and a half, which is just over a bob, a day,
but there were lashings of sound wine for one and all, and better
wine to bathe in. And for eight whole months, my boy, I was an
absolutely honest man. The luxury of it, Bunny! I out-heroded
Herod, wouldn't touch a grape, and went in the most delicious
danger of being knifed for my principles by the thieving crew I had
joined.</p>

<p>"It was the kind of place where every prospect pleases&mdash;and
all the rest of it&mdash;especially all the rest. But may I see it
in my dreams till I die&mdash;as it was in the
beginning&mdash;before anything began to happen. It was a wedge of
rock sticking out into the bay, thatched with vines, and with the
rummiest old house on the very edge of all, a devil of a height
above the sea: you might have sat at the windows and dropped your
Sullivan-ends plumb into blue water a hundred and fifty feet
below.</p>

<p>"From the garden behind the house&mdash;such a garden,
Bunny&mdash;oleanders and mimosa, myrtles, rosemarys and red
tangles of fiery, untamed flowers&mdash;in a corner of this garden
was the top of a subterranean stair down to the sea; at least there
were nearly two hundred steps tunnelled through the solid rock;
then an iron gate, and another eighty steps in the open air; and
last of all a cave fit for pirates,
a-penny-plain-and-two-pence-colored. This cave gave upon the
sweetest little thing in coves, all deep blue water and honest
rocks; and here I looked after the vineyard shipping, a pot-bellied
tub with a brown sail, and a sort of dingy. The tub took the wine
to Naples, and the dingy was the tub's tender.</p>

<p>"The house above was said to be on the identical site of a
suburban retreat of the admirable Tiberius; there was the old
sinner's private theatre with the tiers cut clean to this day, the
well where he used to fatten his lampreys on his slaves, and a
ruined temple of those ripping old Roman bricks, shallow as
dominoes and ruddier than the cherry. I never was much of an
antiquary, but I could have become one there if I'd had nothing
else to do; but I had lots. When I wasn't busy with the boats I had
to trim the vines, or gather the grapes, or even help make the wine
itself in a cool, dark, musty vault underneath the temple, that I
can see and smell as I jaw. And can't I hear it and feel it too!
Squish, squash, bubble; squash, squish, guggle; and your feet as
though you had been wading through slaughter to a throne. Yes,
Bunny, you mightn't think it, but this good right foot, that never
was on the wrong side of the crease when the ball left my hand, has
also been known to</p>

<p align="center" class="note">'crush the lees of pleasure<br>
&nbsp;From sanguine grapes of pain.'"</p>

<p>He made a sudden pause, as though he had stumbled on the truth
in jest. His face filled with lines. We were sitting in the room
that had been bare when first I saw it; there were basket-chairs
and a table in it now, all meant ostensibly for me; and hence
Raffles would slip to his bed, with schoolboy relish, at every
tinkle of the bell. This afternoon we felt fairly safe, for
Theobald had called in the morning, and Mrs. Theobald still took up
much of his time. Through the open window we could hear the
piano-organ and "Mar&mdash;gar&mdash;ri" a few hundred yards
further on. I fancied Raffles was listening to it while he paused.
He shook his head abstractedly when I handed him the cigarettes;
and his tone hereafter was never just what it had been.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Bunny, whether you're a believer in
transmigration of souls. I have often thought it easier to believe
than lots of other things, and I have been pretty near believing in
it myself since I had my being on that villa of Tiberius. The brute
who had it in my day, if he isn't still running it with a whole
skin, was or is as cold-blooded a blackguard as the worst of the
emperors, but I have often thought he had a lot in common with
Tiberius. He had the great high sensual Roman nose, eyes that were
sinks of iniquity in themselves, and that swelled with fatness,
like the rest of him, so that he wheezed if he walked a yard;
otherwise rather a fine beast to look at, with a huge gray
moustache, like a flying gull, and the most courteous manners even
to his men; but one of the worst, Bunny, one of the worst that ever
was. It was said that the vineyard was only his hobby; if so, he
did his best to make his hobby pay. He used to come out from Naples
for the week-ends&mdash;in the tub when it wasn't too rough for his
nerves&mdash;and he didn't always come alone. His very name sounded
unhealthy&mdash;Corbucci. I suppose I ought to add that he was a
Count, though Counts are two-a-penny in Naples, and in season all
the year round.</p>

<p>"He had a little English, and liked to air it upon me, much to
my disgust; if I could not hope to conceal my nationality as yet, I
at least did not want to have it advertised; and the swine had
English friends. When he heard that I was bathing in November, when
the bay is still as warm as new milk, he would shake his wicked old
head and say, 'You are very audashuss&mdash;you are very
audashuss!' and put on no end of side before his Italians. By God,
he had pitched upon the right word unawares, and I let him know it
in the end!</p>

<p>"But that bathing, Bunny; it was absolutely the best I ever had
anywhere. I said just now the water was like wine; in my own mind I
used to call it blue champagne, and was rather annoyed that I had
no one to admire the phrase. Otherwise I assure you that I missed
my own particular kind very little indeed, though I often wished
that <i>you</i> were there, old chap; particularly when I went for
my lonesome swim; first thing in the morning, when the Bay was all
rose-leaves, and last thing at night, when your body caught
phosphorescent fire! Ah, yes, it was a good enough life for a
change; a perfect paradise to lie low in; another Eden until
...</p>

<p>"My poor Eve!"</p>

<p>And he fetched a sigh that took away his words; then his jaws
snapped together, and his eyes spoke terribly while he conquered
his emotion. I pen the last word advisedly. I fancy it is one which
I have never used before in writing of A. J. Raffles, for I cannot
at the moment recall any other occasion upon which its use would
have been justified. On resuming, however, he was not only calm,
but cold; and this flying for safety to the other extreme is the
single instance of self-distrust which the present Achates can
record to the credit of his impious &AElig;neas.</p>

<p>"I called the girl Eve," said he. "Her real name was Faustina,
and she was one of a vast family who hung out in a hovel on the
inland border of the vineyard. And Aphrodite rising from the sea
was less wonderful and not more beautiful than Aphrodite emerging
from that hole!</p>

<p>"It was the most exquisite face I ever saw or shall see in this
life. Absolutely perfect features; a skin that reminded you of old
gold, so delicate was its bronze; magnificent hair, not black but
nearly; and such eyes and teeth as would have made the fortune of a
face without another point. I tell you, Bunny, London would go mad
about a girl like that. But I don't believe there's such another in
the world. And there she was wasting her sweetness upon that lovely
but desolate little corner of it! Well, she did not waste it upon
me. I would have married her, and lived happily ever after in such
a hovel as her people's&mdash;with her. Only to look at
her&mdash;only to look at her for the rest of my days&mdash;I could
have lain low and remained dead even to you! And that's all I'm
going to tell you about that, Bunny; cursed be he who tells more!
Yet don't run away with the idea that this poor Faustina was the
only woman I ever cared about. I don't believe in all that 'only'
rot; nevertheless I tell you that she was the one being who ever
entirely satisfied my sense of beauty; and I honestly believe I
could have chucked the world and been true to Faustina for that
alone.</p>

<p>"We met sometimes in the little temple I told you about,
sometimes among the vines; now by honest accident, now by flagrant
design; and found a ready-made rendezvous, romantic as one could
wish, in the cave down all those subterranean steps. Then the sea
would call us&mdash;my blue champagne&mdash;my sparkling
cobalt&mdash;and there was the dingy ready to our hand. Oh, those
nights! I never knew which I liked best, the moonlit ones when you
sculled through silver and could see for miles, or the dark nights
when the fishermen's torches stood for the sea, and a red zig-zag
in the sky for old Vesuvius. We were happy. I don't mind owning it.
We seemed not to have a care between us. My mates took no interest
in my affairs, and Faustina's family did not appear to bother about
her. The Count was in Naples five nights of the seven; the other
two we sighed apart.</p>

<p>"At first it was the oldest story in literature&mdash;Eden plus
Eve. The place had been a heaven on earth before, but now it was
heaven itself. So for a little; then one night, a Monday night,
Faustina burst out crying in the boat; and sobbed her story as we
drifted without mishap by the mercy of the Lord. And that was
almost as old a story as the other.</p>

<p>"She was engaged&mdash;what! Had I never heard of it? Did I mean
to upset the boat? What was her engagement beside our love?
'Niente, niente,' crooned Faustina, sighing yet smiling through her
tears. No, but what did matter was that the man had threatened to
stab her to the heart&mdash;and would do it as soon as look at
her&mdash;that I knew.</p>

<p>"I knew it merely from my knowledge of the Neapolitans, for I
had no idea who the man might be. I knew it, and yet I took this
detail better than the fact of the engagement, though now I began
to laugh at both. As if I was going to let her marry anybody else!
As if a hair of her lovely head should be touched while I lived to
protect her! I had a great mind to row away to blazes with her that
very night, and never go near the vineyard again, or let her
either. But we had not a lira between us at the time, and only the
rags in which we sat barefoot in the boat. Besides, I had to know
the name of the animal who had threatened a woman, and such a woman
as this.</p>

<p>"For a long time she refused to tell me, with splendid obduracy;
but I was as determined as she; so at last she made conditions. I
was not to go and get put in prison for sticking a knife into
him&mdash;he wasn't worth it&mdash;and I did promise not to stab
him in the back. Faustina seemed quite satisfied, though a little
puzzled by my manner, having herself the racial tolerance for cold
steel; and next moment she had taken away my breath. 'It is
Stefano,' she whispered, and hung her head.</p>

<p>"And well she might, poor thing! Stefano, of all creatures on
God's earth&mdash;for her!</p>

<p>"Bunny, he was a miserable little undersized
wretch&mdash;ill-favored&mdash;servile&mdash;surly&mdash;and second
only to his master in bestial cunning and hypocrisy. His face was
enough for me; that was what I read in it, and I don't often make
mistakes. He was Corbucci's own confidential body-servant, and that
alone was enough to damn him in decent eyes: always came out first
on the Saturday with the spese, to have all ready for his master
and current mistress, and stayed behind on the Monday to clear and
lock up. Stefano! That worm! I could well understand his
threatening a woman with a knife; what beat me was how any woman
could ever have listened to him; above all, that Faustina should be
the one! It passed my comprehension. But I questioned her as gently
as I could; and her explanation was largely the thread-bare one you
would expect. Her parents were so poor. They were so many in
family. Some of them begged&mdash;would I promise never to tell?
Then some of them stole&mdash;sometimes&mdash;and all knew the
pains of actual want. She looked after the cows, but there were
only two of them, and brought the milk to the vineyard and
elsewhere; but that was not employment for more than one; and there
were countless sisters waiting to take her place. Then he was so
rich, Stefano.</p>

<p>" 'Rich!' I echoed. 'Stefano?'</p>

<p>" 'Si, Arturo mio.'</p>

<p>"Yes, I played the game on that vineyard, Bunny, even to going
my own first name.</p>

<p>" 'And how comes he to be rich?' I asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"She did not know; but he had given her such beautiful jewels;
the family had lived on them for months, she pretending an avocat
had taken charge of them for her against her marriage. But I cared
nothing about all that.</p>

<p>" 'Jewels! Stefano!' I could only mutter.</p>

<p>" 'Perhaps the Count has paid for some of them. He is very
kind.'</p>

<p>" 'To you, is he?'</p>

<p>" 'Oh, yes, very kind.'</p>

<p>" 'And you would live in his house afterwards?'</p>

<p>" 'Not now, mia cara&mdash;not now!'</p>

<p>" 'No, by God you don't!' said I in English. 'But you would have
done so, eh?'</p>

<p>" 'Of course. That was arranged. The Count is really very
kind.'</p>

<p>" 'Do you see anything of him when he comes here?'</p>

<p>"Yes, he had sometimes brought her little presents, sweetmeats,
ribbons, and the like; but the offering had always been made
through this toad of a Stefano. Knowing the men, I now knew all.
But Faustina, she had the pure and simple heart, and the white
soul, by the God who made it, and for all her kindness to a
tattered scapegrace who made love to her in broken Italian between
the ripples and the stars. She was not to know what I was,
remember; and beside Corbucci and his henchman I was the Archangel
Gabriel come down to earth.</p>

<p>"Well, as I lay awake that night, two more lines of Swinburne
came into my head, and came to stay:</p>

<p align="center" class="note">"God said 'Let him who wins her
take<br>
&nbsp;And keep Faustine.'</p>

<p>"On that couplet I slept at last, and it was my text and
watchword when I awoke in the morning. I forget how well you know
your Swinburne, Bunny; but don't you run away with the idea that
there was anything else in common between his Faustine and mine.
For the last time let me tell you that poor Faustina was the
whitest and the best I ever knew.</p>

<p>"Well, I was strung up for trouble when the next Saturday came,
and I'll tell you what I had done. I had broken the pledge and
burgled Corbucci's villa in my best manner during his absence in
Naples. Not that it gave me the slightest trouble; but no human
being could have told that I had been in, when I came out. And I
had stolen nothing, mark you, but only borrowed a revolver from a
drawer in the Count's desk, with one or two trifling accessories;
for by this time I had the measure of these damned Neapolitans.
They are spry enough with a knife, but you show them the business
end of a shooting-iron, and they'll streak like rabbits for the
nearest hole. But the revolver wasn't for my own use. It was for
Faustina, and I taught her how to use it in the cave down there by
the sea, shooting at candles stuck upon the rock. The noise in the
cave was something frightful, but high up above it couldn't be
heard at all, as we proved to each other's satisfaction pretty
early in the proceedings. So now Faustina was armed with munitions
of self-defence; and I knew enough of her character to entertain no
doubt as to their spirited use upon occasion. Between the two of
us, in fact, our friend Stefano seemed tolerably certain of a warm
week-end.</p>

<p>"But the Saturday brought word that the Count was not coming
this week, being in Rome on business, and unable to return in time;
so for a whole Sunday we were promised peace; and made bold plans
accordingly. There was no further merit in hushing this thing up.
'Let him who wins her take and keep Faustine.' Yes, but let him win
her openly, or lose her and be damned to him! So on the Sunday I
was going to have it out with her people&mdash;with the Count and
Stefano as soon as they showed their noses. I had no inducement,
remember, ever to return to surreptitious life within a cab-fare of
Wormwood Scrubbs. Faustina and the Bay of Naples were quite good
enough for me. And the prehistoric man in me rather exulted in the
idea of fighting for my desire.</p>

<p>"On the Saturday, however, we were able to meet for the last
time as heretofore&mdash;just once more in secret&mdash;down there
in the cave&mdash;as soon as might be after dark. Neither of us
minded if we were kept for hours; each knew in the end that the
other would come; and there was a charm of its own even in waiting
with such knowledge. But that night I did lose patience: not in the
cave, but up above, where first on one pretext and then on another
the direttore kept me going until I smelt a rat. He was not given
to exacting overtime, this direttore, whose only fault was his
servile subjection to our common boss. It seemed pretty obvious,
therefore, that he was acting upon some secret instructions from
Corbucci himself, and, the moment I suspected this, I asked him to
his face if it was not the case. And it was; he admitted it with
many shrugs, being a conveniently weak person, whom one felt almost
ashamed of bullying as the occasion demanded.</p>

<p>"The fact was, however, that the Count had sent for him on
finding he had to go to Rome, and had said he was very sorry to go
just then, as among other things he intended to speak to me about
Faustina. Stefano had told him all about his row with her, and
moreover that it was on my account, which Faustina had never told
me, though I had guessed as much for myself. Well, the Count was
going to take his jackal's part for all he was worth, which was
just exactly what I had expected him to do. He intended going for
me on his return, but meanwhile I was not to make hay in his
absence, and so this tool of a direttore had orders to keep me at
it night and day. I undertook not to give the poor beast away, but
at the same time told him I had not the faintest intention of doing
another stroke of work that night.</p>

<p>"It was very dark, and I remember knocking my head against the
oranges as I ran up the long, shallow steps which ended the journey
between the direttore's lodge and the villa itself. But at the back
of the villa was the garden I spoke about, and also a bare chunk of
the cliff where it was bored by that subterranean stair. So I saw
the stars close overhead, and the fishermen's torches far below,
the coastwise lights and the crimson hieroglyph that spelt
Vesuvius, before I plunged into the darkness of the shaft. And that
was the last time I appreciated the unique and peaceful charm of
this outlandish spot.</p>

<p>"The stair was in two long flights, with an air-hole or two at
the top of the upper one, but not another pin-prick till you came
to the iron gate at the bottom of the lower. As you may read of an
infinitely lighter place, in a finer work of fiction than you are
ever likely to write, Bunny, it was 'gloomy at noon, dark as
midnight at dusk, and black as the ninth plague of Egypt at
midnight.' I won't swear to my quotation, but I will to those
stairs. They were as black that night as the inside of the safest
safe in the strongest strong-room in the Chancery Lane Deposit. Yet
I had not got far down them with my bare feet before I heard
somebody else coming up in boots. You may imagine what a turn that
gave me! It could not be Faustina, who went barefoot three seasons
of the four, and yet there was Faustina waiting for me down below.
What a fright she must have had! And all at once my own blood ran
cold: for the man sang like a kettle as he plodded up and up. It
was, it must be, the short-winded Count himself, whom we all
supposed to be in Rome!</p>

<p>"Higher he came and nearer, nearer, slowly yet hurriedly, now
stopping to cough and gasp, now taking a few steps by elephantine
assault. I should have enjoyed the situation if it had not been for
poor Faustina in the cave; as it was I was filled with nameless
fears. But I could not resist giving that grampus Corbucci one bad
moment on account. A crazy hand-rail ran up one wall, so I
carefully flattened myself against the other, and he passed within
six inches of me, puffing and wheezing like a brass band. I let him
go a few steps higher, and then I let him have it with both
lungs.</p>

<p>"'Buona sera, eccellenza, signori!' I roared after him. And a
scream came down in answer&mdash;such a scream! A dozen different
terrors were in it; and the wheezing had stopped, with the old
scoundrel's heart.</p>

<p>" 'Chi sta la?' he squeaked at last, gibbering and whimpering
like a whipped monkey, so that I could not bear to miss his face,
and got a match all ready to strike.</p>

<p>" 'Arturo, signori.'</p>

<p>"He didn't repeat my name, nor did he damn me in heaps. He did
nothing but wheeze for a good minute, and when he spoke it was with
insinuating civility, in his best English.</p>

<p>" 'Come nearer, Arturo. You are in the lower regions down there.
I want to speak with you.'</p>

<p>" 'No, thanks. I'm in a hurry,' I said, and dropped that match
back into my pocket. He might be armed, and I was not.</p>

<p>" 'So you are in a 'urry!' and he wheezed amusement. 'And you
thought I was still in Rome, no doubt; and so I was until this
afternoon, when I caught train at the eleventh moment, and then
another train from Naples to Pozzuoli. I have been rowed here now
by a fisherman of Pozzuoli. I had not time to stop anywhere in
Naples, but only to drive from station to station. So I am without
Stefano, Arturo, I am without Stefano.'</p>

<p>"His sly voice sounded preternaturally sly in the absolute
darkness, but even through that impenetrable veil I knew it for a
sham. I had laid hold of the hand-rail. It shook violently in my
hand; he also was holding it where he stood. And these suppressed
tremors, or rather their detection in this way, struck a strange
chill to my heart, just as I was beginning to pluck it up.</p>

<p>" 'It is lucky for Stefano,' said I, grim as death.</p>

<p>" 'Ah, but you must not be too 'ard on 'im,' remonstrated the
Count. 'You have stole his girl, he speak with me about it, and I
wish to speak with you. It is very audashuss, Arturo, very
audashuss! Perhaps you are even going to meet her now, eh?'"</p>

<p>I told him straight that I was.</p>

<p>" 'Then there is no 'urry, for she is not there.'</p>

<p>" 'You didn't see her in the cave?' I cried, too delighted at
the thought to keep it to myself.</p>

<p>" 'I had no such fortune,' the old devil said.</p>

<p>" 'She is there, all the same.'</p>

<p>" 'I only wish I 'ad known.'</p>

<p>" 'And I've kept her long enough!'</p>

<p>"In fact I threw this over my shoulder as I turned and went
running down.</p>

<p>" 'I 'ope you will find her!' his malicious voice came croaking
after me. 'I 'ope you will&mdash;I 'ope so.'</p>

<p>"And find her I did."</p>

<p>Raffles had been on his feet some time, unable to sit still or
to stand, moving excitedly about the room. But now he stood still
enough, his elbows on the cast-iron mantelpiece, his head between
his hands.</p>

<p>"Dead?" I whispered.</p>

<p>And he nodded to the wall.</p>

<p>"There was not a sound in the cave. There was no answer to my
voice. Then I went in, and my foot touched hers, and it was colder
than the rock ... Bunny, they had stabbed her to the heart. She had
fought them, and they had stabbed her to the heart!"</p>

<p>"You say 'they,'" I said gently, as he stood in heavy silence,
his back still turned. "I thought Stefano had been left
behind?"</p>

<p>Raffles was round in a flash, his face white-hot, his eyes
dancing death.</p>

<p>"He was in the cave!" he shouted. "I saw him&mdash;I spotted
him&mdash;it was broad twilight after those stairs&mdash;and I went
for him with my bare hands. Not fists, Bunny; not fists for a thing
like that; I meant getting my fingers into his vile little heart
and tearing it out by the roots. I was stark mad. But he had the
revolver&mdash;hers. He blazed it at arm's length, and missed. And
that steadied me. I had smashed his funny-bone against the rock
before he could blaze again; the revolver fell with a rattle, but
without going off; in an instant I had it tight, and the little
swine at my mercy at last."</p>

<p>"You didn't show him any?"</p>

<p>"Mercy? With Faustina dead at my feet? I should have deserved
none in the next world if I had shown him any in this! No, I just
stood over him, with the revolver in both hands, feeling the
chambers with my thumb; and as I stood he stabbed at me; but I
stepped back to that one, and brought him down with a bullet in his
guts.</p>

<p>" 'And I can spare you two or three more,' I said, for my poor
girl could not have fired a shot. 'Take that one to hell with
you&mdash;and that&mdash;and that!'</p>

<p>"Then I started coughing and wheezing like the Count himself,
for the place was full of smoke. When it cleared my man was very
dead, and I tipped him into the sea, to defile that rather than
Faustina's cave. And then&mdash;and then&mdash;we were alone for
the last time, she and I, in our own pet haunt; and I could
scarcely see her, yet I would not strike a match, for I knew she
would not have me see her as she was. I could say good-by to her
without that. I said it; and I left her like a man, and up the
first open-air steps with my head in the air and the stars all
sharp in the sky; then suddenly they swam, and back I went like a
lunatic, to see if she was really dead, to bring her back to life
... Bunny, I can't tell you any more."</p>

<p>"Not of the Count?" I murmured at last.</p>

<p>"Not even of the Count," said Raffles, turning round with a
sigh. "I left him pretty sorry for himself; but what was the good
of that? I had taken blood for blood, and it was not Corbucci who
had killed Faustina. No, the plan was his, but that was not part of
the plan. They had found out about our meetings in the cave:
nothing simpler than to have me kept hard at it overhead and to
carry off Faustina by brute force in the boat. It was their only
chance, for she had said more to Stefano than she had admitted to
me, and more than I am going to repeat about myself. No persuasion
would have induced her to listen to him again; so they tried force;
and she drew Corbucci's revolver on them, but they had taken her by
surprise, and Stefano stabbed her before she could fire."</p>

<p>"But how do you know all that?" I asked Raffles, for his tale
was going to pieces in the telling, and the tragic end of poor
Faustina was no ending for me.</p>

<p>"Oh," said he, "I had it from Corbucci at his own revolver's
point. He was waiting at his window, and I could have potted him at
my ease where he stood against the light listening hard enough but
not seeing a thing. So he asked whether it was Stefano, and I
whispered, 'Si, signore'; and then whether he had finished Arturo,
and I brought the same shot off again. He had let me in before he
knew who was finished and who was not."</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page098.jpg" alt=""
width="567" height="750">
</p>

<p>"And did you finish him?"</p>

<p>"No; that was too good for Corbucci. But I bound and gagged him
about as tight as man was ever gagged or bound, and I left him in
his room with the shutters shut and the house locked up. The
shutters of that old place were six inches thick, and the walls
nearly six feet; that was on the Saturday night, and the Count
wasn't expected at the vineyard before the following Saturday.
Meanwhile he was supposed to be in Rome. But the dead would
doubtless be discovered next day, and I am afraid this would lead
to his own discovery with the life still in him. I believe he
figured on that himself, for he sat threatening me gamely till the
last. You never saw such a sight as he was, with his head split in
two by a ruler tied at the back of it, and his great moustache
pushed up into his bulging eyes. But I locked him up in the dark
without a qualm, and I wished and still wish him every torment of
the damned."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"The night was still young, and within ten miles there was the
best of ports in a storm, and hundreds of holds for the humble
stowaway to choose from. But I didn't want to go further than
Genoa, for by this time my Italian would wash, so I chose the old
Norddeutscher Lloyd, and had an excellent voyage in one of the
boats slung in-board over the bridge. That's better than any hold,
Bunny, and I did splendidly on oranges brought from the
vineyard."</p>

<p>"And at Genoa?"</p>

<p>"At Genoa I took to my wits once more, and have been living on
nothing else ever since. But there I had to begin all over again,
and at the very bottom of the ladder. I slept in the streets. I
begged. I did all manner of terrible things, rather hoping for a
bad end, but never coming to one. Then one day I saw a white-headed
old chap looking at me through a shop-window&mdash;a window I had
designs upon&mdash;and when I stared at him he stared at
me&mdash;and we wore the same rags. So I had come to that! But one
reflection makes many. I had not recognized myself; who on earth
would recognize me? London called me&mdash;and here I am. Italy had
broken my heart&mdash;and there it stays."</p>

<p>Flippant as a schoolboy one moment, playful even in the
bitterness of the next, and now no longer giving way to the feeling
which had spoilt the climax of his tale, Raffles needed knowing as
I alone knew him for a right appreciation of those last words. That
they were no mere words I know full well. That, but for the tragedy
of his Italian life, that life would have sufficed him for years,
if not for ever, I did and do still believe. But I alone see him as
I saw him then, the lines upon his face, and the pain behind the
lines; how they came to disappear, and what removed them, you will
never guess. It was the one thing you would have expected to have
the opposite effect, the thing indeed that had forced his
confidence, the organ and the voice once more beneath our very
windows:</p>

<p class="poem">"Margarita de Parete,<br>
&nbsp;era a' sarta d' e' signore;<br>
&nbsp;se pugneva sempe e ddete<br>
&nbsp;pe penzare a Salvatore!<br>
"Mar&mdash;ga&mdash;ri,<br>
&nbsp;e perzo e Salvatore!<br>
Mar&mdash;ga&mdash;ri,<br>
&nbsp;Ma l'ommo e cacciatore!<br>
Mar&mdash;ga&mdash;ri,<br>
&nbsp;Nun ce aje corpa tu!<br>
Chello ch' e fatto, e fatto, un ne parlammo cchieu!"</p>

<p>I simply stared at Raffles. Instead of deepening, his lines had
vanished. He looked years younger, mischievous and merry and alert
as I remembered him of old in the breathless crisis of some madcap
escapade. He was holding up his finger; he was stealing to the
window; he was peeping through the blind as though our side street
were Scotland Yard itself; he was stealing back again, all revelry,
excitement, and suspense.</p>

<p>"I half thought they were after me before," said he. "That was
why I made you look. I daren't take a proper look myself, but what
a jest if they were! What a jest!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean the police?" said I.</p>

<p>"The police! Bunny, do you know them and me so little that you
can look me in the face and ask such a question? My boy, I'm dead
to them&mdash;off their books&mdash;a good deal deader than being
off the hooks! Why, if I went to Scotland Yard this minute, to give
myself up, they'd chuck me out for a harmless lunatic. No, I fear
an enemy nowadays, and I go in terror of the sometime friend, but I
have the utmost confidence in the dear police."</p>

<p>"Then whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The Camorra!"</p>

<p>I repeated the word with a different intonation. Not that I had
never heard of that most powerful and sinister of secret societies;
but I failed to see on what grounds Raffles should jump to the
conclusion that these everyday organ-grinders belonged to it.</p>

<p>"It was one of Corbucci's threats," said he. "If I killed him
the Camorra would certainly kill me; he kept on telling me so; it
was like his cunning not to say that he would put them on my tracks
whether or no."</p>

<p>"He is probably a member himself!"</p>

<p>"Obviously, from what he said."</p>

<p>"But why on earth should you think that these fellows are?" I
demanded, as that brazen voice came rasping through a second
verse.</p>

<p>"I don't think. It was only an idea. That thing is so thoroughly
Neapolitan, and I never heard it on a London organ before. Then
again, what should bring them back here?"</p>

<p>I peeped through the blind in my turn; and, to be sure, there
was the fellow with the blue chin and the white teeth watching our
windows, and ours only, as he bawled.</p>

<p>"And why?" cried Raffles, his eyes dancing when I told him.</p>

<p>"Why should they come sneaking back to us? Doesn't that look
suspicious, Bunny; doesn't that promise a lark?"</p>

<p>"Not to me," I said, having the smile for once. "How many
people, should you imagine, toss them five shilling for as many
minutes of their infernal row? You seem to forget that's what you
did an hour ago!"</p>

<p>Raffles had forgotten. His blank face confessed the fact. Then
suddenly he burst out laughing at himself.</p>

<p>"Bunny," said he, "you've no imagination, and I never knew I had
so much! Of course you're right. I only wish you were not, for
there's nothing I should enjoy more than taking on another
Neapolitan or two. You see, I owe them something still! I didn't
settle in full. I owe them more than ever I shall pay them on this
side Styx!"</p>

<p>He had hardened even as he spoke: the lines and the years had
come again, and his eyes were flint and steel, with an honest grief
behind the glitter.</p>

</h2>

<p>As I have had occasion to remark elsewhere, the pick of our
exploits, from a frankly criminal point of view, are of least use
for the comparatively pure purposes of these papers. They might be
appreciated in a trade journal (if only that want could be
supplied), by skilled manipulators of the jemmy and the large light
bunch; but, as records of unbroken yet insignificant success, they
would be found at once too trivial and too technical, if not sordid
and unprofitable into the bargain. The latter epithets, and worse,
have indeed already been applied, if not to Raffles and all his
works, at least to mine upon Raffles, by more than one worthy
wielder of a virtuous pen. I need not say how heartily I disagree
with that truly pious opinion. So far from admitting a single word
of it, I maintain it is the liveliest warning that I am giving to
the world. Raffles was a genius, and he could not make it pay!
Raffles had invention, resource, incomparable audacity, and a nerve
in ten thousand. He was both strategian and tactician, and we all
now know the difference between the two. Yet for months he had been
hiding like a rat in a hole, unable to show even his altered face
by night or day without risk, unless another risk were courted by
three inches of conspicuous crepe. Then thus far our rewards had
oftener than not been no reward at all. Altogether it was a very
different story from the old festive, unsuspected, club and cricket
days, with their <i>noctes ambrosianae</i> at the Albany.</p>

<p>And now, in addition to the eternal peril of recognition, there
was yet another menace of which I knew nothing. I thought no more
of our Neapolitan organ-grinders, though I did often think of the
moving page that they had torn for me out of my friend's strange
life in Italy. Raffles never alluded to the subject again, and for
my part I had entirely forgotten his wild ideas connecting the
organ-grinders with the Camorra, and imagining them upon his own
tracks. I heard no more of it, and thought as little, as I say.
Then one night in the autumn&mdash;I shrink from shocking the
susceptible for nothing&mdash;but there was a certain house in
Palace Gardens, and when we got there Raffles would pass on. I
could see no soul in sight, no glimmer in the windows. But Raffles
had my arm, and on we went without talking about it. Sharp to the
left on the Notting Hill side, sharper still up Silver Street, a
little tacking west and south, a plunge across High Street, and
presently we were home.</p>

<p>"Pyjamas first," said Raffles, with as much authority as though
it mattered. It was a warm night, however, though September, and I
did not mind until I came in clad as he commanded to find the
autocrat himself still booted and capped. He was peeping through
the blind, and the gas was still turned down. But he said that I
could turn it up, as he helped himself to a cigarette and nothing
with it.</p>

<p>"May I mix you one?" said I.</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"We were followed."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"You never saw it."</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> never looked round."</p>

<p>"I have an eye at the back of each ear, Bunny."</p>

<p>I helped myself and I fear with less moderation than might have
been the case a minute before.</p>

<p>"So that was why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was why," said Raffles, nodding; but he did not smile, and
I put down my glass untouched.</p>

<p>"They were following us then!"</p>

<p>"All up Palace Gardens."</p>

<p>"I thought you wound about coming back over the hill."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, one of them's in the street below at this
moment."</p>

<p>No, he was not fooling me. He was very grim. And he had not
taken off a thing; perhaps he did not think it worth while.</p>

<p>"Plain clothes?" I sighed, following the sartorial train of
thought, even to the loathly arrows that had decorated my person
once already for a little aeon. Next time they would give me
double. The skilly was in my stomach when I saw Raffles's face.</p>

<p>"Who said it was the police, Bunny?" said he. "It's the
Italians. They're only after me; they won't hurt a hair of
<i>your</i> head, let alone cropping it! Have a drink, and don't
mind me. I shall score them off before I'm done."</p>

<p>"And I'll help you!"</p>

<p>"No, old chap, you won't. This is my own little show. I've known
about it for weeks. I first tumbled to it the day those Neapolitans
came back with their organs, though I didn't seriously suspect
things then; they never came again, those two, they had done their
part. That's the Camorra all over, from all accounts. The Count I
told you about is pretty high up in it, by the way he spoke, but
there will be grades and grades between him and the organ-grinders.
I shouldn't be surprised if he had every low-down Neapolitan
ice-creamer in the town upon my tracks! The organization's
incredible. Then do you remember the superior foreigner who came to
the door a few days afterwards? You said he had velvet eyes."</p>

<p>"I never connected him with those two!"</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't, Bunny, so you threatened to kick the
fellow downstairs, and only made them keener on the scent. It was
too late to say anything when you told me. But the very next time I
showed my nose outside I heard a camera click as I passed, and the
fiend was a person with velvet eyes. Then there was a
lull&mdash;that happened weeks ago. They had sent me to Italy for
identification by Count Corbucci."</p>

<p>"But this is all theory," I exclaimed. "How on earth can you
know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Raffles, "but I should like to bet. Our
friend the bloodhound is hanging about the corner near the
pillar-box; look through my window, it's dark in there, and tell me
who he is."</p>

<p>The man was too far away for me to swear to his face, but he
wore a covert-coat of un-English length, and the lamp across the
road played steadily on his boots; they were very yellow, and they
made no noise when he took a turn. I strained my eyes, and all at
once I remembered the thin-soled, low-heeled, splay yellow boots of
the insidious foreigner, with the soft eyes and the brown-paper
face, whom I had turned from the door as a palpable fraud. The ring
at the bell was the first I had heard of him, there had been no
warning step upon the stairs, and my suspicious eye had searched
his feet for rubber soles.</p>

<p>"It's the fellow," I said, returning to Raffles, and I described
his boots.</p>

<p>Raffles was delighted.</p>

<p>"Well done, Bunny; you're coming on," said he. "Now I wonder if
he's been over here all the time, or if they sent him over
expressly? You did better than you think in spotting those boots,
for they can only have been made in Italy, and that looks like the
special envoy. But it's no use speculating. I must find out."</p>

<p>"How can you?"</p>

<p>"He won't stay there all night."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"When he gets tired of it I shall return the compliment and
follow <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Not alone," said I, firmly.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see. We'll see at once," said Raffles, rising. "Out
with the gas, Bunny, while I take a look. Thank you. Now wait a bit
... yes! He's chucked it; he's off already; and so am I!"</p>

<p>But I slipped to our outer door, and held the passage.</p>

<p>"I don't let you go alone, you know."</p>

<p>"You can't come with me in pyjamas."</p>

<p>"Now I see why you made me put them on!"</p>

<p>"Bunny, if you don't shift I shall have to shift you. This is my
very own private one-man show. But I'll be back in an
hour&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"You swear?"</p>

<p>"By all my gods."</p>

<p>I gave in. How could I help giving in? He did not look the man
that he had been, but you never knew with Raffles, and I could not
have him lay a hand on me. I let him go with a shrug and my
blessing, then ran into his room to see the last of him from the
window.</p>

<p>The creature in the coat and boots had reached the end of our
little street, where he appeared to have hesitated, so that Raffles
was just in time to see which way he turned. And Raffles was after
him at an easy pace, and had himself almost reached the corner when
my attention was distracted from the alert nonchalance of his gait.
I was marvelling that it alone had not long ago betrayed him, for
nothing about him was so unconsciously characteristic, when
suddenly I realized that Raffles was not the only person in the
little lonely street. Another pedestrian had entered from the other
end, a man heavily built and clad, with an astrakhan collar to his
coat on this warm night, and a black slouch hat that hid his
features from my bird's-eye view. His steps were the short and
shuffling ones of a man advanced in years and in fatty
degeneration, but of a sudden they stopped beneath my very eyes. I
could have dropped a marble into the dinted crown of the black felt
hat. Then, at the same moment, Raffles turned the corner without
looking round, and the big man below raised both his hands and his
face. Of the latter I saw only the huge white moustache, like a
flying gull, as Raffles had described it; for at a glance I divined
that this was his arch-enemy, the Count Corbucci himself.</p>

<p>I did not stop to consider the subtleties of the system by which
the real hunter lagged behind while his subordinate pointed the
quarry like a sporting dog. I left the Count shuffling onward
faster than before, and I jumped into some clothes as though the
flats were on fire. If the Count was going to follow Raffles in his
turn, then I would follow the Count in mine, and there would be a
midnight procession of us through the town. But I found no sign of
him in the empty street, and no sign in the Earl's Court Road, that
looked as empty for all its length, save for a natural enemy
standing like a waxwork figure with a glimmer at his belt.</p>

<p>"Officer," I gasped, "have you seen anything of an old gentleman
with a big white mustache?"</p>

<p>The unlicked cub of a common constable seemed to eye me the more
suspiciously for the flattering form of my address.</p>

<p>"Took a hansom," said he at length.</p>

<p>A hansom! Then he was not following the others on foot; there
was no guessing his game. But something must be said or done.</p>

<p>"He's a friend of mine," I explained, "and I want to overtake
him. Did you hear where he told the fellow to drive?"</p>

<p>A curt negative was the policeman's reply to that; and if ever I
take part in a night assault-at-arms, revolver versus baton, in the
back kitchen, I know which member of the Metropolitan Police Force
I should like for my opponent.</p>

<p>If there was no overtaking the Count, however, it should be a
comparatively simple matter in the case of the couple on foot, and
I wildly hailed the first hansom that crawled into my ken. I must
tell Raffles who it was that I had seen; the Earl's Court Road was
long, and the time since he vanished in it but a few short minutes.
I drove down the length of that useful thoroughfare, with an eye
apiece on either pavement, sweeping each as with a brush, but never
a Raffles came into the pan. Then I tried the Fulham Road, first to
the west, then to the east, and in the end drove home to the flat
as bold as brass. I did not realize my indiscretion until I had
paid the man and was on the stairs. Raffles never dreamt of driving
all the way back; but I was hoping now to find him waiting up
above. He had said an hour. I had remembered it suddenly. And now
the hour was more than up. But the flat was as empty as I had left
it; the very light that had encouraged me, pale though it was, as I
turned the corner in my hansom, was but the light that I myself had
left burning in the desolate passage.</p>

<p>I can give you no conception of the night that I spent. Most of
it I hung across the sill, throwing a wide net with my ears,
catching every footstep afar off, every hansom bell farther still,
only to gather in some alien whom I seldom even landed in our
street. Then I would listen at the door.</p>

<p>He might come over the roof; and eventually some one did; but
now it was broad daylight, and I flung the door open in the
milkman's face, which whitened at the shock as though I had ducked
him in his own pail.</p>

<p>"You're late," I thundered as the first excuse for my
excitement.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon," said he, indignantly, "but I'm half an hour
before my usual time."</p>

<p>"Then I beg yours," said I; "but the fact is, Mr. Maturin has
had one of his bad nights, and I seem to have been waiting hours
for milk to make him a cup of tea."</p>

<p>This little fib (ready enough for Raffles, though I say it)
earned me not only forgiveness but that obliging sympathy which is
a branch of the business of the man at the door. The good fellow
said that he could see I had been sitting up all night, and he left
me pluming myself upon the accidental art with which I had told my
very necessary tarra-diddle. On reflection I gave the credit to
instinct, not accident, and then sighed afresh as I realized how
the influence of the master was sinking into me, and he Heaven knew
where! But my punishment was swift to follow, for within the hour
the bell rang imperiously twice, and there was Dr. Theobald on our
mat; in a yellow Jaeger suit, with a chin as yellow jutting over
the flaps that he had turned up to hide his pyjamas.</p>

<p>"What's this about a bad night?" said he.</p>

<p>"He couldn't sleep, and he wouldn't let me," I whispered, never
loosening my grasp of the door, and standing tight against the
other wall. "But he's sleeping like a baby now."</p>

<p>"I must see him."</p>

<p>"He gave strict orders that you should not."</p>

<p>"I'm his medical man, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know what he is," I said, shrugging; "the least thing wakes
him, and you will if you insist on seeing him now. It will be the
last time, I warn you! I know what he said, and you don't."</p>

<p>The doctor cursed me under his fiery moustache.</p>

<p>"I shall come up during the course of the morning," he
snarled.</p>

<p>"And I shall tie up the bell," I said, "and if it doesn't ring
he'll be sleeping still, but I will not risk waking him by coming
to the door again."</p>

<p>And with that I shut it in his face. I was improving, as Raffles
had said; but what would it profit me if some evil had befallen
him? And now I was prepared for the worst. A boy came up whistling
and leaving papers on the mats; it was getting on for eight
o'clock, and the whiskey and soda of half-past twelve stood
untouched and stagnant in the tumbler. If the worst had happened to
Raffles, I felt that I would either never drink again, or else
seldom do anything else.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I could not even break my fast, but roamed the flat in
a misery not to be described, my very linen still unchanged, my
cheeks and chin now tawny from the unwholesome night. How long
would it go on? I wondered for a time. Then I changed my tune: how
long could I endure it?</p>

<p>It went on actually until the forenoon only, but my endurance
cannot be measured by the time, for to me every hour of it was an
arctic night. Yet it cannot have been much after eleven when the
ring came at the bell, which I had forgotten to tie up after all.
But this was not the doctor; neither, too well I knew, was it the
wanderer returned. Our bell was the pneumatic one that tells you if
the touch be light or heavy; the hand upon it now was tentative and
shy.</p>

<p>The owner of the hand I had never seen before. He was young and
ragged, with one eye blank, but the other ablaze with some fell
excitement. And straightway he burst into a low torrent of words,
of which all I knew was that they were Italian, and therefore news
of Raffles, if only I had known the language! But dumb-show might
help us somewhat, and in I dragged him, though against his will, a
new alarm in his one wild eye.</p>

<p>"Non capite?" he cried when I had him inside and had withstood
the torrent.</p>

<p>"No, I'm bothered if I do!" I answered, guessing his question
from his tone.</p>

<p>"Vostro amico," he repeated over and over again; and then, "Poco
tempo, poco tempo, poco tempo!"</p>

<p>For once in my life the classical education of my public-school
days was of real value. "My pal, my pal, and no time to be lost!" I
translated freely, and flew for my hat.</p>

<p>"Ecco, signore!" cried the fellow, snatching the watch from my
waistcoat pocket, and putting one black thumb-nail on the long
hand, the other on he numeral twelve. "Mezzogiorno&mdash;poco
tempo&mdash;poco tempo!" And again I seized his meaning, that it
was twenty past eleven, and we must be there by twelve. But where,
but where? It was maddening to be summoned like this, and not to
know what had happened, nor to have any means of finding out. But
my presence of mind stood by me still, I was improving by
seven-league strides, and I crammed my handkerchief between the
drum and hammer of the bell before leaving. The doctor could ring
now till he was black in the face, but I was not coming, and he
need not think it.</p>

<p>I half expected to find a hansom waiting, but there was none,
and we had gone some distance down the Earl's Court Road before we
got one; in fact, we had to run to the stand. Opposite is the
church with the clock upon it, as everybody knows, and at sight of
the dial my companion had wrung his hands; it was close upon the
half-hour.</p>

<p>"Poco tempo&mdash;pochissimo!" he wailed. "Bloom-buree
Ske-warr," he then cried to the cabman&mdash;"numero
trentotto!"</p>

<p>"Bloomsbury Square," I roared on my own account, "I'll show you
the house when we get there, only drive like be-damned!"</p>

<p>My companion lay back gasping in his corner. The small glass
told me that my own face was pretty red.</p>

<p>"A nice show!" I cried; "and not a word can you tell me. Didn't
you bring me a note?"</p>

<p>I might have known by this time that he had not, still I went
through the pantomime of writing with my finger on my cuff. But he
shrugged and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Niente," said he. "Una quistione di vita, di vita!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" I snapped, my early training come in again. "Say
it slowly&mdash;andante&mdash;rallentando."</p>

<p>Thank Italy for the stage instructions in the songs one used to
murder! The fellow actually understood.</p>

<p>"Una&mdash;quistione&mdash;di&mdash;vita."</p>

<p>"Or mors, eh?" I shouted, and up went the trap-door over our
heads.</p>

<p>"Avanti, avanti, avanti!" cried the Italian, turning up his
one-eyed face.</p>

<p>"Hell-to-leather," I translated, "and double fare if you do it
by twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>But in the streets of London how is one to know the time? In the
Earl's Court Road it had not been half-past, and at Barker's in
High Street it was but a minute later. A long half-mile a minute,
that was going like the wind, and indeed we had done much of it at
a gallop. But the next hundred yards took us five minutes by the
next clock, and which was one to believe? I fell back upon my own
old watch (it was my own), which made it eighteen minutes to the
hour as we swung across the Serpentine bridge, and by the quarter
we were in the Bayswater Road&mdash;not up for once.</p>

<p>"Presto, presto," my pale guide murmured.
"Affretatevi&mdash;avanti!"</p>

<p>"Ten bob if you do it," I cried through the trap, without the
slightest notion of what we were to do. But it was "una quistione
di vita," and "vostro amico" must and could only be my miserable
Raffles.</p>

<p>What a very godsend is the perfect hansom to the man or woman in
a hurry! It had been our great good fortune to jump into a perfect
hansom; there was no choice, we had to take the first upon the
rank, but it must have deserved its place with the rest nowhere.
New tires, superb springs, a horse in a thousand, and a driver up
to every trick of his trade! In and out we went like a fast
half-back at the Rugby game, yet where the traffic was thinnest,
there were we. And how he knew his way! At the Marble Arch he
slipped out of the main stream, and so into Wigmore Street, then up
and in and out and on until I saw the gold tips of the Museum
palisade gleaming between the horse's ears in the sun. Plop, plop,
plop; ting, ling, ling; bell and horse-shoes, horse-shoes and bell,
until the colossal figure of C. J. Fox in a grimy toga spelt
Bloomsbury Square with my watch still wanting three minutes to the
hour.</p>

<p>"What number?" cried the good fellow over-head.</p>

<p>"Trentotto, trentotto," said my guide, but he was looking to the
right, and I bundled him out to show the house on foot. I had not
half-a-sovereign after all, but I flung our dear driver a whole one
instead, and only wish that it had been a hundred.</p>

<p>Already the Italian had his latch-key in the door of 38, and in
another moment we were rushing up the narrow stairs of as dingy a
London house as prejudiced countryman can conceive. It was
panelled, but it was dark and evil-smelling, and how we should have
found our way even to the stairs but for an unwholesome jet of
yellow gas in the hall, I cannot myself imagine. However, up we
went pell-mell, to the right-about on the half-landing, and so like
a whirlwind into the drawing-room a few steps higher. There the gas
was also burning behind closed shutters, and the scene is
photographed upon my brain, though I cannot have looked upon it for
a whole instant as I sprang in at my leader's heels.</p>

<p>This room also was panelled, and in the middle of the wall on
our left, his hands lashed to a ring-bolt high above his head, his
toes barely touching the floor, his neck pinioned by a strap
passing through smaller ring-bolts under either ear, and every inch
of him secured on the same principle, stood, or rather hung, all
that was left of Raffles, for at the first glance I believed him
dead. A black ruler gagged him, the ends lashed behind his neck,
the blood upon it caked to bronze in the gaslight. And in front of
him, ticking like a sledge-hammer, its only hand upon the stroke of
twelve, stood a simple, old-fashioned, grandfather's
clock&mdash;but not for half an instant longer&mdash;only until my
guide could hurl himself upon it and send the whole thing crashing
into the corner. An ear-splitting report accompanied the crash, a
white cloud lifted from the fallen clock, and I saw a revolver
smoking in a vice screwed below the dial, an arrangement of wires
sprouting from the dial itself, and the single hand at once at its
zenith and in contact with these.</p>

<p>"Tumble to it, Bunny?"</p>

<p>He was alive; these were his first words; the Italian had the
blood-caked ruler in his hand, and with his knife was reaching up
to cut the thongs that lashed the hands. He was not tall enough, I
seized him and lifted him up, then fell to work with my own knife
upon the straps. And Raffles smiled faintly upon us through his
blood-stains.</p>

<p>"I want you to tumble to it," he whispered; "the neatest thing
in revenge I ever knew, and another minute would have fixed it.
I've been waiting for it twelve hours, watching the clock round,
death at the end of the lap! Electric connection. Simple enough.
Hour-hand only&mdash;O Lord!"</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page130.jpg" alt=""
width="502" height="750">
</p>

<p>We had cut the last strap. He could not stand. We supported him
between us to a horsehair sofa, for the room was furnished, and I
begged him not to speak, while his one-eyed deliverer was at the
door before Raffles recalled him with a sharp word in Italian.</p>

<p>"He wants to get me a drink, but that can wait," said he, in
firmer voice; "I shall enjoy it the more when I've told you what
happened. Don't let him go, Bunny; put your back against the door.
He's a decent soul, and it's lucky for me I got a word with him
before they trussed me up. I've promised to set him up in life, and
I will, but I don't want him out of my sight for the moment."</p>

<p>"If you squared him last night," I exclaimed, "why the blazes
didn't he come to me till the eleventh hour?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew he'd have to cut it fine though I hoped not quite so
fine as all that. But all's well that ends well, and I declare I
don't feel so much the worse. I shall be sore about the gills for a
bit&mdash;and what do you think?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the long black ruler with the bronze stain; it lay
upon the floor; he held out his hand for it, and I gave it to
him.</p>

<p>"The same one I gagged him with," said Raffles, with his still
ghastly smile; "he was a bit of an artist, old Corbucci, after
all!"</p>

<p>"Now let's hear how you fell into his clutches," said I,
briskly, for I was as anxious to hear as he seemed to tell me, only
for my part I could have waited until we were safe in the flat.</p>

<p>"I do want to get it off my chest, Bunny," old Raffles admitted,
"and yet I hardly can tell you after all. I followed your friend
with the velvet eyes. I followed him all the way here. Of course I
came up to have a good look at the house when he'd let himself in,
and damme if he hadn't left the door ajar! Who could resist that? I
had pushed it half open and had just one foot on the mat when I got
such a crack on the head as I hope never to get again. When I came
to my wits they were hauling me up to that ring-bolt by the hands,
and old Corbucci himself was bowing to me, but how <i>he</i> got
here I don't know yet."</p>

<p>"I can tell you that," said I, and told how I had seen the Count
for myself on the pavement underneath our windows. "Moreover," I
continued, "I saw him spot you, and five minutes after in Earl's
Court Road I was told he'd driven off in a cab. He would see you
following his man, drive home ahead, and catch you by having the
door left open in the way you describe."</p>

<p>"Well," said Raffles, "he deserved to catch me somehow, for he'd
come from Naples on purpose, ruler and all, and the ring-bolts were
ready fixed, and even this house taken furnished for nothing else!
He meant catching me before he'd done, and scoring me off in
exactly the same way that I scored off him, only going one better
of course. He told me so himself, sitting where I am sitting now,
at three o'clock this morning, and smoking a most abominable cigar
that I've smelt ever since. It appears he sat twenty-four hours
when I left <i>him</i> trussed up, but he said twelve would content
him in my case, as there was certain death at the end of them, and
I mightn't have life enough left to appreciate my end if he made it
longer. But I wouldn't have trusted him if he could have got the
clock to go twice round without firing off the pistol. He explained
the whole mechanism of that to me; he had thought it all out on the
vineyard I told you about; and then he asked if I remembered what
he had promised me in the name of the Camorra. I only remembered
some vague threats, but he was good enough to give me so many
particulars of that institution that I could make a European
reputation by exposing the whole show if it wasn't for my
unfortunate resemblance to that infernal rascal Raffles. Do you
think they would know me at the Yard, Bunny, after all this time?
Upon my soul I've a good mind to risk it!"</p>

<p>I offered no opinion on the point. How could it interest me
then? But interested I was in Raffles, never more so in my life. He
had been tortured all night and half a day, yet he could sit and
talk like this the moment we cut him down; he had been within a
minute of his death, yet he was as full of life as ever;
ill-treated and defeated at the best, he could still smile through
his blood as though the boot were on the other leg. I had imagined
that I knew my Raffles at last. I was not likely so to flatter
myself again.</p>

<p>"But what has happened to these villains?" I burst out, and my
indignation was not only against them for their cruelty, but also
against their victim for his phlegmatic attitude toward them. It
was difficult to believe that this was Raffles.</p>

<p>"Oh," said he, "they were to go off to Italy <i>instanter</i>;
they should be crossing now. But do listen to what I am telling
you; it's interesting, my dear man. This old sinner Corbucci turns
out to have been no end of a boss in the Camorra&mdash;says so
himself. One of the capi paranze, my boy, no less; and the velvety
Johnny a giovano onorato, Anglice, fresher. This fellow here was
also in it, and I've sworn to protect him from them evermore; and
it's just as I said, half the organ-grinders in London belong, and
the whole lot of them were put on my tracks by secret instructions.
This excellent youth manufactures iced poison on Saffron Hill when
he's at home."</p>

<p>"And why on earth didn't he come to me quicker?"</p>

<p>"Because he couldn't talk to you, he could only fetch you, and
it was as much as his life was worth to do that before our friends
had departed. They were going by the eleven o'clock from Victoria,
and that didn't leave much chance, but he certainly oughtn't to
have run it as fine as he did. Still you must remember that I had
to fix things up with him in the fewest possible words, in a single
minute that the other two were indiscreet enough to leave us alone
together."</p>

<p>The ragamuffin in question was watching us with all his solitary
eye, as though he knew that we were discussing him. Suddenly he
broke out in agonized accents, his hands clasped, and a face so
full of fear that every moment I expected to see him on his knees.
But Raffles answered kindly, reassuringly, I could tell from his
tone, and then turned to me with a compassionate shrug.</p>

<p>"He says he couldn't find the mansions, Bunny, and really it's
not to be wondered at. I had only time to tell him to hunt you up
and bring you here by hook or crook before twelve to-day, and after
all he has done that. But now the poor devil thinks you're riled
with him, and that we'll give him away to the Camorra."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not with him I'm riled," I said frankly, "but with
those other blackguards, and&mdash;and with you, old chap, for
taking it all as you do, while such infamous scoundrels have the
last laugh, and are safely on their way to France!"</p>

<p>Raffles looked up at me with a curiously open eye, an eye that I
never saw when he was not in earnest. I fancied he did not like my
last expression but one. After all, it was no laughing matter to
him.</p>

<p>"But are they?" said he. "I'm not so sure."</p>

<p>"You said they were!"</p>

<p>"I said they should be."</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear them go?"</p>

<p>"I heard nothing but the clock all night. It was like Big Ben
striking at the last&mdash;striking nine to the fellow on the
drop."</p>

<p>And in that open eye I saw at last a deep glimmer of the ordeal
through which he had passed.</p>

<p>"But, my dear old Raffles, if they're still on the
premises&mdash;"</p>

<p>The thought was too thrilling for a finished sentence.</p>

<p>"I hope they are," he said grimly, going to the door. "There's a
gas on! Was that burning when you came in?"</p>

<p>Now that I thought of it, yes, it had been.</p>

<p>"And there's a frightfully foul smell," I added, as I followed
Raffles down the stairs. He turned to me gravely with his hand upon
the front-room door, and at the same moment I saw a coat with an
astrakhan collar hanging on the pegs.</p>

<p>"They are in here, Bunny," he said, and turned the handle.</p>

<p>The door would only open a few inches. But a detestable odor
came out, with a broad bar of yellow gaslight. Raffles put his
handkerchief to his nose. I followed his example, signing to our
ally to do the same, and in another minute we had all three
squeezed into the room.</p>

<p>The man with the yellow boots was lying against the door, the
Count's great carcass sprawled upon the table, and at a glance it
was evident that both men had been dead some hours. The old
Camorrist had the stem of a liqueur-glass between his swollen blue
fingers, one of which had been cut in the breakage, and the livid
flesh was also brown with the last blood that it would ever shed.
His face was on the table, the huge moustache projecting from under
either leaden cheek, yet looking itself strangely alive. Broken
bread and scraps of frozen macaroni lay upon the cloth and at the
bottom of two soup-plates and a tureen; the macaroni had a tinge of
tomato; and there was a crimson dram left in the tumblers, with an
empty fiasco to show whence it came. But near the great gray head
upon the table another liqueur-glass stood, unbroken, and still
full of some white and stinking liquid; and near that a tiny silver
flask, which made me recoil from Raffles as I had not from the
dead; for I knew it to be his.</p>

<p>"Come out of this poisonous air," he said sternly, "and I will
tell you how it has happened."</p>

<p>So we all three gathered together in the hall. But it was
Raffles who stood nearest the street-door, his back to it, his eyes
upon us two. And though it was to me only that he spoke at first,
he would pause from point to point, and translate into Italian for
the benefit of the one-eyed alien to whom he owed his life.</p>

<p>"You probably don't even know the name, Bunny," he began, "of
the deadliest poison yet known to science. It is cyanide of
cacodyl, and I have carried that small flask of it about with me
for months. Where I got it matters nothing; the whole point is that
a mere sniff reduces flesh to clay. I have never had any opinion of
suicide, as you know, but I always felt it worth while to be
forearmed against the very worst. Well, a bottle of this stuff is
calculated to stiffen an ordinary roomful of ordinary people within
five minutes; and I remembered my flask when they had me as good as
crucified in the small hours of this morning. I asked them to take
it out of my pocket. I begged them to give me a drink before they
left me. And what do you suppose they did?"</p>

<p>I thought of many things but suggested none, while Raffles
turned this much of his statement into sufficiently fluent Italian.
But when he faced me again his face was still flaming.</p>

<p>"That beast Corbucci!" said he&mdash;"how can I pity him? He
took the flask; he would give me none; he flicked me in the face
instead. My idea was that he, at least, should go with me&mdash;to
sell my life as dearly as that&mdash;and a sniff would have settled
us both. But no, he must tantalize and torment me; he thought it
brandy; he must take it downstairs to drink to my destruction! Can
you have any pity for a hound like that?"</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page140.jpg" alt=""
width="552" height="750">
</p>

<p>"Let us go," I at last said, hoarsely, as Raffles finished
speaking in Italian, and his second listener stood
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"We will go," said Raffles, "and we will chance being seen; if
the worst comes to the worst this good chap will prove that I have
been tied up since one o'clock this morning, and the medical
evidence will decide how long those dogs have been dead."</p>

<p>But the worst did not come to the worst, more power to my
unforgotten friend the cabman, who never came forward to say what
manner of men he had driven to Bloomsbury Square at top speed on
the very day upon which the tragedy was discovered there, or whence
he had driven them. To be sure, they had not behaved like
murderers, whereas the evidence at the inquest all went to show
that the defunct Corbucci was little better. His reputation, which
transpired with his identity, was that of a libertine and a
renegade, while the infernal apparatus upstairs revealed the
fiendish arts of the anarchist to boot. The inquiry resulted
eventually in an open verdict, and was chiefly instrumental in
killing such compassion as is usually felt for the dead who die in
their sins.</p>

<p>But Raffles would not have passed this title for this tale.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ToCatchAThief" id=
"ToCatchAThief"></a>To Catch A Thief</b>
</h2>

<p align="center"><b>1</b>
</p>

<p>Society persons are not likely to have forgotten the series of
audacious robberies by which so many of themselves suffered in turn
during the brief course of a recent season. Raid after raid was
made upon the smartest houses in town, and within a few weeks more
than one exalted head had been shorn of its priceless tiara. The
Duke and Duchess of Dorchester lost half the portable pieces of
their historic plate on the very night of their Graces' almost
equally historic costume ball. The Kenworthy diamonds were taken in
broad daylight, during the excitement of a charitable meeting on
the ground floor, and the gifts of her belted bridegroom to Lady
May Paulton while the outer air was thick with a prismatic shower
of confetti. It was obvious that all this was the work of no
ordinary thief, and perhaps inevitable that the name of Raffles
should have been dragged from oblivion by callous disrespecters of
the departed and unreasoning apologists for the police. These
wiseacres did not hesitate to bring a dead man back to life because
they knew of no living one capable of such feats; it is their
heedless and inconsequent calumnies that the present paper is
partly intended to refute. As a matter of fact, our joint innocence
in this matter was only exceeded by our common envy, and for a long
time, like the rest of the world, neither of us had the slightest
clew to the identity of the person who was following in our steps
with such irritating results.</p>

<p>"I should mind less," said Raffles, "if the fellow were really
playing my game. But abuse of hospitality was never one of my
strokes, and it seems to me the only shot he's got. When we took
old Lady Melrose's necklace, Bunny, we were not staying with the
Melroses, if you recollect."</p>

<p>We were discussing the robberies for the hundredth time, but for
once under conditions more favorable to animated conversation than
our unique circumstances permitted in the flat. We did not often
dine out. Dr. Theobald was one impediment, the risk of recognition
was another. But there were exceptions, when the doctor was away or
the patient defiant, and on these rare occasions we frequented a
certain unpretentious restaurant in the Fulham quarter, where the
cooking was plain but excellent, and the cellar a surprise. Our
bottle of '89 champagne was empty to the label when the subject
arose, to be touched by Raffles in the reminiscent manner indicated
above. I can see his clear eye upon me now, reading me, weighing
me. But I was not so sensitive to his scrutiny at the time. His
tone was deliberate, calculating, preparatory; not as I heard it
then, through a head full of wine, but as it floats back to me
across the gulf between that moment and this.</p>

<p>"Excellent fillet!" said I, grossly. "So you think this chap is
as much in society as we were, do you?"</p>

<p>I preferred not to think so myself. We had cause enough for
jealousy without that. But Raffles raised his eyebrows an eloquent
half-inch.</p>

<p>"As much, my dear Bunny? He is not only in it, but of it;
there's no comparison between us there. Society is in rings like a
target, and we never were in the bull's-eye, however thick you may
lay on the ink! I was asked for my cricket. I haven't forgotten it
yet. But this fellow's one of themselves, with the right of entre
into the houses which we could only 'enter' in a professional
sense. That's obvious unless all these little exploits are the work
of different hands, which they as obviously are not. And it's why
I'd give five hundred pounds to put salt on him to-night!"</p>

<p>"Not you," said I, as I drained my glass in festive
incredulity.</p>

<p>"But I would, my dear Bunny. Waiter! another half-bottle of
this," and Raffles leant across the table as the empty one was
taken away. "I never was more serious in my life," he continued
below his breath. "Whatever else our successor may be, he's not a
dead man like me, or a marked man like you. If there's any truth in
my theory he's one of the last people upon whom suspicion is ever
likely to rest; and oh, Bunny, what a partner he would make for you
and me!"</p>

<p>Under less genial influences the very idea of a third partner
would have filled my soul with offence; but Raffles had chosen his
moment unerringly, and his arguments lost nothing by the flowing
accompaniment of the extra pint. They were, however, quite strong
in themselves. The gist of them was that thus far we had remarkably
little to show for what Raffles would call "our second innings".
This even I could not deny. We had scored a few "long singles", but
our "best shots" had gone "straight to hand", and we were "playing
a deuced slow game". Therefore we needed a new partner&mdash;and
the metaphor failed Raffles.</p>

<p>It had served its turn. I already agreed with him. In truth I
was tired of my false position as hireling attendant, and had long
fancied myself an object of suspicion to that other impostor the
doctor. A fresh, untrammelled start was a fascinating idea to me,
though two was company, and three in our case might be worse than
none. But I did not see how we could hope, with our respective
handicaps, to solve a problem which was already the despair of
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"Suppose I have solved it," observed Raffles, cracking a walnut
in his palm.</p>

<p>"How could you?" I asked, without believing for an instant that
he had.</p>

<p>"I have been taking the <i>Morning Post</i> for some time
now."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You have got me a good many odd numbers of the less base
society papers."</p>

<p>"I can't for the life of me see what you're driving at."</p>

<p>Raffles smiled indulgently as he cracked another nut.</p>

<p>"That's because you've neither observation nor imagination,
Bunny&mdash;and yet you try to write! Well, you wouldn't think it,
but I have a fairly complete list of the people who were at the
various functions under cover of which these different little coups
were brought off."</p>

<p>I said very stolidly that I did not see how that could help him.
It was the only answer to his good-humored but self-satisfied
contempt; it happened also to be true.</p>

<p>"Think," said Raffles, in a patient voice.</p>

<p>"When thieves break in and steal," said I, "upstairs, I don't
see much point in discovering who was downstairs at the time."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Raffles&mdash;"when they do break in."</p>

<p>"But that's what they have done in all these cases. An upstairs
door found screwed up, when things were at their height below;
thief gone and jewels with him before alarm could be raised. Why,
the trick's so old that I never knew you condescend to play
it."</p>

<p>"Not so old as it looks," said Raffles, choosing the cigars and
handing me mine. "Cognac or Benedictine, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"Brandy," I said, coarsely.</p>

<p>"Besides," he went on, "the rooms were not screwed up; at
Dorchester House, at any rate, the door was only locked, and the
key missing, so that it might have been done on either side."</p>

<p>"But that was where he left his rope-ladder behind him!" I
exclaimed in triumph; but Raffles only shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in that rope-ladder, Bunny, except as a
blind."</p>

<p>"Then what on earth do you believe?"</p>

<p>"That every one of these so-called burglaries has been done from
the inside, by one of the guests; and what's more I'm very much
mistaken if I haven't spotted the right sportsman."</p>

<p>I began to believe that he really had, there was such a wicked
gravity in the eyes that twinkled faintly into mine. I raised my
glass in convivial congratulation, and still remember the somewhat
anxious eye with which Raffles saw it emptied.</p>

<p>"I can only find one likely name," he continued, "that figures
in all these lists, and it is anything but a likely one at first
sight. Lord Ernest Belville was at all those functions. Know
anything about him, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"Not the Rational Drink fanatic?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's all I want to know."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Raffles; "and yet what could be more promising? A
man whose views are so broad and moderate, and so widely held
already (saving your presence, Bunny), does not bore the world with
them without ulterior motives. So far so good. What are this chap's
motives? Does he want to advertise himself? No, he's somebody
already. But is he rich? On the contrary, he's as poor as a rat for
his position, and apparently without the least ambition to be
anything else; certainly he won't enrich himself by making a public
fad of what all sensible people are agreed upon as it is. Then
suddenly one gets one's own old idea&mdash;the alternative
profession! My cricket&mdash;his Rational Drink! But it is no use
jumping to conclusions. I must know more than the newspapers can
tell me. Our aristocratic friend is forty, and unmarried. What has
he been doing all these years? How the devil was I to find
out?"</p>

<p>"How did you?" I asked, declining to spoil my digestion with a
conundrum, as it was his evident intention that I should.</p>

<p>"Interviewed him!" said Raffles, smiling slowly on my
amazement.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;interviewed him?" I echoed. "When&mdash;and
where?"</p>

<p>"Last Thursday night, when, if you remember, we kept early
hours, because I felt done. What was the use of telling you what I
had up my sleeve, Bunny? It might have ended in a fizzle, as it
still may. But Lord Ernest Belville was addressing the meeting at
Exeter Hall; I waited for him when the show was over, dogged him
home to King John's Mansions, and interviewed him in his own rooms
there before he turned in."</p>

<p>My journalistic jealousy was piqued to the quick. Affecting a
scepticism I did not feel (for no outrage was beyond the pale of
his impudence), I inquired dryly which journal Raffles had
pretended to represent. It is unnecessary to report his answer. I
could not believe him without further explanation.</p>

<p>"I should have thought," he said, "that even you would have
spotted a practice I never omit upon certain occasions. I always
pay a visit to the drawing-room, and fill my waistcoat pocket from
the card-tray. It is an immense help in any little temporary
impersonation. On Thursday night I sent up the card of a powerful
writer connected with a powerful paper; if Lord Ernest had known
him in the flesh I should have been obliged to confess to a
journalistic ruse; luckily he didn't&mdash;and I had been sent by
my editor to get the interview for next morning. What could be
better&mdash;for the alternative profession?"</p>

<p>I inquired what the interview had brought forth.</p>

<p>"Everything," said Raffles. "Lord Ernest has been a wanderer
these twenty years. Texas, Fiji, Australia. I suspect him of wives
and families in all three. But his manners are a liberal education.
He gave me some beautiful whiskey, and forgot all about his fad. He
is strong and subtle, but I talked him off his guard. He is going
to the Kirkleathams' to-night&mdash;I saw the card stuck up. I
stuck some wax into his keyhole as he was switching off the
lights."</p>

<p>And, with an eye upon the waiters, Raffles showed me a skeleton
key, newly twisted and filed; but my share of the extra pint (I am
afraid no fair share) had made me dense. I looked from the key to
Raffles with puckered forehead&mdash;for I happened to catch sight
of it in the mirror behind him.</p>

<p>"The Dowager Lady Kirkleatham," he whispered, "has diamonds as
big as beans, and likes to have 'em all on&mdash;and goes to bed
early&mdash;and happens to be in town!"</p>

<p>And now I saw.</p>

<p>"The villain means to get them from her!"</p>

<p>"And I mean to get them from the villain," said Raffles; "or,
rather, your share and mine."</p>

<p>"Will he consent to a partnership?"</p>

<p>"We shall have him at our mercy. He daren't refuse."</p>

<p>Raffles's plan was to gain access to Lord Ernest's rooms before
midnight; there we were to lie in wait for the aristocratic rascal,
and if I left all details to Raffles, and simply stood by in case
of a rumpus, I should be playing my part and earning my share. It
was a part that I had played before, not always with a good grace,
though there had never been any question about the share. But
to-night I was nothing loath. I had had just champagne
enough&mdash;how Raffles knew my measure!&mdash;and I was ready and
eager for anything. Indeed, I did not wish to wait for the coffee,
which was to be especially strong by order of Raffles. But on that
he insisted, and it was between ten and eleven when at last we were
in our cab.</p>

<p>"It would be fatal to be too early," he said as we drove; "on
the other hand, it would be dangerous to leave it too late. One
must risk something. How I should love to drive down Piccadilly and
see the lights! But unnecessary risks are another story."</p>

<p align="center"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>King John's Mansions, as everybody knows, are the oldest, the
ugliest, and the tallest block of flats in all London. But they are
built upon a more generous scale than has since become the rule,
and with a less studious regard for the economy of space. We were
about to drive into the spacious courtyard when the gate-keeper
checked us in order to let another hansom drive out.</p>

<p>It contained a middle-aged man of the military type, like
ourselves in evening dress. That much I saw as his hansom crossed
our bows, because I could not help seeing it, but I should not have
given the incident a second thought if it had not been for his
extraordinary effect upon Raffles. In an instant he was out upon
the curb, paying the cabby, and in another he was leading me across
the street, away from the mansions.</p>

<p>"Where on earth are you going?" I naturally exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Into the park," said he. "We are too early."</p>

<p>His voice told me more than his words. It was strangely
stern.</p>

<p>"Was that him&mdash;in the hansom?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the coast's clear," said I, comfortably. I was for
turning back then and there, but Raffles forced me on with a hand
that hardened on my arm.</p>

<p>"It was a nearer thing than I care about," said he. "This seat
will do; no, the next one's further from a lamp-post. We will give
him a good half-hour, and I don't want to talk."</p>

<p>We had been seated some minutes when Big Ben sent a languid
chime over our heads to the stars. It was half-past ten, and a
sultry night. Eleven had struck before Raffles awoke from his
sullen reverie, and recalled me from mine with a slap on the back.
In a couple of minutes we were in the lighted vestibule at the
inner end of the courtyard of King John's Mansions.</p>

<p>"Just left Lord Ernest at Lady Kirkleatham's," said Raffles.
"Gave me his key and asked us to wait for him in his rooms. Will
you send us up in the lift?"</p>

<p>In a small way, I never knew old Raffles do anything better.
There was not an instant's demur. Lord Ernest Belville's rooms were
at the top of the building, but we were in them as quickly as lift
could carry and page-boy conduct us. And there was no need for the
skeleton key after all; the boy opened the outer door with one of
his own, and switched on the lights before leaving us.</p>

<p>"Now that's interesting," said Raffles, as soon as we were
alone; "they can come in and clean when he is out. What if he keeps
his swag at the bank? By Jove, that's an idea for him! I don't
believe he's getting rid of it; it's all lying low somewhere, if
I'm not mistaken, and he's not a fool."</p>

<p>While he spoke he was moving about the sitting-room, which was
charmingly furnished in the antique style, and making as many
remarks as though he were an auctioneer's clerk with an inventory
to prepare and a day to do it in, instead of a cracksman who might
be surprised in his crib at any moment.</p>

<p>"Chippendale of sorts, eh, Bunny? Not genuine, of course; but
where can you get genuine Chippendale now, and who knows it when
they see it? There's no merit in mere antiquity. Yet the way people
pose on the subject! If a thing's handsome and useful, and good
cabinet-making, it's good enough for me."</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better explore the whole place?" I suggested
nervously. He had not even bolted the outer door. Nor would he when
I called his attention to the omission.</p>

<p>"If Lord Ernest finds his rooms locked up he'll raise Cain,"
said Raffles; "we must let him come in and lock up for himself
before we corner him. But he won't come yet; if he did it might be
awkward, for they'd tell him down below what I told them. A new
staff comes on at midnight. I discovered that the other night."</p>

<p>"Supposing he does come in before?"</p>

<p>"Well, he can't have us turned out without first seeing who we
are, and he won't try it on when I've had one word with him. Unless
my suspicions are unfounded, I mean."</p>

<p>"Isn't it about time to test them?"</p>

<p>"My good Bunny, what do you suppose I've been doing all this
while? He keeps nothing in here. There isn't a lock to the
Chippendale that you couldn't pick with a penknife, and not a loose
board in the floor, for I was treading for one before the boy left
us. Chimney's no use in a place like this where they keep them
swept for you. Yes, I'm quite ready to try his bedroom."</p>

<p>There was but a bathroom besides; no kitchen, no servant's room;
neither are necessary in King John's Mansions. I thought it as well
to put my head inside the bathroom while Raffles went into the
bedroom, for I was tormented by the horrible idea that the man
might all this time be concealed somewhere in the flat. But the
bathroom blazed void in the electric light. I found Raffles hanging
out of the starry square which was the bedroom window, for the room
was still in darkness. I felt for the switch at the door.</p>

<p>"Put it out again!" said Raffles fiercely. He rose from the
sill, drew blind and curtains carefully, then switched on the light
himself. It fell upon a face creased more in pity than in anger,
and Raffles only shook his head as I hung mine.</p>

<p>"It's all right, old boy," said he; "but corridors have windows
too, and servants have eyes; and you and I are supposed to be in
the other room, not in this. But cheer up, Bunny! This is
<i>the</i> room; look at the extra bolt on the door; he's had that
put on, and there's an iron ladder to his window in case of fire!
Way of escape ready against the hour of need; he's a better man
than I thought him, Bunny, after all. But you may bet your bottom
dollar that if there's any boodle in the flat it's in this
room."</p>

<p>Yet the room was very lightly furnished; and nothing was locked.
We looked everywhere, but we looked in vain. The wardrobe was
filled with hanging coats and trousers in a press, the drawers with
the softest silk and finest linen. It was a camp bedstead that
would not have unsettled an anchorite; there was no place for
treasure there. I looked up the chimney, but Raffles told me not to
be a fool, and asked if I ever listened to what he said. There was
no question about his temper now. I never knew him in a worse.</p>

<p>"Then he has got it in the bank," he growled. "I'll swear I'm
not mistaken in my man!"</p>

<p>I had the tact not to differ with him there. But I could not
help suggesting that now was our time to remedy any mistake we
might have made. We were on the right side of midnight still.</p>

<p>"Then we stultify ourselves downstairs," said Raffles. "No, I'll
be shot if I do! He may come in with the Kirkleatham diamonds! You
do what you like, Bunny, but I don't budge."</p>

<p>"I certainly shan't leave you," I retorted, "to be knocked into
the middle of next week by a better man than yourself."</p>

<p>I had borrowed his own tone, and he did not like it. They never
do. I thought for a moment that Raffles was going to strike
me&mdash;for the first and last time in his life. He could if he
liked. My blood was up. I was ready to send him to the devil. And I
emphasized my offence by nodding and shrugging toward a pair of
very large Indian clubs that stood in the fender, on either side of
the chimney up which I had presumed to glance.</p>

<p>In an instant Raffles had seized the clubs, and was whirling
them about his gray head in a mixture of childish pique and puerile
bravado which I should have thought him altogether above.</p>

<p>And suddenly as I watched him his face changed, softened, lit
up, and he swung the clubs gently down upon the bed.</p>

<p>"They're not heavy enough for their size," said he rapidly; "and
I'll take my oath they're not the same weight!"</p>

<p>He shook one club after the other, with both hands, close to his
ear; then he examined their butt-ends under the electric light. I
saw what he suspected now, and caught the contagion of his
suppressed excitement. Neither of us spoke. But Raffles had taken
out the portable tool-box that he called a knife, and always
carried, and as he opened the gimlet he handed me the club he held.
Instinctively I tucked the small end under my arm, and presented
the other to Raffles.</p>

<p>"Hold him tight," he whispered, smiling. "He's not only a better
man than I thought him, Bunny; he's hit upon a better dodge than
ever I did, of its kind. Only I should have weighted them
evenly&mdash;to a hair."</p>

<p>He had screwed the gimlet into the circular butt, close to the
edge, and now we were wrenching in opposite directions. For a
moment or more nothing happened. Then all at once something gave,
and Raffles swore an oath as soft as any prayer. And for the minute
after that his hand went round and round with the gimlet, as though
he were grinding a piano-organ, while the end wormed slowly out on
its delicate thread of fine hard wood.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page162.jpg" width="591"
alt="" height="750">
</p>

<p>The clubs were as hollow as drinking-horns, the pair of them,
for we went from one to the other without pausing to undo the
padded packets that poured out upon the bed. These were deliciously
heavy to the hand, yet thickly swathed in cotton-wool, so that some
stuck together, retaining the shape of the cavity, as though they
had been run out of a mould. And when we did open them&mdash;but
let Raffles speak.</p>

<p>He had deputed me to screw in the ends of the clubs, and to
replace the latter in the fender where we had found them. When I
had done the counterpane was glittering with diamonds where it was
not shimmering with pearls.</p>

<p>"If this isn't that tiara that Lady May was married in," said
Raffles, "and that disappeared out of the room she changed in,
while it rained confetti on the steps, I'll present it to her
instead of the one she lost.... It was stupid to keep these old
gold spoons, valuable as they are; they made the difference in the
weight.... Here we have probably the Kenworthy diamonds.... I don't
know the history of these pearls.... This looks like one family of
rings&mdash;left on the basin-stand, perhaps&mdash;alas, poor lady!
And that's the lot."</p>

<p>Our eyes met across the bed.</p>

<p>"What's it all worth?" I asked, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Impossible to say. But more than all we ever took in all our
lives. That I'll swear to."</p>

<p>"More than all&mdash;"</p>

<p>My tongue swelled with the thought.</p>

<p>"But it'll take some turning into cash, old chap!"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;must it be a partnership?" I asked, finding a
lugubrious voice at length.</p>

<p>"Partnership be damned!" cried Raffles, heartily. "Let's get out
quicker than we came in."</p>

<p>We pocketed the things between us, cotton-wool and all, not
because we wanted the latter, but to remove all immediate traces of
our really meritorious deed.</p>

<p>"The sinner won't dare to say a word when he does find out,"
remarked Raffles of Lord Ernest; "but that's no reason why he
should find out before he must. Everything's straight in here, I
think; no, better leave the window open as it was, and the blind
up. Now out with the light. One peep at the other room. That's all
right, too. Out with the passage light, Bunny, while I
open&mdash;"</p>

<p>His words died away in a whisper. A key was fumbling at the lock
outside.</p>

<p>"Out with it&mdash;out with it!" whispered Raffles in an agony;
and as I obeyed he picked me off my feet and swung me bodily but
silently into the bedroom, just as the outer door opened, and a
masterful step strode in.</p>

<p>The next five were horrible minutes. We heard the apostle of
Rational Drink unlock one of the deep drawers in his antique
sideboard, and sounds followed suspiciously like the splash of
spirits and the steady stream from a siphon. Never before or since
did I experience such a thirst as assailed me at that moment, nor
do I believe that many tropical explorers have known its equal. But
I had Raffles with me, and his hand was as steady and as cool as
the hand of a trained nurse. That I know because he turned up the
collar of my overcoat for me, for some reason, and buttoned it at
the throat. I afterwards found that he had done the same to his
own, but I did not hear him doing it. The one thing I heard in the
bedroom was a tiny metallic click, muffled and deadened in his
overcoat pocket, and it not only removed my last tremor, but strung
me to a higher pitch of excitement than ever. Yet I had then no
conception of the game that Raffles was deciding to play, and that
I was to play with him in another minute.</p>

<p>It cannot have been longer before Lord Ernest came into his
bedroom. Heavens, but my heart had not forgotten how to thump! We
were standing near the door, and I could swear he touched me; then
his boots creaked, there was a rattle in the fender&mdash;and
Raffles switched on the light.</p>

<p>Lord Ernest Belville crouched in its glare with one Indian club
held by the end, like a footman with a stolen bottle. A
good-looking, well-built, iron-gray, iron-jawed man; but a fool and
a weakling at that moment, if he had never been either before.</p>

<p>"Lord Ernest Belville," said Raffles, "it's no use. This is a
loaded revolver, and if you force me I shall use it on you as I
would on any other desperate criminal. I am here to arrest you for
a series of robberies at the Duke of Dorchester's, Sir John
Kenworthy's, and other noblemen's and gentlemen's houses during the
present season. You'd better drop what you've got in your hand.
It's empty."</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page168.jpg" alt=""
width="535" height="750">
</p>

<p>Lord Ernest lifted the club an inch or two, and with it his
eyebrows&mdash;and after it his stalwart frame as the club crashed
back into the fender. And as he stood at his full height, a
courteous but ironic smile under the cropped moustache, he looked
what he was, criminal or not.</p>

<p>"Scotland Yard?" said he.</p>

<p>"That's our affair, my lord."</p>

<p>"I didn't think they'd got it in them," said Lord Ernest. "Now I
recognize you. You're my interviewer. No, I didn't think any of you
fellows had got all that in you. Come into the other room, and I'll
show you something else. Oh, keep me covered by all means. But look
at this!"</p>

<p>On the antique sideboard, their size doubled by reflection in
the polished mahogany, lay a coruscating cluster of precious
stones, that fell in festoons about Lord Ernest's fingers as he
handed them to Raffles with scarcely a shrug.</p>

<p>"The Kirkleatham diamonds," said he. "Better add 'em to the
bag."</p>

<p>Raffles did so without a smile; with his overcoat buttoned up to
the chin, his tall hat pressed down to his eyes, and between the
two his incisive features and his keen, stern glance, he looked the
ideal detective of fiction and the stage. What <i>I</i> looked God
knows, but I did my best to glower and show my teeth at his side. I
had thrown myself into the game, and it was obviously a winning
one.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't take a share, I suppose?" Lord Ernest said
casually.</p>

<p>Raffles did not condescend to reply. I rolled back my lips like
a bull-pup.</p>

<p>"Then a drink, at least!"</p>

<p>My mouth watered, but Raffles shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>"We must be going, my lord, and you will have to come with
us."</p>

<p>I wondered what in the world we should do with him when we had
got him.</p>

<p>"Give me time to put some things together? Pair of pyjamas and
tooth-brush, don't you know?"</p>

<p>"I cannot give you many minutes, my lord, but I don't want to
cause a disturbance here, so I'll tell them to call a cab if you
like. But I shall be back in a minute, and you must be ready in
five. Here, inspector, you'd better keep this while I am gone."</p>

<p>And I was left alone with that dangerous criminal! Raffles
nipped my arm as he handed me the revolver, but I got small comfort
out of that.</p>

<p>" 'Sea-green Incorruptible?'" inquired Lord Ernest as we stood
face to face.</p>

<p>"You don't corrupt me," I replied through naked teeth.</p>

<p>"Then come into my room. I'll lead the way. Think you can hit me
if I misbehave?"</p>

<p>I put the bed between us without a second's delay. My prisoner
flung a suit-case upon it, and tossed things into it with a
dejected air; suddenly, as he was fitting them in, without raising
his head (which I was watching), his right hand closed over the
barrel with which I covered him.</p>

<p>"You'd better not shoot," he said, a knee upon his side of the
bed; "if you do it may be as bad for you as it will be for me!"</p>

<p>I tried to wrest the revolver from him.</p>

<p>"I will if you force me," I hissed.</p>

<p>"You'd better not," he repeated, smiling; and now I saw that if
I did I should only shoot into the bed or my own legs. His hand was
on the top of mine, bending it down, and the revolver with it. The
strength of it was as the strength of ten of mine; and now both his
knees were on the bed; and suddenly I saw his other hand, doubled
into a fist, coming up slowly over the suit-case.</p>

<p>"Help!" I called feebly.</p>

<p>"Help, forsooth! I begin to believe <i>you are</i> from the
Yard," he said&mdash;and his upper-cut came with the "Yard". It
caught me under the chin.</p>

<p>It lifted me off my legs. I have a dim recollection of the crash
that I made in falling.</p>

<p align="center"><b>3</b>
</p>

<p>Raffles was standing over me when I recovered consciousness. I
lay stretched upon the bed across which that blackguard Belville
had struck his knavish blow. The suit-case was on the floor, but
its dastardly owner had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Is he gone?" was my first faint question.</p>

<p>"Thank God you're not, anyway!" replied Raffles, with what
struck me then as mere flippancy. I managed to raise myself upon
one elbow.</p>

<p>"I meant Lord Ernest Belville," said I, with dignity. "Are you
quite sure that he's cleared out?"</p>

<p>Raffles waved a hand towards the window, which stood wide open
to the summer stars.</p>

<p>"Of course," said he, "and by the route I intended him to take;
he's gone by the iron-ladder, as I hoped he would. What on earth
should we have done with him? My poor, dear Bunny, I thought you'd
take a bribe! But it's really more convincing as it is, and just as
well for Lord Ernest to be convinced for the time being."</p>

<p>"Are you sure he is?" I questioned, as I found a rather shaky
pair of legs.</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried Raffles again, in the tone to make one blush
for the least misgiving on the point. "Not that it matters one
bit," he added, airily, "for we have him either way; and when he
does tumble to it, as he may any minute, he won't dare to open his
mouth."</p>

<p>"Then the sooner we clear out the better," said I, but I looked
askance at the open window, for my head was spinning still.</p>

<p>"When you feel up to it," returned Raffles, "we shall
<i>stroll</i> out, and I shall do myself the honor of ringing for
the lift. The force of habit is too strong in you, Bunny. I shall
shut the window and leave everything exactly as we found it. Lord
Ernest will probably tumble before he is badly missed; and then he
may come back to put salt on us; but I should like to know what he
can do even if he succeeds! Come, Bunny, pull yourself together,
and you'll be a different man when you're in the open air."</p>

<p>And for a while I felt one, such was my relief at getting out of
those infernal mansions with unfettered wrists; this we managed
easily enough; but once more Raffles's performance of a small part
was no less perfect than his more ambitious work upstairs, and
something of the successful artist's elation possessed him as we
walked arm-in-arm across St. James's Park. It was long since I had
known him so pleased with himself, and only too long since he had
had such reason.</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever had a brighter idea in my life," he said;
"never thought of it till he was in the next room; never dreamt of
its coming off so ideally even then, and didn't much care, because
we had him all ways up. I'm only sorry you let him knock you out. I
was waiting outside the door all the time, and it made me sick to
hear it. But I once broke my own head, Bunny, if you remember, and
not in half such an excellent cause!"</p>

<p>Raffles touched all his pockets in his turn, the pockets that
contained a small fortune apiece, and he smiled in my face as we
crossed the lighted avenues of the Mall. Next moment he was hailing
a hansom&mdash;for I suppose I was still pretty pale&mdash;and not
a word would he let me speak until we had alighted as near as was
prudent to the flat.</p>

<p>"What a brute I've been, Bunny!" he whispered then, "but you
take half the swag, old boy, and right well you've earned it. No,
we'll go in by the wrong door and over the roof; it's too late for
old Theobald to be still at the play, and too early for him to be
safely in his cups."</p>

<p>So we climbed the many stairs with cat-like stealth, and like
cats crept out upon the grimy leads. But to-night they were no
blacker than their canopy of sky; not a chimney-stack stood out
against the starless night; one had to feel one's way in order to
avoid tripping over the low parapets of the L-shaped wells that ran
from roof to basement to light the inner rooms. One of these wells
was spanned by a flimsy bridge with iron handrails that felt warm
to the touch as Raffles led the way across! A hotter and a closer
night I have never known.</p>

<p>"The flat will be like an oven," I grumbled, at the head of our
own staircase.</p>

<p>"Then we won't go down," said Raffles, promptly; "we'll slack it
up here for a bit instead. No, Bunny, you stay where you are! I'll
fetch you a drink and a deck-chair, and you shan't come down till
you feel more fit."</p>

<p>And I let him have his way, I will not say as usual, for I had
even less than my normal power of resistance that night. That
villainous upper-cut! My head still sang and throbbed, as I seated
myself on one of the aforesaid parapets, and buried it in my hot
hands. Nor was the night one to dispel a headache; there was
distinct thunder in the air. Thus I sat in a heap, and brooded over
my misadventure, a pretty figure of a subordinate villain, until
the step came for which I waited; and it never struck me that it
came from the wrong direction.</p>

<p>"You have been quick," said I, simply.</p>

<p>"Yes," hissed a voice I recognized; "and you've got to be
quicker still! Here, out with your wrists; no, one at a time; and
if you utter a syllable you're a dead man."</p>

<p>It was Lord Ernest Belville; his close-cropped, iron-gray
moustache gleamed through the darkness, drawn up over his set
teeth. In his hand glittered a pair of handcuffs, and before I knew
it one had snapped its jaws about my right wrist.</p>

<p>"Now come this way," said Lord Ernest, showing me a revolver
also, "and wait for your friend. And, recollect, a single syllable
of warning will be your death!"</p>

<p>With that the ruffian led me to the very bridge I had just
crossed at Raffles's heels, and handcuffed me to the iron rail
midway across the chasm. It no longer felt warm to my touch, but
icy as the blood in all my veins.</p>

<p>So this high-born hypocrite had beaten us at our game and his,
and Raffles had met his match at last! That was the most
intolerable thought, that Raffles should be down in the flat on my
account, and that I could not warn him of his impending fate; for
how was it possible without making such an outcry as should bring
the mansions about our ears? And there I shivered on that wretched
plank, chained like Andromeda to the rock, with a black infinity
above and below; and before my eyes, now grown familiar with the
peculiar darkness, stood Lord Ernest Belville, waiting for Raffles
to emerge with full hands and unsuspecting heart! Taken so horribly
unawares, even Raffles must fall an easy prey to a desperado in
resource and courage scarcely second to himself, but one whom he
had fatally underrated from the beginning. Not that I paused to
think how the thing had happened; my one concern was for what was
to happen next.</p>

<p>And what did happen was worse than my worst foreboding, for
first a light came flickering into the sort of companion-hatch at
the head of the stairs, and finally Raffles&mdash;in his
shirt-sleeves! He was not only carrying a candle to put the
finishing touch to him as a target; he had dispensed with coat and
waistcoat downstairs, and was at once full-handed and unarmed.</p>

<p>"Where are you, old chap?" he cried, softly, himself blinded by
the light he carried; and he advanced a couple of steps towards
Belville. "This isn't you, is it?"</p>

<p>And Raffles stopped, his candle held on high, a folding chair
under the other arm.</p>

<p>"No, I am not your friend," replied Lord Ernest, easily; "but
kindly remain standing exactly where you are, and don't lower that
candle an inch, unless you want your brains blown into the
street."</p>

<p>Raffles said never a word, but for a moment did as he was bid;
and the unshaken flame of the candle was testimony alike to the
stillness of the night and to the finest set of nerves in
Europe.</p>

<p>Then, to my horror, he coolly stooped, placing candle and chair
on the leads, and his hands in his pockets, as though it were but a
popgun that covered him.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you shoot?" he asked insolently as he rose.
"Frightened of the noise? I should be, too, with an old-pattern
machine like that. All very well for service in the field&mdash;but
on the house-tops at dead of night!"</p>

<p>"I shall shoot, however," replied Lord Ernest, as quietly in his
turn, and with less insolence, "and chance the noise, unless you
instantly restore my property. I am glad you don't dispute the last
word," he continued after a slight pause. "There is no keener honor
than that which subsists, or ought to subsist, among thieves; and I
need hardly say that I soon spotted you as one of the fraternity.
Not in the beginning, mind you! For the moment I did think you were
one of these smart detectives jumped to life from some sixpenny
magazine; but to preserve the illusion you ought to provide
yourself with a worthier lieutenant. It was he who gave your show
away," chuckled the wretch, dropping for a moment the affected
style of speech which seemed intended to enhance our humiliation;
"smart detectives don't go about with little innocents to assist
them. You needn't be anxious about him, by the way; it wasn't
necessary to pitch him into the street; he is to be seen though not
heard, if you look in the right direction. Nor must you put all the
blame upon your friend; it was not he, but you, who made so sure
that I had got out by the window. You see, I was in my bathroom all
the time&mdash;with the door open."</p>

<p>"The bathroom, eh?" Raffles echoed with professional interest.
"And you followed us on foot across the park?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And then in a cab?"</p>

<p>"And afterwards on foot once more."</p>

<p>"The simplest skeleton would let you in down below."</p>

<p>I saw the lower half of Lord Ernest's face grinning in the light
of the candle set between them on the ground.</p>

<p>"You follow every move," said he; "there can be no doubt you are
one of the fraternity; and I shouldn't wonder if we had formed our
style upon the same model. Ever know A. J. Raffles?"</p>

<p>The abrupt question took my breath away; but Raffles himself did
not lose an instant over his answer.</p>

<p>"Intimately," said he.</p>

<p>"That accounts for you, then," laughed Lord Ernest, "as it does
for me, though I never had the honor of the master's acquaintance.
Nor is it for me to say which is the worthier disciple. Perhaps,
however, now that your friend is handcuffed in mid-air, and you
yourself are at my mercy, you will concede me some little temporary
advantage?"</p>

<p>And his face split in another grin from the cropped moustache
downward, as I saw no longer by candlelight but by a flash of
lightning which tore the sky in two before Raffles could reply.</p>

<p>"You have the bulge at present," admitted Raffles; "but you have
still to lay hands upon your, or our, ill-gotten goods. To shoot me
is not necessarily to do so; to bring either one of us to a violent
end is only to court a yet more violent and infinitely more
disgraceful one for yourself. Family considerations alone should
rule that risk out of your game. Now, an hour or two ago, when the
exact opposite&mdash;"</p>

<p>The remainder of Raffles's speech was drowned from my ears by
the belated crash of thunder which the lightning had foretold. So
loud, however, was the crash when it came, that the storm was
evidently approaching us at a high velocity; yet as the last echo
rumbled away, I heard Raffles talking as though he had never
stopped.</p>

<p>"You offered us a share," he was saying; "unless you mean to
murder us both in cold blood, it will be worth your while to repeat
that offer. We should be dangerous enemies; you had far better make
the best of us as friends."</p>

<p>"Lead the way down to your flat," said Lord Ernest, with a
flourish of his service revolver, "and perhaps we may talk about
it. It is for me to make the terms, I imagine, and in the first
place I am not going to get wet to the skin up here."</p>

<p>The rain was beginning in great drops, even as he spoke, and by
a second flash of lightning I saw Raffles pointing to me.</p>

<p>"But what about my friend?" said he.</p>

<p>And then came the second peal.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>he's</i> all right," the great brute replied; "do him
good! You don't catch me letting myself in for two to one!"</p>

<p>"You will find it equally difficult," rejoined Raffles, "to
induce me to leave my friend to the mercy of a night like this. He
has not recovered from the blow you struck him in your own rooms. I
am not such a fool as to blame you for that, but you are a worse
sportsman than I take you for if you think of leaving him where he
is. If he stays, however, so do I."</p>

<p>And, just as it ceased, Raffles's voice seemed distinctly nearer
to me; but in the darkness and the rain, which was now as heavy as
hail, I could see nothing clearly. The rain had already
extinguished the candle. I heard an oath from Belville, a laugh
from Raffles, and for a second that was all. Raffles was coming to
me, and the other could not even see to fire; that was all I knew
in the pitchy interval of invisible rain before the next crash and
the next flash.</p>

<p>And then!</p>

<p>This time they came together, and not till my dying hour shall I
forget the sight that the lightning lit and the thunder applauded.
Raffles was on one of the parapets of the gulf that my foot-bridge
spanned, and in the sudden illumination he stepped across it as one
might across a garden path. The width was scarcely greater, but the
depth! In the sudden flare I saw to the concrete bottom of the
well, and it looked no larger than the hollow of my hand. Raffles
was laughing in my ear; he had the iron railing fast; it was
between us, but his foothold was as secure as mine. Lord Ernest
Belville, on the contrary, was the fifth of a second late for the
light, and half a foot short in his spring. Something struck our
plank bridge so hard as to set it quivering like a harp-string;
there was half a gasp and half a sob in mid-air beneath our feet;
and then a sound far below that I prefer not to describe. I am not
sure that I could hit upon the perfect simile; it is more than
enough for me that I can hear it still. And with that sickening
sound came the loudest clap of thunder yet, and a great white glare
that showed us our enemy's body far below, with one white hand
spread like a starfish, but the head of him mercifully twisted
underneath.</p>

<p>"It was all his own fault, Bunny. Poor devil! May he and all of
us be forgiven; but pull yourself together for your own sake. Well,
you can't fall; stay where you are a minute."</p>

<p>I remember the uproar of the elements while Raffles was gone; no
other sound mingled with it; not the opening of a single window,
not the uplifting of a single voice. Then came Raffles with soap
and water, and the gyve was wheedled from one wrist, as you
withdraw a ring for which the finger has grown too large. Of the
rest, I only remember shivering till morning in a pitch-dark flat,
whose invalid occupier was for once the nurse, and I his
patient.</p>

<p>And that is the true ending of the episode in which we two set
ourselves to catch one of our own kidney, albeit in another place I
have shirked the whole truth. It is not a grateful task to show
Raffles as completely at fault as he really was on that occasion;
nor do I derive any subtle satisfaction from recounting my own
twofold humiliation, or from having assisted never so indirectly in
the death of a not uncongenial sinner. The truth, however, has
after all a merit of its own, and the great kinsfolk of poor Lord
Ernest have but little to lose by its divulgence. It would seem
that they knew more of the real character of the apostle of
Rational Drink than was known at Exeter Hall. The tragedy was
indeed hushed up, as tragedies only are when they occur in such
circles. But the rumor that did get abroad, as to the class of
enterprise which the poor scamp was pursuing when he met his death,
cannot be too soon exploded, since it breathed upon the fair fame
of some of the most respectable flats in Kensington.</p>

</p>

<p>The square shall be nameless, but if you drive due west from
Piccadilly the cab-man will eventually find it on his left, and he
ought to thank you for two shillings. It is not a fashionable
square, but there are few with a finer garden, while the studios on
the south side lend distinction of another sort. The houses,
however, are small and dingy, and about the last to attract the
expert practitioner in search of a crib. Heaven knows it was with
no such thought I trailed Raffles thither, one unlucky evening at
the latter end of that same season, when Dr. Theobald had at last
insisted upon the bath-chair which I had foreseen in the beginning.
Trees whispered in the green garden aforesaid, and the cool, smooth
lawns looked so inviting that I wondered whether some philanthropic
resident could not be induced to lend us the key. But Raffles would
not listen to the suggestion, when I stopped to make it, and what
was worse, I found him looking wistfully at the little houses
instead.</p>

<p>"Such balconies, Bunny! A leg up, and there you would be!"</p>

<p>I expressed a conviction that there would be nothing worth
taking in the square, but took care to have him under way again as
I spoke.</p>

<p>"I daresay you're right," sighed Raffles. "Rings and watches, I
suppose, but it would be hard luck to take them from people who
live in houses like these. I don't know, though. Here's one with an
extra story. Stop, Bunny; if you don't stop I'll hold on to the
railings! This is a good house; look at the knocker and the
electric bell. They've had that put in. There's some money here, my
rabbit! I dare bet there's a silver-table in the drawing-room; and
the windows are wide open. Electric light, too, by Jove!"</p>

<p>Since stop I must, I had done so on the other side of the road,
in the shadow of the leafy palings, and as Raffles spoke the ground
floor windows opposite had flown alight, showing as pretty a little
dinner-table as one could wish to see, with a man at his wine at
the far end, and the back of a lady in evening dress toward us. It
was like a lantern-picture thrown upon a screen. There were only
the pair of them, but the table was brilliant with silver and gay
with flowers, and the maid waited with the indefinable air of a
good servant. It certainly seemed a good house.</p>

<p>"She's going to let down the blind!" whispered Raffles, in high
excitement. "No, confound them, they've told her not to. Mark down
her necklace, Bunny, and invoice his stud. What a brute he looks!
But I like the table, and that's her show. She has the taste; but
he must have money. See the festive picture over the sideboard?
Looks to me like a Jacques Saillard. But that silver-table would be
good enough for me."</p>

<p>"Get on," said I. "You're in a bath-chair."</p>

<p>"But the whole square's at dinner! We should have the ball at
our feet. It wouldn't take two twos!"</p>

<p>"With those blinds up, and the cook in the kitchen
underneath?"</p>

<p>He nodded, leaning forward in the chair, his hands upon the
wraps about his legs.</p>

<p>"You must be mad," said I, and got back to my handles with the
word, but when I tugged the chair ran light.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page192.jpg" alt=""

</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on the rug," came in a whisper from the middle of
the road; and there stood my invalid, his pale face in a quiver of
pure mischief, yet set with his insane resolve. "I'm only going to
see whether that woman has a silver-table&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We don't want it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It won't take a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's madness, madness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then don't you wait!"</p>

<p>It was like him to leave me with that, and this time I had taken
him at his last word had not my own given me an idea. Mad I had
called him, and mad I could declare him upon oath if necessary. It
was not as though the thing had happened far from home. They could
learn all about us at the nearest mansions. I referred them to Dr.
Theobald; this was a Mr. Maturin, one of his patients, and I was
his keeper, and he had never given me the slip before. I heard
myself making these explanations on the doorstep, and pointing to
the deserted bath-chair as the proof, while the pretty parlor maid
ran for the police. It would be a more serious matter for me than
for my charge. I should lose my place. No, he had never done such a
thing before, and I would answer for it that he never should
again.</p>

<p>I saw myself conducting Raffles back to his chair, with a firm
hand and a stern tongue. I heard him thanking me in whispers on the
way home. It would be the first tight place I had ever got him out
of, and I was quite anxious for him to get into it, so sure was I
of every move. My whole position had altered in the few seconds
that it took me to follow this illuminating train of ideas; it was
now so strong that I could watch Raffles without much anxiety. And
he was worth watching.</p>

<p>He had stepped boldly but softly to the front door, and there he
was still waiting, ready to ring if the door opened or a face
appeared in the area, and doubtless to pretend that he had rung
already. But he had not to ring at all; and suddenly I saw his foot
in the letter-box, his left hand on the lintel overhead. It was
thrilling, even to a hardened accomplice with an explanation up his
sleeve! A tight grip with that left hand of his, as he leant
backward with all his weight upon those five fingers; a right arm
stretched outward and upward to its last inch; and the base of the
low, projecting balcony was safely caught.</p>

<p>I looked down and took breath. The maid was removing the crumbs
in the lighted room, and the square was empty as before. What a
blessing it was the end of the season! Many of the houses remained
in darkness. I looked up again, and Raffles was drawing his left
leg over the balcony railing. In another moment he had disappeared
through one of the French windows which opened upon the balcony,
and in yet another he had switched on the electric light within.
This was bad enough, for now I, at least, could see everything he
did; but the crowning folly was still to come. There was no point
in it; the mad thing was done for my benefit, as I knew at once and
he afterward confessed; but the lunatic reappeared on the balcony,
bowing like a mountebank&mdash;in his crape mask!</p>

<p>I set off with the empty chair, but I came back. I could not
desert old Raffles, even when I would, but must try to explain away
his mask as well, if he had not the sense to take it off in time.
It would be difficult, but burglaries are not usually committed
from a bath-chair, and for the rest I put my faith in Dr. Theobald.
Meanwhile Raffles had at least withdrawn from the balcony, and now
I could only see his head as he peered into a cabinet at the other
side of the room. It was like the opera of Aida, in which two
scenes are enacted simultaneously, one in the dungeon below, the
other in the temple above. In the same fashion my attention now
became divided between the picture of Raffles moving stealthily
about the upper room, and that of the husband and wife at table
underneath. And all at once, as the man replenished his glass with
a shrug of the shoulders, the woman pushed back her chair and
sailed to the door.</p>

<p>Raffles was standing before the fireplace upstairs. He had taken
one of the framed photographs from the chimney-piece, and was
scanning it at suicidal length through the eye-holes in the hideous
mask which he still wore. He would need it after all. The lady had
left the room below, opening and shutting the door for herself; the
man was filling his glass once more. I would have shrieked my
warning to Raffles, so fatally engrossed overhead, but at this
moment (of all others) a constable (of all men) was marching
sedately down our side of the square. There was nothing for it but
to turn a melancholy eye upon the bath-chair, and to ask the
constable the time. I was evidently to be kept there all night, I
remarked, and only realized with the words that they disposed of my
other explanations before they were uttered. It was a horrible
moment for such a discovery. Fortunately the enemy was on the
pavement, from which he could scarcely have seen more than the
drawing-room ceiling, had he looked; but he was not many houses
distant when a door opened and a woman gasped so that I heard both
across the road. And never shall I forget the subsequent tableaux
in the lighted room behind the low balcony and the French
windows.</p>

<p>Raffles stood confronted by a dark and handsome woman whose
profile, as I saw it first in the electric light, is cut like a
cameo in my memory. It had the undeviating line of brow and nose,
the short upper lip, the perfect chin, that are united in marble
oftener than in the flesh; and like marble she stood, or rather
like some beautiful pale bronze; for that was her coloring, and she
lost none of it that I could see, neither trembled; but her bosom
rose and fell, and that was all. So she stood without flinching
before a masked ruffian, who, I felt, would be the first to
appreciate her courage; to me it was so superb that I could think
of it in this way even then, and marvel how Raffles himself could
stand unabashed before so brave a figure. He had not to do so long.
The woman scorned him, and he stood unmoved, a framed photograph
still in his hand. Then, with a quick, determined movement she
turned, not to the door or to the bell, but to the open window by
which Raffles had entered; and this with that accursed policeman
still in view. So far no word had passed between the pair. But at
this point Raffles said something, I could not hear what, but at
the sound of his voice the woman wheeled. And Raffles was looking
humbly in her face, the crape mask snatched from his own.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page204.jpg" alt=""
width="538" height="750">
</p>

<p>"Arthur!" she cried; and that might have been heard in the
middle of the square garden.</p>

<p>Then they stood gazing at each other, neither unmoved any more,
and while they stood the street-door opened and banged. It was her
husband leaving the house, a fine figure of a man, but a dissipated
face, and a step even now distinguished by the extreme caution
which precedes unsteadiness. He broke the spell. His wife came to
the balcony, then looked back into the room, and yet again along
the road, and this time I saw her face. It was the face of one
glancing indeed from Hyperion to a satyr. And then I saw the rings
flash, as her hand fell gently upon Raffles's arm.</p>

<p>They disappeared from that window. Their heads showed for an
instant in the next. Then they dipped out of sight, and an inner
ceiling flashed out under a new light; they had gone into the back
drawing-room, beyond my ken. The maid came up with coffee, her
mistress hastily met her at the door, and once more disappeared.
The square was as quiet as ever. I remained some minutes where I
was. Now and then I thought I heard their voices in the back
drawing-room. I was seldom sure.</p>

<p>My state of mind may be imagined by those readers who take an
interest in my personal psychology. It does not amuse me to look
back upon it. But at length I had the sense to put myself in
Raffles's place. He had been recognized at last, he had come to
life. Only one person knew as yet, but that person was a woman, and
a woman who had once been fond of him, if the human face could
speak. Would she keep his secret? Would he tell her where he lived?
It was terrible to think we were such neighbors, and with the
thought that it was terrible came a little enlightenment as to what
could still be done for the best. He would not tell her where he
lived. I knew him too well for that. He would run for it when he
could, and the bath-chair and I must not be there to give him away.
I dragged the infernal vehicle round the nearer corner. Then I
waited&mdash;there could be no harm in that&mdash;and at last he
came.</p>

<p>He was walking briskly, so I was right, and he had not played
the invalid to her; yet I heard him cry out with pleasure as he
turned the corner, and he flung himself into the chair with a
long-drawn sigh that did me good.</p>

<p>"Well done, Bunny&mdash;well done! I am on my way to Earl's
Court, she's capable of following me, but she won't look for me in
a bath-chair. Home, home, home, and not another word till we get
there!"</p>

<p>Capable of following him? She overtook us before we were past
the studios on the south side of the square, the woman herself, in
a hooded opera-cloak. But she never gave us a glance, and we saw
her turn safely in the right direction for Earl's Court, and the
wrong one for our humble mansions. Raffles thanked his gods in a
voice that trembled, and five minutes later we were in the flat.
Then for once it was Raffles who filled the tumblers and found the
cigarettes, and for once (and once only in all my knowledge of him)
did he drain his glass at a draught.</p>

<p>"You didn't see the balcony scene?" he asked at length; and they
were his first words since the woman passed us on his track.</p>

<p>"Do you mean when she came in?"</p>

<p>"No, when I came down."</p>

<p>"I didn't."</p>

<p>"I hope nobody else saw it," said Raffles devoutly. "I don't say
that Romeo and Juliet were brother and sister to us. But you might
have said so, Bunny!"</p>

<p>He was staring at the carpet with as wry a face as lover ever
wore.</p>

<p>"An old flame?" said I, gently.</p>

<p>"A married woman," he groaned.</p>

<p>"So I gathered."</p>

<p>"But she always was one, Bunny," said he, ruefully. "That's the
trouble. It makes all the difference in the world!"</p>

<p>I saw the difference, but said I did not see how it could make
any now. He had eluded the lady, after all; had we not seen her off
upon a scent as false as scent could be? There was occasion for
redoubled caution in the future, but none for immediate anxiety. I
quoted the bedside Theobald, but Raffles did not smile. His eyes
had been downcast all this time, and now, when he raised them, I
perceived that my comfort had been administered to deaf ears.</p>

<p>"Do you know who she is?" said he.</p>

<p>"Not from Eve."</p>

<p>"Jacques Saillard," he said, as though now I must know.</p>

<p>But the name left me cold and stolid. I had heard it, but that
was all. It was lamentable ignorance, I am aware, but I had
specialized in Letters at the expense of Art.</p>

<p>"You must know her pictures," said Raffles, patiently; "but I
suppose you thought she was a man. They would appeal to you, Bunny;
that festive piece over the sideboard was her work. Sometimes they
risk her at the Academy, sometimes they fight shy. She has one of
those studios in the same square; they used to live up near
Lord's."</p>

<p>My mind was busy brightening a dim memory of nymphs reflected in
woody pools. "Of course!" I exclaimed, and added something about "a
clever woman". Raffles rose at the phrase.</p>

<p>"A clever woman!" he echoed, scornfully; "if she were only that
I should feel safe as houses. Clever women can't forget their
cleverness, they carry it as badly as a boy does his wine, and are
about as dangerous. I don't call Jacques Saillard clever outside
her art, but neither do I call her a woman at all. She does man's
work over a man's name, has the will of any ten men I ever knew,
and I don't mind telling you that I fear her more than any person
on God's earth. I broke with her once," said Raffles, grimly, "but
I know her. If I had been asked to name the one person in London by
whom I was keenest <i>not</i> to be bowled out, I should have named
Jacques Saillard."</p>

<p>That he had never before named her to me was as characteristic
as the reticence with which Raffles spoke of their past relations,
and even of their conversation in the back drawing-room that
evening.</p>

<p>It was a question of principle with him, and one that I like to
remember. "Never give a woman away, Bunny," he used to say; and he
said it again to-night, but with a heavy cloud upon him, as though
his chivalry was sorely tried.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said I, "if you're not going to be given
away yourself."</p>

<p>"That's just it, Bunny! That's just&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words were out of him, it was too late to recall them. I had
hit the nail upon the head.</p>

<p>"So she threatened you," I said, "did she?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say so," he replied, coldly.</p>

<p>"And she is mated with a clown!" I pursued.</p>

<p>"How she ever married him," he admitted, "is a mystery to
me."</p>

<p>"It always is," said I, the wise man for once, and rather
enjoying the role.</p>

<p>"Southern blood?"</p>

<p>"Spanish."</p>

<p>"She'll be pestering you to run off with her, old chap," said
I.</p>

<p>Raffles was pacing the room. He stopped in his stride for half a
second. So she had begun pestering him already! It is wonderful how
acute any fool can be in the affairs of his friend.</p>

<p>But Raffles resumed his walk without a syllable, and I retreated
to safer ground.</p>

<p>"So you sent her to Earl's Court," I mused aloud; and at last he
smiled.</p>

<p>"You'll be interested to hear, Bunny," said he, "that I am now
living in Seven Dials, and Bill Sikes couldn't hold a farthing dip
to me. Bless you, she had my old police record at her fingers'
ends, but it was fit to frame compared with the one I gave her. I
had sunk as low as they dig. I divided my nights between the open
parks and a thieves' kitchen in Seven Dials. If I was decently
dressed it was because I had stolen the suit down the Thames Valley
beat the night before last. I was on my way back when first that
sleepy square, and then her open window, proved too much for me.
You should have heard me beg her to let me push on to the devil in
my own way; there I spread myself, for I meant every word; but I
swore the final stage would be a six-foot drop."</p>

<p>"You did lay it on," said I.</p>

<p>"It was necessary, and that had its effect. She let me go. But
at the last moment she said she didn't believe I was so black as I
painted myself, and then there was the balcony scene you
missed."</p>

<p>So that was all. I could not help telling him that he had got
out of it better than he deserved for ever getting in. Next moment
I regretted the remark.</p>

<p>"If I have got out of it," said Raffles, doubtfully. "We are
dreadfully near neighbors, and I can't move in a minute, with old
Theobald taking a grave view of my case. I suppose I had better lie
low, and thank the gods again for putting her off the scent for the
time being."</p>

<p>No doubt our conversation was carried beyond this point, but it
certainly was not many minutes later, nor had we left the subject,
when the electric bell thrilled us both to a sudden silence.</p>

<p>"The doctor?" I queried, hope fighting with my horror.</p>

<p>"It was a single ring."</p>

<p>"The last post?"</p>

<p>"You know he knocks, and it's long past his time."</p>

<p>The electric bell rang again, but now as though it never would
stop.</p>

<p>"You go, Bunny," said Raffles, with decision. His eyes were
sparkling. His smile was firm.</p>

<p>"What am I to say?"</p>

<p>"If it's the lady let her in."</p>

<p>It was the lady, still in her evening cloak, with her fine dark
head half-hidden by the hood, and an engaging contempt of
appearances upon her angry face. She was even handsomer than I had
thought, and her beauty of a bolder type, but she was also angrier
than I had anticipated when I came so readily to the door. The
passage into which it opened was an exceedingly narrow one, as I
have often said, but I never dreamt of barring this woman's way,
though not a word did she stoop to say to me. I was only too glad
to flatten myself against the wall, as the rustling fury strode
past me into the lighted room with the open door.</p>

<p>"So this is your thieves' kitchen!" she cried, in high-pitched
scorn.</p>

<p>I was on the threshold myself, and Raffles glanced towards me
with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I have certainly had better quarters in my day," said he, "but
you need not call them absurd names before my man."</p>

<p>"Then send your 'man' about his business," said Jacques
Saillard, with an unpleasant stress upon the word indicated.</p>

<p>But when the door was shut I heard Raffles assuring her that I
knew nothing, that he was a real invalid overcome by a sudden mad
temptation, and all he had told her of his life a lie to hide his
whereabouts, but all he was telling her now she could prove for
herself without leaving that building. It seemed, however, that she
had proved it already by going first to the porter below stairs.
Yet I do not think she cared one atom which story was the
truth.</p>

<p>"So you thought I could pass you in your chair," she said, "or
ever in this world again, without hearing from my heart that it was
you!"</p>

<p align="center"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>"Bunny," said Raffles, "I'm awfully sorry, old chap, but you've
got to go."</p>

<p>It was some weeks since the first untimely visitation of Jacques
Saillard, but there had been many others at all hours of the day,
while Raffles had been induced to pay at least one to her studio in
the neighboring square. These intrusions he had endured at first
with an air of humorous resignation which imposed upon me less than
he imagined. The woman meant well, he said, after all, and could be
trusted to keep his secret loyally. It was plain to me, however,
that Raffles did not trust her, and that his pretence upon the
point was a deliberate pose to conceal the extent to which she had
him in her power. Otherwise there would have been little point in
hiding anything from the one person in possession of the cardinal
secret of his identity.</p>

<p>But Raffles thought it worth his while to hoodwink Jacques
Saillard in the subsidiary matter of his health, in which Dr.
Theobald lent him unwitting assistance, and, as we have seen, to
impress upon her that I was actually his attendant, and as ignorant
of his past as the doctor himself. "So you're all right, Bunny," he
had assured me; "she thinks you knew nothing the other night. I
told you she wasn't a clever woman outside her work. But hasn't she
a will!" I told Raffles it was very considerate of him to keep me
out of it, but that it seemed to me like tying up the bag when the
cat had escaped. His reply was an admission that one must be on the
defensive with such a woman and in such a case. Soon after this,
Raffles, looking far from well, fell back upon his own last line of
defence, namely, his bed; and now, as always in the end, I could
see some sense in his subtleties, since it was comparatively easy
for me to turn even Jacques Saillard from the door, with Dr.
Theobald's explicit injunctions, and with my own honesty
unquestioned. So for a day we had peace once more. Then came
letters, then the doctor again and again, and finally my dismissal
in the incredible words which have necessitated these
explanations.</p>

<p>"Go?" I echoed. "Go where?"</p>

<p>"It's that ass Theobald," said Raffles. "He insists."</p>

<p>"On my going altogether?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And you mean to let him have his way?"</p>

<p>I had no language for my mortification and disgust, though
neither was as yet quite so great as my surprise. I had foreseen
almost every conceivable consequence of the mad act which brought
all this trouble to pass, but a voluntary division between Raffles
and me had certainly never entered my calculations. Nor could I
think that it had occurred to him before our egregious doctor's
last visit, this very morning. Raffles had looked irritated as he
broke the news to me from his pillow, and now there was some
sympathy in the way he sat up in bed, as though he felt the thing
himself.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to give in to the fellow," said he. "He's saving
me from my friend, and I'm bound to humor him. But I can tell you
that we've been arguing about you for the last half hour, Bunny. It
was no use; the idiot has had his knife in you from the first; and
he wouldn't see me through on any other conditions."</p>

<p>"So he is going to see you through, is he?"</p>

<p>"It tots up to that," said Raffles, looking at me rather hard.
"At all events he has come to my rescue for the time being, and
it's for me to manage the rest. You don't know what it has been,
Bunny, these last few weeks; and gallantry forbids that I should
tell you even now. But would you rather elope against your will, or
have your continued existence made known to the world in general
and the police in particular? That is practically the problem which
I have had to solve, and the temporary solution was to fall ill. As
a matter of fact, I am ill; and now what do you think? I owe it to
you to tell you, Bunny, though it goes against the grain. She would
take me 'to the dear, warm underworld, where the sun really
shines,' and she would 'nurse me back to life and love!' The
artistic temperament is a fearsome thing, Bunny, in a woman with
the devil's own will!"</p>

<p>Raffles tore up the letter from which he had read these piquant
extracts, and lay back on the pillows with the tired air of the
veritable invalid which he seemed able to assume at will. But for
once he did look as though bed was the best place for him; and I
used the fact as an argument for my own retention in defiance of
Dr. Theobald. The town was full of typhoid, I said, and certainly
that autumnal scourge was in the air. Did he want me to leave him
at the very moment when he might be sickening for a serious
illness?</p>

<p>"You know I don't, my good fellow," said Raffles, wearily; "but
Theobald does, and I can't afford to go against him now. Not that I
really care what happens to me now that that woman knows I'm in the
land of the living; she'll let it out, to a dead certainty, and at
the best there'll be a hue and cry, which is the very thing I have
escaped all these years. Now, what I want you to do is to go and
take some quiet place somewhere, and then let me know, so that I
may have a port in the storm when it breaks."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking!" I cried, recovering my spirits. "I thought
you meant to go and drop a fellow altogether!"</p>

<p>"Exactly the sort of thing you would think," rejoined Raffles,
with a contempt that was welcome enough after my late alarm. "No,
my dear rabbit, what you've got to do is to make a new burrow for
us both. Try down the Thames, in some quiet nook that a literary
man would naturally select. I've often thought that more use might
be made of a boat, while the family are at dinner, than there ever
has been yet. If Raffles is to come to life, old chap, he shall go
a-Raffling for all he's worth! There's something to be done with a
bicycle, too. Try Ham Common or Roehampton, or some such sleepy
hollow a trifle off the line; and say you're expecting your brother
from the colonies."</p>

<p>Into this arrangement I entered without the slightest
hesitation, for we had funds enough to carry it out on a
comfortable scale, and Raffles placed a sufficient share at my
disposal for the nonce. Moreover, I for one was only too glad to
seek fresh fields and pastures new&mdash;a phrase which I
determined to interpret literally in my choice of fresh
surroundings. I was tired of our submerged life in the poky little
flat, especially now that we had money enough for better things. I
myself of late had dark dealings with the receivers, with the
result that poor Lord Ernest Belville's successes were now indeed
ours. Subsequent complications had been the more galling on that
account, while the wanton way in which they had been created was
the most irritating reflection of all. But it had brought its own
punishment upon Raffles, and I fancied the lesson would prove
salutary when we again settled down.</p>

<p>"If ever we do, Bunny!" said he, as I took his hand and told him
how I was already looking forward to the time.</p>

<p>"But of course we will!" I cried, concealing the resentment at
leaving him which his tone and his appearance renewed in my
breast.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of it," he said, gloomily. "I'm in somebody's
clutches, and I've got to get out of them first."</p>

<p>"I'll sit tight until you do."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "if you don't see me in ten days you never
will."</p>

<p>"Only ten days?" I echoed. "That's nothing at all."</p>

<p>"A lot may happen in ten days," replied Raffles, in the same
depressing tone, so very depressing in him; and with that he held
out his hand a second time, and dropped mine suddenly after as
sudden a pressure for farewell.</p>

<p>I left the flat in considerable dejection after all, unable to
decide whether Raffles was really ill, or only worried as I knew
him to be. And at the foot of the stairs the author of my
dismissal, that confounded Theobald, flung open his door and
waylaid me.</p>

<p>"Are you going?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The traps in my hands proclaimed that I was, but I dropped them
at his feet to have it out with him then and there.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered fiercely, "thanks to you!"</p>

<p>"Well, my good fellow," he said, his full-blooded face
lightening and softening at the same time, as though a load were
off his mind, "it's no pleasure to me to deprive any man of his
billet, but you never were a nurse, and you know that as well as I
do."</p>

<p>I began to wonder what he meant, and how much he did know, and
my speculations kept me silent. "But come in here a moment," he
continued, just as I decided that he knew nothing at all. And,
leading me into his minute consulting-room, Dr. Theobald solemnly
presented me with a sovereign by way of compensation, which I
pocketed as solemnly, and with as much gratitude as if I had not
fifty of them distributed over my person as it was. The good fellow
had quite forgotten my social status, about which he himself had
been so particular at our earliest interview; but he had never
accustomed himself to treat me as a gentleman, and I do not suppose
he had been improving his memory by the tall tumbler which I saw
him poke behind a photograph as we entered.</p>

<p>"There's one thing I should like to know before I go," said I,
turning suddenly on the doctor's mat, "and that is whether Mr.
Maturin is really ill or not!"</p>

<p>I meant, of course, at the present moment, but Dr. Theobald
braced himself like a recruit at the drill-sergeant's voice.</p>

<p>"Of course he is," he snapped&mdash;"so ill as to need a nurse
who can nurse, by way of a change."</p>

<p>With that his door shut in my face, and I had to go my way, in
the dark as to whether he had mistaken my meaning, and was telling
me a lie, or not.</p>

<p>But for my misgivings upon this point I might have extracted
some very genuine enjoyment out of the next few days. I had decent
clothes to my back, with money, as I say, in most of the pockets,
and more freedom to spend it than was possible in the constant
society of a man whose personal liberty depended on a universal
supposition that he was dead. Raffles was as bold as ever, and I as
fond of him, but whereas he would run any risk in a professional
exploit, there were many innocent recreations still open to me
which would have been sheer madness in him. He could not even watch
a match, from the sixpenny seats, at Lord's cricket-ground, where
the Gentlemen were every year in a worse way without him. He never
travelled by rail, and dining out was a risk only to be run with
some ulterior object in view. In fact, much as it had changed,
Raffles could no longer show his face with perfect impunity in any
quarter or at any hour. Moreover, after the lesson he had now
learnt, I foresaw increased caution on his part in this respect.
But I myself was under no such perpetual disadvantage, and, while
what was good enough for Raffles was quite good enough for me so
long as we were together, I saw no harm in profiting by the present
opportunity of "doing my-self well".</p>

<p>Such were my reflections on the way to Richmond in a hansom cab.
Richmond had struck us both as the best centre of operations in
search of the suburban retreat which Raffles wanted, and by road,
in a well-appointed, well-selected hansom, was certainly the most
agreeable way of getting there. In a week or ten days Raffles was
to write to me at the Richmond post-office, but for at least a week
I should be "on my own". It was not an unpleasant sensation as I
leant back in the comfortable hansom, and rather to one side, in
order to have a good look at myself in the bevelled mirror that is
almost as great an improvement in these vehicles as the rubber
tires. Really I was not an ill-looking youth, if one may call one's
self such at the age of thirty. I could lay no claim either to the
striking cast of countenance or to the peculiar charm of expression
which made the face of Raffles like no other in the world. But this
very distinction was in itself a danger, for its impression was
indelible, whereas I might still have been mistaken for a hundred
other young fellows at large in London. Incredible as it may appear
to the moralists, I had sustained no external hallmark by my term
of imprisonment, and I am vain enough to believe that the evil
which I did had not a separate existence in my face. This
afternoon, indeed, I was struck by the purity of my fresh
complexion, and rather depressed by the general innocence of the
visage which peered into mine from the little mirror. My
straw-colored moustache, grown in the flat after a protracted
holiday, again preserved the most disappointing dimensions, and was
still invisible in certain lights without wax. So far from
discerning the desperate criminal who has "done time" once, and
deserved it over and over again, the superior but superficial
observer might have imagined that he detected a certain element of
folly in my face.</p>

<p>At all events it was not the face to shut the doors of a
first-class hotel against me, without accidental evidence of a more
explicit kind, and it was with no little satisfaction that I
directed the man to drive to the Star and Garter. I also told him
to go through Richmond Park, though he warned me that it would add
considerably to the distance and his fare. It was autumn, and it
struck me that the tints would be fine. And I had learnt from
Raffles to appreciate such things, even amid the excitement of an
audacious enterprise.</p>

<p>If I dwell upon my appreciation of this occasion it is because,
like most pleasures, it was exceedingly short-lived. I was very
comfortable at the Star and Garter, which was so empty that I had a
room worthy of a prince, where I could enjoy the finest of all
views (in patriotic opinion) every morning while I shaved. I walked
many miles through the noble park, over the commons of Ham and
Wimbledon, and one day as far as that of Esher, where I was
forcibly reminded of a service we once rendered to a distinguished
resident in this delightful locality. But it was on Ham Common, one
of the places which Raffles had mentioned as specially desirable,
that I actually found an almost ideal retreat. This was a cottage
where I heard, on inquiry, that rooms were to be let in the summer.
The landlady, a motherly body, of visible excellence, was surprised
indeed at receiving an application for the winter months; but I
have generally found that the title of "author," claimed with an
air, explains every little innocent irregularity of conduct or
appearance, and even requires something of the kind to carry
conviction to the lay intelligence. The present case was one in
point, and when I said that I could only write in a room facing
north, on mutton chops and milk, with a cold ham in the wardrobe in
case of nocturnal inspiration, to which I was liable, my literary
character was established beyond dispute. I secured the rooms, paid
a month's rent in advance at my own request, and moped in them
dreadfully until the week was up and Raffles due any day. I
explained that the inspiration would not come, and asked abruptly
if the mutton was New Zealand.</p>

<p>Thrice had I made fruitless inquiries at the Richmond
post-office; but on the tenth day I was in and out almost every
hour. Not a word was there for me up to the last post at night.
Home I trudged to Ham with horrible forebodings, and back again to
Richmond after breakfast next morning. Still there was nothing. I
could bear it no more. At ten minutes to eleven I was climbing the
station stairs at Earl's Court.</p>

<p>It was a wretched morning there, a weeping mist shrouding the
long, straight street, and clinging to one's face in clammy
caresses. I felt how much better it was down at Ham, as I turned
into our side street, and saw the flats looming like mountains, the
chimney-pots hidden in the mist. At our entrance stood a nebulous
conveyance, that I took at first for a tradesman's van; to my
horror it proved to be a hearse; and all at once the white breath
ceased upon my lips.</p>

<p>I had looked up at our windows and the blinds were down!</p>

<p>I rushed within. The doctor's door stood open. I neither knocked
nor rang, but found him in his consulting-room with red eyes and a
blotchy face. Otherwise he was in solemn black from head to
heel.</p>

<p>"Who is dead?" I burst out. "Who is dead?"</p>

<p>The red eyes looked redder than ever as Dr. Theobald opened them
at the unwarrantable sight of me; and he was terribly slow in
answering. But in the end he did answer, and did not kick me out as
he evidently had a mind.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maturin," he said, and sighed like a beaten man.</p>

<p>I said nothing. It was no surprise to me. I had known it all
these minutes. Nay, I had dreaded this from the first, had divined
it at the last, though to the last also I had refused to entertain
my own conviction. Raffles dead! A real invalid after all! Raffles
dead, and on the point of burial!</p>

<p>"What did he die of?" I asked, unconsciously drawing on that
fund of grim self-control which the weakest of us seem to hold in
reserve for real calamity.</p>

<p>"Typhoid," he answered. "Kensington is full of it."</p>

<p>"He was sickening for it when I left, and you knew it, and could
get rid of me then!"</p>

<p>"My good fellow, I was obliged to have a more experienced nurse
for that very reason."</p>

<p>The doctor's tone was so conciliatory that I remembered in an
instant what a humbug the man was, and became suddenly possessed
with the vague conviction that he was imposing upon me now.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was typhoid at all?" I cried fiercely to his
face. "Are you sure it wasn't suicide&mdash;or murder?"</p>

<p>I confess that I can see little point in this speech as I write
it down, but it was what I said in a burst of grief and of wild
suspicion; nor was it without effect upon Dr. Theobald, who turned
bright scarlet from his well-brushed hair to his immaculate
collar.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to throw you out into the street?" he cried; and
all at once I remembered that I had come to Raffles as a perfect
stranger, and for his sake might as well preserve that character to
the last.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," I said, brokenly. "He was so good to
me&mdash;I became so attached to him. You forget I am originally of
his class."</p>

<p>"I did forget it," replied Theobald, looking relieved at my new
tone, "and I beg <i>your</i> pardon for doing so. Hush! They are
bringing him down. I must have a drink before we start, and you'd
better join me."</p>

<p>There was no pretence about his drink this time, and a pretty
stiff one it was, but I fancy my own must have run it hard. In my
case it cast a merciful haze over much of the next hour, which I
can truthfully describe as one of the most painful of my whole
existence. I can have known very little of what I was doing. I only
remember finding myself in a hansom, suddenly wondering why it was
going so slowly, and once more awaking to the truth. But it was to
the truth itself more than to the liquor that I must have owed my
dazed condition. My next recollection is of looking down into the
open grave, in a sudden passionate anxiety to see the name for
myself. It was not the name of my friend, of course, but it was the
one under which he had passed for many months.</p>

<p>I was still stupefied by a sense of inconceivable loss, and had
not raised my eyes from that which was slowly forcing me to realize
what had happened, when there was a rustle at my elbow, and a
shower of hothouse flowers passed before them, falling like huge
snowflakes where my gaze had rested. I looked up, and at my side
stood a majestic figure in deep mourning. The face was carefully
veiled, but I was too close not to recognize the masterful beauty
whom the world knew as Jacques Saillard. I had no sympathy with
her; on the contrary, my blood boiled with the vague conviction
that in some way she was responsible for this death. Yet she was
the only woman present&mdash;there were not a half a dozen of us
altogether&mdash;and her flowers were the only flowers.</p>

<p>The melancholy ceremony was over, and Jacques Saillard had
departed in a funeral brougham, evidently hired for the occasion. I
had watched her drive away, and the sight of my own cabman, making
signs to me through the fog, had suddenly reminded me that I had
bidden him to wait. I was the last to leave, and had turned my back
upon the grave-diggers, already at their final task, when a hand
fell lightly but firmly upon my shoulder.</p>

<p>"I don't want to make a scene in a cemetery," said a voice, in a
not unkindly, almost confidential whisper. "Will you get into your
own cab and come quietly?"</p>

<p>"Who on earth are you?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>I now remembered having seen the fellow hovering about during
the funeral, and subconsciously taking him for the undertaker's
head man. He had certainly that appearance, and even now I could
scarcely believe that he was anything else.</p>

<p>"My name won't help you," he said, pityingly. "But you will
guess where I come from when I tell you I have a warrant for your
arrest."</p>

<p>My sensations at this announcement may not be believed, but I
solemnly declare that I have seldom experienced so fierce a
satisfaction. Here was a new excitement in which to drown my grief;
here was something to think about; and I should be spared the
intolerable experience of a solitary return to the little place at
Ham. It was as though I had lost a limb and some one had struck me
so hard in the face that the greater agony was forgotten. I got
into the hansom without a word, my captor following at my heels,
and giving his own directions to the cabman before taking his seat.
The word "station" was the only one I caught, and I wondered
whether it was to be Bow Street again. My companion's next words,
however, or rather the tone in which he uttered them, destroyed my
capacity for idle speculation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maturin!" said he. "Mr. Maturin indeed!"</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "what about him?"</p>

<p>"Do you think we don't know who he was?"</p>

<p>"Who was he?" I asked, defiantly.</p>

<p>"You ought to know," said he. "You got locked up through him the
other time, too. His favorite name was Raffles then."</p>

<p>"It was his real name," I said, indignantly. "And he has been
dead for years."</p>

<p>My captor simply chuckled.</p>

<p>"He's at the bottom of the sea, I tell you!"</p>

<p>But I do not know why I should have told him with such spirit,
for what could it matter to Raffles now? I did not think; instinct
was still stronger than reason, and, fresh from his funeral, I had
taken up the cudgels for my dead friend as though he were still
alive. Next moment I saw this for myself, and my tears came nearer
the surface than they had been yet; but the fellow at my side
laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you something else?" said he.</p>

<p>"As you like."</p>

<p>"He's not even at the bottom of that grave! He's no more dead
than you or I, and a sham burial is his latest piece of
villainy!"</p>

<p>I doubt whether I could have spoken if I had tried. I did not
try. I had no use for speech. I did not even ask him if he was
sure, I was so sure myself. It was all as plain to me as riddles
usually are when one has the answer. The doctor's alarms, his
unscrupulous venality, the simulated illness, my own dismissal,
each fitted in its obvious place, and not even the last had power
as yet to mar my joy in the one central fact to which all the rest
were as tapers to the sun.</p>

<p>"He is alive!" I cried. "Nothing else matters&mdash;he is
alive!"</p>

<p>At last I did ask whether they had got him too; but thankful as
I was for the greater knowledge, I confess that I did not much care
what answer I received. Already I was figuring out how much we
might each get, and how old we should be when we came out. But my
companion tilted his hat to the back of his head, at the same time
putting his face close to mine, and compelling my scrutiny. And my
answer, as you have already guessed, was the face of Raffles
himself, superbly disguised (but less superbly than his voice), and
yet so thinly that I should have known him in a trice had I not
been too miserable in the beginning to give him a second
glance.</p>

<p>Jacques Saillard had made his life impossible, and this was the
one escape. Raffles had bought the doctor for a thousand pounds,
and the doctor had bought a "nurse" of his own kidney, on his own
account; me, for some reason, he would not trust; he had insisted
upon my dismissal as an essential preliminary to his part in the
conspiracy. Here the details were half-humorous, half-grewsome,
each in turn as Raffles told me the story. At one period he had
been very daringly drugged indeed, and, in his own words, "as dead
as a man need be"; but he had left strict instructions that nobody
but the nurse and "my devoted physician" should "lay a finger on
me" afterwards; and by virtue of this proviso a library of books
(largely acquired for the occasion) had been impiously interred at
Kensal Green. Raffles had definitely undertaken not to trust me
with the secret, and, but for my untoward appearance at the funeral
(which he had attended for his own final satisfaction), I was
assured and am convinced that he would have kept his promise to the
letter. In explaining this he gave me the one explanation I
desired, and in another moment we turned into Praed Street,
Paddington.</p>

<p>"And I thought you said Bow Street!" said I. "Are you coming
straight down to Richmond with me?"</p>

<p>"I may as well," said Raffles, "though I did mean to get my kit
first, so as to start in fair and square as the long-lost brother
from the bush. That's why I hadn't written. The function was a day
later than I calculated. I was going to write to-night."</p>

<p>"But what are we to do?" said I, hesitating when he had paid the
cab. "I have been playing the colonies for all they are worth!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've lost my luggage," said he, "or a wave came into my
cabin and spoilt every stitch, or I had nothing fit to bring
ashore. We'll settle that in the train."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheWrongHouse" id=
"TheWrongHouse"></a>The Wrong House</b>
</h2>

<p>My brother Ralph, who now lived with me on the edge of Ham
Common, had come home from Australia with a curious affection of
the eyes, due to long exposure to the glare out there, and
necessitating the use of clouded spectacles in the open air. He had
not the rich complexion of the typical colonist, being indeed
peculiarly pale, but it appeared that he had been confined to his
berth for the greater part of the voyage, while his prematurely
gray hair was sufficient proof that the rigors of bush life had at
last undermined an originally tough constitution. Our landlady, who
spoilt my brother from the first, was much concerned on his behalf,
and wished to call in the local doctor; but Ralph said dreadful
things about the profession, and quite frightened the good woman by
arbitrarily forbidding her ever to let a doctor inside her door. I
had to apologize to her for the painful prejudices and violent
language of "these colonists", but the old soul was easily
mollified. She had fallen in love with my brother at first sight,
and she never could do too much for him. It was owing to our
landlady that I took to calling him Ralph, for the first time in
our lives, on her beginning to speak of and to him as "Mr.
Raffles".</p>

<p>"This won't do," said he to me. "It's a name that sticks."</p>

<p>"It must be my fault! She must have heard it from me," said I
self-reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You must tell her it's the short for Ralph."</p>

<p>"But it's longer."</p>

<p>"It's the short," said he; "and you've got to tell her so."</p>

<p>Henceforth I heard as much of "Mr. Ralph", his likes and
dislikes, what he would fancy and what he would not, and oh, what a
dear gentleman he was, that I often remembered to say "Ralph, old
chap", myself.</p>

<p>It was an ideal cottage, as I said when I found it, and in it
our delicate man became rapidly robust. Not that the air was also
ideal, for, when it was not raining, we had the same faithful mist
from November to March. But it was something to Ralph to get any
air at all, other than night-air, and the bicycle did the rest. We
taught ourselves, and may I never forget our earlier rides, through
and through Richmond Park when the afternoons were shortest, upon
the incomparable Ripley Road when we gave a day to it. Raffles rode
a Beeston Humber, a Royal Sunbeam was good enough for me, but he
insisted on our both having Dunlop tires.</p>

<p>"They seem the most popular brand. I had my eye on the road all
the way from Ripley to Cobham, and there were more Dunlop marks
than any other kind. Bless you, yes, they all leave their special
tracks, and we don't want ours to be extra special; the Dunlop's
like a rattlesnake, and the Palmer leaves telegraph-wires, but
surely the serpent is more in our line."</p>

<p>That was the winter when there were so many burglaries in the
Thames Valley from Richmond upward. It was said that the thieves
used bicycles in every case, but what is not said? They were
sometimes on foot to my knowledge, and we took a great interest in
the series, or rather sequence of successful crimes. Raffles would
often get his devoted old lady to read him the latest local
accounts, while I was busy with my writing (much I wrote) in my own
room. We even rode out by night ourselves, to see if we could not
get on the tracks of the thieves, and never did we fail to find hot
coffee on the hob for our return. We had indeed fallen upon our
feet. Also, the misty nights might have been made for the thieves.
But their success was not so consistent, and never so enormous as
people said, especially the sufferers, who lost more valuables than
they had ever been known to possess. Failure was often the
caitiff's portion, and disaster once; owing, ironically enough, to
that very mist which should have served them. But as I am going to
tell the story with some particularity, and perhaps some gusto, you
will see why who read.</p>

<p>The right house stood on high ground near the river, with quite
a drive (in at one gate and out at the other) sweeping past the
steps. Between the two gates was a half-moon of shrubs, to the left
of the steps a conservatory, and to their right the walk leading to
the tradesmen's entrance and the back premises; here also was the
pantry window, of which more anon. The right house was the
residence of an opulent stockbroker who wore a heavy watch-chain
and seemed fair game. There would have been two objections to it
had I been the stockbroker. The house was one of a row, though a
goodly row, and an army-crammer had established himself next door.
There is a type of such institutions in the suburbs; the youths go
about in knickerbockers, smoking pipes, except on Saturday nights,
when they lead each other home from the last train. It was none of
our business to spy upon these boys, but their manners and customs
fell within the field of observation. And we did not choose the
night upon which the whole row was likely to be kept awake.</p>

<p>The night that we did choose was as misty as even the Thames
Valley is capable of making them. Raffles smeared vaseline upon the
plated parts of his Beeston Humber before starting, and our dear
landlady cosseted us both, and prayed we might see nothing of the
nasty burglars, not denying as the reward would be very handy to
them that got it, to say nothing of the honor and glory. We had
promised her a liberal perquisite in the event of our success, but
she must not give other cyclists our idea by mentioning it to a
soul. It was about midnight when we cycled through Kingston to
Surbiton, having trundled our machines across Ham Fields, mournful
in the mist as those by Acheron, and so over Teddington Bridge.</p>

<p>I often wonder why the pantry window is the vulnerable point of
nine houses out of ten. This house of ours was almost the tenth,
for the window in question had bars of sorts, but not the right
sort. The only bars that Raffles allowed to beat him were the kind
that are let into the stone outside; those fixed within are merely
screwed to the woodwork, and you can unscrew as many as necessary
if you take the trouble and have the time. Barred windows are
usually devoid of other fasteners worthy the name; this one was no
exception to that foolish rule, and a push with the pen-knife did
its business. I am giving householders some valuable hints, and
perhaps deserving a good mark from the critics. These, in any case,
are the points that I would see to, were I a rich stockbroker in a
riverside suburb. In giving good advice, however, I should not have
omitted to say that we had left our machines in the semi-circular
shrubbery in front, or that Raffles had most ingeniously fitted our
lamps with dark slides, which enabled us to leave them burning.</p>

<p>It proved sufficient to unscrew the bars at the bottom only, and
then to wrench them to either side. Neither of us had grown stout
with advancing years, and in a few minutes we both had wormed
through into the sink, and thence to the floor. It was not an
absolutely noiseless process, but once in the pantry we were mice,
and no longer blind mice. There was a gas-bracket, but we did not
meddle with that. Raffles went armed these nights with a better
light than gas; if it were not immoral, I might recommend a
dark-lantern which was more or less his patent. It was that handy
invention, the electric torch, fitted by Raffles with a dark hood
to fulfil the functions of a slide. I had held it through the bars
while he undid the screws, and now he held it to the keyhole, in
which a key was turned upon the other side.</p>

<p>There was a pause for consideration, and in the pause we put on
our masks. It was never known that these Thames Valley robberies
were all committed by miscreants decked in the livery of crime, but
that was because until this night we had never even shown our
masks. It was a point upon which Raffles had insisted on all
feasible occasions since his furtive return to the world. To-night
it twice nearly lost us everything&mdash;but you shall hear.</p>

<p>There is a forceps for turning keys from the wrong side of the
door, but the implement is not so easy of manipulation as it might
be. Raffles for one preferred a sharp knife and the corner of the
panel. You go through the panel because that is thinnest, of course
in the corner nearest the key, and you use a knife when you can,
because it makes least noise. But it does take minutes, and even I
can remember shifting the electric torch from one hand to the other
before the aperture was large enough to receive the hand and wrist
of Raffles.</p>

<p>He had at such times a motto of which I might have made earlier
use, but the fact is that I have only once before described a
downright burglary in which I assisted, and that without knowing it
at the time. The most solemn student of these annals cannot affirm
that he has cut through many doors in our company, since (what was
to me) the maiden effort to which I allude. I, however, have
cracked only too many a crib in conjunction with A. J. Raffles, and
at the crucial moment he would whisper "Victory or Wormwood
Scrubbs, Bunny!" or instead of Wormwood Scrubbs it might be
Portland Bill. This time it was neither one nor the other, for with
that very word "victory" upon his lips, they whitened and parted
with the first taste of defeat.</p>

<p>"My hand's held!" gasped Raffles, and the white of his eyes
showed all round the iris, a rarer thing than you may think.</p>

<p>At the same moment I heard the shuffling feet and the low,
excited young voices on the other side of the door, and a faint
light shone round Raffles's wrist.</p>

<p>"Well done, Beefy!"</p>

<p>"Hang on to him!"</p>

<p>"Good old Beefy!"</p>

<p>"Beefy's got him!"</p>

<p>"So have I&mdash;so have I!"</p>

<p>And Raffles caught my arm with his one free hand. "They've got
me tight," he whispered. "I'm done."</p>

<p>"Blaze through the door," I urged, and might have done it had I
been armed. But I never was. It was Raffles who monopolized that
risk.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;it's the boys&mdash;the wrong house!" he
whispered. "Curse the fog&mdash;it's done me. But you get out,
Bunny, while you can; never mind me; it's my turn, old chap."</p>

<p>His one hand tightened in affectionate farewell. I put the
electric torch in it before I went, trembling in every inch, but
without a word.</p>

<p>Get out! His turn! Yes, I would get out, but only to come in
again, for it was my turn&mdash;mine&mdash;not his. Would Raffles
leave me held by a hand through a hole in a door? What he would
have done in my place was the thing for me to do now. I began by
diving head-first through the pantry window and coming to earth
upon all fours. But even as I stood up, and brushed the gravel from
the palms of my hands and the knees of my knickerbockers, I had no
notion what to do next. And yet I was halfway to the front door
before I remembered the vile crape mask upon my face, and tore it
off as the door flew open and my feet were on the steps.</p>

<p>"He's into the next garden," I cried to a bevy of pyjamas with
bare feet and young faces at either end of them.</p>

<p>"Who? Who?" said they, giving way before me.</p>

<p>"Some fellow who came through one of your windows
head-first."</p>

<p>"The other Johnny, the other Johnny," the cherubs chorused.</p>

<p>"Biking past&mdash;saw the light&mdash;why, what have you
there?"</p>

<p>Of course it was Raffles's hand that they had, but now I was in
the hall among them. A red-faced barrel of a boy did all the
holding, one hand round the wrist, the other palm to palm, and his
knees braced up against the panel. Another was rendering
ostentatious but ineffectual aid, and three or four others danced
about in their pyjamas. After all, they were not more than four to
one. I had raised my voice, so that Raffles might hear me and take
heart, and now I raised it again. Yet to this day I cannot account
for my inspiration, that proved nothing less.</p>

<p>"Don't talk so loud," they were crying below their breath;
"don't wake 'em upstairs, this is our show."</p>

<p>"Then I see you've got one of them," said I, as desired. "Well,
if you want the other you can have him, too. I believe he's hurt
himself."</p>

<p>"After him, after him!" they exclaimed as one.</p>

<p>"But I think he got over the wall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on, you chaps, come on!"</p>

<p>And there was a soft stampede to the hall door.</p>

<p>"Don't all desert me, I say!" gasped the red-faced hero who held
Raffles prisoner.</p>

<p>"We must have them both, Beefy!"</p>

<p>"That's all very well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here," I interposed, "I'll stay by you. I've a friend
outside, I'll get him too."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," said the valiant Beefy.</p>

<p>The hall was empty now. My heart beat high.</p>

<p>"How did you hear them?" I inquired, my eye running over
him.</p>

<p>"We were down having drinks&mdash;game o' Nap&mdash;in
there."</p>

<p>Beefy jerked his great head toward an open door, and the tail of
my eye caught the glint of glasses in the firelight, but the rest
of it was otherwise engaged.</p>

<p>"Let me relieve you," I said, trembling.</p>

<p>"No, I'm all right."</p>

<p>"Then I must insist."</p>

<p>And before he could answer I had him round the neck with such a
will that not a gurgle passed my fingers, for they were almost
buried in his hot, smooth flesh. Oh, I am not proud of it; the act
was as vile as an act could be; but I was not going to see Raffles
taken, my one desire was to be the saving of him, and I tremble
even now to think to what lengths I might have gone for its
fulfilment. As it was, I squeezed and tugged until one strong hand
gave way after the other and came feeling round for me, but feebly
because they had held on so long. And what do you suppose was
happening at the same moment? The pinched white hand of Raffles,
reddening with returning blood, and with a clot of blood upon the
wrist, was craning upward and turning the key in the lock without a
moment's loss.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page248.jpg" alt=""

</p>

<p>"Steady on, Bunny!"</p>

<p>And I saw that Beefy's ears were blue; but Raffles was feeling
in his pockets as he spoke. "Now let him breathe," said he,
clapping his handkerchief over the poor youth's mouth. An empty
vial was in his other hand, and the first few stertorous breaths
that the poor boy took were the end of him for the time being. Oh,
but it was villainous, my part especially, for he must have been
far gone to go the rest of the way so readily. I began by saying I
was not proud of this deed, but its dastardly character has come
home to me more than ever with the penance of writing it out. I see
in myself, at least my then self, things that I never saw quite so
clearly before. Yet let me be quite sure that I would not do the
same again. I had not the smallest desire to throttle this innocent
lad (nor did I), but only to extricate Raffles from the most
hopeless position he was ever in; and after all it was better than
a blow from behind. On the whole, I will not alter a word, nor
whine about the thing any more.</p>

<p>We lifted the plucky fellow into Raffles's place in the pantry,
locked the door on him, and put the key through the panel. Now was
the moment for thinking of ourselves, and again that infernal mask
which Raffles swore by came near the undoing of us both. We had
reached the steps when we were hailed by a voice, not from without
but from within, and I had just time to tear the accursed thing
from Raffles's face before he turned.</p>

<p>A stout man with a blonde moustache was on the stairs, in his
pyjamas like the boys.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" said he.</p>

<p>"There has been an attempt upon your house," said I, still
spokesman for the night, and still on the wings of inspiration.</p>

<p>"Your sons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My pupils."</p>

<p>"Indeed. Well, they heard it, drove off the thieves, and have
given chase."</p>

<p>"And where do you come in?" inquired the stout man,
descending.</p>

<p>"We were bicycling past, and I actually saw one fellow come
head-first through your pantry window. I think he got over the
wall."</p>

<p>Here a breathless boy returned.</p>

<p>"Can't see anything of him," he gasped.</p>

<p>"It's true, then," remarked the crammer.</p>

<p>"Look at that door," said I.</p>

<p>But unfortunately the breathless boy looked also, and now he was
being joined by others equally short of wind.</p>

<p>"Where's Beefy?" he screamed. "What on earth's happened to
Beefy?"</p>

<p>"My good boys," exclaimed the crammer, "will one of you be kind
enough to tell me what you've been doing, and what these gentlemen
have been doing for you? Come in all, before you get your death. I
see lights in the class-room, and more than lights. Can these be
signs of a carouse?"</p>

<p>"A very innocent one, sir," said a well set-up youth with more
moustache than I have yet.</p>

<p>"Well, Olphert, boys will be boys. Suppose you tell me what
happened, before we come to recriminations."</p>

<p>The bad old proverb was my first warning. I caught two of the
youths exchanging glances under raised eyebrows. Yet their stout,
easy-going mentor had given me such a reassuring glance of
side-long humor, as between man of the world and man of the world,
that it was difficult to suspect him of suspicion. I was
nevertheless itching to be gone.</p>

<p>Young Olphert told his story with engaging candor. It was true
that they had come down for an hour's Nap and cigarettes; well, and
there was no denying that there was whiskey in the glasses. The
boys were now all back in their class-room, I think entirely for
the sake of warmth; but Raffles and I were in knickerbockers and
Norfolk jackets, and very naturally remained without, while the
army-crammer (who wore bedroom slippers) stood on the threshold,
with an eye each way. The more I saw of the man the better I liked
and the more I feared him. His chief annoyance thus far was that
they had not called him when they heard the noise, that they had
dreamt of leaving him out of the fun. But he seemed more hurt than
angry about that.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," concluded Olphert, "we left old Beefy Smith hanging
on to his hand, and this gentleman with him, so perhaps he can tell
us what happened next?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could," I cried with all their eyes upon me, for I had
had time to think. "Some of you must have heard me say I'd fetch my
friend in from the road?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," piped an innocent from within.</p>

<p>"Well, and when I came back with him things were exactly as you
see them now. Evidently the man's strength was too much for the
boy's; but whether he ran upstairs or outside I know no more than
you do."</p>

<p>"It wasn't like that boy to run either way," said the crammer,
cocking a clear blue eye on me.</p>

<p>"But if he gave chase!"</p>

<p>"It wasn't like him even to let go."</p>

<p>"I don't believe Beefy ever would," put in Olphert. "That's why
we gave him the billet."</p>

<p>"He may have followed him through the pantry window," I
suggested wildly.</p>

<p>"But the door's shut," put in a boy.</p>

<p>"I'll have a look at it," said the crammer.</p>

<p>And the key no longer in the lock, and the insensible youth
within! The key would be missed, the door kicked in; nay, with the
man's eye still upon me, I thought I could smell the
chloroform.</p>

<p>I thought I could hear a moan, and prepared for either any
moment. And how he did stare! I have detested blue eyes ever since,
and blonde moustaches, and the whole stout easy-going type that is
not such a fool as it looks. I had brazened it out with the boys,
but the first grown man was too many for me, and the blood ran out
of my heart as though there was no Raffles at my back. Indeed, I
had forgotten him. I had so longed to put this thing through by
myself! Even in my extremity it was almost a disappointment to me
when his dear, cool voice fell like a delicious draught upon my
ears. But its effect upon the others is more interesting to recall.
Until now the crammer had the centre of the stage, but at this
point Raffles usurped a place which was always his at will. People
would wait for what he had to say, as these people waited now for
the simplest and most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>"One moment!" he had begun.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the crammer, relieving me of his eyes at last.</p>

<p>"I don't want to lose any of the fun&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor must you," said the crammer, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"But we've left our bikes outside, and mine's a Beeston Humber,"
continued Raffles. "If you don't mind, we'll bring 'em in before
these fellows get away on them."</p>

<p>And out he went without a look to see the effect of his words, I
after him with a determined imitation of his self-control. But I
would have given something to turn round. I believe that for one
moment the shrewd instructor was taken in, but as I reached the
steps I heard him asking his pupils whether any of them had seen
any bicycles outside.</p>

<p>That moment, however, made the difference. We were in the
shrubbery, Raffles with his electric torch drawn and blazing, when
we heard the kicking at the pantry door, and in the drive with our
bicycles before man and boys poured pell-mell down the steps.</p>

<p>We rushed our machines to the nearer gate, for both were shut,
and we got through and swung it home behind us in the nick of time.
Even I could mount before they could reopen the gate, which Raffles
held against them for half an instant with unnecessary gallantry.
But he would see me in front of him, and so it fell to me to lead
the way.</p>

<p>Now, I have said that it was a very misty night (hence the whole
thing), and also that these houses were on a hill. But they were
not nearly on the top of the hill, and I did what I firmly believe
that almost everybody would have done in my place. Raffles, indeed,
said he would have done it himself, but that was his generosity,
and he was the one man who would not. What I did was to turn in the
opposite direction to the other gate, where we might so easily have
been cut off, and to pedal for my life&mdash;up-hill!</p>

<p>"My God!" I shouted when I found it out.</p>

<p>"Can you turn in your own length?" asked Raffles, following
loyally.</p>

<p>"Not certain."</p>

<p>"Then stick to it. You couldn't help it. But it's the devil of a
hill!"</p>

<p>"And here they come!"</p>

<p>"Let them," said Raffles, and brandished his electric torch, our
only light as yet.</p>

<p>A hill seems endless in the dark, for you cannot see the end,
and with the patter of bare feet gaining on us, I thought this one
could have no end at all. Of course the boys could charge up it
quicker than we could pedal, but I even heard the voice of their
stout instructor growing louder through the mist.</p>

<p>"Oh, to think I've let you in for this!" I groaned, my head over
the handle-bars, every ounce of my weight first on one foot and
then on the other. I glanced at Raffles, and in the white light of
his torch he was doing it all with his ankles, exactly as though he
had been riding in a Gymkhana.</p>

<p>"It's the most sporting chase I was ever in," said he.</p>

<p>"All my fault!"</p>

<p>"My dear Bunny, I wouldn't have missed it for the world!"</p>

<p>Nor would he forge ahead of me, though he could have done so in
a moment, he who from his boyhood had done everything of the kind
so much better than anybody else. No, he must ride a wheel's length
behind me, and now we could not only hear the boys running, but
breathing also. And then of a sudden I saw Raffles on my right
striking with his torch; a face flew out of the darkness to meet
the thick glass bulb with the glowing wire enclosed; it was the
face of the boy Olphert, with his enviable moustache, but it
vanished with the crash of glass, and the naked wire thickened to
the eye like a tuning-fork struck red-hot.</p>

<p>I saw no more of that. One of them had crept up on my side also;
as I looked, hearing him pant, he was grabbing at my left handle,
and I nearly sent Raffles into the hedge by the sharp turn I took
to the right. His wheel's length saved him. But my boy could run,
was overhauling me again, seemed certain of me this time, when all
at once the Sunbeam ran easily; every ounce of my weight with
either foot once more, and I was over the crest of the hill, the
gray road reeling out from under me as I felt for my brake. I
looked back at Raffles. He had put up his feet. I screwed my head
round still further, and there were the boys in their pyjamas,
their hands upon their knees, like so many wicket-keepers, and a
big man shaking his fist. There was a lamp-post on the hill-top,
and that was the last I saw.</p>

<p>We sailed down to the river, then on through Thames Ditton as
far as Esher Station, when we turned sharp to the right, and from
the dark stretch by Imber Court came to light in Molesey, and were
soon pedalling like gentlemen of leisure through Bushey Park, our
lights turned up, the broken torch put out and away. The big gates
had long been shut, but you can manoeuvre a bicycle through the
others. We had no further adventures on the way home, and our
coffee was still warm upon the hob.</p>

<p>"But I think it's an occasion for Sullivans," said Raffles, who
now kept them for such. "By all my gods, Bunny, it's been the most
sporting night we ever had in our lives! And do you know which was
the most sporting part of it?"</p>

<p>"That up-hill ride?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of it."</p>

<p>"Turning your torch into a truncheon?"</p>

<p>"My dear Bunny! A gallant lad&mdash;I hated hitting him."</p>

<p>"I know," I said. "The way you got us out of the house!"</p>

<p>"No, Bunny," said Raffles, blowing rings. "It came before that,
you sinner, and you know it!"</p>

<p>"You don't mean anything I did?" said I, self-consciously, for I
began to see that this was what he did mean. And now at latest it
will also be seen why this story has been told with undue and
inexcusable gusto; there is none other like it for me to tell; it
is my one ewe-lamb in all these annals. But Raffles had a ruder
name for it.</p>

<p>"It was the Apotheosis of the Bunny," said he, but in a tone I
never shall forget.</p>

<p>"I hardly knew what I was doing or saying," I said. "The whole
thing was a fluke."</p>

<p>"Then," said Raffles, "it was the kind of fluke I always trusted
you to make when runs were wanted."</p>

<p>And he held out his dear old hand.</p>

</p>

<p>"The worst of this war," said Raffles, "is the way it puts a
fellow off his work."</p>

<p>It was, of course, the winter before last, and we had done
nothing dreadful since the early autumn. Undoubtedly the war was
the cause. Not that we were among the earlier victims of the fever.
I took disgracefully little interest in the Negotiations, while the
Ultimatum appealed to Raffles as a sporting flutter. Then we gave
the whole thing till Christmas. We still missed the cricket in the
papers. But one russet afternoon we were in Richmond, and a
terrible type was shouting himself hoarse with " 'Eavy British
lorsses&mdash;orful slorter o' the Bo-wers! Orful slorter! Orful
slorter! 'Eavy British lorsses!" I thought the terrible type had
invented it, but Raffles gave him more than he asked, and then I
held the bicycle while he tried to pronounce Eland's Laagte. We
were never again without our sheaf of evening papers, and Raffles
ordered three morning ones, and I gave up mine in spite of its
literary page. We became strategists. We knew exactly what Buller
was to do on landing, and, still better, what the other Generals
should have done. Our map was the best that could be bought, with
flags that deserved a better fate than standing still. Raffles woke
me to hear "The Absent-Minded Beggar" on the morning it appeared;
he was one of the first substantial subscribers to the fund. By
this time our dear landlady was more excited than we. To our
enthusiasm for Thomas she added a personal bitterness against the
Wild Boars, as she persisted in calling them, each time as though
it were the first. I could linger over our landlady's attitude in
the whole matter. That was her only joke about it, and the true
humorist never smiled at it herself. But you had only to say a
syllable for a venerable gentleman, declared by her to be at the
bottom of it all, to hear what she could do to him if she caught
him. She could put him in a cage and go on tour with him, and make
him howl and dance for his food like a debased bear before a fresh
audience every day. Yet a more kind-hearted woman I have never
known. The war did not uplift our landlady as it did her
lodgers.</p>

<p>But presently it ceased to have that precise effect upon us. Bad
was being made worse and worse; and then came more than Englishmen
could endure in that black week across which the names of three
African villages are written forever in letters of blood. "All
three pegs," groaned Raffles on the last morning of the week;
"neck-and-crop, neck-and-crop!" It was his first word of cricket
since the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>We were both depressed. Old school-fellows had fallen, and I
know Raffles envied them; he spoke so wistfully of such an end. To
cheer him up I proposed to break into one of the many more or less
royal residences in our neighborhood; a tough crib was what he
needed; but I will not trouble you with what he said to me. There
was less crime in England that winter than for years past; there
was none at all in Raffles. And yet there were those who could
denounce the war!</p>

<p>So we went on for a few of those dark days, Raffles very glum
and grim, till one fine morning the Yeomanry idea put new heart
into us all. It struck me at once as the glorious scheme it was to
prove, but it did not hit me where it hit others. I was not a
fox-hunter, and the gentlemen of England would scarcely have owned
me as one of them. The case of Raffles was in that respect still
more hopeless (he who had even played for them at Lord's), and he
seemed to feel it. He would not speak to me all the morning; in the
afternoon he went for a walk alone. It was another man who came
home, flourishing a small bottle packed in white paper.</p>

<p>"Bunny," said he, "I never did lift my elbow; it's the one vice
I never had. It has taken me all these years to find my tipple,
Bunny; but here it is, my panacea, my elixir, my magic
philtre!"</p>

<p>I thought he had been at it on the road, and asked him the name
of the stuff.</p>

<p>"Look and see, Bunny."</p>

<p>And if it wasn't a bottle of ladies' hair-dye, warranted to
change any shade into the once fashionable yellow within a given
number of applications!</p>

<p>"What on earth," said I, "are you going to do with this?"</p>

<p>"Dye for my country," he cried, swelling. "<i>Dulce et decorum
est</i>, Bunny, my boy!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you are going to the front?"</p>

<p>"If I can without coming to it."</p>

<p>I looked at him as he stood in the firelight, straight as a
dart, spare but wiry, alert, laughing, flushed from his wintry
walk; and as I looked, all the years that I had known him, and more
besides, slipped from him in my eyes. I saw him captain of the
eleven at school. I saw him running with the muddy ball on days
like this, running round the other fifteen as a sheep-dog round a
flock of sheep. He had his cap on still, and but for the gray hairs
underneath&mdash;but here I lost him in a sudden mist. It was not
sorrow at his going, for I did not mean to let him go alone. It was
enthusiasm, admiration, affection, and also, I believe, a sudden
regret that he had not always appealed to that part of my nature to
which he was appealing now. It was a little thrill of penitence.
Enough of it.</p>

<p>"I think it great of you," I said, and at first that was
all.</p>

<p>How he laughed at me. He had had his innings; there was no
better way of getting out. He had scored off an African
millionaire, the Players, a Queensland Legislator, the Camorra, the
late Lord Ernest Belville, and again and again off Scotland Yard.
What more could one man do in one lifetime? And at the worst it was
the death to die: no bed, no doctor, no temperature&mdash;and
Raffles stopped himself.</p>

<p>"No pinioning, no white cap," he added, "if you like that
better."</p>

<p>"I don't like any of it," I cried, cordially; "you've simply got
to come back."</p>

<p>"To what?" he asked, a strange look on him.</p>

<p>And I wondered&mdash;for one instant&mdash;whether my little
thrill had gone through him. He was not a man of little
thrills.</p>

<p>Then for a minute I was in misery. Of course I wanted to go
too&mdash;he shook my hand without a word&mdash;but how could I?
They would never have me, a branded jailbird, in the Imperial
Yeomanry! Raffles burst out laughing; he had been looking very hard
at me for about three seconds.</p>

<p>"You rabbit," he cried, "even to think of it! We might as well
offer ourselves to the Metropolitan Police Force. No, Bunny, we go
out to the Cape on our own, and that's where we enlist. One of
these regiments of irregular horse is the thing for us; you spent
part of your pretty penny on horse-flesh, I believe, and you
remember how I rode in the bush! We're the very men for them,
Bunny, and they won't ask to see our birthmarks out there. I don't
think even my hoary locks would put them off, but it would be too
conspicuous in the ranks."</p>

<p>Our landlady first wept on hearing our determination, and then
longed to have the pulling of certain whiskers (with the tongs, and
they should be red-hot); but from that day, and for as many as were
left to us, the good soul made more of us than ever. Not that she
was at all surprised; dear brave gentlemen who could look for
burglars on their bicycles at dead of night, it was only what you
might expect of them, bless their lion hearts. I wanted to wink at
Raffles, but he would not catch my eye. He was a ginger-headed
Raffles by the end of January, and it was extraordinary what a
difference it made. His most elaborate disguises had not been more
effectual than this simple expedient, and, with khaki to complete
the subdual of his individuality, he had every hope of escaping
recognition in the field. The man he dreaded was the officer he had
known in old days; there were ever so many of him at the Front; and
it was to minimize this risk that we went out second-class at the
beginning of February.</p>

<p>It was a weeping day, a day in a shroud, cold as clay, yet for
that very reason an ideal day upon which to leave England for the
sunny Front. Yet my heart was heavy as I looked my last at her; it
was heavy as the raw, thick air, until Raffles came and leant upon
the rail at my side.</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking, and you've got to stop," said he.
"It's on the knees of the gods, Bunny, whether we do or we don't,
and thinking won't make us see over their shoulders."</p>

<p align="center"><b>2</b>
</p>

<p>Now I made as bad a soldier (except at heart) as Raffles made a
good one, and I could not say a harder thing of myself. My
ignorance of matters military was up to that time unfathomable, and
is still profound. I was always a fool with horses, though I did
not think so at one time, and I had never been any good with a gun.
The average Tommy may be my intellectual inferior, but he must know
some part of his work better than I ever knew any of mine. I never
even learnt to be killed. I do not mean that I ever ran away. The
South African Field Force might have been strengthened if I
had.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks do not express a pose affected out of
superiority to the usual spirit of the conquering hero, for no man
was keener on the war than I, before I went to it. But one can only
write with gusto of events (like that little affair at Surbiton) in
which one has acquitted oneself without discredit, and I cannot say
that of my part in the war, of which I now loathe the thought for
other reasons. The battlefield was no place for me, and neither was
the camp. My ineptitude made me the butt of the looting, cursing,
swash-buckling lot who formed the very irregular squadron which we
joined; and it would have gone hard with me but for Raffles, who
was soon the darling devil of them all, but never more loyally my
friend. Your fireside fire-eater does not think of these things. He
imagines all the fighting to be with the enemy. He will probably be
horrified to hear that men can detest each other as cordially in
khaki as in any other wear, and with a virulence seldom inspired by
the bearded dead-shot in the opposite trench. To the fireside
fire-eater, therefore (for you have seen me one myself), I dedicate
the story of Corporal Connal, Captain Bellingham, the General,
Raffles, and myself.</p>

<p>I must be vague, for obvious reasons. The troop is fighting as I
write; you will soon hear why I am not; but neither is Raffles, nor
Corporal Connal. They are fighting as well as ever, those other
hard-living, harder-dying sons of all soils; but I am not going to
say where it was that we fought with them. I believe that no body
of men of equal size has done half so much heroic work. But they
had got themselves a bad name off the field, so to speak; and I am
not going to make it worse by saddling them before the world with
Raffles and myself, and that ruffian Connal.</p>

<p>The fellow was a mongrel type, a Glasgow Irishman by birth and
upbringing, but he had been in South Africa for years, and he
certainly knew the country very well. This circumstance, coupled
with the fact that he was a very handy man with horses, as all
colonists are, had procured him the first small step from the ranks
which facilitates bullying if a man be a bully by nature, and is
physically fitted to be a successful one. Connal was a hulking
ruffian, and in me had ideal game. The brute was offensive to me
from the hour I joined. The details are of no importance, but I
stood up to him at first in words, and finally for a few seconds on
my feet. Then I went down like an ox, and Raffles came out of his
tent. Their fight lasted twenty minutes, and Raffles was marked,
but the net result was dreadfully conventional, for the bully was a
bully no more.</p>

<p>But I began gradually to suspect that he was something worse.
All this time we were fighting every day, or so it seems when I
look back. Never a great engagement, and yet never a day when we
were wholly out of touch with the enemy. I had thus several
opportunities of watching the other enemy under fire, and had
almost convinced myself of the systematic harmlessness of his own
shooting, when a more glaring incident occurred.</p>

<p>One night three troops of our squadron were ordered to a certain
point whither they had patrolled the previous week; but our own
particular troop was to stay behind, and in charge of no other than
the villanous corporal, both our officer and sergeant having gone
into hospital with enteric. Our detention, however, was very
temporary, and Connal would seem to have received the usual vague
orders to proceed in the early morning to the place where the other
three companies had camped. It appeared that we were to form an
escort to two squadron-wagons containing kits, provisions, and
ammunition.</p>

<p>Before daylight Connal had reported his departure to the
commanding officer, and we passed the outposts at gray dawn. Now,
though I was perhaps the least observant person in the troop, I was
not the least wideawake where Corporal Connal was concerned, and it
struck me at once that we were heading in the wrong direction. My
reasons are not material, but as a matter of fact our last week's
patrol had pushed its khaki tentacles both east and west; and
eastward they had met with resistance so determined as to compel
them to retire; yet it was eastward that we were travelling now. I
at once spurred alongside Raffles, as he rode, bronzed and bearded,
with warworn wide-awake over eyes grown keen as a hawk's, and a
cutty-pipe sticking straight out from his front teeth. I can see
him now, so gaunt and grim and debonair, yet already with much of
the nonsense gone out of him, though I thought he only smiled on my
misgivings.</p>

<p>"Did he get the instructions, Bunny, or did we? Very well, then;
give the devil a chance."</p>

<p>There was nothing further to be said, but I felt more crushed
than convinced; so we jogged along into broad daylight, until
Raffles himself gave a whistle of surprise.</p>

<p>"A white flag, Bunny, by all my gods!"</p>

<p>I could not see it; he had the longest sight in all our
squadron; but in a little the fluttering emblem, which had gained
such a sinister significance in most of our eyes, was patent even
to mine. A little longer, and the shaggy Boer was in our midst upon
his shaggy pony, with a half-scared, half-incredulous look in his
deep-set eyes. He was on his way to our lines with some missive,
and had little enough to say to us, though frivolous and flippant
questions were showered upon him from most saddles.</p>

<p>"Any Boers over there?" asked one, pointing in the direction in
which we were still heading.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" interjected Raffles in crisp rebuke.</p>

<p>The Boer looked stolid but sinister.</p>

<p>"Any of our chaps?" added another.</p>

<p>The Boer rode on with an open grin.</p>

<p>And the incredible conclusion of the matter was that we were
actually within their lines in another hour; saw them as large as
life within a mile and a half on either side of us; and must every
man of us have been taken prisoner had not every man but Connal
refused to go one inch further, and had not the Boers themselves
obviously suspected some subtle ruse as the only conceivable
explanation of so madcap a manoeuvre. They allowed us to retire
without firing a shot; and retire you may be sure we did, the
Kaffirs flogging their teams in a fury of fear, and our precious
corporal sullen but defiant.</p>

<p>I have said this was the conclusion of the matter, and I blush
to repeat that it practically was. Connal was indeed wheeled up
before the colonel, but his instructions were not written
instructions, and he lied his way out with equal hardihood and
tact.</p>

<p>"You said 'over there,' sir," he stoutly reiterated; and the
vagueness with which such orders were undoubtedly given was the
saving of him for the time being.</p>

<p>I need not tell you how indignant I felt, for one.</p>

<p>"The fellow is a spy!" I said to Raffles, with no nursery oath,
as we strolled within the lines that night.</p>

<p>He merely smiled in my face.</p>

<p>"And have you only just found it out, Bunny? I have known it
almost ever since we joined; but this morning I did think we had
him on toast."</p>

<p>"It's disgraceful that we had not," cried I. "He ought to have
been shot like a dog."</p>

<p>"Not so loud, Bunny, though I quite agree; but I don't regret
what has happened as much as you do. Not that I am less
bloodthirsty than you are in this case, but a good deal more so!
Bunny, I'm mad-keen on bowling him out with my own unaided
hand&mdash;though I may ask you to take the wicket. Meanwhile,
don't wear all your animosity upon your sleeve; the fellow has
friends who still believe in him; and there is no need for you to
be more openly his enemy than you were before."</p>

<p>Well, I can only vow that I did my best to follow this sound
advice; but who but a Raffles can control his every look? It was
never my forte, as you know, yet to this day I cannot conceive what
I did to excite the treacherous corporal's suspicions. He was
clever enough, however, not to betray them, and lucky enough to
turn the tables on us, as you shall hear.</p>

<p>Bloemfontein had fallen since our arrival, but there was plenty
of fight in the Free Staters still, and I will not deny that it was
these gentry who were showing us the sport for which our corps came
in. Constant skirmishing was our portion, with now and then an
action that you would know at least by name, did I feel free to
mention them. But I do not, and indeed it is better so. I have not
to describe the war even as I saw it, I am thankful to say, but
only the martial story of us two and those others of whom you wot.
Corporal Connal was the dangerous blackguard you have seen. Captain
Bellingham is best known for his position in the batting averages a
year or two ago, and for his subsequent failure to obtain a place
in any of the five Test Matches. But I only think of him as the
officer who recognized Raffles.</p>

<p>We had taken a village, making quite a little name for it and
for ourselves, and in the village our division was reinforced by a
fresh brigade of the Imperial troops. It was a day of rest, our
first for weeks, but Raffles and I spent no small part of it in
seeking high and low for a worthy means of quenching the kind of
thirst which used to beset Yeomen and others who had left good
cellars for the veldt. The old knack came back to us both, though I
believe that I alone was conscious of it at the time; and we were
leaving the house, splendidly supplied, when we almost ran into the
arms of an infantry officer, with a scowl upon his red-hot face,
and an eye-glass flaming at us in the sun.</p>

<p>"Peter Bellingham!" gasped Raffles under his breath, and then we
saluted and tried to pass on, with the bottles ringing like
church-bells under our khaki. But Captain Bellingham was a hard
man.</p>

<p>"What have you men been doin'?" drawled he.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," we protested, like innocence with an injury.</p>

<p>"Lootin' 's forbidden," said he. "You had better let me see
those bottles."</p>

<p>"We are done," whispered Raffles, and straightway we made a
sideboard of the stoop across which he had crept at so inopportune
a moment. I had not the heart to raise my eyes again, yet it was
many moments before the officer broke silence.</p>

<p>"Uam Var!" he murmured reverentially at last. "And Long John of
Ben Nevis! The first drop that's been discovered in the whole
psalm-singing show! What lot do you two belong to?"</p>

<p>I answered.</p>

<p>"I must have your names."</p>

<p>In my agitation I gave my real one. Raffles had turned away, as
though in heart-broken contemplation of our lost loot. I saw the
officer studying his half-profile with an alarming face.</p>

<p>"What's <i>your</i> name?" he rapped out at last.</p>

<p>But his strange, low voice said plainly that he knew, and
Raffles faced him with the monosyllable of confession and assent. I
did not count the seconds until the next word, but it was Captain
Bellingham who uttered it at last.</p>

<p>"I thought you were dead."</p>

<p>"Now you see I am not."</p>

<p>"But you are at your old games!"</p>

<p>"I am not," cried Raffles, and his tone was new to me. I have
seldom heard one more indignant. "Yes," he continued, "this is
loot, and the wrong 'un will out. That's what you're thinking,
Peter&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;sir. But he isn't let out in
the field! We're playing the game as much as you are,
old&mdash;sir."</p>

<p>The plural number caused the captain to toss me a contemptuous
look. "Is this the fellah who was taken when you swam for it?" he
inquired, relapsing into his drawl. Raffles said I was, and with
that took a passionate oath upon our absolute rectitude as
volunteers. There could be no doubting him; but the officer's eyes
went back at the bottles on the stoop.</p>

<p>"But look at those," said he; and as he looked himself the light
eye melted in his fiery face. "And I've got Sparklets in my tent,"
he sighed. "You make it in a minute!"</p>

<p>Not a word from Raffles, and none, you may be sure, from me.
Then suddenly Bellingham told me where his tent was, and, adding
that our case was one for serious consideration, strode in its
direction without another word until some sunlit paces separated
us.</p>

<p>"You can bring that stuff with you," he then flung over a
shoulder-strap, "and I advise you to put it where you had it
before."</p>

<p>A trooper saluted him some yards further on, and looked evilly
at us as we followed with our loot. It was Corporal Connal of ours,
and the thought of him takes my mind off the certainly gallant
captain who only that day had joined our division with the
reinforcements. I could not stand the man myself. He added
soda-water to our whiskey in his tent, and would only keep a couple
of bottles when we came away. Softened by the spirit, to which
disuse made us all a little sensitive, our officer was soon
convinced of the honest part that we were playing for once, and for
fifty minutes of the hour we spent with him he and Raffles talked
cricket without a break. On parting they even shook hands; that was
Long John in the captain's head; but the snob never addressed a
syllable to me.</p>

<p>And now to the gallows-bird who was still corporal of our troop:
it was not long before Raffles was to have his wish and the
traitor's wicket. We had resumed our advance, or rather our humble
part in the great surrounding movement then taking place, and were
under pretty heavy fire once more, when Connal was shot in the
hand. It was a curious casualty in more than one respect, and
nobody seems to have seen it happen. Though a flesh wound, it was a
bloody one, and that may be why the surgeon did not at once detect
those features which afterwards convinced him that the injury had
been self-inflicted. It was the right hand, and until it healed the
man could be of no further use in the firing line; nor was the case
serious enough for admission to a crowded field-hospital; and
Connal himself offered his services as custodian of a number of our
horses which we were keeping out of harm's way in a donga. They had
come there in the following manner: That morning we had been
heliographed to reinforce the C.M.R., only to find that the enemy
had the range to a nicety when we reached the spot. There were
trenches for us men, but no place of safety for our horses nearer
than this long and narrow donga which ran from within our lines
towards those of the Boers. So some of us galloped them thither,
six-in-hand, amid the whine of shrapnel and the whistle of shot. I
remember the man next me being killed by a shell with all his team,
and the tangle of flying harness, torn horseflesh, and crimson
khaki, that we left behind us on the veldt; also that a small red
flag, ludicrously like those used to indicate a putting-green,
marked the single sloping entrance to the otherwise precipitous
donga, which I for one was duly thankful to reach alive.</p>

<p>The same evening Connal, with a few other light casualties to
assist him, took over the charge for which he had volunteered and
for which he was so admirably fitted by his knowledge of horses and
his general experience of the country; nevertheless, he managed to
lose three or four fine chargers in the course of the first night;
and, early in the second, Raffles shook me out of a heavy slumber
in the trenches where we had been firing all day.</p>

<p>"I have found the spot, Bunny," he whispered; "we ought to out
him before the night is over."</p>

<p>"Connal?"</p>

<p>Raffles nodded.</p>

<p>"You know what happened to some of his horses last night? Well,
he let them go himself."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"I'm as certain of it," said Raffles, "as though I'd seen him do
it; and if he does it again I shall see him. I can even tell you
how it happened. Connal insisted on having one end of the donga to
himself, and of course his end is the one nearest the Boers. Well,
then, he tells the other fellows to go to sleep at their
end&mdash;I have it direct from one of them&mdash;and you bet they
don't need a second invitation. The rest I hope to see
to-night."</p>

<p>"It seems almost incredible," said I.</p>

<p>"Not more so than the Light Horseman's dodge of poisoning the
troughs; that happened at Ladysmith before Christmas; and two kind
friends did for that blackguard what you and I are going to do for
this one, and a firing-party did the rest. Brutes! A mounted man's
worth a file on foot in this country, and well they know it. But
this beauty goes one better than the poison; that was wilful waste;
but I'll eat my wideawake if our loss last night wasn't the enemy's
double gain! What we've got to do, Bunny, is to catch him in the
act. It may mean watching him all night, but was ever game so well
worth the candle?"</p>

<p>One may say in passing that, at this particular point of
contact, the enemy were in superior force, and for once in a mood
as aggressive as our own. They were led with a dash, and handled
with a skill, which did not always characterize their commanders at
this stage of the war. Their position was very similar to ours, and
indeed we were to spend the whole of next day in trying with an
equal will to turn each other out. The result will scarcely be
forgotten by those who recognize the occasion from these remarks.
Meanwhile it was the eve of battle (most evenings were), and there
was that villain with the horses in the donga, and here were we two
upon his track.</p>

<p>Raffles's plan was to reconnoitre the place, and then take up a
position from which we could watch our man and pounce upon him if
he gave us cause. The spot that we eventually chose and stealthily
occupied was behind some bushes through which we could see down
into the donga; there were the precious horses; and there sure
enough was our wounded corporal, sitting smoking in his cloak, some
glimmering thing in his lap.</p>

<p>"That's his revolver, and it's a Mauser," whispered Raffles. "He
shan't have a chance of using it on us; either we must be on him
before he knows we are anywhere near, or simply report. It's easily
proved once we are sure; but I should like to have the taking of
him too."</p>

<p>There was a setting moon. Shadows were sharp and black. The man
smoked steadily, and the hungry horses did what I never saw horses
do before; they stood and nibbled at each other's tails. I was used
to sleeping in the open, under the jewelled dome that seems so much
vaster and grander in these wide spaces of the earth. I lay
listening to the horses, and to the myriad small strange voices of
the veldt, to which I cannot even now put a name, while Raffles
watched. "One head is better than two," he said, "when you don't
want it to be seen." We were to take watch and watch about,
however, and the other might sleep if he could; it was not my fault
that I did nothing else; it was Raffles who could trust nobody but
himself. Nor was there any time for recriminations when he did
rouse me in the end.</p>

<p>But a moment ago, as it seemed to me, I had been gazing upward
at the stars and listening to the dear, minute sounds of peace; and
in another the great gray slate was clean, and every bone of me set
in plaster of Paris, and sniping beginning between pickets with the
day. It was an occasional crack, not a constant crackle, but the
whistle of a bullet as it passed us by, or a tiny transitory flame
for the one bit of detail on a blue hill-side, was an unpleasant
warning that we two on ours were a target in ourselves. But Raffles
paid no attention to their fire; he was pointing downward through
the bushes to where Corporal Connal stood with his back to us,
shooing a last charger out of the mouth of the donga towards the
Boer trenches.</p>

<p>"That's his third," whispered Raffles, "but it's the first I've
seen distinctly, for he waited for the blind spot before the dawn.
It's enough to land him, I fancy, but we mustn't lose time. Are you
ready for a creep?"</p>

<p>I stretched myself, and said I was; but I devoutly wished it was
not quite so early in the morning.</p>

<p>"Like cats, then, till he hears, and then into him for all we're
worth. He's stowed his iron safe away, but he mustn't have time
even to feel for it. You take his left arm, Bunny, and hang on to
that like a ferret, and I'll do the rest. Ready? Then now!"</p>

<p>And in less time than it would take to tell, we were over the
lip of the donga and had fallen upon the fellow before he could
turn his head; nevertheless, for a few instants he fought like a
wild beast, striking, kicking, and swinging me off my feet as I
obeyed my instructions to the letter, and stuck to his left like a
leech. But he soon gave that up, panting and blaspheming, demanded
explanations in his hybrid tongue that had half a brogue and half a
burr. What were we doing? What had he done? Raffles at his back,
with his right wrist twisted round and pinned into the small of it,
soon told him that, and I think the words must have been the first
intimation that he had as to who his assailants were.</p>

<p>"So it's you two!" he cried, and a light broke over him. He was
no longer trying to shake us off, and now he dropped his curses
also, and stood chuckling to himself instead. "Well," he went on,
"you're bloody liars both, but I know something else that you are,
so you'd better let go."</p>

<p>A coldness ran through me, and I never saw Raffles so taken
aback. His grip must have relaxed for a fraction of time, for our
captive broke out in a fresh and desperate struggle, but now we
pinned him tighter than ever, and soon I saw him turning green and
yellow with the pain.</p>

<p>"You're breaking my wrist!" he yelled at last.</p>

<p>"Then stand still and tell us who we are."</p>

<p>And he stood still and told us our real names. But Raffles
insisted on hearing how he had found us out, and smiled as though
he had known what was coming when it came. I was dumbfounded.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="c00075-images/page292.jpg" alt=""

</p>

<p>The accursed hound had followed us that evening to Captain
Bellingham's tent, and his undoubted cleverness in his own
profession of spy had done the rest.</p>

<p>"And now you'd better let me go," said the master of the
situation, as I for one could not help regarding him.</p>

<p>"I'll see you damned," said Raffles, savagely.</p>

<p>"Then you're damned and done for yourself, my cocky criminal.
Raffles the burglar! Raffles the society thief! Not dead after all,
but 'live and 'listed. Send him home and give him fourteen years,
and won't he like 'em, that's all!"</p>

<p>"I shall have the pleasure of hearing you shot first," retorted
Raffles, through his teeth, "and that alone will make them
bearable. Come on, Bunny, let's drive the swine along and get it
over."</p>

<p>And drive him we did, he cursing, cajoling, struggling,
gloating, and blubbering by turns. But Raffles never wavered for an
instant, though his face was tragic, and it went to my heart, where
that look stays still. I remember at the time, though I never let
my hold relax, there was a moment when I added my entreaties to
those of our prisoner. Raffles did not even reply to me. But I was
thinking of him, I swear. I was thinking of that gray set face that
I never saw before or after.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>"Your story will be tested," said the commanding officer, when
Connal had been marched to the guard-tent. "Is there any truth in
his?"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly true, sir."</p>

<p>"And the notorious Raffles has been alive all these years, and
you are really he?"</p>

<p>"I am, sir."</p>

<p>"And what are you doing at the front?"</p>

<p>Somehow I thought that Raffles was going to smile, but the grim
set of his mouth never altered, neither was there any change in the
ashy pallor which had come over him in the donga when Connal
mouthed his name. It was only his eyes that lighted up at the last
question.</p>

<p>"I am fighting, sir," said he, as simply as any subaltern in the
army.</p>

<p>The commanding officer inclined a grizzled head perceptibly, and
no more. He was not one of any school, our General; he had his own
ways, and we loved both him and them; and I believe that he loved
the rough but gallant corps that bore his name. He once told us
that he knew something about most of us, and there were things that
Raffles had done of which he must have heard. But he only moved his
grizzled head.</p>

<p>"Did you know he was going to give you away?" he asked at
length, with a jerk of it toward the guard-tent.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But you thought it worth while, did you?"</p>

<p>"I thought it necessary, sir."</p>

<p>The General paused, drumming on his table, making up his mind.
Then his chin came up with the decision that we loved in him.</p>

<p>"I shall sift all this," said he. "An officer's name was
mentioned, and I shall see him myself. Meanwhile you had better go
on&mdash;fighting."</p>

<p align="center"><b>4</b>
</p>

<p>Corporal Connal paid the penalty of his crime before the sun was
far above the hill held by the enemy. There was abundance of
circumstantial evidence against him, besides the direct testimony
of Raffles and myself, and the wretch was shot at last with little
ceremony and less shrift. And that was the one good thing that
happened on the day that broke upon us hiding behind the bushes
overlooking the donga; by noon it was my own turn.</p>

<p>I have avoided speaking of my wound before I need, and from the
preceding pages you would not gather that I am more or less lame
for life. You will soon see now why I was in no hurry to recall the
incident. I used to think of a wound received in one's country's
service as the proudest trophy a man could acquire. But the sight
of mine depresses me every morning of my life; it was due for one
thing to my own slow eye for cover, in taking which (to aggravate
my case) our hardy little corps happened to excel.</p>

<p>The bullet went clean through my thigh, drilling the bone, but
happily missing the sciatic nerve; thus the mere pain was less than
it might have been, but of course I went over in a light-brown
heap. We were advancing on our stomachs to take the hill, and thus
extend our position, and it was at this point that the fire became
too heavy for us, so that for hours (in the event) we moved neither
forward nor back. But it was not a minute before Raffles came to me
through the whistling scud, and in another I was on my back behind
a shallow rock, with him kneeling over me and unrolling my bandage
in the teeth of that murderous fire. It was on the knees of the
gods, he said, when I begged him to bend lower, but for the moment
I thought his tone as changed as his face had been earlier in the
morning. To oblige me, however, he took more care; and, when he had
done all that one comrade could for another, he did avail himself
of the cover he had found for me. So there we lay together on the
veldt, under blinding sun and withering fire, and I suppose it is
the veldt that I should describe, as it swims and flickers before
wounded eyes. I shut mine to bring it back, but all that comes is
the keen brown face of Raffles, still a shade paler than its wont;
now bending to sight and fire; now peering to see results, brows
raised, eyes widened; anon turning to me with the word to set my
tight lips grinning. He was talking all the time, but for my sake,
and I knew it. Can you wonder that I could not see an inch beyond
him? He was the battle to me then; he is the whole war to me as I
look back now.</p>

<p>"Feel equal to a cigarette? It will buck you up, Bunny. No, that
one in the silver paper, I've hoarded it for this. Here's a light;
and so Bunny takes the Sullivan! All honor to the sporting
rabbit!"</p>

<p>"At least I went over like one," said I, sending the only clouds
into the blue, and chiefly wishing for their longer endurance. I
was as hot as a cinder from my head to one foot; the other leg was
ceasing to belong to me.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," says Raffles, puckering; "there's a gray felt hat
at deep long-on, and I want to add it to the bag for vengeance....
Wait&mdash;yes&mdash;no, no luck! I must pitch 'em up a bit more.
Hallo! Magazine empty. How goes the Sullivan, Bunny? Rum to be
smoking one on the veldt with a hole in your leg!"</p>

<p>"It's doing me good," I said, and I believe it was. But Raffles
lay looking at me as he lightened his bandolier.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," he said softly, "the day we first began to
think about the war? I can see the pink, misty river light, and
feel the first bite there was in the air when one stood about;
don't you wish we had either here! 'Orful slorter, orful slorter;'
that fellow's face, I see it too; and here we have the thing he
cried. Can you believe it's only six months ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I sighed, enjoying the thought of that afternoon less
than he did; "yes, we were slow to catch fire at first."</p>

<p>"Too slow," he said quickly.</p>

<p>"But when we did catch," I went on, wishing we never had, "we
soon burnt up."</p>

<p>"And then went out," laughed Raffles gayly. He was loaded up
again. "Another over at the gray felt hat," said he; "by Jove,
though, I believe he's having an over at me!"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd be careful," I urged. "I heard it too."</p>

<p>"My dear Bunny, it's on the knees you wot of. If anything's down
in the specifications surely that is. Besides&mdash;that was
nearer!"</p>

<p>"To you?"</p>

<p>"No, to him. Poor devil, he has his specifications too; it's
comforting to think that.... I can't see where that one pitched; it
may have been a wide; and it's very nearly the end of the over
again. Feeling worse, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"No, I've only closed my eyes. Go on talking."</p>

<p>"It was I who let you in for this," he said, at his bandolier
again.</p>

<p>"No, I'm glad I came out."</p>

<p>And I believe I still was, in a way; for it <i>was</i> rather
fine to be wounded, just then, with the pain growing less; but the
sensation was not to last me many minutes, and I can truthfully say
that I have never felt it since.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you haven't had such a good time as I have!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>Had his voice vibrated, or had I imagined it? Pain-waves and
loss of blood were playing tricks with my senses; now they were
quite dull, and my leg alive and throbbing; now I had no leg at
all, but more than all my ordinary senses in every other part of
me. And the devil's orchestra was playing all the time, and all
around me, on every class of fiendish instrument, which you have
been made to hear for yourselves in every newspaper. Yet all that I
heard was Raffles talking.</p>

<p>"I have had a good time, Bunny."</p>

<p>Yes, his voice was sad; but that was all; the vibration must
have been in me.</p>

<p>"I know you have, old chap," said I.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to the General for giving me to-day. It may be
the last. Then I can only say it's been the best&mdash;by
Jove!"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>And I opened my eyes. His were shining. I can see them now.</p>

<p>"Got him&mdash;got the hat! No, I'm hanged if I have; at least
he wasn't in it. The crafty cuss, he must have stuck it up on
purpose. Another over ... scoring's slow.... I wonder if he's
sportsman enough to take a hint? His hat-trick's foolish. Will he
show his face if I show mine?"</p>

<p>I lay with closed ears and eyes. My leg had come to life again,
and the rest of me was numb.</p>

<p>"Bunny!"</p>

<p>His voice sounded higher. He must have been sitting upright.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>But it was not well with me; that was all I thought as my lips
made the word.</p>

<p>"It's not only been the best time I ever had, old Bunny, but I'm
not half sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>Of what I can but guess; the sentence was not finished, and
never could be in this world.</p>
