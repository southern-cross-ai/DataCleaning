<p>George Collingridge was born in England and spent his early
childhood in France. He emigrated to Australia in 1879 to join his
brother, Arthur.</p>

<p>His early work in Australia included drawing and engraving for
newspapers and journals. Later he taught painting and became a self
taught expert in cartography.</p>

<p>The whimsy evident in the engravings of the capital letters
appearing at the beginning of each chapter of the <i>Discovery of
Australia</i> provides an indication of his accomplishment.</p>

<p>Collingridge had a knowledge of 6 languages including English,
French, Portugeseand Spanish.</p>

<p>As an historian he is best known today for his early assertions
of Portuguese discovery of Australia in the 16th century.</p>

<p>The title page of the 1895 edition of The First Discovery of
Australia lists Collingridge as a Member of the Royal Geographical
Society of Australia; Hon. Corresp. Member of the Neuchateloise
Geographical Society, Neuchatel, Switzerland; Hon. Corresp Member
of the Portugese Geographical Society, Lisbon; Hon. Corresp Member
of the Spanish Geographical Society, Madrid&amp;c. &amp;c.; Founder
and First Vice-President of the Art Society of New South Wales.</p>

<p>In 1908 he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of
Santiago by the King of Portugal. In 1917 he was made a Knight
Commander of the Order of Isabella la Catolica by the King of
Spain.</p>
