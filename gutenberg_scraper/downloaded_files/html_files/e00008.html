<h2>Robbery Under Arms
<br><br>
by<br><br>Rolf Boldrewood
</h2>

<hr>
<h2>PREFACE TO NEW EDITION</h2>
<p>I dedicate this 'ower true tale' of the wilder aspects of Australian life to
my old comrade R. Murray Smith, late Agent-General in London for the colony of
Victoria, with hearty thanks for the time and trouble he has devoted to its
publication. I trust it will do no discredit to the rising reputation of
Australian romance. But though presented in the guise of fiction, this
chronicle of the Marston family must not be set down by the reader as wholly
fanciful or exaggerated. Much of the narrative is literally true, as can be
verified by official records. A lifelong residence in Australia may be accepted
as a guarantee for fidelity as to local colour and descriptive detail. I take
this opportunity of acknowledging the prompt and liberal recognition of the
tale by the proprietors of the 'Sydney Mail', but for which it might never have
seen the light.</p>

<h2><b>*</b></h2>
<p>A Story of Life and Adventure in the Bush and in the Goldfields of
Australia</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>My name's Dick Marston, Sydney-side native. I'm twenty-nine years old, six
feet in my stocking soles, and thirteen stone weight. Pretty strong and active
with it, so they say. I don't want to blow&mdash;not here, any road&mdash;but
it takes a good man to put me on my back, or stand up to me with the gloves, or
the naked mauleys. I can ride anything&mdash;anything that ever was lapped in
horsehide&mdash;swim like a musk-duck, and track like a Myall blackfellow. Most
things that a man can do I'm up to, and that's all about it. As I lift myself
now I can feel the muscle swell on my arm like a cricket ball, in spite of
the&mdash;well, in spite of everything.</p>
<p>The morning sun comes shining through the window bars; and ever since he was
up have I been cursing the daylight, cursing myself, and them that brought me
into the world. Did I curse mother, and the hour I was born into this miserable
life?</p>
<p>Why should I curse the day? Why do I lie here, groaning; yes, crying like a
child, and beating my head against the stone floor? I am not mad, though I am
shut up in a cell. No. Better for me if I was. But it's all up now; there's no
get away this time; and I, Dick Marston, as strong as a bullock, as active as a
rock-wallaby, chock-full of life and spirits and health, have been tried for
bush-ranging&mdash;robbery under arms they call it&mdash;and though the blood
runs through my veins like the water in the mountain creeks, and every bit of
bone and sinew is as sound as the day I was born, I must die on the gallows
this day month.</p>
<p>Die&mdash;die&mdash;yes, die; be strung up like a dog, as they say. I'm
blessed if ever I did know of a dog being hanged, though, if it comes to that,
a shot or a bait generally makes an end of 'em in this country. Ha, ha! Did I
laugh? What a rum thing it is that a man should have a laugh in him when he's
only got twenty-nine days more to live&mdash;a day for every year of my life.
Well, laughing or crying, this is what it has come to at last. All the drinking
and recklessness; the flash talk and the idle ways; the merry cross-country
rides that we used to have, night or day, it made no odds to us; every man well
mounted, as like as not on a racehorse in training taken out of his stable
within the week; the sharp brushes with the police, when now and then a man was
wounded on each side, but no one killed. That came later on, worse luck. The
jolly sprees we used to have in the bush townships, where we chucked our money
about like gentlemen, where all the girls had a smile and a kind word for a lot
of game upstanding chaps, that acted like men, if they did keep the road a
little lively. Our 'bush telegraphs' were safe to let us know when the 'traps'
were closing in on us, and then&mdash;why the coach would be 'stuck up' a
hundred miles away, in a different direction, within twenty-four hours.
Marston's gang again! The police are in pursuit! That's what we'd see in the
papers. We had 'em sent to us regular; besides having the pick of 'em when we
cut open the mail bags.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;that chain rubbed a sore, curse it!&mdash;all that racket's
over. It's more than hard to die in this settled, infernal, fixed sort of way,
like a bullock in the killing-yard, all ready to be 'pithed'. I used to pity
them when I was a boy, walking round the yard, pushing their noses through the
rails, trying for a likely place to jump, stamping and pawing and roaring and
knocking their heads against the heavy close rails, with misery and rage in
their eyes, till their time was up. Nobody told <i>them</i> beforehand,
though!</p>
<p>Have I and the likes of me ever felt much the same, I wonder, shut up in a
pen like this, with the rails up, and not a place a rat could creep through,
waiting till our killing time was come? The poor devils of steers have never
done anything but ramble off the run now and again, while we&mdash;but it's too
late to think of that. It <i>is</i> hard. There's no saying it isn't; no, nor
thinking what a fool, what a blind, stupid, thundering idiot a fellow's been,
to laugh at the steady working life that would have helped him up, bit by bit,
to a good farm, a good wife, and innocent little kids about him, like that
chap, George Storefield, that came to see me last week. He was real rightdown
sorry for me, I could tell, though Jim and I used to laugh at him, and call him
a regular old crawler of a milker's calf in the old days. The tears came into
his eyes reg'lar like a woman as he gave my hand a squeeze and turned his head
away. We was little chaps together, you know. A man always feels that, you
know. And old George, he'll go back&mdash;a fifty-mile ride, but what's that on
a good horse? He'll be late home, but he can cross the rock ford the short way
over the creek. I can see him turn his horse loose at the garden-gate, and walk
through the quinces that lead up to the cottage, with his saddle on his arm.
Can't I see it all, as plain as if I was there?</p>
<p>And his wife and the young 'uns 'll run out when they hear father's horse,
and want to hear all the news. When he goes in there's his meal tidy and decent
waiting for him, while he tells them about the poor chap he's been to see as is
to be scragged next month. Ha! ha! what a rum joke it is, isn't it?</p>
<p>And then he'll go out in the verandah, with the roses growin' all over the
posts and smellin' sweet in the cool night air. After that he'll have his
smoke, and sit there thinkin' about me, perhaps, and old days, and what not,
till all hours&mdash;till his wife comes and fetches him in. And here I
lie&mdash;my God! why didn't they knock me on the head when I was born, like a
lamb in a dry season, or a blind puppy&mdash;blind enough, God knows! They do
so in some countries, if the books say true, and what a hell of misery that
must save some people from!</p>
<p>Well, it's done now, and there's no get away. I may as well make the best of
it. A sergeant of police was shot in our last scrimmage, and they must fit some
one over that. It's only natural. He was rash, or Starlight would never have
dropped him that day. Not if he'd been sober either. We'd been drinking all
night at that Willow Tree shanty. Bad grog, too! When a man's half drunk he's
fit for any devilment that comes before him. Drink! How do you think a chap
that's taken to the bush&mdash;regularly turned out, I mean, with a price on
his head, and a fire burning in his heart night and day&mdash;can stand his
life if he don't drink? When he thinks of what he might have been, and what he
is! Why, nearly every man he meets is paid to run him down, or trap him some
way like a stray dog that's taken to sheep-killin'. He knows a score of men,
and women too, that are only looking out for a chance to sell his blood on the
quiet and pouch the money. Do you think that makes a chap mad and miserable,
and tired of his life, or not? And if a drop of grog will take him right out of
his wretched self for a bit why shouldn't he drink? People don't know what they
are talking about. Why, he is that miserable that he wonders why he don't hang
himself, and save the Government all the trouble; and if a few nobblers make
him feel as if he might have some good chances yet, and that it doesn't so much
matter after all, why shouldn't he drink?</p>
<p>He does drink, of course; every miserable man, and a good many women as have
something to fear or repent of, drink. The worst of it is that too much of it
brings on the 'horrors', and then the devil, instead of giving you a jog now
and then, sends one of his imps to grin in your face and pull your heartstrings
all day and all night long. By George, I'm getting clever&mdash;too clever,
altogether, I think. If I could forget for one moment, in the middle of all the
nonsense, that I was to die on Thursday three weeks! die on Thursday three
weeks! die on Thursday! That's the way the time runs in my ears like a chime of
bells. But it's all mere bosh I've been reading these long six months I've been
chained up here&mdash;after I was committed for trial. When I came out of the
hospital after curing me of that wound&mdash;for I was hit bad by that black
tracker&mdash;they gave me some books to read for fear I'd go mad and cheat the
hangman. I was always fond of reading, and many a night I've read to poor old
mother and Aileen before I left the old place. I was that weak and low, after I
took the turn, and I felt glad to get a book to take me away from sitting,
staring, and blinking at nothing by the hour together. It was all very well
then; I was too weak to think much. But when I began to get well again I kept
always coming across something in the book that made me groan or cry out, as if
some one had stuck a knife in me. A dark chap did once&mdash;through the
ribs&mdash;it didn't feel so bad, a little sharpish at first; why didn't he aim
a bit higher? He never was no good, even at that. As I was saying, there'd be
something about a horse, or the country, or the spring weather&mdash;it's just
coming in now, and the Indian corn's shooting after the rain, and <i>I'll</i>
never see it; or they'd put in a bit about the cows walking through the river
in the hot summer afternoons; or they'd go describing about a girl, until I
began to think of sister Aileen again; then I'd run my head against the wall,
or do something like a madman, and they'd stop the books for a week; and I'd be
as miserable as a bandicoot, worse and worse a lot, with all the devil's tricks
and bad thoughts in my head, and nothing to put them away.</p>
<p>I must either kill myself, or get something to fill up my time till the
day&mdash;yes, the day comes. I've always been a middling writer, tho' I can't
say much for the grammar, and spelling, and that, but I'll put it all down,
from the beginning to the end, and maybe it'll save some other unfortunate
young chap from pulling back like a colt when he's first roped, setting himself
against everything in the way of proper breaking, making a fool of himself
generally, and choking himself down, as I've done.</p>
<p>The gaoler&mdash;he looks hard&mdash;he has to do that, there's more than
one or two within here that would have him by the throat, with his heart's
blood running, in half a minute, if they had their way, and the warder was off
guard. He knows that very well. But he's not a bad-hearted chap.</p>
<p>'You can have books, or paper and pens, anything you like,' he said, 'you
unfortunate young beggar, until you're turned off.'</p>
<p>'If I'd only had you to see after me when I was young,' says I&mdash;</p>
<p>'Come; don't whine,' he said, then he burst out laughing. 'You didn't mean
it, I see. I ought to have known better. You're not one of that sort, and I
like you all the better for it.'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>Well, here goes. Lots of pens, a big bottle of ink, and ever so much
foolscap paper, the right sort for me, or I shouldn't have been here. I'm
blessed if it doesn't look as if I was going to write copies again. Don't I
remember how I used to go to school in old times; the rides there and back on
the old pony; and pretty little Grace Storefield that I was so fond of, and
used to show her how to do her lessons. I believe I learned more that way than
if I'd had only myself to think about. There was another girl, the daughter of
the poundkeeper, that I wanted her to beat; and the way we both worked, and I
coached her up, was a caution. And she did get above her in her class. How
proud we were! She gave me a kiss, too, and a bit of her hair. Poor Gracey! I
wonder where she is now, and what she'd think if she saw me here to-day. If I
could have looked ahead, and seen myself&mdash;chained now like a dog, and
going to die a dog's death this day month!</p>
<p>Anyhow, I must make a start. How do people begin when they set to work to
write their own sayings and doings? There's been a deal more doing than talking
in my life&mdash;it was the wrong sort&mdash;more's the pity.</p>
<p>Well, let's see; his parents were poor, but respectable. That's what they
always say. My parents were poor, and mother was as good a soul as ever broke
bread, and wouldn't have taken a shilling's worth that wasn't her own if she'd
been starving. But as for father, he'd been a poacher in England, a
Lincolnshire man he was, and got sent out for it. He wasn't much more than a
boy, he said, and it was only for a hare or two, which didn't seem much. But I
begin to think, being able to see the right of things a bit now, and having no
bad grog inside of me to turn a fellow's head upside down, as poaching must be
something like cattle and horse duffing&mdash;not the worst thing in the world
itself, but mighty likely to lead to it.</p>
<p>Dad had always been a hard-working, steady-going sort of chap, good at most
things, and like a lot more of the Government men, as the convicts were always
called round our part, he saved some money as soon as he had done his time, and
married mother, who was a simple emigrant girl just out from Ireland. Father
was a square-built, good-looking chap, I believe, then; not so tall as I am by
three inches, but wonderfully strong and quick on his pins. They did say as he
could hammer any man in the district before he got old and stiff. I never saw
him 'shape' but once, and then he rolled into a man big enough to eat him, and
polished him off in a way that showed me&mdash;though I was a bit of a boy
then&mdash;that he'd been at the game before. He didn't ride so bad either,
though he hadn't had much of it where he came from; but he was afraid of
nothing, and had a quiet way with colts. He could make pretty good play in
thick country, and ride a roughish horse, too.</p>
<p>Well, our farm was on a good little flat, with a big mountain in front, and
a scrubby, rangy country at the back for miles. People often asked him why he
chose such a place. 'It suits me,' he used to say, with a laugh, and talk of
something else. We could only raise about enough corn and potatoes, in a
general way, for ourselves from the flat; but there were other chances and
pickings which helped to make the pot boil, and them we'd have been a deal
better without.</p>
<p>First of all, though our cultivation paddock was small, and the good land
seemed squeezed in between the hills, there was a narrow tract up the creek,
and here it widened out into a large well-grassed flat. This was where our
cattle ran, for, of course, we had a team of workers and a few milkers when we
came. No one ever took up a farm in those days without a dray and a team, a
year's rations, a few horses and milkers, pigs and fowls, and a little
furniture. They didn't collar a 40-acre selection, as they do now&mdash;spend
all their money in getting the land and squat down as bare as robins&mdash;a
man with his wife and children all under a sheet of bark, nothing on their
backs, and very little in their bellies. However, some of them do pretty well,
though they do say they have to live on 'possums for a time. We didn't do much,
in spite of our grand start.</p>
<p>The flat was well enough, but there were other places in the gullies beyond
that that father had dropped upon when he was out shooting. He was a tremendous
chap for poking about on foot or on horseback, and though he was an Englishman,
he was what you call a born bushman. I never saw any man almost as was his
equal. Wherever he'd been once, there he could take you to again; and what was
more, if it was in the dead of the night he could do it just the same. People
said he was as good as a blackfellow, but I never saw one that was as good as
he was, all round. In a strange country, too. That was what beat me&mdash;he'd
know the way the creek run, and noticed when the cattle headed to camp, and a
lot of things that other people couldn't see, or if they did, couldn't remember
again. He was a great man for solitary walks, too&mdash;he and an old dog he
had, called Crib, a cross-bred mongrel-looking brute, most like what they call
a lurcher in England, father said. Anyhow, he could do most anything but talk.
He could bite to some purpose, drive cattle or sheep, catch a kangaroo, if it
wasn't a regular flyer, fight like a bulldog, and swim like a retriever, track
anything, and fetch and carry, but bark he wouldn't. He'd stand and look at dad
as if he worshipped him, and he'd make him some sign and off he'd go like a
child that's got a message. Why he was so fond of the old man we boys couldn't
make out. We were afraid of him, and as far as we could see he never patted or
made much of Crib. He thrashed him unmerciful as he did us boys. Still the dog
was that fond of him you'd think he'd like to die for him there and then. But
dogs are not like boys, or men either&mdash;better, perhaps.</p>
<p>Well, we were all born at the hut by the creek, I suppose, for I remember it
as soon as I could remember anything. It was a snug hut enough, for father was
a good bush carpenter, and didn't turn his back to any one for splitting and
fencing, hut-building and shingle-splitting; he had had a year or two at
sawing, too, but after he was married he dropped that. But I've heard mother
say that he took great pride in the hut when he brought her to it first, and
said it was the best-built hut within fifty miles. He split every slab, cut
every post and wallplate and rafter himself, with a man to help him at odd
times; and after the frame was up, and the bark on the roof, he camped
underneath and finished every bit of it&mdash;chimney, flooring, doors,
windows, and partitions&mdash;by himself. Then he dug up a little garden in
front, and planted a dozen or two peaches and quinces in it; put a couple of
roses&mdash;a red and a white one&mdash;by the posts of the verandah, and it
was all ready for his pretty Norah, as she says he used to call her then. If
I've heard her tell about the garden and the quince trees and the two roses
once, I've heard her tell it a hundred times. Poor mother! we used to get round
her&mdash;Aileen, and Jim, and I&mdash;and say, 'Tell us about the garden,
mother.' She'd never refuse; those were her happy days, she always said. She
used to cry afterwards&mdash;nearly always.</p>
<p>The first thing almost that I can remember was riding the old pony, 'Possum,
out to bring in the milkers. Father was away somewhere, so mother took us all
out and put me on the pony, and let me have a whip. Aileen walked alongside,
and very proud I was. My legs stuck out straight on the old pony's fat back.
Mother had ridden him up when she came&mdash;the first horse she ever rode, she
said. He was a quiet little old roan, with a bright eye and legs like
gate-posts, but he never fell down with us boys, for all that. If we fell off
he stopped still and began to feed, so that he suited us all to pieces. We soon
got sharp enough to flail him along with a quince stick, and we used to bring
up the milkers, I expect, a good deal faster than was good for them. After a
bit we could milk, leg-rope, and bail up for ourselves, and help dad brand the
calves, which began to come pretty thick. There were only three of us
children&mdash;my brother Jim, who was two years younger than I was, and then
Aileen, who was four years behind him. I know we were both able to nurse the
baby a while after she came, and neither of us wanted better fun than to be
allowed to watch her, or rock the cradle, or as a great treat to carry her a
few steps. Somehow we was that fond and proud of her from the first that we'd
have done anything in the world for her. And so we would now&mdash;I was going
to say&mdash;but that poor Jim lies under a forest oak on a sandhill, and
I&mdash;well, I'm here, and if I'd listened to her advice I should have been a
free man. A free man! How it sounds, doesn't it? with the sun shining, and the
blue sky over your head, and the birds twittering, and the grass beneath your
feet! I wonder if I shall go mad before my time's up.</p>
<p>Mother was a Roman Catholic&mdash;most Irishwomen are; and dad was a
Protestant, if he was anything. However, that says nothing. People that don't
talk much about their religion, or follow it up at all, won't change it for all
that. So father, though mother tried him hard enough when they were first
married, wouldn't hear of turning, not if he was to be killed for it, as I once
heard him say. 'No!' he says, 'my father and grandfather, and all the lot, was
Church people, and so I shall live and die. I don't know as it would make much
matter to me, but such as my notions is, I shall stick to 'em as long as the
craft holds together. You can bring up the girl in your own way; it's made a
good woman of you, or found you one, which is most likely, and so she may take
her chance. But I stand for Church and King, and so shall the boys, as sure as
my name's Ben Marston.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Father was one of those people that gets shut of a deal of trouble in this
world by always sticking to one thing. If he said he'd do this or that he
always did it and nothing else. As for turning him, a wild bull half-way down a
range was a likelier try-on. So nobody ever bothered him after he'd once opened
his mouth. They knew it was so much lost labour. I sometimes thought Aileen was
a bit like him in her way of sticking to things. But then she was always right,
you see.</p>
<p>So that clinched it. Mother gave in like a wise woman, as she was. The
clergyman from Bargo came one day and christened me and Jim&mdash;made one job
of it. But mother took Aileen herself in the spring cart all the way to the
township and had her christened in the chapel, in the middle of the service all
right and regular, by Father Roche.</p>
<p>There's good and bad of every sort, and I've met plenty that were no chop of
all churches; but if Father Roche, or Father anybody else, had any hand in
making mother and Aileen half as good as they were, I'd turn to-morrow, if I
ever got out again. I don't suppose it was the religion that made much
difference in our case, for Patsey Daly and his three brothers, that lived on
the creek higher up, were as much on the cross as men could be, and many a time
I've seen them ride to chapel and attend mass, and look as if they'd never seen
a 'clearskin' in their lives. Patsey was hanged afterwards for bush-ranging and
gold robbery, and he had more than one man's blood to answer for. Now we
weren't like that; we never troubled the church one way or the other. We knew
we were doing what we oughtn't to do, and scorned to look pious and keep two
faces under one hood.</p>
<p>By degrees we all grew older, began to be active and able to do half a man's
work. We learned to ride pretty well&mdash;at least, that is we could ride a
bare-backed horse at full gallop through timber or down a range; could back a
colt just caught and have him as quiet as an old cow in a week. We could use
the axe and the cross-cut saw, for father dropped that sort of work himself,
and made Jim and I do all the rough jobs of mending the fences, getting
firewood, milking the cows, and, after a bit, ploughing the bit of flat we kept
in cultivation.</p>
<p>Jim and I, when we were fifteen and thirteen&mdash;he was bigger for his age
than I was, and so near my own strength that I didn't care about touching
him&mdash;were the smartest lads on the creek, father said&mdash;he didn't
often praise us, either. We had often ridden over to help at the muster of the
large cattle stations that were on the side of the range, and not more than
twenty or thirty miles from us.</p>
<p>Some of our young stock used to stray among the squatters' cattle, and we
liked attending the muster because there was plenty of galloping about and
cutting out, and fun in the men's hut at night, and often a half-crown or so
for helping some one away with a big mob of cattle or a lot for the pound.
Father didn't go himself, and I used to notice that whenever we came up and
said we were Ben Marston's boys both master and super looked rather glum, and
then appeared not to think any more about it. I heard the owner of one of these
stations say to his managing man, 'Pity, isn't it? fine boys, too.' I didn't
understand what they meant. I do now.</p>
<p>We could do a few things besides riding, because, as I told you before, we
had been to a bit of a school kept by an old chap that had once seen better
days, that lived three miles off, near a little bush township. This village,
like most of these places, had a public-house and a blacksmith's shop. That was
about all. The publican kept the store, and managed pretty well to get hold of
all the money that was made by the people round about, that is of those that
were 'good drinking men'. He had half-a-dozen children, and, though he was not
up to much, he wasn't that bad that he didn't want his children to have the
chance of being better than himself. I've seen a good many crooked people in my
day, but very few that, though they'd given themselves up as a bad job, didn't
hope a bit that their youngsters mightn't take after them. Curious, isn't it?
But it is true, I can tell you. So Lammerby, the publican, though he was a
greedy, sly sort of fellow, that bought things he knew were stolen, and lent
out money and charged everybody two prices for the things he sold 'em, didn't
like the thought of his children growing up like Myall cattle, as he said
himself, and so he fished out this old Mr. Howard, that had been a friend or a
victim or some kind of pal of his in old times, near Sydney, and got him to
come and keep school.</p>
<p>He was a curious man, this Mr. Howard. What he had been or done none of us
ever knew, but he spoke up to one of the squatters that said something sharp to
him one day in a way that showed us boys that he thought himself as good as he
was. And he stood up straight and looked him in the face, till we hardly could
think he was the same man that was so bent and shambling and
broken-down-looking most times. He used to live in a little hut in the township
all by himself. It was just big enough to hold him and us at our lessons. He
had his dinner at the inn, along with Mr. and Mrs. Lammerby. She was always
kind to him, and made him puddings and things when he was ill. He was pretty
often ill, and then he'd hear us our lessons at the bedside, and make a short
day of it.</p>
<p>Mostly he drank nothing but tea. He used to smoke a good deal out of a big
meerschaum pipe with figures on it that he used to show us when he was in a
good humour. But two or three times a year he used to set-to and drink for a
week, and then school was left off till he was right. We didn't think much of
that. Everybody, almost, that we knew did the same&mdash;all the
men&mdash;nearly all, that is&mdash;and some of the women&mdash;not mother,
though; she wouldn't have touched a drop of wine or spirits to save her life,
and never did to her dying day. We just thought of it as if they'd got a touch
of fever or sunstroke, or broke a rib or something. They'd get over it in a
week or two, and be all right again.</p>
<p>All the same, poor old Mr. Howard wasn't always on the booze, not by any
manner of means. He never touched a drop of anything, not even ginger-beer,
while he was straight, and he kept us all going from nine o'clock in the
morning till three in the afternoon, summer and winter, for more than six
years. Then he died, poor old chap&mdash;found dead in his bed one morning.
Many a basting he gave me and Jim with an old malacca cane he had with a silver
knob to it. We were all pretty frightened of him. He'd say to me and Jim and
the other boys, 'It's the best chance of making men of yourselves you ever had,
if you only knew it. You'll be rich farmers or settlers, perhaps magistrates,
one of these days&mdash;that is, if you're not hanged. It's you, I mean,' he'd
say, pointing to me and Jim and the Dalys; 'I believe some of you <i>will</i>
be hanged unless you change a good deal. It's cold blood and bad blood that
runs in your veins, and you'll come to earn the wages of sin some day. It's a
strange thing,' he used to say, as if he was talking to himself, 'that the
girls are so good, while the boys are delivered over to the Evil One, except a
case here and there. Look at Mary Darcy and Jane Lammerby, and my little pet
Aileen here. I defy any village in Britain to turn out such girls&mdash;plenty
of rosy-cheeked gigglers&mdash;but the natural refinement and intelligence of
these little damsels astonishes me.'</p>
<p>Well, the old man died suddenly, as I said, and we were all very sorry, and
the school was broken up. But he had taught us all to write fairly and to keep
accounts, to read and spell decently, and to know a little geography. It wasn't
a great deal, but what we knew we knew well, and I often think of what he said,
now it's too late, we ought to have made better use of it. After school broke
up father said Jim and I knew quite as much as was likely to be any good to us,
and we must work for our living like other people. We'd always done a pretty
fair share of that, and our hands were hard with using the axe and the spade,
let alone holding the plough at odd times and harrowing, helping father to kill
and brand, and a lot of other things, besides getting up while the stars were
in the sky so as to get the cows milked early, before it was time to go to
school.</p>
<p>All this time we had lived in a free kind of way&mdash;we wanted for
nothing. We had plenty of good beef, and a calf now and then. About this time I
began to wonder how it was that so many cattle and horses passed through
father's hands, and what became of them.</p>
<p>I hadn't lived all my life on Rocky Creek, and among some of the smartest
hands in that line that old New South Wales ever bred, without knowing what
'clearskins' and 'cross' beasts meant, and being well aware that our brand was
often put on a calf that no cow of ours ever suckled. Don't I remember well the
first calf I ever helped to put our letters on? I've often wished I'd defied
father, then taken my licking, and bolted away from home. It's that very calf
and the things it led to that's helped to put me where I am!</p>
<p>Just as I sit here, and these cursed irons rattle whenever I move my feet, I
can see that very evening, and father and the old dog with a little mob of our
crawling cattle and half-a-dozen head of strangers, cows and calves, and a fat
little steer coming through the scrub to the old stockyard.</p>
<p>It was an awkward place for a yard, people used to say; scrubby and stony
all round, a blind sort of hole&mdash;you couldn't see till you were right on
the top of it. But there was a 'wing' ran out a good way through the
scrub&mdash;there's no better guide to a yard like that&mdash;and there was a
sort of track cattle followed easy enough once you were round the hill. Anyhow,
between father and the dog and the old mare he always rode, very few beasts
ever broke away.</p>
<p>These strange cattle had been driven a good way, I could see. The cows and
calves looked done up, and the steer's tongue was out&mdash;it was hottish
weather; the old dog had been 'heeling' him up too, for he was bleeding up to
the hocks, and the end of his tail was bitten off. He was a savage old wretch
was Crib. Like all dogs that never bark&mdash;and men too&mdash;his bite was
all the worse.</p>
<p>'Go and get the brands&mdash;confound you&mdash;don't stand there
frightening the cattle,' says father, as the tired cattle, after smelling and
jostling a bit, rushed into the yard. 'You, Jim, make a fire, and look sharp
about it. I want to brand old Polly's calf and another or two.' Father came
down to the hut while the brands were getting ready, and began to look at the
harness-cask, which stood in a little back skillion. It was pretty empty; we
had been living on eggs, bacon, and bread and butter for a week.</p>
<p>'Oh, mother! there's such a pretty red calf in the yard,' I said, 'with a
star and a white spot on the flank; and there's a yellow steer fat enough to
kill!'</p>
<p>'What!' said mother, turning round and looking at father with her eyes
staring&mdash;a sort of dark blue they were&mdash;people used to say mine and
Jim's were the same colour&mdash;and her brown hair pushed back off her face,
as if she was looking at a ghost. 'Is it doing that again you are, after all
you promised me, and you so nearly caught&mdash;after the last one? Didn't I go
on my knees to ye to ask ye to drop it and lead a good life, and didn't ye tell
me ye'd never do the like again? And the poor innocent children, too, I wonder
ye've the heart to do it.'</p>
<p>It came into my head now to wonder why the sergeant and two policemen had
come down from Bargo, very early in the morning, about three months ago, and
asked father to show them the beef in his cask, and the hide belonging to it. I
wondered at the time the beast was killed why father made the hide into a rope,
and before he did that had cut out the brand and dropped it into a hot fire.
The police saw a hide with our brand on, all right&mdash;killed about a
fortnight. They didn't know it had been taken off a cancered bullock, and that
father took the trouble to 'stick' him and bleed him before he took the hide
off, so as it shouldn't look dark. Father certainly knew most things in the way
of working on the cross. I can see now he'd have made his money a deal easier,
and no trouble of mind, if he'd only chosen to go straight.</p>
<p>When mother said this, father looked at her for a bit as if he was sorry for
it; then he straightened himself up, and an ugly look came into his face as he
growled out&mdash;</p>
<p>'You mind your own business; we must live as well as other people. There's
squatters here that does as bad. They're just like the squires at home; think a
poor man hasn't a right to live. You bring the brand and look alive, Dick, or
I'll sharpen ye up a bit.'</p>
<p>The brand was in the corner, but mother got between me and it, and stretched
out her hand to father as if to stop me and him.</p>
<p>'In God's name,' she cried out, 'aren't ye satisfied with losing your own
soul and bringing disgrace upon your family, but ye must be the ruin of your
innocent children? Don't touch the brand, Dick!'</p>
<p>But father wasn't a man to be crossed, and what made it worse he had a
couple of glasses of bad grog in him. There was an old villain of a
shanty-keeper that lived on a back creek. He'd been there as he came by and had
a glass or two. He had a regular savage temper, father had, though he was quiet
enough and not bad to us when he was right. But the grog always spoiled
him.</p>
<p>He gave poor mother a shove which sent her reeling against the wall, where
she fell down and hit her head against the stool, and lay there. Aileen,
sitting down in the corner, turned white, and began to cry, while father
catches me a box on the ear which sends me kicking, picks up the brand out of
the corner, and walks out, with me after him.</p>
<p>I think if I'd been another year or so older I'd have struck back&mdash;I
felt that savage about poor mother that I could have gone at him
myself&mdash;but we had been too long used to do everything he told us; and
somehow, even if a chap's father's a bad one, he don't seem like other men to
him. So, as Jim had lighted the fire, we branded the little red heifer calf
first&mdash;a fine fat six-months-old nugget she was&mdash;and then three bull
calves, all strangers, and then Polly's calf, I suppose just for a blind. Jim
and I knew the four calves were all strangers, but we didn't know the brands of
the mothers; they all seemed different.</p>
<p>After this all was made right to kill a beast. The gallows was ready rigged
in a corner of the yard; father brought his gun and shot the yellow steer. The
calves were put into our calf-pen&mdash;Polly's and all&mdash;and all the cows
turned out to go where they liked.</p>
<p>We helped father to skin and hang up the beast, and pretty late it was when
we finished. Mother had laid us out our tea and gone to bed with Aileen. We had
ours and then went to bed. Father sat outside and smoked in the starlight.
Hours after I woke up and heard mother crying. Before daylight we were up
again, and the steer was cut up and salted and in the harness-cask soon after
sunrise. His head and feet were all popped into a big pot where we used to make
soup for the pigs, and by the time it had been boiling an hour or two there was
no fear of any one swearing to the yellow steer by 'head-mark'.</p>
<p>We had a hearty breakfast off the 'skirt', but mother wouldn't touch a bit,
nor let Aileen take any; she took nothing but a bit of bread and a cup of tea,
and sat there looking miserable and downcast. Father said nothing, but sat very
dark-looking, and ate his food as if nothing was the matter. After breakfast he
took his mare, the old dog followed; there was no need to whistle for
him&mdash;it's my belief he knew more than many a Christian&mdash;and away they
went. Father didn't come home for a week&mdash;he had got into the habit of
staying away for days and days together. Then things went on the old way.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>So the years went on&mdash;slow enough they seemed to us sometimes&mdash;the
green winters, pretty cold, I tell you, with frost and hail-storms, and the
long hot summers. We were not called boys any longer, except by mother and
Aileen, but took our places among the men of the district. We lived mostly at
home, in the old way; sometimes working pretty hard, sometimes doing very
little. When the cows were milked and the wood chopped, there was nothing to do
for the rest of the day. The creek was that close that mother used to go and
dip the bucket into it herself, when she wanted one, from a little wooden step
above the clear reedy waterhole.</p>
<p>Now and then we used to dig in the garden. There was reaping and
corn-pulling and husking for part of the year; but often, for weeks at a time,
there was next to nothing to do. No hunting worth much&mdash;we were sick of
kangarooing, like the dogs themselves, that as they grew old would run a little
way and then pull up if a mob came, jump, jump, past them. No shooting, except
a few ducks and pigeons. Father used to laugh at the shooting in this country,
and say they'd never have poachers here&mdash;the game wasn't worth it. No
fishing, except an odd codfish, in the deepest waterholes; and you might sit
half a day without a bite.</p>
<p>Now this was very bad for us boys. Lads want plenty of work, and a little
play now and then to keep them straight. If there's none, they'll make it; and
you can't tell how far they'll go when they once start.</p>
<p>Well, Jim and I used to get our horses and ride off quietly in the
afternoon, as if we were going after cattle; but, in reality, as soon as we
were out of sight of mother, to ride over to that old villain, Grimes, the
shanty-keeper, where we met the young Dalys, and others of the same
sort&mdash;talked a good deal of nonsense and gossip; what was worse played at
all-fours and euchre, which we had learned from an American harvest hand, at
one of the large farms.</p>
<p>Besides playing for money, which put us rather into trouble sometimes, as we
couldn't always find a half-crown if we lost it, we learned another bad habit,
and that was to drink spirits. What burning nasty stuff I thought it at first;
and so did we all! But every one wanted to be thought a man, and up to all
kinds of wickedness, so we used to make it a point of drinking our nobbler, and
sometimes treating the others twice, if we had cash.</p>
<p>There was another family that lived a couple of miles off, higher up the
creek, and we had always been good friends with them, though they never came to
our house, and only we boys went to theirs. They were the parents of the little
girl that went to school with us, and a boy who was a year older than me.</p>
<p>Their father had been a gardener at home, and he married a native girl who
was born somewhere about the Hawkesbury, near Windsor. Her father had been a
farmer, and many a time she told us how sorry she was to go away from the old
place, and what fine corn and pumpkins they grew; and how they had a church at
Windsor, and used to take their hay and fruit and potatoes to Sydney, and what
a grand place Sydney was, with stone buildings called markets for people to
sell fruit and vegetables and poultry in; and how you could walk down into
Lower George Street and see Sydney Harbour, a great shining salt-water plain, a
thousand times as big as the biggest waterhole, with ships and boats and
sailors, and every kind of strange thing upon it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Storefield was pretty fond of talking, and she was always fond of me,
because once when she was out after the cows, and her man was away, and she had
left Grace at home, the little thing crawled down to the waterhole and tumbled
in. I happened to be riding up with a message for mother, to borrow some soap,
when I heard a little cry like a lamb's, and there was poor little Gracey
struggling in the water like a drowning kitten, with her face under. Another
minute or two would have finished her, but I was off the old pony and into the
water like a teal flapper. I had her out in a second or two, and she gasped and
cried a bit, but soon came to, and when Mrs. Storefield came home she first
cried over her as if she would break her heart, and kissed her, and then she
kissed me, and said, 'Now, Dick Marston, you look here. Your mother's a good
woman, though simple; your father I don't like, and I hear many stories about
him that makes me think the less we ought to see of the lot of you the better.
But you've saved my child's life to-day, and I'll be a friend and a mother to
you as long as I live, even if you turn out bad, and I'm rather afraid you
will&mdash;you and Jim both&mdash;but it won't be my fault for want of trying
to keep you straight; and John and I will be your kind and loving friends as
long as we live, no matter what happens.'</p>
<p>After that&mdash;it was strange enough&mdash;but I always took to the little
toddling thing that I'd pulled out of the water. I wasn't very big myself, if
it comes to that, and she seemed to have a feeling about it, for she'd come to
me every time I went there, and sit on my knee and look at me with her big
brown serious eyes&mdash;they were just the same after she grew up&mdash;and
talk to me in her little childish lingo. I believe she knew all about it, for
she used to say, 'Dick pull Gracey out of water;' and then she'd throw her arms
round my neck and kiss me, and walk off to her mother. If I'd let her drown
then, and tied a stone round my neck and dropped through the reeds to the
bottom of the big waterhole, it would have been better for both of us.</p>
<p>When John came home he was nearly as bad as the old woman, and wanted to
give me a filly, but I wouldn't have it, boy as I was. I never cared for money
nor money's worth, and I was not going to be paid for picking a kid out of the
water.</p>
<p>George Storefield, Gracey's brother, was about my own age. He thought a lot
of what I'd done for her, and years afterwards I threatened to punch his head
if he said anything more about it. He laughed, and held out his hand.</p>
<p>'You and I might have been better friends lately,' says he; 'but don't you
forget you've got another brother besides Jim&mdash;one that will stick to you,
too, fair weather or foul.'</p>
<p>I always had a great belief in George, though we didn't get on over well,
and often had fallings out. He was too steady and hardworking altogether for
Jim and me. He worked all day and every day, and saved every penny he made.
Catch him gaffing!&mdash;no, not for a sixpence. He called the Dalys and
Jacksons thieves and swindlers, who would be locked up, or even hanged, some
day, unless they mended themselves. As for drinking a glass of grog, you might
just as soon ask him to take a little laudanum or arsenic.</p>
<p>'Why should I drink grog,' he used to say&mdash;'such stuff, too, as you get
at that old villain Grimes's&mdash;with a good appetite and a good conscience?
I'm afraid of no man; the police may come and live on my ground for what I
care. I work all day, have a read in the evening, and sleep like a top when I
turn in. What do I want more?'</p>
<p>'Oh, but you never see any life,' Jim said; 'you're just like an old working
bullock that walks up to the yoke in the morning and never stops hauling till
he's let go at night. This is a free country, and I don't think a fellow was
born for that kind of thing and nothing else.'</p>
<p>'This country's like any other country, Jim,' George would say, holding up
his head, and looking straight at him with his steady gray eyes; 'a man must
work and save when he's young if he don't want to be a beggar or a slave when
he's old. I believe in a man enjoying himself as well as you do, but my notion
of that is to have a good farm, well stocked and paid for, by and by, and then
to take it easy, perhaps when my back is a little stiffer than it is now.'</p>
<p>'But a man must have a little fun when he is young,' I said. 'What's the use
of having money when you're old and rusty, and can't take pleasure in
anything?'</p>
<p>'A man needn't be so very old at forty,' he says then, 'and twenty years'
steady work will put all of us youngsters well up the ladder. Besides, I don't
call it fun getting half-drunk with a lot of blackguards at a low pothouse or a
shanty, listening to the stupid talk and boasting lies of a pack of loafers and
worse. They're fit for nothing better; but you and Jim are. Now, look here,
I've got a small contract from Mr. Andrews for a lot of fencing stuff. It will
pay us wages and something over. If you like to go in with me, we'll go share
and share. I know what hands you both are at splitting and fencing. What do you
say?'</p>
<p>Jim, poor Jim, was inclined to take George's offer. He was that good-hearted
that a kind word would turn him any time. But I was put out at his laying it
down so about the Dalys and us shantying and gaffing, and I do think now that
some folks are born so as they can't do without a taste of some sort of fun
once in a way. I can't put it out clear, but it ought to be fixed somehow for
us chaps that haven't got the gift of working all day and every day, but can do
two days' work in one when we like, that we should have our allowance of
reasonable fun and pleasure&mdash;that is, what we called pleasure, not what
somebody thinks we ought to take pleasure in. Anyway, I turned on George rather
rough, and I says, 'We're not good enough for the likes of you, Mr. Storefield.
It's very kind of you to think of us, but we'll take our own line and you take
yours.'</p>
<p>'I'm sorry for it, Dick, and more sorry that you take huff at an old friend.
All I want is to do you good, and act a friend's part. Good-bye&mdash;some day
you'll see it.'</p>
<p>'You're hard on George,' says Jim, 'there's no pleasing you to-day; one
would think there were lots of chaps fighting how to give us a lift. Good-bye,
George, old man; I'm sorry we can't wire in with you; we'd soon knock out those
posts and rails on the ironbark range.'</p>
<p>'You'd better stop, Jim, and take a hand in the deal,' says I (or, rather,
the devil, for I believe he gets inside a chap at times), 'and then you and
George can take a turn at local-preaching when you're cut out. I'm off.' So
without another word I jumped on to my horse and went off down the hill, across
the creek, and over the boulders the other side, without much caring where I
was going. The fact was, I felt I had acted meanly in sneering at a man who
only said what he did for my good; and I wasn't at all sure that I hadn't made
a breach between Gracey and myself, and, though I had such a temper when it was
roused that all the world wouldn't have stopped me, every time I thought of not
seeing that girl again made my heart ache as if it would burst.</p>
<p>I was nearly home before I heard the clatter of a horse's feet, and Jim rode
up alongside of me. He was just the same as ever, with a smile on his face. You
didn't often see it without one.</p>
<p>I knew he had come after me, and had given up his own fancy for mine.</p>
<p>'I thought you were going to stay and turn good,' I said. 'Why didn't
you?'</p>
<p>'It might have been better for me if I had,' he said, 'but you know very
well, Dick, that whatever turns up, whether it's for good or evil, you and I go
together.'</p>
<p>We looked at one another for a moment. Our eyes met. We didn't say anything;
but we understood one another as well as if we had talked for a week. We rode
up to the door of our cottage without speaking. The sun had set, and some of
the stars had come out, early as it was, for it was late autumn. Aileen was
sitting on a bench in the verandah reading, mother was working away as usual at
something in the house. Mother couldn't read or write, but you never caught her
sitting with her hands before her. Except when she was asleep I don't think she
ever was quite still.</p>
<p>Aileen ran out to us, and stood while we let go our horses, and brought the
saddles and bridles under the verandah.</p>
<p>'I'm glad you're come home for one thing,' she said. 'There is a message
from father. He wants you to meet him.'</p>
<p>'Who brought it?' I said.</p>
<p>'One of the Dalys&mdash;Patsey, I think.'</p>
<p>'All right,' said Jim, kissing her as he lifted her up in his great strong
arms. 'I must go in and have a gossip with the old woman. Aileen can tell me
after tea. I daresay it's not so good that it won't keep.'</p>
<p>Mother was that fond of both of us that I believe, as sure as I sit here,
she'd have put her head on the block, or died in any other way for either of
her boys, not because it was her duty, but glad and cheerful like, to have
saved us from death or disgrace. I think she was fonder of us two than she was
of Aileen. Mothers are generally fonder of their sons. Why I never could see;
and if she thought more of one than the other it was Jim. He was the youngest,
and he had that kind of big, frolicsome, loving way with him, like a
Newfoundland pup about half-grown. I always used to think, somehow, nobody ever
seemed to be able to get into a pelter with Jim, not even father, and that was
a thing as some people couldn't be got to believe. As for mother and Aileen,
they were as fond of him as if he'd been a big baby.</p>
<p>So while he went to sit down on the stretcher, and let mother put her arms
round his neck and hug him and cry over him, as she always did if he'd been
away more than a day or two, I took a walk down the creek with Aileen in the
starlight, to hear all about this message from father. Besides, I could see
that she was very serious over it, and I thought there might be something in it
more than common.</p>
<p>'First of all, did you make any agreement with George Storefield?' she
said.</p>
<p>'No; why should I? Has he been talking to you about me? What right has he to
meddle with my business?'</p>
<p>'Oh, Dick, don't talk like that. Anything that he said was only to do you a
kindness, and Jim.'</p>
<p>'Hang him, and his kindness too,' I said. 'Let him keep it for those that
want it. But what did he tell you?'</p>
<p>'He said, first of all,' answered poor Aileen, with the tears in her eyes,
and trying to take hold of my hand, 'that he had a contract for fencing timber,
which he had taken at good prices, which he would share with you and Jim; that
he knew you two and himself could finish it in a few weeks, and that he
expected to get the contract for the timber for the new bridge at Dargo, which
he would let you go shares in too. He didn't like to speak about that, because
it wasn't certain; but he had calculated all the quantities and prices, and he
was sure you would make &pound;70 or &pound;80 each before Christmas. Now, was
there any harm in that; and don't you think it was very good of him to think of
it?'</p>
<p>'Well, he's not a bad fellow, old George,' I said, 'but he's a little too
fond of interfering with other people's business. Jim and I are quite able to
manage our own affairs, as I told him this evening, when I refused to have
anything to do with his fencing arrangement.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Dick, did you?' she said. 'What a pity! I made sure Jim would have
liked it so, for only last week he said he was sick and tired of having nothing
to do&mdash;that he should soon lose all his knack at using tools that he used
to be so proud of. Didn't he say he'd like to join George?'</p>
<p>'He would, I daresay, and I told him to do as he liked. I came away by
myself, and only saw him just before we crossed the range. He's big enough and
old enough to take his own line.'</p>
<p>'But you know he thinks so much of you,' she groaned out, 'that he'd follow
you to destruction. That will be the end of it, depend upon it, Dick. I tell
you so now; you've taken to bad ways; you'll have his blood on your head
yet.'</p>
<p>'Jim's old enough and big enough to take care of himself,' I said sulkily.
'If he likes to come my way I won't hinder him; I won't try to persuade him one
way or the other. Let him take his own line; I don't believe in preaching and
old women's talk. Let a man act and think for himself.'</p>
<p>'You'll break my heart and poor mother's, too,' said Aileen, suddenly taking
both my hands in hers. 'What has she done but love us ever since we were born,
and what does she live for? You know she has no pleasure of any kind, you know
she's afraid every morning she wakes that the police will get father for some
of his cross doings; and now you and Jim are going the same wild way, and what
ever&mdash;what ever will be the end of it?'</p>
<p>Here she let go my hands, and sobbed and cried as if she was a child again,
much as I remember her doing one day when my kangaroo dog killed her favourite
cat. And Aileen was a girl that didn't cry much generally, and never about
anything that happened to herself; it was always about somebody else and their
misfortunes. She was a quiet girl, too, very determined, and not much given to
talking about what she was going to do; but when she made up her mind she was
sure to stick to it. I used to think she was more like father than any of us.
She had his coloured hair and eyes, and his way of standing and looking, as if
the whole world wouldn't shift him. But she'd mother's soft heart for all that,
and I took the more notice of her crying and whimpering this time because it
was so strange for her.</p>
<p>If any one could have seen straight into my heart just then I was regularly
knocked over, and had two minds to go inside to Jim and tell him we'd take
George's splitting job, and start to tackle it first thing to-morrow morning;
but just then one of those confounded night-hawks flitted on a dead tree before
us and began his 'hoo-ho', as if it was laughing at me. I can see the place
now&mdash;the mountain black and dismal, the moon low and strange-looking, the
little waterhole glittering in the half-light, and this dark bird hooting away
in the night. An odd feeling seemed to come over my mind, and if it had been
the devil himself standing on the dead limb it could not have had a worse
effect on me as I stopped there, uncertain whether to turn to the right or the
left.</p>
<p>We don't often know in this world sometimes whether we are turning off along
a road where we shall never come back from, or whether we can go just a little
way and look at the far-off hills and new rivers, and come home safe.</p>
<p>I remember the whole lot of bad-meaning thoughts coming with a rush over my
heart, and I laughed at myself for being so soft as to choose a hard-working,
pokey kind of life at the word of a slow fellow like George, when I might be
riding about the country on a fine horse, eating and drinking of the best, and
only doing what people said half the old settlers had made their money by.</p>
<p>Poor Aileen told me afterwards that if she'd thought for a moment I could be
turned she'd have gone down on her knees and never got up till I promised to
keep straight and begin to work at honest daily labour like a man&mdash;like a
man who hoped to end his days in a good house, on a good farm, with a good wife
and nice children round him, and not in a prison cell. Some people would call
the first, after years of honest work, and being always able to look every one
in the face, being more of a man than the other. But people have different ways
and different ideas.</p>
<p>'Come, Ailie,' I said, 'are you going to whine and cry all night? I shall be
afraid to come home if you're going to be like this. What's the message from
father?'</p>
<p>She wiped away her tears, and, putting her hand on my shoulder, looked
steadily into my face.</p>
<p>'Poor boy&mdash;poor, dear Dick,' she said, 'I feel as if I should see that
fresh face of yours looking very different some day or other. Something tells
me that there's bad luck before you. But never mind, you'll never lose your
sister if the luck's ever so bad. Father sent word you and Jim were to meet him
at Broken Creek and bring your whips with you.'</p>
<p>'What in the world's that for?' I said, half speaking to myself. 'It looks
as if there was a big mob to drive, and where's he to get a big mob there in
that mountainous, beastly place, where the cattle all bolt like wallabies, and
where I never saw twenty head together?'</p>
<p>'He's got some reason for it,' said Aileen sorrowfully. 'If I were you I
wouldn't go. It's no good, and father's trying now to drag you and Jim into the
bad ways he's been following these years.'</p>
<p>'How do you know it's so bad?' said I. 'How can a girl like you know?'</p>
<p>'I know very well,' she said. 'Do you think I've lived here all these years
and don't know things? What makes him always come home after dark, and be that
nervous every time he sees a stranger coming up you'd think he was come out of
gaol? Why has he always got money, and why does mother look so miserable when
he's at home, and cheer up when he goes away?'</p>
<p>'He may get jobs of droving or something,' I said. 'You have no right to say
that he's robbing, or something of that sort, because he doesn't care about
tying himself to mother's apron-string.'</p>
<p>Aileen laughed, but it was more like crying.</p>
<p>'You told me just now,' she said&mdash;oh! so sorrowfully&mdash;'that you
and Jim were old enough to take a line of your own. Why don't you do it
now?'</p>
<p>'And tell father we'll have nothing more to do with him!'</p>
<p>'Why not?' she said, standing up straight before me, and facing me just as I
saw father face the big bullock-driver before he knocked him down. 'Why not?
You need never ask him for another meal; you can earn an easy living in
half-a-dozen ways, you and Jim. Why should you let him spoil your life and ruin
your soul for evermore?'</p>
<p>'The priest put that into your head,' I said sneeringly; 'Father
Doyle&mdash;of course he knows what they'll do with a fellow after he's
dead.'</p>
<p>'No!' she said, 'Father Doyle never said a word about you that wasn't good
and kind. He says mother's a good Catholic, and he takes an interest in you
boys and me because of her.'</p>
<p>'He can persuade you women to do anything,' I said, not that I had any
grudge against poor old Father Doyle, who used to come riding up the rough
mountain track on his white horse, and tiring his old bones, just 'to look
after his flock,' as he said&mdash;and nice lambs some of them were&mdash;but I
wanted to tease her and make her break off with this fancy of hers.</p>
<p>'He never does, and couldn't persuade me, except for my good,' said she,
getting more and more roused, and her black eyes glowed again, 'and I'll tell
you what I'll do to prove it. It's a sin, but if it is I'll stand by it, and
now I'll swear it (here she knelt down), as Almighty God shall help me at the
last day, if you and Jim will promise me to start straight off up the country
and take bush-work till shearing comes on, and never to have any truck with
cross chaps and their ways, I'll turn Protestant. I'll go to church with you,
and keep to it till I die.'</p>
<p>Wasn't she a trump? I've known women that would give up a lot for a man they
were sweet on, and wives that would follow their husbands about like spaniels,
and women that would lie and deceive and all but rob and murder for men they
were fond of, and sometimes do nearly as much to spite other women. But I don't
think I ever knew a woman that would give up her religion for any one before,
and it's not as if she wasn't staunch to her own faith. She was as regular in
her prayers and crossings and beads and all the rest of it as mother herself,
and if there ever was a good girl in the whole world she was one. She turned
faint as she said this, and I thought she was going to drop down. If anything
could have turned me then it would have been this. It was almost like giving
her life for ours, and I don't think she'd have valued hers two straws if she
could have saved us. There's a great deal said about different kinds of love in
this world, but I can't help thinking that the love between brothers and
sisters that have been brought up together and have had very few other people
to care about is a higher, better sort than any other in the world. There's
less selfishness about it&mdash;no thought but for the other's good. If that
can be made safe, death and pain and poverty and misery are all little things.
And wasn't I fond of Aileen, in spite of all my hardness and cross-grained
obstinacy?&mdash;so fond that I was just going to hug her to me and say, 'Take
it all your own way, Ailie dear,' when Jim came tearing out of the hut,
bareheaded, and stood listening to a far-off sound that caught all our ears at
once. We made out the source of it too well&mdash;far too well.</p>
<p>What was the noise at that hour of the night?</p>
<p>It was a hollow, faint, distant roaring that gradually kept getting louder.
It was the strange mournful bellowing that comes from a drove of cattle forced
along an unknown track. As we listened the sound came clearly on the night
wind, faint, yet still clearly coming nearer.</p>
<p>'Cattle being driven,' Jim cried out; 'and a big mob too. It's
father&mdash;for a note. Let's get our horses and meet him.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>'All right,' said I, 'he must have got there a day before his time. It is a
big mob and no mistake. I wonder where they're taking them to.' Aileen shrugged
her shoulders and walked in to mother with a look of misery and despair on her
face such as I never saw there before.</p>
<p>She knew it was no use talking to me now. The idea of going out to meet a
large lot of unknown cattle had strongly excited us, as would have been the
case with every bush-bred lad. All sorts of wonders passed through our minds as
we walked down the creek bank, with our bridles in our hands, towards where our
horses usually fed. One was easy to catch, the other with a little management
was secured. In ten minutes we were riding fast through the dark trees and
fallen timber towards the wild gullies and rock-strewed hills of Broken
Creek.</p>
<p>It was not more than an hour when we got up to the cattle. We could hear
them a good while before we saw them. 'My word,' said Jim, 'ain't they
restless. They can't have come far, or they wouldn't roar so. Where can the old
man have "touched" for them?'</p>
<p>'How should I know?' I said roughly. I had a kind of idea, but I thought he
would never be so rash.</p>
<p>When we got up I could see the cattle had been rounded up in a flat with
stony ridges all round. There must have been three or four hundred of them,
only a man and a boy riding round and wheeling them every now and then. Their
horses were pretty well knocked up. I knew father at once, and the old chestnut
mare he used to ride&mdash;an animal with legs like timbers and a mule rump;
but you couldn't tire her, and no beast that ever was calved could get away
from her. The boy was a half-caste that father had picked up somewhere; he was
as good as two men any day.</p>
<p>'So you've come at last,' growled father, 'and a good thing too. I didn't
expect to be here till to-morrow morning. The dog came home, I
suppose&mdash;that's what brought you here, wasn't it? I thought the infernal
cattle would beat Warrigal and me, and we'd have all our trouble for
nothing.'</p>
<p>'Whose cattle are they, and what are you going to do with them?'</p>
<p>'Never you mind; ask no questions, and you'll see all about it to-morrow.
I'll go and take a snooze now; I've had no sleep for three nights.'</p>
<p>With our fresh horses and riding round so we kept the cattle easily enough.
We did not tell Warrigal he might go to rest, not thinking a half-caste brat
like him wanted any. He didn't say anything, but went to sleep on his horse,
which walked in and out among the angry cattle as he sat on the saddle with his
head down on the horse's neck. They sniffed at him once or twice, some of the
old cows, but none of them horned him; and daylight came rather quicker than
one would think.</p>
<p>Then we saw whose cattle they were; they had all Hunter's and Falkland's
brands on, which showed that they belonged to Banda and Elingamah stations.</p>
<p>'By George!' says Jim, 'they're Mr. Hunter's cattle, and all these circle
dots belong to Banda. What a mob of calves! not one of them branded! What in
the world does father intend to do with them?'</p>
<p>Father was up, and came over where we stood with our horses in our hands
before we had time to say more. He wasn't one of those that slept after
daylight, whether he had work to do or not. He certainly <i>could</i> work;
daylight or dark, wet or dry, cold or hot, it was all one to father. It seems a
pity what he did was no use to him, as it turned out; for he was a man, was old
dad, every inch of him.</p>
<p>'Now, boys,' he said, quite brisk and almost good-natured for him, 'look
alive and we'll start the cattle; we've been long enough here; let 'em head up
that gully, and I'll show you something you've never seen before for as long as
you've known Broken Creek Ranges.'</p>
<p>'But where are you going to take 'em to?' I said. 'They're all Mr. Hunter's
and Mr. Falkland's; the brands are plain enough.'</p>
<p>'Are the calves branded, you blasted fool?' he said, while the black look
came over his face that had so often frightened me when I was a child. 'You do
what I tell you if you've any pluck and gumption about you; or else you and
your brother can ride over to Dargo Police Station and "give me away" if you
like; only don't come home again, I warn you, sons or no sons.'</p>
<p>If I had done what I had two minds to do&mdash;for I wasn't afraid of him
then, savage as he looked&mdash;told him to do his own duffing and ridden away
with Jim there and then&mdash;poor Jim, who sat on his horse staring at both of
us, and saying nothing&mdash;how much better it would have been for all of us,
the old man as well as ourselves; but it seemed as if it wasn't to be. Partly
from use, and partly from a love of danger and something new, which is at the
bottom of half the crime in the bush districts, I turned my horse's head after
the cattle, which were now beginning to straggle. Jim did the same on his side.
How easy is it for chaps to take the road to hell! for that was about the size
of it, and we were soon too busy to think about much else.</p>
<p>The track we were driving on led along a narrow rocky gully which looked as
if it had been split up or made out of a crack in the earth thousands of years
ago by an earthquake or something of that kind. The hills were that steep that
every now and then some of the young cattle that were not used to that sort of
country would come sliding down and bellow as if they thought they were going
to break their necks.</p>
<p>The water rushed down it like a torrent in wet winters, and formed a sort of
creek, and the bed of it made what track there was. There were overhanging
rocks and places that made you giddy to look at, and some of these must have
fallen down and blocked up the creek at one time or other. We had to scramble
round them the best way we could.</p>
<p>When we got nearly up to the head of the gully&mdash;and great work it was
to force the footsore cattle along, as we couldn't use our whips
overmuch&mdash;Jim called out&mdash;</p>
<p>'Why, here comes old Crib. Who'd have thought he'd have seen the track? Well
done, old man. Now we're right.'</p>
<p>Father never took any notice of the poor brute as he came limping along the
stones. Woman or child, horse or dog, it's the same old thing&mdash;the more
any creature loves a man in this world the worse they're treated. It looks like
it, at any rate. I saw how it was; father had given Crib a cruel beating the
night before, when he was put out for some trifling matter, and the dog had
left him and run home. But now he had thought better of it, and seen our tracks
and come to work and slave, with his bleeding feet&mdash;for they were cut all
to pieces&mdash;and got the whip across his back now and then for his pains.
It's a queer world!</p>
<p>When we got right to the top of this confounded gully, nearly dead-beat all
of us, and only for the dog heeling them up every now and then, and making his
teeth nearly meet in them, without a whimper, I believe the cattle would have
charged back and beat us. There was a sort of rough table-land&mdash;scrubby
and stony and thick it was, but still the grass wasn't bad in summer, when the
country below was all dried up. There were wild horses in troops there, and a
few wild cattle, so Jim and I knew the place well; but it was too far and too
much of a journey for our own horses to go often.</p>
<p>'Do you see that sugar-loaf hill with the bald top, across the range?' said
father, riding up just then, as we were taking it easy a little. 'Don't let the
cattle straggle, and make straight for that.'</p>
<p>'Why, it's miles away,' said Jim, looking rather dismal. 'We could never get
'em there.'</p>
<p>'We're not going there, stupid,' says father; 'that's only the line to keep.
I'll show you something about dinner-time that'll open your eyes a bit.'</p>
<p>Poor Jim brightened up at the mention of dinner-time, for, boylike, he was
getting very hungry, and as he wasn't done growing he had no end of an
appetite. I was hungry enough for the matter of that, but I wouldn't own to
it.</p>
<p>'Well, we shall come to somewhere, I suppose,' says Jim, when father was
gone. 'Blest if I didn't think he was going to keep us wandering in this
blessed Nulla Mountain all day. I wish I'd never seen the blessed cattle. I was
only waiting for you to hook it when we first seen the brands by daylight, and
I'd ha' been off like a brindle "Mickey" down a range.'</p>
<p>'Better for us if we had,' I said; 'but it's too late now. We must stick to
it, I suppose.'</p>
<p>We had kept the cattle going for three or four miles through the thickest of
the country, every now and then steering our course by the clear round top of
Sugarloaf, that could be seen for miles round, but never seemed to get any
nearer, when we came on a rough sort of log-fence, which ran the way we were
going.</p>
<p>'I didn't think there were any farms up here,' I said to Jim.</p>
<p>'It's a "break",' he said, almost in a whisper. 'There's a "duffing-yard"
somewhere handy; that's what's the matter.'</p>
<p>'Keep the cattle along it, anyway. We'll soon see what it leads to.'</p>
<p>The cattle ran along the fence, as if they expected to get to the end of
their troubles soon. The scrub was terribly thick in places, and every now and
then there was a break in the fence, when one of us had to go outside and hunt
them until we came to the next bit. At last we came to a little open kind of
flat, with the scrub that thick round it as you couldn't hardly ride through
it, and, just as Jim said, there was the yard.</p>
<p>It was a 'duffing-yard' sure enough. No one but people who had cattle to
hide and young stock they didn't want other people to see branded would have
made a place there.</p>
<p>Just on the south side of the yard, which was built of great heavy
stringy-bark trees cut down in the line of the fence, and made up with limbs
and logs, the range went up as steep as the side of a house. The cattle were
that tired and footsore&mdash;half their feet were bleeding, poor
devils&mdash;that they ran in through the sliprails and began to lay down.</p>
<p>'Light a fire, one of you boys,' says father, putting up the heavy sliprails
and fastening them. 'We must brand these calves before dark. One of you can go
to that gunyah, just under the range where that big white rock is, and you'll
find tea and sugar and something to eat.'</p>
<p>Jim rushed off at once, while I sulkily began to put some bark and twigs
together and build a fire.</p>
<p>'What's the use of all this cross work?' I said to father; 'we're bound to
be caught some day if we keep on at it. Then there'll be no one left to take
care of mother and Aileen.'</p>
<p>He looked rather struck at this, and then said quietly&mdash;</p>
<p>'You and your brother can go back now. Never say I kept you against your
will. You may as well lend a hand to brand these calves; then you may clear out
as soon as you like.'</p>
<p>Well, I didn't quite like leaving the old chap in the middle of the work
like that. I remember thinking, like many another young fool, I suppose, that I
could draw back in time, just after I'd tackled this job.</p>
<p>Draw back, indeed! When does a man ever get the chance of doing that, once
he's regularly gone in for any of the devil's work and wages? He takes care
there isn't much drawing back afterwards. So I said&mdash;</p>
<p>'We may as well give you a hand with this lot; but we'll go home then, and
drop all this duffing work. It don't pay. I'm old enough to know that, and
you'll find it out yet, I expect, father, yourself.'</p>
<p>'The fox lives long, and gives the hounds many a long chase before he's run
into,' he said, with a grim chuckle. 'I swore I'd be revenged on 'em all when
they locked me up and sent me out here for a paltry hare; broke my old mother's
heart, so it did. I've had a pound for every hair in her skin, and I shall go
on till I die. After all, if a man goes to work cautious and runs mute it's not
so easy to catch him in this country, at any rate.'</p>
<p>Jim at this came running out of the cave with a face of joy, a bag of
ship-biscuit, and a lot of other things.</p>
<p>'Here's tea and sugar,' he said; 'and there's biscuits and jam, and a big
lump of cheese. Get the fire right, Dick, while I get some water. We'll soon
have some tea, and these biscuits are jolly.'</p>
<p>The tea was made, and we all had a good meal. Father found a bottle of rum,
too; he took a good drink himself, and gave Jim and me a sip each. I felt less
inclined to quarrel with father after that. So we drafted all the calves into a
small pen-yard, and began to put our brand on them as quick as we could catch
'em.</p>
<p>A hundred and sixty of 'em altogether&mdash;all ages, from a month old to
nearly a year. Fine strong calves, and in rare condition, too. We could see
they were all belonging to Mr. Hunter and Mr. Falkland. How they came to leave
them all so long unbranded I can't say. Very careless they often are on these
large cattle-stations, so that sharp people like father and the Dalys, and a
lot more, get an easy chance at them.</p>
<p>Whatever father was going to do with them all when he had branded 'em, we
couldn't make out.</p>
<p>'There's no place to tail or wean 'em,' whispered Jim. 'We're not above
thirty miles from Banda in a straight line. These cows are dead sure to make
straight back the very minute they're let out, and very nice work it'll look
with all these calves with our brand on sucking these cows.'</p>
<p>Father happened to come round for a hot brand just as Jim finished.</p>
<p>'Never you mind about the weaning,' he snarled. 'I shan't ask you to tail
them either. It wouldn't be a nice job here, would it?' and father actually
laughed. It wasn't a very gay kind of a laugh, and he shut up his mouth with a
sort of snap again. Jim and I hadn't seen him laugh for I don't know how long,
and it almost frightened us.</p>
<p>As Jim said, it wouldn't do to let the cattle out again. If calves are
weaned, and have only one brand on, it is very hard for any man to swear that
they are not the property of the man to whom that brand belongs. He may believe
them to be his, but may never have seen them in his life; and if he has seen
them on a camp or on the run, it's very hard to swear to any one particular red
or spotted calf as you would to a horse.</p>
<p>The great dart is to keep the young stock away from their mothers until they
forget one another, and then most of the danger is past. But if calves with one
man's brand on are seen sucking another man's cows, it is pretty plain that the
brand on the calves has been put on without the consent of the owner of the
cows&mdash;which is cattle-stealing; a felony, according to the Act 7 and 8
George IV, No. 29, punishable with three years' imprisonment, with hard labour
on the roads of the colony or other place, as the Judge may direct.</p>
<p>There's a lot of law! How did I learn it? I had plenty of time in Berrima
Gaol&mdash;worse luck&mdash;my first stretch. But it was after I'd done the
foolishness, and not before.</p>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>'Now then, you boys!' says father, coming up all of a sudden like, and
bringing out his words as if it was old times with us, when we didn't know
whether he'd hit first and talk afterwards, or the other way on, 'get out the
lot we've just branded, and drive 'em straight for that peak, where the water
shines dripping over the stones, right again the sun, and look slippy; we're
burning daylight, and these cows are making row enough, blast 'em! to be heard
all the way to Banda. I'll go on and steady the lead; you keep 'em close up to
me.'</p>
<p>Father mounted the old mare. The dog stopped behind; he knew he'd have to
mind the tail&mdash;that is the hindmost cattle&mdash;and stop 'em from
breaking or running clear away from the others. We threw down the rails. Away
the cattle rushed out, all in a long string. You'd 'a thought no mortal men
could 'a kept 'em in that blind hole of a place. But father headed 'em, and
turned 'em towards the peak. The dog worried those that wanted to stay by the
yard or turn another way. We dropped our whip on 'em, and kept 'em going. In
five minutes they were all a-moving along in one mob at a pretty sharpish trot
like a lot of store cattle. Father knew his way about, whether the country was
thick or open. It was all as one to him. What a slashing stockman he would have
made in new country, if he only could have kept straight.</p>
<p>It took us an hour's hard dinkum to get near the peak. Sometimes it was
awful rocky, as well as scrubby, and the poor devils of cattle got as
sore-footed as babies&mdash;blood up to the knee, some of 'em; but we crowded
'em on; there was no help for it.</p>
<p>At last we rounded up on a flat, rocky, open kind of a place; and here
father held up his hand.</p>
<p>'Let 'em ring a bit; some of their tongues are out. These young things is
generally soft. Come here, Dick.' I rode up, and he told me to follow him.</p>
<p>We walked our horses up to the edge of the mountain and looked over. It was
like the end of the world. Far down there was a dark, dreadful drop into a sort
of deep valley below. You couldn't see the bottom of it. The trees on the
mountain side looked like bushes, and they were big ironbarks and messmates
too. On three sides of us was this awful, desolate-looking precipice&mdash;a
dreary, gloomy, God-forsaken kind of spot. The sky got cloudy, and the breeze
turned cold and began to murmur and whistle in an odd, unnatural kind of way,
while father, seeing how scared and puzzled I was, began to laugh. I shuddered.
A thought crossed my mind that it might be the Enemy of Souls, in his shape,
going to carry us off for doing such a piece of wickedness.</p>
<p>'Looks queer, doesn't it?' says father, going to the brink and kicking down
a boulder, that rolled and crashed down the steep mountain side, tearing its
way through scrub and heath till it settled down in the glen below. 'It won't
do for a man's horse to slip, will it, boy? And yet there's a track here into a
fine large paddock, open and clear, too, where I'm going to put these cattle
into.'</p>
<p>I stared at him, without speaking, thinking was he mad.</p>
<p>'No! the old man isn't mad, youngster,' he said; 'not yet, at least. I'm
going to show you a trick that none of you native boys are up to, smart as you
think yourselves.' Here he got off the old mare, and began to lead her to the
edge of the mountain.</p>
<p>'Now, you rally the cattle well after me,' he said; 'they'll follow the old
mare after a bit. I left a few cows among 'em on purpose, and when they "draw"
keep 'em going well up, but not too fast.'</p>
<p>He had lengthened the bridle of the mare, and tied the end of a light tether
rope that he had round her neck to it. I saw her follow him slowly, and turn
down a rocky track that seemed to lead straight over a bluff of the
precipice.</p>
<p>However, I gave the word to 'head on'. The dog had started rounding 'em up
as soon as he saw the old mare walk towards the mountain side, and the cattle
were soon crushed up pretty close to the mare's heels.</p>
<p>Mind this, that they were so footsore and tender about the hoofs that they
could not have run away from us on foot if they had tried.</p>
<p>After 'ringing' a bit, one of the quiet cows followed up the old mare that
was walking step by step forward, and all the rest followed her like sheep.
Cattle will do that. I've seen a stockrider, when all the horses were dead
beat, trying to get fat cattle to take a river in flood, jump off and turn his
horse loose into the stream. If he went straight, and swam across, all the
cattle would follow him like sheep.</p>
<p>Well, when the old mare got to the bluff she turned short round to the
right, and then I saw that she had struck a narrow path down a gully that got
deeper and deeper every yard we went. There was just room for a couple or three
calves to go abreast, and by and by all of 'em was walking down it like as if
they was the beasts agoing into Noah's Ark. It wound and wound and got deeper
and deeper till the walls of rock were ever so far above our heads. Our work
was done then; the cattle had to walk on like sheep in a race. We led our
horses behind them, and the dog walked along, saving his sore feet as well as
he could, and never tried to bite a beast once he got within the walls. He
looked quite satisfied, and kept chuckling almost to himself. I really believe
I've seen dogs laugh. Once upon a time I've read of they'd have taken poor Crib
for a familiar spirit, and hanged or burnt him. Well, he knew a lot, and no
mistake. I've seen plenty of Christians as he could buy and sell, and no
trouble to him. I'm dashed if the old mare, too, didn't take a pleasure in
working cattle on the cross. She was the laziest old wretch bringing up the
cows at home, or running in the horses. Many a time Jim and I took a turn out
of her when father didn't know. But put her after a big mob of cattle&mdash;she
must have known they couldn't be ours&mdash;and she'd clatter down a range like
the wall of a house, and bite and kick the tail cattle if they didn't get out
of her way. They say dogs and horses are all honest, and it's only us as
teaches 'em to do wrong. My notion's they're a deal like ourselves, and some of
'em fancies the square racket dull and safe, while some takes a deal kindlier
to the other. Anyhow, no cattle-duffer in the colonies could have had a better
pair of mates than old Sally and Crib, if the devil himself had broken 'em in
special for the trade.</p>
<p>It was child's play now, as far as the driving went. Jim and I walked along,
leading our horses and yarning away as we used to do when we were little chaps
bringing in the milkers.</p>
<p>'My word, Dick, dad's dropped into a fine road through this thundering
mountain, hasn't he? I wonder where it leads to? How high the rock-walls are
getting above us!' he says. 'I know now. I think I heard long ago from one of
the Crosbies of a place in the ranges down towards behind the Nulla Mountain,
"Terrible Hollow". He didn't know about it himself, but said an old stockman
told him about it when he was drunk. He said the Government men used to hide
the cattle and horses there in old times, and that it was never found out.'</p>
<p>'Why wasn't it found out, Jim? If the old fellow "split" about it some one
else would get to know.'</p>
<p>'Well, old Dan said that they killed one man that talked of telling; the
rest were too frightened after that, and they all swore a big oath never to
tell any one except he was on the cross.'</p>
<p>'That's how dad come to know, I suppose,' said Jim. 'I wish he never had. I
don't care about those cross doings. I never did. I never seen any good come
out of them yet.'</p>
<p>'Well, we must go through with it now, I suppose. It won't do to leave old
dad in the lurch. You won't, will you, Jim?'</p>
<p>'You know very well I won't,' says Jim, very soberlike. 'I don't like it any
the more for that. But I wish father had broke his leg, and was lying up at
home, with mother nursing him, before he found out this hell-hole of a
place.'</p>
<p>'Well, we're going to get out of it, and soon too. The gully seems getting
wider, and I can see a bit of open country through the trees.'</p>
<p>'Thank God for that!' says Jim. 'My boots'll part company soon, and the poor
devils of calves won't have any hoofs either, if there's much more of
this.'</p>
<p>'They're drawing faster now. The leading cattle are beginning to run. We're
at the end of the drive.'</p>
<p>So it was. The deep, rocky gully gradually widened into an open and pretty
smooth flat; this, again, into a splendid little plain, up to the knees in
grass; a big natural park, closed round on every side with sandstone rockwalls,
as upright as if they were built, and a couple of thousand feet above the place
where we stood.</p>
<p>This scrub country was crossed by two good creeks; it was several miles
across, and a trifle more in length. Our hungry weaners spread out and began to
feed, without a notion of their mothers they'd left behind; but they were not
the only ones there. We could see other mobs of cattle, some near, some farther
off; horses, too; and the well-worn track in several ways showed that this was
no new grazing ground.</p>
<p>Father came riding back quite comfortable and hearty-like for him.</p>
<p>'Welcome to Terrible Hollow, lads,' says he. 'You're the youngest chaps it
has ever been shown to, and if I didn't know you were the right stuff, you'd
never have seen it, though you're my own flesh and blood. Jump off, and let
your horses go. They can't get away, even if they tried; they don't look much
like that.'</p>
<p>Our poor nags were something like the cattle, pretty hungry and stiff. They
put their heads down to the thick green grass, and went in at it with a
will.</p>
<p>'Bring your saddles along with you,' father said, 'and come after me. I'll
show you a good camping place. You deserve a treat after last night's
work.'</p>
<p>We turned back towards the rocky wall, near to where we had come in, and
there, behind a bush and a big piece of sandstone that had fallen down, was the
entrance to a cave. The walls of it were quite clean and white-looking, the
floor was smooth, and the roof was pretty high, well blackened with smoke, too,
from the fires which had been lighted in it for many a year gone by.</p>
<p>A kind of natural cellar had been made by scooping out the soft sandstone
behind a ledge. From this father took a bag of flour and corn-meal. We very
soon made some cakes in the pan, that tasted well, I can tell you. Tea and
sugar too, and quart pots, some bacon in a flour-bag; and that rasher fried in
the pan was the sweetest meat I ever ate in all my born days.</p>
<p>Then father brought out a keg and poured some rum into a pint pot. He took a
pretty stiff pull, and then handed it to us. 'A little of it won't hurt you,
boys,' he said, 'after a night's work.'</p>
<p>I took some&mdash;not much; we hadn't learned to drink then&mdash;to keep
down the fear of something hanging over us. A dreadful fear it is. It makes a
coward of every man who doesn't lead a square life, let him be as game as he
may.</p>
<p>Jim wouldn't touch it. 'No,' he said, when I laughed at him, 'I promised
mother last time I had more than was good for me at Dargo Races that I wouldn't
touch it again for two years; and I won't either. I can stand what any other
man can, and without the hard stuff, either.'</p>
<p>'Please yourself,' said father. 'When you're ready we'll have a ride through
the stock.'</p>
<p>We finished our meal, and a first-rate one it was. A man never has the same
appetite for his meals anywhere else that he has in the bush, specially if he
has been up half the night. It's so fresh, and the air makes him feel as if
he'd ate nothing for a week. Sitting on a log, or in the cave, as we were, I've
had the best meal I've ever tasted since I was born. Not like the
close-feeling, close-smelling, dirty-clean graveyard they call a gaol. But it's
no use beginning on that. We were young men, and free, too. Free! By all the
devils in hell, if there are devils&mdash;and there must be to tempt a man, or
how could he be so great a fool, so blind a born idiot, as to do anything in
this world that would put his freedom in jeopardy? And what for? For folly and
nonsense. For a few pounds he could earn with a month's honest work and be all
the better man for it. For a false woman's smile that he could buy, and ten
like her, if he only kept straight and saving. For a bit of sudden pride or
vanity or passion. A short bit of what looks like pleasure, against months and
years of weariness, and cold and heat, and dull half-death, with maybe a dog's
death at the end!</p>
<p>I could cry like a child when I think of it now. I have cried many's the
time and often since I have been shut up here, and dashed my head against the
stones till I pretty nigh knocked all sense and feeling out of it, not so much
in repentance, though I don't say I feel sorry, but to think what a fool, fool,
fool I'd been. Yes, fool, three times over&mdash;a hundred times&mdash;to put
my liberty and life against such a miserable stake&mdash;a stake the devil that
deals the pack is so safe to win at the end.</p>
<p>I may as well go on. But I can't help breaking out sometimes when I hear the
birds calling to one another as they fly over the yard, and know it's fresh air
and sun and green grass outside that I never shall see again. Never see the
river rippling under the big drooping trees, or the cattle coming down in the
twilight to drink after the long hot day. Never, never more! And whose fault is
it? Who have I to blame? Perhaps father helped a bit; but I knew better, and no
one is half as much to blame as myself.</p>
<p>Where were we? Oh, at the cave-mouth, coming out with our bridles in our
hands to catch our horses. We soon did that, and then we rode away to the other
cattle. They were a queer lot, in fine condition, but all sorts of ages and
breeds, with every kind of brand and ear-mark.</p>
<p>Lots of the brands we didn't know, and had never heard of. Some had no
brands at all&mdash;full-grown beasts, too; that was a thing we had very seldom
seen. Some of the best cattle and some of the finest horses&mdash;and there
were some real plums among the horses&mdash;had a strange brand, JJ.</p>
<p>'Who does the JJ brand belong to?' I said to father. 'They're the pick of
the lot, whose ever they are.'</p>
<p>Father looked black for a bit, and then he growled out, 'Don't you ask too
many questions, lad. There's only four living men besides yourselves knows
about this place; so take care and don't act foolishly, or you'll lose a plant
that may save your life, as well as keep you in cash for many a year to come.
That brand belongs to Starlight, and he was the only man left alive of the men
that first found it and used it to put away stock in. He wanted help, and told
me five years ago. He took in a half-caste chap, too, against my will. He
helped him with that last lot of cattle that you noticed.'</p>
<p>'But where did those horses come from?' Jim said. 'I never hardly saw such a
lot before. All got the JJ brand on, too, and nothing else; all about three
year old.'</p>
<p>'They were brought here as foals,' says father, 'following their mothers.
Some of them was foaled here; and, of course, as they've only the one brand on
they never can be claimed or sworn to. They're from some of Mr. Maxwell's best
thoroughbred mares, and their sire was Earl of Atheling, imported. He was here
for a year.'</p>
<p>'Well, they might look the real thing,' said Jim, his eyes brightening as he
gazed at them. 'I'd like to have that dark bay colt with the star. My word,
what a forehand he's got; and what quarters, too. If he can't gallop I'll never
say I know a horse from a poley cow.'</p>
<p>'You shall have him, or as good, never fear, if you stick to your work,'
says father. 'You mustn't cross Starlight, for he's a born devil when he's
taken the wrong way, though he talks so soft. The half-caste is an out-and-out
chap with cattle, and the horse doesn't stand on four legs that he can't
ride&mdash;and make follow him, for the matter of that. But he's worth
watching. I don't believe in him myself. And now ye have the lot.'</p>
<p>'And a d&mdash;&mdash;d fine lot they are,' I said, for I was vexed with Jim
for taking so easy to the bait father held out to him about the horse. 'A very
smart crowd to be on the roads inside of five years, and drag us in with
'em.'</p>
<p>'How do you make that out?' says father. 'Are you going to turn dog, now you
know the way in? Isn't it as easy to carry on for a few years more as it was
twenty years ago?'</p>
<p>'Not by a long chalk,' I said, for my blood was up, and I felt as if I could
talk back to father and give him as good as he sent, and all for Jim's sake.
Poor Jim! He'd always go to the mischief for the sake of a good horse, and many
another 'Currency' chap has gone the same way. It's a pity for some of 'em that
a blood horse was ever foaled.</p>
<p>'You think you can't be tracked,' says I, 'but you must bear in mind you
haven't got to do with the old-fashioned mounted police as was potterin' about
when this "bot" was first hit on. There's chaps in the police getting now,
natives or all the same, as can ride and track every bit as well as the
half-caste you're talking about. Some day they'll drop on the track of a mob
coming in or getting out, and then the game will be all up.'</p>
<p>'You can cut it if you like now,' said father, looking at me curious like.
'Don't say I dragged you in. You and your brother can go home, and no one will
ever know where you were; no more than if you'd gone to the moon.'</p>
<p>Jim looked at the brown colt that just came trotting up as dad finished
speaking&mdash;trotting up with his head high and his tail stuck out like a
circus horse. If he'd been the devil in a horsehide he couldn't have chosen a
better moment. Then his eyes began to glitter.</p>
<p>We all three looked at each other. No one spoke. The colt stopped, turned,
and galloped back to his mates like a red flyer with the dogs close behind
him.</p>
<p>It was not long. We all began to speak at once. But in that time the die was
cast, the stakes were down, and in the pool were three men's lives.</p>
<p>'I don't care whether we go back or not,' says Jim; 'I'll do either way that
Dick likes. But that colt I must have.'</p>
<p>'I never intended to go back,' I said. 'But we're three d&mdash;&mdash;d
fools all the same&mdash;father and sons. It'll be the dearest horse you ever
bought, Jim, old man, and so I tell you.'</p>
<p>'Well, I suppose it's settled now,' says father; 'so let's have no more
chat. We're like a pack of old women, blessed if we ain't.'</p>
<p>After that we got on more sociably. Father took us all over the place, and a
splendid paddock it was&mdash;walled all round but where we had come in, and a
narrow gash in the far side that not one man in a thousand could ever hit on,
except he was put up to it; a wild country for miles when you did get
out&mdash;all scrub and rock, that few people ever had call to ride over. There
was splendid grass everywhere, water, and shelter. It was warmer, too, than the
country above, as you could see by the coats of the cattle and horses.</p>
<p>'If it had only been honestly come by,' Jim said, 'what a jolly place it
would have been!'</p>
<p>Towards the north end of the paddock was a narrow gully with great sandstone
walls all round, and where it narrowed the first discoverers had built a
stockyard, partly with dry stone walls and partly with logs and rails.</p>
<p>There was no trouble in getting the cattle or horses into this, and there
were all kinds of narrow yards and pens for branding the stock if they were
clearskins, and altering or 'faking' the brands if they were plain. This led
into another yard, which opened into the narrowest part of the gully. Once in
this, like the one they came down, and the cattle or horses had no chance but
to walk slowly up, one behind the other, till they got on the tableland above.
Here, of course, every kind of work that can be done to help disguise cattle
was done. Ear-marks were cut out and altered in shape, or else the whole ear
was cropped off; every letter in the alphabet was altered by means of straight
bars or half-circles, figures, crosses, everything you could think of.</p>
<p>'Mr. Starlight is an edicated man,' said father. 'This is all his notion;
and many a man has looked at his own beast, with the ears altered and the brand
faked, and never dreamed he ever owned it. He's a great card is Starlight. It's
a pity he ever took to this kind of life.'</p>
<p>Father said this with a kind of real sorrow that made me look at him to see
if the grog had got into his head; just as if his life, mine, and Jim's didn't
matter a straw compared to this man's, whoever he was, that had had so many
better chances than we had and had chucked 'em all away.</p>
<p>But it's a strange thing that I don't think there's any place in the world
where men feel a more real out-and-out respect for a gentleman than in
Australia. Everybody's supposed to be free and equal now; of course, they
couldn't be in the convict days. But somehow a man that's born and bred a
gentleman will always be different from other men to the end of the world.
What's the most surprising part of it is that men like father, who have hated
the breed and suffered by them, too, can't help having a curious liking and
admiration for them. They'll follow them like dogs, fight for them, shed their
blood, and die for them; must be some sort of a natural feeling. Whatever it
is, it's there safe enough, and nothing can knock it out of nine-tenths of all
the men and women you meet. I began to be uneasy to see this wonderful mate of
father's, who was so many things at once&mdash;a cattle-stealer, a bush-ranger,
and a gentleman.</p>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p>After we'd fairly settled to stay, father began to be more pleasant than
he'd ever been before. We were pretty likely, he said, to have a visit from
Starlight and the half-caste in a day or two, if we'd like to wait. He was to
meet him at the Hollow on purpose to help him out with the mob of fat bullocks
we had looked at. Father, it appears, was coming here by himself when he met
this outlying lot of Mr. Hunter's cattle, and thought he and old Crib could
bring them in by themselves. And a mighty good haul it was. Father said we
should share the weaners between the three of us; that meant &pound;50 a piece
at least. The devil always helps beginners.</p>
<p>We put through a couple of days pleasantly enough, after our hardish bit of
work. Jim found some fish-hooks and a line, and we caught plenty of mullet and
eels in the deep, clear waterholes. We found a couple of double-barrelled guns,
and shot ducks enough to last us a week. No wonder the old frequenters of the
Hollow used to live here for a month at a time, having great times of it as
long as their grog lasted; and sometimes having the tribe of blacks that
inhabited the district to make merry and carouse with them, like the buccaneers
of the Spanish Main that I've read about, till the plunder was all gone. There
were scrawls on the wall of the first cave we had been in that showed all the
visitors had not been rude, untaught people; and Jim picked up part of a
woman's dress splashed with blood, and in one place, among some smouldering
packages and boxes, a long lock of woman's hair, fair, bright-brown, that
looked as if the name of Terrible Hollow might not have been given to this
lonely, wonderful glen for nothing.</p>
<p>We spent nearly a week in this way, and were beginning to get rather sick of
the life, when father, who used always to be looking at a bare patch in the
scrub above us, said&mdash;</p>
<p>'They're coming at last.'</p>
<p>'Who are coming&mdash;friends?'</p>
<p>'Why, friends, of course. That's Starlight's signal. See that smoke? The
half-caste always sends that up&mdash;like the blacks in his mother's tribe, I
suppose.'</p>
<p>'Any cattle or horses with them?' said Jim.</p>
<p>'No, or they'd send up two smokes. They'll be here about dinner-time, so we
must get ready for them.'</p>
<p>We had plenty of time to get ourselves or anything else ready. In about four
hours we began to look at them through a strong spyglass which father brought
out. By and by we got sight of two men coming along on horseback on the top of
the range the other side of the far wall. They wasn't particularly easy to see,
and every now and then we'd lose sight of 'em as they got into thick timber or
behind rocks.</p>
<p>Father got the spyglass on to 'em at last, pretty clear, and nearly threw it
down with an oath.</p>
<p>'By &mdash;&mdash;!' he says, 'I believe Starlight's hurt somehow. He's so
infernal rash. I can see the half-caste holding him on. If the police are on
his tracks they'll spring the plant here, and the whole thing'll be blown.'</p>
<p>We saw them come to the top of the wall, as it were, then they stopped for a
long while, then all of a sudden they seemed to disappear.</p>
<p>'Let's go over to the other side,' says father; 'they're coming down the
gully now. It's a terrible steep, rough track, worse than the other. If
Starlight's hurt bad he'll never ride down. But he has the pluck of the devil,
sure enough.'</p>
<p>We rode over to the other side, where there was a kind of gully that came
in, something like the one we came in by, but rougher, and full of gibbers
(boulders). There was a path, but it looked as if cattle could never be driven
or forced up it. We found afterwards that they had an old pack bullock that
they'd trained to walk up this, and down, too, when they wanted him, and the
other cattle followed in his track, as cattle will.</p>
<p>Father showed us a sort of cave by the side of the track, where one man,
with a couple of guns and a pistol or two, could have shot down a small
regiment as they came down one at a time.</p>
<p>We stayed in there by the track, and after about half-an-hour we heard the
two horses coming down slowly, step by step, kicking the stones down before
them. Then we could hear a man groaning, as if he couldn't bear the pain, and
partly as if he was trying to smother it. Then another man's voice, very soft
and soothing like, trying to comfort another.</p>
<p>'My head's a-fire, and these cursed ribs are grinding against one another
every step of this infernal ladder. Is it far now?' How he groaned then!</p>
<p>'Just got the bottom; hold on a bit longer and you'll be all right.'</p>
<p>Just then the leading horse came out into the open before the cave. We had a
good look at him and his rider. I never forgot them. It was a bad day I ever
saw either, and many a man had cause to say the same.</p>
<p>The horse held up his head and snorted as he came abreast of us, and we
showed out. He was one of the grandest animals I'd ever seen, and I afterwards
found he was better than he looked. He came stepping down that beastly rocky
goat-track, he, a clean thoroughbred that ought never to have trod upon
anything rougher than a rolled training track, or the sound bush turf. And here
he was with a heavy weight on his back&mdash;a half-dead, fainting man, that
couldn't hold the reins&mdash;and him walking down as steady as an old mountain
bull or a wallaroo on the side of a creek bank.</p>
<p>I hadn't much time to look him over. I was too much taken up with the rider,
who was lying forward on his chest across a coat rolled round and strapped in
front of the saddle, and his arms round the horse's neck. He was as pale as a
ghost. His eyes&mdash;great dark ones they were, too&mdash;were staring out of
his head. I thought he was dead, and called out to father and Jim that he
was.</p>
<p>They ran up, and we lifted him off after undoing some straps and a rope. He
was tied on (that was what the half-caste was waiting for at the top of the
gully). When we laid him down his head fell back, and he looked as much like a
corpse as if he had been dead a day.</p>
<p>Then we saw he had been wounded. There was blood on his shirt, and the upper
part of his arm was bandaged.</p>
<p>'It's too late, father,' said I; 'he's a dead man. What pluck he must have
had to ride down there!'</p>
<p>'He's worth two dead 'uns yet,' said father, who had his hand on his pulse.
'Hold his head up one of you while I go for the brandy. How did he get hit,
Warrigal?'</p>
<p>'That &mdash;&mdash; Sergeant Goring,' said the boy, a slight,
active-looking chap, about sixteen, that looked as if he could jump into a gum
tree and back again, and I believe he could. 'Sergeant Goring, he very near
grab us at Dilligah. We got a lot of old Jobson's cattle when he came on us. He
jump off his horse when he see he couldn't catch us, and very near drop
Starlight. My word, he very nearly fall off&mdash;just like that' (here he
imitated a man reeling in his saddle); 'but the old horse stop steady with him,
my word, till he come to. Then the sergeant fire at him again; hit him in the
shoulder with his pistol. Then Starlight come to his senses, and we clear. My
word, he couldn't see the way the old horse went. Ha, ha!'&mdash;here the young
devil laughed till the trees and rocks rang again. 'Gallop different ways, too,
and met at the old needle-rock. But they was miles away then.'</p>
<p>Before the wild boy had come to the end of his story the wounded man had
proved that it was only a dead faint, as the women call it, not the real thing.
And after he had tasted a pannikin full of brandy and water, which father
brought him, he sat up and looked like a living man once more.</p>
<p>'Better have a look at my shoulder,' he said. 'That &mdash;&mdash; fellow
shot like a prize-winner at Wimbledon. I've had a squeak for it.'</p>
<p>'Puts me in mind of our old poaching rows,' said father, while he carefully
cut the shirt off, that was stiffened with blood and showed where the bullet
had passed through the muscle, narrowly missing the bone of the joint. We
washed it, and relieved the wounded man by discovering that the other bullet
had only been spent, after striking a tree most like, when it had knocked the
wind out of him and nearly unhorsed him, as Warrigal said.</p>
<p>'Fill my pipe, one of you. Who the devil are these lads? Yours, I suppose,
Marston, or you wouldn't be fool enough to bring them here. Why didn't you
leave them at home with their mother? Don't you think you and I and this
devil's limb enough for this precious trade of ours?'</p>
<p>'They'll take their luck as it comes, like others,' growled father; 'what's
good enough for me isn't too bad for them. We want another hand or two to work
things right.'</p>
<p>'Oh! we do, do we?' said the stranger, fixing his eyes on father as if he
was going to burn a hole in him with a burning-glass; 'but if I'd a brace of
fine boys like those of my own I'd hang myself before I'd drag them into the
pit after myself.'</p>
<p>'That's all very fine,' said father, looking very dark and dangerous. 'Is
Mr. Starlight going to turn parson? You'll be just in time, for we'll all be
shopped if you run against the police like this, and next thing to lay them on
to the Hollow by making for it when you're too weak to ride.'</p>
<p>'What would you have me do? Pull up and hold up my hands? There was nowhere
else to go; and that new sergeant rode devilish well, I can tell you, with a
big chestnut well-bred horse, that gave old Rainbow here all he knew to lose
him. Now, once for all, no more of that, Marston, and mind your own business.
I'm the superior officer in this ship's company&mdash;you know that very
well&mdash;your business is to obey me, and take second place.'</p>
<p>Father growled out something, but did not offer to deny it. We could see
plainly that the stranger was or had been far above our rank, whatever were the
reasons which had led to his present kind of life.</p>
<p>We stayed for about ten days, while the stranger's arm got well. With care
and rest, it soon healed. He was pleasant enough, too, when the pain went away.
He had been in other countries, and told us all kinds of stories about
them.</p>
<p>He said nothing, though, about his own former ways, and we often wondered
whatever could have made him take to such a life. Unknown to father, too, he
gave us good advice, warned us that what we were in was the road to
imprisonment or death in due course, and not to flatter ourselves that any
other ending was possible.</p>
<p>'I have my own reasons for leading the life I do,' he said, 'and must run my
own course, of which I foresee the end as plainly as if it was written in a
book before me. Your father had a long account to square with society, and he
has a right to settle it his own way. That yellow whelp was never intended for
anything better. But for you lads'&mdash;and here he looked kindly in poor old
Jim's honest face (and an honest face and heart Jim's was, and that I'll live
and die on)&mdash;'my advice to you is, to clear off home, when we go, and
never come back here again. Tell your father you won't come; cut loose from
him, once and for all. You'd better drown yourselves comfortably at once than
take to this cursed trade. Now, mind what I tell you, and keep your own
counsel.'</p>
<p>By and by, the day came when the horses were run in for father and Mr.
Starlight and Warrigal, who packed up to be off for some other part.</p>
<p>When they were in the yard we had a good look at his own horse&mdash;a good
look&mdash;and if I'd been a fellow that painted pictures, and that kind of
thing, I could draw a middlin' good likeness of him now.</p>
<p>By George! how fond I am of a good horse&mdash;a real well-bred clinker. I'd
never have been here if it hadn't been for that, I do believe; and many another
Currency chap can say the same&mdash;a horse or a woman&mdash;that's about the
size of it, one or t'other generally fetches us. I shall never put foot in
stirrup again, but I'll try and scratch out a sort of likeness of Rainbow.</p>
<p>He was a dark bay horse, nearly brown, without a white hair on him. He
wasn't above 15 hands and an inch high, but looked a deal bigger than he was,
for the way he held his head up and carried himself. He was deep and thick
through behind the shoulders, and girthed ever so much more than you'd think.
He had a short back, and his ribs went out like a cask, long quarter, great
thighs and hocks, wonderful legs, and feet of course to do the work he did. His
head was plainish, but clean and bony, and his eye was big and well opened,
with no white showing. His shoulder was sloped back that much that he couldn't
fall, no matter what happened his fore legs. All his paces were good too. I
believe he could jump&mdash;jump anything he was ridden at, and very few horses
could get the better of him for one mile or three.</p>
<p>Where he'd come from, of course, we were not to know then. He had a small
private sort of brand that didn't belong to any of the big studs; but he was
never bred by a poor man. I afterwards found out that he was stolen before he
was foaled, like many another plum, and his dam killed as soon as she had
weaned him. So, of course, no one could swear to him, and Starlight could have
ridden past the Supreme Court, at the assizes, and never been stopped, as far
as this horse was concerned.</p>
<p>Before we went away father and Starlight had some terrible long talks, and
one evening Jim came to me, and says he&mdash;</p>
<p>'What do you think they're up to now?'</p>
<p>'How should I know? Sticking up a bank, or boning a flock of maiden ewes to
take up a run with? They seem to be game for anything. There'll be a hanging
match in the family if us boys don't look out.'</p>
<p>'There's no knowing,' says Jim, with a roguish look in his eye (I didn't
think then how near the truth I was), 'but it's about a horse this time.'</p>
<p>'Oh! a horse; that alters the matter. But what's one horse to make such a
shine about?'</p>
<p>'Ah, that's the point,' says poor old Jim, 'it's a horse worth talking
about. Don't you remember the imported entire that they had his picture in the
papers&mdash;him that Mr. Windhall gave &pound;2000 for?'</p>
<p>'What! the Marquis of Lorne? Why, you don't mean to say they're going for
him?'</p>
<p>'By George, I do!' says Jim; 'and they'll have him here, and twenty blood
mares to put to him, before September.'</p>
<p>'They're all gone mad&mdash;they'll raise the country on us. Every police
trooper in the colony'll be after us like a pack of dingoes after an old man
kangaroo when the ground's boggy, and they'll run us down, too; they can't be
off it. Whatever made 'em think of such a big touch as that?'</p>
<p>'That Starlight's the devil, I think,' said Jim slowly. 'Father didn't seem
to like it at first, but he brought him round bit by bit&mdash;said he knew a
squatter in Queensland he could pass him on to; that they'd keep him there for
a year and get a crop of foals by him, and when the "derry" was off he'd take
him over himself.'</p>
<p>'But how's he going to nail him? People say Windhall keeps him locked up at
night, and his box is close to his house.'</p>
<p>'Starlight says he has a friend handy; he seems to have one or two
everywhere. It's wonderful, as father told him, where he gets information.'</p>
<p>'By George! it would be a touch, and no mistake. And if we could get a few
colts by him out of thoroughbred mares we might win half the races every year
on our side and no one a bit the wiser.'</p>
<p>It did seem a grand sort of thing&mdash;young fools that we were&mdash;to
get hold of this wonderful stallion that we'd heard so much of, as thoroughbred
as Eclipse; good as anything England could turn out. I say again, if it weren't
for the horse-flesh part of it, the fun and hard-riding and tracking, and all
the rest of it, there wouldn't be anything like the cross-work that there is in
Australia. It lies partly between that and the dry weather. There's the long
spells of drought when nothing can be done by young or old. Sometimes for
months you can't work in the garden, nor plough, nor sow, nor do anything
useful to keep the devil out of your heart. Only sit at home and do nothing, or
else go out and watch the grass witherin' and the water dryin' up, and the
stock dyin' by inches before your eyes. And no change, maybe, for months. The
ground like iron and the sky like brass, as the parson said, and very true,
too, last Sunday.</p>
<p>Then the youngsters, havin' so much idle time on their hands, take to
gaffin' and flash talk; and money must be got to sport and pay up if they lose;
and the stock all ramblin' about and mixed up, and there's a temptation to
collar somebody's calves or foals, like we did that first red heifer. I shall
remember her to my dying day. It seems as if I had put that brand on my own
heart when I jammed it down on her soft skin. Anyhow, I never forgot it, and
there's many another like me, I'll be bound.</p>
<p>The next morning Jim and I started off home. Father said he should stay in
the Hollow till Starlight got round a bit. He told us not to tell mother or
Ailie a word about where we'd been. Of course they couldn't be off knowin' that
we'd been with him; but we were to stall them off by saying we'd been helping
him with a bit of bush-work or anything we could think off. 'It'll do no good,
and your mother's quite miserable enough as it is, boys,' he said. 'She'll know
time enough, and maybe break her heart over it, too. Poor Norah!'</p>
<p>Dashed if I ever heard father say a soft thing before. I couldn't 'a
believed it. I always thought he was ironbark outside and in. But he seemed
real sorry for once. And I was near sayin', 'Why don't ye cut the whole blessed
lot, then, and come home and work steady and make us all comfortable and
happy?' But when I looked again his face was all changed and hard-like. 'Off
you go,' he says, with his old voice. 'Next time I want either of you I'll send
Warrigal for you.'</p>
<p>And with that he walked off from the yard where we had been catching our
horses, and never looked nigh us again.</p>
<p>We rode away to the low end of the gully, and then we led the horses up,
foot by foot, and hard work it was&mdash;like climbing up the roof of a house.
We were almost done when we got to the tableland at the top.</p>
<p>We made our way to the yard, where there were the tracks of the cows all
round about it, but nothing but the wild horses had ever been there since.</p>
<p>'What a scrubby hole it is!' said Jim; 'I wonder how in the world they ever
found out the way to the Hollow?'</p>
<p>'Some runaway Government men, I believe, so that half-caste chap told me,
and a gin [*] showed 'em the track down, and where to get water and everything.
They lived on kangaroos at first. Then, by degrees, they used to crawl out by
moonlight and collar a horse or two or a few cattle. They managed to live there
years and years; one died, one was killed by the blacks; the last man showed it
to the chaps that passed it on to Starlight. Warrigal's mother, or aunt or
something, was the gin that showed it to the first white men.'</p>
<p>[* A black woman.]</p>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p>It was pretty late that night when we got home, and poor mother and Aileen
were that glad to see us that they didn't ask too many questions. Mother would
sit and look at the pair of us for ever so long without speaking, and then the
tears would come into her eyes and she'd turn away her head.</p>
<p>The old place looked very snug, clean, and comfortable, too, after all the
camping-out, and it was first-rate to have our own beds again. Then the milk
and fresh butter, and the eggs and bacon&mdash;my word! how Jim did lay in;
you'd have thought he was goin' on all night.</p>
<p>'By George! home's a jolly place after all,' he said. 'I am going to stay
ever so long this time, and work like an old near-side poler&mdash;see if I
don't. Let's look at your hands, Aileen; my word, you've been doin' your
share.'</p>
<p>'Indeed, has she,' said mother. 'It's a shame, so it is, and her with two
big brothers, too.'</p>
<p>'Poor Ailie,' said Jim, 'she had to take an axe, had she, in her pretty
little hands; but she didn't cut all that wood that's outside the door and I
nearly broke my neck over, I'll go bail.'</p>
<p>'How do you know?' says she, smiling roguish-like. 'All the world might have
been here for what you'd been the wiser&mdash;going away nobody knows where,
and coming home at night like&mdash;like&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Bush-rangers,' says I. 'Say it out; but we haven't turned out yet, if
that's what you mean, Miss Marston.'</p>
<p>'I don't mean anything but what's kind and loving, you naughty boy,' says
she, throwing her arms about my neck; 'but why will you break our hearts, poor
mother's and mine, by going off in such a wild way and staying away, as if you
were doing something that you were ashamed of?'</p>
<p>'Women shouldn't ask questions,' I said roughly. 'You'll know time enough,
and if you never know, perhaps it's all the better.'</p>
<p>Jim was alongside of mother by this time, lying down like a child on the old
native dogskin rug that we tanned ourselves with wattle bark. She had her hand
on his hair&mdash;thick and curly it was always from a child. She didn't say
anything, but I could see the tears drip, drip down from her face; her head was
on Jim's shoulder, and by and by he put his arms round her neck. I went off to
bed, I remember, and left them to it.</p>
<p>Next morning Jim and I were up at sunrise and got in the milkers, as we
always did when we were at home. Aileen was up too. She had done all the
dairying lately by herself. There were about a dozen cows to milk, and she had
managed it all herself every day that we were away; put up the calves every
afternoon, drove up the cows in the cold mornings, made the butter, which she
used to salt and put into a keg, and feed the pigs with the skim milk. It was
rather hard work for her, but I never saw her equal for farm work&mdash;rough
or smooth. And she used to manage to dress neat and look pretty all the time;
not like some small settlers' daughters that I have seen, slouching about with
a pair of Blucher boots on, no bonnet, a dirty frock, and a petticoat like a
blanket rag&mdash;not bad-looking girls either&mdash;and their hair like a dry
mop. No, Aileen was always neat and tidy, with a good pair of thick boots
outside and a thin pair for the house when she'd done her work.</p>
<p>She could frighten a wildish cow and bail up anything that would stay in a
yard with her. She could ride like a bird and drive bullocks on a pinch in a
dray or at plough, chop wood, too, as well as here and there a one. But when
she was in the house and regularly set down to her sewing she'd look that quiet
and steady-going you'd think she was only fit to teach in a school or sell
laces and gloves.</p>
<p>And so she was when she was let work in her own way, but if she was crossed
or put upon, or saw anything going wrong, she'd hold up her head and talk as
straight as any man I ever saw. She'd a look just like father when he'd made up
his mind, only her way was always the right way. What a difference it makes,
doesn't it? And she was so handsome with it. I've seen a goodish lot of women
since I left the old place, let alone her that's helped to put me where I am,
but I don't think I ever saw a girl that was a patch on Aileen for looks. She
had a wonderful fair skin, and her eyes were large and soft like poor mother's.
When she was a little raised-like you'd see a pink flush come on her cheeks
like a peach blossom in September, and her eyes had a bright startled look like
a doe kangaroo when she jumps up and looks round. Her teeth were as white and
even as a black gin's. The mouth was something like father's, and when she shut
it up we boys always knew she'd made up her mind, and wasn't going to be turned
from it. But her heart was that good that she was always thinking of others and
not of herself. I believe&mdash;I know&mdash;she'd have died for any one she
loved. She had more sense than all the rest of us put together. I've often
thought if she'd been the oldest boy instead of me she'd have kept Jim
straight, and managed to drive father out of his cross ways&mdash;that is, if
any one living could have done it. As for riding, I have never seen any one
that could sit a horse or handle him through rough, thick country like her. She
could ride barebacked, or next to it, sitting sideways on nothing but a
gunny-bag, and send a young horse flying through scrub and rocks, or down
ranges where you'd think a horse could hardly keep his feet. We could all ride
a bit out of the common, if it comes to that. Better if we'd learned nothing
but how to walk behind a plough, year in year out, like some of the folks in
father's village in England, as he used to tell us about when he was in a good
humour. But that's all as people are reared, I suppose. We'd been used to the
outside of a horse ever since we could walk almost, and it came natural to us.
Anyhow, I think Aileen was about the best of the lot of us at that, as in
everything else.</p>
<p>Well, for a bit all went on pretty well at home. Jim and I worked away
steady, got in a tidy bit of crop, and did everything that lay in our way right
and regular. We milked the cows in the morning, and brought in a big stack of
firewood and chopped as much as would last for a month or two. We mended up the
paddock fence, and tidied the garden. The old place hadn't looked so smart for
many a day.</p>
<p>When we came in at night old mother used to look that pleased and happy we
couldn't help feeling better in our hearts. Aileen used to read something out
of the paper that she thought might amuse us. I could read pretty fair, and so
could Jim; but we were both lazy at it, and after working pretty hard all day
didn't so much care about spelling out the long words in the farming news or
the stories they put in. All the same, it would have paid us better if we'd
read a little more and put the 'bullocking' on one side, at odd times. A man
can learn as much out of a book or a paper sometimes in an hour as will save
his work for a week, or put him up to working to better purpose. I can see that
now&mdash;too late, and more's the pity.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Aileen could read pretty near as fast as any one I ever saw, and she
used to reel it out for us, as we sat smoking over the fire, in a way that kept
us jolly and laughing till it was nearly turning-in time. Now and then George
Storefield would come and stay an hour or two. He could read well; nearly as
well as she could. Then he had always something to show her that she'd been
asking about. His place was eight miles off, but he'd always get his horse and
go home, whatever the night was like.</p>
<p>'I must be at my work in the morning,' he'd say; 'it's more than half a day
gone if you lose that, and I've no half-days to spare, or quarter-days
either.'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>So we all got on first-rate, and anybody would have thought that there
wasn't a more steady-going, hard-working, happy family in the colony. No more
there wasn't, while it lasted. After all, what is there that's half as good as
being all right and square, working hard for the food you eat, and the sleep
you enjoy, able to look all the world in the face, and afraid of nothing and
nobody!</p>
<p>We were so quiet and comfortable till the winter was over and the spring
coming on, till about September, that I almost began to believe we'd never done
anything in our lives we could be made to suffer for.</p>
<p>Now and then, of course, I used to wake up in the night, and my thoughts
would go back to 'Terrible Hollow', that wonderful place; and one night with
the unbranded cattle, and Starlight, with the blood dripping on to his horse's
shoulder, and the half-caste, with his hawk's eye and glittering
teeth&mdash;father, with his gloomy face and dark words. I wondered whether it
was all a dream; whether I and Jim had been in at all; whether any of the
'cross-work' had been found out; and, if so, what would be done to me and Jim;
most of all, though, whether father and Starlight were away after some 'big
touch'; and, if so, where and what it was, and how soon we should hear of
it.</p>
<p>As for Jim, he was one of those happy-go-lucky fellows that didn't bother
himself about anything he didn't see or run against. I don't think it ever
troubled him. It was the only bad thing he'd ever been in. He'd been drawn in
against his will, and I think he had made up his mind&mdash;pretty
nearly&mdash;not to go in for any more.</p>
<p>I have often seen Aileen talking to him, and they'd walk along in the
evening when the work was done&mdash;he with his arm round her waist, and she
looking at him with that quiet, pleased face of hers, seeming so proud and fond
of him, as if he'd been the little chap she used to lead about and put on the
old pony, and bring into the calf-pen when she was milking. I remember he had a
fight with a little bull-calf, about a week old, that came in with a wild
heifer, and Aileen made as much of his pluck as if it had been a mallee
scrubber. The calf baaed and butted at Jim, as even the youngest of them will,
if they've the wild blood in 'em, and nearly upset him; he was only a bit of a
toddler. But Jim picked up a loose leg of a milking-stool, and the two went at
it hammer and tongs. I could hardly stand for laughing, till the calf gave him
best and walked.</p>
<p>Aileen pulled him out, and carried him in to mother, telling her that he was
the bravest little chap in the world; and I remember I got scolded for not
going to help him. How these little things come back!</p>
<p>'I'm beginning to be afraid,' says George, one evening, 'that it's going to
be a dry season.'</p>
<p>'There's plenty of time yet,' says Jim, who always took the bright side of
things; 'it might rain towards the end of the month.'</p>
<p>'I was thinking the same thing,' I said. 'We haven't had any rain to speak
of for a couple of months, and that bit of wheat of ours is beginning to go
back. The oats look better.'</p>
<p>'Now I think of it,' put in Jim, 'Dick Dawson came in from outside, and he
said things are shocking bad; all the frontage bare already, and the water
drying up.'</p>
<p>'It's always the way,' I said, bitter-like. 'As soon as a poor man's got a
chance of a decent crop, the season turns against him or prices go down, so
that he never gets a chance.'</p>
<p>'It's as bad for the rich man, isn't it?' said George. 'It's God's will, and
we can't make or mend things by complaining.'</p>
<p>'I don't know so much about that,' I said sullenly. 'But it's not as bad for
the rich man. Even if the squatters suffer by a drought and lose their stock,
they've more stock and money in the bank, or else credit to fall back on; while
the like of us lose all we have in the world, and no one would lend us a pound
afterwards to save our lives.'</p>
<p>'It's not quite so bad as that,' said George. 'I shall lose my year's work
unless rain comes, and most of the cattle and horses besides; but I shall be
able to get a few pounds to go on with, however the season goes.'</p>
<p>'Oh! if you like to bow and scrape to rich people, well and good,' I said;
'but that's not my way. We have as good a right to our share of the land and
some other good things as they have, and why should we be done out of it?'</p>
<p>'If we pay for the land as they do, certainly,' said George.</p>
<p>'But why should we pay? God Almighty, I suppose, made the land and the
people too, one to live on the other. Why should we pay for what is our own? I
believe in getting my share somehow.'</p>
<p>'That's a sort of argument that doesn't come out right,' said George. 'How
would you like another man to come and want to halve the farm with you?'</p>
<p>'I shouldn't mind; I should go halves with some one else who had a bigger
one,' I said. 'More money too, more horses, more sheep, a bigger house! Why
should he have it and not me?'</p>
<p>'That's a lazy man's argument, and&mdash;well, not an honest man's,' said
George, getting up and putting on his cabbage-tree. 'I can't sit and hear you
talk such rot. Nobody can work better than you and Jim, when you like. I wonder
you don't leave such talk to fellows like Frowser, that's always spouting at
the Shearers' Arms.'</p>
<p>'Nonsense or not, if a dry season comes and knocks all our work over, I
shall help myself to some one's stuff that has more than he knows what to do
with.'</p>
<p>'Why can't we all go shearing, and make as much as will keep us for six
months?' said George. 'I don't know what we'd do without the squatters.'</p>
<p>'Nor I either; more ways than one; but Jim and I are going shearing next
week. So perhaps there won't be any need for "duffing" after all.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Dick!' said Aileen, 'I can't bear to hear you make a joke of that kind
of thing. Don't we all know what it leads to! Wouldn't it be better to live on
dry bread and be honest than to be full of money and never know the day when
you'd be dragged to gaol?'</p>
<p>'I've heard all that before; but ain't there lots of people that have made
their money by all sorts of villainy, that look as well as the best, and never
see a gaol?'</p>
<p>'They're always caught some day,' says poor Aileen, sobbing, 'and what a
dreadful life of anxiety they must lead!'</p>
<p>'Not at all,' I said. 'Look at Lucksly, Squeezer, and Frying-pan Jack.
Everybody knows how they got their stock and their money. See how they live.
They've got stations, and public-house and town property, and they get richer
every year. I don't think it pays to be too honest in a dry country.'</p>
<p>'You're a naughty boy, Dick; isn't he, Jim?' she said, smiling through her
tears. 'But he doesn't mean half what he says, does he?'</p>
<p>'Not he,' says Jim; 'and very likely we'll have lots of rain after all.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p>The 'big squatter', as he was called on our side of the country, was Mr.
Falkland. He was an Englishman that had come young to the colony, and worked
his way up by degrees. He had had no money when he first came, people said;
indeed, he often said so himself. He was not proud, at any rate in that way,
for he was not above telling a young fellow that he should never be downhearted
because he hadn't a coat to his back or a shilling in his pocket, because he,
Herbert Falkland, had known what it was to be without either. 'This was the
best country in the whole world,' he used to say, 'for a gentleman who was poor
or a working man.' The first sort could always make an independence if they
were moderately strong, liked work, and did not drink. There were very few
countries where idle, unsteady people got rich. 'As for the poor man, he was
the real rich man in Australia; high wages, cheap food, lodging, clothing,
travelling. What more did he want? He could save money, live happily, and die
rich, if he wasn't a fool or a rogue. Unfortunately, these last were highly
popular professions; and many people, high and low, belonged to them
here&mdash;and everywhere else.'</p>
<p>We were all well up in this kind of talk, because for the last two or three
years, since we had begun to shear pretty well, we had always shorn at his
shed. He was one of those gentlemen&mdash;and he was a gentleman, if ever there
was one&mdash;that takes a deal of notice of his working hands, particularly if
they were young. Jim he took a great fancy to the first moment he saw him. He
didn't care so much about me.</p>
<p>'You're a sulky young dog, Richard Marston,' he used to say. 'I'm not sure
that you'll come to any good; and though I don't like to say all I hear about
your father before you, I'm afraid he doesn't teach you anything worth knowing.
But Jim there's a grand fellow; if he'd been caught young and weaned from all
of your lot, he'd have been an honour to the land he was born in. He's too good
for you all.'</p>
<p>'Every one of you gentlemen wants to be a small God Almighty,' I said
impudently. 'You'd like to break us all in and put us in yokes and bows, like a
lot of working bullocks.'</p>
<p>'You mistake me, my boy, and all the rest of us who are worth calling men,
let alone gentlemen. We are your best friends, and would help you in every way
if you'd only let us.'</p>
<p>'I don't see so much of that.'</p>
<p>'Because you often fight against your own good. We should like to see you
all have farms of your own&mdash;to be all well taught and able to make the
best of your lives&mdash;not driven to drink, as many of you are, because you
have no notion of any rational amusement, and anything between hard work and
idle dissipation.'</p>
<p>'And suppose you had all this power,' I said&mdash;for if I was afraid of
father there wasn't another man living that could overcrow me&mdash;'don't you
think you'd know the way to keep all the good things for yourselves? Hasn't it
always been so?'</p>
<p>'I see your argument,' he said, quite quiet and reasonable, just as if I had
been a swell like himself&mdash;that was why he was unlike any other man I ever
knew&mdash;'and it is a perfectly fair way of putting it. But your class might,
I think, always rely upon there being enough kindness and wisdom in ours to
prevent that state of things. Unfortunately, neither side trusts the other
enough. And now the bell is going to ring, I think.'</p>
<p>Jim and I stopped at Boree shed till all the sheep were cut out. It pays
well if the weather is pretty fair, and it isn't bad fun when there's twenty or
thirty chaps of the right sort in the shearers' hut; there's always some fun
going on. Shearers work pretty hard, and as they buy their own rations
generally, they can afford to live well. After a hard day's shearing&mdash;that
is, from five o'clock in the morning to seven at night, going best pace all the
time, every man working as hard as if he was at it for his life&mdash;one would
think a man would be too tired to do anything. But we were mostly strong and
hearty, and at that age a man takes a deal of killing; so we used to have a
little card-playing at night to pass away the time.</p>
<p>Very few of the fellows had any money to spend. They couldn't get any either
until shearing was over and they were paid off; but they'd get some one who
could write to scribble a lot of I O U's, and they did as well.</p>
<p>We used to play 'all-fours' and 'loo', and now and then an American game
which some of the fellows had picked up. It was strange how soon we managed to
get into big stakes. I won at first, and then Jim and I began to lose, and had
such a lot of I O U's out that I was afraid we'd have no money to take home
after shearing. Then I began to think what a fool I'd been to play myself and
drag Jim into it, for he didn't want to play at first.</p>
<p>One day I got a couple of letters from home&mdash;one from Aileen and
another in a strange hand. It had come to our little post-office, and Aileen
had sent it on to Boree.</p>
<p>When I opened it there were a few lines, with father's name at the bottom.
He couldn't write, so I made sure that Starlight had written it for him. He was
quite well, it said; and to look out for him about Christmas time; he might
come home then, or send for us; to stop at Boree if we could get work, and keep
a couple of horses in good trim, as he might want us. A couple of five-pound
notes fell out of the letter as I opened it.</p>
<p>When I looked at them first I felt a kind of fear. I knew what they came
from. And I had a sort of feeling that we should be better without them.
However, the devil was too strong for me. Money's a tempting thing, whether
it's notes or gold, especially when a man's in debt. I had begun to think the
fellows looked a little cool on us the last three or four nights, as our losses
were growing big.</p>
<p>So I gave Jim his share; and after tea, when we sat down again, there
weren't more than a dozen of us that were in the card racket. I flung down my
note, and Jim did his, and told them that we owed to take the change out of
that and hand us over their paper for the balance.</p>
<p>They all stared, for such a thing hadn't been seen since the shearing began.
Shearers, as a rule, come from their homes in the settled districts very bare.
They are not very well supplied with clothes; their horses are poor and done
up; and they very seldom have a note in their pockets, unless they have managed
to sell a spare horse on the journey.</p>
<p>So we were great men for the time, looked at by the others with wonder and
respect. We were fools enough to be pleased with it. Strangely, too, our luck
turned from that minute, and it ended in our winning not only our own back, but
more than as much more from the other men.</p>
<p>I don't think Mr. Falkland liked these goings on. He wouldn't have allowed
cards at all if he could have helped it. He was a man that hated what was
wrong, and didn't value his own interest a pin when it came in the way.
However, the shearing hut was our own, in a manner of speaking, and as long as
we shore clean and kept the shed going the overseer, Mr. M'Intyre, didn't
trouble his head much about our doings in the hut. He was anxious to get done
with the shearing, to get the wool into the bales before the dust came in, and
the grass seed ripened, and the clover burrs began to fall.</p>
<p>'Why should ye fash yoursel',' I heard him say once to Mr. Falkland, 'aboot
these young deevils like the Marstons? They're as good's ready money in auld
Nick's purse. It's bred and born and welded in them. Ye'll just have the burrs
and seeds amang the wool if ye keep losing a smart shearer for the sake o' a
wheen cards and dice; and ye'll mak' nae heed of convairtin' thae young
caterans ony mair than ye'll change a Norroway falcon into a barn-door
chuckie.'</p>
<p>I wonder if what he said was true&mdash;if we couldn't help it; if it was in
our blood? It seems like it; and yet it's hard lines to think a fellow must
grow up and get on the cross in spite of himself, and come to the gallows-foot
at last, whether he likes it or not. The parson here isn't bad at all. He's a
man and a gentleman, too; and he's talked and read to me by the hour. I suppose
some of us chaps are like the poor stupid tribes that the Israelites found in
Canaan, only meant to live for a bit and then to be rubbed out to make room for
better people.</p>
<p>When the shearing was nearly over we had a Saturday afternoon to ourselves.
We had finished all the sheep that were in the shed, and old M'Intyre didn't
like to begin a fresh flock. So we got on our horses and took a ride into the
township just for the fun of the thing, and for a little change. The horses had
got quite fresh with the rest and the spring grass. Their coats were shining,
and they all looked very different from what they did when we first came. Our
two were not so poor when they came, so they looked the best of the lot, and
jumped about in style when we mounted. Ah! only to think of a good horse.</p>
<p>All the men washed themselves and put on clean clothes. Then we had our
dinner and about a dozen of us started off for the town.</p>
<p>Poor old Jim, how well he looked that day! I don't think you could pick a
young fellow anywhere in the countryside that was a patch on him for good looks
and manliness, somewhere about six foot or a little over, as straight as a
rush, with a bright blue eye that was always laughing and twinkling, and curly
dark brown hair. No wonder all the girls used to think so much of him. He could
do anything and everything that a man could do. He was as strong as a young
bull, and as active as a rock wallaby&mdash;and ride! Well, he sat on his horse
as if he was born on one. With his broad shoulders and upright easy seat he was
a regular picture on a good horse.</p>
<p>And he had a good one under him to-day; a big, brown, resolute, well-bred
horse he had got in a swap because the man that had him was afraid of him. Now
that he had got a little flesh on his bones he looked something quite out of
the common. 'A deal too good for a poor man, and him honest,' as old M'Intyre
said.</p>
<p>But Jim turned on him pretty sharp, and said he had got the horse in a fair
deal, and had as much right to a good mount as any one else&mdash;super or
squatter, he didn't care who he was.</p>
<p>And Mr. Falkland took Jim's part, and rather made Mr. M'Intyre out in the
wrong for saying what he did. The old man didn't say much more, only shook his
head, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>'Ah, ye're a grand laddie, and buirdly, and no that thrawn,
either&mdash;like ye, Dick, ye born deevil,' looking at me. 'But I misdoot sair
ye'll die wi' your boots on. There's a smack o' Johnnie Armstrong in the glint
o' yer e'e. Ye'll be to dree yer weird, there's nae help for't.'</p>
<p>'What's all that lingo, Mr. M'Intyre?' called out Jim, all good-natured
again. 'Is it French or Queensland blacks' yabber? Blest if I understand a word
of it. But I didn't want to be nasty, only I am regular shook on this old moke,
I believe, and he's as square as Mr. Falkland's dogcart horse.'</p>
<p>'Maybe ye bocht him fair eneugh. I'll no deny you. I saw the receipt mysel'.
But where did yon lang-leggit, long-lockit, Fish River moss-trooping callant
win haud o' him? Answer me that, Jeems.'</p>
<p>'That says nothing,' answered Jim. 'I'm not supposed to trace back every
horse in the country and find out all the people that owned him since he was a
foal. He's mine now, and mine he'll be till I get a better one.'</p>
<p>'A contuma-acious and stiff-necked generation,' said the old man, walking
off and shaking his head. 'And yet he's a fine laddie; a gra-and laddie wad he
be with good guidance. It's the Lord's doing, nae doot, and we daurna fault it;
it's wondrous in our een.'</p>
<p>That was the way old Mac always talked. Droll lingo, wasn't it?</p>
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Well, away we went to this township. Bundah was the name of it; not that
there was anything to do or see when we got there. It was the regular
up-country village, with a public-house, a store, a pound, and a blacksmith's
shop. However, a public-house is not such a bad place&mdash;at any rate it's
better than nothing when a fellow's young and red-hot for anything like a bit
of fun, or even a change. Some people can work away day after day, and year
after year, like a bullock in a team or a horse in a chaff-cutting machine.
It's all the better for them if they can, though I suppose they never enjoy
themselves except in a cold-blooded sort of way. But there's other men that
can't do that sort of thing, and it's no use talking. They must have life and
liberty and a free range. There's some birds, and animals too, that either pine
in a cage or kill themselves, and I suppose it's the same way with some men.
They can't stand the cage of what's called honest labour, which means working
for some one else for twenty or thirty years, never having a day to yourself,
or doing anything you like, and saving up a trifle for your old age when you
can't enjoy it. I don't wonder youngsters break traces and gallop off like a
colt out of a team.</p>
<p>Besides, sometimes there's a good-looking girl even at a bush public, the
daughter or the barmaid, and it's odd, now, what a difference that makes.
There's a few glasses of grog going, a little noisy, rattling talk, a few
smiles and a saucy answer or two from the girl, a look at the last newspaper,
or a bit of the town news from the landlord; he's always time to read. Hang
him&mdash;I mean confound him&mdash;for he's generally a sly old spider who
sucks us fellows pretty dry, and then don't care what becomes of us. Well, it
don't amount to much, but it's life&mdash;the only taste of it that chaps like
us are likely to get. And people may talk as much as they like; boys, and men
too, will like it, and take to it, and hanker after it, as long as the world
lasts. There's danger in it, and misery, and death often enough comes of it,
but what of that? If a man wants a swim on the seashore he won't stand all day
on the beach because he may be drowned or snapped up by a shark, or knocked
against a rock, or tired out and drawn under by the surf. No, if he's a man
he'll jump in and enjoy himself all the more because the waves are high and the
waters deep. So it was very good fun to us, simple as it might sound to some
people. It was pleasant to be bowling along over the firm green turf, along the
plain, through the forest, gully, and over the creek. Our horses were fresh,
and we had a scurry or two, of course; but there wasn't one that could hold a
candle to Jim's brown horse. He was a long-striding, smooth goer, but he got
over the ground in wonderful style. He could jump, too, for Jim put him over a
big log fence or two, and he sailed over them like a forester buck over the
head of a fallen wattle.</p>
<p>Well, we'd had our lark at the Bundah Royal Hotel, and were coming home to
tea at the station, all in good spirits, but sober enough, when, just as we
were crossing one of the roads that came through the run&mdash;over the 'Pretty
Plain', as they called it&mdash;we heard a horse coming along best pace. When
we looked who should it be but Miss Falkland, the owner's only daughter.</p>
<p>She was an only child, and the very apple of her father's eye, you may be
sure. The shearers mostly knew her by sight, because she had taken a fancy to
come down with her father a couple of times to see the shed when we were all in
full work.</p>
<p>A shed's not exactly the best place for a young lady to come into. Shearers
are rough in their language now and then. But every man liked and respected Mr.
Falkland, so we all put ourselves on our best behaviour, and the two or three
flash fellows who had no sense or decent feeling were warned that if they broke
out at all they would get something to remember it by.</p>
<p>But when we saw that beautiful, delicate-looking creature stepping down the
boards between the two rows of shearers, most of them stripped to their jerseys
and working like steam-engines, looking curiously and pitifully at the tired
men and the patient sheep, with her great, soft, dark eyes and fair white face
like a lily, we began to think we'd heard of angels from heaven, but never seen
one before.</p>
<p>Just as she came opposite Jim, who was trying to shear sheep and sheep with
the 'ringer' of the shed, who was next on our right, the wether he was holding
kicked, and knocking the shears out of his hand, sent them point down against
his wrist. One of the points went right in, and though it didn't cut the
sinews, as luck would have it, the point stuck out at the other side; out
spurted the blood, and Jim was just going to let out when he looked up and saw
Miss Falkland looking at him, with her beautiful eyes so full of pity and
surprise that he could have had his hand chopped off, so he told me afterwards,
rather than vex her for a moment. So he shut up his mouth and ground his teeth
together, for it was no joke in the way of pain, and the blood began to run
like a blind creek after a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>'Oh! poor fellow. What a dreadful cut! Look, papa!' she cried out. 'Hadn't
something better be bound round it? How it bleeds! Does it pain much?'</p>
<p>'Not a bit, miss!' said Jim, standing up like a schoolboy going to say his
lesson. 'That is, it doesn't matter if it don't stop my shearing.'</p>
<p>'Tar!' sings out my next-door neighbour. 'Here, boy; tar wanted for No. 36.
That'll put it all right, Jim; it's only a scratch.'</p>
<p>'You mind your shearing, my man,' said Mr. Falkland quietly. 'I don't know
whether Mr. M'Intyre will quite approve of that last sheep of yours. This is
rather a serious wound. The best thing is to bind it up at once.'</p>
<p>Before any one could say another word Miss Falkland had whipped out her soft
fine cambric handkerchief and torn it in two.</p>
<p>'Hold up your hand,' she said. 'Now, papa, lend me yours.' With the last she
cleared the wound of the flowing blood, and then neatly and skilfully bound up
the wrist firmly with the strips of cambric. This she further protected by her
father's handkerchief, which she helped herself to and finally stopped the
blood with.</p>
<p>Jim kept looking at her small white hands all the time she was doing it.
Neither of us had ever seen such before&mdash;the dainty skin, the pink nails,
the glittering rings.</p>
<p>'There,' she said, 'I don't think you ought to shear any more to-day; it
might bring on inflammation. I'll send to know how it gets on to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'No, miss; my grateful thanks, miss,' said Jim, opening his eyes and looking
as if he'd like to drop down on his knees and pray to her. 'I shall never
forget your goodness, Miss Falkland, if I live till I'm a hundred.' Then Jim
bent his head a bit&mdash;I don't suppose he ever made a bow in his life
before&mdash;and then drew himself up as straight as a soldier, and Miss
Falkland made a kind of bow and smile to us all and passed out.</p>
<p>Jim did shear all the same that afternoon, though the tally wasn't any great
things. 'I can't go and lie down in a bunk in the men's hut,' he said; 'I must
chance it,' and he did. Next day it was worse and very painful, but Jim stuck
to the shears, though he used to turn white with the pain at times, and I
thought he'd faint. However, it gradually got better, and, except a scar, Jim's
hand was as good as ever.</p>
<p>Jim sent back Mr. Falkland's handkerchief after getting the cook to wash it
and iron it out with a bit of a broken axletree; but the strips of white
handkerchief&mdash;one had C. F. in the corner&mdash;he put away in his swag,
and made some foolish excuse when I laughed at him about it.</p>
<p>She sent down a boy from the house next day to ask how Jim's hand was, and
the day after that, but she never came to the shed any more. So we didn't see
her again.</p>
<p>So it was this young lady that we saw coming tearing down the back road, as
they called it, that led over the Pretty Plain. A good way behind we saw Mr.
Falkland, but he had as much chance of coming up with her as a cattle dog of
catching a 'brush flyer'.</p>
<p>The stable boy, Billy Donnellan, had told us (of course, like all those sort
of youngsters, he was fond of getting among the men and listening to them talk)
all about Miss Falkland's new mare.</p>
<p>She was a great beauty and thoroughbred. The stud groom had bought her out
of a travelling mob from New England when she was dog-poor and hardly able to
drag herself along. Everybody thought she was going to be the best lady's horse
in the district; but though she was as quiet as a lamb at first she had begun
to show a nasty temper lately, and to get very touchy. 'I don't care about
chestnuts myself,' says Master Billy, smoking a short pipe as if he was thirty;
'they've a deal of temper, and she's got too much white in her eye for my
money. I'm afeard she'll do some mischief afore we've done with her; and Miss
Falkland's that game as she won't have nothing done to her. I'd ride the tail
off her but what I'd bring her to, if I had my way.'</p>
<p>So this was the brute that had got away with Miss Falkland, the day we were
coming back from Bundah. Some horses, and a good many men and women, are all
pretty right as long as they're well kept under and starved a bit at odd times.
But give them an easy life and four feeds of corn a day, and they're
troublesome brutes, and mischievous too.</p>
<p>It seems this mare came of a strain that had turned out more devils and
killed more grooms and breakers than any other in the country. She was a
Troubadour, it seems; there never was a Troubadour yet that wouldn't buck and
bolt, and smash himself and his rider, if he got a fright, or his temper was
roused. Men and women, horses and dogs, are very much alike. I know which can
talk best. As to the rest, I don't know whether there's so much for us to be
proud of.</p>
<p>It seems that this cranky wretch of a mare had been sideling and fidgeting
when Mr. Falkland and his daughter started for their ride; but had gone pretty
fairly&mdash;Miss Falkland, like my sister Aileen, could ride anything in
reason&mdash;when suddenly a dead limb dropped off a tree close to the side of
the road.</p>
<p>I believe she made one wild plunge, and set to; she propped and reared, but
Miss Falkland sat her splendidly and got her head up. When she saw she could do
nothing that way, she stretched out her head and went off as hard as she could
lay legs to the ground.</p>
<p>She had one of those mouths that are not so bad when horses are going easy,
but get quite callous when they are over-eager and excited. Anyhow, it was like
trying to stop a mail-coach going down Mount Victoria with the brake off.</p>
<p>So what we saw was the wretch of a mare coming along as if the devil was
after her, and heading straight across the plain at its narrowest part; it
wasn't more than half-a-mile wide there, in fact, it was more like a flat than
a plain. The people about Boree didn't see much open country, so they made a
lot out of what they had.</p>
<p>The mare, like some women when they get their monkey up, was clean out of
her senses, and I don't believe anything could have held her under a hide rope
with a turn round a stockyard post. This was what she wanted, and if it had
broken her infernal neck so much the better.</p>
<p>Miss Falkland was sitting straight and square, with her hands down, leaning
a bit back, and doing her level best to stop the brute. Her hat was off and her
hair had fallen down and hung down her back&mdash;plenty of it there was, too.
The mare's neck was stretched straight out; her mouth was like a deal board, I
expect, by that time.</p>
<p>We didn't sit staring at her all the time, you bet. We could see the boy
ever so far off. We gathered up our reins and went after her, not in a hurry,
but just collecting ourselves a bit to see what would be the best way to wheel
the brute and stop her.</p>
<p>Jim's horse was far and away the fastest, and he let out to head the mare
off from a creek that was just in front and at the end of the plain.</p>
<p>'By George!' said one of the men&mdash;a young fellow who lived near the
place&mdash;'the mare's turning off her course, and she's heading straight for
the Trooper's Downfall, where the policeman was killed. If she goes over that,
they'll be smashed up like a matchbox, horse and rider.'</p>
<p>'What's that?' I said, closing up alongside of him. We were all doing our
best, and were just in the line to back up Jim, who looked as if he was
overhauling the mare fast.</p>
<p>'Why, it's a bluff a hundred feet deep&mdash;a straight drop&mdash;and rocks
at the bottom. She's making as straight as a bee-line for it now, blast
her!'</p>
<p>'And Jim don't know it,' I said; 'he's closing up to her, but he doesn't
calculate to do it for a quarter of a mile more; he's letting her take it out
of herself.'</p>
<p>'He'll never catch her in time,' said the young chap. 'My God! it's an awful
thing, isn't it? and a fine young lady like her&mdash;so kind to us chaps as
she was.'</p>
<p>'I'll see if I can make Jim hear,' I said, for though I looked cool I was as
nearly mad as I could be to think of such a girl being lost before our eyes.
'No, I can't do that, but I'll <i>telegraph</i>.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Now Jim and I had had many a long talk together about what we should do in
case we wanted to signal to each other very pressing. We thought the time might
come some day when we might be near enough to sign, but not to speak. So we hit
upon one or two things a little out of the common.</p>
<p>The first idea was, in case of one wanting to give the other the office that
he was to look out his very brightest for danger, and not to trust to what
appeared to be the state of affairs, the sign was to hold up your hat or cap
straight over your head. If the danger threatened on the left, to shift to that
side. If it was very pressing and on the jump, as it were, quite unexpected,
and as bad as bad could be, the signalman was to get up on the saddle with his
knees and turn half round.</p>
<p>We could do this easy enough and a lot of circus tricks besides. How had we
learned them? Why, in the long days we had spent in the saddle tailing the
milkers and searching after lost horses for many a night.</p>
<p>As luck would have it Jim looked round to see how we were getting on, and up
went my cap. I could see him turn his head and keep watching me when I put on
the whole box and dice of the telegraph business. He 'dropped', I could see. He
took up the brown horse, and made such a rush to collar the mare that showed he
intended to see for himself what the danger was. The cross-grained jade! She
was a well-bred wretch, and be hanged to her! Went as if she wanted to win the
Derby and gave Jim all he knew to challenge her. We could see a line of timber
just ahead of her, and that Jim was riding for his life.</p>
<p>'By &mdash;&mdash;! they'll both be over it,' said the young shearer. 'They
can't stop themselves at that pace, and they must be close up now.'</p>
<p>'He's neck and neck,' I said. 'Stick to her, Jim, old man!'</p>
<p>We were all close together now. Several of the men knew the place, and the
word had been passed round.</p>
<p>No one spoke for a few seconds. We saw the two horses rush up at top speed
to the very edge of the timber.</p>
<p>'By Jove! they're over. No! he's reaching for her rein. It's no use.
Now&mdash;now! She's saved! Oh, my God! they're both right. By the Lord, well
done! Hurrah! One cheer more for Jim Marston!'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>It was all right. We saw Jim suddenly reach over as the horses were going
stride and stride; saw him lift Miss Falkland from her saddle as if she had
been a child and place her before him; saw the brown horse prop, and swing
round on his haunches in a way that showed he had not been called the crack
'cutting-out' horse on a big cattle run for nothing. We saw Jim jump to the
ground and lift the young lady down. We saw only one horse.</p>
<p>Three minutes after Mr. Falkland overtook us, and we rode up together. His
face was white, and his dry lips couldn't find words at first. But he managed
to say to Jim, when we got up&mdash;</p>
<p>'You have saved my child's life, James Marston, and if I forget the service
may God in that hour forget me. You are a noble fellow. You must allow me to
show my gratitude in some way.'</p>
<p>'You needn't thank me so out and out as all that, Mr. Falkland,' said Jim,
standing up very straight and looking at the father first, and then at Miss
Falkland, who was pale and trembling, not altogether from fear, but excitement,
and trying to choke back the sobs that would come out now and then. 'I'd risk
life and limb any day before Miss Falkland's finger should be scratched, let
alone see her killed before my eyes. I wonder if there's anything left of the
mare, poor thing; not that she don't deserve it all, and more.'</p>
<p>Here we all walked forward to the deep creek bank. A yard or two farther and
the brown horse and his burden must have gone over the terrible drop, as
straight as a plumb-line, on to the awful rocks below. We could see where the
brown had torn up the turf as he struck all four hoofs deep into it at once.
Indeed, he had been newly shod, a freak of Jim's about a bet with a travelling
blacksmith. Then the other tracks, the long score on the brink&mdash;over the
brink&mdash;where the frightened, maddened animal had made an attempt to alter
her speed, all in vain, and had plunged over the bank and the hundred feet of
fall.</p>
<p>We peered over, and saw a bright-coloured mass among the rocks
below&mdash;very still. Just at the time one of the ration-carriers came by
with a spring cart. Mr. Falkland lifted his daughter in and took the reins,
leaving his horse to be ridden home by the ration-carrier. As for us we rode
back to the shearers' hut, not quite so fast as we came, with Jim in the
middle. He did not seem inclined to talk much.</p>
<p>'It's lucky I turned round when I did, Dick,' he said at last, 'and saw you
making the "danger-look-out-sharp" signal. I couldn't think what the dickens it
was. I was so cocksure of catching the mare in half-a-mile farther that I
couldn't help wondering what it was all about. Anyhow, I knew we agreed it was
never to be worked for nothing, so thought the best thing I could do was to
call in the mare, and see if I could find out anything then. When I got
alongside, I could see that Miss Falkland's face was that white that something
must be up. It weren't the mare she was afraid of. She was coming back to her.
It took something to frighten her, I knew. So it must be something I did not
know, or didn't see.</p>
<p>'"What is it, Miss Falkland?" I said.</p>
<p>'"Oh!" she cried out, "don't you know? Another fifty yards and we'll be over
the downfall where the trooper was killed. Oh, my poor father!"</p>
<p>'"Don't be afraid," I said. "We'll not go over if I can help it."</p>
<p>'So I reached over and got hold of the reins. I pulled and jerked. She said
her hands were cramped, and no wonder. Pulling double for a four-mile heat is
no joke, even if a man's in training. Fancy a woman, a young girl, having to
sit still and drag at a runaway horse all the time. I couldn't stop the brute;
she was boring like a wild bull. So just as we came pretty close I lifted Miss
Falkland off the saddle and yelled at old Brownie as if I had been on a cattle
camp, swinging round to the near side at the same time. Round he came like one
o'clock. I could see the mare make one prop to stop herself, and then go flying
right through the air, till I heard a beastly "thud" at the bottom.</p>
<p>'Miss Falkland didn't faint, though she turned white and then red, and
trembled like a leaf when I lifted her down, and looked up at me with a sweet
smile, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>'"Jim, you have paid me for binding up your wrist, haven't you? You have
saved me from a horrible death, and I shall think of you as a brave and noble
fellow all the days of my life."</p>
<p>'What could I say?' said Jim. 'I stared at her like a fool. "I'd have gone
over the bank with you, Miss Falkland," I said, "if I could not have saved
you."</p>
<p>'"Well, I'm afraid some of my admirers would have stopped short of that,
James," she said. She did indeed. And then Mr. Falkland and all of you came
up.'</p>
<p>'I say, Jim,' said one of the young fellows, 'your fortune's made. Mr.
Falkland 'll stand a farm, you may be sure, for this little fakement.'</p>
<p>'And I say, Jack,' says old Jim, very quiet like, 'I've told you all the
yarn, and if there's any chaff about it after this the cove will have to see
whether he's best man or me; so don't make any mistake now.'</p>
<p>There was no more chaff. They weren't afraid. There were two or three of
them pretty smart with their hands, and not likely to take much from anybody.
But Jim was a heavy weight and could hit like a horse kicking; so they thought
it wasn't good enough, and left him alone.</p>
<p>Next day Mr. Falkland came down and wanted to give Jim a cheque for a
hundred; but he wouldn't hear of so much as a note. Then he said he'd give him
a billet on the run&mdash;make him under overseer; after a bit buy a farm for
him and stock it. No! Jim wouldn't touch nothing or take a billet on the place.
He wouldn't leave his family, he said. And as for taking money or anything else
for saving Miss Falkland's life, it was ridiculous to think of it. There wasn't
a man of the lot in the shed, down to the tarboy, that wouldn't have done the
same, or tried to. All that was in it was that his horse was the fastest.</p>
<p>'It's not a bad thing for a poor man to have a fast horse now and then, is
it, Mr. Falkland?' he said, looking up and smiling, just like a boy. He was
very shy, was poor Jim.</p>
<p>'I don't grudge a poor man a good horse or anything else he likes to have or
enjoy. You know that, all of you. It's the fear I have of the effect of the
dishonest way that horses of value are come by, and the net of roguery that
often entangles fine young fellows like you and your brother; that's what I
fear,' said Mr. Falkland, looking at the pair of us so kind and pitiful
like.</p>
<p>I looked him in the face, though I felt I could not say he was wrong. I
felt, too, just then, as if I could have given all the world to be afraid of no
man's opinion.</p>
<p>What a thing it is to be perfectly honest and straight&mdash;to be able to
look the whole world in the face!</p>
<p>But if more gentlemen were like Mr. Falkland I do really believe no one
would rob them for very shame's sake. When shearing was over we were all paid
up&mdash;shearers, washers, knock-about men, cooks, and extra shepherds. Every
soul about the place except Mr. M'Intyre and Mr. Falkland seemed to have got a
cheque and a walking-ticket at the same time. Away they went, like a lot of
boys out of school; and half of 'em didn't show as much sense either. As for me
and Jim we had no particular wish to go home before Christmas. So as there's
always contracts to be let about a big run like Banda we took a contract for
some bush work, and went at it. Mr. M'Intyre looked quite surprised. But Mr.
Falkland praised us up, and was proud we were going to turn over a new
leaf.</p>
<p>Nobody could say at that time we didn't work. Fencing, dam-making,
horse-breaking, stock-riding, from making hay to building a shed, all bushwork
came easy enough to us, Jim in particular; he took a pleasure in it, and was
never happier than when he'd had a real tearing day's work and was settling
himself after his tea to a good steady smoke. A great smoker he'd come to be.
He never was much for drinking except now and again, and then he could knock it
off as easy as any man I ever seen. Poor old Jim! He was born good and intended
to be so, like mother. Like her, his luck was dead out in being mixed up with a
lot like ours.</p>
<p>One day we were out at the back making some lambing yards. We were about
twenty miles from the head station and had about finished the job. We were
going in the next day. We had been camping in an old shepherd's hut and had
been pretty jolly all by ourselves. There was first-rate feed for our horses,
as the grass was being saved for the lambing season. Jim was in fine spirits,
and as we had plenty of good rations and first-rate tobacco we made ourselves
pretty comfortable.</p>
<p>'What a jolly thing it is to have nothing on your mind!' Jim used to say. 'I
hadn't once, and what a fine time it was! Now I'm always waking up with a start
and expecting to see a policeman or that infernal half-caste. He's never far
off when there's villainy on. Some fine day he'll sell us all, I really do
believe.'</p>
<p>'If he don't somebody else will; but why do you pitch upon him? You don't
like him somehow; I don't see that he's worse than any other. Besides, we
haven't done anything much to have a reward put on us.'</p>
<p>'No! that's to come,' answered Jim, very dismally for him. 'I don't see what
else is to come of it. Hist! isn't that a horse's step coming this way? Yes,
and a man on him, too.'</p>
<p>It was a bright night, though only the stars were out; but the weather was
that clear that you could see ever so well and hear ever so far also. Jim had a
blackfellow's hearing; his eyes were like a hawk's; he could see in about any
light, and read tracks like a printed book.</p>
<p>I could hear nothing at first; then I heard a slight noise a good way off,
and a stick breaking every now and then.</p>
<p>'Talk of the devil!' growled Jim, 'and here he comes. I believe that's
Master Warrigal, infernal scoundrel that he is. Of course he's got a message
from our respectable old dad or Starlight, asking us to put our heads in a
noose for them again.'</p>
<p>'How do you know?'</p>
<p>'I know it's that ambling horse he used to ride,' says Jim. 'I can make out
his sideling kind of way of using his legs. All amblers do that.'</p>
<p>'You're right,' I said, after listening for a minute. 'I can hear the
regular pace, different from a horse's walk.'</p>
<p>'How does he know we're here, I wonder?' says Jim.</p>
<p>'Some of the telegraphs piped us, I suppose,' I answered. 'I begin to wish
they forgot us altogether.'</p>
<p>'No such luck,' says Jim. 'Let's keep dark and see what this black snake of
a Warrigal will be up to. I don't expect he'll ride straight up to the
door.'</p>
<p>He was right. The horse hoofs stopped just inside a thick bit of scrub, just
outside the open ground on which the hut stood. After a few seconds we heard
the cry of the mopoke. It's not a cheerful sound at the dead of night, and now,
for some reason or other, it affected Jim and me in much the same manner. I
remembered the last time I had heard the bird at home, just before we started
over for Terrible Hollow, and it seemed unlucky. Perhaps we were both a little
nervous; we hadn't drunk anything but tea for weeks. We drank it awfully black
and strong, and a great lot of it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, as we heard the quick light tread of the horse pacing in his
two-feet-on-one-side way over the sandy, thin-grassed soil, every moment coming
nearer and nearer, and this queer dismal-voiced bird hooting its hoarse deep
notes out of the dark tree that swished and sighed-like in front of the
sandhill, a queer feeling came over both of us that something unlucky was on
the boards for us. We felt quite relieved when the horse's footsteps stopped.
After a minute or so we could see a dark form creeping towards the hut.</p>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Warrigal left his horse at the edge of the timber, for fear he might want
him in a hurry, I suppose. He was pretty 'fly', and never threw away a chance
as long as he was sober. He could drink a bit, like the rest of us, now and
then&mdash;not often&mdash;but when he did it made a regular devil of
him&mdash;that is, it brought the devil out that lives low down in most
people's hearts. He was a worse one than usual, Jim said. He saw him once in
one of his break-outs, and heard him boast of something he'd done. Jim never
liked him afterwards. For the matter of that he hated Jim and me too. The only
living things he cared about were Starlight and the three-cornered weed he
rode, that had been a 'brumbee', and wouldn't let any one touch him, much less
ride him, but himself. How he used to snort if a stranger came near him! He
could kick the eye out of a mosquito, and bite too, if he got the chance.</p>
<p>As for Warrigal, Starlight used to knock him down like a log if he didn't
please him, but he never offered to turn upon him. He seemed to like it, and
looked regular put out once when Starlight hurt his knuckles against his hard
skull.</p>
<p>Us he didn't like, as I said before&mdash;why, I don't know&mdash;nor we
him. Likes and dislikes are curious things. People hardly know the rights of
them. But if you take a regular strong down upon a man or woman when you first
see 'em it's ten to one that you'll find some day as you've good reason for it.
We couldn't say what grounds we had for hating the sight of Warrigal neither,
for he was as good a tracker as ever followed man or beasts. He could read all
the signs of the bush like a printed book. He could ride any horse in the
world, and find his way, day or night, to any place he'd ever once been to in
his life.</p>
<p>Sometimes we should have been hard pushed when we were making across country
at night only for him. Hour after hour he'd ride ahead through scrub or forest,
up hill or down dale, with that brute of a horse of his&mdash;he called him
'Bilbah'&mdash;ambling away, till our horses, except Rainbow, used to shake the
lives out of us jogging. I believe he did it on purpose.</p>
<p>He was a fine shot, and could catch fish and game in all sorts of ways that
came in handy when we had to keep dark. He had pluck enough, and could fight a
pretty sharp battle with his fists if he wasn't overweighted. There were white
men that didn't at all find him a good thing if they went to bully him. He
tried it on with Jim once, but he knocked the seven senses out of him inside of
three rounds, and that satisfied him. He pretended to make up, but I was always
expecting him to play us some dog's trick yet. Anyway, so far he was all right,
and as long as Starlight and us were mixed up together, he couldn't hurt one
without the other. He came gliding up to the old hut in the dull light by bits
of moves, just as if he'd been a bush that had changed its place. We pretended
to be asleep near the fire.</p>
<p>He peeped in through a chink. He could see us by the firelight, and didn't
suppose we were watching him.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Warrigal!' sung out Jim suddenly, 'what's up now? Some devil's work,
I suppose, or you wouldn't be in it. Why don't you knock at a gentleman's door
when you come a visiting?'</p>
<p>'Wasn't sure it was you,' he answered, showing his teeth; 'it don't do to
get sold. Might been troopers, for all I know.'</p>
<p>'Pity we wasn't,' said Jim; 'I'd have the hobbles on you by this time, and
you'd have got "fitted" to rights. I wish I'd gone into the police sometimes.
It isn't a bad game for a chap that can ride and track, and likes a bit of
rough-and-tumble now and then.'</p>
<p>'If I'd been a police tracker I'd have had as good a chance of nailing you,
Jim Marston,' spoke up Warrigal. 'Perhaps I will some day. Mr. Garton wanted me
bad once, and said they'd never go agin me for old times. But that says
nothin'. Starlight's out at the back and the old man, too. They want you to go
to them&mdash;sharp.'</p>
<p>'What for?'</p>
<p>'Dunno. I was to tell you, and show the camp; and now gimme some grub, for
I've had nothing since sunrise but the leg of a 'possum.'</p>
<p>'All right,' said Jim, putting the billy on; 'here's some damper and mutton
to go on with while the tea warms.'</p>
<p>'Wait till I hobble out Bilbah; he's as hungry as I am, and thirsty too, my
word.'</p>
<p>'Take some out of the barrel; we shan't want it to-morrow,' said Jim.</p>
<p>Hungry as Warrigal was&mdash;and when he began to eat I thought he never
would stop&mdash;he went and looked after his horse first, and got him a couple
of buckets of water out of the cask they used to send us out every week. There
was no surface water near the hut. Then he hobbled him out of a bit of old
sheep-yard, and came in.</p>
<p>The more I know of men the more I see what curious lumps of good and bad
they're made up of. People that won't stick at anything in some ways will be
that soft and good-feeling in others&mdash;ten times more so than your regular
good people. Any one that thinks all mankind's divided into good, bad, and
middlin', and that they can draft 'em like a lot of cattle&mdash;some to one
yard, some to another&mdash;don't know much. There's a mob in most towns
though, I think, that wants boilin' down bad. Some day they'll do it, maybe;
they'll have to when all the good country's stocked up. After Warrigal had his
supper he went out again to see his horse, and then coiled himself up before
the fire and wouldn't hardly say another word.</p>
<p>'How far was it to where Starlight was?'</p>
<p>'Long way. Took me all day to come.'</p>
<p>'Had he been there long?'</p>
<p>'Yes; had a camp there.'</p>
<p>'Anybody else with him?'</p>
<p>'Three more men from this side.'</p>
<p>'Did the old man say we were to come at once?'</p>
<p>'Yes, or leave it alone&mdash;which you liked.'</p>
<p>Then he shut his eyes, and his mouth too, and was soon as fast asleep as if
he never intended to wake under a week.</p>
<p>'What shall we do, Jim?' I said; 'go or not?'</p>
<p>'If you leave it to me,' says Jim, 'I say, don't go. It's only some other
cross cattle or horse racket. We're bound to be nobbled some day. Why not cut
it now, and stick to the square thing? We couldn't do better than we're doing
now. It's rather slow, but we'll have a good cheque by Christmas.'</p>
<p>'I'm half a mind to tell Warrigal to go back and say we're not on,' I said.
'Lots of other chaps would join without making any bones about it.'</p>
<p>'Hoo&mdash;hoo&mdash;hoo&mdash;hoo,' sounded once more the night-bird from
the black tree outside.</p>
<p>'D&mdash;&mdash; the bird! I believe he's the devil in the shape of a
mopoke! And yet I don't like Starlight to think we're afraid. He and the old
man might be in a fix and want help. Suppose we toss up?'</p>
<p>'All right,' says Jim, speaking rather slowly.</p>
<p>You couldn't tell from his face or voice how he felt about it; but I believe
now&mdash;more than that, he let on once to me&mdash;that he was awfully cut up
about my changing, and thought we were just in for a spell of straightforward
work, and would stash the other thing for good and all.</p>
<p>We put the fire together. It burnt up bright for a bit. I pulled out a
shilling.</p>
<p>'If it's head we go, Jim; if it's woman, we stay here.'</p>
<p>I sent up the coin; we both bent over near the fire to look at it.</p>
<p>The head was uppermost.</p>
<p>'Hoo&mdash;hoo&mdash;hoo&mdash;hoo,' came the night-bird's harsh croak.</p>
<p>There was a heavyish stake on that throw, if we'd only known. Only
ruin&mdash;only death. Four men's lives lost, and three women made miserable
for life.</p>
<p>Jim and I looked at one another. He smiled and opened the door.</p>
<p>'It's all the fault of that cursed owl, I believe,' he said; 'I'll have his
life if he waits till it's daylight. We must be off early and get up our
horses. I know what a long day for Warrigal and that ambling three-cornered
devil of his means&mdash;seventy or eighty miles, if it's a yard.'</p>
<p>We slept sound enough till daybreak, and <i>could sleep</i> then, whatever
was on the card. As for Jim, he slept like a baby always once he turned in.
When I woke I got up at once. It was half dark; there was a little light in the
east. But Warrigal had been out before me, and was leading his horse up to the
hut with the hobbles in his hand.</p>
<p>Our horses were not far off; one of them had a bell on. Jim had his old
brown, and I had a chestnut that I thought nearly as good. We weren't likely to
have anything to ride that wasn't middlin' fast and plucky. Them that
overhauled us would have to ride for it. We saddled up and took our blankets
and what few things we couldn't do without. The rest stopped in the hut for any
one that came after us. We left our wages, too, and never asked for 'em from
that day to this. A trifle like that didn't matter after what we were going in
for. More's the pity.</p>
<p>As we moved off my horse propped once or twice, and Warrigal looked at us in
a queer side sort of way and showed his teeth a bit&mdash;smile nor laugh it
wasn't, only a way he had when he thought he knew more than we did.</p>
<p>'My word! your horse's been where the feed's good. We're goin' a good way
to-day. I wonder if they'll be as flash as they are now.'</p>
<p>'They'll carry us wherever that three-cornered mule of yours will shuffle to
to-night,' said Jim. 'Never you mind about them. You ride straight, and don't
get up to any monkey tricks, or, by George, I'll straighten you, so as you'll
know better next time.'</p>
<p>'You know a lot, Jim Marston,' said the half-caste, looking at him with his
long dark sleepy eyes which I always thought were like a half-roused snake's.
'Never mind, you'll know more one of these days. We'd better push on.'</p>
<p>He went off at a hand-gallop, and then pulled back into a long darting kind
of canter, which Bilbah thought was quite the thing for a journey&mdash;anyhow,
he never seemed to think of stopping it&mdash;went on mile after mile as if he
was not going to pull up this side of sundown. A wiry brute, always in
condition, was this said Bilbah, and just at this time as hard as nails. Our
horses had been doing nothing lately, and being on good young feed had, of
course, got fat, and were rather soft.</p>
<p>After four or five miles they began to blow. We couldn't well pull up; the
ground was hard in places and bad for tracking. If we went on at the pace we
should cook our horses. As soon as we got into a bit of open I raced up to
him.</p>
<p>'Now, look here, Warrigal,' I said, 'you know why you're doing this, and so
do I. Our horses are not up to galloping fifty or sixty miles on end just off a
spell and with no work for months. If you don't pull up and go our pace I'll
knock you off your horse.'</p>
<p>'Oh! you're riled!' he said, looking as impudent as he dared, but slackening
all the same. 'Pulled up before if I knowed your horses were getting baked.
Thought they were up to anything, same as you and Jim.'</p>
<p>'So they are. You'll find that one of these days. If there's work ahead you
ought to have sense enough not to knock smoke out of fresh horses before we
begin.'</p>
<p>'All right. Plenty of work to do, my word. And Starlight said, "Tell 'em to
be here to-day if they can." I know he's afraid of some one follerin' up our
tracks, as it is.'</p>
<p>'That's all right, Warrigal; but you ride steady all the same, and don't be
tearing away through thick timber, like a mallee scrubber that's got into the
open and sees the devil behind him until he can get cover again. We shall be
there to-night if it's not a hundred miles, and that's time enough.'</p>
<p>We did drop in for a long day, and no mistake. We only pulled up for a short
halt in the middle, and Warrigal's cast-iron pony was off again, as if he was
bound right away for the other side of the continent. However, though we were
not going slow either, but kept up a reasonable fast pace, it must have been
past midnight when we rode into Starlight's camp; very glad Jim and I were to
see the fire&mdash;not a big one either. We had been taking it pretty easy, you
see, for a month or two, and were not quite so ready for an eighty-mile ride as
if we had been in something like training. The horses had had enough of it,
too, though neither of them would give in, not if we'd ridden 'em twenty mile
farther. As for Warrigal's Bilbah he was near as fresh as when he started, and
kept tossin' his head an' amblin' and pacin' away as if he was walkin' for a
wager round a ring in a show-yard.</p>
<p>As we rode up we could see a gunyah made out of boughs, and a longish wing
of dogleg fence, made light but well put together. As soon as we got near
enough a dog ran out and looked as if he was going to worry us; didn't bark
either, but turned round and waited for us to get off.</p>
<p>'It's old Crib,' said Jim, with a big laugh; 'blest if it ain't. Father's
somewhere handy. They're going to take up a back block and do the thing
regular: Marston, Starlight, and Company&mdash;that's the fakement. They want
us out to make dams or put up a woolshed or something. I don't see why they
shouldn't, as well as Crossman and Fakesley. It's six of one and half-a-dozen
of the other, as far as being on the square goes. Depend upon it, dad's turned
over a new leaf.'</p>
<p>'Do you fellows want anything to eat?' said a voice that I knew to be
Starlight's. 'If you do there's tea near the fire, and some grub in that flour
bag. Help yourselves and hobble out your horses. We'll settle matters a bit in
the morning. Your respected parent's abed in his own camp, and it's just as
well not to wake him, unless you want his blessing ere you sleep.'</p>
<p>We went with Starlight to his gunyah. A path led through a clump of pines,
so thick that a man might ride round it and never dream there was anything but
more pines inside. A clear place had been made in the sandhill, and a snug crib
enough rigged with saplings and a few sheets of bark. It was neat and tidy,
like everything he had to do with. 'I was at sea when I was young,' he once
said to Jim, when he was a bit 'on', 'and a man learns to be neat there.' There
was a big chimney outside, and a lot of leaves and rushes out of a swamp which
he had made Warrigal gather.</p>
<p>'Put your blankets down there, boys, and turn in. You'll see how the land
lies in the morning.' We didn't want asking twice, Jim's eyes were nigh shut as
it was. The sun was up when we woke.</p>
<p>Outside the first thing we saw was father and Starlight talking. Both of
these seemed a bit cranky. 'It's a d&mdash;&mdash; shame,' we heard Starlight
say, as he turned and walked off. 'We could have done it well enough by
ourselves.'</p>
<p>'I know what I'm about,' says father, 'it's all or none. What's the use of
crying after being in it up to our neck?'</p>
<p>'Some day you'll think different,' says Starlight, looking back at him.</p>
<p>I often remembered it afterwards.</p>
<p>'Well, lads,' says father, looking straight at us, 'I wasn't sure as you'd
come. Starlight has been barneying with me about sending for you. But we've got
a big thing on now, and I thought you'd like to be in it.'</p>
<p>'We have come,' says I, pretty short. 'Now we're here what's the play
called, and when does the curtain rise? We're on.' I was riled, vexed at
Starlight talking as if we were children, and thought I'd show as we were men,
like a young fool as I was.</p>
<p>'All right,' says father, and he sat down on a log, and began to tell us how
there was any quantity of cattle running at the back where they were
camped&mdash;a good lot strayed and mixed up, from the last dry season, and had
never been mustered for years. The stockmen hardly ever came out till the
autumn musters. One of the chaps that was in it knew all this side and had told
them. They were going to muster for a month or so, and drive the mob right
through to Adelaide. Store cattle were dear then, and we could get them off
easy there and come back by sea. No one was to know we were not regular
overlanders; and when we'd got the notes in our pockets it would be a hard
matter to trace the cattle or prove that we were the men that sold 'em.</p>
<p>'How many head do you expect to get?' says Jim.</p>
<p>'A thousand or twelve hundred; half of 'em fat, and two-thirds of them young
cattle.'</p>
<p>'By George! that's something like a haul; but you can't muster such a lot as
that without a yard.'</p>
<p>'I know that,' says father. 'We're putting up a yard on a little plain about
a mile from here. When they find it, it'll be an old nest, and the birds
flown.'</p>
<p>'Well, if that ain't the cheekiest thing I ever heard tell of,' says I
laughingly. 'To put up a yard at the back of a man's run, and muster his cattle
for him! I never heard the like before, nor any one else. But suppose the cove
or his men come across it?'</p>
<p>''Tain't no ways likely,' says father. 'They're the sleepiest lot of chaps
in this frontage I ever saw. It's hardly worth while "touching" them. There's
no fun in it. It's like shooting pheasants when they ain't preserved. There's
no risk, and when there's no risk there's no pleasure. Anyway that's my
notion.'</p>
<p>'Talking about risks, why didn't you work that Marquis of Lorne racket
better? We saw in the papers that the troopers hunted you so close you had to
kill him in the ranges.'</p>
<p>Father looked over at us and then began to laugh&mdash;not long, and he
broke off short. Laughing wasn't much in his line.</p>
<p>'Killed him, did we? And a horse worth nigh on to two thousand pounds. You
ought to have known your old father better than that. We did kill A chestnut
horse, one we picked out a purpose; white legs, white knee, short under lip,
everything quite regular. We even fed him for a week on prairie grass, just
like the Marquis had been eating. Bless you, we knew how to work all that. We
deceived Windhall his own self, and he thinks he's pretty smart. No! the
Marquis is all safe&mdash;you know where.'</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and stared at father.</p>
<p>'You've some call to crow if you can work things like that. How you ever got
him away beats me; but not more than how you managed to keep him hid with a
ring of troopers all round you from every side of the district.'</p>
<p>'We had friends,' father said. 'Me and Warrigal done all the travelling by
night. No one but him could have gone afoot, I believe, much less led a blood
horse through the beastly scrub and ranges he showed us. But the devil himself
could not beat him and that little brute Bilbah in rough country.'</p>
<p>'I believe you,' I said, thinking of our ride yesterday. 'It's quite bad
enough to follow him on level ground. But don't you think our tracks will be
easy to follow with a thousand head of cattle before us? Any fool could do
that.'</p>
<p>'It ain't that as I'm looking at,' said father; 'of course an old woman
could do it, and knit stockings all the time; but our dart is to be off and
have a month's start before anybody knows they are off the run. They won't
think of mustering before fat cattle takes a bit of a turn. That won't be for a
couple of months yet. Then they may catch us if they can.'</p>
<p>We had a long talk with Starlight, and what he said came to much the same.
One stockman they had 'squared', and he was to stand in. They had got two or
three flash chaps to help muster and drive, who were to swear they thought we
were dealers, and had bought cattle all right. One or two more were to meet us
farther on. If we could get the cattle together and clear off before anything
was suspected the rest was easy. The yard was nearly up, and Jim and I wired in
and soon finished it. It didn't want very grand work putting into it as long as
it would last our time. So we put it up roughly, but pretty strong, with pine
saplings. The drawing in was the worst, for we had to 'hump' the most of them
ourselves. Jim couldn't help bursting out laughing from time to time.</p>
<p>'It does seem such a jolly cheeky thing,' he said. 'Driving off a mob of
cattle on the quiet I've known happen once or twice; but I'm dashed if ever I
heard tell of putting up duffing improvements of a superior class on a cove's
run and clearing off with a thousand drafted cattle, all quiet and regular, and
him pottering about his home-station and never "dropping" to it no more than if
he was in Sydney.'</p>
<p>'People ought to look after their stock closer than they do,' I said. 'It is
their fault almost as much as ours. But they are too lazy to look after their
own work, and too miserable to pay a good man to do it for them. They just get
a half-and-half sort of fellow that'll take low wages and make it up with
duffing, and of course he's not likely to look very sharp after the back
country.'</p>
<p>'You're not far away,' says Jim; 'but don't you think they'd have to look
precious sharp and get up very early in the morning to be level with chaps like
father and Starlight, let alone Warrigal, who's as good by night as day? Then
there's you and me. Don't try and make us out better than we are, Dick; we're
all d&mdash;&mdash; scoundrels, that's the truth of it, and honest men haven't
a chance with us, except in the long run&mdash;except in the long run. That's
where they'll have us, Dick Marston.'</p>
<p>'That's quite a long speech for you, Jim,' I said; 'but it don't matter much
that I know of whose fault it is that we're in this duffing racket. It seems to
be our fate, as the chap says in the book. We'll have a jolly spree in Adelaide
if this journey comes out right. And now let's finish this evening off.
To-morrow they're going to yard the first mob.'</p>
<p>After that we didn't talk much except about the work. Starlight and Warrigal
were out every day and all day. The three new hands were some chaps who formed
part of a gang that did most of the horse-stealing in that neighbourhood,
though they never showed up. The way they managed it was this. They picked up
any good-looking nag or second-class racehorse that they fell across, and took
them to a certain place. There they met another lot of fellows, who took the
horses from them and cleared out to another colony; at the same time they left
the horses they had brought. So each lot travelled different ways, and were
sold in places where they were quite strange and no one was likely to claim
them.</p>
<p>After a man had had a year or two at this kind of work, he was good, or
rather bad, for anything. These young chaps, like us, had done pretty well at
these games, and one of them, falling in with Starlight, had proposed to him to
put up a couple of hundred head of cattle on Outer Back Momberah, as the run
was called; then father and he had seen that a thousand were as easy to get as
a hundred. Of course there was a risky feeling, but it wasn't such bad fun
while it lasted. We were out all day running in the cattle. The horses were in
good wind and condition now; we had plenty of rations&mdash;flour, tea, and
sugar. There was no cart, but some good packhorses, just the same as if we were
a regular station party on our own run. Father had worked all that before we
came. We had the best of fresh beef and veal too&mdash;you may be sure of
that&mdash;there was no stint in that line; and at night we were always sure of
a yarn from Starlight&mdash;that is, if he was in a good humour. Sometimes he
wasn't, and then nobody dared speak to him, not even father.</p>
<p>He was an astonishing man, certainly. Jim and I used to wonder, by the hour,
what he'd been in the old country. He'd been all over the world&mdash;in the
Islands and New Zealand; in America, and among Malays and other strange people
that we'd hardly ever heard of. Such stories as he'd tell us, too, about slaves
and wild chiefs that he'd lived with and gone out to fight with against their
enemy. 'People think a great deal of a dead man now and then in this innocent
country,' he said once when the grog was uppermost; 'why, I've seen fifty men
killed before breakfast, and in cold blood, too, chopped up alive, or next
thing to it; and a drove of slaves&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;as big
nearly as our mob, handed over to a slave-dealer, and driven off in chains just
as you'd start a lot of station cattle. They didn't like it, going off their
run either, poor devils. The women would try and run back after their
pickaninnies when they dropped, just like that heifer when Warrigal knocked her
calf on the head to-day.' What a man he was! This was something like life, Jim
and I thought. When we'd sold the cattle, if we got 'em down to Adelaide all
right, we'd take a voyage to some foreign country, perhaps, and see sights too.
What a paltry thing working for a pound a week seemed when a rise like this was
to be made!</p>
<p>Well, the long and short of it is that we mustered the cattle quite
comfortably, nobody coming anext or anigh us any more than if we'd taken the
thing by contract. You wouldn't have thought there was anybody nearer than
Bathurst. Everything seemed to be in our favour. So it was, just at the start.
We drafted out all the worst and weediest of the cattle, besides all the old
cows, and when we counted the mob out we had nearly eleven hundred first-rate
store cattle; lots of fine young bullocks and heifers, more than half
fat&mdash;altogether a prime well-bred mob that no squatter or dealer could
fault in any way if the price was right. We could afford to sell them for a
shade under market price for cash. Ready money, of course, we were bound to
have.</p>
<p>Just as we were starting there was a fine roan bull came running up with a
small mob.</p>
<p>'Cut him out, and beat him back,' says father; 'we don't want to be bothered
with the likes of him.'</p>
<p>'Why, I'm dashed if that ain't Hood's imported bull,' says Billy the Boy, a
Monaro native that we had with us. 'I know him well. How's he come to get back?
Why, the cove gave two hundred and fifty notes for him afore he left England,
I've heard 'em say.'</p>
<p>'Bring him along,' said Starlight, who came up just then. 'In for a penny,
in for a pound. They'll never think of looking for him on the Coorong, and
we'll be there before they miss any cattle worth talking about.'</p>
<p>So we took 'Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge' along with us; a red roan he was,
with a little white about the flank. He wasn't more than four year old. He'd
been brought out from England as a yearling. How he'd worked his way out to
this back part of the run, where a bull of his quality ain't often seen, nobody
could say. But he was a lively active beast, and he'd got into fine hard fettle
with living on saltbush, dry grass, and scrub for the last few months, so he
could travel as well as the others. I took particular notice of him, from his
little waxy horns to his straight locks and long square quarters. And so I'd
need to&mdash;but that came after. He had only a little bit of a private brand
on the shoulder. That was easily faked, and would come out quite different.</p>
<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<p>We didn't go straight ahead along any main track to the Lower Murray and
Adelaide exactly. That would have been a little too open and barefaced. No; we
divided the mob into three, and settled where to meet in about a fortnight.
Three men to each mob. Father and Warrigal took one lot; they had the dog, old
Crib, to help them. He was worth about two men and a boy. Starlight, Jim, and I
had another; and the three stranger chaps another. We'd had a couple of
knockabouts to help with the cooking and stockyard work. They were paid by the
job. They were to stay at the camp for a week, to burn the gunyahs, knock down
the yard, and blind the track as much as they could.</p>
<p>Some of the cattle we'd left behind they drove back and forward across the
track every day for a week. If rain came they were to drop it, and make their
way into the frontage by another road. If they heard about the job being blown
or the police set on our track, they were to wire to one of the border
townships we had to pass. Weren't we afraid of their selling us? No, not much;
they were well paid, and had often given father and Starlight information
before, though they took care never to show out in the cattle or horse-stealing
way themselves. As long as chaps in our line have money to spend, they can
always get good information and other things, too. It is when the money runs
short that the danger comes in. I don't know whether cattle-duffing was ever
done in New South Wales before on such a large scale, or whether it will ever
be done again. Perhaps not. These wire fences stop a deal of cross-work; but it
was done then, you take my word for it&mdash;a man's word as hasn't that long
to live that it's worth while to lie&mdash;and it all came out right; that is
as far as our getting safe over, selling the cattle, and having the money in
our pockets.</p>
<p>We kept on working by all sorts of outside tracks on the main line of
road&mdash;a good deal by night, too&mdash;for the first two or three hundred
miles. After we crossed the Adelaide border we followed the Darling down to the
Murray. We thought we were all right, and got bolder. Starlight had changed his
clothes, and was dressed like a swell&mdash;away on a roughish trip, but still
like a swell.</p>
<p>'They were his cattle; he had brought them from one of his stations on the
Narran. He was going to take up country in the Northern Territory. He expected
a friend out from England with a lot more capital.'</p>
<p>Jim and I used to hear him talking like this to some of the squatters whose
runs we passed through, as grave as you please. They used to ask him to stay
all night, but he always said 'he didn't like to leave his men. He made it a
practice on the road.' When we got within a fortnight's drive of Adelaide, he
rode in and lived at one of the best hotels. He gave out that he expected a lot
of cattle to arrive, and got a friend that he'd met in the billiard-room (and
couldn't he play surprisin'?) to introduce him to one of the leading stock
agents there. So he had it all cut and dry, when one day Warrigal and I rode
in, and the boy handed him a letter, touching his hat respectfully, as he had
been learned to do, before a lot of young squatters and other swells that he
was going out to a picnic with.</p>
<p>'My confounded cattle come at last,' he says. 'Excuse me for mentioning
business. I began to hope they'd never come; 'pon my soul I did. The time
passes so deuced pleasantly here. Well, they'll all be at the yards to-morrow.
You fellows had all better come and see them sold. There'll be a little lunch,
and perhaps some fizz. You go to the stock agents, Runnimall and Co.; here's
their address, Jack,' he says to me, looking me straight in the eyes. 'They'll
send a man to pilot you to the yards; and now off with you, and don't let me
see your face till to-morrow.'</p>
<p>How he carried it off! He cantered away with the rest of the party, as if he
hadn't a thought in the world except about pleasure and honest business. Nobody
couldn't have told that he wasn't just like them other young gentlemen with
only their stock and station to think about, and a little fun at the races now
and then. And what a risk he was running every minute of his life, he and all
the rest of us. I wasn't sorry to be out of the town again. There were lots of
police, too. Suppose one of them was to say, 'Richard Marston, I arrest you
for&mdash;' It hardly mattered what. I felt as if I should have tumbled down
with sheer fright and cowardliness. It's a queer thing you feel like that off
and on. Other times a man has as much pluck in him as if his life was worth
fighting for&mdash;which it isn't.</p>
<p>The agent knew all about us (or thought he did), and sent a chap to show Mr.
Carisforth's cattle (Charles Carisforth, Esq., of Sturton, Yorkshire and Banda,
Waroona, and Ebor Downs, New South Wales; that was the name he went by) the way
to the yards. We were to draft them all next morning into separate
pens&mdash;cows and bullocks, steers and heifers, and so on. He expected to
sell them all to a lot of farmers and small settlers that had taken up a new
district lately and were very short of stock.</p>
<p>'You couldn't have come into a better market, young fellow,' says the
agent's man to me. 'Our boss he's advertised 'em that well as there'll be smart
bidding between the farmers and some of the squatters. Good store cattle's been
scarce, and these is in such rattling condition. That's what'll sell 'em. Your
master seems a regular free-handed sort of chap. He's the jolliest squatter
there's been in town these years, I hear folk say. Puts 'em in mind of Hawdon
and Evelyn Sturt in the old overlander days.'</p>
<p>Next day we were at the yards early, you bet. We wanted to have time to
draft them into pens of twenty to fifty each, so that the farmers and small
settlers might have a chance to buy. Besides, it was the last day of our work.
Driving all day and watching half the night is pretty stiffish work, good
weather and bad, when you've got to keep it up for months at a time, and we'd
been three months and a week on the road.</p>
<p>The other chaps were wild for a spree. Jim and I had made up our minds to be
careful; still, we had a lot to see in a big town like Adelaide; for we'd never
been to Sydney even in our lives, and we'd never seen the sea. That was
something to look at for the first time, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Well, we got the cattle drafted to rights, every sort and size and age by
itself, as near as could be. That's the way to draft stock, whether they're
cattle, sheep, or horses; then every man can buy what he likes best, and isn't
obliged to lump up one sort with another. We had time to have a bit of dinner.
None of us had touched a mouthful since before daylight. Then we began to see
the buyers come.</p>
<p>There'd been a big tent rigged, as big as a small woolshed, too. It came out
in a cart, and then another cart came with a couple of waiters, and they laid
out a long table of boards on trestles with a real first-class feed on it, such
as we'd never seen in our lives before. Fowls and turkeys and tongues and
rounds of beef, beer and wine in bottles with gilt labels on. Such a set-out it
was. Father began to growl a bit. 'If he's going to feed the whole country this
way, he'll spend half the stuff before we get it, let alone drawing a down on
the whole thing.' But Jim and me could see how Starlight had been working the
thing to rights while he was swelling it in the town among the big bugs. We
told him the cattle would fetch that much more money on account of the lunch
and the blowing the auctioneer was able to do. These would pay for the feed and
the rest of the fal-lals ten times over. 'When he gets in with men like his old
pals he loses his head, I believe,' father says, 'and fancies he's what he used
to be. He'll get "fitted" quite simple some day if he doesn't keep a better
look-out.'</p>
<p>That might be, but it wasn't to come about this time. Starlight came riding
out by and by, dressed up like a real gentleman, and lookin' so different that
Jim and I hardly dared speak to him&mdash;on a splendid horse too (not Rainbow,
he'd been left behind; he was always left within a hundred miles of The Hollow,
and he could do it in one day if he was wanted to), and a lot of fine dressed
chaps with him&mdash;young squatters and officers, and what not. I shouldn't
have been surprised if he'd had the Governor out with him. They told us
afterwards he did dine at Government House reg'lar, and was made quite free and
welcome there.</p>
<p>Well, he jumps down and shakes hands with us before them all. 'Well, Jack!
Well, Bill!' and so on, calls us his good faithful fellows, and how well we'd
brought the cattle over; nods to father, who didn't seem able to take it all
in; says he'll back us against any stockmen in Australia; has up Warrigal and
shows him off to the company. 'Most intelligent lad.' Warrigal grinned and
showed his white teeth. It was as good as a play.</p>
<p>Then everybody goes to lunch&mdash;swells and selectors, Germans and
Paddies, natives and immigrants, a good many of them, too, and there was eating
and drinking and speechifying till all was blue. By and by the auctioneer looks
at his watch. He'd had a pretty good tuck-in himself, and they must get to
business.</p>
<p>Father opened his eyes at the price the first pen brought, all prime young
bullocks, half fat most of them. Then they all went off like wildfire; the big
men and the little men bidding, quite jealous, sometimes one getting the lot,
sometimes another. One chap made a remark about there being such a lot of
different brands; but Starlight said they'd come from a sort of depot station
of his, and were the odds and ends of all the mobs of store cattle that he'd
purchased the last four years. That satisfied 'em, particularly as he said it
in a careless, fierce way which he could put on, as if it was like a man's
&mdash;&mdash; impudence to ask him anything. It made the people laugh; I could
see that.</p>
<p>By and by we comes to the imported bull. He was in a pen by himself, looking
first-rate. His brand had been faked, and the hair had grown pretty well. It
would have took a sharp hand to know him again.</p>
<p>'Well, gentlemen,' says the auctioneer, 'here is the imported bull "Duke of
Brunswick". It ain't often an animal of his quality comes in with a mob of
store cattle; but I am informed by Mr. Carisforth that he left orders for the
whole of the cattle to be cleared off the run, and this valuable animal was
brought away in mistake. He was to return by sea; but as he happens to be here
to-day, why, sooner than disappoint any intending buyer, Mr. Carisforth has
given me instructions to put him up, and if he realises anything near his value
he will be sold.'</p>
<p>'Yes!' drawls Starlight, as if a dozen imported bulls, more or less, made no
odds to him, 'put him up, by all means, Mr. Runnimall. Expectin' rather large
shipment of Bates's "Duchess" tribe next month. Rather prefer them on the
whole. The "Duke" here is full of Booth blood, so he may just as well go with
the others. I shall never get what he cost, though; I know that. He's been a
most expensive animal to me.'</p>
<p>Many a true word spoken in jest. He had good call to know him, as well as
the rest of us, for a most expensive animal, before all was said and done. What
he cost us all round it would be hard indeed to cipher up.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there was a great laugh at Starlight's easy way of taking it. First
one and then another of the squatters that was going in for breeding began to
bid, thinking he'd go cheap, until they got warm, and the bull went up to a
price that we never dreamed he'd fetch. Everything seemed to turn out lucky
that day. One would have thought they'd never seen an imported bull before. The
young squatters got running one another, as I said before, and he went up to
&pound;270! Then the auctioneer squared off the accounts as sharp as he could;
an' it took him all his time, what with the German and the small farmers, who
took their time about it, paying in greasy notes and silver and copper, out of
canvas bags, and the squatters, who were too busy chaffing and talking among
themselves to pay at all. It was dark before everything was settled up, and all
the lots of cattle delivered. Starlight told the auctioneer he'd see him at his
office, in a deuced high and mighty kind of way, and rode off with his new
friend.</p>
<p>All of us went back to our camp. Our work was over, but we had to settle up
among ourselves and divide shares. I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw
the cattle all sold and gone, and nothing left at the camp but the horses and
the swags.</p>
<p>When we got there that night it was late enough. After tea father and I and
Jim had a long yarn, settling over what we should do and wondering whether we
were going to get clean away with our share of the money after all.</p>
<p>'By George!' says Jim, 'it's a big touch, and no mistake. To think of our
getting over all right, and selling out so easy, just as if they was our own
cattle. Won't there be a jolly row when it's all out, and the Momberah people
miss their cattle?' (more than half 'em was theirs). 'And when they muster they
can't be off seein' they're some hundreds short.'</p>
<p>'That's what's botherin' me,' says father. 'I wish Starlight hadn't been so
thundering flash with it all. It'll draw more notice on us, and every one 'll
be gassin' about this big sale, and all that, till people's set on to ask where
the cattle come from, and what not.'</p>
<p>'I don't see as it makes any difference,' I said. 'Somebody was bound to buy
'em, and we'd have had to give the brands and receipts just the same. Only if
we'd sold to any one that thought there was a cross look about it, we'd have
had to take half money, that's all. They've fetched a rattling price, through
Starlight's working the oracle with those swells, and no mistake.'</p>
<p>'Yes, but that ain't all of it,' says the old man, filling his pipe. 'We've
got to look at what comes after. I never liked that imported bull being took.
They'll rake all the colonies to get hold of him again, partic'ler as he sold
for near three hundred pound.'</p>
<p>'We must take our share of the risk along with the money,' said Jim. 'We
shall have our whack of that according to what they fetched to-day. It'll be a
short life and a merry one, though, dad, if we go on big licks like this.
What'll we tackle next&mdash;a bank or Government House?'</p>
<p>'Nothing at all for a good spell, if you've any sense,' growled father.
'It'll give us all we know to keep dark when this thing gets into the papers,
and the police in three colonies are all in full cry like a pack of beagles.
The thing is, what'll be our best dart now?'</p>
<p>'I'll go back overland,' says he. 'Starlight's going to take Warrigal with
him, and they'll be off to the islands for a turn. If he knows what's best for
him, he'll never come back. These other chaps say they'll separate and sell
their horses when they get over to the Murray low down, and work their way up
by degrees. Which way are you boys going?'</p>
<p>'Jim and I to Melbourne by next steamer,' I said. 'May as well see a bit of
life now we're in it. We'll come back overland when we're tired of strange
faces.'</p>
<p>'All right,' says father, 'they won't know where I'm lyin' by for a bit,
I'll go bail, and the sooner you clear out of Adelaide the better. News like
ours don't take long to travel, and you might be nabbed very simple. One of ye
write a line to your mother and tell her where you're off to, or she'll be
frettin' herself and the gal too&mdash;frettin' over what can't be helped. But
I suppose it's the natur' o' some women.'</p>
<p>We done our settling-up next day. All the sale money was paid over to
Starlight. He cashed the cheques and drew the lot in notes and gold&mdash;such
a bundle of 'em there was. He brought them out to us at the camp, and then we
'whacked' the lot. There were eight of us that had to share and share alike.
How much do you think we had to divide? Why, not a penny under four thousand
pounds. It had to be divided among the eight of us. That came to five hundred a
man. A lot of money to carry about, that was the worst of it.</p>
<p>Next day there was a regular split and squander. We didn't wait long after
daylight, you bet. Father was off and well on his way before the stars were out
of the sky. He took Warrigal's horse, Bilbah, back with him; he and Starlight
was going off to the islands together, and couldn't take horses with them. But
he was real sorry to part with the cross-grained varmint; I thought he was
going to blubber when he saw father leading him off. Bilbah wouldn't go neither
at first; pulled back, and snorted and went on as if he'd never seen only one
man afore in his life. Father got vexed at last and makes a sign to old Crib;
he fetches him such a 'heeler' as gave him something else to think of for a few
miles. He didn't hang back much after that.</p>
<p>The three other chaps went their own road. They kept very dark all through.
I know their names well enough, but there's no use in bringing them up now.</p>
<p>Jim and I cuts off into the town, thinking we was due for a little fun. We'd
never been in a big town before, and it was something new to us. Adelaide ain't
as grand quite as Melbourne or Sydney, but there's something quiet and homelike
about it to my thinking&mdash;great wide streets, planted with trees; lots of
steady-going German farmers, with their vineyards and orchards and droll little
waggons. The women work as hard as the men, harder perhaps, and get brown and
scorched up in no time&mdash;not that they've got much good looks to lose;
leastways none we ever saw.</p>
<p>We could always tell the German farmers' places along the road from one of
our people by looking outside the door. If it was an Englishman or an
Australian, you'd see where they'd throwed out the teapot leavings; if it was a
German, you wouldn't see nothing. They drink their own sour wine, if their
vines are old enough to make any, or else hop beer; but they won't lay out
their money in the tea chest or sugar bag; no fear, or the grog either, and not
far wrong. Then the sea! I can see poor old Jim's face now the day we went down
to the port and he seen it for the first time.</p>
<p>'So we've got to the big waterhole at last,' he said. 'Don't it make a man
feel queer and small to think of its going away right from here where we stand
to the other side of the world? It's a long way across.'</p>
<p>'Jim,' says I, 'and to think we've lived all our lives up to this time and
never set eyes on it before. Don't it seem as if one was shut up in the bush,
or tied to a gum tree, so as one can never have a chance to see anything? I
wonder we stayed in it so long.'</p>
<p>'It's not a bad place, though it is rather slow and wired in sometimes,'
says Jim. 'We might be sorry we ever left it yet. When does the steamer go to
Melbourne?'</p>
<p>'The day after to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'I'll be glad to be clear off; won't you?'</p>
<p>We went to the theatre that night, and amused ourselves pretty well next day
and till the time came for our boat to start for Melbourne. We had altered
ourselves a bit, had our hair cut and our beards trimmed by the hairdresser. We
bought fresh clothes, and what with this, and the feeling of being in a new
place and having more money in our pockets than we'd ever dreamed about before,
we looked so transmogrified when we saw ourselves in the glass that we hardly
knew ourselves. We had to change our names, too, for the first time in our
lives; and it went harder against the grain than you'd think, for all we were a
couple of cattle-duffers, with a warrant apiece sure to be after us before the
year was out.</p>
<p>'It sounds ugly,' says Jim, after we had given our names as John Simmons and
Henry Smith at the hotel where we put up at till the steamer was ready to
start. 'I never thought that Jim Marston was to come to this&mdash;to be afraid
to tell a fat, greasy-looking fellow like that innkeeper what his real name
was. Seems such a pitiful mean lie, don't it, Dick?'</p>
<p>'It isn't so bad as being called No. 14, No. 221, as they sing out for the
fellows in Berrima Gaol. How would you like that, Jim?'</p>
<p>'I'd blow my brains out first,' cried out Jim, 'or let some other fellow do
it for me. It wouldn't matter which.'</p>
<p>It was very pleasant, those two or three days in Adelaide, if they'd only
lasted. We used to stroll about the lighted streets till all hours, watching
the people and the shops and everything that makes a large city different from
the country. The different sorts of people, the carts and carriages, buggies
and drays, pony-carriages and spring-carts, all jumbled up together; even the
fruit and flowers and oysters and fish under the gas-lights seemed strange and
wonderful to us. We felt as if we would have given all the world to have got
mother and Aileen down to see it all. Then Jim gave a groan.</p>
<p>'Only to think,' says he, 'that we might have had all this fun some day, and
bought and paid for it honest. Now it isn't paid for. It's out of some other
man's pocket. There's a curse on it; it will have to be paid in blood or prison
time before all's done. I could shoot myself for being such a cursed fool.'</p>
<p>'Too late to think of that,' I said; 'we'll have some fun in Melbourne for a
bit, anyhow. For what comes after we must "chance it", as we've done before,
more than once or twice, either.'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>Next day our steamer was to sail. We got Starlight to come down with us and
show us how to take our passage. We'd never done it before, and felt awkward at
it. He'd made up his mind to go to New Zealand, and after that to Honolulu,
perhaps to America.</p>
<p>'I'm not sure that I'll ever come back, boys,' he said, 'and if I were you I
don't think I would either. If you get over to San Francisco you'd find the
Pacific Slope a very pleasant country to live in. The people and the place
would suit you all to pieces. At any rate I'd stay away for a few years and
wait till all this blows over.'</p>
<p>I wasn't sorry when the steamer cleared the port, and got out of sight of
land. There we were&mdash;where we'd never been before&mdash;in blue water.
There was a stiff breeze, and in half-an-hour we shouldn't have turned our
heads if we'd seen Hood and the rest of 'em come riding after us on seahorses,
with warrants as big as the mainsail. Jim made sure he was going to die
straight off, and the pair of us wished we'd never seen Outer Back Momberah,
nor Hood's cattle, nor Starlight, nor Warrigal. We almost made up our minds to
keep straight and square to the last day of our lives. However, the wind died
down a bit next day, and we both felt a lot better&mdash;better in body and
worse in mind&mdash;as often happens. Before we got to Melbourne we could eat
and drink, smoke and gamble, and were quite ourselves again. We'd laid it out
to have a reg'lar good month of it in town, takin' it easy, and stopping nice
and quiet at a good hotel, havin' some reasonable pleasure. Why shouldn't we
see a little life? We'd got the cash, and we'd earned that pretty hard. It's
the hardest earned money of all, that's got on the cross, if fellows only knew,
but they never do till it's too late.</p>
<p>When we got tired of doing nothing, and being in a strange place, we'd get
across the border, above Albury somewhere, and work on the mountain runs till
shearing came round again; and we could earn a fairish bit of money. Then we'd
go home for Christmas after it was all over, and see mother and Aileen again.
How glad and frightened they'd be to see us. It wouldn't be safe altogether,
but go we would.</p>
<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<p>We got to Melbourne all right, and though it's a different sort of a place
from Sydney, it's a jolly enough town for a couple of young chaps with money in
their pockets. Most towns are, for the matter of that. We took it easy, and
didn't go on the spree or do anything foolish. No, we weren't altogether so
green as that. We looked out for a quiet place to lodge, near the sea&mdash;St.
Kilda they call it, in front of the beach&mdash;and we went about and saw all
the sights, and for a time managed to keep down the thought that perhaps sooner
or later we'd be caught, and have to stand our trial for this last affair of
ours, and maybe one or two others. It wasn't a nice thing to think of; and now
and then it used to make both of us take an extra drop of grog by way of
driving the thoughts of it out of our heads. That's the worst of not being
straight and square. A man's almost driven to drink when he can't keep from
thinking of all sorts of miserable things day and night. We used to go to the
horse-yards now and then, and the cattle-yards too. It was like old times to
see the fat cattle and sheep penned up at Flemington, and the butchers riding
out on their spicy nags or driving trotters. But their cattle-yards was twice
as good as ours, and me and Jim used often to wonder why the Sydney people
hadn't managed to have something like them all these years, instead of the
miserable cockatoo things at Homebush that we'd often heard the drovers and
squatters grumble about.</p>
<p>However, one day, as we was sitting on the rails, talking away quite
comfortable, we heard one butcher say to another, 'My word, this is a smart bit
of cattle-duffing&mdash;a thousand head too!' 'What's that?' says the other
man. 'Why, haven't you heard of it?' says the first one, and he pulls a paper
out of his pocket, with this in big letters: 'Great Cattle Robbery.&mdash;A
thousand head of Mr. Hood's cattle were driven off and sold in Adelaide.
Warrants are out for the suspected parties, who are supposed to have left the
colony.' Here was a bit of news! We felt as if we could hardly help falling off
the rails; but we didn't show it, of course, and sat there for half-an-hour,
talking to the buyers and sellers and cracking jokes like the others. But we
got away home as soon as we could, and then we began to settle what we should
do.</p>
<p>Warrants were out, of course, for Starlight, and us too. He was known, and
so were we. Our descriptions were sure to be ready to send out all over the
country. Warrigal they mightn't have noticed. It was common enough to have a
black boy or a half-caste with a lot of travelling cattle. Father had not shown
up much. He had an old pea-jacket on, and they mightn't have dropped down to
him or the three other chaps that were in it with us; they were just like any
other road hands. But about there being warrants out, with descriptions, in all
the colonies, for a man to be identified, but generally known as Starlight, and
for Richard and James Marston, we were as certain as that we were in St. Kilda,
in a nice quiet little inn, overlooking the beach; and what a murder it was to
have to leave it at all.</p>
<p>Leave the place we had to do at once. It wouldn't do to be strollin' about
Melbourne with the chance of every policeman we met taking a look at us to see
if we tallied with a full description they had at the office: 'Richard and
James Marston are twenty-five and twenty-two, respectively; both tall and
strongly built; having the appearance of bushmen. Richard Marston has a scar on
left temple. James Marston has lost a front tooth,' and so on. When we came to
think of it, they couldn't be off knowing us, if they took it into their heads
to bail us up any day. They had our height and make. We couldn't help looking
like bushmen&mdash;like men that had been in the open air all their lives, and
that had a look as if saddle and bridle rein were more in our way than the
spade and plough-handle. We couldn't wash the tan off our skins; faces, necks,
arms, all showed pretty well that we'd come from where the sun was hot, and
that we'd had our share of it. They had my scar, got in a row, and Jim's front
tooth, knocked out by a fall from a horse when he was a boy; there was nothing
for it but to cut and run.</p>
<p>'It was time for us to go, my boys,' as the song the Yankee sailor sung us
one night runs, and then, which way to go? Every ship was watched that close a
strange rat couldn't get a passage, and, besides, we had that feeling we didn't
like to clear away altogether out of the old country; there was mother and
Aileen still in it, and every man, woman, and child that we'd known ever since
we were born. A chap feels that, even if he ain't much good other ways. We
couldn't stand the thought of clearin' out for America, as Starlight advised
us. It was like death to us, so we thought we'd chance it somewhere in
Australia for a bit longer.</p>
<p>Now where we put up a good many drovers from Gippsland used to stay, as they
brought in cattle from there. The cattle had to be brought over Swanston Street
Bridge and right through the town after twelve o'clock at night. We'd once or
twice, when we'd been out late, stopped to look at them, and watched the big
heavy bullocks and fat cows staring and starting and slipping all among the
lamps and pavements, with the street all so strange and quiet, and laughed at
the notion of some of the shopkeepers waking up and seeing a couple of hundred
wild cattle, with three or four men behind 'em, shouldering and horning one
another, then rushing past their doors at a hard trot, or breaking into a
gallop for a bit.</p>
<p>Some of these chaps, seeing we was cattle-men and knew most things in that
line, used to open out about where they'd come from, and what a grand place
Gippsland was&mdash;splendid grass country, rivers that run all the year round,
great fattening country; and snowy mountains at the back, keeping everything
cool in the summer. Some of the mountain country, like Omeo, that they talked a
lot of, seemed about one of the most out-of-the-way places in the world. More
than that, you could get back to old New South Wales by way of the Snowy River,
and then on to Monaro. After that we knew where we were.</p>
<p>Going away was easy enough, in a manner of speaking; but we'd been a month
in Melbourne, and when you mind that we were not bad-looking chaps, fairishly
dressed, and with our pockets full of money, it was only what might be looked
for if we had made another friend or two besides Mrs. Morrison, the landlady of
our inn, and Gippsland drovers. When we had time to turn round a bit in
Melbourne of course we began to make a few friends. Wherever a man goes, unless
he keeps himself that close that he won't talk to any one or let any one talk
to him, he's sure to find some one he likes to be with better than another. If
he's old and done with most of his fancies, except smokin' and drinkin' it's a
man. If he's young and got his life before him it's a woman. So Jim and I
hadn't been a week in Melbourne before we fell across a couple of&mdash;well,
friends&mdash;that we were hard set to leave. It was a way of mine to walk down
to the beach every evening and have a look at the boats in the bay and the
fishermen, if there were any&mdash;anything that might be going on. Sometimes a
big steamer would be coming in, churning the water under her paddles and
tearing up the bay like a hundred bunyips. The first screw-boat Jim and I saw
we couldn't make out for the life of us what she moved by. We thought all
steamers had paddles. Then the sailing boats, flying before the breeze like
seagulls, and the waves, if it was a rough day, rolling and beating and
thundering on the beach. I generally stayed till the stars came out before I
went back to the hotel. Everything was so strange and new to a man who'd seen
so little else except green trees that I was never tired of watching, and
wondering, and thinking what a little bit of a shabby world chaps like us lived
in that never seen anything but a slab hut, maybe, all the year round, and a
bush public on high days and holidays.</p>
<p>Sometimes I used to feel as if we hadn't done such a bad stroke in cutting
loose from all this. But then the horrible feeling would come back of never
being safe, even for a day, of being dragged off and put in the dock, and maybe
shut up for years and years. Sometimes I used to throw myself down upon the
sand and curse the day when I ever did anything that I had any call to be
ashamed of and put myself in the power of everything bad and evil in all my
life through.</p>
<p>Well, one day I was strolling along, thinking about these things, and
wondering whether there was any other country where a man could go and feel
himself safe from being hounded down for the rest of his life, when I saw a
woman walking on the beach ahead of me. I came up with her before long, and as
I passed her she turned her head and I saw she was one of two girls that we had
seen in the landlady's parlour one afternoon. The landlady was a good, decent
Scotch woman, and had taken a fancy to both of us (particularly to Jim&mdash;as
usual). She thought&mdash;she was that simple&mdash;that we were up-country
squatters from some far-back place, or overseers. Something in the sheep or
cattle line everybody could see that we were. There was no hiding that. But we
didn't talk about ourselves overmuch, for very good reasons. The less people
say the more others will wonder and guess about you. So we began to be looked
upon as bosses of some sort, and to be treated with a lot of respect that we
hadn't been used to much before. So we began to talk a bit&mdash;natural
enough&mdash;this girl and I. She was a good-looking girl, with a wonderful
fresh clear skin, full of life and spirits, and pretty well taught. She and her
sister had not been a long time in the country; their father was dead, and they
had to live by keeping a very small shop and by dressmaking. They were some
kind of cousins of the landlady and the same name, so they used to come and see
her of evenings and Sundays. Her name was Kate Morrison and her sister's was
Jeanie. This and a lot more she told me before we got back to the hotel, where
she said she was going to stay that night and keep Mrs. Morrison company.</p>
<p>After this we began to be a deal better acquainted. It all came easy enough.
The landlady thought she was doing the girls a good turn by putting them in the
way of a couple of hard-working well-to-do fellows like us; and as Jim and the
younger one, Jeanie, seemed to take a fancy to each other, Mrs. Morrison used
to make up boating parties, and we soon got to know each other well enough to
be joked about falling in love and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>After a bit we got quite into the way of calling for Kate and Jeanie after
their day's work was done, and taking them out for a walk. I don't know that I
cared so much for Kate in those days anyhow, but by degrees we got to think
that we were what people call in love with each other. It went deeper with her
than me, I think. It mostly does with women. I never really cared for any woman
in the world except Gracey Storefield, but she was far away, and I didn't see
much likelihood of my being able to live in that part of the world, much less
to settle down and marry there. So, though we'd broken a six-pence together and
I had my half, I looked upon her as ever so much beyond me and out of my reach,
and didn't see any harm in amusing myself with any woman that I might happen to
fall across.</p>
<p>So, partly from idleness, partly from liking, and partly seeing that the
girl had made up her mind to throw in her lot with me for good and all, I just
took it as it came; but it meant a deal more than that, if I could have
foreseen the end.</p>
<p>I hadn't seen a great many women, and had made up my mind that, except a few
bad ones, they was mostly of one sort&mdash;good to lead, not hard to drive,
and, above all, easy to see through and understand.</p>
<p>I often wonder what there was about this Kate Morrison to make her so
different from other women; but she was born unlike them, I expect. Anyway, I
never met another woman like her. She wasn't out-and-out handsome, but there
was something very taking about her. Her figure was pretty near as good as a
woman's could be; her step was light and active; her feet and hands were small,
and she took a pride in showing them. I never thought she had any temper
different from other women; but if I'd noticed her eyes, surely I'd have seen
it there. There was something very strange and out of the way about them. They
hardly seemed so bright when you looked at them first; but by degrees, if she
got roused and set up about anything, they'd begin to burn with a steady sort
of glitter that got fiercer and brighter till you'd think they'd burn
everything they looked at. The light in them didn't go out again in a hurry,
either. It seemed as if those wonderful eyes would keep on shining, whether
their owner wished it or not.</p>
<p>I didn't find out all about her nature at once&mdash;trust a woman for that.
Vain and fond of pleasure I could see she was; and from having been always
poor, in a worrying, miserable, ill-contented way, she had got to be hungry for
money and jewels and fine clothes; just like a person that's been starved and
shivering with cold longs for a fire and a full meal and a warm bed. Some
people like these things when they can get them; but others never seem to think
about anything else, and would sell their souls or do anything in the whole
world to get what their hearts are set on. When men are like this they're
dangerous, but they hardly hurt anybody, only themselves. When women are born
with hearts of this sort it's a bad look-out for everybody they come near. Kate
Morrison could see that I had money. She thought I was rich, and she made up
her mind to attract me, and go shares in my property, whatever it might be. She
won over her younger sister, Jeanie, to her plans, and our acquaintance was
part of a regular put-up scheme. Jeanie was a soft, good-tempered, good-hearted
girl, with beautiful fair hair, blue eyes, and the prettiest mouth in the
world. She was as good as she was pretty, and would have worked away without
grumbling in that dismal little shop from that day to this, if she'd been let
alone. She was only just turned seventeen. She soon got to like Jim a deal too
well for her own good, and used to listen to his talk about the country across
the border, and such simple yarns as he could tell her, poor old Jim! until she
said she'd go and live with him under a salt-bush if he'd come back and marry
her after Christmas. And of course he did promise. He didn't see any harm in
that. He intended to come back if he could, and so did I for that matter. Well,
the long and short of it was that we were both regularly engaged and had made
all kinds of plans to be married at Christmas and go over to Tasmania or New
Zealand, when this terrible blow fell upon us like a shell. I did see one
explode at a review in Melbourne&mdash;and, my word! what a scatteration it
made.</p>
<p>Well, we had to let Kate and Jeanie know the best way we could that our
business required us to leave Melbourne at once, and that we shouldn't be back
till after Christmas, if then.</p>
<p>It was terrible hard work to make out any kind of a story that would do.
Kate questioned and cross-questioned me about the particular kind of business
that called us away like a lawyer (I've seen plenty of that since) until at
last I was obliged to get a bit cross and refuse to answer any more
questions.</p>
<p>Jeanie took it easier, and was that down-hearted and miserable at parting
with Jim that she hadn't the heart to ask any questions of any one, and Jim
looked about as dismal as she did. They sat with their hands in each other's
till it was nearly twelve o'clock, when the old mother came and carried the
girls off to bed. We had to start at daylight next morning; but we made up our
minds to leave them a hundred pounds apiece to keep for us until we came back,
and promised if we were alive to be at St. Kilda next January, which they had
to be contented with.</p>
<p>Jeanie did not want to take the money; but Jim said he'd very likely lose
it, and so persuaded her.</p>
<p>We were miserable and low-spirited enough ourselves at the idea of going
away all in a hurry. We had come to like Melbourne, and had bit by bit cheated
ourselves into thinking that we might live comfortably and settle down in
Victoria, out of reach of our enemies, and perhaps live and die
unsuspected.</p>
<p>From this dream we were roused up by the confounded advertisement.
Detectives and constables would be seen to be pretty thick in all the colonies,
and we could not reasonably expect not to be taken some time or other, most
likely before another week.</p>
<p>We thought it over and over again, in every way. The more we thought over it
the more dangerous it seemed to stop in Melbourne. There was only one thing for
it, that was to go straight out of the country. The Gippsland men were the only
bushmen we knew at all well, and perhaps that door might shut soon.</p>
<p>So we paid our bill. They thought us a pair of quiet, respectable chaps at
that hotel, and never would believe otherwise. People may say what they like,
but it's a great thing to have some friends that can say of you&mdash;</p>
<p>'Well, I never knew no harm of him; a better tempered chap couldn't be; and
all the time we knowed him he was that particular about his bills and money
matters that a banker couldn't have been more regular. He may have had his
faults, but we never seen 'em. I believe a deal that was said of him wasn't
true, and nothing won't ever make me believe it.'</p>
<p>These kind of people will stand up for you all the days of your life, and
stick to you till the very last moment, no matter what you turn out to be.
Well, there's something pleasant in it; and it makes you think human nature
ain't quite such a low and paltry thing as some people tries to make out.
Anyhow, when we went away our good little landlady and her sister was that
sorry to lose us, as you'd have thought they was our blood relations. As for
Jim, every one in the house was fit to cry when he went off, from the dogs and
cats upwards. Jim never was in no house where everybody didn't seem to take
naturally to him. Poor old Jim!</p>
<p>We bought a couple of horses, and rode away down to Sale with these chaps
that had sold their cattle in Melbourne and was going home. It rained all the
way, and it was the worst road by chalks we'd ever seen in our lives; but the
soil was wonderful, and the grass was something to talk about; we'd hardly ever
seen anything like it. A few thousand acres there would keep more stock than
half the country we'd been used to.</p>
<p>We didn't stay more than a day or so in Sale. Every morning at breakfast
some one was sure to turn up the paper and begin jabbering about the same old
infernal business, Hood's cattle, and what a lot were taken, and whether
they'll catch Starlight and the other men, and so on.</p>
<p>We heard of a job at Omeo while we were in Sale, which we thought would just
about suit us. All the cattle on a run there were to be mustered and delivered
to a firm of stock agents that had bought them; they wanted people to do it by
contract at so much a head. Anybody who took it must have money enough to buy
stock horses. The price per head was pretty fair, what would pay well, and we
made up our minds to go in for it.</p>
<p>So we made a bargain; bought two more horses each, and started away for
Omeo. It was near 200 miles from where we were. We got up there all right, and
found a great rich country with a big lake, I don't know how many feet above
the sea. The cattle were as wild as hares, but the country was pretty good to
ride over. We were able to keep our horses in good condition in the paddocks,
and when we had mustered the whole lot we found we had a handsome cheque to
get.</p>
<p>It was a little bit strange buckling to after the easy life we'd led for the
last few months; but after a day or two we found ourselves as good men as ever,
and could spin over the limestone boulders and through the thick mountain
timber as well as ever we did. A man soon gets right again in the fresh air of
the bush; and as it used to snow there every now and then the air was pretty
fresh, you bet, particularly in the mornings and evenings.</p>
<p>After we'd settled up we made up our minds to get as far as Monaro, and wait
there for a month or two. After that we might go in for the shearing till
Christmas, and then whatever happened we would both make a strike back for
home, and have one happy week, at any rate, with mother and Aileen.</p>
<p>We tried as well as we could to keep away from the large towns and the
regular mail coach road. We worked on runs where the snow came down every now
and then in such a way as to make us think that we might be snowed up alive
some fine morning. It was very slow and tedious work, but the newspapers seldom
came there, and we were not worried day after day with telegrams about our
Adelaide stroke, and descriptions of Starlight's own look and way of speaking.
We got into the old way of working hard all day and sleeping well at night. We
could eat and drink well; the corned beef and the damper were good, and Jim,
like when we were at the back of Boree when Warrigal came, wished that we could
stick to this kind of thing always, and never have any fret or crooked dealings
again as long as we lived.</p>
<p>But it couldn't be done. We had to leave and go shearing when the spring
came on. We did go, and went from one big station to the other when the spring
was regularly on and shearers were scarce. By and by the weather gets warmer,
and we had cut our last shed before the first week in December.</p>
<p>Then we couldn't stand it any longer.</p>
<p>'I don't care,' says Jim, 'if there's a policeman standing at every corner
of the street, I must make a start for home. They may catch us, but our chance
is a pretty good one; and I'd just as soon be lagged outright as have to hide
and keep dark and moulder away life in some of these God-forsaken spots.'</p>
<p>So we made up to start for home and chance it. We worked our way by degrees
up the Snowy River, by Buchan and Galantapee, and gradually made towards
Balooka and Buckley's Crossing. On the way we crossed some of the roughest
country we had ever seen or ridden over.</p>
<p>'My word, Dick,' said Jim one day, as we were walking along and leading our
horses, 'we could find a place here if we were hard pushed near as good for
hiding in as the Hollow. Look at that bit of tableland that runs up towards
Black Mountain, any man that could find a track up to it might live there for a
year and all the police of the country be after him.'</p>
<p>'What would he get to eat if he was there?'</p>
<p>'That long chap we stayed with at Wargulmerang told us that there were wild
cattle on all those tablelands. Often they get snowed up in winter and die,
making a circle in the snow. Then fish in all the creeks, besides the old
Snowy, and there are places on the south side of him that people didn't see
once in five years. I believe I shall make a camp for myself on the way, and
live in it till they've forgot all about these cursed cattle. Rot their hides,
I wish we'd never have set eyes on one of them.'</p>
<p>'So do I; but like many things in the world it's too late&mdash;too late,
Jim!'</p>
<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<p>One blazing hot day in the Christmas week Jim and I rode up the 'gap' that
led from the Southern road towards Rocky Creek and the little flat near the
water where our hut stood. The horses were tired, for we'd ridden a long way,
and not very slow either, to get to the old place. How small and queer the old
homestead looked, and everything about it after all we had seen. The trees in
the garden were in full leaf, and we could see that it was not let go to waste.
Mother was sitting in the verandah sewing, pretty near the same as we went
away, and a girl was walking slowly up from the creek carrying a bucket of
water. It was Aileen. We knew her at once. She was always as straight as a
rush, and held her head high, as she used to do; but she walked very slow, and
looked as if she was dull and weary of everything. All of a sudden Jim jumped
off, dropped his horse's bridle on the ground, and started to run towards her.
She didn't see him till he was pretty close; then she looked up
astonished-like, and put her bucket down. She gave a sudden cry and rushed over
to him; the next minute she was in his arms, sobbing as if her heart would
break.</p>
<p>I came along quiet. I knew she'd be glad to see me&mdash;but, bless you, she
and mother cared more for Jim's little finger than for my whole body. Some
people have a way of gettin' the biggest share of nearly everybody's liking
that comes next or anigh 'em. I don't know how it's done, or what works it. But
so it is; and Jim could always count on every man, woman, and child, wherever
he lived, wearing his colours and backing him right out, through thick and
thin.</p>
<p>When I came up Aileen was saying&mdash;</p>
<p>'Oh, Jim, my dear old Jim! now I'll die happy; mother and I were only
talking of you to-day, and wondering whether we should see you at
Christmas&mdash;and now you have come. Oh, Dick! and you too. But we shall be
frightened every time we hear a horse's tread or dog's bark.'</p>
<p>'Well, we're here now, Aileen, and that's something. I had a great notion of
clearing out for San Francisco and turning Yankee. What would you have done
then?'</p>
<p>We walked up to the house, leading our horses, Jim and Aileen hand in hand.
Mother looked up and gave a scream; she nearly fell down; when we got in her
face was as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>'Mother of Mercy! I vowed to you for this,' she said; 'sure she hears our
prayers. I wanted to see ye both before I died, and I didn't think you'd come.
I was afraid ye'd be dreadin' the police, and maybe stay away for good and all.
The Lord be thanked for all His mercies!'</p>
<p>We went in and enjoyed our tea. We had had nothing to eat that day since
breakfast; but better than all was Aileen's pleasant, clever tongue, though she
said it was getting stiff for want of exercise. She wanted to know all about
our travels, and was never tired of listening to Jim's stories of the wonders
we had seen in the great cities and the strange places we had been to.</p>
<p>'Oh! how happy you must have been!' she would say, 'while we have been
pining and wearying here, all through last spring and summer, and then winter
again&mdash;cold and miserable it was last year; and now Christmas has come
again. Don't go away again for a good while, or mother and I'll die straight
out.'</p>
<p>Well, what could we say? Tell her we'd never go away at all if we could help
it&mdash;only she must be a good girl and make the best of things, for mother's
sake? When had she seen father last?</p>
<p>'Oh! he was away a good while once; that time you and Jim were at Mr.
Falkland's back country. You must have had a long job then; no wonder you've
got such good clothes and look so smartened up like. He comes every now and
then, just like he used. We never know what's become of him.'</p>
<p>'When was he here last?'</p>
<p>'Oh! about a month ago. He said he might be here about Christmas; but he
wasn't sure. And so you saved Miss Falkland from being killed off her horse,
Jim? Tell me all about it, like a good boy, and what sort of a looking young
lady is she?'</p>
<p>'All right,' said Jim. 'I'll unload the story bag before we get through;
there's a lot in there yet; but I want to look at you and hear you talk just
now. How's George Storefield?'</p>
<p>'Oh! he's just the same good, kind, steady-going fellow he always was,' says
she. 'I don't know what we should do without him when you're away. He comes and
helps with the cows now and then. Two of the horses got into Bargo pound, and
he went and released them for us. Then a storm blew off best part of the roof
of the barn, and the bit of wheat would have been spoiled only for him. He's
the best friend we have.'</p>
<p>'You'd better make sure of him for good and all,' I said. 'I suppose he's
pretty well-to-do now with that new farm he bought the other day.'</p>
<p>'Oh! you saw that,' she said. 'Yes; he bought out the Cumberers. They never
did any good with Honeysuckle Flat, though the land was so good. He's going to
lay it all down in lucerne, he says.'</p>
<p>'And then he'll smarten up the cottage, and sister Aileen 'll go over, and
live in it,' says Jim; 'and a better thing she couldn't do.'</p>
<p>'I don't know,' she said. 'Poor George, I wish I was fonder of him. There
never was a better man, I believe; but I cannot leave mother yet, so it's no
use talking.' Then she got up and went in.</p>
<p>'That's the way of the world,' says Jim. 'George worships the ground she
treads on, and she can't make herself care two straws about him. Perhaps she
will in time. She'll have the best home and the best chap in the whole district
if she does.'</p>
<p>'There's a deal of "if" in this world,' I said; 'and "if" we're "copped" on
account of that last job, I'd like to think she and mother had some one to look
after them, good weather and bad.'</p>
<p>'We might have done that, and not killed ourselves with work either,' said
Jim, rather sulkily for him; and he lit his pipe and walked off into the bush
without saying another word.</p>
<p>I thought, too, how we might have been ten times, twenty times, as happy if
we'd only kept on steady ding-dong work, like George Storefield, having
patience and seeing ourselves get better off&mdash;even a little&mdash;year by
year. What had he come to? And what lay before us? And though we were that fond
of poor mother and Aileen that we would have done anything in the world for
them&mdash;that is, we would have given our lives for them any day&mdash;yet we
had left them&mdash;father, Jim, and I&mdash;to lead this miserable, lonesome
life, looked down upon by a lot of people not half good enough to tie their
shoes, and obliged to a neighbour for help in every little distress.</p>
<p>Jim and I thought we'd chance a few days at home, no matter what risk we
ran; but still we knew that if warrants were out the old home would be well
watched, and that it was the first place the police would come to. So we made
up our minds not to sleep at home, but to go away every night to an old
deserted shepherd's hut, a couple of miles up the gully, that we used to play
in when we were boys. It had been strongly built at first; time was not much
matter then, and there were no wages to speak of, so that it was a good
shelter. The weather was that hot, too, it was just as pleasant sleeping under
a tree as anywhere else. So we didn't show at home more than one at a time, and
took care to be ready for a bolt at any time, day or night, when the police
might show themselves. Our place was middling clear all round now, and it was
hard for any one on horseback to get near it without warning; and if we could
once reach the gully we knew we could run faster than any man could ride.</p>
<p>One night, latish, just as we were walking off to our hut there was a
scratching at the door; when we opened it there was old Crib! He ran up to both
of us and smelt round our legs for a minute to satisfy himself; then jumped up
once to each of us as if he thought he ought to do the civil thing, wagged his
stump of a tail, and laid himself down. He was tired, and had come a long way.
We could see that, and that he was footsore too. We knew that father wasn't so
very far off, and would soon be in. If there'd been anybody strange there Crib
would have run back fast enough; then father'd have dropped there was something
up and not shown. No fear of the dog not knowing who was right and who wasn't.
He could tell every sort of a man a mile off, I believe. He knew the very walk
of the police troopers' horses, and would growl, father said, if he heard their
hoofs rattle on the stones of the road.</p>
<p>About a quarter of an hour after father walks in, quiet as usual. Nothing
never made no difference to him, except he thought it was worth while. He was
middlin' glad to see us, and behaved kind enough to mother, so the poor soul
looked quite happy for her. It was little enough of that she had for her share.
By and by father walks outside with us, and we had a long private talk.</p>
<p>It was a brightish kind of starlight night. As we walked down to the creek I
thought how often Jim and I had come out on just such a night 'possum hunting,
and came home so tired that we were hardly able to pull our boots off. Then we
had nothing to think about when we woke in the morning but to get in the cows;
and didn't we enjoy the fresh butter and the damper and bacon and eggs at
breakfast time! It seems to me the older people get the more miserable they get
in this world. If they don't make misery for themselves other people do it for
'em; or just when everything's going straight, and they're doing their duty
first-rate and all that, some accident happens 'em just as if they was the
worst people in the world. I can't make it out at all.</p>
<p>'Well, boys,' says dad, 'you've been lucky so far; suppose you had a pretty
good spree in Melbourne? You seen the game was up by the papers, didn't you?
But why didn't you stay where you were?'</p>
<p>'Why, of course, that brought us away,' says Jim; 'we didn't want to be
fetched back in irons, and thought there was more show for it in the bush
here.'</p>
<p>'But even if they'd grabbed Starlight,' says the old man, 'you'd no call to
be afeard. Not much chance of his peaching, if it had been a hanging
matter.'</p>
<p>'You don't mean to say there ain't warrants against us and the rest of the
lot?' I said.</p>
<p>'There's never a warrant out agin any one but Starlight,' said the old man.
'I've had the papers read to me regular, and I rode over to Bargo and saw the
reward of &pound;200 (a chap alongside of me read it) as is offered for a man
generally known as Starlight, supposed to have left the country; but not a word
about you two and me, or the boy, or them other coves.'</p>
<p>'So we might as well have stayed where we were, Jim.' Jim gave a kind of
groan. 'Still, when you look at it, isn't it queer,' I went on, 'that they
should only spot Starlight and leave us out? It looks as if they was keepin'
dark for fear of frightening us out of the country, but watching all the
same.'</p>
<p>'It's this way I worked it,' says father, rubbing his tobacco in his hands
the old way, and bringing out his pipe: 'they couldn't be off marking down
Starlight along of his carryin' on so. Of course he drawed notice to himself
all roads. But the rest of us only come in with the mob, and soon as they was
sold stashed the camp and cleared out different ways. Them three fellers is in
Queensland long ago, and nobody was to know them from any other road hands. I
was back with the old mare and Bilbah in mighty short time. I rode 'em night
and day, turn about, and they can both travel. You kept pretty quiet, as luck
had it, and was off to Melbourne quick. I don't really believe they dropped to
any of us, bar Starlight; and if they don't nab him we might get shut of it
altogether. I've known worse things as never turned up in this world, and never
will now.' Here the old man showed his teeth as if he were going to laugh, but
thought better of it.</p>
<p>'Anyhow, we'd made it up to come home at Christmas,' says Jim; 'but it's all
one. It would have saved us a deal of trouble in our minds all the same if we'd
known there was no warrants out after us two. I wonder if they'll nail
Starlight.'</p>
<p>'They can't be well off it,' says father. 'He's gone off his head, and
stopped in some swell town in New Zealand&mdash;Canterbury, I think it's
called&mdash;livin' tiptop among a lot of young English swells, instead of
makin' off for the Islands, as he laid out to do.'</p>
<p>'How do you know he's there?' I said.</p>
<p>'I know, and that's enough,' snarls father. 'I hear a lot in many ways about
things and people that no one guesses on, and I know this&mdash;that he's
pretty well marked down by old Stillbrook the detective as went down there a
month ago.'</p>
<p>'But didn't you warn him?'</p>
<p>'Yes, of course, as soon as I heard tell; but it's too late, I'm thinking.
He has the devil's luck as well as his own, but I always used to tell him it
would fail him yet.'</p>
<p>'I believe you're the smartest man of the crowd, dad,' says Jim, laying his
hand on father's shoulder. He could pretty nigh get round the old chap once in
a way, could Jim, surly as he was. 'What do you think we'd better do? What's
our best dart?'</p>
<p>Father shook off his hand, but not roughly, and his voice wasn't so hard
when he said&mdash;</p>
<p>'Why, stop at home quiet, of course, and sleep in your beds at night. Don't
go planting in the gully, or some one 'll think you're wanted, and let on to
the police. Ride about the country till I give you the office. Never fear but
I'll have word quick enough. Go about and see the neighbours round just as
usual.'</p>
<p>Jim and I was quite stunned by this bit of news; no doubt we was pretty
sorry as ever we left Melbourne, but there was nothing for it now but to follow
it out. After all, we were at home, and it was pleasant to think we wouldn't be
hunted for a bit and might ride about the old place and enjoy ourselves a bit.
Aileen was as happy as the day was long, and poor mother used to lay her head
on Jim's neck and cry for joy to have him with her. Even father used to sit in
the front, under the quinces, and smoke his pipe, with old Crib at his feet,
most as if he thought he was happy. I wonder if he ever looked back to the days
when he was a farmin' boy and hadn't took to poaching? He must have been a
smart, handy kind of lad, and what a different look his face must have had
then!</p>
<p>We had our own horses in pretty good trim, so we foraged up Aileen's mare,
and made it up to ride over to George Storefield's, and gave him a look-up.
He'd been away when we came, and now we heard he was home.</p>
<p>'George has been doing well all this time, of course,' I said. 'I expect
he'll turn squatter some day and be made a magistrate.'</p>
<p>'Like enough,' says Jim. 'More than one we could pick began lower down than
him, and sits on the Bench and gives coves like us a turn when we're brought up
before 'em. Fancy old George sayin', "Is anything known, constable, of this
prisoner's anterseedents?" as I heard old Higgler say one day at Bargo.'</p>
<p>'Why do you make fun of these things, Jim, dear?' says Aileen, looking so
solemn and mournful like. 'Oughtn't a steady worker to rise in life, and isn't
it sad to see cleverer men and better workers&mdash;if they liked&mdash;kept
down by their own fault?'</p>
<p>'Why wasn't your roan mare born black or chestnut?' says Jim, laughing, and
pretending to touch her up. 'Come along, and let's see if she can trot as well
as she used to do?'</p>
<p>'Poor Lowan,' says she, patting the mare's smooth neck (she was a wonderful
neat, well-bred, dark roan, with black points&mdash;one of dad's, perhaps, that
he'd brought her home one time he was in special good humour about something.
Where she was bred or how, nobody ever knew); 'she was born pretty and good.
How little trouble her life gives her. It's a pity we can't all say as much, or
have as little on our minds.'</p>
<p>'Whose fault's that?' says Jim. 'The dingo must live as well as the collie
or the sheep either. One's been made just the same as the other. I've often
watched a dingo turn round twice, and then pitch himself down in the long grass
like as if he was dead. He's not a bad sort, old dingo, and has a good time of
it as long as it lasts.'</p>
<p>'Yes, till he's trapped or shot or poisoned some day, which he always is,'
said Aileen bitterly. 'I wonder any man should be content with a wicked life
and a shameful death.' And she struck Lowan with a switch, and spun down the
slope of the hill between the trees like a forester-doe with the hunter-hound
behind her.</p>
<p>When we came up with her she was all right again, and tried to smile.
Whatever put her out for the time she always worked things by kindness, and
would lead us straight if she could. Driven, she knew we couldn't be; and I
believe she did us about ten times as much good that way as if she had scolded
and raged, or even sneered at us.</p>
<p>When we rode up to Mr. Storefield's farm we were quite agreeable and
pleasant again, Jim makin' believe his horse could walk fastest, and saying
that her mare's pace was only a double shuffle of an amble like Bilbah's, and
she declaring that the mare's was a true walk&mdash;and so it was. The mare
could do pretty well everything but talk, and all her paces were
first-class.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Storefield was pottering about in the garden with a big sun-bonnet
on. She was a great woman for flowers.</p>
<p>'Come along in, Aileen, my dear,' she said. 'Gracey's in the dairy; she'll
be out directly. George only came home yesterday. Who be these you've got with
ye? Why, Dick!' she says, lookin' again with her sharp, old, gray eyes, 'it's
you, boy, is it? Well, you've changed a deal too; and Jim too. Is he as full of
mischief as ever? Well, God bless you, boys, I wish you well! I wish you well.
Come in out of the sun, Aileen; and one of you take the horses up to the
stable. You'll find George there somewhere.'</p>
<p>Aileen had jumped down by this time, and had thrown her rein to Jim, so we
rode up to the stable, and a very good one it was, not long put up, that we
could see. How the place had changed, and how different it was from ours! We
remembered the time when their hut wasn't a patch on ours, when old Isaac
Storefield, that had been gardener at Mulgoa to some of the big gentlemen in
the old days, had saved a bit of money and taken up a farm; but bit by bit
their place had been getting better and bigger every year, while ours had stood
still and now was going back.</p>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<p>George Storefield's place, for the old man was dead and all the place
belonged to him and Gracey, quite stunned Jim and me. We'd been away more than
a year, and he'd pulled down the old fences and put up new
ones&mdash;first-rate work it was too; he was always a dead hand at splitting.
Then there was a big hay-shed, chock-full of good sweet hay and wheat sheaves,
and, last of all, the new stable, with six stalls and a loft above, and racks,
all built of ironbark slabs, as solid and reg'lar as a church, Jim said.</p>
<p>They'd a good six-roomed cottage and a new garden fence ever so long. There
were more fruit trees in the garden and a lot of good draught horses standing
about, that looked well, but as if they'd come off a journey.</p>
<p>The stable door opens, and out comes old George as hearty as ever, but
looking full of business.</p>
<p>'Glad to see you, boys,' he says; 'what a time you've been away! Been away
myself these three months with a lot of teams carrying. I've taken greatly to
the business lately. I'm just settling up with my drivers, but put the horses
in, there's chaff and corn in the mangers, and I'll be down in a few minutes.
It's well on to dinner-time, I see.'</p>
<p>We took the bridles off and tied up the horses&mdash;there was any amount of
feed for them&mdash;and strolled down to the cottage again.</p>
<p>'Wonder whether Gracey's as nice as she used to be,' says Jim. 'Next to
Aileen I used to think she wasn't to be beat. When I was a little chap I
believed you and she must be married for certain. And old George and Aileen. I
never laid out any one for myself, I remember.'</p>
<p>'The first two don't look like coming off,' I said. 'You're the likeliest
man to marry and settle if Jeanie sticks to you.'</p>
<p>'She'd better go down to the pier and drown herself comfortably,' said Jim.
'If she knew what was before us all, perhaps she would. Poor little Jeanie!
We'd no right to drag other people into our troubles. I believe we're getting
worse and worse. The sooner we're shot or locked up the better.'</p>
<p>'You won't think so when it comes, old man,' I said. 'Don't bother your
head&mdash;it ain't the best part of you&mdash;about things that can't be
helped. We're not the only horses that can't be kept on the course&mdash;with a
good turn of speed too.'</p>
<p>'"They want shooting like the dingoes," as Aileen said. They're never no
good, except to ruin those that back 'em and disgrace their owners and the
stable they come out of. That's our sort, all to pieces. Well, we'd better come
in. Gracey 'll think we're afraid to face her.'</p>
<p>When we went away last Grace Storefield was a little over seventeen, so now
she was nineteen all out, and a fine girl she'd grown. Though I never used to
think her a beauty, now I almost began to think she must be. She wasn't tall,
and Aileen looked slight alongside of her; but she was wonderful fair and fresh
coloured for an Australian girl, with a lot of soft brown hair and a pair of
clear blue eyes that always looked kindly and honestly into everybody's face.
Every look of her seemed to wish to do you good and make you think that nothing
that wasn't square and right and honest and true could live in the same place
with her.</p>
<p>She held out both hands to me and said&mdash;</p>
<p>'Well, Dick, so you're back again. You must have been to the end of the
world, and Jim, too. I'm very glad to see you both.'</p>
<p>She looked into my face with that pleased look that put me in mind of her
when she was a little child and used to come toddling up to me, staring and
smiling all over her face the moment she saw me. Now she was a grown woman, and
a sweet-looking one too. I couldn't lift her up and kiss her as I used to do,
but I felt as if I should like to do it all the same. She was the only creature
in the whole world, I think, that liked me better than Jim. I'd been trying to
drive all thoughts of her out of my heart, seeing the tangle I'd got into in
more ways than one; but now the old feeling which had been a part of me ever
since I'd grown up came rushing back stronger than ever. I was surprised at
myself, and looked queer I daresay.</p>
<p>Then Aileen laughed, and Jim comes to the rescue and says&mdash;</p>
<p>'Dick doesn't remember you, Gracey. You've grown such a swell, too. You
can't be the little girl we used to carry on our backs.'</p>
<p>'Dick remembers very well,' she says, and her very voice was ever so much
fuller and softer, 'don't you, Dick?' and she looked into my face as innocent
as a child. 'I don't think he could pull me out of the water and carry me up to
the cottage now.'</p>
<p>'You tumble in and we'll try,' says Jim; 'first man to keep you for
good&mdash;eh, Gracey? It's fine hot weather, and Aileen shall see fair
play.'</p>
<p>'You're just as saucy as ever, Jim,' says she, blushing and smiling. 'I see
George coming, so I must go and fetch in dinner. Aileen's going to help me
instead of mother. You must tell us all about your travels when we sit
down.'</p>
<p>When George came in he began to talk to make up for lost time, and told us
where he had been&mdash;a long way out in some new back country, just taken up
with sheep. He had got a first-rate paying price for his carriage out, and had
brought back and delivered a full load of wool.</p>
<p>'I intend to do it every year for a bit,' he said. 'I can breed and feed a
good stamp of draught horse here. I pay drivers for three waggons and drive the
fourth myself. It pays first-rate so far, and we had very fair feed all the way
there and back.'</p>
<p>'Suppose you get a dry season,' I said, 'how will that be?'</p>
<p>'We shall have to carry forage, of course; but then carriage will be higher,
and it will come to the same thing. I don't like being so long away from home;
but it pays first-rate, and I think I see a way to its paying better
still.'</p>
<p>'So you've ridden over to show them the way, Aileen,' he said, as the girls
came in; 'very good of you it was. I was afraid you'd forgotten the way.'</p>
<p>'I never forget the way to a friend's place, George,' she said, 'and you've
been our best friend while these naughty boys have left mother and me so long
by ourselves. But you've been away yourself.'</p>
<p>'Only four months,' he said; 'and after a few more trips I shan't want to go
away any more.'</p>
<p>'That will be a good day for all of us,' she said. 'You know, Gracey, we
can't do without George, can we? I felt quite deserted, I can tell you.'</p>
<p>'He wouldn't have gone away at all if you'd held up your little finger, you
know that, you hard-hearted girl,' said Grace, trying to frown. 'It's all your
fault.'</p>
<p>'Oh! I couldn't interfere with Mr. Storefield's business,' said Aileen,
looking very grave. 'What kind of a country was it you were out in?'</p>
<p>'Not a bad place for sheep and cattle and blacks,' said poor George, looking
rather glum; 'and not a bad country to make money or do anything but live in,
but that hot and dry and full of flies and mosquitoes that I'd sooner live on a
pound a week down here than take a good station as a present there. That is, if
I was contented,' he went on to say, with a sort of a groan.</p>
<p>There never was a greater mistake in the world, I believe, than for a man to
let a woman know how much he cares for her. It's right enough if she's made up
her mind to take him, no odds what happens. But if there's any half-and-half
feeling in her mind about him, and she's uncertain and doubtful whether she
likes him well enough, all this down-on-your-knees business works against you,
more than your worst enemy could do. I didn't know so much about it then. I've
found it out since, worse luck. And I really believe if George had had the
savey to crack himself up a little, and say he'd met a nice girl or two in the
back country and hid his hand, Aileen would have made it up with him that very
Christmas, and been a happy woman all her life.</p>
<p>When old Mrs. Storefield came in she put us through our facings pretty
brisk&mdash;where we'd been, what we'd done? What took us to
Melbourne,&mdash;how we liked it? What kind of people they were? and so on. We
had to tell her a good lot, part of it truth, of course, but pretty mixed. It
made rather a good yarn, and I could see Grace was listening with her heart as
well as her ears. Jim said generally we met some very nice people in Melbourne
named Jackson, and they were very kind to us.</p>
<p>'Were there any daughters in the family, Jim?' asked Grace.</p>
<p>'Oh! yes, three.'</p>
<p>'Were they good-looking?'</p>
<p>'No, rather homely, particularly the youngest.'</p>
<p>'What did they do?'</p>
<p>'Oh! their mother kept a boarding-house. We stayed there.'</p>
<p>I don't think I ever knew Jim do so much lying before; but after he'd begun
he had to stick to it. He told me afterwards he nearly broke down about the
three daughters; but was rather proud of making the youngest the ugliest.</p>
<p>'I can see Gracey's as fond of you as ever she was, Dick,' says he; 'that's
why she made me tell all those crammers. It's an awful pity we can't all square
it, and get spliced this Christmas. Aileen would take George if she wasn't a
fool, as most women are. I'd like to bring Jeanie up here, and join George in
the carrying business. It's going to be a big thing, I can see. You might marry
Gracey, and look after both places while we were away.'</p>
<p>'And how about Kate?'</p>
<p>'The devil take her! and then he'd have a bargain. I wish you'd never
dropped across her, and that she wasn't Jeanie's sister,' blurts out Jim.
'She'll bring bad luck among us before she's done, I feel, as sure as we're
standing here.'</p>
<p>'It's all a toss up&mdash;like our lives; married or lagged, bushwork or
roadwork (in irons), free or bond. We can't tell how it will be with us this
day year.'</p>
<p>'I've half a mind to shoot myself,' says Jim, 'and end it all. I would, too,
only for mother and Aileen. What's the use of life that isn't life, but fear
and misery, from one day's end to another, and we only just grown up? It's
d&mdash;&mdash;d hard that a chap's brains don't grow along with his legs and
arms.'</p>
<p>We didn't ride home till quite the evening. Grace would have us stay for
tea; it was a pretty hot day, so there was no use riding in the sun. George
saddled his horse, and he and Grace rode part of the way home with us. He'd got
regular sunburnt like us, and, as he could ride a bit, like most natives, he
looked better outside of a horse than on his own legs, being rather thick-set
and shortish; but his heart was in the right place, like his sister's, and his
head was screwed on right, too. I think more of old George now than I ever did
before, and wish I'd had the sense to value his independent straight-ahead
nature, and the track it led him, as he deserved.</p>
<p>Jim and I rode in front, with Gracey between us. She had on a neat habit and
a better hat and gloves than Aileen, but nothing could ever give her the seat
and hand and light, easy, graceful way with her in the saddle that our girl
had. All the same she could ride and drive too, and as we rode side by side in
the twilight, talking about the places I'd been to, and she wanting to know
everything (Jim drew off a bit when the road got narrow), I felt what a fool
I'd been to let things slide, and would have given my right hand to have been
able to put them as they were three short years before.</p>
<p>At last we got to the Gap; it was the shortest halt from their home. George
shook hands with Aileen, and turned back.</p>
<p>'We'll come and see you next&mdash;' he said.</p>
<p>'Christmas Eve!' said Aileen.</p>
<p>'Christmas Eve let it be,' says George.</p>
<p>'All right,' I said, holding Grace's hand for a bit. And so we
parted&mdash;for how long, do you think?</p>
<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<p>When we got home it was pretty late, and the air was beginning to cool after
the hot day. There was a low moon, and everything showed out clear, so that you
could see the smallest branches of the trees on Nulla Mountain, where it stood
like a dark cloud-bank against the western sky. There wasn't the smallest
breeze. The air was that still and quiet you could have heard anything stir in
the grass, or almost a 'possum digging his claws into the smooth bark of the
white gum trees. The curlews set up a cry from time to time; but they didn't
sound so queer and shrill as they mostly do at night. I don't know how it was,
but everything seemed quiet and pleasant and homelike, as if a chap might live
a hundred years, if it was all like this, and keep growing better and happier
every day. I remember all this so particular because it was the only time I'd
felt like it for years, and I never had the same feeling afterwards&mdash;nor
likely to.</p>
<p>'Oh! what a happy day I've had,' Aileen said, on a sudden. Jim and I and her
had been riding a long spell without speaking. 'I don't know when I've enjoyed
myself so much; I've got quite out of the way of being happy lately, and hardly
know the taste of it. How lovely it would be if you and Jim could always stay
at home like this, and we could do our work happy and comfortable together,
without separating, and all this deadly fear of something terrible happening,
that's never out of my mind. Oh! Dick, won't you promise me to stop quiet and
work steady at home, if you&mdash;if you and Jim haven't anything brought
against you?'</p>
<p>She bent forward and looked into my face as she said this. I could see her
eyes shine, and every word she said seemed to come straight from her heart. How
sad and pitiful she looked, and we felt for a moment just as we did when we
were boys, and she used to come and persuade us to go on with our work and not
grieve mother, and run the risk of a licking from father when he came home.</p>
<p>Her mare, Lowan, was close alongside of my horse, stepping along at her fast
tearing walk, throwing up her head and snorting every now and then, but Aileen
sat in her saddle better than some people can sit in a chair; she held the rein
and whip together and kept her hand on mine till I spoke.</p>
<p>'We'll do all we can, Aileen dear, for you and poor mother, won't we, Jim?'
I felt soft and down-hearted then, if ever I did. 'But it's too late&mdash;too
late! You'll see us now and then; but we can't stop at home quiet, nor work
about here all the time as we used to do. That day's gone. Jim knows it as well
as me. There's no help for it now. We'll have to do like the rest&mdash;enjoy
ourselves a bit while we can, and stand up to our fight when the trouble
comes.'</p>
<p>She took her hand away, and rode on with her rein loose and her head down. I
could see the tears falling down her face, but after a bit she put herself to
rights, and we rode quietly up to the door. Mother was working away in her
chair, and father walking up and down before the door smoking.</p>
<p>When we were letting go the horses, father comes up and says&mdash;</p>
<p>'I've got a bit of news for you, boys; Starlight's been took, and the darkie
with him.'</p>
<p>'Where?' I said. Somehow I felt struck all of a heap by hearing this. I'd
got out of the way of thinking they'd drop on him. As for Jim, he heard it
straight enough, but he went on whistling and patting the mare's neck, teasing
her like, because she was so uneasy to get her head-stall off and run after the
others.</p>
<p>'Why, in New Zealand, to be sure. The blamed fool stuck there all this time,
just because he found himself comfortably situated among people as he liked. I
wonder how he'll fancy Berrima after it all? Sarves him well right.'</p>
<p>'But how did you come to hear about it?' We knew father couldn't read nor
write.</p>
<p>'I have a chap as is paid to read the papers reg'lar, and to put me on when
there's anything in 'em as I want to know. He's bin over here to-day and give
me the office. Here's the paper he left.'</p>
<p>Father pulls out a crumpled-up dirty-lookin' bit of newspaper. It wasn't
much to look at; but there was enough to keep us in readin', and thinkin', too,
for a good while, as soon as we made it out. In pretty big letters, too.</p>
<blockquote>IMPORTANT CAPTURE BY DETECTIVE STILLBROOK, OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES
POLICE.</blockquote>
<p>That was atop of the page, then comes this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Our readers may remember the description given in this journal,
some months since, of a cattle robbery on the largest scale, when upwards of a
thousand head were stolen from one of Mr. Hood's stations, driven to Adelaide,
and then sold, by a party of men whose names have not as yet transpired. It is
satisfactory to find that the leader of the gang, who is well known to the
police by the assumed name of 'Starlight', with a half-caste lad recognised as
an accomplice, has been arrested by this active officer. It appears that, from
information received, Detective Stillbrook went to New Zealand, and, after
several months' patient search, took his passage in the boat which left that
colony, in order to meet the mail steamer, outward bound, for San Francisco. As
the passengers were landing he arrested a gentlemanlike and well-dressed
personage, who, with his servant, was about to proceed to Menzies's Hotel.
Considerable surprise was manifested by the other passengers, with whom the
prisoner had become universally popular. He indignantly denied all knowledge of
the charge; but we have reason to believe that there will be no difficulty as
to identification. A large sum of money in gold and notes was found upon him.
Other arrests are likely to follow.</blockquote>
<p>This looked bad; for a bit we didn't know what to think. While Jim and I was
makin' it all out, with the help of a bit of candle we smuggled out&mdash;we
dursn't take it inside&mdash;father was smokin' his pipe&mdash;in the old
fashion&mdash;and saying nothing. When we'd done he put up his pipe in his
pouch and begins to talk.</p>
<p>'It's come just as I said, and knowed it would, through Starlight's cussed
flashness and carryin's on in fine company. If he'd cleared out and made for
the Islands as I warned him to do, and he settled to, or as good, afore he left
us that day at the camp, he'd been safe in some o' them 'Merikin places he was
always gassin' about, and all this wouldn't 'a happened.'</p>
<p>'He couldn't help that,' says Jim; 'he thought they'd never know him from
any other swell in Canterbury or wherever he was. He's been took in like many
another man. What I look at is this: he won't squeak. How are they to find out
that we had any hand in it?'</p>
<p>'That's what I'm dubersome about,' says father, lightin' his pipe again.
'Nobody down there got much of a look at me, and I let my beard grow on the
road and shaved clean soon's I got back, same as I always do. Now the thing is,
does any one know that you boys was in the fakement?'</p>
<p>'Nobody's likely to know but him and Warrigal. The knockabouts and those
other three chaps won't come it on us for their own sakes. We may as well stop
here till Christmas is over and then make down to the Barwon, or somewhere
thereabouts. We could take a long job at droving till the derry's off a
bit.'</p>
<p>'If you'll be said by me,' the old man growls out, 'you'll make tracks for
the Hollow afore daylight and keep dark till we hear how the play goes. I know
Starlight's as close as a spring-lock; but that chap Warrigal don't cotton to
either of you, and he's likely to give you away if he's pinched
himself&mdash;that's my notion of him.'</p>
<p>'Starlight 'll keep him from doing that,' Jim says; 'the boy 'll do nothing
his master don't agree to, and he'd break his neck if he found him out in any
dog's trick like that.'</p>
<p>'Starlight and he ain't in the same cell, you take your oath. I don't trust
no man except him. I'll be off now, and if you'll take a fool's advice, though
he is your father, you'll go too; we can be there by daylight.'</p>
<p>Jim and I looked at each other.</p>
<p>'We promised to stay Chris'mas with mother and Aileen,' says he, 'and if all
the devils in hell tried to stop us, I wouldn't break my word. But we'll come
to the Hollow on Boxing Day, won't we, Dick?'</p>
<p>'All right! It's only two or three days. The day after to-morrow's Chris'mas
Eve. We'll chance that, as it's gone so far.'</p>
<p>'Take your own way,' growls father. 'Fetch me my saddle. The old mare's
close by the yard.'</p>
<p>Jim fetches the saddle and bridle, and Crib comes after him, out of the
verandah, where he had been lying. Bless you! he knew something was up. Just
like a Christian he was, and nothing never happened that dad was in as he
wasn't down to.</p>
<p>'May as well stop till morning, dad,' says Jim, as we walked up to the
yard.</p>
<p>'Not another minute,' says the old man, and he whips the bridle out of Jim's
hand and walks over to the old mare. She lifts up her head from the dry grass
and stands as steady as a rock.</p>
<p>'Good-bye,' he says, and he shook hands with both of us; 'if I don't see you
again I'll send you word if I hear anything fresh.'</p>
<p>In another minute we heard the old mare's hoofs proceeding away among the
rocks up the gully, and gradually getting fainter in the distance.</p>
<p>Then we went in. Mother and Aileen had been in bed an hour ago, and all the
better for them. Next morning we told mother and Aileen that father had gone.
They didn't say much. They were used to his ways. They never expected him till
they saw him, and had got out of the fashion of asking why he did this or that.
He had reasons of his own, which he never told them, for going or coming, and
they'd left off troubling their heads about it. Mother was always in dread
while he was there, and they were far easier in their minds when he was away
off the place.</p>
<p>As for us, we had made up our minds to enjoy ourselves while we could, and
we had come to his way of thinking, that most likely nothing was known of our
being in the cattle affair that Starlight and the boy had been arrested for. We
knew nothing would drag it out of Starlight about his pals in this or any other
job. Now they'd got him, it would content them for a bit, and maybe take off
their attention from us and the others that were in it.</p>
<p>There were two days to Christmas. Next day George and his sister would be
over, and we all looked forward to that for a good reminder of old times. We
were going to have a merry Christmas at home for once in a way. After that we
would clear out and get away to some of the far out stations, where chaps like
ourselves always made to when they wanted to keep dark. We might have the luck
of other men that we had known of, and never be traced till the whole thing had
died out and been half-forgotten. Though we didn't say much to each other we
had pretty well made up our minds to go straight from this out. We might take
up a bit of back country, and put stock on it with some of the money we had
left. Lots of men had begun that way that had things against them as bad as us,
and had kept steady, and worked through in course of time. Why shouldn't we as
well as others? We wanted to see what the papers said of us, so we rode over to
a little post town we knew of and got a copy of the 'Evening Times'. There it
all was in full:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>CATTLE-LIFTING EXTRAORDINARY.</blockquote>
<p>We have heard from time to time of cattle being stolen in lots of reasonable
size, say from ten to one hundred, or even as high as two hundred head at the
outside. But we never expected to have to record the erecting of a substantial
stockyard and the carrying off and disposing of a whole herd, estimated at a
thousand or eleven hundred head, chiefly the property of one proprietor. Yet
this has been done in New South Wales, and done, we regret to say, cleverly and
successfully. It has just transpired, beyond all possibility of mistake, that
Mr. Hood's Outer Back Momberah run has suffered to that extent in the past
winter. The stolen herd was driven to Adelaide, and there sold openly. The
money was received by the robbers, who were permitted to decamp at their
leisure.</p>
<p>When we mention the name of the notorious 'Starlight', no one will be
surprised that the deed was planned, carried out, and executed with consummate
address and completeness. It seems matter of regret that we cannot persuade
this illustrious depredator to take the command of our police force, that body
of life-assurers and property-protectors which has proved so singularly
ineffective as a preventive service in the present case. On the well-known
proverbial principle we might hope for the best results under Mr. Starlight's
intelligent supervision. We must not withhold our approval as to one item of
success which the force has scored. Starlight himself and a half-caste henchman
have been cleverly captured by Detective Stillbrook, just as the former, who
has been ruffling it among the 'aristocratic' settlers of Christchurch, was
about to sail for Honolulu. The names of his other accomplices, six in number,
it is said, have not as yet transpired.</p>
<p>This last part gave us confidence, but all the same we kept everything ready
for a bolt in case of need. We got up our horses every evening and kept them in
the yard all night. The feed was good by the creek now&mdash;a little dried up
but plenty of bite, and better for horses that had been ridden far and fast
than if it was green. We had enough of last year's hay to give them a feed at
night, and that was all they wanted. They were two pretty good ones and not
slow either. We took care of that when we bought them. Nobody ever saw us on
bad ones since we were boys, and we had broken them in to stand and be caught
day or night, and to let us jump on and off at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>All that day, being awful hot and close, we stayed in the house and yarned
away with mother and Aileen till they thought&mdash;poor souls&mdash;that we
had turned over a new leaf and were going to stay at home and be good boys for
the future. When a man sees how little it takes to make women happy&mdash;them
that's good and never thinks of anything but doing their best for everybody
belonging to 'em&mdash;it's wonderful how men ever make up their minds to go
wrong and bring all that loves them to shame and grief. When they've got nobody
but themselves to think of it don't so much matter as I know of; but to keep on
breaking the hearts of those as never did you anything but good, and wouldn't
if they lived for a hundred years, is cowardly and unmanly any way you look at
it. And yet we'd done very little else ourselves these years and years.</p>
<p>We all sat up till nigh on to midnight with our hands in one
another's&mdash;Jim down at mother's feet; Aileen and I close beside them on
the old seat in the verandah that father made such a time ago. At last mother
gets up, and they both started for bed. Aileen seemed as if she couldn't tear
herself away. Twice she came back, then she kissed us both, and the tears came
into her eyes. 'I feel too happy,' she said; 'I never thought I should feel
like this again. God bless you both, and keep us all from harm.' 'Amen,' said
mother from the next room. We turned out early, and had a bathe in the creek
before we went up to the yard to let out the horses. There wasn't a cloud in
the sky; it was safe to be a roasting hot day, but it was cool then. The little
waterhole where we learned to swim when we were boys was deep on one side and
had a rocky ledge to jump off. The birds just began to give out a note or two;
the sun was rising clear and bright, and we could see the dark top of Nulla
Mountain getting a sort of rose colour against the sky.</p>
<p>'George and Gracey 'll be over soon after breakfast,' I said; 'we must have
everything look ship-shape as well as we can before they turn up.'</p>
<p>'The horses may as well go down to the flat,' Jim says; 'we can catch them
easy enough in time to ride back part of the way with them. I'll run up Lowan,
and give her a bit of hay in the calf-pen.'</p>
<p>We went over to the yard, and Jim let down the rails and walked in. I
stopped outside. Jim had his horse by the mane, and was patting his neck as
mine came out, when three police troopers rose up from behind the bushes, and
covering us with their rifles called out, 'Stand, in the Queen's name!'</p>
<p>Jim made one spring on to his horse's back, drove his heels into his flank,
and was out through the gate and half-way down the hill before you could
wink.</p>
<p>Just as Jim cleared the gate a tall man rose up close behind me and took a
cool pot at him with a revolver. I saw Jim's hat fly off, and another bullet
grazed his horse's hip. I saw the hair fly, and the horse make a plunge that
would have unseated most men with no saddle between their legs. But Jim sat
close and steady and only threw up his arm and gave a shout as the old horse
tore down the hill a few miles an hour faster.</p>
<p>'D&mdash;n those cartridges,' said the tall trooper; 'they always put too
much powder in them for close shooting. Now, Dick Marston!' he went on, putting
his revolver to my head, 'I'd rather not blow your brains out before your
people, but if you don't put up your hands by &mdash;&mdash; I'll shoot you
where you stand.' I had been staring after Jim all the time; I believe I had
never thought of myself till he was safe away.</p>
<p>'Get your horses, you d&mdash;&mdash;d fools,' he shouts out to the men,
'and see if you can follow up that madman. He's most likely knocked off against
a tree by this time.'</p>
<p>There was nothing else for it but to do it and be handcuffed. As the steel
locks snapped I saw mother standing below wringing her hands, and Aileen trying
to get her into the house.</p>
<p>'Better come down and get your coat on, Dick,' said the senior constable.
'We want to search the place, too. By Jove! we shall get pepper from Sir
Ferdinand when we go in. I thought we had you both as safe as chickens in a
coop. Who would have thought of Jim givin' us the slip, on a barebacked horse,
without so much as a halter? I'm devilish sorry for your family; but if nothing
less than a thousand head of cattle will satisfy people, they must expect
trouble to come of it.'</p>
<p>'What are you talking about?' I said. 'You've got the wrong story and the
wrong men.'</p>
<p>'All right; we'll see about that. I don't know whether you want any
breakfast, but I should like a cup of tea. It's deuced slow work watching all
night, though it isn't cold. We've got to be in Bargo barracks to-night, so
there's no time to lose.'</p>
<p>It was all over now&mdash;the worst <i>had</i> come. What fools we had been
not to take the old man's advice, and clear out when he did. He was safe in the
Hollow, and would chuckle to himself&mdash;and be sorry, too&mdash;when he
heard of my being taken, and perhaps Jim. The odds were he might be smashed
against a tree, perhaps killed, at the pace he was going on a horse he could
not guide.</p>
<p>They searched the house, but the money they didn't get. Jim and I had taken
care of that, in case of accidents. Mother sat rocking herself backwards and
forwards, every now and then crying out in a pitiful way, like the women in her
country do, I've heard tell, when some one of their people is dead; 'keening',
I think they call it. Well, Jim and I were as good as dead. If the troopers had
shot the pair of us there and then, same as bushmen told us the black police
did their prisoners when they gave 'em any trouble, it would have been better
for everybody. However, people don't die all at once when they go to the bad,
and take to stealing or drinking, or any of the devil's favourite traps. Pity
they don't, and have done with it once and for all.</p>
<p>I know I thought so when I was forced to stand there with my hands chained
together for the first time in my life (though I'd worked for it, I know that);
and to see Aileen walking about laying the cloth for breakfast like a dead
woman, and know what was in her mind.</p>
<p>The troopers were civil enough, and Goring, the senior constable, tried to
comfort them as much as he could. He knew it was no fault of theirs; and though
he said he meant to have Jim if mortal men and horses could do it he thought he
had a fair chance of getting away. 'He's sure to be caught in the long run,
though,' he went on to say. 'There's a warrant out for him, and a description
in every "Police Gazette" in the colonies. My advice to him would be to come
back and give himself up. It's not a hanging matter, and as it's the first time
you've been fitted, Dick, the judge, as like as not, will let you off with a
light sentence.'</p>
<p>So they talked away until they had finished their breakfast. I couldn't
touch a mouthful for the life of me, and as soon as it was all over they ran up
my horse and put the saddle on. But I wasn't to ride him. No fear! Goring put
me on an old screw of a troop horse, with one leg like a gate-post. I was
helped up and my legs tied under his belly. Then one of the men took the bridle
and led me away. Goring rode in front and the other men behind.</p>
<p>As we rose the hill above the place I looked back and saw mother drop down
on the ground in a kind of fit, while Aileen bent over her and seemed to be
loosening her dress. Just at that moment George Storefield and his sister rode
up to the door. George jumped off and rushed over to Aileen and mother. I knew
Gracey had seen me, for she sat on her horse as if she had been turned to
stone, and let her reins drop on his neck. Strange things have happened to me
since, but I shall never forget that to the last day of my miserable life.</p>
<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<p>I wasn't in the humour for talking, but sometimes anything's better than
one's own thoughts. Goring threw in a word from time to time. He'd only lately
come into our district, and was sure to be promoted, everybody said. Like
Starlight himself, he'd seen better days at home in England; but when he got
pinched he'd taken the right turn and not the wrong one, which makes all the
difference. He was earning his bread honest, anyway, and he was a chap as liked
the fun and dash of a mounted policeman's life. As for the risk&mdash;and there
is some danger, more than people thinks, now and then&mdash;he liked that the
best of it. He was put out at losing Jim; but he believed he couldn't escape,
and told me so in a friendly way. 'He's inside a circle and he can't get away,
you mark my words,' he said, two or three times. 'We have every police-station
warned by wire, within a hundred miles of here, three days ago. There's not a
man in the colony sharper looked after than Master Jim is this minute.'</p>
<p>'Then you only heard about us three days ago?' I said.</p>
<p>'That's as it may be,' he answered, biting his lip. 'Anyhow, there isn't a
shepherd's hut within miles that he can get to without our knowing it. The
country's rough, but there's word gone for a black tracker to go down. You'll
see him in Bargo before the week's out.'</p>
<p>I had a good guess where Jim would make for, and he knew enough to hide his
tracks for the last few miles if there was a whole tribe of trackers after
him.</p>
<p>That night we rode into Bargo. A long day too we'd had&mdash;we were all
tired enough when we got in. I was locked up, of course, and as soon as we were
in the cell Goring said, 'Listen to me,' and put on his official
face&mdash;devilish stern and hard-looking he was then, in spite of all the
talking and nonsense we'd had coming along.</p>
<p>'Richard Marston, I charge you with unlawfully taking, stealing, and
carrying away, in company with others, one thousand head of mixed cattle, more
or less the property of one Walter Hood, of Outer Back, Momberah, in or about
the month of June last.'</p>
<p>'All right; why don't you make it a few more while you're about it?'</p>
<p>'That'll do,' he said, nodding his head, 'you decline to say anything. Well,
I can't exactly wish you a merry Christmas&mdash;fancy this being Christmas
Eve, by Jove!&mdash;but you'll be cool enough this deuced hot weather till the
sessions in February, which is more than some of us can say. Good-night.' He
went out and locked the door. I sat down on my blanket on the floor and hid my
head in my hands. I wonder it didn't burst with what I felt then. Strange that
I shouldn't have felt half as bad when the judge, the other day, sentenced me
to be a dead man in a couple of months. But I was young then.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>Christmas Day! Christmas Day! So this is how I was to spend it after all, I
thought, as I woke up at dawn, and saw the gray light just beginning to get
through the bars of the window of the cell.</p>
<p>Here was I locked up, caged, ironed, disgraced, a felon and an outcast for
the rest of my life. Jim, flying for his life, hiding from every honest man,
every policeman in the country looking after him, and authorised to catch him
or shoot him down like a sheep-killing dog. Father living in the Hollow, like a
blackfellow in a cave, afraid to spend the blessed Christmas with his wife and
daughter, like the poorest man in the land could do if he was only honest.
Mother half dead with grief, and Aileen ashamed to speak to the man that loved
and respected her from her childhood. Gracey Storefield not daring to think of
me or say my name, after seeing me carried off a prisoner before her eyes. Here
was a load of misery and disgrace heaped up together, to be borne by the whole
family, now and for the time to come&mdash;by the innocent as well as the
guilty. And for what? Because we had been too idle and careless to work
regularly and save our money, though well able to do it, like honest men.
Because, little by little, we had let bad dishonest ways and flash manners grow
upon us, all running up an account that had to be paid some day.</p>
<p>And now the day of reckoning had come&mdash;sharp and sudden with a
vengeance! Well, what call had we to look for anything else? We had been
working for it; now we had got it, and had to bear it. Not for want of warning,
neither. What had mother and Aileen been saying ever since we could remember?
Warning upon warning. Now the end had come just as they said. Of course I knew
in a general way that I couldn't be punished or be done anything to right off.
I knew law enough for that. The next thing would be that I should have to be
brought up before the magistrates and committed for trial as soon as they could
get any evidence.</p>
<p>After breakfast, flour and water or hominy, I forget which, the warder told
me that there wasn't much chance of my being brought up before Christmas was
over. The police magistrate was away on a month's leave, and the other
magistrates would not be likely to attend before the end of the week, anyway.
So I must make myself comfortable where I was. Comfortable!</p>
<p>'Had they caught Jim?'</p>
<p>'Well, not that he'd heard of; but Goring said it was impossible for him to
get away. At twelve he'd bring me some dinner.'</p>
<p>I was pretty certain they wouldn't catch Jim, in spite of Goring being so
cocksure about it. If he wasn't knocked off the first mile or so, he'd find
ways of stopping or steadying his horse, and facing him up to where we had gone
to join father at the tableland of the Nulla Mountain. Once he got near there
he could let go his horse. They'd be following his track, while he made the
best of his way on foot to the path that led to the Hollow. If he had five
miles start of them there, as was most likely, all the blacks in the country
would never track where he got to. He and father could live there for a month
or so, and take it easy until they could slip out and do a bit of father's old
trade. That was about what I expected Jim to do, and as it turned out I was as
nearly right as could be. They ran his track for ten miles. Then they followed
his horse-tracks till late the second day, and found that the horse had slued
round and was making for home again with nobody on him. Jim was nowhere to be
seen, and they'd lost all that time, never expecting that he was going to
dismount and leave the horse to go his own way.</p>
<p>They searched Nulla Mountain from top to bottom; but some of the smartest
men of the old Mounted Police and the best of the stockmen in the old
days&mdash;men not easy to beat&mdash;had tried the same country many years
before, and never found the path to the Hollow. So it wasn't likely any one
else would. They had to come back and own that they were beat, which put Goring
in a rage and made the inspector, Sir Ferdinand Morringer, blow them all up for
a lot of duffers and old women. Altogether they had a bad time of it, not that
it made any difference to me.</p>
<p>After the holidays a magistrate was fished up somehow, and I was brought
before him and the apprehending constable's evidence taken. Then I was remanded
to the Bench at Nomah, where Mr. Hood and some of the other witnesses were to
appear. So away we started for another journey. Goring and a trooper went with
me, and all sorts of care was taken that I didn't give them the slip on the
road. Goring used to put one of my handcuffs on his own wrist at night, so
there wasn't much chance of moving without waking him. I had an old horse to
ride that couldn't go much faster than I could run, for fear of accident. It
was even betting that he'd fall and kill me on the road. If I'd had a laugh in
me, I should have had a joke against the Police Department for not keeping
safer horses for their prisoners to ride. They keep them till they haven't a
leg to stand upon, and long after they can't go a hundred yards without trying
to walk on their heads they're thought good enough to carry packs and
prisoners.</p>
<p>'Some day,' Goring said, 'one of those old screws will be the death of a
prisoner before he's committed for trial, and then there'll be a row over it, I
suppose.'</p>
<p>We hadn't a bad journey of it on the whole. The troopers were civil enough,
and gave me a glass of grog now and then when they had one themselves. They'd
done their duty in catching me, and that was all they thought about. What came
afterwards wasn't their look-out. I've no call to have any bad feeling against
the police, and I don't think most men of my sort have. They've got their work
to do, like other people, and as long as they do what they're paid for, and
don't go out of their way to harass men for spite, we don't bear them any
malice. If one's hit in fair fight it's the fortune of war. What our side don't
like is men going in for police duty that's not in their line. That's
interfering, according to our notions, and if they fall into a trap or are met
with when they don't expect it they get it pretty hot. They've only themselves
to thank for it.</p>
<p>Goring, I could see by his ways, had been a swell, something like Starlight.
A good many young fellows that don't drop into fortunes when they come out here
take to the police in Australia, and very good men they make. They like the
half-soldiering kind of life, and if they stick steady at their work, and show
pluck and gumption, they mostly get promoted. Goring was a real smart, dashing
chap, a good rider for an Englishman; that is, he could set most horses, and
hold his own with us natives anywhere but through scrub and mountain country.
No man can ride there, I don't care who he is, the same as we can, unless he's
been at it all his life. There we have the pull&mdash;not that it is so much
after all. But give a native a good horse and thick country, and he'll lose any
man living that's tackled the work after he's grown up.</p>
<p>By and by we got to Nomah, a regular hot hole of a place, with a log
lock-up. I was stuck in, of course, and had leg-irons put on for fear I should
get out, as another fellow had done a few weeks back. Starlight and Warrigal
hadn't reached yet; they had farther to come. The trial couldn't come till the
Quarter Sessions. January, and February too, passed over, and all this time I
was mewed up in a bit of a place enough to stifle a man in the burning weather
we had.</p>
<p>I heard afterwards that they wanted to bring some of the cattle over, so as
Mr. Hood could swear to 'em being his property. But he said he could only swear
to its being his brand; that he most likely had never set eyes on them in his
life, and couldn't swear on his own knowledge that they hadn't been sold, like
lots of others, by his manager. So this looked like a hitch, as juries won't
bring a man in guilty of cattle-stealing unless there's clear swearing that the
animals he sold were the property of the prosecutor, and known by him to be
such.</p>
<p>Mr. Hood had to go all the way to Adelaide himself, and they told me we
might likely have got out of it all, only for the imported bull. When he saw
him he said he could swear to him point blank, brand or no brand. He'd no brand
on him, of course, when he left England; but Hood happened to be in Sydney when
he came out, and at the station when he came up. He was stabled for the first
six months, so he used to go and look him over every day, and tell visitors
what a pot of money he'd cost, till he knew every hair in his tail, as the
saying is. As soon as he seen him in Adelaide he said he could swear to him as
positive as he could to his favourite riding horse. So he was brought over in a
steamer from Adelaide, and then drove all the way up to Nomah. I wished he'd
broken his neck before we ever saw him.</p>
<p>Next thing I saw was Starlight being brought in, handcuffed, between two
troopers, and looking as if he'd ridden a long way. He was just as easy-going
and devil-may-care as ever. He said to one of the troopers&mdash;</p>
<p>'Here we are at last, and I'm deuced glad of it. It's perfectly monstrous
you fellows haven't better horses. You ought to make me remount agent, and I'd
show you the sort of horses that ought to be bought for police service. Let me
have a glass of beer, that's a good fellow, before I'm locked up. I suppose
there's no tap worth speaking of inside.'</p>
<p>The constable laughed, and had one brought to him.</p>
<p>'It will be some time before you get another, captain. Here's a long one for
you; make the most of it.'</p>
<p>Where, in the devil's name, is that Warrigal? I thought to myself. Has he
given them the slip? He had, as it turned out. He had slipped the handcuffs
over his slight wrists and small hands, bided his time, and then dashed into a
scrub. There he was at home. They rode and rode, but Warrigal was gone like a
rock wallaby. It was a good while before he was as near the gaol again.</p>
<p>All this time I'd been wondering how it was they came to drop on our names
so pat, and to find out that Jim and I had a share in the Momberah cattle
racket. All they could have known was that we left the back of Boree at a
certain day; and that was nothing, seeing that for all they knew we might have
gone away to new country or anywhere. The more I looked at it the more I felt
sure that some one had given to the police information about us&mdash;somebody
who was in it and knew all about everything. It wasn't Starlight. We could have
depended our life on him. It might have been one of the other chaps, but I
couldn't think of any one, except Warrigal. He would do anything in the world
to spite me and Jim, I knew; but then he couldn't hurt us without drawing the
net tighter round Starlight. Sooner than hurt a hair of his head he'd have put
his hand into the fire and kept it there. I knew that from things I'd seen him
do.</p>
<p>Starlight and I hadn't much chance of a talk, but we managed to get news
from each other, a bit at a time; that can always be managed. We were to be
defended, and a lawyer fetched all the way from Sydney to fight our case for
us. The money was there. Father managed the other part of it through people he
had that did every kind of work for him; so when the judge came up we should
have a show for it.</p>
<p>The weary long summer days&mdash;every one of them about twenty hours
long&mdash;came to an end somehow or other. It was so hot and close and I was
that miserable I had two minds to knock my brains out and finish the whole
thing. I couldn't settle to read, as I did afterwards. I was always wishing and
wondering when I'd hear some news from home, and none ever came. Nomah was a
bit of a place where hardly anybody did anything but idle and drink, and spend
money when they had it. When they had none they went away. There wasn't even a
place to take exercise in, and the leg-irons I wore night and day began to eat
into my flesh. I wasn't used to them in those days. I could feel them in my
heart, too. Last of all I got ill, and for a while was so weak and low they
thought I was going to get out of the trial altogether.</p>
<p>At last we heard that the judge and all his lot were on the road, and would
be up in a few days. We were almost as glad when the news came as if we were
sure of being let off. One day they did come, and all the little town was
turned upside down. The judge stopped at one hotel (they told us); the lawyers
at another. Then the witnesses in ours and other cases came in from all parts,
and made a great difference, especially to the publicans. The jurors were
summoned, and had to come, unless they had a fancy for being fined. Most of
this I heard from the constables; they seemed to think it was the only thing
that made any difference in their lives. Last of all I heard that Mr. Hood had
come, and the imported bull, and some other witnesses.</p>
<p>There were some small cases first, and then we were brought out, Starlight
and I, and put in the dock. The court was crammed and crowded; every soul
within a hundred miles seemed to have come in; there never were so many people
in the little courthouse before. Starlight was quietly dressed, and looked as
if he was there by mistake. Anybody would have thought so, the way he lounged
and stared about, as if he thought there was something very curious and hard to
understand about the whole thing. I was so weak and ill that I couldn't stand
up, and after a while the judge told me to sit down, and Starlight too.
Starlight made a most polite bow, and thanked his Honour, as he called him.
Then the jury were called up, and our lawyer began his work. He stood alongside
of Starlight, and whispered something to him, after which Starlight stood up,
and about every second man called out 'Challenge'; then that juror had to go
down. It took a good while to get our jury all together. Our lawyer seemed very
particular about the sort of jury he was satisfied with; and when they did
manage to get twelve at last they were not the best-looking men in the court by
a very long way.</p>
<p>The trial had to go on, and then the Crown Prosecutor made a speech, in
which he talked about the dishonesty which was creeping unchecked over the
land, and the atrocious villainy of criminals who took a thousand head of
cattle in one lot, and made out the country was sure to go to destruction if we
were not convicted. He said that unfortunately they were not in a position to
bring many of the cattle back that had been taken to another colony; but one
remarkable animal was as good for purposes of evidence as a hundred. Such an
animal he would produce, and he would not trespass on the patience of jurors
and gentlemen in attendance any longer, but call his first witness.</p>
<p>John Dawson, sworn: Was head stockman and cattle manager at Momberah; knew
the back country, and in a general way the cattle running there; was not out
much in the winter; the ground was boggy, and the cattle were hardly ever
mustered till spring; when he did go, with some other stock-riders, he saw at
once that a large number of the Momberah cattle, branded HOD and other brands,
were missing; went to Adelaide a few months after; saw a large number of cattle
of the HOD brand, which he was told had been sold by the prisoner now before
the court, and known as Starlight, and others, to certain farmers; he could
swear that the cattle he saw bore Mr. Hood's brand; could not swear that he
recognised them as having been at Momberah in his charge; believed so, but
could not swear it; he had seen a short-horn bull outside of the court this
morning; he last saw the said bull at the station of Messrs. Fordham Brothers,
near Adelaide; they made a communication to him concerning the bull; he would
and could swear to the identity of the animal with the Fifteenth Duke of
Cambridge, an imported short-horn bull, the property of Mr. Hood; had seen him
before that at Momberah; knew that Mr. Hood had bought said bull in Sydney, and
was at Momberah when he was sent up; could not possibly be mistaken; when he
saw the bull at Momberah, nine months since, he had a small brand like H on the
shoulder; Mr. Hood put it on in witness's presence; it was a horse-brand, now
it resembled J-E; the brand had been 'faked' or cleverly altered; witness could
see the original brand quite plain underneath; as far as he knew Mr. Hood never
sold or gave any one authority to take the animal; he had missed him some
months since, and always believed he had strayed; knew the bull to be a
valuable animal, worth several hundred pounds.</p>
<p>We had one bit of luck in having to be tried in an out-of-the-way place like
Nomah. It was a regular outside bush township, and though the distance oughtn't
to have much to say to people's honesty, you'll mostly find that these far-out
back-of-beyond places have got men and women to match 'em.</p>
<p>Except the squatters and overseers, the other people's mostly a shady lot.
Some's run away from places that were too hot to hold 'em. The women ain't the
men's wives that they live with, but somebody else's&mdash;who's well rid of
'em too if all was known. There's most likely a bit of horse and cattle
stealing done on the quiet, and the publicans and storekeepers know who are
their best customers, the square people or the cross ones. It ain't so easy to
get a regular up-and-down straight-ahead jury in a place of this sort. So
Starlight and I knew that our chance was a lot better than if we'd been tried
at Bargo or Dutton Forest, or any steady-going places of that sort.</p>
<p>If we'd made up our minds from the first that we were to get into it it
wouldn't have been so bad; we'd have known we had to bear it. Now we might get
out of it, and what a thing it would be to feel free again, and walk about in
the sun without any one having the right to stop you. Almost, that
is&mdash;there were other things against us; but there wasn't so much of a
chance of their turning up. This was the great stake. If we won we were as good
as made. I felt ready to swear I'd go home and never touch a shilling that
didn't come honest again. If we lost it seemed as if everything was so much the
worse, and blacker than it looked at first, just for this bit of hope and
comfort.</p>
<p>After the bull had been sworn to by Mr. Hood and another witness, they
brought up some more evidence, as they called it, about the other cattle we had
sold in Adelaide. They had fetched some of the farmers up that had been at the
sale. They swore straight enough to having bought cattle with certain brands
from Starlight. They didn't know, of course, at the time whose they were, but
they could describe the brands fast enough. There was one fellow that couldn't
read nor write, but he remembered all the brands, about a dozen, in the pen of
steers he bought, and described them one by one. One brand, he said, was like a
long-handled shovel. It turned out to be&mdash;D. TD&mdash;Tom Dawson's, of
Mungeree. About a hundred of his were in the mob. They had drawn back for
Mungeree, as was nearly all frontage and cold in the winter. He was the worst
witness for us of the lot, very near. He'd noticed everything and forgot
nothing.</p>
<p>'Do you recognise either of the prisoners in the dock?' he was asked.</p>
<p>'Yes; both of 'em,' says he. I wish I could have got at him. 'I see the
swell chap first&mdash;him as made out he was the owner, and gammoned all the
Adelaide gentlemen so neat. There was a half-caste chap with him as followed
him about everywhere; then there was another man as didn't talk much, but
seemed, by letting down sliprails and what not, to be in it. I heard this
Starlight, as he calls hisself now, say to him, "You have everything ready to
break camp by ten o'clock, and I'll be there to-morrow and square up." I
thought he meant to pay their wages. I never dropped but what they was his
men&mdash;his hired servants&mdash;as he was going to pay off or send
back.'</p>
<p>'Will you swear,' our lawyer says, 'that the younger prisoner is the man you
saw at Adelaide with the cattle?'</p>
<p>'Yes; I'll swear. I looked at him pretty sharp, and nothing ain't likely to
make me forget him. He's the man, and that I'll swear to.'</p>
<p>'Were there not other people there with the cattle?'</p>
<p>'Yes; there was an oldish, very quiet, but determined-like man&mdash;he had
a stunnin' dorg with him&mdash;and a young man something like this
gentleman&mdash;I mean the prisoner. I didn't see the other young man nor the
half-caste in court.'</p>
<p>'That's all very well,' says our lawyer, very fierce; 'but will you swear,
sir, that the prisoner Marston took any charge or ownership of the cattle?'</p>
<p>'No, I can't,' says the chap. 'I see him a drafting 'em in the morning, and
he seemed to know all the brands, and so on; but he done no more than I've seen
hired servants do over and over again.'</p>
<p>The other witnesses had done, when some one called out, 'Herbert Falkland,'
and Mr. Falkland steps into the court. He walks in quiet and a little proud; he
couldn't help feeling it, but he didn't show it in his ways and talk, as little
as any man I ever saw.</p>
<p>He's asked by the Crown Prosecutor if he's seen the bull outside of the
court this day.</p>
<p>'Yes; he has seen him.'</p>
<p>'Has he ever seen him before?'</p>
<p>'Never, to his knowledge.'</p>
<p>'He doesn't, then, know the name of his former owner?'</p>
<p>'Has heard generally that he belonged to Mr. Hood, of Momberah; but does not
know it of his own knowledge.'</p>
<p>'Has he ever seen, or does he know either of the prisoners?'</p>
<p>'Knows the younger prisoner, who has been in the habit of working for him in
various ways.'</p>
<p>'When was prisoner Marston working for him last?'</p>
<p>'He, with his brother James, who rendered his family a service he shall
never forget, was working for him, after last shearing, for some months.'</p>
<p>'Where were they working?'</p>
<p>'At an out-station at the back of the run.'</p>
<p>'When did they leave?'</p>
<p>'About April or May last.'</p>
<p>'Was it known to you in what direction they proceeded after leaving your
service?'</p>
<p>'I have no personal knowledge; I should think it improper to quote
hearsay.'</p>
<p>'Had they been settled up with for their former work?'</p>
<p>'No, there was a balance due to them.'</p>
<p>'To what amount?'</p>
<p>'About twenty pounds each was owing.'</p>
<p>'Did you not think it curious that ordinary labourers should leave so large
a sum in your hands?'</p>
<p>'It struck me as unusual, but I did not attach much weight to the
circumstance. I thought they would come back and ask for it before the next
shearing. I am heartily sorry that they did not do so, and regret still more
deeply that two young men worthy of a better fate should have been arraigned on
such a charge.'</p>
<p>'One moment, Mr. Falkland,' says our counsel, as they call them, and a
first-rate counsellor ours was. If we'd been as innocent as two schoolgirls he
couldn't have done more for us. 'Did the prisoner Marston work well and conduct
himself properly while in your employ?'</p>
<p>'No man better,' says Mr. Falkland, looking over to me with that pitying
kind of look in his eyes as made me feel what a fool and rogue I'd been ten
times worse than anything else. 'No man better; he and his brother were in many
respects, according to my overseer's report, the most hard-working and
best-conducted labourers in the establishment.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<p>Mr. Runnimall, the auctioneer, swore that the older prisoner placed certain
cattle in his hands, to arrive, for sale in the usual way, stating that his
name was Mr. Charles Carisforth, and that he had several stations in other
colonies. Had no reason for doubting him. Prisoner was then very well dressed,
was gentlemanly in his manners, and came to his office with a young gentleman
of property whom he knew well. The cattle were sold in the usual way for rather
high prices, as the market was good. The proceeds in cash were paid over to the
prisoner, whom he now knew by the name of Starlight. He accounted for there
being an unusual number of brands by saying publicly at the sale that the
station had been used as a depot for other runs of his, and the remainder lots
of store cattle kept there.</p>
<p>He had seen a short-horn bull outside of the court this day branded 'J-E' on
the shoulder. He identified him as one of the cattle placed in his hands for
sale by the prisoner Starlight. He sold and delivered him according to
instructions. He subsequently handed over the proceeds to the said prisoner. He
included the purchase money in a cheque given for the bull and other cattle
sold on that day. He could swear positively to the bull; he was a remarkable
animal. He had not the slightest doubt as to his identity.</p>
<p>'Had he seen the prisoner Marston when the cattle were sold now alleged to
belong to Mr. Hood?'</p>
<p>'Yes; he was confident that prisoner was there with some other men whom he
(witness) did not particularly remark. He helped to draft the cattle, and to
put them in pens on the morning of the sale.'</p>
<p>'Was he prepared to swear that prisoner Marston was not a hired servant of
prisoner Starlight?'</p>
<p>'No; he could not swear. He had no way of knowing what the relations were
between the two. They were both in the robbery; he could see that.'</p>
<p>'How could you see that?' said our lawyer. 'Have you never seen a paid
stockman do all that you saw prisoner Marston do?'</p>
<p>'Well, I have; but somehow I fancy this man was different.'</p>
<p>'We have nothing to do with your fancies, sir,' says our man, mighty hot, as
he turns upon him; 'you are here to give evidence as to facts, not as to what
you fancy. Have you any other grounds for connecting prisoner Marston with the
robbery in question?'</p>
<p>'No, he had not.'</p>
<p>'You can go down, sir, and I only wish you may live to experience some of
the feelings which fill the breasts of persons who are unjustly convicted.'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>This about ended the trial. There was quite enough proved for a moderate
dose of transportation. A quiet, oldish-looking man got up now and came forward
to the witness-box. I didn't know who he was; but Starlight nodded to him quite
pleasant. He had a short, close-trimmed beard, and was one of those
nothing-particular-looking old chaps. I'm blessed if I could have told what he
was. He might have been a merchant, or a squatter, or a head clerk, or a wine
merchant, or a broker, or lived in the town, or lived in the country; any of
half-a-dozen trades would suit him. The only thing that was out of the common
was his eyes. They had a sort of curious way of looking at you, as if he
wondered whether you was speaking true, and yet seein' nothing and tellin'
nothing. He regular took in Starlight (he told me afterwards) by always talking
about the China Seas; he'd been there, it seems; he'd been everywhere; he'd
last come from America; he didn't say he'd gone there to collar a clerk that
had run off with two or three thousand pounds, and to be ready to meet him as
he stepped ashore.</p>
<p>Anyhow he'd watched Starlight in Canterbury when he was riding and flashing
about, and had put such a lot of things together that he took a passage in the
same boat with him to Melbourne. Why didn't he arrest him in New Zealand?
Because he wasn't sure of his man. It was from something Starlight let out on
board ship. He told me himself afterwards that he made sure of his being the
man he wanted; so he steps into the witness-box, very quiet and
respectable-looking, with his white waistcoat and silk coat&mdash;it was hot
enough to fry beefsteaks on the roof of the courthouse that day&mdash;and looks
about him. The Crown Prosecutor begins with him as civil as you please.</p>
<p>'My name is Stephen Stillbrook. I am a sergeant of detective police in the
service of the Government of New South Wales. From information received, I
proceeded to Canterbury, in New Zealand, about the month of September last. I
saw there the older prisoner, who was living at a first-class hotel in
Christchurch. He was moving in good society, and was apparently possessed of
ample means. He frequently gave expensive entertainments, which were attended
by the leading inhabitants and high officials of the place. I myself obtained
an introduction to him, and partook of his hospitality on several occasions. I
attempted to draw him out in conversation about New South Wales; but he was
cautious, and gave me to understand that he had been engaged in large squatting
transactions in another colony. From his general bearing and from the character
of his associates, I came to the belief that he was not the individual named in
the warrant, and determined to return to Sydney. I was informed that he had
taken his passage to Melbourne in a mail steamer. From something which I one
day heard his half-caste servant say, who, being intoxicated, was speaking
carelessly, I determined to accompany them to Melbourne. My suspicions were
confirmed on the voyage. As we went ashore at the pier at Sandridge I accosted
him. I said, "I arrest you on suspicion of having stolen a herd of cattle, the
property of Walter Hood, of Momberah." Prisoner was very cool and polite, just
as any other gentleman would be, and asked me if I did not think I'd made a
most ridiculous mistake. The other passengers began to laugh, as if it was the
best joke in the world. Starlight never moved a muscle. I've seen a good many
cool hands in my time, but I never met any one like him. I had given notice to
one of the Melbourne police as he came aboard, and he arrested the half-caste,
known as Warrigal. I produced a warrant, the one now before the court, which is
signed by a magistrate of the territory of New South Wales.'</p>
<p>The witnessing part was all over. It took the best part of the day, and
there we were all the time standing up in the dock, with the court crammed with
people staring at us. I don't say that it felt as bad as it might have done
nigh home. Most of the Nomah people looked upon fellows stealing cattle or
horses, in small lots or big, just like most people look at boys stealing fruit
out of an orchard, or as they used to talk of smugglers on the English coast,
as I've heard father tell of. Any man might take a turn at that sort of thing,
now and then, and not be such a bad chap after all. It was the duty of the
police to catch him. If they caught him, well and good, it was so much the
worse for him; if they didn't, that was their look-out. It wasn't anybody
else's business anyhow. And a man that wasn't caught, or that got turned up at
his trial, was about as good as the general run of people; and there was no
reason for any one to look shy at him.</p>
<p>After the witnesses had said all they knew our lawyer got up and made a
stunning speech. He made us out such first-rate chaps that it looked as if we
ought to get off flying. He blew up the squatters in a general way for taking
all the country, and not giving the poor man a chance&mdash;for neglecting
their immense herds of cattle and suffering them to roam all over the country,
putting temptation in the way of poor people, and causing confusion and
recklessness of all kinds. Some of these cattle are never seen from the time
they are branded till they are mustered, every two or three years apparently.
They stray away hundreds of miles&mdash;probably a thousand&mdash;who is to
know? Possibly they are sold. It was admitted by the prosecutor that he had
sold 10,000 head of cattle during the last six years, and none had been
rebranded to his knowledge. What means had he of knowing whether these cattle
that so much was said about had not been legally sold before? It was a most
monstrous thing that men like his clients&mdash;men who were an honour to the
land they lived in&mdash;should be dragged up to the very centre of the
continent upon a paltry charge like this&mdash;a charge which rested upon the
flimsiest evidence it had ever been his good fortune to demolish.</p>
<p>With regard to the so-called imported bull the case against his clients was
apparently stronger, but he placed no reliance upon the statements of the
witnesses, who averred that they knew him so thoroughly that they could not be
deceived in him. He distrusted their evidence and believed the jury would
distrust it too. The brand was as different as possible from the brand seen to
have been on the beast originally. One short-horn was very like another. He
would not undertake to swear positively in any such case, and he implored the
jury, as men of the world, as men of experience in all transactions relating to
stock (here some of the people in the court grinned) to dismiss from their
minds everything of the nature of prejudice, and looking solely at the
miserable, incomplete, unsatisfactory nature of the evidence, to acquit the
prisoners.</p>
<p>It sounded all very pleasant after everything before had been so rough on
our feelings, and the jury looked as if they'd more than half made up their
minds to let us off.</p>
<p>Then the judge put on his glasses and began to go all over the evidence,
very grave and steady like, and read bits out of the notes which he'd taken
very careful all the time. Judges don't have such an easy time of it as some
people thinks they have. I've often wondered as they take so much trouble, and
works away so patient trying to find out the rights and wrongs of things for
people that they never saw before, and won't see again. However, they try to do
their best, all as I've ever seen, and they generally get somewhere near the
right and justice of things. So the judge began and read&mdash;went over the
evidence bit by bit, and laid it all out before the jury, so as they couldn't
but see it where it told against us, and, again, where it was a bit in our
favour.</p>
<p>As for the main body of the cattle, he made out that there was strong
grounds for thinking as we'd taken and sold them at Adelaide, and had the money
too. The making of a stockyard at the back of Momberah was not the thing honest
men would do. But neither of us prisoners had been seen there. There was no
identification of the actual cattle, branded 'HOD', alleged to have been
stolen, nor could Mr. Hood swear positively that they were his cattle, had
never been sold, and were a portion of his herd. It was in the nature of these
cases that identification of live stock, roaming over the immense solitudes of
the interior, should be difficult, occasionally impossible. Yet he trusted that
the jury would give full weight to all the circumstances which went to show a
continuous possession of the animals alleged to be stolen. The persons of both
prisoners had been positively sworn to by several witnesses as having been seen
at the sale of the cattle referred to. They were both remarkable-looking men,
and such as if once seen would be retained in the memory of the beholder.</p>
<p>But the most important piece of evidence (here the judge stopped and took a
pinch of snuff) was that afforded by the short-horn bull, Fifteenth Duke of
Cambridge&mdash;he had been informed that was his name. That animal, in the
first place, was sworn to most positively by Mr. Hood, and claimed as his
property. Other credible witnesses testified also to his identity, and
corroborated the evidence of Mr. Hood in all respects; the ownership and
identity of the animal are thus established beyond all doubt.</p>
<p>Then there was the auctioneer, Mr. Runnimall, who swore that this animal had
been, with other cattle, placed in his hands for sale by the older prisoner.
The bull is accordingly sold publicly by him, and in the prisoner's presence.
He subsequently receives from the witness the price, about &pound;270, for
which the bull was sold. The younger prisoner was there at the same time, and
witnessed the sale of the bull and other cattle, giving such assistance as
would lead to the conclusion that he was concerned in the transaction.</p>
<p>He did not wish to reflect upon this or any other jury, but he could not
help recalling the fact that a jury in that town once committed the
unpardonable fault, the crime, he had almost said, of refusing to find a
prisoner guilty against whom well confirmed evidence had been brought. It had
been his advice to the Minister for Justice, so glaring was the miscarriage of
justice to which he referred, that the whole of the jurymen who had sat upon
that trial should be struck off the roll. This was accordingly done.</p>
<p>He, the judge, was perfectly convinced in his own mind that no impropriety
of this sort was likely to be committed by the intelligent, respectable jury
whom he saw before him; but it was his duty to warn them that, in his opinion,
they could not bring in any verdict but 'Guilty' if they respected their oaths.
He should leave the case confidently in their hands, again impressing upon them
that they could only find one verdict if they believed the evidence.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>The jury all went out. Then another case was called on, and a fresh jury
sworn in for to try it. We sat in the dock. The judge told Starlight he might
sit down, and we waited till they came back. I really believe that waiting is
the worst part of the whole thing, the bitterest part of the punishment. I've
seen men when they were being tried for their lives&mdash;haven't I done it,
and gone through it myself?&mdash;waiting there an hour&mdash;two hours, half
through the night, not knowing whether they was to be brought in guilty or not.
What a hell they must have gone through in that time&mdash;doubt and dread,
hope and fear, wretchedness and despair, over and over and over again. No
wonder some of 'em can't stand it, but keeps twitching and shifting and getting
paler and turning faint when the jury comes back, and they think they see one
thing or the other written in their faces. I've seen a strong man drop down
like a dead body when the judge opened his mouth to pass sentence on him. I've
seen 'em faint, too, when the foreman of the jury said 'Not guilty.' One chap,
he was an innocent up-country fellow, in for his first bit of duffing, like we
was once, he covered his face with his hands when he found he was let off, and
cried like a child. All sorts and kinds of different ways men takes it. I was
in court once when the judge asked a man who'd just been found guilty if he'd
anything to say why he shouldn't pass sentence of death upon him. He'd killed a
woman, cut her throat, and a regular right down cruel murder it was (only men
'll kill women and one another, too, for some causes, as long as the world
lasts); and he just leaned over the dock rails, as if he'd been going to get
three months, and said, cool and quiet, 'No, your Honour; not as I know of.'
He'd made up his mind to it from the first, you see, and that makes all the
difference. He knew he hadn't the ghost of a chance to get out of it, and when
his time came he faced it. I remember seeing his worst enemy come into the
court, and sit and look at him then just to see how he took it, but he didn't
make the least sign. That man couldn't have told whether he seen him or
not.</p>
<p>Starlight and I wasn't likely to break down&mdash;not much&mdash;whatever
the jury did or the judge said. All the same, after an hour had passed, and we
still waiting there, it began to be a sickening kind of feeling. The day had
been all taken up with the evidence and the rest of the trial; all long,
dragging hours of a hot summer's day. The sun had been blazing away all day on
the iron roof of the courthouse and the red dust of the streets, that lay
inches deep for a mile all round the town. The flies buzzed all over the
courthouse, and round and round, while the lawyers talked and wrangled with
each other; and still the trial went on. Witness after witness was called, and
cross-examined and bullied, and confused and contradicted till he was afraid to
say what he knew or what he didn't know. I began to think it must be some kind
of performance that would go on for ever and never stop, and the day and it
never could end.</p>
<p>At last the sun came shining level with the lower window, and we knew it was
getting late. After a while the twilight began to get dimmer and grayer. There
isn't much out there when the sun goes down. Then the judge ordered the lamps
to be lighted.</p>
<p>Just at that time the bailiff came forward.</p>
<p>'Your Honour, the jury has agreed.' I felt my teeth shut hard; but I made no
move or sign. I looked over at Starlight. He yawned. He did, as I'm alive.</p>
<p>'I wish to heaven they'd make more haste,' he said quietly; 'his Honour and
we are both being done out of our dinners.'</p>
<p>I said nothing. I was looking at the foreman's face. I thought I knew the
word he was going to say, and that word was 'Guilty.' Sure enough I didn't hear
anything more for a bit. I don't mind owning that. Most men feel that way the
first time. There was a sound like rushing waters in my ears, and the
courthouse and the people all swam before my eyes.</p>
<p>The first I heard was Starlight's voice again, just as cool and leisurely as
ever. I never heard any difference in it, and I've known him speak in a lot of
different situations. If you shut your eyes you couldn't tell from the tone of
his voice whether he was fighting for his life or asking you to hand him the
salt. When he said the hardest and fiercest thing&mdash;and he could be hard
and fierce&mdash;he didn't raise his voice; he only seemed to speak more
distinct like. His eyes were worse than his voice at such times. There weren't
many men that liked to look back at him, much less say anything.</p>
<p>Now he said, 'That means five years of Berrima, Dick, if not seven. It's
cooler than these infernal logs, that's one comfort.'</p>
<p>I said nothing. I couldn't joke. My throat was dry, and I felt hot and cold
by turns. I thought of the old hut by the creek, and could see mother sitting
rocking herself, and crying out loud, and Aileen with a set dull look on her
face as if she'd never speak or smile again. I thought of the days, months,
years that were to pass under lock and key, with irons and shame and solitude
all for company. I wondered if the place where they shut up mad people was like
a gaol, and why we were not sent there instead.</p>
<p>I heard part of what the judge said, but not all&mdash;bits here and there.
The jury had brought in a most righteous verdict; just what he should have
expected from the effect of the evidence upon an intelligent, well-principled
Nomah jury. (We heard afterwards that they were six to six, and then agreed to
toss up how the verdict was to go.) 'The crime of cattle and horse stealing had
assumed gigantic proportions. Sheep, as yet, appeared to be safe; but then
there were not very many within a few hundred miles of Nomah. It appeared to
him that the prisoner known as Starlight, though from old police records his
real name appeared to be &mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>Here he drew himself up and faced the judge in defiance. Then like lightning
he seemed to change, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>'Your Honour, I submit that it can answer no good purpose to disclose my
alleged name. There are others&mdash;I do not speak for myself.'</p>
<p>The judge stopped a bit; then hesitated. Starlight bowed. 'I do
not&mdash;a&mdash;know whether there is any necessity to make public a name
which many years since was not better known than honoured. I say
the&mdash;a&mdash;prisoner known as Starlight has, from the evidence, taken the
principal part in this nefarious transaction. It is not the first offence, as I
observe from a paper I hold in my hand. The younger prisoner, Marston, has very
properly been found guilty of criminal complicity with the same offence. It may
be that he has been concerned in other offences against the law, but of that we
have no proof before this court. He has not been previously convicted. I do not
offer advice to the elder criminal; his own heart and conscience, the
promptings of which I assume to be dulled, not obliterated, I feel convinced,
have said more to him in the way of warning, condemnation, and remorse than
could the most impressive rebuke, the most solemn exhortation from a judicial
bench. But to the younger man, to him whose vigorous frame has but lately
attained the full development of early manhood, I feel compelled to appeal with
all the weight which age and experience may lend. I adjure him to accept the
warning which the sentence I am about to pass will convey to him, to endure his
confinement with submission and repentance, and to lead during his remaining
years, which may be long and comparatively peaceful, the free and necessarily
happy life of an honest man. The prisoner Starlight is sentenced to seven
years' imprisonment; the prisoner Richard Marston to five years' imprisonment;
both in Berrima Gaol.'</p>
<p>I heard the door of the dock unclose with a snap. We were taken out; I
hardly knew how. I walked like a man in his sleep. 'Five years, Berrima Gaol!
Berrima Gaol!' kept ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>The day was done, the stars were out, as we moved across from the courthouse
to the lock-up. The air was fresh and cool. The sun had gone down; so had the
sun of our lives, never to rise again.</p>
<p>Morning came. Why did it ever come again? I thought. What did we want but
night?&mdash;black as our hearts&mdash;dark as our fate&mdash;dismal as the
death which likely would come quick as a living tomb, and the sooner the
better. Mind you, I only felt this way the first time. All men do, I suppose,
that haven't been born in gaols and workhouses. Afterwards they take a more
everyday view of things.</p>
<p>'You're young and soft, Dick,' Starlight said to me as we were rumbling
along in the coach next day, with hand and leg-irons on, and a trooper opposite
to us. 'Why don't I feel like it? My good fellow, I have felt it all before.
But if you sear your flesh or your horse's with a red-hot iron you'll find the
flesh hard and callous ever after. My heart was seared once&mdash;ay,
twice&mdash;and deeply, too. I have no heart now, or if I ever feel at all it's
for a horse. I wonder how old Rainbow gets on.'</p>
<p>'You were sorry father let us come in the first time,' I said. 'How do you
account for that, if you've no heart?'</p>
<p>'Really! Well, listen, Richard. Did I? If you guillotine a man&mdash;cut off
his head, as they do in France, with an axe that falls like the monkey of a
pile-driver&mdash;the limbs quiver and stretch, and move almost naturally for a
good while afterwards. I've seen the performance more than once. So I suppose
the internal arrangements immediately surrounding my heart must have performed
some kind of instinctive motion in your case and Jim's. By the way, where the
deuce has Jim been all this time? Clever James!'</p>
<p>'Better ask Evans here if the police knows. It is not for want of trying if
they don't.'</p>
<p>'By the Lord Harry, no!' said the trooper, a young man who saw no reason not
to be sociable. 'It's the most surprisin' thing out where he's got to. They've
been all round him, reg'lar cordon-like, and he must have disappeared into the
earth or gone up in a balloon to get away.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<p>It took us a week's travelling or more to get to Berrima. Sometimes we were
all night in the coach as well as all day. There were other passengers in the
coach with us. Two or three bushmen, a station overseer with his wife and
daughter, a Chinaman, and a lunatic that had come from Nomah, too. I think it's
rough on the public to pack madmen and convicts in irons in the same coach with
them. But it saves the Government a good deal of money, and the people don't
seem to care. They stand it, anyhow.</p>
<p>We would have made a bolt of it if we'd had a chance, but we never had,
night nor day, not half a one. The police were civil, but they never left us,
and slept by us at night. That is, one watched while the other slept. We began
to sleep soundly ourselves and to have a better appetite. Going through the
fresh air had something to do with it, I daresay. And then there was no
anxiety. We had played for a big stake and lost. Now we had to pay and make the
best of it. It was the tenth day (there were no railways then to shorten the
journey) when we drove up to the big gate and looked at the high walls and
dark, heavy lines of Berrima Gaol, the largest, the most severe, the most
dreaded of all the prisons in New South Wales. It had leaked out the day
before, somehow, that the famous Starlight and the other prisoner in the great
Momberah cattle robbery were to be brought in this particular day. There was a
fair-sized crowd gathered as we were helped down from the coach. At the side of
the crowd was a small mob of blacks with their dogs, spears, 'possum rugs and
all complete. They and their gins and pickaninnies appeared to take great
notice of the whole thing. One tallish gin, darker than the others, and with
her hair tucked under an old bonnet, wrapped her 'possum cloak closely round
her shoulders and pushed up close to us. She looked hard at Starlight, who
appeared not to see her. As she drew back some one staggered against her; an
angry scowl passed over her face, so savage and bitter that I felt quite
astonished. I should have been astonished, I mean, if I had not been able, by
that very change, to know again the restless eyes and grim set mouth of
Warrigal.</p>
<p>It was only a look, and he was gone. The lock creaked, the great iron door
swung back, and we were swallowed up in a tomb&mdash;a stone vault where men
are none the less buried because they have separate cells. They do not live,
though they appear to be alive; they move, and sometimes speak, and appear to
hear words. Some have to be sent away and buried outside. They have been dead a
long time, but have not seemed to want putting in the ground. That makes no
change in them&mdash;not much, I mean. If they sleep it's all right; if they
don't sleep anything must be happiness after the life they have escaped. 'Happy
are the dead' is written on all prison walls.</p>
<p>What I suffered in that first time no tongue can tell. I can't bear now to
think of it and put it down. The solitary part of it was enough to drive any
man mad that had been used to a free life. Day after day, night after night,
the same and the same and the same over again.</p>
<p>Then the dark cells. I got into them for a bit. I wasn't always as cool as I
might be&mdash;more times that mad with myself that I could have smashed my own
skull against the wall, let alone any one else's. There was one of the warders
I took a dislike to from the first, and he to me, I don't doubt. I thought he
was rough and surly. He thought I wanted to have my own way, and he made it up
to take it out of me, and run me every way he could. We had a goodish spell of
fighting over it, but he gave in at last. Not but what I'd had a lot to bear,
and took a deal of punishment before he jacked up. I needn't have had it. It
was all my own obstinacy and a sort of dogged feeling that made me feel I
couldn't give in. I believe it done me good, though. I do really think I should
have gone mad else, thinking of the dreadful long months and years that lay
before me without a chance of getting out.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'd take a low fit and refuse my food, and very near give up
living altogether. The least bit more, and I'd have died outright. One day
there was a party of ladies and gentlemen came to be shown over the gaol. There
was a lot of us passing into the exercise yard. I happened to look up for a
minute, and saw one of the ladies looking steadily at us, and oh! what a
pitying look there was in her face. In a moment I saw it was Miss Falkland,
and, by the change that came into her face, that she knew me again, altered as
I was. I wondered how she could have known me. I was a different-looking chap
from when she had seen me last. With a beastly yellow-gray suit of prison
clothes, his face scraped smooth every day, like a fresh-killed pig, and the
look of a free man gone out of his face for ever&mdash;how any woman, gentle or
simple, ever can know a man in gaol beats me. Whether or no, she knew me. I
suppose she saw the likeness to Jim, and she told him, true enough, she'd never
forget him nor what he'd done for her.</p>
<p>I just looked at her, and turned my head away. I felt as if I'd make a fool
of myself if I didn't. All the depth down that I'd fallen since I was shearing
there at Boree rushed into my mind at once. I nearly fell down, I know. I was
pretty weak and low then; I'd only just come out of the doctor's hands.</p>
<p>I was passing along with the rest of the mob. I heard her voice quite clear
and firm, but soft and sweet, too. How sweet it sounded to me then!</p>
<p>'I wish to speak a few words to the third prisoner in the line&mdash;the
tall one. Can I do so, Captain Wharton?'</p>
<p>'Oh! certainly, Miss Falkland,' said the old gentleman, who had brought them
all in to look at the wonderful neat garden, and the baths, and the hospital,
and the unnatural washed-up, swept-up barracks that make the cleanest gaol feel
worse than the roughest hut. He was the visiting magistrate, and took a deal of
interest in the place, and believed he knew all the prisoners like a book. 'Oh!
certainly, my dear young lady. Is Richard Marston an acquaintance of
yours?'</p>
<p>'He and his brother worked for my father at Boree,' she said, quite stately.
'His brother saved my life.'</p>
<p>I was called back by the warder. Miss Falkland stepped out before them all,
and shook hands with me. Yes, <i>she shook hands with me</i>, and the tears
came into her eyes as she did so.</p>
<p>If anything could have given a man's heart a turn the right way that would
have done it. I felt again as if some one cared for me in the world, as if I
had a soul worth saving. And people may talk as they like, but when a man has
the notion that everybody has given him up as a bad job, and has dropped
troubling themselves about him, he gets worse and worse, and meets the devil
half-way.</p>
<p>She said&mdash;</p>
<p>'Richard Marston, I cannot tell how grieved I am to see you here. Both papa
and I were so sorry to hear all about those Momberah cattle.'</p>
<p>I stammered out something or other, I hardly knew what.</p>
<p>She looked at me again with her great beautiful eyes like a wondering
child.</p>
<p>'Is your brother here too?'</p>
<p>'No, Miss Falkland,' I said. 'They've never caught Jim yet, and, what's
more, I don't think they will. He jumped on a bare-backed horse without saddle
or bridle, and got clear.'</p>
<p>She looked as if she was going to smile, but she didn't. I saw her eyes
sparkle, though, and she said softly&mdash;</p>
<p>'Poor Jim! so he got away; I am glad of that. What a wonderful rider he was!
But I suppose he will be caught some day. Oh, I do so wish I could say anything
that would make you repent of what you have done, and try and do better by and
by. Papa says you have a long life before you most likely, and might do so much
with it yet. You will try, for my sake; won't you now?'</p>
<p>'I'll do what I can, miss,' I said; 'and if I ever see Jim again I'll tell
him of your kindness.'</p>
<p>'Thank you, and good-bye,' she said, and she held out her hand again and
took mine. I walked away, but I couldn't help holding my head higher, and
feeling a different man, somehow.</p>
<p>I ain't much of a religious chap, wasn't then, and I am farther off it now
than ever, but I've heard a power of the Bible and all that read in my time;
and when the parson read out next Sunday about Jesus Christ dying for men, and
wanting to have their souls saved, I felt as if I could have a show of
understanding it better than I ever did before. If I'd been a Catholic, like
Aileen and mother, I should have settled what the Virgin Mary was like when she
was alive, and never said a prayer to her without thinking of Miss
Falkland.</p>
<p>While I was dying one week and getting over it another, and going through
all the misery every fellow has in his first year of gaol, Starlight was just
his old self all the time. He took it quite easy, never gave any one trouble,
and there wasn't a soul in the place that wouldn't have done anything for him.
The visiting magistrate thought his a most interesting case, and believed in
his heart that he had been the means of turning him from the error of his
ways&mdash;he and the chaplain between them, anyhow. He even helped him to be
allowed to be kept a little separate from the other prisoners (lest they should
contaminate him!), and in lots of ways made his life a bit easier to him.</p>
<p>It was reported about that it was not the first time that he had been in a
gaol. That he'd 'done time', as they call it, in another colony. He might or he
might not. He never said. And he wasn't the man, with all his soft ways, you'd
like to ask about such a thing.</p>
<p>By the look of it you wouldn't think he cared about it a bit. He took it
very easy, read half his time, and had no sign about him that he wasn't
perfectly satisfied. He intended when he got out to lead a new life, the
chaplain said, and be the means of keeping other men right and straight.</p>
<p>One day we had a chance of a word together. He got the soft side of the
chaplain, who thought he wanted to convert me and take me out of my sulky and
obstinate state of mind. He took good care that we were not overheard or
watched, and then said rather loud, for fear of accidents&mdash;</p>
<p>'Well, Richard, how are you feeling? I am happy to say that I have been led
to think seriously of my former evil ways, and I have made up my mind, besides,
to use every effort in my power to clear out of this infernal collection of
tombstones when the moon gets dark again, about the end of this month.'</p>
<p>'How have you taken to become religious?' I said. 'Are you quite sure that
what you say can be depended upon? And when did you get the good news?'</p>
<p>'I have had many doubts in my mind for a long time,' he said, 'and have
watched and prayed long, and listened for the word that was to come; and the
end of it is that I have at length heard the news that makes the soul rejoice,
even for the heathen, the boy Warrigal, who will be waiting outside these walls
with fresh horses. I must now leave you, my dear Richard,' he said; 'and I hope
my words will have made an impression on you. When I have more to communicate
for your good I will ask leave to return.'</p>
<p>After I heard this news I began to live again. Was there a chance of our
getting out of this terrible tomb into the free air and sunshine once more?
However it was to be managed I could not make out. I trusted mostly to
Starlight, who seemed to know everything, and to be quite easy about the way it
would all turn out.</p>
<p>All that I could get out of him afterwards was that on a certain night a man
would be waiting with two horses outside of the gaol wall; and that if we had
the luck to get out safe, and he thought we should, we would be on their backs
in three minutes, and all the police in New South Wales wouldn't catch us once
we got five minutes' start.</p>
<p>This was all very well if it came out right; but there was an awful lot to
be done before we were even near it. The more I began to think over it the
worse it looked; sometimes I quite lost heart, and believed we should never
have half a chance of carrying out our plan.</p>
<p>We knew from the other prisoners that men had tried from time to time to get
away. Three had been caught. One had been shot dead&mdash;he was
lucky&mdash;another had fallen off the wall and broke his leg. Two had got
clear off, and had never been heard of since.</p>
<p>We were all locked up in our cells every evening, and at five o'clock, too.
We didn't get out till six in the morning; a long, long time. Cold enough in
the bitter winter weather, that had then come in, and a long, weary, wretched
time to wait and watch for daylight.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, we had to get the cell door open. That was the easiest
part of the lot. There's always men in a big gaol that all kinds of keys and
locks are like large print to. They can make most locks fly open like magic;
what's more, they're willing to do it for anybody else, or show them how. It
keeps their hand in; they have a pleasure in spiting those above them whenever
they can do it.</p>
<p>The getting out of the cell was easy enough, but there was a lot of danger
after you had got out. A passage to cross, where the warder, with his rifle,
walked up and down every half-hour all night; then a big courtyard; then
another smaller door in the wall; then the outer yard for those prisoners who
are allowed to work at stone-cutting or out-of-door trades.</p>
<p>After all this there was the great outer wall to climb up and drop down from
on the other side.</p>
<p>We managed to pick our night well. A French convict, who liked that sort of
thing, gave me the means of undoing the cell door. It was three o'clock in the
morning, when in winter most people are sleepy that haven't much on their
minds. The warder that came down the passage wasn't likely to be asleep, but he
might have made it up in his mind that all was right, and not taken as much
notice as usual. This was what we trusted to. Besides, we had got a few
five-pound notes smuggled in to us; and though I wouldn't say that we were able
to bribe any of the gaolers, we didn't do ourselves any harm in one or two
little ways by throwing a few sovereigns about.</p>
<p>I did just as I was told by the Frenchman, and I opened the cell door as
easy as a wooden latch. I had to shut it again for fear the warder would see it
and begin to search and sound the alarm at once. Just as I'd done this he came
down the passage. I had only time to crouch down in the shadow when he passed
me. That was right; now he would not be back for half-an-hour.</p>
<p>I crawled and scrambled, and crept along like a snake until little by little
I got to the gate through the last wall but one. The lock here was not so easy
as the cell door, and took me more time. While I stood there I was in a regular
tremble with fright, thinking some one might come up, and all my chance would
be gone. After a bit the lock gave way, and I found myself in the outer yard. I
went over to the wall and crept along it till I came to one of the angles.
There I was to meet Starlight. He was not there, and he was to bring some
spikes to climb the wall with, and a rope, with two or three other things.</p>
<p>I waited and waited for half-an-hour, which seemed a month. What was I to do
if he didn't come? I could not climb the thirty-foot wall by myself. One had to
be cautious, too, for there were towers at short distances along the wall; in
every one of these a warder, armed with a rifle, which he was sure to empty at
any one that looked like gaol-breaking. I began to think he had made a mistake
in the night. Then, that he had been discovered and caught the moment he tried
to get out of the cell. I was sure to be caught if he was prevented from
coming; and shutting up would be harder to bear than ever.</p>
<p>Then I heard a man's step coming up softly; I knew it was Starlight. I knew
his step, and thought I would always tell it from a thousand other men's; it
was so light and firm, so quick and free. Even in a prison it was different
from other men's; and I remembered everything he had ever said about walking
and running, both of which he was wonderfully good at.</p>
<p>He was just as cool as ever. 'All right, Dick; take these spikes.' He had
half-a-dozen stout bits of iron; how ever he got them I know no more than the
dead, but there they were, and a light strong coil of rope as well. I knew what
the spikes were for, of course; to drive into the wall between the stones and
climb up by. With the rope we were to drop ourselves over the wall the other
side. It was thirty feet high&mdash;no fool of a drop. More than one man had
been picked up disabled at the bottom of it. He had a short stout piece of iron
that did to hammer the spikes in; and that had to be done very soft and quiet,
you may be sure.</p>
<p>It took a long time. I thought the night would be over and the daylight come
before it was all done; it was so slow. I could hear the tick-tack of his iron
every time he knocked one of the spikes in. Of course he went higher every
time. They were just far enough apart for a man to get his foot on from one to
another. As he went up he had one end of the coil of the rope round his wrist.
When he got to the top he was to draw it up to fasten to the top spike, and
lower himself down by it to the ground on the other side. At last I felt him
pull hard on the rope. I held it, and put my foot on the first spike. I don't
know that I should have found it so very easy in the dark to get up by the
spikes&mdash;it was almost blackfellows' work, when they put their big toe into
a notch cut in the smooth stem of a gum tree that runs a hundred feet without a
branch, and climb up the outside of it&mdash;but Jim and I had often practised
this sort of climbing when we were boys, and were both pretty good at it. As
for Starlight, he had been to sea when he was young, and could climb like a
cat.</p>
<p>When I got to the top I could just see his head above the wall. The rope was
fastened well to the top spike, which was driven almost to the head into the
wall. Directly he saw me, he began to lower himself down the rope, and was out
of sight in a minute. I wasn't long after him, you may be sure. In my hurry I
let the rope slip through my hands so fast they were sore for a week
afterwards. But I didn't feel it then. I should hardly have felt it if I had
cut them in two, for as my feet touched the ground in the darkness I heard the
stamp of a horse's hoof and the jingle of a bit&mdash;not much of a sound, but
it went through my heart like a knife, along with the thought that I was a free
man once more; that is, free in a manner of speaking. I knew we couldn't be
taken then, bar accidents, and I felt ready to ride through a regiment of
soldiers.</p>
<p>As I stood up a man caught my hand and gave it a squeeze as if he'd have
crushed my fingers in. I knew it was Jim. Of course, I'd expected him to be
there, but wasn't sure if he'd be able to work it. We didn't speak, but started
to walk over to where two horses were standing, with a man holding 'em. It was
pretty dark, but I could see Rainbow's star&mdash;just in his forehead it
was&mdash;the only white he had about him. Of course it was Warrigal that was
holding them.</p>
<p>'We must double-bank my horse,' whispers Jim, 'for a mile or two, till we're
clear of the place; we didn't want to bring a lot of horses about.'</p>
<p>He jumped up, and I mounted behind him. Starlight was on Rainbow in a
second. The half-caste disappeared, he was going to keep dark for a few days
and send us the news. Jim's horse went off as if he had only ten stone on his
back instead of pretty nigh five-and-twenty. And we were free! Lord God! to
think that men can be such fools as ever to do anything of their own free will
and guiding that puts their liberty in danger when there's such a world outside
of a gaol wall&mdash;such a heaven on earth as long as a man's young and
strong, and has all the feelings of a free man, in a country like this. Would I
do the first crooked thing again if I had my life to live over again, and knew
a hundredth part of what I know now? Would I put my hand in the fire out of
laziness or greed? or sit still and let a snake sting me, knowing I should be
dead in twelve hours? Any man's fool enough to do one that'll do the other. Men
and women don't know this in time, that's the worst of it; they won't believe
half they're told by them that do know and wish 'em well. They run on heedless
and obstinate, too proud to take advice, till they do as we did. The world's
always been the same, I suppose, and will to the end. Most of the books say so,
anyway.</p>
<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<p>What a different feel from prison air the fresh night breeze had as we swept
along a lonely outside track! The stars were out, though the sky was cloudy now
and then, and the big forest trees looked strange in the broken light. It was
so long since I'd seen any. I felt as if I was going to a new world. None of us
spoke for a bit. Jim pulled up at a small hut by the roadside; it looked like a
farm, but there was not much show of crops or anything about the place. There
was a tumble-down old barn, with a strong door to it, and a padlock; it seemed
the only building that there was any care taken about. A man opened the door of
the hut and looked out.</p>
<p>'Look sharp,' says Jim. 'Is the horse all right and fit?'</p>
<p>'Fit enough to go for the Hawkesbury Guineas. I was up and fed him three
hours ago. He's &mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Bring him out, and be hanged to you,' says Jim; 'we've no time for
chat.'</p>
<p>The man went straight to the barn, and after a minute or two brought out a
horse&mdash;the same I'd ridden from Gippsland, saddled and bridled, and ready
to jump out of his skin. Jim leaned forward and put something into his hand,
which pleased him, for he held my rein and stirrup, and then said&mdash;</p>
<p>'Good luck and a long reign to you,' as we rode away.</p>
<p>All this time Starlight had sat on his horse in the shade of a tree a good
bit away. When we started he rode alongside of us. We were soon in a pretty
fair hand-gallop, and we kept it up. All our horses were good, and we bowled
along as if we were going to ride for a week without stopping.</p>
<p>What a ride it was! It was a grand night, anyway I thought so. I blessed the
stars, I know. Mile after mile, and still the horses seemed to go all the
fresher the farther they went. I felt I could ride on that way for ever. As the
horses pulled and snorted and snatched at their bridles I felt as happy as ever
I did in my life. Mile after mile it was all the same; we could hear Rainbow
snorting from time to time and see his star move as he tossed up his head. We
had many a night ride after together, but that was the best. We had laid it out
to make for a place we knew not so far from home. We dursn't go there straight,
of course, but nigh enough to make a dart to it whenever we had word that the
coast was clear.</p>
<p>We knew directly we were missed the whole countryside would be turned out
looking for us, and that every trooper within a hundred miles would be hoping
for promotion in case he was lucky enough to drop on either of the Marstons or
the notorious Starlight. His name had been pretty well in every one's mouth
before, and would be a little more before they were done with him.</p>
<p>It was too far to ride to the Hollow in a day, but Jim had got a place ready
for us to keep dark in for a bit, in case we got clear off. There's never any
great trouble in us chaps finding a home for a week or two, and somebody to
help us on our way as long as we've the notes to chuck about. All the worse in
the long run. We rode hardish (some people would have called it a hand-gallop)
most of the way; up hill and down, across the rocky creeks, through thick
timber. More than one river we had to swim. It was mountain water, and
Starlight cursed and swore, and said he would catch his death of cold. Then we
all laughed; it was the first time we'd done that since we were out. My heart
was too full to talk, much less laugh, with the thought of being out of that
cursed prison and on my own horse again, with the free bush breeze filling my
breast, and the free forest I'd lived in all my life once more around me. I
felt like a king, and as for what might come afterwards I had no more thought
than a schoolboy has of his next year's lessons at the beginning of his
holidays. It might come now. As I took the old horse by the head and raced him
down the mountain side, I felt I was living again and might call myself a man
once more.</p>
<p>The sun was just rising, the morning was misty and drizzling; the long
sour-grass, the branches of the scrubby trees, everything we touched and saw
was dripping with the night dew, as we rode up a 'gap' between two stiffish
hills. We had been riding all night from track to track, sometimes steering by
guesswork. Jim seemed to know the country in a general way, and he told us
father and he had been about there a good deal lately, cattle-dealing and so
on. For the last hour or so we had been on a pretty fair beaten road, though
there wasn't much traffic on it. It was one of the old mail tracks once, but
new coach lines had knocked away all the traffic. Some of the old inns had been
good big houses, well kept and looked after then. Now lots of them were empty,
with broken windows and everything in ruins; others were just good enough to
let to people who would live in them, and make a living by cultivating a bit
and selling grog on the sly. Where we pulled up was one of these places, and
the people were just what you might expect.</p>
<p>First of all there was the man of the house, Jonathan Barnes, a tall,
slouching, flash-looking native; he'd been a little in the horse-racing line, a
little in the prize-fighting line&mdash;enough to have his nose broken, and was
fond of talking about 'pugs' as he'd known intimate&mdash;a little in the
farming and carrying line, a little in every line that meant a good deal of
gassing, drinking, and idling, and mighty little hard work. He'd a decent,
industrious little wife, about forty times too good for him, and the girls,
Bella and Maddie, worked well, or else he'd have been walking about the country
with a swag on his back. They kept him and the house too, like many another
man, and he took all the credit of it, and ordered them about as if he'd been
the best and straightest man in the land. If he made a few pounds now and then
he'd drop it on a horse-race before he'd had it a week. They were glad enough
to see us, anyhow, and made us comfortable, after a fashion. Jim had brought
fresh clothes, and both of us had stopped on the road and rigged ourselves out,
so that we didn't look so queer as men just out of the jug mostly do, with
their close-shaved faces, cropped heads, and prison clothes. Starlight had
brought a false moustache with him, which he stuck on, so that he looked as
much like a swell as ever. Warrigal had handed him a small parcel, which he
brought with him, just as we started; and, with a ring on his finger, some
notes and gold in his pocket, he ate his breakfast, and chatted away with the
girls as if he'd only ridden out for a day to have a look at the country.</p>
<p>Our horses were put in the stable and well looked to, you may be sure. The
man that straps a cross cove's horse don't go short of his half-crown&mdash;two
or three of them, maybe. We made a first-rate breakfast of it; what with the
cold and the wet and not being used to riding lately, we were pretty hungry,
and tired too. We intended to camp there that day, and be off again as soon as
it was dark.</p>
<p>Of course we ran a bit of a risk, but not as bad as we should by riding in
broad daylight. The hills on the south were wild and rangy enough, but there
were all sorts of people about on their business in the daytime; and of course
any of them would know with one look that three men, all on well-bred horses,
riding right across country and not stopping to speak or make free with any
one, were likely to be 'on the cross'&mdash;all the more if the police were
making particular inquiries about them. We were all armed, too, now. Jim had
seen to that. If we were caught, we intended to have a flutter for it. We were
not going back to Berrima if we knew it.</p>
<p>So we turned in, and slept as if we were never going to wake again. We'd had
a glass of grog or two, nothing to hurt, though; and the food and one thing and
another made us sleep like tops. Jim was to keep a good look-out, and we didn't
take off our clothes. Our horses were kept saddled, too, with the bridles on
their heads, and only the bits out of their mouths&mdash;we could have managed
without the bits at a pinch&mdash;everything ready to be out of the house in
one minute, and in saddle and off full-split the next. We were learned that
trick pretty well before things came to an end.</p>
<p>Besides that, Jonathan kept a good look-out, too, for strangers of the wrong
sort. It wasn't a bad place in that way. There was a long stony track coming
down to the house, and you could see a horseman or a carriage of any kind
nearly a mile off. Then, in the old times, the timber had been cleared pretty
nigh all round the place, so there was no chance of any one sneaking up unknown
to people. There couldn't have been a better harbour for our sort, and many a
jolly spree we had there afterwards. Many a queer sight that old table in the
little parlour saw years after, and the notes and gold and watches and rings
and things I've seen the girls handling would have stunned you. But that was
all to come.</p>
<p>Well, about an hour before dark Jim wakes us up, and we both felt as right
as the bank. It took a good deal to knock either of us out of time in those
days. I looked round for a bit and then burst out laughing.</p>
<p>'What's that about, Dick?' says Jim, rather serious.</p>
<p>'Blest if I didn't think I was in the thundering old cell again,' I said. 'I
could have sworn I heard the bolt snap as your foot sounded in the room.'</p>
<p>'Well, I hope we shan't, any of us, be shopped again for a while,' says he,
rather slow like. 'It's bad work, I'm afraid, and worse to come; but we're in
it up to our neck and must see it out. We'll have another feed and be off at
sundown. We've the devil's own ride before daylight.'</p>
<p>'Anybody called?' says Starlight, sauntering in, washed and dressed and
comfortable-looking. 'You told them we were not at home, Jim, I hope.'</p>
<p>Jim smiled in spite of himself, though he wasn't in a very gay humour. Poor
old Jim was looking ahead a bit, I expect, and didn't see anything much to be
proud of.</p>
<p>We had a scrumptious feed that night, beefsteaks and eggs, fresh butter and
milk, things we hadn't smelt for months. Then the girls waited on us; a
good-looking pair they was too, full of larks and fun of all kinds, and not
very particular what sort of jokes they laughed at. They knew well enough, of
course, where we'd come from, and what we laid by all day and travelled at
night for; they thought none the worse of us for that, not they. They'd been
bred up where they'd heard all kinds of rough talk ever since they was little
kiddies, and you couldn't well put them out.</p>
<p>They were a bit afraid of Starlight at first, though, because they seen at
once that he was a swell. Jim they knew a little of; he and father had called
there a good deal the last season, and had done a little in the stock line
through Jonathan Barnes. They could see I was something in the same line as
Jim. So I suppose they had made it up to have a bit of fun with us that evening
before we started. They came down into the parlour where our tea was, dressed
out in their best and looking very grand, as I thought, particularly as we
hadn't seen the sight of so much as a woman's bonnet and shawl for months and
months.</p>
<p>'Well, Mr. Marston,' says the eldest girl, Bella, to Jim, 'we didn't expect
you'd travel this way with friends so soon. Why didn't you tell us, and we'd
have had everything comfortable?'</p>
<p>'Wasn't sure about it,' says Jim, 'and when you ain't it's safest to hold
your tongue. There's a good many things we all do that don't want talking
about.'</p>
<p>'I feel certain, Jim,' says Starlight, with his soft voice and pleasant
smile, which no woman as I ever saw could fight against long, 'that any man's
secret would be safe with Miss Bella. I would trust her with my life
freely&mdash;not that it's worth a great deal.'</p>
<p>'Oh! Captain,' says poor Bella, and she began to blush quite innocent like,
'you needn't fear; there ain't a girl from Shoalhaven to Albury that would let
on which way you were heading, if they were to offer her all the money in the
country.'</p>
<p>'Not even a diamond necklace and earrings? Think of a lovely pendant, a
cross all brilliants, and a brooch to match, my dear girl.'</p>
<p>'I wouldn't "come it", unless I could get that lovely horse of yours,' says
the youngest one, Maddie; 'but I'd do anything in the world to have him. He's
the greatest darling I ever saw. Wouldn't he look stunning with a side-saddle?
I've a great mind to "duff" him myself one of these days.'</p>
<p>'You shall have a ride on Rainbow next time we come,' says Starlight. 'I've
sworn never to give him away or sell him, that is as long as I'm alive; but
I'll tell you what I'll do&mdash;I'll leave him to you in my will.'</p>
<p>'How do you mean?' says she, quite excited like.</p>
<p>'Why, if I drop one of these fine days&mdash;and it's on the cards any
time&mdash;you shall have Rainbow; but, mind now, you're to promise
me'&mdash;here he looked very grave&mdash;'that you'll neither sell him, nor
lend him, nor give him away as long as you live.'</p>
<p>'Oh! you don't mean it,' says the girl, jumping up and clapping her hands;
'I'd sooner have him than anything I ever saw in the world. Oh! I'll take such
care of him. I'll feed him and rub him over myself; only I forgot, I'm not to
have him before you're dead. It's rather rough on you, isn't it?'</p>
<p>'Not a bit,' says Starlight; 'we must all go when our time comes. If
anything happens to me soon he'll be young enough to carry you for years yet.
And you'll win all the ladies' hackney prizes at the shows.'</p>
<p>'Oh! I couldn't take him.'</p>
<p>'But you must now. I've promised him to you, and though I am
a&mdash;well&mdash;an indifferent character, I never go back on my word.'</p>
<p>'Haven't you anything to give me, Captain?' says Bella; 'you're in such a
generous mind.'</p>
<p>'I must bring you something,' says he, 'next time we call. What shall it be?
Now's the time to ask. I'm like the fellow in the "Arabian Nights", the slave
of the ring&mdash;your ring.' Here he took the girl's hand, and pretending to
look at a ring she wore took it up and kissed it. It wasn't a very ugly one
neither. 'What will you have, Bella?'</p>
<p>'I'd like a watch and chain,' she said, pretending to look a little
offended. 'I suppose I may as well ask for a good thing at once.'</p>
<p>Starlight pulled out a pocket-book, and, quite solemn and regular, made a
note of it.</p>
<p>'It's yours,' he said, 'within a month. If I cannot conveniently call and
present it in person, I'll send it by a sure hand, as they used to say; and
now, Jim, boot and saddle.'</p>
<p>The horses were out by this time; the groom was walking Rainbow up and down;
he'd put a regular French-polish on his coat, and the old horse was arching his
neck and chawing his bit as if he thought he was going to start for the Bargo
Town Plate. Jonathan himself was holding our two horses, but looking at
him.</p>
<p>'My word!' he said, 'that's a real picture of a horse; he's too good for
a&mdash;well&mdash;these roads; he ought to be in Sydney carrying some swell
about and never knowing what a day's hardship feels like. Isn't he a regular
out-and-outer to look at? And they tell me his looks is about the worst of him.
Well&mdash;here's luck!' Starlight had called for drinks all round before we
started. 'Here's luck to roads and coaches, and them as lives by 'em. They'll
miss the old coaching system some day&mdash;mark my word. I don't hold with
these railways they're talkin' about&mdash;all steam and hurry-scurry; it
starves the country.'</p>
<p>'Quite right, Jonathan,' says Starlight, throwing his leg over Rainbow, and
chucking the old groom a sovereign. 'The times have never been half as good as
in the old coaching days, before we ever smelt a funnel in New South Wales. But
there's a coach or two left yet, isn't there? and sometimes they're worth
attending to.'</p>
<p>He bowed and smiled to the girls, and Rainbow sailed off with his beautiful
easy, springy stride. He always put me in mind of the deer I once saw at
Mulgoa, near Penrith; I'd never seen any before. My word! how one of them
sailed over a farmer's wheat paddock fence. He'd been in there all night, and
when he saw us coming he just up and made for the fence, and flew it like a
bird. I never saw any horse have the same action, only Rainbow. You couldn't
tire him, and he was just the same the end of the day as the beginning. If he
hadn't fallen into Starlight's hands as a colt he'd have been a second-class
racehorse, and wore out his life among touts and ringmen. He was better where
he was. Off we went; what a ride we had that night! Just as well we'd fed and
rested before we started, else we should never have held out. All that night
long we had to go, and keep going. A deal of the road was rough&mdash;near the
Shoalhaven country, across awful deep gullies with a regular climb-up the other
side, like the side of a house. Through dismal ironbark forests that looked as
black by night as if all the tree-trunks were cast-iron and the leaves
gun-metal. The night wasn't as dark as it might have been, but now and again
there was a storm, and the whole sky turned as black as a wolf's throat, as
father used to say. We got a few knocks and scrapes against the trees, but,
partly through the horses being pretty clever in their kind of way, and having
sharpish eyesight of our own, we pulled through. It's no use talking, sometimes
I thought Jim must lose his way. Starlight told us he'd made up his mind that
we were going round and round, and would fetch up about where we'd started
from, and find the Moss Vale police waiting there for us.</p>
<p>'All right, Captain,' says Jim; 'don't you flurry yourself. I've been along
this track pretty often this last few months, and I can steer by the stars.
Look at the Southern Cross there; you keep him somewhere on the right shoulder,
and you'll pull up not so very far off that black range above old Rocky
Flat.'</p>
<p>'You're not going to be so mad as to call at your own place, Jim, are you?'
says he. 'Goring's sure to have a greyhound or two ready to slip in case the
hare makes for her old form.'</p>
<p>'Trust old dad for that,' says Jim; 'he knows Dick and you are on the grass
again. He'll meet us before we get to the place and have fresh horses. I'll bet
he's got a chap or two that he can trust to smell out the traps if they are
close handy the old spot. They'll be mighty clever if they get on the blind
side of father.'</p>
<p>'Well, we must chance it, I suppose,' I said; 'but we were sold once, and
I've not much fancy for going back again.'</p>
<p>'They're all looking for you the other way this blessed minute, I'll go
bail,' says Jim. 'Most of the coves that bolt from Berrima takes down the
southern road to get across the border into Port Philip as soon as they can
work it. They always fancy they are safer there.'</p>
<p>'So they are in some ways; I wouldn't mind if we were back there again,' I
said. 'There's worse places than Melbourne; but once we get to the Hollow, and
that'll be some time to-day, we may take it easy and spell for a week or two.
How they'll wonder what the deuce has become of us.'</p>
<p>The night was long, and that cold that Jim's beard was froze as stiff as a
board; but I sat on my horse, I declare to heaven, and never felt anything but
pleasure and comfort to think I was loose again. You've seen a dog that's been
chained up. Well, when he's let loose, don't he go chevying and racing about
over everything and into everything that's next or anigh him? He'll jump into
water or over a fence, and turn aside for nothing. He's mad with joy and the
feeling of being off the chain; he can't hardly keep from barking till he's
hoarse, and rushing through and over everything till he's winded and done up.
Then he lies down with his tongue out and considers it all over.</p>
<p>Well a man's just like that when he's been on the chain. He mayn't jump
about so much, though I've seen foreign fellows do that when their collar was
unbuckled; but he feels the very same things in his heart as that dog does, you
take my word for it.</p>
<p>So, as I said, though I was sitting on a horse all that long cold winter's
night through, and had to mind my eye a bit for the road and the rocks and the
hanging branches, I felt my heart swell that much and my courage rise that I
didn't care whether the night was going to turn into a snowstorm like we'd been
in Kiandra way, or whether we'd have a dozen rivers to swim, like the
head-waters of the M'Alister, in Gippsland, as nearly drowned the pair of us.
There I sat in my saddle like a man in a dream, lettin' my horse follow Jim's
up hill and down dale, and half the time lettin' go his head and givin' him his
own road. Everything, too, I seemed to notice and to be pleased with somehow.
Sometimes it was a rock wallaby out on the feed that we'd come close on before
we saw one another, and it would jump away almost under the horse's neck,
taking two or three awful long springs and lighting square and level among the
rocks after a drop-leap of a dozen feet, like a cat jumping out of a window.
But the cat's got four legs to balance on and the kangaroo only two. How they
manage it and measure the distance so well, God only knows. Then an old 'possum
would sing out, or a black-furred flying squirrel&mdash;pongos, the blacks call
'em&mdash;would come sailing down from the top of an ironbark tree, with all
his stern sails spread, as the sailors say, and into the branches of another,
looking as big as an eagle-hawk. And then we'd come round the corner of a
little creek flat and be into the middle of a mob of wild horses that had come
down from the mountain to feed at night. How they'd scurry off through the
scrub and up the range, where it was like the side of a house, and that full of
slate-bars all upon edge that you could smell the hoofs of the brumbies as the
sharp stones rasped and tore and struck sparks out of them like you do the
parings in a blacksmith's shop.</p>
<p>Then, just as I thought daybreak was near, a great mopoke flits close over
our heads without any rustling or noise, like the ghost of a bird, and begins
to hoot in a big, bare, hollow tree just ahead of us. Hoo-hoo! hoo-hoo! The
last time I heard it, it made me shiver a bit. Now I didn't care. I was a
desperate man that had done bad things, and was likely to do worse. But I was
free of the forest again, and had a good horse under me; so I laughed at the
bird and rode on.</p>
<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<p>Daylight broke when we were close up to the Black Range, safe enough, a
little off the line but nothing to signify. Then we hit off the track that led
over the Gap and down into a little flat on a creek that ran the same way as
ours did.</p>
<p>Jim had managed for father and Warrigal to meet us somewhere near here with
fresh horses. There was an old shepherd's hut that stood by itself almost
covered with marsh-mallows and nettles. As we came down the steep track a dog
came up snuffing and searching about the grass and stones as if he'd lost
something. It was Crib.</p>
<p>'Now we're getting home, Jim,' says Starlight. 'It's quite a treat to see
the old scamp again. Well, old man,' he says to the dog, 'how's all getting on
at the Hollow?' The dog came right up to Rainbow and rubbed against his
fetlock, and jumped up two or three times to see if he could touch his rider.
He was almost going to bark, he seemed that glad to see him and us.</p>
<p>Dad was sitting on a log by the hut smoking, just the same as he was before
he left us last time. He was holding two fresh horses, and we were not sorry to
see them. Horses are horses, and there wasn't much left in our two. We must
have ridden a good eighty miles that night, and it was as bad as a hundred by
daylight.</p>
<p>Father came a step towards us as we jumped off. By George, I was that stiff
with the long ride and the cold that I nearly fell down. He'd got a bit of a
fire, so we lit our pipes and had a comfortable smoke.</p>
<p>'Well, Dick, you're back agin, I see,' he says, pretty pleasant for him.
'Glad to see you, Captain, once more. It's been lonesome work&mdash;nobody but
me and Jim and Warrigal, that's like a bear with a sore head half his time. I'd
a mind to roll into him once or twice, and I should too only for his being your
property like.'</p>
<p>'Thank you, Ben, I'll knock his head off myself as soon as we get settled a
bit. Warrigal's not a bad boy, but a good deal like a Rocky Mountain mule; he's
no good unless he's knocked down about once a month or so, only he doesn't like
any one but me to do it.'</p>
<p>'You'll see him about a mile on,' says father. 'He told me he'd be behind
the big rock where the tree grows&mdash;on the left of the road. He said he'd
get you a fresh horse, so as he could take Rainbow back to the Hollow the long
way round.'</p>
<p>Sure enough after we'd just got well on the road again Warrigal comes
quietly out from behind a big granite boulder and shows himself. He was riding
Bilbah, and leading a well-bred, good-looking chestnut. He was one of the young
ones out of the Hollow. He'd broken him and got him quiet. I remembered when I
was there first spotting him as a yearling. I knew the blaze down his face and
his three white legs.</p>
<p>Warrigal jumps off Bilbah and throws down the bridle. Then he leads the
chestnut up to where Starlight was standing smoking, and throws himself down at
his feet, bursting out crying like a child. He was just like a dog that had
found his master again. He kept looking up at Starlight just like a dog does,
and smiling and going on just as if he never expected to see such a good thing
again as long as he lived.</p>
<p>'Well, Warrigal,' says Starlight, very careless like, 'so you've brought me
a horse, I see. You've been a very good boy. Take Rainbow round the long way
into the Hollow. Look after him, whatever you do, or I'll murder you. Not that
he's done, or anything near it; but had enough for one ride, poor old man. Off
with you!' He changed the saddle, and Warrigal hopped on to Bilbah, and led off
Rainbow, who tossed his head, and trotted away as if he'd lots to spare, and
hadn't had twelve hours under saddle; best part without a halt or a bait. I've
seen a few good 'uns in my time, but I never saw the horse that was a patch on
Rainbow, take him all round.</p>
<p>We pushed on again, then, for ten miles, and somewhere about eight o'clock
we pulled up at home&mdash;at home. Aileen knew we were coming, and ran out to
meet us. She threw her arms round me, and kissed and cried over me for ever so
long before she took any notice of Starlight, who'd got down and was looking
another way. 'Oh! my boy, my boy,' she said, 'I never thought to see you again
for years. How thin you've got and pale, and strange looking. You're not like
your old self at all. But you're in the bush again now, by God's blessing. We
must hide you better next time. I declare I begin to feel quite wicked, and as
if I could fight the police myself.'</p>
<p>'Well spoken, Miss Marston,' said Starlight, just lifting his hat and making
a bit of a bow like, just as if she was a real lady; but he was the same to all
women. He treated them all alike with the same respect of manner as if they
were duchesses; young or old, gentle or simple&mdash;it made no odds to him.
'We must have your assistance if we're to do any good. Though whether it
wouldn't be more prudent on your part to cut us all dead, beginning with your
father, I shouldn't like to say.'</p>
<p>Aileen looked at him, surprised and angry like for a second. Then she
says&mdash;</p>
<p>'Captain Starlight, it's too late now; but words can never tell how I hate
and despise the whole thing. My love for Dick got the better of my reason for a
bit, but I could&mdash;Why, how pale you look!'</p>
<p>He was growing pale, and no mistake. He had been ill for a bit before he
left Berrima, though he wouldn't give in, and the ride was rather too much for
him, I suppose. Anyhow, down he tumbles in a dead faint. Aileen rushed over and
lifted up his head. I got some water and dabbed it over him. After a bit he
came to. He raises himself on his elbows and looks at Aileen. Then he smiles
quietly and says&mdash;</p>
<p>'I'm quite ashamed of myself. I'm growing as delicate as a young lady. I
hope I haven't given you much trouble.'</p>
<p>When he got up and walked to the verandah he quite staggered, showing he was
that weak as he could hardly walk without help.</p>
<p>'I shall be all right,' he said, 'after a week's riding again.'</p>
<p>'And where are you going when you leave this place?' she asked. 'Surely you
and my brothers never can live in New South Wales after all that has
passed.'</p>
<p>'We must try, at all events, Miss Marston,' Starlight answered, raising up
his head and looking proud. 'You will hear something of us before long.'</p>
<p>We made out that there was no great chance of our being run into at the old
place. Father went on first with Crib. He was sure to give warning in some way,
best known to father himself, if there was any one about that wasn't the right
sort. So we went up and went in.</p>
<p>Mother was inside. I thought it was queer that she didn't come outside. She
was always quick enough about that when we came home before, day or night. When
I went in I could see, when she got up from her chair, that she was weak, and
looked as if she'd been ill. She looked ever so much older, and her hair was a
lot grayer than it used to be.</p>
<p>She held out her arms and clung round my neck as if I'd been raised from the
dead. So I was in a kind of a way. But she didn't say much, or ask what I was
going to do next. Poor soul! she knew it couldn't be much good anyway; and that
if we were hunted before, we'd be worse hunted now. Those that hadn't heard of
our little game with the Momberah cattle would hear of our getting out of
Berrima Gaol, which wasn't done every day.</p>
<p>We hadn't a deal of time to spare, because we meant to start off for the
Hollow that afternoon, and get there some time in the night, even if it was
late. Jim and dad knew the way in almost blindfold. Once we got there we could
sleep for a week if we liked, and take it easy all roads. So father told mother
and Aileen straight that we'd come for a good comfortable meal and a rest, and
we must be off again.</p>
<p>'Oh! father, can't Dick and Jim stop for a day?' cries out Aileen. 'It does
seem so hard when we haven't seen Dick for such a while; and he shut up too all
the time.'</p>
<p>'D'ye want to have us all took the same as last time?' growls father.
'Women's never contented as I can see. For two pins I wouldn't have brought
them this way at all. I don't want to be making roads from this old crib to the
Hollow, only I thought you'd like one look at Dick.'</p>
<p>'We must do what's best, of course,' said poor Aileen; 'but it's
hard&mdash;very hard on us. It's mother I'm thinking of, you know. If you knew
how she always wakes up in the night, and calls for Dick, and cries when she
wakes up, you'd try to comfort her a bit more, father.'</p>
<p>'Comfort her!' says dad; 'why, what can I do? Don't I tell you if we stay
about here we're shopped as safe as anything ever was? Will that comfort her,
or you either? We're safe today because I've got telegraphs on the outside that
the police can't pass without ringing the bell&mdash;in a way of speaking. But
you see to-morrow there'll be more than one lot here, and I want to be clean
away before they come.'</p>
<p>'You know best,' says Aileen; 'but suppose they come here to-morrow morning
at daylight, as they did last time, and bring a black tracker with them, won't
he be able to follow up your track when you go away to-night?'</p>
<p>'No, he won't; for this reason, we shall all ride different ways as soon as
we leave here. A good while before we get near the place where we all meet we
shall find Warrigal on the look-out. He can take the Captain in by another
track, and there'll be only Jim and I and the old dog, the only three persons
that'll go in the near way.'</p>
<p>'And when shall we see&mdash;see&mdash;any of you again?'</p>
<p>'Somewheres about a month, I suppose, if we've luck. There's a deal belongs
to that. You'd better go and see what there is for us to eat. We've a long way
and a rough way to go before we get to the Hollow.'</p>
<p>Aileen was off at this, and then she set to work and laid a clean tablecloth
in the sitting-room and set us down our meal&mdash;breakfast, or whatever it
was. It wasn't so bad&mdash;corned beef, first-rate potatoes, fresh damper,
milk, butter, eggs. Tea, of course, it's the great drink in the bush; and
although some doctors say it's no good, what would bushmen do without it?</p>
<p>We had no intention of stopping the whole night, though we were tempted to
do so&mdash;to have one night's rest in the old place where we used to sleep so
sound before. It was no good thinking of anything of that kind, anyhow, for a
good while to come. What we'd got to do was to look out sharp and not be caught
simple again like we was both last time.</p>
<p>After we had our tea we sat outside the verandah, and tried to make the best
of it. Jim stayed inside with mother for a good while; she didn't leave her
chair much now, and sat knitting by the hour together. There was a great change
come over her lately. She didn't seem to be afraid of our getting caught as she
used to be, nor half as glad or sorry about anything. It seemed like as if
she'd made up her mind that everything was as bad as it could be, and past
mending. So it was; she was right enough there. The only one who was in real
good heart and spirits was Starlight. He'd come round again, and talked and
rattled away, and made Aileen and Jim and me laugh, in spite of everything. He
said we had all fine times before us now for a year or two, any way. That was a
good long time. After that anything might happen. What it would be he neither
knew nor cared. Life was made up of short bits; sometimes it was hard luck;
sometimes everything went jolly and well. We'd got our liberty again, our
horses, and a place to go to, where all the police in the country would never
find us. He was going in for a short life and a merry one. He, for one, was
tired of small adventures, and he was determined to make the name of Starlight
a little more famous before very long. If Dick and Jim would take his
advice&mdash;the advice of a desperate, ill-fated outcast, but still staunch to
his friends&mdash;they would clear out, and leave him to sink or swim alone, or
with such associates as he might pick up, whose destination would be no great
matter whatever befell them. They could go into hiding for a while&mdash;make
for Queensland and then go into the northern territory. There was new country
enough there to hide all the fellows that were 'wanted' in New South Wales.</p>
<p>'But why don't you take your own advice?' said Aileen, looking over at
Starlight as he sat there quite careless and comfortable-looking, as if he'd no
call to trouble his head about anything. 'Isn't your life worth mending or
saving? Why keep on this reckless miserable career which you yourself expect to
end ill?'</p>
<p>'If you ask me, Miss Marston,' he said, 'whether my life&mdash;what is left
of it&mdash;is worth saving, I must distinctly answer that it is not. It is
like the last coin or two in the gambler's purse, not worth troubling one's
head about. It must be flung on the board with the rest. It might land a
reasonable stake. But as to economising and arranging details that would surely
be the greatest folly of all.'</p>
<p>I heard Aileen sigh to herself. She said nothing for a while; and then old
Crib began to growl. He got up and walked along the track that led up the hill.
Father stood up, too, and listened. We all did except Starlight, who appeared
to think it was too much trouble, and never moved or seemed to notice.</p>
<p>Presently the dog came walking slowly back, and coiled himself up again
close to Starlight, as if he had made up his mind it didn't matter. We could
hear a horse coming along at a pretty good bat over the hard, rocky, gravelly
road. We could tell it was a single horse, and more than that, a barefooted
one, coming at a hand-gallop up hill and down dale in a careless kind of
manner. This wasn't likely to be a police trooper. One man wouldn't come by
himself to a place like ours at night; and no trooper, if he did come, would
clatter along a hard track, making row enough to be heard more than a mile off
on a quiet night.</p>
<p>'It's all right,' says father. 'The old dog knowed him; it's Billy the Boy.
There's something up.'</p>
<p>Just as he spoke we saw a horseman come in sight; and he rattled down the
stony track as hard as he could lick. He pulled up just opposite the house,
close by where we were standing. It was a boy about fifteen, dressed in a
ragged pair of moleskin trousers, a good deal too large for him, but kept
straight by a leather strap round the waist. An old cabbage-tree hat and a blue
serge shirt made up the rest of his rig. Boots he had on, but they didn't seem
to be fellows, and one rusty spur. His hair was like a hay-coloured mop,
half-hanging over his eyes, which looked sharp enough to see through a gum tree
and out at the other side.</p>
<p>He jumped down and stood before us, while his horse's flanks heaved up and
down like a pair of bellows.</p>
<p>'Well, what's up?' says father.</p>
<p>'My word, governor, you was all in great luck as I come home last night,
after bein' away with them cattle to pound. Bobby, he don't know a p'leeceman
from a wood-an'-water joey; he'd never have dropped they was comin' here unless
they'd pasted up a notice on the door.'</p>
<p>'How did you find out, Billy?' says father, 'and when'll they be here?'</p>
<p>'Fust thing in the morning,' says the young wit, grinning all over his face.
'Won't they be jolly well sold when they rides up and plants by the yard, same
as they did last time, when they took Dick.'</p>
<p>'Which ones was they?' asks father, fillin' his pipe quite business-like,
just as if he'd got days to spare.</p>
<p>'Them two fellers from Bargo; one of 'em's a new chum&mdash;got his hair cut
short, just like Dick's. My word, I thought he'd been waggin' it from some o'
them Gov'ment institoosh'ns. I did raly, Dick, old man.'</p>
<p>'You're precious free and easy, my young friend,' says Starlight, walking
over. 'I rather like you. You have a keen sense of humour, evidently; but can't
you say how you found out that the men were her Majesty's police officers in
pursuit of us?'</p>
<p>'You're Cap'n Starlight, I suppose,' says the youngster, looking straight
and square at him, and not a bit put out. 'Well, I've been pretty quick coming;
thirty mile inside of three hours, I'll be bound. I heard them talking about
you. It was Starlight this and Starlight that all the time I was going in and
out of the room, pretending to look for something, and mother scolding me.'</p>
<p>'Had they their uniform on?' I asked.</p>
<p>'No fear. They thought we didn't tumble, I expect; but I seen their horses
hung up outside, both shod all round; bits and irons bright. Stabled horses,
too, I could swear. Then the youngest chap&mdash;him with the old felt
hat&mdash;walked like this.'</p>
<p>Here he squared his shoulders, put his hands by his side, and marched up and
down, looking for all the world like one of them chaps that played at
soldiering in Bargo.</p>
<p>'There's no hiding the military air, you think, Billy?' said Starlight.
'That fellow was a recruit, and had been drilled lately.'</p>
<p>'I d'no. Mother got 'em to stay, and began to talk quite innocent-like of
the bad characters there was in the country. Ha! ha! It was as good as a play.
Then they began to talk almost right out about Sergeant Goring having been away
on a wrong scent, and how wild he was, and how he would be after Starlight's
mob to-morrow morning at daylight, and some p'leece was to meet him near Rocky
Flat. They didn't say they was the p'leece; that was about four o'clock, and
getting dark.'</p>
<p>'How did you get the horse?' says Jim. 'He's not one of yours, is he?'</p>
<p>'Not he,' says the boy; 'I wish I had him or the likes of him. He belongs to
old Driver. I was just workin' it how I'd get out and catch our old moke
without these chaps being fly as I was going to talligrarph, when mother says
to me&mdash;</p>
<p>'"Have you fetched in the black cow?"</p>
<p>'We ain't got no black cow, but I knowed what she meant. I says&mdash;</p>
<p>'"No, I couldn't find her."</p>
<p>'"You catch old Johnny Smoker and look for her till you do find her, if it's
ten o'clock to-night," says mother, very fierce. "Your father'll give you a
fine larrupin' if he comes home and there's that cow lost."</p>
<p>'So off I goes and mans old Johnny, and clears out straight for here. When I
came to Driver's I runs his horses up into a yard nigh the angle of his outside
paddock and collars this little 'oss, and lets old Johnny go in hobbles. My
word, this cove can scratch!'</p>
<p>'So it seems,' says Starlight; 'here's a sovereign for you, youngster. Keep
your ears and eyes open; you'll always find that good information brings a good
price. I'd advise you to keep away from Mr. Marston, sen., and people of his
sort, and stick to your work, if I thought there was the least earthly chance
of your doing so; but I see plainly that you're not cut out for the
industrious, steady-going line.'</p>
<p>'Not if I know it,' said the boy; 'I want to see life before I die. I'm not
going to keep on milling and slaving day after day all the year round. I'll cut
it next year as sure as a gun. I say, won't you let me ride a bit of the way
with ye?'</p>
<p>'Not a yard,' says father, who was pretty cranky by this time; 'you go home
again and put that horse where you got him. We don't want old Driver tracking
and swearing after us because you ride his horses; and keep off the road as you
go back.'</p>
<p>Billy the Boy nodded his head, and jumping into his saddle, rode off again
at much about the same pace he'd come at. He was a regular reckless young
devil, as bold as a two-year-old colt in a branding-yard, that's ready to jump
at anything and knock his brains out against a stockyard post, just because
he's never known any real regular hurt or danger, and can't realise it. He was
terrible cruel to horses, and would ruin a horse in less time than any man or
boy I ever seen. I always thought from the first that he'd come to a bad end.
Howsoever, he was a wonderful chap to track and ride; none could beat him at
that; he was nearly as good as Warrigal in the bush. He was as cunning as a pet
dingo, and would look as stupid before any one he didn't know, or thought was
too respectable, as if he was half an idiot. But no one ever stirred within
twenty or thirty miles of where he lived without our hearing about it. Father
fished him out, having paid him pretty well for some small service, and ever
after that he said he could sleep in peace.</p>
<p>We had the horses up, ready saddled and fed, by sundown, and as soon as the
moon rose we made a start of it. I had time for a bit of a talk with Aileen
about the Storefields, though I couldn't bring myself to say their names at
first. I was right in thinking that Gracey had seen me led away a prisoner by
the police. She came into the hut afterwards with Aileen, as soon as mother was
better, and the two girls sat down beside one another and cried their eyes out,
Aileen said.</p>
<p>George Storefield had been very good, and told Aileen that, whatever
happened to us or the old man, it would make no difference to him or to his
feelings towards her. She thanked him, but said she could never consent to let
him disgrace himself by marrying into a family like ours. He had come over
every now and then, and had seen they wanted for nothing when father and Jim
were away; but she always felt her heart growing colder towards him and his
prosperity while we were so low down in every way. As for Gracey, she (Aileen)
believed that she was in love with me in a quiet, steady way of her own,
without showing it much, but that she would be true to me, if I asked her, to
the end of the world, and she was sure that she could never marry any one else
as long as I lived. She was that sort of girl. So didn't I think I ought to do
everything I could to get a better character, and try and be good enough for
such a girl? She knew girls pretty well. She didn't think there was such
another girl in the whole colony, and so on.</p>
<p>And when we went away where were we going to hide? I could not say about
particular distances, but I told her generally that we'd keep out of harm's
way, and be careful not to be caught. We might see her and mother now and then,
and by bush-telegraphs and other people we could trust should be able to send
news about ourselves.</p>
<p>'What's the Captain going to do?' she said suddenly. 'He doesn't look able
to bear up against hardship like the rest of you. What beautiful small hands he
has, and his eyes are like sleeping fires.'</p>
<p>'Oh, he's a good deal stronger than he looks,' I said; 'he's the smartest of
the lot of us, except it is dad, and I've heard the old man say he must knock
under to him. But don't you bother your head about him; he's quite able to take
care of himself, and the less a girl like you thinks about a man like him the
better for her.'</p>
<p>'Oh, nonsense,' she said, at the same time looking down in a half-confused
sort of way. 'I'm not likely to think about him or any one else just now; but
it seems such a dreadful thing to think a man like him, so clever and daring,
and so handsome and gentle in his ways, should be obliged to lead such a life,
hunted from place to place like&mdash;like&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Like a bush-ranger, Ailie,' I said, 'for that'll be the long and short of
it. You may as well know it now, we're going to "turn out".'</p>
<p>'You don't say that, Dick,' she said. 'Oh! surely you will never be so mad.
Do you want to kill mother and me right out? If you do, why not take a knife or
an axe and do it at once? Her you've been killing all along. As for me, I feel
so miserable and degraded and despairing at times that but for her I could go
and drown myself in the creek when I think of what the family is coming
to.'</p>
<p>'What's the use of going on like that, Aileen?' I said roughly. 'If we're
caught now, whatever we do, great or small, we're safe for years and years in
gaol. Mayn't we as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb? What odds can it make?
We'll only have bolder work than duffing cattle and faking horse-brands like a
lot of miserable crawlers that are not game for anything more sporting.'</p>
<p>'I hear, I hear,' says sister, sitting down and putting her head in her
hands. 'Surely the devil has power for a season to possess himself of the souls
of men, and do with them what he will. I know how obstinate you are, Dick. Pray
God you may not have poor Jim's blood to answer for as well as your own before
all is done. Good-bye. I can't say God bless you, knowing what I do; but may He
turn your heart from all wicked ways, and keep you from worse and deadlier evil
than you have committed! Good-night. Why, oh why, didn't we all die when we
were little children!'</p>
<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<p>I brought it out sudden-like to Aileen before I could stop myself, but it
was all true. How we were to make the first start we couldn't agree; but we
were bound to make another big touch, and this time the police would be after
us for something worth while. Anyhow, we could take it easy at the Hollow for a
bit, and settle all the ins and outs without hurrying ourselves.</p>
<p>Our dart now was to get to the Hollow that night some time, and not to leave
much of a track either. Nobody had found out the place yet, and wasn't going to
if we knew. It was too useful a hiding-place to give away without trouble, and
we swore to take all sorts of good care to keep it secret, if it was to be done
by the art of man.</p>
<p>We went up Nulla Mountain the same way as we remembered doing when Jim and I
rode to meet father that time he had the lot of weaners. We kept wide and
didn't follow on after one another so as to make a marked trail. It was a long,
dark, dreary ride. We had to look sharp so as not to get dragged off by a
breast-high bough in the thick country. There was no fetching a doctor if any
one was hurt. Father rode ahead. He knew the ins and outs of the road better
than any of us, though Jim, who had lived most of his time in the Hollow after
he got away from the police, was getting to know it pretty well. We were
obliged to go slow mostly&mdash;for a good deal of the track lay along the bed
of a creek, full of boulders and rocks, that we had to cross ever so many times
in a mile. The sharp-edged rocks, too, overhung low enough to knock your brains
out if you didn't mind.</p>
<p>It was far into the night when we got to the old yard. There it stood, just
as I recollect seeing it the time Jim and I and father branded the weaners. It
had only been used once or twice since. It was patched up a bit in places, but
nobody seemed to have gone next or nigh it for a long time. The grass had grown
up round the sliprails; it was as strange and forsaken-looking as if it
belonged to a deserted station.</p>
<p>As we rode up a man comes out from an angle of the fence and gives a
whistle. We knew, almost without looking, that it was Warrigal. He'd come there
to meet Starlight and take him round some other way. Every track and short cut
there was in the mountains was as easy to him as the road to George
Storefield's was to us. Nulla Mountain was full of curious gullies and caves
and places that the devil himself could hardly have run a man to ground in,
unless he'd lived near it all his life as Warrigal had. He wasn't very free in
showing them to us, but he'd have made a bridge of his own body any time to let
Starlight go safe. So when they rode away together we knew he was safe whoever
might be after us, and that we should see him in the Hollow some time next
day.</p>
<p>We went on for a mile or two farther; then we got off, and turned our horses
loose. The rest of the way we had to do on foot. My horse and Jim's had got
regularly broke into Rocky Flat, and we knew that they'd go home as sure as
possible, not quite straight, but keeping somewhere in the right direction. As
for father he always used to keep a horse or two, trained to go home when he'd
done with him. The pony he rode to-night would just trot off, and never put his
nose to the ground almost till he got wind of home.</p>
<p>We humped our saddles and swags ourselves; a stiffish load too, but the
night was cool, and we did our best. It was no use growling. It had to be done,
and the sooner the better. It seemed a long time&mdash;following father step by
step&mdash;before we came to the place where I thought the cattle were going to
be driven over the precipice. Here we pulled up for a bit and had a smoke. It
was a queer time and a queer look-out.</p>
<p>Three o'clock in the morning&mdash;the stars in the sky, and it so clear
that we could see Nulla Mountain rising up against it a big black lump, without
sign of tree or rock; underneath the valley, one sea of mist, and we just
agoing to drop into it; on the other side of the Hollow, the clear hill we
called the Sugarloaf. Everything seemed dead, silent, and solitary, and a
rummier start than all, here were we&mdash;three desperate men, driven to make
ourselves a home in this lonesome, God-forsaken place! I wasn't very fanciful
by that time, but if the devil had risen up to make a fourth amongst us I
shouldn't have been surprised. The place, the time, and the men seemed
regularly cut out for him and his mob.</p>
<p>We smoked our pipes out, and said nothing to each other, good or bad. Then
father makes a start, and we follows him; took a goodish while, but we got down
all right, and headed for the cave. When we got there our troubles were over
for a while. Jim struck a match and had a fire going in no time; there was
plenty of dry wood, of course. Then father rolls a keg out of a hole in the
wall; first-rate dark brandy it was, and we felt a sight better for a good
stiff nip all round. When a man's cold and tired, and hungry, and down on his
luck as well, a good caulker of grog don't do him no harm to speak of. It
strings him up and puts him straight. If he's anything of a man he can stand
it, and feel all the better for it; but it's a precious sight too easy a lesson
to learn, and there's them that can't stop, once they begin, till they've
smothered what brains God Almighty put inside their skulls, just as if they was
to bore a hole and put gunpowder in. No! they wouldn't stop if they were sure
of going to heaven straight, or to hell next minute if they put the last glass
to their lips. I've heard men say it, and knew they meant it. Not the worst
sort of men, either.</p>
<p>We were none of us like that. Not then, anyhow. We could take or leave it,
and though dad could do with his share when it was going, he always knew what
he was about, and could put the peg in any time. So we had one strongish tot
while the tea was boiling. There was a bag of ship biscuit; we fried some hung
beef, and made a jolly good supper. We were that tired we didn't care to talk
much, so we made up the fire last thing and rolled ourselves in our blankets; I
didn't wake till the sun had been up an hour or more.</p>
<p>I woke first; Jim was fast asleep, but dad had been up a goodish while and
got things ready for breakfast. It was a fine, clear morning; everything looked
beautiful, 'specially to me that had been locked up away from this sort of
thing so long. The grass was thick and green round the cave, and right up to
the big sandstone slabs of the floor, looking as if it had never been eat down
very close. No more it had. It would never have paid to have overstocked the
Hollow. What cattle and horses they kept there had a fine time of it, and were
always in grand condition.</p>
<p>Opposite where we were the valley was narrow. I could see the sandstone
precipices that walled us in, a sort of yellowish, white colour, all lighted up
with the rays of the morning sun, looking like gold towers against the heavy
green forest timber at the foot of them. Birds were calling and whistling, and
there was a little spring that fell drip, drip over a rough rock basin all
covered with ferns. A little mob of horses had fed pretty close up to the camp,
and would walk up to look curious-like, and then trot off with their heads and
tails up. It was a pretty enough sight that met my eyes on waking. It made me
feel a sort of false happiness for a time, to think we had such a place to camp
in on the quiet, and call our own, in a manner of speaking.</p>
<p>Jim soon woke up and stretched himself. Then father began, quite cheerful
like&mdash;</p>
<p>'Well, boys, what d'ye think of the Hollow again? It's not a bad earth for
the old dog-fox and his cubs when the hounds have run him close. They can't dig
him out here, or smoke him out either. We've no call to do anything but rest
ourselves for a week or two, anyhow; then we must settle on something and
buckle to it more business-like. We've been too helter-skelter lately, Jim and
I. We was beginning to run risks, got nearly dropped on more nor once.'</p>
<p>There's no mistake, it's a grand thing to wake up and know you've got
nothing to do for a bit but to take it easy and enjoy yourself. No matter how
light your work may be, if it's regular and has to be done every day, the
harness 'll gall somewhere; you get tired in time and sick of the whole
thing.</p>
<p>Jim and I knew well that, bar accidents, we were as safe in the Hollow as we
used to be in our beds when we were boys. We'd searched it through and through
last time, till we'd come to believe that only three or four people, and those
sometimes not for years at a time, had ever been inside of it. There were no
tracks of more.</p>
<p>We could see how the first gang levied; they were different. Every now and
then they had a big drink&mdash;'a mad carouse', as the books say&mdash;when
they must have done wild, strange things, something like the Spanish Main
buccaneers we'd read about. They'd brought captives with them, too. We saw
graves, half-a-dozen together, in one place. <i>they</i> didn't belong to the
band.</p>
<p>We had a quiet, comfortable meal, and a smoke afterwards. Then Jim and I
took a long walk through the Hollow, so as to tell one another what was in our
minds, which we hadn't a chance to do before. Before we'd gone far Jim pulls a
letter out of his pocket and gives it to me.</p>
<p>'It was no use sending it to you, old man, while you was in the jug,' he
says; 'it was quite bad enough without this, so I thought I'd keep it till we
were settled a bit like. Now we're going to set up in business on our own
account you'd best look over your mail.'</p>
<p>I knew the writing well, though I hadn't seen it lately. It was from
her&mdash;from Kate Morrison that was. It began&mdash;not the way most women
write, like <i>her</i>, though&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>So this is the end of your high and mighty doings, Richard Marston,
passing yourself and Jim off as squatters. I don't blame him&mdash;[no, of
course not, nobody ever blamed Jim, or would, I suppose, if he'd burned down
Government House and stuck up his Excellency as he was coming out of
church]&mdash;but when I saw in the papers that you had been arrested for
cattle-stealing I knew for the first time how completely Jeanie and I had been
duped.<br>
<br>
I won't pretend that I didn't think of the money you were said to have, and how
pleasant it would be to spend some of it after the miserable, scrambling,
skimping life we had lately been used to. But I loved you, Dick Marston, for
<i>yourself</i>, with a deep and passionate love which you will never know now,
which you would scorn and treat lightly, perhaps, if you did know. You may yet
find out what you have lost, if ever you get out of that frightful gaol.<br>
<br>
I was not such a silly fool as to pine and fret over our romance so cruelly
disturbed, though Jeanie was; it nearly broke her heart. No, Richard, my nature
is not of that make. I generally get even with people who wrong me. I send you
a photo, giving a fair idea of myself and my <i>husband</i>, Mr. Mullockson. I
accepted his offer soon after I saw your adventures, and those of your friend
Starlight, in every newspaper in the colonies. I did not hold myself bound to
live single for your sake, so did what most women do, though they pretend to
act from other motives, I disposed of myself to the best advantage.<br>
<br>
Mr. Mullockson has plenty of money, which is <i>nearly</i> everything in this
world, so that I am comfortable and well off, as far as that goes. If I am not
happy that is your fault&mdash;your fault, I say, because I am not able to tear
your false image and false self from my thoughts. Whatever happens to me in the
future you may consider yourself to blame for. I should have been a happy and
fairly good woman, as far as women go, if you had been true, or rather if
everything about you had not been utterly false and despicable.<br>
<br>
You think it fortunate after reading this, I daresay, that we are separated for
ever, <i>but we may meet again</i>, Richard Marston. <i>Then</i> you may have
reason to curse the day, as I do most heartily, when you first set eyes on<br>
<br>
<i>Kate Mullockson.</i></blockquote>
<p>Not a pleasant letter, by no manner of means. I was glad I didn't get it
while I was eating my heart out under the stifling low roof of the cell at
Nomah, or when I was bearing my load at Berrima. A few pounds more when the
weight was all I could bear and live would have crushed the heart out of me. I
didn't want anything to cross me when I was looking at mother and Aileen and
thinking how, between us, we'd done everything our worst enemy could have
wished us to do. But here, when there was plenty of time to think over old days
and plan for the future, I could bear the savage, spiteful sound of the whole
letter and laugh at the way she had got out of her troubles by taking up with a
rough old fellow whose cheque-book was the only decent thing about him. I
wasn't sorry to be rid of her either. Since I'd seen Gracey Storefield again
every other woman seemed disagreeable to me. I tore up the letter and threw it
away, hoping I had done for ever with a woman that no man living would ever
have been the better for.</p>
<p>'Glad you take it so quiet,' Jim says, after holding his tongue longer than
he did mostly. 'She's a bad, cold-hearted jade, though she is Jeanie's sister.
If I thought my girl was like her she'd never have another thought from me, but
she isn't, and never was. The worse luck I've had the closer she's stuck to me,
like a little brick as she is. I'd give all I ever had in the world if I could
go to her and say, "Here I am, Jim Marston, without a penny in the world, but I
can look every man in the face, and we'll work our way along the road of life
cheerful and loving together." But I <i>can't</i> say it, Dick, that's the
devil of it, and it makes me so wild sometimes that I could knock my brains out
against the first ironbark tree I come across.'</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, but I took hold of Jim's hand and shook it. We looked
in each other's eyes for a minute; there was no call to say anything. We always
understood one another, Jim and I.</p>
<p>As we were safe to stop in the Hollow for long spells at a time we took a
good look over it, as far as we could do on foot. We found a rum sort of place
at the end of a long gully that went easterly from the main flat. In one way
you'd think the whole valley had been an arm of the sea some time or other. It
was a bit like Sydney Harbour in shape, with one principal valley and no end of
small cover and gullies running off from it, and winding about in all
directions. Even the sandstone walls, by which the whole affair, great and
small, was hemmed in, were just like the cliff about South Head; there were
lines, too, on the face of them, Jim and I made out, just like where the waves
had washed marks and levels on the sea-rock. We didn't trouble ourselves much
about that part of it. Whatever might have been there once, it grew stunning
fine grass now, and there was beautiful clear fresh water in all the creeks
that ran through it.</p>
<p>Well, we rambled up the long, crooked gully that I was talking about till
about half-way up it got that narrow that it seemed stopped by a big rock that
had tumbled down from the top and blocked the path. It was pretty well grown
over with wild raspberries and climbers.</p>
<p>'No use going farther,' says Jim; 'there's nothing to see.'</p>
<p>'I don't know that. Been a track here some time. Let's get round and
see.'</p>
<p>When we got round the rock the track was plain again; it had been well worn
once, though neither foot nor hoof much had been along it for many a year. It
takes a good while to wear out a track in a dry country.</p>
<p>The gully widened out bit by bit, till at last we came to a little round
green flat, right under the rock walls which rose up a couple of thousand feet
above it on two sides. On the flat was an old hut&mdash;very old it seemed to
be, but not in bad trim for all that. The roof was of shingles, split, thick,
and wedge shaped; the walls of heavy ironbark slabs, and there was a stone
chimney.</p>
<p>Outside had been a garden; a few rose trees were standing yet, ragged and
stunted. The wallabies had trimmed them pretty well, but we knew what they
were. Been a corn-patch too&mdash;the marks where it had been hoed up were
there, same as they used to do in old times when there were more hoes than
ploughs and more convicts than horses and working bullocks in the country.</p>
<p>'Well, this is a rum start,' says Jim, as we sat down on a log outside that
looked as if it had been used for a seat before. 'Who the deuce ever built this
gunyah and lived in it by himself for years and years? You can see it was no
two or three months' time he done here. There's the spring coming out of the
rock he dipped his water from. The track's reg'lar worn smooth over the stones
leading to it. There was a fence round this garden, some of the rails lying
there rotten enough, but it takes time for sound hard wood to rot. He'd a stool
and table too, not bad ones either, this Robinson Crusoe cove. No end of
manavilins either. I wonder whether he come here before them
first&mdash;Government men&mdash;chaps we heard of. Likely he did and died here
too. He might have chummed in with them, of course, or he might not. Perhaps
Starlight knows something about him, or Warrigal. We'll ask them.'</p>
<p>We fossicked about for a while to see if the man who lived so long by
himself in this lonely place had left anything behind him to help us make out
what sort he was. We didn't find much. There was writing on the walls here and
there, and things cut on the fireplace posts. Jim couldn't make head or tail of
them, nor me either.</p>
<p>'The old cove may have left something worth having behind him,' he said,
after staring at the cold hearth ever so long. 'Men like him often leave gold
pieces and jewels and things behind them, locked up in brass-bound boxes;
leastways the story-books say so. I've half a mind to root up the old
hearthstone; it's a thundering heavy one, ain't it? I wonder how he got it here
all by himself.'</p>
<p>'It <i>is</i> pretty heavy,' I said. 'For all we know he may have had help
to bring it in. We've no time now to see into it; we'd better make tracks and
see if Starlight has made back. We shall have to shape after a bit, and we may
as well see how he stands affected.'</p>
<p>'He'll be back safe enough. There's no pull in being outside now with all
the world chevying after you and only half rations of food and sleep.'</p>
<p>Jim was right. As we got up to the cave we saw Starlight talking to the old
man and Warrigal letting go the horse. They'd taken their time to come in, but
Warrigal knew some hole or other where they'd hid before very likely, so they
could take it easier than we did the night we left Rocky Creek.</p>
<p>'Well, boys!' says Starlight, coming forward quite heartily, 'glad to see
you again; been taking a walk and engaging yourselves this fine weather? Rather
nice country residence of ours, isn't it? Wonder how long we shall remain in
possession! What a charm there is in home! No place like home, is there,
governor?'</p>
<p>Dad didn't smile, he very seldom did that, but I always thought he never
looked so glum at Starlight as he did at most people.</p>
<p>'The place is well enough,' he growled, 'if we don't smother it all by
letting our tracks be followed up. We've been dashed lucky so far, but it'll
take us all we know to come in and out, if we've any roadwork on hand, and no
one the wiser.'</p>
<p>'It can be managed well enough,' says Starlight. 'Is that dinner ever going
to be ready? Jim, make the tea, there's a good fellow; I'm absolutely starving.
The main thing is never to be seen together except on great occasions. Two men,
or three at the outside, can stick up any coach or travellers that are worth
while. We can get home one by one without half the risk there would be if we
were all together. Hand me the corned beef, if you please, Dick. We must hold a
council of war by and by.'</p>
<p>We were smoking our pipes and lying about on the dry floor of the cave, with
the sun coming in just enough to make it pleasant, when I started the ball.</p>
<p>'We may as well have it out now what lay we're going upon and whether we're
all agreed in our minds <i>to turn out</i>, and do the thing in the regular
good old-fashioned Sydney-side style. It's risky, of course, and we're sure to
have a smart brush or two; but I'm not going to be jugged again, not if I know
it, and I don't see but what bush-ranging&mdash;yes, <i>bush-ranging</i>, it's
no use saying one thing and meaning another&mdash;ain't as safe a game, let
alone the profits of it, as mooching about cattle-duffing and being lagged in
the long run all the same.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 23</h2>
<p>'Because it's too late,' growled father; 'too late by years. It's sink or
swim with all of us. If we work together we may make ten thousand pounds or
more in the next four or five years, enough to clear out with altogether if
we've luck. If any of us goes snivelling in now and giving himself up, they'd
know there's something crooked with the lot of us, and they'll run us down
somehow. I'll see 'em all in the pit of h&mdash;l before I give in, and if Jim
does, he opens the door and sells the pass on us. You can both do what you
like.' And here the old man walked bang away and left us.</p>
<p>'No use, Dick,' says Jim. 'If he won't it's no use my giving in. I can't
stand being thought a coward. Besides, if you were nabbed afterwards people
might say it was through me. I'd sooner be killed and buried a dozen times over
than that. It's no use talking&mdash;it isn't to be&mdash;we had better make up
our minds once for all, and then let the matter drop.'</p>
<p>Poor old Jim. He had gone into it innocent from the very first. He was
regular led in because he didn't like to desert his own flesh and blood, even
if it was wrong. Bit by bit he had gone on, not liking or caring for the thing
one bit, but following the lead of others, till he reached his present pitch.
How many men, and women too, there are in the world who seem born to follow the
lead of others for good or evil! They get drawn in somehow, and end by paying
the same penalty as those that meant nothing else from the start.</p>
<p>The finish of the whole thing was this, that we made up our minds to turn
out in the bush-ranging line. It might seem foolish enough to outsiders, but
when you come to think of it we couldn't better ourselves much. We could do no
worse than we had done, nor run any greater risk to speak of. We were 'long
sentence men' as it was, sure of years and years in prison; and, besides, we
were certain of something extra for breaking gaol. Jim and Warrigal were
'wanted', and might be arrested by any chance trooper who could recollect their
description in the 'Police Gazette'. Father might be arrested on suspicion and
remanded again and again until they could get some evidence against him for
lots of things that he'd been in besides the Momberah cattle. When it was all
boiled down it came to this, that we could make more money in one night by
sticking up a coach or a bank than in any other way in a year. That when we had
done it, we were no worse off than we were now, as far as being outlaws, and
there was a chance&mdash;not a very grand one, but still a chance&mdash;that we
might find a way to clear out of New South Wales altogether.</p>
<p>So we settled it at that. We had plenty of good horses&mdash;what with the
young ones coming on, that Warrigal could break, and what we had already. There
was no fear of running short of horse-flesh. Firearms we had enough for a dozen
men. They were easy enough to come by. We knew that by every mail-coach that
travelled on the Southern or Western line there was always a pretty fair
sprinkling of notes sent in the letters, besides what the passengers might
carry with them, watches, rings, and other valuables. It wasn't the habit of
people to carry arms, and if they did, there isn't one in ten that uses 'em.
It's all very well to talk over a dinner-table, but any one who's been stuck up
himself knows that there's not much chance of doing much in the resisting
line.</p>
<p>Suppose you're in a coach, or riding along a road. Well, you're expected and
waited for, and the road party knows the very moment you'll turn up. They see
you a-coming. You don't see them till it's too late. There's a log or something
across the road, if it's a coach, or else the driver's walking his horses up a
steepish hill. Just at the worst pinch or at a turn, some one sings out 'Bail
up.' The coachman sees a strange man in front, or close alongside of him, with
a revolver pointed straight at him. He naturally don't like to be shot, and he
pulls up. There's another man covering the passengers in the body of the coach,
and he says if any man stirs or lifts a finger he'll give him no second chance.
Just behind, on the other side, there's another man&mdash;perhaps two. Well,
what's any one, if he's ever so game, to do? If he tries to draw a weapon, or
move ever so little, he's rapped at that second. He can only shoot one man,
even if his aim is good, which it's not likely to be. What is more, the other
passengers don't thank him&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;for drawing the fire
on them. I have known men take away a fellow's revolver lest he should get them
all into trouble. That was a queer start, wasn't it? Actually preventing a man
from resisting. They were quite right, though; he could only have done mischief
and made it harder for himself and every one else. If the passengers were
armed, and all steady and game to stand a flutter, something might be done, but
you don't get a coach-load like that very often. So it's found better in a
general way to give up what they have quietly and make no fuss about it. I've
known cases where a single bush-ranger was rushed by a couple of determined
men, but that was because the chap was careless, and they were very active and
smart. He let them stand too near him. They had him, simple enough, and he was
hanged for his carelessness; but when there's three or four men, all armed and
steady, it's no use trying the rush dodge with them.</p>
<p>Of course there were other things to think about: what we were to do with
the trinkets and bank-notes and things when we got them&mdash;how to pass them,
and so on. There was no great bother about that. Besides Jonathan Barnes and
chaps of his sort, dad knew a few 'fences' that had worked for him before. Of
course we had to suffer a bit in value. These sort of men make you pay through
the nose for everything they do for you. But we could stand that out of our
profits, and we could stick to whatever was easy to pass and some of the
smaller things that were light to carry about. Men that make &pound;300 or
&pound;400 of a night can afford to pay for accommodation.</p>
<p>The big houses in the bush, too. Nothing's easier than to stick up one of
them&mdash;lots of valuable things, besides money, often kept there, and it's
ten to one against any one being on the look-out when the boys come. A man
hears they're in the neighbourhood, and keeps a watch for a week or two. But he
can't be always waiting at home all day long with double-barrelled guns, and
all his young fellows and the overseer that ought to be at their work among
their cattle or sheep on the run idling their time away. No, he soon gets sick
of that, and either sends his family away to town till the danger's past, or he
'chances it', as people do about a good many things in the country. Then some
fine day, about eleven or twelve o'clock, or just before tea, or before they've
gone to bed, the dogs bark, and three or four chaps seem to have got into the
place without anybody noticing 'em, the master of the house finds all the
revolvers looking his way, and the thing's done. The house is cleared out of
everything valuable, though nobody's harmed or frightened&mdash;in a general
way, that is&mdash;a couple of the best horses are taken out of the stable, and
the next morning there's another flaring article in the local paper. A good
many men tried all they knew to be prepared and have a show for it; but there
was only one that ever managed to come out right.</p>
<p>We didn't mean to turn out all in a minute. We'd had a rough time of it
lately, and we wanted to wait and take it easy in the Hollow and close about
for a month or so before we began business.</p>
<p>Starlight and I wanted to let our beards grow. People without any hair on
their faces are hardly ever seen in the country now, except they've been in
gaol lately, and of course we should have been marked men.</p>
<p>We saw no reason why we shouldn't take it easy. Starlight was none too
strong, though he wouldn't own it; he wouldn't have fainted as he did if he
had. He wanted good keep and rest for a month, and so did I. Now that it was
all over I felt different from what I used to do, only half the man I once was.
If we stayed in the Hollow for a month the police might think we'd gone
straight out of the country and slack off a bit. Anyhow, as long as they didn't
hit the trail off to the entrance, we couldn't be in a safer place, and though
there didn't seem much to do we thought we'd manage to hang it out somehow. One
day we were riding all together in the afternoon, when we happened to come near
the gully where Jim and I had gone up and seen the Hermit's Hut, as we had
christened it. Often we had talked about it since; wondered about the man who
had lived in it, and what his life had been.</p>
<p>This time we'd had all the horses in and were doing a bit of colt-breaking.
Warrigal and Jim were both on young horses that had only been ridden once
before, and we had come out to give them a hand.</p>
<p>'Do you know anything about that hut in the gully?' I asked Starlight.</p>
<p>'Oh yes, all there is to know about it; and that's not much. Warrigal told
me that, while the first gang that discovered this desirable country residence
were in possession, a stranger accidentally found out the way in. At first they
were for putting him to death, but on his explaining that he only wanted a
solitary home, and should neither trouble nor betray them, they agreed to let
him stay. He was "a big one gentleman", Warrigal said; but he built the hut
himself, with occasional help from the men. He was liberal with his gold, of
which he had a small store, while it lasted. He lived here many years, and was
buried under a big peach tree that he had planted himself.'</p>
<p>'A queer start, to come and live and die here; and about the strangest place
to pick for a home I ever saw.'</p>
<p>'There's a good many strange people in the colony, Dick, my boy,' says
Starlight, 'and the longer you live the more you'll find of them. Some day,
when we've got quiet horses, we'll come up and have a regular overhauling of
the spot. It's years since I've been there.'</p>
<p>'Suppose he turned out some big swell from the old country? Dad says there
used to be a few in the old days, in the colony. He might have left papers and
things behind him that might turn to good account.'</p>
<p>'Whatever he did leave was hidden away. Warrigal says he was a little chap
when he died, but he says he remembers men making a great coroboree over him
when he died, and they could find nothing. They always thought he had money,
and he showed them one or two small lumps of gold, and what he said was
gold-dust washed out from the creek bed.'</p>
<p>As we had no call to work now, we went in for a bit of sport every day.
Lord! how long it seemed since Jim and I had put the guns on our shoulders and
walked out in the beautiful fresh part of the morning to have a day's shooting.
It made us feel like boys again. When I said so the tears came into Jim's eyes
and he turned his head away. Father came one day; he and old Crib were a
stunning pair for pot shooting, and he was a dead game shot, though we could be
at him with the rifle and revolver.</p>
<p>There was a pretty fair show of game too. The lowan (Mallee hen, they're
mostly called) and talegalla (brush turkey) were thick enough in some of the
scrubby corners. Warrigal used to get the lowan eggs&mdash;beautiful pink
thin-shelled ones they are, first-rate to eat, and one of 'em a man's
breakfast. Then there were pigeons, wild ducks, quail, snipe now and then,
besides wallaby and other kangaroos. There was no fear of starving, even if we
hadn't a tidy herd of cattle to come upon.</p>
<p>The fishing wasn't bad either. The creeks ran towards the north-west
watershed and were full of codfish, bream, and perch. Even the jewfish wasn't
bad with their skins off. They all tasted pretty good, I tell you, after a
quick broil, let alone the fun of catching them. Warrigal used to make nets out
of cooramin bark, and put little weirs across the shallow places, so as we
could go in and drive the fish in. Many a fine cod we took that way. He knew
all the blacks' ways as well as a good many of ours. The worst of him was that
except in hunting, fishing, and riding he'd picked up the wrong end of the
habits of both sides. Father used to set snares for the brush kangaroo and the
bandicoots, like he'd been used to do for the hares in the old country. We
could always manage to have some kind of game hanging up. It kept us amused
too.</p>
<p>But I don't know whatever we should have done, that month we stayed there,
at the first&mdash;we were never so long idle again&mdash;without the horses.
We used to muster them twice a week, run 'em up into the big receiving yard,
and have a regular good look over 'em till we knew every one of 'em like a
book.</p>
<p>Some of 'em was worth looking at, my word! 'D'ye see that big upstanding
three-year-old dark bay filly, with a crooked streak down her face,' Starlight
would say, 'and no brand but your father's on. Do you know her name? That's
young Termagant, a daughter of Mr. Rouncival's racing mare of the same name
that was stolen a week before she was born, and her dam was never seen alive
again. Pity to kill a mare like that, wasn't it? Her sire was Repeater, the
horse that ran the two three-mile heats with Mackworth, in grand time, too.'
Then, again, 'That chestnut colt with the white legs would be worth five
hundred all out if we could sell him with his right name and breeding, instead
of having to do without a pedigree. We shall be lucky if we get a hundred clear
for him. The black filly with the star&mdash;yes, she's thoroughbred too, and
couldn't have been bought for money. Only a month old and unbranded, of course,
when your father and Warrigal managed to bone the old mare. Mr. Gibson offered
&pound;50 reward, or &pound;100 on conviction. Wasn't he wild! That big bay
horse, Warrior, was in training for a steeplechase when I took him out of Mr.
King's stable. I rode him 120 miles before twelve next day. Those two browns
are Mr. White's famous buggy horses. He thought no man could get the better of
him. But your old father was too clever. I believe he could shake the devil's
own four-in-hand&mdash;(coal black, with manes and tails touching the ground,
and eyes of fire, some German fellow says they are)&mdash;and the Prince of
Darkness never be the wiser. The pull of it is that once they're in here
they're never heard of again till it's time to shift them to another colony, or
clear them out and let the buyer take his chance.'</p>
<p>'You've some plums here,' I said. 'Even the cattle look pretty well
bred.'</p>
<p>'Always go for pedigree stock, Fifteenth Duke notwithstanding. They take no
more keep than rough ones, and they're always saleable. That red short-horn
heifer belongs to the Butterfly Red Rose tribe; she was carried thirty miles in
front of a man's saddle the day she was calved. We suckled her on an old
brindle cow; she doesn't look the worse for it. Isn't she a beauty? We ought to
go in for an annual sale here. How do you think it would pay?'</p>
<p>All this was pleasant enough, but it couldn't last for ever. After the first
week's rest, which was real pleasure and enjoyment, we began to find the life
too dull and dozy. We'd had quite enough of a quiet life, and began to long for
a bit of work and danger again. Chaps that have got something on their minds
can't stand idleness, it plays the bear with them. I've always found they get
thinking and thinking till they get a low fit like, and then if there's any
grog handy they try to screw themselves up with that. It gives them a lift for
a time, but afterwards they have to pay for it over and over again. That's
where the drinking habit comes in&mdash;they can't help it&mdash;they must
drink. If you'll take the trouble to watch men (and women too) that have been
'in trouble' you'll find that nineteen out of every twenty drink like fishes
when they get the chance. It ain't the love of the liquor, as teetotalers and
those kind of goody people always are ramming down your throat&mdash;it's the
love of nothing. But it's the fear of their own thoughts&mdash;the dreadful
misery&mdash;the anxiety about what's to come, that's always hanging like a
black cloud over their heads. That's what they can't stand; and liquor, for a
bit, mind you&mdash;say a few hours or so&mdash;takes all that kind of feeling
clean away. Of course it returns, harder than before, but that says nothing. It
<i>can</i> be driven away. All the heavy-heartedness which a man feels, but
never puts into words, flies away with the first or second glass of grog. If a
man was suffering pains of any kind, or was being stretched on the rack (I
never knew what a rack was till I'd time for reading in gaol, except a
horse-rack), or was being flogged, and a glass of anything he could swallow
would make him think he was on a feather bed enjoying a pleasant doze, wouldn't
he swig it off, do you think? And suppose there are times when a man feels as
if hell couldn't be much worse than what he's feeling all the long day
through&mdash;and I tell you there are&mdash;I, who have often stood it hour
after hour&mdash;won't he drink then? And why shouldn't he?</p>
<p>We began to find that towards the end of the day we all of us found the way
to father's brandy keg&mdash;that by nightfall the whole lot of us had quite as
much as we could stagger under. I don't say we regularly went in for drinking;
but we began to want it by twelve o'clock every day, and to keep things going
after that till bedtime. In the morning we felt nervous and miserable; on the
whole we weren't very gay till the sun was over the foreyard.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we made it up to clear out and have the first go-in for a touch on
the southern line the next week as ever was. Father was as eager for it as
anybody. He couldn't content himself with this sort of Robinson Crusoe life any
longer, and said he must have a run and a bit of work of some sort or he'd go
mad. This was on the Saturday night. Well, on Sunday we sent Warrigal out to
meet one of our telegraphs at a place about twenty miles off, and to bring us
any information he could pick up and a newspaper. He came back about sundown
that evening, and told us that the police had been all over the country after
us, and that Government had offered &pound;200 reward for our
apprehension&mdash;mine and Starlight's&mdash;with &pound;50 each for Warrigal
and Jim. They had an idea we'd all shipped for America. He sent us a newspaper.
There was some news; that is, news worth talking about. Here was what was
printed in large letters on the outside:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>WONDERFUL DISCOVERY OF GOLD AT THE TURON.<br>
<br>
We have much pleasure in informing our numerous constituents that gold, similar
in character and value to that of San Francisco, has been discovered on the
Turon River by those energetic and experienced practical miners, Messrs.
Hargraves and party. The method of cradling is the same, the appliances
required are simple and inexpensive, and the proportional yield of gold highly
reassuring. It is impossible to forecast the results of this most momentous
discovery. It will revolutionise the new world. It will liberate the old. It
will precipitate Australia into a nation.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile numberless inconveniences, even privations, will arise&mdash;to be
endured unflinchingly&mdash;to be borne in silence. But courage, England, we
have hitherto achieved victory.</blockquote>
<p>This news about the gold breaking out in such a place as the Turon made a
great difference in our notions. We hardly knew what to think at first. The
whole country seemed upside down. Warrigal used to sneak out from time to time,
and come back open-mouthed, bringing us all sorts of news. Everybody, he said,
was coming up from Sydney. There would be nobody left there but the Governor.
What a queer start&mdash;the Governor sitting lonely in a silent Government
House, in the middle of a deserted city! We found out that it was true after
we'd made one or two short rides out ourselves. Afterwards the police had a
deal too much to do to think of us. We didn't run half the chance of being
dropped on to that we used to do. The whole country was full of absconders and
deserters, servants, shepherds, shopmen, soldiers, and sailors&mdash;all
running away from their work, and making in a blind sort of way for the
diggings, like a lot of caterpillars on the march.</p>
<p>We had more than half a notion about going there ourselves, but we turned it
over in our minds, and thought it wouldn't do. We should be sure to be spotted
anywhere in New South Wales. All the police stations had our descriptions
posted up, with a reward in big letters on the door. Even if we were pretty
lucky at the start we should always be expecting them to drop on us. As it was,
we should have twenty times the chance among the coaches, that were sure to be
loaded full up with men that all carried cash, more or less; you couldn't
travel then in the country without it. We had twice the pull now, because so
many strangers, that couldn't possibly be known to the police, were straggling
over all the roads. There was no end of bustle and rush in every line of work
and labour. Money was that plentiful that everybody seemed to be full of it.
Gold began to be sent down in big lots, by the Escort, as it was
called&mdash;sometimes ten thousand ounces at a time. That was money if you
liked&mdash;forty thousand pounds!&mdash;enough to make one's mouth
water&mdash;to make one think dad's prophecy about the ten thousand pounds
wasn't so far out after all.</p>
<p>Just at the start most people had a kind of notion that the gold would only
last a short time, and that things would be worse than before. But it lasted a
deal longer than any of us expected. It was 1850 that I'm talking about. It's
getting on for 1860 now, and there seems more of it about than ever there
was.</p>
<p>Most of our lives we'd been used to the southern road, and we kept to it
still. It wasn't right in the line of the gold diggings, but it wasn't so far
off. It was a queer start when the news got round about to the other colonies,
after that to England, and I suppose all the other old world places, but they
must have come by ship-loads, the road was that full of new chums&mdash;we
could tell 'em easy by their dress, their fresh faces, their way of talk, their
thick sticks, and new guns and pistols. Some of them you'd see dragging a
hand-cart with another chap, and they having all their goods, tools, and
clothes on it. Then there'd be a dozen men, with a horse and cart, and all
their swags in it. If the horse jibbed at all, or stuck in the deep
ruts&mdash;and wasn't it a wet season?&mdash;they'd give a shout and a rush,
and tear out cart and horse and everything else. They told us that there were
rows of ships in Sydney Harbour without a soul to take care of them; that the
soldiers were running away to the diggings just as much as the sailors;
clergymen and doctors, old hands and new chums, merchants and lawyers. They all
seemed as if they couldn't keep away from the diggings that first year for
their lives.</p>
<p>All stock went up double and treble what they were before. Cattle and sheep
we didn't mind about. We could do without them now. But the horse market rose
wonderfully, and that made a deal of odds to us, you may be sure.</p>
<p>It was this way. Every man that had a few pounds wanted a horse to ride or
drive; every miner wanted a wash-dirt cart and a horse to draw it. The farmer
wanted working horses, for wasn't hay sixty or seventy pounds a ton, and corn
what you liked to ask for it? Every kind of harness horse was worth forty,
fifty, a hundred pounds apiece, and only to ask it; some of 'em weedy and bad
enough, Heaven knows. So between the horse trade and the road trade we could
see a fortune sticking out, ready for us to catch hold of whenever we were
ready to collar.</p>
<h2>Chapter 24</h2>
<p>Our first try-on in the coach line was with the Goulburn mail. We knew the
road pretty well, and picked out a place where they had to go slow and couldn't
get off the road on either side. There's always places like that in a coach
road near the coast, if you look sharp and lay it out beforehand. This wasn't
on the track to the diggings, but we meant to leave that alone till we got our
hand in a bit. There was a lot of money flying about the country in a general
way where there was no sign of gold. All the storekeepers began to get up fresh
goods, and to send money in notes and cheques to pay for them. The price of
stock kept dealers and fat cattle buyers moving, who had their pockets full of
notes as often as not.</p>
<p>Just as you got nearly through Bargo Brush on the old road there was a
stiffish hill that the coach passengers mostly walked up, to save the
horses&mdash;fenced in, too, with a nearly new three-rail fence, all ironbark,
and not the sort of thing that you could ride or drive over handy. We thought
this would be as good a place as we could pick, so we laid out the whole thing
as careful as we could beforehand.</p>
<p>The three of us started out from the Hollow as soon as we could see in the
morning; a Friday it was, I remember it pretty well&mdash;good reason I had,
too. Father and Warrigal went up the night before with the horses we were to
ride. They camped about twenty miles on the line we were going, at a place
where there was good feed and water, but well out of the way and on a lonely
road. There had been an old sheep station there and a hut, but the old man had
been murdered by the hut-keeper for some money he had saved, and a story got up
that it was haunted by his ghost. It was known as the 'Murdering Hut', and no
shepherd would ever live there after, so it was deserted. We weren't afraid of
shepherds alive or dead, so it came in handy for us, as there was water and
feed in an old lambing paddock. Besides, the road to it was nearly all a lot of
rock and scrub from the Hollow, that made it an unlikely place to be tracked
from.</p>
<p>Our dodge was to take three quiet horses from the Hollow and ride them
there, first thing; then pick up our own three&mdash;Rainbow and two other
out-and-outers&mdash;and ride bang across the southern road. When things were
over we were to start straight back to the Hollow. We reckoned to be safe there
before the police had time to know which way we'd made.</p>
<p>It all fitted in first-rate. We cracked on for the Hollow in the morning
early, and found dad and Warrigal all ready for us. The horses were in great
buckle, and carried us over to Bargo easy enough before dark. We camped about a
mile away from the road, in as thick a place as we could find, where we made
ourselves as snug as things would allow. We had brought some grub with us and a
bottle of grog, half of which we finished before we started out to spend the
evening. We hobbled the horses out and let them have an hour's picking. They
were likely to want all they could get before they saw the Hollow again.</p>
<p>It was near twelve o'clock when we mounted. Starlight said&mdash;</p>
<p>'By Jove, boys, it's a pity we didn't belong to a troop of irregular horse
instead of this rotten colonial Dick Turpin business, that one can't help being
ashamed of. They would have been delighted to have recruited the three of us,
as we ride, and our horses are worth best part of ten thousand rupees. What a
tent-pegger Rainbow would have made, eh, old boy?' he said, patting the horse's
neck. 'But Fate won't have it, and it's no use whining.'</p>
<p>The coach was to pass half-an-hour after midnight. An awful long time to
wait, it seemed. We finished the bottle of brandy, I know. I thought they never
would come, when all of a sudden we saw the lamp.</p>
<p>Up the hill they came slow enough. About half-way up they stopped, and most
of the passengers got out and walked up after her. As they came closer to us we
could hear them laughing and talking and skylarking, like a lot of boys. They
didn't think who was listening. 'You won't be so jolly in a minute or two,' I
thinks to myself.</p>
<p>They were near the top when Starlight sings out, 'Stand! Bail up!' and the
three of us, all masked, showed ourselves. You never saw a man look so scared
as the passenger on the box-seat, a stout, jolly commercial, who'd been giving
the coachman Havana cigars, and yarning and nipping with him at every house
they passed. Bill Webster, the driver, pulls up all standing when he sees what
was in Starlight's hand, and holds the reins so loose for a minute I thought
they'd drop out of his hands. I went up to the coach. There was no one
inside&mdash;only an old woman and a young one. They seemed struck all of a
heap, and couldn't hardly speak for fright.</p>
<p>The best of the joke was that the passengers started running up full split
to warm themselves, and came bump against the coach before they found out what
was up. One of them had just opened out for a bit of blowing. 'Billy, old man,'
he says, 'I'll report you to the Company if you crawl along this way,' when he
catches sight of me and Starlight, standing still and silent, with our
revolvers pointing his way. By George! I could hardly help laughing. His jaw
dropped, and he couldn't get a word out. His throat seemed quite dry.</p>
<p>'Now, gentlemen,' says Starlight, quite cool and cheerful-like, 'you
understand her Majesty's mail is stuck up, to use a vulgar expression, and
there's no use resisting. I must ask you to stand in a row there by the fence,
and hand out all the loose cash, watches, or rings you may have about you.
Don't move; don't, I say, sir, or I must fire.' (This was to a fidgety, nervous
man who couldn't keep quiet.) 'Now, Number One, fetch down the mail bags;
Number Two, close up here.'</p>
<p>Here Jim walked up, revolver in hand, and Starlight begins at the first man,
very stern&mdash;</p>
<p>'Hand out your cash; keep back nothing, if you value your life.'</p>
<p>You never saw a man in such a funk. He was a storekeeper, we found
afterwards. He nearly dropped on his knees. Then he handed Starlight a bundle
of notes, a gold watch, and took a handsome diamond ring from his finger. This
Starlight put into his pocket. He handed the notes and watch to Jim, who had a
leather bag ready for them. The man sank down on the ground; he had
fainted.</p>
<p>He was left to pick himself up. No. 2 was told to shell out. They all had
something. Some had sovereigns, some had notes and small cheques, which are as
good in a country place. The squatters draw too many to know the numbers of
half that are out, so there's no great chance of their being stopped. There
were eighteen male passengers, besides the chap on the box-seat. We made him
come down. By the time we'd got through them all it was best part of an
hour.</p>
<p>I pulled the mail bags through the fence and put them under a tree. Then
Starlight went to the coach where the two women were. He took off his hat and
bowed.</p>
<p>'Unpleasant necessity, madam, most painful to my feelings altogether, I
assure you. I must really ask you&mdash;ah&mdash;is the young lady your
daughter, madam?'</p>
<p>'Not at all,' says the oldest, stout, middle-aged woman; 'I never set eyes
on her before.'</p>
<p>'Indeed, madam,' says Starlight, bowing again; 'excuse my curiosity, I am
desolated, I assure you, but may I trouble you for your watches and
purses?'</p>
<p>'As you're a gentleman,' said the fat lady, 'I fully expected you'd have let
us off. I'm Mrs. Buxter, of Bobbrawobbra.'</p>
<p>'Indeed! I have no words to express my regret,' says Starlight; 'but, my
dear lady, hard necessity compels me. Thanks, very much,' he said to the young
girl.</p>
<p>She handed over a small old Geneva watch and a little purse. The plump lady
had a gold watch with a chain and purse to match.</p>
<p>'Is that all?' says he, trying to speak stern.</p>
<p>'It's my very all,' says the girl, 'five pounds. Mother gave me her watch,
and I shall have no money to take me to Bowning, where I am going to a
situation.'</p>
<p>Her lips shook and trembled and the tears came into her eyes.</p>
<p>Starlight carefully handed Mrs. Buxter's watch and purse to Jim. I saw him
turn round and open the other purse, and he put something in, if I didn't
mistake. Then he looked in again.</p>
<p>'I'm afraid I'm rather impertinent,' says he, 'but your face,
Miss&mdash;ah&mdash;Elmsdale, thanks&mdash;reminds me of some one in another
world&mdash;the one I once lived in. Allow me to enjoy the souvenir and to
return your effects. No thanks; that smile is ample payment. Ladies, I wish you
a pleasant journey.'</p>
<p>He bowed. Mrs. Buxter did not smile, but looked cross enough at the young
lady, who, poor thing, seemed pretty full up and inclined to cry at the
surprise.</p>
<p>'Now then, all aboard,' sings out Starlight; 'get in, gentlemen, our
business matters are concluded for the night. Better luck next time. William,
you had better drive on. Send back from the next stage, and you will find the
mail bags under that tree. They shall not be injured more than can be helped.
Good-night!'</p>
<p>The driver gathered up his reins and shouted to his team, that was pretty
fresh after their spell, and went off like a shot. We sat down by the roadside
with one of the coach lamps that we had boned and went through all the letters,
putting them back after we'd opened them, and popping all notes, cheques, and
bills into Jim's leather sack. We did not waste more time over our
letter-sorting than we could help, you bet; but we were pretty well paid for
it&mdash;better than the post-office clerks are, by all accounts. We left all
the mail bags in a heap under the tree, as Starlight had told the driver; and
then, mounting our horses, rode as hard as we could lick to where dad and
Warrigal were camped.</p>
<p>When we overhauled the leather sack into which Jim had stowed all the notes
and cheques we found that we'd done better than we expected, though we could
see from the first it wasn't going to be a bad night's work. We had &pound;370
in notes and gold, a biggish bag of silver, a lot of cheques&mdash;some of
which would be sure to be paid&mdash;seven gold watches and a lot of silver
ones, some pretty good. Mrs. Buxter's watch was a real beauty, with a stunning
chain. Starlight said he should like to keep it himself, and then I knew Bella
Barnes was in for a present. Starlight was one of those chaps that never forgot
any kind of promise he'd once made. Once he said a thing it would be done as
sure as death&mdash;if he was alive to do it; and many a time I've known him
take the greatest lot of trouble no matter how pushed he might be, to carry out
something which another man would have never troubled his head about.</p>
<p>We got safe to the Murdering Hut, and a precious hard ride it was, and tried
our horses well, for, mind you, they'd been under saddle best part of
twenty-four hours when we got back, and had done a good deal over a hundred
miles. We made a short halt while the tea was boiling, then we all separated
for fear a black tracker might have been loosed on our trail, and knowing well
what bloodhounds they are sometimes.</p>
<p>Warrigal and Starlight went off together as usual; they were pretty safe to
be out of harm's way. Father made off on a line of his own. We took the two
horses we'd ridden out of the Hollow, and made for that place the shortest way
we knew. We could afford to hit out&mdash;horse-flesh was cheap to us&mdash;but
not to go slow. Time was more than money to us now&mdash;it was blood, or next
thing to it.</p>
<p>'I'll go anywhere you like,' says Jim, stretching himself. 'It makes no odds
to me now where we go. What do you think of it, dad?'</p>
<p>'I think you've no call to leave here for another month anyhow; but as I
suppose some folks 'll play the fool some road or other you may as well go
there as anywhere else. If you must go you'd better take some of these young
horses with you and sell them while prices keep up.'</p>
<p>'Capital idea,' says Starlight; 'I was wondering how we'd get those colts
off. You've the best head amongst us, governor. We'll start out to-day and
muster the horses, and we can take Warrigal with us as far as Jonathan Barnes's
place.'</p>
<p>We didn't lose time once we'd made up our minds to anything. So that night
all the horses were in and drafted ready&mdash;twenty-five upstanding colts,
well bred, and in good condition. We expected they'd fetch a lot of money. They
were all quiet, too, and well broken in by Warrigal, who used to get so much a
head extra for this sort of work, and liked it. He could do more with a horse
than any man I ever saw. They never seemed to play up with him as young horses
do with other people. Jim and I could ride 'em easy enough when they was
tackled, but for handling and catching and getting round them we couldn't hold
a candle to Warrigal.</p>
<p>The next thing was to settle how to work it when we got to the diggings. We
knew the auctioneers there and everywhere else would sell a lot of likely stock
and ask no questions; but there had been such a lot of horse-stealing since the
diggings broke out that a law had been passed on purpose to check it. In this
way: If any auctioneer sold a stolen horse and the owner claimed it before six
months the auctioneer was held liable. He had to return the horse and stand the
loss. But they found a way to make themselves right. Men generally do if a
law's over sharp; they get round it somehow or other. So the auctioneers made
it up among themselves to charge ten per cent on the price of all horses that
they sold, and make the buyer pay it. For every ten horses they sold they could
afford to return one. The proof of an animal being stolen didn't turn up above
once in fifty or a hundred times, so they could well afford the expense when it
did.</p>
<p>It wasn't an easy thing to drive horses out of the Hollow, 'specially those
that had been bred or reared there. But they were up to all that kind of thing,
dad and Starlight. First there was a yard at the lower end of the gully that
led up where we'd first seen Starlight come down, and a line of fence across
the mountain walls on both sides, so that stock once in there couldn't turn
back. Then they picked out a couple or three old mares that had been years and
years in the Hollow, and been used to be taken up this track and knew their way
back again. One they led up; dad went first with her, and another followed;
then the colts took the track after them, as stock will. In half-an-hour we had
them all up at the top, on the tableland, and ready to be driven anywhere. The
first day we meant to get most of the way to Jonathan Barnes's place, and to
stop there, and have a bit of a spell the second. We should want to spell the
horses and make 'em up a bit, as it was a longish drive over rough country to
get there. Besides, we wanted all the information we could get about the
diggings and other matters, and we knew Jonathan was just that open-mouthed,
blatherskitin' sort of chap that would talk to everybody he saw, and hear
mostly all that was going on.</p>
<p>A long, hard day was that first one. The colts tried to make back every now
and then, or something would start them, and they'd make a regular stampede for
four or five miles as hard as they could lay leg to ground. It wasn't easy to
live with 'em across broken country, well-bred 'uns like them, as fast as
racehorses for a short distance; but there were as good behind 'em, and
Warrigal was pretty nearly always near the lead, doubling and twisting and
wheeling 'em the first bit of open ground there was. He was A1 through timber,
and no mistake. We got to a place father knew, where there was a yard, a little
before dark; but we took care to watch them all night for fear of accidents. It
wouldn't do to let 'em out of our sight about there. We should never have set
eyes on 'em again, and we knew a trick worth two of that.</p>
<p>Next day, pretty early, we got to Barnes's, where we thought we should be
welcome. It was all right. The old man laughed all over his face when he saw
us, and the girls couldn't do enough for us when they heard we'd had scarce a
morsel to eat or drink that day.</p>
<p>'Why, you're looking first-rate, Captain!' says Bella. 'Dick, I hardly
knowed ye&mdash;the mountain air seems to agree with you. Maddie and I thought
you was never going to look in no more. Thought you'd clean forgot
us&mdash;didn't we, Mad? Why, Dick, what a grand beard you've grown! I never
thought you was so handsome before!'</p>
<p>'I promised you a trifling present when I was here last, didn't I, Bella?'
says Starlight. 'There.' He handed her a small parcel carefully tied up. 'It
will serve to remind you of a friend.'</p>
<p>'Oh, what a lovely, splendid duck of a watch!' says the girl, tearing open
the parcel. 'And what a love of a chain! and lots of charms, too. Where, in all
the world, did you get this? I suppose you didn't buy it in George Street.'</p>
<p>'It <i>was</i> bought in George Street,' says he; 'and here's the receipt;
you needn't be afraid of wearing it to church or anywhere else. Here's Mr.
Flavelle's name, all straight and square. It's quite new, as you can see.'</p>
<p>Jim and I stared. Dad was outside, seeing the horses fed, with Warrigal. We
made sure at first it was Mrs. Buxter's watch and chain; but he knew better
than to give the girl anything that she could be brought into trouble for
wearing, if it was identified on her; so he'd sent the cash down to Sydney, and
got the watch sent up to him by one of father's pals. It was as right as the
bank, and nobody could touch it or her either. That was Starlight all over; he
never seemed to care much for himself. As to anything he told a woman, she'd no
call to trouble herself about whether it would be done or not.</p>
<p>'It'll be my turn next,' says Maddie. 'I can't afford to wait
till&mdash;till&mdash;the Captain leaves me that beauty horse of his. It's too
long. I might be married before that, and my old man cut up rough. Jim Marston,
what are you going to give me? I haven't got any earrings worth looking at,
except these gold hoops that everybody knows.'</p>
<p>'All right,' says Jim. 'I'll give you and Bell a pair each, if you're good
girls, when we sell the horses, unless we're nailed at the Turon. What sort of
a shop is it? Are they getting much gold?'</p>
<p>'Digging it out like potatoes,' says Bella; 'so a young chap told us that
come this way last week. My word! didn't he go on about the coach being stuck
up. Mad and I nearly choked ourselves laughing. We made him tell it over twice.
He said a friend of his was in it&mdash;in the coach, that is&mdash;and we
could have told him friends of ours was in it too, couldn't we?'</p>
<p>'And what did he think of it all?'</p>
<p>'Oh, he was a new chum; hadn't been a year out. Not a bad cut of a young
feller. He was awful shook on Mad; but she wouldn't look at him. He said if it
was in England the whole countryside would rise up and hunt such scoundrels
down like mad dogs; but in a colony like this people didn't seem to know right
from wrong.'</p>
<p>'Did he, indeed?' says Starlight. 'Ingenuous youth! When he lives a little
longer he'll find that people in England, and, indeed, everywhere else, are
very much like they are here. They'll wink at a little robbery, or take a hand
themselves if it's made worth their while. And what became of your English
friend?'</p>
<p>'Oh! he said he was going on to Port Phillip. There's a big diggings broke
out there too, he says; and he has some friends there, and he thinks he'll like
that side better.'</p>
<p>'I think we'd better cut the Sydney "side", too,' says Starlight. 'What do
you say, Maddie? We'll be able to mix up with these new chum Englishmen and
Americans that are coming here in swarms, and puzzle Sergeant Goring and his
troopers more than ever.'</p>
<p>'Oh! come, now! that would be mean,' says Maddie. 'I wouldn't be drove away
from my own part of the country, if I was a man, by anybody. I'd stay and fight
it out. Goring was here the other day, and tried to pick out something from
father and us about the lot of you.'</p>
<p>'Ha!' says Starlight, his face growing dark, and different-looking about the
eyes from what I'd ever seen him, 'did he? He'd better beware. He may follow up
my trail once too often. And what did you tell him?'</p>
<p>'We told him a lot of things,' says the girl; 'but I am afeared they was
none of 'em true. He didn't get much out of us, nor wouldn't if he was to come
once a week.'</p>
<p>'I expect not,' says Jim; 'you girls are smart enough. There's no man in the
police or out of it that'll take much change out of you. I'm most afraid of
your father, though, letting the cat out of the bag; he's such an old duffer to
blow.'</p>
<p>'He was nearly telling the sergeant he'd seen a better horse lately here
than his famous chestnut Marlborough, only Bella trod on his toe, and told him
the cows was in the wheat. Of course Goring would have dropped it was Rainbow,
or some well-bred horse you chaps have been shaking lately.'</p>
<p>'You're a regular pearl of discretion, my dear,' says Starlight, 'and it's a
pity, like some other folks, you haven't a better field for the exercise of
your talents. However, that's very often the way in this world, as you'll
perhaps find out when you're old and ugly, and the knowledge can't do you any
good. Tell us all you heard about the coach accident.'</p>
<p>'My word! it was the greatest lark out,' says Maddie. She'd twice the fun in
her the other had, and was that good-tempered nothing seemed to put her out.
'Everybody as come here seemed to have nothing else to talk about. Those that
was going to the diggings, too, took it much easier than those that was coming
away.'</p>
<p>'How was that?'</p>
<p>'Well, the chaps that come away mostly have some gold. They showed us some
pretty fair lumps and nuggets, I can tell you. They seemed awfully gallied
about being stuck up and robbed of it, and they'd heard yarns of men being tied
to trees in the bush and left there to die.'</p>
<p>'Tell them for me, my fair Madeline, that Starlight and Company don't deal
with single diggers; ours is a wholesale business&mdash;eh, Dick? We leave the
retail robbery to meaner villains.'</p>
<p>We had the horses that quiet by this time that we could drive them the rest
of the way to the Turon by ourselves. We didn't want to be too big a mob at
Barnes's house. Any one might come in accidental, and it might get spread
about. So after supper Warrigal was sent back; we didn't want his help any
more, and he might draw attention. The way we were to take in the horses, and
sell them, was all put up.</p>
<p>Jim and I were to drive them the rest of the way across the ranges to the
Turon. Barnes was to put us on a track he knew that would take us in all right,
and yet keep away from the regular highway. Starlight was to stay another day
at Barnes's, keeping very quiet, and making believe, if any one came, to be a
gentleman from Port Phillip that wasn't very well. He'd come in and see the
horses sold, but gammon to be a stranger, and never set eyes on us before.</p>
<p>'My word!' said Barnes, who just came in at the time, 'you've made talk
enough for all the countryside with that mail coach racket of yours. Every man,
woman, and child that looks in here's sure to say, "Did you hear about the
Goulburn mail being stuck up?" "Well, I did hear something," I says, and out it
all comes. They wonder first whether the bush-rangers will be caught; where
they're gone to that the police can't get 'em; how it was that one of 'em was
so kind to the young lady as to give her new watch back, and whether Captain
Starlight was as handsome as people say, and if Mrs. Buxter will ever get her
watch back with the big reward the Government offered. More than that, whether
they'll stick up more coaches or fly the country.'</p>
<p>'I'd like to have been there and see how Bill Webster looked,' says Maddie.
'He was here one day since, and kept gassin' about it all as if he wouldn't let
none of you do only what he liked. I didn't think he was that game, and told
him so. He said I'd better take a seat some day and see how I liked it. I asked
him wasn't they all very good-looking chaps, and he said Starlight was
genteel-lookin', but there was one great, big, rough-lookin' feller&mdash;that
was you, Jim&mdash;as was ugly enough to turn a cask of beer sour.'</p>
<p>'I'll give him a hammerin' for that yet,' grumbles old Jim. 'My word, he was
that shaky and blue-lookin' he didn't know whether I was white or black.'</p>
<p>We had a great spree that night in a quiet way, and got all the fun as was
to be had under the circumstances. Barnes came out with some pretty good wine
which Starlight shouted for all round. The old woman cooked us a stunning good
dinner, which we made the girls sit down to and some cousins of theirs that
lived close by. We were merry enough before the evening was out. Bella Barnes
played the piano middling, and Maddie could sing first-rate, and all of them
could dance. The last thing I recollect was Starlight showing Maddie what he
called a minuet step, and Jonathan and the old woman sitting on the sofa as
grave as owls.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we all enjoyed ourselves. It was a grand change after being so long
alone. The girls romped and laughed and pretended to be offended every now and
then, but we had a regular good lark of it, and didn't feel any the worse at
daylight next morning.</p>
<p>Jim and I were away before sunrise, and after we'd once got on the road that
Jonathan showed us we got on well enough. We were dressed just like common
bushmen. There were plenty on the road just then bringing cattle and horses to
the diggings. It was well known that high prices were going there and that
everybody paid in cash. No credit was given, of course.</p>
<p>We had on blue serge shirts, moleskin trousers, and roughish leather gaiters
that came up to the knee, with ponchos strapped on in front; inside them was a
spare shirt or two; we had oldish felt hats, as if we'd come a good way. Our
saddles and bridles were rusty-looking and worn; the horses were the only
things that were a little too good, and might bring the police to suspect us.
We had to think of a yarn about them. We looked just the same as a hundred
other long-legged six-foot natives with our beards and hair pretty
wild&mdash;neither better nor worse.</p>
<p>As soon as Starlight came on to the Turon he was to rig himself out as a
regular swell, and gammon he'd just come out from England to look at the
goldfields. He could do that part wonderfully well. We would have backed him to
take in the devil himself, if he saw him, let alone goldfields police, if
Sergeant Goring wasn't about.</p>
<p>The second day Jim and I were driving quietly and easy on the road, the
colts trotting along as steady as old stock horses, and feeding a bit every now
and then. We knew we were getting near the Turon, so many tracks came in from
all parts, and all went one way. All of a sudden we heard a low rumbling,
roaring noise, something like the tide coming in on the seashore.</p>
<p>'I say, Jim, old man, we haven't made any mistake&mdash;crossed over the
main range and got back to the coast, have we?'</p>
<p>'Not likely,' he said; 'but what the deuce is that row? I can't reckon it up
for the life of me.'</p>
<p>I studied and studied. On it went grinding and rattling like all the round
pebbles in the world rolling on a beach with a tidy surf on. I tumbled at
last.</p>
<p>'Remember that thing with the two rockers we saw at the Hermit's Hut in the
Hollow?' I said to Jim. 'We couldn't make out what it was. I know now; it was a
gold cradle, and there's hundreds and thousands rocking there at the Turon.
That's what's the matter.'</p>
<p>'We're going to see some life, it strikes me,' says he. 'We'll know it all
directly. But the first thing we've got to do is to shut these young 'uns up
safe in the sale-yard. Then we can knock round this town in comfort.'</p>
<p>We went outside of a rocky point, and sure enough here was the first
Australian gold-diggings in full blast. What a sight it was, to be sure! Jim
and I sat in our saddles while the horses went to work on the green grass of
the flat, and stared as if we'd seen a bit of another world. So it was another
world to us, straight away from the sad-voiced solitudes of the bush.</p>
<p>Barring Sydney or Melbourne, we'd never seen so many men in a crowd before;
and how different they looked from the crawling people of a town! A
green-banked rapid river ran before us, through a deep narrow valley. The
bright green flats looked so strange with the yellow water rippling and rushing
between them. Upon that small flat, and by the bank, and in the river itself,
nearly 20,000 men were at work, harder and more silently than any crowd we'd
ever seen before. Most of 'em were digging, winding up greenhide buckets filled
with gravel from shafts, which were sunk so thickly all over the place that you
could not pass between without jostling some one. Others were driving carts
heavily laden with the same stuff towards the river, in which hundreds of men
were standing up to their waists washing the gold out of tin pans, iron
buckets, and every kind of vessel or utensil. By far the greater number of
miners used things like child's cradles, rocking them to and fro while a
constant stream of yellow water passed through. Very little talk went on; every
man looked feverishly anxious to get the greatest quantity of work done by
sundown.</p>
<p>Foot police and mounted troopers passed through the crowd every now and
then, but there was apparently no use or no need for them; that time was to
come. Now and then some one would come walking up, carrying a knapsack, not a
swag, and showing by his round, rosy face that he hadn't seen a summer's sun in
Australia. We saw a trooper riding towards us, and knowing it was best to take
the bull by the horns, I pushed over to him, and asked if he could direct us to
where Mr. Stevenson's, the auctioneer's, yard was.</p>
<p>'Whose horses are these?' he said, looking at the brands. 'B.M., isn't
it?'</p>
<p>'Bernard Muldoon, Lower Macquarie,' I answered. 'There's a friend of his, a
new chum, in charge; he'll be here to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'Go on down Main Street [the first street in a diggings is always called
Main Street] as you're going,' he said carelessly, giving us all a parting look
through, 'and take the first lane to the right. It takes you to the yard. It's
sale-day to-morrow; you're in luck.'</p>
<p>It was rather sharp work getting the colts through men, women, and children,
carts, cradles, shafts, and tin dishes; but they were a trifle tired and
tender-footed, so in less than twenty minutes they were all inside of a high
yard, where they could scarcely see over the cap, with a row of loose boxes and
stalls behind. We put 'em into Joe Stevenson's hands to sell&mdash;that was
what every one called the auctioneer&mdash;and walked down the long street.</p>
<p>My word, we were stunned, and no mistake about it. There was nothing to see
but a rocky river and a flat, deep down between hills like we'd seen scores and
scores of times all our lives and thought nothing of, and here they were
digging gold out of it in all directions, just like potatoes, as Maddie Barnes
said. Some of the lumps we saw&mdash;nuggets they called 'em&mdash;was near as
big as new potatoes, without a word of a lie in it. I couldn't hardly believe
it; but I saw them passing the little washleather bags of gold dust and lumps
of dirty yellow gravel, but heavier, from one to the other just as if they were
nothing&mdash;nearly &pound;4 an ounce they said it was all worth, or a trifle
under. It licked me to think it had been hid away all the time, and not even
the blacks found it out. I believe our blacks are the stupidest, laziest
beggars in the whole world. That old man who lived and died in the Hollow,
though&mdash;<i>he</i> must have known about it; and the queer-looking thing
with the rockers we saw near his hut, that was the first cradle ever was made
in Australia.</p>
<p>The big man of the goldfield seemed to be the Commissioner. We saw him come
riding down the street with a couple of troopers after his heels, looking as if
all the place, and the gold too, belonged to him. He had to settle all the rows
and disputes that came up over the gold, and the boundaries of the claims, as
they called the twenty-foot paddocks they all washed in, and a nice time he
must have had of it! However, he was pretty smart and quick about it. The
diggers used to crowd round and kick up a bit of a row sometimes when two lots
of men were fighting for the same claim and gold coming up close by; but what
he said was law, and no mistake. When he gave it out they had to take it and be
content. Then he used to ride away and not trouble his head any more about it;
and after a bit of barneying it all seemed to come right. Men liked to be
talked to straight, and no shilly-shally.</p>
<p>What I didn't like so much was the hunting about of the poor devils that had
not got what they called a licence&mdash;a printed thing giving 'em leave for
to dig gold on the Crown lands. This used to cost a pound or thirty shillings a
month&mdash;I forget rightly which&mdash;and, of course, some of the chaps
hadn't the money to get it with&mdash;spent what they had, been unlucky, or run
away from somewhere, and come up as bare of everything to get it out of the
ground.</p>
<p>You'd see the troopers asking everybody for their licences, and those that
hadn't them would be marched up to the police camp and chained to a big log,
sometimes for days and days. The Government hadn't time to get up a lock-up,
with cells and all the rest of it, so they had to do the chain business. Some
of these men had seen better days, and felt it; the other diggers didn't like
it either, and growled a good deal among themselves. We could see it would make
bad blood some day; but there was such a lot of gold being got just then that
people didn't bother their heads about anything more than they could
help&mdash;plenty of gold, plenty of money, people bringing up more things
every day from the towns for the use of the diggers. You could get pretty near
anything you wanted by paying for it. Hard work from daylight to dark, with
every now and then a big find to sweeten it, when a man could see as much money
lying at his foot, or in his hand, as a year's work&mdash;no, nor
five&mdash;hadn't made for him before. No wonder people were not in a hurry to
call out for change in a place like the Turon in the year 1850!</p>
<p>The first night put the stuns on us. Long rows of tents, with big roaring
log fires in front hot enough to roast you if you went too near; mobs of men
talking, singing, chaffing, dealing&mdash;all as jolly as a lot of schoolboys.
There was grog, too, going, as there is everywhere. No publics were allowed at
first, so, of course, it was sold on the sly.</p>
<p>It's no use trying to make men do without grog, or the means of getting it;
it never works. I don't hold with every shanty being licensed and its being
under a man's nose all day long; but if he has the money to pay for it, and
wants to have an extra glass of grog or two with his friends, or because he has
other reasons, he ought to be able to get it without hardships being put in his
way.</p>
<p>The Government was afraid of there being tremendous fights and riots at the
diggings, because there was all sorts of people there, English and French,
Spaniards and Italians, natives and Americans, Greeks and Germans, Swedes and
negroes, every sort and kind of man from every country in the world seemed to
come after a bit. But they needn't have been frightened at the diggers. As far
as we saw they were the sensiblest lot of working men we ever laid eyes on; not
at all inclined to make a row for nothing&mdash;quite the other way. But the
shutting off of public-houses led to sly grog tents, where they made the digger
pay a pound a bottle for his grog, and didn't keep it very good either.</p>
<p>When the police found a sly grog tent they made short work of it, I will
say. Jim and I were close by, and saw them at the fun. Somebody had informed on
the man, or they had some other reason; so they rode down, about a dozen
troopers, with the Commissioner at their head. He went in and found two casks
of brandy and one of rum, besides a lot of bottled stuff. They didn't want that
for their own use, he believed.</p>
<p>First he had the heads knocked in of the hogsheads; then all the bottled
wine and spirits were unpacked and stowed in a cart, while the straw was put
back in the tent. Then the men and women were ordered to come outside, and a
trooper set fire to the straw. In five minutes the tent and everything in it
was a mass of flame.</p>
<p>There was a big crowd gathered round outside. They began to groan when the
trooper lit the straw, but they did nothing, and went quietly home after a bit.
We had the horses to see after next day. Just before the sale began, at twelve
o'clock, and a goodish crowd had turned up, Starlight rides quietly up, the
finest picture of a new chum you ever set eyes on. Jim and I could hardly keep
from bursting out laughing.</p>
<p>He had brought up a quiet cobby sort of stock horse from the Hollow, plain
enough, but a wonder to go, particularly over broken country. Of course, it
didn't do to bring Rainbow out for such work as this. For a wonder, he had a
short tail. Well, he'd squared this cob's tail and hogged his mane so that he
looked like another animal. He was pretty fat, too.</p>
<p>He was dressed up to the nines himself, and if we didn't expect him we
wouldn't have known him from a crow. First of all, he had a thick rough suit of
tweed clothing on, all the same colour, with a round felt hat. He had a bran
new saddle and bridle, that hadn't got the yellow rubbed off them yet. He had
an English hunting whip in his hand, and brown dogskin gloves. He had tan
leather gaiters that buttoned up to his knees. He'd shaved his beard all but
his moustache and a pair of short whiskers.</p>
<p>He had an eyeglass in his eye, which he let drop every now and then, putting
it up when he wanted to look at anybody.</p>
<p>When he rode up to the yard everybody stared at him, and one or two of the
diggers laughed and began to call out 'Joe.' Jim and I thought how sold some of
them would have been if he turned on them and they'd found out who it was.
However, he pushed up to the auctioneer, without looking out right or left, and
drawled&mdash;</p>
<p>'May I&mdash;er&mdash;ask if you are Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Joseph
Stevenson?'</p>
<p>'I'm Joe Stevenson,' says the auctioneer. 'What can I do for you?'</p>
<p>'Oh!&mdash;a&mdash;here is a letter from my friend, Mr. Bernard Muldoon, of
the Lower Macquarie&mdash;er&mdash;requesting you to sell these horses faw him;
and&mdash;er&mdash;hand over the pwoceeds to&mdash;er&mdash;me&mdash;Mr.
Augustus Gwanby&mdash;aw!'</p>
<p>Stevenson read the letter, nodded his head, said, 'All right; I'll attend to
it,' and went on with the sale.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to sell our colts. There were some draught stock to come
afterwards, and Joe had a day's work before him. But ours sold well. There had
not been anything like this for size, quality, and condition. The Commissioner
sent down and bought one. The Inspector of Police was there, and bought one
recommended by Starlight. They fetched high prices, from fifty to eighty-five
guineas, and they came to a fairish figure the lot.</p>
<p>When the last horse was sold, Starlight says, 'I feel personally obliged to
you, Mr.&mdash;aw&mdash;Stevenson&mdash;faw the highly satisfactory manner in
which you have conducted the sale, and I shall inform my friend, Mr. Muldoon,
of the way you have sold his stock.'</p>
<p>'Much obliged, sir,' says Joe, touching his hat. 'Come inside and I'll give
you the cheque.'</p>
<p>'Quite unnecessary now,' says Starlight; 'but as I'm acting for a friend, it
may be as well.'</p>
<p>We saw him pocket the cheque, and ride slowly over to the bank, which was
half-tent, half-bark hut.</p>
<p>We didn't think it safe to stay on the Turon an hour longer than we were
forced to do. We had seen the diggings, and got a good notion of what the whole
thing was like; sold the horses and got the money, that was the principal
thing. Nothing for it now but to get back to the Hollow. Something would be
sure to be said about the horses being sold, and when it came out that they
were not Muldoon's there would be a great flare-up. Still they could not prove
that the horses were stolen. There wasn't a wrong brand or a faked one in the
lot. And no one could swear to a single head of them, though the whole lot were
come by on the cross, and father could have told who owned every one among
them. That was curious, wasn't it?</p>
<p>We put in a night at Jonathan Barnes's on our way back. Maddie got the
earrings, and Bella the making of a new riding habit, which she had been
wanting and talking about for a good while. Starlight dressed up, and did the
new chum young Englishman, eyeglass and all, over again, and repeated the
conversation he had with the Inspector of Police about his friend Mr. Muldoon's
illness, and the colts he recommended. It was grand, and the girls laughed till
they cried again. Well, those were merry days; we <i>did</i> have a bit of fun
sometimes, and if the devil was dogging us he kept a good way out of sight.
It's his way at the start when fellows take the downward track.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>We got back safe enough, and father opened his eyes when he saw the roll of
notes Starlight counted over as the price of the colts. 'Horse-breeding's our
best game,' says the old man, 'if they're going to pay such prices as this.
I've half a mind to start and take a lot over to Port Phillip.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 25</h2>
<p>Our next chance came through father. He was the intelligence man, and had
all the news sent to him&mdash;roundabout it might be, but it always came, and
was generally true; and the old man never troubled anybody twice that he
couldn't believe in, great things or small. Well, word was passed about a
branch bank at a place called Ballabri, where a goodish bit of gold was sent to
wait the monthly escort. There was only the manager and one clerk there now,
the other cove having gone away on sick leave. Towards the end of the month the
bank gold was heaviest and the most notes in the safe. The smartest way would
be to go into the bank just before shutting-up time&mdash;three o'clock,
about&mdash;and hand a cheque over the counter. While the clerk was looking at
it, out with a revolver and cover him. The rest was easy enough. A couple more
walked in after, and while one jumped over the counter and bailed up the
manager the other shut the door. Nothing strange about that. The door was
always shut at three o'clock sharp. Nobody in town would drop to what might be
going on inside till the whole thing was over, and the swag ready to be popped
into a light trap and cleared off with.</p>
<p>That was the idea. We had plenty of time to think it over and settle it all,
bit by bit, beforehand.</p>
<p>So one morning we started early and took the job in hand. Every little thing
was looked through and talked over a week before. Father got Mr. White's
buggy-horses ready and took Warrigal with him to a place where a man met him
with a light four-wheeled Yankee trap and harness. Dad was dressed up to look
like a back-country squatter. Lots of 'em were quite as rough-looking as he
was, though they drive as good horses as any gentleman in the land. Warrigal
was togged out something like a groom, with a bit of the station-hand about
him. Their saddles and bridles they kept with 'em in the trap; they didn't know
when they might want them. They had on their revolvers underneath their coats.
We were to go round by another road and meet at the township.</p>
<p>Well, everything turned out first-rate. When we got to Ballabri there was
father walking his horses up and down. They wanted cooling, my word. They'd
come pretty smart all the way, but they were middlin' soft, being in great
grass condition and not having done any work to speak of for a goodish while,
and being a bit above themselves in a manner of speaking. We couldn't help
laughing to see how solemn and respectable dad looked.</p>
<p>'My word,' said Jim, 'if he ain't the dead image of old Mr. Carter, of
Brahway, where we shore three years back. Just such another hard-faced,
cranky-looking old chap, ain't he, Dick? I'm that proud of him I'd do anything
he asked me now, blest if I wouldn't!'</p>
<p>'Your father's a remarkable man,' says Starlight, quite serious; 'must have
made his way in life if he hadn't shown such a dislike to anything on the
square. If he'd started a public-house and a pound about the time he turned his
mind to cattle-duffing as one of the fine arts, he'd have had a bank account by
this time that would have kept him as honest as a judge. But it's the old
story. I say, where are the police quarters? It's only manners to give them a
call.'</p>
<p>We rode over to the barracks. They weren't much. A four-roomed cottage, a
log lock-up with two cells, a four-stalled stable, and a horse-yard. Ballabri
was a small township with a few big stations, a good many farms about it, and
rather more public-houses than any other sort of buildings in it. A writing
chap said once, 'A large well-filled graveyard, a small church mostly locked
up, six public-houses, gave the principal features of Ballabri township. The
remaining ones appear to be sand, bones, and broken bottles, with a sprinkling
of inebriates and blackfellows.' With all that there was a lot of business done
there in a year by the stores and inns, particularly since the diggings.
Whatever becomes of the money made in such places? Where does it all go to?
Nobody troubles their heads about that.</p>
<p>A goodish lot of the first people was huddled away in the graveyard under
the sand ridges. Many an old shepherd had hobbled into the Travellers' Rest
with a big cheque for a fortnight's spree, and had stopped behind in the
graveyard, too, for company. It was always a wonderful place for steadying
lushingtons, was Ballabri.</p>
<p>Anyhow we rode over to the barracks because we knew the senior constable was
away. We'd got up a sham horse-stealing case the day before, through some chaps
there that we knew. This drawed him off about fifty mile. The constable left
behind was a youngish chap, and we intended to have a bit of fun with him. So
we went up to the garden-gate and called out for the officer in charge of
police quite grand.</p>
<p>'Here I am,' says he, coming out, buttoning up his uniform coat. 'Is
anything the matter?'</p>
<p>'Oh! not much,' says I; 'but there's a man sick at the Sportsman's Arms.
He's down with the typhus fever or something. He's a mate of ours, and we've
come from Mr. Grant's station. He wants a doctor fetched.'</p>
<p>'Wait a minute till I get my revolver,' says he, buttoning up his waistcoat.
He was just fresh from the depot; plucky enough, but not up to half the ways of
the bush.</p>
<p>'You'll do very well as you are,' says Starlight, bringing out his pretty
sharp, and pointing it full at his head. 'You stay there till I give you
leave.'</p>
<p>He stood there quite stunned, while Jim and I jumped off and muzzled him. He
hadn't a chance, of course, with one of us on each side, and Starlight
threatening to shoot him if he raised a finger.</p>
<p>'Let's put him in the logs,' says Jim. 'My word! just for a lark; turn for
turn. Fair play, young fellow. You're being "run in" yourself now. Don't make a
row, and no one'll hurt you.'</p>
<p>The keys were hanging up inside, so we pushed him into the farthest cell and
locked both doors. There were no windows, and the lock-up, like most bush ones,
was built of heavy logs, just roughly squared, with the ceiling the same sort,
so there wasn't much chance of his making himself heard. If any noise did come
out the town people would only think it was a drunken man, and take no
notice.</p>
<p>We lost no time then, and Starlight rode up to the bank first. It was about
ten minutes to three o'clock. Jim and I popped our horses into the police
stables, and put on a couple of their waterproof capes. The day was a little
showery. Most of the people we heard afterwards took us for troopers from some
other station on the track of bush-rangers, and not in regular uniform. It
wasn't a bad joke, though, and the police got well chaffed about it.</p>
<p>We dodged down very careless like to the bank, and went in a minute or two
after Starlight. He was waiting patiently with the cheque in his hand till some
old woman got her money. She counted it, shillings, pence, and all, and then
went out. The next moment Starlight pushed his cheque over. The clerk looks at
it for a moment, and quick-like says, 'How will you have it?'</p>
<p>'This way,' Starlight answered, pointing his revolver at his head, 'and
don't you stir or I'll shoot you before you can raise your hand.'</p>
<p>The manager's room was a small den at one side. They don't allow much room
in country banks unless they make up their mind to go in for a regular swell
building. I jumped round and took charge of the young man. Jim shut and locked
the front door while Starlight knocked at the manager's room. He came out in a
hurry, expecting to see one of the bank customers. When he saw Starlight's
revolver, his face changed quick enough, but he made a rush to his drawer where
he kept his revolver, and tried to make a fight of it, only we were too quick
for him. Starlight put the muzzle of his pistol to his forehead and swore he'd
blow out his brains there and then if he didn't stop quiet. We had to use the
same words over and over again. Jim used to grin sometimes. They generally did
the business, though, so of course he was quite helpless. We hadn't to threaten
him to find the key of the safe, because it was unlocked and the key in it. He
was just locking up his gold and the day's cash as we came in.</p>
<p>We tied him and the young fellow fast, legs and arms, and laid them down on
the floor while we went through the place. There was a good lot of gold in the
safe all weighed and labelled ready for the escort, which called there once a
month. Bundles of notes, too; bags of sovereigns, silver, and copper. The last
we didn't take. But all the rest we bundled up or put into handy boxes and bags
we found there. Father had come up by this time as close as he could to the
back-yard. We carried everything out and put them into his express-waggon; he
shoved a rug over them and drove off, quite easy and comfortable. We locked the
back door of the bank and chucked away the key, first telling the manager not
to make a row for ten minutes or we might have to come back again. He was a
plucky fellow, and we hadn't been rough with him. He had sense enough to see
that he was overmatched, and not to fight when it was no good. I've known
bankers to make a regular good fight of it, and sometimes come off best when
their places was stuck up; but not when they were bested from the very start,
like this one. No man could have had a show, if he was two or three men in one,
at the Ballabri money-shop. We walked slap down to the hotel&mdash;then it was
near the bank&mdash;and called for drinks. There weren't many people in the
streets at that time in the afternoon, and the few that did notice us didn't
think we were any one in particular. Since the diggings broke out all sorts of
travellers a little out of the common were wandering all about the
country&mdash;speculators in mines, strangers, new chums of all kinds; even the
cattle-drovers and stockmen, having their pockets full of money, began to put
on more side and dress in a flash way. The bush people didn't take half the
notice of strangers they would have done a couple of years before.</p>
<p>So we had our drinks, and shouted for the landlord and the people in the
bar; walked up to the police station, took out our horses, and rode quickly
off, while father was nearly five miles away on a cross-road, making Mr.
White's trotters do their best time, and with seven or eight thousand pounds'
worth of gold and cash under the driving seat. That, I often think, was about
the smartest trick we ever did. It makes me laugh when I remember how savage
the senior constable was when he came home, found his sub in a cell, the
manager and his clerk just untied, the bank robbed of nearly everything, and us
gone hours ago, with about as much chance of catching us as a mob of wild
cattle that got out of the yard the night before.</p>
<p>Just about dark father made the place where the man met him with the trap
before. Fresh horses was put in and the man drove slap away another road. He
and Warrigal mounted the two brown horses and took the stuff in saddle-bags,
which they'd brought with 'em. They were back at the Hollow by daylight, and we
got there about an hour afterwards. We only rode sharp for the first twenty
miles or so, and took it easier afterwards.</p>
<p>If sticking up the Goulburn mail made a noise in the country, you may depend
the Ballabri bank robbery made ten times as much. Every little newspaper and
all the big ones, from one end of the colony to the other, were full of it. The
robbery of a bank in broad daylight, almost in the middle of the day, close to
a police station, and with people going up and down the streets, seemed too
out-and-out cheeky to be believed. What was the country coming to? 'It was the
fault of the gold that unsettled young fellows' minds,' some said, 'and took
them away from honest industry.' Our minds had been unsettled long before the
gold, worse luck. Some shouted for more police protection; some for vigilance
committees; all bush-rangers and horse-thieves to be strung up to the next
tree. The whole countryside was in an uproar, except the people at the
diggings, who had most of them been in other places, and knew that, compared
with them, Australia was one of the safest countries any man could live or
travel in. A good deal of fun was made out of our locking up the constable in
his own cell. I believe he got blown up, too, and nearly dismissed by his
inspector for not having his revolver on him and ready for use. But young men
that were any good were hard to get for the police just then, and his fault was
passed over. It's a great wonder to me more banks were not robbed when you
think of it. A couple of young fellows are sent to a country place; there's no
decent buildings, or anything reasonable for them to live in, and they're
expected to take care of four or five thousand pounds and a lot of gold, as if
it was so many bags of potatoes. If there's police, they're half their time
away. The young fellows can't be all their time in the house, and two or three
determined men, whether they're bush-rangers or not, that like to black their
faces, and walk in at any time that they're not expected, can sack the whole
thing, and no trouble to them. I call it putting temptation in people's way,
and some of the blame ought to go on the right shoulders. As I said before, the
little affair made a great stir, and all the police in the country were round
Ballabri for a bit, tracking and tracking till all hours, night and day; but
they couldn't find out what had become of the wheel-marks, nor where our horse
tracks led to. The man that owned the express waggon drove it into a scrubby
bit of country and left it there; he knew too much to take it home. Then he
brought away the wheels one by one on horseback, and carted the body in a long
time after with a load of wool, just before a heavy rain set in and washed out
every track as clean as a whistle.</p>
<p>Nothing in that year could keep people's thoughts long away from the
diggings, which was just as well for us. Everything but the gold was forgotten
after a week. If the harbour had dried up or Sydney town been buried by an
earthquake, nobody would have bothered themselves about such trifles so long as
the gold kept turning up hand over hand the way it did. There seemed no end to
it. New diggings jumped up every day, and now another big rush broke out in
Port Phillip that sent every one wilder than ever.</p>
<p>Starlight and us two often used to have a quiet talk about Melbourne. We all
liked that side of the country; there seemed an easier chance of getting
straight away from there than any part of New South Wales, where so many people
knew us and everybody was on the look-out.</p>
<p>All kinds of things passed through our minds, but the notion we liked best
was taking one of the gold ships bodily and sailing her away to a foreign port,
where her name could be changed, and she never heard of again, if all went
well. That would be a big touch and no mistake. Starlight, who had been at sea,
and was always ready for anything out of the way and uncommon, the more
dangerous the better, thought it might be done without any great risk or
bother.</p>
<p>'A ship in harbour,' he said, 'is something like the Ballabri bank. No one
expects anything to happen in harbour, consequently there's no watch kept or
any look-out that's worth much. Any sudden dash with a few good men and she'd
be off and out to sea before any one could say "knife".'</p>
<p>Father didn't like this kind of talk. He was quite satisfied where we were.
We were safe there, he said; and, as long as we kept our heads, no one need
ever be the wiser how it was we always seemed to go through the ground and no
one could follow us up. What did we fret after? Hadn't we everything we wanted
in the world&mdash;plenty of good grub, the best of liquor, and the pick of the
countryside for horses, besides living among our own friends and in the country
we were born in, and that had the best right to keep us. If we once got among
strangers and in another colony we should be 'given away' by some one or other,
and be sure to come to grief in the long run.</p>
<p>Well, we couldn't go and cut out this ship all at once, but Jim and I didn't
leave go of the notion, and we had many a yarn with Starlight about it when we
were by ourselves.</p>
<p>What made us more set upon clearing out of the country was that we were
getting a good bit of money together, and of course we hadn't much chance of
spending it. Every place where we'd been seen was that well watched there was
no getting nigh it, and every now and then a strong mob of police, ordered down
by telegraph, would muster at some particular spot where they thought there was
a chance of surrounding us. However, that dodge wouldn't work. They couldn't
surround the Hollow. It was too big, and the gullies between the rocks too
deep. You could see across a place sometimes that you had to ride miles round
to get over. Besides, no one knew there was such a place, leastways that we
were there, any more than if we had been in New Zealand.</p>
<h2>Chapter 26</h2>
<p>After the Ballabri affair we had to keep close for weeks and weeks. The
whole place seemed to be alive with police. We heard of them being on Nulla
Mountain and close enough to the Hollow now and then. But Warrigal and father
had places among the rocks where they could sit up and see everything for miles
round. Dad had taken care to get a good glass, too, and he could sweep the
country round about almost down to Rocky Flat. Warrigal's eyes were sharp
enough without a glass, and he often used to tell us he seen things&mdash;men,
cattle, and horses&mdash;that we couldn't make out a bit in the world. We
amused ourselves for a while the best way we could by horse-breaking, shooting,
and what not; but we began to get awful tired of it, and ready for anything, no
matter what, that would make some sort of change.</p>
<p>One day father told us a bit of news that made a stir in the camp, and
nearly would have Jim and me clear out altogether if we'd had any place to go
to. For some time past, it seems, dad had been grumbling about being left to
himself so much, and, except this last fakement, not having anything to do with
the road work. 'It's all devilish fine for you and your brother and the Captain
there to go flashin' about the country and sporting your figure on horseback,
while I'm left alone to do the housekeepin' in the Hollow. I'm not going to be
wood-and-water Joey, I can tell ye, not for you nor no other men. So I've made
it right with a couple of chaps as I've know'd these years past, and we can do
a touch now and then, as well as you grand gentlemen, on the "high toby", as
they call it where I came from.'</p>
<p>'I didn't think you were such an old fool, Ben,' said Starlight; 'but
keeping this place here a dead secret is our sheet-anchor. Lose that, and we'll
be run into in a week. If you let it out to any fellow you come across, you
will soon know all about it.'</p>
<p>'I've known Dan Moran and Pat Burke nigh as long as I've known you, for the
matter of that,' says father. 'They're safe enough, and they're not to come
here or know where I hang out neither. We've other places to meet, and what we
do 'll be clean done, I'll go bail.'</p>
<p>'It doesn't matter two straws to me, as I've told you many a time,' said
Starlight, lighting a cigar (he always kept a good supply of them). 'But you
see if Dick and Jim, now, don't suffer for it before long.'</p>
<p>'It was as I told you about the place, wasn't it?' growls father; 'don't you
suppose I know how to put a man right? I look to have my turn at steering this
here ship, or else the crew better go ashore for good.'</p>
<p>Father had begun to drink harder now than he used; that was partly the
reason. And when he'd got his liquor aboard he was that savage and obstinate
there was no doing anything with him. We couldn't well part. We couldn't afford
to do without each other. So we had to patch it up the best way we could, and
let him have his own way. But we none of us liked the new-fangled way, and made
sure bad would come of it.</p>
<p>We all knew the two men, and didn't half like them. They were the head men
of a gang that mostly went in for horse-stealing, and only did a bit of regular
bush-ranging when they was sure of getting clear off. They'd never shown out
the fighting way yet, though they were ready enough for it if it couldn't be
helped.</p>
<p>Moran was a dark, thin, wiry-looking native chap, with a big beard, and a
nasty beady black eye like a snake's. He was a wonderful man outside of a
horse, and as active as a cat, besides being a deal stronger than any one would
have taken him to be. He had a drawling way of talking, and was one of those
fellows that liked a bit of cruelty when he had the chance. I believe he'd
rather shoot any one than not, and when he was worked up he was more like a
devil than a man. Pat Burke was a broad-shouldered, fair-complexioned fellow,
most like an Englishman, though he was a native too. He'd had a small station
once, and might have done well (I was going to say) if he'd had sense enough to
go straight. What rot it all is! Couldn't we all have done well, if the devils
of idleness and easy-earned money and false pride had let us alone?</p>
<p>Father said his bargain with these chaps was that he should send down to
them when anything was up that more men was wanted for, and they was always to
meet him at a certain place. He said they'd be satisfied with a share of
whatever the amount was, and that they'd never want to be shown the Hollow or
to come anigh it. They had homes and places of their own, and didn't want to be
known more than could be helped. Besides this, if anything turned up that was
real first chop, they could always find two or three more young fellows that
would stand a flutter, and disappear when the job was done. This was worth
thinking over, he said, because there weren't quite enough of us for some
things, and we could keep these other chaps employed at outside work.</p>
<p>There was something in this, of course, and dad was generally near the mark,
there or thereabouts, so we let things drift. One thing was that these chaps
could often lay their hands upon a goodish lot of horses or cattle; and if they
delivered them to any two of us twenty miles from the Hollow, they could be
popped in there, and neither they or any one else the wiser. You see father
didn't mind taking a hand in the bush-ranging racket, but his heart was with
the cattle and horse-duffing that he'd been used to so long, and he couldn't
quite give it up. It's my belief he'd have sooner made a ten-pound note by an
unbranded colt or a mob of fat cattle than five times as much in any other way.
Every man to his taste, they say.</p>
<p>Well, between this new fad of the old man's and our having a notion that we
had better keep quiet for a spell and let things settle down a bit, we had a
long steady talk, and the end of it was that we made up our minds to go and put
in a month or two at the diggings.</p>
<p>We took a horse apiece that weren't much account, so we could either sell
them or lose them, it did not make much odds which, and made a start for
Jonathan Barnes's place. We got word from him every now and then, and knew that
the police had never found out that we had been there, going or coming.
Jonathan was a blowing, blatherskiting fool; but his very foolishness in that
way made them think he knew nothing at all. He had just sense enough not to
talk about us, and they never thought about asking him. So we thought we'd have
a bit of fun there before we settled down for work at the Turon. We took old
saddles and bridles, and had a middling-sized swag in front, just as if we'd
come a long way. We dressed pretty rough too; we had longish hair and beards,
and (except Starlight) might have been easy taken for down-the-river stockmen
or drovers.</p>
<p>When we got to Barnes's place he and the old woman seemed ever so glad to
see us. Bella and Maddie rushed out, making a great row, and chattering both at
a time.</p>
<p>'Why, we thought you were lost, or shot, or something,' Bella says. 'You
might have sent us a letter, or a message, only I suppose you didn't think it
worth while.'</p>
<p>'What a bad state the country's getting in,' says Maddie. 'Think of them
bush-rangers sticking up the bank at Ballabri, and locking up the constable in
his own cell. Ha! ha! The police magistrate was here to-night. You should have
heard Bella talking so nice and proper to him about it.'</p>
<p>'Yes, and you said they'd all be caught and hanged,' said Bella; 'that it
was settin' such a bad example to the young men of the colony. My word! it was
as good as a play. Mad was so full of her fun, and when the P.M. said they'd be
sure to be caught in the long run, Maddie said they'd have to import some
thoroughbred police to catch 'em, for our Sydney-side ones didn't seem to have
pace enough. This made the old gentleman stare, and he looked at Maddie as if
she was out of her mind. Didn't he, Mad?'</p>
<p>'I do think it's disgraceful of Goring and his lot not to have run them in
before,' says Starlight, 'but it wouldn't do for us to interfere.'</p>
<p>'Ah! but Sir Ferdinand Morringer's come up now,' says Maddie. 'He'll begin
to knock saucepans out of all the boys between here and Weddin Mountain. He was
here, too, and asked us a lot of questions about people who were "wanted" in
these parts.'</p>
<p>'He fell in love with Maddie, too,' says Bella, 'and gave her one of the
charms of his watch chain&mdash;such a pretty one, too. He's going to catch
Starlight's mob, as he calls them. Maddie says she'll send him word if ever she
knows of their being about.'</p>
<p>'Well done, Maddie!' says Jim; 'so you may, just an hour or two after we're
started. There won't be much likelihood of his overhauling us then. He won't be
the first man that's been fooled by a woman, will he?'</p>
<p>'Or the last, Jim,' says Bella. 'What do you say, Captain? It seems to me
we're doing all the talking, and you're doing all the listening. That isn't
fair, you know. We like to hear ourselves talk, but fair play is bonny play.
Suppose you tell us what you've been about all this time. I think tea's
ready.'</p>
<p>We had our innings in the talking line; Jim and Maddie made noise enough for
half-a-dozen. Starlight let himself be talked to, and didn't say much himself;
but I could see even he, that had seen a lot of high life in his time, was
pleased enough with the nonsense of a couple of good-looking girls like
these&mdash;regular bush-bred fillies as they were&mdash;after being shut up in
the Hollow for a month or two.</p>
<p>Before we'd done a couple of travellers rode up. Jonathan's place was
getting a deal more custom now&mdash;it lay near about the straight line for
the Turon, and came to be known as a pretty comfortable shop. Jonathan came in
with them, and gave us a wink as much as to say, 'It's all right.'</p>
<p>'These gentlemen's just come up from Sydney,' he said, 'not long from
England, and wants to see the diggings. I told 'em you might be going that way,
and could show 'em the road.'</p>
<p>'Very happy,' says Starlight. 'I am from Port Phillip last myself, and think
of going back by Honolulu after I've made the round of the colonies. My good
friends and travelling companions are on their way for the Darling. We can all
travel together.'</p>
<p>'What a fortunate thing we came here, Clifford, eh?' says one young fellow,
putting up his eyeglass. 'You wanted to push on. Now we shall have company, and
not lose our way in this beastly "bush", as they call it.'</p>
<p>'Well, it does look like luck,' says the other man. 'I was beginning to
think the confounded place was getting farther off every day. Can you show us
our rooms, if you please? I suppose we couldn't have a bath?'</p>
<p>'Oh yes, you can,' said Maddie; 'there's the creek at the bottom of the
garden, only there's snakes now and then at night. I'll get you towels.'</p>
<p>'In that case I think I shall prefer to wait till the morning,' says the
tall man. 'It will be something to look forward to.'</p>
<p>We were afraid the strangers would have spoiled our fun for the evening, but
they didn't; we made out afterwards that the tall one was a lord. They were
just like anybody else, and when we got the piano to work after tea they made
themselves pleasant enough, and Starlight sang a song or two&mdash;he could
sing, and no mistake, when he liked&mdash;and then one of them played a waltz
and the girls danced together, and Starlight had some champagne in, said it was
his birthday, and he'd just thought of it, and they got quite friendly and
jolly before we turned in.</p>
<p>Next day we made a start, promising the girls a nugget each for a ring out
of the first gold we got, and they promised to write to us and tell us if they
heard any news. They knew what to say, and we shouldn't be caught simple if
they could help it. Jim took care, though, to keep well off the road, and take
all the short cuts he knew. We weren't quite safe till we was in the thick of
the mining crowd. That's the best place for a man, or woman either, to hide
that wants to drop out of sight and never be seen again. Many a time I've known
a man, called Jack or Tom among the diggers, and never thought of as anything
else, working like them, drinking and taking his pleasure and dressing like
them, till he made his pile or died, or something, and then it turned out he
was the Honourable Mr. So-and-So, Captain This, or Major That; perhaps the
Reverend Somebody&mdash;though that didn't happen often.</p>
<p>We were all the more contented, though, when we heard the row of the cradles
and the clang and bang of the stampers in the quartz-crushing batteries again,
and saw the big crowd moving up and down like a hill of ants, the same as when
we'd left Turon last. As soon as we got into the main street we parted. Jim and
I touched our hats and said good-bye to Starlight and the other two, who went
away to the crack hotel. We went and made a camp down by the creek, so that we
might turn to and peg out a claim, or buy out a couple of shares, first thing
in the morning.</p>
<p>Except the Hollow it was the safest place in the whole country just now, as
we could hear that every week fresh people were pouring in from all the other
colonies, and every part of the world. The police on the diggings had their own
work pretty well cut out for them, what with old hands from Van Diemen's Land,
Californians&mdash;and, you may bet, roughs and rascals from every place under
the sun. Besides, we wanted to see for ourselves how the thing was done, and
pick up a few wrinkles that might come in handy afterwards. Our dodge was to
take a few notes with us, and buy into a claim&mdash;one here, one
there&mdash;not to keep together for fear of consequences. If we worked and
kept steady at it, in a place where there were thousands of strangers of all
kinds, it would take the devil himself to pick us out of such a queer,
bubbling, noisy, mixed-up pot of hell-broth.</p>
<p>Things couldn't have dropped in more lucky for us than they did. In this
way. Starlight was asked by the two swells to join them, because they wanted to
do a bit of digging, just for the fun of it; and he made out he'd just come
from Melbourne, and hadn't been six months longer in the country than they had.
Of course he was sunburnt a bit. He got that in India, he said. My word! they
played just into his hand, and he did the new-chum swell all to pieces, and so
that natural no one could have picked him out from them. He dressed like them,
talked like them, and never let slip a word except about shooting in England,
hunting in America and India, besides gammoning to be as green about all
Australian ways as if he'd never seen a gum tree before. They took up a claim,
and bought a tent. Then they got a wages-man to help them, and all four used to
work like niggers. The crowd christened them 'The Three Honourables', and used
to have great fun watching them working away in their jerseys, and handling
their picks and shovels like men. Starlight used to drawl just like the other
two, and asked questions about the colony; and walk about with them on Sundays
and holidays in fashionable cut clothes. He'd brought money, too, and paid his
share of the expenses, and something over. It was a great sight to see at
night, and people said like nothing else in the world just then. Every one
turned out for an hour or two at night, and then was the time to see the Turon
in its glory. Big, sunburnt men, with beards, and red silk sashes round their
waists, with a sheath-knife and revolvers mostly stuck in them, and
broad-leaved felt hats on. There were Californians, then foreigners of all
sorts&mdash;Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, Spaniards, Greeks, Negroes, Indians,
Chinamen. They were a droll, strange, fierce-looking crowd. There weren't many
women at first, but they came pretty thick after a bit. A couple of theatres
were open, a circus, hotels with lots of plate-glass windows and splendid bars,
all lighted up, and the front of them, anyhow, as handsome at first sight as
Sydney or Melbourne. Drapers and grocers, ironmongers, general stores, butchers
and bakers, all kept open until midnight, and every place was lighted up as
clear as day. It was like a fairy-story place, Jim said; he was as pleased as a
child with the glitter and show and strangeness of it all. Nobody was poor,
everybody was well dressed, and had money to spend, from the children upwards.
Liquor seemed running from morning to night, as if there were creeks of it; all
the same there was very little drunkenness and quarrelling. The police kept
good order, and the miners were their own police mostly, and didn't seem to
want keeping right. We always expected the miners to be a disorderly, rough set
of people&mdash;it was quite the other way. Only we had got into a world where
everybody had everything they wanted, or else had the money to pay for it. How
different it seemed from the hard, grinding, poverty-stricken life we had been
brought up to, and all the settlers we knew when we were young! People had to
work hard for every pound they made then, and, if they hadn't the ready cash,
obliged to do without, even if it was bread to eat. Many a time we'd had no tea
and sugar when we were little, because father hadn't the money to pay for it.
That was when he stayed at home and worked for what he got. Well, it was honest
money, at any rate&mdash;pity he hadn't kept that way.</p>
<p>Now all this was changed. It wasn't like the same country. Everybody dressed
well, lived high, and the money never ran short, nor was likely to as long as
the gold kept spreading, and was found in 10, 20, 50 pound nuggets every week
or two. We had a good claim, and began to think about six months' work would
give us enough to clear right away with. We let our hair grow long, and made
friends with some Americans, so we began to talk a little like them, just for
fun, and most people took us for Yankees. We didn't mind that. Anything was
better than being taken for what we were. And if we could get clear off to San
Francisco there were lots of grand new towns springing up near the Rocky
Mountains, where a man could live his life out peaceably, and never be heard of
again.</p>
<p>As for Starlight he'd laid it out with his two noble friends to go back to
Sydney in two or three months, and run down to Honolulu in one of the trading
vessels. They could get over to the Pacific slope, or else have a year among
the Islands, and go anywhere they pleased. They had got that fond of Haughton,
as he called himself&mdash;Frank Haughton&mdash;that nothing would have
persuaded them to part company. And wasn't he a man to be fond of?&mdash;always
ready for anything, always good-tempered except when people wouldn't let him,
ready to work or fight or suffer hardship, if it came to that, just as cheerful
as he went to his dinner&mdash;never thinking or talking much about himself,
but always there when he was wanted. You couldn't have made a more out-and-out
all round man to live and die with; and yet, wasn't it a murder, that there
should be that against him, when it came out, that spoiled the whole lot? We
used to meet now and then, but never noticed one another except by a bit of a
nod or a wink, in public. One day Jim and I were busy puddling some dirt, and
we saw Sergeant Goring ride by with another trooper. He looked at us, but we
were splashed with yellow mud, and had handkerchiefs tied over our heads. I
don't think mother would have known us. He just glanced over at us and took no
notice. If he didn't know us there was no fear of any one else being that sharp
to do it. So we began to take it easy, and to lose our fear of being dropped on
at any time. Ours was a middling good claim, too; two men's ground; and we were
lucky from the start. Jim took to the pick and shovel work from the first, and
was as happy as a man could be.</p>
<p>After our day's work we used to take a stroll through the lighted streets at
night. What a place it had grown to be, and how different it was from being by
ourselves at the Hollow. The gold was coming in that fast that it paid people
to build more shops, and bring up goods from Sydney every week, until there
wasn't any mortal thing you couldn't get there for money. Everything was dear,
of course; but everybody had money, and nobody minded paying two prices when
they were washing, perhaps, two or three pounds' weight of gold out of a tub of
dirt.</p>
<p>One night Jim and I were strolling about with some of our Yankee friends,
when some one said there'd been a new hotel opened by some Melbourne people
which was very swell, and we might take a look at it. We didn't say no, so we
all went into the parlour and called for drinks. The landlady herself came in,
dressed up to the nines, and made herself agreeable, as she might well do. We
were all pretty well in, but one of the Americans owned the Golden Gate claim,
and was supposed to be the richest man on the field. He'd known her before.</p>
<p>'Waal, Mrs. Mullockson,' says he, 'so you've pulled up stakes from Bendigo
City and concluded to locate here. How do you approbate Turon?'</p>
<p>She said something or other, we hardly knew what. Jim and I couldn't help
giving one look. Her eyes turned on us. We could see she knew us, though she
hadn't done so at first. We took no notice; no more did she, but she followed
us to the door, and touched me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>'You're not going to desert old friends, Dick?' she said in a low voice. 'I
wrote you a cross letter, but we must forgive and forget, you know. You and Jim
come up to-morrow night, won't you?'</p>
<p>'All right, Kate,' I said, and we followed our party.</p>
<h2>Chapter 27</h2>
<p>This meeting with Kate Morrison put the stuns upon me and Jim, and no
mistake. We never expected to see her up at the Turon, and it all depended
which way the fit took her now whether it would be a fit place for us to live
in any longer. Up to this time we had done capital well. We had been planted as
close as if we had been at the Hollow. We'd had lots of work, and company, and
luck. It began to look as if our luck would be dead out. Anyhow, we were at the
mercy of a tiger-cat of a woman who might let loose her temper at any time and
lay the police on to us, without thinking twice about it. We didn't think she
knew Starlight was there, but she was knowing enough for anything. She could
put two and two together, and wait and watch, too. It gave me a fit of the
shivers every time I thought of it. This was the last place I ever expected to
see her at. However, you never can tell what'll turn up in this world. She
might have got over her tantrums.</p>
<p>Of course we went over to the Prospectors' Arms that night, as the new hotel
was called, and found quite a warm welcome. Mrs. Mullockson had turned into
quite a fashionable lady since the Melbourne days; dressed very grand, and
talked and chaffed with the commissioner, the police inspectors, and goldfield
officers from the camp as if she'd been brought up to it. People lived fast in
those goldfields days; it don't take long to pick up that sort of learning.</p>
<p>The Prospectors' Arms became quite the go, and all the swell miners and
quartz reefers began to meet there as a matter of course. There was Dandy
Green, the Lincolnshire man from Beevor, that used to wear no end of boots and
spend pounds and pounds in blacking. He used to turn out with everything clean
on every morning, fit to go to a ball, as he walked on to the brace. There was
Ballersdorf, the old Prussian soldier, that had fought against Boney, and owned
half-a-dozen crushing machines and a sixth share in the Great Wattle Flat
Company; Dan Robinson, the man that picked up the 70 pound nugget; Sam Dawson,
of White Hills, and Peter Paul, the Canadian, with a lot of others, all known
men, went there regular. Some of them didn't mind spending fifty or a hundred
pounds in a night if the fit took them. The house began to do a tremendous
trade, and no mistake.</p>
<p>Old Mullockson was a quiet, red-faced old chap, who seemed to do all Kate
told him, and never bothered himself about the business, except when he had to
buy fresh supplies in the wine and spirit line. There he was first chop. You
couldn't lick him for quality. And so the place got a name.</p>
<p>But where was Jeanie all this time? That was what Jim put me up to ask the
first night we came. 'Oh! Jeanie, poor girl, she was stopping with her aunt in
Melbourne.' But Kate had written to her, and she was coming up in a few weeks.
This put Jim into great heart. What with the regular work and the doing well in
the gold line, and Jeanie coming up, poor old Jim looked that happy that he was
a different man. No wonder the police didn't know him. He had grown out of his
old looks and ways; and though they rubbed shoulders with us every day, no one
had eyes sharp enough to see that James Henderson and his brother
Dick&mdash;mates with the best men on the field&mdash;were escaped prisoners,
and had a big reward on them besides.</p>
<p>Nobody knew it, and that was pretty nigh as good as if it wasn't true. So we
held on, and made money hand over fist. We used to go up to the hotel whenever
we'd an evening to spare, but that wasn't often. We intended to keep our money
this time, and no publican was to be any the better for our hard work.</p>
<p>As for Kate, I couldn't make her out. Most times she'd be that pleasant and
jolly no one could help liking her. She had a way of talking to me and telling
me everything that happened, because I was an old friend she said&mdash;that
pretty nigh knocked me over, I tell you. Other times she was that savage and
violent no one would go near her. She didn't care who it was&mdash;servants or
customers, they all gave her a wide berth when she was in her tantrums. As for
old Mullockson, he used to take a drive to Sawpit Gully or Ten-Mile as soon as
ever he saw what o'clock it was&mdash;and glad to clear out, too. She never
dropped on to me, somehow. Perhaps she thought she'd get as good as she gave; I
wasn't over good to lead, and couldn't be drove at the best of times. No! not
by no woman that ever stepped.</p>
<p>One evening Starlight and his two swell friends comes in, quite accidental
like. They sat down at a small table by themselves and ordered a couple of
bottles of foreign wine. There was plenty of that if you liked to pay a guinea
a bottle. I remember when common brandy was that price at first, and I've seen
it fetched out of a doctor's tent as medicine. It paid him better than his
salts and rhubarb. That was before the hotels opened, and while all the grog
was sold on the sly. They marched in, dressed up as if they'd been in George
Street, though everybody knew one of 'em had been at the windlass all day with
the wages man, and the other two below, working up to their knees in water; for
they'd come on a drift in their claim, and were puddling back. However, that
says nothing; we were all in good clothes and fancy shirts and ties. Miners
don't go about in their working suits. The two Honourables walked over to the
bar first of all, and said a word or two to Kate, who was all smiles and as
pleasant as you please. It was one of her good days. Starlight put up his
eyeglass and stared round as if we were all a lot of queer animals out of a
caravan. Then he sat down and took up the 'Turon Star'. Kate hardly looked at
him, she was so taken up with his two friends, and, woman-like, bent on drawing
them on, knowing them to be big swells in their own country. We never looked
his way, except on the sly, and no one could have thought we'd ever slept under
one tree together, or seen the things we had.</p>
<p>When the waiter was opening their wine one of the camp officers comes in
that they had letters to. So they asked him to join them, and Starlight sends
for another bottle of Moselle&mdash;something like that, he called it.</p>
<p>'The last time I drank wine as good as this,' says Starlight, 'was at the
Caffy Troy, something or other, in Paris. I wouldn't mind being there again,
with the Variety Theatre to follow. Would you, Clifford?'</p>
<p>'Well, I don't know,' says the other swell. 'I find this amazing good fun
for a bit. I never was in such grand condition since I left Oxford. This
eight-hours' shift business is just the right thing for training. I feel fit to
go for a man's life. Just feel this, Despard,' and he holds out his arm to the
camp swell. 'There's muscle for you!'</p>
<p>'Plenty of muscle,' said Mr. Despard, looking round. He was a swell that
didn't work, and wouldn't work, and thought it fine to treat the diggers like
dogs. Most of the commissioners and magistrates were gentlemen and acted as
such; but there were a few young fools like this one, and they did the
Government a deal of harm with the diggers more than they knew. 'Plenty of
muscle,' says he, 'but devilish little society.'</p>
<p>'I don't agree with you,' says the other Honourable. 'It's the most amusing
and in a way instructive place for a man who wants to know his fellow-creatures
I was ever in. I never pass a day without meeting some fresh variety of the
human race, man or woman; and their experiences are well worth knowing, I can
tell you. Not that they're in a hurry to impart them; for that there's more
natural, unaffected good manners on a digging than in any society I ever
mingled in I shall never doubt. But when they see you don't want to patronise,
and are content to be a simple man among men, there's nothing they won't do for
you or tell you.'</p>
<p>'Oh, d&mdash;n one's fellow-creatures; present company excepted,' says Mr.
Despard, filling his glass, 'and the man that grew this "tipple". They're
useful to me now and then and one has to put up with this crowd; but I never
could take much interest in them.'</p>
<p>'All the worse for you, Despard,' says Clifford. 'You're wasting your
chances&mdash;golden opportunities in every sense of the word. You'll never see
such a spectacle as this, perhaps, again as long as you live. It's a fancy
dress ball with real characters.'</p>
<p>'Dashed bad characters, if we only knew,' says Despard, yawning. 'What do
you say, Haughton?' looking at Starlight, who was playing with his glass and
not listening much by the look of him.</p>
<p>'I say, let's go into the little parlour and have a game of picquet, unless
you'll take some more wine. No? Then we'll move. Bad characters, you were
saying? Well, you camp fellows ought to be able to give an opinion.'</p>
<p>They sauntered through the big room, which was just then crowded with a
curious company, as Clifford said. I suppose there was every kind of man and
miner under the sun. Not many women, but what there was not a little out of the
way in looks and manners. We kept on working away all the time. It helped to
stop us from thinking, and every week we had a bigger deposit-receipt in the
bank where we used to sell our gold. People may say what they like, but there's
nothing like a nest egg; seeing it grow bigger keeps many a fellow straight,
and he gets to like adding to it, and feels the pull of being careful with his
money, which a poor man that never has anything worth saving doesn't. Poor men
are the most extravagant, I've always found. They spend all they have, which
middling kind of people just above them don't. They screw and pinch to bring up
their children, and what not; and dress shabby and go without a lot which the
working man never thinks of stinting himself in. But there's the parson here to
do that kind of thing. I'm not the proper sort of cove to preach. I'd better
leave it to him. So we didn't spend our money foolish, like most part of the
diggers that had a bit of luck; but we had to do a fair thing. We got through a
lot of money every week, I expect. Talking of foolish things, I saw one man
that had his horse shod with gold, regular pure gold shoes. The blacksmith made
'em&mdash;good solid ones, and all regular. He rode into the main street one
holiday, and no end of people stopped him and lifted up his horse's feet to
see. They weighed 7 oz. 4 dwt. each. Rainbow ought to have been shod that way.
If ever a horse deserved it he did. But Starlight didn't go in for that kind of
thing. Now and then some of the old colonial hands, when they were regularly
'on the burst', would empty a dozen of champagne into a bucket or light their
pipes with a ten-pound note. But these were not everyday larks, and were
laughed at by the diggers themselves as much as anybody.</p>
<p>But of course some allowance had to be made for men not making much above
wages when they came suddenly on a biggish stone, and sticking the pick into it
found it to be a gigantic nugget worth a small fortune. Most men would go a bit
mad over a stroke of luck like that, and they did happen now and then. There
was the Boennair nugget, dug at Louisa Creek by an Irishman, that weighed 364
oz. 11 dwt. It was sold in Sydney for &pound;1156. There was the King of Meroo
nugget, weighing 157 oz.; and another one that only scaled 71 oz. seemed hardly
worth picking up after the others, only &pound;250 worth or so. But there was a
bigger one yet on the grass if we'd only known, and many a digger, and shepherd
too, had sat down on it and lit his pipe, thinking it no better than other
lumps of blind white quartz that lay piled up all along the crown of the
ride.</p>
<p>Mostly after we'd done our day's work and turned out clean and comfortable
after supper, smoking our pipes, we walked up the street for an hour or two.
Jim and I used to laugh a bit in a queer way over the change it was from our
old bush life at Rocky Flat when we were boys, before we had any thoughts
beyond doing our regular day's work and milking the cows and chopping wood
enough to last mother all day. The little creek, that sounded so clear in the
still night when we woke up, rippling and gurgling over the stones, the silent,
dark forest all round on every side; and on moonlight nights the moon shining
over Nulla Mountain, dark and overhanging all the valley, as if it had been
sailing in the clear sky over it ever since the beginning of the world. We
didn't smoke then, and we used to sit in the verandah, and Aileen would talk to
us till it was time to go to bed.</p>
<p>Even when we went into Bargo, or some of the other country towns, they did
not seem so much brighter. Sleepy-looking, steady-going places they all were,
with people crawling about them like a lot of old working bullocks. Just about
as sensible, many of 'em. What a change all this was! Main Street at the Turon!
Just as bright as day at twelve o'clock at night. Crowds walking up and down,
bars lighted up, theatres going on, dance-houses in full swing, billiard-tables
where you could hear the balls clicking away till daylight; miners walking down
to their night shifts, others turning out after sleeping all the afternoon
quite fresh and lively; half-a-dozen troopers clanking down the street, back
from escort duty. Everybody just as fresh at midnight as at breakfast
time&mdash;more so, perhaps. It was a new world.</p>
<p>One thing's certain; Jim and I would never have had the chance of seeing as
many different kinds of people in a hundred years if it hadn't been for the
gold. No wonder some of the young fellows kicked over the traces for a
change&mdash;a change from sheep, cattle, and horses, ploughing and reaping,
shearing and bullock-driving; the same old thing every day; the same chaps to
talk to about the same things. It does seem a dead-and-live kind of life after
all we've seen and done since. However, we'd a deal better have kept to the
bulldog's motter, 'Hang on', and stick to it, even if it was a shade slow and
stupid. We'd have come out right in the end, as all coves do that hold fast to
the right thing and stick to the straight course, fair weather or foul. I can
see that now, and many things else.</p>
<p>But to see the big room at the Prospectors' Arms at night&mdash;the hall,
they called it&mdash;was a sight worth talking about&mdash;as Jim and I walked
up and down, or sat at one of the small tables smoking our pipes, with good
liquor before us. It was like a fairy-tale come true to chaps like us, though
we had seen a little life in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>What made it so different from any other place we'd ever seen or thought of
before was the strange mixture of every kind and sort of man and woman; to hear
them all jabbering away together in different languages, or trying to speak
English, used to knock us altogether. The American diggers that we took up with
had met a lot of foreigners in California and other places. They could speak a
little Spanish and French, and got on with them. But Jim and I could only stare
and stand open-mouthed when a Spanish-American chap would come up with his red
sash and his big sheath-knife, while they'd yabber away quite comfortable.</p>
<p>It made us feel like children, and we began to think what a fine thing it
would be to clear out by Honolulu, and so on to San Francisco, as Starlight was
always talking about. It would make men of us, at any rate, and give us
something to think about in the days to come.</p>
<p>If we could clear out what a heaven it would be! I could send over for
Gracey to come to me. I knew she'd do that, if I was only once across the sea,
ready and willing to lead a new life, and with something honest-earned and
hard-worked-for to buy a farm with. Nobody need know. Nobody would even inquire
in the far West where we'd come from or what we'd done. We should live close
handy to one another&mdash;Jim and Jeanie, Gracey and I&mdash;and when dad went
under, mother and Aileen could come out to us; and there would still be a
little happiness left us, for all that was come and gone. Ah! if things would
only work out that way.</p>
<p>Well, more unlikely things happen every day. And still the big room gets
fuller. There's a band strikes up in the next room and the dancing begins. This
is a ball night. Kate has started that game. She's a great hand at dancing
herself, and she manages to get a few girls to come up; wherever they come from
nobody knows, for there's none to be seen in the daytime. But they turn out
wonderfully well-dressed, and some of them mighty good-looking; and the young
swells from the camp come down, and the diggers that have been lucky and begin
to fancy themselves. And there's no end of fun and flirting and nonsense, such
as there always is when men and women get together in a place where they're not
obliged to be over-particular. Not that there was any rowdiness or bad
behaviour allowed. A goldfield is the wrong shop for that. Any one that didn't
behave himself would have pretty soon found himself on his head in the street,
and lucky if he came out of it with whole bones.</p>
<p>I once tried to count the different breeds and languages of the men in the
big room one night. I stopped at thirty. There were Germans, Swedes, Danes,
Norwegians, Russians, Italians, Greeks, Jews, Spaniards, Frenchmen, Maltese,
Mexicans, Negroes, Indians, Chinamen, New Zealanders, English, Irish, Scotch,
Welsh, Australians, Americans, Canadians, Creoles, gentle and simple, farmers
and labourers, squatters and shepherds, lawyers and doctors. They were all
alike for a bit, all pretty rich; none poor, or likely to be; all workers and
comrades; nobody wearing much better clothes or trying to make out he was
higher than anybody else. Everybody was free with his money. If a fellow was
sick or out of luck, or his family was down with fever, the notes came
freely&mdash;as many as were wanted, and more when that was done. There was no
room for small faults and vices; everything and everybody was worked on a high
scale. It was a grand time&mdash;better than ever was in our country before or
since. Jim and I always said we felt better men while the flash time lasted,
and hadn't a thought of harm or evil about us. We worked hard enough, too, as I
said before; but we had good call to do so. Every week when we washed up we
found ourselves a lot forrarder, and could see that if it held on like this for
a few months more we should have made our 'pile', as the diggers called it, and
be able to get clear off without much bother.</p>
<p>Because it wasn't now as it was in the old times, when Government could
afford to keep watch upon every vessel, big and little, that left the harbour.
Now there was no end of trouble in getting sailors to man the ships, and we
could have worked our passage easy enough; they'd have taken us and welcome,
though we'd never handled a rope in our lives before. Besides that, there were
hundreds of strangers starting for Europe and America by every vessel that
left. Men who had come out to the colony expecting to pick up gold in the
streets, and had gone home disgusted; lucky men, too, like ourselves, who had
sworn to start for home the very moment they had made a fair thing. How were
any police in the world to keep the run of a few men that had been in trouble
before among such a mixed-up mob?</p>
<p>Now and then we managed to get a talk with Starlight on the sly. He used to
meet us at a safe place by night, and talk it all over. He and his mates were
doing well, and expected to be ready for a start in a few months, when we might
meet in Melbourne and clear out together. He believed it would be easy, and
said that our greatest danger of being recognised was now over&mdash;that we
had altered so much by living and working among the diggers that we could pass
for diggers anywhere.</p>
<p>'Why, we were all dining at the Commissioner's yesterday,' he said, 'when
who should walk in but our old friend Goring. He's been made inspector now;
and, of course, he's a great swell and a general favourite. The Commissioner
knew his family at home, and makes no end of fuss about him. He left for the
Southern district, I am glad to say. I felt queer, I must say; but, of course,
I didn't show it. We were formally introduced. He caught me with that sudden
glance of his&mdash;devilish sharp eyes, he has&mdash;and looks me full in the
face.</p>
<p>'"I don't remember your name, Mr. Haughton," said he; "but your face seems
familiar to me somehow. I can't think where I've met you before."</p>
<p>'"Must have been at the Melbourne Club," says I, pulling my moustache. "Met
a heap of Sydney people there."</p>
<p>'"Perhaps so," says he. "I used to go and lunch there a good deal. I had a
month's leave last month, just after I got my step. Curious it seems, too,"
says he; "I can't get over it."</p>
<p>'"Fill your glass and pass the claret," says the Commissioner. "Faces are
very puzzling things met in a different state of existence. I don't suppose
Haughton's wanted, eh, Goring?"</p>
<p>'This was held to be a capital joke, and I laughed too in a way that would
have made my fortune on the stage. Goring laughed too, and seemed to fear he'd
wounded my feelings, for he was most polite all the rest of the evening.'</p>
<p>'Well, if <i>he</i> didn't smoke you,' says Jim, 'we're right till the Day
of Judgment. There's no one else here that's half a ghost of a chance to swear
to us.'</p>
<p>'Except,' says I&mdash;</p>
<p>'Oh! Kate?' says Jim; 'never mind her. Jeanie's coming up to be married to
me next month, and Kate's getting so fond of you again that there's no fear of
her letting the cat out.'</p>
<p>'That's the very reason. I never cared two straws about her, and now I hate
the sight of her. She's a revengeful devil, and if she takes it into her head
she'll turn on us some fine day as sure as we're alive.'</p>
<p>'Don't you believe it,' says Jim; 'women are not so bad as all that.' ('Are
they not?' says Starlight.) 'I'll go bail we'll be snug and safe here till
Christmas, and then we'll give out, say we're going to Melbourne for a spree,
and clear straight out.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 28</h2>
<p>As everything looked so fair-weather-like, Jim and Jeanie made it up to be
married as soon after she came up as he could get a house ready. She came up to
Sydney, first by sea and after that to the diggings by the coach. She was
always a quiet, hard-working, good little soul, awful timid, and prudent in
everything but in taking a fancy to Jim. But that's neither here nor there.
Women will take fancies as long as the world lasts, and if they happen to fancy
the wrong people the more obstinate they hold on to 'em. Jeanie was one of the
prettiest girls I ever set eyes on in her way, very fair and clear coloured,
with big, soft blue eyes, and hair like a cloud of spun silk. Nothing like her
was ever seen on the field when she came up, so all the diggers said.</p>
<p>When they began to write to one another after we came to the Turon, Jim told
her straight out that though we were doing well now it mightn't last. He
thought she was a great fool to leave Melbourne when she was safe and
comfortable, and come to a wild place, in a way like the Turon. Of course he
was ready and willing to marry her; but, speaking all for her own good, he
advised her not. She'd better give him up and set her mind on somebody else.
Girls that was anyway good-looking and kept themselves proper and decent were
very scarce in Melbourne and Sydney now, considering the number of men that
were making fortunes and were anxious to get a wife and settle down. A girl
like her could marry anybody&mdash;most likely some one above her own rank in
life. Of course she wouldn't have no one but Jim, and if he was ready to marry
her, and could get a little cottage, she was ready too. She would always be his
own Jeanie, and was willing to run any kind of risk so as to be with him and
near him, and so on.</p>
<p>Starlight and I both tried to keep Jim from it all we knew. It would make
things twice as bad for him if he had to turn out again, and there was no
knowing the moment when we might have to make a bolt for it; and where could
Jeanie go then?</p>
<p>But Jim had got one of his obstinate fits. He said we were regularly mixed
up with the diggers now. He never intended to follow any other life, and
wouldn't go back to the Hollow or take part in any fresh cross work, no matter
how good it might be. Poor old Jim! I really believe he'd made up his mind to
go straight from the very hour he was buckled to Jeanie; and if he'd only had
common luck he'd have been as square and right as George Storefield to this
very hour.</p>
<p>I was near forgetting about old George. My word! he was getting on faster
than we were, though he hadn't a golden hole. He was gold-finding in a
different way, and no mistake. One day we saw a stoutish man drive up Main
Street to the camp, with a well-groomed horse, in a dogcart, and a servant with
him; and who was this but old George? He didn't twig us. He drove close
alongside of Jim, who was coming back from the creek, where he'd been puddling,
with two shovels and a pick over his shoulder, and a pair of old yellow
trousers on, and him splashed up to the eyes. George didn't know him a bit. But
we knew him and laughed to ourselves to see the big swell he had grown into. He
stopped at the camp and left his dogcart outside with his man. Next thing we
saw was the Commissioner walking about outside the camp with him, and talking
to him just as if he was a regular intimate friend.</p>
<p>The Commissioner, that was so proud that he wouldn't look at a digger or
shake hands with him, not if he was a young marquis, as long as he was a
digger. 'No!' he used to say, 'I have to keep my authority over these thousands
and tens of thousands of people, some of them very wild and lawless,
principally by moral influence, though, of course, I have the Government to
fall back upon. To do that I must keep up my position, and over-familiarity
would be the destruction of it.' When we saw him shaking hands with old George
and inviting him to lunch we asked one of the miners next to our claim if he
knew what that man's name and occupation was there.</p>
<p>'Oh!' he says, 'I thought everybody knew him. That's Storefield, the great
contractor. He has all the contracts for horse-feed for the camps and police
stations; nearly every one between here and Kiandra. He's took 'em lucky this
year, and he's making money hand over fist.'</p>
<p>Well done, steady old George! No wonder he could afford to drive a good
horse and a swell dogcart. He was getting up in the world. We were a bit more
astonished when we heard the Commissioner say&mdash;</p>
<p>'I am just about to open court, Mr. Storefield. Would you mind taking a few
cases with me this morning?'</p>
<p>We went into the courthouse just for a lark. There was old George sitting on
the bench as grave as a judge, and a rattling good magistrate he made too. He
disagreed from the Commissioner once or twice, and showed him where he was
right, too, not in the law but in the facts of the case, where George's knowing
working men and their ways gave him the pull. He wasn't over sharp and hard
either, like some men directly they're raised up a bit, just to show their
power. But just seemed to do a fair thing, neither too much one way or the
other. George stayed and had lunch at the camp with the Commissioner when the
court was adjourned, and he drove away afterwards with his upstanding
eighty-guinea horse&mdash;horses was horses in those days&mdash;just as good a
gentleman to look at as anybody. Of course we knew there was a difference, and
he'd never get over a few things he'd missed when he was young, in the way of
education. But he was liked and respected for all that, and made welcome
everywhere. He was a man as didn't push himself one bit. There didn't seem
anything but his money and his good-natured honest face, and now and then a bit
of a clumsy joke, to make him a place. But when the swells make up their minds
to take a man in among themselves they're not half as particular as commoner
people; they do a thing well when they're about it.</p>
<p>So George was hail-fellow-well-met with all the swells at the camp, and the
bankers and big storekeepers, and the doctors and lawyers and clergymen, all
the nobs there were at the Turon; and when the Governor himself and his lady
came up on a visit to see what the place was like, why George was taken up and
introduced as if he'd been a regular blessed curiosity in the way of
contractors, and his Excellency hadn't set eyes on one before.</p>
<p>'My word! Dick,' Jim says, 'it's a murder he and Aileen didn't cotton to one
another in the old days. She'd have been just the girl to have fancied all this
sort of swell racket, with a silk gown and dressed up a bit. There isn't a
woman here that's a patch on her for looks, is there now, except Jeanie, and
she's different in her ways.'</p>
<p>I didn't believe there was. I began to think it over in my own mind, and
wonder how it came about that she'd missed all her chances of rising in life,
and if ever a woman was born for it she was. I couldn't help seeing whose fault
it was that she'd been kept back and was now obliged to work hard, and almost
ashamed to show herself at Bargo and the other small towns; not that the people
were ever shy of speaking to her, but she thought they might be, and wouldn't
give them a chance. In about a month up comes Jeanie Morrison from Melbourne,
looking just the same as the very first evening we met Kate and her on the St.
Kilda beach. Just as quiet and shy and modest-looking&mdash;only a bit sadder,
and not quite so ready to smile as she'd been in the old days. She looked as if
she'd had a grief to hide and fight down since then. A girl's first sorrow when
something happened to her love! They never look quite the same afterwards. I've
seen a good many, and if it was real right down love, they were never the same
in looks or feelings afterwards. They might 'get over it', as people call it;
but that's a sort of healing over a wound. It don't always cure it, and the
wound often breaks out again and bleeds afresh.</p>
<p>Jeanie didn't look so bad, and she was that glad to see Jim again and to
find him respected as a hard-working well-to-do miner that she forgot most of
her disappointments and forgave him his share of any deceit that had been
practised upon her and her sister. Women are like that. They'll always make
excuses for men they're fond of and blame anybody else that can be blamed or
that's within reach. She thought Starlight and me had the most to do with
it&mdash;perhaps we had; but Jim could have cut loose from us any time before
the Momberah cattle racket much easier than he could now. I heard her say once
that she thought other people were much more to blame than poor
James&mdash;people who ought to have known better, and so on. By the time she
had got to the end of her little explanation Jim was completely whitewashed of
course. It had always happened to him, and I suppose always would. He was a man
born to be helped and looked out for by every one he came near.</p>
<p>Seeing how good-looking Jeanie was thought, and how all the swells kept
crowding round to get a look at her, if she was near the bar, Kate wanted to
have a ball and show her off a bit. But she wouldn't have it. She right down
refused and close upon quarrelled with Kate about it. She didn't take to the
glare and noise and excitement of Turon at all. She was frightened at the
strange-looking men that filled the streets by day and the hall at the
Prospectors' by night. The women she couldn't abide. Anyhow she wouldn't have
nothing to say to them. All she wanted&mdash;and she kept at Jim day after day
till she made him carry it out&mdash;was for him to build or buy a cottage, she
didn't care how small, where they could go and live quietly together. She would
cook his meals and mend his clothes, and they would come into town on Saturday
nights only and be as happy as kings and queens. She didn't come up to dance or
flirt, she said, in a place like Turon, and if Jim didn't get a home for her
she'd go back to her dressmaking at St. Kilda. This woke up Jim, so he bought
out a miner who lived a bit out of the town. He had made money and wanted to
sell his improvements and clear out for Sydney. It was a small four-roomed
weatherboard cottage, with a bark roof, but very neatly put on. There was a
little creek in front, and a small flower garden, with rose trees growing up
the verandah posts. Most miners, when they're doing well, make a garden. They
take a pride in having a neat cottage and everything about it shipshape. The
ground, of course, didn't belong to him, but he held it by his miner's right.
The title was good enough, and he had a right to sell his goodwill and
improvements.</p>
<p>Jim gave him his price and took everything, even to the bits of furniture.
They weren't much, but a place looks awful bare without them. The dog, and the
cock and hens he bought too. He got some real nice things in
Turon&mdash;tables, chairs, sofas, beds, and so on; and had the place lined and
papered inside, quite swell. Then he told Jeanie the house was ready, and the
next week they were married. They were married in the church&mdash;that is, the
iron building that did duty for one. It had all been carted up from
Melbourne&mdash;framework, roof, seats, and all&mdash;and put together at
Turon. It didn't look so bad after it was painted, though it was awful hot in
summer.</p>
<p>Here they were married, all square and regular, by the Scotch clergyman. He
was the first minister of any kind that came up to the diggings, and the men
had all come to like him for his straightforward, earnest way of preaching. Not
that we went often, but a good few of us diggers went every now and then just
to show our respect for him; and so Jim said he'd be married by Mr. Mackenzie
and no one else. Jeanie was a Presbyterian, so it suited her all to pieces.</p>
<p>Well, the church was chock-full. There never was such a congregation before.
Lots of people had come to know Jim on the diggings, and more had heard of him
as a straightgoing, good-looking digger, who was free with his money and pretty
lucky. As for Jeanie, there was a report that she was the prettiest girl in
Melbourne, and something of that sort, and so they all tried to get a look at
her. Certainly, though there had been a good many marriages since we had come
to the Turon, the church had never held a handsomer couple. Jeanie was quietly
dressed in plain white silk. She had on a veil; no ornaments of any kind or
sorts. It was a warmish day, and there was a sort of peach-blossom colour on
her cheeks that looked as delicate as if a breath of air would blow it away.
When she came in and saw the crowd of bronze bearded faces and hundreds of
strange eyes bent on her, she turned quite pale. Then the flush came back on
her face, and her eyes looked as bright as some of the sapphires we used to
pick up now and then out of the river bed. Her hair was twisted up in a knot
behind; but even that didn't hide the lovely colour nor what a lot there was of
it. As she came in with her slight figure and modest sweet face that turned up
to Jim's like a child's, there was a sort of hum in the church that sounded
very like breaking into a cheer.</p>
<p>Jim certainly was a big upstanding chap, strong built but active with it,
and as fine a figure of a man as you'd see on the Turon or any other place. He
stood about six feet and an inch, and was as straight as a rush. There was no
stiffness about him either. He was broad-shouldered and light flanked, quick on
his pins, and as good a man&mdash;all round&mdash;with his hands as you could
pick out of the regular prize ring. He was as strong as a bullock, and just as
good at the end of a day as at the start. With the work we'd had for the last
five or six months we were all in top condition, as hard as a board and fit to
work at any pace for twenty-four hours on end. He had an open, merry, laughing
face, had Jim, with straight features and darkish hair and eyes. Nobody could
ever keep angry with Jim. He was one of those kind of men that could fight to
some purpose now and then, but that most people found it very hard to keep bad
friends with.</p>
<p>Besides the miners, there were lots of other people in church who had heard
of the wedding and come to see us. I saw Starlight and the two Honourables,
dressed up as usual, besides the Commissioner and the camp officers; and more
than that, the new Inspector of Police, who'd only arrived the day before. Sir
Ferdinand Morringer, even he was there, dividing the people's attention with
the bride. Besides that, who should I see but Bella and Maddie Barnes and old
Jonathan. They'd ridden into the Turon, for they'd got their riding habits on,
and Bella had the watch and chain Starlight had given her. I saw her look over
to where he and the other two were, but she didn't know him again a bit in the
world. He was sitting there looking as if he was bored and tired with the whole
thing&mdash;hadn't seen a soul in the church before, and didn't want to see 'em
again.</p>
<p>I saw Maddie Barnes looking with all her eyes at Jim, while her face grew
paler. She hadn't much colour at the best of times, but she was a fine-grown,
lissom, good-looking girl for all that, and as full of fun and games as she
could stick. Her eyes seemed to get bigger and darker as she looked, and when
the parson began to read the service she turned away her head. I always thought
she was rather soft on Jim, and now I saw it plain enough. He was one of those
rattling, jolly kind of fellows that can't help being friendly with every girl
he meets, and very seldom cares much for any one in particular. He had been
backward and forward a good deal with father before we got clear of Berrima,
and that's how poor Maddie had come to take the fancy so strong and set her
heart upon him.</p>
<p>It must be hard lines for a woman to stand by, in a church or anywhere else,
and see the man she loves given away, for good and all, buckled hard and fast
to another woman. Nobody took much notice of poor Maddie, but I watched her
pretty close, and saw the tears come into her eyes, though she let 'em run down
her face before she'd pull out her handkerchief. Then she put up her veil and
held up her head with a bit of a toss, and I saw her pride had helped her to
bear it. I don't suppose anybody else saw her, and if they did they'd only
think she was cryin' for company&mdash;as women often do at weddings and all
kinds of things. But I knew better. She wouldn't peach, poor thing! Still, I
saw that more than one or two knew who we were and all about us that day.</p>
<p>We'd only just heard that the new Inspector of Police had come on to the
field; so of course everybody began to talk about him and wanted to have a look
at him. Next to the Commissioner and the P.M., the Inspector of Police is the
biggest man in a country town or on a goldfield. He has a tremendous lot of
power, and, inside of the law, can do pretty much what he pleases. He can
arrest a man on suspicion and keep him in gaol for a month or two. He can have
him remanded from time to time for further evidence, and make it pretty hot for
him generally. He can let him out when he proves innocent, and nobody can do
anything. All he has to say is: 'There was a mistake in the man's identity;'
or, 'Not sufficient proof.' Anything of that sort. He can walk up to any man he
likes (or dislikes) and tell him to hold up his hands for the handcuffs, and
shoot him if he resists. He has servants to wait on him, and orderly troopers
to ride behind him; a handsome uniform like a cavalry officer; and if he's a
smart, soldierly, good-looking fellow, as he very often is, he's run after a
good deal and can hold his head as high as he pleases. There's a bit of risk
sometimes in apprehending desperate&mdash;ahem!&mdash;bad characters, and with
bush-rangers and people of that sort, but nothing more than any young fellow of
spirit would like mixed up with his work. Very often they're men of good family
in the old country that have found nothing to do in this, and have taken to the
police. When it was known that this Ferdinand Morringer was a real baronet and
had been an officer in the Guards, you may guess how the flood of goldfields'
talk rose and flowed and foamed all round him. It was Sir Ferdinand this and
Sir Ferdinand that wherever you went. He was going to lodge at the Royal. No,
of course he was going to stay at the camp! He was married and had three
children. Not a bit of it; he was a bachelor, and he was going to be married to
Miss Ingersoll, the daughter of the bank manager of the Bank of New Holland.
They'd met abroad. He was a tall, fine-looking man. Not at all, only
middle-sized; hadn't old Major Trenck, the superintendent of police, when he
came to enlist and said he had been in the Guards, growled out, 'Too short for
the Guards!'</p>
<p>'But I was not a private,' replied Sir Ferdinand.</p>
<p>'Well, anyhow there's a something about him. Nobody can deny he looks like a
gentleman; my word, he'll put some of these Weddin Mountain chaps thro' their
facin's, you'll see,' says one miner.</p>
<p>'Not he,' says another; 'not if he was ten baronites in one; all the same,
he's a manly-looking chap and shows blood.'</p>
<p>This was the sort of talk we used to hear all round us&mdash;from the
miners, from the storekeepers, from the mixed mob at the Prospectors' Arms, in
the big room at night, and generally all about. We said nothing, and took care
to keep quiet, and do and say nothing to be took hold of. All the same, we were
glad to see Sir Ferdinand. We'd heard of him before from Goring and the other
troopers; but he'd been on duty in another district, and hadn't come in our
way.</p>
<p>One evening we were all sitting smoking and yarning in the big room of the
hotel, and Jim, for a wonder&mdash;we'd been washing up&mdash;when we saw one
of the camp gentlemen come in, and a strange officer of police with him. A sort
of whisper ran through the room, and everybody made up their minds it was Sir
Ferdinand. Jim and I both looked at him.</p>
<p>'Wa-al!' said one of our Yankee friends, 'what 'yur twistin' your necks at
like a flock of geese in a corn patch? How d'ye fix it that a lord's better'n
any other man?'</p>
<p>'He's a bit different, somehow,' I says. 'We're not goin' to kneel down or
knuckle under to him, but he don't look like any one else in this room, does
he?'</p>
<p>'He's no slouch, and he looks yer square and full in the eye, like a
hunter,' says Arizona Bill; 'but durn my old buckskins if I can see why you
Britishers sets up idols and such and worship 'em, in a colony, jest's if yer
was in that benighted old England again.'</p>
<p>We didn't say any more. Jim lit his pipe and smoked away, thinking, perhaps,
more whether Sir Ferdinand was anything of a revolver shot, and if he was
likely to hit him (Jim) at forty or fifty yards, in case such a chance should
turn up, than about the difference of rank and such things.</p>
<p>While we were talking we saw Starlight and one of the Honourables come in
and sit down close by Sir Ferdinand, who was taking his grog at a small table,
and smoking a big cigar. The Honourable and he jumps up at once and shook hands
in such a hurry so as we knew they'd met before. Then the Honourable introduces
Starlight to Sir Ferdinand. We felt too queer to laugh, Jim and I, else we
should have dropped off our seats when Starlight bowed as grave as a judge, and
Sir Ferdinand (we could hear) asked him how many months he'd been out in the
colony, and how he liked it?</p>
<p>Starlight said it wasn't at all a bad place when you got used to it, but he
thought he should try and get away before the end of the year.</p>
<p>We couldn't help sniggerin' a bit at this, 'specially when Arizona Bill
said, 'Thar's another durned fool of a Britisher; look at his eyeglass! I
wonder the field has not shaken some of that cussed foolishness out of him by
this time.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 29</h2>
<p>Jim and his wife moved over to the cottage in Specimen Gully; the miners
went back to their work, and there was no more talk or bother about the matter.
Something always happened every day at the Turon which wiped the last thing
clean out of people's mind. Either it was a big nugget, or a new reef, or a
tent robbery, a gold-buyer stuck up and robbed in the Ironbarks, a
horse-stealing match, a fight at a dance-house, or a big law case. Accidents
and offences happened every day, and any of them was enough to take up the
whole attention of every digger on the field till something else turned up.</p>
<p>Not that we troubled our heads over much about things of this sort. We had
set our minds to go on until our claims were worked out, or close up; then to
sell out, and with the lot we'd already banked to get down to Melbourne and
clear out. Should we ever be able to manage that? It seemed getting nearer,
nearer, like a star that a man fixes his eyes on as he rides through a lonely
bit of forest at night. We had all got our eyes fixed on it, Lord knows, and
were working double tides, doing our very best to make up a pile worth while
leaving the country with. As for Jim, he and his little wife seemed that happy
that he grudged every minute he spent away from her. He worked as well as
ever&mdash;better, indeed, for he never took his mind from his piece of work,
whatever it was, for a second. But the very minute his shift was over Jim was
away along the road to Specimen Gully, like a cow going back to find her calf.
He hardly stopped to light his pipe now, and we'd only seen him once up town,
and that was on a Saturday night with Jeanie on his arm.</p>
<p>Well, the weeks passed over, and at long last we got on as far in the year
as the first week in December. We'd given out that we might go somewhere to
spend our Christmas. We were known to be pretty well in, and to have worked
steady all these months since the early part of the year. We had paid our way
all the time, and could leave at a minute's notice without asking any man's
leave.</p>
<p>If we were digging up gold like potatoes we weren't the only ones. No, not
by a lot. There never was a richer patch of alluvial, I believe, in any of the
fields, and the quantity that was sent down in one year was a caution. Wasn't
the cash scattered about then? Talk of money, it was like the dirt under your
feet&mdash;in one way, certainly&mdash;as the dirt was more often than not full
of gold.</p>
<p>We could see things getting worse on the field after a bit. We didn't set up
to be any great shakes ourselves, Jim and I; but we didn't want the field to be
overrun by a set of scoundrels that were the very scum of the earth, let alone
the other colonies. We were afraid they'd go in for some big foolish row, and
we should get dragged in for it. That was exactly what we didn't want.</p>
<p>With the overflowing of the gold, as it were, came such a town and such a
people to fill it, as no part of Australia had ever seen before. When it got
known by newspapers, and letters from the miners themselves to their friends at
home, what an enormous yield of gold was being dug out of the ground in such a
simple fashion, all the world seemed to be moving over. At that time nobody
could tell a lie hardly about the tremendous quantity that was being got and
sent away every week. This was easy to know, because the escort returns were
printed in all the newspapers every week; so everybody could see for themselves
what pounds and hundredweights and tons&mdash;yes, tons of gold&mdash;were
being got by men who very often, as like as not, hadn't to dig above twenty or
thirty feet for it, and had never handled a pick or a shovel in their lives
before they came to the Turon.</p>
<p>There were plenty of good men at the diggings. I will say this for the
regular miners, that a more manly, straightgoing lot of fellows no man ever
lived among. I wish we'd never known any worse. We were not what might be
called highly respectable people ourselves&mdash;still, men like us are only
half-and-half bad, like a good many more in this world. They're partly tempted
into doing wrong by opportunity, and kept back by circumstances from getting
into the straight track afterwards. But on every goldfield there's scores and
scores of men that always hurry off there like crows and eagles to a carcass to
see what they can rend and tear and fatten upon. They ain't very particular
whether it's the living or the dead, so as they can gorge their fill. There was
a good many of this lot at the Turon, and though the diggers gave them a wide
berth, and helped to run them down when they'd committed any crime, they
couldn't be kept out of sight and society altogether.</p>
<p>We used to go up sometimes to see the gold escort start. It was one of the
regular sights of the field, and the miners that were off shift and people that
hadn't much to do generally turned up on escort day. The gold was taken down to
Sydney once a week in a strong express waggon&mdash;something like a Yankee
coach, with leather springs and a high driving seat; so that four horses could
be harnessed. One of the police sergeants generally drove, a trooper fully
armed with rifle and revolver on the box beside him. In the back seat sat two
more troopers with their Sniders ready for action; two rode a hundred yards
ahead, and another couple about the same distance behind.</p>
<p>We always noticed that a good many of the sort of men that never seemed to
do any digging and yet always had good clothes and money to spend used to hang
about when the escort was starting. People in the crowd 'most always knew
whether it was a 'big' escort or a 'light' one. It generally leaked out how
many ounces had been sent by this bank and how much by that; how much had come
from the camp, for the diggers who did not choose to sell to the banks were
allowed to deposit their gold with an officer at the camp, where it was
carefully weighed, and a receipt given to them stating the number of ounces,
pennyweights, and grains. Then it was forwarded by the escort, deducting a
small percentage for the carriage and safe keeping. Government did not take all
the risk upon itself. The miner must run his chance if he did not sell. But the
chance was thought good enough; the other thing was hardly worth talking about.
Who was to be game to stick up the Government escort, with eight police
troopers, all well armed and ready to make a fight to the death before they
gave up the treasure committed to their charge? The police couldn't catch all
the horse-stealers and bush-rangers in a country that contained so many
millions of acres of waste land; but no one doubted that they would make a
first-rate fight, on their own ground as it were, and before they'd let
anything be taken away from them that had been counted out, box by box, and
given into their charge.</p>
<p>We had as little notion of trying anything of the sort ourselves than as we
had of breaking into the Treasury in Sydney by night. But those who knew used
to say that if the miners had known the past history of some of the men that
used to stand up and look on, well dressed or in regular digger rig, as the
gold boxes were being brought out and counted into the escort drag, they would
have made a bodyguard to go with it themselves when they had gold on board, or
have worried the Government into sending twenty troopers in charge instead of
six or eight.</p>
<p>One day, as Jim and I happened to be at the camp just as the escort was
starting, the only time we'd been there for a month, we saw Warrigal and Moran
standing about. They didn't see us; we were among a lot of other diggers, so we
were able to take them out of winding a bit.</p>
<p>They were there for no good, we agreed. Warrigal's sharp eyes noted
everything about the whole turn-out&mdash;the sergeant's face that drove, the
way the gold boxes were counted out and put in a kind of fixed locker
underneath the middle of the coach. He saw where the troopers sat before and
behind, and I'll be bound came away with a wonderful good general idea of how
the escort travelled, and of a good many things more about it that nobody
guessed at. As for Moran, we could see him fix his eyes upon the sergeant who
was driving, and look at him as if he could look right through him. He never
took his eyes off him the whole time, but glared at him like a maniac; if some
of his people hadn't given him a shove as they passed he would soon have
attracted people's attention. But the crowd was too busy looking at the
well-conditioned prancing horses and the neatly got up troopers of the escort
drag to waste their thoughts upon a common bushman, however he might stare.
When he turned away to leave he ground out a red-hot curse betwixt his teeth.
It made us think that Warrigal's coming about with him on this line counted for
no good.</p>
<p>They slipped through the crowd again, and, though they were pretty close,
they never saw us. Warrigal would have known us however we might have been
altered, but somehow he never turned his head our way. He was like a child, so
taken up with all the things he saw that his great-grandfather might have
jumped up from the Fish River Caves, or wherever he takes his rest, and
Warrigal would never have wondered at him.</p>
<p>'That's a queer start!' says Jim, as we walked on our homeward path. 'I
wonder what those two crawling, dingo-looking beggars were here for? Never no
good. I say, did you see that fellow Moran look at the sergeant as if he'd eat
him? What eyes he has, for all the world like a black snake! Do you think he's
got any particular down on him?'</p>
<p>'Not more than on all police. I suppose he'd rub them out, every mother's
son, if he could. He and Warrigal can't stick up the escort by themselves.'</p>
<p>We managed to get a letter from home from time to time now we'd settled, as
it were, at the Turon. Of course they had to be sent in the name of Henderson,
but we called for them at the post-office, and got them all right. It was a
treat to read Aileen's letters now. They were so jolly and hopeful-like besides
what they used to be. Now that we'd been so long, it seemed years, at the
diggings, and were working hard, doing well, and getting quite settled, as she
said, she believed that all would go right, and that we should be able really
to carry out our plans of getting clear away to some country where we could
live safe and quiet lives. Women are mostly like that. They first of all
believe all that they're afraid of will happen. Then, as soon as they see
things brighten up a bit, they're as sure as fate everything's bound to go
right. They don't seem to have any kind of feeling between. They hate making up
their minds, most of 'em as I've known, and jump from being ready to drown
themselves one moment to being likely to go mad with joy another. Anyhow you
take 'em, they're better than men, though. I'll never go back on that.</p>
<p>So Aileen used to send me and Jim long letters now, telling us that things
were better at home, and that she really thought mother was cheerfuller and
stronger in health than she'd been ever since&mdash;well, ever since&mdash;that
had happened. She thought her prayers had been heard, and that we were going to
be forgiven for our sins and allowed, by God's mercy, to lead a new life. She
quite believed in our leaving the country, although her heart would be nearly
broken by the thought that she might never see us again, and a lot more of the
same sort.</p>
<p>Poor mother! she had a hard time of it if ever any one ever had in this
world, and none of it her own fault as I could ever see. Some people gets
punished in this world for the sins other people commit. I can see that fast
enough. Whether they get it made up to 'em afterwards, of course I can't say.
They ought to, anyhow, if it can be made up to 'em. Some things that are
suffered in this world can't be paid for, I don't care how they fix it.</p>
<p>More than once, too, there was a line or two on a scrap of paper slipped in
Aileen's letters from Gracey Storefield. She wasn't half as good with the pen
as Aileen, but a few words from the woman you love goes a long way, no matter
what sort of a fist she writes. Gracey made shift to tell me she was so proud
to hear I was doing well; that Aileen's eyes had been twice as bright lately;
that mother looked better than she'd seen her this years; and if I could get
away to any other country she'd meet me in Melbourne, and would be, as she'd
always been, 'your own Gracey'&mdash;that's the way it was signed.</p>
<p>When I read this I felt a different man. I stood up and took an
oath&mdash;solemn, mind you, and I intended to keep it&mdash;that if I got
clear away I'd pay her for her love and true heart with my life, what was left
of it, and I'd never do another crooked thing as long as I lived. Then I began
to count the days to Christmas.</p>
<p>I wasn't married like Jim, and it not being very lively in the tent at
night, Arizona Bill and I mostly used to stroll up to the Prospectors' Arms.
We'd got used to sitting at the little table, drinking our beer or what not,
smoking our pipes and listening to all the fun that was going on. Not that we
always sat in the big hall. There was a snug little parlour beside the bar that
we found more comfortable, and Kate used to run in herself when business was
slack enough to leave the barmaid; then she'd sit down and have a good solid
yarn with us.</p>
<p>She made a regular old friend of me, and, as she was a handsome woman,
always well dressed, with lots to say and plenty of admirers, I wasn't above
being singled out and made much of. It was partly policy, of course. She knew
our secret, and it wouldn't have done to have let her let it out or be bad
friends, so that we should be always going in dread of it. So Jim and I were
always mighty civil to her, and I really thought she'd improved a lot lately
and turned out a much nicer woman than I thought she could be.</p>
<p>We used to talk away about old times, regular confidential, and though she'd
great spirits generally, she used to change quite sudden sometimes and say she
was a miserable woman, and wished she hadn't been in such a hurry and married
as she had. Then she'd crack up Jeanie, and say how true and constant she'd
been, and how she was rewarded for it by marrying the only man she ever loved.
She used to blame her temper; she'd always had it, she said, and couldn't get
rid of it; but she really believed, if things had turned out different, she'd
have been a different woman, and any man she really loved would never have had
no call to complain. Of course I knew what all this meant, but thought I could
steer clear of coming to grief over it.</p>
<p>That was where I made the mistake. But I didn't think so then, or how much
hung upon careless words and looks.</p>
<p>Well, somehow or other she wormed it out of me that we were off somewhere at
Christmas. Then she never rested till she'd found out that we were going to
Melbourne. After that she seemed as if she'd changed right away into somebody
else. She was that fair and soft-speaking and humble-minded that Jeanie
couldn't have been more gentle in her ways; and she used to look at me from
time to time as if her heart was breaking. I didn't believe that, for I didn't
think she'd any heart to break.</p>
<p>One night, after we'd left about twelve o'clock, just as the house shut up,
Arizona Bill says to me&mdash;</p>
<p>'Say, pard, have yer fixed it up to take that young woman along when you
pull up stakes?'</p>
<p>'No,' I said; 'isn't she a married woman? and, besides, I haven't such a
fancy for her as all that comes to.'</p>
<p>'Ye heven't?' he said, speaking very low, as he always did, and taking the
cigar out of his mouth&mdash;Bill always smoked cigars when he could get them,
and not very cheap ones either; 'well, then, I surmise you're lettin' her think
quite contrairy, and there's bound to be a muss if you don't hide your tracks
and strike a trail she can't foller on.'</p>
<p>'I begin to think I've been two ends of a dashed fool; but what's a man to
do?'</p>
<p>'See here, now,' he said; 'you hev two cl'ar weeks afore ye. You slack off
and go slow; that'll let her see you didn't sorter cotton to her more'n's in
the regulations.'</p>
<p>'And have a row with her?'</p>
<p>'Sartin,' says Bill, 'and hev the shootin' over right away. It's a plaguey
sight safer than letting her carry it in her mind, and then laying for yer some
day when ye heven't nary thought of Injuns in your head. That's the very time a
woman like her's bound to close on yer and lift yer ha'r if she can.'</p>
<p>'Why, how do you know what she's likely to do?'</p>
<p>'I've been smokin', pard, while you hev bin talkin', sorter careless like.
I've had my eyes open and seen Injun sign mor'n once or twice either. I've
hunted with her tribe afore, I guess, and old Bill ain't forgot all the totems
and the war paint.'</p>
<p>After this Bill fresh lit his cigar, and wouldn't say any more. But I could
see what he was driving at, and I settled to try all I knew to keep everything
right and square till the time came for us to make our dart.</p>
<p>I managed to have a quiet talk with Starlight. He thought that by taking
care, being very friendly, but not too much so, we might get clean off, without
Kate or any one else being much the wiser.</p>
<p>Next week everything seemed to go on wheels&mdash;smooth and fast, no
hitches anywhere. Jim reckoned the best of our claim would be worked out by the
20th of the month, and we'd as good as agreed to sell our shares to Arizona
Bill and his mate, who were ready, as Bill said, 'to plank down considerable
dollars' for what remained of it. If they got nothing worth while, it was the
fortune of war, which a digger never growls at, no matter how hard hit he may
be. If they did well, they were such up and down good fellows, and such real
friends to us, that we should have grudged them nothing.</p>
<p>As for Jeanie, she was almost out of her mind with eagerness to get back to
Melbourne and away from the diggings. She was afraid of many of the people she
saw, and didn't like others. She was terrified all the time Jim was away from
her, but she would not hear of living at the Prospectors' Arms with her
sister.</p>
<p>'I know where that sort of thing leads to,' she said; 'let us have our own
home, however rough.'</p>
<p>Kate went out to Specimen Gully to see her sister pretty often, and they sat
and talked and laughed, just as they did in old times, Jeanie said. She was a
simple little thing, and her heart was as pure as quartz crystal. I do really
believe she was no match for Kate in any way. So the days went on. I didn't
dare stay away from the Prospectors' Arms, for fear she'd think I wanted to
break with her altogether, and yet I was never altogether comfortable in her
company. It wasn't her fault, for she laid herself out to get round us all,
even old Arizona Bill, who used to sit solemnly smoking, looking like an Indian
chief or a graven image, until at last his brick-coloured, grizzled old face
would break up all of a sudden, and he'd laugh like a youngster. As the days
drew nigh Christmas I could see a restless expression in her face that I never
saw before. Her eyes began to shine in a strange way, and sometimes she'd break
off short in her talk and run out of the room. Then she'd pretend to wish we
were gone, and that she'd never seen us again. I could hardly tell what to make
of her, and many a time I wished we were on blue water and clear away from all
chance of delay and drawback.</p>
<h2>Chapter 30</h2>
<p>We made up our minds to start by Saturday's coach. It left at night and
travelled nigh a hundred miles by the same hour next morning. It's more
convenient for getting away than the morning. A chap has time for doing all
kinds of things just as he would like; besides, a quieter time to slope than
just after breakfast. The Turon daily mail was well horsed and well driven.
Nightwork though it was, and the roads dangerous in places, the five big
double-reflector lamps, one high up over the top of the coach in the middle
with two pair more at the side, made everything plain. We Cornstalks never
thought of more than the regular pair of lamps, pretty low down, too, before
the Yankee came and showed us what cross-country coaching was. We never knew
before. My word, they taught us a trick or two. All about riding came natural,
but a heap of dodges about harness we never so much as heard of till they came
to the country with the gold rush.</p>
<p>We'd made all our bits of preparations, and thought nothing stood in the way
of a start next evening. This was Friday. Jim hadn't sold his bits of traps,
because he didn't want it to be known he wasn't coming back. He left word with
a friend he could trust, though, to have 'em all auctioned and the goodwill of
his cottage, and to send the money after him. My share and his in the claim
went to Arizona Bill and his mate. We had no call to be ashamed of the money
that stood to our credit in the bank. That we intended to draw out, and take
with us in an order or a draft, or something, to Melbourne. Jeanie had her
boxes packed, and was so wild with looking forward to seeing St. Kilda beach
again that she could hardly sleep or eat as the time drew near.</p>
<p>Friday night came; everything had been settled. It was the last night we
should either of us spend at the Turon for many a day&mdash;perhaps never. I
walked up and down the streets, smoking, and thinking it all over. The idea of
bed was ridiculous. How wonderful it all seemed! After what we had gone through
and the state we were in less than a year ago, to think that we were within so
little of being clear away and safe for ever in another country, with as much
as would keep us comfortable for life. I could see Gracey, Aileen, and Jeanie,
all so peaceful and loving together, with poor old mother, who had lost her old
trick of listening and trembling whenever she heard a strange step or the tread
of a horse. What a glorious state of things it would be! A deal of it was owing
to the gold. This wonderful gold! But for it we shouldn't have had such a
chance in a hundred years. I was that restless I couldn't settle, when I
thought, all of a sudden, as I walked up and down, that I had promised to go
and say good-bye to Kate Mullockson, at the Prospectors' Arms, the night before
we started. I thought for a moment whether it would be safer to let it alone. I
had a strange, unwilling kind of feeling about going there again; but at last,
half not knowing what else to do, and half not caring to make an enemy of Kate,
if I could help it, I walked up.</p>
<p>It was latish. She was standing near the bar, talking to half-a-dozen people
at once, as usual; but I saw she noticed me at once. She quickly drew off a bit
from them all; said it was near shutting-up time, and, after a while, passed
through the bar into the little parlour where I was sitting down. It was just
midnight. The night was half over before I thought of coming in. So when she
came in and seated herself near me on the sofa I heard the clock strike twelve,
and most of the men who were walking about the hall began to clear out.</p>
<p>Somehow, when you've been living at a place for a goodish while, and done
well there, and had friends as has stuck by you, as we had at the Turon, you
feel sorry to leave it. What you've done you're sure of, no matter how it
mayn't suit you in some ways, nor how much better you expect to be off where
you are going to. You had that and had the good of it. What the coming time may
bring you can't reckon on. All kinds of cross luck and accidents may happen.
What's the use of money to a man if he smashes his hip and has to walk with a
crutch all his days? I've seen a miner with a thousand a month coming in, but
he'd been crushed pretty near to death with a fall of earth, and about half of
him was dead. What's a good dinner to a man that his doctor only allows him one
slice of meat, a bit of bread, and some toast and water? I've seen chaps like
them, and I'd sooner a deal be the poorest splitter, slogging away with a heavy
maul, and able, mind you, to swing it like a man, than one of those broken-down
screws. We'd had a good time there, Jim and I. We always had a kind spot in our
hearts for Turon and the diggings afterwards. Hard work, high pay, good friends
that would stick to a man back and edge, and a safe country to lie in plant in
as ever was seen. We was both middlin' sorry, in a manner of speaking, to clear
out. Not as Jim said much about it on account of Jeanie; but he thought it all
the same.</p>
<p>Well, of course, Kate and I got talkin' and talkin', first about the
diggings, and then about other things, till we got to old times in Melbourne,
and she began to look miserable and miserabler whenever she spoke about
marrying the old man, and wished she'd drownded herself first. She made me take
a whisky&mdash;a stiffish one that she mixed herself&mdash;for a parting glass,
and I felt it took a bit of effect upon me. I'd been having my whack during the
day. I wasn't no ways drunk; but I must have been touched more or less, because
I felt myself to be so sober.</p>
<p>'You're going at last, Dick,' says she; 'and I suppose we shan't meet again
in a hurry. It was something to have a look at you now and then. It reminded me
of the happy old times at St. Kilda.'</p>
<p>'Oh, come, Kate,' I said, 'it isn't quite so bad as all that. Besides, we'll
be back again in February, as like as not. We're not going for ever.'</p>
<p>'Are you telling me the truth, Richard Marston?' says she, standing up and
fixing her eyes full on me&mdash;fine eyes they were, too, in their way; 'or
are you trying another deceit, to throw me off the scent and get rid of me? Why
should you ever want to see my face after you leave?'</p>
<p>'A friendly face is always pleasant. Anyhow, Kate, yours is, though you did
play me a sharpish trick once, and didn't stick to me like some women might
have done.'</p>
<p>'Tell me this,' she said, leaning forward, and putting one hand on my
shoulder, while she seemed to look through the very soul of me&mdash;her face
grew deadly pale, and her lips trembled, as I'd seen them do once before when
she was regular beyond herself&mdash;'will you take me with you when you go for
good and all? I'm ready to follow you round the world. Don't be afraid of my
temper. No woman that ever lived ever did more for the man she loved than I'll
do for you. If Jeanie's good to Jim&mdash;and you know she is&mdash;I'll be
twice the woman to you, or I'll die for it. Don't speak!' she went on; 'I know
I threw you over once. I was mad with rage and shame. You know I had cause,
hadn't I, Dick? You know I had. To spite you, I threw away my own life then;
now it's a misery and a torment to me every day I live. I can bear it no
longer, I tell you. It's killing me&mdash;killing me day by day. Only say the
word, and I'll join you in Melbourne within the week&mdash;to be yours, and
yours only, as long as I live.'</p>
<p>I didn't think there was that much of the loving nature about her. She used
to vex me by being hard and uncertain when we were courting. I knew then she
cared about me, and I hadn't a thought about any other woman. Now when I didn't
ask her to bother herself about me, and only to let me alone and go her own
way, she must turn the tables on me, and want to ruin the pair of us slap over
again.</p>
<p>She'd thrown her arms round my neck and was sobbing on my shoulder when she
finished. I took her over to the sofa, and made her sit down by the side of
me.</p>
<p>'Kate,' I said, 'this won't do. There's neither rhyme nor reason about it.
I'm as fond of you as ever I was, but you must know well enough if you make a
bolt of it now there'll be no end of a bobbery, and everybody's thoughts will
be turned our way. We'll be clean bowled&mdash;the lot of us. Jim and I will be
jugged. You and Jeanie will be left to the mercy of the world, worse off by a
precious sight than ever you were in your lives. Now, if you look at it, what's
the good of spoiling the whole jimbang for a fancy notion about me? You and I
are safe to be first-rate friends always, but it will be the ruin of both of us
if we're fools enough to want to be more. You're living here like a regular
queen. You've got a good husband, that's proud of you and gives you everything
you can think of. You took him yourself, and you're bound to stick to him.
Besides, think of poor Jeanie and Jim. You'll spoil all their happiness; and,
more than all&mdash;don't make any mistake&mdash;you know what Jeanie thinks of
a woman who leaves her husband for another man.'</p>
<p>If you let a woman have a regular good cry and talk herself out, you can
mostly bring her round in the end. So after a bit Kate grew more reasonable.
That bit about Jeanie fetched her too. She knew her own sister would turn
against her&mdash;not harsh like, but she'd never be the same to her again as
long as she lived.</p>
<p>The lamp had been put out in the big hall. There was only one in this
parlour, and it wasn't over bright. I talked away, and last of all she came
round to my way of thinking; at any rate not to want to clear off from the old
man now, but to wait till I came back, or till I wrote to her.</p>
<p>'You are right, Dick,' she said at last, 'and you show your sense in talking
the way you have; though, if you loved as I do, you could not do it. But, once
more, there's no other woman that you're fonder of than me? It isn't that that
makes you so good? Dick Marston good!' and here she laughed bitterly. 'If I
thought that I should go mad.'</p>
<p>What was I to do? I could not tell her that I loved Gracey Storefield ten
times as much as I'd ever cheated myself into thinking I cared about her. So I
swore that I cared more for her than any woman in the whole world, and always
had done so.</p>
<p>This steadied her. We parted good friends, and she promised to keep quiet
and try and make the best of things. She turned up the lamp to show me the way
out, though the outer door of the hall was left open night and day. It was a
way we had at the Turon; no one troubled themselves to be particular about such
trifles as furniture and so on. There was very little small robbery there; it
was not worth while. All petty stealers were most severely punished into the
bargain.</p>
<p>As I stood up to say good-bye a small note dropped out of my breast-pocket.
It had shifted somehow. Kate always had an eye like a hawk. With one spring she
pounced upon it, and before I could interfere opened and read it! It was Gracey
Storefield's. She stood for one moment and glared in my face. I thought she had
gone mad. Then she threw the bit of paper down and trampled upon it, over and
over again.</p>
<p>'So, Dick Marston,' she cried out hoarsely, her very voice changed, 'you
have tricked me a second time! Your own Gracey! your own Gracey! and this, by
the date, at the very time you were letting me persuade myself, like a fool,
like an idiot that I was, that you still care for me! You have put the cap to
your villainy now. And, as God made me, you shall have cause&mdash;good
cause&mdash;to fear the woman you have once betrayed and twice scorned. Look to
yourself.'</p>
<p>She gazed at me for a moment with a face from which every trace of
expression had vanished, except that of the most devilish fury and
spite&mdash;the face of an evil spirit more than of a woman; and then she
walked slowly away. I couldn't help pitying her, though I cursed my own folly,
as I had done a thousand times, that I had ever turned my head or spoken a word
to her when first she crossed my path. I got into the street somehow; I hardly
knew what to think or to do. That danger was close at our heels I didn't doubt
for a moment. Everything seemed changed in a minute. What was going to happen?
Was I the same Dick Marston that had been strolling up Main Street a couple of
hours ago? All but off by the to-morrow evening's coach, and with all the world
before me, a good round sum in the bank; best part of a year's hard, honest
work it was the price of, too.</p>
<p>Then all kinds of thoughts came into my head. Would Kate, when her burst of
rage was over, go in for revenge in cold blood? She could hardly strike me
without at the same time hurting Jeanie through Jim. Should I trust her? Would
she come right, kiss, and make friends, and call herself a madwoman&mdash;a
reckless fool&mdash;as she'd often done before? No; she was in bitter earnest
this time. It did not pay to be slack in making off. Once we had been caught
napping, and once was enough.</p>
<p>The first thing to do was to warn Jim&mdash;poor old Jim, snoring away, most
like, and dreaming of taking the box-seat for himself and Jeanie at the agent's
next morning. It seemed cruel to wake him, but it would have been crueller not
to do so.</p>
<p>I walked up the narrow track that led up to the little gully with the moon
shining down upon the white quartz rock. The pathway wound through a 'blow' of
it. I threw a pebble at the door and waited till Jim came out.</p>
<p>'Who's there? Oh! it's you, old man, is it? It's rather late for a call; but
if you've come to spend the evening I'll get up, and we'll have a smoke,
anyhow.'</p>
<p>'You dress yourself, Jim,' I said, 'as quick as you can. Put on your hat and
come with me; there's something up.'</p>
<p>'My God!' says Jim, 'what is it? I'm a rank coward now I've got Jeanie.
Don't go and tell me we've got to cut and run again.'</p>
<p>'Something like it,' I said. 'If it hasn't come to that yet, it's not far
off.'</p>
<p>We walked up the gully together. Jim lit his pipe while I told him shortly
what had happened to me with Kate.</p>
<p>'May the devil fly away with her!' said Jim savagely, 'for a bad-minded,
bad-hearted jade; and then he'd wish he'd left her where she was. She'd be no
chop-down there even. I think sometimes she can't be Jeanie's sister at all.
They must have changed her, and mothered the wrong child on the old woman. My
word! but it's no laughing matter. What's to be done?'</p>
<p>'There's no going away by the coach to-morrow, I'm afraid. She's just the
woman to tear straight up the camp and let it all out before her temper cooled.
It would take a week to do that. The sergeant or Sir Ferdinand knows all about
it now. They'll lose no time, you may be certain.'</p>
<p>'And must I leave without saying good-night to Jeanie?' says Jim. 'No, by
&mdash;&mdash;! If I have half-a-dozen bullets through me, I'll go back and
hold her in my arms once more before I'm hunted off and through the country
like a wild dog once more. If that infernal Kate has given us away, by George,
I could go and kill her with my own hand! The cruel, murdering, selfish brute,
I believe she'd poison her mother for a ten-pound note!'</p>
<p>'No use swearing at Kate, Jim,' I said; 'that won't mend matters. It's not
the first time by a thousand that I've wished I'd never set eyes on her; but if
I'd never seen her that day on St. Kilda beach you'd never known Jeanie. So
there's evens as well as odds. The thing is, what are we to do now?'</p>
<p>'Dashed if I know. I feel stupid about tackling the bush again; and what can
I do with Jeanie? I wish I was dead. I've half a mind to go and shoot that
brute of a woman and then myself. But then, poor Jeanie! poor little Jeanie! I
can't stand it, Dick; I shall go mad!'</p>
<p>I thought Jim was going to break out crying just as he used when he was a
boy. His heart was a big soft one; and though he could face anything in the way
of work or fighting that a man dare do, and do two men's share very like, yet
his tears, mother said, laid very near his eyes, and till he was a grown man
they used to pump up on all sorts of occasions.</p>
<p>'Come, be a man, Jim,' I said, 'we've got to look the thing in the face;
there's no two ways about it. I shall go to Arizona Bill's claim and see what
he says. Anyhow I'll leave word with him what to do when we're gone. I'd advise
you not to try to see Jeanie; but if you will you must, I suppose. Good-bye,
old man. I shall make my way over to Jonathan's, borrow a horse from him, and
make tracks for the Hollow as soon as I can. You'd better leave Jeanie here and
do the same.'</p>
<p>Jim groaned, but said nothing. He wrung my hands till the bones seemed to
crack, and walked away without a word. We knew it was a chance whether we
should meet again.</p>
<p>I walked on pretty quick till I came to the flat where Arizona Bill and his
mates had their sluicing claim. There were six of them altogether, tall wiry
men all of them; they'd mostly been hunters and trappers in the Rocky Mountains
before the gold was struck at Suttor's Mill, in the Sacramento Valley. They had
been digging in '49 in California, but had come over when they heard from an
old mate of a placer diggings at Turon, richer than anything they had ever
tried in America.</p>
<p>This camp was half a mile from ours, and there was a bit of broken ground
between, so that I thought I was safe in having a word with them before I
cleared for Barnes's place, though I took care not to go near our own camp hut.
I walked over, and was making straight for the smallest hut, when a rough voice
hailed me.</p>
<p>'Hello! stranger, ye came darned near going to h&mdash;l with your boots on.
What did yer want agin that thar cabin?'</p>
<p>I saw then that in my hurry I had gone stumbling against a small hut where
they generally put their gold when the party had been washing up and had more
than was safe to start from camp with. In this they always put a grizzled old
hunter, about whom the yarn was that he never went to sleep, and could shoot
anything a mile off. It was thought a very unlikely thing that any gold he
watched would ever go crooked. Most people considered him a deal safer
caretaker than the escort.</p>
<p>'Oh! it's you, is it?' drawled Sacramento Joe. 'Why, what's doin' at yer old
camp?'</p>
<p>'What about?' said I.</p>
<p>'Wal, Bill and I seen three or four half-baked vigilantes that call
themselves police; they was a setting round the hut and looked as if they was
awaiting for somebody.'</p>
<p>'Tell Bill I want him, Joe,' I said.</p>
<p>'Can't leave guard nohow,' says the true grit old hunter, pointing to his
revolver, and dodging up and down with his lame leg, a crooked arm, and a seam
in his face like a terrible wound there some time or other. 'I darsn't leave
guard. You'll find him in that centre tent, with the red flag on it.'</p>
<p>I lifted the canvas flap of the door and went in. Bill raised himself in the
bed and looked at me quite coolly.</p>
<p>'I was to your location a while since,' he said. 'Met some friends of yours
there too. I didn't cotton to 'em muchly. Something has eventuated. Is that
so?'</p>
<p>'Yes. I want your help.' I told him shortly all I could tell him in the
time.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>He listened quietly, and made no remark for a time.</p>
<p>'So ye hev' bin a road agent. You and Jim, that darned innocent old cuss,
robbing mails and cattle ranches. It is a real scoop up for me, you bet. I'd
heern of bush-ranging in Australia, but I never reckoned on their bein' men
like you and Jim. So the muchacha went back on yer&mdash;snakes alive! I kinder
expected it. I reckon you're bound to git.'</p>
<p>'Yes, Bill, sharp's the word. I want you to draw my money and Jim's out of
the bank; it's all in my name. There's the deposit receipt. I'll back it over
to you. You give Jeanie what she wants, and send the rest when I tell you. Will
you do that for me, Bill? I've always been on the square with you and your
mates.'</p>
<p>'You hev', boy, that I'll not deny, and I'll corral the dollars for you.
It's an all-fired muss that men like you and Jim should have a black mark agin
your record. A spry hunter Jim would have made. I'd laid out to have had him to
Arizona yet&mdash;and you're a going to dust out right away, you say?'</p>
<p>'I'm off now. Jim's waited too long, I expect. One other thing; let Mr.
Haughton, across the creek, have this before daylight.'</p>
<p>'What, the Honourable!!! Lawful heart! Wal, I hope ye may strike a better
trail yet. Yer young, you and Jim, poor old Jim. Hold on. Hev' ye nary shootin'
iron?'</p>
<p>'No time,' I said. 'I haven't been to the camp.'</p>
<p>'Go slow, then. Wait here; you'll want suthin, may be, on the peraira. If ye
do, boy! Jim made good shootin' with this, ye mind. Take it and welcome; it'll
mind ye of old Arizona Bill.'</p>
<p>He handed me a beautifully finished little repeating rifle, hardly heavier
than a navy revolver, and a small bag of cartridges.</p>
<p>'Thar, that'll be company for ye, in case ye hev to draw a bead on
the&mdash;any one&mdash;just temp'ry like. Our horses is hobbled in Bates's
clearing. Take my old sorrel if ye can catch him.' He stopped for a second and
put his hand in a listening fashion. His hunter's ear was quicker than mine.
'Thar's a war party on the trail, I reckon. It's a roughish crossing at Slatey
Bar,' and he pointed towards the river, which we could plainly hear rushing
over a rocky bed. We shook hands, and as I turned down the steep river bank I
saw him walk slowly into his tent and close the canvas after him.</p>
<p>The line he pointed to was the one I fixed in my own mind to take long
before our talk was over. The Turon, always steep-banked, rocky in places, ran
here under an awful high bluff of slate rock. The rushing water in its narrow
channel had worn away the rock a good deal, and left ledges or bars under which
a deal of gold had been found. Easy enough to cross here on a kind of natural
ford. We had many a time walked over on Sundays and holidays for a little
kangaroo-shooting now and then. It was here Jim one day, when we were all
together for a ramble, surprised the Americans by his shooting with the little
Ballard rifle.</p>
<p>As I crossed there was just moon enough to show the deep pools and the
hurrying, tearing waters of the wild river, foaming betwixt the big boulders
and jags of rock which the bar was strewed with. In front the bank rose 300
feet like the roof of a house, with great overhanging crags of slate rock, and
a narrow track in and out between. If I had light enough to find this and get
to the top&mdash;the country was terribly rough for a few miles, with the
darkness coming on&mdash;I should be pretty well out of reach by daylight.</p>
<p>I had just struck the track when I heard voices and a horse's tramp on the
other side of the river. They seemed not to be sure whether I'd crossed or not,
and were tracking up and down on each side of the bar. I breasted the hill
track faster than I had done for many a day, and when I got to the top stopped
to listen, but could hear nothing. The moon had dropped suddenly; the forest
was as black as pitch. You couldn't see your hand before you.</p>
<p>I knew that I was safe now, if a hundred men were at my heels, till daybreak
at any rate. I had the two sides of the gully to guide me. I could manage to
make to the farm where the sorrel was at grass with a lot of other diggers'
horses. If I could get a saddle and catch the old horse I could put many a mile
between me and them before sundown. I stood still when I reached the top of the
bluff, partly to get breath and partly to take a last look at old Turon.</p>
<p>Below lay the goldfield clearly marked out by hundreds of camp-fires that
were still red and showed bright in the darkened sky. The course of the river
was marked by them, in and out, as most of the shallow diggings had followed
the river flats. Far back the fires glowed against the black forest, and just
before the moon fell I could catch the shine of the water in the deeper reaches
of the river.</p>
<p>It was the very picture of what I'd read about an army in camp&mdash;lines
of tents and a crowd of men all spread out over a bit of land hardly big enough
for a flock of sheep. Now and then a dog would bark&mdash;now a revolver would
go off. It was never quiet on Turon diggings, day or night.</p>
<p>Well, there they all were, tents and diggers, claims and windlasses, pumps
and water-wheels. I had been happy enough there, God knows; and perhaps I was
looking at it all for the last time. As I turned and made down the hill into
the black forest that spread below me like the sea, I felt as if I was leaving
everything that was any good in life behind with the Turon lights, and being
hunted once more, in spite of myself, into a desert of darkness and
despair.</p>
<h2>Chapter 31</h2>
<p>I got to Bates's paddocks about daylight, and went straight up to the hut
where the man lived that looked after it. Most of the diggers that cared about
their horses paid for their grass in farmers' and squatters' paddocks, though
the price was pretty high. Old Bates, who had a bit of a good grassed flat,
made a pretty fair thing out of it by taking in horses at half-a-crown a week
apiece. As luck would have it, the man in charge knew me; he'd seen me out with
the Yankees one day, and saw I was a friend with them, and when I said I'd come
for Bill's sorrel he thought it likely enough, and got out the saddle and
bridle. I tipped him well, and went off, telling him I was going to Wattle Flat
to look at a quartz-crushing plant that was for sale. I accounted for coming up
so early by saying I'd lost my road, and that I wanted to get to Wattle Flat
sharp, as another chap wished to buy the plant. I cut across the range, kept
the sun on my right hand, and pushed on for Jonathan's. I got there early, and
it's well I did. I rode the sorrel hard, but I knew he was pretty tough, and I
was able to pay for him if I killed him. I trusted to leaving him at
Jonathan's, and getting a fresh horse there. What with the walk over the bluff
and the forest, having no sleep the night before, and the bother and trouble of
it all, I was pretty well used up. I was real glad to see Jonathan's paddock
fence and the old house we'd thought so little of lately. It's wonderful how
soon people rise grand notions and begin to get too big for their boots.</p>
<p>'Hello, Dick, what's up?' says Jonathan. 'No swag, 'lastic-side boots,
flyaway tie, new rifle, old horse; looks a bit fishy don't it?'</p>
<p>'I can't stop barneying,' I said. 'Have you a decent horse to give me? The
game's up. I must ride night and day till I get home. Heard anything?'</p>
<p>'No; but Billy the Boy's just rode up. I hear him a-talkin' to the gals. He
knows if anybody does. I'll take the old moke and put him in the paddock. I can
let you have a stunner.'</p>
<p>'All right; I'll go in and have some breakfast. It's as much as I dare stop
at all now.'</p>
<p>'Why, Dick Marston, is that you? No, it can't be,' said both girls together.
'Why, you look like a ghost. He doesn't; he looks as if he'd been at a ball all
night. Plenty of partners, Dick?'</p>
<p>'Never mind, Dick,' says Maddie; 'go and make yourself comfortable in that
room, and I'll have breakfast for you while you'd let a cow out of the bail. We
don't forget our friends.'</p>
<p>'If all our friends were as true as you, Maddie,' I said, rather down-like,
'I shouldn't be here to-day.'</p>
<p>'Oh! that's it, is it?' says she; 'we're only indebted to somebody's laying
the traps on&mdash;a woman of course&mdash;for your honour's company. Never
mind, old man, I won't hit you when you're down. But, I say, you go and have a
yarn with Billy the Boy&mdash;he's in the kitchen. I believe the young imp
knows something, but he won't let on to Bell and I.'</p>
<p>While the steaks were frying&mdash;and they smelt very good, bad as I
felt&mdash;I called out Master Billy and had a talk with him. I handed him a
note to begin with. It was money well spent, and, you mark my words, a shilling
spent in grog often buys a man twenty times the worth of it in information, let
alone a pound.</p>
<p>Billy had grown a squarish-set, middle-sized chap; his hair wasn't so long,
and his clothes were better; his eye was as bright and bold-looking. As he
stood tapping one of his boots with his whip, he looked for all the world like
a bull-terrier.</p>
<p>'My colonial oath, Dick, you're quite the gentleman&mdash;free with your
money just the same as ever. You takes after the old governor; he always paid
well if you told him the truth. I remember him giving me a hidin' when I was a
kiddy for saying something I wasn't sure of. My word! I was that sore for a
week after I couldn't button my shirt. But ain't it a pity about Jim?'</p>
<p>'Oh, that's it. What about Jim?'</p>
<p>'Why, the p'leece grabbed him, of course. You fellers don't think you're
going on for ever and ever, keepin' the country in a state of terrorism, as the
papers say. No, Dick, it's wrong and wicked and sinful. You'll have to knock
under and give us young uns a chance.'</p>
<p>Here the impudent young rascal looked in my face as bold as brass and burst
out laughing. He certainly was the cheekiest young scoundrel I ever came
across. But in his own line you couldn't lick him.</p>
<p>'Jim's took,' he said, and he looked curiously over at me. 'I seen the
p'leece a-takin' him across the country to Bargo early this morning. There was
poor old Jim a-lookin' as if he was goin' to be hanged, with a chap leading the
screw he was on, and Jim's long legs tied underneath. I was gatherin' cattle, I
was. I drew some up just for a stall, and had a good look.'</p>
<p>'How many men were with him?'</p>
<p>'Only two; and they're to pass through Bargo Brush about sundown to-night,
or a bit earlier. I asked one of the men the road; said I'd lost myself, and
would be late home. Ha! ha! ha!'</p>
<p>And how the young villain laughed till the tears came into his eyes, while
he danced about like a blackfellow.</p>
<p>'See here, Billy,' I said, 'here's another pound for you, and there'll be a
fiver after if you stick well to me to-day. I won't let Jim be walked off to
Berrima without a flutter to save him. It'll be the death of him. He's not like
me, and he's got a young wife besides.'</p>
<p>'More fool he, Dick. What does a cross cove want with a wife? He can't never
expect to do any good with a wife follerin' of him about. I'm agin marrying,
leastways as long as a chap's sound on his pins. But I'll stick to you, Dick,
and, what's more, I can take you a short cut to the brush, and we can wait in a
gully and see the traps come up. You have a snack and lie down for a bit. I
seen you were done when you came up. I'll have the horses ready saddled
up.'</p>
<p>'How about the police? Suppose they come this way.'</p>
<p>'Not they. They split and took across towards the Mountain Hut, where you
all camped with the horses. I didn't see 'em; but I cut their tracks. Five shod
horses. They might be here to-morrow.'</p>
<p>A bush telegraph ain't a bad thing. They're not all as good as Billy the
Boy. But the worst of 'em, like a bad sheep dog, is a deal better than
none.</p>
<p>A bush telegraph, you see, is mostly worked about the neighbourhood he was
born in. He's not much good anywhere else. He's like a blackfellow outside of
his own 'tauri'. He's at sea. But within twenty or thirty miles of where he was
born and bred he knows every track, every range, every hill, every creek, as
well as all the short cuts and by-roads. He can bring you miles shorter than
any one that only follows the road. He can mostly track like a blackfellow, and
tell you whether the cattle or horses which he sees the tracks of are belonging
to his country or are strangers. He can get you a fresh horse on a pinch, night
or day, for he knows everybody's paddocks and yards, as well as the number,
looks, pace, and pluck of everybody's riding horses&mdash;of many of which he
has 'taken a turn' out of&mdash;that is, ridden them hard and far, and returned
them during the night. Of course he can be fined&mdash;even imprisoned for
this&mdash;when he is caught in the act. Herein lies the difficulty. I felt
like another man after a wash, a nip, and a real good meal, with the two girls
sitting close by, and chattering away as usual.</p>
<p>'Do you know,' says Bella, 'it half serves you right. Not that that Port
Phillip woman was right to peach. She ought to have had her tongue torn out
first, let alone go open-mouthed at it. But mightn't you have come down here
from the Turon on Sundays and holidays now and then, and had a yarn with us
all?'</p>
<p>'Of course we ought, and we deserve to be kicked&mdash;the lot of us; but
there were good reasons why we didn't like to. We were regularly boxed up with
the diggers, nobody knew who we were, or where we came from, and only for this
Jezebel never would have known. If we'd come here they'd have all dropped that
we were old friends, and then they'd have known all about us.'</p>
<p>'Well, I'm glad you've lost your characters,' says Maddie. 'You won't have
to be so particular now, and you can come as often as Sir Ferdinand will let
you. Good-bye. Billy's waving his hat.'</p>
<p>It wasn't long before I was in the saddle and off again. I'd made a bit of a
bargain with Jonathan, who sold me a pair of riding boots, butcher's, and a big
tweed poncho. The boots were easier to take a long rough ride in than trousers,
and I wanted the poncho to keep the Ballard rifle under. It wouldn't do to have
it in your hand all the time.</p>
<p>As we rode along I settled upon the way I'd try and set poor Jim free. Bad
off as I was myself I couldn't bear to see him chained up, and knew that he was
going for years and years to a place more wicked and miserable than he'd ever
heard of.</p>
<p>After riding twenty miles the sun was getting low, when Billy pointed to a
trail which came broad ways across the road, and which then followed it.</p>
<p>'Here they are&mdash;p'leece, and no mistake. Here's their horses' tracks
right enough. Here's the prisoner's horse, see how he stumbled? and this road
they're bound to go till they cross the Stony point, and get into Bargo Brush,
near a creek.'</p>
<p>We had plenty of time by crossing a range and running a blind creek down to
be near the place where the troopers must pass as they crossed the main creek.
We tied up the horses a hundred yards' distance behind us in the forest, and I
made ready to rescue Jim, if it could be managed anyhow.</p>
<p>How was it to be done? I could depend on the rifle carrying true at short
ranges; but I didn't like the notion of firing at a man behind his back, like.
I hardly knew what to do, when all of a sudden two policemen showed up at the
end of the track nearest the creek.</p>
<p>One man was a bit in front&mdash;riding a fine horse, too. The next one had
a led horse, on which rode poor old Jim, looking as if he was going to be
hanged that day, as Billy said, though I knew well he wasn't thinking about
himself. I don't believe Jim ever looked miserable for so long since he was
born. Whatever happened to him before he'd have a cry or a fight, and it would
be over. But now his poor old face looked that wretched and miserable, as if
he'd never smile again as long as he lived. He didn't seem to care where they
took him; and when the old horse stumbled and close upon fell down he didn't
take notice.</p>
<p>When I saw that, my mind was made up. I couldn't let them take him away to
his death. I could see he wouldn't live a month. He'd go fretting his life
about Jeanie, and after the free life he'd always led he'd fall sick like the
blacks when they're shut up, and die without any reason but because a wild bird
won't live in a cage.</p>
<p>So I took aim and waited till they were just crossing the creek into the
forest. The leading man was just riding up the bank, and the one that led Jim's
horse was on the bit of a sand bed that the water had brought down. He was the
least bit ahead of Jim, when I pulled trigger, and sent a ball into him, just
under the collar-bone. I fired high on purpose. He drops off his saddle like a
dead man. The next minute Billy the Boy raises the most awful corroboree of
screams and howls, enough for a whole gang of bush-rangers, if they went in for
that sort of thing. He emptied four chambers of his revolver at the leading
trooper right away, and I fired at his horse. The constable never
doubted&mdash;the attack was so sudden and savage like&mdash;but there was a
party of men hid in the brush. Billy's shots had whistled round him, and mine
had nearly dropped his horse, so he thought it no shame to make a bolt and
leave his mate, as seemed very bad hit, in our hands.</p>
<p>His horse's hand-gallop growed fainter and fainter in the distance, and then
we unbound poor Jim, set his feet at liberty, and managed to dispose of the
handcuffs. Jim's face began to look more cheerful, but he was down in the mouth
again when he saw the wounded man. He began at once to do all he could for him.
We stopped a short distance behind the brush, which had already helped us
well.</p>
<p>Jim propped up the poor chap, whose life-blood was flowing red through the
bullet-hole, and made him as comfortable as he could. 'I must take your horse,
mate,' he says; 'but you know it's only the fortune of war. A man must look
after himself. Some one'll come along the road soon.' He mounted the trooper's
horse, and we slipped through the trees&mdash;it was getting dark
now&mdash;till we came to our horses. Then we all rode off together. We took
Billy the Boy with us until he put us on to a road that led us into the country
that we knew. We could make our own way from there, and so we sent off our
scout, telling him to ride to the nearest township and say he'd seen a trooper
lying badly wounded by the Bargo Brush roadside. The sooner he was seen to, the
better chance he'd have.</p>
<p>Jim brightened up considerably after this. He told me how he'd gone back to
say good-bye to Jeanie&mdash;how the poor girl went into fits, and he couldn't
leave her. By the time she got better the cottage was surrounded by police;
there was no use being shot down without a chance, so he gave himself up.</p>
<p>'My word, Dick,' he said, 'I wished for a bare-backed horse, and a deep
gully, then; but it wasn't to be. There was no horse handy, and I'd only have
been carried into my own place a dead man and frightened the life out of poor
Jeanie as well.'</p>
<p>'You're worth a dozen dead men yet, Jim,' I said. 'Keep up your pecker, old
man. We'll get across to the Hollow some time within the next twenty-four
hours, and there we'll be safe anyhow. They can't touch Jeanie, you know; and
you're not short of what cash she'll want to keep her till this blows over a
bit.'</p>
<p>'And what am I to do all the time?' he says so pitiful like. 'We're that
fond of one another, Dick, that I couldn't hardly bear her out of my sight, and
now I'll be months and months and months without a look at her pretty face,
where I've never seen anything yet but love and kindness. Too good for me she
always was; and what have I brought her to? My God! Dick, I wish you'd shot me
instead of the constable, poor devil!'</p>
<p>'Well, you wasn't very far apart,' I says, chaffing like. 'If that old horse
they put you on had bobbed forward level with him you'd have got plugged
instead. But it's no use giving in, Jim. We must stand up to our fight now, or
throw up the sponge. There's no two ways about it.'</p>
<p>We rattled on then without speaking, and never cried crack till we got to
Nulla Mountain, where we knew we were pretty safe not to be followed up. We
took it easier then, and stopped to eat a bit of bread and meat the girls had
put up for me at Jonathan's. I'd never thought of it before. When I took the
parcel out of the pocket of my poncho I thought it felt deuced heavy, and
there, sure enough, was one of those shilling flasks of brandy they sell for
chaps to go on the road with.</p>
<p>Brandy ain't a good thing at all times and seasons, and I've seen more than
one man, or a dozen either, that might just as well have sawed away at their
throats with a blunt knife as put the first glass to their lips. But we was
both hungry, thirsty, tired, miserable, and pretty well done and beaten, though
we hadn't had time to think about it. That drop of brandy seemed as if it had
saved our lives. I never forgot it, nor poor Maddie Barnes for thinking of it
for me. And I did live to do her a good turn back&mdash;much as there's been
said again me, and true enough, too.</p>
<p>It was a long way into the night, and not far from daylight either, when we
stumbled up to the cave&mdash;dead beat, horses and men both. We'd two minds to
camp on the mountain, but we might have been followed up, hard as we'd ridden,
and we didn't like to throw a chance away. We didn't want the old man to laugh
at us, and we didn't want to do any more time in Berrima&mdash;not now, anyhow.
We'd been living too gay and free a life to begin with the jug all over
again.</p>
<p>So we thought we'd make one job of it, and get right through, if we had to
sleep for a week after it. It would be slow enough, but anything was better
than what we'd gone through lately.</p>
<p>After we'd got down the mountain and on the flat land of the valley it
rested our feet a bit, that was pretty nigh cut to pieces with the rocks. Our
horses were that done we dursn't ride 'em for hours before. As we came close,
out walks old Crib, and smells at us. He knew us in a minute, and jumped up and
began to try and lick Jim's hand: the old story. He just gave one sort of sniff
at me, as much as to say, 'Oh! it's you, is it?' Then he actually gave a kind
of half-bark. I don't believe he'd barked for years, such a queer noise it was.
Anyhow, it woke up dad, and he came out pretty sharp with a revolver in his
hand. As soon as he saw the old dog walking alongside of us he knew it was
right, and begins to feel for his pipe. First thing father always did as soon
as any work or fighting or talking was over was to get out his pipe and light
it. He didn't seem the same man without it.</p>
<p>'So you've found your way back again, have ye?' he says. 'Why, I thought you
was all on your way to Californy by this time. Ain't this Christmas week? Why,
I was expecting to come over to Ameriky myself one of these days, when all the
derry was over &mdash;&mdash; Why, what's up with the boy?'</p>
<p>Jim was standing by, sayin' nothing, while I was taking off the saddles and
bridles and letting the horses go, when all of a sudden he gives a lurch
forward, and if the old man hadn't laid hold of him in his strong arms and
propped him up he'd have gone down face foremost like a girl in a dead
faint.</p>
<p>'What's up with him, Dick?' says father, rather quick, almost as if he was
fond of him, and had some natural feeling&mdash;sometimes I raly think he
had&mdash;'been any shooting?'</p>
<p>'Yes; not at him, though. Tell you all about it in the morning. He's eaten
nothing, and we've been travelling best part of twenty-four hours right off the
reel.'</p>
<p>'Hold him up while I fetch out the pannikin. There's plenty of grub inside.
He'll be all right after a sleep.'</p>
<p>A drop of rum and water brought him to, and after that we made ourselves a
cup of tea and turned in. The sun was pretty high when I woke. When I looked
out there was the old man sitting on the log by the fire, smoking. What was a
deal more curious, I saw the half-caste, Warrigal, coming up from the flat,
leading a horse and carrying a pair of hobbles. Something made me look over to
a particular corner where Starlight always slept when he was at the Hollow.
Sure enough there was the figure of a man rolled up in a cloak. I knew by the
way his boots and things were thrown about that it could be no other than
Starlight.</p>
<h2>Chapter 32</h2>
<p>I'd settled in my mind that it couldn't be any one else, when he sat up,
yawned, and looked round as if he had not been away from the old place a
week.</p>
<p>'Ha! Richard, here we are again! "Feeds the boar in the old frank?" The
governor told me you and Jim had made back. Dreadful bore, isn't it? Just when
we'd all rubbed off the rust of our bush life and were getting civilised. I
feel very seriously ill-treated, I assure you. I have a great mind to apply to
the Government for compensation. That's the worst of these new inspectors, they
are so infernally zealous.'</p>
<p>'You were too many for them, it seems. I half thought you might have been
nailed. How the deuce did you get the office in time?'</p>
<p>'The faithful Warrigal, as usual, gave me timely warning, and brought a
horse, of course. He will appear on the Judgment Day leading Rainbow, I firmly
believe. Why he should be so confoundedly anxious about my welfare I can't make
out&mdash;I can't, really. It's his peculiar form of mania, I suppose. We all
suffer from some madness or other.'</p>
<p>'How the blazes did he know the police were laid on to the lot of us?' I
said.</p>
<p>'I didn't know myself that your Kate had come the double on you. I might
have known she would, though. Well, it seems Warrigal took it into his
semi-barbaric head to ride into Turon and loaf about, partly to see me, and
partly about another matter that your father laid him on about. He was standing
about near the Prospectors' Arms, late on Friday night, doing nothing and
seeing everything, as usual, when he noticed Mrs. Mullockson run out of the
house like a Bedlamite. "My word, that missis big one coolah!" was his
expression, and made straight for the camp. Now Warrigal had seen you come out
just before. He doesn't like you and Jim over much&mdash;bad taste, I tell him,
on his part&mdash;but I suppose he looks upon you as belonging to the family.
So he stalked the fair and furious Kate.'</p>
<p>'That was how it was, then?'</p>
<p>'Yes, much in that way. I must say, Dick, that if you are so extremely fond
of&mdash;well&mdash;studying the female character, you should carry on the
pursuit more discreetly. Just see what this miscalculation has cost your
friends!'</p>
<p>'Confound her! She's a heartless wretch, and I hope she'll die in a
ditch.'</p>
<p>'Exactly. Well, she knocked, and a constable opened the outer door.</p>
<p>'"I want to see Sir Ferdinand," she says.</p>
<p>'"He's in bed and can't be disturbed," says the bobby. "Any message I can
deliver?"</p>
<p>'"I have important information," says she. "Rouse him up, or you'll be sorry
for it."</p>
<p>'"Won't it do to-morrow morning?" says he.</p>
<p>'"No, it won't," says she, stamping her foot. "Do what I tell you, and don't
stand there like a fool."</p>
<p>'She waited a bit. Then, Warrigal says, out came Sir Ferdinand, very polite.
"What can I do for you," says he, "Mrs. Mullockson?"</p>
<p>'"Should you like to know where the Marstons are, Sir Ferdinand," says she,
"Dick and Jim?"</p>
<p>'"Know? Would I not?" says he. "No end of warrants out for them; since that
Ballabri Bank robbery they seem to have disappeared under ground. And that
fellow Starlight, too! Most remarkable man of his day. I'd give my eyes to put
the bracelets upon him."</p>
<p>'She whispered something into his ear.</p>
<p>'"Guard, turn out," he roars out first; then, dropping his voice, says out,
"My dear Mrs. Mullockson" (you should hear Warrigal imitate him), "you have
made my fortune&mdash;officially, I mean, of course. I shall never forget your
kindness. Thanks, a thousand times."</p>
<p>'"Don't thank me," she says, and she burst out crying, and goes slowly back
to the hotel.</p>
<p>'Warrigal had heard quite enough. He rips over to Daly's mob, borrows a
horse, saddle, and bridle, and leads him straight down to our camp. He roused
me up about one o'clock, and I could hardly make any explanation to my mates.
Such stunning good fellows they were, too! I wonder whether I shall ever
associate with gentlemen again? The chances are against it.</p>
<p>'I had all kinds of trouble to tell them I was going away with Warrigal, and
yet not to tell too much.</p>
<p>'"What the dickens," says Clifford, "can you want, going away with this
familiar of yours at this hour of the night? You're like the fellow in Scott's
novel ('Anne of Geierstein') that I was reading over again yesterday&mdash;the
mysterious stranger that's called for at midnight by the Avenger of Blood,
departs with him and is never seen more."</p>
<p>'"In case you never see me afterwards," I said, "we'd better say good-bye.
We've been good mates and true friends, haven't we?"</p>
<p>'"Never better," he said. "I don't know what we shall do without you. But,
of course, you're not going very far?"</p>
<p>'"Good-bye, in case," I said. "Anyhow, I'll write you a line," and as I
shook hands with them&mdash;two regular trumps, if ever there were any in the
world&mdash;I had a kind of notion I'd never see them again. Hardly think I
shall, either. Sir Ferdinand surrounded the hut about an hour later, and made
them come out one by one&mdash;both of them and the wages man. I daresay they
were surprised.</p>
<p>'"Where's the fourth man, Clifford?" says Sir Ferdinand. "Just ask him to
come out, will you?"</p>
<p>'"What, Frank Haughton?" says he.</p>
<p>'I heard most of this from that young devil, Billy the Boy. He saw Sir
Ferdinand ride up, so he hid close by, just for the fun of hearing how he got
on. He'd seen Warrigal and me ride away.</p>
<p>'"Frank Devil!" bangs out Sir Ferdinand, who'd begun to get his monkey up.
"How should I know his infernal purser's name? No man, it seems to me, has his
right name on this confounded goldfield. I mean Starlight&mdash;Starlight the
cattle stealer, the mail robber, the bush-ranger, whose name is notorious over
the three colonies, and New Zealand to boot&mdash;your intimate friend and
partner for the last nine months!"</p>
<p>'"You perfectly amaze me," says Clifford. "But can't you be mistaken? Is
your information to be depended upon?"</p>
<p>'"Mine came from a jealous woman," says Sir Ferdinand. "They may generally
be depended upon for a straight tip. But we're losing time. When did he leave
the claim, and which way did he go?"</p>
<p>'"I have no idea which way he went," says Clifford. "He did not say, but he
left about an hour since."</p>
<p>'"On foot or on horseback?"</p>
<p>'"On horseback."</p>
<p>'"Any one with him?"</p>
<p>'"Yes, another horseman."</p>
<p>'"What was he like?"</p>
<p>'"Slight, dark man, youngish, good-looking."</p>
<p>'"Warrigal the half-caste! By George! warrants out for him also," says Sir
Ferdinand. "On a good horse, of course, with an hour's start. We may give up
the idea of catching him this time. Follow him up as a matter of form.
Good-bye, Clifford. You'll hear news of your friend before long, or I'm much
mistaken."</p>
<p>'"Stop, Sir Ferdinand, you must pardon me; but I don't exactly understand
your tone. The man that we knew by the name of Frank Haughton may be, as you
say, an escaped criminal. All I know is that he lived with us since we came
here, and that no fellow could have behaved more truly like a man and a
gentleman. As far as we are concerned, I have a material guarantee that he has
been scrupulously honest. Do you mean to hint for one moment that we were aware
of his previous history, or in any way mixed up with his acts?"</p>
<p>'"If I do, what then?" says Sir Ferdinand, laughing.</p>
<p>'"The affair is in no way ludicrous," says Clifford, very stiff and
dignified. "I hold myself to have received an insult, and must ask you to refer
me to a friend."</p>
<p>'"Do you know that I could arrest you and Hastings now and lock you up on
suspicion of being concerned with him in the Ballabri Bank robbery?" says Sir
Ferdinand in a stern voice. "Don't look so indignant. I only say I could. I am
not going to do so, of course. As to fighting you, my dear fellow, I am
perfectly at your service at all times and seasons whenever I resign my
appointment as Inspector of Police for the colony of New South Wales. The Civil
Service regulations do not permit of duelling at present, and I found it so
deuced hard to work up to the billet that I am not going to imperil my
continuance therein. After all, I had no intention of hurting your feelings,
and apologise if I did. As for that rascal Starlight, he would deceive the very
devil himself."</p>
<p>'And so Sir Ferdinand rode off.'</p>
<p>'How did you come; by Jonathan's?'</p>
<p>'We called nowhere. Warrigal, as usual, made a short cut of his own across
the bush&mdash;scrubs, gullies, mountains, all manner of desert paths. We made
the Hollow yesterday afternoon, and went to sleep in a nook known to us of old.
We dropped in to breakfast here at daylight, and I felt sleepy enough for
another snooze.'</p>
<p>'We're all here again, it seems,' I said, sour enough. 'I suppose we'll have
to go on the old lay; they won't let us alone when we're doing fair work and
behaving ourselves like men. They must take the consequences, d&mdash;n
them!'</p>
<p>'Ha! very true,' says Starlight in his dreamy kind of way. 'Most true,
Richard. Society should make a truce occasionally, or proclaim an amnesty with
offenders of our stamp. It would pay better than driving us to desperation. How
is Jim? He's worse off than either of us, poor fellow.'</p>
<p>'Jim's very bad. He can't get over being away from Jeanie. I never saw him
so down in the mouth this years.'</p>
<p>'Poor old Jim, he's a deal too good for the place. Sad mistake this getting
married. People should either keep straight or have no relatives to bear the
brunt of their villainies. "But, soft," as they say in the play, "where am I?"
I thought I was a virtuous miner again. Here we are at this devil-discovered,
demon-haunted old Hollow again&mdash;first cousin to the pit of Acheron.
There's no help for it, Dick. We must play our parts gallantly, as demons of
this lower world, or get hissed off the stage.'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>We didn't do much for a few days, you may be sure. There was nothing to do,
for one thing; and we hadn't made up our mind what our line was to be. One
thing was certain: there would be more row made about us than ever. We should
have all the police in the country worried and barked at by the press, the
people, the Government, and their superior officers till they got something to
show about us. Living at the diggings under the nose of the police, without
their having the least suspicion who we were, was bad enough; but the rescue of
Jim and the shooting of a policeman in charge of him was more serious&mdash;the
worst thing that had happened yet.</p>
<p>There would be the devil to pay if they couldn't find a track of us. No
doubt money would be spent like water in bribing any one who might give
information about us. Every one would be tried that we had ever been known to
be friendly with. A special body of men could be told off to make a dart to any
spot they might get wind of near where we had been last seen.</p>
<p>We had long talks and barneys over the whole thing&mdash;sometimes by
ourselves with Starlight, sometimes with father. A long time it was before we
settled upon any regular put-up bit of work to do.</p>
<p>Sooner or later we began to see the secret of the Hollow would be found out.
There was no great chance in the old times with only a few shepherds and
stock-riders wandering through the bush, once in a way straggling over the
country. But now the whole colony swarmed with miners, who were always
prospecting, as they called it&mdash;that is, looking out for fresh patches of
gold. Now, small parties of these men&mdash;bold, hardy, experienced
chaps&mdash;would take a pick and shovel, a bucket, and a tin dish, with a few
weeks' rations, and scour the whole countryside. They would try every creek,
gully, hillside, and river bed. If they found the colour of gold, the least
trace of it in a dish of wash-dirt, they would at once settle down themselves.
If it went rich the news would soon spread, and a thousand men might be
gathered in one spot&mdash;the bank of a small creek, the side of a steep
range&mdash;within a fortnight, with ten thousand more sure to follow within a
month.</p>
<p>That might happen at any time on one of the spurs of Nulla Mountain; and the
finding out of the track down to the Hollow by some one of the dozens of
rambling, shooting, fishing diggers would be as certain to happen as the sun to
rise.</p>
<p>Well, the country had changed, and we were bound to change with it. We
couldn't stop boxed up in the Hollow day after day, and month after month,
shooting and horse-breaking, doing nothing and earning nothing.</p>
<p>If we went outside there were ten times more men looking out for us than
ever, ten times more chance of our being tracked or run down than ever. That we
knew from the newspapers. How did we see them? Oh, the old way. We sent out our
scout, Warrigal, and he got our letters and papers too, from a 'sure hand', as
Starlight said the old people in the English wars used to say.</p>
<p>The papers were something to see. First he brought us in a handbill that was
posted in Bargo, like this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD.<br>
<br>
The above reward will be paid to any one giving information as to the
whereabouts of Richard Marston, James Marston, and a man whose name is unknown,
but who can be identified chiefly by the appellation of Starlight.</blockquote>
<p>'Pleasing way of drawing attention to a gentleman's private residence,' says
Starlight, smiling first and looking rather grim afterwards. 'Never mind, boys,
they'll increase that reward yet, by Jove! It will have to be a thousand a
piece if they don't look a little sharper.'</p>
<p>We laughed, and dad growled out&mdash;</p>
<p>'Don't seem to have the pluck, any on ye, to tackle a big touch again. I
expect they'll send a summons for us next, and get old Bill Barkis, the bailiff
at Bargo, to serve it.'</p>
<p>'Come, come, governor,' says Starlight, 'none of that. We've got quite
enough devil in us yet, without your stirring him up. You must give us time,
you know. Let's see what this paper says. "Turon Star"! What a godsend to
it!</p>
<blockquote>'BUSH-RANGERS!<br>
<br>
'STARLIGHT AND THE MARSTONS AGAIN.<br>
<br>
'The announcement will strike our readers, if not with the most profound
astonishment, certainly with considerable surprise, that these celebrated
desperadoes, for whose apprehension such large sums have been offered, for whom
the police in all the colonies have made such unremitting search, should have
been discovered in our midst. Yet such is the case. On this very morning, from
information received, our respected and efficient Inspector of Police, Sir
Ferdinand Morringer, proceeded soon after midnight to the camp of Messrs.
Clifford and Hastings. He had every reason to believe that he would have had no
difficulty in arresting the famous Starlight, who, under the cognomen of the
Honourable Frank Haughton, has been for months a partner in this claim. The
shareholders were popularly known as "the three Honourables", it being rumoured
that both Mr. Clifford and Mr. Hastings were entitled to that prefix, if not to
a more exalted one.<br>
<br>
'With characteristic celerity, however, the famous outlaw had shortly before
quitted the place, having received warning and been provided with a fast horse
by his singular retainer, Warrigal, a half-caste native of the colony, who is
said to be devotedly attached to him, and who has been seen from time to time
on the Turon.<br>
<br>
'Of the Marston brothers, the elder one, Richard, would seem to have been
similarly apprised, but James Marston was arrested in his cottage in Specimen
Gully. Having been lately married, he was apparently unwilling to leave his
home, and lingered too long for prudence.<br>
<br>
'While rejoicing, as must all good citizens, at the discovery of evil-doers and
the capture of one member of a band of notorious criminals, we must state in
fairness and candour that their conduct has been, while on the field as miners,
free from reproach in every way. For James Marston, who was married but a short
while since to a Melbourne young lady of high personal attractions and the most
winning amiability, great sympathy has been expressed by all
classes.</blockquote>
<p>So much for the "Star". Everybody is sorry for you, old man,' he says to
Jim. 'I shouldn't wonder if they'd make you a beak if you'd stayed there long
enough. I'm afraid Dick's dropping the policeman won't add to our popularity,
though.'</p>
<p>'He's all right,' I said. 'Hurrah! look here. I'm glad I didn't finish the
poor beggar. Listen to this, from the "Turon Banner":&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>'BUSH-RANGING REVIVED.<br>
<br>
'The good old days have apparently not passed away for ever, when mail
robberies and hand-to-hand conflicts with armed robbers were matters of weekly
occurrence. The comparative lull observable in such exciting occurrences of
late has been proved to be but the ominous hush of the elements that precedes
the tempest. Within the last few days the mining community has been startled by
the discovery of the notorious gang of bush-rangers, Starlight and the
Marstons, domiciled in the very heart of the diggings, attired as ordinary
miners, and&mdash;for their own purposes possibly&mdash;leading the laborious
lives proper to the avocation. They have been fairly successful, and as miners,
it is said, have shown themselves to be manly and fair-dealing men. We are not
among those who care to judge their fellow-men harshly. It may be that they had
resolved to forsake the criminal practices which had rendered them so unhappily
celebrated. James Marston had recently married a young person of most
respectable family and prepossessing appearance. As far as may be inferred from
this step and his subsequent conduct, he had cut loose from his former
habitudes. He, with his brother, Richard Marston, worked an adjoining claim to
the Arizona Sluicing Company, with the respected shareholders of which they
were on terms of intimacy. The well-known Starlight, as Mr. Frank Haughton,
became partner and tent-mate with the Hon. Mr. Clifford and Mr. Hastings, an
aristocratic society in which the manners and bearing of this extraordinary man
permitted him to mingle without suspicion of detection.<br>
<br>
'Suddenly information was furnished to the police respecting all three men. We
are not at present aware of the source from which the clue was obtained.
Suffice it to say that Sir Ferdinand Morringer promptly arranged for the
simultaneous action of three parties of police with the hope of capturing all
three outlaws. But in two cases the birds were flown. Starlight's "ame damnee",
a half-caste named Warrigal, had been observed on the field the day before. By
him he was doubtless furnished with a warning, and the horse upon which he left
his abode shortly before the arrival of Sir Ferdinand. The elder Marston had
also eluded the police. But James Marston, hindered possibly by domestic ties,
was captured at his cottage at Specimen Gully. For him sympathy has been
universally expressed. He is regarded rather as a victim than as an active
agent in the many criminal offences chargeable to the account of Starlight's
gang.<br>
<br>
'Since writing the above we have been informed that trooper Walsh, who with
another constable was escorting James Marston to Bargo Gaol, has been brought
in badly wounded. The other trooper reports that he was shot down and the party
attacked by persons concealed in the thick timber near Wild Horse Creek, at the
edge of Bargo Brush. In the confusion that ensued the prisoner escaped. It was
at first thought that Walsh was fatally injured, but our latest report gives
good hope of his recovery.<br>
<br>
'We shall be agreeably surprised if this be the end and not the commencement of
a series of darker tragedies.'</blockquote>
<h2>Chapter 33</h2>
<p>A month's loafing in the Hollow. Nothing doing and nothing to think of
except what was miserable enough, God knows. Then things began to shape
themselves, in a manner of speaking. We didn't talk much together; but each man
could see plain enough what the others was thinking of. Dad growled out a word
now and then, and Warrigal would look at us from time to time with a flash in
his hawk's eyes that we'd seen once or twice before and knew the meaning of. As
for Jim, we were bound to do something or other, if it was only to keep him
from going melancholy mad. I never seen any man changed more from what he used
to be than Jim did. He that was the most careless, happy-go-lucky chap that
ever stepped, always in a good temper and full of his larks. At the end of the
hottest day in summer on the plains, with no water handy, or the middle of the
coldest winter night in an ironbark forest, and we sitting on our horses
waiting for daylight, with the rain pouring down our backs, not game to light a
fire, and our hands that cold we could hardly hold the reins, it was all one to
Jim. Always jolly, always ready to make little of it all. Always ready to laugh
or chaff or go on with monkey tricks like a boy. Now it was all the other way
with him. He'd sit grizzling and smoking by himself all day long. No getting a
word out of him. The only time he seemed to brighten up was once when he got a
letter from Jeanie. He took it away into the bush and stayed hours and
hours.</p>
<p>From never thinking about anything or caring what came uppermost, he seemed
to have changed all on the other tack and do nothing but think. I'd seen a chap
in Berrima something like him for a month or two; one day he manned the
barber's razor and cut his throat. I began to be afraid Jim would go off his
head and blow his brains out with his own revolver. Starlight himself got to be
cranky and restless-like too. One night he broke out as we were standing
smoking under a tree, a mile or so from the cave&mdash;</p>
<p>'By all the devils, Dick, I can't stand this sort of thing much longer. We
shall go mad or drink ourselves to death'&mdash;(we'd all been pretty well 'on'
the night before)&mdash;'if we stick here till we're trapped or smoked out like
a 'guana out of a tree spout. We must make a rise somehow, and try for blue
water again. I've been fighting against the notion the whole time we've been
here, but the devil and your old dad (who's a near relative, I believe) have
been too strong for us. Of course, you know what it's bound to be?'</p>
<p>'I suppose so. I know when dad was away last week he saw that beggar and
some of his mates. They partly made it up awhile back, but didn't fancy doing
it altogether by themselves. They've been waiting on the chance of our standing
in and your taking command.'</p>
<p>'Of course, the old story,' he says, throwing his cigar away, and giving a
half laugh&mdash;such a laugh it was, too. 'Captain Starlight again, I suppose.
The paltry vanity of leadership, and of being in the front of my fellow-men,
has been the ruin of me ever since I could recollect. If my people had let me
go into the army, as I begged and prayed of them to do, it might have been all
the other way. I recollect that day and hour when my old governor refused my
boyish petition, laughed at me&mdash;sneered at me. I took the wrong road then.
I swear to you, Dick, I never had thought of evil till that cursed day which
made me reckless and indifferent to everything. And this is the end&mdash;a
wasted life, a felon's doom! Quite melodramatic, isn't it, Richard? Well, we'll
play out the last act with spirit. "Enter first robber," and so on.
Good-night.'</p>
<p>He walked away. I never heard him say so much about himself before. It set
me thinking of what luck and chance there seemed to be in this world. How men
were not let do what they knew was best for 'em&mdash;often and often&mdash;but
something seemed to drive 'em farther and farther along the wrong road, like a
lot of stray wild cattle that wants to make back to their own run, and a dog
here, a fence the other way. A man on foot or a flock of sheep always keeps
frightening 'em farther and farther from the old beat till they get back into a
bit of back country or mallee scrub and stop there for good. Cattle and horses
and men and women are awful like one another in their ways, and the more you
watch 'em the more it strikes you.</p>
<p>Another day or two idling and card-playing, another headache after too much
grog at night, brought us to a regular go in about business, and then we fixed
it for good.</p>
<p>We were to stick up the next monthly gold escort. That was all. We knew it
would be a heavy one and trusted to our luck to get clear off with the gold,
and then take a ship for Honolulu or San Francisco. A desperate chance; but we
were desperate men. We had tried to work hard and honest. We had done so for
best part of a year. No one could say we had taken the value of a halfpenny
from any man. And yet we were not let stay right when we asked for nothing but
to be let alone and live out the rest of our lives like men.</p>
<p>They wouldn't have us that way, and now they must take us across the grain,
and see what they would gain by that. So it happened we went out one day with
Warrigal to show us the way, and after riding for hours and hours, we came to a
thick scrub. We rode through it till we came to an old cattle track. We
followed that till we came to a tumble-down slab hut with a stockyard beside
it. The yard had been mended, and the rails were up. Seven or eight horses were
inside, all in good condition. As many men were sitting or standing about
smoking outside the old hut.</p>
<p>When we rode up they all came forward and we had it out. We knew who was
coming, and were ready for 'em. There was Moran, of course, quiet and
savage-looking, just as like a black snake as ever twisting about with his
deadly glittering eyes, wanting to bite some one. There was Daly and Burke,
Wall and Hulbert, and two or three more&mdash;I won't say who they were
now&mdash;and if you please who should come out of the hut last but Master
Billy the Boy, as impudent as you like, with a pipe in his mouth, and a
revolver in his belt, trying to copy Moran and Daly. I felt sorry when I see
him, and thought what he'd gradually come to bit by bit, and where he'd most
likely end, all along of the first money he had from father for telegraphing.
But after all I've a notion that men and women grow up as they are intended to
from the beginning. All the same as a tree from seed. You may twist it this
road or that, make it a bit bigger or smaller according to the soil or the way
it's pruned and cut down when it's young, but you won't alter the nature of
that tree or the fruit that it bears. You won't turn a five-corner into a
quince, or a geebung into an orange, twist and twine, and dig and water as you
like. So whichever way Billy the Boy had been broken and named he'd have bolted
and run off the course. Take a pet dingo now. He might look very tame, and
follow them that feed him, and stand the chain; but as soon as anything passed
close that he could kill, he'd have his teeth into it and be lapping its blood
before you could say knife, and the older he got the worse he'd be.</p>
<p>'Well, Dick,' says this young limb of Satan, 'so you've took to the Queen's
highway agin, as the chap says in the play. I thought you and Jim was a-going
to jine the Methodies or the Sons of Temperance at Turon, you both got to look
so thunderin' square on it. Poor old Jim looks dreadful down in the mouth,
don't he, though?'</p>
<p>'It would be all the better for you if you'd joined some other body, you
young scamp,' I said. 'Who told you to come here? I've half a mind to belt you
home again to your mother;' and I walked towards him.</p>
<p>'No, you won't, Dick Marston, don't you make any mistake,' says the young
bull-pup, looking nasty. 'I'm as good a man as you, with this little tool.'
Here he pulled out his revolver. 'I've as much right to turn out as you have.
What odds is it to you what I do?'</p>
<p>I looked rather foolish at this, and Moran and Burke began to laugh.</p>
<p>'You'd better set up a night-school, Dick,' says Burke, 'and get Billy and
some of the other flash kiddies to come. They might turn over a new leaf in
time.'</p>
<p>'If you'll stand up, or Moran there, that's grinning behind you, I'll make
some of ye laugh on the wrong side,' I said.</p>
<p>'Come on,' drawls Moran, taking off his coat, and walking up; 'I'd like to
have a smack at you before you go into the Church.'</p>
<p>We should have been at it hammer and tongs&mdash;we both hated one another
like poison&mdash;only the others interfered, and Billy said we ought to be
ashamed of ourselves for quarrelling like schoolboys. We were nice sort of
chaps to stick up a gold escort. That made a laugh, and we knocked off.</p>
<p>Well, it looked as if no one wanted to speak. Then Hulbert, a very quiet
chap, says, 'I believe Ben Marston's the oldest man here; let's hear what he's
got to say.'</p>
<p>Father gets up at once, and looks steady at the rest of 'em, takes his pipe
out of his mouth, and shakes the baccy out. Then he says&mdash;</p>
<p>'All on ye knows without my telling what we've come here about, and what
there's hangin' to it. It's good enough if it's done to rights; but make no
mistake, boys, it's a battle as must be fought game, and right back to the
ropes, or not at all. If there's a bird here that won't stand the steel he'd
better be put in a bag and took home again.'</p>
<p>'Never mind about the steel, daddy,' says one of the new men. 'We're all
good for a flutter when the wager's good. What'll it be worth a man, and where
are we going to divide? We know your mob's got some crib up in the mountains
that no one knows about. We don't want the swag took there and planted. It
mightn't be found easy.'</p>
<p>'Did ever a one of ye heer tell o' me actin' crooked?' says father. 'Look
here, Bill, I'm not as young as I was, but you stand up to me for three rounds
and I'll take some of the cheek out of yer.'</p>
<p>Bill laughed.</p>
<p>'No fear, daddy, I'd sooner face Dick or Jim. But I only want what's fair
between man and man. It's a big touch, you know, and we can't take it to the
bank to divide, like diggers, or summons yer either.'</p>
<p>'What's the good of growlin' and snappin'?' says Burke. 'We're all goin' in
regular, I suppose, share and share alike?' The men nodded. 'Well, there's only
one way to make things shipshape, and that's to have a captain. We'll pick one
of ourselves, and whatever he says we'll bind ourselves to do&mdash;life or
death. Is that it, boys?'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes, that's the only way,' came from all hands.</p>
<p>'Now, the next thing to work is who we're to make captain of. There's one
here as we can all depend on, who knows more about road-work than all the rest
of us put together. You know who I mean; but I don't want ye to choose him or
any man because I tell you. I propose Starlight for captain if he'll take it,
and them that don't believe me let 'em find a better man if they can.'</p>
<p>'I vote for Dan Moran,' says another man, a youngish farmer-looking chap.
'He's a bushman, like ourselves, and not a half-bred swell, that's just as
likely to clear out when we want him most as do anything else.'</p>
<p>'You go back to the Springs and feed them pigs, Johnny,' says father,
walking towards the young chap. 'That's about what <i>you're</i> bred for;
nobody'll take you for a swell, quarter-bred, or anything else. Howsoever,
let's draw lots for it. Every man put his fancy down on a bit of paper, and put
'em into my old hat here.'</p>
<p>This was done after a bit, and the end of it was ten votes for Starlight and
two or three for Moran, who looked savage and sulkier than ever.</p>
<p>When this was over Starlight walked over from where he was standing, near me
and Jim, and faced the crowd. He drew himself up a bit, and looked round as
haughty as he used to do when he walked up the big room at the Prospectors'
Arms in Turon&mdash;as if all the rest of us was dirt under his feet.</p>
<p>'Well, my lads,' he said, 'you've done me the great honour to elect me to be
your captain. I'm willing to act, or I shouldn't be here. If you're fools
enough to risk your lives and liberties for a thousand ounces of gold a man,
I'm fool enough to show you the way.'</p>
<p>'Hurrah!' said half-a-dozen of them, flinging up their hats. 'We're on,
Captain. Starlight for ever! You ride ahead and we'll back up.'</p>
<p>'That will do,' he says, holding up his hand as if to stop a lot of dogs
barking; 'but listen to me.' Here he spoke a few words in that other voice of
his that always sounded to me and Jim as if it was a different man talking, or
the devil in his likeness. 'Now mind this before we go: you don't quite know
me; you will by and by, perhaps. When I take command of this gang, for this bit
of work or any other, my word's law&mdash;do you hear? And if any man disputes
it or disobeys my orders, by &mdash;&mdash;, I'll shoot him like a dog.'</p>
<p>As he stood there looking down on the lot of 'em, as if he was their king,
with his eyes burning up at last with that slow fire that lay at the bottom of
'em, and only showed out sometimes, I couldn't help thinking of a pirate crew
that I'd read of when I was a boy, and the way the pirate captain ruled
'em.</p>
<h2>Chapter 34</h2>
<p>We were desperate fidgety and anxious till the day came. While we were
getting ready two or three things went wrong, of course. Jim got a letter from
Jeanie, all the way from Melbourne, where she'd gone. It seems she'd got her
money from the bank&mdash;Jim's share of the gold&mdash;all right. She was a
saving, careful little woman, and she told him she'd enough to keep them both
well for four or five years, anyhow. What she wanted him to do was to promise
that he'd never be mixed up in any more dishonest work, and to come away down
to her at once.</p>
<p>'It was the easiest thing in the world,' she said, 'to get away from
Melbourne to England or America. Ships were going every day, and glad to take
any man that was strong and willing to work his passage for nothing; they'd pay
him besides.'</p>
<p>She'd met one or two friends down there as would do anything to help her and
him. If he would only get down to Melbourne all would yet be well; but she
begged and prayed him, if he loved her, and for the sake of the life she hoped
to live with him yet, to come away from his companions and take his own
Jeanie's advice, and try and do nothing wrong for the future.</p>
<p>If Jim had got his letter before we made up matters, just at the last he'd
have chucked up the sponge and cleared out for good and all. He as good as said
so; but he was one of them kind of men that once he'd made a start never turned
back. There'd been some chaff, to make things worse, between Moran and Daly and
some of the other fellows about being game and what not, specially after what
father said at the hut, so he wouldn't draw out of it now.</p>
<p>I could see it fretted him worse than anything since we came back, but he
filled himself up with the idea that we'd be sure to get the gold all right,
and clear out different ways to the coast, and then we'd have something worth
while leaving off with. Another thing, we'd been all used to having what money
we wanted lately, and we none of us fancied living like poor men again in
America or anywhere else. We hadn't had hardly a scrap from Aileen since we'd
come back this last time. It wasn't much odds. She was regular broken-hearted;
you could see it in every line.</p>
<p>'She had been foolish enough to hope for better things,' she said; 'now she
expected nothing more in this world, and was contented to wear out her
miserable life the best way she could. If it wasn't that her religion told her
it was wrong, and that mother depended on her, she'd drown herself in the creek
before the door. She couldn't think why some people were brought into this
miserable world at all. Our family had been marked out to evil, and the same
fate would follow us to the end. She was sorry for Jim, and believed if he had
been let take his own road that he would have been happy and prosperous to-day.
It was a pity he could not have got away safely to Melbourne with his wife
before that wicked woman, who deserved to be burnt alive, ruined everything.
Even now we might all escape, the country seemed in so much confusion with all
the strangers and bad people' (bad people&mdash;well, every one thinks their
own crow the blackest) 'that the goldfields had brought into it, that it
wouldn't be hard to get away in a ship somehow. If nothing else bad turned up
perhaps it might come to pass yet.'</p>
<p>This was the only writing we'd had from poor Aileen. It began all misery and
bitterness, but got a little better at the end. If she and Gracey could have
got hold of Kate Morrison there wouldn't have been much left of her in a
quarter of an hour, I could see that.</p>
<p>Inside was a little bit of paper with one line, 'For my sake,' that was all.
I knew the writing; there was no more. I could see what Gracey meant, and
wished over and over again that I had the chance of going straight, as I'd
wished a thousand times before, but it was too late, too late! When the coach
is running down hill and the break's off, it's no use trying to turn. We had
all our plan laid out and settled to the smallest thing. We were to meet near
Eugowra Rocks a good hour or two before the escort passed, so as to have
everything ready. I remember the day as well as if it was yesterday. We were
all in great buckle and very fit, certainly. I don't think I ever felt better
in my life. There must be something out-and-out spiriting in a real battle when
a bit of a scrimmage like this sent our blood boiling through our veins; made
us feel as if we weren't plain Dick and Jim Marston, but regular grand fellows,
in a manner of speaking. What fools men are when they're young&mdash;and
sometimes after that itself&mdash;to be sure.</p>
<p>We started at daylight, and only stopped once on the road for a bite for
ourselves and to water the horses, so that we were in good time. We brought a
little corn with us, just to give the horses something; they'd be tied up for
hours and hours when we got to the place pitched on. They were all there before
us; they hadn't as good horses by a long chalk as we had, and two of their
packers were poor enough. Jim and I were riding ahead with Starlight a little
on the right of us. When the fellows saw Rainbow they all came crowding round
him as if he'd been a show.</p>
<p>'By George!' says Burke, 'that's a horse worth calling a horse, Captain. I
often heard tell of him, but never set eyes on him before. I've two minds to
shake him and leave you my horse and a share of the gold to boot. I never saw
his equal in my life, and I've seen some plums too.'</p>
<p>'Honour among&mdash;well&mdash;bush-rangers, eh, Burke?' says Starlight
cheerily. 'He's the right sort, isn't he? We shall want good goers to-night.
Are we all here now? We'd better get to business.'</p>
<p>Yes, they were all there, a lot of well-built, upstanding chaps, young and
strong, and fit to do anything that a man could do in the way of work or play.
It was a shame to see them there (and us too, for the matter of that), but
there was no get away now. There will be fools and rogues to the end of the
world, I expect. Even Moran looked a bit brighter than he did last time. He was
one of those chaps that a bit of real danger smartens up. As for Burke, Daly,
and Hulbert, they were like a lot of schoolboys, so full of their fun and
larks.</p>
<p>Starlight just spoke a word to them all; he didn't talk much, but looked
hard and stern about the face, as a captain ought to do. He rode up to the gap
and saw where the trees had been cut down to block up the road. It would be
hard work getting the coach through there now&mdash;for a bit to come.</p>
<p>After that our horses and the two packers were left behind with Warrigal and
father, close enough for hearing, but well out of the way for seeing; it was
behind a thick belt of timber. They tied up some to trees and short-hobbled
others, keeping them all so as to be ready at a moment's notice. Our men hid
themselves behind rocks and stumps on the high side of the road so as they
could see well, and had all the shadow on their side. Wall and Hulbert and
their lot had their mob of horses, packers, and all planted away, and two young
fellows belonging to their crowd minding them.</p>
<p>We'd been ready a good bit when a cove comes tearing up full bat. We were
watching to see how he shaped, and whether he looked likely to lay on the
police, when I saw it was Billy the Boy.</p>
<p>'Now I call this something like,' says he, pulling up short: 'army in
readiness, the enemy not far off. My word, it is a fine thing to turn out,
ain't it, Dick? Do you chaps feel shaky at all? Ain't yer gallied the least
little bit? They're a-comin'!'</p>
<p>'How long will they be?' Starlight said. 'Just remember that you're not
skylarking at a pound-yard, my boy.'</p>
<p>'All right, Captain,' he answered, quiet enough. 'I started on ahead the
moment I saw 'em leave the camp. They're safe to be here in ten minutes now.
You can see 'em when they come into the flat. I'll clear out to the back for a
bit. I want 'em to think I come up permiskus-like when it's over.' So the young
rascal galloped away till the trees hid him, and in a quarter of an hour more
we saw the leaders of the four-horse drag that carried the escort gold turn
round on the forest road and show out into the flat.</p>
<p>It gave me a queer feeling just at first. We hadn't been used to firing on
the Queen's servants, not in cold blood, anyhow, but it was them or us for it
now. There was no time to think about it. They came along at a steady trot up
the hill. We knew the Turon sergeant of police that drove, a tall man with a
big black beard down to his chest. He had been in an English dragoon regiment,
and could handle the ribbons above a bit. He had a trooper alongside him on the
box with his rifle between his knees. Two more were in the body of the drag.
They had put their rifles down and were talking and laughing, not expecting
anything sudden. Two more of the mounted men rode in front, but not far. The
couple behind were a good way off. All of a sudden the men in front came on the
trees lying across the road. They pulled up short, and one of them jumped down
and looked to see if anything could be done to move them. The other man held
his horse. The coach drove up close, so that they were bunched up pretty well
together.</p>
<p>'Who the devil has been doing that?' sung out the sergeant. 'Just as if the
road isn't bad enough without these infernal lazy scoundrels of bullock-drivers
cutting down trees to make us go round. It's a beastly track here at the best
of times.'</p>
<p>'I believe them trees have been fallen on purpose,' says the trooper that
was down. 'There's been men, and horses too, about here to-day, by the tracks.
They're up to no good!'</p>
<p>'Fire!'</p>
<p>The order was given in Starlight's clear, bold voice. Just like a horn it
sounded. You might have heard it twice as far off. A dozen shots followed the
next second, making as much row as fifty because of the way the sound echoed
among the rocks.</p>
<p>I never saw a bigger surprise in my life, and wasn't likely to do, as this
was my first regular battle. We had plenty of time to take aim, and just at
first it looked as if the whole blessed lot of the police was killed and
wounded.</p>
<p>The sergeant threw up his arms and fell off the box like a log, just under
the horses' feet. One of the troopers on ahead dropped, he that was holding the
horses, and both horses started off at full gallop. The two men in the body of
the drag were both hit&mdash;one badly. So when the two troopers came up full
gallop from the back they found us cutting the traces of the team, that was all
plunging like mad, and letting the horses go.</p>
<p>We opened fire at them directly they showed themselves; of course they
couldn't do much in the face of a dozen men, all well armed and behind good
cover. They kept it up for a bit till one of their horses was hit, and then
made tracks for Turon to report that the escort had been stuck up by twenty or
thirty men at Eugowra Rocks&mdash;the others had come up with the pack-horses
by this time, along with Master Billy the Boy firing his revolver and shouting
enough for half-a-dozen; so we looked a big crowd&mdash;that all the men were
shot dead, wounded, or taken prisoners, and that a strong force had better be
despatched at once to recapture the gold.</p>
<p>A good deal of this was true, though not all. The only man killed was the
sergeant. He was shot clean through the heart, and never stirred again. Of the
five other men, three were badly wounded and two slightly. We attended to them
as well as we could, and tied the others so that they would not be able to give
any bother for an hour or two at any rate.</p>
<p>Then the trouble began about dividing the gold. We opened the sort of locker
there was in the centre of the coach and took out the square boxes of gold.
They held canvas bags, all labelled and weighed to the grain, of about 1000 oz.
each. There were fourteen boxes in all. Not a bad haul.</p>
<p>Some of the others couldn't read or write, and they wouldn't trust us, so
they brought their friend with them, who was an educated man sure enough. We
were a bit stunned to see him, holding the sort of position he did at the
Turon. But there he was, and he did his work well enough. He brought a pair of
scales with him and weighed the lot, and portioned it all out amongst us just
the same as Mr. Scott, the banker, used to do for us at the Turon when we
brought in our month's washing-up. We had 5000 oz. Starlight had an extra share
on account of being captain, and the rest had somewhere about 8000 oz. or 9000
oz. among them. It wasn't so bad.</p>
<p>Dad wasn't long before he had our lot safely packed and on his two
pack-horses. Warrigal and he cleared out at a trot, and went out of sight in a
jiffy. It was every man for himself now. We waited a bit to help them with
their swag; it was awful heavy. We told them that their pack-horses would never
carry it if there was anything of a close run for it.</p>
<p>'Suppose you think you've got the only good horse in the country, Dick
Marston,' says Daly. 'We'll find a horse to run anything you've got, barrin'
Rainbow. I've got a little roan horse here as shall run ever a horse ye own,
for three mile, for a hundred notes, with twelve stone up. What do you think of
that, now?'</p>
<p>'Don't take your shirt off, Patsey,' I said. 'I know the roan's as good as
ever was foaled' (so he was; the police got him after Patsey was done for, and
kept him till he died of old age), 'but he's in no condition. I'm talking of
the pack-horses; they're not up to much, as you'll find out.'</p>
<p>We didn't want to rush off at once, for fear the other fellows might say
something afterwards if anything happened cross. So we saw them make a fair
start for a spot on Weddin Mountain, where they thought they were right. We
didn't think we could be caught once we made tracks in earnest. After a couple
or three hours' riding we should be pretty safe, and daylight would see us at
the Hollow.</p>
<p>We stopped, besides, to do what we could for the wounded men. They were none
of them regularly done for, except the sergeant. One man was shot through the
lungs, and was breathing out blood every now and then. We gave them some brandy
and water, and covered them all up and left them as comfortable as we could.
Besides that, we sent Billy the Boy, who couldn't be recognised, to the camp to
have a doctor sent as soon as possible. Then we cleared and started off, not
the way we had to go, but so as we could turn into it.</p>
<p>We couldn't ride very slow after such a turn as that, so we made the pace
pretty hot for the first twenty miles or so. By Jove! it was a great ride; the
forest was middling open, and we went three parts speed when we could see
before us. The horses seemed to go as if they knew there was something up. I
can see Rainbow now, swinging along with that beautiful bounding style of going
he had, snorting now and then and sending out his legs as if one hundred miles,
more or less, was nothing. His head up, his eye shining like a star, his
nostrils open, and every now and then, if anything got up, he'd give a snort as
if he'd just come up out of the bush. They'd had a longish day and a fast ride
before they got to Eugowra, just enough to eat to keep them from starving, with
a drink of water. Now they were going the same style back, and they'd never had
the saddles off their backs. All the night through we rode before we got to the
top of Nulla Mountain; very glad to see it we were then. We took it easy for a
few miles now and again, then we'd push on again. We felt awful sleepy at
times; we'd been up and at it since the morning before; long before daylight,
too. The strangeness and the chance of being followed kept us up, else I
believe we'd have dropped off our horses' backs, regular dead beat.</p>
<p>We lost ground now and then through Warrigal not being there to guide us,
but Jim took the lead and he wasn't far out; besides, the horses knew which way
to steer for their grass at the Hollow. They wouldn't let us go much off the
line if it was ever so dark. We gave 'em their heads mostly. The sun was just
rising as we rode across the last tableland. We got off and stumbled along,
horses and men, down the track to the Hollow. Dad and Warrigal hadn't come
back; of course they couldn't stand the pace we did. They'd have to camp for a
bit, but they both knew of plants and hiding holes, where all the police in the
colony couldn't find them. We knew they'd turn up some time next day. So we let
go our horses, and after a bit of supper laid down and slept till well on in
the afternoon.</p>
<p>When I looked round I saw the dog sleeping at Jim's feet, old Crib. He never
left father very far, so of course the old man must be home, or pretty close
up. I was that dead beat and tired out that I turned over and went to sleep for
another couple of hours. When I next woke up I was right and felt rested, so I
put on my things, had a good wash, and went out to speak to father. He was
sitting by the fire outside smoking, just as if he'd never been away.</p>
<h2>Chapter 35</h2>
<p>'We done that job to rights if we never done another, eh, lad?' says father,
reaching out for a coal to put in his pipe.</p>
<p>'Seems like it,' I said. 'There'll be a deuce of a bobbery about it. We
shan't be able to move for a bit, let alone clear out.'</p>
<p>'We'll show 'em a trick or two yet,' says dad. I could see he'd had a tot,
early as it was. 'I wonder how them chaps got on? But we'll hear soon.'</p>
<p>'How shall we hear anything? Nobody'll be mad enough to show out of here for
a bit.'</p>
<p>'I could get word here,' says father, 'if there was a police barrack on the
top of Nulla Mountain. I've done it afore, and I can do it again.'</p>
<p>'Well, I hope it won't be long, for I'm pretty full up of this
staying-at-home business in the Hollow. It's well enough for a bit, but it's
awful slow when you've too much of it.'</p>
<p>'It wouldn't be very slow if we was all grabbed and tried for our lives, Mr.
Dick Marston. Would ye like that better for a change?' says the old man,
showing his teeth like a dog that's making up his mind to have ye and don't see
where he's to get first bite. 'You leave the thing to them as knows more than
you do, or you'll find yourself took in, and that precious sharp.'</p>
<p>'You'll find your pals, Burke and Moran, and their lot will have their turn
first,' I said, and with that I walked off, for I saw the old man had been
drinking a bit after his night's work, and that always started his temper the
wrong way. There was no doing anything with him then, as I knew by long
experience. I was going to ask him where he'd put the gold, but thought it best
to leave that for some other time.</p>
<p>By and by, when we all turned out and had some breakfast, we took a bit of a
walk by ourselves and talked it over. We could hardly think it was all done and
over.</p>
<p>'The gold escort stuck up. Fourteen thousand ounces of gold taken. Sergeant
Hawkins shot dead. The robbers safe off with their booty.'</p>
<p>This is the sort of thing that we were sure to see in all the papers. It
would make a row and no mistake. It was the first time such a thing had been
thought of, much less carried out 'to rights', as father said, 'in any of the
colonies.' We had the five thousand ounces of gold, safe enough, too. That was
something; whether we should be let enjoy it, or what chance we had of getting
right away out of the country, was quite another matter. We were all sorry for
Sergeant Hawkins, and would have been better pleased if he'd been only wounded
like the others. But these sorts of things couldn't be helped. It was the
fortune of war; his luck this time, ours next. We knew what we had to expect.
Nothing would make much difference. 'As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.' We
were up to our necks in it now, and must fight our way out the best way we
could.</p>
<p>Bar any man betraying the secret of the Hollow we might be safe for years to
come, as long as we were not shot or taken in fair fight. And who was to let
out the secret? No one but ourselves had the least notion of the track or where
it led to, or of such a place as the Hollow being in the colony. Only us five
were in possession of the secret. We never let any of these other men come
near, much less to it. We took good care never to meet them within twenty miles
of it. Father was a man that, even when he was drunk, never let out what he
didn't want other people to know. Jim and I and Starlight were not likely to
blab, and Warrigal would have had his throat cut sooner than let on about
anything that might be against Starlight, or that he told him not to do.</p>
<p>We had good reason, then, to think ourselves safe as long as we had such a
place to make for whenever we were in danger or had done a stroke. We had
enough in gold and cash to keep us comfortable in any other
country&mdash;provided we could only get there. That was the rub. When we'd got
a glass or two in our heads we thought it was easy enough to get across
country, or to make away one by one at shearing time, disguised as swagsmen, to
the coast. But when we thought it over carefully in the mornings, particularly
when we were a bit nervous after the grog had died out of us, it seemed a
rather blue look-out.</p>
<p>There was the whole countryside pretty thick with police stations, where
every man, from the sergeant to the last-joined recruit, knew the height, size,
colour of hair, and so on of every one of us. If a suspicious-looking man was
seen or heard of within miles the telegraph wires could be set to work. He
could be met, stopped, searched, and overhauled. What chance would any of us
have then?</p>
<p>'Don't flatter yourselves, my boy,' Starlight said, when we'd got the length
of thinking how it was to be done, 'that there's any little bit of a chance,
for a year or two at any rate, of getting away. Not a kangaroo rat could hop
across from one scrub to another if there was the least suspicion upon him
without being blocked or run into. Jim, old man, I'm sorry for you, but my
belief is we're quartered here for a year or two certain, and the sooner we
make up our minds to it the better.'</p>
<p>Here poor old Jim groaned. 'Don't you think,' he said, quite timid-like,
'that about shearing-time a man might take his chance, leading an old horse
with a swag on, as if he wanted to get shearing in some of the big
down-the-river sheds?'</p>
<p>'Not a bit of it,' says Starlight. 'You're such a good-looking, upstanding
chap that you're safe to be pulled up and made answer for yourself before you'd
get fifty miles. If you rode a good horse they'd think you were too
smart-looking for a regular shearer, and nail you at once.'</p>
<p>'But I'd take an old screw with a big leg,' pleaded Jim. 'Haven't I often
seen a cove walking and leading one just to carry his blankets and things?'</p>
<p>'Then they'd know a chap like you, full of work and a native to boot, ought
to have a better turn-out&mdash;if it wasn't a stall. So they'd have you for
that.'</p>
<p>'But there's Isaac Lawson and Campbelltown. You've seen them. Isaac's an
inch taller than me, and the same cut and make. Why shouldn't they shop them
when they're going shearing? They're square enough, and always was. And
Campbelltown's a good deal like Dick, beard and all.'</p>
<p>'Well, I'll bet you a new meerschaum that both men are arrested on suspicion
before shearing. Of course they'll let them go again; but, you mark my words,
they'll be stopped, as well as dozens of others. That will show how close the
search will be.'</p>
<p>'I don't care,' says Jim, in his old, obstinate way, which he never put on
except very seldom. 'I'll go in a month or two&mdash;police or no police. I'll
make for Melbourne if there was an army of soldiers between me and Jeanie.'</p>
<p>We had to settle where the gold was to be hid. After a lot of talk we agreed
to keep one bag in a hole in the side of the wall of the cave, and bury the
others in the place where we'd found old Mr. Devereux's box. His treasure had
laid many a year safe and sound without anybody touching it, and we thought
ours might do the same. Besides, to find it they must get into the Hollow
first. So we packed it out bag by bag, and made an ironbark coffin for it, and
buried it away there, and put some couch-grass turfs on it. We knew they'd soon
grow up, and nobody could tell that it hadn't always been covered up the same
as the rest of the old garden.</p>
<p>It felt pretty hard lines to think we shouldn't be able to get away from
this lonely place after the life we'd led the last year; but Starlight wasn't
often wrong, and we came to the same way of thinking ourselves when we looked
at it all round, steady and quiet like.</p>
<p>We'd been a week or ten days all by ourselves, horse-breaking, fishing, and
shooting a bit, thinking how strange it was that we should have more than
&pound;20,000 in gold and money and not be able to do anything with it, when
dad, sudden like, said he'd go out himself and get some of the newspapers, and
perhaps a letter or two if any came.</p>
<p>Starlight laughed at him a bit for being foolhardy, and said we should hear
of his being caught and committed for trial. 'Why, they'll know the dog,' says
he, 'and make him give evidence in court. I've known that done before now.
Inspector Merlin nailed a chap through his dog.'</p>
<p>Father grinned. 'I know'd that case&mdash;a sheep-stealing one. They wanted
to make out Brummy was the man as owned the dorg&mdash;a remarkable dorg he
was, too, and had been seen driving the sheep.'</p>
<p>'Well, what did the dog do? Identify the prisoner, didn't he?'</p>
<p>'Well, the dashed fool of a coolie did. Jumps up as soon as he was brought
into court, and whines and scratches at the dock rails and barks, and goes on
tremenjus, trying to get at Brummy.'</p>
<p>'How did his master like it?'</p>
<p>'Oh! Brummy? He looked as black as the ace of spades. He'd have made it hot
for that dorg if he could ha' got at him. But I suppose he forgived him when he
came out.'</p>
<p>'Why should he?'</p>
<p>'Because the jury fetched him in guilty without leaving the box, and the
judge give him seven years. You wouldn't find this old varmint a-doin' no such
foolishness as that.'</p>
<p>Here he looks at Crib, as was lyin' down a good way off, and not letting on
to know anything. He saw father's old mare brought up, though, and saddled, and
knowed quite well what that meant. He never rode her unless he was going out of
the Hollow.</p>
<p>'I believe that dog could stick up a man himself as well as some fellows we
know,' says Starlight, 'and he'd do it, too, if your father gave him the
word.'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>While we were taking it easy, and except for the loneliness of it as safe as
if we had been out of the country altogether, Moran and the other fellows
hadn't quite such a good time of it. They were hunted from pillar to post by
the police, who were mad to do something to meet the chaff that was always
being cast up to them of having a lot of bush-rangers robbing and shooting all
over the country and not being able to take them. There were some
out-of-the-way places enough in the Weddin Mountains, but none like the Hollow,
where they could lie quiet and untroubled for weeks together, if they wanted.
Besides, they had lost their gold by their own foolishness in not having better
pack-horses, and hadn't much to carry on with, and it's not a life that can be
worked on the cheap, I can tell you, as we often found out. Money comes easy in
our line, but it goes faster still, and a man must never be short of a pound or
two to chuck about if he wants to keep his information fresh, and to have
people working for him night and day with a will.</p>
<p>So they had some every-day sort of work cut out to keep themselves going,
and it took them all their time to get from one part of the country where they
were known to some other place where they weren't expected. Having out-and-out
good hacks, and being all of them chaps that had been born in the bush and knew
it like a book, it was wonderful how they managed to rob people at one place
one day, and then be at some place a hundred miles off the next. Ever so many
times they came off, and they'd call one another Starlight and Marston, and so
on, till the people got regularly dumbfoundered, and couldn't tell which of the
gang it was that seemed to be all over the country, and in two places at the
same time. We used to laugh ourselves sometimes, when we'd hear tell that all
the travellers passing Big Hill on a certain day were 'stuck up by Wall's gang
and robbed.' Every man Jack that came along for hours was made to stand behind
a clump of trees with two of the gang guarding them, so as the others couldn't
see them as they came up. They all had to deliver up what they'd got about 'em,
and no one was allowed to stir till sundown, for fear they should send word to
the police. Then the gang went off, telling them to stay where they were for an
hour or else they'd come back and shoot them.</p>
<p>This would be on the western road, perhaps. Next day a station on the
southern road, a hundred and twenty miles off, would be robbed by the same lot.
Money and valuables taken away, and three or four of the best horses. Their own
they'd leave behind in such a state that any one could see how far and fast
they'd been ridden.</p>
<p>They often got stood to, when they were hard up for a mount, and it was this
way. The squatters weren't alike, by any manner of means, in their way of
dealing with them. Many of them had lots of fine riding-horses in their
paddocks. These would be yarded some fine night, the best taken and ridden
hard, perhaps returned next morning, perhaps in a day or two.</p>
<p>It was pretty well known who had used them, but nothing was said; the best
policy, some think, is to hold a candle to the devil, especially when the
devil's camped close handy to your paddock, and might any time sack your house,
burn down your woolshed and stacks, or even shoot at your worshipful self if he
didn't like the way you treated him and his imps.</p>
<p>These careful respectable people didn't show themselves too forward either
in giving help or information to the police. Not by no means. They never
encouraged them to stay when they came about the place, and weren't that over
liberal in feeding their horses, or giving them a hand in any way, that they'd
come again in a hurry. If they were asked about the bush-rangers, or when
they'd been last seen, they were very careful, and said as little as
possible.</p>
<p>No one wonders at people like the Barnes's, or little farmers, or the very
small sort of settlers, people with one flock of sheep or a few cows, doing
this sort of thing; they have a lot to lose and nothing to get if they gain
ill-will. But regular country gentlemen, with big properties, lots of money,
and all the rest of it, they're there to show a good example to the
countryside, whether it paid for the time or whether it didn't; and all us sort
of chaps, on the cross or not, like them all the better for it.</p>
<p>When I say all of us, I don't mean Moran. A sulky, black-hearted, revengeful
brute he always was&mdash;I don't think he'd any manly feeling about him. He
was a half-bred gipsy, they told us that knew where he was reared, and
Starlight said gipsy blood was a queer cross, for devilry and hardness it
couldn't be beat; he didn't wonder a bit at Moran's being the scoundrel he
was.</p>
<p>No doubt he 'had it in' for more than one of the people who helped the
police to chevy Wall and his lot about. From what I knew of him I was sure he'd
do some mischief one of these days, and make all the country ten times as hot
against us as they were now. He had no mercy about him. He'd rather shoot a man
any day than not; and he'd burn a house down just for the pleasure of seeing
how the owner looked when it was lighted.</p>
<p>Starlight used to say he despised men that tried to save themselves
cowardly-like more than he could say, and thought them worse than the
bush-rangers themselves. Some of them were big people, too.</p>
<p>But other country gentlemen, like Mr. Falkland, were quite of a different
pattern. If they all acted like him I don't think we should any of us have
reigned as long as we did. They helped and encouraged the police in every
possible way. They sent them information whenever they had received any worth
while. They lent them horses freely when their own were tired out and beaten.
More than that, when bush-rangers were supposed to be in the neighbourhood they
went out with them themselves, lying out and watching through the long cold
nights, and taking their chance of a shot as well as those that were paid for
it.</p>
<p>Now there was a Mr. Whitman that had never let go a chance from the start of
running their trail with the police, and had more than once given them all they
knew to get away. He was a native of the country, like themselves, a
first-class horseman and tracker, a hardy, game sort of a chap that thought
nothing of being twenty-four hours in the saddle, or sitting under a fence
watching for the whole of a frosty night.</p>
<p>Well, he was pretty close to Moran once, who had been out by himself; that
close he ran him he made him drop his rifle and ride for his life. Moran never
forgave him for this, and one day when they had all been drinking pretty heavy
he managed to persuade Wall, Hulbert, Burke, and Daly to come with him and
stick up Whitman's house.</p>
<p>'I sent word to him I'd pay him out one of these fine days,' he drawled out,
'and he'll find that Dan Moran can keep his word.'</p>
<p>He picked a time when he knew Whitman was away at another station. I always
thought Moran was not so game as he gave himself out to be. And I think if he'd
had Whitman's steady eyes looking at him, and seeing a pistol in his hand, he
wouldn't have shot as straight as he generally did when he was practising at a
gum tree.</p>
<p>Anyhow, they laid it out all right, as they thought, to take the place
unawares. They'd been drinking at a flash kind of inn no great way off, and
when they rode up to the house it seems they were all of 'em three sheets in
the wind, and fit for any kind of villainy that came uppermost. As for Moran,
he was a devil unchained. I know what he was. The people in the house that day
trembled and shook when they heard the dogs bark and saw five strange horsemen
ride through the back gate into the yard.</p>
<p>They'd have trembled a deal more if they'd known what was coming.</p>
<h2>Chapter 36</h2>
<p>When we found that by making darts and playing hide and seek with the police
in this way we could ride about the country more comfortable like, we took
matters easier. Once or twice we tried it on by night, and had a bit of a lark
at Jonathan's, which was a change after having to keep dark so long. We'd rode
up there after dark one night, and made ourselves pretty snug for the evening,
when Bella Barnes asked us if we'd dropped across Moran and his mob that
day.</p>
<p>'No,' says I. 'Didn't know they were about this part. Why, weren't they at
Monckton's the day before yesterday?'</p>
<p>'Ah! but they came back last night, passed the house to-day going towards
Mr. Whitman's, at Darjallook. I don't know, but I expect they're going to play
up a bit there, because of his following them up that time the police nearly
got Moran.'</p>
<p>'What makes you think that? They're only going for what they can get;
perhaps the riding-horses and any loose cash that's knocking about.'</p>
<p>'Billy the Boy was here for a bit,' says Maddie. 'I don't like that young
brat, he'll turn out bad, you take my word for it; but he said Moran knew Mr.
Whitman was away at the Castlereagh station, and was going to make it a warning
to them all.'</p>
<p>'Well, it's too bad,' said Bella; 'there's no one there but Mrs. Whitman and
the young ladies. It's real cowardly, I call it, to frighten a parcel of women.
But that Moran's a brute and hasn't the feelings of a man about him.'</p>
<p>'We must ride over, boys,' says Starlight, yawning and stretching himself.
'I was looking forward to a pleasant evening here, but it seems to me we ought
to have a say in this matter. Whitman's gone a trifle fast, and been hard on
us; but he's a gentleman, and goes straight for what he considers his duty. I
don't blame him. If these fellows are half drunk they'll burn the place down I
shouldn't wonder, and play hell's delight.'</p>
<p>'And Miss Falkland's up there too, staying with the young ladies,' says
Maddie. 'Why, Jim, what's up with you? I thought you wasn't taking notice.'</p>
<p>'Come along, Dick,' says Jim, quite hoarse-like, making one jump to the
door. 'Dash it, man, what's the use of us wasting time jawing here? By
&mdash;&mdash;, if there's a hair of her head touched I'll break Moran's neck,
and shoot the lot of them down like crows.'</p>
<p>'Good-bye, girls,' I said, 'there's no time to lose.'</p>
<p>Starlight made a bow, polite to the last, and passed out. Jim was on his
horse as we got to the stable door. Warrigal fetched Starlight's, and in half a
minute Jim and he were off together along the road full split, and I had as
much as I could do to catch them up within the next mile. It wasn't twenty
miles to Whitman's place, Darjallook, but the road was good, and we did it in
an hour and twenty minutes, or thereabouts. I know Starlight lit a match and
looked at his watch when we got near the front gate.</p>
<p>We could see nothing particular about the house. The lights shone out of the
windows, and we heard the piano going.</p>
<p>'Seems all right,' says Starlight. 'Wonder if they came, after all? They'll
think we want to stick the place up if we ride up to the hall door. Get off and
look out tracks, Warrigal.'</p>
<p>Warrigal dismounted, lit a couple of matches, and put his head down close to
the soft turf, as if he was going to smell it.</p>
<p>'Where track?' says Starlight.</p>
<p>'There!' says Warrigal, pointing to something we couldn't see if we'd looked
for a month. 'Bin gone that way. That one track Moran's horse. I know him; turn
foot in likit cow. Four more track follow up.'</p>
<p>'Why, they're in the house now, the infernal scoundrels,' says Starlight.
'You stay here with the horses, Warrigal; we'll walk up. If you hear shooting,
tie them to the fence and run in.'</p>
<p>We walked up very quiet to the house&mdash;we'd all been there before, and
knew where the front parlour was&mdash;over the lawn and two flower-beds, and
then up to the big bow-window. The others stood under an old white cedar tree
that shadowed all round. I looked in, and, by George! my face burned, cold as
it was. There was Moran lying back in an arm-chair, with a glass of grog in his
hand, takin' it easy and makin' himself quite at home. Burke and Daly were
sitting in two chairs near the table, looking a long way from comfortable; but
they had a couple of bottles of brandy on the table and glasses, and were
filling up. So was Moran. They'd had quite as much as was good for them. The
eldest Miss Whitman was sitting at the piano, playing away tune after tune,
while her eyes were wandering about and her lips trembling, and every now and
then she'd flush up all over her face; then she'd turn as white as a sheet, and
look as if she'd fall off the stool. The youngest daughter was on her knees by
her, on the other side, with her head in her lap. Every now and then I could
hear a sob come from her, but stifled-like, as if she tried to choke it back as
much as she could.</p>
<p>Burke and Daly had their pistols on the table, among the
bottles&mdash;though what they wanted 'em there for I couldn't see&mdash;and
Moran had stuck his on the back of the piano. That showed me he was close up
drunk, for he was a man as never hardly let go of his revolver.</p>
<p>Mrs. Whitman was sitting crouched up in a chair behind her daughter, with a
stony face, looking as if the end of the world was come. I hardly knew her
again. She was a very kind woman, too; many a glass of grog she'd given me at
shearing time, and medicine too, once I was sick there with influenza.</p>
<p>But Miss Falkland; I couldn't keep my eyes off her. She was sitting on the
sofa against the wall, quite upright, with her hands before her, and her eyes
looking half proudly, half miserable, round the room. You couldn't hardly tell
she was frightened except by a kind of twitching of her neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>Presently Moran, who was more than half boozed as it was, and kept on
drinking, calls out to Miss Whitman to sing a song.</p>
<p>'Come, Miss Polly,' says he, 'you can sing away fast enough for your dashed
old father and some o' them swells from Bathurst. By George, you must tune your
pipe a bit this time for Dan Moran.'</p>
<p>The poor girl said she couldn't sing just then, but she'd play as much as he
liked.</p>
<p>'Yer'd better sing now,' he drawls out, 'unless ye want me to come and make
you. I know you girls wants coaxing sometimes.'</p>
<p>Poor Miss Mary breaks out at once into some kind of a song&mdash;the
pitifullest music ever you listened to. Only I wanted to wait a bit, so as to
come in right once for all, I'd have gone at him, hammer and tongs, that very
minute.</p>
<p>All this time Burke and Daly were goin' in steady at the brandy, finished
one bottle and tackled another. They began to get noisy and talked a lot, and
sung a kind of a chorus to Miss Mary's song.</p>
<p>After the song was over, Moran swore he'd have another one. She'd never sing
for him any more, he said, unless she took a fancy to him, and went back to the
Weddin Mountains with them.</p>
<p>'It ain't a bad name for a mountain, is it, miss?' says he, grinning. Then,
fixing his black snake's eyes on her, he poured out about half a tumbler of
brandy and drank it off.</p>
<p>'By gum!' he says, 'I must have a dance; blest if I don't! First chop
music&mdash;good room this&mdash;three gals and the missus&mdash;course we
must. I'm regular shook on the polka. You play us a good 'un, Polly, or
whatever yer name is. Dan Moran's goin' to enjoy himself this night if he never
sees another. Come on, Burke. Patsey, stand up, yer blamed fool. Here goes for
my partner.'</p>
<p>'Come, Moran,' says Burke, 'none of your larks; we're very jolly, and the
young ladies ain't on for a hop; are ye, miss?' and he looked over at the
youngest Miss Whitman, who stared at him for a moment, and then hid her face in
her hands.</p>
<p>'Are you a-goin' to play as I told yer?' says Moran. 'D'ye think yer know
when yer well off?'</p>
<p>The tone of voice he said this in and the look seemed to frighten the poor
girl so that she started an old-style polka there and then, which made him bang
his heels on the floor and spin round as if he'd been at a dance-house. As soon
as he'd done two or three turns he walks over to the sofa and sits down close
to Miss Falkland, and put his arm round her waist.</p>
<p>'Come, Fanny Falkland,' says he, 'or whatever they call yer; you're so
dashed proud yer won't speak to a bush cove at all. You can go home by'n by,
and tell your father that you had a twirl-round with Dan Moran, and helped to
make the evening pass pleasant at Darjallook afore it was burned.'</p>
<p>Anything like the disgust, misery, and rage mixed up that came into Miss
Falkland's face all in a moment and together-like, I never saw. She made no
sound, but her face grew paler and paler; she turned white to the lips, as
trembled and worked in spite of her. She struggled fierce and wild for nigh a
solid minute to clear herself from him, while her beautiful eyes moved about
like I've seen a wild animal's caught in a trap. Then, when she felt her
strength wasn't no account against his, she gave one piercing, terrible scream,
so long and unnatural-like in the tone of it that it curdled my very blood.</p>
<p>I lifted up the window-sash quick, and jumped in; but before I made two
steps Jim sprang past me, and raised his pistol.</p>
<p>'Drop her!' he shouts to Moran; 'you hound! Leave go Miss Falkland, or by
the living God I'll blow your head off, Dan Moran, before you can lift your
hand! How dare you touch her, you cowardly dog!'</p>
<p>Moran was that stunned at seeing us show up so sudden that he was a good bit
took off his guard, cool card as he was in a general way. Besides, he'd left
his revolver on the piano close by the arm-chair, where his grog was. Burke and
Daly were no better off. They found Starlight and Warrigal covering them with
their pistols, so that they'd have been shot down before they could so much as
reach for their tools.</p>
<p>But Jim couldn't wait; and just as Moran was rising on his feet, feeling for
the revolver that wasn't in his belt (and that I never heard of his being
without but that once), he jumps at him like a wallaroo, and, catching him by
the collar and waist-belt, lifts him clean off his feet as if he'd been a
child, and brings him agen the corner of the wall with all his full strength. I
thought his brains was knocked out, dashed if I didn't. I heard Moran's head
sound against the stone wall with a dull sort of thud; and on the floor he
drops like a dead man&mdash;never made a kick. By George! we all thought he had
killed him.</p>
<p>'Stash that, now,' says Burke; 'don't touch him again, Jim Marston. He's got
as much as 'll do him for a bit; and I don't say it don't serve him right. I
don't hold with being rough to women. It ain't manly, and we've got wives and
kids of our own.'</p>
<p>'Then why the devil didn't you stop it?' says Starlight. 'You deserve the
same sauce, you and Daly, for sitting there like a couple of children, and
letting that ruffian torment these helpless ladies. If you fellows go on
sticking up on your own account, and I hear a whisper of your behaving
yourselves like brutes, I'll turn policeman myself for the pleasure of running
you in. Now, mind that, you and Daly too. Where's Wall and Hulbert?'</p>
<p>'They went to yard the horses.'</p>
<p>'That's fair game, and all in the day's work. I don't care what you take or
whom you shoot for that matter, as long as it's all in fair fight; but I'll
have none of this sort of work if I'm to be captain, and you're all sworn to
obey me, mind that. I'll have to shoot a man yet, I see, as I've done before
now, before I can get attended to. That brute's coming to. Lift him up, and
clear out of this place as soon as you can. I'll wait behind.'</p>
<p>They blundered out, taking Moran with them, who seemed quite stupid like,
and staggered as he walked. He wasn't himself for a week after, and longer too,
and threatened a bit, but he soon saw he'd no show, as all the fellows, even to
his own mates, told him he deserved all he got.</p>
<p>Old Jim stood up by the fireplace after that, never stirring nor speaking,
with his eyes fixed on Miss Falkland, who had got back her colour, and though
she panted a bit and looked raised like, she wasn't much different from what
we'd seen her before at the old place. The two Misses Whitman, poor girls, were
standing up with their arms round one another's necks, and the tears running
down their faces like rain. Mrs. Whitman was lying back in her chair with her
hands over her face cryin' to herself quiet and easy, and wringing her
hands.</p>
<p>Then Starlight moved forward and bowed to the ladies as if he was just
coming into a ballroom, like I saw him once at a swell ball they gave for the
hospital at Turon.</p>
<p>'Permit me to apologise, Mrs. Whitman, and to you, my dear young ladies, for
the rudeness of one of my men, whom I unhappily was not able to restrain. I
have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Whitman, and I hope you will express my
regret that I was not in time to save you from the great annoyance to which you
have been subjected.'</p>
<p>'Oh! I shall be grateful all my life to you, and so, I'm sure, will Mr.
Whitman, when he returns; and oh! Sir Ferdinand, if you and these two good
young men, who, I suppose, are policemen in plain clothes, had not come in,
goodness only knows what would have become of us.'</p>
<p>'I am afraid you are labouring under some mistake, my dear madam. I have not
the honour to be Sir Ferdinand Morringer or any other baronet at present; but I
assure you I feel the compliment intensely. I am sure my good friends here,
James and Richard Marston, do equally.'</p>
<p>Here the Misses Whitman, in spite of all their terror and anxiety, were so
tickled by the idea of their mother mistaking Starlight and the Marstons for
Sir Ferdinand and his troopers that they began to laugh, not but what they were
sober enough in another minute.</p>
<p>Miss Falkland got up then and walked forward, looking just the way her
father used to do. She spoke to Starlight first.</p>
<p>'I have never seen you before, but I have often heard of you, Captain
Starlight, if you will allow me to address you by that title. Believe me when I
say that by your conduct to-night you have won our deepest gratitude&mdash;more
than that, our respect and regard. Whatever may be your future career, whatever
the fate that your wild life may end in, always believe there are those who
will think of you, pray for you, rejoice in your escapes, and sorrow sincerely
for your doom. I can answer for myself, and I am sure for my cousins also.'</p>
<p>Here the Misses Whitman said&mdash;</p>
<p>'Yes, indeed, we will&mdash;to our life's end.'</p>
<p>Then she turned to Jim, who still stood there looking at her with his big
gray eyes, that had got ever so much darker lately.</p>
<p>'You, poor old Jim,' she said, and she took hold of his brown hand and held
it in her own, 'I am more sorry than I can tell to hear all I have done about
you and Dick too. This is the second time you have saved me, and I am not the
girl to forget it, if I could only show my gratitude. Is there any way?'</p>
<p>'There's Jeanie,' just them two words he said.</p>
<p>'Your wife? Oh yes, I heard about her,' looking at him so kind and
gentle-like. 'I saw it all in the papers. She's in Melbourne, isn't she? What
is her address?'</p>
<p>'Esplanade Hotel, St. Kilda,' says Jim, taking a small bit of a letter out
of his pocket.</p>
<p>'Very well, Jim, I have a friend who lives near it. She will find her out,
and do all for her that can be done. But why don't you&mdash;why don't all of
you contrive to get away somehow from this hateful life, and not bring ruin and
destruction on the heads of all who love you? Say you will try for their
sake&mdash;for my sake.'</p>
<p>'It's too late, Miss Falkland,' I said. 'We're all thankful to you for the
way you've spoken. Jim and I would be proud to shed our blood for you any time,
or Mr. Falkland either. We'll do what we can, but we'll have to fight it out to
the end now, and take our chance of the bullet coming before the rope.
Good-night, Miss Falkland, and good luck to you always.'</p>
<p>She shook hands heartily with me and Jim, but when she came to Starlight he
raised her hand quite respectful like and just touched it with his lips. Then
he bowed low to them all and walked slowly out.</p>
<p>When we got to the public-house, which wasn't far off, we found that Moran
and the other two had stayed there a bit till Wall and Hulbert came; then they
had a drink all round and rode away. The publican said Moran was in an awful
temper, and he was afraid he'd have shot somebody before the others got him
started and clear of the place.</p>
<p>'It's a mercy you went over, Captain,' says he; 'there'd have been the devil
to pay else. He swore he'd burn the place down before he went from here.'</p>
<p>'He'll get caught one of these fine days,' says Starlight. 'There's more
risk at one station than half-a-dozen road scrimmages, and that he'll find,
clever as he thinks himself.'</p>
<p>'Where's Mr. Whitman, Jack?' says I to the landlord (he wasn't a bad sort,
old Jack Jones). 'What made him leave his place to the mercy of the world, in a
manner of speaking?'</p>
<p>'Well, it was this way. He heard that all the shepherds at the lower station
had cut it to the diggings, ye see; so he thought he'd make a dart up to the
Castlereagh and rig'late the place a bit. He'll be back afore morning.'</p>
<p>'How d'ye know that?'</p>
<p>'Well, he's ridin' that famous roan pony o' his, and he always comes back
from the station in one day, though he takes two to go; eighty-five miles every
yard of it. It's a big day, but that pony's a rum un, and can jump his own
height easy. He'll be welcome home to-night.'</p>
<p>'I daresay he will, and no wonder. The missus must ha' been awful
frightened, and the young ladies too. Good-night, Jack;' and we rattled
off.</p>
<p>It wasn't so very late after all when we got back to Jonathan's; so, as the
horses wanted a bit of a rest and a feed, we roused up the girls and had
supper. A very jolly one it was, my word.</p>
<p>They were full of curiosity, you bet, to know how we got on when they heard
Moran was there and the others. So bit by bit they picked it out of us. When
they heard it all, Maddie got up and threw her arms round Jim's neck.</p>
<p>'I may kiss you now you're married,' she says, 'and I know there's only one
woman in the world for you; but you deserve one from every woman in the country
for smashing that wretch Moran. It's a pity you didn't break his neck. Never
mind, old man; Miss Falkland won't forget you for that, you take my word. I'm
proud of you, that I am.'</p>
<p>Jim just sat there and let her talk to him. He smiled in a serious kind of
way when she ran over to him first; but, instead of a good-looking girl, it
might have been his grandmother for all he seemed to care.</p>
<p>'You're a regular old image, Jim,' says she. 'I hope none of my other
friends 'll get married if it knocks all the go out of them, same as it has
from you. However, you can stand up for a friend, can't you? You wouldn't see
me trod upon; d'ye think you would, now? I'd stand up for you, I know, if you
was bested anywhere.'</p>
<p>'My dear Maddie,' says Starlight, 'James is in that particular stage of
infatuation when a man only sees one woman in the whole world. I envy him, I
assure you. When your day comes you will understand much of what puzzles you at
present.'</p>
<p>'I suppose so,' said Maddie, going back to her seat with a wondering, queer
kind of look. 'But it must be dreadful dull being shut in for weeks and weeks
in one place, perhaps, and with only one man.'</p>
<p>'I have heard it asserted,' he says, 'that a slight flavour of monotony
occasionally assails the honeymoon. Variety is the salt of life, I begin to
think. Some of these fine days, Maddie, we'll both get married and compare
notes.'</p>
<p>'You'll have to look out, then,' says Bella. 'All the girls about here are
getting snapped up quick. There's such a lot of young bankers, Government
officers, and swells of all sorts about the diggings now, not to reckon the
golden-hole men, that we girls have double the pull we had before the gold.
Why, there was my old schoolmate, Clara Mason, was married last week to such a
fine young chap, a surveyor. She'd only known him six weeks.'</p>
<p>'Well, I'll come and dance at your wedding if you'll send me an invite,'
says Starlight.</p>
<p>'Will you, though?' she said. 'Wouldn't it be fun? Unless Sir Ferdinand was
there. He's a great friend of mine, you know.'</p>
<p>'I'll come if his Satanic Majesty himself was present (he occasionally does
attend a wedding, I've heard), and bring you a present, too, Bella; mind, it's
a bargain.'</p>
<p>'There's my hand on it,' says she. 'I wonder how you'll manage it, but I'll
leave that to you. It mightn't be so long either. And now it's time for us all
to go to bed. Jim's asleep, I believe, this half hour.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 37</h2>
<p>This bit of a barney, of course, made bad blood betwixt us and Moran's mob,
so for a spell Starlight and father thought it handier for us to go our own
road and let them go theirs. We never could agree with chaps like them, and
that was the long and short of it. They were a deal too rough and ready for
Starlight; and as for Jim and me, though we were none too good, we couldn't do
some of the things these coves was up to, nor stand by and see 'em done, which
was more. This time we made up our mind to go back to the Hollow and drop out
of notice altogether for a bit, and take a rest like.</p>
<p>We hadn't heard anything of Aileen and the old mother for weeks and weeks,
so we fixed it that we should sneak over to Rocky Flat, one at a time, and see
how things were going, and hearten 'em up a bit. When we did get to the Hollow,
instead of being able to take it easy, as we expected, we found things had gone
wrong as far as the devil could send 'em that way if he tried his best. It
seems father had taken a restless fit himself, and after we were gone had
crossed Nulla Mountain to some place above Rocky Flat, to where he could see
what went on with a strong glass.</p>
<p>Before I go further I might as well tell you that, along with the whacking
big reward that was offered for all of us, a good many coves as fancied
themselves a bit had turned amateur policemen, and had all kinds of plans and
dodges for catching us dead or alive. Now, men that take to the bush like us
don't mind the regular paid force much, or bear them any malice. It's their
duty to catch us or shoot us if we bolt, and ours to take all sorts of good
care that they shan't do either if we can help it.</p>
<p>Well, as I was sayin', we don't have it in for the regulars in the police;
it's all fair pulling, 'pull devil pull baker', some one has to get the worst
of it. Now it's us, now it's them, that gets took or rubbed out, and no more
about it.</p>
<p>But what us cross coves can't stand and are mostly sure to turn nasty on is
the notion of fellows going into the manhunting trade, with us for game, either
for the fun of it or for the reward. That reward means the money paid for our
blood. <i>We don't like it</i>. It may seem curious, but we don't; and them as
take up the line as a game to make money or fun out of, when they've no call
to, find out their mistake, sometimes when it's a deal too late.</p>
<p>Now we'd heard that a party of four men&mdash;some of them had been gaol
warders and some hadn't&mdash;had made it up to follow us up and get us one way
or the other if it was to be done. They weren't in the police, but they thought
they knew quite as much as the police did; and, besides, the reward,
&pound;5000, if they got our lot and any one of the others, was no foolish
money.</p>
<p>Well, nothing would knock it out of these chaps' heads but that we were safe
to be grabbed in the long run trying to make into the old home. This was what
made them gammon to be surveyors when they first came, as we heard about, and
go measuring and tape-lining about, when there wasn't a child over eight years
old on the whole creek that couldn't have told with half an eye they wasn't
nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Well, as bad luck would have it, just as father was getting down towards the
place he meets Moran and Daly, who were making over to the Fish River on a
cattle-duffing lay of their own. They were pretty hard up; and Moran after his
rough and tumble with Jim, in which he had come off second best, was ready for
anything&mdash;anything that was bad, that is.</p>
<p>After he'd a long yarn with them about cattle and horses and what not, he
offered them a ten-pound note each if they'd do what he told them. Dad always
carried money about with him; he said it came in handy. If the police didn't
take him, they wouldn't get it; and if they did take him, why, nothing would
matter much and it might go with the rest. It came in handy enough this time,
anyhow, though it helped what had been far better left undone.</p>
<p>I remember what a blinded rage father got into when he first had Aileen's
letter, and heard that these men were camped close to the old house, poking
about there all day long, and worrying and frightening poor Aileen and
mother.</p>
<p>Well, it seems on this particular day they'd been into the little township,
and I suppose got an extra glass of grog. Anyhow, when they came back they
began to be more venturesome than they generally were. One chap came into the
house and began talking to Aileen, and after a bit mother goes into her
bedroom, and Aileen comes out into the verandah and begins to wash some clothes
in a tub, splashing the water pretty well about and making it a bit
uncomfortable for any one to come near her.</p>
<p>What must this fool do but begin to talk about what white arms she'd
got&mdash;not that they were like that much, she'd done too much hard work
lately to have her arms, or hands either, look very grand; and at last he began
to be saucy, telling her as no Marston girl ought to think so much of herself,
considerin' who and what she was. Well, the end of it was father heard a
scream, and he looked out from where he was hidden and saw Aileen running down
the garden and the fellow after her. He jumps out, and fires his revolver
slapbang at the chap; it didn't hit him, but it went that close that he stopped
dead and turned round to see who it was.</p>
<p>'Ben Marston, by all that's lucky, boys!' says he, as two of the other chaps
came running down at the shot. 'We've got the ould sarpint out of his hole at
last.' With that they all fires at father as quick as they could draw; and
Aileen gives one scream and starts running along the track up the hill that
leads to George Storefield's place.</p>
<p>Father drops; one of the bullets had hit him, but not so bad as he couldn't
run, so he ups again and starts running along the gully, with the whole four of
them shouting and swearin' after him, making sure they got him to rights this
time.</p>
<p>'Two hundred a man, boys,' the big fellow in the lead says; 'and maybe we'll
take tay with the rest of 'em now.'</p>
<p>They didn't know the man they were after, or they'd have just as soon have
gone to 'take tea', as they called it, with a tiger.</p>
<p>Father put on one of his old poacher dodges that he had borrowed from the
lapwing in his own country, that he used to tell us about when we were boys
(our wild duck 'll do just the same), and made himself out a deal worse than he
was. Father could run a bit, too; he'd been fast for a mile when he was young,
and though he was old now he never carried no flesh to signify, and was as hard
as nails. So what with knowing the ground, and they being flat-country men, he
kept just out of pistol-shot, and yet showed enough to keep 'em filled up with
the notion that they'd run him down after a bit.</p>
<p>They fired a shot every now and then, thinking a chance one might wing him,
but this only let Moran and Daly see that some one was after dad, and that the
hunt was coming their way.</p>
<p>They held steady where they had been told to stop, and looked out for the
men they'd been warned of by father. As he got near this place he kept lettin'
'em git a bit nearer and nearer to him, so as they'd follow him up just where
he wanted. It gave them more chance of hitting him, but he didn't care about
that, now his blood was up&mdash;not he. All he wanted was to get them. Dad was
the coolest old cove, when shooting was going on, ever I see. You'd think he
minded bullets no more than bottle-corks.</p>
<p>Well, he goes stumbling and dragging himself like up the gully, and they,
cocksure of getting him, closing up and shooting quicker and quicker, when just
as he jumps down the Black Gully steps a bullet did hit him in the shoulder
under the right arm, and staggers him in good earnest. He'd just time to cut
down the bank and turn to the left along the creek channel, throwing himself
down on his face among the bushes, when the whole four of 'em jumps down the
bank after him.</p>
<p>'Stand!' says Moran, and they looked up and saw him and Daly covering them
with their revolvers. Before they'd time to draw, two of 'em rolls over as dead
as door-nails.</p>
<p>The other two were dumbfoundered and knocked all of a heap by suddenly
finding themselves face to face with the very men they'd been hunting after for
weeks and weeks. They held up their pistols, but they didn't seem to have much
notion of using them&mdash;particularly when they found father had rounded on
'em too, and was standing a bit away on the side looking very ugly and with his
revolver held straight at 'em.</p>
<p>'Give in! Put down your irons,' says Moran, 'or by &mdash;&mdash;, we'll
drop ye where ye stand.'</p>
<p>'Come on,' says one, and I think he intended to make a fight for it.</p>
<p>He'd 'a been better off if he had. It couldn't have been worse for him; but
the other one didn't see a chance, and so he says&mdash;</p>
<p>'Give in, what's the good? There's three to two.'</p>
<p>'All right,' says the other chap, the big one; and they put down their
pistols.</p>
<p>It was curious now as these two were both men that father and Moran had a
down on. They'd better have fought it out as long as they could stand up.
There's no good got by givin' in that I ever seen. Men as does so always drop
in for it worse in the end.</p>
<p>First thing, then, they tied 'em with their hands behind 'em, and let 'em
stand up near their mates that were down&mdash;dead enough, both of them, one
shot through the heart and one through the head.</p>
<p>Then Moran sits down and has a smoke, and looks over at 'em.</p>
<p>'You don't remember me, Mr. Hagan?' says he, in his drawling way.</p>
<p>'No,' says the poor chap, 'I don't think I do.'</p>
<p>'But I remember you devilish well,' says Moran; 'and so you'll find afore we
leave this.' Then he took another smoke. 'Weren't you warder in Berrima Gaol,'
says he, 'about seven year ago? Ah! now we're coming to it. You don't remember
getting Daniel Moran&mdash;a prisoner serving a long sentence there&mdash;seven
days' solitary on bread and water for what you called disobedience of orders
and insolence?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I do remember now. I'd forgotten your face. I was only doing my duty,
and I hope you won't bear any malice.'</p>
<p>'It was a little thing to you, maybe,' says Moran; 'but if you'd had to do
seven long days and long cold nights in that devil's den, you'd 'a thought more
about it. But you will now. My turn's come.'</p>
<p>'I didn't do it to you more than to the rest. I had to keep order in the
gaol, and devilish hard work it was.'</p>
<p>'You're a liar,' says Moran, striking him across the face with his clenched
hand. 'You had a down on me because I wouldn't knuckle down to you like some of
them, and so you dropped it on to me every turn you could get. I was a
youngster then, and might have grown into a man if I'd been let. But fellows
like you are enough to turn any man into a devil if they've got him in their
power.'</p>
<p>'Well, I'm in your power now,' says he. 'Let's see how you'll shape.'</p>
<p>'I don't like ye any the worse for being cheeky,' says Moran, 'and standing
up to me, but it's too late. The last punishment I got, when I was kept in
irons night and day for a month because I'd tried to get out, I swore I'd have
your life if ever I came across ye.'</p>
<p>'You'll never shoot me in cold blood,' says the poor devil, beginning to
look blue about the lips.</p>
<p>'I don't know what old Ben's going to do with the man he found chevying his
daughter,' says Moran, looking at him with his deadly black-snake eyes, 'but
I'm a-goin' to shoot you as soon as I've smoked out this pipe, so don't you
make any mistake.'</p>
<p>'I don't mind a shot or two,' says Daly, 'but I'm dashed if I can stand by
and see men killed in cold blood. You coves have your own reasons, I suppose,
but I shall hook it over to the Fish River. You know where to find me.' And he
walked away to where the horses were and rode off.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>We got fresh horses and rode over quick to Rocky Flat. We took Warrigal with
us, and followed our old track across Nulla Mountain till we got within a
couple of miles of the place. Warrigal picked up the old mare's tracks, so we
knew father had made over that way, and there was no call for us to lose time
running his trail any longer. Better go straight on to the house and find out
what had happened there. We sent Warrigal on ahead, and waited with our horses
in our hands till he come back to us.</p>
<p>In about an hour he comes tearing back, with his eyes staring out of his
head.</p>
<p>'I bin see old missis,' he says. 'She yabber that one make-believe constable
bin there. Gammon-like it surveyor, and bimeby old man Ben gon' alonga hut, and
that one pleeceman fire at him and all about, and him break back alonga
gully.'</p>
<p>'Any of 'em come back?' says Jim.</p>
<p>'Bale! me see um tent-dog tied up. Cake alonga fireplace, all burn to
pieces. No come home last night. I b'lieve shot 'em old man longa gully.'</p>
<p>'Come along, boys,' says Starlight, jumping into his saddle. 'The old man
might have been hit. We must run the tracks and see what's come of the
governor. Four to one's big odds.'</p>
<p>We skirted the hut and kept out wide till Warrigal cut the tracks, which he
did easy enough. We couldn't see a blessed thing. Warrigal rode along with his
head down, reading every tuft of grass, every little stone turned up, every
foot of sand, like a book.</p>
<p>'Your old fader run likit Black Gully. Two fellow track here&mdash;bullet
longa this one tree.' Here he pointed to a scratch on the side of a box tree,
in which the rough bark had been shivered. 'Bimeby two fellow more come;
'nother one bullet; 'nother one here, too. This one blood drop longa white
leaf.'</p>
<p>Here he picked up a dried gum leaf, which had on the upper side a dark red
spot, slightly irregular.</p>
<p>We had it all now. We came to a place where two horses had been tied to a
tree. They had been stamping and pawing, as if they had been there a goodish
while and had time to get pretty sick of it.</p>
<p>'That near side one Moran's horse, pigeon-toes; me know 'em,' says Warrigal.
'Off side one Daly's roan horse, new shoes on. You see 'um hair, rub himself
longa tree.'</p>
<p>'What the blazes were they doing hereabouts?' says Starlight. 'This begins
to look complicated. Whatever the row was, Daly and he were in it. There's no
one rich enough to rob hereabouts, is there? I don't like the look of it. Ride
on, boys.'</p>
<p>We said nothing to each other, but rode along as fast as Warrigal could
follow the line. The sky, which was bright enough when we started, clouded
over, and in less than ten minutes the wind rose and rain began to pour down in
buckets, with no end of thunder and lightning. Then it got that cold we could
hardly sit on our horses for trembling. The sky grew blacker and blacker. The
wind began to whistle and cry till I could almost swear I heard some one
singing out for help. Nulla Mountain was as black as your hat, and a kind of
curious feeling crept over me, I hardly knew why, as if something was going to
happen, I didn't know what.</p>
<p>I fully expected to find father dead; and, though he wasn't altogether a
good father to us, we both felt bad at the notion of his lyin' there cold and
stiff. I began to think of him as he used to be when we were boys, and when he
wasn't so out and out hard&mdash;and had a kind word for poor mother and a kiss
for little Aileen.</p>
<p>But if he were shot or taken, why hadn't these other men come back? We had
just ridden by their tents, and they looked as if they'd just been left for a
bit by men who were coming back at night. The dog was howling and looked
hungry. Their blankets were all thrown about. Anyhow, there was a kettle on the
fire, which was gone out; and more than that, there was the damper that
Warrigal had seen lying in the ashes all burnt to a cinder.</p>
<p>Everything looked as if they'd gone off in a hurry, and never come back at
night or since. One of their horses was tied with a tether rope close to the
tent poles, and he'd been walking round and trampling down the grass, as if
he'd been there all night. We couldn't make it out.</p>
<p>We rode on, hardly looking at one another, but following Warrigal, who
rattled on now, hardly looking at the ground at all, like a dog with a burning
scent. All of a sudden he pulls up, and points to a dip into a cross gully,
like an old river, which we all knew.</p>
<p>'You see um crow? I b'leeve longa Black Gully.'</p>
<p>Sure enough, just above the drop down, where we used to gallop our ponies in
old times and laugh to see 'em throw up their tails, there were half-a-dozen
crows and a couple of eagle-hawks high up in the sky, wheeling and circling
over the same place.</p>
<p>'By George! they've got the old man,' says Jim. 'Come on, Dick. I never
thought poor old dad would be run down like this.'</p>
<p>'Or he's got them!' says Starlight, curling his lip in a way he had. 'I
don't believe your old governor's dead till I see him. The devil himself
couldn't grab him on his own ground.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 38</h2>
<p>We all pulled up at the side of the gully or dry creek, whatever it was, and
jumped off our horses, leaving Warrigal to look after them, and ran down the
rocky sides of it.</p>
<p>'Great God!' Starlight cries out, 'what's that?' and he pointed to a small
sloping bit of grass just underneath the bank. 'Who are they? Can they be
asleep?'</p>
<p>They were asleep, never to wake. As we stood side by side by the dead men,
for there were four of them, we shook so, Jim and I, that we leaned against one
another for support. We had never seen a sight before that like it. I never
want to do so again.</p>
<p>There they lay, four dead men. We didn't know them ourselves, but guessed
they were Hagan and his lot. How else did they come there? and how could dad
have shot them all by himself, and laid them out there? Were Daly and Moran
with him? This looked like Moran's damnable work.</p>
<p>We looked and looked. I rubbed my eyes. Could it be real? The sky was dark,
and the daylight going fast. The mountain hung over us black and
dreadful-looking. The wind whimpered up and down the hillside with a sort of
cry in it. Everything was dark and dismal and almost unnatural-looking.</p>
<p>All four men were lying on their backs side by side, with their eyes staring
up to the sky&mdash;staring&mdash;staring! When we got close beside them we
could see they had all been shot&mdash;one man through the head, the rest
through the body. The two nearest to me had had their hands tied; the bit of
rope was lying by one and his wrist was chafed.</p>
<p>One had been so close to the man that shot him that the powder had burnt his
shirt. It wasn't for anything they had either, for every man's notes (and one
had four fives and some ones) were pinned to them outside of their pockets, as
if to show every one that those who killed them wanted their blood and not
their money.</p>
<p>'This is a terrible affair, boys,' said Starlight; and his voice sounded
strange and hoarse. 'I never thought we should be mixed up with a deed like
this. I see how it was done. They have been led into a trap. Your father has
made 'em think they could catch him; and had Daly and Moran waiting for
them&mdash;one on each side of this hole here. Warrigal'&mdash;for he had tied
up his horse and crept up&mdash;'how many bin here?'</p>
<p>Warrigal held up three fingers.</p>
<p>'That one ran down here&mdash;one after one. I see 'em boot. Moran stand
here. Patsey Daly lie down behind that ole log. All about boot-nail mark. Old
man Ben he stand here. Dog bite'm this one.'</p>
<p>Here he stooped and touched a dead man's ankle. Sure enough there was the
mark of Crib's teeth, with the front one missing, that had been kicked down his
throat by a wild mare.</p>
<p>'Two fellow tumble down fust-like; then two fellow bimeby.
One&mdash;two&mdash;three fellow track go along a flat that way. Then that one
get two horses and ridem likit Fish River. Penty blood tumble down here.'</p>
<p>This was the ciphering up of the whole thing. It was clear enough now. Moran
and Daly had waited for them here, and had shot down the two first men. Of the
others, it was hard to say whether they died in fair fight or had been taken
prisoners and shot afterwards. Either way it was bad enough. What a noise it
would make! The idea of four men, well known to the Government, and engaged in
hunting down outlaws on whose head a price was set, to be deliberately
shot&mdash;murdered in cold blood, as there was some ground for thinking to be
the case. What would be the end of it all?</p>
<p>We had done things that were bad enough, but a deliberate, cold-blooded,
shameful piece of bloodshed like this had never been heard of in New South
Wales before.</p>
<p>There was nothing more to be done. We couldn't stay any longer looking at
the dead men; it was no use burying them, even if we'd had the time. We hadn't
done it, though we should be sure to be mixed up with it somehow.</p>
<p>'We must be moving, lads,' said Starlight. 'As soon as this gets wind
there'll be another rush out this way, and every policeman and newspaper
reporter in the country will be up at Black Gully. When they're found everybody
will see that they've been killed for vengeance and not for plunder. But the
sooner they're found the better.'</p>
<p>'Best send word to Billy the Boy,' I said; 'he'll manage to lay them on
without hurting himself.'</p>
<p>'All right. Warrigal knows a way of communicating with him; I'll send him
off at once. And now the sooner we're at the Hollow the better for
everybody.'</p>
<p>We rode all night. Anything was better than stopping still with such
thoughts as we were likely to have for companions. About daylight we got to the
Hollow. Not far from the cave we found father's old mare with the saddle on and
the reins trailing on the ground. There was a lot of blood on the saddle too,
and the reins were smeared all about with it; red they were to the buckles, so
was her mane.</p>
<p>We knew then something was wrong, and that the old man was hard hit, or he'd
never have let her go loose like that. When we got to the cave the dog came out
to meet us, and then walked back whining in a queer way towards the log at the
mouth, where we used to sit in the evenings.</p>
<p>There was father, sure enough, lying on his face in a pool of blood, and to
all appearances as dead as the men we'd just left.</p>
<p>We lifted him up, and Starlight looked close and careful at him by the light
of the dawn, that was just showing up over the tree tops to the east.</p>
<p>'He's not dead; I can feel his heart beat,' he said. 'Carry him in, boys,
and we'll soon see what's the matter with him.'</p>
<p>We took his waistcoat and shirt off&mdash;a coat he never wore unless it was
raining. Hard work we had to do it, they was so stuck to his skin when the
blood had dried.</p>
<p>'By gum! he's been hit bad enough,' says Jim. 'Look here, and here, poor old
dad!'</p>
<p>'There's not much "poor" about it, Jim,' says Starlight. 'Men that play at
bowls must expect to get rubbers. They've come off second best in this row, and
I wish it had been different, for several reasons.'</p>
<p>Dad was hit right through the top of the left shoulder. The ball had gone
through the muscle and lodged somewhere. We couldn't see anything of it.
Another bullet had gone right through him, as far as we could make out, under
the breast on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>'That looks like a good-bye shot,' says Starlight; 'see how the blood comes
welling out still; but it hasn't touched the lungs. There's no blood on his
lips, and his breathing is all right. What's this? Only through the muscle of
the right arm. That's nothing; and this graze on the ribs, a mere scratch. Dash
more water in his face, Jim. He's coming to.'</p>
<p>After a few minutes he did come to, sure enough, and looked round when he
found himself in bed.</p>
<p>'Where am I?' says he.</p>
<p>'You're at home,' I said, 'in the Hollow.'</p>
<p>'Dashed if I ever thought I'd get here,' he says. 'I was that bad I nearly
tumbled off the old mare miles away. She must have carried me in while I was
unsensible. I don't remember nothing after we began to get down the track into
the Hollow. Where is she?'</p>
<p>'Oh! we found her near the cave, with the saddle and bridle on.'</p>
<p>'That's all right. Bring me a taste of grog, will ye; I'm a'most dead with
thirst. Where did I come from last, I wonder? Oh, I seem to know now. Settling
accounts with that &mdash;&mdash; dog that insulted my gal. Moran got square
with t'other. That'll learn 'em to leave old Ben Marston alone when he's not
meddling with them.'</p>
<p>'Never mind talking about that now,' I said. 'You had a near shave of it,
and it will take you all your time to pull through now.'</p>
<p>'I wasn't hit bad till just as I was going to drop down into Black Gully,'
he said. 'I stood one minute, and that cursed wretch Hagan had a steady shot at
me. I had one at him afterwards, though, with his hands tied, too.'</p>
<p>'God forgive you!' says Jim, 'for shooting men in cold blood. I couldn't do
it for all the gold in Turon, nor for no other reason. It'll bring us bad luck,
too; see if it don't.'</p>
<p>'You're too soft, Jim,' says the old man. 'You ain't a bad chap; but any
young fellow of ten years old can buy and sell you. Where's that brandy and
water?'</p>
<p>'Here it is,' says Jim; 'and then you lie down and take a sleep. You'll have
to be quiet and obey orders now&mdash;that is if a few more years' life's any
good to you.'</p>
<p>The brandy and water fetched him to pretty well, but after that he began to
talk, and we couldn't stop him. Towards night he got worse and worse and his
head got hotter, and he kept on with all kinds of nonsense, screeching out that
he was going to be hung and they were waiting to take him away, but if he could
get the old mare he'd be all right; besides a lot of mixed-up things about
cattle and horses that we didn't know the right of.</p>
<p>Starlight said he was delirious, and that if he hadn't some one to nurse him
he'd die as sure as fate. We couldn't be always staying with him, and didn't
understand what was to be done much. We didn't like to let him lie there and
die, so at long last we made up our minds to see if we could get Aileen over to
nurse him for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Well, we scribbled a bit of a letter and sent Warrigal off with it. Wasn't
it dangerous for him? Not a bit of it. He could go anywhere all over the whole
country, and no trooper of them all could manage to put the bracelets on him.
The way he'd work it would be to leave his horse a good way the other side of
George Storefield's, and to make up as a regular blackfellow. He could do that
first-rate, and talk their lingo, too, just like one of themselves. Gin or
blackfellow, it was all the same to Warrigal. He could make himself as black as
soot, and go barefooted with a blanket or a 'possum rug round him and beg for
siccapence, and nobody'd ever bowl him out. He took us in once at the diggings;
Jim chucked him a shilling, and told him to go away and not come bothering near
us.</p>
<p>So away Warrigal went, and we knew he'd get through somehow. He was one of
those chaps that always does what they're told, and never comes back and says
they can't do it, or they've lost their horse, or can't find the way, or they'd
changed their mind, or something.</p>
<p>No; once he'd started there was no fear of him not scoring somehow or other.
Whatever Starlight told him to do, day or night, foul weather or fair, afoot or
on horseback, that thing was done if Warrigal was alive to do it.</p>
<p>What we'd written to Aileen was telling her that father was that bad we
hardly thought he'd pull through, and that if she wanted to save his life she
must come to the Hollow and nurse him.</p>
<p>How to get her over was not the easiest thing in the world, but she could
ride away on her old pony without anybody thinking but she was going to fetch
up the cows, and then cut straight up the gully to the old yard in the scrub on
Nulla Mountain. One of us would meet her there with a fresh horse and bring her
safe into the Hollow. If all went well she would be there in the afternoon on a
certain day; anyhow we'd be there to meet her, come or no come.</p>
<p>She wouldn't fail us, we were dead sure. She had suffered a lot by him and
us too; but, like most women, the very moment anything happened to any of us,
even to dad, everything flew out of her head, except that we were sick or sorry
and wanted her help. Help, of course; wasn't she willing to give that, and her
rest and comfort, health, even life itself, to wear herself out, hand and foot,
for any one of her own family?</p>
<p>So poor Aileen made her way up all alone to the old scrub stockyard. Jim and
I had ridden up to it pretty early (he wouldn't stop behind) with a nice,
well-bred little horse that had shone a bit at country races for her to ride
on. We waited there a goodish while, we lying down and our horses hung up not
far off for fear we might be 'jumped' by the police at any time.</p>
<p>At last we sees the old pony's head coming bobbing along through the scrub
along the worn-out cattle track, grown up as it was, and sure enough there was
Aileen on him, with her gray riding skirt and an old felt hat on. She'd nothing
with her; she was afraid to bring a ha'porth of clothes or anything for fear
they should any of 'em tumble that she was going a long way, and, perhaps,
follow her up. So she had to hand that over to Warrigal, and trust to him to
bring it on some way or other. We saw her before she saw us, and Jim gave a
whistle just as he used to do when he was coming home late at night. She knew
it at once, and a smile for a minute came over her pale face; such a sad sort
of one it was too, as if she was wondering at herself that she could feel that
pleased at anything.</p>
<p>Whatever thoughts was in her mind, she roused up the old pony, and came
towards us quick as soon as she catches sight of us. In two seconds Jim had
lifted her down in his strong arms, and was holding her off the ground and
hugging her as if she'd been a child. How the tears ran down her cheeks, though
all the time she was kissing him with her arms round his neck; and me too, when
I came up, just as if we were boys and girls again.</p>
<p>After a bit she wiped her eyes, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>'How's father?'</p>
<p>'Very bad,' I said; 'off his head, and raving. It'll be a close thing with
him. Here's your horse now, and a good one too. We must let the old pony go;
he'll make home fast enough.'</p>
<p>She patted his neck and we turned him loose. He slued round and went away
steady, picking a bit as he went. He'd be home next day easy enough, and nobody
the wiser where he'd been to.</p>
<p>We'd brought a bit to eat and a glass of wine for the girl in case she was
faint, but she wouldn't take anything but a crust of bread and a drink of
water. There was a spring that ran all the year round near the cattle-yard; and
off went we, old Lieutenant holding up his head and showing himself off. He
didn't get such a rider on his back every day.</p>
<p>'What a dear horse,' she said, as she pulled him together a bit like and
settled herself fair and square in the saddle. 'Oh, how I could enjoy all this
if&mdash;if&mdash;O my God! shall we ever know a moment's peace and happiness
in this world again? Are we always to be sunk in wretchedness and misery as
long as we live?'</p>
<p>We didn't lose much time after that, you be sure. Up and down, thick and
open, rough or smooth, we made the pace good, and Aileen gave us all we knew to
keep ahead of her. We had a good light when we got to the drop down into the
Hollow. The sun was just setting, and if we'd had time or thought to give to
the looks of things, no doubt it was a grand sight.</p>
<p>All the Hollow was lighted up, and looked like a green sea with islands of
trees in it. The rock towers on the other side of the range were shining and
glittering like as if they were made of crystallised quartz or
diamonds&mdash;red and white. There was a sort of mist creeping up the valley
at the lower end under the mountain that began to soften the fire colours, and
mix them up like. Even the mountain, that mostly looked black and dreary,
frowning at our ways, was of purple and gold, with pale shadows of green and
gray.</p>
<p>Aileen pulled up as we did, and jumped off our horses.</p>
<p>'So this is the Hollow,' she said, half talking to herself, 'that I've heard
and thought so much about. What a lovely, lovely place! Surely it ought to have
a different effect on the people that lived there.'</p>
<p>'Better come off, Ailie, and lead your horse down here,' says Jim, 'unless
you want to ride down, like Starlight did, the first time we saw him.'</p>
<p>'Starlight! is he here?' she said, in a surprised sort of way. 'I never
thought of that.'</p>
<p>'Of course he is; where else should he be? Why don't you lead on, Dick?'</p>
<p>'Won't you get off? It's not altogether safe,' I said, 'though Lieutenant's
all right on his old pins.'</p>
<p>'Safe!' she said, with a bitter sort of laugh. 'What does it matter if a
Marston girl does break her neck, or her heart either?'</p>
<p>She never said another word, but sat upright with a set face on her, as the
old horse picked his way down after ours, and except when he put his foot on a
rolling stone, never made a slip or a stumble all the way down, though it was
like going down the side of a house.</p>
<p>When we got to the valley we put on a spurt to the cave, and found Warrigal
sitting on the log in front of us. He'd got home first, of course, and there
was Aileen's bundle, a biggish one too, alongside of him. We could hear father
raving and screaming out inside dreadful. Starlight wasn't nigh hand anywhere.
He had walked off when Warrigal came home, and left him to watch the old
man.</p>
<p>'He been like that all the time, Warrigal?'</p>
<p>'No! Captain say big one sleep. Him give him medicine like; then wake up and
go on likit that. I believe him bad along a cobra.'</p>
<p>Aileen had jumped off her horse and gone in to the old man the moment we
came up and she heard his voice.</p>
<p>All that long night we could hear him talking to himself, groaning, cursing,
shouting, arguing. It was wonderful how a man who talked so little as father
could have had so many thoughts in his mind. But then they all are boxed up
together in every man's heart. At a time like this they come racing and
tumbling out like a flock of sheep out of a yard when the hurdle's down. What a
dashed queer thing human nature is when you come to think of it. That a man
should be able to keep his tongue quiet, and shut the door on all the sounds
and images and wishes that goes racing about inside of his mind like wild
horses in a paddock!</p>
<p>One day he'll be smiling and sensible, looking so honest all the time. Next
day a knock on the head or a little vein goes crack in the brain (as the doctor
told me); then the rails are down, and everything comes out with a rush into
the light of day&mdash;right and wrong, foul and fair, station brands and
clearskins, it don't make no difference.</p>
<p>Father was always one of the closest men that ever lived. He never told us
much about his old life at home or after he came out here. Now he was letting
drop things here and there that helped us to a few secrets he'd never told to
no man. They made poor Aileen a bit more miserable than she'd been before, if
that was possible; but it didn't matter much to us. We were pretty tired
ourselves that night, and so we got Aileen all she wanted, and left her alone
with him.</p>
<p>While we were away to meet her some one had taken the trouble to put up a
bit of a partition, separating that part of the cave from the other; it was
built up of stone&mdash;there was plenty about&mdash;and not so roughly done
either. It made Aileen feel a lot more comfortable. Of course there was only
one man who could have done it; and that was Starlight.</p>
<h2>Chapter 39</h2>
<p>Towards morning father went into a heavy sleep; he didn't wake till the
afternoon. Poor Aileen was able to get a doze and change her dress. After
breakfast, while we were having a bit of a chat, in walks Starlight. He bowed
to Aileen quite respectful, as he always did to a woman, and then shook hands
with her.</p>
<p>'Welcome to the Hollow, Miss Marston,' he said. 'I can't say how charmed I
am in one sense, though I regret the necessity which brought you here.'</p>
<p>'I'm glad to come, and only for poor father's being so bad I could delight
in the life here.'</p>
<p>'How do you find your father?'</p>
<p>'He is asleep now, and perhaps the rest will do him good.'</p>
<p>'He may awake free from fever,' says Starlight. 'I took the risk of giving
him an opiate before you came, and I think the result has been favourable.'</p>
<p>'Oh! I hope he will be better when he wakes,' says Aileen, 'and that I shall
not have to watch through another dreadful night of raving. I can hardly bear
it.'</p>
<p>'You must make your brothers take their share; it's not fair to you.'</p>
<p>'Thank you; but I feel as if I couldn't leave him to anybody but myself. He
seems so weak now; a little neglect might kill him.'</p>
<p>'Pardon me, Miss Marston; you overrate the danger. Depend upon it, your
respected parent will be quite a different man in a week, though it may be a
month or more before he is fully recovered. You don't know what a constitution
he has.'</p>
<p>'You have given me fresh hope,' she said. 'I feel quite cheered
up&mdash;that is' (and she sighed) 'if I could be cheerful again about
anything.'</p>
<p>Here she walked into the cave and sat down by father to watch till he awoke,
and we all went out about our daily work, whatever it was&mdash;nothing very
wonderful, I daresay, but it kept us from thinking.</p>
<p>Starlight was right. As luck would have it, father woke up a deal better
than when he laid down. The fever had gone away, his head was right again, and
he began to ask for something to eat&mdash;leastways to drink, first. But
Aileen wouldn't give him any of that, and very little to eat. Starlight had
told her what to do in case he wanted what wasn't good for him, and as she was
pretty middling obstinate, like himself, she took her own ways.</p>
<p>After this he began to get right; it wasn't easy to kill old dad. He seemed
to be put together with wire and whip-cord; not made of flesh and blood like
other men. I don't wonder old England's done so much and gone so far with her
soldiers and sailors if they was bred like him. It's my notion if they was
caught young, kept well under command, and led by men they respected, a
regiment or a man-of-war's crew like him would knock smoke out of any other
thousand men the world could put up. More's the pity there ain't some better
way of keeping 'em straight than there is.</p>
<p>He was weak for a bit&mdash;very weak; he'd lost a deal of blood; and, try
how he would, he couldn't stand up long at a time, and had to give in and lie
down in spite of himself. It fretted him a deal, of course; he'd never been on
his back before, and he couldn't put up with it. Then his temper began to show
again, and Aileen had a deal to bear and put up with.</p>
<p>We'd got a few books, and there was the papers, of course, so she used to
read to him by the hour together. He was very fond of hearing about things,
and, like a good many men that can't read and write, he was clever enough in
his own way. When she'd done all the newspapers&mdash;they were old ones (we
took care not to get any fresh ones, for fear she'd see about Hagan and the
others)&mdash;she used to read about battles and sea-fights to him; he cared
about them more than anything, and one night, after her reading to him about
the battle of Trafalgar, he turned round to her and says, 'I ought to have been
in that packet, Ailie, my girl. I was near going for a sailor once, on board a
man-o'-war, too. I tried twice to get away to sea, that was before I'd snared
my first hare, and something stopped me both times. Once I was fetched back and
flogged, and pretty nigh starved. I never did no good afterwards. But it's came
acrost me many and many a time that I'd been a different sort o' chap if I'd
had my will then. I was allays fond o' work, and there couldn't be too much
fightin' for me; so a man-o'-war in those days would have been just the thing
to straighten me. That was the best chance I ever had. Well, I don't say as I
haven't had others&mdash;plenty in this country, and good ones too; but it was
too late&mdash;I'd got set. When a man's young, that's the time he can be
turned right way or wrong. It's none so easy afterwards.'</p>
<p>He went to sleep then, and Aileen said that was the only time he ever spoke
to her in that way. We never heard him talk like that, nor nobody else, I
expect.</p>
<p>If we could have got some things out of our heads, that was the pleasantest
time ever we spent in the Hollow. After father could be left by himself for a
few hours we got out the horses, and used to take Aileen out for long rides all
over the place, from one end to the other. It did her good, and we went to
every hole and corner in it. She was never tired of looking at the great rock
towers, as we used to call 'em, where the sandstone walls hung over, just like
the pictures of castles, till, Starlight said, in the evenings you could fancy
you saw flags waving and sentinels walking up and down on them.</p>
<p>One afternoon we went out to the place where the old hermit had lived and
died. We walked over his old garden, and talked about the box we'd dug up, and
all the rest of it. Starlight came with us, and he persuaded Aileen to ride
Rainbow that day, and, my word, they made a splendid pair.</p>
<p>She'd dressed herself up that afternoon just a little bit more than common,
poor thing, and put a bit of pink ribbon on and trimmed up her hat, and looked
as if she began to see a little more interest in things. It didn't take much to
make her look nice, particularly on horseback. Her habit fitted her out and
out, and she had the sort of figure that, when a girl can ride well, and you
see her swaying, graceful and easy-like, to every motion of a spirited horse,
makes you think her handsomer than any woman can look on the ground. We rode
pretty fast always, and it brought a bit of colour to her face. The old horse
got pulling and prancing a bit, though he was that fine-tempered he'd carry a
child almost, and Jim and I thought we hadn't seen her look like herself before
this for years past.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful warm evening, though summer was over, and we were getting
into the cold nights and sharp mornings again, just before the regular winter
weather. There was going to be a change, and there were a few clouds coming up
from the north-west; but for all that it had been quite like a spring day. The
turf on all the flats in the Hollow was splendid and sound. The grass had never
been cut up with too heavy stocking (which ruins half the country, I believe),
and there was a good thick undergrowth underneath. We had two or three little
creeks to cross, and they were pretty full, except at the crossing places, and
rippled over the stones and sparkled in the sun like the brooks we'd heard tell
of in the old country. Everything was so quiet, and bright and happy-looking,
that we could hardly fancy we were the men we were; and that all this wild work
had been going on outside of the valley that looked so peaceful and
innocent.</p>
<p>There was Starlight riding alongside of Aileen on his second-best horse, and
he was no commoner either (though he didn't come up to Rainbow, nor no other
horse I ever saw), talking away in his pleasant, easy-going way. You'd think he
hadn't got a thing to trouble him in the world. She, for a wonder, was smiling,
and seemed to be enjoying herself for once in a way, with the old horse arching
his neck, and spinning along under her as light as a greyhound, and as smooth
as oil. It was something like a pleasant ride. I never forgot that evening, and
I never shall.</p>
<p>We rode up to the ruined hut of the solitary man who had lived there so
long, and watched the sun go down so often behind the rock towers from his seat
under the big peach tree.</p>
<p>'What a wonderful thing to think of!' Aileen says, as she slipped down off
her side-saddle.</p>
<p>We dismounted, too, and hung up our horses.</p>
<p>'Only to think that he was living here before we were born, or father came
to Rocky Flat. Oh! if we could have come here when we were little how we should
have enjoyed it! It would have seemed fairyland to us.'</p>
<p>'It always astonishes me,' said Starlight, 'how any human being can consent
to live, year after year, the same life in the same place. I should go mad
half-a-dozen times over. Change and adventure are the very breath of my
nostrils.'</p>
<p>'He had the memory of his dead wife to keep him,' said Aileen. 'Her spirit
soothed the restless heart that would have wandered far into the wilds
again.'</p>
<p>'It may be so,' said Starlight dreamily. 'I have known no such influences.
An outlaw I, by forest laws, almost since the days of my boyhood, I shall be so
till the day of my death,' he added.</p>
<p>'If I were a man I should go everywhere,' said Aileen, her eyes sparkling
and her face regular lighted up. 'I have never been anywhere or seen anything,
hardly so much as a church, a soldier, a shop-window, or the sea, begging his
pardon for putting him last. But oh! what a splendid thing to be rich; no, not
that altogether, but to be able to go wherever you liked, and have enough not
to be troubled about money.'</p>
<p>'To be free, and have a mind at ease; it doesn't seem so much,' said
Starlight, talking almost to himself; 'and yet how we fools and madmen shut
ourselves out of it for ever, for ever, sometimes by a single act of folly,
hardly crime. That comes after.'</p>
<p>'The sun is going down behind the great rock tower,' Aileen says, as if she
hadn't heard him. Perhaps she didn't. When people have a lot on their minds
they're half their time thinking their own thoughts. 'How all the lovely
colours are fading away. Life seems so much like that&mdash;a little
brightness, then gray twilight, night and darkness so soon after.'</p>
<p>'Now and then there's a star; you must admit that, Miss Marston,' says he,
cheerful and pleasant again; he was never down for long at a time. 'And there's
that much-abused luminary, the moon; you'll see her before we get home. We're
her sworn votaries and worshippers, you know.'</p>
<p>We had to ride a bit to get home with any kind of light, for we didn't want
father to be growling or kicking up a row with Warrigal that we left to look
after him. But a few miles didn't matter much on such a road, and with horses
in such buckle as ours.</p>
<p>The stars came out after a while, and the sky was that clear, without a
cloud in it, that it was a better light to ride by than the moon throws. Jim
and I sometimes rode on one side and sometimes the other; but there was old
Rainbow always in the lead, playing with his bit and arching his neck, and
going with Aileen's light weight on him as if he could go on all night at the
same pace and think nothing of it; and I believe he could.</p>
<p>When we got home dad was grumpy, and wondered what we wanted riding the
horses about when there was nothing to do and nothing to see. But Warrigal had
made him a pot of tea, and he was able to smoke now; so he wasn't so bad after
all. We made ourselves pretty comfortable&mdash;Aileen said she'd got a good
appetite, for a wonder&mdash;and we sat chatting round the fire and talking
away quite like old days till the moon was pretty high.</p>
<p>Father didn't get well all at once. He went back twice because he would try
to do too much, and wouldn't be said by Starlight or Aileen either when he took
a thing into his head; then he'd have to be nursed and looked after day and
night again just the same as ever. So it took near a month before he was
regularly on his pins again, and going about as he did before he was hit. His
right arm was a bit stiff, too; it used to pain and make him swear awful now
and again. Anyhow, Aileen made us that comfortable and happy while she was
there, we didn't care how long he took getting well.</p>
<p>Those were out and out the pleasantest days we ever spent in the
Hollow&mdash;the best time almost Jim and I had had since we were boys. Nearly
every day we rode out in the afternoon, and there wasn't a hole or corner, a
spring or a creek inside the walls of the old Hollow that we didn't show
Aileen. She was that sort of girl she took an interest in everything; she began
to know all the horses and cattle as well as we did ourselves. Rainbow was
regular given up to her, and the old horse after a bit knew her as well as his
master. I never seen a decent horse that didn't like to have a woman on his
back; that is, if she was young and lissom and could ride a bit. They seem to
know, in a sort of way. I've seen horses that were no chop for a man to ride,
and that wouldn't be particular about bucking you off if the least thing
started them, but went as quiet as mice with a girl on their backs.</p>
<p>So Aileen used to make Rainbow walk and amble his best, so that all the rest
of us, when she did it for fun, had to jog. Then she'd jump him over logs or
the little trickling deep creeks that ran down to the main water; or she'd
pretend to have a race and go off full gallop, riding him at his best for a
quarter of a mile; then he'd pull up as easy as if he'd never gone out of a
walk.</p>
<p>'How strange all this is,' she said one day; 'I feel as if I were living on
an island. It's quite like playing at "Robinson Crusoe", only there's no sea.
We don't seem to be able to get out all the same. It's a happy, peaceful life,
too. Why can't we keep on for ever like this, and shut out the wicked,
sorrowful world altogether?'</p>
<p>'Quite of your opinion, Miss Marston; why should we ever change?' says
Starlight, who was sitting down with the rest of us by the side of our biggest
river. We had been fishing all the afternoon and done well. 'Let us go home no
more; I am quite contented. But what about poor Jim? He looks sadder every
day.'</p>
<p>'He is fretting for his wife, poor fellow, and I don't wonder. You are one
of those natures that never change, Jim; and if you don't get away soon, or see
some chance of rejoining her, you will die. How you are to do it I don't
know.'</p>
<p>'I am bound to make a try next month,' says Jim. 'If I don't do something
towards it I shall go mad.'</p>
<p>'You could not do a wiser thing,' says Starlight, 'in one way, or more
foolish thing in another. Meantime, why should we not make the best of the
pleasant surroundings with which Nature provides us here&mdash;green turf,
sparkling water, good sport, and how bright a day! Could we be more favoured by
Fortune, slippery dame that she is? It is an Australian Decameron without the
naughty stories.'</p>
<p>'Do you know, sometimes I really think I am enjoying myself,' said Aileen,
half to herself, 'and then I feel that it must be a dream. Such dreadful things
are waiting for me&mdash;for us all.' Then she shuddered and trembled.</p>
<p>She did not know the most dreadful thing of all yet. We had carefully kept
it from her. We chanced its not reaching her ears until after she had got home
safe and had time to grieve over it all by herself.</p>
<p>We had a kind of feeling somehow that us four might never meet again in the
same way, or be able to enjoy one another's company for a month, without fear
of interruption, again, as long as we lived.</p>
<p>So we all made up our minds, in spite of the shadow of evil that would crawl
up now and then, to enjoy each other's company while it lasted, and make the
best of it.</p>
<p>Starlight for all that seemed altered like, and every now and then he'd go
off with Warrigal and stay away from daylight to dark. When he did come he'd
sit for hours with his hands before him and never say a word to any one. I saw
Aileen watch him when he looked like that, not that she ever said anything, but
pretended to take it as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Other times he'd be just as much the other way. He'd read to her, and he had
a good many books, poetry, and all kinds of things stowed away in the part of
the cave he called his own. And he'd talk about other countries that he'd been
in, and the strange people he'd seen, by the hour together, while she would sit
listening and looking at him, hardly saying a thing, and regular bound up in
his words. And he could talk once he was set agoing. I never saw a man that
could come up to him.</p>
<p>Aileen wasn't one of those sort of girls that took a fancy to any
good-looking sort of fellow that came across her. Quite the other way. She
seemed to think so little about it that Jim and I always used to say she'd be
an old maid, and never marry at all. And she used to say she didn't think she
ever would. She never seemed to trouble her head about the thing at all, but I
always knew that if ever she did set her fancy upon a man, and take a liking to
him, it would not be for a year or two, but for ever. Though she'd mother's
good heart and softness about her, she'd a dash of dad's obstinacy in her
blood, and once she made up her mind about anything she wasn't easy turned.</p>
<p>Jim and I could see clear enough that she was taking to Starlight; but then
so many women had done that, had fallen in love with him and had to fall out
again&mdash;as far as we could see. He used to treat them all alike&mdash;very
kind and respectful, but like a lot of children. What was the use of a wife to
him? 'No,' he said, once or twice, 'I can bear my fate, because my blood does
not run in the veins of a living soul in Australia. If it were otherwise I
could not bear my reflections. As it is, the revolver has more than once nearly
been asked to do me last service.'</p>
<p>Though both Aileen and he seemed to like each other, Jim and I never thought
there was anything in it, and let them talk and ride and walk together just as
they pleased. Aileen always had a good word for Starlight, and seemed to pity
him so for having to lead such a life, and because he said he had no hope of
ever getting free from it. Then, of course, there was a mystery about him.
Nobody knew who he'd been, or almost where he had come from&mdash;next to
nothing about him had ever come out. He was an Englishman&mdash;that was
certain&mdash;but he must have come young to the colony. No one could look at
him for a moment and see his pale, proud face, his dark
eyes&mdash;half-scornful, half-gloomy, except when he was set up a bit (and
then you didn't like to look at them at all)&mdash;without seeing that he was a
gentleman to the tips of his delicate-looking fingers, no matter what he'd
done, or where he'd been.</p>
<p>He was rather over the middle size; because he was slight made, he always
looked rather tall than not. He was tremendous strong, too, though he didn't
look that, and as active as a cat, though he moved as if walking was too much
trouble altogether, and running not to be thought of.</p>
<p>We didn't expect it would do either of 'em much good. How could it, even if
they did fall in love with one another and make it up to get married? But they
were both able to take care of themselves, and it was no use interfering with
'em either. They weren't that sort.</p>
<p>Starlight had plenty of money, besides his share of the gold. If we could
ever get away from this confounded rock-walled prison, good as it was in some
ways; and if he and Aileen and the rest of us could make a clean dart of it and
get to America, we could live there free and happy yet, in spite of all that
had come and gone.</p>
<p>Aileen wasn't like to leave poor old mother as long as she wanted her, so it
couldn't come off for a year or two at earliest, and many things were sure to
happen in the meanwhile. So we let all the talking and walking and riding out
in the evening go on as much as they pleased, and never said anything or seemed
to take any notice at all about it.</p>
<p>All this time mother was at George Storefield's. When Aileen ran over that
time, he said it wasn't fit for them to live at Rocky Flat by themselves. So he
went over that very day&mdash;like a good fellow, as he was&mdash;and brought
over the old woman, and made them both stay at his house, safe and comfortable.
When Aileen said she had to go away to nurse dad he said he would take care of
mother till she came back, and so she'd been there all the time. She knew Mrs.
Storefield (George's mother) well in the old times; so they used to sit by the
kitchen fire when they wanted to be extra comfortable, and knit stockings and
talk over the good old times to their hearts' content.</p>
<p>If it hadn't been for old Mrs. Storefield I don't expect mother would have
contented herself there&mdash;the cottage was got so grand, Aileen told us, and
Gracey had to dress a bit now. George had kept on making more money in every
way he tried it, and of course he began, bit by bit, to live according to his
means.</p>
<p>He'd bought cattle-stations on the Lachlan just when the gold broke out
first, and everybody thought station property was never going to be worth
nothing again. Now, since cattle had risen and meat and all to such a price, he
was making money hand over fist. More than that, as I said before, he'd been
made a magistrate, and all the swells began to take notice of him&mdash;not
altogether because he'd made money either; what I call the real swells, as far
as I see, won't do that. If they don't care for a man&mdash;no matter how much
money he's made&mdash;they hold shy of him. But if he's a straight-going good
sort of fellow, that has his head screwed on the right way, and don't push
himself forward too much, they'll meet him half-way, and a very good thing
too.</p>
<p>We could see George was going upwards and out of our lot, beginning to mix
with different people and get different notions&mdash;not but what he was
always kind and friendly in his way to Aileen and mother, and would have been
to us if he'd ever seen us. But all his new friends were different kind of
people, and after a bit, Aileen said, we'd only be remembered as people he'd
known when he was young, and soon, when the old lady died, we'd be asked into
the kitchen and not into the parlour. Aileen used to laugh when she talked like
this, and say she'd come and see George when he'd married a lady, and what fun
it would be to remind Gracey of the time they threshed the oats out together at
Rocky Flat. But still, laugh and all, I could see, though she talked that way,
it made her feel wretched all the while, because she couldn't help thinking
that we ought to have done just as well as George, and might have been
nigh-hand as far forward if we'd kept straight. If we'd only kept straight! Ah,
there was where the whole mistake lay.</p>
<p>It often seems to me as if men and women ought to have two lives&mdash;an
old one and a new one&mdash;one to repent of the other; the first one to show
men what they ought to keep clear of in the second. When you think how
foolish-like and childish man or woman commits their first fault, not so bad in
itself, but enough often to shut them out from nearly all their chances of good
in this world, it does seem hardish that one life should end all under the sun.
Of course, there's the other, and we don't know what's coming, but there's so
many different notions about that a chap like me gets puzzled, and looks on it
as out of his line altogether.</p>
<p>We weren't sorry to have a little excuse to stop quiet at home for this
month. We couldn't have done no good by mooching about, and ten to one, while
the chase was so hot after all that were supposed to have had a hand in rubbing
out Hagan and his lot, we should have been dropped upon. The whole country was
alive with scouting parties, as well as the regulars. You'd have thought the
end of the world was come. Father couldn't have done a better thing for himself
and all of us than get hit as he did. It kept him and us out of harm's way, and
put them off the scent, while they hunted Moran and Burke and the rest of their
lot for their lives. They could hardly get a bit of damper out of a shepherd's
hut without it being known to the police, and many a time they got off by the
skin of their teeth.</p>
<h2>Chapter 40</h2>
<p>At last father got well, and said he didn't see what good Aileen could do
stopping any longer in the Hollow, unless she meant to follow up bush-ranging
for a living. She'd better go back and stay along with her mother. If George
Storefield liked to have 'em there, well and good; things looked as if it
wasn't safe now for a man's wife and daughter, and if he'd got into trouble, to
live peaceable and quiet in their own house. He didn't think they need be
afraid of any one interfering with them for the future, though. Here dad looked
so dark that Aileen began to think he was going to be ill again. We'd all start
and go a bit of the way with her next day&mdash;to the old stockyard or a bit
farther; she could ride from there, and take the horse back with her and keep
him if she liked.</p>
<p>'You've been a good gal to me,' he says to her; 'you always was one; and
your mother's been a good woman and a good wife; tell her I said so. I'd no
call to have done the things I have, or left home because it wasn't tidy and
clean and a welcome always when I came back. It's been rough on her, and on you
too, my gal; and if it'll do her any good, tell her I'm dashed sorry. You can
take this trifle of money. You needn't boggle at it; it's honest got and
earned, long before this other racket. Now you can go. Kiss your old dad; like
as not you won't see him again.'</p>
<p>We'd got the horses in. I lifted her up on to the saddle, and she rode out.
Her horse was all on the square, so there was no harm in her taking him back
with her, and off we went. Dad didn't go after all. We took it easy out to the
old stockyard. We meant to camp there for half-an-hour, and then to send her
on, with Warrigal to keep with her and show her the way home.</p>
<p>We didn't want to make the time too short. What a lovely day it was! The
mountain sides were clogged up with mist for an hour after we started; still,
any one that knew the climate would have said it was going to be a fine day.
There wasn't a breath of air; everything was that still that not a leaf on any
of the trees so much as stirred.</p>
<p>When we came to the pass out of the valley, we none of us got off; it was
better going up than coming down, and it would have tired Aileen out at the
start to walk up. So the horses had to do their climbing. It didn't matter much
to them. We were all used to it, horses and riders. Jim and I went first, then
Warrigal, then Aileen and Starlight. After we got up to the top we all stopped
and halted a bit to look round.</p>
<p>Just then, as if he'd waited for us, the sun came out from behind the
mountain; the mists lifted and rolled away as if they had been gray curtains.
Everything showed clear out like a playhouse, the same Jim and I used to see in
Melbourne. From where we stood you could see everything, the green valley flats
with the big old trees in clumps, some of 'em just the same as they'd been
planted. The two little river-like silver threads winding away among the trees,
and far on the opposite side the tall gray rock-towers shining among the forest
edges of the high green wall. Somehow the sun wasn't risen enough to light up
the mountain. It looked as black and dismal as if it was nightfall coming
on.</p>
<p>'Good-bye, old Hollow!' Aileen called out, waving her hand. 'Everything
looks bright and beautiful except the mountain. How gloomy it appears, as if it
held some dreadful secret&mdash;doesn't it? Ah! what a pleasant time it has
been for me. Am I the same Aileen Marston that went in there a few weeks since?
And now I suppose there will be more misery and anxiety waiting for all of us
when I get back. Well, come what will, I have had a little happiness on this
earth. In heaven there must be rest.'</p>
<p>We all rode on, but none of us seemed to care to say much. Every step we
went seemed to be taking us away from the place where we'd all been so happy
together. The next change was sure to be for the worse. What it would be, or
when it would come, we none of us could tell.</p>
<p>Starlight and Aileen rode together most of the way, and talked a good deal,
we could see. Before we got to the stockyard she rode over to Jim and cheered
him up as much as she could about Jeanie. She said she'd write to her, and tell
her all about him, and how happy we'd all been together lately; and tell her
that Jim would find some way to get down to her this spring, if he could manage
it any road.</p>
<p>'If I'm above ground, tell her I'll be with her,' says poor old Jim, 'before
Christmas. If she don't see me then I'll be dead, and she may put on black and
make sure she's a widow.'</p>
<p>'Oh, come, you mustn't talk like that, Jim, and look to the bright side a
bit. There's a good chance yet, now the country's so full of diggers and
foreigners. You try your luck, and you'll see your wife yet.'</p>
<p>Then she came to me, and talked away just like old times.</p>
<p>'You're the eldest, Dick,' she said, 'and so it's proper for me to say what
I'm going to say.' Then she told me all that was in her heart about Starlight.
He and she had made it up that if he could get away to a foreign country she
would join him there, and take mother with her. There was to be no marrying or
love-making unless they could carry out that plan. Then she told me that she
had always had the same sort of feeling towards him. 'When I saw him first I
thought I had never seen a man before&mdash;never one that I could care for or
think of marrying. And now he has told me that he loves me&mdash;loves me, a
poor ignorant girl that I am; and I will wait for him all my life, and follow
him all round the world. I feel as if I could die for him, or wear out my life
in trying to make him happy. And yet, and yet,' she said, and all her face grew
sad, and put on the old look that I knew so well, so hopeless, so full of quiet
bearing of pain, 'I have a kind of feeling at my heart that it will never be.
Something will happen to me or to him. We are all doomed to sorrow and
misfortune, and nothing can save us from our fate.'</p>
<p>'Aileen, dear,' I said, 'you are old enough to know what's best for
yourself. I didn't think Starlight was on for marrying any woman, but he's far
and away the best man we've ever known, so you can please yourself. But you
know what the chances are. If he gets clear off, or any of us, after what's
been done, you're right. But it's a hundred to one against it.'</p>
<p>'I'll take the odds,' says she, holding up her head. 'I'm willing to put my
life and happiness, what little there's left of it, on the wager. Things can't
well be worse.'</p>
<p>'I don't know,' I said. 'I ought to tell you&mdash;I must tell you something
before we part, though I'd a deal rather not. But you'll bear it better now
than in a surprise.'</p>
<p>'Not more blood, more wickedness,' she said, in a half-whisper, and then she
looks up stern and angry-like. 'When is this list of horrible things to
stop?'</p>
<p>'It was none of our doing. Moran and Daly were in it, and&mdash;'</p>
<p>'And none of you? Swear that,' she said, so quick and pitiful-like.</p>
<p>'None of us,' I said again; 'nor yet Warrigal.'</p>
<p>'Then who did it? Tell me all. I'm not a child. I will know.'</p>
<p>'You remember the man that was rude to you at Rocky Flat, and father and he
fired at one another?'</p>
<p>'Of course I do, cowardly wretch that he was. Then Moran was waiting for
them up the gully? I wondered that they did not come back next day.'</p>
<p>'They never came back,' I said.</p>
<p>'Why, you don't mean to tell me that they are all dead, all
four?&mdash;those strong men! Oh, surely not, Dick?' and she caught hold of my
arm, and looked up into my face.</p>
<p>'Yes, Aileen, all. We came after and followed up dad, when we got home; it's
a wonder he did it by himself. But we saw them all four lying stretched
out.'</p>
<p>She put down her head and never spoke more till we parted.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>We turned back, miserable enough all of us, God knows. After having Aileen
to make the place bright and pleasant and cheer us all up losing her was just
as if all the little pleasure we had in our lives was dropped out of
them&mdash;like the sun going out of the sky, and the wind rising; like the
moon clouding over, and a fog burying up everything&mdash;dark and damp, the
same as we'd had it many a time cattle-driving by night. We hardly spoke a word
to one another all the way home, and no wonder.</p>
<p>Next day we all sat about, looking more down on our luck, dad said, than any
day since we'd 'turned out'. Then Starlight told him about him and Aileen, how
they'd made it up to be married some day or other. Not yet, of course; but if
he could get away by Melbourne to some of these places&mdash;the islands on the
Pacific coast, where vessels were always sailing for&mdash;he didn't see why
his luck shouldn't change. 'I have always thought your daughter,' he says to
father, 'one of the grandest women I ever met, in any degree, gentle or simple.
She has had the imprudence to care for me; so, unless you have some
well-grounded objection&mdash;and I don't say you haven't, mind you, I should
if I were in your place&mdash;you may as well say you're contented, and wish us
luck!'</p>
<p>Father was a long time before he said anything. He sat there, looking very
sullen and set-like, while Starlight lit a cigar and walked quietly up and down
a few paces off.</p>
<p>Dad answers at last. 'I don't say but what other lads would have suited
better if they'd come off, but most things goes contrary in this world. The
only thing as I'm doubtful of, Captain, is your luck. If that's bad, all the
trying and crying won't set it right. And it's great odds as you'll be caught
or shot afore the year's out. For that matter, every one of us is working for
Government on the same road. But the gal's a good gal, and if she's set her
fancy on you I won't block her. You're a pair of dashed fools, that's all,
botherin' your heads with the like at a time like this, when you boys are all
more likely to have a rope round your necks than any gal's arms, good or bad.
Have your own way. You always managed to get it, somehow or other, ever since I
knowed ye.'</p>
<p>After this father lit his pipe and went into the cave.</p>
<p>By and by he comes out again and catches the old mare.</p>
<p>'I ain't been out of this blessed hole,' he says, 'for a month of Sundays.
I'm dead tired of seeing nothin' and doin' nothin'. I'll crawl over to old
Davy's for our letters and papers. We ain't heard nothing for a year, seems to
me.'</p>
<p>Dad was strong enough to get about in the saddle again, and we weren't sorry
to get shut of him for a bit. He was that cranky at times there was no living
with him. As for ourselves, we were regular wild for some sort of get away for
a bit of a change; so we hadn't talked it over very long before we made up our
minds to take a run over to Jonathan Barnes's and have a bit of fun, just to
take the taste out of our mouths of Aileen's going away.</p>
<p>We had to dress ourselves very quiet and get fresh horses&mdash;nags that
had nothing particular about them to make people look, at the same time with a
bit of go in them in case we were pushed at any time.</p>
<p>No sooner said than done. We went to work and got everything ready, and by
three o'clock we were off&mdash;all three of us, and never in better heart in
our lives&mdash;for a bit of fun or devilment; it didn't matter which came
first.</p>
<p>When we got to Jonathan's it was latish, but that didn't matter to us or to
the girls neither; they were always ready for a bit of fun, night or day.
However, just at first they pretended to be rather high and mighty about this
business of Hagan's.</p>
<p>'Oh! it's you, is it?' says Bella, after we walked in. 'I don't know as it's
safe for us to be knowing such dangerous characters. There's a new law against
harbouring, father says. He's pretty frightened, I can tell you, and for two
pins we'd be told to shut the door in your faces.'</p>
<p>'You can do that if you like now,' says I; 'we shan't want telling twice, I
daresay. But what makes you so stiff to-night?'</p>
<p>'Why, Hagan's business, of course,' says Maddie; 'four men killed in cold
blood. Only I know you couldn't and wouldn't be in it I'd not know any of ye
from a crow. There now.'</p>
<p>'Quite right, most beauteous Madeline,' says Starlight; 'it was a very
dreadful affair, though I believe there was some reason for old Ben being
angry. Of course, you know we weren't within miles of the place when it was
done. You remember the night we were here last?'</p>
<p>'Of course we do, Captain, quite well. Weren't you going to dance at Bella's
wedding and all? You'll have to do that sooner than we expected, though.'</p>
<p>'Glad to hear it, but listen to me, my dear; I want you to know the truth.
We rode straight back to the&mdash;to where we lived&mdash;and, of course,
found the old man gone away from the place. We tracked him right enough, but
came up when it was all over. Daly and Moran were the chief actors in that
tragedy.'</p>
<p>'Oh, we said it was Moran's work from the first, didn't we, Bill? It's just
the line he's cut out for. I always think he ought to have a bowl and dagger.
He looks like the villain on the stage.'</p>
<p>'On or off the stage he can support the principal part in that line most
naturally,' says Starlight; 'but I prophesy he will be cut off in the midst of
his glorious career. He's beastly cunning, but he'll be trapped yet.'</p>
<p>'It's a pity Jim can't stay a few days with us,' says Maddie; 'I believe
we'd find a way of passing him on to Victoria. I've known more than one or two,
or half-a-dozen either, that has been put through the same way.'</p>
<p>'For God's sake, Mad, lay me on!' says poor Jim, 'and I'll go on my knees to
you.'</p>
<p>'Oh! I daresay,' says Maddie, looking saucy, 'but I like a man to be fond of
some woman in a proper way, even if it isn't me; so I'll do what I can to help
you to your wife and pickaninny.'</p>
<p>'We must get you into the police force, Maddie,' says Starlight, 'or make
you a sort of inspector, unattached, if you're so clever at managing these
little affairs. But what's the idea?'</p>
<p>'Well,' says she, settling herself in a chair, spreading out her dress, and
looking very knowing, 'there's an old gentleman being driven all the way
overland in a sort of light Yankee trap, and the young fellow that's driving
has to find horses and feed 'em, and get so much for the trip.'</p>
<p>'Who is it?' says I.</p>
<p>'Oh! you know him,' says Maddie, looking down, 'he's a great friend of mine,
a steady-going, good-conducted chap, and he's a little&mdash;you
understand&mdash;well, shook on me. I could persuade him a bit, that
is&mdash;'</p>
<p>'I don't doubt that at all,' says I.</p>
<p>'Oh! you know him a little. He says he saw you at the Turon; he was working
with some Americans. His name's Joe Moreton.'</p>
<p>'I remember him well enough; he used to wear a moustache and a chin beard,
and talk Yankee. Only for that he was a good deal like Jim; we always said
so.'</p>
<p>'Do you see anything now, Dick, you that's so sharp?' says Maddie.</p>
<p>'Bless my soul,' says Starlight, 'of course, it is as clear as your
beautiful eyes. Jim is to shave his beard, talk like a Yankee, and go in Joe
Moreton's place. I see it all. Maddie persuading Joe to consent to the exchange
of duties.'</p>
<p>'But what will his employer say?'</p>
<p>'Oh! he's as bad as bad can be with the sandy blight,' says Maddie, 'wears
green goggles, poor old gentleman. He'll never know nothing, and he'll be able
to swear up for Jim if the police pull him anywhere this side of the
Murray.'</p>
<p>We'd told Maddie that money needn't stand in the way, so she was to promise
Joe the full sum that he was to get for his contract would be paid to him in
cash that night&mdash;Jim to pay his own expenses as he went, the same as he
was to do himself. Of course she could get the money from old Jonathan. A word
from us then was worth a deal more than that'd come to. Money wasn't the worst
thing we had to care about.</p>
<p>They would have to change clothes, and he'd tell Jim about the horses, the
stages, and how to answer the old cove, and what to do to humour him as they
went along. If he'd had his full eyesight he might have noticed some
difference, but as it was, it was as much as the poor old chap, she believed,
could see there was a driver at all. His eyes was bound up mostly; he had a big
shade over 'em, and was half the night swabbing and poulticing, and putting
lotion into 'em. He'd got sandy blight that bad it would take months to get
right. Once you get a touch like that it's a terror, I can tell you. I've had
it that bad myself I had to be led about.</p>
<p>After a lot of talking, that Jim was to try his luck as the Rev. Mr.
Watson's coachman, he was mad to get away somehow, and such another chance
might never turn up in a month of Sundays. He would have plenty of time to
shave his beard and make himself look as like as ever he could to Joe Moreton.
Maddie said she'd see after that, and it would be as good as a play. Lucky for
old Jim we'd all taken a fancy at the Turon, for once in a way, to talk like
Arizona Bill and his mates, just for the fun of the thing. There were so many
Americans there at first, and they were such swells, with their silk sashes,
bowie knives, and broad-leafed 'full-share' hats, that lots of the young native
fellows took a pride in copying them, and could walk and talk and guess and
calculate wonderful well considering. Besides, most of the natives have a sort
of slow, sleepy way of talking, so it partly came natural to this chap, Joe
Moreton, and Jim. There couldn't be a better chance, so we thought we'd stay a
day and give Jim a send off all square and regular. It wasn't no ways too safe,
but we wanted a bit of a jollification and we thought we'd chance it.</p>
<p>That night we had a regular good ball. The girls got some of the young
fellows from round about to come over, and a couple or two other girls, and we
had no end of fun. There was plenty of champagne, and even Jim picked up a bit;
and what with being grateful to Maddie for giving him this lift, and better in
spirits on the chance of seeing Jeanie again, he was more like his own self.
Maddie said he looked so handsome she had half a mind to throw over Joe Moreton
after all.</p>
<p>Joe came rather latish, and the old gentleman had a cup of tea and went to
bed at once, leaving word for Joe that he wanted to start almost before
daylight, or as soon as he could see to drive, so as to get half-way on their
stage before the sun was hot.</p>
<p>After Joe had seen to his horses and put the trap away he came into the
house and had a glass or two, and wired in with the rest of us like a good 'un.
After a bit we see Maddie corner him off and have a long talk, very serious
too. After that they went for a walk in the garden and was away a good while.
When she came back she looked over at Jim and nodded, as much as to say, 'It's
all right,' and I saw poor old Jim's face brighten up as if a light had passed
over it.</p>
<p>By and by she came over and told us all about it. She'd had a hard matter to
manage it, for Joe was a square sort of fellow, that had a place of his own,
and at first didn't like the notion of being mixed up with our crowd at all.
But he was regular shook on Maddie, and she went at him as only a woman can,
and I daresay, though she didn't tell us, made it part of the bargain, if she
was to marry him, to help Jim in this particular way. He was to be well paid
for this journey by old Mr. Watson, and he wanted a bit of money before harvest
or he wouldn't have taken the job at all.</p>
<p>The end of it was that Jim and Joe sat up ever so late, pretty well on to
daylight, smoking and yarning, and Joe practising Jim in all the things he was
to do and say, giving him a kind of chart of the stages, and telling him the
sort of answers he was to give to the old chap. It was just before daylight
when they knocked off, and then Joe goes and peels off his duds and hands 'em
over to Jim, rough great-coat and all&mdash;up to his chin and down to his
toes.</p>
<p>Joe takes Jim's togs. They fitted him all to pieces, and Jim hands him over
his horse, saddle, revolver, and spurs, and tells him the old horse is a real
plum, and he hopes he'll be good to him. Then Jim shakes hands with us all
round. Blessed if the girls wasn't up too, and had some coffee smoking hot for
us. 'We can sleep when you're all gone,' says Maddie, 'and perhaps we shan't
see old Jim any more' (this was said when Joe was out of the room), 'so here's
good luck; and when you've got your wife and child again don't forget Maddie
Barnes.' Then she shook hands with him, and made a quick bolt to her own room.
Queer things women are, my word.</p>
<p>When old Jim drove round to the front with the pair of horses, setting up
square with his big coat and Joe's 'full-share' hat on him, we all bursted out
laughing. He'd first of all gone to the old gentleman's room and sung out, 'All
aboard, sir, time's up,' just to liven him up a bit. Joe kept away down at the
stable.</p>
<p>Well, presently out comes the old chap, with a veil on and his green
goggles, winkin' and blinkin' as if he couldn't see a door from a window. He
drinks off a cup of coffee and takes a munch of bread and butter, makes a kind
of bow to Bella, and shuffles into his carriage. Jim touches up the horses and
away they go. We rose a bit of a cheer. Maddie waved her handkerchief out of
the window. Jim looked round and raised his whip. That was the last sight any
of us had of him for many a day. Poor old Jim!</p>
<h2>Chapter 41</h2>
<p>We hadn't been long at home, just enough to get tired of doing nothing, when
we got a letter from Bella Barnes, telling us that she was going to get married
the day after the Turon races, and reminding Starlight that he had promised to
come to her wedding. If he didn't think it was too risky, she hoped he'd come.
There was going to be a race ball, and it was sure to be good fun. It would be
a good wind-up, and Maddie was coming out a great swell. Sir Ferdinand would be
there, but there'd be such a crowd anybody would pass muster, and so on.</p>
<p>'Yours sincerely,<br>
'Isabella Barnes.</p>
<p>'P.S.&mdash;There was a big handicap, with &pound;500 added; hadn't we a
good horse enough?'</p>
<p>'Well done, Bella!' says Starlight. 'I vote we go, Dick. I never went to a
hop with a price on my head before. A thousand pounds too! Quite a new
sensation. It settles the question. And we'll enter Rainbow for the handicap.
He ought to be good enough for anything they're likely to have.'</p>
<p>'Captain Starlight's Rainbow, 9 st. 8 lb.,' I said, 'with Dick Marston to
lead him up to the judge's box. How will that wash? And what are the police
going to be about all the time? Bella's gone out of her senses about her
marriage and thinks we are too.'</p>
<p>'You're a good fellow, Richard, and stanch, but you're like your
father&mdash;you haven't any imagination. I see half-a-dozen ways of doing the
whole thing. Besides, our honour's concerned. I never made a promise yet, for
good or for evil, that I didn't carry out, and some have cost me dearly enough,
God knows. Fancy running our horses and going to the ball under the noses of
the police&mdash;the idea is delicious!'</p>
<p>'I daresay you're about tired of your life,' I said. 'I'm pretty sure I am;
but why we should ride straight into the lion's mouth, to please a silly girl,
I can't see. I haven't over much sense, I know, or I shouldn't be here; but I'm
not such a dashed fool as all that comes to.'</p>
<p>'My mind is made up, Richard&mdash;I have decided irrevocably. Of course,
you needn't come, if you see objections; but I'll bet you my Dean and Adams
revolver and the Navy Colt against your repeating rifle that I do all I've
said, and clear out safe.'</p>
<p>'Done!' I said. 'I've no doubt you'll try; but you might as well try to pull
down the walls of Berrima Gaol with a hay-rake. You'll make Sir Ferdinand's
fortune, that's all. He always said he'd die happy if he could only bag you and
the Marstons. He'll be made Inspector-General of Police.'</p>
<p>Starlight smiled in his queer, quiet way.</p>
<p>'If he doesn't rise to the top of the tree until he takes me&mdash;alive, I
mean&mdash;he'll die a sub-inspector. But we'd better sleep on it. This is an
enterprise of great pith and moment, and requires no end of thought. We must
get your sister to come over. That will crown all.'</p>
<p>'Good-night,' I said, rather hasty. 'We'd better turn the Hollow into Tarban
Creek, and advertise for boarders.'</p>
<p>Next morning I expected he'd think better of it&mdash;we'd had a glass or
two of grog; but no, he was more set on it than ever, and full of dodges to
work it to rights. He certainly was wonderful clever in all sorts of ways when
there was any devilment to be carried out. Half as much in the straight way
would have made a man of him. But that's the way of the world all over. He
ain't the only one.</p>
<p>As for father, he was like me, and looked on the notion as rank foolishness.
He swore straight on end for about twenty minutes, and then said he expected
Starlight would have his own way as usual; but he'd play at that game once too
often. He supposed he'd be left in the Hollow all by himself, with Warrigal and
the dog for company.</p>
<p>'Warrigal goes with me&mdash;might want him,' says Starlight. 'You're losing
your nerve, governor. Perhaps you'd like to go to the ball too?'</p>
<p>Father gave a sort of growl, and lit his pipe and wouldn't say no more.
Starlight and I regular talked it out, and, after I'd heard all he had to say,
it didn't look quite so impossible as it did at first. We were to work apart.
He was to get in with some of the betting men or sporting people that always
came to country races, and I was to find out some of our old digger mates and
box up with them. Warrigal would shift for himself and look after the horses,
and have them ready in case we had to clear at short notice.</p>
<p>'And who was to enter Rainbow and look after him?'</p>
<p>'Couldn't we get old Jacob Benton; he's the best trainer I've seen since I
left home? Billy the Boy told us the other day he was out of a job, and was
groom at Jonathan's; had been sacked for getting drunk, and so on. He'll be all
the more likely to keep sober for a month.'</p>
<p>'The very man,' I said. 'He can ride the weight, and train too. But we can't
have him here, surely!'</p>
<p>'No; but I can send the horse to him at Jonathan's, and he can get him fit
there as well as anywhere. There's nearly a month yet; he's pretty hard, and
he's been regularly exercised lately.'</p>
<p>Jacob Benton was a wizened, dried-up old Yorkshireman. He'd been head man in
a good racing stable, but drink had been the ruin of him&mdash;lost him his
place, and sent him out here. He could be trusted to go right through with a
job like ours, for all that. Like many men that drink hard, he was as sober as
a judge between one burst and another. And once he took over a horse in
training he touched nothing but water till the race was run and the horse back
in his box. Then he most times went in an awful perisher&mdash;took a month to
it, and was never sober day or night the whole time. When he'd spent all his
money he'd crawl out of the township and get away into the country more dead
than alive, and take the first job that offered. But he was fonder of training
a good horse than anything else in the world; and if he'd got a regular flyer,
and was treated liberal, he'd hardly allow himself sleep or time to eat his
meals till he'd got him near the mark. He could ride, too, and was an
out-and-out judge of pace.</p>
<p>When we'd regular chalked it out about entering Rainbow for the Grand Turon
Handicap, we sent Warrigal over to Billy the Boy, and got him to look up old
Jacob. He agreed to take the old horse, the week before the races, and give him
a last bit of French-polish if we'd keep him in steady work till then. From
what he was told of the horse he expected he would carry any weight he was
handicapped for and pull it off easy. He was to enter him in his own name, the
proper time before the races. If he won he was to have ten per cent on
winnings; if he lost, a ten-pound note would do him. He could ride the weight
with some lead in his saddle, and he'd never wet his lips with grog till the
race was over.</p>
<p>So that part of the work was chalked out. The real risky business was to
come. I never expected we should get through all straight. But the more I hung
back the more shook on it Starlight seemed to be. He was like a boy home from
school sometimes&mdash;mad for any kind of fun with a spice of devilment in
it.</p>
<p>About a week before the races we all cleared out, leaving father at home,
and pretty sulky too. Warrigal led Rainbow; he was to take him to Jonathan
Barnes's, and meet old Jacob there. He was to keep him until it was time to go
to Turon. We didn't show there ourselves this time; we were afraid of drawing
suspicion on the place.</p>
<p>We rode right into Turon, taking care to be well after dark. A real pleasure
it was to see the old place again. The crooked streets, the lighted-up shops,
the crowd of jolly diggers walking about smoking, or crowding round the
public-house bars, the row of the stampers in the quartz-crushing machines
going night and day. It all reminded me of the pleasant year Jim and I had
spent here. I wished we'd never had to leave it. We parted just outside the
township for fear of accidents. I went to a little place I knew, where I put up
my horse&mdash;could be quiet there, and asked no questions. Starlight, as
usual, went to the best hotel, where he ordered everybody about and was as big
a swell as ever. He had been out in the north-west country, and was going to
Sydney to close for a couple of stations that had been offered to him.</p>
<p>That night he went to the barber, had his hair cut and his beard shaved,
only leaving his moustache and a bit of whisker like a ribbon. He put on a suit
of tweed, all one colour, and ordered a lot more clothes, which he paid for,
and were to be left at the hotel till he returned from Sydney.</p>
<p>Next day he starts for Sydney; what he was going to do there he didn't say,
and I didn't ask him. He'd be back the day before the races, and in good time
for all the fun, and Bella's wedding into the bargain. I managed to find out
that night that Kate Mullockson had left Turon. She and her husband had sold
their place and gone to another diggings just opened. I was glad enough of
this, for I knew that her eyes were sharp enough to spy me out whatever
disguise I had on; and even if she didn't I should always have expected to find
her eyes fixed upon me. I breathed freer after I heard this bit of news.</p>
<p>The gold was better even than when we were there. A lot of men who were poor
enough when we were there had made fortunes. The field never looked better, and
the hard-driving, well-paid, jolly mining life was going on just the same as
ever; every one making money fast&mdash;spending it faster&mdash;and no one
troubling themselves about anything except how much the washdirt went to the
load, and whether the sinking was through the false bottom or not.</p>
<p>When I first came I had a notion of mating in with some diggers, but when I
saw how quiet everybody took it, and what thousands of strangers there were all
over the place, I gave myself out for a speculator in mining shares from
Melbourne. So I shaved off most of my beard, had my hair cut short, and put on
a tall hat. I thought that would shift any sort of likeness there might be to
my old self, and, though it was beastly uncomfortable, I stuck to it all the
time.</p>
<p>I walked about among the stables and had a good look at all the horses that
were in training. Two or three good ones, as usual, and a lot of duffers. If
Rainbow wasn't beat on his condition, he had pace and weight-carrying for the
best of them. I hardly thought he could lose it, or a bigger stake in better
company. I was that fond of the horse I thought he was good enough for an
English Derby.</p>
<p>Well, I kept dark, you be sure, and mooned about, buying a share at a low
price now and then just to let 'em see I had money and meant something. My name
was Mr. Bromford, and I lived at Petersham, near Sydney.</p>
<p>The day before the races there was a lot of excitement in the town.
Strangers kept pouring in from everywhere round about, and all the hotels were
crammed full. Just as I was wondering whether Starlight was going to turn up
till next day I saw a four-in-hand drag rattle down the street to the principal
inn, and a crowd gather round it as three gentlemen got out and went into the
inn.</p>
<p>'You'll see after all our luggage, will you, ostler?' says one of them to
the groom, 'and whatever you do don't forget my umbwella!'</p>
<p>Some of the diggers laughed.</p>
<p>'Know those coves?' I said to a man that stopped at the same house as I
did.</p>
<p>'Don't you know? Them's the two Mr. Dawsons, of Wideview, great sporting
men, natives, and ever so rich. They've some horses to run to-morrow. That's a
new chum from England that's come up with 'em.'</p>
<p>I hardly knew him at first. His own mother wouldn't, I believe. He'd altered
himself that wonderful as I could hardly even now think it was Starlight; and
yet he wasn't a bit like the young Englishman he gammoned to be last year, or
the Hon. Frank Haughton either. He had an eyeglass this time, and was a swell
from top to toe. How and when he'd picked up with the Mr. Dawsons I couldn't
tell; but he'd got a knack of making people like him&mdash;especially when they
didn't know him. Not that it was worse when they did. It wasn't for that. He
was always the same. The whitest man I ever knew, or ever shall&mdash;that I
say and stick to&mdash;but of course people can't be expected to associate with
men that have 'done time'. Well, next day was the races. I never saw such a
turn-out in the colony before. Every digger on the field had dropped work for
the day; all the farmers, and squatters, and country people had come in for
miles round on all sides. The Commissioner and all the police were out in full
uniform, and from the first moment the hotels were opened in the morning till
breakfast time all the bars were full, and the streets crowded with miners and
strangers and people that seemed to have come from the ends of the earth. When
I saw the mob there was I didn't see so much to be jerran about, as it was
fifty to one in favour of any one that was wanted, in the middle of such a
muster of queer cattle as was going on at Turon that day.</p>
<p>About eleven o'clock every one went out to the course. It wasn't more than a
mile from town. The first race wasn't to be run till twelve; but long before
that time the road was covered with horsemen, traps of every kind and sort,
every horse and mare in the whole district.</p>
<p>Most of the miners went in four-horse coaches and 'buses that were plying
all day long from the town and back; very few walked. The country people mostly
drove in spring-carts, or rode on horseback. Any young fellows that had a good
horse liked to show him off, of course; the girls in habits of their own make,
perhaps, and now and then a top hat, though they looked very well too. They
could ride, some of them, above a bit, and it made me think of the old days
when Jim and I and Aileen used to ride into Bargo races together, and how proud
we were of her, even when she was a little thing, and we used to groom up the
old pony till we nearly scrubbed the hide off him.</p>
<p>It was no use thinking of that kind of thing, and I began to wonder how
Starlight was getting on with his friends, when I saw the Dawsons' drag come up
the straight, with four upstanding ripping bay horses in top condition, and
well matched. There was Starlight on the box seat, alongside of Jack Dawson,
the eldest brother, who could handle the ribbons in style, and was a man every
inch of him, only a bit too fast; didn't care about anything but horses and
dogs, and lived every day of his life. The other brother was standing up
behind, leaning over and talking to Starlight, who was 'in great form', as he
used to say himself, and looked as if he'd just come out of a bandbox.</p>
<p>He had on a silk coat buttoned round him, a white top hat with a blue silk
veil. His eyeglass was stuck in his eye all the time, and he had kid gloves on
that fitted his hands like wax. I really couldn't hardly take my oath he was
the same man, and no wonder nobody else couldn't. I was wondering why Sir
Ferdinand wasn't swelling about, bowing to all the ladies, and making that
thoroughbred of his dance and arch his neck, when I heard some one say that
he'd got news that Moran and the rest of 'em had stuck up a place about forty
miles off, towards Forbes, and Sir Ferdinand had sworn at his luck for having
to miss the races; but started off just as he was, and taken all the troopers
but two with him.</p>
<p>'Who brought the news?'</p>
<p>'Oh! a youngster called William Jones&mdash;said he lived out there. A black
boy came with him that couldn't hardly speak English; he went with 'em to show
the way.'</p>
<p>'Well, but how did they know it was true?' says I. 'It might have been only
a stall.'</p>
<p>'Oh, the young fellow brought a letter from the overseer, saying they might
hold out for a few hours, if the police came along quick.'</p>
<p>'It's a good thing they started at once,' says I. 'Them boys are very useful
sometimes, and blackfellows too.'</p>
<p>I went off then, and had a laugh to myself. I was pretty middling certain it
was Billy the Boy and Warrigal. Starlight had wrote the note before we started,
only I didn't think they'd be game to deliver it themselves.</p>
<p>Now the police was away, all but a couple of young fellows&mdash;I went and
had a look to make sure&mdash;that didn't know any of us by sight, I thought we
might enjoy ourselves for once in a way without watching every one that came
nigh us. And we did enjoy ourselves. I did, I know; though you'd think, as we
carried our lives in our hands, in a manner of speaking, the fun couldn't have
been much. But it's a queer world! Men like us, that don't know what's to
happen to them from one day to another, if they can only see their way for a
week ahead, often have more real pleasure in the bit of time they have to
themselves than many a man has in a year that has no call to care about time or
money or be afraid of anybody.</p>
<p>As for Starlight, if he'd been going to be hung next week it would have been
all one to him. He'd have put off thinking about it until about an hour before,
and then would have made all his arrangements and done the whole business
quietly and respectably, without humbug, but without any flashness either. You
couldn't put him wrong, or make him do or say anything that was out of
place.</p>
<p>However, this time nobody was going to be hung or took or anything else.
We'd as good as got a free pardon for the time being, now the police was away;
no one else would have meddled with us if we'd had our names printed on our
hats. So we made the most of it, I expect. Starlight carried on all sorts of
high ropes. He was introduced to all the nobs, and I saw him in the grand stand
and the saddling-paddock, taking the odds in tens and fifties from the
ringmen&mdash;he'd brought a stiffish roll of notes with him&mdash;and backing
the Dawson stable right out.</p>
<p>It turned out afterwards that he'd met them at an inn on the mountains, and
helped them to doctor one of their leaders that had been griped. So they took a
fancy to him, and, being free-hearted sort of fellows, asked him to keep them
company in the drag, and let one of the grooms ride his horse. Once he started
he kept them alive, you may be sure, and by the time they got to Turon they
were ready to go round the world with him, and swore they'd never met such a
man in their lives&mdash;very likely they hadn't, either. He was introduced to
the judge and the stewards and the Commissioner and the police magistrate, and
as much fuss made over him as if he was the Governor's son. It was as good as a
play. I got up as near as I dared once or twice, and I couldn't hardly keep
from bursting out laughing when I saw how grave he talked and drawled and put
up his eyeglass, and every now and then made 'em all laugh, or said something
reminded him of India, where he'd last come from.</p>
<p>Well, that was a regular fizzer of a spree, if we never had another. The
racing was very fair, and, as luck would have it, the Dawson horses won all the
big money, and, as they started at longish odds, they must have made a pot of
money, and Starlight too, as he'd gone in a docker for their stable. This made
them better friends than ever, and it was Dawson here and Lascelles there all
over the course.</p>
<p>Well, the day went over at last, and all of them that liked a little fun and
dancing better than heavy drinking made it up to go to the race ball. It was a
subscription affair&mdash;guinea tickets, just to keep out the regular roughs,
and the proceeds to go to the Turon Jockey Club Fund. All the swells had to go,
of course, and, though they knew it would be a crush and pretty mixed, as I
heard Starlight say, the room was large, the band was good, and they expected
to get a fair share of dancing after an hour or so.</p>
<p>Starlight and the Dawsons dined at the camp, and were made a good deal
of&mdash;their health drunk and what not&mdash;and Starlight told us afterwards
he returned thanks for the strangers and visitors; said he'd been told
Australia was a rough place, but he never expected to find so much genuine
kindness and hospitality and, he might add, so much refinement and gentlemanly
feeling. Speaking for himself, he had never expected, considering his being a
total stranger, to be welcomed so cordially and entertained so handsomely, more
particularly at the mess of her Majesty's goldfields officials, whose attention
on this occasion they might be assured he would never forget. He would repeat,
the events of this particular day would never be effaced from his memory.
(Tremendous cheering.)</p>
<p>After dinner, and when the champagne had gone round pretty reasonable, the
Commissioner proposed they should all adjourn to the ball, when, if Mr.
Lascelles cared about dancing, he ventured to think a partner or two could be
found for him. So they all got up and went away down to the hall of the
Mechanics' Institute&mdash;a tremendous big room that had been built to use as
a theatre, and to give lectures and concerts in. These sort of things are very
popular at diggings. Miners like to be amused, and have plenty of money to
spend when times are good. There was hardly a week passed without some kind of
show being on when we went there.</p>
<p>I walked down quietly an hour or so before most of the people, so as to be
in the way to see if Aileen came. We'd asked her to come on the chance of
meeting us there, but we hadn't got any word, and didn't know whether she could
manage it nor whether George would bring her. I had a sort of half-and-half
notion that perhaps Gracey might come, but I didn't like to think of it for
fear of being disappointed, and tried to make believe I didn't expect her.</p>
<p>I gave in my ticket and walked in about eight o'clock, and sat down pretty
close to the door so that I could see the people as they came in. I didn't feel
much up to dancing myself, but I'd have ridden a thousand miles to have had the
chance of seeing those two girls that night.</p>
<p>I waited and waited while one after another came in, till the big hall was
pretty near filled, and at nine o'clock or so the music struck up, and the
first dance began. That left the seats pretty bare, and between listening to
the music and looking at the people, and thinking I was back again at the old
claim and passing half-an-hour at a dance-house, I didn't mind the door so much
till I heard somebody give a sort of sigh not very far off, and I looked
towards the door and saw two women sitting between me and it.</p>
<p>They were Aileen and Gracey sure enough. My head almost turned round, and I
felt my heart beat&mdash;beat in a way it never did when the bullets were
singing and whistling all about. It was the suddenness of it, I expect. I
looked at them for a bit. They didn't see me, and were just looking about them
as I did. They were dressed very quiet, but Gracey had a little more ornament
on her, and a necklace or something round her neck. Aileen was very pale, but
her beautiful dark hair was dressed up a bit with one rosebud in it, and her
eyes looked bigger and brighter than they used to do. She looked sad enough,
but every now and then Gracey said something that made her smile a bit, and
then I thought she was the handsomest girl in the room. Gracey had just the
same steady, serious, kind face as ever; she'd hardly changed a bit, and seemed
pleased, just like a child at the play, with all that was going on round
about.</p>
<p>There was hardly anybody near the corner where they were, so I got up and
went over. They both looked at me for a minute as if they'd never seen me
before, and then Aileen turned as pale as death, and Gracey got altogether as
red, and both held out their hands. I sat down by the side of Aileen, and we
all began to talk. Not much at first, and very quiet, for fear notice might be
taken, but I managed to let them know that the police had all been called off
in another direction, and that we should be most likely safe till to-morrow or
next day.</p>
<p>'Oh dear!' says Gracey, 'wasn't it awfully rash of you to come here and run
all this risk just to come to Bella Barnes's wedding? I believe I ought to be
jealous of that girl.'</p>
<p>'All Starlight's fault,' I said; 'but anyhow, it's through him we've had
this meeting here. I was dead against coming all the time, and I never expected
things to turn out so lucky as they have done.'</p>
<p>'Will he be here to-night?' Aileen says, very soft and timid like. 'I almost
wished I'd stayed away, but Gracey here would come. Young Cyrus Williams
brought us. He wanted to show his wife the races, and take her to the ball.
There they are, dancing together. George is away at the races.'</p>
<p>'You will see Starlight about ten or eleven o'clock, I expect,' I said.
'He's dining with the Commissioner and the camp officers. They'll all come
together, most likely.'</p>
<p>'Dining at the camp!' says Aileen, looking regularly perished. 'You don't
mean to say they've taken him?'</p>
<p>'I mean what I say. He's here with the Mr. Dawsons, of Wideview, and has
been hand-and-glove with all the swells. I hardly think you'll know him. It's
as much as I did.'</p>
<p>Poor Aileen gave another sigh.</p>
<p>'Do you think he'll know me?' she says. 'Oh! what a foolish girl I was to
think for a moment that he could care about a girl like me. Oh! I wish I had
never come.'</p>
<p>'Nonsense,' says Gracey, who looked a deal brighter on it. 'Why, if he's the
man you say he is, this will only bring him out a bit. What do you think,
Di&mdash;I mean Mr. Jones?'</p>
<p>'That's right, Miss Storefield,' says I. 'Keep to the company manners
to-night. We don't know who may be listening; but I'm not much afraid of being
bowled out this particular night. Somehow I feel ready to chance everything for
an hour's happiness like this.'</p>
<p>Gracey said nothing, but looked down, and Aileen kept turning towards the
door as if she half hoped and was half afraid of seeing him come in. By and by
we heard some one say, 'Here comes the Commissioner; all the camp will be here
now,' and there was a bit of a move to look at them as they came in.</p>
<h2>Chapter 42</h2>
<p>A good many gentlemen and ladies that lived in the town and in the diggings,
or near it, had come before this and had been dancing away and enjoying
themselves, though the room was pretty full of diggers and all sorts of people.
But as everybody was quiet and well behaved, it didn't make much odds who was
there.</p>
<p>But, of course, the Commissioner was the great man of the whole place, and
the principal visitors, like the Mr. Dawsons and some others, were bound to
come along with him. Then there were the other Government officers, the bankers
and surveyors, lawyers and doctors, and so on. All of them took care to come a
little late with their wives and families so as to be in the room at the same
time as the swell lot.</p>
<p>Bella Barnes was going to marry a surveyor, a wildish young fellow, but a
good one to work as ever was. She was going to chance his coming straight
afterwards. He was a likely man to rise in his office, and she thought she'd
find a way to keep him out of debt and drinking and gambling too.</p>
<p>Well, in comes the Commissioner and his friends, very grand indeed, all
dressed like swells always do in the evening, I believe, black all over, white
tie, shining boots, white kid gloves, flower in their buttonhole, all regular.
People may laugh, but they did look different from the others&mdash;showed more
blood like. I don't care what they say, there is such a thing.</p>
<p>Close by the Commissioner, laughing and talking, was the two Mr. Dawsons;
and&mdash;I saw Aileen give a start&mdash;who should come next, cheek by jowl
with the police magistrate, whom he'd been making laugh with something he'd
said as they came in, but Starlight himself, looking like a regular
prince&mdash;their pictures anyhow&mdash;and togged out to the nines like all
the rest of 'em. Aileen kept looking at him as he lounged up the ballroom, and
I thought she'd fall down in a faint or bring herself to people's notice by the
wild, earnest, sad way she looked at him. However he'd got his clothes and the
rest of it that fitted him like as if they'd been grown for him, I couldn't
think. But of course he'd made all that right when he went to Sydney, and had
'em sent up with his luggage in Mr. Dawson's drag.</p>
<p>Though he didn't seem to notice anything, I saw that he knew us. He looked
round for a moment, and smiled at Aileen.</p>
<p>'That's a pretty girl,' he said to one of the young fellows; 'evidently from
the country. I must get introduced to her.'</p>
<p>'Oh, we'll introduce you,' says the other man. 'They're not half bad fun,
these bush girls, some of them.'</p>
<p>Well, a new dance was struck up by the band just after they'd got up to the
top of the room, and we saw Starlight taken up and introduced to a grand lady,
the wife of the head banker. The Commissioner and some of the other big wigs
danced in the same quadrille. We all moved a bit higher to get a good look at
him. His make-up was wonderful. We could hardly believe our eyes. His hair was
a deal shorter than he ever wore it (except in one place), and he'd shaved
nearly all but his moustache. That was dark brown and heavy. You couldn't see
his mouth except when he smiled, and then his teeth were as white as Warrigal's
nearly and as regular. There was a softness, too, about his eyes when he was in
a good temper and enjoying himself that I hardly ever saw in a man's face. I
could see Aileen watching him when he talked to this lady and that, and
sometimes she looked as if she didn't enjoy it.</p>
<p>He was only waiting his chance, though, for after he'd had a dance or two we
saw him go up to one of the stewards. They had big rosettes on, and presently
they walked round to us, and the steward asked the favour of Aileen's name, and
then begged, by virtue of his office, to present Lieutenant Lascelles, a
gentleman lately from India, who had expressed a wish to be introduced to her.
Such a bow Starlight made, too. We could hardly help staring. Poor Aileen
hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry when he sat down beside her and asked
for the pleasure of a dance.</p>
<p>She wouldn't do that. She only came there to see him, she said, and me; but
he persuaded her to walk round the room, and then they slipped into one of the
supper-rooms, where they were able to talk without being disturbed, and say
what they had in their hearts. I got Gracey to take a turn with me, and we were
able to have our little say. She was, like Aileen, miserable enough and afraid
to think of our ever having the chance of getting married and living happy like
other people, but she told me she would wait and remain faithful to me&mdash;if
it was to her life's end&mdash;and that as soon as I could get away from the
country and promise her to leave our wild lives behind she was ready to join us
and follow me all over the world. Over and over again she tried to persuade me
to get away like Jim, and said how happy he was now, and how much better it was
than stopping where we were, and running terrible risks every day and every
hour. It was the old story over again; but I felt better for it, and really
meant to try and cut loose from all this cross work. We hadn't too much time.
Aileen was fetched back to her seat, and then Starlight went off to his friends
at the other end of the room, and was chaffed for flirting with a regular
currency lass by one of the Dawsons.</p>
<p>'I admire his taste,' says the Commissioner. 'I really think she's the
prettiest girl in the room if she was well dressed and had a little more
animation. I wonder who she is? What's her name, Lascelles? I suppose you know
all about her by this time.'</p>
<p>'Her name is Martin, or Marston, or some such name,' answered Starlight,
quite cool and pleasant. 'Deuced nice, sensible girl, painfully quiet, though.
Wouldn't dance, though, at all, and talked very little.'</p>
<p>'By Jove! I know who she is,' says one of the young chaps. 'That's Aileen
Marston, sister to Dick and Jim. No wonder she isn't over lively. Why, she has
two brothers bush-rangers, regular out-and-outers. There's a thousand on each
of their heads.'</p>
<p>'Good gad!' says Starlight, 'you don't say so! Poor girl! What a most
extraordinary country! You meet with surpwises every day, don't you?'</p>
<p>'It's a pity Sir Ferdinand isn't here,' said the Commissioner. 'I believe
she's an acquaintance of his. I've always heard she was a splendid girl,
though, poor thing, frets to death about her family. I think you seem to have
cheered her up, though, Lascelles. She doesn't look half so miserable as she
did an hour ago.'</p>
<p>'Naturally, my dear fellow,' says Starlight, pulling his moustache; 'even in
this savage country&mdash;beg your pardon&mdash;one's old form seems to be
appreciated. Pardon me, I must regain my partner; I am engaged for this
dance.'</p>
<p>'You seem disposed to make the most of your opportunities,' says the
Commissioner. 'Dawson, you'll have to look after your friend. Who's the
enslaver now?'</p>
<p>'I didn't quite catch her name,' says Starlight lazily; 'but it's that tall
girl near the pillar, with the pale face and dark eyes.'</p>
<p>'You're not a bad judge for a new chum,' says one of the goldfield subs.
'Why, that's Maddie Barnes. I think she's the pick of all the down-the-river
girls, and the best dancer here, out-and-out. Her sister's to be married
to-morrow, and we're all going to see her turned off.'</p>
<p>'Really, now?' says Starlight, putting up his eyeglass. 'I begin to think I
must write a book. I'm falling upon adventures hourly. Oh, the
"Morgen-blatter". What a treat! Can she valse, do you think?'</p>
<p>'You try her,' says the young fellow. 'She's a regular stunner.'</p>
<p>It was a fine, large room, and the band, mostly Germans, struck up some
outlandish queer sort of tune that I'd never heard anything like before;
whatever it was it seemed to suit most of the dancing people, for the floor was
pretty soon full up, and everybody twisting round and round as if they were
never going to stop. But, to my mind, there was not a couple there that was a
patch on Maddie and Starlight. He seemed to move round twice as light and easy
as any one else; he looked somehow different from all the others. As for
Maddie, wherever she picked it up she went like a bird, with a free, springy
sort of sliding step, and all in time to the music, anybody could see. After a
bit some of the people sat down, and I could hear them passing their remarks
and admiring both of 'em till the music stopped. I couldn't make out whether
Aileen altogether liked it or not; anyhow she didn't say anything.</p>
<p>About an hour afterwards the camp party left the room, and took Starlight
with them. Some one said there was a little loo and hazard at the
Commissioner's rooms. Cyrus Williams was not in a hurry to go home, or his
young wife either, so I stayed and walked about with the two girls, and we had
ever so much talk together, and enjoyed ourselves for once in a quiet way. A
good crowd was sure to be at Bella Barnes's wedding next day. It was fixed for
two o'clock, so as not to interfere with the races. The big handicap was to be
run at three, so we should be able to be at the church when Bella was turned
off, and see Rainbow go for the great race of the day afterwards. When that was
run we intended to clear. It would be time for us to go then. Things were
middling straight, but it mightn't last.</p>
<p>Next day was the great excitement of the meeting. The 'big money' was all in
the handicap, and there was a big field, with two or three cracks up from
Sydney, and a very good local horse that all the diggers were sweet on. It was
an open race, and every man that had a note or a fiver laid it out on one horse
or another.</p>
<p>Rainbow had been entered in proper time and all regular by old Jacob, under
the name of Darkie, which suited in all ways. He was a dark horse, sure enough;
dark in colour, and dark enough as to his performances&mdash;nobody knew much
about them. We weren't going to enter him in his right name, of course.</p>
<p>Old Jacob was a queer old fellow in all his ways and notions, so we couldn't
stable him in any of the stables in Turon, for fear of his being 'got at', or
something. So when I wanted to see him the day before, the old fellow grinned,
and took me away about a mile from the course; and there was old Rainbow, snug
enough&mdash;in a tent, above all places!&mdash;but as fine as a star, and as
fit as ever a horse was brought to the post.</p>
<p>'What's the fun of having him under canvas?' I said. 'Who ever heard of a
horse being trained in a tent before?&mdash;not but what he looks
first-chop.'</p>
<p>'I've seen horses trained in more ways than one,' says he, 'and I can wind
'em up, in the stable and out of it, as mighty few in this country
can&mdash;that is, when I put the muzzle on. There's a deal in knowing the way
horses is brought up. Now this here's an excitable hoss in a crowd.'</p>
<p>'Is he?' I said. 'Why, he's as cool and steady as an old trooper
when&mdash;'</p>
<p>'When powder's burning and bullets is flying,' says the old chap, grinning
again; 'but this here's a different crowd. When he's got a training saddle and
seven or eight stone up, and there's two or three hundred horses rattling about
this side on him and that, it brings out the old racehorse feeling that's in
his blood, and never had a chance to show itself afore.'</p>
<p>'I see, and so you want to keep him quiet till the last minute?'</p>
<p>'That's just it,' says he; 'I've got the time to a second'&mdash;here he
pulls out a big old turnip of a silver watch&mdash;'and I'll have him up just
ready to be weighed out last. I never was late in my life.'</p>
<p>'All right,' I said, 'but don't draw it too fine. Have you got your weight
all right?'</p>
<p>'Right to a hounce,' says he, 'nine stun four they've put on him, and him an
untried horse. I told 'em it was weighting him out of the race, but they
laughed at me. Never you mind, though, he can carry weight and stay too. My ten
per cent's as safe as the bank. He'll put the stuns on all them nobs, too, that
think a racehorse must always come out of one of their training stables.'</p>
<p>'Well, good-bye, old man,' says I, 'and good luck. One of us will come and
lead you into the weighing yard, if you pull it off, and chance the odds, if
Sir Ferdinand himself was at the gate.'</p>
<p>'All right,' says he, 'I'll look out for you,' and off he goes. I went back
and told Aileen and Gracey, and we settled that they were to drive out to the
course with Cyrus Williams and his wife. I rode, thinking myself safer on
horseback, for fear of accidents. Starlight, of course, went in the Dawsons'
drag, and was going to enjoy himself to the last minute. He had his horse ready
at a moment's notice, and Warrigal was not far off to give warning, or to bring
up his horse if we had to ride for it.</p>
<p>Well, the first part of the day went well enough, and then about half-past
one we all went down to the church. The young fellow that was to marry Bella
Barnes was known on the field and well liked by the miners, so a good many of
them made it up to go and see the wedding. They'd heard of Bella and Maddie,
and wanted to see what they looked like.</p>
<p>The church was on the side of the town next the racecourse, so they hadn't
far to go. By and by, as the crowd moved that way, Starlight says to the
Commissioner&mdash;</p>
<p>'Where are all these good folks making for?'</p>
<p>'Why, the fact is there's to be a wedding,' he says, 'and it excites a good
deal of attention as the young people are well known on the field and popular.
Bella Barnes and her sister are very fine girls in their way. Suppose we go and
look on too! There won't be anything now before the big race.'</p>
<p>'By Jove! a first-rate ideah,' says Starlight. 'I should like to see an
Australian wedding above all things.'</p>
<p>'This will be the real thing, then,' says Mr. Jack Dawson. 'Let's drive up
to our hotel, put up the horses, have a devil and a glass of champagne, and we
can be back easy in time for the race.' So away they went. Cyrus drove the
girls and his wife in his dogcart, so we were there all ready to see the bride
come up.</p>
<p>It looked a regular grand affair, my word. The church was that crammed there
was hardly a place to sit or stand in. Every woman, young and old, in the
countryside was there, besides hundreds of diggers who sat patiently waiting as
if some wonderful show were going to take place. Aileen and Gracey had come in
early and got a pew next to the top almost. I stood outside. There was hardly a
chance for any one else to get in.</p>
<p>By and by up comes old Jonathan, driving a respectable-looking carriage,
with his wife and Bella and Maddie all in white silk and satin, and looking
splendid. Out he gets, and takes Bella to walk up the middle of the church.
When he went in with Bella, Maddie had one look in, and it seemed so crammed
full of people that she looked frightened and drew back. Just then up comes the
Mr. Dawsons and Starlight, with the Commissioner and a few more.</p>
<p>Directly he sees Maddie draw back, Starlight takes the whole thing in, and
walked forward.</p>
<p>'My dear young lady,' says he, 'will you permit me to escort you up the
aisle? The bride appears to have preceded you.'</p>
<p>He offered her his arm, and, if you'll believe me, the girl didn't know him
a bit in the world, and stared at him like a perfect stranger.</p>
<p>'It's all right, Miss Maddie,' says the Commissioner. He had a way of
knowing all the girls, as far as a laugh or a bit of chaff went, especially if
they were good-looking. 'Mr. Lascelles is an English gentleman, newly arrived,
and a friend of mine. He's anxious to learn Australian ways.'</p>
<p>She took his arm then and walked on, never looking at him, but quite
shy-like, till he whispered a word in her ear which brought more colour into
her face than any one had seen there before for a year.</p>
<p>'My word, Lascelles knows how to talk to 'em,' says Jack Dawson. 'He's given
that girl a whip that makes her brighten up. What a chap he is; you can't lick
him.'</p>
<p>'Pretty fair all round, I should say,' says the other brother, Bill. 'Hullo!
are we to go on the platform with the parson and the rest of 'em?'</p>
<p>The reason was that as we went up the church all together, all in a heap,
with the Barneses and the bride, they thought we must be related to 'em; and
the church being choke-full they shunted us on to the place inside the rails,
where we found ourselves drafted into the small yard with the bridegroom, the
bride, the parson, and all that mob.</p>
<p>There wasn't much time to spare, what with the racing and the general bustle
of the day. The miners gave a sort of buzz of admiration as Bella and Maddie
and the others came up the aisle. They looked very well, there's no manner of
doubt. They were both tallish girls, slight, but well put together, and had
straight features and big bright eyes, with plenty of fun and meaning in 'em.
All they wanted was a little more colour like, and between the hurry for time
and Bella getting married, a day's work that don't come often in any one's
life, and having about a thousand people to look at 'em, both the girls were
flushed up a good deal. It set them off first-rate. I never saw either of them
look so handsome before. Old Barnes had come down well for once, and they were
dressed in real good style&mdash;hadn't overdone it neither.</p>
<p>When the tying-up fakement was over everything went off first-rate. The
bridegroom was a hardy-looking, upstanding young chap that looked as if work
was no trouble to him. Next to a squatter I think a Government surveyor's the
best billet going. He can change about from one end of the district to another.
He has a good part of his time the regular free bush life, with his camp and
his men, and the harder he works the more money he makes. Then when he comes
back to town he can enjoy himself and no mistake. He is not tied to regular
hours like other men in the service, and can go and come when he likes pretty
well. Old Barnes would be able to give Bella and her sister a tidy bit of money
some day, and if they took care they'd be comfortable enough off after a few
years. He might have looked higher, but Bella would make any man she took to a
slashing good wife, and so she did him. So the parson buckles them to, and the
last words were said. Starlight steps forward and says, 'I believe it's the
custom in all circles to salute the bride, which I now do,' and he gave Bella a
kiss before every one in the most high and mighty and respectful manner, just
as if he was a prince of the blood. At the same time he says, 'I wish her every
happiness and good fortune in her married life, and I beg of her to accept this
trifling gift as a souvenir of the happy occasion.' Then he pulls off a ring
from his little finger and slips it on hers. The sun glittered on it for a
moment. We could see the stones shine. It was a diamond ring, every one could
see. Then the Commissioner steps forward and begs to be permitted the same
privilege, which made Bella laugh and blush a bit. Directly after Mr.
Chanewood, who had stood quiet enough alongside of his wife, tucked her arm
inside of his and walked away down the church, as if he thought this kind of
thing was well enough in its way, but couldn't be allowed to last all day.</p>
<p>When they got into the carriage and drove off the whole church was cleared,
and they got such a cheer as you might have heard at Tambaroora. The parson was
the only living soul left near the building in five minutes. Everybody was in
such a hurry to get back to the course and see the big race of the meeting.</p>
<p>Starlight slipped away in the crowd from his two friends, and managed to get
a quiet few minutes with me and Gracey and Aileen; she was scolding him between
jest and earnest for the kissing business, and said she thought he was going to
leave off these sort of attentions to other girls.</p>
<p>'Not that she knew you at first, a bit in the world,' Aileen said. 'I
watched her face pretty close, and I'm sure she thought you were some grand
gentleman, a friend of the Commissioner's and the Mr. Dawsons.'</p>
<p>'My dearest girl,' said he, 'it was a promise I made months since that I
should attend Bella's wedding, and I never break my word, as I hope you will
find. These girls have been good friends and true to us in our need. We all owe
them much. I don't suppose we shall cross each other's path again.'</p>
<p>There wasn't much more time. We both had to move off. He had just time to
catch his drag, and I had to get my horse. The Dawsons bullied him a bit for
keeping them waiting, and swore he had stayed behind to flirt with some of the
girls in the church after the wedding was over.</p>
<p>'You're not to be trusted when there's temptation going,' Jack Dawson said.
'Saw you talking to that Marston girl. If you don't mind you'll have your head
knocked off. They're a rum lot to deal with, I can tell you.'</p>
<p>'I must take care of myself,' he said, laughing. 'I have done so in other
lands, and I suppose yours is no exception.'</p>
<p>'This is a dashed queer country in some ways, and with deuced strange people
in it, too, as you'll find by the time you've had your colonial experience,'
says Bill Dawson; 'but there goes the saddling-bell!'</p>
<p>The course had 20,000 people on it now if there was one. About a dozen
horses stood stripped for the race, and the betting men were yelling out the
odds as we got close enough to the stand to hear them. We had a good look at
the lot. Three or four good-looking ones among them, and one or two flyers that
had got in light as usual. Rainbow was nowhere about. Darkie was on the card,
but no one seemed to know where he was or anything about him. We expected he'd
start at 20 to 1, but somehow it leaked out that he was entered by old Jacob
Benton, and that acted as a damper on the layers of the odds. 'Old Jake's
generally there or thereabouts. If he's a duffer, it's the first one he's
brought to the post. Why don't the old varmint show up?'</p>
<p>This was what I heard about and round, and we began to get uneasy ourselves,
for fear that something might have happened to him or the horse. About 8 or 9
to 1 was all we could get, and that we took over and over again.</p>
<p>As the horses came up the straight, one after the other, having their
pipe-openers, you'd have thought no race had been run that week, to see the
interest all the people took in it. My word, Australia is a horsey country, and
no mistake. With the exception of Arabia, perhaps, as they tell us about, I
can't think as there's a country on the face of the earth where the people's
fonder of horses. From the time they're able to walk, boys and girls, they're
able to ride, and ride well. See the girls jump on bare-backed, with nothing
but a gunny-bag under 'em, and ride over logs and stones, through scrub and
forest, down gullies, or along the side of a mountain. And a horse race, don't
they love it? Wouldn't they give their souls almost&mdash;and they do often
enough&mdash;for a real flyer, a thoroughbred, able to run away from everything
in a country race. The horse is a fatal animal to us natives, and many a man's
ruin starts from a bit of horse-flesh not honestly come by.</p>
<p>But our racing ain't going forward, and the day's passing fast. As I said,
everybody was looking at the horses&mdash;coming along with the rush of the
thoroughbred when he's 'on his top' for condition; his coat like satin, and his
legs like iron. There were lots of the bush girls on horseback, and among them
I soon picked out Maddie Barnes. She was dressed in a handsome habit and hat.
How she'd had time to put them on since the wedding I couldn't make out, but
women manage to dress faster some times than others. She'd wasted no time
anyhow.</p>
<p>She was mounted on a fine, tall, upstanding chestnut, and Joe Moreton was
riding alongside of her on a good-looking bay, togged out very superior also.
Maddie was in one of her larking humours, and gave Joe quite enough to do to
keep time with her.</p>
<p>'I don't see my horse here yet,' she says to Joe, loud enough for me to
hear; but she knew enough not to talk to me or pretend to know me. 'I want to
back him for a fiver. I hope that old Jacob hasn't gone wrong.'</p>
<p>'What do you call your horse?' says Joe. 'I didn't know your father had one
in this race.'</p>
<p>'No fear,' says Maddie; 'only this horse was exercised for a bit near our
place. He's a regular beauty, and there isn't a horse in this lot fit to see
the way he goes.'</p>
<p>'Who does he belong to?' says Joe.</p>
<p>'That's a secret at present,' says she; 'but you'll know some day, when
you're a bit older, if you behave yourself. He's Mr. Jacob Benton's Darkie now,
and you bet on him to the coat on your back.'</p>
<p>'I'll see what I think of him first,' says Joe, who didn't fancy having a
horse rammed down his throat like that.</p>
<p>'If you don't like him you don't like me,' says Maddie. 'So mind that, Joe
Moreton.'</p>
<p>Just as she spoke there was a stir in the crowd, and old Jacob came along
across the course leading a horse with a sheet on, just as easy-going as if
he'd a day to spare. One of the stewards rode up to him, and asked him what he
meant by being so late.</p>
<p>The old chap pulls out his watch. 'You'll stick to your advertised time,
won't you? I've time to weigh, time to pull off this here sheet and my
overcoat, time to mount, and a minute to spare. I never was late in my life,
governor.'</p>
<p>Most of the riding mob was down with the racehorses, a distance or so from
the stand, where they was to start, the course being over two miles. So the
weighing yard and stand was pretty well empty, which was just what old Jacob
expected.</p>
<p>The old man walks over to the scales and has himself weighed all regular,
declaring a pound overweight for fear of accidents. He gets down as quiet and
easy as possible to the starting point, and just in time to walk up steadily
with the other horses, when down goes the starter's flag, and 'Off' was the
word. Starlight and the Dawsons were down there waiting for him. As they went
away one of the ringmen says, 'Ten to one against Darkie. I lay Darkie.'
'Done,' says Starlight; 'will you do it in tens?' 'All right,' says the 'book'.
'I'll take you,' says both the Dawsons, and he entered their names.</p>
<p>They'd taken all they could get the night before at the hotel; and as no one
knew anything about Darkie, and he had top weight, he hadn't many backers.</p>
<h2>Chapter 43</h2>
<p>Mr. Dawson drove pretty near the stand then, and they all stood up in the
drag. I went back to Aileen and Gracey Storefield. We were close by the winning
post when they came past; they had to go another time round.</p>
<p>The Sydney horses were first and second, the diggers' favourite third; but
old Rainbow, lying well up, was coming through the ruck hard held and looking
full of running. They passed close by us. What a sight it is to see a dozen
blood horses in top condition come past you like a flash of lightning! How
their hoofs thunder on the level turf! How the jockeys' silk jackets rustle in
the wind they make! How muscle and sinew strain as they pretty near fly through
the air! No wonder us young fellows, and the girls too, feel it's worth a year
of their lives to go to a good race. Yes, and will to the world's end. 'O you
darling Rainbow!' I heard Aileen say. 'Are you going to win this race and
triumph over all these grand horses? What a sight it will be! I didn't think I
could have cared for a race so much.'</p>
<p>It didn't seem hardly any time before they were half-way round again, and
the struggle was on, in good downright earnest. One of the Sydney horses began
to shake his tail. The other still kept the lead. Then the Turon
favourite&mdash;a real game pebble of a little horse&mdash;began to show
up.</p>
<p>'Hotspur, Hotspur! No. Bronzewing has it&mdash;Bronzewing. It's Bronzewing's
race. Turon for ever!' the crowd kept yelling.</p>
<p>'Oh! look at Rainbow!' says Aileen. And just then, at the turn, old Jacob
sat down on him. The old horse challenged Bronzewing, passed him, and collared
Hotspur. 'Darkie! Darkie!' shouts everybody. 'No! Hotspur&mdash;Darkie's
coming&mdash;Darkie&mdash;Darkie! I tell yer Darkie.' And as old Jacob made one
last effort, and landed him a winner by a clear head, there was a roar went up
from the whole crowd that might have been heard at Nulla Mountain.</p>
<p>Starlight jumps off the drag and leads the old horse into the weighing yard.
The steward says 'Dismount.' No fear of old Jacob getting down before he heard
that. He takes his saddle in his lap and gets into the scales. 'Weight,' says
the clerk. Then the old fellow mounts and rides past the judge's box. 'I
declare Mr. Benton's horse Darkie to be the winner of the Turon Grand Handicap,
Bronzewing second horse, Hotspur third,' says he.</p>
<p>Well, there was great cheering and hollering, though none knew exactly whose
horse he was or anything about him; but an Australian crowd always likes to see
the best horse win&mdash;and they like fair play&mdash;so Darkie was cheered
over and over again, and old Jacob too.</p>
<p>Aileen stroked and petted him and patted his neck and rubbed his nose, and
you'd raly thought the old horse knew her, he seemed so gentle-like. Then the
Commissioner came down and said Mrs. Hautley, the police magistrate's wife, and
some other ladies wanted to see the horse that had won the race. So he was
taken over there and admired and stroked till old Jacob got quite crusty.</p>
<p>'It's an odd thing, Dawson,' says the Commissioner, 'nobody here knows this
horse, where he was bred, or anything about him. Such a grand animal as he is,
too! I wish Morringer could have seen him; he's always raving about horses. How
savage he'll be to have missed all the fun!'</p>
<p>'He's a horse you don't see every day,' says Bill Dawson. 'I'll give a
couple of hundred for him right off.'</p>
<p>'Not for sale at present,' says old Jacob, looking like a cast-iron image.
'I'll send ye word when he is.'</p>
<p>'All right,' says Mr. Dawson. 'What a shoulder, what legs, what loins he
has! Ah! well, he'll be weighted out now, and you will be glad to sell him
soon.'</p>
<p>'Our heads won't ache then,' says Jacob, as he turns round and rides
away.</p>
<p>'Very neat animal, shows form,' drawls Starlight. 'Worth three hundred in
the shires for a hunter; if he can jump, perhaps more; but depends on his
manners&mdash;must have manners in the hunting-field, Dawson, you know.'</p>
<p>'Manners or not,' says Bill Dawson, 'it's my opinion he could have won that
race in a canter. I must find out more about him and buy him if I can.'</p>
<p>'I'll go you halves if you like,' says Starlight. 'I weally believe him to
be a good animal.'</p>
<p>Just then up rides Warrigal. He looks at the old horse as if he had never
seen him before, nor us neither. He rides close by the heads of Mr. Dawson's
team, and as he does so his hat falls off, by mistake, of course. He jumps off
and picks it up, and rides slowly down towards the tent.</p>
<p>It was the signal to clear. Something was up.</p>
<p>I rode back to town with Aileen and Gracey; said good-bye&mdash;a hard
matter it was, too&mdash;and sloped off to where my horse was, and was out of
sight of Turon in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Starlight hails a cabby (he told me this afterwards) and gets him to drive
him over to the inn where he was staying, telling the Dawsons he'd have the
wine put in ice for the dinner, that he wanted to send off a letter to Sydney
by the post, and he'd be back on the course in an hour in good time for the
last race.</p>
<p>In about half-an-hour back comes the same cabman and puts a note into Bill
Dawson's hand. He looks at it, stares, swears a bit, and then crumples it up
and puts it into his pocket.</p>
<p>Just as it was getting dark, and the last race just run, back comes Sir
Ferdinand and all the police. They'd ridden hard, as their horses showed, and
Sir Ferdinand (they say) didn't look half as good-natured as he generally
did.</p>
<p>'You've lost a great meeting, Morringer,' says the Commissioner. 'Great pity
you had to be off just when you did. But that's just like these infernal
scoundrels of bush-rangers. They always play up at the most inconvenient time.
How did you get on with them?'</p>
<p>'Get on with them?' roars Sir Ferdinand, almost making a hole in his
manners&mdash;he was that tired out and done he could hardly sit on his
horse&mdash;'why, we've been sold as clean as a whistle. I believe some of the
brutes have been here all the time.'</p>
<p>'That's impossible,' says the Commissioner. 'There's been no one here that
the police are acquainted with; not that I suppose Jackson and Murphy know many
of the cross boys.'</p>
<p>'No strange men nor horses, no disguises?' says Sir Ferdinand. Here he
brings out a crumpled bit of paper, written on&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>If sur firdnand makes haist back heel be in time to see Starlite's
Raneboe win the handy capp.<br>
<br>
BILLY THE BOY.</blockquote>
<p>'I firmly believe that young scoundrel, who will be hanged yet, strung us on
after Moran ever so far down south, just to leave the coast clear for the
Marstons, and then sent me this, too late to be of any use.'</p>
<p>'Quite likely. But the Marstons couldn't be here, let alone Starlight,
unless&mdash;by Jove! but that's impossible. Impossible! Whew! Here, Jack
Dawson, where's your Indian friend?'</p>
<p>'Gone back to the inn. Couldn't stand the course after the handicap. You're
to dine with us, Commissioner; you too, Scott; kept a place, Sir Ferdinand, for
you on the chance.'</p>
<p>'One moment, pardon me. Who's your friend?'</p>
<p>'Name Lascelles. Just from home&mdash;came by India. Splendid fellow! Backed
Darkie for the handicap&mdash;we did too&mdash;won a pot of money.'</p>
<p>'What sort of a horse is this Darkie?'</p>
<p>'Very grand animal. Old fellow had him in a tent, about a mile down the
creek; dark bay, star in forehead. Haven't seen such a horse for years. Like
the old Emigrant lot.'</p>
<p>Sir Ferdinand beckoned to a senior constable.</p>
<p>'There's a tent down there near the creek, I think you said, Dawson. Bring
up the racehorse you find there, and any one in charge.'</p>
<p>'And now I think I'll drive in with you, Dawson' (dismounting, and handing
his horse to a trooper). 'I suppose a decent dinner will pick me up, though I
feel just as much inclined to hang myself as do anything else at present. I
should like to meet this travelled friend of yours; strangers are most
agreeable.'</p>
<p>Sir Ferdinand was right in thinking it was hardly worth while going through
the form of seeing whether we had waited for him. Lieutenant Lascelles, on
leave from his regiment in India, had taken French leave. When inquiry was made
at the hotel, where dinner had been ordered by Mr. Dawson and covers laid for a
dozen, he had just stepped out. No one seemed to know exactly where to find
him. The hotel people thought he was with the Mr. Dawsons, and they thought he
was at the hotel. When they surrounded the tent, and then rushed it, all that
it contained was the body of old Jacob Benton, lying dead drunk on the floor. A
horse-rug was over him, his racing saddle under his head, and his pockets
stuffed with five-pound notes. He had won his race and got his money, so he was
not bound in honour to keep sober a minute longer.</p>
<p>Rainbow was gone, and there was nothing to be got out of him as to who had
taken him or which way he had gone. Nobody seemed to have 'dropped' to me. I
might have stayed at Turon longer if I'd liked. But it wasn't good enough by a
long way.</p>
<p>We rode away straight home, and didn't lose time on the road, you bet. Not
out-and-out fast, either; there was no need for that. We had a clear two hours'
start of the police, and their horses were pretty well knocked up by the pace
they'd come home at, so they weren't likely to overhaul us easy.</p>
<p>It was a grand night, and, though we didn't feel up to much in the way of
talking, it wasn't bad in its way. Starlight rode Rainbow, of course; and the
old horse sailed away as if a hundred miles or a thousand made no odds to
him.</p>
<p>Warrigal led the way in front. He always went as straight as a line, just
the same as if he'd had a compass in his forehead. We never had any bother
about the road when he led the way.</p>
<p>'There's nothing like adventure,' says Starlight, at last. 'As some one
says, who would have thought we should have come out so well? Fortune favours
the brave, in a general way, there's no doubt. By George! what a comfort it was
to feel one's self a gentleman again and to associate with one's equals. Ha!
ha! how savage Sir Ferdinand is by this time, and the Commissioner! As for the
Dawsons, they'll make a joke of it. Fancy my dining at the camp! It's about the
best practical joke I ever carried out, and I've been in a good many.'</p>
<p>'The luckiest turn we've ever had,' says I. 'I never expected to see Gracey
and Aileen there, much less to go to a ball with them and no one to say no. It
beats the world.'</p>
<p>'It makes it all the rougher going back, that's the worst of it,' says he.
'Good God! what fools, idiots, raving lunatics, we've all been! Why, but for
our own infernal folly, should we be forced to shun our fellow-men, and hide
from the light like beasts of prey? What are we better? Better?&mdash;nay, a
hundred times worse. Some day I shall shoot myself, I know I shall. What a muff
Sir Ferdinand must be, he's missed me twice already.'</p>
<p>Here he rode on, and never opened his mouth again till we began to rise the
slope at the foot of Nulla Mountain. When the dark fit was on him it was no use
talking to him. He'd either not seem to hear you, or else he'd say something
which made you sorry for opening your mouth at all. It gave us all we could do
to keep along with him. He never seemed to look where he was going, and rode as
if he had a spare neck at any rate. When we got near the pass to the mountain,
I called out to him that he'd better pull up and get off. Do you think he'd
stop or make a sign he heard me? Not a bit of it. He just started the old horse
down when he came to the path in the cliff as if it was the easiest road in the
world. He kept staring straight before him while the horse put down his feet,
as if it was regular good fun treading up rugged sharp rocks and rolling
stones, and turf wasn't worth going over. It seemed to me as if he wanted to
kill himself for some reason or other. It would have been easy enough with some
horses, but you could have ridden Rainbow down the roof of a house and jumped
him into the front balcony, I firmly believe. You couldn't throw him down; if
he'd dropped into a well he'd have gone in straight and landed on his legs.</p>
<p>Dad was glad enough to see us; he was almost civil, and when he heard that
Rainbow had won the 'big money' he laughed till I thought he'd do himself
mischief, not being used to it. He made us tell him over again about Starlight
and I going to the ball, and our seeing Aileen and Gracey there; and when he
came to the part where Starlight made the bride a present of a diamond ring I
thought he never would have done chuckling to himself. Even old Crib looked at
me as if he didn't use to think me much of a fellow, but after this racket had
changed his mind.</p>
<p>'Won't there be a jolly row in the papers when they get all these different
characters played by one chap, and that man the Captain?' says he. 'I knew he
was clever enough for anything; but this beats all. I don't believe now,
Captain, you'll ever be took.'</p>
<p>'Not alive!' says Starlight, rather grim and gloomy-looking; then he walks
off by himself.</p>
<p>We stabled Rainbow, of course, for a week or two after this&mdash;being in
training it wouldn't do to turn him out straight at once. Hardy as he was, no
horse could stand that altogether; so we kept him under shelter in a roughish
kind of a loose box we had knocked up, and fed him on bush hay. We had a small
stack of that in case we wanted to keep a horse in&mdash;which we did
sometimes. In the daytime he was loose in the yard. After a bit, when he was
used to the weather, he was turned out again with his old mob, and was never a
hair the worse of it. We took it easy ourselves, and sent out Warrigal for the
letters and papers. We expected to knock a good bit of fun out of them when
they came.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was the deuce and all to pay when the big Sydney papers
got hold of it, as well as the little 'Turon Star' and the 'Banner'.</p>
<blockquote>Was it true that the police had again been hoodwinked, justice
derided, and the law set at defiance by a gang of ruffians who would have been
run down in a fortnight had the police force been equal to the task entrusted
to them? Was the moral sentiment of the country population so perverted, so
obliterated, that robbers and murderers could find safe harbourage, trustworthy
friends, and secret intelligence? Could they openly show themselves in places
of public resort, mingle in amusements, and frequent the company of unblemished
and distinguished citizens; and yet more, after this flagrant insult to the
Government of the land, to every sacred principle of law and order, they could
disappear at will, apparently invisible and invulnerable to the officers of the
peace and the guardians of the public safety? It was incredible, it was
monstrous, degrading, nay, intolerable, and a remedy would have to be found
either in the reorganisation of an inefficient police force or in the
resignation of an incapable Ministry.</blockquote>
<p>'Good for the "Sydney Monitor",' says Starlight; 'that reporter knows how to
double-shot his guns, and winds up with a broadside. Let us see what the "Star"
says. I had a bet with the editor, and paid it, as it happened. Perhaps he'll
temper justice with mercy. Now for a start:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>That we have had strong casts from time to time and exciting
performances at our local theatres, no one will deny; but perhaps the
inhabitants of Turon never witnessed a more enthralling melodrama than was
played during the first two days of our race meeting before a crowded and
critical audience, and never, we can state from a somewhat extended experience
of matters dramatic, did they gaze on a more finished actor than the gentleman
who performed the leading part. Celebrated personages have ere now graced our
provincial boards. On the occasion of the burning of the Theatre Royal in
Sydney, we were favoured with the presence in our midst of artists who rarely,
if ever before, had quitted the metropolitan stage. But our "jeune premier" in
one sense has eclipsed every darling of the tragic or the comic muse.<br>
<br>
Where is there a member of the profession who could have sustained his part
with faultless ease and self-possession, being the whole time aware of the fact
that he smiled and conversed, danced and diced, dined and slept (ye gods! did
he sleep?), with a price upon his head&mdash;with the terrible doom of
dishonour and inevitable death hanging over him, consequent upon a detection
which might occur at any moment?<br>
<br>
Yet was there a stranger guest among us who did all this and more with
unblenching brow, unruffled self-possession, unequalled courtesy, who, if
discovered, would have been arrested and consigned to a lock-up, only to be
exchanged for the gloom and the manacles of the condemned cell. He, indeed,
after taking a prominent part in all the humours of the vast social gathering
by which the Turon miners celebrated their annual games, disappeared with the
almost magical mystery which has already marked his proceedings.<br>
<br>
Whom could we possibly allude to but the celebrated, the illustrious, we grieve
to be compelled to add, the notorious Starlight, the hero of a hundred legends,
the Australian Claude Duval?<br>
<br>
Yes, almost incredible as it may seem to our readers and persons at a distance
imperfectly acquainted with exceptional phases of colonial life, the robber
chief (and, for all we know, more than one of his aides-de-camp) was among us,
foremost among the betting men, the observed of all observers in the grand
stand, where, with those popular country gentlemen, the Messrs. Dawson, he
cheered the winners in the two great races, both of which, with demoniac luck,
he had backed heavily.<br>
<br>
We narrate as a plain, unvarnished truth that this accomplished and
semi-historical personage raced a horse of his own, which turns out now to have
been the famous Rainbow, an animal of such marvellous speed, courage, and
endurance that as many legends are current about him as of Dick Turpin's
well-known steed. He attended the marriage, in St. Matthew's Church, of Miss
Isabel Barnes, the daughter of our respected neighbour, Mr. Jonathan Barnes,
when he presented the bride with a costly and beautiful diamond ring,
completing the round of his vagaries by dining on invitation with the
Commissioner at the camp mess, and, with that high official, honouring our race
ball with his presence, and sunning himself in the smiles of our fairest
maidens.<br>
<br>
We are afraid that we shall have exhausted the fund of human credulity, and
added a fresh and original Chapter to those tales of mystery and imagination of
which the late Edgar Allan Poe was so masterly a delineator.<br>
<br>
More familiarly rendered, it seems that the fascinating Captain
Starlight&mdash;"as mild a mannered man" (like Lambre) "as ever scuttled a ship
or cut a throat," presented himself opportunely at one of the mountain
hostelries, to the notice of our good-hearted squires of Wideview, Messrs.
William and John Dawson. One of their wheelers lay at the point of
death&mdash;a horse of great value&mdash;when the agreeable stranger suggested
a remedy which effected a sudden cure.<br>
<br>
With all their generous instincts stirred, the Messrs. Dawson invited the
gentleman to take a seat in their well-appointed drag. He introduced himself as
Mr. Lascelles, holding a commission in an Indian regiment of Irregular Horse,
and now on leave, travelling chiefly for health.<br>
<br>
Just sufficiently sunburned, perfect in manner, full of information, humorous
and original in conversation, and with all the "prestige" of the unknown, small
wonder that "The Captain" was regarded as a prize, socially considered, and
introduced right and left. Ha! ha! What a most excellent jest, albeit rather
keen, as far as Sir Ferdinand is concerned! We shall never, never cease to
recall the humorous side of the whole affair. Why, we ourselves, our august
editorial self, actually had a bet in the stand with the audacious pretender,
and won it, too. Did he pay up? Of course he did. A "pony", to wit, and on the
nail. He does nothing by halves, "notre capitaine". We have been less promptly
reimbursed, indeed, not paid at all, by gentlemen boasting a fairer record. How
graciously he smiled and bowed as, with his primrose kid gloves, he disengaged
the two tenners and a five-pound note from his well-filled receptacle.<br>
<br>
The last time we had seen him was in the dock at Nomah, being tried in the
great cattle case, that "cause celebre". To do him justice, he was quite as
cool and unconcerned there, and looked as if he was doing the amateur casual
business without ulterior liabilities.<br>
<br>
Adieu! fare thee well, Starlight, bold Rover of the Waste; we feel inclined to
echo the lament of the ancient Lord Douglas&mdash;<br>
<br>
"'Tis pity of him, too," he cried;<br>
"Bold can he speak, and fairly ride;<br>
I warrant him a warrior tried."<br>
<br>
It is in the interests of justice, doubtless, that thou be hunted down, and
expiate by death-doom the crimes which thou and thy myrmidons have committed
against society in the sight of God and man. But we cannot, for the life of us,
take a keen interest in thy capture. We owe thee much, Starlight; many a
slashing leader, many a spicy paragraph, many a stately reflection on
contemporary morals hast thou furnished us with. Shall we haste to the
slaughter of the rarest bird&mdash;golden ovaried? We trow not. Get thee to the
wilderness, and repent thee of thy sins. Why should we judge thee? Thou hast,
if such dubious donation may avail, an editor's blessing. Depart, and "stick
up" no more.</blockquote>
<p>Well done, the "Turon Star"!' says Starlight, after he read it all out. 'I
call that very fair. There's a flavour of good feeling underneath much of that
nonsense, as well as of porter and oysters. It does a fellow a deal more good
than slanging him to believe that he's human after all, and that men think
so.'</p>
<p>'Do you reckon that chap was sober when he wrote that?' says father. 'Blest
if I can make head or tail of it. Half what them fellows puts down is regular
rot. Why couldn't he have cut it a bit shorter, too?'</p>
<h2>Chapter 44</h2>
<p>'The "Banner" comes next,' says Starlight, tearing it open. 'We shall have
something short and sweet after the "Star". How's this?</p>
<blockquote>STARLIGHT AGAIN.<br>
<br>
This mercurial brigand, it would appear, has paid Turon another visit, but,
with the exception of what may be considered the legalised robbery of the
betting ring, has not levied contributions. Rather the other way, indeed. A
hasty note for Mr. Dawson, whom he had tricked into temporary association by
adopting one of the disguises he can so wonderfully assume, requested that
gentleman to receive the Handicap Stakes, won by his horse, Darkie, alias
Rainbow, and to hand them over to the treasurer of the Turon Hospital, which
was accordingly done.<br>
<br>
Sir Ferdinand and the police had been decoyed away previously nearly 100 miles
by false intelligence as to Moran and his gang. Our town and treasure were thus
left undefended for forty-eight hours, while a daring criminal and his
associates mingled unsuspected with all classes. We have always regarded the
present system&mdash;facetiously called police protection&mdash;as a farce.
This latter fiasco will probably confirm the idea with the public at large. We,
unlike a contemporary, have no morbid sympathy with crime&mdash;embroidered or
otherwise; our wishes, as loyal subjects, are confined to a short shrift and a
high gallows for all who dare to obstruct the Queen's highway.</blockquote>
<p>'That's easy to understand, barrin' a word here and there,' says father,
taking his pipe out of his mouth and laying it down; 'that's the way they used
to talk to us in the old days. Dashed if I don't think it's the best way after
all. You know where you are. The rest's flummery. All on us as takes to the
cross does it with our eyes open, and deserves all we gets.'</p>
<p>'I'm afraid you're right, governor; but why didn't these moral ideas occur
to you, for instance, and others earlier in life?'</p>
<p>'Why?' says father, getting up and glaring with his eyes, 'because I was a
blind, ignorant dog when I was young, as had never been taught nothing, and
knowed nothing, not so much as him there' (pointing to Crib), 'for he knows
what his business is, and I didn't. I was thrashed and starved, locked up in a
gaol, chained and flogged after that, and half the time for doing what I didn't
know was wrong, and couldn't know more than one of them four-year-old colts out
there that knocks his head agin the yard when he's roped, and falls backards
and breaks his neck if he ain't watched. Whose business was it to have learned
me better? That I can't rightly say, but it seemed it was the business of the
Government people to gaol me, and iron me, and flog me. Was that justice? Any
man's sense 'll tell him it wasn't. It's been them and me for it since I got my
liberty, and if I had had a dozen lives they'd all have gone the same
road!'</p>
<p>We none of us felt in the humour to say much after that. Father had got into
one of his tantrums, and when he did he was fit to be tied; only I'd not have
took the contract for something. Whatever it was that had happened to him in
the old times when he was a Government man he didn't talk about. Only every now
and then he'd let out just as he did now, as if nothing could ever set him
straight again, or keep him from fighting against them, as he called the swells
and the Government, and everybody almost that was straightgoing and honest.
He'd been at it a good many years, one way and another, and any one that knew
him didn't think it likely he'd change.</p>
<p>The next dust we got into was all along of a Mr. Knightley, who lived a good
way down to the south, and it was one of the worst things we ever were mixed up
in. After the Turon races and all that shine, somehow or other we found that
things had been made hotter for us than ever since we first turned out. Go
where we would, we found the police always quick on our trail, and we had two
or three very close shaves of it. It looked as if our luck was dead out, and we
began to think our chance of getting across the border to Queensland, and clear
out of the colony that way, looked worse every day.</p>
<p>Dad kept foraging about to get information, and we sent Warrigal and Billy
the Boy all over the country to find out how it was things were turning out so
contrary.</p>
<p>Sir Ferdinand was always on the move, but we knew he couldn't do it all
himself unless he got the office from some one who knew the ropes better than
he did.</p>
<p>Last of all we dropped on to it.</p>
<p>There was one of the goldfields commissioners, a Mr. Knightley, a very keen,
cool hand; he was a great sporting man, and a dead shot, like Mr. Hamilton.
Well, this gentleman took it into his head to put on extra steam and try and
run us down. He'd lost some gold by us in the escort robbery, and not forgotten
it; so it seems he'd been trying his best to fit us ever since. Just at first
he wasn't able for much, but later on he managed to get information about us
and our beat, whenever we left the Hollow, and he put two and two together, and
very nearly dropped on us, as I said before, two or three times. We heard, too,
that he should say he'd never rest till he had Starlight and the Marstons, and
that if he could get picked police he'd bring us in within a month, dead or
alive.</p>
<p>We didn't care much about blowing of this sort in a general way; but one of
dad's telegraphs sent word in that Mr. Knightley had a couple of thousand
pounds worth of gold from a new diggings lodged at his private residence for a
few days till he could get the escort to call for it; that there was only him
and a German doctor, a great scholar he was, named Schiller, in the house.</p>
<p>Moran and Daly knew about this, and they were dead on for sticking up the
place and getting hold of the gold. Besides that, we felt savage about his
trying to run us in. Of course, it was his duty and that of all magistrates and
commissioners in a general way. But he wasn't an officer of police, and we
thought he was going outside of his line. So when all came to all, we made up
our minds to learn him a lesson to stick to his own work; besides, a thousand
ounces of gold was no foolish touch, and we could kill two birds with one
stone. Moran, Daly, and Joe Wall were to be in it besides. We didn't like
working with them. Starlight and I were dead against it. But we knew they'd
tackle it by themselves if we backed out. So we agreed to make one thing of it.
We were to meet at a place about ten miles off and ride over there
together.</p>
<p>Just about ten o'clock we closed in on the place, and left Billy the Boy and
Warrigal with the horses, while we sneaked up. We couldn't get near, though,
without his knowing it, for he always had a lot of sporting
dogs&mdash;pointers, retrievers, kangaroo dogs, no end. They kicked up a deuce
of a row, and barked and howled enough to raise the dead, before we got within
a quarter of a mile from the house.</p>
<p>Of course he was on his guard then, and before long the bullets began to fly
pretty thick among us, and we had to take cover to return fire and keep as dark
as we could. No doubt this Dr. Schiller loaded the guns and handed them to him,
else he couldn't have made such play as he did.</p>
<p>We blazed away too, and as there was no stable at the back we surrounded the
house and tried hard to find an opening. Devil a chance there seemed to be;
none of us dared show. So sure as we did we could hear one of those Winchester
rifle bullets sing through the air, almost on the top of us. We all had a close
shave more than once for being too fast.</p>
<p>For more than half the night he kept cannonading away, and we didn't seem
able to get any nearer the place. At last we drew lots which should try and get
up close to the place, so as to make a rush while we poured in our broadside
and open a door to let us in.</p>
<p>The lot fell upon Patsey Daly. 'Good-bye, all,' he said. 'I'm dashed if I
don't think Knightley will bag me. I don't half like charging him, and that's
God's truth. Anyhow I'll try for that barrel there; and if I get behind it I
can fire from short range and make him come out.'</p>
<p>He made a rush, half on his hands and knees, and managed to get behind this
barrel, where he was safe from being hit as long as he kept well behind it.
Then he peppered away, right and left.</p>
<p>On the left of the verandah there was a door stood partly open, and after a
bit a man in a light overcoat and a white hat, like Mr. Knightley always wore,
showed himself for a second. Daly raps away at this, and the man staggers and
falls. Patsey shows himself for a moment from behind the cask, thinking to make
a rush forward; that minute Mr. Knightley, who was watching him from a window
(the other was only an image), lets drive at him, cool and steady, and poor
Patsey drops like a cock, and never raised his head again. He was shot through
the body. He lingered a bit; but in less than an hour he was a dead man.</p>
<p>We began to think at last that we had got in for a hot thing, and that we
should have to drop it like Moran's mob at Kadombla. However, Starlight was one
of those men that won't be beat, and he kept getting more and more determined
to score. He crept away to the back of the building, where he could see to fire
at a top window close by where the doctor and Mr. Knightley had been potting at
us.</p>
<p>He had the repeating rifle he'd won from me; he never let it go afterwards,
and he could make wonderful shooting with it. He kept it going so lively that
they began to be hard pressed inside, and had to fire away twice as much
ammunition as they otherwise would. It always beat me how they contrived to
defend so many points at once. We tried back and front, doors and windows.
Twenty times we tried a rush, but they were always ready&mdash;so it
seemed&mdash;and their fire was too hot for us to stand up to, unless we wanted
to lose every second man.</p>
<p>The shooting was very close. Nearly every one of us had a
scratch&mdash;Starlight rather the worst, as he was more in the front and
showed himself more. His left arm was bleeding pretty free, but he tied a
handkerchief over it and went on as if nothing had happened, only I could see
that his face had that set look he only got now and then, and his eyes began to
show out a fierce light.</p>
<p>At last we began to see that the return fire was slacking off, while ours
was as brisk as ever.</p>
<p>'Hurrah!' says Starlight, 'I believe they'll give in soon. If they had any
cartridges they would have had every man of us in that last rush. Let's try
another dodge. Here goes for a battering-ram, Dick!'</p>
<p>He pointed to a long, heavy sapling which had been fetched in for a sleeper
or something of that sort. We picked it up, and, taking a run back, brought it
with all its weight against the front door. In it went like a sheet of bark; we
almost fell as we ran forward and found ourselves in a big, dark hall. It
seemed very queer and strange, everything was so silent and quiet.</p>
<p>We half expected another volley. But nothing came. We could only stand and
wait. The others had gone round the side of the house.</p>
<p>'Get to a corner, Dick; they're always the safest places. We must mind it
isn't an ambush. What the devil's the matter? Are they going to suicide, like
the people in the round tower of Jhansi?'</p>
<p>'There are no women here,' I said. 'There's no saying what Mr. Knightley
might do if his wife had been here.'</p>
<p>'Thank God, she's away at Bathurst,' said Starlight. 'I hate seeing women
put out. Besides, everybody bows down to Mrs. Knightley. She's as good as she's
handsome, I believe, and that's saying a great deal.'</p>
<p>Just then Moran and Wall managed to find their way into the other side of
the house, and they came tearing into the hall like a pair of colts. They
looked rather queer when they saw us three and no one else.</p>
<p>'What in thunder's up?' says Moran. 'Are they all gone to bed, and left us
the spare rooms? Poor Patsey won't want one, anyhow.'</p>
<p>'Better make some search upstairs,' says Starlight. 'Who'll go first? You
make a start, Moran; you like fighting people.'</p>
<p>'Couldn't think of going before the Captain,' says Moran, with a grin. 'I'll
follow where you lead.'</p>
<p>'All right!' says Starlight; 'here goes,' and he started to walk upstairs,
when all of a sudden he stopped and looked up as if something had surprised him
above a bit. Then he stepped back and waited. I noticed he took off his hat and
leaned against the wall.</p>
<p>It was an old-fashioned house for that part of the world, built a good many
years ago by a rich settler, who was once the owner of all that side of the
country. The staircase was all stone, ornamented every way it could be. Three
or four people could walk abreast easy enough.</p>
<p>Just about half-way up was a broad landing, and on this, all of a sudden,
appeared four people, inclined by their ways to come down to where we were,
while we were all wondering, for a reason you'll see afterwards.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Knightley who took the lady's arm&mdash;it was his wife, and she
had been there all the time, firing at us as like as not, or at any rate
helping. The others followed, and they all walked quite solemn and steady-like
down the stairs together.</p>
<p>It was a strange sight. There we were standing and leaning about the dark
hall, staring and wondering, and these people walking down to meet us like
ghosts, without speaking or anything else.</p>
<p>Mr. Knightley was a tall, handsome man, with a grand black beard that came
down to his chest. He walked like a lord, and had that kind of manner with him
that comes to people that have always been used to be waited on and have
everything found for them in this world. As for his wife, she was given in to
be the handsomest woman in the whole countryside&mdash;tall and graceful, with
a beautiful smile, and soft fair hair. Everybody liked and respected her,
gentle and simple&mdash;everybody had a good word for her. You couldn't have
got any one to say different for a hundred pounds. There are some people, here
and there, like this among the gentlefolk, and, say what you like, it does more
to make coves like us look a little closer at things and keep away from what's
wrong and bad than all the parsons' talk twice over. Mrs. Knightley was the
only woman that ever put me in mind of Miss Falkland, and I can't say more than
that.</p>
<p>So, as I said before, it was quite a picture to see them walk slowly and
proudly down and sweep into the hall as if they'd been marching into a
ballroom. We had both seen them at the ball at the Turon, and everybody agreed
they were the handsomest couple there.</p>
<p>Now they were entering their own hall in a different way. But you couldn't
have told much of what they felt by their faces. He was a proud man, and felt
bitterly enough that he had to surrender to a gang of men that he hated and
despised, that he'd boasted he could run down and capture in a month. Now the
tables were turned. He and his beautiful wife were in our power, and, to make
matters worse, one of our band lay dead, beside the inner wall, killed by his
hand.</p>
<p>What was to be his doom? And who could say how such a play might end?</p>
<p>I looked at our men. As they stepped on to the floor of the hall and looked
round Mrs. Knightley smiled. She looked to me like an angel from heaven that
had come by chance into the other place and hadn't found out her mistake. I saw
Starlight start as he looked at her. He was still leaning against the wall, and
there was a soft, sorrowful look in his eyes, like I remember noticing once
before while he was talking to Aileen about his early days, a thing he never
did but once. Part of her hair had straggled down, and hung in a sort of
ringlet by her face. It was pale, but clear and bright-looking, and there was a
thin streak of blood across her forehead that showed as she came underneath the
lamp-light from the landing above.</p>
<p>I looked over at Moran. He and Wall sat in a corner, looking as grim and
savage as possible, while his deadly black eyes had a kind of gloomy fire in
them that made him look like a wild beast in a cage.</p>
<p>Mr. Knightley was a man that always had the first word in everything, and
generally the best of an argument&mdash;putting down anybody who differed from
him in a quiet, superior sort of way.</p>
<p>He began now. 'Well, my men, I have come down to surrender, and I'm sorry to
be obliged to do so. But we have fired our last cartridge&mdash;the doctor
thought we had a thousand left&mdash;in which case, I may as well tell you,
you'd never have had this pleasure. Captain Starlight, I surrender my
sword&mdash;or should do so if I had one. We trust to receive honourable
treatment at your hands.'</p>
<p>'I'm sure the Captain will never permit any harm to come to me,' says Mrs.
Knightley, with a look in her eyes that, in spite of herself, said a deal more
than words. 'Why, I danced "vis-a-vis" to him in a quadrille at the Turon
ball.'</p>
<p>'I shall never forget the honour,' says Starlight, walking forward and
bowing low. 'Permit me to offer you a chair, madam; you look faint.'</p>
<p>As he did so she sank down in it, and really looked as if she would faint
away. It wouldn't have been much wonder if she had after what she'd gone
through that night.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Knightley began again. He wanted to know how he stood. He didn't
like the look of Moran and Wall&mdash;they were a deal too quiet for him, and
he could read men's faces like a book. The other two prisoners were the German
Dr. Schiller&mdash;a plucky old chap, who'd been a rebel and a conspirator and
I don't know what all in his own country. He'd seen too much of that kind of
thing to trouble himself over much about a trifle of this kind. The old woman
was a family servant, who had been with them for years and years. She was a
kind of worshipper of theirs, and was ready to live or die with her
mistress.</p>
<h2>Chapter 45</h2>
<p>So Mr. Knightley stood up and faced them all like a man. He was one of those
chaps that makes up their mind pretty quick about the sort of people they've
got to deal with, and if there's anything to be said or done lets 'em have it
'straight from the shoulder'. As he stood there&mdash;straight and
square&mdash;with his head thrown back, and his eyes&mdash;very bright and
sharp they were&mdash;looking every man's face over as if he was reading a
notice and had no time to spare, you couldn't have told, from his look, or
voice, or manner, whether he was afraid that things would go wrong, or whether
he was dead sure they'd go right. Some men are like that. Others you can tell
every thought that's passing through their minds just as if it was printed in
big letters on their breasts, like a handbill: '&pound;200 reward,' and so
on.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Knightley wasn't one of that sort, though I saw him keep his eye a
trifle longer on Moran than the rest of 'em.</p>
<p>'Now then, boys,' he says, 'we've had our flutter out. I've done my best,
and you've done yours. I've bagged one of your lot, and you've done your best
to pot me. See here,' and he lifts up the collar of his coat and shows a hole
through it, touches his head on the side, and brings away a red mark; and takes
out his watch with the case all battered in by a revolver bullet. 'You can't
say I hadn't cause to show fight,' and he points to his wife. 'Where's the man
among you that wouldn't have done the same? An Englishman's house is his
castle. What am I to expect?'</p>
<p>He looked over at Starlight, but he didn't take no notice, and made no sign.
I saw Mrs. Knightley look over at him too. It was the first time I ever seen
him look hard when there was a woman in the case, and such a one! But he kept
his face set and stern-like.</p>
<p>Then Moran breaks in&mdash;</p>
<p>'Expect, be blowed! What the &mdash;&mdash; do you expect now we've got yer
to rights; are we going to let you off after knocking over Daly? No dashed
fear, mister, we'll serve you the same way as you served him, as soon as we've
had some grub and another glass or two of your grog. You've got some fairish
stuff here.'</p>
<p>'Why, Moran,' says Mr. Knightley, still making believe to joke&mdash;and, by
George! if he could laugh then, he could sing a song with a bullet through
him&mdash;'you're getting bad-tempered since you used to be horsebreaking for
Mr. Lowe. Don't you remember that chestnut Sir Henry colt that no one else
could ride, and I backed you not to get thrown, and won a fiver? But I'm a man
of the world and know how to play a losing game at billiards as well as most
men. Look here now! Daly's dead. We can't bring him to life again, can we? If
you shoot me, you'll be nothing to the good, and have every spare man in the
three colonies at your heels. This is a game of brag, though the stakes are
high. I'll play a card. Listen. You shall have a hundred
fivers&mdash;&pound;500 in notes&mdash;by to-morrow at four o'clock, if you'll
let Mrs. Knightley and the doctor ride to Bathurst for the money. What do you
say?'</p>
<p>'D&mdash;n you and your money too,' growled Moran. 'We'll have your blood,
and nothing else. D'ye hear that? You're a dead man now; if you're not buried
by this time to-morrow, it won't be because you're not as ready for it as
Patsey is.'</p>
<p>I saw Mrs. Knightley turn round and clasp her hands; her face grew as white
as death, but she said nothing, only looked over at Starlight, and her eyes
grew bigger and bigger, while her mouth trembled just the least bit.</p>
<p>'You're off your head, Moran,' says Mr. Knightley, pulling out a cigar and
lighting it. 'But I suppose you're the chief man, and all the rest must do as
you tell them.'</p>
<p>'Suppose we talk it over,' says Starlight, very quiet, but I knew by the
first word that he spoke something was coming. 'Daly dropped, and it can't be
helped. Accidents will happen. If you play at bowls you must take rubbers. It
has been a fair fight; no one can say otherwise. Let us put it to the vote. I
propose that Mr. Knightley's offer be accepted. Not that I intend to take a
shilling of the money.'</p>
<p>'Nor me either,' says I. 'So you three chaps will have it to share between
you. I don't see that we can do better. A fight's a fight, and if Patsey got
his gruel it might have happened to Mr. Knightley himself. As for shooting in
cold blood, I'm not on, and so I tell you.'</p>
<p>'I suppose you think you and Starlight's going to boss the lot of us,
because you've been doing it fine at the Turon races along with a lot of
blasted swells as 'ud scrag us if they had the chance, and we're to take so
much a head for our dashed lives, because we're only working chaps. Not if Dan
Moran knows it. What we want is satisfaction&mdash;blood for blood&mdash;and
we're a-goin' to have it, eh, mates?'</p>
<p>Wall and Hulbert hadn't said anything before this. They were not bad chaps
underneath, but Moran was such a devil when he was raised that they didn't like
to cross him. Besides, they had a down on Mr. Knightley, and wanted to sheet it
home to him somehow. They had got to the brandy too, and it didn't make matters
any better, you take my word for it.</p>
<p>Starlight didn't speak for a minute or two. I couldn't think what he was at.
If Jim had been there we should have been right, three to three. Now we were
two to three. I knew Starlight had a good card to play, and was ready to play
it, but he was waiting on the deal. Mr. Knightley must have had some sort of
notion of the hand; he was wonderful quick at picking up the points of the
game.</p>
<p>He said nothing, and looked as cool as you please, smoking his cigar as if
he had nothing on his mind and wanted a rest. The lady sat quite still and
pale, but her beautiful eyes kept wandering round from one to another, like
some pretty creature caught in a trap. Dr. Schiller found it hard lines on him
to keep quiet all this time&mdash;he couldn't hold it in no longer.</p>
<p>'Good heafens!' he says, 'are you men, and will not say nodings when you haf
such an ovver as dis? Subbose you shood us all, what then? Will not the whole
coundry rice and hund you down like mat docks?'</p>
<p>'That won't make it any better for you, mate,' says Moran, with a grin.
'When you and he's lying under that old tree outside, it'll make no odds to yer
whether our rope's a long or a short 'un.'</p>
<p>'Quite right, Moran,' says Mr. Knightley. 'Doctor, he has you there.'</p>
<p>Starlight moved a step or two over towards him, as if he was uncertain in
his mind. Then he says to Wall and Hulbert&mdash;</p>
<p>'See here, men; you've heard what Moran says, and what I think. Which are
you going to do? To help in a brutal, cowardly murder, and never be able to
look a man in the face again, or to take this money to-morrow?&mdash;a hundred
and seventy each in notes, mind, and get away quietly&mdash;or are you going to
be led by Moran, and told what you are to do like children?'</p>
<p>'Oh come, Dan, let's take the stuff,' says Wall. 'I think it's good enough.
What's the use of being contrary? I think the Captain's right. He knows a
dashed sight more than us.'</p>
<p>'He be hanged!' says Moran, with eyes glaring and the whole of his face
working like a man in a fit. 'He's no Captain of mine, and never was. I'll
never stir from here till I have payment in blood for Daly's life. We may as
well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I've sworn to have that man's life
to-night, and have it I will.'</p>
<p>'You'll have ours first, you bloodthirsty, murdering dog,' says Starlight;
and, as he spoke, he slipped his revolver into Mr. Knightley's hand, who
covered Moran that moment. I drew mine, too, and had Wall under aim.
Starlight's repeating rifle was up like lightning.</p>
<p>Mrs. Knightley covered her eyes, the old woman screamed, and the doctor sat
down on a chair and puffed away at his meerschaum pipe.</p>
<p>'We're three to three, now,' says Starlight; 'you've only to move a finger
and you're a dead man. Wall and Hulbert can have a hand in it if they haven't
had shooting enough for one evening. Do your worst, you black-hearted brute!
I've two minds to take you and run you in myself, if it's only to give you a
lesson in manners.'</p>
<p>Moran's face grew as black as an ironbark tree after a bush fire. He raised
his revolver, and in one second we should have been in the middle of a
desperate hand-to-hand fight; and God knows how it might have ended hadn't
Hulbert struck up his arm, and spoke out like a man.</p>
<p>'It's no use, Dan, we won't stand it. You're a dashed fool and want to spoil
everything for a bit of temper. We'll take the notes and let Mrs. Knightley and
the doctor clear out for Bathurst if you'll say honour bright that you'll be at
the Black Stump by to-morrow evening at five, and won't give the police the
office.'</p>
<p>Moran, slow and sulkily, put down his hand and glared round like a dingo
with the dogs round him&mdash;as if he didn't know which to snap at first. Then
he looked at Mr. Knightley with a look of hellish rage and spite that ten
devils couldn't have improved upon, and, throwing himself down on a chair,
drank off half a tumbler of brandy.</p>
<p>'Settle it amongst yourselves, and be &mdash;&mdash; to you,' he said.
'You're all agin me now; but, by &mdash;&mdash;, I'll be square with some of ye
yet.'</p>
<p>It was all over now. Mr. Knightley took a match out of the silver match-box
at his watch-chain, and lit another cigar. I saw the tears trickling through
Mrs. Knightley's fingers. Then she turned away her head, and after a minute or
two was as calm and quiet as ever.</p>
<p>'You know your way about the place, Wall,' says Mr. Knightley, as if he was
in his own house, just the same as usual; 'run up the horses, there's a good
fellow; they're in the little horse paddock. Mrs. Knightley's is a gray, and
the doctor's is a mouse-coloured mare with a short tail; you can't mistake
them. The sooner they're off the sooner you'll handle the cash.'</p>
<p>Wall looked rather amused, but went out, and we heard him rattle off to go
round the paddock. The doctor went upstairs, and buckled on a long-necked pair
of old-fashioned spurs, and Mrs. Knightley walked away like a woman in a dream
to her own room, and soon afterwards returned in her riding-habit and hat.</p>
<p>I foraged about and found the side-saddle and bridle in the harness-room.
Everything was in tip-top order there&mdash;glass sides for keeping the dust
off the four-in-hand harness and all that kind of thing. All the bits and
stirrup-irons like silver. There wasn't much time lost in saddling-up, you
bet!</p>
<p>We watched pretty close lest Moran should take a new fancy into his head,
but he stuck to the brandy bottle, and very soon put himself from fighting or
anything else. I wasn't sorry to see it. I was well aware he was as treacherous
as a dingo, and could sham dead or anything else to gain his ends and throw
people off their guards.</p>
<p>Well, the horses were brought out, and when Mr. Knightley lifted his wife up
on to her saddle on the high-crested gray thoroughbred with a dash of Arab
blood from an old Satellite strain, I guess he was never better pleased with
anything in the world. They looked in each other's eyes for a minute, and then
the old horse started off along the road to Bathurst with his fast, springy
walk. Starlight took off his hat and bowed low in the most respectful way. Mrs.
Knightley turned in her saddle and tried to say something, but the words
wouldn't come&mdash;she could only wave her hand&mdash;and then her head went
down nearly to her saddle. The doctor scrambled on to his horse's back, and
trotted off after her. The gray moved off, shaking his head, at a beautiful,
easy, springy canter. We raised a cheer, and they swept round a corner of the
road and out of sight.</p>
<p>'You'll find these rather good, Captain,' says Mr. Knightley, handing
Starlight his cigar-case. 'There's a box upstairs in my dressing-room. If
you'll allow me I'll order in dinner. There ought to be something decent if my
old cook hasn't been frightened out of his life, but I think he has seen too
much to be put out of his way by a little shooting.'</p>
<p>'Now I think of it,' says Starlight, 'I do really feel disposed for
refreshment. I say, Wall, see if you can't get that ferocious friend of yours
into a room where he can sleep off his liquor. I really must apologise for his
bad manners; but you see how the case stands.'</p>
<p>'Perfectly, my dear fellow,' says Mr. Knightley. 'Don't mention it. I shall
always feel personally indebted to you for far more than I can express. But let
that pass for the present. What shall we do to pass the evening? You play
picquet and hazard, of course?'</p>
<p>'Do I not,' says Starlight, his eyes lighting up in a way I didn't remember.
'It's many a day since I've met with any one near my old form.'</p>
<p>'Then suppose we have a game or two,' says Mr. Knightley, 'after dinner or
supper, whichever we choose to call it. I have cards; they luckily came up the
other day. In the meantime you will find the claret very fair, and this cold
wild turkey&mdash;I shot a brace last Thursday&mdash;is not to be
despised.'</p>
<p>We had a rattling good feed, and no mistake, whatever it was. The turkey was
a grand bird, and weighed 21 lb., he told us. The cook had sent in some hot
potatoes, and chaps like us that had been riding, walking, and fighting for
twenty hours right on end had just the sort of appetite that a bird of that
kind deserved. He was as fat as butter, too. They feed on dandelion seeds at
that time of the year. It gives 'em a sort of gamy flavour such as no other
bird, wild or tame, has. To my liking the wild turkey beats the black duck
even. He's the best game bird that flies in the bush.</p>
<p>Mr. Knightley, too, now his wife was safe on her way to Bathurst, and things
seemed going well, was full of fun, and kept us all going. He helped everybody
twice over, and wouldn't hear of any one keeping the bottle standing. The night
was close rather, and we were all that thirsty it went down like mother's milk.
Wall and Hulbert got pleasant enough and joined in, now that Moran was out of
the way. He was snoring in a back room, and, like a man in the deadhouse of a
bush shanty, not likely to wake before sunrise. Mr. Knightley told us some
out-and-out good yarns, and Hulbert and Wall swore that if they'd known he was
such a good sort they'd never have thought of sticking up the place. He said he
had been quite mistaken about them, and that another time he should know better
than to volunteer for work that was not part of his duty. By that time the
claret had gone round pretty often; and without being screwed we'd all had our
tongues loosened a bit.</p>
<p>After that we lit our pipes, and we three began to play all-fours and
euchre, sometimes one pair, sometimes another. As for Mr. Knightley and
Starlight, they got out a curious filigree sort of a little card-table and
began to play some outlandish game that I didn't know, and to look very serious
over it.</p>
<p>They had notes for counters, and I could see, as I looked over every now and
then, that each man was doing all he knew to best the other. Sometimes one had
the show; sometimes the other. We got tired and had another smoke and turned
in. The beds were snug and comfortable. Mr. Knightley showed us where to go,
and we wanted a good night's rest bad enough.</p>
<p>Just before I turned in I went up to the table. They looked as keen at it as
if they'd just began, and I heard Starlight say, 'I owe you a hundred now. I'll
play you double or quits.' So I left them to it. I could see they were not on
for bed just then. Both men were cool enough, but I could see that Starlight
(and I'd never known him to touch a card before) was one of those men that
would never rise from the table as long as he had a shilling left, and would
stake everything he had in the world upon the turn of a card.</p>
<p>We all slept sound, but most of us were up at sunrise. It doesn't do for
chaps in our line to be caught napping, and the police might have got wind
where we were at work. We had our horses to look to, and to give a look round
in a general way to see if things were right.</p>
<p>Starlight and Mr. Knightley didn't turn out, they took it easy, perhaps
they'd been up later than us; anyhow, they didn't show till breakfast, when
they both made pretty fair time over the eatables.</p>
<p>My word! it was a breakfast, though we'd got a bit tired waiting for it. The
old cook had hashed up the turkey; it was stunning, almost better than the day
before. Then bacon and eggs, grilled steak, fresh bread and butter, coffee and
tea, watercresses. Really, I thought we never should stop. It was lucky the
police didn't come, or we shouldn't have done much in the fighting line, or the
runaway either. As it turned out, Sir Ferdinand wasn't so very far off the
line, but he took another road. He never had any luck somehow in following us
up, though he had some first-rate chances. Moran was off his feed, and wouldn't
come in. He took a nip and walked down to the creek. We were all glad enough to
get shut of him.</p>
<p>After breakfast and a turn round the stables, blest if Starlight and Mr.
Knightley didn't have out the cards again, and at it they went as fresh and
keen as ever. We didn't know what in the world to do with ourselves till it was
time to start to ride out to the Black Stump, where we were to meet the doctor
and collar the &pound;500. They didn't waste a minute of their time, till about
half-past twelve Starlight puts down his cards very gently, and says
he&mdash;</p>
<p>'I'm afraid we have no more time to spare. I've enjoyed the play more than I
have done anything for years. I leave you &pound;100 now in notes, and you must
take my I O U for the balance. What bank shall I pay it into?'</p>
<p>'The Australian,' says Mr. Knightley. 'At your convenience, of course.'</p>
<p>'Within a month,' says Starlight, bowing. 'And now a glass of wine and a
biscuit, it's time to be off.'</p>
<p>We had something as good, nearer the mark than that, and Moran sat down too,
and played a good knife and fork. He'd come to, after his booze, and was ready
for any fresh villainy, as usual. He didn't let on to be nasty, but he looked
sulky enough, and I saw his eye fixed on Mr. Knightley and Starlight now and
then as if he'd have given a good deal to have had them where they hadn't so
many at their backs.</p>
<h2>Chapter 46</h2>
<p>We ate well and drank better still at the lunch, although we had such a
regular tuck-out at breakfast time. Mr. Knightley wouldn't hear of any of us
shirking our liquor, and by the time we'd done all hands were pretty well on.
Moran himself began to look pleasant, or as good a sample of it as I'd ever
seen in him. Mr. Knightley could get round the devil himself, I believe. I
never saw his equals at that business; and this particular time he was in great
feather, seeing that he was likely to get out of an ugly business all right. He
was as sure of the &pound;500 in notes being there at the appointed hour as he
was of the sun setting that particular evening.</p>
<p>'I think it's a fair thing,' says Starlight at last, looking at his watch.
Mr. Knightley wasn't the first to speak, no fear. 'Take us all our time to get
to the Black Stump. We shall have to ride, too.' Moran and Wall got up and
fetched their horses. Mr. Knightley's was led up by one of his men. He was a
big handsome roan, in top condition, and the man was riding a black horse with
a tan muzzle that looked a trifle better, if anything. Mr. Knightley turned out
in boots and breeches, with a gold fox's head on his scarf, swell hunting
fashion, as they do it at home, Starlight said.</p>
<p>When Starlight's horse came up he was as lame as a tree, couldn't put his
foot to the ground; got a kick or a strain, or trod on a glass bottle or
something. Anyhow he had only three legs that he could rise a move out of.
Starlight looked rather glum. He wasn't his second best or his third best
either. All the same, a horse is a horse, and I never saw the man yet that a
lame horse didn't put out a bit.</p>
<p>'Confound it,' says he, 'what a nuisance! It's just the way with these
infernal half-bred brutes; they always let me down at the wrong time.'</p>
<p>'Look here, old fellow,' says Mr. Knightley, 'leave him behind and take this
black horse the boy's on; he's one of the finest hacks you ever crossed. I
refused sixty guineas for him the other day from Morringer.'</p>
<p>'Thanks, very much,' says Starlight, brightening up a bit; 'but I hardly
like to deprive you of him. Won't you want him yourself?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I can manage without him,' says Mr. Knightley. 'I'll let you have him
for fifty and allow you ten pounds for your screw. You can add it on to your
IOU, and pay it in with the other.'</p>
<p>We all laughed at this, and Moran said if he was dealing with Mr. Knightley
he'd get him a pound or two cheaper. But Starlight said, very serious-like,
that the arrangement would suit him very well. So he had his saddle shifted,
and the groom led back the bay and turned him loose in the paddock.</p>
<p>We mounted then, and it looked as if we were all matched for a race to the
Black Stump. Moran had a good horse, and when he set him going in the first bit
of thick timber we came to, it took a man, I tell you, to keep him in sight.
Starlight made the black horse hit out in a way that must have been a trifle
strange to him unless he'd been in training lately. As for Mr. Knightley, he
took it easy and sailed away on one side with Joe Wall and me. He played it out
cool to the last, and wasn't going to hurry himself for anybody.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour before sundown we rode up to the Black Stump. It was a
rum-looking spot, but everybody knew it for miles round. There was nothing like
it anywhere handy. It was within a reasonable distance of Bathurst, and not so
far from a place we could make to, where there was good shelter and hiding too,
if we were pushed.</p>
<p>There were two or three roads led up to it, and crossed there&mdash;one from
Bathurst, one to Turon, and another straight into the forest country, which led
range by range to Nulla Mountain. We could see on a good way ahead, and, though
there was no one at the tree when we came, a single horseman was riding along
the road for Bathurst. We all drew rein round the stump. It had been a
tremendous big old ironbark tree&mdash;nobody knew how old, but it had had its
top blown off in a thunderstorm, and the carriers had lighted so many fires
against the roots of it that it had been killed at last, and the sides were as
black as a steamer's funnel. After a bit we could make out the doctor's
short-tailed, mousy mare and him powdering along at a sort of hand gallop.</p>
<p>When he came up close, he took off his hat and made a bow. 'Chentlemen of
the roat, I salude you,' he says. 'You haf kebt your bromise to the letter, and
you will fint that Albert von Schiller has kept his. Hauptman!' says he to
Starlight, 'I delifer to you the ransom of dies wothy chentleman and his most
excellend and hoch-besahltes laty, who has much recovered from her fadigues,
and I demant his freetom.'</p>
<p>'Well done, most trust-repaying and not-ever-to-be-entirely-forgotten
herald,' says Starlight. 'I hand over to these worthy free companions the
frank-geld; isn't that the term?&mdash;and when they have counted it (for they
won't take your word or mine), the Graf here&mdash;most high-born and
high-beseeming, but uncommonly-near-ending his glorious career
magnate&mdash;will be restored to you. Very pleasant company we've found him. I
should like to have my revenge at picquet, that's all.'</p>
<p>While this was going on Starlight had collared the bundle of notes from the
doctor, and chucked it over quite careless-like to Moran. 'There it is for
you,' says he. 'You can divide it between you. Dick and I stand out this time;
and you can't say you've done badly.'</p>
<p>Moran didn't say anything, but he and Wall got off their horses and sat down
on their heels&mdash;native fashion. Then they turned to, counting out the
notes one by one. They were all fivers&mdash;so it took some time&mdash;as they
neither of 'em weren't very smart at figures, and after they'd got out twenty
or thirty they'd get boxed, like a new hand counting sheep, and have to begin
all over again. It must have been aggravating to Mr. Knightley, and he was
waiting to be let go, in a manner of speaking. He never showed it, but kept
smoking and yarning with Starlight, pointing out how grand the sun was just
a-setting on the Bulga Mountains&mdash;just for all the world as if he'd given
a picnic, and was making himself pleasant to the people that stayed
longest.</p>
<p>At long last they'd got to the end of the conning, and divided the notes.
Moran tied his up in a bunch, and rolled 'em in his poncho; but Wall crammed
his into his pocket and made 'em all stick out like a boy that's been stealing
apples. When they mounted their horses, Mr. Knightley shook hands with me and
Starlight. Then he turns round to Moran and Wall&mdash;'We're parting good
friends after all's said and done,' he says. 'Just as well matters have been
settled this way. Come, now, in cool blood, ain't you rather glad, Moran?'</p>
<p>'Dashed if I know,' growls he. 'All I know is, you're deuced well out of it;
your luck mayn't be so good another time.'</p>
<p>'Nor yours either, my friend,' says Mr. Knightley, drawing up his
bridle-rein. 'I had only a snap-shot at you when that bullet went through your
poncho, or you'd be lying alongside of Daly. However, I needn't waste my breath
talking to that brute,' he says to Starlight. 'I know well all I owe to you and
Dick Marston here. Some day I may repay it.'</p>
<p>'You mean what I owe you,' says Starlight, turning it off with a laugh.
'Never fear, you'll find that paid to your credit in the bank. We have agents
in all sorts of places. Good-bye, and a safe ride home. My respectful
compliments to Mrs. Knightley. Perhaps you'd better follow the doctor now.' The
old gentleman had got tired waiting, and ridden on slow and easy.</p>
<p>Two or three weeks after, Starlight and I were taking a ride towards the
Bogan Road, not that we was on for anything particular, but just having a turn
round for want of something else to do, when we saw a big mob of cattle coming
along, with three or four stock-riders behind 'em. Then we met a loaded dray
and team in front, that had rations and swags and a tent. The driver asked us
if we knew a good place to camp. He was a talking sort of chap, and we yarned
away with him for a bit. He told us how the boss was behind in a dogcart and
tandem, with two led horses besides. The cattle were going to take up a new run
he'd bought on the Lower Bogan, an out-and-out wild place; but he'd got the
country cheap, and thought it would pay in the end. He was going ahead after a
stage or two, but just now he was camping with them.</p>
<p>'My word, he's well in, is the cove,' says the horse-driver; 'he's got
half-a-dozen stations besides this one. He'll be one of the richest men in
Australia yet.'</p>
<p>After we saw the cattle (about a thousand head) we thought it would be a
middling day's work to 'stick up' the cove and put him through. Going to form a
new station, he'd very like have cash about, as he'd have to pay for a lot of
things on the nail just at first. If he was such a swell too, he'd have a gold
watch and perhaps a few more trifles. Anyhow, he was good for the day's
expenses, and we thought we'd try it on.</p>
<p>So we passed the cattle and rode quietly along the road till we saw his
dogcart coming; then we stopped inside a yarran scrub, just as he came
by&mdash;a square-built man he seemed to be, muffled up in a big rough coat. It
was a cool morning. We rode up sharpish, and showed our revolvers, singing out
to him to 'bail up'. He pulled up quick and stared at us. So we did at him.
Then the three of us burst out laughing&mdash;regular roared again.</p>
<p>Who should it be but old George Storefield.</p>
<p>'Well, this is a prime joke,' says he. 'I knew you were out somewhere on
this road; but I never thought I should live to be stuck up by you, Dick
Marston.'</p>
<p>I looked foolish. It was rather a stunner when you come to think of it.</p>
<p>'I beg a thousand pardons,' says Starlight. 'Ridiculous mistake. Want of
something to occupy our time. "For Satan finds some mischief still," etc. Isn't
that the way the hymn runs? Wonderfully true, isn't it? You'll accept our
apologies, Mr. Storefield, I trust. Poor Dick here will never get over it.'</p>
<p>'How was I to know? Why, George, old man, we thought it was the Governor
turned squatter, or old Billy Wentworth himself. Your trade pays better than
ours, let alone being on the square. Well, shake hands; we'll be off. You won't
tell the girls, there's a good fellow, will you?'</p>
<p>'I can't promise,' says old George; 'it's too good a joke.' Here he laughed
a good one. 'It isn't often a man gets stuck up by his friends like this. Tell
you what; come and have some lunch, and we'll talk it over.'</p>
<p>His man rode up then with the spare horse. Luckily, he was a good way
behind, as fellows will keep when they're following a trap, so that they can't
be any good when they're wanted. In this case it was just as well. He hadn't
seen anything.</p>
<p>'Hobble the horses out and put on their nose-bags, Williams,' says he, 'and
then get out the lunch. Put the things under that tree.'</p>
<p>They took out the horses, and the chap got out a basket with cold beef and
bread and half a tongue and a bottle of good whisky and water-bag.</p>
<p>We sat down on the grass, and as we'd been riding since sunrise we did
pretty well in the feed line, and had a regular good bit of fun. I never
thought old George had so much go in him; but good times had made him twice the
man he used to be.</p>
<p>After a bit he sends the groom down to the Cowall to water the horses, and,
says he&mdash;</p>
<p>'Captain, you'd better come and manage Willaroon down there, with Dick for
stockman. There's a fortune in it, and it's a good way off yet. Nobody would
think of looking for you there. You're a new chum, just out from home, you
know. Plenty of spare country. I'll send you some cattle to start you on a new
run after a bit.'</p>
<p>'If we could throw our past behind us, I'd do it, and thank God on my
knees,' said Starlight. 'It would make me almost a happy man again. But why
think of that or any other honest life in this colony now? We've debarred
ourselves from it now and for ever. Our only hope is in another
land&mdash;America&mdash;if we can get away. We shan't be long here now; we're
both sick of this accursed work.'</p>
<p>'The sooner the better,' says George, taking his hand and giving it a hearty
grip. 'And, look here, you work your way quietly down to Willaroon. That's my
place, and I'll give you a line across to the Queensland border. From there you
can get over to Townsville, and it's easy to sail from there to the islands or
any port out of reach of harm from here.'</p>
<p>'We'll tackle it next month if we're alive,' says I. So we parted.</p>
<p>Not long after this we got a letter from Jim. He'd heard all about the way
to do it from a man he'd met in Melbourne that had worked his way down overland
from the North. He said once you were there, or near there, there was little or
no chance of being interfered with. Jeanie was always in a fright every day Jim
went away lest he might be taken and not let come back. So she was always
keeping him up to the mark, making him inquire here and look out there until he
got a bit of information which told him what he wanted.</p>
<p>This man that worked in the store with him was a fast sort of card, who had
been mate of a brig cruising all about and back to Sydney with sandalwood,
beche-de-mer, and what they call island trade.</p>
<p>Well, the captain of the craft, who was part owner, had settled in his mind
that he'd trade regular with San Francisco now, and touch at Honolulu going and
coming. He was to be back at Gladstone in about three months, and then start
for California straight away.</p>
<p>This was the very thing, just made to suit us all to pieces. If we could
make out to one of the Queensland northern ports it would be easy enough to
ship under different names. Once in America, we'd be in a new world, and
there'd be nothing to stop us from leading a new life.</p>
<h2>Chapter 47</h2>
<p>When we got the notion into our heads, we set to work to carry it out. We
didn't want to leave Aileen and mother behind. So it was settled that I was to
go over and see them, and try and persuade them to go down to Melbourne and
stop with Jeanie after Jim had started.</p>
<p>Then, if we all got safe over to San Francisco, Jeanie and they could come
over by the first ship that sailed. There was no down upon them, so they could
do anything they liked. The main thing was to get Jim off safe and me and
Starlight. After that the rest might come along when they pleased. As for dad,
he was to take his own road; to go and stay as he chose. It wasn't much use
trying to make him do anything else. But he was more like to stop at the old
Hollow than anywhere else. It wouldn't have seemed home to him anywhere else,
even where he was born, I believe.</p>
<p>The first thing of all was to go to the old place and see mother and Aileen.
They were both back at the old cottage, and were a bit more comfortable now.
George Storefield had married a lady&mdash;a real lady, as Aileen
said&mdash;and, though she was a nice, good-tempered young woman as ever was,
Aileen, of course, wouldn't stay there any longer. She thought home was the
best place after all.</p>
<p>We took a couple of days figuring it out at the Hollow. Starlight had a map,
and we plotted it out, and marked all the stages which could be safely
made&mdash;went over all the back tracks and cross-country lines; some we had
travelled before, and others of which we knew pretty well from hearsay.</p>
<p>After we'd got all this cut and dry, I started away one beautiful sunshiny
morning to ride over to Rocky Flat. I remember the day as well as yesterday,
because I took notice of it at the time, and had better cause to remember it
before all was over. Everything looked so lovely as I began to clear the foot
hills of Nulla Mountain. The birds seemed to chirp and whistle gayer than they
ever did before. The dewdrops on the grass and all the twigs and shoots of the
trees looked as if it was covered with diamonds and rubies as the sun began to
shine and melt some of them. My horse stepped along limber and free. 'O Lord,'
I says to myself out aloud, 'what a happy cove I might be if I could start
fresh&mdash;knowing what I know&mdash;and not having all these things against
me!'</p>
<p>When I got on to the tableland above Rocky Flat I took a good look at the
whole place. Everything was as quiet and peaceful as if nothing had ever
happened within miles of it&mdash;as if I hadn't had Goring's handcuffs on
me&mdash;as if Jim hadn't had the bullets whistling round him, and risked his
life on an unbridled horse&mdash;as if the four dead men had not lain staring
up to the sky in the gully up yonder for days before they were found and
buried.</p>
<p>But now it looked as if only two or three people had ever been there from
the beginning of the world. The wild ducks swam and splashed in the little
waterhole above the house. Two or three of the cows were walking down to the
creek, as quiet and peaceable as you please. There was some poultry at the
back, and the little garden was done up that nicely as it hadn't been for many
a day.</p>
<p>After I'd pretty well settled in my own mind that there was no one anext or
anigh the old place, I drew up by degrees, bit by bit, and sneaked across the
creek. I was just making for the barn when I saw two horsemen pop up sudden
round the back of the house and ride towards the front gate. I saw with half an
eye they were Sir Ferdinand Morringer and a trooper.</p>
<p>Lucky for me they were looking up the gully instead of my way, and, though
my heart nearly stood still, I rode as hard as I could lick for the gate of the
barn, which was betwixt me and them. They never looked round. They were too
much taken up with watching the spot where Hagan and his lot were found. I had
just time to chevy straight into the barn and pull off my saddle and bridle and
hide under the hay when they shifted full towards where I'd been and then hung
up their horses. The trooper tied his to a dead branch of a tree, and then went
moving about. I was mortally afraid of his stumbling against something and
spoiling the whole affair.</p>
<p>It seems Sir Ferdinand had never given up the notion of our turning up at
Rocky Flat some day or other; so he used to take a turn himself that way every
now and again on the chance, and a very good chance it nearly turned out to be.
Besides this, it seems since he'd heard of her being at the ball at Turon he'd
taken a great fancy to Aileen, and used to talk to her as much as she'd let
him, when she was at George Storefield's and any other place where he met her.
He wouldn't have had much chance of saying the second word, only he was a
good-natured, amusing sort, and always as respectful to her as if she'd been a
lady. Besides, Aileen had a kind of fancy that it might make things no worse
for us if she was civil to him. Any way, she thought, as women will do, that
she might get something out of him perhaps once in a way that would be of use
to us. I don't believe as it would make a scrap of difference one way or the
other. And, like people who try to be too clever, she was pretty near being
caught in her own trap this time. Not that I blame the poor thing, she did all
for the best, and would have given the eyes out of her head, I believe, to have
done us real good, and seen us clear of all our troubles.</p>
<p>Well, she brings a chair out on the verandah, and Sir Ferdinand he sat down
on a bench there for half-an-hour, talking away and laughing, just as gentlemen
will to pretty girls, no matter who they are. And I could see Aileen look up
and laugh now and then, pleased like. She couldn't help it. And there was I
stuck in the confounded barn among the straw all the time looking out through
one of the cracks and wondering if he was ever going to clear out. Sometimes I
thought the trooper, who was getting tired of dodging about doing nothing,
couldn't be off seeing my horse's tracks leading slap into the barn door. But
he was thinking of something else, or else wasn't much in the tracking line.
Some men would see a whole army of fresh tracks, as plain as print, right under
their noses and wouldn't drop down to anything.</p>
<p>However, last of all I saw him unhitch his horse and take the bridle on his
arm, and then Aileen put on her hat and walked up to the top of the ridge along
the stony track with him. Then I saw him mount and start off at a rattling good
bat along the road to Turon and the trooper after him. I felt all right again
then, and watched Aileen come slowly down the road again with her head down,
quite thoughtful like, very different from the way she went up. She didn't stop
at the house, but walked straight down to the barn and came in at the door. I
wondered what she would do when she saw my horse. But she didn't start, only
said&mdash;</p>
<p>'You may come out now, Dick; I knew you were here. I saw you ride in just as
Sir Ferdinand and the trooper came up.'</p>
<p>'So that's why you were making yourself so pleasant,' says I laughingly. 'I
mustn't tell Starlight, I suppose, or we shall be having a new yarn in the
newspapers&mdash;"Duel between Sir Ferdinand Morringer and Captain
Starlight."'</p>
<p>She laughed too, and then looked sad and serious like again.</p>
<p>'I wonder if we shall ever have an end to this wretched hide-and-seek work.
God knows I would do anything that an honest girl could do for you boys and
him, but it sometimes looks dark enough, and I have dreadful fears that all
will be in vain, and that we are fated to death and ruin at the end.'</p>
<p>'Come, come, don't break down before the time,' I said. 'It's been a close
shave, though; but Sir Ferdinand won't be back for a bit, so we may as well
take it easy. I've got a lot to say to you.'</p>
<p>'He said he wouldn't be back this way till Friday week,' says she. 'He has
an escort to see to then, and he expected to be at Stony Creek in a couple of
hours from this. He'll have to ride for it.'</p>
<p>We walked over to the house. Neither of us said anything for a bit. Mother
was sitting in her old chair by the fire knitting. Many a good pair of woollen
socks she'd sent us, and many's the time we'd had call to bless her and her
knitting&mdash;as we sat our horses, night after night, in a perishing frost,
or when the rain set in that run of wet winters we had, when we'd hardly a dry
stitch on us by the week together, when we had enough of them and the neck
wrappers, I expect plenty of others round about were glad to get 'em. It was
partly for good nature, for mother was always a kind-hearted poor soul as ever
was, and would give away the shoes off her feet&mdash;like most Irish people
I've met&mdash;to any one that wanted them worse than herself, and partly for
the ease it gave her mind to be always doing something steady like. Mother
hadn't book-learning, and didn't always understand the things Aileen read to
her. She was getting too old to do much in the house now. But her eyes were
wonderful good still, and this knitting was about the greatest pleasure she had
left in the world. If anything had happened to stop her from going on with
that, I don't believe she would have lived a month.</p>
<p>Her poor old face brightened up when she seen me, and for a few minutes
you'd have said no thought of trouble could come anigh her. Then the tears
rolled down her cheeks, and I could see her lips moving, though she did not
speak the words. I knew what she was doing, and if that could have kept us
right we'd never have gone wrong in the world. But it was to be, I suppose.</p>
<p>Mother was a deal older-looking, and couldn't move about as well as she did.
Aileen said she'd often sit out in the sun for an hour together and watch her
walking up the garden, or putting up the calves, and carrying in the water from
the creek, and say nothing. Sometimes she thought her mind was going a bit, and
then again she'd seem as sensible as ever she was. To-day, after a bit, she
came round and talked more and asked about the neighbours, seemed more curious
like, than she'd done, Aileen said, for many a long day.</p>
<p>'You must have something to eat, Dick,' says Aileen; 'it's a long ride
from&mdash;from where we know&mdash;and what with one thing and another I
daresay you've an appetite. Let me see what there is. Mrs. Storefield sent us
over a quarter of veal from the farm yesterday, and we've plenty of bacon of
our own. Mother and I live half our time on it and the eggs. I'm making quite a
fortune by the butter lately. These diggings are wonderful places to send up
the price of everything we can grow.'</p>
<p>So she got out the frying-pan, and she and I and mother had some veal chops,
with a slice or two of bacon to give it a flavour. My word! they were good
after a forty-mile ride, and we'd had nothing but corned beef in the Hollow
lately. Fresh butter and milk too; it was a treat. We had cows enough at the
Hollow, but we didn't bother ourselves milking; bread and beef and tea, with a
glass of grog now and then, was the general run of our grub.</p>
<p>We had a talk about the merry time at the Turon races, and Aileen laughed in
spite of herself at the thought of Starlight walking down the ballroom to be
introduced to her, and being taken up to all the swell people of the place. 'He
looked grander than any of them, to my fancy,' said she; 'and oh! what a cruel
shame it seems that he should ever have done what keeps him from going among
his equals as he was born to do. Then I should never have seen him, I suppose,
and a thousand times better too. I'd give up every hope of seeing him again in
this world, God knows how cheerfully, if it would serve him or help his
escape.'</p>
<p>'I'm down here now to see you about the same escape,' I said; and then I
told her about Jim's letter, and what he said about the mate of the ship. She
listened for a good while patiently, with her hand in mine, like we used to sit
in old days, when we were young and happy and alive&mdash;alive, not dead men
and women walking about and making believe to live. So I told her how we made
it up to meet somewhere near the Queensland border. Jim to come up the Murray
from Melbourne, and so on to the Darling, and we to make across for the Lower
Bogan. If we could carry this out all right&mdash;and it looked pretty
likely&mdash;the rest of the game would be easy; and once on blue water&mdash;O
my God, what new creatures we should all be!</p>
<p>Aileen threw her arms round my neck and sobbed and cried like a child; she
couldn't speak for a bit, and when she looked up her eyes seemed to have a
different kind of look in them&mdash;a far-away, dreamy sort of light from what
I'd ever noticed in them.</p>
<p>'It may come about,' she said, 'Dick. I've prayed whole nights through and
vowed my life to the Blessed Virgin. She may accept the service of my years
that are to come. It may be permitted after all the sins of our people.'</p>
<p>After this she dried her eyes and went to her room for a bit, while I had a
quiet, easy sort of talk with mother, she saying a word or two now and then,
and looking at me most of the time, as if that was enough without talking.</p>
<p>Then Aileen came out of her room with her habit and hat on. 'Run up my
horse, Dick,' she says, 'and I'll take you over to see George Storefield's new
place. A ride will do me good, and I daresay you're not tired.'</p>
<p>I caught her horse and saddled him for her, and off we went down the old
track we knew so well all our lives.</p>
<p>I told her all about our lark with old George, and how good he'd been
through it all; besides promising to give us a lift through his country when we
made the grand start. She said it was just like him&mdash;that he was the
kindest soul in the world, and the most thoughtful. The new Mrs. Storefield had
been very civil and friendly to her, and told her she knew George's feeling
towards her, and respected it. But Aileen never could feel at home in the grand
new house now, and only would go to see old Mrs. Storefield, who still lived in
the family cottage, and found it the best suited to her. So we yarned away till
we got in sight of the place. When I saw the new two-story stone house I was
regular struck all of a heap.</p>
<p>Old George had got on in the world and no mistake. He'd worked early and
late, always been as steady as a rock, and had looked ahead instead of taking
his pleasure straight off when he got the first few hundred pounds together.
He'd seen fat cattle must be dear and scarce for years to come. Noticed, too,
that however cheap a far-away bit of country was held, sometimes bought for
&pound;200 or &pound;300, it always rose in value year by year. So with store
cattle. Now and again they'd fall to nothing. Then he'd buy a whole lot of poor
milkers' calves about Burrangong, or some of those thick places where they
never fattened, for &pound;1 a head or less, and send them away to his runs in
the Lachlan. In six months you wouldn't know 'em. They'd come down well-grown
fat cattle in a year or two, and be worth their &pound;6 or &pound;8 a
head.</p>
<p>The same way with land; he bought up all the little bits of allotments with
cottages on them round Paramatta and Windsor way and Campbelltown&mdash;all
them old-fashioned sleepy old places near Sydney, for cash, and cheap enough.
The people that had them, and had lived a pokey life in them for many a year,
wanted the money to go to the diggings with, and quite right too. Still, and
all this land was rising in value, and George's children, if he had any, would
be among the richest people in the colony.</p>
<p>After he'd married Miss Oldham&mdash;they were Hawkesbury people, her
grandfather, old Captain Oldham, was one of the officers in the first regiment
that came out&mdash;he didn't see why he shouldn't have as good a house as any
one else. So he had a gentleman up from Sydney that drew plans, and he had a
real stone house built, with rooms upstairs, and furniture to match, a new
garden, and a glass house at the side, for all the world like some of them
grand places in Darling Point, near Sydney.</p>
<p>Aileen wouldn't go in, and you may be sure I didn't want to, but we rode all
round the place, a little way off, and had a real good look at everything.
There wasn't a gentleman in the country had better outbuildings of all sorts.
It was a real tip-top place, good enough for the Governor himself if he came to
live up the country. All the old fencing had been knocked down, and new
railings and everything put up. Some of the scraggy trees had been cleared
away, and all the dead wood burned. I never thought the old place could have
showed out the way it did. But money can do a lot. It ain't everything in this
world. But there's precious little it won't get you, and things must be very
bad it won't mend. A man must have very little sense if he don't see as he gets
older that character and money are the two things he's got to be carefullest of
in this world. If he's not particular to a shade about either or both of 'em,
he'll find his mistake.</p>
<p>After we'd had a good look round and seen the good well-bred stock in the
paddocks, the growing crops all looking first-rate, everything well fed and
hearty, showing there was no stint of grub for anything, man or beast, we rode
away from the big house entrance and came opposite the slip-rails on the flat
that led to the old cottage.</p>
<p>'Wouldn't you like to go in just for a minute, Dick?' says Aileen.</p>
<p>I knew what she was thinking of.</p>
<p>I was half a mind not, but then something seemed to draw me, and I was off
my horse and had the slip-rail down before I knew where I was.</p>
<p>We rode up to the porch just outside the verandah where George's father had
planted the creeping roses; big clusters of bloom they used to have on 'em when
I was a boy. He showed 'em to me, I remember, and said what fine climbers they
were. Now they were all over the porch, and the verandah, and the roof of the
cottage, all among the shingles. But Mrs. Storefield wouldn't have 'em cut
because her old man had planted 'em. She came out to see us.</p>
<p>'Well, Ailie, child,' says she, 'come along in, don't sit there on your
horse. Who's this you've got with you? Oh! it's you, Dick, is it? My eyes ain't
as good as they were. Well, come along in too. You're on the wrong road, and
worse 'll come of it. But come along in, I'm not going to be the one to hunt
you. I remember old times when you were a little toddling chap, as bold as a
lion, and no one dreamt you'd grow up to be the wild chap you are. Gracey's
inside, I think. She's as big a fool about ye as ever.'</p>
<p>I very near broke down at this. I could stand hard usage, and send back as
good as I got; but this good old woman, that had no call to think anything of
me, but that I'd spoiled her daughter's chance of marrying well and
respectably&mdash;when she talked to me this way, I came close up to making a
fool of myself.</p>
<p>We walked in. Gracey was sewing away in the little parlour, where there
always used to be a nosegay when I was a boy, and it was that clean and neat I
was afraid to go into it, and never easy till I got out again. There she sat as
sober-looking and steady as if she'd been there for five years, and meant to be
for five years more. She wasn't thinking of anybody coming, but when she looked
up and saw me her face changed all of a sudden, and she jumped up and dropped
her work on the floor.</p>
<p>'Why, whatever brings you here, Dick?' she said. 'Don't you know it's
terribly dangerous? Sir Ferdinand is always about here now. He stayed at
George's new house last night. Wasn't he at Rocky Flat to-day?'</p>
<p>'Yes, but he won't be back for a week. He told Aileen here he wouldn't.'
Here I looked at them both.</p>
<p>'Aileen's carrying on quite a flirtation with Sir Ferdinand,' says Gracey.
'I don't know what some one else would say if he saw everything.'</p>
<p>'Doesn't he talk to any one when he comes here, or make himself pleasant?' I
said. 'Perhaps there's more than one in the game.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps there is,' says Gracey; 'but he thinks, I believe, that he can get
something out of us girls about you and your goings on, and where you plant;
and we think we're quite as clever as he is, and might learn something useful
too. So that's how the matter lies at present. Are you going to be
jealous?'</p>
<p>'Not a bit in the world,' I said, 'even if I had the right. I'll back you
two, as simple as you look, against any inspector of police from here to South
Australia.'</p>
<p>After this we began to talk about other things, and I told Gracey all about
our plans and intentions. She listened very quiet and steady to it all, and
then she said she thought something might come of it. Anyhow, she would go
whenever I sent for her to come, no matter where.</p>
<p>'What I've said to you, Dick, I've said for good and all. It may be in a
month or two, or it may be years and years. But whenever the time comes, and we
have a chance, a reasonable chance, of living peaceably and happily, you may
depend upon my keeping my word if I'm alive.'</p>
<p>We three had a little more talk together, and Aileen and I mounted and rode
home.</p>
<p>It was getting on dusk when we started. They wanted us to stop, but I
daren't do it. It was none too safe as it was, and it didn't do to throw a
chance away. Besides, I didn't want to be seen hanging about George's place.
There was nobody likely to know about Aileen and me riding up together and
stopping half-an-hour; but if it came to spending the evening, there was no
saying who might have ears and eyes open. At home I could have my horse ready
at a minute's warning, and be off like a shot at the first whisper of
danger.</p>
<p>So off we went. We didn't ride very fast back. It was many a day since we
had ridden over that ground together side by side. It might be many a day,
years perhaps, before we did the same thing again. Perhaps never! Who was to
know? In the risks of a life like mine, I might never come back&mdash;never set
eyes again upon the sister that would have given her life for mine! Never watch
the stars glitter through the forest-oak branches, or hear the little creek
ripple over the slate bar as it did to-night.</p>
<h2>Chapter 48</h2>
<p>We rode along the old track very quiet, talking about old times&mdash;or
mostly saying nothing, thinking our own thoughts. Something seemed to put it
into my head to watch every turn in the track&mdash;every tree and bush by the
roadside&mdash;every sound in the air&mdash;every star in the sky. Aileen rode
along at last with her head drooped down as if she hadn't the heart to hold it
up. How hard it must have seemed to her to think she didn't dare even to ride
with her own brother in the light of day without starting at every bush that
stirred&mdash;at every footstep, horse or man, that fell on her ear!</p>
<p>There wasn't a breath of air that night. Not a leaf stirred&mdash;not a
bough moved of all the trees in the forest that we rode through. A 'possum
might chatter or a night-owl cry out, but there wasn't any other sound, except
the ripple of the creek over the stones, that got louder and clearer as we got
nearer Rocky Flat. There was nothing like a cloud in the sky even. It wasn't an
over light night, but the stars shone out like so many fireballs, and it was
that silent any one could almost have fancied they heard the people talking in
the house we left, though it was miles away.</p>
<p>'I sometimes wonder,' Aileen says, at last, raising up her head, 'if I had
been a man whether I should have done the same things you and Jim have, or
whether I should have lived honestly and worked steadily like George over
there. I think I should have done so, I really do; that nothing would have
tempted me to take what was not my own&mdash;or to&mdash;to&mdash;do other
things. I don't think it is in my nature somehow.'</p>
<p>'I don't say as you would, Ailie,' I put in; 'but there's many things to be
thought of when you come to reckon what a boy sees, and how he's brought up in
the bush. It's different with girls&mdash;though I've known some of them that
were no great shakes either, and middling handy among the clearskins too.'</p>
<p>'It's hard to say,' she went on, more as if she was talking to herself than
to me; 'I feel that. Bad example&mdash;love of pleasure&mdash;strong
temptation&mdash;evil company&mdash;all these are heavy weights to drag down
men's souls to hell. Who knows whether I should have been better than the
thousands, the millions, that have fallen, that have taken the broad road that
leads to destruction. Oh! how dreadful it seems to think that when once a man
has sinned in some ways in this world there's no turning back&mdash;no
hope&mdash;no mercy&mdash;only long bitter years of prison life&mdash;worse
than death; or, if anything can be worse, a felon's death; a doom dark and
terrible, dishonouring to those that die and to those that live. Oh that my
prayers may avail&mdash;not my prayers only, but my life's service&mdash;my
life's service.'</p>
<p>Next morning I was about at daybreak and had my horse fed and saddled up
with the bridle on his neck, ready all but slipping the bit into his mouth, in
case of a quick start. I went and helped Aileen to milk her cows, nine or ten
of them there were, a fairish morning's work for one girl; mothering the
calves, bailing up, leg-roping, and all the rest of it. We could milk well, all
three of us, and mother too, when she was younger. Women are used to cattle in
Ireland, and England too. The men don't milk there, I hear tell. That wouldn't
work here. Women are scarce in the regular bush, and though they'll milk for
their own good and on their own farms, you'll not get a girl to milk, when
she's at service, for anybody else.</p>
<p>One of the young cows was a bit strange with me, so I had to shake a stick
at her and sing out 'Bail up' pretty rough before she'd put her head in. Aileen
smiled something like her old self for a minute, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>'That comes natural to you now, Dick, doesn't it?'</p>
<p>I stared for a bit, and then burst out laughing. It was a rum go, wasn't it?
The same talk for cows and Christians. That's how things get stuck into the
talk in a new country. Some old hand like father, as had been assigned to a
dairy settler, and spent all his mornings in the cowyard, had taken to the bush
and tried his hand at sticking up people. When they came near enough of course
he'd pop out from behind a tree in a rock, with his old musket or a pair of
pistols, and when he wanted 'em to stop 'Bail up, d&mdash;&mdash; yer,' would
come a deal quicker and more natural-like to his tongue than 'Stand.' So 'bail
up' it was from that day to this, and there'll have to be a deal of change in
the ways of the colonies and them as come from 'em before anything else takes
its place, between the man that's got the arms and the man that's got the
money.</p>
<p>After we'd turned out the cows we put the milk into the little dairy. How
proud Jim and I used to be because we dug out the cellar part, and built the
sod wall round the slabs! Father put on the thatch; then it was as cool and
clean as ever. Many a good drink of cold milk we had there in the summers that
had passed away. Well, well, it's no use thinking of those sort of things.
They're dead and gone, like a lot of other things and people&mdash;like I shall
be before long, if it comes to that.</p>
<p>We had breakfast pretty comfortable and cheerful. Mother looked pleased and
glad to see me once more, and Aileen had got on her old face again, and was
partly come round to her old ways.</p>
<p>After breakfast Aileen and I went into the garden and had a long talk over
the plan we had chalked out for getting away to Queensland. I got out a map
Starlight had made and showed her the way we were going to head, and why he
thought it more likely to work than he had done before. I was to make my way
down the Macquarie and across by Duck Creek, George's station, Willaroon; start
from there with a mob of cattle to Queensland as drover or anything that would
suit my book.</p>
<p>Jim was to get on to one of the Murray River boats at Swan Hill, and stick
to her till he got a chance to go up the Darling with an Adelaide boat to
Bourke. He could get across from there by Cunnamulla towards Rockhampton, and
from there we were safe to find plenty of vessels bound for the islands or San
Francisco. We had hardly cared where, as far as that goes, as long as we got
clear away from our own country.</p>
<p>As soon as Jeanie got a word from Jim that he'd sailed and was clear of
Australia, she'd write up to Aileen, who was to go down to Melbourne, and take
mother with her. They could stop with Jeanie until they got a message from San
Francisco to say he'd safely arrived there. After that they could start by the
first steamer. They'd have money enough to take their passages and something
handsome in cash when they got to land.</p>
<p>Aileen agreed to it all, but in a curious sort of way. 'It looked well,' she
said, 'and might be carried out, particularly as we were all going to work
cautiously and with such a lot of preparation.' Everything that she could do
would be done, we might be sure; but though she had prayed and sought aid from
the Blessed Virgin and the saints&mdash;fasting and on her bare knees, night
after night&mdash;she had not been able to get one gleam of consolation.
Everything looked very dark, and she had a terrible feeling of anxiety and
dread about the carrying it out. But she didn't want to shake my courage, I
could see; so she listened and smiled and cheered me up a bit at the end, and I
rode away, thinking there was a good show for us after all.</p>
<p>I got back to the Hollow right enough, and for once in a way it seemed as if
the luck was on our side. Maybe it was going to turn&mdash;who was to know?
There had been men who had been as deep in it as any of us that had got clean
away to other countries and lived safe and comfortable to the day of their
death&mdash;didn't die so soon either&mdash;lived to a good round age, and had
wives and children round them that never knew but what they'd been as good as
the best. That wouldn't be our case; but still if we once were able to put the
sea between us and our old life the odds would be all in our favour instead of
being a hundred to one that we weren't placed and no takers.</p>
<p>Starlight was glad enough to see me back, and like everything he tackled,
had been squaring it all for our getting away with head and hand. We wanted to
take everything with us that could do us any good, naturally. Father and he had
made it right with some one they knew at Turon to take the gold and give them a
price for it&mdash;not all it was worth, but something over three-fourths
value. The rest he was to keep for his share, for trouble and risk. There was
some risk, no doubt, in dealing with us, but all the gold that was bought in
them days wasn't square, not by a lot. But there was no way of swearing to it.
Gold was gold, and once it was in the banks it was lumped up with the rest.
There was a lot of things to be thought of before we regularly made a move for
good and all; but when you make up your mind for a dart, it's wonderful how
things shape. We hadn't much trouble dividing the gold, and what cash there was
we could whack easy enough. There was the live stock that was running in the
Hollow, of course. We couldn't well take them with us, except a few of the
horses. We made a deal at last with father for them. He took my share and
Starlight's, and paid us in cash out of his share of the notes. All we wanted
was a couple of horses each, one to carry a pack, one to ride.</p>
<p>As for dad, he told us out, plump and plain, that he wasn't going to shift.
The Hollow was good enough for him, and there he was going to stop. If Jim and
I and Starlight chose to try and make blank emigrants of ourselves, well and
good. He didn't see as they'd have such a rosy time getting over to these new
townships on the other side. We might get took in, and wish we was back again
before all was said and done. But some people could never let well alone. Here
we had everything that any man in his senses could wish for, and we wasn't
contented. Every one was going to cut away and leave him; he'd be all by
himself, with no one but the dog for company, and be as miserable as a
bandicoot; but no one cared a blank brass farden about that.</p>
<p>'Come with us, governor,' says Starlight, 'have a cruise round the world,
and smell salt water again. You've not been boxed up in the bush all your life,
though you've been a goodish while there. Make a start, and bring old Crib
too.'</p>
<p>'I'm too old and getting stiff in the j'ints,' says dad, brightening up a
bit, 'or I don't say as I wouldn't. Don't mind my growling. But I'm bound to be
a bit lonely like when you are all drawed off the camp. No! take your own way
and I'll take mine.'</p>
<p>'Next Monday ought to see us off,' says Starlight. 'We have got the gold and
cash part all right. I've had that money paid to Knightley's credit in the
Australian Bank I promised him, and got a receipt for it.'</p>
<p>'That's just like yer,' says father, 'and a rank soft thing for a man as has
seen the world to drop into. Losin' yer share of the five hundred quid, and
then dropping a couple of hundred notes at one gamble, besides buying a horse
yer could have took for nothing. He'll never bring twenty pound again,
neither.'</p>
<p>'Always pay my play debts,' says Starlight. 'Always did, and always will. As
for the horse&mdash;a bargain, a bargain.'</p>
<p>'And a dashed bad bargain too. Why didn't ye turn parson instead of taking
to the bush?' says father, with a grin. 'Dashed if I ain't seen some parsons
that could give you odds and walk round ye at horse-dealin'.'</p>
<p>'You take your own way, Ben, and I'll take mine,' says Starlight rather
fierce, and then father left off and went to do something or other, while us
two took our horses and rode out. We hadn't a long time to be in the old Hollow
now. It had been a good friend to us in time of need, and we was sorry in a
kind of way to leave it. We were going to play for a big stake, and if we lost
we shouldn't have another throw in.</p>
<p>Our horses were in great buckle now; they hadn't been doing much lately. I
had the one I'd brought with me, and a thoroughbred brown horse that had been
broken in the first season we came there.</p>
<p>Starlight was to ride Rainbow, of course, and he had great picking before he
made up his mind what to choose for second horse. At last he pitched upon a
thoroughbred bay mare named Locket that had been stolen from a mining township
the other side of the country. She was the fastest mare they'd ever
bred&mdash;sound, and a weight-carrier too.</p>
<p>'I think I'll take Locket after all,' says he, after thinking about it best
part of an hour. 'She's very fast and a stayer. Good-tempered too, and the old
horse has taken up with her. It will be company for him.'</p>
<p>'Take your own way,' I said, 'but I wouldn't chance her. She's known to a
lot of jockey-boys and hangers-on. They could swear to that white patch on her
neck among a thousand.'</p>
<p>'If you come to that, Rainbow is not an every-day horse, and I can't leave
him behind, can I? I'll ship him, if I can, that's more. But it won't matter
much, for we'll have to take back tracks all the way. You didn't suppose we
were to ride along the mail road, did you?'</p>
<p>'I didn't suppose anything,' says I, 'but that we were going to clear out
the safest way we could. If we're to do the swell business we'd better do it
apart, or else put an advertisement into the "Turon Star" that Starlight,
Marston, and Co. are giving up business and going to leave the district, all
accounts owing to be sent in by a certain date.'</p>
<p>'A first-rate idea,' says he. 'I'm dashed if I don't do it. There's nothing
like making one's exit in good form. How savage Morringer will be! Thank you
for the hint, Dick.'</p>
<p>There was no use talking to him when he got into this sort of humour. He was
the most mad, reckless character I ever came across, and any kind of checking
only seemed to make him worse. So I left him alone, for fear he should want to
do something more venturesome still, and went on with my packing and getting
ready for the road.</p>
<p>We fixed up to start on the Monday, and get as far away the first couple of
days as we could manage. We expected to get a good start by making a great push
the first day or two, and, as the police would be thrown off the scent in a way
we settled&mdash;and a good dodge it was&mdash;we should have all the more time
to be clear of New South Wales before they regularly dropped that we were
giving them leg bail for it.</p>
<p>The Sunday before Starlight started away by himself, taking a couple of good
horses with him&mdash;one he led, and a spare saddle too. He took nothing but
his revolver, and didn't say where he was going, but I pretty well guessed to
say good-bye to Aileen. Just as he started he looked back and says&mdash;</p>
<p>'I'm going for a longish ride to-day, Dick, but I shall be here late if I'm
back at all. If anything happens to me my share of what there is I give to her,
if she will take it. If not, do the best you can with it for her benefit.'</p>
<p>He didn't take Warrigal with him, which I was sorry for, as the half-caste
and I didn't hit it well together, and when we were by ourselves he generally
managed to do or say something he knew I didn't like. I kept my hands off him
on account of Starlight, but there was many a time my fingers itched to be at
him, and I could hardly keep from knocking some of the sulkiness out of him.
This day, somehow, I was not in the best of tempers myself. I had a good lot on
my mind. Starting away seems always a troublesome, bothering sort of thing, and
if a man's at all inclined to be cranky it'll come out then.</p>
<p>Next day we were going to start on a long voyage, in a manner of speaking,
and whether we should have a fair wind or the vessel of our fortune would be
wrecked and we go down with it no one could say. This is how it happened. One
of the horses was bad to catch, and took a little trouble in the yard. Most
times Warrigal was quiet enough with 'em, but when he got regular into a rage
he'd skin a horse alive, I really believe. Anyhow, he began to hammer the colt
with a roping-pole, and as the yard was that high that no beast could jump it
he had him at his mercy. I wouldn't have minded a lick or two, but he went on
and on, nearly knocking the poor brute down every time, till I could stand it
no longer, and told him to drop it.</p>
<p>He gave me some saucy answer, until at last I told him I'd make him. He
dared me, and I rushed at him. I believe he'd have killed me that minute if
he'd had the chance, and he made a deuced good offer at it.</p>
<p>He stuck to his roping-stick&mdash;a good, heavy-ended gum sapling, six or
seven feet long&mdash;and as I came at him he struck at my head with such
vengeance that, if it had caught me fair, I should never have kicked. I made a
spring to one side, and it hit me a crack on the shoulder that wasn't a good
thing in itself. I was in at him before he could raise his hands, and let him
have it right and left.</p>
<p>Down he went and the stick atop of him. He was up again like a wild cat, and
at me hammer and tongs&mdash;but he hadn't the weight, though he was quick and
smart with his hands. I drew off and knocked him clean off his pins. Then he
saw it wasn't good enough, and gave it best.</p>
<p>'Never mind, Dick Marston,' says he, as he walked off; and he fixed his eyes
on me that savage and deadly-looking, with the blood running down his face,
that I couldn't help shivering a bit, 'you'll pay for this. I owe it you and
Jim, one a piece.'</p>
<p>'Confound you,' I said, 'it's all your own fault. Why couldn't you stop
ill-using the horse? You don't like being hit yourself. How do you think he
likes it?'</p>
<p>'What business that of yours?' he said. 'You mind your work and I'll mind
mine. This is the worst day's work you've done this year, and so I tell
you.'</p>
<p>He went away to his gunyah then, and except doing one or two things for
Starlight would not lift his hand for any one that day.</p>
<p>I was sorry for it when I came to think. I daresay I might have got him
round with a little patience and humbugging. It's always a mistake to lose your
temper and make enemies; there's no knowing what harm they may do ye. People
like us oughtn't to throw away a chance, even with a chap like Warrigal.
Besides, I knew it would vex Starlight, and for his sake I would have given a
trifle it hadn't happened. However, I didn't see how Warrigal could do me or
Jim any harm without hurting him, and I knew he'd have cut off his hand rather
than any harm should come to Starlight that he could help.</p>
<p>So I got ready. Dad and I had our tea together pretty comfortable, and had a
longish talk. The old man was rather down in the mouth for him. He said he
somehow didn't expect the fakement to turn out well. 'You're going away,' he
said, 'from where you're safe, and there's a many things goes against a man in
our line, once he's away from his own beat. You never know how you may be given
away. The Captain's all right here, when he's me to look after him, though he
does swear at me sometimes; but he was took last time. He was out on his own
hook, and it's my belief he'll be took this time if he isn't very careful. He's
a good man to fight through things when once he's in the thick of 'em, but he
ain't careful enough to keep dark and close when the play isn't good. You draw
along steady by yourself till you meet Jim&mdash;that's my advice to ye.'</p>
<p>'I mean to do that. I shall work my way down to old George's place, and get
on with stock or something till we all meet at Cunnamulla. After that there
ain't much chance of these police here grabbing us.'</p>
<p>'Unless you're followed up,' says the old man. 'I've known chaps to go a
deuce of a way, once they got on the track, and there's getting some smart
fellows among 'em now&mdash;native-born chaps as'll be as good at picking up
the tracks as you and Jim.'</p>
<p>'Well, we must take our chance. I'm sorry, for one thing, that I had that
barney with Warrigal. It was all his fault. But I had to give him a hardish
crack or two. He'd turn dog on me and Jim, and in a minute, if he saw his way
without hurting Starlight.'</p>
<p>'He can't do it,' says dad; 'it's sink or swim with the lot of you. And he
dursn't either, not he,' says father, beginning to growl out his words. 'If I
ever heard he'd given away any one in the lot I'd have his life, if I had to
poleaxe him in George Street. He knows me too.'</p>
<p>We sat yarning away pretty late. The old man didn't say it, but I made out
that he was sorry enough for that part of his life which had turned out so bad
for us boys, and for mother and Aileen. Bad enough he was in a kind of way, old
dad, but he wasn't all bad, and I believe if he could have begun again and
thought of what misery he was going to bring on the lot of us he would never
have gone on the cross. It was too late, too late now, though, to think of
that.</p>
<p>Towards morning I heard the old dog growl, and then the tramp of a horse's
feet. Starlight rode up to the fire and let his horse go, then walked straight
into his corner and threw himself down without speaking. He had had a precious
long ride, and a fast one by the look of his horse. The other one he had let go
as soon as he came into the Hollow; but none of the three would be a bit the
worse after a few hours' rest. The horses, of course, were spare ones, and not
wanted again for a bit.</p>
<p>Next morning it was 'sharp's the word', and no mistake. I felt a deal
smarter on it than yesterday. When you've fairly started for the road half the
journey's done. It's the thinking of this and forgetting that, and wondering
whether you haven't left behind the t'other thing, that's the miserablest part
of going a journey; when you're once away, no matter what's left behind, you
can get on some way or other.</p>
<p>We didn't start so over and above early, though Starlight was up as fresh as
paint at sunrise, you'd thought he hadn't ridden a yard the day before. Even at
the very last there's a lot of things to do and to get. But we all looked
slippy and didn't talk much, so that we got through what we had to do, and had
all the horses saddled and packed by about eight o'clock. Even Warrigal had
partly got over his temper. Of course I told Starlight about it. He gave him a
good rowing, and told him he deserved another hammering, which he had a good
mind to give him, if we hadn't been starting for a journey. Warrigal didn't say
a word to him. He never did. Starlight told me on the quiet, though, he was
sorry it happened, 'though it's the rascal's own fault, and served him right.
But he's a revengeful beggar,' he says, 'and that he would play you some dog's
trick if he wasn't afraid of me, you may depend your life on.'</p>
<p>'Now,' says he, 'we must make our little arrangements. I shall be somewhere
about Cunnamulla by the end of this month' (it was only the first week). 'Jim
knows that we are to meet there, and if we manage that all right I think the
greatest part of the danger will be over. I shall get right across by Dandaloo
to the back blocks of the West Bogan country, between it and the Lachlan. There
are tracks through the endless mallee scrub, only known to the tribes in the
neighbourhood, and a few half-castes like Warrigal, that have been stock-riding
about them. Sir Ferdinand and his troopers might just as well hunt for a stray
Arab in the deserts of the Euphrates. If I'm alive&mdash;mind you,
alive&mdash;I'll be at Cunnamulla on the day I mean. And now, good-bye, old
fellow. Whatever my sins have been, I've been true to you and your people in
the past, and if Aileen and I meet across the seas, as I hope, the new life may
partly atone for the old one.'</p>
<h2>Chapter 49</h2>
<p>He shook hands with me and dad, threw his leg over Rainbow, took Locket's
bridle as if he was going for an easy day's ride, and cantered off.</p>
<p>Warrigal nodded to both of us, then brought his pack-horse up level, and
followed up.</p>
<p>'There goes the Captain,' says father. 'It's hard to say if we'll ever see
him again. I shan't, anyhow, nor you either, maybe. Somehow I've had a notion
coming over me this good while as my time ain't going to be long. It don't make
no odds, neither. Life ain't no great chop to a man like me, not when he gets
the wrong side o' sixty, anyhow. Mine ain't been such a bad innings, and I
don't owe much to any man. I mean as I've mostly been square with them that's
done me a bad turn. No man can say Ben Marston was ever back'ard in that way;
and never will be, that's more. No! them as trod on me felt my teeth some day
or other. Eh, old man?' Crib growled. He understood things regular like a
Christian, that old dog did. 'And now you're a-goin' off and Jim's
gone&mdash;seems only t'other day as you and he was little toddlin' chaps,
runnin' to meet me when I come home from work, clearin' that fust paddock, and
telling me mammy had the tea ready. Perhaps I'd better ha' stuck to the
grubbin' and clearin' after all. It looked slow work, but it paid better than
this here in the long run.' Father turns away from me then, and walks back a
step or two. Then he faces me. 'Dash it, boy, what are ye waitin' for? Shake
hands, and tell Jim the old man han't forgot him yet.'</p>
<p>It was many a day since I'd felt father's hand in kindness; he didn't do
them sort of things. I held out mine and his fingers closed on it one minute,
like a vice&mdash;blest if I didn't expect to feel the bones grate agin one
another; he was that strong he hardly knew his own strength, I believe. Then he
sits down on the log by the fire. He took out his pipe, but somehow it wouldn't
light. 'Good-bye, Crib,' says I. The old dog looked at me for a bit, wagged his
tail, and then went and sat between dad's knees. I took my horse and rode away
slowish. I felt all dead and alive like when I got near the turn in the track.
I looked back and seen the dog and him just the same. I started both horses
then. I never set eyes on him again. Poor old dad!</p>
<p>I wasn't very gay for a bit, but I had a good horse under me, another
alongside, a smartish lot of cash in notes and gold, some bank deposits too,
and all the world before me. My dart now was to make my way to Willaroon and
look sharp about it. My chance of getting through was none too good, but I
settled to ride a deal at night and camp by day. I began to pick up my spirits
after I got on the road that led up the mountain, and to look ahead to the time
when I might call myself my own man again.</p>
<p>Next day after that I was at Willaroon. I could have got there overnight,
but it looked better to camp near the place and come next morning. There I was
all right. The overseer was a reasonable sort of man, and I found old George
had been as good as his word, and left word if a couple of men like me and
Starlight came up we were to be put on with the next mob of cattle that were
going to Queensland. He did a store cattle trade with the far-out squatters
that were stocking up new country in Queensland, and it paid him very well, as
nearly everything did that he touched. We were to find our own horses and be
paid so much a week&mdash;three pounds, I think&mdash;and so on.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, there was a biggish mob to start in a week, and road
hands being scarce in that part the overseer was disappointed that my mate, as
he called him, hadn't come on, but I said he'd gone another track.</p>
<p>'Well, he'll hardly get such wages at any other job,' says he, 'and if I was
Mr. Storefield I wouldn't hire him again, not if he wanted a billet ever so
bad.'</p>
<p>'I don't suppose he will,' says I, 'and serves him quite right too.'</p>
<p>I put my horses in the paddock&mdash;there was wild oats and crowsfoot
knee-high in it&mdash;and helped the overseer to muster and draft. He gave me a
fresh horse, of course. When he saw how handy I was in the yard he got quite
shook on me, and, says he&mdash;</p>
<p>'By George, you're just the chap the boss wants to send out to some new
country he's going to take up in Queensland. What's your name? Now I think of
it he didn't tell me.'</p>
<p>'William Turner,' says I.</p>
<p>'Very well, William,' says he, 'you're a dashed good man, I can see, and I
wish I could pick up a few more like you. Blessed if I ever saw such a lot of
duffers in my life as there are on this side. I've hardly seen a man come by
that's worth his grub. You couldn't stop till the next mob starts, I suppose?
I'd make it worth your while.'</p>
<p>'I couldn't well this time,' says I; 'my mate's got a friend out north just
from home, and we're tied to time to meet him. But if I come back this way I'll
put in a year with you.'</p>
<p>'Well, an offer's an offer,' says he. 'I can't say more, but I think you'll
do better by stopping on here.'</p>
<p>I got away with the cattle all right, and the drover in charge was told to
do all he could for me. The overseer said I was as good as two men, and it was
'Bill' here and 'William' there all the time till we were off. I wasn't sorry
to be clear away, for of course any day a trooper might have ridden up and
asked questions about the horses, that were a little too good for a working
drover.</p>
<p>Besides, I'd had a look at the papers, and I saw that Starlight had been as
good as his word, in the matter of the advertisement. Sure enough, the 'Turon
Star' and a lot of other papers had, on the same day, received the same
advertisement, with a pound note enclosed, and instructions to insert it four
times.</p>

The Messrs. Marston Brothers and Co., being about to leave the district,

addressed to the care of Sir Ferdinand Morringer, whose receipt will be a
sufficient discharge.<br>
<br>
For the firm,<br>
<br>
Starlight.</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't have believed at first that he'd be so mad. But after a bit I saw
that, like a lot of his reckless doings, it wasn't so far out after all.</p>
<p>All the papers had taken it up as usual, and though some of them were pretty
wild at the insult offered to the Government and so on, I could see they'd most
of them come to think it was a blind of some sort, meant to cover a regular big
touch that we were going in for, close by home, and wanting to throw the police
off the scent once more. If we'd really wanted to make tracks, they said, this
would be the last thing we'd think of doing. Bit by bit it was put about as
there should be a carefully laid plot to stick up all the banks in Turon on the
same day, and make a sweep of all the gold and cash.</p>
<p>I laughed when I saw this, because I knew that it was agreed upon between
Aileen and Gracey that, about the time we were fairly started, whichever of
them saw Sir Ferdinand first should allow it to be fished out of her, as a
great secret, that we were working up to some tremendous big affair of this
sort, and which was to put the crown on all our other doings. To make dead
sure, we had sent word to Billy the Boy (and some money too) to raise a sham
kind of sticking-up racket on the other side of the Turon, towards Bathurst
way. He was to frighten a few small people that would be safe to talk about it,
and make out that all the bush-rangers in the country were camped about there.
This was the sort of work that the young villain regularly went in for and took
a pleasure in, and by the way the papers put it in he had managed to frighten a
lot of travellers and roadside publicans out of their senses most.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, Wall and Hulbert and Moran had been working up
towards Mudgee lately and stuck up the mail, and as Master Billy thought it a
great lark to ride about with them with a black mask on, people began to think
the gangs had joined again and that some big thing, they didn't know what, was
really on the cards. So a lot of police were telegraphed for, and the Bathurst
superintendent came down, all in a hurry, to the Turon, and in the papers
nothing went down but telegrams and yarns about bush-rangers. They didn't know
what the country was coming to; all the sober going people wishing they'd never
got an ounce of gold in Australia, and every little storekeeper along the line
that had &pound;100 in his cash-box hiding it every night and afraid of seeing
us ride up every time the dogs barked.</p>
<p>All the time we were heading for Cunnamulla, and leaving New South Wales
behind us hand over hand.</p>
<p>The cattle, of course, couldn't travel very fast; ten or twelve miles a day
was enough for them. I could have drowned myself in the creeks as we went
crawling along sometimes, and I that impatient to get forward. Eighty miles it
was from Cunnamulla to the Queensland border. Once we were over that we'd have
to be arrested on warrant, and there were lots of chaps, like us, that were
'wanted', on the far-out north stations. Once we sighted the waters of the
Warrego we should feel ourselves more than half free.</p>
<p>Then there was Jim, poor old Jim! He wrote to say he was just starting for
Melbourne, and very queer he felt about leaving his wife and boy. Such a fine
little chap as he'd grown too. He'd just got his head down, he said, and taken
to the pulling (he meant working) like our old near-side poler, and he was as
happy as a king, going home to Jeanie at night, and having his three pounds
every Saturday. Now he was going away ever so far by land and sea, and God
knows when he might see either of 'em again. If it wasn't for the fear he had
of being pitched upon by the police any day, and the long sentence he was sure
to get, he'd stay where he was. He wasn't sure whether he wouldn't do so
now.</p>
<p>After that Aileen had a letter, a short one, from Jeanie. Jim had gone. She
had persuaded him for the sake of the boy, though both their hearts were nearly
broken. She didn't know whether she'd done right. Perhaps she never might see
him again. The poor fellow had forfeited his coach fare once, and come back to
stay another day with her. When he did go he looked the picture of misery, and
something told her it was their last parting.</p>
<p>Well, we struck the river about ten miles this side of Cunnamulla, where
there was a roadside inn, a small, miserable kind of place, just one of those
half-shanties, half-public-houses, fit for nothing but to trap bushmen, and
where the bad grog kills more men in a year than a middling break-out of
fever.</p>
<p>Somewhere about here I expected to hear of the other two. We'd settled to
meet a few miles one side or the other of the township. It didn't much matter
which. So I began to look about in case I might get word of either of 'em, even
if they didn't turn up to the time.</p>
<p>Somewhere about dinner time (twelve o'clock) we got the cattle on to the
river and let 'em spread over the flat. Then the man in charge rode up to the
inn, the Traveller's Rest, a pretty long rest for some of 'em (as a grave here
and there with four panels of shickery two-rail fence round it showed), and
shouted nobblers round for us.</p>
<p>While we was standing up at the bar, waiting for the cove to serve it out, a
flash-looking card he was, and didn't hurry himself, up rides a tall man to the
door, hangs up his horse, and walks in. He had on a regular town
rig&mdash;watch and chain, leather valise, round felt hat, like a chap going to
take charge of a store or something. I didn't know him at first, but directly
our eyes met I saw it was old Jim. We didn't talk&mdash;no fear, and my boss
asked him to join us, like any other stranger. Just then in comes the landlady
to sharpen up the man at the bar.</p>
<p>'Haven't you served those drinks yet, Bob?' she sings out. 'Why, the
gentlemen called for them half-an-hour ago. I never saw such a slow-going
crawler as you are. You'd never have done for the Turon boys.'</p>
<p>We all looked at her&mdash;not a bad-looking woman she'd been once, though
you could see she'd come down in the world and been knocked about a bit. Surely
I knew her voice! I'd seen her before&mdash;why, of course&mdash;</p>
<p>She was quicker than I was.</p>
<p>'Well, Dick!' says she, pouring out all the drinks, taking the note, and
rattling down the change on the counter, all in a minute, same as I'd often
seen her do before, 'this is a rough shop to meet old friends in, isn't it? So
you didn't know me, eh? We're both changed a bit. You look pretty fresh on it.
A woman loses her looks sooner than a man when she goes to the bad. And Jim
too,' she goes on; 'only to fancy poor old Jim turning up here too! One would
think you'd put it up to meet at the township on some plant of that sort.'</p>
<p>It was Kate, sure enough! How in the world did ever she get here? I knew
she'd left the Turon, and that old Mullockson had dropped a lot of his money in
a big mining company he'd helped to float, and that never turned out gold
enough to pay for the quicksilver in the first crushing. We'd heard afterwards
that he'd died and she'd married again; but I never expected to see her brought
down so low as this&mdash;not but what we'd known many a woman that started on
the diggings with silks and satins and a big house and plate-glass windows
brought down to a cotton gown and a bark shanty before half-a-dozen years were
over.</p>
<p>Jim and I both looked queer. The men began to laugh. Any one could see we
were both in a fix. Jim spoke first.</p>
<p>'Are you sure you're not making a mistake, missis?' says he, looking at her
very quiet-like. 'Take care what you say.'</p>
<p>He'd better have held his tongue. I don't know whether she really intended
to give us away. I don't think she did altogether; but with them kind of women
it's a regular toss up whether they'll behave reasonable or not. When they're
once started, 'specially if they think they've not been treated on the square,
they can't stop themselves.</p>
<p>'Take care what I say!' she breaks out, rising her voice to a scream, and
looking as if she'd jump over the bar-counter and tear the eyes out of me. 'Why
should I take care? It's you, Dick Marston, you double-faced treacherous dog
that you are, that's got a thousand pounds on your head, that has cause to
care, and you, Jim Marston, that's in the same reward, and both of you know it.
Not that I've anything against you, Jim. You're a man, and always was. I'll say
that for you.'</p>
<p>'And you're a woman,' groans out poor Jim. 'That's the reason you can't hold
your infernal tongue, I suppose.'</p>
<p>Kate had let the cat out of the bag now and no mistake. You should have seen
the drover and his men look at us when they found they had the famous
bush-rangers among them that they'd all heard so much about this years past.
Some looked pretty serious and some laughed. The drover spoke first.</p>
<p>'Bush-ranger here or bush-ranger there,' he says, 'I'm going to lose a
dashed good man among cattle; and if this chattering fool of a woman had held
her tongue the pair of ye might have come on with the cattle till they were
delivered. Now I'm a man short, and haven't one as I can trust on a pinch. I
don't think any more of you, missis,' he says, 'for being so dashed ready to
give away your friends, supposing they had been on the cross.'</p>
<p>But Kate didn't hear. She had fallen down in a kind of fit, and her husband,
coming in to see what the row was about, picked her up, and stood looking at us
with his mouth open.</p>
<p>'Look here, my man,' says I, 'your wife's taken me and this gentleman,'
pointing to Jim, 'for some people she knew before on the diggings, and seems to
have got rather excited over it. If it was worth our while to stay here, we'd
make her prove it. You'd better get her to lie down, and advise her, when she
comes to, to hold her tongue, or you might be made to suffer by it.'</p>
<p>'She's a terror when she's put out, and that's God's truth,' says the chap;
and starting to drag her over to one of the bits of back bedrooms. 'It's all
right, I daresay. She will keep meddling with what don't consarn her. I don't
care who yer are or what yer are. If you knowed her afore, I expect ye'll think
it best to clear while she's unsensible like.'</p>
<p>'Here's a shout all round for these men here,' says I, throwing a note on
the bar. 'Never mind the change. Good-bye, chaps. This gentleman and I have
some business together, and there's no bush-ranging in it, you may take my
word.'</p>
<p>We all left then. The men went back to their cattle. Jim rode quietly along
the road to Cunnamulla just like any other traveller. I went down and saddled
up my horse. I'd got everything I wanted in my swag, so I'd left the other
horse at Willaroon.</p>
<p>'Never mind the settlement,' says I to the drover. 'I'll be coming back to
the station after I've finished my business in Queensland, and we can make up
the account then.'</p>
<p>The overseer looked rather doubtful.</p>
<p>'This seems rather mixed,' says he. 'Blest if I understand it. That woman at
the pub seems half off her head to me. I can't think two quiet-looking chaps
like you can be the Marstons. You've been a thundering good road hand anyhow,
and I wish you luck.'</p>
<p>He shook hands with me. I rode off and kept going along the road till I
overtook Jim.</p>
<p>When I'd gone a mile or two there was Jim riding steadily along the road,
looking very dull and down-like, just the way he used to do when he was
studying how to get round a job of work as he wasn't used to. He brightens up a
bit when he sees me, and we both jumped off, and had a good shake-hands and a
yarn. I told him about mother and Aileen, and how I'd left dad all by himself.
He said Jeanie and the boy were all right, but of course he'd never heard of
'em since, and couldn't help feeling dubersome about meeting her again,
particular now this blessed woman had dropped across us, and wouldn't keep her
mouth shut.</p>
<p>'As sure as we've had anything to do with her, bad luck's followed up,' says
Jim; 'I'd rather have faced a trooper than seen her face again.'</p>
<p>'She can't do much now,' says I. 'We're across the border. I wonder where
Starlight is&mdash;whether he's in the township or not? As soon as we meet him
we can make straight for the ship.'</p>
<p>'He's there now,' says Jim. 'He was at Kate's last night.'</p>
<p>'How do you know that?'</p>
<p>'I heard her mutter something about it just when she went into that fit, or
whatever it was. Devilment, I think. I never saw such a woman; and to think
she's my Jeanie's sister!'</p>
<p>'Never mind that, Jim. These things can't be helped. But what did she
say?'</p>
<p>'Something like this: "He thought I didn't know him, passing himself off as
a gentleman. Warrigal, too. Kate Morrison's eyes are too sharp for that, as
he'll find out."'</p>
<p>'Think she'll give us away again, Jim?'</p>
<p>'God only knows. She mightn't this time, unless she wants to smother you
altogether, and don't mind who she hurts along with you.'</p>
<p>'There's one good thing in it,' says I; 'there's no police nearer than
Trielgerat, and it's a long day's ride to them. We made it all right before we
left the Turon. All the police in the country is looking for us on the wrong
road, and will be for a week or two yet.'</p>
<p>Then I told him about Aileen putting Sir Ferdinand on the wrong lay, and he
said what a clever girl she was, and had as much pluck and sense as two or
three men. 'A deal more than we've ever showed, Dick,' says he, 'and that's not
saying much either.'</p>
<p>He laughed in his quiet way when he heard about Starlight's advertisement in
the 'Turon Star', and said it was just like him.</p>
<p>'He's a wonderful clever fellow, the Captain. I've often thought when I've
been by myself in Melbourne, sitting quiet, smoking at night, and turning all
these things over, that it's a wonder he don't shoot himself when he thinks of
what he is and the man he ought to be.'</p>
<p>'He's head enough to take us safe out of this dashed old Sydney side,' says
I, 'and land us in another country, where we'll be free and happy in spite of
all that's come and gone. If he does that, we've no call to throw anything up
to him.'</p>
<p>'Let him do that,' says Jim, 'and I'll be his servant to the day of my
death. But I'm afeard it isn't to be any more than going to heaven right off.
It's too good, somehow, to come true; and yet what a thing it is to be leading
a working honest life and be afraid of no man! I was very near like that in
Melbourne, Dick,' he says; 'you've no notion what a grand thing it
was&mdash;when I'd done my week's work, and used to walk about with Jeanie and
her boy on Sundays, and pass the time of day with decent square coves that I
knew, and never dreamed I was different; then the going home peaceful and
contented to our own little cottage; I tell you, Dick, it was heaven on earth.
No wonder it regular broke my heart to leave it.'</p>
<p>'We're close up to the township now,' says I. 'This wire fence and the
painted gate ain't more than a couple of miles off, that chap said at the inn.
I wish there was a fire-stick in it, and I'd never gone inside a door of it.
However, that says nothing. We've got to meet Starlight somehow, and there's no
use in riding in together. You go in first, and I'll take a wheel outside the
house and meet you in the road a mile or two ahead. Where's your pistol? I must
have a look at mine. I had to roll it up in my swag, and it wants loading.'</p>
<p>'Mine's a good tool,' says Jim, bringing out a splendid-looking
revolver&mdash;one of these new Dean and Adams's. 'I can make prime shooting at
fifty yards; but I hope to God I shan't want to use it.'</p>
<p>'There's no fear yet a bit,' says I; 'but it's as well to be ready. I'll
load before we go any farther.'</p>
<p>I loaded and put her back in the belt. We were just going to push on when we
heard the sound of galloping, and round a patch of scrub comes a horseman at
full speed. When he sees us he cuts off the road and comes towards us.</p>
<p>There was only one horse that carried himself like that, even when he was
pulling double. We spotted him the same second. Rainbow and Starlight on him!
What in thunder makes him ride like that?</p>
<p>When he came closer we saw by his face that something was up. His eyes had
the gloomy, dull fire in them that put me in mind of the first time I saw him
when he came back wounded and half dead to the Hollow.</p>
<p>'Don't stop to talk, boys,' he sings out, without stopping, 'but ride like
the devil. Head to the left. That infernal Warrigal has laid the police on your
track, Dick. They were seen at Willaroon; may be up at any minute.'</p>
<p>'Where's Warrigal now?' I said, as we all took our horses by the head and
made for a patch of dark timber we could see far out on the plain.</p>
<p>'He dropped when I fired at him,' says Starlight; 'but whether the poor
beggar's dead or not I can't say. It isn't my fault if he betrays any one
again.'</p>
<p>'How did it come out?'</p>
<p>'I was tired of waiting at that confounded hotel&mdash;not a soul to speak
to. I rode back as far as Kate's, just to see if you had passed. She didn't
know me a bit.'</p>
<p>'The deuce she didn't! Why, she broke out on me and Jim. Said something
about you and Warrigal too.'</p>
<p>'Wonderful creatures, women,' says he, thoughtful-like; 'and yet I used to
think I understood them. No time to do anything, though.'</p>
<p>'No; the nearest police station's a day off. I'd give a trifle to know who's
after us. How did you find out Warrigal's doubling on me? not that it matters
now; d&mdash;n him!'</p>
<p>'When I talked about going back he was in a terrible fright, and raised so
many objections that I saw he had some reason for it; so I made him
confess.'</p>
<p>'How did he do it?'</p>
<p>'After we'd passed Dandaloo, and well inside the West Bogan scrubs, he
picked up a blackfellow that had once been a tracker; gave him a pound to let
them know at the police camp that you were making out by Willaroon.'</p>
<p>'I knew he had it in for me,' said I; 'but I depended on his not doing
anything for fear of hurting you.'</p>
<p>'So I thought, too; but he expected you'd be trapped at Willaroon before
there would be time for you to catch me up. If he hadn't met that Jemmy
Wardell, I daresay he wouldn't have thought of it. When he told me I was in
such an infernal rage that I fired point blank at him; didn't wait to see
whether he was dead or alive, and rode straight back here to warn you. I was
just in time&mdash;eh, Jim, old man? Why, you look so respectable they'd never
have known you. Why didn't you stay where you were, James?'</p>
<p>'I wish to God I had!' says poor old Jim. 'It's too late to think of that
now.'</p>
<p>We hadn't over much time for talking, and had to range up close to do it at
all at the pace we were going. We did our best, and must have ridden many a
mile before dark. Then we kept going through the night. Starlight was pilot,
and by the compass he carried we were keeping something in a line with the
road. But we missed Warrigal in the night work, and more than once I suspected
we were going round and not keeping a straight course.</p>
<p>We didn't do badly after all, for we struck the main road at daylight and
made out that we were thirty miles the other side of Cunnamulla, and in the
right direction. The worst of it was, like all short cuts and night riding,
we'd taken about twice as much out of our horses as we need have done if we'd
been certain of our line.</p>
<p>'This ought to be Murrynebone Creek,' says Starlight, 'by the look of it,'
when we came to a goodish broad bit of water. 'The crossing place is boggy, so
they told me at the hotel. We may as well pull up for a spell. We're in
Queensland now, that's one comfort.'</p>
<p>It took us all we knew to get over; it was a regular quicksand. Rainbow
never got flustered if he was up to his neck in a bog, but my horse got
frightened and plunged, so that I had to jump off. Jim's horse was a trifle
better, but he hadn't much to spare. We weren't sorry to take the bridles out
of their mouths and let them pick a bit on the flat when we got safe over.</p>
<p>We didn't unsaddle our horses&mdash;no fear; we never did that only at
night; not always then. We took the bits out of their mouths, and let them pick
feed round about, with the bridle under their feet, stockhorse fashion. They
were all used to it, and you'd see 'em put their foot on a rein, and take it
off again, regular as if they knew all about it. We could run full pelt and
catch 'em all three in a minute's notice; old Rainbow would hold up his head
when he saw Starlight coming, and wait for him to mount if there was a hundred
horses galloping past. Lucky for him, he'd done it scores of times; once on his
back there was no fear of any other horse overhauling him, any more than a
coolie dog or a flying doe kangaroo.</p>
<p>Pretty well settled it came to be amongst us that we should be well into
Queensland before the police were handy. Starlight and Jim were having a pitch
about the best way to get aboard one of these pearling craft, and how jolly it
would be. The captains didn't care two straws what sort of passengers they took
aboard so long as they had the cash and were willing to give a hand when they
were wanted.</p>
<p>We were just walking towards the horses to make a fresh start, when
Starlight puts up his hand. We all listened. There was no mistaking the sound
we heard&mdash;horses at speed, and mounted men at that. We were in a sort of
angle. We couldn't make back over the infernal boggy creek we'd just passed,
and they seemed to be coming on two sides at once.</p>
<p>'By &mdash;&mdash;! they're on us,' says Starlight; and he cocks his rifle,
and walks over quite cool to the old horse. 'Our chance, boys, is to exchange
shots, and ride for it. Keep cool, don't waste your fire, and if we can drop a
couple of them we may slip them yet.'</p>
<p>We hadn't barely time to get to our horses, when out of the timber they
came&mdash;in two lots&mdash;three on each side. Police, sure enough; and
meeting us. That shook us a bit. How the devil did they get ahead of us after
the pace we'd ridden the last twenty-four hours, too? When they came close we
could see how it was, Sir Ferdinand and three troopers on one side; Inspector
Goring, with two more, on the left; while outside, not far from the lead, rode
Sir Watkin, the Braidwood black tracker&mdash;the best hand at that work in the
three colonies, if you could keep him sober.</p>
<p>Now we could see why they took us in front. He had kept out wide when he saw
the tracks were getting hot, so as to come in on the road ahead of us, and meet
us full in the teeth.</p>
<p>He had hit it off well this time, blast him! We couldn't make back on
account of the creek, and we had double our number to fight, and good men too,
before we could break through, if we could do that.</p>
<p>Our time was come if we hadn't the devil's own luck; but we had come out of
as tight a place before, and might do it again.</p>
<p>When they were within fifty yards Sir Ferdinand calls out, 'Surrender! It's
no use, men,' says he; 'I don't want to shoot you down, but you must see you're
outnumbered. There's no disgrace in yielding now.'</p>
<p>'Come on!' says Starlight; 'don't waste your breath! There's no man here
will be taken alive.'</p>
<p>With that, Goring lets drive and sends a bullet that close by my head I put
my hand up to feel the place. All the rest bangs away, black tracker and all. I
didn't see Sir Ferdinand's pistol smoke. He and Starlight seemed to wait. Then
Jim and I fires steady. One trooper drops badly hit, and my man's horse fell
like a log and penned his rider under him, which was pretty nigh as good.</p>
<p>'Steady does it,' says Starlight, and he makes a snap shot at the tracker,
and breaks his right arm.</p>
<p>'Three men spoiled,' says he; 'one more to the good and we may charge.'</p>
<p>Just as he said this the trooper that was underneath the dead horse crawls
from under him, the off side, and rests his rifle on his wither. Starlight had
just mounted when every rifle and pistol in the two parties was fired at one
volley. We had drawn closer to one another, and no one seemed to think of
cover.</p>
<p>Rainbow rears up, gives one spring, and falls backward with a crash. I
thought Starlight was crushed underneath him, shot through the neck and flank
as he was, but he saved himself somehow, and stood with his hand on Rainbow's
mane, when the old horse rose again all right, head and tail well up, and as
steady as a rock. The blood was pouring out of his neck, but he didn't seem to
care two straws about it. You could see his nostril spread out and his eye
looking twice as big and fiery.</p>
<p>Starlight rests his rifle a minute on the old horse's shoulder, and the man
that had fired the shot fell over with a kick. Something hits me in the ribs
like a stone, and another on the right arm, which drops down just as I was
aiming at a young fellow with light hair that had ridden pretty close up, under
a myall tree.</p>
<p>Jim and Sir Ferdinand let drive straight at one another the same minute.
They both meant it this time. Sir Ferdinand's hat turned part round on his
head, but poor old Jim drops forward on his face and tears up the grass with
his hands. I knew what that sign meant.</p>
<p>Goring rides straight at Starlight and calls on him to surrender. He had his
rifle on his hip, but he never moved. There he stood, with his hand on the mane
of the old horse. 'Keep back if you're wise, Goring,' says he, as quiet and
steady as if he'd been cattle-drafting. 'I don't want to have your blood on my
head; but if you must&mdash;'</p>
<p>Goring had taken so many men in his day that he was got over confident-like.
He thought Starlight would give in at the last moment or miss him in the rush.
My right arm was broken, and now that Jim was down we might both be took, which
would be a great crow for the police. Anyhow, he was a man that didn't know
what fear was, and he chanced it.</p>
<p>Two of the other troopers fired point blank at Starlight as Goring rode at
him, and both shots told. He never moved, but just lifted his rifle as the
other came up at the gallop. Goring threw up his arms, and rolled off his horse
a dying man.</p>
<p>Starlight looked at him for a minute.</p>
<p>'We're quits,' he says; 'it's not once or twice either you've pulled trigger
on me. I knew this day would come.'</p>
<p>Then he sinks down slowly by the side of the old horse and leans against his
fore leg, Rainbow standing quite steady, only tossing his head up and down the
old way. I could see, by the stain on Starlight's mouth and the blood on his
breast, he'd been shot through the lungs.</p>
<p>I was badly hit too, and going in the head, though I didn't feel it so much
at the time. I began to hear voices like in a dream; then my eyes darkened, and
I fell like a log.</p>
<p>When I came to, all the men was off their horses, some round
Goring&mdash;him they lifted up and propped against a tree; but he was stone
dead, any one could see. Sir Ferdinand was on his knees beside Starlight,
talking to him, and the other saying a word now and then, quite composed and
quiet-like.</p>
<p>'Close thing, Morringer, wasn't it?' I heard him say. 'You were too quick
for us; another day and we'd been out of reach.'</p>
<p>'True enough. Horses all dead beat; couldn't raise a remount for love or
money.'</p>
<p>'Well, the game's up now, isn't it? I've held some good cards too, but they
never told, somehow. I'm more sorry for Jim&mdash;and&mdash;that poor girl,
Aileen, than I am for myself.'</p>
<p>'Don't fret&mdash;there's a good fellow. Fortune of war, you know. Anything
else?'</p>
<p>Here he closed his eyes, and seemed gone; but he wakes up again, and begins
in a dreamy way. His words came slowly, but his voice never altered one
bit.</p>
<p>'I'm sorry I fired at poor Warrigal now. No dog ever was more faithful than
he has been to me all through till now; but I was vexed at his having sold Dick
and poor Jim.'</p>
<p>'We knew we should find you here or hereabouts without that,' says Sir
Ferdinand.</p>
<p>'How was that?'</p>
<p>'Two jockey-boys met you one night at Calga gate; one of them recognised
Locket by the white patch on her neck. He wired to us at the next station.'</p>
<p>'So you were right, after all, Dick. It was a mistake to take that mare.
I've always been confoundedly obstinate; I admit that. Too late to think of it
now, isn't it?'</p>
<p>'Anything else I can do?' says Sir Ferdinand.</p>
<p>'Give her this ring,' he pulls it off his finger, 'and you'll see Maddie
Barnes gets the old horse, won't you? Poor old Rainbow! I know she'll take care
of him; and a promise is a promise.'</p>
<p>'All right. He's the property of the Government now, you know; but I'll
square it somehow. The General won't object under the circumstances.'</p>
<p>Then he shuts his eyes for a bit. After a while he calls out&mdash;</p>
<p>'Dick! Dick Marston.'</p>
<p>'I'm here,' says I.</p>
<p>'If you ever leave this, tell Aileen that her name was the last word I
spoke&mdash;the very last. She foresaw this day; she told me so. I've had a
queer feeling too, this week back. Well, it's over now. I don't know that I'm
sorry, except for others. I say, Morringer, do you remember the last pigeon
match you and I shot in, at Hurlingham?'</p>
<p>'Why, good God!' says Sir Ferdinand, bending down, and looking into his
face. 'It can't be; yes, by Jove, it is &mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>He spoke some name I couldn't catch, but Starlight put a finger on his lips,
and whispers&mdash;</p>
<p>'You won't tell, will you? Say you won't?'</p>
<p>The other nodded.</p>
<p>He smiled just like his old self.</p>
<p>'Poor Aileen!' he says, quite faint. His head fell back. Starlight was
dead!</p>
<h2>Chapter 50</h2>
<p>The breath was hardly out of him when a horse comes tearing through the
scrub on to the little plain, with a man on his back that seemed hurt bad or
drunk, he rolled in his saddle so. The head of him was bound up with a white
cloth, and what you could see of it was dark-looking, with bloodstains on it. I
knew the figure and the seat on a horse, though I couldn't see his face. He
didn't seem to have much strength, but he was one of those sort of riders that
can't fall off a horse, that is unless they're dead. Even then you'd have to
pull him down. I believe he'd hang on somehow like a dead 'possum on a
branch.</p>
<p>It was Warrigal!</p>
<p>They all knew him when he came close up, but none of the troopers raised
their pieces or thought of stopping him. If a dead man had rode right into the
middle of us he'd have looked like that. He stopped his horse, and slipped off
on his feet somehow.</p>
<p>He'd had a dreadful wound, any one could see. There was blood on the rags
that bound his head all up, and being round his forehead and over his chin it
made him look more and more like a corpse. Not much you could see, only his
eyes, that were burning bright like two coals of fire.</p>
<p>Up to Starlight's body he goes and sits himself down by it. He takes the
dead man's head into his lap, looks down at the face, and bursts out into the
awfullest sort of crying and lamenting I ever heard of a living man. I've seen
the native women mourning for their dead with the blood and tears running down
their faces together. I've known them sit for days and nights without stirring
from round a corpse, not taking a bite or sup the whole time. I've seen white
people that's lost an only child that had, maybe, been all life and spirits an
hour before. But in all my life I have never seen no man, nor woman neither,
show such regular right-down grief as Warrigal did for his master&mdash;the
only human creature he loved in the wide world, and him lying stiff on the
ground before him.</p>
<p>He lifts up the dead face and wipes the blood from the lips so careful;
talks to it in his own language (or leastways his mother's) like a woman over a
child. Then he sobbed and groaned and shook all over as if the very life was
going out of him. At last he lays the head very soft and gentle down on the
ground and looks round. Sir Ferdinand gives him his handkerchief, and he lays
it over the face. Then he turns away from the men that stood round, and got up
looking that despairing and wretched that I couldn't help pitying him, though
he was the cause of the whole thing as far as we could see.</p>
<p>Sudden as a flash of powder he pulls out a small revolver&mdash;a
Derringer&mdash;Starlight gave him once, and holds it out to me, butt-end
first.</p>
<p>'You shoot me, Dick Marston; you shoot me quick,' he says. 'It's all my
fault. I killed him&mdash;I killed the Captain. I want to die and go with him
to the never-never country parson tell us about&mdash;up there!'</p>
<p>One of the troopers knocked his hand up. Sir Ferdinand gave a nod, and a
pair of handcuffs were slipped over his wrists.</p>
<p>'You told the police the way I went?' says I. 'It's all come out of
that.'</p>
<p>'Thought they'd grab you at Willaroon,' says he, looking at me quite
sorrowful with his dark eyes, like a child. 'If you hadn't knocked me down that
last time, Dick Marston, I'd never have done nothing to you nor Jim. I forgot
about the old down. That brought it all back again. I couldn't help it, and
when I see Jimmy Wardell I thought they'd catch you and no one else.'</p>
<p>'Well, you've made a clean sweep of the lot of us, Warrigal,' says I, 'poor
Jim and all. Don't you ever show yourself to the old man or go back to the
Hollow, if you get out of this.'</p>
<p>'He's dead now. I'll never hear him speak again,' says he, looking over to
the figure on the grass. 'What's the odds about me?'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>I didn't hear any more; I must have fainted away again. Things came into my
head about being taken in a cart back to Cunnamulla, with Jim lying dead on one
side of me and Starlight on the other. I was only half-sensible, I expect.
Sometimes I thought we were alive, and another time that the three of us were
dead and going to be buried.</p>
<p>What makes it worse I've seen that sight so often since&mdash;the fight on
the plain and the end of it all. Just like a picture it comes back to me over
and over again, sometimes in broad day, as I sit in my cell, in the darkest
midnight, in the early dawn.</p>
<p>It rises before my eyes&mdash;the bare plain, and the dead men lying where
they fell; Sir Ferdinand on his horse, with the troopers standing round; and
the half-caste sitting with Starlight's head in his lap, rocking himself to and
fro, and crying and moaning like a woman that's lost her child.</p>
<p>I can see Jim, too&mdash;lying on his face with his hat rolled off and both
arms spread out wide. He never moved after. And to think that only the day
before he had thought he might see his wife and child again! Poor old Jim! If I
shut my eyes they won't go away. It will be the last sight I shall see in this
world before&mdash;before I'm &mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The coroner of the district held an inquest, and the jury found a verdict of
'justifiable homicide by Sir Ferdinand Morringer and other members of the
police force of New South Wales in the case of one James Marston, charged with
robbery under arms, and of a man habitually known as "Starlight", but of whose
real name there was no evidence before the jury.' As for the police, it was
wilful murder against us. Warrigal and I were remanded to Turon Court for
further evidence, and as soon as we were patched up a bit by the
doctor&mdash;for both of us looked like making a die of it for two or three
weeks&mdash;we were started on horseback with four troopers overland all the
way back. We went easy stages&mdash;we couldn't ride any way fast&mdash;both of
us handcuffed, and our horses led.</p>
<p>One day, about a fortnight after, as we were crossing a river, Warrigal's
horse stopped to drink. It was a swim in the middle of the stream, and the
trooper, who was a young chap just from the depot, let go his leading rein for
a bit. Warrigal had been as quiet as a lamb all the time, and they hadn't a
thought of his playing up. I heard a splash, and looked round; his horse's head
was turned to the bank, and, before the trooper could get out of the river, he
was into the river scrub and away as fast as his horse could carry him. Both
the troopers went after him, and we waited half-an-hour, and then went on to
the next police station to stop till they came back.</p>
<p>Next day, late, they rode in with their horses regularly done and knocked
up, leading his horse, but no Warrigal. He had got clear away from them in the
scrub, jumped off his horse when they were out of sight, taken off his boots
and made a straight track for the West Bogan scrub. There was about as much
chance of running him down there as a brumbie with a day's start or a wallaroo
that was seen on a mountain side the week before last. I didn't trouble my head
that much to think whether I was glad or sorry. What did it matter? What did
anything matter now? The only two men I loved in the world were dead; the two
women I loved best left forsaken and disgraced; and I&mdash;well, I was on my
way to be hanged!</p>
<p>I was taken along to Turon and put into the gaol, there to await my trial.
They didn't give me much of a chance to bolt, and I wouldn't have taken it if
they had. I was dead tired of my life, and wouldn't have taken my liberty then
and there if they'd given it me. All I wanted was to have the whole thing done
and over without any more bother.</p>
<p>It all passed like a dream. The court was crowded till there wasn't standing
room, every one wanting to get a look at Dick Marston, the famous bush-ranger.
The evidence didn't take so very long. I was proved to have been seen with the
rest the day the escort was robbed; the time the four troopers were shot. I was
suspected of being concerned in Hagan's party's death, and half-a-dozen other
things. Last of all, when Sub-Inspector Goring was killed, and a trooper,
besides two others badly wounded.</p>
<p>I was sworn to as being one of the men that fired on the police. I didn't
hear a great deal of it, but 'livened up when the judge put on his black cap
and made a speech, not a very long one, telling about the way the law was set
at naught by men who had dared to infest the highways of the land and rob
peaceful citizens with arms and violence. In the pursuit of gain by such
atrocious means, blood had been shed, and murder, wilful murder, had been
committed. He would not further allude to the deeds of blood with which the
prisoner at the bar stood charged. The only redeeming feature in his career had
been brought out by the evidence tendered in his favour by the learned counsel
who defended him. He had fought fairly when opposed by the police force, and he
had on more than one occasion acted in concert with the robber known as
Starlight, and the brother James Marston, both of whom had fallen in a recent
encounter, to protect from violence women who were helpless and in the power of
his evil companions. Then the judge pronounced the sentence that I, Richard
Marston, was to be taken from the place whence I came, and there hanged by the
neck until I was dead. 'And might God have mercy upon my soul!'</p>
<p>My lawyer had beforehand argued that although I had been seen in the company
of persons who had doubtless compassed the unlawfully slaying of the Queen's
lieges and peace officers, yet no proof had been brought before the court that
day that I had wilfully killed any one. 'He was not aware,' would his Honour
remark, 'that any one had seen me fire at any man, whether since dead or alive.
He would freely admit that. I had been seen in bad company, but that fact would
not suffice to hang a man under British rule. It was therefore incumbent on the
jury to bring in a verdict for his client of "not guilty".'</p>
<p>But that cock wouldn't fight. I was found guilty by the jury and sentenced
to death by the judge. I expect I was taken back without seeing or hearing to
the gaol, and I found myself alone in the condemned cell, with heavy
leg-irons&mdash;worn for the first time in my life. The rough and tumble of a
bush-ranger's life was over at last, and this was the finish up.</p>
<p>For the first week or two I didn't feel anything particular. I was hardly
awake. Sometimes I thought I must be dreaming&mdash;that this man, sitting in a
cell, quiet and dull-looking, with heavy irons on his limbs, could never be
Dick Marston, the shearer, the stock-rider, the gold-miner, the
bush-ranger.</p>
<p>This was the end&mdash;the end&mdash;the end! I used to call it out
sometimes louder and louder, till the warder would come in to see if I had gone
mad.</p>
<p>Bit by bit I came to my right senses. I almost think I felt sharper and
clearer in my head than I had done for ever so long. Then I was able to realise
the misery I had come down to after all our blowing and roving. This was the
crush-yard and no gateway. I was safe to be hanged in six weeks, or
thereabouts&mdash;hanged like a dog! Nothing could alter that, and I didn't
want it if it could.</p>
<p>And how did the others get on, those that had their lives bound up with
ours, so that we couldn't be hurt without their bleeding, almost in their
hearts?&mdash;that is, mother's bled to death, at any rate; when she heard of
Jim's death and my being taken it broke her heart clean; she never held her
head up after. Aileen told me in her letter she used to nurse his baby and cry
over him all day, talking about her dear boy Jim. She was laid in the
burying-ground at St. Kilda. As to Aileen, she had long vowed herself to the
service of the Virgin. She knew that she was committing sin in pledging herself
to an earthly love. She had been punished for her sin by the death of him she
loved, and she had settled in her mind to go into the convent at Soubiaca,
where she should be able to wear out her life in prayer for those of her blood
who still lived, as well as for the souls of those who lay in the little
burying-ground on the banks of the far Warrego.</p>
<p>Jeanie settled to stop in Melbourne. She had money enough to keep her
comfortable, and her boy would be brought up in a different style from his
father.</p>
<p>As for Gracey, she sent me a letter in which she said she was like the bird
that could only sing one song. She would remain true to me in life and death.
George was very kind, and would never allow any one to speak harshly of his
former friends. We must wait and make the best of it.</p>
<p>So I was able, you see, to get bits of news even in a condemned cell, from
time to time, about the outside world. I learned that Wall and Hulbert and
Moran and another fellow were still at large, and following up their old game.
Their time, like ours, was drawing short, though.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>Well, this has been a thundering long yarn, hasn't it? All my whole life I
seem to have lived over again. It didn't take so long in the telling; it's a
month to-day since I began. And this life itself has reeled away so quick, it
hardly seems a dozen years instead of seven-and-twenty since it began. It won't
last much longer. Another week and it will be over. There's a fellow to be
strung up before me, for murdering his wife. The scoundrel, I wonder how he
feels?</p>
<p>I've had visitors too; some I never thought to see inside this gaol wall.
One day who should come in but Mr. Falkland and his daughter. There was a young
gentleman with them that they told me was an English lord, a baronet, or
something of that sort, and was to be married to Miss Falkland. She stood and
looked at me with her big innocent eyes, so pitiful and kind-like. I could have
thrown myself down at her feet. Mr. Falkland talked away, and asked me about
this and that. He seemed greatly interested. When I told him about the last
fight, and of poor Jim being shot dead, and Starlight dying alongside the old
horse, the tears came into Miss Falkland's eyes, and she cried for a bit, quite
feeling and natural.</p>
<p>Mr. Falkland asked me all about the robbery at Mr. Knightley's, and took
down a lot of things in his pocket-book. I wondered what he did that for.</p>
<p>When they said good-bye Mr. Falkland shook hands with me, and said 'he hoped
to be able to do some good for me, but not to build anything on the strength of
it.'</p>
<p>Then Miss Falkland came forward and held out her beautiful hand to
me&mdash;to me, as sure as you live&mdash;like a regular thoroughbred angel, as
she always was. It very nigh cooked me. I felt so queer and strange, I couldn't
have spoken a word to save my life.</p>
<p>Sir George, or whatever his name was, didn't seem to fancy it over much, for
he said&mdash;</p>
<p>'You colonists are strange people. Our friend here may think himself highly
favoured.'</p>
<p>Miss Falkland turned towards him and held up her head, looking like a queen,
as she was, and says she&mdash;</p>
<p>'If you had met me in the last place where I saw this man and his brother,
you would not wonder at my avowing my gratitude to both of them. I should
despise myself if I did not. Poor Jim saved my life on one occasion, and on
another, but far more dreadful day, he&mdash;but words, mere words, can never
express my deep thankfulness for his noble conduct, and were he here now I
would tell him so, and give him my hand, if all the world stood by.'</p>
<p>Sir George didn't say anything after that, and she swept out of the cell,
followed by Mr. Falkland and him. It was just as well for him to keep a quiet
tongue in his head. I expect she was a great heiress as well as a great beauty,
and people of that sort, I've found, mostly get listened to when they speak.
When the door shut I felt as if I'd seen the wings of an angel flit through it,
and the prison grew darker and darker like the place of lost souls.</p>
<h2>Chapter 51</h2>
<p>One day I was told that a lady wanted to see me. When the door of the cell
opened who should walk in but Aileen! I didn't look to have seen her. I didn't
bother my head about who was coming. What did it matter, as I kept thinking,
who came or who went for the week or two that was to pass before the day? Yes,
the day, that Thursday, when poor Dick Marston would walk over the threshold of
his cell, and never walk over one again.</p>
<p>The warder&mdash;him that stopped with me day and night&mdash;every man in
the condemned cell has to be watched like that&mdash;stepped outside the door
and left us together. We both looked at one another. She was dressed all in
black, and her face was that pale I hardly knew her at first. Then she said,
'Oh, Dick&mdash;my poor Dick! is this the way we meet?' and flings herself into
my arms. How she cried and sobbed, to be sure. The tears ran down her cheeks
like rain, and every time the leg-irons rattled she shook and trembled as if
her heart was breaking.</p>
<p>I tried to comfort her; it was no use.</p>
<p>'Let me cry on, Dick,' she said; 'I have not shed a tear since I first heard
the news&mdash;the miserable truth that has crushed all our vain hopes and
fancies; my heart has nearly burst for want of relief. This will do me good. To
think&mdash;to think that this should be the end of all! But it is just! I
cannot dare to doubt Heaven's mercy. What else could we expect, living as we
all did&mdash;in sin&mdash;in mortal sin? I am punished rightly.'</p>
<p>She told me all about poor mother's death. She never held up her head after
she heard of Jim's death. She never said a hard word about any one. It was
God's will, she thought, and only for His mercy things might have gone worse.
The only pleasure she had in her last days was in petting Jim's boy. He was a
fine little chap, and had eyes like his father, poor old Jim! Then Aileen broke
down altogether, and it was a while before she could speak again.</p>
<p>Jeanie was the same as she had been from the first, only so quiet they could
hardly know how much she felt. She wouldn't leave the little cottage where she
had been so happy with Jim, and liked to work in the chair opposite to where
Jim used to sit and smoke his pipe in the evenings. Most of her friends lived
in Melbourne, and she reckoned to stay there for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>As to father, they had never heard a word from him&mdash;hardly knew whether
he was dead or alive. There was some kind of report that Warrigal had been seen
making towards Nulla Mountain, looking very weak and miserable, on a knocked-up
horse; but they did not know whether it was true or false.</p>
<p>Poor Aileen stopped till we were all locked up for the night. She seemed as
if she couldn't bear to leave me. She had no more hope or tie in life, she
said. I was the only one of her people she was likely to see again, and this
was the last time&mdash;the last time.</p>
<p>'Oh, Dick! oh, my poor lost brother,' she said, 'how clearly I seem to see
all things now. Why could we not do so before? I have had my sinful worldly
dream of happiness, and death has ended it. When I heard of his death and Jim's
my heart turned to stone. All the strength I have shall be given to religion
from this out. I can ease my heart and mortify the flesh for the good of my
soul. To God&mdash;to the Holy Virgin&mdash;who hears the sorrows of such as
me, I can pray day and night for their souls' welfare&mdash;for mine, for
yours. And oh, Dick! think when that day, that dreadful day, comes that Aileen
is praying for you&mdash;will pray for you till her own miserable life ends.
And now good-bye; we shall meet on this earth no more. Pray&mdash;say that you
will pray&mdash;pray now that we may meet in heaven.'</p>
<p>She half drew me to my knees. She knelt down herself on the cold stone floor
of the cell; and I&mdash;well&mdash;I seemed to remember the old days when we
were both children and used to kneel down by mother's bed, the three of us,
Aileen in the middle and one of us boys on each side. The old time came back to
me, and I cried like a child.</p>
<p>I wasn't ashamed of it; and when she stood up and said,
'Good-bye&mdash;good-bye, Dick,' I felt a sort of rushing of the blood to my
head, and all my wounds seemed as if they would break out again. I very near
fell down, what with one thing and another. I sat myself down on my bed, and I
hid my face in my hands. When I looked up she was gone.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>After that, day after day went on and I scarcely kept count, until somehow I
found out it was the last week. They partly told me on the Sunday. The
parson&mdash;a good, straight, manly man he was&mdash;he had me told for fear I
should go too close up to it, and not have time to prepare.</p>
<p>Prepare! How was a man like me to prepare? I'd done everything I'd a mind to
for years and years. Some good things&mdash;some bad&mdash;mostly bad. How was
I to repent? Just to say I was sorry for them. I wasn't that particular sorry
either&mdash;that was the worst of it. A deal of the old life was dashed good
fun, and I'd not say, if I had the chance, that I wouldn't do just the same
over again.</p>
<p>Sometimes I felt as if I ought to understand what the parson tried to hammer
into my head; but I couldn't do anything but make a jumble of it. It came
natural to me to do some things, and I did them. If I had stopped dead and
bucked at father's wanting me and Jim to help duff those weaners, I really
believe all might have come right. Jim said afterwards he'd made up his mind to
have another try at getting me to join with George Storefield in that fencing
job. After that we could have gone into the outside station work with
him&mdash;just the thing that would have suited the pair of us; and what a
grand finish we might have made of it if we ran a waiting race; and where were
we now?&mdash;Jim dead, Aileen dead to the world, and me to be hanged on
Thursday, poor mother dead and broken-hearted before her time. We couldn't have
done worse. We might, we must have, done better.</p>
<p>I did repent in that sort of way of all we'd done since that first wrong
turn. It's the wrong turn-off that makes a man lose his way; but as for the
rest I had only a dull, heavy feeling that my time was come, and I must make
the best of it, and meet it like a man.</p>
<p>So the day came. The last day! What a queer feeling it was when I lay down
that night, that I should never want to sleep again, or try to do it. That I
had seen the sun set&mdash;leastways the day grow dark&mdash;for the last time;
the very last time.</p>
<p>Somehow I wasn't that much in fear of it as you might think; it was strange
like, but made one pull himself together a bit. Thousands and millions of
people had died in all sorts of ways and shapes since the beginning of the
world. Why shouldn't I be able to go through with it like another?</p>
<p>I was a long time lying and thinking before I thought of sleeping. All the
small, teeny bits of a man's life, as well as the big, seemed to come up before
me as I lay there&mdash;the first things I could recollect at Rocky Flat; then
the pony; mother a youngish woman; father always hard-looking, but so different
from what he came to be afterwards. Aileen a little girl, with her dark hair
falling over her shoulders; then a grown woman, riding her own horse, and full
of smiles and fun; then a pale, weeping woman all in black, looking like a
mourner at a funeral. Jim too, and Starlight&mdash;now galloping along through
the forest at night&mdash;laughing, drinking, enjoying themselves at Jonathan
Barnes's, with the bright eyes of Bella and Maddie shining with fun and
devilment.</p>
<p>Then both of them lying dead at the flat by Murrynebone
Creek&mdash;Starlight with the half-caste making his wild moan over him; Jim,
quiet in death as in life, lying in the grass, looking as if he had slid off
his horse in that hot weather to take a banje; and now, no get away, the
rope&mdash;the hangman!</p>
<p>I must have gone to sleep, after all, for the sun was shining into the cell
when I stirred, and I could see the chains on my ankles that I had worn all
these weary weeks. How could I sleep? but I had, for all that. It was daylight;
more than that&mdash;sunrise. I listened, and, sure enough, I heard two or
three of the bush-birds calling. It reminded me of being a boy again, and
listening to the birds at dawn just before it was time to get up. When I was a
boy!&mdash;was I ever a boy? How long was it ago&mdash;and now&mdash;O my God,
my God! That ever it should have come to this! What am I waiting for to hear
now? The tread of men; the smith that knocks the irons off the limbs that are
so soon to be as cold as the jangling chains. Yes! at last I hear their
footsteps&mdash;here they come!</p>
<p>The warder, the blacksmith, the parson, the head gaoler, just as I expected.
The smith begins to cut the rivets. Somehow they none of them look so solemn as
I expected. Surely when a man is to be killed by law, choked to death in cold
blood, people might look a bit serious. Mind you, I believe men ought to be
hanged. I don't hold with any of that rot that them as commits murder shouldn't
pay for it with their own lives. It's the only way they can pay for it, and
make sure they don't do it again. Some men can stand anything but the rope.
Prison walls don't frighten them; but Jack Ketch does. They can't gammon
him.</p>
<p>'Knock off his irons quick,' says Mr. Fairleigh, the parson; 'he will not
want them again just yet.'</p>
<p>'I didn't think you would make a joke of that sort, sir,' says I. 'It's a
little hard on a man, ain't it? But we may as well take it cheerful, too.'</p>
<p>'Tell him all, Mr. Strickland,' he says to the head gaoler. 'I see he can
bear it now.'</p>
<p>'Prisoner Richard Marston,' says the gaoler, standing up before me, 'it
becomes my duty to inform you that, owing to representations made in your
favour by the Hon. Mr. Falkland, the Hon. Mr. Storefield, and other gentlemen
who have interested themselves in your case, setting forth the facts that,
although mixed up with criminals and known to be present when the escort and
various other cases of robbery under arms have taken place, wherein life has
been taken, there is no distinct evidence of your having personally taken life.
On the other hand, in several instances, yourself, with the late James Marston
and the deceased person known as Starlight, have aided in the protection of
life and property. The Governor and the Executive Council have therefore
graciously been pleased to commute your sentence of death to that of fifteen
years' imprisonment.'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>When I came to I was lying on my blankets in a different cell, as I could
see by the shape of it. The irons didn't rattle when I moved. I was surprised
when I looked and saw they were took off. Bit by bit it all came back to me. I
was not to be hanged. My life was saved, if it was worth saving, by the two or
three good things we'd done in our time, and almost, I thought, more for poor
old Jim's sake than my own.</p>
<p>Was I glad or sorry now it was all over? I hardly knew. For a week or two I
felt as if they'd better have finished me off when I was ready and ha' done
with me, but after a while I began to feel different. Then the gaoler talked to
me a bit. He never said much to prisoners, and what he said he meant.</p>
<p>'Prisoner Marston,' says he, 'you'd better think over your situation and
don't mope. Make up your mind like a man. You may have friends that you'd like
to live for. Pull yourself together and face your sentence like a man. You're a
young man now, and you won't be an old one when you're let out. If your conduct
is uniformly good you'll be out in twelve years. Settle yourself to serve
that&mdash;and you're a lucky man to have no more&mdash;and you may have some
comfort in your life yet.'</p>
<p>Then he went out. He didn't wait to see what effect it had on me. If I
wasn't a fool, he thought to himself, I must take it in; if I was, nothing
would do me any good.</p>
<p>I took his advice, and settled myself down to think it over. It was a good
while&mdash;a weary lot of years to wait, year by year&mdash;but, still, if I
got out in twelve years I should not be so out and out broke down after
all&mdash;not much over forty, and there's a deal of life for a man sometimes
after that.</p>
<p>And then I knew that there would be one that would be true to me anyhow,
that would wait for me when I went out, and that would not be too proud to join
in her life with mine, for all that had come and gone. Well, this might give me
strength. I don't think anything else could, and from that hour I made up my
mind to tackle it steady and patient, to do the best I could, and to work out
my sentence, thankful for the mercy that had been showed me, and, if ever a man
was in this world, resolved to keep clear of all cross ways for the future.</p>
<p>So I began to steady myself and tried to bear it the best way I could. Other
men were in for long sentences, and they seemed to be able to keep alive, so
why shouldn't I? Just at the first I wasn't sure whether I could. Year after
year to be shut up there, with the grass growin' and the trees wavin' outside,
and the world full of people, free to walk or ride, to work or play, people
that had wives and children, and friends and relations&mdash;it seemed awful.
That I should be condemned to live in this shut-up tomb all those long, weary
years, and there was nothing else for it. I couldn't eat or sleep at first, and
kept starting up at night, thinking they was coming for me to carry me off to
the gallows. Then I'd dream that Jim and Starlight was alive, and that we'd all
got out of gaol and were riding through the bush at night to the Hollow again.
Then I'd wake up and know they were dead and I was here. Time after time I've
done that, and I was that broken down and low that I burst out crying like a
child.</p>
<h2>Chapter 52</h2>
<p>The months went on till I began to think it was a long time since anything
had been heard of father. I didn't expect to have a letter or anything, but I
knew he must take a run outside now and again; and so sure as he did it would
come to my ears somehow.</p>
<p>One day I had a newspaper passed in to me. It was against the regulations,
but I did get it for all that, and this was the first thing I saw:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>STRANGE DISCOVERY IN THE TURON DISTRICT.<br>
<br>
A remarkable natural formation, leading to curious results, was last week
accidentally hit upon by a party of prospectors, and by them made known to the
police of the district. It may tend to solve the doubts which for the last few
years have troubled the public at large with respect to the periodical
disappearance of a certain gang of bush-rangers now broken up.<br>
<br>
Accident led the gold miners, who were anxious to find a practicable track to
the gullies at the foot of Nulla Mountain, to observe a narrow winding way
apparently leading over the brow of the precipice on its western face. To their
surprise, half hidden by a fallen tree, they discovered a difficult but
practicable track down a gully which finally opened out into a broad
well-grassed valley of considerable extent, in which cattle and horses were
grazing.<br>
<br>
No signs of human habitation were at first visible, but after a patient search
a cave in the eastern angle of the range was discovered. Fires had been lighted
habitually near the mouth, and near a log two saddles and bridles&mdash;long
unused&mdash;lay in the tall grass. Hard by was stretched the body of a man of
swarthy complexion. Upon examination the skull was found to be fractured, as if
by some blunt instrument. A revolver of small size lay on his right side.<br>
<br>
Proceeding to the interior of the cave, which had evidently been used as a
dwelling for many years past, they came upon the corpse of another man, in a
sitting posture, propped up against the wall. One arm rested upon an empty
spirit-keg, beside which were a tin pannikin and a few rude cooking utensils.
At his feet lay the skeleton of a dog. The whole group had evidently been dead
for a considerable time. Further search revealed large supplies of clothes,
saddlery, arms, and ammunition&mdash;all placed in recesses of the
cave&mdash;besides other articles which would appear to have been deposited in
that secure receptacle many years since.<br>
<br>
As may be imagined, a large amount of interest, and even excitement, was caused
when the circumstances, as reported to the police, became generally known. A
number of our leading citizens, together with many of the adjoining station
holders, at once repaired to the spot. No difficulty was felt in identifying
the bodies as those of Ben Marston, the father of the two bush-rangers of that
name, and of Warrigal, the half-caste follower always seen in attendance upon
the chief of the gang, the celebrated Starlight.<br>
<br>
How the last members of this well-known, long-dreaded gang of freebooters had
actually perished can only be conjectured, but taking the surrounding
circumstances into consideration, and the general impression abroad that
Warrigal was the means of putting the police upon the track of Richard Marston,
which led indirectly to the death of his master and of James Marston, the most
probable solution would seem to be that, after a deep carouse, the old man had
taxed Warrigal with his treachery and brained him with the American axe found
close to the body. He had apparently then shot himself to avoid a lingering
death, the bullet found in his body having been probably fired by the
half-caste as he was advancing upon him axe in hand.<br>
<br>
The dog, well known by the name of Crib, was the property and constant
companion of Ben Marston, the innocent accomplice in many of his most daring
stock-raids. Faithful unto the end, with the deep, uncalculating love which
shames so often that of man, the dumb follower had apparently refused to
procure food for himself, and pined to death at the feet of his dead master.
Though the philanthropist may regret the untimely and violent end of men whose
courage and energy fitted them for better things, it cannot be denied that the
gain to society far exceeds the loss.<br>
<br>
When the recesses of the Hollow were fully explored, traces of rude but
apparently successful gold workings were found in the creeks which run through
this romantic valley&mdash;long as invisible as the fabled gold cities of
Mexico.<br>
<br>
We may venture to assert that no great time will be suffered to elapse ere the
whole of the alluvial will be taken up, and the Terrible Hollow, which some of
the older settlers assert to be its real name, will re-echo with the sound of
pick and shovel; perhaps to be the means of swelling those escorts which its
former inhabitants so materially lessened.<br>
<br>
With regard to the stock pasturing in the valley, a puzzling problem presented
itself when they came to be gathered up and yarded. The adjoining settlers who
had suffered from the depredations of the denizens of the Hollow were gladly
expectant of the recovery of animals of great value. To their great
disappointment, only a small number of the very aged bore any brand which could
be sworn to and legally claimed. The more valuable cattle and horses, evidently
of the choicest quality and the highest breeding, resembled very closely
individuals of the same breed stolen from the various proprietors. But they
were either unbranded or branded with a letter and numbers to which no
stock-owners in the district could lay claim.<br>
<br>
Provoking, as well as perplexing, was this unique state of matters&mdash;wholly
without precedent. For instance, Mr. Rouncival and his stud-groom could almost
have sworn to the big slashing brown mare, the image of the long-lost celebrity
Termagant, with the same crooked blaze down the face, the same legs, the same
high croup and peculiar way of carrying her head. She corresponded exactly in
age to the date on which the grand thoroughbred mare, just about to bring
forth, had disappeared from Buntagong. No reasonable doubt existed as to the
identity of this valuable animal, followed as she was by several of her
progeny, equally aristocratic in appearance. Still, as these interesting
individuals had never been seen by their rightful owners, it was impossible to
prove a legal title.<br>
<br>
The same presumptive certainty and legal incompleteness existed concerning Mr.
Bowe's short-horns (as he averred) and Mr. Dawson's Devons.<br>
<br>
'Thou art so near and yet so far,'<br>
<br>
as a provoking stock-rider hummed. Finally, it was decided by the officials in
charge to send the whole collection to the public pound, when each proprietor
might become possessed of his own, with a good and lawful title in
addition&mdash;for 'a consideration'&mdash;and to the material benefit of the
Government coffers.</blockquote>
<p>So it was this way the poor old Hollow was dropped on to, and the
well-hidden secret blown for ever and ever. Well, it had been a good plant for
us and them as had it before our time. I don't expect there'll ever be such a
place again, take it all round.</p>
<p>And that was the end of father! Poor old dad! game to the last. And the dog,
too!&mdash;wouldn't touch bit or sup after the old man dropped. Just like Crib
that was! Often and often I used to wonder what he saw in father to be so fond
of him. He was about the only creature in the wide world that was fond of
dad&mdash;except mother, perhaps, when she was young. She'd rather got wore out
of her feelings for him, too. But Crib stuck to him to his end&mdash;faithful
till death, as some of them writing coves says.</p>
<p>And Warrigal! I could see it all, sticking out as plain as a fresh track
after rain. He'd come back to the Hollow, like a fool&mdash;in spite of me
warning him&mdash;or because he had nowhere else to go. And the first time dad
had an extra glass in his head he tackled him about giving me away and being
the means of the other two's death. Then he'd got real mad and run at him with
the axe. Warrigal had fired as he came up, and hit him too; but couldn't stop
him in the rush. Dad got in at him, and knocked his brains out there and then.
Afterwards, he'd sat down and drank himself pretty well blind; and then,
finding the pains coming on him, and knowing he couldn't live, finished himself
off with his own revolver.</p>
<p>It was just the way I expected he would make an ending. He couldn't do much
all alone in his line. The reward was a big one, and there would be always some
one ready to earn it. Jim and Starlight were gone, and I was as good as dead.
There wasn't much of a call for him to keep alive. Anyhow, he died game, and
paid up all scores, as he said himself.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>I don't know that there's much more for me to say. Here I am boxed up, like
a scrubber in a pound, year after year&mdash;and years after that&mdash;for I
don't know how long. However, O my God! how ever shall I stand it? Here I lie,
half my time in a place where the sun never shines, locked up at five o'clock
in my cell, and the same door with never a move in it till six o'clock next
morning. A few hours' walk in a prison yard, with a warder on the wall with a
gun in his hand overhead. Then locked up again, Sundays and week-days, no
difference. Sometimes I think they'd better have hanged me right off. If I feel
all these things now I've only been a few months doing my sentence, how about
next year, and the year after that, and so on, and so on? Why, it seems as if
it would mount up to more than a man's life&mdash;to ten lives&mdash;and then
to think how easy it might all have been saved.</p>
<p>There's only one thing keeps me alive; only for that I'd have starved to
death for want of having the heart to eat or drink either, or else have knocked
my brains out against the wall when one of them low fits came over me. That one
thing's the thought of Gracey Storefield.</p>
<p>She couldn't come to me, she wrote, just yet, but she'd come within the
month, and I wasn't to fret about her, because whether it was ten years or
twenty years if she was alive she'd meet me the day after I was free, let who
will see her. I must be brave and keep up my spirits for her sake and Aileen's,
who, though she was dead to the world, would hear of my being out, and would
always put my name in her prayers. Neither she nor I would be so very old, and
we might have many years of life reasonably happy yet in spite of all that had
happened. So the less I gave way and made myself miserable, the younger I
should look and feel when I came out. She was sure I repented truly of what I
had done wrong in the past; and she for one, and George&mdash;good, old, kind
George&mdash;had said he would go bail that I would be one of the squarest men
in the whole colony for the future. So I was to live on, and hope and pray God
to lighten our lot for her sake.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>It must be years and years since that time as I last wrote about. Awful long
and miserable the time went at first; now it don't go so slow somehow. I seemed
to have turned a corner. How long is it? It must be a hundred years. I have had
different sorts of feelings. Sometimes I feel ashamed to be alive. I think the
man that knocked his head against the wall of his cell the day he was sentenced
and beat his brains out in this very gaol had the best of it. Other times I
take things quite easy, and feel as if I could wait quite comfortable and
patient-like till the day came. But&mdash;will it? Can it ever come that I
shall be a free man again?</p>
<p>People have come to see me a many times, most of them the first year or two
I was in. After that they seemed to forget me, and get tired of coming. It
didn't make much odds.</p>
<p>But one visitor I had regular after the first month or two. Gracey, poor
Gracey, used to come and see me twice a year. She said it wouldn't do her or me
any good to come oftener, and George didn't want her to. But them two times she
always comes, and, if it wasn't for that, I don't think I'd ever have got
through with it. The worst of it was, I used to be that low and miserable after
she went, for days and days after, that it was much as I could do to keep from
giving in altogether. After a month was past I'd begin to look forward to the
next time.</p>
<p>When I'd done over eleven years&mdash;eleven years! how did I ever do it?
but the time passed, and passed somehow&mdash;I got word that they that I knew
of was making a try to see if I couldn't be let out when I'd done twelve years.
My regular sentence was fifteen, and little enough too. Anyhow, they knock off
a year or two from most of the long-sentence men's time, if they've behaved
themselves well in gaol, and can show a good conduct ticket right through.</p>
<p>Well, I could do that. I was too low and miserable to fight much when I went
in; besides, I never could see the pull of kicking up rows and giving trouble
in a place like that. They've got you there fast enough, and any man that won't
be at peace himself, or let others be, is pretty sure to get the worst of it.
I'd seen others try it, and never seen no good come of it. It's like a dog on
the chain that growls and bites at all that comes near him. A man can take a
sapling and half kill him, and the dog never gets a show unless he breaks his
chain, and that don't happen often.</p>
<p>Well, I'd learned carpentering and had a turn at mat-making and a whole lot
of other things. They kept me from thinking, as I said before, and the neater I
did 'em and the more careful I worked the better it went with me. As for my
mats, I came quite to be talked about on account of 'em. I drew a regular good
picture of Rainbow, and worked it out on a mat with different coloured thrums,
and the number of people who came to see that mat, and the notice they took of
it, would surprise any one.</p>
<p>When my twelve years was within a couple of months or so of being up I began
to hear that there was a deal of in-and-out sort of work about my getting my
freedom. Old George Storefield and Mr. Falkland&mdash;both of 'em in the Upper
House&mdash;and one or two more people that had some say with the Government,
was working back and edge for me. There was a party on the other side that
wasn't willing as I should lose a day or an hour of my sentence, and that made
out I ought to have been hanged 'right away', as old Arizona Bill would have
said, when I was first taken. Well, I don't blame any of 'em for that; but if
they could have known the feelings of a man that's done a matter of twelve
years, and thinks he might&mdash;yes, might&mdash;smell the fresh air and feel
the grass under his feet in a week or two&mdash;well, they'd perhaps consider a
bit.</p>
<p>Whatever way it came out I couldn't say, but the big man of the Government
people at that time&mdash;the Minister that had his say in all these sort of
things&mdash;took it into his head that I'd had about enough of it, if I was to
be let out at all; that the steel had been pretty well taken out of me, and
that, from what he knew of my people and so on, I wasn't likely to trouble the
Government again. And he was right. All I wanted was to be let out a pardoned
man, that had done bad things, and helped in worse; but had paid&mdash;and paid
dear, God knows&mdash;for every pound he'd got crooked and every day he'd
wasted in cross work. If I'd been sent back for them three years, I do r'aly
believe something of dad's old savage blood would have come uppermost in me,
and I'd have turned reckless and revengeful like to my life's end.</p>
<p>Anyhow, as I said before, the Minister&mdash;he'd been into the gaol and had
a look once or twice&mdash;made up his mind to back me right out; and he put it
so before the Governor that he gave an order for my pardon to be made out, or
for me to be discharged the day my twelve years was up, and to let off the
other three, along of my good behaviour in the gaol, and all the rest of
it.</p>
<p>This leaked out somehow, and there was the deuce's own barney over it. When
some of the Parliament men and them sort of coves in the country that never
forgives anybody heard of it they began to buck, and no mistake. You'd have
thought every bush-ranger that ever had been shopped in New South Wales had
been hanged or kept in gaol till he died; nothing but petitions and letters to
the papers; no end of bobbery. The only paper that had a word to say on the
side of a poor devil like me was the 'Turon Star'. He said that 'Dick Marston
and his brother Jim, not to mention Starlight (who paid his debts at any rate,
unlike some people he could name who had signed their names to this petition),
had worked manly and true at the Turon diggings for over a year. They were
respected by all who knew them, and had they not been betrayed by a revengeful
woman might have lived thenceforth a life of industry and honourable dealing.
He, for one, upheld the decision of the Chief Secretary. Thousands of the Turon
miners, men of worth and intelligence, would do the same.'</p>
<p>The Governor hadn't been very long in the colony, and they tried it on all
roads to get him to go back on his promise to me. They began bullying, and
flattering, and preaching at him if such a notorious criminal as Richard
Marston was to be allowed to go forth with a free pardon after a comparatively
short&mdash;short, think of that, short!&mdash;imprisonment, what a bad example
it will be to the rising generation, and so on.</p>
<p>They managed to put the thing back for a week or two till I was nearly drove
mad with fretting, and being doubtful which way it would go.</p>
<p>Lucky for me it was, and for some other people as well, the Governor was one
of those men that takes a bit of trouble and considers over a thing before he
says yes or no. When he says a thing he sticks to it. When he goes forward a
step he puts his foot down, and all the blowing, and cackle, and yelping in the
world won't shift him.</p>
<p>Whether the Chief Secretary would have taken my side if he'd known what a
dust the thing would have raised, and how near his Ministers&mdash;or whatever
they call 'em&mdash;was to going out along with poor Dick Marston, I can't
tell. Some people say he wouldn't. Anyhow, he stuck to his word; and the
Governor just said he'd given his decision about the matter, and he hadn't the
least intention of altering it&mdash;which showed he knew something of the
world, as well as intended to be true to his own opinions. The whole thing blew
over after a bit, and the people of the country soon found out that there
wasn't such another Governor (barrin' one) as the Queen had the sending out
of.</p>
<p>The day it was all settled the head gaoler comes to me, and says he,
'Richard Marston, the Governor and Council has been graciously pleased to order
that you be discharged from her Majesty's gaol upon the completion of twelve
years of imprisonment; the term of three years' further imprisonment being
remitted on account of your uniform good conduct while in the said gaol. You
are now free!'</p>
<p>I heard it all as if it had been the parson reading out of a book about some
other man. The words went into my ears and out again. I hardly heard them, only
the last word, free&mdash;free&mdash;free! What a blessed word it is! I
couldn't say anything, or make a try to walk out. I sat down on my blankets on
the floor, and wondered if I was going mad. The head gaoler walked over to me,
and put his hand on my shoulder. He was a kind enough man, but, from being
'took in' so often, he was cautious. 'Come, Dick,' he says, 'pull yourself
together. It's a shake for you, I daresay, but you'll be all right in a day or
so. I believe you'll be another man when you get out, and give the lie to these
fellows that say you'll be up to your old tricks in a month. I'll back you to
go straight; if you don't, you're not the man I take you for.'</p>
<p>I got up and steadied myself. 'I thank you with all my heart, Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;,' I said. 'I'm not much of a talker, but you'll see, you'll see;
that's the best proof. The fools, do they think I want to come back here? I
wish some of them had a year of it.'</p>
<p>As soon as there was a chance of my going out, I had been allowed to 'grow',
as they call it in there. That is, to leave off having my face scraped every
morning by the prison barber with his razor, that was sometimes sharp and more
times rough enough to rasp the skin off you, particularly if it was a cold
morning. My hair was let alone, too. My clothes&mdash;the suit I was taken in
twelve years ago&mdash;had been washed and cleaned and folded up, and put away
and numbered in a room with a lot of others. I remember I'd got 'em new just
before I started away from the Hollow. They was brought to me, and very well
they looked, too. I never had a suit that lasted that long before.</p>
<p>That minds me of a yarn I heard at Jonathan Barnes's one day. There was a
young chap that they used to call 'Liverpool Jack' about then. He was a free
kind of fellow, and good-looking, and they all took to him. He went away rather
sudden, and they heard nothing of him for about three years. Then he came back,
and as it was the busy season old Jonathan put him on, and gave him work. It
was low water with him, and he seemed glad to get a job.</p>
<p>When the old man came in he says, 'Who do you think came up the road
to-day?&mdash;Liverpool Jack. He looked rather down on his luck, so I gave him
a job to mend up the barn. He's a handy fellow. I wonder he doesn't save more
money. He's a careful chap, too.'</p>
<p>'Careful,' says Maddie. 'How do ye make that out?'</p>
<p>'Why,' says Jonathan, 'I'm dashed if he ain't got the same suit of clothes
on he had when he was here three years ago.'</p>
<p>The old man didn't tumble, but both the girls burst out laughing. He'd been
in the jug all the time!</p>
<p>I dressed myself in my own clothes&mdash;how strange it seemed&mdash;even to
the boots, and then I looked in the glass. I hadn't done that lately. I
regularly started back; I didn't know myself; I came into prison a big, stout,
brown-haired chap, full of life, and able to jump over a dray and bullocks
almost. I did once jump clean over a pair of polers for a lark.</p>
<p>And how was I going out? A man with a set kind of face, neither one thing
nor the other, as if he couldn't be glad or sorry, with a fixed staring look
about the eyes, a half-yellowish skin, with a lot of wrinkles in it,
particularly about the eyes, and gray hair. Big streaks of gray in the hair of
the head, and as for my beard it was white&mdash;white. I looked like an old
man, and walked like one. What was the use of my going out at all?</p>
<p>When I went outside the walls by a small gate the head gaoler shook hands
with me. 'You're a free man now, Dick,' he says, 'and remember this&mdash;no
man can touch you. No man has the right to pull you up or lay a finger on you.
You're as independent as the best gentleman in the land so long as you keep
straight. Remember that. I see there's a friend waiting for you.'</p>
<p>Sure enough there was a man that I knew, and that lived near Rocky Flat. He
was a quiet, steady-going sort of farmer, and never would have no truck with us
in our flash times. He was driving a springcart, with a good sort of horse in
it.</p>
<p>'Come along with me, Dick,' says he. 'I'm going your way, and I promised
George Storefield I'd call and give you a lift home. I'm glad to see you out
again, and there's a few more round Rocky Flat that's the same.'</p>
<p>We had a long drive&mdash;many a mile to go before we were near home. I
couldn't talk; I didn't know what to say, for one thing. I could only feel as
if I was being driven along the road to heaven after coming from the other
place. I couldn't help wondering whether it was possible that I was a free man
going back to life and friends and happiness. Was it possible? Could I ever be
happy again? Surely it must be a dream that would all melt away, and I'd wake
up as I'd done hundreds of times and find myself on the floor of the cell, with
the bare walls all round me.</p>
<p>When we got nearer the old place I began to feel that queer and strange that
I didn't know which way to look. It was coming on for spring, and there'd been
a middling drop of rain, seemingly, that had made the grass green and
everything look grand. What a time had passed over since I thought whether it
was spring, or summer, or winter! It didn't make much odds to me in there, only
to drive me wild now and again with thinkin' of what was goin' on outside, and
how I was caged up and like to be for months and years.</p>
<p>Things began little by little to look the way they used to do long and long
ago. Now it was an old overhanging limb that had arched over the road since we
were boys; then there was a rock with a big kurrajong tree growing near it.
When we came to the turn off where we could see Nulla Mountain everything came
back to me. I seemed to have had two lives; the old one&mdash;then a time when
I was dead, or next door to it&mdash;now this new life. I felt as if I was just
born.</p>
<p>'We'll get down here now,' I said, when we came near the dividing fence; 'it
ain't far to walk. That's your road.'</p>
<p>'I'll run you up to the door,' says he, 'it isn't far; you ain't used to
walking much.'</p>
<p>He let out his horse and we trotted through the paddock up to the old
hut.</p>
<p>'The garden don't look bad,' says he. 'Them peaches always used to bear well
in the old man's time, and the apples and quinces too. Some one's had it took
care on and tidied up a bit. There, you've got a friend or two left, old man.
And I'm one, too,' says he, putting out his hand and giving mine a shake.
'There ain't any one in these parts as 'll cast it up to you as long as you
keep straight. You can look 'em all in the face now, and bygones 'll be
bygones.'</p>
<p>Then he touched up his horse and rattled off before I could so much as say
'Thank ye.'</p>
<p>I walked through the garden and sat down in the verandah on one of the old
benches. There was the old place, mighty little altered considering. The hut
had been mended up from time to time&mdash;now a slab and then a sheet of
bark&mdash;else it would have been down long enough ago. The garden had been
dug up, and the trees trimmed year by year. A hinge had been put on the old
gate, and a couple of slip-rails at the paddock. The potato patch at the bottom
of the garden was sown, and there were vegetables coming on in the old beds.
Some one had looked after the place; of course, I knew who it was.</p>
<p>It began to get coldish, and I pulled the latch&mdash;it was there just the
same&mdash;and went into the old room. I almost expected to see mother in her
chair, and father on the stool near the fireplace, where he used to sit and
smoke his pipe. Aileen's was a little low chair near mother's. Jim and I used
to be mostly in the verandah, unless it was very cold, and then we used to lie
down in front of the fire&mdash;that is, if dad was away, as he mostly was.</p>
<p>The room felt cold and dark as I looked in. So dreadful lonely, too. I
almost wished I was back in the gaol.</p>
<p>When I looked round again I could see things had been left ready for me, so
as I wasn't to find myself bad off the first night. The fire was all made up
ready to light, and matches on the table ready. The kettle was filled, and a
basket close handy with a leg of mutton, and bread, butter, eggs, and a lot of
things&mdash;enough to last me a week. The bedroom had been settled up too, and
there was a good, comfortable bed ready for any tired man to turn into. Better
than all, there was a letter, signed 'Your own Gracey,' that made me think I
might have some life left worth living yet.</p>
<p>I lit the fire, and after a bit made shift to boil some tea; and after I'd
finished what little I could eat I felt better, and sat down before the fire to
consider over things. It was late enough&mdash;midnight&mdash;before I turned
in. I couldn't sleep then; but at last I must have dropped off, because the sun
was shining into the room, through the old window with the broken shutter, when
I awoke.</p>
<p>At first I didn't think of getting up. Then I knew, all of a sudden, that I
could open the door and go out. I was in the garden in three seconds, listening
to the birds and watching the clouds rising over Nulla Mountain.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>That morning, after breakfast, I saw two people, a man and a woman, come
riding up to the garden gate. I knew who it was as far as I could see
'em&mdash;George Storefield and Gracey. He lifted her down, and they walked up
through the garden. I went a step or two to meet them. She ran forward and
threw herself into my arms. George turned away for a bit. Then I put her by,
and told her to sit down on the verandah while I had a talk with George. He
shook hands with me, and said he was glad to see me a free man again. 'I've
worked a bit, and got others to work too,' says he; 'mostly for her, and partly
for your own sake, Dick. I can't forget old times. Now you're your own man
again, and I won't insult you by saying I hope you'll keep so; I know it, as
sure as we stand here.'</p>
<p>'Look here, George,' I said, 'as there's a God in heaven, no man shall ever
be able to say a word against me again. I think more of what you've done for me
almost than of poor Gracey's holding fast. It came natural to her. Once a woman
takes to a man, it don't matter to her what he is. But if you'd thrown me off
I'd have not blamed you. What's left of Dick Marston's life belongs to her and
you.'</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>That day week Gracey and I were married, very quiet and private. We thought
we'd have no one at the little church at Bargo but George and his wife, the old
woman, and the chap as drove me home. Just as we were going into the church who
should come rattling up on horseback but Maddie Barnes and her
husband&mdash;Mrs. Moreton, as she was now, with a bright-looking boy of ten or
eleven on a pony. She jumps off and gives the bridle to him. She looked just
the same as ever, a trifle stouter, but the same saucy look about the eyes.
'Well, Dick Marston,' says she, 'how are you? Glad to see you, old man. You've
got him safe at last, Gracey, and I wish you joy. You came to Bella's wedding,
Dick, and so I thought I'd come to yours, though you kept it so awful quiet.
How d'ye think the old horse looks?'</p>
<p>'Why, it's never Rainbow?' says I. 'It's twelve years and over since I saw
him last.'</p>
<p>'I didn't care if it was twenty,' said she. 'Here he is, and goes as sound
as a bell. His poor old teeth are getting done, but he ain't the only one that
way, is he, Joe? He'll never die if I can keep him alive. I have to give him
corn-meal, though, so as he can grind it easy.'</p>
<p>'I believe she thinks more of that old moke than me and the children all put
together,' says Joe Moreton.</p>
<p>'And why shouldn't I?' says Maddie, facing round at him just the old way.
'Isn't he the finest horse that ever stood on legs, and didn't he belong to the
finest gentleman that you or any one else looked at? Don't say a word against
him, for I can't stand it. I believe if you was to lay a whip across that old
horse in anger I'd go away and leave you, Joe Moreton, just as if you was a
regular black stranger. Poor Rainbow! Isn't he a darling?' Here she stroked the
old horse's neck. He was rolling fat, and had a coat like satin. His legs were
just as clean as ever, and he stood there as if he heard everything, moving his
old head up and down the way he always did&mdash;never still a moment. It
brought back old times, and I felt soft enough, I tell you. Maddie's lips were
trembling again, too, and her eyes like two coals of fire. As for Joe, he said
nothing more, and the best thing too. The boy led Rainbow over to the fence,
and old George walked us all into the church, and that settled things.</p>
<p>After the words were said we all went back to George's together, and Maddie
and her husband drank a glass of wine to our health, and wished us luck. They
rode as far as the turn off to Rocky Flat with us, and then took the Turon
road.</p>
<p>'Good-bye, Dick,' says Maddie, bending down over the old horse's neck.
'You've got a stunning good wife now, if ever any man had in the whole world.
Mind you're an A1 husband, or we'll all round on you, and your life won't be
worth having; and I've got the best horse in the country, haven't I? See where
the bullet went through his poor neck. There's no lady in the land got one
that's a patch on him. Steady, now, Rainbow, we'll be off in a minute. You
shall see my little Jim there take him over a hurdle yard. He can ride a bit,
as young as he is. Pity poor old Jim ain't here to-day, isn't it, Dick? Think
of him being cold in his grave now, and we here. Well, it's no use crying, is
it?'</p>
<p>And off went Maddie at a pace that gave Joe and the boy all they knew to
catch her.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>We're to live here for a month or two till I get used to outdoor work and
the regular old bush life again. There's no life like it, to my fancy. Then we
start, bag and baggage, for one of George's Queensland stations, right away up
on the Barcoo, that I'm to manage and have a share in.</p>
<p>It freshens me up to think of making a start in a new country. It's a long
way from where we were born and brought up; but all the better for that. Of
course they'll know about me; but in any part of Australia, once a chap shows
that he's given up cross doings and means to go straight for the future, the
people of the country will always lend him a helping hand, particularly if he's
married to such a wife as Gracey. I'm not afraid of any of my troubles in the
old days being cast up to me; and men are so scarce and hard to get west of the
Barcoo that no one that once had Dick Marston's help at a muster is likely to
remind him of such an old story as that of 'Robbery Under Arms'.</p>
