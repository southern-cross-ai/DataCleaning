<h1><b>Shearing In The Riverina, New South Wales</b></h1>
<p align="center">Rolf Boldrewood</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shearing commences to-morrow!&rdquo; These apparently simple words
    were spoken by Hugh Gordon, the manager of Anabanco station, in the district
    of Riverina, in the colony of New South Wales, one Monday morning in the
    month of August. The utterance had its importance to every member of a rather
    extensive &ldquo;corps dramatique&rdquo; awaiting the industrial drama about
    to be performed.</p>
  <p>A low sand-hill a few years since had looked out over a sea of grey plains,
    covered partly with grass, partly with salsiferous bushes and herbs. Two
    or three huts built of the trunks of the pine and roofed with the bark of
    the box-tree, and a skeleton-looking cattle-yard with its high &ldquo;gallows&rdquo;  (a
    rude timber stage whereon to hang slaughtered cattle) alone broke the monotony
    of the plain-ocean. A comparatively small herd of cattle, 2000 or 3000, found
    more than sufficient pasturage during the short winter and spring, but were
    always compelled to migrate to mountain pastures when the swamps, which alone
    in those days formed the water-stores of the run, were dried up. But two
    or three, or at most half-a-dozen, stockmen were ever needed for the purpose
    of managing the herd, so inadequate in number and profitable occupation to
    this vast tract of grazing country.</p>
  <p>But, a little later, one of the great chiefs of the wool-producing interest&mdash;a
    shepherd-king, so to speak, of shrewdness, energy, and capital&mdash;had
    seen, approved and purchased the lease of this waste kingdom. Almost at once,
    as if by magic, the scene changed. Great gangs of navvies appeared, wending
    their way across the silent plain. Dams were made, wells were dug. Tons of
    fencing wire were dropped on the sand by the long line of teams which seemed
    never tired of arriving. Sheep by thousands, and tens of thousands, began
    to come, grazing and cropping up to the lonely sandhill&mdash;now swarming
    with blacksmiths, carpenters, engineers, fencers, shepherds, bullock-drivers&mdash;till
    the place looked like a fair on the borders of Tartary.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile everything was moving with calculated force and cost, under the &ldquo;reign
    of law&rdquo;. The seeming expense was merely the economic truth of doing
    all the necessary work at once, rather than by instalments. One hundred men
    for one day rather than one man for one hundred days. Results soon began
    to demonstrate themselves. In twelve months the dams were full, the wells
    sending up their far-fetched priceless water, the wire fences erected, the
    shepherds gone, and 17,000 sheep cropping the herbage of Anabanco. Tuesday
    was the day fixed for the actual commencement of the momentous, almost solemn
    transaction&mdash;the pastoral Hegira, so to speak, as the time of most station
    events is calculated with reference to it, as happening before or after shearing.
    But before the first shot is fired which tells of the battle begun, what
    raids and skirmishes, what reconnoitring and vedette duty must take place!</p>
  <p>First arrives the cook-in-chief to the shearers, with two assistants to
    lay in a few provisions for the week&rsquo;s consumption of 70 able-bodied
    men. I must here explain that the cook of a large shearing-shed is a highly
    paid and tolerably irresponsible official. He is paid and provided by the
    shearers. Payment is generally arranged on the scale of half-a-crown a head
    weekly from each shearer. For this sum he must provide punctual and effective
    cooking, paying out of his own pocket as many &ldquo;marmitons&rdquo; as
    may be needful for that end, and to satisfy his tolerably exacting and fastidious
    employers.</p>
  <p>In the present case he confers with the storekeeper, Mr. De Vere, a young
    gentleman of aristocratic connexions who is thus gaining an excellent practical
    knowledge of the working of a large station and to this end has the store-keeping
    department entrusted to him during shearing.</p>
  <p>He does not perhaps look quite fit for a croquet party as he stands now,
    with a flour-scoop in one hand and a pound of tobacco in the other. But he
    looks like a man at work, and also like a gentleman, as he is. &ldquo;Jack
    the Cook&rdquo; thus addresses him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. De Vere, I hope there&rsquo;s not going to be any humbugging
    about my rations and things! The men are all up in their quarters, and as
    hungry as free selectors. They&rsquo;ve been a-payin&rsquo; for their rations
    for ever so long, and of course now shearing&rsquo;s on, they&rsquo;re good
    for a little extra!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Jack,&rdquo; returns De Vere, good-temperedly, &ldquo;all
    your lot was weighed out and sent away before breakfast. You must have missed
    the cart. Here&rsquo;s the list. I&rsquo;ll read it out to you: three bags
    flour, half a bullock, two bags sugar, a chest of tea, four dozen of pickles,
    four dozen of jam, two gallons of vinegar, five pounds pepper, a bag of salt,
    plates, knives, forks, ovens, frying-pans, saucepans, iron pots, and about
    a hundred other things. Now, mind you, return all the cooking things safe,
    or <i>pay for them</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s the order! You don&rsquo;t want
    anything more, do you? You&rsquo;ve got enough for a regiment of cavalry,
    I should think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. There won&rsquo;t be much left in a week
    if the weather holds good,&rdquo; makes answer the chef, as one who thought
    nothing too stupendous to be accomplished by shearers, &ldquo;but I knew
    I&rsquo;d forgot something. As I&rsquo;m here I&rsquo;ll take a few dozen
    boxes of sardines, and a case of pickled salmon. The boys likes &rsquo;em,
    and, murder alive! haven&rsquo;t we forgot the plums and currants? A hundredweight
    of each, Mr. De Vere! They&rsquo;ll be crying out for plum-duff and currant
    buns for the afternoon; and bullying the life out of me, if I haven&rsquo;t
    a few trifles like. It&rsquo;s a hard life, surely, a shearers&rsquo; cook.
    Well, good-bye, sir, you have &rsquo;em all down in the book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lest the reader should imagine that the role of Mr. Gordon at Anabanco was
    a reign of luxury and that waste which tendeth to penury, let him be aware
    that all shearers in Riverina are paid at a certain rate, usually that of
    one pound per hundred sheep shorn. They agree, on the other hand, to pay
    for all supplies consumed by them at certain prices fixed before the shearing
    agreement is signed. Hence, it is entirely their own affair whether their
    mess bills are extravagant or economical. They can have anything within the
    rather wide range of the station store. <i>P&aacute;t&eacute;s de foie gras</i>,
    ortolans, roast ostrich, novels, top-boots, double-barrelled guns, <i>if
    they like to pay for them</i>&mdash;with one exception. No wine, no spirits!
    Neither are they permitted to bring these stimulants &ldquo;on to the grounds&rdquo; for
    their private use. Grog at shearing? Matches in a powder-mill! It&rsquo;s
    very sad and bad; but our Anglo-Saxon industrial or defensive champion cannot
    be trusted with the fire-water. Navvies, men-of-war&rsquo;s men, soldiers, <i>and</i> shearers&mdash;fine
    fellows all. But though the younger men might only drink in moderation, the
    majority and the older men are utterly without self-control once in the front
    of temptation. And wars, &lsquo;wounds without cause,&rsquo; hot heads, shaking
    hands, delay and bad shearing, would be the inevitable results of spirits <i>&agrave; la
    discr&eacute;tion</i>. So much is this a matter of certainty from experience
    that a clause is inserted, and cheerfully signed, in most shearing agreements, &ldquo;that
    any man getting drunk or bringing spirits on to the station during shearing, <i>loses
    the whole of</i> the money earned by him.&rdquo; The men know that the restriction
    is for their benefit, as well as for the interest of the master, and join
    in the prohibition heartily.</p>
  <p>Let us give a glance at the small army of working-men assembled at Anabanco&mdash;one
    out of hundreds of stations in the colony of New South Wales, ranging from
    100,000 sheep downwards. There are seventy shearers; about fifty washers,
    including the men connected with the steam-engine, boilers, bricklayers and
    the like; ten or twelve boundary-riders, whose duty it is to ride round the
    large paddocks, seeing that the fences are all intact, and keeping a general
    look-out over the condition of the sheep; three or four overseers; half-a-dozen
    young gentlemen acquiring a practical knowledge of sheep-farming, or, as
    it is generally phrased, &ldquo;colonial experience&rdquo;&mdash;a comprehensive
    expression enough; a score or two of teamsters, with a couple of hundred
    horses or bullocks, waiting for the high-piled wool bales, which are loaded
    up and sent away almost as soon as shorn; wool-sorters, pickers-up, pressers,
    yardsmen, extra shepherds. It may easily be gathered from this outline what
    an &lsquo;army with banners&rsquo; is arrayed at Anabanco. While statistically
    inclined, it may be added that the cash due for the shearing alone (less
    the mess bill) amounts to 1700 pounds; for the washing (roughly), 400 pounds,
    exclusive of provisions consumed, hutting, wood, water, cooking. Carriage
    of wool 1500 pounds. Other hands from 30 pounds to 40 pounds per week. All
    of which disbursements take place within from eight to twelve weeks after
    the shears are in the first sheep.</p>
  <p>Tuesday comes &ldquo;big with fate.&rdquo; As the sun tinges the far skyline,
    the shearers are taking a slight refection of coffee and currant buns to
    enable them to withstand the exhausting interval between six and eight o&rsquo;clock,
    when the serious breakfast occurs. Shearers always diet themselves on the
    principle that the more they eat the stronger they must be. Digestion, as
    preliminary to muscular development, is left to take its chance. They certainly
    do get through a tremendous amount of work. The whole frame is at its utmost
    tension, early and late. But the preservation of health is due to their natural
    strength of constitution rather than to their profuse and unscientific diet.
    Half-an-hour after sunrise Mr. Gordon walks quietly into the vast building
    which contains the sheep and their shearers&mdash;called &ldquo;the shed,&rdquo; par
    excellence. Everything is in perfect cleanliness and order&mdash;the floor
    swept and smooth, with its carefully planed boards of pale yellow aromatic
    pine. Small tramways, with baskets for the fleeces, run the wool up to the
    wool tables, superseding the more general plan of hand picking. At each side
    of the shed floor are certain small areas, four or five feet square, such
    space being found by experience to be sufficient for the postures and gymnastics
    practised during the shearing of a sheep. Opposite to each square is an aperture,
    communicating with a long narrow paled yard, outside of the shed. Through
    this each man pops his sheep when shorn, where he remains in company with
    the others shorn by the same hand, until counted out. This being done by
    the overseer or manager supplies a check upon hasty or unskilful work. The
    body of the woolshed, floored with battens placed half an inch apart, is
    filled with the woolly victims. This enclosure is subdivided into minor pens,
    of which each fronts the place of two shearers, who catch from it until the
    pen is empty. When this takes place, a man for the purpose refills it. As
    there are local advantages, an equitable distribution of places for shearing
    has to be made by lot.</p>
  <p>On every subdivision stands a shearer, as Mr. Gordon walks, with an air
    of calm authority, down the long aisle. Seventy men, chiefly in their prime,
    the flower of the working-men of the colony, they are variously gathered.
    England, Ireland, and Scotland are represented in the proportion of one half
    of the number; the other half is composed of native-born Australians.</p>
  <p>Among these last&mdash;of pure Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Celtic descent&mdash;are
    to be seen some of the finest men, physically considered, the race is capable
    of producing. Taller than their British-born brethren, with softer voices
    and more regular features, they inherit the powerful frames and unequalled
    muscular development of the breed. Leading lives chiefly devoted to agricultural
    labour, they enjoy larger intervals of leisure than is permissible to the
    labouring classes of Europe. The climate is mild, and favourable to health.
    They have been accustomed from childhood to abundance of the best food; opportunities
    of intercolonial travel are frequent and common. Hence the Anglo-Australian
    labourer without, on the one hand, the sharpened eagerness which marks his
    Transatlantic cousin, has yet an air of independence and intelligence, combined
    with a natural grace of movement, unknown to the peasantry of Britain.</p>
  <p>An idea is prevalent that the Australians are, as a race, physically inferior
    to the British. It is asserted that they grow too fast, tend to height and
    slenderness, and do not possess adequate stamina and muscle. The idea is
    erroneous. The men reared in the cities on the seaboard, living sedentary
    lives in shops, banks, or counting-houses, are doubtless more or less pale
    and slight of form. So are they who live under such conditions all over the
    world. But those youngsters who have followed the plough on the upland farms,
    or lived a wilder life on the stations of the far interior, who have had
    their fill of wheaten bread and beefsteaks since they could walk, and snuffed
    up the free bush breezes from infancy, they are <i>men</i>&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">Stout of heart and ready of hand,<br>
    As e&rsquo;er drove prey from Cumberland;</p>
  <p>&mdash;a business, I may remark, at which many of them would have distinguished
    themselves.</p>
  <p>Take Abraham Lawson as he stands there in a natural and unstudied attitude,
    6 feet 4 inches in his stockings, wide-chested, stalwart, with a face like
    that of a Greek statue. Take Billy May, fair-haired, mild, insouciant, almost
    languid, till you see him at work. Then, again, Jack Windsor, handsome, saucy,
    and wiry as a bull-terrier and like him with strong natural inclination for
    the combat; good for any man of his weight, or a trifle over, with the gloves
    or without.</p>
  <p>It is curious to note how the old English practice of settling disputes
    with nature&rsquo;s weapons has taken root in Australia. It would &lsquo;gladden
    the sullen souls&rsquo; of the defunct gladiators to watch two lads, whose
    fathers had never trodden England&rsquo;s soil, pull off their jackets and
    go to work &ldquo;hammer and tongs,&rdquo; with all the savage silence of
    the true island type.</p>
  <p>It is now about seven o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Gordon moves forward. As he does
    so, every man leans towards the open door of the pen in front of which he
    stands. The bell sounds! With the first stroke each one of the seventy men
    has sprung upon a sheep&mdash;has drawn it out&mdash;placed its head across
    his knee&mdash;and is working his shears as if the &ldquo;last man out&rdquo; was
    to be flogged, or tarred and feathered at the least. Four minutes&mdash;James
    Steadman, who learned last year, has shorn down one side of his sheep; Jack
    Holmes and Gundagai Bill are well down the other sides of theirs; when Billy
    May raises himself with a jerking sigh, and releases his sheep, perfectly
    clean-shorn from the nose to the heels, through the aperture of his separate
    enclosure. With the same effort apparently he calls out &lsquo;Wool!&rsquo; and
    darts upon another sheep. Drawing this second victim across his knee, he
    buries his shear-points in the long wool of its neck. A moment after a lithe
    and eager boy has gathered up fleece number one, and tossed it into the train-basket,
    the shearer is halfway down the sheep&rsquo;s side, the wool hanging in one
    fleece like a great glossy mat, before you have done wondering whether he
    did really shear the first sheep, or whether he had not a ready-shorn one
    in his coat-sleeve&mdash;like a conjuror.</p>
  <p>By this time Jack Holmes and Gundagai Bill are &ldquo;out,&rdquo; or finished;
    and the cry of &ldquo;Wool! Wool!&rdquo; seems to run continuously up and
    down the long aisles of the shed, like a single note upon some rude instrument.
    Now and then the &ldquo;refrain&rdquo; is varied by &ldquo;Tar!&rdquo; being
    shouted instead, when a piece of skin is snipped off as well as the wool.
    Great healing properties are attributed to this extract in the shed. And
    if a shearer slice off a piece of flesh from his own person, as occasionally
    happens, he gravely anoints it with the universal remedy, and considers that
    the onus then lies with Providence, there being no more that man can do.
    Though little time is lost, the men are by no means up to the speed which
    they will attain in a few days, when in full practice and training. Their
    nerve, muscle, eye, endurance, will be all at, so to speak, concert-pitch,
    and sheep after sheep will be shorn with a precision and celerity even awful
    to the unprofessional observer.</p>
  <p>The unpastoral reader may be informed that speed and completeness of denudation
    are the grand desiderata in shearing; the employer thinks principally of
    the latter, the shearer principally of the former. To adjust equitably the
    proportion is one of those incomplete aspirations which torment humanity.
    Hence the contest&mdash;old as human society&mdash;between labour and capital.</p>
  <p>This is the first day. According to old-established custom, a kind of truce
    obtains. It is before the battle, the &ldquo;salut,&rdquo; when no hasty
    word or too demonstrative action can be suffered by the canons of good taste.
    Red Bill, Flash Jack, Jem the Scooper, and other roaring blades, more famous
    for expedition than faithful manipulation, are shearing today with a painstaking
    precision, as of men to whom character is everything.</p>
  <p>Mr. Gordon marches softly up and down, regarding the shearers with a paternal
    and gratified expression, occasionally hinting at slight improvements of
    style, or expressing unqualified approval as a sheep is turned out shaven
    rather than shorn. All goes on well. Nothing is heard but expressions of
    goodwill and enthusiasm for the general welfare. It is a triumph of the dignity
    of labour.</p>
  <p>One o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Gordon moved on to the bell and sounded it. At the
    first stroke several men on their way to the pens stopped abruptly and began
    to put on their coats. One fellow of an alert nature (Master Jack Windsor)
    had just finished his sheep and was sharpening his shears, when his eye caught
    Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s form in proximity to the final bell. With a bound like
    a wild cat, he reached the pen and drew out his sheep a bare second before
    the first stroke, amidst the laughter and congratulations of his comrades.
    Another man had his hand on the pen-gate at the same instant, but by the
    Median law was compelled to return sheepless. He was cheered, but ironically.
    Those whose sheep were in an unfinished stage quietly completed them; the
    others moving off to their huts, where their board literally smoked with
    abundance.</p>
  <p>An hour passed. The meal was concluded; the smoke was over; and the more
    careful men were back in the shed sharpening their shears by two o&rsquo;clock.
    Punctually at that hour the bell repeated its summons <i>da capo</i>. The
    warm afternoon gradually lengthened its shadows; the shears clicked in tireless
    monotone; the pens filled and became empty. The wool-presses yawned for the
    mountain of fleeces which filled the bins in front of them, divided into
    various grades of excellence, and continuously disgorged them, neatly and
    cubically packed and branded.</p>
  <p>At six o&rsquo;clock the bell brought the day&rsquo;s work to a close. The
    sheep of each man were counted in his presence, and noted down with scrupulous
    care, the record being written out in full and hung up for public inspection
    in the shed next day. This important ceremony over, master and men, manager,
    labourers and supernumeraries, betook themselves to their separate abodes,
    with such keen avoidance of delay that in five minutes not a soul was left
    in or near the great building lately so busy and populous, except the boys
    who were sweeping up the floor. The silence of ages seems to fall and settle
    upon it.</p>
  <p>Next morning at a rather earlier hour every man is at his post. Business
    is meant decidedly. Now commences the delicate and difficult part of the
    superintendence which keeps Mr. Gordon at his post in the shed, nearly from
    daylight till dark, for from eight to ten weeks. During the first day he
    has formed a sort of gauge of each man&rsquo;s temper and workmanship. For
    now, and henceforth, the natural bias of each shearer will appear. Some try
    to shear too fast, and in their haste shear badly. Some are rough and savage
    with the sheep, which do occasionally kick and become unquiet at critical
    times; and it must be confessed are provoking enough. Some shear very fairly
    and handsomely to a superficial eye, but commit the unpardonable offence
    of &ldquo;leaving wool on.&rdquo; Some are deceitful, shearing carefully
    when overlooked, but &ldquo;racing&rdquo; and otherwise misbehaving directly
    the eye of authority is diverted. These and many other tricks and defects
    require to be noted and abated, quietly but firmly, by the manager of the
    shed&mdash;firmly because evil would develop and spread ruinously if not
    checked; quietly because immense loss might be incurred by a strike. Shearing
    differs from other work in this wise: it is work against time, more especially
    in Riverina. If the wool be not off the backs of the sheep before November,
    all sorts of draw-backs and destructions supervene. The spear-shaped grass-seeds,
    specially formed as if in special collusion with the Evil One, hasten to
    bury themselves in the wool, and even in the flesh of the tender victims.
    Dust rises in red clouds from the unmoistened, betrampled meadows so lately
    verdurous and flower-spangled. From snowy white to an unlovely dark brown
    turn the carefully washed fleeces, causing anathema from overseers and depreciation
    from brokers. All these losses of temper, trouble, and money become inevitable
    if shearing be protracted, it may be, beyond a given week.</p>
  <p>Hence, as in harvest with a short allowance of fair weather, discipline
    must be tempered with diplomacy. Lose your temper, and be over particular:
    off go Billy May, Abraham Lawson, and half-a-dozen of your best men, making
    a weekly difference of perhaps two or three thousand sheep for the remainder
    of the shearing. Can you not replace them? Not so! Every shed in Riverina
    will be hard at work during this present month of September and for every
    hour of October. Till that time not a shearer will come to your gate, except,
    perhaps, one or two useless, characterless men. Are you to tolerate bad workmanship?
    Not that either. But try all other means with your men before you resort
    to harshness; and be quite certain that your sentence is just, and that you
    can afford the defection.</p>
  <p>So our friend Mr. Gordon, wise from many tens of thousands of shorn sheep
    that have been counted out past his steady eye, criticises temperately, but
    watchfully. He reproves sufficiently, and no more, any glaring fault; makes
    his calculation as to who are really bad shearers, and can be discharged
    without loss to the commonwealth, or who can shear fairly and can be coached
    up to a decent average. One division, slow, and good only when slow, have
    to be watched lest they emulate &ldquo;the talent,&rdquo; and so come to
    grief. Then &ldquo;the talent&rdquo; has to be mildly admonished from time
    to time lest they force the pace, set a bad example, and lure the other men
    on to &ldquo;racing.&rdquo; This last leads to slovenly shearing, ill-usage
    of the sheep, and general dissatisfaction.</p>
  <p>Tact, temper, patience, and firmness are each and all necessary in that
    Captain of Industry who has the very delicate and important task of superintending
    a large woolshed. Hugh Gordon had shown all in such proportion as would have
    made a distinguished man anywhere, had fortune not adjusted for him this
    particular profession. Calm with the consciousness of strength, he was kind
    and considerate in manner as in nature, until provoked by glaring dishonesty
    or incivility. Then the lion part of his nature woke up, so that it commonly
    went ill with the aggressor. As this was matter of public report, he had
    little occasion to spoil the repose of his bearing. Day succeeds day, and
    for a fortnight the machinery goes on smoothly and successfully. The sheep
    arrive at an appointed day and hour by detachments and regiments at the washpen.
    They depart thence, like good boys on Saturday night, redolent of soap and
    water, and clean to a fault. They enter the shed white and flossy as newly
    combed poodles to emerge, on the way back to their pasturage, slim, delicate,
    agile, with a bright black A legibly branded with tar on their paper-white
    skins.</p>
  <p>The Anabanco world&mdash;stiffish but undaunted&mdash;is turning out of
    bed one morning. Ha! what sounds are these? And why does the room look so
    dark? Rain, as I&rsquo;m alive. &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; says Master Jack Bowles,
    one of the young gentlemen. He is learning (more or less) practical sheep-farming,
    preparatory to having (one of these days) an Anabanco of his own. &ldquo;Well,
    this is a change, and I&rsquo;m not sorry for one,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Jack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    stiff all over. No one can stand such work long. Won&rsquo;t the shearers
    growl! No shearing to-day, and perhaps none tomorrow either.&rdquo; Truth
    to tell, Mr. Bowles&rsquo; sentiments are not confined to his ingenuous bosom.
    Some of the shearers grumble at being stopped &ldquo;just as a man was earning
    a few shillings.&rdquo; Those who are in top pace and condition don&rsquo;t
    like it. But to many of the rank and file&mdash;working up to and a little
    beyond their strength&mdash;with whom swelled wrists and other protests of
    nature are becoming apparent, it is a relief, and they are glad of the respite.
    So at dinner-time all the sheep in the sheds, put in overnight in anticipation
    of such a contingency, are reported shorn. All hands are then idle for the
    rest of the day. The shearers dress and avail themselves of various resources.
    Some go to look at their horses, now in clover, or its equivalent, in the
    Riverina graminetum. Some play cards, others wash or mend their clothes.
    A large proportion of the Australians having armed themselves with paper,
    envelopes, and a shilling&rsquo;s worth of stamps from the store, bethink
    themselves of neglected or desirable correspondents. Many a letter for Mrs
    Leftalone, Wallaroo Creek, or Miss Jane Sweetapple, Honeysuckle Flat, as
    the case may be, will find its way into the post-bag tomorrow. A pair of
    youngsters are having a round or two with the gloves; while to complete the
    variety of recreations compatible with life at a woolshed, a selected troupe
    are busy in the comparative solitude of that building, at a rehearsal of
    a tragedy and a farce, with which they intend, the very next rainy day, to
    astonish the population of Anabanco.</p>
  <p>At the home-station a truce to labour&rsquo;s &ldquo;alarms&rdquo; is proclaimed
    except in the case and person of Mr. De Vere. So far is he from participation
    in the general holiday that he finds the store thronged with shearers, washers,
    and &ldquo;knock-about men,&rdquo; who being let loose, think it would be
    nice to go and buy something &ldquo;pour passer le temps.&rdquo; He therefore
    grumbles slightly at having no rest like other people.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; says Mr. Jack Bowles, who, seated
    on a case, is smoking a large meerschaum and mildly regarding all things, &ldquo;but
    what have you got to do when we&rsquo;re all <i>hard at work</i> at the shed?&rdquo; He
    speaks with an air of great importance and responsibility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mr. Bowles,&rdquo; chimes in one of the shearers, &ldquo;stand
    up for the shed. I never see a young gentleman work as hard as you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; growls De Vere, &ldquo;as if anybody couldn&rsquo;t
    gallop about from the shed to the washpen, and carry messages, and give half
    of them wrong! Why, Mr. Gordon said the other day, he should have to take
    you off and put on a Chinaman&mdash;that he couldn&rsquo;t make more mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All envy and malice, and t&rsquo;other thing, De Vere, because you
    think I&rsquo;m rising in the profession,&rdquo; returns the good-natured
    Bowles, &ldquo;Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s going to send 20,000 sheep, after shearing,
    to the Lik Lak paddock, and he said I should go in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charge be hanged!&rdquo; laughs De Vere, with two very bright-patterned
    Crimean shirts, one in each hand, which he offers to a tall young shearer
    for inspection. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a well there, and whenever either of
    the two men, of whom you&rsquo;ll have <i>charge</i>, gets sick or runs away,
    you&rsquo;ll have to work the whim in his place, till another man&rsquo;s
    sent out, if it&rsquo;s a month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This appalling view of station promotion rather startles Mr. Jack, who applies
    himself to his meerschaum, amid the ironical comments of the shearers. However,
    not easily daunted or &ldquo;shut up,&rdquo; according to the more familiar
    station phrase, he rejoins, after a brief interval of contemplation, &ldquo;that
    accidents will happen, you know, De Vere, my boy&mdash;<i>&agrave; propos</i> of
    which moral sentiment, I&rsquo;ll come and help you in your dry-goods business;
    and then, look here, if <i>you</i> get ill or run away, I&rsquo;ll have a
    profession to fall back upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This is held to be a Roland of sufficient pungency for De Vere&rsquo;s Oliver.
    Everyone laughed. And then the two youngsters betook themselves to a humorous
    puffing of the miscellaneous contents of the store: tulip-beds of gorgeous
    Crimean shirts, boots, books, tobacco, canvas slippers, pocket-knives, Epsom
    salts, pipes, pickles, painkillers, pocket handkerchiefs, pills, sardines,
    saddles, shears and sauces: in fact everything which every kind of man might
    want, and which apparently every man did want, for large and various were
    the purchases, and great the flow of conversation. Finally, everything was
    severely and accurately debited to the purchasers, and the store was cleared
    and locked up. A large store is a necessity of a large station; not by any
    means because of the profit upon goods sold, but it obviously would be bad
    economy for old Bill, the shepherd, or Barney, the bullock-driver, to visit
    the next township, from ten to thirty miles distant, as the case may be,
    every time the former wanted a pound of tobacco, or the latter a pair of
    boots. They might possibly obtain these necessary articles as good in quality,
    as cheap in price. But there are wolves in that wood, oh, my weak brothers!
    In all towns dwells one of the &lsquo;sons of the Giant&rsquo;&mdash;the
    Giant Grog&mdash;red-eyed, with steel muscles and iron claws; once in these,
    which have held many and better men to the death, neither Barney nor Bill
    emerges, save pale, fevered, nerveless, and impecunious. So arose the station
    store. Barney befits himself with boots without losing his feet; Bill fills
    his pocket with match-boxes and smokes the pipe of sobriety, virtuous perforce
    till his carnival, after shearing.</p>
  <p>The next day was wet, and threatened further broken weather. Matters were
    not too placid with the shearers. A day or two for rest is very well, but
    continuous wet weather means compulsory idleness, and gloom succeeds repose;
    for not only are all hands losing time and earning no money, but they are,
    to use the language of the stable &ldquo;eating their heads off&rdquo; the
    while. The rather profuse mess and general expenditure, which caused little
    reflection when they were earning at the rate of two or three hundred pounds
    a year, became unpleasantly suggestive, now that all is going out and nothing
    coming in. Hence loud and deep were the anathemas as the discontented men
    gazed sadly or wrathfully at the misty sky.</p>
  <p>A few days showery weather having, therefore, wellnigh driven our shearers
    to desperation, out comes the sun in all his glory. He is never far away
    or very faint in Riverina. All the pens are filled for the morrow; very soon
    after the earliest sunbeams the bell sounds its welcome summons, and the
    whole force tackles to the work with an ardour proportioned to the delay,
    every man working as if for the ransom of his whole family from slavery.
    How men work spurred on by the double excitement of acquiring social reputation
    and making money rapidly! Not an instant is lost; not a nerve, limb, or muscle
    doing less than the hardest task-master could flog out of a slave. Occasionally
    you see a shearer, after finishing his sheep, walk quickly out and not appear
    for a couple of hours, or perhaps not again during the day. Do not put him
    down as a sluggard; be assured that he has tasked nature dangerously hard,
    and has only given in just before she does. Look at that silent slight youngster,
    with a bandage round his swollen wrist. Every &ldquo;blow&rdquo; of the shears
    is agony to him, yet he disdains to give in, and has been working &ldquo;in
    distress&rdquo; for hours. The pain is great, as you can see by the flush
    which occasionally surges across his brown face, yet he goes on manfully
    to the last sheep, and endures to the very verge of fainting.</p>
  <p>There was now a change in the manner and tone of the shed, especially towards
    the end of the day. It was now the ding of the desperate fray, when the blood
    of the fierce animal man is up, when mortal blows are exchanged, and curses
    float upward with the smoke and dust. The ceaseless clicking of the shears&mdash;the
    stern earnestness of the men, toiling with a feverish and tireless energy&mdash;the
    constant succession of sheep shorn and let go, caught and commenced&mdash;the
    occasional savage oath or passionate gesture, as a sheep kicked and struggled
    with perverse delaying obstinacy&mdash;the cuts and stabs, with brief decided
    tones of Mr. Gordon, in repression or command&mdash;all told the spectator
    that tragic action was introduced into the performance. Indeed, one of the
    minor excitements of shearing was then and there transacted. Mr. Gordon had
    more than once warned a dark sullen-looking man that he did not approve of
    his style of shearing. He was temporarily absent, and on his return found
    the same man about to let go a sheep whose appearance, as a shorn wool-bearing
    quadruped, was painful and discreditable in the extreme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let your sheep go, my man,&rdquo; said Gordon, in a tone which somehow
    arrested the attention of nearly all the shearers, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t
    trouble yourself to catch another!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the delinquent, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know very well why not!&rdquo; replied Gordon, walking closely
    up to him, and looking straight at him with eyes that began to glitter, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
    had fair warning. You&rsquo;ve not chosen to take it. Now you can go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll pay a man for the sheep he&rsquo;s shorn?&rdquo; growled
    out the ruffian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not one shilling until after shearing. You can come then if you like,&rdquo; answered
    Gordon, with perfect distinctness.</p>
  <p>The cowed bully looked savagely at him; but the tall powerful frame and
    steady eye were not inviting for personal arbitration of the matter in hand.
    He put up his two pairs of shears, put on his coat, and walked out of the
    shed. The time was passed when Red Bill or Terrible Dick (ruffians whom a
    sparse labour-market rendered necessary evils) would have flung down his
    shears upon the floor and told the manager that if he didn&rsquo;t like that
    shearing he could shear his&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;sheep himself and be hanged
    to him; or, on refusal of instant payment, would have proposed to bury his
    shears in the intestines of his employer by way of adjusting the balance
    between Capital and Labour. Many wild tales are told of woolshed rows. I
    knew of one squatter stabbed mortally with that fatal and convenient weapon,
    a shear-blade.</p>
  <p>The man thus summarily dealt with could, like most of his companions, shear
    very well if he took pains. Keeping to a moderate number of sheep, his workmanship
    could be good. But he must needs try and keep up with Billy May or Abraham
    Lawson, who can shear from 100 to 130 sheep per day, and do them beautifully.
    So in &ldquo;racing&rdquo; he works hastily and badly, cuts the skin of his
    luckless sheep nearly as often as the wool, and leaves wool here and there
    on them, grievous and exasperating to behold. So sentence of expulsion goes
    forth fully against him. Having arrayed himself for the road he makes one
    more effort for a settlement and some money wherewith to pay for board and
    lodging on the road. Only to have a mad carouse at the nearest township,
    however; after which he will tell a plausible story of his leaving the shed
    on account of Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s temper, and avail himself of the usual free
    hospitality of the bush to reach another shed. He addresses Mr. Gordon with
    an attempt at conciliation and deference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems very &rsquo;ard, sir, as a man can&rsquo;t get the trifle
    of money coming to him, which I&rsquo;ve worked &rsquo;ard for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard you won&rsquo;t try and shear decently,&rdquo; retorts
    Mr. Gordon, by no means conciliated. &ldquo;Leave the shed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ill-conditioned rascal as the shearer is, he has a mate or travelling-companion
    in whose breast exists some rough idea of fidelity. He now takes up the dialogue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose if Jim&rsquo;s shearing don&rsquo;t suit, mine won&rsquo;t
    either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not speak to you,&rdquo; answered Mr. Gordon, as calmly as
    if he had expected the speech, &ldquo;but of course you can go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He said this with an air of studied unconcern, as if he would rather like
    a dozen more men to knock off work. The two men walk out, but the epidemic
    does not spread, and several take the lesson home and mend their ways accordingly.</p>
  <p>The weather now was splendid; not a cloud specked the bright blue sky. The
    shearers continue to work at the same express-train pace; fifty bales of
    wool roll every day from the wool-presses; as fast as they reach that number
    they are loaded upon the numerous drays and wagons which have been waiting
    for weeks. Tall brown men have been recklessly cutting up hides for the last
    fortnight, wherewith to lash the bales securely. It is considered safer practice
    to load wool as soon as may be; fifty bales represent about a thousand pounds
    sterling. In a building, however secure, should a fire break out, a few hundred
    bales are easily burned; but once on the dray, this much-dreaded &ldquo;edax
    rerum&rdquo; in a dry country has little chance. The driver, responsible
    to the extent of his freight, generally sleeps under his dray; hence both
    watchman and insulation are provided.</p>
  <p>The unrelaxing energy with which the work was pushed at this stage was exciting
    and contagious; at or before daylight every soul in the great establishment
    was up. The boundary-riders were always starting off for a twenty or thirty
    mile ride, and bringing tens of thousands of sheep to the wash-pen. At that
    huge lavatory there was splashing and soaking all day with an army of washers;
    not a moment is lost from daylight till dark, or used for any purpose save
    the all-engrossing work and needful food. At nine o&rsquo;clock p.m. luxurious
    dreamless sleep, given only to those whose physical powers have been taxed
    to the utmost and who can bear without injury the daily tension.</p>
  <p>Everything and everybody were in splendid working order, nothing out of
    gear. Rapid and regular as a steam-engine the great host of toilers moved
    onward daily with a march which promised an unusually early completion. Mr.
    Gordon was not in high spirits, for so cautious and far-seeing a captain
    rarely felt himself so independent of circumstances as to indulge in that
    reckless mood&mdash;but much satisfied with the prospect. Whew! The afternoon
    darkens, and the night is delivered over to water-spouts and hurricanes,
    as it appears. Next day was raw, gusty, with chill heavy showers; drains
    had to be cut, roofs to be seen to; shorn sheep were shivering, washers all
    playing pitch-and-toss, shearers sulky; everybody but the young gentlemen
    wearing a most injured expression of countenance. &ldquo;Looks as if it would
    rain for a month,&rdquo; says Long Jack. &ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t been delayed
    might have had the shearing over by this.&rdquo;  Reminded that there are
    50,000 sheep yet remaining to be shorn, and that by no possibility could
    they have been finished, he answers, &ldquo;Suppose so, always the same,
    everything sure to go agin the poor man.&rdquo; The weather did not clear
    up. Winter seemed to have taken thought, and determined to show even this
    land of eternal summer that he had his rights. The shed would be filled,
    and before the sheep so kept dry were shorn, down would come the rain again.
    Not a full day&rsquo;s shearing for ten days. Then the clouds disappeared
    as if the curtain of a stage had been rolled up, and lo! the golden sun,
    fervid and impatient to obliterate the track of winter.</p>
  <p>The first day after the recommencement, matters went much as usual. Steady
    work and little talk, as if everyone was anxious to make up for the lost
    time. But on the second morning after breakfast, when the bell sounded, instead
    of the usual cheerful dash at the sheep, every man stood silent and motionless
    in his place. Someone uttered the words &ldquo;roll up!&rdquo; Then the
    seventy men converged, and slowly, but with one impulse, walked up to the
    end of the shed where stood Mr. Gordon.</p>
  <p>The concerted action of any body of men bears with it an element of power
    which commands respect. The weapon of force is theirs; it is at their option
    to wield it with or without mercy. At one period of Australian colonisation
    a superintendent in Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s position might have had good ground
    for uneasiness. Mr. Jack Bowles saw in it an <i>&eacute;meute</i> of a democratic
    and sanguinary nature, regretted deeply his absent revolver, but drew up
    to his leader prepared to die by his side. That calm centurion felt no such
    serious misgivings. He knew that there had been dire grumbling among the
    shearers in consequence of the weather. He knew that there were malcontents
    among them. He was prepared for some sort of demand on their part, and had
    concluded to make certain concessions of a moderate degree. So looking cheerfully
    at the men, he quietly awaited the deputation. As they neared him there was
    a little hesitation, and then three delegates came to the front. These were
    Old Ben, Abraham Lawson, and Billy May. Ben Thornton had been selected for
    his age and long experience of the rights and laws of the craft. He was a
    weather-beaten, wiry old Englishman, whose face and accent, darkened as the
    former was by the Australian summers of half a century, still retained the
    trace of his native Devonshire. It was his boast that he had shorn for forty
    years, and as regularly &ldquo;knocked-down&rdquo; (or spent in a single
    debauch) his shearing money. Lawson represented the small free-holders, being
    a steady, shrewd fellow, and one of the fastest shearers. Billy May stood
    for the fashion and &ldquo;talent,&rdquo; being the &ldquo;Ringer,&rdquo; or
    fastest shearer of the whole assembly, and as such truly admirable and distinguished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well now, men,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Gordon, cheerily meeting matters
    half-way, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; The younger delegate looked
    at Old Ben, who, now that it &ldquo;was demanded of him to speak the truth,&rdquo; or
    such dilution thereof as might seem most favourable to the interests of the
    shed, found a difficulty like many wiser men about his exordium.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Muster Gordon,&rdquo; at length he broke forth, &ldquo;look&rsquo;ee
    here, sir. The weather&rsquo;s been awful bad, and clean agin shearing. We&rsquo;ve
    not been earning our grub, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So it has,&rdquo; answered the manager, &ldquo;so it has. But can
    I help the weather? I&rsquo;m as anxious as you are to have the shearing
    over quickly. We&rsquo;re both of one mind about that, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right enough, sir,&rdquo; struck in Abraham Lawson,
    who felt that Ben was getting the worst of the argument, and was moreover
    far less fluent than usual, probably from being deprived of the aid of the
    customary expletives, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re come to say this, sir, that
    the season&rsquo;s turned out very wet indeed. We&rsquo;ve had a deal of
    broken time, and the men feel it very hard to be paying for a lot of rations,
    and hardly earning anything. We&rsquo;re shearing the sheep very close and
    clean. You won&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em done no otherways. Not like some sheds
    where a man can &lsquo;run&rsquo; a bit and make up for lost time. Now we&rsquo;ve
    all come to think this, sir, that if we&rsquo;re to go on shearing the sheep
    well, and to stick to them, and get them done before the dust and grass-seed
    come in, that you ought to make us some allowance. We know we&rsquo;ve agreed
    for so much a hundred, and all that. Still as the season&rsquo;s turned so
    out-and-out bad, we hope you&rsquo;ll consider it and make it up to us somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never knew a worse year,&rdquo; corroborated Billy May, who thought
    it indispensable to say something. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t made enough, myself,
    to pay the cook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was not strictly true, at any rate, as to Master Billy&rsquo;s own
    earnings; he being such a remarkably fast shearer (and good withal), that
    he had always a respectable sum credited to him for his days&rsquo; work,
    even when many of the slower men came off short enough.</p>
  <p>However, enough had been said to make Mr. Gordon fully comprehend the case.
    The men were dissatisfied. They had come in a roundabout way to the conclusion
    that some pecuniary concession, not mentioned in their bond, should come
    from the side of capital to that of labour. Whether wages, interest of capital,
    share of profits, reserve fund, they knew not nor cared. This was their stand.
    And being Englishmen they intended to abide by it.</p>
  <p>The manager had considered the situation before it actually arose. He now
    rapidly took in the remaining points of debate. The shearers had signed a
    specific agreement for a stipulated rate of payment, irrespective of the
    weather. By the letter of the law, they had no case. Whether they made little
    or much profit was not his affair. But he was a just and kindly man, as well
    as reasonably politic. They had shorn well, and the weather had been discouraging.
    He knew too that an abrupt denial might cause a passive mutiny, if not a
    strike. If they set themselves to thwart him, it was in their power to shear
    badly, to shear slowly, and to force him to discharge many of them. He might
    have them fined, perhaps imprisoned by the police-court. Meanwhile, how could
    shearing go on? Dust and grass-seeds would soon be upon them. He resolved
    on a compromise, and spoke out at once in a firm and decided tone as the
    men gathered up yet more closely around him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, all of you! You know very well that I&rsquo;m not bound
    to find you in fine weather. Still I am aware that the season has been against
    you. You have shorn pretty well, so far, though I&rsquo;ve had to make examples,
    and am quite ready to make more. What I am willing to do is this: to every
    man who works on till the finish and shears to my satisfaction, I will make
    a fair allowance in the ration account. That is, I will make no charge for
    the beef. Does that suit you?&rdquo; There was a chorus of &ldquo;All right
    sir, we&rsquo;re satisfied. Mr. Gordon always does the fair thing.&rdquo; &amp;c.
    And work was immediately resumed with alacrity.</p>
  <p>The clerk of the weather, too gracious even in these regions as far as the
    absence of rain is concerned, was steadily propitious. Cloudless skies and
    a gradually ascending thermometer alone were the signs that spring was changing
    into summer. The splendid herbage ripened and dried; patches of bare earth
    began to be discernible amid the late thick-swarded pastures, dust to rise
    and cloud-pillars of sand to float and eddy&mdash;the desert genii of the
    Arab. But the work went on at a high rate of speed, outpacing the fast-coming
    summer; and before any serious disasters arose, the last flock was &ldquo;on
    the battens,&rdquo; and, amid ironical congratulations, the &ldquo;cobbler,&rdquo; or
    last sheep was seized, and stripped of his rather dense and difficult fleece.
    In ten minutes the vast woolshed, lately echoing with the ceaseless click
    of the shears, the jests, the songs, the oaths of the rude congregation,
    was silent and deserted. The floors were swept, the pens closed, the sheep
    on their way to a distant paddock. Not a soul remains about the building
    but the pressers, who stay to work at the rapidly lessening piles of fleeces
    in the bins, or a meditative teamster who sits musing on a wool-bale, absorbed
    in a calculation as to when his load will be made up.</p>
  <p>It is sundown, a rather later time of closing than usual, but rendered necessary
    by the possibility of the &ldquo;grand finale.&rdquo; The younger men troop
    over to the hut, larking like schoolboys. Abraham Lawson throws a poncho
    over his broad shoulders, lights his pipe, and strides along, towering above
    the rest, erect and stately as a guardsman. Considerably more so than you
    or I, reader, would have been, had we shorn 130 sheep, as he has done to-day.
    Billy May has shorn 142, and he puts his hand on the five-foot paling fence
    of the yard and vaults over it like a deer, preparatory to a swim in the
    creek. At dinner you will see them all with fresh Crimeans and Jerseys, clean,
    comfortable, and in grand spirits. Next morning is settling-day. The book-keeping
    departments at Anabanco being severely correct, all is in readiness. Each
    man&rsquo;s tally or number of sheep shorn has been entered daily to his
    credit. His private and personal investments at the store have been as duly
    debited. The shearers, as a corporation, have been charged with the multifarious
    items of their rather copious mess-bill. This sum total is divided by the
    number of the shearers, the extract being the amount for which each man is
    liable. This sum varies in its weekly proportion at different sheds. With
    an extravagant cook, or cooks, the weekly bill is often alarming. When the
    men and their functionary study economy it may be kept very reasonably low.</p>
  <p>The men have been sitting or standing about the office for half-an-hour
    when Mr. Jack Bowles rushes out, and shouts &ldquo;William May!&rdquo; That
    young person, excessively clean, attired in a quiet tweed suit, with his
    hair cut very correctly short, advances with an air of calm intrepidity,
    and faces Mr. Gordon. Gordon, now seated at a long table, wearing a judicial
    expression of countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, May, here&rsquo;s your account&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00009-images/image01.jpg" width="850" height="349"> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is the tally of your sheep right?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! I daresay it&rsquo;s
    all right, Mr. Gordon, I made it so and so; about ten less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, well! Ours is correct, no doubt. Now I want to make up a good
    subscription for the hospital this year. How much will you give? You&rsquo;ve
    done pretty well, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put me down a pound, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, that&rsquo;s fair enough. If every one gives what they
    can afford, you men will always have a place to go to when you&rsquo;re hurt
    or laid up. So I put your name down, and you&rsquo;ll see it in the published
    list. Now about the shearing, May. I consider that you&rsquo;ve done your
    work very well, and behaved very well all through. You&rsquo;re a fast shearer,
    but you shear closely, and don&rsquo;t knock your sheep about. I therefore
    do not charge you for any part of your meat bill, and I pay you at the rate
    of half-a-crown a hundred for all your sheep, over and above your agreement.
    Will that do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, indeed, and I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, Mr. Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye May! Always call when you&rsquo;re passing, and if
    any work is going on you&rsquo;ll get your share. Here&rsquo;s your cheque.
    Send in Lawson!&rdquo;  Exit May, in high spirits, having cleared about three
    pounds per week, during the whole term of shearing, and having lived a far
    from unpleasant life, indeed akin to that of a fighting cock, from the commencement
    to the end of that period.</p>
  <p>Lawson&rsquo;s interview may be described as having very similar results.
    He, also, was a first-class shearer, though not so artistic as the gifted
    Billy. Jack Windsor&rsquo;s saucy blue eyes twinkled merrily as he returned
    to his companions, and incontinently leaped on the back of his wild-eyed
    colt. After these three worthies came a shearer named Jackson; he belonged
    to quite a different class; he could shear very well if he pleased, but had
    a rooted disbelief that honesty was the best policy, and a fixed determination
    to shear as many sheep as he could get the manager to pass. By dint of close
    watching, constant reprimand, and occasional &ldquo;raddling&rdquo; (marking
    badly-shorn sheep and refusing to count them) Mr. Gordon had managed to tone
    him down to average respectability of execution. Still he was always uneasily
    aware that whenever his eye was not upon him, Jackson was doing what he ought
    not to do with might and main. Gordon had, indeed, kept him on from sheer
    necessity, but he intended none the less to mark his opinion of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Jackson! Your tally is so-and-so. Is that right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jackson.&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cook and store account, so much; shearing account so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jackson.&mdash;&ldquo;And a good deal too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is your affair,&rdquo; said Mr. Gordon, sternly enough. &ldquo;Now
    look here! You&rsquo;re in my opinion a bad shearer and a bad man. You have
    given me a great deal of trouble, and I should have kicked you out of the
    shed weeks ago if I had not been short of men. I shall make a difference
    between you and men who have tried to do their best. I make you no allowance
    of any sort, I pay you by the strict agreement. There&rsquo;s your cheque.
    Go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jackson goes out with a very black countenance. He mutters with a surly
    oath that if &ldquo;he&rsquo;d known how he was going to be served he&rsquo;d
    ha&rsquo; &lsquo;blocked&rsquo;  &rsquo;em a little more.&rdquo; He is pretty
    well believed to have been served right, and he secures no sympathy whatever.
    Working-men of all classes are shrewd and fair judges generally. If an employer
    does his best to mete out justice he is always appreciated and supported
    by the majority. These few instances will serve as a description of the whole
    process of settling with the shearers. The horses have all been got in. Great
    catching and saddling-up has taken place all the morning. By the afternoon
    the whole party are dispersed to the four winds; some, like Abraham Lawson
    and his friends, to sheds &ldquo;higher up,&rdquo; in a colder climate, where
    shearing necessarily commences later. From these they will pass to others,
    until the last sheep in the mountain runs are shorn. Then those who have
    not farms of their own betake themselves to reaping. Billy May and Jack Windsor
    are quite as ready to back themselves against time in the wheat-field as
    on the shearing-floor. Harvest over, they find their pockets inconveniently
    full, so they commence to visit their friends and repay themselves for their
    toils by a tolerably liberal allowance of rest and recreation.</p>
  <p>Old Ben and a few choice specimens of the olden time get no further than
    the nearest public house. Their cheques are handed to the landlord and a &ldquo;stupendous
    and terrible spree&rdquo; sets in. At the end of a week he informs them that
    they have received liquor to the amount of their cheques&mdash;something
    over a hundred pounds&mdash;save the mark! They meekly acquiesce, as is their
    custom. The landlord generously presents them with a glass of grog each,
    and they take the road for the next woolshed.</p>
  <p>The shearers being despatched, the sheep-washers, a smaller and less regarded
    force, file up. They number some forty men. Nothing more than fair bodily
    strength, willingness and obedience being required in their case, they are
    more easy to get and to replace than shearers. They are a varied and motley
    lot. That powerful and rather handsome man is a New Yorker, of Irish parentage.
    Next to him is a slight, neat, quiet individual. He was a lieutenant in a
    line regiment. The lad in the rear was a Sandhurst cadet. Then came two navvies
    and a New Zealander, five Chinamen, a Frenchman, two Germans, Tin Pot, Jerry,
    and Wallaby&mdash;three aboriginal blacks. There are no invidious distinctions
    as to caste, colour, or nationality. Every one is a man and a brother at
    sheep-washing. Wage, one pound per week; wood, water, tents and food &ldquo;<i>&agrave; la
    discr&eacute;tion</i>.&rdquo; Their accounts are simple: so many weeks, so
    many pounds; store account, so much; hospital? well, five shillings; cheque,
    good-morning.</p>
  <p>The wool-pressers, the fleece-rollers, the fleece-pickers, the yardsmen,
    the washers&rsquo; cooks, the hut cooks, the spare shepherds; all these and
    a few other supernumeraries inevitable at shearing-time, having been paid
    off, the snowstorm of cheques which has been fluttering all day comes to
    an end. Mr. Gordon and the remaining &ldquo;sous-officiers&rdquo; go to rest
    that night with much of the mental strain removed which has been telling
    on every waking moment for the last two months.</p>
  <p>The long train of drays and wagons, with loads varying from twenty to forty-five
    bales, has been moving off in detachments since the commencement. In a day
    or two the last of them will have rolled heavily away. The 1400 bales, averaging
    three and a half hundredweight, are distributed, slow journeying, along the
    road, which they mark from afar, standing huge and columnar like guide tumuli,
    from Anabanco to the waters of the Murray. Between the two points there is
    neither a hill nor a stone. All is the vast monotonous sea of plain&mdash;at
    this season a prairie-meadow exuberant with vegetation; in the late summer,
    or in the occasional and dreaded phenomenon of a <i>dry winter</i>, dusty,
    and herbless as a brickfield, for hundreds of miles.</p>
  <p>Silence falls on the plains and waters of Anabanco for the next six months.
    The woolshed, the wash-pen, and all the huts connected with them are lone
    and voiceless as caravanserais in a city of the plague.</p>
