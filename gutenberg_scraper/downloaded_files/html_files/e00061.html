  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some touch of Youth&rsquo;s rare clowning,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odd fancies and inviting,<br>
    To guide a hand unsure and old<br>

    For hair once bright, in days of yore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows grey (or somewhat slaty),<br>

<p>A very charming gentleman, as old as old could be,<br>
    Stared a while, and glared a while, and then he said to me:<br>
&ldquo;Read your books, and heed your books, and put your books away,<br>
For you will surely need your books upon a later day.&rdquo;<br>
    And then he wheezed and then he sneezed, and gave me such a look.<br>
    And he said, &ldquo;Mark&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;boy! Be careful of your book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A very charming gentleman, indeed, he seemed to be.<br>
    He heaved a sigh and wiped his eye, and then he said to me:<br>
  &ldquo;Take your books and make your books companions&mdash;never toys;<br>
    For they who so forsake their books grow into gawky boys.&rdquo;<br>
    I don&rsquo;t know who he was. Do you? he snuffled at the end;<br>
    And he said, &ldquo;Mark&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;boy! Your book should be your friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;d like to be a baker, and come when morning breaks,<br>
    Calling out, &ldquo;Beeay-ko!&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s the sound he makes)&mdash;<br>
    Riding in a rattle-cart that jogs and jolts and shakes,<br>
    Selling all the sweetest things a baker ever bakes;<br>
    Currant-buns and brandy-snaps, pastry all in flakes;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I wouldn&rsquo;t be a baker

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDawnDance"></a>The Dawn Dance</b></h2>
  <p>What do you think I saw to-day when I arose at dawn?<br>
    Blue Wrens and Yellow-tails dancing on the lawn!<br>
    Bobbing here, and bowing there, gossiping away,<br>
    And how I wished that you were there to see the merry play!</p>
  <p>But you were snug abed, my boy, blankets to your chin,<br>
    Nor dreamed of dancing birds without or sunbeams dancing in.<br>
    Grey Thrush, he piped the tune for them. I peeped out through the glass<br>
    Between the window curtains, and I saw them on the grass&mdash;</p>
  <p>Merry little fairy folk, dancing up and down,<br>
    Blue bonnet, yellow skirt, cloaks of grey and brown,<br>
    Underneath the wattle-tree, silver in the dawn,<br>
    Blue Wrens and Yellow-tails dancing on the lawn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rover, rover, cattle-drover, where go you to-day?&rdquo;<br>
    I go to Cuppacumalonga, fifty miles away;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over plains where Summer rains have sung a song of
  glee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over hills where laughing rills go seeking for the

  <p>&ldquo;Rover, rover, cattle-drover, how do you get there?&rdquo;<br>
    For twenty miles I amble on upon my pony mare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walk awhile and talk awhile to country men I know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then up to ride a mile beside a team that travels slow,<br>
    And last to Cuppacumalonga, riding with a will.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then come along, ah, come along!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah,

  <p>&ldquo;Rover, rover, cattle-drover, what do you do then?&rdquo;<br>
    I camp beneath a kurrajong with three good cattle-men;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then off away at break of day, with strong hands on
  the reins,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To laugh and sing while mustering the cattle on the
  plains&mdash;<br>
    For up to Cuppacumalonga life is jolly still.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then come along, ah, come along!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah,
  come to Cuppacumalonga!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come
  to Cuppacumalonga Hill!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rover, rover, cattle-drover, how may I go too?&rdquo;<br>
    I&rsquo;ll saddle up my creamy colt and he shall carry you&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My creamy colt who will not bolt, who does not shy
  nor kick&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll pack the load and take the road and travel
  very quick.<br>
    And if the day brings work or play we&rsquo;ll meet it with a will.<br>

  <p>Oh, he was old and he was spare;<br>
    His bushy whiskers and his hair<br>
    Were all fussed up and very grey.<br>
    He said he&rsquo;d come a long, long way<br>
    And had a long, long way to go.<br>
    Each boot was broken at the toe,<br>
    And he&rsquo;d a swag upon his back.<br>
    His billy-can, as black as black,<br>
    Was just the thing for making tea<br>
    At picnics, so it seemed to me.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas hard to earn a bite of bread,<br>
    He told me.&nbsp; Then he shook his head,<br>
    And all the little corks that hung<br>
    Around his hat-brim danced and swung<br>
    And bobbed about his face; and when<br>
    I laughed he made them dance again.<br>
    He said they were for keeping flies&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;The pesky varmints&rdquo;&mdash;from his eyes.<br>
    He called me &ldquo;Codger&rdquo;. . . &ldquo;Now you see<br>
    The best days of your life,&rdquo; said he.<br>
  &ldquo;But days will come to bend your back,<br>
    And, when they come, keep off the track.<br>
    Keep off, young codger, if you can.&rdquo;<br>
    He seemed a funny sort of man.</p>
  <p>He told me that he wanted work,<br>
    But jobs were scarce this side of Bourke,<br>
    And he supposed he&rsquo;d have to go<br>
    Another fifty mile or so.<br>
  &ldquo;Nigh all my life the track I&rsquo;ve walked,&rdquo;<br>
    He said.&nbsp; I liked the way he talked.<br>
    And oh, the places he had seen!<br>
    I don&rsquo;t know where he had not been&mdash;<br>
    On every road, in every town,<br>
    All through the country, up and down.<br>
  &ldquo;Young codger, shun the track,&rdquo; he said.<br>
    And put his hand upon my head.<br>
    I noticed, then, that his old eyes<br>
    Were very blue and very wise.<br>
  &ldquo;Ay, once I was a little lad,&rdquo;<br>
    He said, and seemed to grow quite sad.</p>
  <p>I sometimes think: When I&rsquo;m a man,<br>
    I&rsquo;ll get a good black billy-can<br>
    And hang some corks around my hat,<br>
    And lead a jolly life like that.</p>

  <p>Once a little sugar ant made up his mind to roam&mdash;<br>
    To fare away far away, far away from home.<br>
    He had eaten all his breakfast, and he had his Ma&rsquo;s consent<br>
    To see what he should chance to see and here&rsquo;s the way he went&mdash;<br>
    Up and down a fern frond, round and round a stone,<br>
    Down a gloomy gully where he loathed to be alone,<br>
    Up a mighty mountain range, seven inches high,<br>
    Through the fearful forest grass that nearly hid the sky,<br>
    Out along a bracken bridge, bending in the moss,<br>
    Till he reached a dreadful desert that was feet and feet across.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a dry, deserted desert, and a trackless land to tread,<br>
    He wished that he was home again and tucked-up tight in bed.<br>
    His little legs were wobbly, his strength was nearly spent,<br>
    And so he turned around again and here&rsquo;s the way he went&mdash;<br>
    Back away from desert lands, feet and feet across,<br>
    Back along the bracken bridge bending in the moss,<br>
    Through the fearful forest grass, shutting out the sky,<br>
    Up a mighty mountain range seven inches high,<br>
    Down a gloomy gully, where he loathed to be alone,<br>
    Up and down a fern frond and round and round a stone.<br>
    A dreary ant, a weary ant, resolved no more to roam,<br>
    He staggered up the garden path and popped back home.</p>

    And said the rain would spoil the wheat;<br>
    So I rode on to Burrumbeet.</p>
  <p>As I rode in to Beetaloo,<br>
    I met a man whose nose was blue;<br>
    And when I asked him how he got<br>
    A nose like that, he answered, &ldquo;What<br>
    Do bullocks mean when they say &lsquo;Moo&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br>
    So I rode on to Beetaloo.</p>

  <p>As I rode in to Ballarat,<br>
    I met a man who wore no hat;<br>
    And, when I said he might take cold,<br>
    He cried, &ldquo;The hills are quite as old<br>
    As yonder plains, but not so flat.&rdquo;<br>
    So I rode on to Ballarat.</p>

  <p>As I rode in to Gundagai,<br>
    I met a man and passed him by<br>
    Without a nod, without a word.<br>
    He turned, and said he&rsquo;d never heard<br>
    Or seen a man so wise as I.<br>
    But I rode on to Gundagai.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="e00061-images/page026b.jpg" alt="Page 26" width="600" height="334"></p>
  <p>As I rode homeward, full of doubt,<br>
I met a stranger riding out:<br>
A foolish man he seemed to me;<br>
But, &ldquo;Nay, I am yourself,&rdquo; said he,<br>
&ldquo;Just as you were when you rode out.&rdquo;<br>
So I rode homeward, free of doubt.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLittleRedHouse"></a>The Little Red House</b></h2>
  <p>Very few grown-up people understand houses. Only children understand them
    properly, and, if <i>I</i> understand them just a little, it is because I
    knew Sym. Sym and his wife, Emily Ann, lived in the Little Red House. It
    was built on a rather big mountain, and there were no other houses near it.
    At one time, long ago, the mountain had been covered all over with a great
    forest; but men had cut the trees down, all but one big Blue-gum, which grew
    near the Little Red House. The Blue-gum and the Little Red House were great
    friends, and often had long talks together. The Blue-gum was a very old tree&mdash;over
    a hundred years old&mdash;and he was proud of it, and often used to tell
    of the time, long ago, when blackfellows hunted &rsquo;possums in his branches.
    That was before the white men came to the mountain, and before there were
    any houses near it.</p>
  <p>Once upon a time I put a verse about the mountain and the Little Red House
    into a book of rhymes which I wrote for grown ups. I don&rsquo;t think they
    thought much about it. Very likely they said, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just
    a house on a hill,&rdquo; and then forgot it, because they were too busy
    about other things.</p>
  <p>This is the rhyme:</p>
  <p>A great mother mountain, and kindly is she, Who nurses young rivers and
    sends them to sea. And, nestled high up on her sheltering lap, Is a little
    red house, with a little straw cap That bears a blue feather of smoke, curling
    high, And a bunch of red roses cocked over one eye.</p>
  <p>I have tried here to draw the Little Red House for you as well as I can;
    and it isn&rsquo;t my fault if it happens to look just a little like somebody&rsquo;s
    face. I can&rsquo;t help it, can I? if the stones of the door-step look something
    like teeth, or if the climbing roses make the windows look like a funny pair
    of spectacles. And if Emily Ann <i>will </i>hang big fluffy bobs on the window
    blinds for tassels, and if they swing about in the breeze like moving eyes,
    well, <i>I</i> am not to blame, am I? It just happens. The only thing I am
    sorry for is that I couldn&rsquo;t get the big Blue-gum into the picture.
    Of course, I <i>could</i> have drawn it quite easily, but it was too big.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00061-images/page030.jpg" alt="Page 30" width="600" height="575"></p>
  <p>Sym and Emily Ann were fond of the Little Red House, and you may be sure
    the Little Red House was fond of them&mdash;he was their home. The only thing
    that bothered him was that they were sometimes away from home, and then he
    was miserable, like all empty houses.</p>
  <p>Now, Sym was a tinker&mdash;a travelling tinker. He would do a little gardening
    and farming at home for a while, and then go off about the country for a
    few days, mending people&rsquo;s pots and pans and kettles. Usually Sym left
    Emily Ann at home to keep the Little Red House company, but now and then
    Emily Ann went with Sym for a trip, and then the Little Red House was very
    sad indeed.</p>
  <p>One morning, just as the sun was peeping over the edge of the world, the
    big Blue-gum woke up and stretched his limbs and waited for the Little Red
    House to say &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo; The Blue-gum always waited for the
    greeting because he was the older, and he liked to have proper respect shown
    to him by young folk, but the Little Red House didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
  <p>The big Blue-gum waited and waited; but the Little Red House wouldn&rsquo;t
    speak.</p>
  <p>After a while the Blue-gum said rather crossly, &ldquo;You seem to be out
    of sorts this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Little Red House wouldn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You certainly do seem as if you had a pain somewhere,&rdquo; said
    the Blue-gum. &ldquo;And you look funny. You ought to see yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;  snapped the Little Red House, raising his eyebrows
    just as a puff of wind went by. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t always be playing the
    fool, like some people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00061-images/page032.jpg" alt="Page 32" width="600" height="541"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred
    years,&rdquo; replied the big Blue-gum very severely, &ldquo;and never before
    have I been treated with such disrespect. When trees become houses they seem
    to lose their manners.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; cried the Little Red House. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    mean to be rude. I was just listening. There are things going on inside me
    that I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope they aren&rsquo;t ill-treating you,&rdquo; said the Blue-gum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are going to leave me!&rdquo; sighed the Little Red House.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And they are laughing quite happily, as if they were glad about it.
    There&rsquo;s a nice thing for you!&mdash;Going to leave me, and laughing
    about it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But perhaps you are wrong,&rdquo; said the big Blue-gum, who was
    not so hard-hearted as he seemed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always know,&rdquo; moaned the Little Red House. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    be mistaken. Sym was singing his Tinker&rsquo;s song this morning long before
    the sun was up. And then I heard him tell Emily Ann not to forget her umbrella.
    That means that she is going; and the little dog is going, and I shall be
    all alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  answered the Blue-gum rather stiffly, &ldquo;you still
    have <i>me</i> for company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; sighed the Little Red House. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think
    I&rsquo;m ungrateful. But, when they both go away, I shan&rsquo;t be really
    and truly a home again until they come back&mdash;just an empty house; and
    it makes me miserable. How would <i>you</i> like to be an empty house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some day I might be,&rdquo; replied the Blue-gum, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t
    grow too old. There is some fine timber in me yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly there was a great clattering and stamping inside the Little House,
    and Sym began to sing his Tinker&rsquo;s song.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kettles and pans! Kettles and pans! All the broad earth is the tinkering
    man&rsquo;s&mdash; The green leafy lane or the fields are his home, The road
    or the river, where&rsquo;er he way roam. He roves for a living and rests
    where he can. Then bring out your kettle! ho! kettle or pan!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a nice thing for you!&rdquo; said the Little Red House bitterly. &ldquo;What
    kind of a song do you call that? Any old place is good enough for his home,
    and <i>I</i> am just nothing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only his way of putting it,&rdquo; answered the
    Blue-gum kindly. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t really mean it, you know; he wants
    a change, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Little Red House wouldn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks a good deal like rain this morning, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
    the Blue-gum cheerfully, trying to change the subject.</p>
  <p>But the Little Red House wouldn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
  <p>Very soon Sym and Emily Ann, carrying bundles, came out of the Little Red
    House, laughing and talking; and Sym locked the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now for a jolly trip!&rdquo; shouted Sym, as he picked up his firepot
    and soldering-irons.</p>
  <p>But all at once Emily Ann ceased laughing and looked back wistfully at the
    Little Red House.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After all I&rsquo;m sorry to leave our little home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;See
    how sad it looks!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurry on!&rdquo; cried Sym, who was all eagerness for the trip. Then
    he, too, looked back. &ldquo;Why, you forgot to draw down the blinds,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; answered Emily Ann, &ldquo;but
    I think it a shame to blindfold the Little Red House while we are away. I
    just left the blinds up so that he could see things. Good-bye, little home,&rdquo; she
    called. And the Little Red House felt just the least bit comforted to think
    that Emily Ann was sorry to leave him. Then she went off down the winding
    path with Sym; and Sym began to shout his Tinker&rsquo;s Song again.</p>
  <p>The Little Red House watched them go down the mountain.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00061-images/page035.jpg" alt="Page 35" width="600" height="548"></p>
  <p>Away they went: through the gate, past the black stump, round by the bracken
    patch and over the bridge, across the potato paddock, through the sliprails&mdash;getting
    smaller and smaller&mdash;past the sign-post, down by the big rocks&mdash;getting
    smaller and smaller&mdash;under the tree-ferns, out on to the stony flat,
    across the red road, until they were just two tiny specks away down in the
    valley. Then they went through a white gate, round a turn, and the high scrub
    hid them.</p>
  <p>Had you been able to see the Little Red House just at that moment, you would
    have been sure he was going to cry&mdash;he looked so miserable and so lonely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; said the big Blue-gum.</p>
  <p>But the Little Red House couldn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
  <p>Presently the big Blue-gum groaned loudly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oo! Ah! Ah! Golly!&rdquo; groaned the Blue-gum in a strange voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon? said the Little Red House.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I have a nasty sharp pain in my side,&rdquo; said the Blue-gum. &ldquo;I
    do hope and trust it isn&rsquo;t white-ants. It would be simply horrible,
    if it were. Fancy getting white-ants at my time of life! Here I have lived
    on this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred years; and to think
    those nasty, white, flabby little things should get me at last is horrible&mdash;horrible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said the Little Red House. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
    I&rsquo;ve been very selfish, too. I was forgetting that everyone has troubles
    of his own; but I hope it isn&rsquo;t so bad as you fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is bad enough,&rdquo; groaned the Blue-gum. &ldquo;Ow! There it
    is again. I&rsquo;m afraid it<i> is</i> white-ants. I can feel the wretched
    little things nipping.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Little Red House hardly heard him. He was thinking again of his
    own troubles.</p>
  <p>So they stood all through that day, saying very little to each other. Rabbits
    came and played about the Little Red House, and lizards ran over his door-step,
    and once a big wallaby went flopping right past the front gate. But the Little
    Red House paid no attention. He was too busy thinking of his loneliness.</p>
  <p>Birds came and perched in the branches of the big Blue-gum, and chattered
    and sang to him, trying to tell him the news of other trees on distant mountains.
    But the big Blue-gum took no notice. He was too busy thinking about white-ants.</p>
  <p>So the sun sank low behind the Little House, and the shadow of the tall
    Blue-gum began to creep down the mountain and get longer and longer.</p>
  <p>Just as it was growing dark, the big Blue-gum said Suddenly, &ldquo;It certainly
    looks more like rain than ever. The heavy clouds have been gathering all
    day, and we shall get it properly to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the rain did not come that night, nor the next day, nor for two days
    and nights. And all this while the Little Red House and the Big Blue-gum
    remained silent and miserable&mdash;one through loneliness, the other through
    white-ants.</p>
  <p>But on the evening of the third day the big Blue-gum said, &ldquo;The rain
    will come to-night for certain. I know by the feel of the air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let it come!&rdquo; said the Little Red House. &ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t
    care. I couldn&rsquo;t be more miserable than I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just as he said that, one great rain-drop fell right on the middle of his
    roof&mdash;Plop!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming already,&rdquo; cried the Blue-gum, &ldquo;and
    it&rsquo;s going to pour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then three more big drops fell&mdash;Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have never in my life seen such big rain-drops,&rdquo; said the
    Blue-gum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But&mdash;Crash! came rain before he could finish; and in two seconds everything
    was sopping wet. The noise of it was deafening,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a cloud-burst!&rdquo; shouted the Blue-gum. &ldquo;Half
    of my leaves have been stripped off already.&rdquo; Then he peered through
    the rain and the dark to see how the Little Red House was taking it. &ldquo;Why,
    what&rsquo;s the matter with your face?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You look
    awful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crying!&rdquo; sobbed the Little Red House. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    all&mdash;just crying. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see the tears?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00061-images/page038.jpg" alt="Page 38" width="600" height="532"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;  said the Blue-gum. &ldquo;Those are not tears.
    It&rsquo;s just the rain-water running off your window-sills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m crying!&rdquo; wailed the Little Red House. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    crying bitterly. <i>I</i> should know, shouldn&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;m shivering
    and crying because I&rsquo;m cold and lonely and miserable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; agreed the Blue-gum. &ldquo;You are crying.
    But if this rain doesn&rsquo;t stop soon, you&rsquo;ll cry the front path
    away. It certainly is wet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Very late that night the rain eased a little and then stopped altogether.
    The tears ceased to run from the eyes of the Little Red House, and they now
    came only in drops, slower and slower, falling into the great pool by the
    front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard world!&rdquo; sobbed the Little Red House, squeezing
    out another tear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;  cried the Big Blue-gum. &ldquo;Do you hear <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From far away on the distant ranges came a dull, moaning sound. As they
    listened it grew louder, and right in the middle of it came another sound&mdash;Thump!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wind,&rdquo; said the Blue-gum; &ldquo;and a big wind,
    too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let it come!&rdquo; sighed the Little Red House. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
    be more miserable than I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he spoke, the moaning grew louder, and there were three or four quite
    big thumps one after another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that thumping?&rdquo; asked the little House.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those are my poor brothers,&rdquo; answered the big Blue-gum very
    sadly, &ldquo;Those are trees going down before the big wind. The birds were
    bringing me messages from those poor fellows quite lately; and now I shall
    never hear from them again. It&rsquo;s very sad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never thought the wind could blow down big trees,&rdquo; said the
    Little House.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No tree knows when his time will come,&rdquo; the big Blue-gum answered
    gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some very narrow escapes in my time, as tree
    and sapling on this mountain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Little Red House was very quiet and thoughtful for a long time after
    that. Then he asked suddenly, &ldquo;Which way do you think you would fall
    if you did fall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the big Blue-gum said that he couldn&rsquo;t tell. It depended on the
    wind, and he might fall any way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not on me!&rdquo; cried the Little House.</p>
  <p>The Blue-gum said that he didn&rsquo;t know; but he hoped not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you <i>did</i> fall on me,&rdquo; said the Little Red House, &ldquo;I
    suppose it would hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Blue-gum said it certainly would, and there would be very little left
    but splinters and glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t! Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; yelled the Little Red
    House.</p>
  <p>But before they could say another word the great wind struck them with a
    roar. It tossed the roses about so that the eyebrows of the Little House
    seemed to be twitching horribly; and it swayed the big Blue-gum this way
    and that till he appeared to be fighting for his very life. It picked up
    the fallen leaves and twigs, and even small stones, and hurled them down
    the mountain in a cloud.</p>
  <p>In the midst of all the uproar the Little House heard the Blue-gum calling
    to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;ve lived upon this mountain, tree and sapling,&rdquo; he
    shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known such a wind. I&rsquo;m not so young
    as I used to be, and I fear that my end has come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be brave! Oh, be brave!&rdquo; implored the Little Red House. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    let him blow you down. I should be so sorry to lose you, What are you grunting
    for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not grunting,&rdquo; answered the Blue-gym in a pained
    voice. &ldquo;Those are my roots giving way, one by one. I can&rsquo;t stand
    much more of this. Look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00061-images/page041.jpg" alt="Page 41" width="600" height="579"></p>
  <p>The Little Red House looked up, and what he saw terrified him. The big Blue-gum,
    in the clutch of the wind, was bent right over him, so that the top branches
    seemed to be just above his roof; and the great tree appeared to be falling,
    falling, helplessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall on me!&rdquo; shrieked the Little Red House. &ldquo;Oh,
    don&rsquo;t fall on me; because, if you do, you know you&rsquo;ll squash
    me! I don&rsquo;t want to be squashed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the big Blue-gum said, &ldquo;There is just one little root holding
    now. If that gives way we are both done for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be brave! Oh, be brave!&rdquo; shrieked the Little Red House.</p>
  <p>Then slowly, very slowly, the big Blue-gum began to straighten up again,
    away from the Little Red House.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have stood upon this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred
    years,&rdquo; he said when he had recovered; &ldquo;but if it blows like
    that again, it is the end of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it did not blow like that again; though the wind howled and shrieked
    all that day as if it was very angry and disappointed that it could not blow
    down the big Blue-gum.</p>
  <p>Then, towards evening, the wind fell; the heavy clouds went away beyond
    the edge of the sky, and all became very calm and peaceful.</p>
  <p>The birds came from their hiding places and sat in the branches of the Blue-gum
    and chattered away to him, until he began to feel quite cheerful once more,
    in spite of his trouble. And when a certain little Tree-creeper&mdash;a very
    wise bird&mdash;came and had a long, serious talk with the Blue-gum, he became
    very much interested indeed and quite happy.</p>
  <p>But the Little Red House was miserable still; and the beauty of the evening
    didn&rsquo;t cheer him up one bit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said the Blue-gum, when the darkness came to the
    mountain, &ldquo;I am going to have a good sleep tonight. I&rsquo;m a match
    still for old Daddy Wind, in spite of all his noise and bluster. And there
    are ways of dealing with white-ants, too. I&rsquo;ve lived upon this mountain,
    tree and sapling, for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But as he was talking he fell fast asleep.</p>
  <p>The Little Red House did not sleep. How could he, with his eyes wide open?
    So he just stood there all night staring before him, lonely and wretched.
    And when an owl came and sat in the tree and began to call, &ldquo;Mopoke,&rdquo; the
    Little Red House told him rudely to stop his silly noise and clear out. That
    will just show you how very miserable he was.</p>
  <p>It was quite late next morning when the Blue-gum awoke. He stretched his
    big limbs, and began to wonder what he might say to comfort the Little Red
    House. But when the Blue-gum looked down, he saw that the Little Red House
    was smiling all over his face.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00061-images/page043.jpg" alt="Page 43" width="600" height="537"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, now!&rdquo; cried the big Blue-gum cheerfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    the kind of face I like to see in the morning! So you&rsquo;ve decided to
    be sensible and forget your loneliness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Little Red House didn&rsquo;t say a word. He just went on smiling.</p>
  <p>Then the big Blue-gum began to get uneasy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do hope your troubles haven&rsquo;t turned you silly,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t lost your senses, have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;  cried the Little Red House. &ldquo;Why, look down the
    valley! See who&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Down, far down, the valley, just coming through the white gate, were two
    figures that looked like tiny specks. And much nearer was another speck,
    which was certainly a little dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them&mdash;I mean those are they!&rdquo; shouted the Little
    Red House happily. &ldquo;Sym and Emily Ann! And here comes our little dog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly have sharp eyes,&rdquo; replied the Blue-gum. &ldquo;But
    I suppose I&rsquo;m getting old&mdash;over a hundred years, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two figures were through the white gate now, and had crossed the red
    road out on to the stony flat&mdash;getting bigger and bigger as they came;
    and the smile on the Little Red House seemed to grow broader and broader.
    On they came, under the tree-ferns, up by the big rocks, past the sign-post.
    And now the Little Red House could hear Sym singing his Tinker&rsquo;s song.</p>
  <p>But it was not quite the same song this time:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kettles and pans! Ho, kettles and pans! Where&rsquo;s there a home
    like the tinkering man&rsquo;s? Weary of wandering, home is the place&mdash; The
    Little Red House with the smile on his face&mdash; Weary and hungry, my Emily
    Ann. Then put on the kettle! Ho, put on the pan!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now <i>that</i> is the sort of song I <i>do</i> like,&rdquo; said
    the Little Red House, as he watched them coming up the mountain.</p>
  <p>On they came, growing bigger and bigger&mdash;through the sliprails, across
    the potato paddock, over the bridge, round by the bracken-patch, past the
    black stump, through the gate, and here they were, right at the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>am</i> glad to be home again,&rdquo; cried Emily Ann. &ldquo;And
    do look at the Little House. He seems to be smiling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he is smiling,&rdquo; answered Sym; &ldquo;but he has a
    very dirty face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The storm did that,&rdquo; said Emily Ann. &ldquo;Now hurry and get
    the fire alight, and I&rsquo;ll put the kettle on.&rdquo; And they went inside
    laughing and singing, while the little dog flew round the house, barking
    for dear life, and pretending he was very busy seeing everything was in order.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I suppose you&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; said the big Blue-gum to
    the Little Red House.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo;  cried the Little House. &ldquo;Of course I am. Why,
    I&rsquo;m a home again!&rdquo; But suddenly he remembered that his own happiness
    had made him forget all about his old friend&rsquo;s troubles; and he tried
    his best to look serious, as he said: &ldquo;But what about <i>you</i>? Are
    the white-ants still troubling you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  replied the Blue-gum. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that worry
    you. Yesterday I had a talk with the doctor&mdash;Doctor Tree-creeper, you
    know&mdash;a very clever little bird he is, and he knows all about white-ants.
    He examined me thoroughly all over. He says that they have hardly got under
    my skin yet, and he will have them all out in a couple of days. So <i>that&rsquo;s</i> all
    right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i> glad,&rdquo; shouted the Little Red House. &ldquo;Now
    we are <i>all</i> happy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Sym got the fire started, and the smoke curled up, and the Little House
    had his gay blue feather once again. Sym began to sing his Tinker&rsquo;s
    Song louder than ever, and Emily Ann, who was getting the meal ready, joined
    in and sang too. Very soon the kettle also began to sing, and, when the pan
    heard that, <i>he</i> began to sing. Then Doctor Tree-creeper arrived to
    attend to the white-ants, and, as he walked round the trunk of the big Blue-gum,
    tapping it just like a doctor, <i>he</i> began to sing. And two Kookaburras,
    who were sitting on the fence, were so tickled with it all, that they laughed
    and laughed till they made everyone else laugh with them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is quite like old times,&rdquo; laughed the big Blue-gum. &ldquo;Are
    you contented now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I contented?&rdquo; cried the Little Red House. &ldquo;Am I contented?
    Well, what would you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then&mdash;well, most ordinary grown-up folk would tell you that just
    then Emily Ann drew down one of the front blinds. But all the big Blue-gum
    knew, and all you and I know, is that the Little Red House winked.</p>
  <p>And when I saw him last, his smile was as broad as ever, and he was still
    winking.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBoyWhoRodeIntotheSunset"></a>The Boy Who Rode Into the Sunset</b></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once upon a time &mdash; it was not so very long ago, either &mdash; a little
    boy, named Neville, lived with his people in a house which was almost in
    the country. That is to say, it was just at the edge of the city; and at
  the back of the house was a rather large hill, which was quite bald.</p>
  <p>Neville, who was fond of playing by himself, would often wander to the top
    of the bald hill; and if he stood right on top of it and looked one way,
    toward the East, he could see right over the city, with all its tall buildings
    and domes and spires and smoking chimneys. But looking the other way, to
    the West, he could see for miles over the beautiful country, with its green
    fields and orchards and white roads and little farm houses.</p>
  <p>One evening Neville was playing alone on the top of the hill when he noticed
    that one of the very finest sunsets he had ever seen was just coming on.
    The sky in the West, away over the broad country lands, was filled with little
    clouds of all sorts and shapes, and they were just beginning to take on the
    most wonderful colours.</p>
  <p>Neville had often before amused himself with watching clouds and the strange
    shapes into which they changed themselves &mdash; sometimes like great mountain
    ranges, sometimes like sea-waves, and very often like elephants and lions
    and seals and all manner of interesting things of that sort. But never before
    had he been able to make out so many animal shapes in the clouds. The sky
    was almost as good as a Zoo. There were kangaroos and elephants and a hen
    with chickens and wallabies and rabbits and a funny man with large ears and
    all sorts of other peculiar shapes.</p>
  <p>The sun was sinking behind a distant range of hills, where a golden light
    shone out as if through a gateway. It was so much like a great golden gateway
    that Neville fell to wondering what might be found on the other side of it.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, right in the middle of all the coloured clouds, he saw one little
    cloud which was perfectly white, and, as he watched it, he noticed that it
    seemed to be shaped like a small horse. A very small horse it seemed at that
    distance; but, as Neville gazed, it grew bigger and bigger, just as if it
    were coming toward him very fast, and he was almost certain he could see
    its legs moving.</p>
  <p>That startled him a little, and so he rubbed his eyes to make sure that
    they were not playing him tricks.</p>
  <p>When he looked again he was more startled than ever; for the little white
    cloud was no longer a cloud, but a little white horse in real earnest. Besides,
    it had just left the sky and was galloping down the mountain range which
    he could see away in the West. In two minutes it had left the range, and
    was coming across the fields towards him, jumping the fences, dodging under
    the trees, and racing across the plain with its white mane and tail tossing
    as it came. It seemed to be making straight for him.</p>
  <p>He was not really frightened &mdash; you must not think that about him &mdash; but
    he was just beginning to wonder if it were not nearly time to go home to
    dinner, when he noticed that the white horse had stopped, just at the foot
    of the bald hill. It was looking up at him, tossing its head and pawing the
    ground &mdash; the most beautiful white horse that he had ever seen, even
    in a circus. Then it appeared to get over its excitement and began to trot
    quietly up the hill toward him.</p>
  <p>I do not think anyone would have blamed Neville if he had decided then to
    go home to dinner at once. But he was rather a brave boy, and he was certainly
    very curious, so he just stood still and waited.</p>
  <p>And here is where the most wonderful part of the story begins. The white
    horse trotted up to Neville and spoke to him. That would surprise most people;
    and Neville was certainly as much surprised as anyone else would have been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you frightened of?&rdquo; asked the white horse in a loud
    voice.</p>
  <p>Now, Neville&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;just a little frightened by this time;
    but he was not going to show it, so he just said, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s frightened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i>&nbsp;frightened,&rdquo; said the white horse,
    louder than ever. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only a timid little boy. I thought
    when I saw you in the distance that you were one of the plucky ones; but
    I was mistaken. You&rsquo;re just a little cowardly-custard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be careful who you&rsquo;re talking to,&rdquo; said
    Neville, suddenly losing his fear. (Little boys do not always talk good grammar;
    otherwise he would have said &ldquo;whom&rdquo; not  &ldquo;who.&rdquo;)
    He hated to be called a &ldquo;cowardly-custard.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
    better be careful, or I&rsquo;ll give you a bang!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; cried the white horse. &ldquo;Very brave all at once,
    aren&rsquo;t you? All the same, you&rsquo;re afraid to come near and stroke
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to stroke you,&rdquo; said Neville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo;  replied the white horse. &ldquo;I thought
    not, the moment I got close to you. You&rsquo;re one of the frightened ones,
    and I&rsquo;ve been wasting my time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s frightened?&rdquo; said Neville again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You asked that before,&rdquo; replied the white horse, &ldquo;and
    I told you. If you&rsquo;re not frightened, come along and stroke me. There&rsquo;s
    nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Neville walked right up to the white horse and stroked his shoulder.
    And at once he felt that he had been foolish to hold back. For of all the
    smooth, soft, silky coats he had ever stroked, that of the white horse was
    certainly the smoothest, and the softest, and the silkiest. He felt that
    he could go on stroking it for hours.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said the white horse in a voice as soft and silky
    as his coat. &ldquo;There was nothing to be afraid of, was there? And I think
    that perhaps I was mistaken about you. I rather think you might be one of
    those daring boys that one reads about in stories. What about jumping on
    my back for a little ride?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Neville ceased to stroke the white horse and drew back a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll be expecting me home for dinner,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased indeed to have met you.&rdquo; Neville
    was always a polite little boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo;  cried the white horse. &ldquo;Jump on my
    back and I&rsquo;ll take you home. You liked stroking me, didn&rsquo;t you?
    Well that&rsquo;s nothing to the ride you will enjoy &mdash;  simply nothing.
    Why, all the boldest riders in the world would give their ears just for one
    little ride on my back. Now then! One, two, three, and up you go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, before Neville quite knew what he was doing, he made a little run
    and leapt up astride of the white horse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I live just over there,&rdquo; said Neville, pointing towards his
    home.</p>
  <p>But before he could say &ldquo;knife&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;scissors&rdquo; (supposing
    he had wished to say either of these words), the white horse laughed a nasty
    hollow laugh, sprang upwards from the ground, and was soaring through the
    air toward the dying sunset, right away from home and dinner.</p>
  <p>Neville clung on tightly, for he was so high above the earth that to fall
    off would mean the end of him. And far beneath him he saw the green fields
    and the white road, which now seemed like a mere thread.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair! Whoa back! Whoa back!&rdquo; he shouted to
    the white horse; but the white horse made no reply. Indeed, he seemed suddenly
    not so much like a white horse as like a white cloud shaped like a horse,
    and Neville saw that he no longer sat upon the horse&rsquo;s silky coat,
    but upon something soft and downy like a white fleece, and it was slightly
    damp. Then he knew that he was riding upon a cloud; and, as it was quite
    absurd to go on talking to a cloud, he ceased to cry out. He just sat tight
    and wondered what would happen next.</p>
  <p>He was high over a farm-house now: one that he used to see from the bald
    hill. He knew it by the tall pine-trees that grew round it; and down in the
    farm-yard he saw a man with a bucket going out to feed the calves. Neville
    called loudly to him, but the man did not even look up. Now he was far beyond
    that farm-house and above an orchard, where he saw the fruit-trees standing
    in straight rows; and a few seconds later the mountain range was beneath
    him, and Neville knew that the cloud that looked like a horse was making
    straight for the golden gateway, which was now glowing dully in a grey sky.
    He was riding into the sunset.</p>
  <p>Swiftly as the wind that drove it, the Cloud Horse drifted over the mountain
    range. There was a sudden glow of golden light all about him, and then a
    flash of colour so wonderful that Neville could not bear to look. He closed
    his eyes, and, as he did so, he felt that the Cloud Horse had come to a halt
    at last.</p>
  <p>So Neville sat upon the cloud, not daring to open his eyes for quite a long
    time. When at last he did look again he almost fainted with the wonder of
    it. He was inside the sunset.</p>
  <p>But scarcely had he begun to enjoy the wonderful sight, when he was startled
    by the sound of a funny, shrill little voice close by his side. Looking down,
    he saw a strange little man, no taller than a walking-stick, and dressed
    from top to toe in golden-yellow clothes. &ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; said the
    wee yellow man. &ldquo;How did&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;manage to get in here?
    Don&rsquo;t you know this is private?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo;  said Neville, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t
    help it. The Cloud Horse brought me, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the wee yellow man. &ldquo;He tricked you, did he?
    He&rsquo;s much too playful, that Cloud Horse; and, I must say, he&rsquo;s
    put you in a pretty fix.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Neville, &ldquo;but do you mind telling me
    who you are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried the little yellow man. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m the
    Last Sunbeam, of course. I thought you knew that. My job, you know, is to
    shut up the show when the sunset is over. And it&rsquo;s pretty hard work,
    I can tell you, because I&rsquo;ve got to keep on doing it all round the
    earth every few minutes or so. And it gets very tiresome at times. Would
    you believe it? I&rsquo;ve never seen a dawn or a bright mid-day in all my
    life  &mdash; just sunsets all the time. Sunsets for breakfast, sunsets for
    dinner, sunsets for supper. And if I make the tiniest little slip, the head
    scene-shifter is down on me like a ton of bricks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodness me!&rdquo;  said Neville. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you
    had scene-shifters here.&rdquo; Neville had been to see pantomimes, and therefore
    knew what a scene-shifter was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then how do you think we shift the scenes?&rdquo; cried the wee yellow
    man rather crossly. Then he suddenly became very busy about nothing, as he
    whispered, &ldquo;Look out! Here&rsquo;s the head scene-shifter coming now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Looking back, Neville saw, coming towards them, a man with very large ears.
    He was not a nice-looking man, and he was extremely like the cloud man that
    Neville had sometimes seen in the sky when he went to look at the sunset
    from the bald hill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then! Now then!&rdquo; roared the man with the large ears. &ldquo;Move
    yourself there, Goldie! We shut up the show here in a few minutes, and open
    at once on the next range. See that you have that curtain down on time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo;  replied the little yellow man very humbly.</p>
  <p>Then the man with the large ears noticed Neville for the first time. He
    frowned darkly, and his big ears seemed to flap with annoyance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is this on our Cloud Horse?&rdquo; he roared in his great angry
    voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just a little boy,&rdquo; said the yellow man &mdash; for Neville
    was far too frightened to speak. &ldquo;Just a little boy that the Cloud
    Horse has been playing tricks on. I think he&rsquo;d like to be getting home &mdash; just
    over by the bald hill, if you don&rsquo;t mind, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;  shouted the man with the large ears. &ldquo;The
    Cloud Horse is not to go out there again to-night, nor the silly little boy
    either. I&rsquo;m not going to have the sunset upset by any such silly nonsense.
    You mind what I say and attend to your work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, without another glance at Neville, the man with the large ears strode
    off to arrange for the sunset on the next range, miles and miles away.</p>
  <p>Neville gazed at the wee yellow man hopelessly, and the wee yellow man gazed
    at Neville, and neither spoke a word until the man with the large ears was
    well out of the way. Then the Last Sunbeam grew quite cheerful again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;you heard what the head scene-shifter
    said. You certainly can&rsquo;t go home by the way you came. The only thing
    for you to do is to go round. You&rsquo;ll just about have time to do it,
    if you hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go round?&rdquo;  repeated Neville in a puzzled voice. &ldquo;Go
    round what, round where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Round the world, of course,&rdquo; replied the little yellow man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Round the world?&rdquo;  cried Neville. &ldquo;Why you must be making
    fun of me, and I think that is very unkind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo;  laughed the little yellow man. &ldquo;You
    need not make such as fuss about it. Why, I go round the world once every
    day with the sunset. You have only to go a bit faster so as to do it in a
    few minutes, and with the Cloud Horse to help you that&rsquo;s easily managed.
    Don&rsquo;t you worry about the Cloud Horse. He has got to do just whatever
    I tell him. Now, excuse me for one moment and I&rsquo;ll give you full directions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With that the wee yellow man went behind a pink cloud and came back with
    a beautiful blue flower in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, handing the flower to Neville, &ldquo;is a
    Sky Flower. It is made entirely out of a genuine piece of sky, and it is
    a talisman &mdash; that&rsquo;s a longer word for charm, you know &mdash; which
    takes you free round the world. The one thing you have to remember is that
    you mustn&rsquo;t, on any account, lose that flower until you get home again.
    Now, just exactly what you have to do is to travel West and race round the
    world until you catch up with this evening again. It is quite simple.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simple!&rdquo; cried Neville. &ldquo;Why I don&rsquo;t understand
    it at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the wee yellow man rather impatiently, &ldquo;you
    are very dense. Now listen carefully. The world, you know, turns round from
    West to East, and that makes it seem as if the sun is going round the world
    from East to West. Very well. So what you have to do is to ride West upon
    the Cloud horse much faster than the sun appears to travel, and catch him
    up again before he gets well away from here. The Cloud horse is in good condition,
    and you should easily do it in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A few minutes!&rdquo;  gasped Neville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep quiet and listen,&rdquo; snapped the wee yellow man. &ldquo;A
    few miles West from here you will come into broad daylight. That will be
    afternoon. After that you will meet mid-day, and, passing that, you will
    reach the place where it is only dawn. That&rsquo;s about half-way round
    the earth. Show the Sky Flower to the porter of the Dawn, and he will let
    you through. Then you get to the half of the world where it is night, and
    you must race round that till you reach the place where it is only evening.
    That will be&nbsp;<i>this</i>&nbsp;evening, somewhere about here, for you
    will have taken only a few minutes altogether. And when you see your own
    home or the bald hill again, grasp the Sky Flower tightly in your hand, jump
    off the Cloud horse, and you will float gracefully down to the earth. It
    won&rsquo;t hurt you. Then you can go home, and I hope you will not be late
    for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; began Neville, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My time is valuable,&rdquo; said the wee yellow man, as he shook
    hands. &ldquo;Good-bye, and a pleasant journey.&rdquo; With that he smacked
    the Cloud Horse smartly on the flank, and in a moment it was racing into
    the West at a most terrific pace.</p>
  <p>Of course, now that aeroplanes have been invented, flying is not thought
    so wonderful as once it was. But loafing along through the air in a biplane
    or a monoplane at eighty or a hundred miles an hour is a very tame business
    when you compare it with racing the day round the world on a Cloud Horse.
    And Neville is very probably the only person who has ever done that yet.</p>
  <p>Almost before he knew what had happened, he had left evening far behind
    and was riding in broad daylight. The Cloud Horse had ridden high in the
    air, and Neville saw the broad country, with plains and hills and forest
    lands, stretched far beneath him. An instant later, and the land was no longer
    below him, but the wide sea, sparkling in brilliant sunlight.</p>
  <p>Before he had time to notice very much he had reached mid-day, high over
    a strange foreign land, and was racing through the morning toward the dawn.
    So quickly did he go that there was little chance of seeing anything clearly;
    but he had glimpses of many strange sights. Many ships he saw upon the sea &mdash; small
    ships and stately steamers crawling over the ocean like strange water-beetles.
    Once, as the Cloud Horse drifted low, Neville saw a beautiful sailing-ship,
    with all sails set, and strange-looking men upon the deck. They looked very
    like pirates, and perhaps they were; but Neville had no time to make sure,
    for the very next minute he was over a wild land where he saw a horde of
    black men, with spears and clubs, hunting an elephant through a clearing
    in a great jungle. As he looked, the elephant turned to charge the hunters;
    but what happened then Neville did not see, for in a moment more he was above
    a great city with crowds of people in the streets &mdash; people dressed
    in strange, bright-coloured clothes &mdash;  and there were bells ringing
    and whistles blowing. Then a great desert spread beneath him, with no living
    thing in sight but a great tawny lion prowling over the sand. Then came the
    sea again, and more ships; and the light began to grow dim, for he was nearly
    half-way round the earth, and was approaching the dawn.</p>
  <p>Dimmer grew the light, and dimmer yet, just as though evening were coming &mdash; and
    before him, Neville saw the dawn like a silvery gateway in the sky. Straight
    toward it the Cloud Horse rushed, and stopped so suddenly that Neville almost
    fell off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this? What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; cried a small
    voice; and Neville saw beside the silver gateway, a little man dressed from
    top to toe in silver grey. It was the Porter of the Dawn, sometimes called
    the First Sunbeam.</p>
  <p>Before Neville could answer, the little grey man had caught sight of the
    Sky Flower.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, you have the talisman,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Pass in! and don&rsquo;t
    stop to gossip, because I&rsquo;m very busy this morning. A pleasant journey,&rdquo; he
    added as he smacked the Cloud Horse on the shoulder; and in an instant Neville
    had passed through the dawn and plunged into the night.</p>
  <p>It was a dark night, with no moon, for the sky was overcast with dense clouds.
    Above these the Cloud Horse flew, and overhead Neville saw the rushing stars,
    and below only the blackness of heavy clouds. But more often the Cloud Horse
    flew low, and then there was little to be seen. By the lights of moving ships
    Neville knew that sometimes he was above the sea. Sometimes twinkling lights
    in towns or solitary farms, or the sudden blaze of a great city told him
    that the land was beneath him. Once, through the blackness, he saw a great
    forest fire upon an island, and the light of it lit up the sea, and showed
    the natives crowded upon the beach and in the shallows, and some making off
    in canoes.</p>
  <p>Then darkness swallowed the Cloud Horse again, and the blazing island was
    left far behind.</p>
  <p>After that, Neville began to feel a little drowsy. Perhaps he did sleep
    a little, for the next thing he saw was a faint light in the sky before him,
    as though the dawn were coming. But he knew it must be the evening, because
    he was coming back to the place from which he had started, and was catching
    up with the sun. You see, he had only been gone a few minutes.</p>
  <p>The Cloud Horse flew very low now; and rapidly the darkness grew less. Then,
    long before he expected it, Neville saw the roof of his own home below him.
    He could see the garden in the twilight and his own dog sniffing about among
    the trees as though in search of him.</p>
  <p>Neville began to think about jumping now, and he was rather nervous. He
    might land softly and he might not. He only had the wee yellow man&rsquo;s
    word for that.</p>
  <p>Then, to his horror, he saw that they had passed his home and were over
    the bald hill. There was no time to lose. The Cloud Horse was taking him
    into the sunset again, and, if he did, what would the head scene-shifter
    say then?</p>
  <p>So, grasping the Sky Flower very tightly, Neville closed his eyes and jumped.
    He half expected to fall quickly and be dashed to pieces upon the earth;
    but, instead, he floated in the air like a feather, swaying and drifting,
    and slowly sinking all the time towards the ground. It was a very pleasant
    sensation indeed.</p>
  <p>The bald hill was beneath him as he came slowly down, down, down.</p>
  <p>He could see the Cloud Horse &mdash; now little more than a small white
    speck &mdash; rushing on to catch the sunset. And still he sank down ever
    so slowly towards the top of the bald hill.</p>
  <p>His little dog had caught sight of him now, and came rushing out the gate
    and up the bald hill, barking loudly. And he kept on sinking nearer to the
    earth, down, down, nearer and nearer &mdash; and then, quite suddenly, he
    seemed to forget everything.</p>
  <p>The next thing Neville remembered was feeling something wet and warm upon
    his cheek. He opened his eyes and saw that the little dog was licking his
    face. Sitting up, he looked about him. He was in the grass on the top of
    the bald hill; night was very near, and the first star was just beginning
    to twinkle.</p>
  <p>Then, quite suddenly, Neville remembered the Cloud Horse and the little
    yellow man and the little silver man and the head scene-shifter and the wonderful
    journey and all the rest of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what a remarkable dream,&rdquo; said Neville, stretching his
    arms. And, as he did so, the Sky Flower fell from his hand.</p>
  <p>So it was not a dream after all; for, if it was, how could he explain that
    Sky Flower? He picked it up and carried it very tenderly, as he set off home
    to dinner, his little dog trotting at his heels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a beautiful flower!&rdquo; said Neville&rsquo;s mother when
    he got home. &ldquo;Where ever did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a piece of the genuine sky,&rdquo; said Neville proudly, as
    he gave it to her.</p>
  <p>His mother smiled at him as she said, &ldquo;That is a very nice thing to
    say, and it certainly does look like a little piece of the sky. But, of course,
    it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a real piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Neville knew that if he were to tell the story of his wonderful ride,
    and tried to explain that he had been right around the world since he went
    out to play, his parents would find it very, very hard to believe. So he
    said nothing, but ate a very good dinner.</p>
  <p>But Neville&rsquo;s mother put the flower in a vase upon the mantel; and
    to this day it is still there, as fresh and bright as ever. It will not fade.
    Neville&rsquo;s mother thinks that is a very strange and wonderful thing.
    And so it is.</p>
  <p>Since that day, when Neville goes to the top of the bald hill to watch a
    sunset, he is almost sure that, just as the golden light is fading, he can
    see a little yellow man by the gateway; and it seems to him that the little
    yellow man waves a cheery greeting. But, whether this is so or not, Neville
    always waves back; and he feels very happy to think that he has a good friend
    inside the sunset.</p>

  <p>High on the hills, where the tall trees grow,<br>
    There lives an axeman that I know.<br>
    From his little hut by a ferny creek,<br>
    Day after day, week after week,<br>
    He goes each morn with his shining axe,<br>
    Trudging along by the forest tracks;<br>
    And he chops and he chops till the daylight goes&mdash;<br>
    High on the hills, where the blue-gum grows.</p>
  <p>(Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)<br>
    There&rsquo;s a log to move and a branch to lop.<br>
    Now to the felling!&nbsp; His sharp axe bites<br>
    Into a tree on the forest heights,<br>
    And scarce for a breath does the axeman stop&mdash;<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)<br>
    Bell-birds watch him; and in the fern<br>
    Wallabies listen awhile, and turn<br>
    Back through the bracken, and off they hop.<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)<br>
    Patient and tireless, blow on blow<br>
    The axeman swings as the minutes go;<br>
    While the echoes ring from the mountain-top.<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)</p>
  <p>Round about him the rabbits play,<br>
    Skipping and scampering all the day,<br>
    And the sweet young grass by the logs they crop.<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)<br>
    Crimson parrots above him climb,<br>
    Chattering, chattering all the time,<br>
    As down from the branches the twigs they drop.<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)<br>
    Steadily, surely, on he goes,<br>
    Shaking the tree with his mighty blows:<br>
    There&rsquo;s never a pause and there&rsquo;s never a stop.<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)</p>
  <p>Out from the bush beyond is heard<br>
    The swaggering song of the butcher-bird<br>
    Seeking a joint for his butcher&rsquo;s shop.<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)<br>
    Deeper and deeper the cut creeps in,<br>
    While the parrots shriek with a deafening din,<br>
    And the chips fly out with a flip and a flop.<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)<br>
    Yellow robins come flocking round,<br>
    Watching the chips as they fall to ground,<br>
    Darting to catch the grubs that drop.<br>
    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)<br>
    The blows come quicker. The axe-blade hums,<br>
  <i>Stand well back, there, before she comes!<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the way the drovers go. But how do they
  come back?<br>
    Back across the saltbush from Never Never land.<br>
    Back across the spinifex, back across the sand.</p>

  <p>When I go back from Billy&rsquo;s place I always have to roam<br>
    The mazy road, the crazy road that leads the long way home.<br>
    Ma always says, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come through Mr. Donkin&rsquo;s
    land?<br>
    The footbridge track will bring you back.&rdquo; Ma doesn&rsquo;t understand.<br>
    I cannot go that way, you know, because of Donkin&rsquo;s dog;<br>
    So I set forth and travel north, and cross the fallen log.</p>
  <p>Last week, when I was coming by, that log had lizards in it;<br>
    And you can&rsquo;t say I stop to play if I just search a minute.<br>
    I look around upon the ground and, if there are no lizards,<br>
    I go right on and reach the turn in front of Mrs. Blizzard&rsquo;s.<br>
    I do not seek to cross the creek, because it&rsquo;s deep and floody,<br>
    And Ma would be annoyed with me if I came home all muddy.</p>
  <p>Perhaps I throw a stone or so at Mrs. Blizzard&rsquo;s tank,<br>
    Because it&rsquo;s great when I aim straight to hear the stone go &ldquo;Plank!&rdquo;<br>
    Then west I wend from Blizzard&rsquo;s Bend, and not a moment wait,<br>
    Except, perhaps, at Mr. Knapp&rsquo;s, to swing upon his gate.<br>
    So up the hill I go, until I reach the little paddock<br>
    That Mr. Jones at present owns and rents to Mr. Craddock.</p>
  <p>For boys my size the sudden rise is quite a heavy pull,<br>
    And yet I fear a short-cut here because of Craddock&rsquo;s bull;<br>
    So I just tease the bull till he&rsquo;s as mad as he can get,<br>
    And then I face the corner place that&rsquo;s been so long to let.<br>
    It&rsquo;s very well for Ma to tell about my dawdling habits.<br>
    What would you do, suppose you knew the place was thick with rabbits?</p>
  <p>I do not stay for half a day, as Ma declares I do.<br>
    No, not for more than half-an-hour&mdash;perhaps an hour&mdash;or two.<br>
    Then down the drop I run, slip-slop, where all the road is slithy.<br>
    And have to go quite close, you know, to Mr. Horner&rsquo;s smithy.<br>
    A moment I might tarry by the fence to watch them hammer,<br>
    And, I must say, learn more that way than doing sums and grammar.</p>
  <p>And, if I do sometimes climb through, I do not mean to linger.<br>
    Though I did stay awhile the day Bill Homer burst his finger.<br>
    I just stand there to see the pair bang some hot iron thing<br>
    And watch Bill Horner swing the sledge and hit the anvil&mdash;Bing!<br>
    (For Mr. Horner and his son are great big brawny fellows:<br>
    Both splendid chaps!) And then, perhaps, they let me blow the bellows.</p>
  <p>A while I stop beside the shop, and talk to Mr. Horner;<br>
    Then off I run, and race like fun around by Duggan&rsquo;s Corner.<br>
    It&rsquo;s getting late, and I don&rsquo;t wait beside the creek a minute,<br>
    Except to stop, maybe, and drop a few old pebbles in it.<br>
    A few yards more, and here&rsquo;s the store that&rsquo;s kept by Mr. Whittle&mdash;<br>
    And you can&rsquo;t say I waste the day if I just wait. . . a little.</p>
  <p>One day, you know, a year ago, a man gave me a penny,<br>
    And Mr. Whittle sold me sweets (but not so very many).<br>
    You never know your luck, and so I look to see what&rsquo;s new<br>
    In Mr. Whittle&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a peppermint or two,<br>
    Some buttons and tobacco (Mr. Whittle calls it &ldquo;baccy&rdquo;),<br>
    And fish in tins, and tape, and pins. . . . And then a voice calls, &ldquo;Jacky!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, Ma.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been so far-around by Duggan&rsquo;s
    Corner.<br>
    I had to stay awhile to say &lsquo;Good day&rsquo; to Mr. Horner.<br>
    I feel so fagged; I&rsquo;ve tramped and dragged through mud and over logs,
    Ma&mdash;<br>
    I could not go short-cuts, you know, because of bulls and dogs, Ma.<br>
    The creek, Ma? Why, it&rsquo;s <i>very</i> high! You don&rsquo;t call <i>that</i> a
    gutter?<br>
    Bill Horner chews tobacco, Ma. . . . I&rsquo;d like some bread and butter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Old  farmer Jack gazed on his wheat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feared the frost would nip it.<br>
    Said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nearly seven feet&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must begin to strip it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stripped it with a stripper and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bagged it with a bagger;<br>
    The bags were all so lumpy that<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made the lumper stagger.</p>
  <p>The  lumper staggered up the stack<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he was told to stack it;<br>
    And Jack was paid and put the cash<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside his linen jacket.</p>

  <p>Old  Black Jacko<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his little pipe of clay.<br>
    Puff, puff, puff,<br>
    He never has enough<br>

  <p>I  detest the Carrion Crow!<br>
    (He&rsquo;s a raven, don&rsquo;t you know?)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s a greedy glutton, also, and a ghoul,<br>
    And his sanctimonious caw<br>
    Rubs my temper on the raw.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s a demon, and a most degraded fowl.</p>
  <p>I  admire the pert Blue-wren<br>
    And his dainty little hen&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she hasn&rsquo;t got a trace of blue upon her;<br>
    But she&rsquo;s pleasing, and she&rsquo;s pretty,<br>
    And she sings a cheerful ditty;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While her husband is a gentleman of honour.</p>
  <p>I  despise the Pallid Cuckoo,<br>
    A disreputable &ldquo;crook&rdquo; who<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirks her duties for a lazy life of ease.<br>
    I abhor her mournful call,<br>
    Which is not a song at all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a cross between a whimper and a wheeze.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A furlong from the track.</p>
  <p>I  had a lot to talk about,<br>

    On bees that buzz in bonnets and the kind that build the combs,<br>

  <p>This  very charming gentleman, extremely old and gruff,<br>

    Then he spluttered and he muttered and he loudly shouted &ldquo;Fie!<br>
    To tear your books is wicked sir! and likewise all my eye!&rdquo;<br>
    I don&rsquo;t know what he meant by that. He had such piercing eyes.<br>
    And, he said, &ldquo;Mark&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;boy! Books  will make you wise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This very charming gentleman said, &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hoity,  Toit!<br>
A book is not a building block, a cushion or a quoit.<br>
Soil your books and spoil your books? Is that the thing to do?<br>
Gammon, sir! and Spinach, sir! And Fiddle-faddle, too!&rdquo;<br>
He blinked so quick, and thumped his stick, then gave me such a stare.<br>
And he said, &ldquo;Mark&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;boy! <i>Books&mdash;need&mdash;CARE!</i>&rdquo;
