  <p><i>Not for the love of women toil we, we of the craft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for the people&rsquo;s praise;<br>
    Only because our goddess made us her own and laughed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claiming us all our days,</i></p>
  <p><i>Claiming our best endeavour&mdash;body and heart and brain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given with no reserve&mdash;<br>
    Niggard is she towards us, granting us little gain;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, we are proud to serve.</i></p>
  <p><i>Not unto us is given choice of the tasks we try,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering grain or chaff;<br>
    One of her favoured servants toils at an epic high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, that a child may laugh.</i></p>
  <p><i>Yet if we serve her truly in our appointed place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freely she doth accord<br>
    Unto her faithful servants always this saving grace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work is its own reward!</i> </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SongoftheWheat"></a>Song of the Wheat</b></h2>
  <p>We have sung the song of the droving days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the march of the travelling sheep;<br>
    By silent stages and lonely ways<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin, white battalions creep.<br>
    But the man who now by the land would thrive<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must his spurs to a plough-share beat.<br>
    Is there ever a man in the world alive<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sing the song of the Wheat!</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s west by south of the Great Divide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grim grey plains run out,<br>
    Where the old flock-masters lived and died<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a ceaseless fight with drought.<br>
    Weary with waiting and hope deferred<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were ready to own defeat,<br>
    Till at last they heard the master-word&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the master-word was Wheat.</p>
  <p>Yarran and Myall and Box and Pine&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas axe and fire for all;<br>
    They scarce could tarry to blaze the line<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wait for the trees to fall,<br>
    Ere the team was yoked, and the gates flung wide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dust of the horses&rsquo; feet<br>
    Rose up like a pillar of smoke to guide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful march of Wheat.</p>
  <p>Furrow by furrow, and fold by fold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soil is turned on the plain;<br>
    Better than silver and better than gold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the surface-mine of the grain;<br>
    Better than cattle and better than sheep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fight with drought and heat;<br>
    For a streak of stubbornness, wide and deep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies hid in a grain of Wheat.</p>
  <p>When the stock is swept by the hand of fate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep down in his bed of clay<br>
    The brave brown Wheat will lie and wait<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the resurrection day:<br>
    Lie hid while the whole world thinks him dead;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Spring-rain, soft and sweet,<br>
    Will over the steaming paddocks spread<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first green flush of the Wheat.</p>
  <p>Green and amber and gold it grows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun sinks late in the West;<br>
    And the breeze sweeps over the rippling rows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the quail and the skylark nest.<br>
    Mountain or river or shining star,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s never a sight can beat&mdash;<br>
    Away to the sky-line stretching far&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sea of the ripening Wheat.</p>
  <p>When the burning harvest sun sinks low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shadows stretch on the plain,<br>
    The roaring strippers come and go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like ships on a sea of grain;<br>
    Till the lurching, groaning waggons bear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tale of the load complete.<br>
    Of the world&rsquo;s great work he has done his share<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has gathered a crop of wheat.</p>
  <p>Princes and Potentates and Czars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They travel in regal state,<br>
    But old King Wheat has a thousand cars<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his trip to the water-gate;<br>
    And his thousand steamships breast the tide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plough thro&rsquo; the wind and sleet<br>
    To the lands where the teeming millions bide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That say: &ldquo;Thank God for Wheat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BrumbysRun"></a>Brumby&rsquo;s Run</b></h2>
<p class="note">Brumby is the Aboriginal word for a wild horse. At a recent trial a  N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge, hearing of Brumby horses, asked: &ldquo;Who is Brumby,  and where is his Run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It lies beyond the Western Pines<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the sinking sun,<br>
  And not a survey mark defines<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bounds of &ldquo;Brumby&rsquo;s Run&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On odds and ends of mountain land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tracks of range and rock<br>
  Where no one else can make a stand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Brumby rears his stock.</p>
<p>A wild, unhandled lot they are<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every shape and breed.<br>
  They venture out &rsquo;neath moon and star<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the flats to feed;</p>
<p>But when the dawn makes pink the sky<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And steals along the plain,<br>
  The Brumby horses turn and fly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the hills again.</p>
<p>The traveller by the mountain-track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May hear their hoof-beats pass,<br>
  And catch a glimpse of brown and black<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim shadows on the grass.</p>
<p>The eager stockhorse pricks his ears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lifts his head on high<br>
  In wild excitement when he hears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brumby mob go by.</p>
<p>Old Brumby asks no price or fee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er all his wide domains:<br>
  The man who yards his stock is free<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep them for his pains.</p>
<p>So, off to scour the mountain-side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eager eyes aglow,<br>
  To strongholds where the wild mobs hide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gully-rakers go.</p>
<p>A rush of horses through the trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red shirt making play;<br>
  A sound of stockwhips on the breeze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They vanish far away!</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Ah, me! before our day is done<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We long with bitter pain<br>
  To ride once more on Brumby&rsquo;s Run<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yard his mob again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SaltbushBillonthePatriarchs"></a>Saltbush Bill on the Patriarchs</b></h2>
<p>Come all you little rouseabouts and climb upon my knee;<br>
  To-day, you see, is Christmas Day, and so it&rsquo;s up to me<br>
  To give you some instruction like&mdash;a kind of Christmas tale&mdash;<br>
  So name your yarn, and off she goes. What, &ldquo;Jonah and the Whale&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Well, whales is sheep I&rsquo;ve never shore; I&rsquo;ve never been to sea,<br>
  So all them great Leviathans is mysteries to me;<br>
  But there&rsquo;s a tale the Bible tells I fully understand,<br>
  About the time the Patriarchs were settling on the land.</p>
<p>Those Patriarchs of olden time, when all is said and done,<br>
  They lived the same as far-out men on many a Queensland run&mdash;<br>
  A lot of roving, droving men who drifted to and fro,<br>
  The same we did out Queensland way a score of years ago.</p>
<p>Now Isaac was a squatter man, and Jacob was his son,<br>
  And when the boy grew up, you see, he wearied of the run.<br>
  You know the way that boys grow up&mdash;there&rsquo;s some that stick at home;<br>
  But any boy that&rsquo;s worth his salt will roll his swag and roam.</p>
<p>So Jacob caught the roving fit and took the drovers&rsquo; track<br>
  To where his uncle had a run, beyond the outer back;<br>
  You see they made for out-back runs for room to stretch and grow,<br>
  The same we did out Queensland way, a score of years ago.</p>
<p>Now, Jacob knew the ways of stock&mdash;that&rsquo;s most uncommon clear&mdash;<br>
  For when he got to Laban&rsquo;s Run, they made him overseer;<br>
  He didn&rsquo;t ask a pound a week, but bargained for his pay<br>
  To take the roan and strawberry calves&mdash;the same we&rsquo;d take to-day.</p>
<p>The duns and blacks and &ldquo;Goulburn roans&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s brindles), coarse  and hard,<br>
  He branded them with Laban&rsquo;s brand, in Old Man Laban&rsquo;s yard;<br>
  So, when he&rsquo;d done the station work for close on seven year,<br>
  Why, all the choicest stock belonged to Laban&rsquo;s overseer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often so with overseers&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen the same thing done<br>
  By many a Queensland overseer on many a Queensland run.<br>
  But when the mustering time came on old Laban acted straight,<br>
  And gave him country of his own outside the boundary gate.</p>
<p>He gave him stock, and offered him his daughter&rsquo;s hand in troth;<br>
  And Jacob first he married one, and then he married both;<br>
  You see, they weren&rsquo;t particular about a wife or so&mdash;<br>
  No more were we up Queensland way a score of years ago.</p>
<p>But when the stock were strong and fat with grass and lots of  rain,<br>
  Then Jacob felt the call to take the homeward road again.<br>
  It&rsquo;s strange in every creed and clime, no matter where you roam,<br>
  There comes a day when every man would like to make for home.</p>
<p>So off he set with sheep and goats, a mighty moving band,<br>
  To battle down the homeward track along the Overland&mdash;<br>
  It&rsquo;s droving mixed-up mobs like that that makes men cut their throats.<br>
  I&rsquo;ve travelled rams, which Lord forget, but never travelled goats.</p>
<p>But Jacob knew the ways of stock, for (so the story goes)<br>
  When battling through the Philistines&mdash;selectors, I suppose&mdash;<br>
  He thought he&rsquo;d have to fight his way, an awkward sort of job;<br>
  So what did Old Man Jacob do? of course, he split the mob.</p>
<p>He sent the strong stock on ahead to battle out the way;<br>
  He couldn&rsquo;t hurry lambing ewes&mdash;no more you could to-day&mdash;<br>
  And down the road, from run to run, his hand &rsquo;gainst every hand,<br>
  He moved that mighty mob of stock across the Overland.</p>
<p>The thing is made so clear and plain, so solid in and out,<br>
  There isn&rsquo;t any room at all for any kind of doubt.<br>
  It&rsquo;s just a plain straightforward tale&mdash;a tale that lets you know<br>
  The way they lived in Palestine  three thousand years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange to read it all to-day, the shifting of the stock;<br>
  You&rsquo;d think you see the caravans that loaf behind the flock,<br>
  The little donkeys and the mules, the sheep that slowly spread,<br>
  And maybe Dan or Naphthali a-ridin&rsquo; on ahead.</p>
<p>The long, dry, dusty summer days, the smouldering fires at night;<br>
  The stir and bustle of the camp at break of morning light;<br>
  The little kids that skipped about, the camels&rsquo; dead-slow tramp&mdash;<br>
  I wish I&rsquo;d done a week or two in Old Man Jacob&rsquo;s camp!</p>
<p><i>But if I keep the narrer path, some day, perhaps, I&rsquo;ll know<br>
  How Jacob bred them strawberry calves three thousand years ago.</i></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his height at five-foot-two,<br>
  With a face as plain as an eight-day clock<br>
  And a walk as brisk as a bantam-cock&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game as a bantam, too,<br>
  Hard and wiry and full of steam,<br>

  Flinging him down like an empty sack,<br>

  He tells the next mug that he corners a tale with the placings reversed;<br>
  And, remember, of judges of racing, the jockey&rsquo;s the absolute worst.</p>
<p>When they lay three to one on the field, and the runners are  twenty-and-two,<br>
  Take a pull on yourself; take a pull&mdash;it&rsquo;s a mighty big field to get through.<br>
  Is the club handicapper a fool? If a fool is about, p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;s you!</p>
<p>Beware of the critic who tells you the handicap&rsquo;s absolute rot,<br>
  For this is chucked in, and that&rsquo;s hopeless, and somebody ought to be shot.<br>
  How is it he can&rsquo;t make a fortune himself when he knows such a lot?</p>
<p>From tipsters, and jockeys, and trials, and gallops, the glory has  gone,<br>
  For this is the wisdom of Hafiz that sages have pondered upon,<br>
  &ldquo;The very best tip in the world is to see the commission go on!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SaltbushBillJP"></a>Saltbush Bill, J.P.</b></h2>
<p>Beyond the land where Leichhardt went,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Sturt&rsquo;s Western track,<br>
  The rolling tide of change has sent<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some strange J.P.s out back.</p>
<p>And Saltbush Bill, grown old and grey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And worn with want of sleep,<br>
  Received the news in camp one day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the travelling sheep</p>
<p>That Edward Rex, confiding in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His known integrity,<br>
  By hand and seal on parchment skin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had made him a J.P.</p>
<p>He read the news with eager face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But found no word of pay.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see my sister&rsquo;s place<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kids on Christmas day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see green grass again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch clear water run,<br>
  Away from this unholy plain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flies, and dust, and sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last one little clause he found<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That might some hope inspire,<br>
  &ldquo;A magistrate may charge a pound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For inquest on a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A big blacks&rsquo; camp was built close by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Saltbush Bill, says he,<br>
  &ldquo;I think that camp might well supply<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A job for a J.P.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, by strange coincidence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A most disastrous fire<br>
  Destroyed the country residence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Jacky Jack, Esquire.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas mostly leaves, and bark, and dirt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party most concerned<br>
  Appeared to think it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If forty such were burned.</p>
<p>Quite otherwise thought Saltbush Bill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who watched the leaping flame.<br>
  &ldquo;The home is small,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but still<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midst palaces though you should roam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or follow pleasure&rsquo;s tracks,<br>
  You&rsquo;ll find,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no place like home,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least like Jacky Jack&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell every man in camp &lsquo;Come quick,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell every black Maria<br>
  I give tobacco half a stick&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold inquest long-a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each juryman received a name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well suited to a Court.<br>
  &ldquo;Long Jack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stumpy Bill&rdquo; became<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;John Long&rdquo; and &ldquo;William Short&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While such as &ldquo;Tarpot&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bullock Dray&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;Tommy Wait-a-While&rdquo;,<br>
  Became, for ever and a day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Scott&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dickens&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Carlyle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And twelve good sable men and true<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were soon engaged upon<br>
  The conflagration that o&rsquo;erthrew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home of John A. John.</p>
<p>Their verdict, &ldquo;Burnt by act of Fate&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They scarcely had returned<br>
  When, just behind the magistrate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another humpy burned!</p>
<p>The jury sat again and drew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another stick of plug.<br>
  Said Saltbush Bill, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put some one long-a Jug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll camp the sheep,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and sift<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence about.&rdquo;<br>
  For quite a week he couldn&rsquo;t shift,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the fires broke out.</p>
<p>The jury thought the whole concern<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As good as any play.<br>
  They used to &ldquo;take him oath&rdquo; and earn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three sticks of plug a day.</p>
<p>At last the tribe lay down to sleep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeless, beneath a tree;<br>
  And onward with his travelling sheep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went Saltbush Bill, J.P.</p>
<p>The sheep delivered, safe and sound,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His horse to town he turned,<br>
  And drew some five-and-twenty pound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fees that he had earned.</p>
<p>And where Monaro&rsquo;s ranges hide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their little farms away&mdash;<br>
  His sister&rsquo;s children by his side&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent his Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The next J.P. that went out back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was shocked, or pained, or both,<br>
  At hearing every pagan black<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat the juror&rsquo;s oath.</p>
<p>No matter though he turned and fled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They followed faster still;<br>
  &ldquo;You make it inkwich, boss,&rdquo; they said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;All same like Saltbush Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They even said they&rsquo;d let him see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fires originate.<br>
  When he refused they said that he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was &ldquo;No good magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And out beyond Sturt&rsquo;s Western track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Leichhardt&rsquo;s farthest tree,<br>
  They wait till fate shall send them back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Saltbush Bill, J.P.<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnAnswertoVariousBards"></a>An Answer to Various Bards</b></h2>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve waited mighty patient while they all came rolling in,<br>
  Mister Lawson, Mister Dyson, and the others of their kin,<br>
  With their dreadful, dismal stories of the Overlander&rsquo;s camp,<br>
  How his fire is always smoky, and his boots are always damp;</p>
<p>And they paint it so terrific it would fill one&rsquo;s soul with gloom,<br>
  But you know they&rsquo;re fond of writing about &ldquo;corpses&rdquo; and &ldquo;the tomb.&rdquo;<br>
  So, before they curse the bushland they should let their fancy range,<br>
  And take something for their livers, and be cheerful for a change.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, Mr. Lawson&mdash;well, of course, we almost cried<br>
  At the sorrowful description how his &ldquo;little &lsquo;Arvie&rdquo; died,<br>
  And we lachrymosed in silence when &ldquo;His Father&rsquo;s Mate&rdquo; was slain;<br>
  Then he went and killed the father, and we had to weep again.</p>
<p>Ben Duggan and Jack Denver, too, he caused them to expire,<br>
  And he went and cooked the gander of Jack Dunn, of Nevertire;<br>
  So, no doubt, the bush is wretched if you judge it by the groan<br>
  Of the sad and soulful poet with a graveyard of his own.</p>
<p>And he spoke in terms prophetic of a revolution&rsquo;s heat,<br>
  When the world should hear the clamour of those people in the street;<br>
  But the shearer chaps who start it&mdash;why, he rounds on them in blame,<br>
  And he calls &rsquo;em &ldquo;agitators&rdquo; who are living on the game.<br>
  But I &ldquo;over-write&rdquo; the bushmen! Well, I own without a doubt<br>
  That I always see a hero in the &ldquo;man from furthest out.&rdquo;<br>
  I could never contemplate him through an atmosphere of gloom,<br>
  And a bushman never struck me as a subject for &ldquo;the tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it ain&rsquo;t all &ldquo;golden sunshine&rdquo; where the &ldquo;wattle branches wave,&rdquo; <br>
  Well, it ain&rsquo;t all damp and dismal, and it ain&rsquo;t all &ldquo;lonely grave.&rdquo;<br>
  And, of course, there&rsquo;s no denying that the bushman&rsquo;s life is rough,<br>
  But a man can easy stand it if he&rsquo;s built of sterling stuff;<br>
  Tho&rsquo; it&rsquo;s seldom that the drover gets a bed of eider-down,<br>
  Yet the man who&rsquo;s born a bushman, he gets mighty sick of town,<br>
  For he&rsquo;s jotting down the figures, and he&rsquo;s adding up the bills<br>
  While his heart is simply aching for a sight of Southern hills.</p>
<p>Then he hears a wool-team passing with a rumble and a lurch,<br>
  And, although the work is pressing, yet it brings him off his perch.<br>
  For it stirs him like a message from his station friends afar<br>
  And he seems to sniff the ranges in the scent of wool and tar;<br>
  And it takes him back in fancy, half in laughter, half in tears,<br>
  To a sound of other voices and a thought of other years,<br>
  When the woolshed rang with bustle from the dawning of the day,<br>
  And the shear-blades were a-clicking to the cry of &ldquo;Wool away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his face was somewhat browner and his frame was firmer set&mdash;<br>
  And he feels his flabby muscles with a feeling of regret.<br>
  But the wool-team slowly passes, and his eyes go sadly back<br>
  To the dusty little table and the papers in the rack,<br>
  And his thoughts go to the terrace where his sickly children squall,<br>
  And he thinks there&rsquo;s something healthy in the bush-life after all.<br>
  But we&rsquo;ll go no more a-droving in the wind or in the sun,<br>
  For our fathers&rsquo; hearts have failed us and the droving days are done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nasty dash of danger where the long-horned bullock  wheels,<br>
  And we like to live in comfort and to get our reg&rsquo;lar meals.<br>
  For to hang around the townships suits us better, you&rsquo;ll agree,<br>
  And a job at washing bottles is the job for such as we.<br>
  Let us herd into the cities, let us crush and crowd and push<br>
  Till we lose the love of roving and we learn to hate the bush;<br>
  And we&rsquo;ll turn our aspirations to a city life and beer,<br>
  And we&rsquo;ll slip across to England&mdash;it&rsquo;s  a nicer place than here;</p>
<p>For there&rsquo;s not much risk of hardship where all comforts are in  store,<br>
  And the theatres are plenty and the pubs are more and more.<br>
  But that ends it, Mr. Lawson, and it&rsquo;s time to say good-bye,<br>
  We must agree to differ in all friendship, you and I;<br>
  So we&rsquo;ll work our own salvation with the stoutest hearts we may,<br>
  And if fortune only favours we will take the road some day,<br>
  And go droving down the river &rsquo;neath the sunshine and the stars,<br>
  And then return to Sydney and vermilionize the bars.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We might have sold him, but someone heard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was bred out back on a flooded run,<br>
  Where he learnt to swim like a waterbird,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midnight or midday were all as one.<br>

<p>&rsquo;Tis a nasty place when the floods are out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in daylight; for all around<br>
  Channels and billabongs twist about,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching for miles in the flooded ground.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to move was a hopeless  thing to try<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark with the water just  racing by.</p>
<p>I had to try it. I heard a roar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wind swept down with the blinding rain;<br>
  And the water rose till it reached the floor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our highest room, and &rsquo;twas very plain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the water was sweeping  down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must shift for the highlands  at once, or drown.</p>
<p>Off to the stable I splashed, and found<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses shaking with cold and fright;<br>
  I led them down to the lower ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never a yard would they swim that night!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reared and snorted and  turned away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none would face it but  Mongrel Grey.</p>
<p>I bound the child on the horse&rsquo;s back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we started off with a prayer to heaven,<br>
  Through the rain and the wind and the pitchy black,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I knew that the instinct God has given<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To guide His creatures by night  and day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would lead the footsteps of  Mongrel Grey.</p>
<p>He struck deep water at once and swam&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swam beside him and held his mane&mdash;<br>
  Till we touched the bank of the broken dam<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shallow water&mdash;then off again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming in darkness across the  flood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank with the smell of the  drifting mud.</p>
<p>He turned and twisted across and back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing the places to wade or swim,<br>
  Picking the safest and shortest track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pitchy darkness was clear to him.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he strike the crossing by  sight or smell?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord that led him alone  could tell!</p>
<p>He dodged the timber whene&rsquo;er he could,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the timber brought us to grief at last;<br>
  I was partly stunned by a log of wood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That struck my head as it drifted past;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I lost my grip of the brave  old grey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in half a second he swept  away.</p>
<p>I reached a tree, where I had to stay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did a perish for two days hard;<br>
  And lived on water&mdash;but Mongrel Grey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked right into the homestead yard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn next morning, and  grazed around,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the child on top of him  safe and sound.</p>
<p>We keep him now for the wife to ride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing too good for him now, of course;<br>
  Never a whip on his fat old hide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she owes the child to that old grey horse.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not Old Tyson himself could  pay<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchase money of Mongrel  Grey.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="GilhooleysEstate"></a>Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>(A  ballad concerning the amalgamation of the legal professions.)</i></p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Gilhooley he turned up his toes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As most of us do, soon or late;<br>
  And Jones was a lawyer, as everyone knows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they took him Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.</p>
<p>Gilhooley in life had been living so free<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas thought his possessions were great,<br>
  So Jones, with a smile, says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a fee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me in Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made out a list of his property fine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It totalled a thousand-and-eight;<br>
  But the debts were nine hundred and ninety and nine&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debts of Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Gilhooley says, &ldquo;Jones, my dear man,<br>
  My childer have little to ait:<br>
  Just keep the expenses as low as you can<br>
  Against poor Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jones says, &ldquo;The will isn&rsquo;t clear in its terms,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear it will need some debate,<br>
  And the law won&rsquo;t allow me (attorneys are worms)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To appear in Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So a barrister-man, with a wig on his head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a brief in his hand quite elate,<br>
  Went up to the Court where they bury the dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to move in Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.</p>
<p>But his Honor the Judge said, &ldquo;I think that the joint<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legatees must be called to pro<i>bate</i>&mdash;<br>
  <i>Ex parte</i> Pokehorney is clear on the  point&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I order a suit to be brought just to try<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is correct that I state&mdash;<br>
  A nice friendly suit, and the costs, by and by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be borne by Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Gilhooley says, &ldquo;Jones, you&rsquo;ll appear!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thim barristers&rsquo; fees is too great;<br>
  The suit is but friendly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Attorneys, my dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can&rsquo;t be heard in Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Barristers&rsquo; Court there&rsquo;s a mighty hurrah<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arises both early and late:<br>
  It&rsquo;s only the whoop of the Junior Bar<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividing Gilhooley&rsquo;s Estate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheRoadtoHogansGap"></a>The Road to Hogan&rsquo;s Gap</b></h2>
<p>Now look, you see, it&rsquo;s this way like,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cross the broken bridge<br>
  And run the crick down till you strike<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second right-hand ridge.</p>
<p>The track is hard to see in parts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still it&rsquo;s pretty clear;<br>
  There&rsquo;s been two Injin hawkers&rsquo; carts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along that road this year.</p>
<p>Well, run that right-hand ridge along&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ain&rsquo;t, to say, too steep&mdash;<br>
  There&rsquo;s two fresh tracks might put you wrong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where blokes went out with sheep.</p>
<p>But keep the crick upon your right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And follow pretty straight<br>
  Along the spur, until you sight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wire and sapling gate.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where Hogan&rsquo;s old grey mare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell off and broke her back;<br>
  You&rsquo;ll see her carcase layin&rsquo; there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jist down below the track.</p>
<p>And then you drop two mile, or three,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty steep and blind;<br>
  You want to go and fall a tree<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tie it on behind.</p>
<p>And then you pass a broken cart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below a granite bluff;<br>
  And that is where you strike the part<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reckon pretty rough.</p>
<p>But by the time you&rsquo;ve got that far<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s either cure or kill,<br>
  So turn your horses round the spur<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And face &rsquo;em up the hill.</p>
<p>For look, if you should miss the slope<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And get below the track,<br>
  You haven&rsquo;t got the whitest hope<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ever gettin&rsquo; back.</p>
<p>An&rsquo; half way up you&rsquo;ll see the hide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Hogan&rsquo;s brindled bull;<br>
  Well, mind and keep the right-hand side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left&rsquo;s too steep a pull.</p>
<p>And both the banks is full of cracks;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; just about at dark<br>
  You&rsquo;ll see the last year&rsquo;s bullock tracks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Hogan drew the bark.</p>
<p>The marks is old and pretty faint<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grown with scrub and such;<br>
  Of course the track to Hogan&rsquo;s ain&rsquo;t<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A road that&rsquo;s travelled much.</p>
<p>But turn and run the tracks along<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half a mile or more,<br>
  And then, of course, you can&rsquo;t go wrong&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re right at Hogan&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>When first you come to Hogan&rsquo;s gate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mightn&rsquo;t show, perhaps;<br>
  He&rsquo;s pretty sure to plant and wait<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see it ain&rsquo;t the traps.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call it good enough<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let your horses out;<br>
  There&rsquo;s some that&rsquo;s pretty extra rough<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is livin&rsquo; round about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely if your horses did<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get feedin&rsquo; near the track,<br>
  It&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to cost at least a quid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or more to get them back.</p>
<p>So, if you find they&rsquo;re off the place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s up to you to go<br>
  And flash a quid in Hogan&rsquo;s face&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll know the blokes that know.</p>
<p>But listen, if you&rsquo;re feelin&rsquo; dry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just see there&rsquo;s no one near,<br>
  And go and wink the other eye<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask for ginger beer.</p>
<p>The blokes come in from near and far<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sample Hogan&rsquo;s pop;<br>
  They reckon once they breast the bar<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stay there till they drop.</p>
<p>On Sundays you can see them spread<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flies around the tap.<br>
  It&rsquo;s like that song &ldquo;The Livin&rsquo; Dead&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up there at Hogan&rsquo;s Gap.</p>
<p>They like to make it pretty strong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever there&rsquo;s a charnce;<br>
  So when a stranger comes along<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They always holds a darnce.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s recitations, songs, and fights&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A willin&rsquo; lot you&rsquo;ll meet.<br>
  There&rsquo;s one long bloke up there recites,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you&mdash;he&rsquo;s a treat.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re lively blokes all right up there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s never dull a day.<br>
  I&rsquo;d go meself if I could spare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to get away.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The stranger turned his horses quick.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t cross the bridge;<br>
  He didn&rsquo;t go along the crick<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strike the second ridge;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t make the trip, because<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t feeling fit.<br>
  His business up at Hogan&rsquo;s was<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve him with a writ.</p>
<p>He reckoned if he faced the pull<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And climbed the rocky stair,<br>
  The next to come might find his hide<br>
  A land-mark on the mountain side,<br>
  Along with Hogan&rsquo;s brindled bull<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hogan&rsquo;s old grey mare!</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ASingeroftheBush"></a>A Singer of the Bush</b></h2>
<p>There is waving of grass in the breeze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a song in the air,<br>
  And a murmur of myriad bees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That toil everywhere.<br>
  There is scent in the blossom and bough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the breath of the Spring<br>
  Is as soft as a kiss on a brow&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Spring-time I sing.</p>
<p>There is drought on the land, and the stock<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ShoutingforaCamel"></a>&ldquo;Shouting&rdquo; for a Camel</b></h2>
<p>It was over at Coolgardie that a mining speculator,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was going down the township just to make a  bit o&rsquo; chink,<br>
  Went off to hire a camel from a camel propagator,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Afghan said he&rsquo;d lend it if he&rsquo;d stand  the beast a drink.<br>
  Yes, the only price he asked him was to stand the beast a drink.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was cheap, very cheap, as the dromedaries go.</p>
<p>So the mining speculator made the bargain, proudly thinking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had bested old Mahomet, he had done him in the  eye.<br>
  Then he clambered on the camel, and the while the beast was drinking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He explained with satisfaction to the miners  standing by<br>
  That &rsquo;twas cheap, very cheap, as the dromedaries go.</p>
<p>But the camel kept on drinking and he filled his hold with water,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more he had inside him yet the more he  seemed to need;<br>
  For he drank it by the gallon, and his girths grew taut and tauter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the miners muttered softly, &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s very  dry indeed!<br>
  But he&rsquo;s cheap, very cheap, as the dromedaries go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he drank up twenty buckets&mdash;it was weird to watch him suck it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (And the market price for water was per bucket  half-a-crown)<br>
  Till the speculator stopped him, saying, &ldquo;Not another bucket&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I give him any more there&rsquo;ll be a famine in  the town.<br>
  Take him back to old Mahomet, and I&rsquo;ll tramp it through the town.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was cheap, very cheap, as the speculators go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a moral to this story&mdash;in your hat you ought to paste it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful whom you shout for when a camel is  about,<br>
  And there&rsquo;s plenty human camels who, before they&rsquo;ll see you waste it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will drink up all you pay for if you&rsquo;re fool  enough to shout;<br>
  If you chance to strike a camel when you&rsquo;re fool enough to shout,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be cheap, very cheap, as the speculators go.</p>

<p>I had spent the night in the watch-house&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head was the size of three&mdash;<br>
  So I went and asked the chemist<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fix up a drink for me;<br>
  And he brewed it from various bottles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With soda and plenty of ice,<br>
  With something that smelt like lemon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And something that seemed like spice.</p>
<p>It fell on my parching palate<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the grass in a soft spring rain;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas only by chance it came&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;s tried me with various liquids<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh! they are not the same.</p>
<p>We have sought, but we sought it vainly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That one lost drink divine;<br>
  We have sampled his various bottles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But somehow they don&rsquo;t combine:<br>
  Yet I know when I cross the River<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stand on the Golden Shore<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MulligansMare"></a>Mulligan&rsquo;s Mare</b></h2>
<p>Oh, Mulligan&rsquo;s bar was the deuce of a place<br>
  To drink and to fight, and to gamble and race;<br>
  The height of choice spirits from near and from far<br>
  Were all concentrated on Mulligan&rsquo;s bar.</p>
<p>There was &ldquo;Jerry the Swell&rdquo;, and the jockey-boy Ned,<br>
  &ldquo;Dog-bite-me&rdquo;&mdash;so called from the shape of his head&mdash;<br>
  And a man whom the boys, in their musical slang,<br>
  Designed as the &ldquo;Gaffer of Mulligan&rsquo;s Gang&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now Mulligan&rsquo;s Gang had a racer to show,<br>
  A bad &rsquo;un to look at, a good &rsquo;un to go;<br>
  Whenever they backed her you safely might swear<br>
  She&rsquo;d walk in a winner, would Mulligan&rsquo;s mare.</p>
<p>But Mulligan, having some radical views,<br>
  Neglected his business and got on the booze;<br>
  He took up with runners&mdash;a treacherous troop&mdash;<br>
  Who gave him away and he &ldquo;fell in the soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it turned out on a fine summer day,<br>
  A bailiff turned up with a writ of &ldquo;<i>fi.  fa</i>.&rdquo;;<br>
  He walked to the bar with a manner serene,<br>
  &ldquo;I levy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the name of the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mulligan wanted, in spite of the law,<br>
  To pay out the bailiff with &ldquo;<i>one</i> on the jaw&rdquo;;<br>
  He drew out to hit him, but, ere you could wink,<br>
  He changed his intentions and stood him a drink.</p>
<p>A great consultation there straightway befel<br>
  &rsquo;Twixt jockey-boy Neddy and Jerry the Swell,<br>
  And the man with the head, who remarked &ldquo;Why, you bet!<br>
  Dog-bite-me!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll diddle &rsquo;em yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll slip out the mare from her stall in a crack,<br>
  And put in her place the old broken-down hack;<br>
  The hack is so like her, I&rsquo;m ready to swear<br>
  The bailiff will think he has Mulligan&rsquo;s mare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So out with the racer and in with the screw,<br>
  We&rsquo;ll show him what Mulligan&rsquo;s talent can do;<br>
  And if he gets nasty and dares to say much,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll knock him as stiff as my grandmother&rsquo;s crutch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then off to the town went the mare and the lad;<br>
  The bailiff came out, never dreamt he was &ldquo;had&rdquo;;<br>
  But marched to the stall with a confident air&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;I levy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;upon Mulligan&rsquo;s mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched her by day and he watched her by night,<br>
  She was never an instant let out of his sight,<br>
  For races were coming away in the West<br>
  And Mulligan&rsquo;s mare had a chance with the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a chance,&rdquo; thought the bailiff, &ldquo;to serve my own ends,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll send off a wire to my bookmaking friends:<br>
  Get all you can borrow, beg, snavel or snare<br>
  And lay the whole lot against Mulligan&rsquo;s mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The races came round, and a crowd on the course<br>
  Were laying the mare till they made themselves hoarse,<br>
  And Mulligan&rsquo;s party, with ardour intense,<br>
  They backed her for pounds and for shillings and pence.</p>
<p>And think of the grief of the bookmaking host<br>
  At the sound of the summons to go to the post&mdash;<br>
  For down to the start with her thorough-bred air<br>
  As fit as a fiddle pranced Mulligan&rsquo;s mare!</p>
<p>They started, and off went the boy to the front,<br>
  He cleared out at once, and he made it a hunt;<br>
  He steadied as rounding the corner they wheeled,<br>
  Then gave her her head and she smothered the field.</p>
<p>The race put her owner right clear of his debts,<br>
  He landed a fortune in stakes and in bets,<br>
  He paid the old bailiff the whole of his pelf,<br>
  And gave him a hiding to keep for himself.</p>
<p>So all you bold sportsmen take warning, I pray,<br>
  Keep clear of the running, you&rsquo;ll find it don&rsquo;t pay;<br>
  For the very best rule that you&rsquo;ll hear in a week&mdash;<br>
  Is never to bet on a thing that can speak.</p>
<p>And whether you&rsquo;re lucky or whether you lose,<br>
  Keep clear of the cards and keep clear of the booze,<br>
  And fortune in season will answer your prayer<br>
  And send you a flyer like Mulligan&rsquo;s mare.</p>

  When the pony missed his take-off, and we crashed into the wall;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, she simply <i>had</i> to have me after  that!</p>

  And, although she <i>looked</i> indifferent when I landed&mdash;on my head&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the water, it appealed to her, of course!</p>
<p>When I won the Flappers&rsquo; Flat-race it was &ldquo;all Sir Garneo&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she praised the way I made my final run.<br>
  And she thought the riding did it&mdash;for how <i>could</i> the poor girl know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a monkey could have ridden it and won!</p>
<p>Then they &ldquo;weighed me in&rdquo; a winner&mdash;it&rsquo;s not often that occurs!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I didn&rsquo;t let my golden chances slip,<br>
  For I showed her all the blood-marks where I jabbed him with the spurs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whip-strokes where I hit him with the  whip.</p>
<p>Then I asked her if she loved me, and she seemed inclined to shirk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, so I took her by the head<br>
  (So to speak) and rushed her at it; and she seemed to like the work<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she kissed me, though she blushed a rosy  red.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a mouth as soft as velvet, and she plenty has of heart;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could worship every little step she takes;<br>
  And the saddling-bell is ringing, so we&rsquo;re going to the start,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain winners, for the Matrimonial Stakes!</p>

<p>Here in my mountain home,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rugged hills and steep,<br>
  I sit and watch you come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Riverina Sheep!</p>
<p>You come from fertile plains<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where saltbush (sometimes) grows,<br>
  And flats that (when it rains)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will blossom like the rose.</p>
<p>But, when the summer sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleams down like burnished brass,<br>
  You have to leave your run<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hustle off for grass.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis then that&mdash;forced to roam&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You come to where I keep,<br>
  Here in my mountain home,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boarding-house for sheep.</p>
<p>Around me where I sit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wary wombat goes&mdash;<br>
  A beast of little wit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he knows, he <i>knows</i>.</p>
<p>The very same remark<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applies to me also;<br>
  I don&rsquo;t give out a spark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I know, I <i>know</i>.</p>
<p>My brain perhaps would show<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No convolutions deep,<br>
  But anyhow I know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to handle sheep.</p>
<p>These Riverina cracks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not care to ride<br>
  The half-inch hanging tracks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the mountain side.</p>
<p>Their horses shake with fear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When loosened boulders go,<br>
  With leaps, like startled deer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the gulfs below.</p>
<p>Their very dogs will shirk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drop their tails in fright<br>
  When asked to go and work<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mob that&rsquo;s out of sight.</p>
<p>My little collie pup<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works silently and wide;<br>
  You&rsquo;ll see her climbing up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the mountain side.</p>
<p>As silent as a fox<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see her come and go,<br>
  A shadow through the rocks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where ash and messmate grow.</p>
<p>Then, lost to sight and sound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind some rugged steep,<br>
  She works her way around<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gathers up the sheep;</p>
<p>And, working wide and shy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds them rounded up.<br>
  The cash ain&rsquo;t coined to buy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That little collie pup.</p>
<p>And so I draw a screw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For self and dog and keep<br>
  To boundary-ride for you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Riverina Sheep!</p>
<p>And when the autumn rain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has made the herbage grow,<br>
  You travel off again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And glad&mdash;no doubt&mdash;to go.</p>
<p>But some are left behind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the mountain&rsquo;s spread,<br>
  For those we cannot find<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put them down as dead.</p>
<p>But when we say adieu<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close the boarding job,<br>
  I always find a few<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh ear-marks in my mob.</p>
<p>So what with those I sell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what with those I keep,<br>
  You pay me pretty well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Riverina Sheep!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to me to shout<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we say good-bye&mdash;<br>

  They were the sons of field and flock since e&rsquo;er they learnt to ride,<br>
  We may not hope to see such men in these degenerate years<br>
  As those explorers of the bush&mdash;the brave old pioneers.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas they who rode the trackless bush in heat and storm and  drought;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas they who heard the master-word that called them farther out;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas they who followed up the trail the mountain cattle made,<br>
  And pressed across the mighty range where now their bones are laid.</p>
<p>But now the times are dull and slow, the brave old days are dead<br>
  When hardy bushmen started out, and forced their way ahead<br>
  By tangled scrub and forests grim towards the unknown west,<br>
  And spied the far-off promised land from off the range&rsquo;s crest.</p>
<p>Oh! ye that sleep in lonely graves by far-off ridge and plain,<br>
  We drink to you in silence now as Christmas comes again,<br>
  To you who fought the wilderness through rough unsettled years&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wheat was ripe and tall,<br>
  A stranger rode to the farmer&rsquo;s gate&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sturdy man and a small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rin doon, rin doon, my little son Jack,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bid the stranger stay;<br>
  And we&rsquo;ll hae a crack for Auld Lang Syne,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the morn is Christmas Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, nay now,&rdquo; said the dour good-wife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But ye should let him be;<br>
  He&rsquo;s maybe only a drover chap<br>

<p>&ldquo;Wi&rsquo; a drover&rsquo;s tales, and a drover&rsquo;s thirst<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To swiggle the hail nicht through;<br>
  Or he&rsquo;s maybe a life assurance carle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk ye black and blue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guid wife, guid wife, be nae sae dour,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wheat stands ripe and tall,<br>
  And we shore a seven-pound fleece this year,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ewes and weaners and all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is grass tae spare, and the stock are fat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they whiles are gaunt and thin,<br>
  And we owe a tithe to the travelling poor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we maun ask him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can set him a chair tae the table side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gi&rsquo; him a bite tae eat;<br>
  An omelette made of a new-laid egg,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a tasty bit of meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the native cats hae taen the fowls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They havena left a leg;<br>
  And he&rsquo;ll get nae omelette here at a&rsquo;<br>

<p>&ldquo;Rin doon, rin doon, my little son Jack,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the auld cock sits beside.</p>

<p>So little son Jack ran blithely down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rusty nails in hand,<br>
  Till he came where the emus fluffed and scratched<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By their nest in the open sand.</p>
<p>And there he has gathered the new-laid egg,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twould feed three men or four,<br>
  And the emus came for the half-inch nails<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right up to the settler&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A waste o&rsquo; food,&rdquo; said the dour good-wife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she took the egg, with a frown,<br>
  &ldquo;But he gets nae meat, unless ye rin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A paddy-melon down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gae oot, gae oot, my little son Jack,<br>

  Gin ye come nae back wi&rsquo; a paddy-melon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then come nae back at a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So little son Jack he raced and he ran,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was bare o&rsquo; the feet,<br>
  And soon he captured a paddy-melon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was gorged with the stolen wheat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit doon, sit doon, my bonny wee man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the best that the hoose can do&mdash;<br>
  An omelette made of the emu egg<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a paddy-melon stew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well, &rsquo;tis well,&rdquo; said the bonny wee man;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have eaten the wide world&rsquo;s meat,<br>
  And the food that is given with right good will<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the sweetest food to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the night draws on to the Christmas Day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must rise and go,<br>
  For I have a mighty way to ride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of the Esquimaux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s there I must load my sledges up,<br>

<p>Then out with a laugh went the bonny wee man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his old horse grazing nigh,<br>
  And away like a meteor flash they went<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off to the Northern sky.</p>

<p class="note">When an attorney is called before the Full Court to answer for any  alleged misconduct it is not usual to publish his name until he is found  guilty; until then the matter appears in the papers as &ldquo;In re a Gentleman, One  of the Attorneys of the Supreme Court&rdquo;, or, more shortly, &ldquo;In re a Gentleman,  One&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We see it each day in the paper,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know that there&rsquo;s mischief in store;<br>
  That some unprofessional caper<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has landed a shark on the shore.<br>

  Because he&rsquo;s been coming the double<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clients, has &ldquo;Gentleman, One&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Alas! for the gallant attorney,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intent upon cutting a dash,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rather more cunning than cash.<br>
  And fortune at first is inviting&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Nemesis, &ldquo;Gentleman, One&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For soon he runs short of the dollars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fears he must go to the wall;<br>
  So Peter&rsquo;s trust-money he collars<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay off his creditor, Paul;<br>
  Then robs right and left&mdash;for he goes it<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In earnest when once he&rsquo;s begun.<br>
  <i>Descensus Averni</i>&mdash;he knows it;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s easy for &ldquo;Gentleman, One&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The crash comes as sure as the seasons;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loses his coin in a mine,<br>
  Or booming in land, or for reasons<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected with women and wine.<br>
  Or maybe the cards or the horses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A share of the damage have done<br>
  No matter; the end of the course is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same: &ldquo;Re a Gentleman, One&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He struggles awhile to keep going,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stave off detection and shame;<br>
  But creditors, clamorous growing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere long put an end to the game.<br>
  At length the poor soldier of Satan<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His course to a finish has run&mdash;<br>
  And just think of Windeyer waiting<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with &ldquo;A Gentleman, One&rdquo;!</p>
<p>And some face it boldly, and brazen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shame and the utter disgrace;<br>
  While others, more sensitive, hasten<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their names and their deeds to efface.<br>
  They snap the frail thread which the Furies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fates have so cruelly spun.<br>
  May the great Final Judge and His juries<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have mercy on &ldquo;Gentleman, One&rdquo;!</p>

  The fierce whips cut and the spurs are red,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace is undiminished;<br>
  Now for the Panics that never fail!<br>
  But many a backer&rsquo;s face grows pale<br>

  For your bullock&rsquo;s in the harness-cask of Morgan Donahoo&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;s the greatest cattle-stealer that abides in Gundaroo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; said Smith, the owner of the Grabben Gullen run,<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get the troopers by the sinking of the sun,<br>
  And down into his homestead to-night we&rsquo;ll take a ride,<br>
  With warrants to identify the carcase and the hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night rode down the troopers, the squatter at their head,<br>
  They rode into the homestead, and pulled Morgan out of bed.<br>
  &ldquo;Now, show to us the carcase of the bullock that you slew&mdash;<br>
  The great marsupial bullock that you killed in Gundaroo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They peered into the harness-cask, and found it wasn&rsquo;t full,<br>
  But down among the brine they saw some flesh and bits of wool.<br>
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; exclaimed the trooper&mdash;&ldquo;an infant, I declare;&rdquo;<br>
  Said Morgan, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the carcase of an old man native bear.<br>
  I heard that ye were coming, so an old man bear I slew,<br>
  Just to give you kindly welcome to my home in Gundaroo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The times is something awful, as you can plainly see,<br>
  The banks have broke the squatters, and they&rsquo;ve broke the likes of me;<br>
  We can&rsquo;t afford a bullock&mdash;such expense would never do&mdash;<br>
  So an old man bear for breakfast is a treat in Gundaroo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And along by Grabben Gullen, where the rushing river flows,<br>
  In the block of broken country where there&rsquo;s no one ever goes,<br>
  On the Upper Murrumbidgee they&rsquo;re a hospitable crew,<br>
  But you mustn&rsquo;t ask for &ldquo;bullock&rdquo; when you go to Gundaroo.</p>

  I dreamed that I was a corner-man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a nigger minstrel show.</p>
<p>I cracked my jokes, and the building rang<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With laughter loud and long;<br>
  I hushed the house as I softly sang<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old plantation song&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cruelty and wrong.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Twas to a small, up-country town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were boys at school,<br>
  There came a circus with a clown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise a bucking mule.<br>
  The clown announced a scheme they had<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spectators for to bring&mdash;<br>
  They&rsquo;d give a crown to any lad<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&rsquo;d ride him round the ring.</p>
<p>And, gentle reader, do not scoff<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor think a man a fool&mdash;<br>
  To buck a porous-plaster off<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was pastime to that mule.</p>
<p>The boys got on; he bucked like sin;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw them in the dirt,<br>
  What time the clown would raise a grin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By asking, &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Johnny Dacey came one night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crack of all the school;<br>
  Said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll win the crown all right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring in your bucking mule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephant went off his trunk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monkey played the fool,<br>
  And all the band got blazing drunk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dacey rode the mule.</p>
<p>But soon there rose a galling shout<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of laughter, for the clown<br>
  From somewhere in his pants drew out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little paper crown.<br>
  He placed the crown on Dacey&rsquo;s head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Dacey looked a fool;<br>
  &ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s your crown, my lad,&rdquo; he said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;For riding of the mule!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The band struck up with &ldquo;Killaloe&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;Rule Britannia, Rule&rdquo;,<br>
  And &ldquo;Young Man from the Country&rdquo;, too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dacey rode the mule.</p>
<p>Then Dacey, in a furious rage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For vengeance on the show<br>
  Ascended to the monkeys&rsquo; cage<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the monkeys go;</p>
<p>The blue-tailed ape and chimpanzee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned abroad to roam;<br>
  Good faith! It was a sight to see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people step for home.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dacey rode the mule.</p>
<p>And from the beasts that made escape,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bushmen all declare,<br>
  Were born some creatures partly ape<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And partly native-bear.<br>

  Folds his fleecy flocks that linger homewards in the setting sun,<br>
  Lived my hero, Jim the Ringer, &ldquo;cocky&rdquo; on Mylora Run.</p>
<p>Jimmy loved the super&rsquo;s daughter, Miss Amelia Jane McGrath.<br>
  Long and earnestly he sought her, but he feared her stern papa;<br>

  Never yet ran smooth or duly, as I think it ought to do.</p>

  A turn in the road and, fair and square,<br>
  They meet the old man standing there.<br>
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, running away, of course,&rdquo;<br>
  Says Jim, emboldened. The old man turned,<br>
  His eye with wild excitement burned.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve raced all day through the scorching heat<br>

  But over that range I think you&rsquo;ll find<br>

  Amelia Jane, get off that horse.<br>
  Up you get, Old Man. Whoop, halloo.<br>
  Here goes to put old Bowneck through!&rdquo;<br>
  Two distant specks on the mountain side,<br>
  Two stockwhips echoing far and wide.<br>
  Amelia Jane sat down and cried.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>

  Ran &rsquo;em till Sambo nearly dropped?<br>

  Did you bolt from father across the plain?<br>
  Jim made you get off Crazy Jane!<br>
  And father got on, and away again<br>

  Good boy, Jimmy! Well done, Jim!<br>
  They&rsquo;re sure to get them now, of course,<br>

  And Jim, they say, rides pretty bold;<br>
  Not like your father, but very fair.<br>

  &ldquo;It never was yet in father&rsquo;s hide<br>

  Jim can rally, and Jim can ride.&rdquo;<br>
  But here again Amelia cried.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The sound of a whip comes faint and far,<br>
  A rattle of hoofs, and here they are,<br>
  In all their tameless pride.<br>
  The fleet wild horses snort with fear,<br>
  And wheel and break as the yard draws near.<br>
  Now, Jim the Ringer, ride!<br>
  Wheel &rsquo;em! wheel &rsquo;em! Whoa back there, whoa!<br>
  And the foam-flakes fly like the driven snow,<br>
  As under the whip the horses go<br>
  Adown the mountain side.<br>
  And Jim, hands down, and teeth firm set,<br>
  On a horse that never has failed him yet,<br>
  Is after them down the range.<br>
  Well ridden! well ridden! they wheel&mdash;whoa back!<br>
  And long and loud the stockwhips crack,<br>
  Their flying course they change,<br>
  &ldquo;Steadily does it&mdash;let Sambo go!<br>

  No thought has he but for his prize.<br>
  Jim catches poor Amelia&rsquo;s eyes.<br>
  &ldquo;Will you come after all? the job is done,<br>
  And Crazy Jane is fit to run<br>
  For a prince&rsquo;s life&mdash;now don&rsquo;t say no;<br>

  At the inner yard, and away we&rsquo;ll go.<br>

  Though he burgled, or murdered, or cheated at loo,<br>
  Or meat on Good Friday (a sin most terrific) ate,<br>
  Could get his discharge, like a bankrupt&rsquo;s certificate.<br>
  (Just here let us note&mdash;<i>Did they choose their best goat?</i><br>
  It&rsquo;s food for conjecture; to judge from the picture<br>
  By Hunt in the Gallery close to our door, a<br>
  Man well might suppose that the scapegoat they chose<br>
  Was a long way from being their choicest Angora.<br>
  In fact I should think he was one of their weediest;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a rule that obtains, no matter who reigns,<br>
  When making a sacrifice, offer the seediest;<br>
  Which accounts for a theory known to my hearers<br>
  Who live in the wild by the wattle beguiled,<br>
  That a &ldquo;stag&rdquo; makes quite good enough mutton for shearers.)<br>
  Be that as it may, as each year passed away,<br>
  A scapegoat was led to the desert and freighted<br>
  With sin (the poor brute must have been overweighted)<br>
  And left there&mdash;to die as his fancy dictated.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The day it has come; with trumpet and drum,<br>
  With pomp and solemnity fit for the tomb,<br>
  They led the old billy-goat off to his doom:<br>
  On every hand a reverend band,<br>
  Prophets and preachers and elders stand<br>
  And the oldest rabbi, with a  tear in his eye,<br>
  Delivers a sermon to all standing by.<br>
  (We haven&rsquo;t his name&mdash;whether Cohen or Harris, he<br>
  No doubt was the &ldquo;poisonest&rdquo; kind of a Pharisee.)<br>
  The sermon was marked by a deal of humility<br>
  And pointed the fact, with no end of ability,<br>
  That being a Gentile&rsquo;s no mark of gentility,<br>
  And, according to Samuel, would certainly d&mdash;n you well.<br>
  Then, shedding his coat, he approaches the goat<br>
  And, while a red fillet he carefully pins on him,<br>
  Confesses the whole of the Israelites&rsquo; sins on him.<br>
  With this eloquent burst he exhorts the accurst&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Go forth in the desert and perish in woe,<br>
  The sins of the people are whiter than snow!&rdquo;<br>
  Then signs to his pal for to let the brute go.</p>
<p>The animal, freed from all restraint<br>
  Lowered his head, made a kind of a feint,<br>
  And charged straight at that elderly saint.<br>
  So fierce his attack, and so very severe, it<br>
  Quite floored the Rabbi, who, ere he could fly,<br>
  Was rammed on the&mdash;no, not the back&mdash;but just near it.<br>
  The scapegoat he snorted, and wildly cavorted,<br>
  A light-hearted antelope &ldquo;out on the ramp,&rdquo;<br>
  Then stopped, looked around, got the &ldquo;lay of the ground,&rdquo; <br>
  And made a bee-line back again to the camp.<br>
  The elderly priest, as he noticed the beast<br>
  So gallantly making his way to the East,<br>
  Says he: &ldquo;From the tents may I never more roam again<br>
  If that there old billy-goat ain&rsquo;t going home again.<br>
  He&rsquo;s hurrying, too! This never will do.<br>
  Can&rsquo;t somebody stop him? I&rsquo;m all of a stew.<br>
  After all our confessions, so openly granted,<br>
  He&rsquo;s taking our sins back to where they&rsquo;re not wanted.<br>
  We&rsquo;ve come all this distance salvation to win agog,<br>
  If he takes home our sins&mdash;it&rsquo;ll burst up the Synagogue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to an Acolyte making his bacca light,<br>
  A fleet-footed youth who could run like a crack o&rsquo; light.<br>
  &ldquo;Run, Abraham, run! Hunt him over the plain,<br>
  And drive back the brute to the desert again.<br>
  The Sphinx is a-watching, the Pyramids frown on you,<br>
  From those granite tops forty cent&rsquo;ries look down on you&mdash;<br>
  Run, Abraham, run! I&rsquo;ll bet half-a-crown on you.&rdquo;<br>
  So Abraham ran; like a man did he go for him,<br>
  But the goat made it clear each time he drew near<br>
  That he had what the racing men call &ldquo;too much toe&rdquo; for him.</p>
<p>The crowd with great eagerness studied the race&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Great Scott! isn&rsquo;t Abraham forcing the pace&mdash;<br>
  And don&rsquo;t the goat spiel? It is hard to keep sight on him,<br>
  The sins of the Israelites ride mighty light on him.<br>
  The scapegoat is leading a furlong or more,<br>
  And Abraham&rsquo;s tiring&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lay six to four!<br>
  He rolls in his stride; he&rsquo;s done, there&rsquo;s no question!&rdquo;<br>
  But here the old Rabbi brought up a suggestion.<br>
  (&rsquo;Twas strange that in racing he showed so much cunning),<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard race,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I think it would be<br>
  A good thing for someone to take up the running.&rdquo;<br>
  As soon said as done, they started to run&mdash;<br>
  The priests and the deacons, strong runners and weak &rsquo;uns<br>
  All reckoned ere long to come up with the brute,<br>
  And so the whole boiling set off in pursuit.<br>
  And then it came out, as the rabble and rout<br>
  Streamed over the desert with many a shout&mdash;<br>
  The Rabbi so elderly, grave, and patrician,<br>
  Had been in his hot youth a bold metallician,<br>
  And offered, in gasps, as they merrily spieled,<br>
  &ldquo;Any price Abraham! Evens the field!&rdquo;<br>
  Alas! the whole clan, they raced and they ran,<br>
  And Abraham proved him an &ldquo;even-time&rdquo; man,<br>
  But the goat, now a speck they could scarce keep their eyes on,<br>
  Stretched out in his stride in a style most surprisin&rsquo;<br>
  And vanished ere long o&rsquo;er the distant horizon.</p>
<p>Away in the camp the bill-sticker&rsquo;s tramp<br>
  Is heard as he wanders with paste, brush, and notices,<br>
  And paling and wall he plasters them all,<br>
  &ldquo;I wonder how&rsquo;s things gettin&rsquo; on with the goat,&rdquo; he says,<br>
  Then pulls out his bills, &ldquo;Use Solomon&rsquo;s Pills&rdquo;:<br>
  &ldquo;Great Stoning of Christians! To all devout Jews! you all<br>
  Must each bring a stone&mdash;Great sport will be shown;<br>
  Enormous Attractions! And prices as usual!<br>
  Roll up to the Hall!! Wives, children, and all,<br>
  For naught the most delicate feelings to hurt is meant!&rdquo;<br>
  Here his eyes opened wide, for close by his side<br>
  Was the scapegoat devouring the latest advertisement!<br>
  One shriek from him burst&mdash;&ldquo;You creature accurst!&rdquo;<br>
  And he ran from the spot like one fearing the worst.<br>
  His language was chaste, as he fled in his haste,<br>
  But the goat stayed behind him&mdash;and &ldquo;scoffed up&rdquo; the paste.</p>
<p>With downcast head, and sorrowful tread,<br>
  The people came back from the desert in dread.<br>
  &ldquo;The goat&mdash;was he back there? Had anyone heard of him?&rdquo;<br>
  In very short order they got plenty word of him,<br>
  In fact as they wandered by street, lane and hall,<br>
  &ldquo;The trail of the serpent was over them all.&rdquo;<br>
  A poor little child knocked out stiff in the gutter<br>
  Proclaimed that the scapegoat was bred for a &ldquo;butter&rdquo;.<br>
  The billsticker&rsquo;s pail told a sorrowful tale,<br>
  The scapegoat had licked it as dry as a nail;<br>
  He raced through their houses, and frightened their spouses,<br>
  But his latest achievement most anger arouses,<br>
  For while they were searching, and scratching their craniums,<br>
  One little Ben Ourbed, who looked in the flower-bed,<br>
  Discovered him, eating the Rabbi&rsquo;s geraniums.</p>
<p align="center">Moral:</p>
<p>The moral is patent to all the beholders&mdash;<br>
  Don&rsquo;t shift your own sins on to other folk&rsquo;s shoulders;<br>
  Be kind to dumb creatures and never abuse them,<br>
  Nor curse them nor kick them, nor spitefully use them;<br>
  Take their lives if needs must&mdash;when it comes to the worst,<br>
  But don&rsquo;t let them perish of hunger or thirst.<br>
  Remember, no matter how far you may roam,<br>
  That dogs, goats, and chickens, it&rsquo;s simply the dickens<br>
  Their talent stupendous for &ldquo;getting back home&rdquo;.<br>
  Your sins, without doubt, will aye find you out,<br>
  And so will a scapegoat, he&rsquo;s bound to achieve it&mdash;<br>
  But, die in the wilderness? Don&rsquo;t you believe it!</p>

  Hurdles, sprints and steeplechases&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up in Dandaloo,<br>
  That a crowd of Sydney stealers,<br>
  Jockeys, pugilists and spielers<br>
  Brought some horses, real heelers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came and put us through.</p>
<p>Beat our nags and won our money,<br>
  Made the game by no means funny,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made us rather blue;<br>
  When the racing was concluded,<br>

  Dandaloonies sat and brooded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in Dandaloo.</p>
<p align="center">* * *&nbsp;  * * * * * *</p>
<p>Night came down on Johnson&rsquo;s shanty<br>
  Where the grog was no means scanty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a tumult grew<br>
  Till some wild, excited person<br>
  Galloped down the township cursing,<br>
  &ldquo;Sydney push have mobbed Macpherson,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll up, Dandaloo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great St. Denis! what commotion!<br>
  Like the rush of stormy ocean<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiery horsemen flew.<br>
  Dust and smoke and din and rattle,<br>
  Down the street they spurred their cattle<br>
  To the war-cry of the battle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wade in, Dandaloo!&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
  So the boys might have their fight out,<br>
  Johnson blew the bar-room light out,<br>

  Whom a shearer tried to throttle,<br>
  Hit out freely with a bottle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in Dandaloo.</p>
<p>Skin and hair were flying thickly,<br>
  When a light was fetched, and quickly<br>

  We&rsquo;d been belting one another;<br>
  Jack Macpherson bashed his brother<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in Dandaloo.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one ever knew&mdash;<br>
  And the stockmen tell the story<br>
  Of that conflict fierce and gory,<br>
  How we fought for love and glory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up in Dandaloo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a proverb now, or near it&mdash;<br>
  At the races you can hear it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dog-fights, too!<br>
  Every shrieking, dancing drover<br>
  As the canines topple over<br>
  Yells applause to Grip or Rover,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Give him &lsquo;Dandaloo&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the teamster slowly toiling<br>
  Through the deep black country, soiling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheels and axles, too,<br>
  Lays the whip on Spot and Banker,<br>
  Rouses Tarboy with a flanker&mdash;<br>

<p>The railway rattled and roared and swung<br>
  With jolting carriage and bumping trucks.<br>
  The sun, like a billiard red ball, hung<br>
  In the Western sky: and the tireless tongue<br>
  Of the wild-eyed man in the corner told<br>
  This terrible tale of the days of old,<br>
  And the party that ought to have kept the ducks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t all joy bein&rsquo; on the land<br>
  With an overdraft that&rsquo;d knock you flat;<br>
  And the rabbits have pretty well took command;<br>
  But the hardest thing for a man to stand<br>
  Is the feller who says &lsquo;Well, I told you so!<br>
  You should ha&rsquo; done this way, don&rsquo;t you know!&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
  I could lay a bait for a man like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grasshoppers struck us in ninety-one<br>
  And what they leave&mdash;well, it ain&rsquo;t <i>de  luxe</i>.<br>
  But a growlin&rsquo; fault-findin&rsquo; son of a gun<br>
  Who&rsquo;d lent some money to stock our run&mdash;<br>
  I said they&rsquo;d eaten what grass we had&mdash;<br>
  Says he, &lsquo;Your management&rsquo;s very bad,<br>
  You had a right to have kept some ducks!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have kept some ducks! And the place was white!<br>
  Wherever you went you had to tread<br>
  On grasshoppers guzzlin&rsquo; day and night;<br>
  And when with a swoosh they rose in flight,<br>
  If you didn&rsquo;t look out for yourself they&rsquo;d fly<br>
  Like bullets into your open eye<br>
  And knock it out of the back of your head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a turkey or goose or swan,<br>
  Or a duck that quacks, or a hen that clucks,<br>
  Can make a difference on a run<br>
  When a grasshopper plague has once begun;<br>
  &lsquo;If you&rsquo;d finance us,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d buy<br>
  Ten thousand emus and have a try;<br>
  The job,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;is too big for ducks!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must fetch a duck when you come to stay;<br>
  A great big duck&mdash;a Muscovy toff&mdash;<br>
  Ready and fit,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;for the fray;<br>
  And if the grasshoppers come our way<br>
  You turn your duck into the lucerne patch,<br>
  And I&rsquo;d be ready to make a match<br>
  That the grasshoppers eats his feathers off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to visit us by and by,<br>
  And it just so happened one day in Spring<br>
  A kind of a cloud came over the sky&mdash;<br>
  A wall of grasshoppers nine miles high,<br>
  And nine miles thick, and nine hundred wide,<br>
  Flyin&rsquo; in regiments, side by side,<br>
  And eatin&rsquo; up every living thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All day long, like a shower of rain,<br>
  You&rsquo;d hear &rsquo;em smackin&rsquo; against the wall,<br>
  Tap, tap, tap, on the window pane,<br>
  And they&rsquo;d rise and jump at the house again<br>
  Till their crippled carcases piled outside.<br>
  But what did it matter if thousands died&mdash;<br>
  A million wouldn&rsquo;t be missed at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were drinkin&rsquo; grasshoppers&mdash;so to speak&mdash;<br>
  Till we skimmed their carcases off the spring;<br>
  And they fell so thick in the station creek<br>
  They choked the waterholes all the week.<br>
  There was scarcely room for a trout to rise,<br>
  And they&rsquo;d only take artificial flies&mdash;<br>
  They got so sick of the real thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Arctic snowstorm was beat to rags<br>
  When the hoppers rose for their morning flight<br>
  With a flapping noise like a million flags:<br>
  And the kitchen chimney was stuffed with bags<br>
  For they&rsquo;d fall right into the fire, and fry<br>
  Till the cook sat down and began to cry&mdash;<br>
  And never a duck or a fowl in sight!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We strolled across to the railroad track&mdash;<br>
  Under a cover, beneath some trucks,<br>
  I sees a feather and hears a quack;<br>
  I stoops and I pulls the tarpaulin back&mdash;<br>
  Every duck in the place was there,<br>
  No good to them was the open air.<br>
  &lsquo;Mister,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s your blanky ducks!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  With easy seat and nerve of steel, light hand and smiling face,<br>

<p><i>Now, this is just a simple tale to tell the reader how<br>
  They civilised the Maori tribe at Rooti-iti-au.</i></p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The Maoris are a mighty race&mdash;the finest ever known;<br>
  Before the missionaries came they worshipped wood and stone;<br>
  They went to war and fought like fiends, and when the war was done<br>
  They pacified their conquered foes by eating every one.<br>
  But now-a-days about the pahs in idleness they lurk,<br>
  Prepared to smoke or drink or talk&mdash;or anything but work.<br>
  The richest tribe in all the North in sheep and horse and cow<br>
  Were those who led their simple lives at Rooti-iti-au.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas down to town at Wellington a noble Maori came,<br>
  A Rangatira of the best, Rerenga was his name&mdash;<br>
  (The word Rerenga means a &ldquo;snag&rdquo;&mdash;but until he was gone<br>
  This didn&rsquo;t strike the folk he met&mdash;it struck them later on).<br>
  He stalked into the Bank they call the &ldquo;Great Financial Hell&rdquo;,<br>
  And told the Chief Financial Fiend the tribe had wool to sell.<br>
  The Bold Bank Manager looked grave&mdash;the price of wool was high.<br>
  He said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lend you what you need&mdash;we&rsquo;re not disposed to buy.</p>
<p>You ship the wool to England, Chief!&mdash;You&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s  good advice,<br>
  And meanwhile you can draw from us the local market price.&rdquo;<br>
  The Chief he thanked him courteously and said he wished to state<br>
  In all the Rooti-iti tribe his mana would be great,<br>
  But still the tribe were simple folk, and did not understand<br>
  This strange finance that gave them cash without the wool in hand.<br>
  So off he started home again, with trouble on his brow,<br>
  To lay the case before the tribe at Rooti-iti-au.</p>
<p>They held a great korero in the Rooti-iti clan,<br>
  With speeches lasting half a day from every leading man.<br>
  They called themselves poetic names&mdash;&ldquo;lost children in a wood&rdquo;;<br>
  They said the Great Bank Manager was Kapai&mdash;extra good!<br>
  And so they sent Rerenga down, full-powered and well-equipped,<br>
  To draw as much as he could get, and let the wool be shipped;<br>
  And wedged into a &ldquo;Cargo Tank&rdquo;, full up from stern to bow,<br>
  A mighty clip of wool went Home from Rooti-iti-au.</p>
<p>It was the Bold Bank Manager who drew a heavy cheque;<br>
  Rerenga cashed it thoughtfully, then clasped him round the neck;<br>
  A hug from him was not at all a thing you&rsquo;d call a lark&mdash;<br>
  You see he lived on mutton-birds and dried remains of shark&mdash;<br>
  But still it showed his gratitude, and, as he pouched the pelf,<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll haka for you, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in honour of yourself!&rdquo;<br>
  The haka is a striking dance&mdash;the sort they don&rsquo;t allow<br>
  In any place more civilised than Rooti-iti-au.</p>
<p>He &ldquo;haka&rsquo;d&rdquo; most effectively&mdash;then, with an airy grace<br>
  Rubbed noses with the Manager, and vanished into space.<br>
  But when the wool-return came back, ah me, what sighs and groans!<br>
  For every bale of Maori wool was loaded up with stones!<br>
  Yes&mdash;thumping great New    Zealand rocks among the wool they found;<br>
  On every rock the Bank had lent just seven pence a pound.<br>
  And now the Bold Bank Manager, with trouble on his brow,<br>
  Is searching vainly for the chief from Rooti-iti-au.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your bold reveille?<br>
  O&rsquo;er the ocean far away<br>
  From your sunny southern home,<br>
  Over leagues of trackless foam,<br>
  In a foreign land to roam<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your bold reveille.</p>
<p>When  we hear our brethren call,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound a clear reveille.<br>
  Then we answer, one and all,<br>
  Answer that the world may see,<br>
  &ldquo;Of the English stock are we,<br>
  At their side we still will be&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s our bold  reveille.</p>
