<h3>FOREWORD</h3>
<br>
<p>All Sydney people, and most of those who have visited the
city, have seen the tall monument to Lap&eacute;rouse overlooking
Botany Bay. Many have perhaps read a little about him, and know
the story of his surprising appearance in this harbour six days
after the arrival of Governor Phillip with the First Fleet. One
can hardly look at the obelisk, and at the tomb of P&egrave;re
Receveur near by, without picturing the departure of the French
ships after bidding farewell to the English officers and
colonists. Sitting at the edge of the cliff, one can follow
Lap&eacute;rouse out to sea, with the eye of imagination, until
sails, poops and hulls diminish to the view and disappear below
the hazy-blue horizon. We may be sure that some of Governor
Phillip's people watched the sailing, and the lessening, and the
melting away of the vessels, from just about the same place, one
hundred and twenty four years ago. What they saw, and what we can
imagine, was really the end of a romantic career, and the
beginning of a mystery of the sea which even yet has not lost its
fascination.</p>
<p>The story of that life is surely worth telling, and, we trust,
worth reading; for it is that of a good, brave and high-minded
man, a great sailor, and a true gentleman. The author has put
into these few pages what he has gleaned from many volumes, some
of them stout, heavy and dingy tomes, though delightful enough to
"those who like that sort of thing". He hopes that the book may
for many readers touch with new meaning those old weatherworn
stones at Botany Bay, and make the personality of
Lap&eacute;rouse live again for such as nourish an interest in
Australian history.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>Chapter I.</h3>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>FAMILY, YOUTH and INFLUENCES</b></p>
<br>
<p>JEAN-FRAN&Ccedil;OIS GALAUP, COMTE DE LAP&Eacute;ROUSE, was
born at Albi, on August 23, 1741. His birthplace is the chief
town in the Department of Tarn, lying at the centre of the
fruitful province of Languedoc, in the south of France. It boasts
a fine old Gothic cathedral, enriched with much noble carving and
brilliant fresco painting; and its history gives it some
importance in the lurid and exciting annals of France. From its
name was derived that of a religious sect, the Albigeois, who
professed doctrines condemned as heretical and endured severe
persecution during the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>But among all the many thousands of men who have been born,
and have lived, and died in the old houses of the venerable city,
none, not even among its bishops and counts, has borne a name
which lives in the memory of mankind as does that of the
navigator, Lap&eacute;rouse. The sturdy farmers of the fat and
fertile plain which is the granary of France, who drive in to
Albi on market days, the patient peasants of the fields, and the
simple artisans who ply their primitive trades under the shadow
of the dark-red walls of St. Cecile, know few details, perhaps,
about the sailor who sank beneath the waters of the Pacific so
many years ago. Yet very many of them have heard of
Lap&eacute;rouse, and are familiar with his monument cast in
bronze in the public square of Albi. They speak his name
respectfully as that of one who grew up among their ancestors,
who trod their streets, sat in their cathedral, won great fame,
and met his death under the strange, distant, southern stars.</p>
<p>His family had for five hundred years been settled, prominent
and prosperous, on estates in the valley of the Tarn. In the
middle of the fifteenth century a Galaup held distinguished
office among the citizens of Albi, and several later ancestors
are mentioned honourably in its records. The father of the
navigator, Victor Joseph de Galaup, succeeded to property which
maintained him in a position of influence and affluence among his
neighbours. He married Marguerite de Ress&eacute;guier, a woman
long remembered in the district for her qualities of manner and
mind. She exercised a strong influence over her adventurous but
affectionate son; and a letter written to her by him at an
interesting crisis of his life, testifies to his eager desire to
conform to his mother's wishes even in a matter that wrenched his
heart, and after years of service in the Navy had taken him far
and kept him long from her kind, concerning eyes.</p>
<p>Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois derived the name by which he is known in
history from the estate of Peyrouse, one of the possessions of
his family. But he dropped the "y" when assuming the designation,
and invariably spelt the name "Lap&eacute;rouse", as one word.
Inasmuch as the final authority on the spelling of a personal
name is that of the individual who owns it, there can be no doubt
that we ought always to spell this name "Lap&eacute;rouse", as,
in fact, successors in the family who have borne it have done;
though in nearly all books, French as well as English, it is
spelt "La P&eacute;rouse". In the little volume now in the
reader's hands, the example of Lap&eacute;rouse himself has been
followed.</p>
<p>On this point it may be remarked concerning another navigator
who was engaged in Australian exploration, that we may lose touch
with an interesting historical fact by not observing the correct
form of a name. On maps of Tasmania appears "D'Entrecasteaux
Channel". It was named by and after Admiral Bruny Dentrecasteaux,
who as commander of the <i>Recherche</i> and
<i>Esp&eacute;rance</i> visited Australian waters. We shall have
something to say about his expedition towards the close of the
book. Now, Dentrecasteaux sailed from France in 1791, while the
Revolution was raging. All titles had been abolished by a decree
of the National Assembly on July 19th, 1790. When he made this
voyage, therefore, the Admiral was not Bruny D'Entrecasteaux, a
form which implied a territorial titular distinction; but simply
Citizen Dentrecasteaux. The name is so spelt in the contemporary
histories of his expedition written by Rossel and
Labillardi&egrave;re. It would not have been likely to be spelt
in any other way by a French officer at the time. Thus, the
Marquis de la Fayette became simply Lafayette, and so with all
other bearers of titles in France. Consequently we should, by
observing this little difference, remind ourselves of
Dentrecasteaux' period and circumstances.</p>
<p>That, however, is by the way, and our main concern for the
present is with Lap&eacute;rouse.</p>
<p>As a boy, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois developed a love for books of
voyages, and dreamt, as a boy will, of adventures that he would
enjoy when he grew to manhood. A relative tells us that his
imagination was enkindled by reading of the recent discoveries of
Anson. As he grew up, and himself sailed the ocean in command of
great ships, he continued to read all the voyaging literature he
could procure. The writings of Byron, Carteret, Wallis, Louis de
Bougainville, "and above all Cook", are mentioned as those of his
heroes. He "burned to follow in their footsteps".</p>
<p>It will be observed that, with one exception, the navigators
who are especially described by one of his own family as having
influenced the bent of Lap&eacute;rouse were Englishmen. He did
not, of course, read all of their works in his boyhood, because
some of them were published after he had embraced a naval career.
But we note them in this place, as the guiding stars by which he
shaped his course. He must have been a young man, already on the
way to distinction as an officer, when he came under the spell of
Cook. "And above all Cook", says his relative. To the end of his
life, down to the final days of his very last voyage,
Lap&eacute;rouse revered the name of Cook. Every Australian
reader will like him the better for that. Not many months before
his own life ended in tragedy and mystery, he visited the island
where the great English sailor was slain. When he reflected on
the achievements of that wonderful career, he sat down in his
cabin and wrote in his Journal the passage of which the following
is a translation. It is given here out of its chronological
order, but we are dealing with the influences that made
Lap&eacute;rouse what he was, and we can see from these sincere
and feeling words, what Cook meant to him:</p>
<p>"Full of admiration and of respect as I am for the memory of
that great man, he will always be in my eyes the first of
navigators. It is he who has determined the precise position of
these islands, who has explored their shores, who has made known
the manners, customs and religion of the inhabitants, and who has
paid with his blood for all the light which we have to-day
concerning these peoples. I would call him the Christopher
Columbus of these countries, of the coast of Alaska, and of
nearly all the isles of the South Seas. Chance might enable the
most ignorant man to discover islands, but it belongs only to
great men like him to leave nothing more to be done regarding the
coasts they have found. Navigators, philosophers, physicians, all
find in his Voyages interesting and useful things which were the
object of his concern. All men, especially all navigators, owe a
tribute of praise to his memory. How could one neglect to pay it
at the moment of coming upon the group of islands where he
finished so unfortunately his career?"</p>
<p>We can well understand that a lad whose head was full of
thoughts of voyaging and adventure, was not, as a schoolboy, very
tame and easy to manage. He is described as having been ardent,
impetuous, and rather stubborn. But there is more than one kind
of stubbornness. There is the stupid stubbornness of the mule,
and the fixed, firm will of the intelligent being. We can
perceive quite well what is meant in this case. On the other
hand, he was affectionate, quick and clever. He longed for the
sea; and his father, observing his decided inclination, allowed
him to choose the profession he desired.</p>

<br>
<b>The Lap&eacute;rouse Family</b></p>
<br>
<p>It may well have seemed to the parents of Lap&eacute;rouse at
this time that fine prospects lay before a gallant young
gentleman who should enter the Marine. There was for the moment
peace between France and England. A truce had been made by the
treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. But everybody knew that there
would be war again soon. Both countries were struggling for the
mastery in India and in North America. The sense of rivalry was
strong. Jealousies were fierce on both sides. In India, the
French power was wielded, and ever more and more extended, by the
brilliant Governor Dupleix; whilst in the British possessions the
rising influence was that of the dashing, audacious Clive. In
North America the French were scheming to push their dominion
down the Ohio-Mississippi Valley from Canada to the Gulf of
Mexico, in the rear of the line of British colonies planted on
the seaboard from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Florida. The
colonists were determined to prevent them; and a young man named
George Washington, who afterwards became very famous, first rose
into prominence in a series of tough struggles to thwart the
French designs. The points of collision between the two nations
were so sharp, feeling on either side was so bitter, the
contending interests were so incapable of being reconciled, that
it was plain to all that another great war was bound to break
out, and that sea power would play a very important part in the
issue. The young Lap&eacute;rouse wanted to go to sea, and his
father wanted him to distinguish himself and confer lustre on his
name. The choice of a calling for him, therefore, suited all the
parties concerned.</p>
<p>He was a boy of fifteen when, in November, 1756, he entered
the Marine service as a royal cadet. He had not long to wait
before tasting "delight of battle", for the expected war was
declared in May, and before he was much older he was in the thick
of it.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>Chapter II.</h3>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>THE FRENCH NAVAL OFFICER.</b></p>
<br>
<p>LAP&Eacute;ROUSE first obtained employment in the French navy
in the <i>Cel&egrave;bre</i>, from March to November, 1757. From
this date until his death, thirty-one years later, he was almost
continuously engaged, during peace and war, in the maritime
service of his country. The official list of his appointments
contains only one blank year, 1764. He had then experienced close
upon seven years of continuous sea fighting and had served in as
many ships: the <i>Cel&egrave;bre</i>, the <i>Pomone</i>, the
<i>Z&eacute;phir</i>, the <i>Cerf</i>, the <i>Formidable</i>, the
<i>Robuste</i>, and the <i>Six Corps</i>. But the peace of Paris
was signed in the early part of 1763. After that, having been
promoted to the rank of ensign, he had a rest.</p>
<p>It was not a popular peace on either side. In Paris there was
a current phrase, "<i>b&ecirc;te comme la paix</i>", stupid as
the peace. In England, the great Pitt was so indignant on account
of its conditions that, all swollen and pinched with gout as he
was, he had himself carried to the House of Commons, his limbs
blanketted in bandages and his face contorted with pain, and,
leaning upon a crutch, denounced it in a speech lasting three
hours and forty minutes. The people cheered him to the echo when
he came out to his carriage, and the vote favourable to the terms
of the treaty was carried by wholesale corruption. But all the
same, Great Britain did very well out of it, and both countries
&mdash;though neither was satisfied&mdash;were for the time being
tired of war.</p>
<p>For Lap&eacute;rouse the seven years had been full of
excitement. The most memorable engagement in which he took part
was a very celebrated one, in November, 1759. A stirring ballad
has been written about it by Henry Newbolt:</p>
<p class="poem">"In seventeen hundred and fifty-nine<br>
   When Hawke came swooping from the West,<br>
The French King's admiral with twenty of the line<br>
   Came sailing forth to sack us out of Brest."</p>
<p>Lap&eacute;rouse's ship, the <i>Formidable</i>, was one of the
French fleet of twenty-one sail. What happened was this. The
French foreign minister, Choiseul, had hatched a crafty plan for
the invasion of England, but before it could be executed the
British fleet had to be cleared out of the way. There was always
that tough wooden wall with the hearts of oak behind it, standing
solidly in the path. It baffled Napoleon in the same fashion when
he thought out an invasion plan in the next century. The French
Admiral, Conflans, schemed to lure Sir Edward Hawke into Quiberon
Bay, on the coast of Brittany. A strong westerly gale was blowing
and was rapidly swelling into a raging tempest. Conflans, piloted
by a reliable guide who knew the Bay thoroughly, intended to take
up a fairly safe, sheltered position on the lee side, and hoped
that the wind would force Hawke, who was not familiar with the
ground, on to the reefs and shoals, where his fleet would be
destroyed by the storm and the French guns together. But Hawke,
whose name signally represents the bold, swift, sure character of
the man, understood the design, took the risk, avoided the
danger, and clutched the prey. Following the French as rapidly as
wind and canvas could take him, he caught their rearmost vessels,
smashed them up, battered the whole fleet successively into
flight or splinters, and himself lost only two vessels, which ran
upon a shoal. Plodding prose does scant justice to the
extraordinary brilliancy of Hawke's victory, described by Admiral
Mahan as "the Trafalgar of this war". We cannot pass on without
quoting one of Mr. Newbolt's graphic verses:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"'Twas long past the noon of a wild November
day<br>
   When Hawke came swooping from the west;<br>
He heard the breakers thundering in Quiberon Bay,<br>
   But he flew the flag for battle, line abreast.<br>
Down upon the quicksands, roaring out of sight,<br>
Fiercely blew the storm wind, darkly fell the night,<br>
For they took the foe for pilot and the cannon's glare for
light,<br>
   When Hawke came swooping from the West."</p>
<p>"They took the foe for pilot": that is a most excellent touch,
both poetical and true.</p>
<p>The <i>Formidable</i> was the first to be disposed of in the
fight. She was an 80-gun line-of-battle ship, carrying the flag
of Admiral du Verger. Her position being in the rear of the
squadron, she was early engaged by the <i>Resolution</i>, and in
addition received the full broadside of every other British ship
that passed her. The Admiral fell mortally wounded, and two
hundred on board were killed. She struck her colours at four
o'clock after receiving a terrible battering, and was the only
French ship captured by Hawke's fleet. All the others were sunk,
burnt, or beached, or else escaped. The young Lap&eacute;rouse
was amongst the wounded, though his hurts were not dangerous;
and, after a brief period spent in England as a prisoner of war,
he returned to service.</p>
<p>An amusing rhyme in connection with this engagement is worth
recalling. Supplies for Hawke's fleet did not come to hand for a
considerable time after they were due, and in consequence the
victorious crews had to be put on "short commons". Some
wag&mdash;it is the way of the British sailor to do his grumbling
with a spice of humour&mdash;put the case thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"Ere Hawke did bang<br>
   Monsieur Conflans,<br>
You sent us beef and beer;<br>
   Now Monsieur's beat<br>
   We've nought to eat,<br>
Since you have nought to fear."</p>
<p>An interesting coincidence must also be noted. Thirty-five
years later, only a few leagues from the place where
Lap&eacute;rouse first learnt what it meant to fight the British
on the sea, another young officer who was afterwards greatly
concerned with Australasian exploration had his introduction to
naval warfare. It was in 1794 that Midshipman Matthew Flinders,
on the <i>Bellerophon</i>, Captain Pasley, played his valiant
little part in a great fleet action off Brest. Both of these
youths, whose longing was for exploration and discovery, and who
are remembered by mankind in that connection, were cradled on the
sea amidst the smoke and flame of battle, both in the same
waters.</p>
<p>During the next twenty-five years Lap&eacute;rouse saw a
considerable amount of fighting in the East and West Indies, and
in Canadian waters. He was commander of the <i>Amazon</i>, under
D'Estaing, during a period when events did not shape themselves
very gloriously for British arms, not because our admirals had
lost their skill and nerve, or our seamen their grit and courage,
but because Governments at home muddled, squabbled, starved the
navy, misunderstood the problem, and generally made a mess of
things. We need not follow him through the details of these
years, but simply note that Lap&eacute;rouse's dash and good
seamanship won him a high reputation among French naval officers,
and brought him under the eye of the authorities who afterwards
chose him to command an expedition of discovery.</p>
<p>One incident must be recorded, because it throws a light on
the character of Lap&eacute;rouse. In 1782, whilst serving under
Admiral Latouche-Tr&eacute;ville in the West, he was ordered to
destroy the British forts on the Hudson River. He attacked them
with the <i>Sceptre</i>, 74 guns. The British had been engaged in
their most unfortunate war with the American Colonies, and in
1781, in consequence of wretchedly bad strategy, had lost command
of the sea. The French had been helping the revolted Americans,
not for love of them, but from enmity to their rivals. After the
capitulation of the British troops at Yorktown, a number of
loyalists still held out under discouraging conditions in Canada,
and the French desired to dislodge them from the important
waterway of the Hudson.</p>
<p>Lap&eacute;rouse found little difficulty in fulfilling his
mission, for the defence was weak and the garrisons of the forts,
after a brief resistance, fled to the woods. It was then that he
did a thing described in our principal naval history as an act of
"kindness and humanity, rare in the annals of war".
Lap&eacute;rouse knew that if he totally destroyed the stores as
well as the forts, the unfortunate British, after he had left,
would perish either from hunger or under the tomahawks of the Red
Indians. So he was careful to see that the food and clothing, and
a quantity of powder and small arms, were left untouched, for, as
he nobly said, "An enemy conquered should have nothing more to
fear from a civilised foe; he then becomes a friend."</p>
<p>Some readers may like to see the verses in which a French poet
has enshrined this incident. For their benefit they are
appended:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"Un jour ayant appris que les Anglais en
fuite<br>
Se cachaient dans un bois redoutant la poursuite,<br>
Tu laissas sur la plage aux soldats affam&eacute;s,<br>
Par la peur affol&eacute;s, en haillons,
d&eacute;sarm&eacute;s,<br>
Des vivres abondantes, des habits et des armes;<br>
Tu t'&eacute;loignas apres pour calmer leurs alarmes,<br>
Et quand on s'&eacute;tonnait: 'Sachez qu' un ennemi<br>
Vaincu n'a rien &agrave; craindre, et devient un ami.'"</p>
<p>The passage may be rendered in English thus: "One day, having
heard that the fleeing English were hidden in a forest dreading
pursuit, you left upon the shore for those
soldiers&mdash;famished, ragged, disarmed, and paralysed by
fear&mdash;abundance of food, clothes and arms; then, to calm
their fears, you removed your forces to a distance; and, when
astonishment was expressed, you said: 'Understand that a beaten
enemy has nothing to fear from us, and becomes a friend.'"</p>

<p align="center"><b>THE LOVE STORY OF LAP&Eacute;ROUSE.</b></p>
<br>
<p>"MY story is a romance"&mdash;"Mon histoire est un
roman"&mdash;wrote Lap&eacute;rouse in relating the events with
which this chapter will deal. We have seen him as a boy; we have
watched him in war; we shall presently follow him as a navigator.
But it is just as necessary to read his charming love story, if
we are to understand his character. We should have no true idea
of him unless we knew how he bore himself amid perplexities that
might have led him to quote, as peculiarly appropriate to his own
case, the lines of Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"Ay me! for ought that ever I could read,<br>
Could ever hear by tale or history,<br>
The course of true love never did run smooth,"</p>
<p>During the period of his service in the East Indies,
Lap&eacute;rouse frequently visited Ile-de-France (which is now a
British possession, called Mauritius). Then it was the principal
naval station of the French in the Indian Ocean. There he met a
beautiful girl, the daughter of one of the subordinate officials
at Port Louis. Louise &Eacute;l&eacute;onore Broudou is said to
have been "more than pretty"; she was distinguished by grace of
manner, charm of disposition, and fine, cultivated character. The
young officer saw her often, admired her much, fell in love with
her, and asked her to marry him. Mademoiselle loved him too; and
if they two only had had to be consulted, the happy union of a
well-matched pair might have followed soon.</p>
<p>It signified little to Lap&eacute;rouse, in love, that the
lady had neither rank nor fortune. But his family in France took
quite a different view. He wrote to a favourite sister, telling
her about it, and she lost no time in conveying the news to his
parents. This was in 1775. Then the trouble began.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as he was over thirty years of age at this time, it
may be thought that he might have been left to choose a wife for
himself. But a young officer of rank in France, under the Old
R&eacute;gime, was not so free in these matters as he would be
nowadays. Marriage was much more than a personal affair. It was
even more than a family affair. People of rank did not so much
marry as "make alliances"&mdash;or rather, submit to having them
made for them. It was quite a regular thing for a marriage to be
arranged by the families of two young people who had never even
seen each other. An example of that kind will appear
presently.</p>
<p>The idea that the Comte de Lap&eacute;rouse, one of the
smartest officers in the French King's navy, should marry out of
his rank and station, shocked his relatives and friends as much
as it would have done if he had been detected picking pockets. He
could not, without grave risk of social and professional ruin,
marry until he had obtained the consent of his father,
and&mdash;so naval regulations required&mdash;of his official
superiors. Both were firmly refused. Monsieur de Ternay, who
commanded on the Ile-de-France station, shook his wise head, and
told the lover "that his love fit would pass, and that people did
not console themselves for being poor with the fact that they
were married." (This M. de Ternay, it may be noted, had commanded
a French squadron in Canada in 1762, and James Cook was a junior
officer on the British squadron which blockaded him in St. John's
Harbour. He managed to slip out one night, much to the disgust of
Colville, the British Admiral, who commented scathingly on his
"shameful flight".)</p>
<p>The father of Lap&eacute;rouse poured out his forbidding
warnings in a long letter. Listen to the "tut-tut" of the old
gentleman at Albi:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You make me tremble, my son. How can you face with coolness
the consequences of a marriage which would bring you into
disgrace with the Minister and would lose you the assistance of
powerful friends? You would forfeit the sympathies of your
colleagues and would sacrifice the fruit of your work during
twenty years. In disgracing yourself you would humiliate your
family and your parents. You would prepare for yourself nothing
but remorse; you would sacrifice your fortune and position to a
frivolous fancy for beauty and to pretended charms which perhaps
exist only in your own imagination. Neither honour nor probity
compels you to meet ill-considered engagements that you may have
made with that person or with her parents. Do they or you know
that you are not free, that you are under my authority?" He went
on to draw a picture of the embarrassments that would follow such
a marriage, and then there is a passage revealing the cash-basis
aspect of the old gentleman's objection: "You say that there are
forty officers in the Marine who have contracted marriages
similar to that which you propose to make. You have better models
to follow, and in any case what was lacking on the side of birth,
in these instances, was compensated by fortune. Without that
balance they would not have had the baseness and imprudence to
marry thus." Poor &Eacute;l&eacute;onore had no compensating
balance of that kind in her favour. She was only beautiful,
charming and sweet-natured. Therefore, "tut-tut, my son!"</p>
<p>In the course of the next few months Lap&eacute;rouse covered
himself with glory by his services on the <i>Amazon</i>, the
<i>Astr&egrave;e</i>, and the <i>Sceptre</i>, and he hoped that
these exploits would incline his father to accede to his ardent
wish. But no; the old gentleman was as hard as a rock. He
"tut-tutted" with as much vigour as ever. The lovers had to
wait.</p>
<p>Then his mother, full of love for her son and of pride in his
achievements, took a hand, and tried to arrange a more suitable
match for him. An old friend of the family, Madame de
V&eacute;sian had a marriageable daughter. She was rich and
beautiful, and her lineage was noble. She had never seen
Lap&eacute;rouse, and he had never seen her, but that was an
insignificant detail in France under the old Regime. If the
parents on each side thought the marriage suitable, that was
enough. The wishes of the younger people concerned were, it is
true, consulted before the betrothal, but it was often a
consultation merely in form, and under pressure. We should think
that way of making marriages most unsatisfactory; but then, a
French family of position in the old days would have thought our
freer system very shocking and loose. It is largely a matter of
usage; and that the old plan, which seems so faulty to us,
produced very many happy and lasting unions, there is much
delightful French family history to prove.</p>
<p>Lap&eacute;rouse had now been many months away from
Ile-de-France and the bright eyes of &Eacute;l&eacute;onore. He
was extremely fond of his mother, and anxious to meet her wishes.
Moreover, he held Madame de V&eacute;sian in high esteem, and
wrote that he "had always admired her, and felt sure that her
daughter resembled her". These influences swayed him, and he gave
way; but, being frank and honest by disposition, insisted that no
secret should be made of his affair of the heart with the lady
across the sea. He wrote to Madame de V&eacute;sian a candid
letter, in which he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Being extremely sensitive, I should be the most unfortunate
of men if I were not beloved by my wife, if I had not her
complete confidence, if her life amongst her friends and children
did not render her perfectly happy. I desire one day to regard
you as a mother, and to-day I open my heart to you as my best
friend. I authorise my mother to relate to you my old love
affair. My heart has always been a romance (<i>Mon coeur a
toujours &ecirc;t&eacute; un roman</i>); and the more I
sacrificed prudence to those whom I loved the happier I was. But
I cannot forget the respect that I owe to my parents and to their
wishes. I hope that in a little while I shall be free. If then I
have a favourable reply from you, and if I can make your daughter
happy and my character is approved, I shall fly to Albi and
embrace you a thousand times. I shall not distinguish you from my
mother and my sisters."</p>
<p>He also wrote to Monsieur de V&eacute;sian, begging him not to
interfere with the free inclinations of his daughter, and to
remember that "in order to be happy there must be no repugnance
to conquer. I have, however," he added, "an affair to terminate
which does not permit me to dispose of myself entirely. My mother
will tell you the details. I hope to be free in six weeks or two
months. My happiness will then be inexpressible if I obtain your
consent and that of Madame de V&eacute;sian, with the certainty
of not having opposed the wishes of Mademoiselle, your
daughter."</p>
<p>"I hope to be free"&mdash;did he "hope"? That was his polite
way of putting the matter. Or he may have believed that he had
conquered his love for &Eacute;l&eacute;onore Broudou, and that
she, as a French girl who understood his obligations to his
family, would&mdash;perhaps after making a few handkerchiefs damp
with her tears&mdash;acquiesce.</p>
<p>So the negotiations went on, and at length, in May, 1783, the
de V&eacute;sian family accepted Lap&eacute;rouse as the fiance
of their daughter. "My project is to live with my family and
yours," he wrote. "I hope that my wife will love my mother and my
sisters, as I feel that I shall love you and yours. Any other
manner of existence is frightful to me, and I have sufficient
knowledge of the world and of myself to know that I can only be
happy in living thus."</p>
<p>But in the very month that he wrote contracting
himself&mdash;that is precisely the word&mdash;to marry the girl
he had never seen, &Eacute;l&eacute;onore, the girl whom he had
seen, whom he had loved, and whom he still loved in his heart,
came to Paris with her parents. Lap&eacute;rouse saw her again.
He told her what had occurred. Of course she wept; what girl
would not? She said, between her sobs, that if it was to be all
over between them she would go into a convent. She could never
marry anyone else.</p>
<p>"Mon histoire est un roman", and here beginneth the new
chapter of this real love story. Why, we wonder, has not some
novelist discovered these Lap&eacute;rouse letters and founded a
tale upon them? Is it not a better story even told in bare
outline in these few pages, than nine-tenths of the concoctions
of the novelists, which are sold in thousands? Think of the
wooing of these two delightful people, the beautiful girl and the
gallant sailor, in the ocean isle, with its tropical perfumes and
colours, its superb mountain and valley scenery, bathed in
eternal sunshine by day and kissed by cool ocean breezes by
night&mdash;the isle of Paul and Virginia, the isle which to
Alexandre Dumas was the Paradise of the World, an enchanted oasis
of the ocean, "all carpeted with greenery and refreshed with
cooling streams, where, no matter what the season, you may gently
sink asleep beneath the shade of palms and jamrosades, soothed by
the babbling of a crystal spring."</p>
<p>Think of how he must have entertained and thrilled her with
accounts of his adventures: of storms, of fights with the
terrible English, of the chasing of corsairs and the battering of
the fleets of Indian princes. Think of her open-eyed wonder, and
of the awakening of love in her heart; and then of her dread,
lest after all, despite his consoling words and soft assurances,
he, the Comte, the officer, should be forbidden to marry her, the
maiden who had only her youth, her beauty, and her character, but
no rank, no fortune, to win favour from the proud people who did
not know her. The author is at all events certain of this: that
if the letters had seen the light before old Alexandre Dumas
died, he would have pounced upon them with glee, and would have
written around them a romance that all the world would have
rejoiced to read.</p>
<p>But while we think of what the novelists have missed, we are
neglecting the real story, the crisis of which we have now
reached.</p>
<p>Seeing &Eacute;l&eacute;onore again, his sensitive heart
deeply moved by her sorrow, Lap&eacute;rouse took a manly
resolution. He would marry her despite all obstacles. He had
promised her at her home in Ile-de-France. He would keep his
promise. He would not spoil her beautiful young life even for his
family.</p>
<p>But there was the contract concerning Mademoiselle de
V&eacute;sian. What of that? Clearly Lap&eacute;rouse was in a
fix. Well, a man who has been over twenty-five years at sea has
been in a fix many times, and learns that a bold face and tact
are good allies. Remembering the nature of his situation, it will
be agreed that the letter he wrote to his mother, announcing his
resolve, was a model of good taste and fine feeling:</p>
<p>"I have seen &Eacute;l&eacute;onore, and I have not been able
to resist the remorse by which I am devoured. My excessive
attachment to you had made me violate all that which is most
sacred among men. I forgot the vows of my heart, the cries of my
conscience. I was in Paris for twenty days, and, faithful to my
promise to you, I did not go to see her. But I received a letter
from her. She made no reproach against me, but the most profound
sentiment of sadness was expressed in it. At the instant of
reading it the veil fell from my eyes. My situation filled me
with horror. I am no better in my own eyes than a perjurer,
unworthy of Mademoiselle de V&eacute;sian, to whom I brought a
heart devoured by remorse and by a passion that nothing could
extinguish. I was equally unworthy of Mademoiselle Broudou, and
wished to leave her. My only excuse, my dear mother, is the
extreme desire I have always had to please you. It is for you
alone, and for my father, that I wished to marry. Desiring to
live with you for the remainder of my life, I consented to your
finding me a wife with whom I could abide. The choice of
Mademoiselle de V&eacute;sian had overwhelmed me, because her
mother is a woman for whom I have a true attachment; and Heaven
is my witness to-day that I should have preferred her daughter to
the most brilliant match in the universe. It is only four days
since I wrote to her on the subject. How can I reconcile my
letter with my present situation? But, my dear mother, it would
be feebleness in me to go further with the engagement. I have
doubtless been imprudent in contracting an engagement without
your consent, but I should be a monster if I violated my oaths
and married Mademoiselle de V&eacute;sian. I do not doubt that
you tremble at the abyss over which you fear that I am about to
fall, but I feel that I can only live with
&Eacute;l&eacute;onore, and I hope that you will give your
consent to our union. My fortune will suffice for our wants, and
we shall live near you. But I shall only come to Albi when
Mademoiselle de V&eacute;sian shall be married, and when I can be
sure that another, a thousand times more worthy than I am, shall
have sworn to her an attachment deeper than that which it was in
my power to offer. I shall write neither to Madame nor Monsieur
de V&eacute;sian. Join to your other kindnesses that of
undertaking this painful commission."</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the firm, if regretful tone, of that
letter; and Lap&eacute;rouse married his &Eacute;l&eacute;onore
at Paris.</p>
<p>Did Mademoiselle de V&eacute;sian break her heart because her
sailor fiance had wed another? Not at all! She at once became
engaged to the Baron de S&eacute;n&eacute;gas&mdash;had she seen
him beforehand, one wonders?&mdash;and married him in August!
Lap&eacute;rouse was prompt to write his congratulations to her
parents, and it is diverting to find him saying, concerning the
lady to whom he himself had been engaged only a few weeks before,
that he regretted "never having had the honour of seeing
her!"</p>
<p>But there was still another difficulty to be overcome before
Lap&eacute;rouse and his happy young bride could feel secure. He
had broken a regulation of the service by marrying without
official sanction. True, he had talked of settling down at Albi,
but that was when he thought he was going to marry a young lady
whom he did not know. Now he had married the girl of his heart;
and love, as a rule, does not stifle ambition. Rather are the two
mutually co-operative. &Eacute;l&eacute;onore had fallen in love
with him as a gallant sailor, and a sailor she wanted him still
to be. Perhaps, in her dreams, she saw him a great Admiral,
commanding powerful navies and winning glorious victories for
France. Madame la Comtesse did not wish her husband to end his
career because he had married her, be sure of that.</p>
<p>Here Lap&eacute;rouse did a wise and tactful thing, which
showed that he understood something of human nature. Nothing
interests old ladies so much as the love affairs of young people;
and old ladies in France at that time exercised remarkable
influence in affairs of government. The Minister of Marine was
the Marquis de Castries. Instead of making a clean breast of
matters to him, Lap&eacute;rouse wrote a long and delightful
letter to Madame la Marquise. "Madame," he said, "mon histoire
est un roman", and he begged her to read it. Of course she did.
What old lady would not? She was a very grand lady indeed, was
Madame la Marquise; but this officer who wrote his heart's story
to her, was a dashing hero. He told her how he had fallen in love
in Ile-de-France; how consent to his marriage had been officially
and paternally refused; how he had tried "to stifle the
sentiments which were nevertheless remaining at the bottom of my
heart". Would she intercede with the Minister for him and excuse
him?</p>
<p>Of course she would! She was a dear old lady, was Madame la
Marquise. Within a few days Lap&eacute;rouse received from the
Minister a most paternal, good natured letter, which assured him
that his romantic affair should not interfere with his prospects,
and concluded: "Enjoy the pleasure of having made someone happy,
and the marks of honour and distinction that you have received
from your fellow citizens."</p>
<p>Such is the love story of Lap&eacute;rouse. Alas! the marriage
did not bring many years of happiness to poor
&Eacute;l&eacute;onore, much as she deserved them. Two years
afterwards, her hero sailed away on that expedition from which he
never returned. She dwelt at Albi, hoping until hope gave way to
despair, and at last she died, of sheer grief they said, nine
years after the waters of the Pacific had closed over him who had
wooed her and wedded her for herself alone.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><b>THE VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION.</b></p>
<br>
<p>KING LOUIS XVI of France was as unfortunate a monarch as was
ever born to a throne. Had it been his happier lot to be the son
of a farmer, a shopkeeper, or a merchant, he would have passed
for an excellent man of business and a good, solid, sober,
intelligent citizen. But he inherited with his crown a system of
government too antiquated for the times, too repressive for the
popular temper to endure, and was not statesman enough to remodel
it to suit the requirements of his people. It was not his fault
that he was not a great man; and a great man&mdash;a man of large
grasp, wide vision, keen sympathies, and penetrating
imagination&mdash;was needed in France if the social forces at
work, the result of new ideas fermenting in the minds of men and
impelling them, were to be directed towards wise and wholesome
reform. Failing such direction, those forces burst through the
restraints of law, custom, authority, loyalty and respect, and
produced the most startling upheaval in modern history, the Great
French Revolution. Louis lost both his crown and his head, the
whole system of government was overturned, and the way was left
open for the masterful mind and strong arm needed to restore
discipline and order to the nation: Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>Louis was very fond of literature. During the sad last months
of his imprisonment, before the guillotine took his life, he read
over 230 volumes. He especially liked books of travel and
geography, and one of his favourite works was the <i>Voyages</i>
of Cook. He had the volumes near him in the last phase of his
existence. There is a pleasant drawing representing the King in
his prison, with the little Dauphin seated on his knee, pointing
out the countries and oceans on a large geographical globe; and
he took a pride in having had prepared "for the education of
Monsieur le Dauphin", a History of the Exploration of the South
Seas. It was published in Paris, in three small volumes, in
1791.</p>
<p>The study of Cook made a deep impression on the King's mind.
Why, he asked himself, should not France share in the glory of
discovering new lands, and penetrating untraversed seas? There
was a large amount of exploratory work still to be done. English
navigators were always busy sailing to unknown parts, but the
entire world was by no means revealed yet. There were,
particularly, big blank spaces at the bottom of the globe. That
country called by the Dutch New Holland, the eastern part of
which Cook had found&mdash;there was evidently much to be done
there. What were the southern coasts like? Was it one big
island-continent, or was it divided into two by a strait running
south from the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria? Then there was
that piece of country discovered by the Dutchman Tasman, and
named Van Diemen's Land. Was it an island, or did it join on to
New Holland? There were also many islands of the Pacific still to
be explored and correctly charted, the map of Eastern Asia was
imperfect, and the whole of the coastline of North-Western
America was not accurately known.</p>
<p>The more Louis turned the matter over in his mind, the more he
studied his globes, maps and books of voyages, the more convinced
he was that France, as a maritime nation and a naval Power, ought
to play an important part in this grand work of unveiling to
mankind the full extent, form, nature and resources of our
planet.</p>
<p>He sent for a man whose name the Australian reader should
particularly note, because he had much to do with three important
discovery voyages affecting our history. Charles Claret, Comte de
Fleurieu, was the principal geographer in France. He was at this
time director of ports and arsenals. He had throughout his life
been a keen student of navigation, was a practical sailor,
invented a marine chronometer which was a great improvement on
clocks hitherto existing, devised a method of applying the metric
system to the construction of marine charts, and wrote several
works on his favourite subject. A large book of his on
discoveries in Papua and the Solomon Islands is still of much
importance.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image4" id="Image4"></a><img alt=""
src="e00078-images/Image4.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Comte de Fleurieu</b></p>
<br>
<p>As a French writer&mdash;an expert in this field of
knowledge&mdash;has written of Fleurieu, "he it was who prepared
nearly all the plans for naval operations during the war of 1778,
and the instructions for the voyages of discovery&mdash;those of
Lap&eacute;rouse and Dentrecasteaux&mdash;for which Louis XVI had
given general directions; and to whose wise and well-informed
advice is due in large part the utility derived from them." It
was chiefly because of Fleurieu's knowledge of geography that the
King chose him to be the tutor of the Dauphin; and in 1790 he
became Minister of Marine.</p>
<p>Louis XVI and Fleurieu talked the subject over together; and
the latter, at the King's command, drew up a long memorandum
indicating the parts of the globe where an expedition of
discovery might most profitably apply itself.</p>
<p>The King decided (1785) that a voyage should be undertaken;
two ships of the navy, <i>la Boussole</i> and <i>l'Astrolabe</i>,
were selected for the purpose; and, on the recommendation of the
Marquis de Castries&mdash;remember Madame la
Marquise!&mdash;Lap&eacute;rouse was chosen for the command.</p>
<p>All three of the men who ordered, planned and executed the
voyage, the King, the scholar, and the officer, were devoted
students of the work and writings of Cook; and copies of his
<i>Voyages</i>, in French and English, were placed in the library
of navigation carried on board the ships for the edification of
the officers and crews. Over and over again in the instructions
prepared&mdash;several times on a page in some
places&mdash;appear references to what Cook had done, and to what
Cook had left to be done; showing that both King Louis and
Fleurieu knew his voyages and charts, not merely as casual
readers, but intimately. As for Lap&eacute;rouse himself, his
admiration of Cook has already been mentioned; here it may be
added that when, before he sailed, Sir Joseph Banks presented him
with two magnetic needles that had been used by Cook, he wrote
that he "received them with feelings bordering almost upon
religious veneration for the memory of that great and
incomparable navigator". So that, we see, the extent of our great
sailor's influence is not to be measured even by his discoveries
and the effect of his writings upon his own countrymen. He
radiated a magnetic force which penetrated far; down to our own
day it has by no means lost its stimulating energy.</p>
<p>In the picture gallery at the Palace of Versailles, there is
an oil painting by Mansiau, a copy of which may be seen in the
Mitchell Library, Sydney. It is called "Louis XVI giving
instructions to Monsieur de Lap&eacute;rouse for his voyage
around the world." An Australian statesman who saw it during a
visit to Paris a few years ago, confessed publicly on his return
to his own country that he gazed long upon it, and recognised it
as being "of the deepest interest to Australians". So indeed it
is. A photograph of the picture is given here.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image5" id="Image5"></a><img alt=""
src="e00078-images/Image5.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Louis XVI Giving Instructions to Lap&eacute;rouse</b></p>
<br>
<p>The instructions were of course prepared by Fleurieu: anyone
familiar with his writings can see plenty of internal evidence of
that. But Louis was not a little vain of his own geographical
knowledge, and he gave a special audience to Lap&eacute;rouse,
explaining the instructions verbally before handing them to him
in writing.</p>
<p>They are admirably clear instructions, indicating a full
knowledge of the work of preceding navigators and of the parts of
the earth where discovery needed to be pursued. Their defect was
that they expected too much to be done on one voyage. Let us
glance over them, devoting particular attention to the portions
affecting Australasia.</p>
<p>The ships were directed to sail across the Atlantic and round
Cape Horn, visiting certain specified places on the way. In the
Pacific they were to visit Easter Island, Tahiti, the Society
Islands, the Friendly and Navigator groups, and New Caledonia.
"He will pass Endeavour Strait and in this passage will try to
ascertain whether the land of Louisiade (the Louisiade
Archipelago), be contiguous to that of New Guinea, and will
reconnoitre all this part of the coast from Cape Deliverance to
the Island of St. Barthelomew, east-northeast of Cape Walsh, of
which at present we have a very imperfect knowledge. It is much
to be wished that he may be able to examine the Gulf of
Carpentaria."</p>
<p>He was then to explore the western shores of New Holland. "He
will run down the western coast and take a closer view of the
southern, the greater part of which has never been visited,
finishing his survey at Van Diemen's Land, at Adventure Bay or
Prince Frederick Henry's, whence he will make sail for Cook's
Strait, and anchor in Queen Charlotte's Sound, in that Strait,
between the two islands which constitute New Zealand."</p>
<p>That direction is especially important, because if
Lap&eacute;rouse had not perished, but had lived to carry out his
programme, it is evident that he would have forestalled the later
discoveries of Bass and Flinders in southern Australia. What a
vast difference to the later course of history that might have
made!</p>
<p>After leaving New Zealand he was to cross the Pacific to the
north-west coast of America. The programme included explorations
in the China Sea, at the Philippines, the Moluccas and Timor, and
contemplated a return to France in July or August, 1789, after a
voyage of about three years.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image6" id="Image6"></a><img alt=""
src="e00078-images/Image6.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Australia as known at the time of Lap&eacute;rouse's
visit</b></p>
<br>
<p>But although his course was mapped out in such detail,
discretion was left to Lap&eacute;rouse to vary it if he thought
fit. "All the calculations of which a sketch is given here must
be governed by the circumstances of the voyage, the condition of
the crews, ships and provisions, the events that may occur in the
expedition and accidents which it is impossible to foresee. His
Majesty, therefore, relying on the experience and judgment of the
sieur de Lap&eacute;rouse, authorises him to make any deviation
that he may deem necessary, in unforeseen cases, pursuing,
however, as far as possible, the plan traced out, and conforming
to the directions given in the other parts of the present
instructions."</p>
<p>A separate set of instructions had regard to observations to
be made by Lap&eacute;rouse upon the political conditions,
possibilities of commerce, and suitability for settlement, of the
lands visited by him. In the Pacific, he was to inquire "whether
the cattle, fowls, and other animals which Captain Cook left on
some of the islands have bred". He was to examine attentively
"the north and west coasts of New Holland, and particularly that
part of the coast which, being situated in the torrid zone, may
enjoy some of the productions peculiar to countries in similar
latitudes." In New Zealand he was to ascertain "whether the
English have formed or entertain the project of forming any
settlement on these islands; and if he should hear that they have
actually formed a settlement, he will endeavour to repair thither
in order to learn the condition, strength and object of the
settlement."</p>
<p>It is singular that the instructions contain no reference to
Botany Bay. It was the visit paid by Lap&eacute;rouse to this
port that brought him into touch with Australian history. Yet his
call there was made purely in the exercise of his discretion. He
was not directed to pay any attention to eastern Australia. When
he sailed the French Government knew nothing of the contemplated
settlement of New South Wales by the British; and he only heard
of it in the course of his voyage. Indeed, it is amazing how
little was known of Australia at the time. "We have nothing
authentic or sufficiently minute respecting this part of the
largest island on the globe", said the instructions concerning
the northern and western coasts; but there was not a word about
the eastern shores.</p>
<p>The reader who reflects upon the facts set forth in this
chapter will realise that the French Revolution, surprising as
the statement may seem, affected Australian history in a
remarkable way. If Louis XVI had not been dethroned and beheaded,
but had remained King of France, there cannot be any doubt that
he would have persisted in the investigation of the South Seas.
He was deeply interested in the subject, very well informed about
it, and ambitious that his country should be a great maritime and
colonising Power. But the Revolution slew Louis, plunged France
in long and disastrous wars, and brought Napoleon to the front.
The whole course of history was diverted. It was as if a great
river had been turned into a fresh channel.</p>
<p>If the navigator of the French King had discovered southern
Australia, and settlement had followed, it is not to be supposed
that Great Britain would have opposed the plans of France; for
Australia then was not the Australia that we know, and England
had very little use even for the bit she secured. Unthinking
people might suppose that the French Revolution meant very little
to us. Indeed, unthinking people are very apt to suppose that we
can go our own way without regarding what takes place elsewhere.
They do not realise that the world is one, and that the policies
of nations interact upon each other. In point of fact, the
Revolution meant a great deal to Australia. This country is,
indeed, an island far from Europe, but the threads of her history
are entwined with those of European history in a very curious and
often intricate fashion. The French Revolution and the era of
Napoleon, if we understand their consequences, really concern us
quite as much as, say, the gold discoveries and the
accomplishment of Federation.</p>

<p align="center"><b>THE EARLY PART OF THE VOYAGE.</b></p>
<br>
<p>THE expedition sailed from Brest rather sooner than had at
first been contemplated, on August 1, 1785, and doubled Cape Horn
in January of the following year. Some weeks were spent on the
coast of Chili; and the remarks of Lap&eacute;rouse concerning
the manners of the Spanish rulers of the country cover some of
his most entertaining pages. He has an eye for the picturesque, a
kindly feeling for all well-disposed people, a pleasant touch in
describing customs, and shrewd judgment in estimating character.
These qualities make him an agreeable writer of travels. They are
fairly illustrated by the passages in which he describes the
people of the city of Concepcion. Take his account of the
ladies:</p>
<p>"The dress of these ladies, extremely different from what we
have been accustomed to see, consists of a plaited petticoat,
tied considerably below the waist; stockings striped red, blue
and white; and shoes so short that the toes are bent under the
ball of the foot so as to make it appear nearly round. Their hair
is without powder and is divided into small braids behind,
hanging over the shoulders. Their bodice is generally of gold or
silver stuff, over which there are two short cloaks, that
underneath of muslin and the other of wool of different colours,
blue, yellow and pink. The upper one is drawn over the head when
they are in the streets and the weather is cold; but within doors
it is usual to place it on their knees; and there is a game
played with the muslin cloak by continually shifting it about, in
which the ladies of Concepcion display considerable grace. They
are for the most part handsome, and of so polite and pleasing
manners that there is certainly no maritime town in Europe where
strangers are received with so much attention and kindness."</p>
<p>At this city Lap&eacute;rouse met the adventurous Irishman,
Ambrose O'Higgins, who by reason of his conspicuous military
abilities became commander of the Spanish forces in Chili, and
afterwards Viceroy of Peru. His name originally was simply
Higgins, but he prefixed the "O" when he blossomed into a Spanish
Don, "as being more aristocratic". He was the father of the still
more famous Bernardo O'Higgins, "the Washington of Chili", who
led the revolt against Spanish rule and became first president of
the Chilian Republic in 1818. Lap&eacute;rouse at once conceived
an attachment for O'Higgins, "a man of extraordinary activity",
and one "adored in the country".</p>
<p>In April, 1786, the expedition was at Easter Island, where the
inhabitants appeared to be a set of cunning and hypocritical
thieves, who "robbed us of everything which it was possible for
them to carry off." Steering north, the Sandwich Islands were
reached early in May. Here Lap&eacute;rouse liked the people,
"though my prejudices were strong against them on account of the
death of Captain Cook." A passage in the commander's narrative
gives his opinion on the annexation of the countries of native
races by Europeans, and shows that, in common with very many of
his countrymen, he was much influenced by the ideas of Rousseau,
then an intellectual force in France&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image14" id="Image14"></a><img alt=""
src="e00078-images/Image14.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>The <i>Boussole</i> and <i>Astrolabe</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>"Though the French were the first who, in modern times, had
landed on the island of Mowee, I did not think it my duty to take
possession in the name of the King. The customs of Europeans on
such occasions are completely ridiculous. Philosophers must
lament to see that men, for no better reason than because they
are in possession of firearms and bayonets, should have no regard
for the rights of sixty thousand of their fellow creatures, and
should consider as an object of conquest a land fertilised by the
painful exertions of its inhabitants, and for many ages the tomb
of their ancestors. These islands have fortunately been
discovered at a period when religion no longer serves as a
pretext for violence and rapine. Modern navigators have no other
object in describing the manners of remote nations than that of
completing the history of man; and the knowledge they endeavour
to diffuse has for its sole aim to render the people they visit
more happy, and to augment their means of subsistence."</p>
<p>If Lap&eacute;rouse could see the map of the Pacific to-day he
would find its groups of islands all enclosed within coloured
rings, indicating possession by the great Powers of the world. He
would be puzzled and pained by the change. But the history of the
political movements leading to the parcelling out of seas and
lands among strong States would interest him, and he would
realise that the day of feeble isolation has gone. Nothing would
make him marvel more than the floating of the Stars and Stripes
over Hawaii, for he knew that flag during the American War of
Independence. It was adopted as the flag of the United States in
1777, and during the campaign the golden lilies of the standard
of France fluttered from many masts in co-operation with it.
Truly a century and a quarter has brought about a wonderful
change, not only in the face of the globe and in the management
of its affairs, but still more radically in the ideas of men and
in the motives that sway their activities!</p>

<br>
<b>Chart of Lap&eacute;rouse's Voyage in the Pacific</b></p>
<br>
<p>The geographical work done by Lap&eacute;rouse in this part of
the Pacific was of much importance. It removed from the chart
five or six islands which had no existence, having been marked
down erroneously by previous navigators. From this region the
expedition sailed to Alaska, on the north-west coast of North
America. Cook had explored here "with that courage and
perseverance of which all Europe knows him to have been capable",
wrote Lap&eacute;rouse, never failing to use an opportunity of
expressing admiration for his illustrious predecessor. But there
was still useful work to do, and the French occupied their time
very profitably with it from June to August. Then their ships
sailed down the western coast of America to California, struck
east across the Pacific to the Ladrones, and made for Macao in
China&mdash;then as now a Portuguese possession&mdash;reaching
that port in January, 1787.</p>
<p>The Philippines were next visited, and Lap&eacute;rouse formed
pleasant impressions of Manilla. It is clear from his way of
alluding to the customs of the Spanish inhabitants that the
French captain was not a tobacco smoker. It was surprising to him
that "their passion for smoking this narcotic is so immoderate
that there is not an instant of the day in which either a man or
woman is without a cigar;" and it is equally surprising to us
that the French editor of the history of the voyage found it
necessary to explain in a footnote that a cigar is "a small roll
of tobacco which is smoked without the assistance of a pipe." But
cigars were then little known in Europe, except among sailors and
travellers who had visited the Spanish colonies; and the very
spelling of the word was not fixed. In English voyages it appears
as "seegar", "segar", and "sagar."</p>
<p>Formosa was visited in April, northern Japan in May, and the
investigation of the north-eastern coasts of Asia occupied until
October.</p>
<p>A passage in a letter from Lap&eacute;rouse to Fleurieu is
worth quoting for two reasons. It throws some light on the
difficulties of navigation in unknown seas, and upon the
commander's severe application to duty; and it also serves to
remind us that Japan, now so potent a factor in the politics of
the East and of the whole Pacific, had not then emerged from the
barbarian exclusiveness towards foreigners, which she had
maintained since Europe commenced to exploit Asia. In the middle
of the seventeenth century she had expelled the Spaniards and the
Portuguese with much bloodshed, and had closed her ports to all
traders except the Chinese and the Dutch, who were confined to a
prescribed area at Nagasaki. Intercourse with all other foreign
peoples was strictly forbidden. Even as late as 1842 it was
commanded that if any foreign vessel were driven by distress or
tempestuous weather into a Japanese port, she might only remain
so long as was necessary to meet her wants, and must then depart.
Lap&eacute;rouse knew of this jealous Japanese antipathy to
foreign visitors, and, as he explains in the letter, meant to
keep away from the country because of it. He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The part of our voyage between Manilla and Kamchatka will
afford you, I hope, complete satisfaction. It was the newest, the
most interesting, and certainly, from the everlasting fogs which
enveloped the land in the latitudes we traversed, the most
difficult. These fogs are such that it has taken one hundred and
fifty days to explore a part of the coast which Captain King, in
the third volume of Cook's last voyage, supposes might be
examined in the course of two months. During this period I rested
only ten days, three in the Bay of Ternai, two in the Bay de
Langle, and five in the Bay de Castries. Thus I wasted no time; I
even forebore to circumnavigate the island of Chicha (Yezo) by
traversing the Strait of Sangaar (Tsugaru). I should have wished
to anchor, if possible, at the northern point of Japan, and would
perhaps have ventured to send a boat ashore, though such a
proceeding would have required the most serious deliberation, as
the boat would probably have been stopped. Where a merchant ship
is concerned an event of this kind might be considered as of
little importance, but the seizure of a boat belonging to a ship
of war could scarcely be otherwise regarded than as a national
insult; and the taking and burning of a few sampans would be a
very sorry compensation as against the people who would not
exchange a single European of whom they were desirous of making
an example, for one hundred Japanese. I was, however, too far
from the coast to include such an intention, and it is impossible
for me to judge at present what I should have done had the
contrary been the case.</p>
<p>"It would be difficult for me to find words to express to you
the fatigue attending this part of my voyage, during which I did
not once undress myself, nor did a single night pass without my
being obliged to spend several hours upon deck. Imagine to
yourself six days of fog with only two or three hours of clear
weather, in seas extremely confined, absolutely unknown, and
where fancy, in consequence of the information we had received,
pictured to us shoals and currents that did not always exist.
From the place where we made the land on the eastern coast of
Tartary, to the strait which we discovered between Tchoka
(Saghalien) and Chicha, we did not fail to take the bearing of
every point, and you may rest assured that neither creek, port,
nor river escaped our attention, and that many charts, even of
the coasts of Europe, are less exact than those which we shall
bring with us on our return."</p>
<p>"The strait which we discovered" is still called
Lap&eacute;rouse Strait on most modern maps, though the Japanese
usually call it Soya Strait. It runs between Yezo, the large
northerly island of Japan, and Saghalien. Current maps also show
the name Boussole Strait, after Lap&eacute;rouse's ship, between
Urup and Simusir, two of the Kurile chain of small islands
curving from Yezo to the thumb-like extremity of Kamchatka.</p>
<p>At Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka the drawings of the artists and
the journals of the commander up to date were packed up, and sent
to France overland across Asiatic Russia, in charge of a young
member of the staff, J. B. B. de Lesseps. He was the only one of
the expedition who ever returned to Europe. By not coming to
Australia he saved his life. He published a book about his
journey, a remarkable feat of land travel in those days. He was
the uncle of a man whose remarkable engineering work has made
Australia's relations with Europe much easier and more speedy
than they were in earlier years: that Ferdinand de Lesseps who
(1859-69) planned and carried out the construction of the Suez
Canal.</p>
<p>The ships, after replenishing, sailed for the south Pacific,
where we shall follow the proceedings of Lap&eacute;rouse in
rather closer detail than has been considered necessary in regard
to the American and Asiatic phases of the voyage.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>Chapter VI.</h3>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>LAP&Eacute;ROUSE IN THE PACIFIC.</b></p>
<br>
<p>ON the 6th December, 1787, the expedition made the eastern end
of the Navigator Islands, that is, the Samoan Group. As the ships
approached, a party of natives were observed squatting under
cocoanut trees. Presently sixteen canoes put off from the land,
and their occupants, after paddling round the vessels
distrustfully, ventured to approach and proffer cocoanuts in
exchange for strings of beads and strips of red cloth. The
natives got the better of the bargain, for, when they had
received their price, they hurried off without delivering their
own goods. Further on, an old chief delivered an harangue from
the shore, holding a branch of Kava in his hand. "We knew from
what we had read of several voyages that it was a token of peace;
and throwing him some pieces of cloth we answered by the word
'<i>Tayo</i>', which signified 'friend' in the dialect of the
South Sea Islands; but we were not sufficiently experienced to
understand and pronounce distinctly the words of the vocabularies
we had extracted from Cook."</p>
<p>Nearly all the early navigators made a feature of compiling
vocabularies of native words, and Cook devoted particular care to
this task. Dr. Walter Roth, formerly protector of Queensland
aboriginals a trained observer, has borne testimony as recently
as last year (in <i>The Times</i>, December 29, 1911) that a list
of words collected from Endeavour Strait blacks, and "given by
Captain Cook, are all more or less recognisable at the present
day." But Cook's spellings were intended to be pronounced in the
English mode. Lap&eacute;rouse and his companions by giving the
vowels French values would hardly be likely to make the English
navigator's vocabularies intelligible.</p>
<p>The native canoes amused the French captain. They "could be of
use only to people who are expert swimmers, for they are
constantly turned over. This is an accident, however, at which
they feel less surprise and anxiety than we should at a hat's
blowing off. They lift the canoe on their shoulders, and after
they have emptied it of the water, get into it again, well
assured that they will have the same operation to perform within
half an hour, for it is as difficult to preserve a balance in
these ticklish things as to dance upon a rope."</p>
<p>At Man&uuml;a Island (now called Tutuila) some successful
bargaining was done with glass beads in exchange for pork and
fruits. It surprised Lap&eacute;rouse that the natives chose
these paltry ornaments rather than hatchets and tools. "They
preferred a few beads which could be of no utility, to anything
we could offer them in iron or cloth."</p>
<p>Two days later a tragedy occurred at this island, when Captain
de Langle, the commander of the <i>Astrolabe</i>, and eleven of
the crew were murdered. He made an excursion inland to look for
fresh water, and found a clear, cool spring in the vicinity of a
village. The ships were not urgently in need of water, but de
Langle "had embraced the system of Cook, and thought fresh water
a hundred times preferable to what had been some time in the
hold. As some of his crew had slight symptoms of scurvy, he
thought, with justice, that we owed them every means of
alleviation in our power. Besides, no island could be compared
with this for abundance of provisions. The two ships had already
procured upwards of 500 hogs, with a large quantity of fowls,
pigeons and fruits; and all these had cost us only a few
beads."</p>
<p>Lap&eacute;rouse himself doubted the prudence of sending a
party inland, as he had observed signs of a turbulent spirit
among the islanders. But de Langle insisted on the desirableness
of obtaining fresh water where it was abundant, and "replied to
me that my refusal would render me responsible for the progress
of the scurvy, which began to appear with some violence." He
undertook to go at the head of the party, and, relying on his
judgment, the commander consented.</p>
<p>Two boats left the ship at about noon, and landed their casks
undisturbed. But when the party returned they found a crowd of
over a thousand natives assembled, and a dangerous disposition
soon revealed itself amongst them. It is possible that the
Frenchmen had, unconsciously, offended against some of their
superstitious rites. Certainly they had not knowingly been
provoked. They had peacefully bartered their fruits and nuts for
beads, and had been treated in a friendly fashion throughout. But
the currents of passion that sweep through the minds of savage
peoples baffle analysis. Something had disturbed them; what it
was can hardly be surmised. One of the officers believed that the
gift of some beads to a few, excited the envy of the others. It
may be so; mere envy plays such a large part in the affairs even
of civilised peoples, that we need not wonder to find it arousing
the anger of savages. Lap&eacute;rouse tells what occurred in
these terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Several canoes, after having sold their ladings of provisions
on board our ships, had returned ashore, and all landed in this
bay, so that it was gradually filled. Instead of two hundred
persons, including women and children, whom M. de Langle found
when he arrived at half past one, there were ten or twelve
hundred by three o'clock. He succeeded in embarking his water;
but the bay was by this time nearly dry, and he could not hope to
get his boats afloat before four o'clock, when the tide would
have risen. He stepped into them, however, with his detachment,
and posted himself in the bow, with his musket and his marines,
forbidding them to fire unless he gave orders.</p>
<p>"This, he began to realise, he would soon be forced to do.
Stones flew about, and the natives, only up to the knees in
water, surrounded the boats within less than three yards. The
marines who were in the boats, attempted in vain to keep them
off. If the fear of commencing hostilities and being accused of
barbarity had not checked M. de Langle, he would unquestionably
have ordered a general discharge of his swivels and musketry,
which no doubt would have dispersed the mob, but he flattered
himself that he could check them without shedding blood, and he
fell a victim to his humanity.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image8" id="Image8"></a><img alt=""
src="e00078-images/Image8.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Massacre of Captain de Langle's Party</b></p>
<br>
<p>"Presently a shower of stones thrown from a short distance
with as much force as if they had come from a sling, struck
almost every man in the boat. M. de Langle had only time to
discharge the two barrels of his piece before he was knocked
down; and unfortunately he fell over the larboard bow of the
boat, where upwards of two hundred natives instantly massacred
him with clubs and stones. When he was dead, they made him fast
by the arm to one of the tholes of the long boat, no doubt to
secure his spoil. The <i>Boussole</i>'s long-boat, commanded by
M. Boutin, was aground within four yards of the
<i>Astrolabe</i>'s, and parallel with her, so as to leave a
little channel between them, which was unoccupied by the natives.
Through this all the wounded men, who were so fortunate as not to
fall on the other side of the boats, escaped by swimming to the
barges, which, happily remaining afloat, were enabled to save
forty-nine men out of the sixty-one."</p>
<p>Amongst the wounded was P&egrave;re Receveur, priest,
naturalist and shoemaker, who later on died of his injuries at
Botany Bay, and whose tomb there is as familiar as the
Lap&eacute;rouse monument.</p>
<p>The anger of the Frenchmen at the treachery of the islanders
was not less than their grief at the loss of their companions.
Lap&eacute;rouse, on the first impulse, was inclined to send a
strongly-armed party ashore to avenge the massacre. But two of
the officers who had escaped pointed out that in the cove where
the incident occurred the trees came down almost to the sea,
affording shelter to the natives, who would be able to shower
stones upon the party, whilst themselves remaining beyond reach
of musket balls.</p>
<p>"It was not without difficulty", he wrote, "that I could tear
myself away from this fatal place, and leave behind the bodies of
our murdered companions. I had lost an old friend; a man of great
understanding, judgment, and knowledge; and one of the best
officers in the French navy. His humanity had occasioned his
death. Had he but allowed himself to fire on the first natives
who entered into the water to surround the boats, he would have
prevented his own death as well as those of eleven other victims
of savage ferocity. Twenty persons more were severely wounded;
and this event deprived us for the time of thirty men, and the
only two boats we had large enough to carry a sufficient number
of men, armed, to attempt a descent. These considerations
determined my subsequent conduct. The slightest loss would have
compelled me to burn one of my ships in order to man the other.
If my anger had required only the death of a few natives, I had
had an opportunity after the massacre of sinking and destroying a
hundred canoes containing upwards of five hundred persons, but I
was afraid of being mistaken in my victims, and the voice of my
conscience saved their lives."</p>
<p>It was then that Lap&eacute;rouse resolved to sail to Botany
Bay, of which he had read a description in Cook's Voyages. His
long-boats had been destroyed by the natives, but he had on board
the frames of two new ones, and a safe anchorage was required
where they could be put together. His crews were exasperated; and
lest there should be a collision between them and other natives
he resolved that, while reconnoitring other groups of islands to
determine their correct latitude, he would not permit his sailors
to land till he reached Botany Bay. There he knew that he could
obtain wood and water.</p>
<p>On December 14 Oyolava (now called Upolu) was reached. Here
again the ships were surrounded by canoes, and the angry French
sailors would have fired upon them except for the positive orders
of their commander. Throughout this unfortunate affair the strict
sense of justice, which forbade taking general vengeance for the
misdeeds of particular people, stands out strongly in the conduct
of Lap&eacute;rouse. He acknowledged in letters written from
Botany Bay, that in future relations with uncivilised folk he
would adopt more repressive measures, as experience taught him
that lack of firm handling was by them regarded as weakness. But
his tone in all his writings is humane and kindly.</p>
<p>The speculations of Lap&eacute;rouse concerning the origin of
these peoples, are interesting, and deserve consideration by
those who speak and write upon the South Seas. He was convinced
that they are all derived from an ancient common stock, and that
the race of woolly-haired men to be found in the interior of
Formosa were the far-off parents of the natives of the
Philippines, Papua, New Britain, the New Hebrides, the Friendly
Islands, the Carolines, Ladrones, and Sandwich Groups. He
believed that in those islands the interior of which did not
afford complete shelter the original inhabitants were conquered
by Malays, after which aboriginals and invaders mingled together,
producing modifications of the original types. But in Papua, the
Solomons and the New Hebrides, the Malays made little impression.
He accounted for differences in appearance amongst the people of
the islands he visited by the different degrees of Malay
intermixture, and believed that the very black people found on
some islands, "whose complexion still remains a few shades deeper
than that of certain families in the same islands" were to be
accounted for by certain families making it "a point of honour
not to contaminate their blood." The theory is at all events
striking. We have a "White Australia policy" on the mainland
to-day; this speculation assumes a kind of "Black Australasia
policy" on the part of certain families of islanders from time
immemorial.</p>
<p>The Friendly Islands were reached in December, but the
commander had few and unimportant relations with them. On the
13th January, 1788, the ships made for Norfolk Island, and came
to anchor opposite the place where Cook was believed to have
landed. The sea was running high at the time, breaking violently
on the rocky shores of the north east. The naturalists desired to
land to collect specimens, but the heavy breakers prevented them.
The commander permitted them to coast along the shore in boats
for about half a league but then recalled them.</p>
<p>"Had it been possible to land, there was no way of getting
into the interior part of the island but by ascending for thirty
or forty yards the rapid stream of some torrents, which had
formed gullies. Beyond these natural barriers the island was
covered with pines and carpeted with the most beautiful verdure.
It is probable that we should then have met with some culinary
vegetables, and this hope increased our desire of visiting a land
where Captain Cook had landed with the greatest facility. He, it
is true, was here in fine weather, that had continued for several
days; whilst we had been sailing in such heavy seas that for
eight day, our ports had been shut and our dead-lights in. From
the ship I watched the motions of the boats with my glass; and
seeing, as night approached, that they had found no convenient
place for landing, I made the signal to recall them, and soon
after gave orders for getting under way. Perhaps I should have
lost much time had I waited for a more favourable opportunity:
and the exploring of this island was not worth such a
sacrifice."</p>
<p>At eight in the evening the ships got under way, and at
day-break on the following morning sail was crowded for Botany
Bay.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>Chapter VII.</h3>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>AT BOTANY BAY.</b></p>
<br>
<p>WHEN, in 1787, the British Government entrusted Captain Arthur
Phillip with a commission to establish a colony at Botany Bay,
New South Wales, they gave him explicit directions as to where he
should locate the settlement. "According to the best information
which we have obtained," his instructions read, "Botany Bay
appears to be the most eligible situation upon the said coast for
the first establishment, possessing a commodious harbour and
other advantages which no part of the said coast hitherto
discovered affords." But Phillip was a trustworthy man who, in so
serious a matter as the choice of a site for a town, did not
follow blindly the commands of respectable elderly gentlemen
thousands of miles away. It was his business to found a
settlement successfully. To do that he must select the best
site.</p>
<p>After examining Botany Bay, he decided to take a trip up the
coast and see if a better situation could not be found. On the
21st January, 1788, he entered Port Jackson with three boats, and
found there "the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand
sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security." He fixed
upon a cove "which I honoured with the name of Sydney." and
decided that that was there he would "plant." Every writer of
mediaeval history who has had occasion to refer to the choice by
Constantine the Great of Byzantium, afterwards Constantinople, as
his capital, has extolled his judgment and prescience.
Constantine was an Emperor, and could do as he would. Arthur
Phillip was an official acting under orders. We can never
sufficiently admire the wisdom he displayed when, exercising his
own discretion, he decided upon Port Jackson. True, he had a
great opportunity, but his signal merit is that he grasped it
when it was presented, that he gave more regard to the success of
his task than to the letter of his instructions.</p>
<p>While he was making the search, the eleven vessels composing
the First Fleet lay in Botany Bay. He returned on the evening of
the 23rd, and immediately gave orders that the whole company
should as soon as possible sail for Port Jackson, declaring it to
be, in King's quaint words, "a very proper place to form an
establisht. in."</p>
<p>To the great astonishment of the Fleet, on the 24th, two
strange ships made their appearance to the south of Solander
Point, a projection from the peninsula on which now stands the
obelisk in memory of Cook's landing. What could they be? Some
guessed that they were English vessels with additional stores.
Some supposed that they were Dutch, "coming after us to oppose
our landing." Nobody expected to see any ships in these
untraversed waters, and we can easily picture the amazement of
officers, crews, and convicts when the white sails appeared. The
more timid speculated on the possibility of attack, and there
were "temporary apprehensions, accompanied by a multiplicity of
conjectures, many of them sufficiently ridiculous."</p>
<p>Phillip, however, remembered hearing that the French had an
expedition of discovery either in progress or contemplation. He
was the first to form a right opinion about them, but, wishing to
be certain, sent the <i>Supply</i> out of the bay to get a nearer
view and hoist the British colours. Lieutenant Ball, in command
of that brig, after reconnoitring, reported that the ships were
certainly not English. They were either French, Spanish or
Portuguese. He could distinctly see the white field of the flag
they flew, "but they were at too great a distance to discover if
there was anything else on it." The flag, of course, showed the
golden lilies of France on a white ground. One of the ships, King
records, "wore a <i>chef d'escadre's</i> pennant", that is, a
commodore's.</p>
<p>This information satisfied Phillip, who was anxious to lose no
time in getting his people ashore at Sydney Cove. He, therefore,
determined to sail in the <i>Supply</i> on the 25th, to make
preliminary arrangements, leaving Captain Hunter of the
<i>Sirius</i> to convoy the Fleet round as soon as possible. The
wind, just then, was blowing too strong for them to work out of
the Bay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lap&eacute;rouse, with the <i>Boussole</i> and the
<i>Astrolabe</i>, was meeting with heavy weather in his attempt
to double Point Solander. The wind blew hard from that quarter,
and his ships were too heavy sailers to force their passage
against wind and current combined. The whole of the 24th was
spent in full sight of Botany Bay, which they could not enter.
But their hearts were cheered by the spectacle of the pennants
and ensigns on the eleven British vessels, plainly seen at
intervals within, and the prospect of meeting Europeans again
made them impatient to fetch their anchorage.</p>
<p>The <i>Sirius</i> was just about to sail when the French
vessels entered the Bay at nine in the morning of January 26, but
Captain Hunter courteously sent over a lieutenant and midshipman,
with his compliments and offers of such assistance as it was in
his power to give. "I despatched an officer", records
Lap&eacute;rouse, "to return my thanks to Captain Hunter, who by
this time had his anchor a-peak and his topsails hoisted, telling
him that my wants were confined to wood and water, of which we
could not fail in this Bay; and I was sensible that vessels
intended to settle a colony at such a distance from Europe could
not be of any assistance to navigators." The English lieutenant,
according to Lap&eacute;rouse, "appeared to make a great mystery
of Commodore Phillip's plan, and we did not take the liberty of
putting any questions to him on the subject." It was not the
business of a junior officer to give unauthorised information,
but perhaps his manner made a greater mystery of the Governor's
plans than the circumstances required.</p>
<p>It was at Kamchatka that the French had learnt that the
British were establishing a settlement in New South Wales; but
Lap&eacute;rouse, when he arrived at Botany Bay, had no definite
idea as to the progress they had made. According to
Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, he expected to find a town built and
a market established. Instead of that he found the first
colonists abandoning the site where it was originally intended
that they should settle, and preparing to fix their abode at
another spot. But after he had seen something of Botany Bay he
expressed himself as "convinced of the propriety and absolute
necessity of the measure."</p>
<p>The later relations between the English and French were of the
most pleasant kind. It does not appear from the writings of those
who have left records that Phillip and Lap&eacute;rouse ever met,
or that the latter ever saw the beginnings of Sydney. His ships
certainly never entered Port Jackson. But we learn from Captain
Tench that "during their stay in the port" (<i>i.e</i>. in Botany
Bay) "the officers of the two nations had frequent opportunities
of testifying their mutual regard by visits and other
interchanges of friendship and esteem;" and Lap&eacute;rouse
gratified the English especially "by the feeling manner in which
he always mentioned the name and talents of Captain Cook."</p>
<p>Not only in what he wrote with an eye to publication, but in
his private correspondence, Lap&eacute;rouse expressed his
gratification at the friendly relations established. He spoke of
"frequent intercourse" with the English, and said that "to the
most polite attentions they have added every offer of service in
their power; and it was not without regret that we saw them
depart, almost immediately upon our arrival, for Port Jackson,
fifteen miles to the northward of this place. Commodore Phillip
had good reason to prefer that port, and he has left us sole
masters of this bay, where our long-boats are already on the
stocks."</p>
<p>The fullest account is given in the journal of Lieutenant
King, afterwards (1800-6) Governor of New South Wales. On
February 1 Phillip sent him in a cutter, in company with
Lieutenant Dawes of the Marines, to visit Lap&eacute;rouse, "and
to offer him whatever he might have occasion for." King relates
that they were "received with the greatest politeness and
attention by Monsieur de Lap&eacute;rouse and his officers." He
accepted an invitation to remain during the day with the French,
to dine with the Commodore, and to return to Port Jackson next
morning. The complete history of the voyage was narrated to him,
including of course the tragic story of the massacre of de Langle
and his companions.</p>
<p>After dinner on the <i>Boussole</i>, King was taken ashore,
where he found the French "quite established, having thrown round
their tents a stockade, guarded by two small guns." This defence
was needed to protect the frames of the two new longboats, which
were being put together, from the natives; and also, it would
appear, from a few escaped convicts, "whom he had dismissed with
threats, giving them a day's provision to carry them back to ye
settlement." Lap&eacute;rouse himself, in his history&mdash;in
the very last words of it, in fact&mdash;complains that "we had
but too frequent opportunities of hearing news of the English
settlement, the deserters from which gave us a great deal of
trouble and embarrassment."</p>
<p>We learn from King a little about the P&egrave;re
Receveur&mdash;a very little, truly, but sufficient to make us
wish to know more. From the circumstance that his quarters were
on the <i>Astrolabe</i>, and that, therefore, he was not brought
very much under the notice of Lap&eacute;rouse, we read scarcely
anything about him in the commander's book. Once during the
voyage some acids used by him for scientific purposes ignited,
and set fire to the ship, but the danger was quickly suppressed.
This incident, and that of the wounding of Receveur at
Man&uuml;a, are nearly all we are told about him from the
commander. But he struck King as being "a man of letters and
genius." He was a collector of natural curiosities, having under
his care "a great number of philosophical instruments." King's
few lines, giving the impression derived from a necessarily brief
conversation, seem to bring the Abbe before us in a flash. "A man
of letters and genius": how gladly we would know more of one of
whom those words could be written! Receveur died shortly before
Lap&eacute;rouse sailed away, and was buried at the foot of a
tree, to which were nailed a couple of boards bearing an
inscription. Governor Phillip, when the boards fell down, had the
inscription engraved on a copper plate. The tomb, which is now so
prominent an object at Botany Bay, was erected by the Baron de
Bougainville in 1825. The memorials to the celebrated navigator
and the simple scholar stand together.</p>
<p>King, in common with Tench, records the admiring way in which
Lap&eacute;rouse spoke of Cook. He "informed me that every place
where he has touched or been near, he found all the astronomical
and nautical works of Captain Cook to be very exact and true, and
concluded by saying, 'Enfin, Monsieur Cook a tant fait qu'il ne
m'a rien laisse a faire que d'admirer ses &oelig;uvres.'" (In
short, Mr. Cook has done so much that he has left me nothing to
do but to admire his works).</p>
<p>There is very little more to tell about those few weeks spent
at Botany Bay before the navigator and his companions "vanished
trackless into blue immensity", as Carlyle puts it. A fragment of
conversation is preserved by Tench. A musket was fired one day,
and the natives marvelled less at the noise than at the fact that
the bullet made a hole in a piece of bark at which it was aimed.
To calm them, "an officer whistled the air of 'Malbrook', which
they appeared highly charmed with, and greeted him with equal
pleasure and readiness. I may remark here," adds the Captain of
Marines, "what I was afterwards told by Monsieur de Perousse" (so
he mis-spells the name) "that the natives of California, as
throughout all the isles of the Pacific Ocean, and in short
wherever he had been, seemed equally touched and delighted with
this little plaintive air." It is gratifying to be able to record
Captain Tench's high opinion of the efficacy of the tune, which
is popularly known nowadays as "We won't go home till morning."
One has often heard of telling things "to the Marines." This
gallant officer, doubtless, used to whistle them, to a "little
plaintive air."</p>

<br>
<b>Tomb of P&egrave;re Receveur</b></p>
<br>
<p>It was the practice of Lap&eacute;rouse to sow seeds at places
visited by his ships, with the object of experimenting with
useful European plants that might be cultivated in other parts of
the world. His own letters and journal do not show that he did so
at Botany Bay; but we have other evidence that he did, and that
the signs of cultivation had not vanished at least ten years
later. When George Bass was returning to Sydney in February,
1798, at the end of that wonderful cruise in a whaleboat which
had led to the discovery of Westernport, he was becalmed off
Botany Bay. He was disposed to enter and remain there for the
night, but his journal records that his people&mdash;the six
picked British sailors who were the companions of his
enterprise&mdash;"seemed inclined to push for home rather than go
up to the Frenchman's Garden." Therefore, the wind failing, they
took to the oars and rowed to Port Jackson, reaching home at ten
o'clock at night. That is a very interesting allusion. The
Frenchman's Garden must have been somewhere within the enclosed
area where the Cable Station now stands, and it would be well if
so pleasant a name, and one so full of historical suggestion,
were still applied to that reserve.</p>
<p>It may be well to quote in full the passage in which
Lap&eacute;rouse relates his experience of Botany Bay. He was not
able to write his journal up to the date of his departure before
despatching it to Europe, but the final paragraphs in it
sufficiently describe what occurred, and what he thought. Very
loose and foolish statements have occasionally been published as
to his object in visiting the port. In one of the geographical
journals a few years ago the author saw it stated that there was
"a race for a Continent" between the English and the French, in
which the former won by less than a week! Nonsense of that sort,
even though it appears in sober publications, issued with a
scientific purpose, can emanate only from those who have no real
acquaintance with the subject. There was no race, no struggle for
priority, no thought of territorial acquisition on the part of
the French. The reader of this little book knows by this time
that the visit to Botany Bay was not originally contemplated. It
was not in the programme.</p>
<p>What would have happened if Lap&eacute;rouse had safely
returned home, and if the French Revolution had not destroyed
Louis XVI and blown his exploration and colonisation schemes into
thin air, is quite another question; but "ifs" are not history.
You can entirely reconstruct the history of the human race by
using enough "ifs", but with that sort of thing, which an ironist
has termed "Iftory", and is often more amusing than enlightening,
more speculative than sound, we have at present nothing to do.
Here is the version of the visit given by Lap&eacute;rouse
himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We made the land on the 23rd January. It has little
elevation, and is scarcely possible to be seen at a greater
distance than twelve leagues. The wind then became very variable;
and, like Captain Cook, we met with currents, which carried us
every day fifteen minutes south of our reckoning; so that we
spent the whole of the 24th in plying in sight of Botany Bay,
without being able to double Point Solander, which bore from us a
league north. The wind blew strong from that quarter, and our
ships were too heavy sailers to surmount the force of the wind
and the currents combined; but that day we had a spectacle to
which we had been altogether unaccustomed since our departure
from Manilla. This was a British squadron, at anchor in Botany
Bay, the pennants and ensigns of which we could plainly
distinguish. All Europeans are countrymen at such a distance from
home, and we had the most eager impatience to fetch the
anchorage; but the next day the weather was so foggy that it was
impossible to discern the land, and we did not get in till the
26th, at nine in the morning, when we let go our anchor a mile
from the north shore, in seven fathoms of water, on a good bottom
of grey sand, abreast of the second bay.</p>
<p>"The moment I made my appearance in the entrance of the Bay, a
lieutenant and midshipman were sent aboard my vessel by Captain
Hunter, commanding the British frigate <i>Sirius</i>. They
offered from him all the services in his power; adding, however,
that, as he was just getting under way to proceed to the
northward, circumstances would not allow him to furnish us with
provision, ammunition or sails; so that his offers of service
were reduced to good wishes for the future success of our
voyage.</p>
<p>"I despatched an officer to return my thanks to Captain
Hunter, who by this time had his anchor a-peak, and his topsails
hoisted; telling him that my wants were confined to wood and
water, of which we could not fail in this Bay; and I was sensible
that vessels intended to settle a colony at such a distance from
Europe, could not be of any assistance to navigators.</p>
<p>"From the lieutenant we learnt that the English squadron was
commanded by Commodore Phillip, who had sailed from Botany Bay
the previous evening in the <i>Supply</i>, sloop, with four
transports, in search of a more commodious place for a settlement
further north. The lieutenant appeared to make a great mystery of
Commodore Phillip's plan, and we did not take the liberty of
putting any questions to him on the subject; but we had no doubt
that the intended settlement must be very near Botany Bay, since
several boats were under sail for the place, and the passage
certainly must be very short, as it was thought unnecessary to
hoist them on board. The crew of the English boat, less discreet
than their officer, soon informed our people that they were only
going to Port Jackson, sixteen miles north of Point Banks, where
Commander Phillip had himself reconnoitred a very good harbour,
which ran ten miles into the land, to the south-west, and in
which the ships might anchor within pistol-shot of the shore, in
water as smooth as that of a basin. We had, afterwards, but too
frequent opportunities of hearing news of the English settlement,
the deserters from which gave us a great deal of trouble and
embarrassment."</p>

<br>
<p>Pieced together thus is nearly all we know about
Lap&eacute;rouse during his visit to Botany Bay. It is not much.
We would gladly have many more details. What has become of the
letter he wrote to Phillip recommending (according to King) the
Pacific Islands as worthy of the attention of the new colony,
"for the great quantity of stock with which they abound"?
Apparently it is lost. The grave and the deep have swallowed up
the rest of this "strange eventful history", and we interrogate
in vain. We should know even less than we do were it not that
Lap&eacute;rouse obtained from Phillip permission to send home,
by the next British ship leaving Port Jackson, his journal, some
charts, and the drawings of his artists. This material, added to
private letters and a few miscellaneous papers, was placed in
charge of Lieutenant Shortland to be delivered to the French
Ambassador in London, and formed part of the substance of the two
volumes and atlas published in Paris.</p>
<p align="center">

<p>It may be well to cite, as a note to this chapter, the books
in which contemporary accounts of the visit of Lap&eacute;rouse
and his ships to Botany Bay are to be found. Some readers may
thereby be tempted to look into the original authorities.
Lap&eacute;rouse's own narrative is contained in the third and
fourth volumes of his "Voyage autour du Monde", edited by
Milet-Mureau (Paris, 1797). There are English translations. A few
letters at the end of the work give a little additional
information. Governor Phillip's "Voyage to Botany Bay" (London,
1789) contains a good but brief account. Phillip's despatch to
the Secretary of State, Lord Sydney, printed in the "Historical
Records of New South Wales", Vol. I., part 2, p. 121, devotes a
paragraph to the subject. King's Journal in Vol. II. of the
"Records", p. 543-7, gives his story. Surgeon Bowes' Journal, on
page 391 of the same volume, contains a rather picturesque
allusion. Hunter's "Voyage to Botany Bay" (London, 1793)
substantially repeats King's version. Captain Watkin Tench, of
the Marines, has a good account in his "Narrative of an
Expedition to Botany Bay" (London, 1789), and Paterson's "History
of New South Wales" (Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1811) makes an allusion
to the French expedition.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><b>THE MYSTERY, AND THE SECRET OF THE
SEA.</b></p>
<br>
<p>THE <i>Boussole</i> and the <i>Astrolabe</i> sailed from
Botany Bay on March 10, 1788. After recording that fact we might
well inscribe the pathetic last words of Hamlet, "the rest is
silence."</p>
<p>We know what Lap&eacute;rouse intended to do. He wrote two
letters to friends in France, explaining the programme to be
followed after sailing from Botany Bay. They do not agree in
every particular, but we may take the last letter written to
express his final determination. According to this, his plan was
to sail north, passing between Papua (New Guinea) and Australia
by another channel than Endeavour Strait, if he could find one.
During September and October he intended to visit the Gulf of
Carpentaria, and thence sail down the west and along the south of
Australia, to Tasmania, "but in such a manner that it may be
possible for me to stretch northward in time to arrive at
Ile-de-France in the beginning of December, 1788." That was the
programme which he was not destined to complete&mdash;hardly,
indeed, to enter upon. Had he succeeded, his name would have been
inscribed amongst the memorable company of the world's great
maritime explorers. As it is, the glint on his brow, as he stands
in the light of history, is less that of achievement than of high
promise, noble aims, romance and mystery.</p>
<p>One of the letters sent from Sydney concluded with these
words: "Adieu! I shall depart in good health, as are all my
ship's company. We would undertake six voyages round the world if
it could afford to our country either profit or pleasure." They
were not the last words he wrote, but we may appropriately take
them as being, not merely his adieu to a friend, but to the
world.</p>
<p>Time sped on; the date given for the arrival at Ile-de-France
was passed; the year 1789 dawned and ticked off the tally of its
days. But nothing was heard of Lap&eacute;rouse. People in France
grew anxious, one especially we may be sure&mdash;she who knew so
well where the ships would anchor in Port Louis if they emerged
out of the ocean brume, and who longed so ardently that renewed
acquaintance with scenes once sweetly familiar would awaken
memories meet to give wings to speed and spurs to delay. Not a
word came to sustain or cheer, and the faint flush of hope faded
to the wan hue of despair on the cheek of love.</p>
<p>By 1791 all expectation of seeing the expedition return was
abandoned. But could not some news of its fate be ascertained?
Had it faded out of being like a summer cloud, leaving not a
trace behind? Might not some inkling be had, some small relics
obtained, some whisper caught, in those distant isles,</p>
<p class="poem">"Where the sea egg flames on the coral, and
the<br>
   long-backed breakers croon<br>
Their endless ocean legend to the lazy, locked<br>
   lagoon."</p>
<p>France was then in the throes of her great social earthquake;
but it stands to the credit of the National Assembly that, amidst
many turbulent projects and boiling passions, they found time and
had the disposition to cause the fitting out of a new expedition
to search for tidings of those whose disappearance weighed
heavily on the heart of the nation. The decree was passed on
February 9, 1791.</p>
<p>Two ships, the <i>Recherche</i> and the
<i>Esp&eacute;rance</i>, were selected and placed under the
command of Dentrecasteaux. He had already had some experience in
a part of the region to be searched, had been a governor of
Ile-de-France, and during a South Sea voyage had named the
cluster of islands east of Papua now called the D'Entrecasteaux
Group. The second ship was placed under the command of Captain
Huon Kermadec. The Huon River in Tasmania, and the Kermadec
Islands, N.E. of New Zealand, are named after him.</p>
<p>Fleurieu again drew up the instructions, and based them
largely upon the letter from Lap&eacute;rouse quoted above,
pointing out that remains of him would most probably be found in
the neighbourhood of coasts which he had intended to explore. It
was especially indicated that there was, south of New Holland, an
immense stretch of coastline so far utterly unknown. "No
navigator has penetrated in that part of the sea; the
reconnaissances and discoveries of the Dutch, the English and the
French commenced at the south of Van Diemen's Land."</p>
<p>Thus, for the second time, was a French navigator directed to
explore the southern coasts of Australia; and had Dentrecasteaux
followed the plan laid down for him he would have forestalled the
discoveries of Grant, Bass and Flinders, just as Lap&eacute;rouse
would have done had his work not been cut short by disaster.</p>
<p>It has to be remembered that the instructions impressed upon
Dentrecasteaux that his business primarily was not geographical
discovery, but to get news of his lost compatriots. But even so,
is it not curious that the French should have been concerned with
the exploration of Southern Australia before the English thought
about it; that they should have had two shots at the task,
planned with knowledge and care, officially directed, and in
charge of eminently competent navigators; but that nevertheless
their schemes should have gone awry? They made a third attempt by
means of Baudin's expedition, during the Napoleonic Consulate,
and again were unsuccessful, except in a very small measure. It
almost seems as if some power behind human endeavours had
intended these coasts for British finding&mdash;and keeping.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image11" id="Image11"></a><img alt=""
src="e00078-images/Image11.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Admiral Dentrecasteaux</b></p>
<br>
<p>The full story of Dentrecasteaux' expedition has not yet been
told. Two thick books were written about it, but a mass of
unpublished papers contain details that were judiciously kept out
of those volumes. When the whole truth is made known, it will be
seen that the bitter strife which plunged France in an agony of
blood and tears was not confined to the land.</p>
<p>The ships did not visit Sydney. Why not? It might have been
expected that an expedition sent to discover traces of
Lap&eacute;rouse would have been careful to make Botany Bay in
the first instance, and, after collecting whatever evidence was
available there, would have carefully followed the route that he
had proposed to pursue. But it would seem that an European
settlement was avoided. Why? The unpublished papers may furnish
an answer to that question.</p>
<p>Neither was the south coast of Australia explored. That great
chance was missed. Some excellent charting&mdash;which ten years
later commanded the cordial admiration of Flinders&mdash;was done
by Beautemps-Beaupr&eacute;, who was Dentrecasteaux'
cartographer, especially round about the S.W. corner of the
continent. Esperance Bay, in Western Australia, is named after
one of the ships of this expedition. But from that corner, his
ships being short of fresh water, Dentrecasteaux sailed on a
direct line to Southern Tasmania, and thence to New Zealand, New
Caledonia, and New Guinea. Touch with the only European centre in
these parts was &mdash;apparently with deliberation&mdash;not
obtained.</p>
<p>Dentrecasteaux died while his ships were in the waters to the
north of New Guinea. He fell violently ill, raving at first, then
subsiding into unconsciousness, a death terrible to read about in
the published narrative, where the full extent of his troubles is
not revealed. Kermadec, commander of the <i>Esp&eacute;rance</i>,
also died at New Caledonia. After their decease the ships
returned to France as rapidly as they could. They were detained
by the Dutch at Sourabaya for several months, as prisoners of
war, and did not reach Europe till March, 1796. Their mission had
been abortive.</p>
<p>Five French Captains who brought expeditions to Australia at
this period all ended in misfortune. Lap&eacute;rouse was
drowned; de Langle was murdered; Dentrecasteaux died miserably at
sea; Kermadec, the fourth, had expired shortly before; and
Baudin, the fifth, died at Port Louis on the homeward voyage.</p>
<p>Nor is even that the last touch of melancholy to the tale of
tragedy. There was a young poet who was touched by the fate of
Lap&eacute;rouse. Andre Ch&eacute;nier is now recognised as one
of the finest masters of song who have enriched French
literature, and his poems are more and more studied and admired
both by his own countrymen and abroad. He planned and partly
finished a long poem, "L'Amerique", which contains a mournful
passage about the mystery of the sea which had not then been
solved. A translation of the lines will not be attempted here;
they are mentioned because the poet himself had an end as tragic,
though in a different mode, as that of the hero of whom he sang.
He came under the displeasure of the tyrants of the Red Terror
through his friends and his writings, and in March, 1794, the
guillotine took this brilliant young genius as a victim.</p>
<p class="poem">"J'accuserai les vents et cette mer jalouse<br>
Qui retient, qui peut-&ecirc;tre a ravi Lap&eacute;rouse":</p>
<p>so the poem begins. How strangely the shadow of Tragedy hangs
over this ill-starred expedition; Louis XVI the projector,
Lap&eacute;rouse and de Langle the commanders, Dentrecasteaux and
Kermadec the searchers, Andre Ch&eacute;nier the laureate: the
breath of the black-robed Fury was upon them all!</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><b>CAPTAIN DILLON'S DISCOVERY.</b></p>
<br>
<p>THE navigators of all nations were fascinated by the mystery
attaching to the fate of Lap&eacute;rouse. Every ship that sailed
the Pacific hoped to obtain tidings or remains. From time to time
rumours arose of the discovery of relics. One reported the sight
of wreckage; another that islanders had been seen dressed in
French uniforms; another that a cross of St. Louis had been
found. But the element of probability in the various stories
evaporated on investigation. Flinders, sailing north from Port
Jackson in the <i>Investigator</i> in 1802, kept a sharp lookout
on the Barrier Reef, the possibility of finding some trace being
"always present to my mind." But no definite news came.</p>
<p>A new French voyage of exploration came down to the Pacific in
1817, under the command of Louis de Freycinet, who had been a
lieutenant in Baudin's expedition in 1800-4. The purpose was not
chiefly to look for evidence concerning Lap&eacute;rouse, though
naturally a keen scrutiny was maintained with this object in
view.</p>
<p>An extremely queer fact may be mentioned in connection with
this voyage. The <i>Uranie</i> carried a woman among the crew,
the only one of her sex amidst one hundred men. Madame de
Freycinet, the wife of the commandant, joined at Toulon, dressed
as a ship's boy, and it was given out in the newspapers that her
husband was very much surprised when he found that his wife had
managed to get aboard in disguise. But Arago, one of the
scientific staff, tells us in his Memoirs, published in 1837,
that&mdash;as we can well believe&mdash;Freycinet knew perfectly
who the "young and pretty" boy was, and had connived at her
joining the ship as a lad, because she wanted to accompany her
husband, and the authorities would have prevented her had they
known. She continued to wear her boy's dress until after the
ships visited Gibraltar, for Arago informs us that the solemn
British Lieutenant-Governor there, when he saw her, broke into a
smile, "the first perhaps that his features had worn for ten
years." If that be true, the little lady surely did a little good
by her saucy escapade. But official society regarded the lady in
trousers with a frigid stare, so that henceforth she deemed it
discreet to resume feminine garments. It does not appear that she
passed for a boy when the expedition visited Sydney, and of
course no hint of Madame's presence is given in the official
history of the voyage.</p>
<p>We now reach the stage when the veil was lifted and the
mystery explained. In 1813 the East India Company's ship
<i>Hunter</i>, voyaging from Calcutta to Sydney, called at the
Fiji Islands. They discovered that several Europeans were living
on one of the group. Some had been shipwrecked; some had deserted
from vessels; but they had become accustomed to the life and
preferred it. The <i>Hunter</i> employed a party of them to
collect sandal wood and b&ecirc;che-de-mer, one of her junior
officers, Peter Dillon, being in charge. A quarrel with natives
occurred, and all the Europeans were murdered, except Dillon, a
Prussian named Martin Bushart, and a seaman, William Wilson.
After the affray Bushart would certainly have been slain had he
remained, so he induced the captain of the <i>Hunter</i> to give
him a passage to the first land reached. Accordingly Bushart, a
Fiji woman who was his wife, and a Lascar companion, were landed
on Barwell Island, or Tucopia.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later Peter Dillon was sailing in command of
his own ship, the <i>St. Patrick</i>, from Valparaiso to
Pondicherry, when he sighted Tucopia. Curiosity prompted him to
stop to enquire whether his old friend Martin Bushart was still
alive. He hove to, and shortly after two canoes put off from the
land, bringing Bushart and the Lascar, both in excellent
health.</p>
<p>Now, Dillon observed that the Lascar sold an old silver sword
guard to one of the <i>St. Patrick</i>'s crew in return for a few
fish hooks. This made him inquisitive. He asked the Prussian
where it came from. Bushart informed him that when he first
arrived at the island he saw in possession of the natives, not
only this sword guard, but also several chain plates, iron bolts,
axes, the handle of a silver fork, some knives, tea cups, beads,
bottles, a silver spoon bearing a crest and monogram, and a
sword. He asked where these articles were obtained, and the
natives told him that they got them from the Mannicolo (or
Vanikoro) cluster of islands, two days' canoe voyage from
Tucopia, in the Santa Cruz group.</p>
<p>"Upon examining the sword minutely" wrote Dillon, "I
discovered, or thought I discovered, the initials of Perouse
stamped on it, which excited my suspicion and made me more exact
in my inquiries. I then, by means of Bushart and the Lascar,
questioned some of the islanders respecting the way in which
their neighbours procured the silver and iron articles. They told
me that the natives of Mannicolo stated that many years ago two
large ships arrived at their islands; one anchored at the island
of Whanoo, and the other at the island of Paiou, a little
distance from each other. Some time after they anchored, and
before they had any communication with the natives, a heavy gale
arose and both vessels were driven ashore. The ship that was
anchored off Whanoo grounded upon the rocks.</p>
<p>"The natives came in crowds to the seaside, armed with clubs,
spears, and bows and arrows, and shot some arrows into the ship,
and the crew in return fired the guns and some musketry on them
and killed several. The vessel, continuing to beat violently
against the rocks, shortly afterwards went to pieces. Some of the
crew took to their boats, and were driven on shore, where they
were to a man murdered on landing by the infuriated natives.
Others threw themselves into the sea; but if they reached the
shore it was only to share the fate of their wretched comrades,
so that not a single soul escaped out of this vessel."</p>
<p>The ship wrecked on Paiou, according to the natives' story,
was driven on a sandy beach. Some arrows were fired into her, but
the crew did not fire. They were restrained, and held up beads,
axes, and toys, making a demonstration of friendliness. As soon
as the wind abated, an old chief came aboard the wrecked ship,
where he was received in friendly fashion, and, going ashore,
pacified his people. The crew of the vessel, compelled to abandon
her, carried the greater part of their stores ashore, where they
built a small boat from the remains of the wreck. As soon as this
craft was ready to sail, as many as could conveniently be taken
embarked and sailed away. They were never heard of again. The
remainder of the crew remained on the island until they died.</p>
<p>Such was the information collected by Captain Peter Dillon in
1826. He took away with him the sword guard, but regretted to
learn that the silver spoon had been beaten into wire by Bushart
for making rings and ornaments for female islanders.</p>
<p>When he reached Calcutta, Dillon wrote an account of his
discovery in a letter to the government of Bengal, and suggested
that he should be sent in command of an expedition to search the
Vanikoro cluster in the hope of finding some old survivor of
Lap&eacute;rouse's unhappy company, or at all events further
remains of the ships. He had prevailed upon Martin Bushart to
accompany him to India, and hoped, through this man's knowledge
of the native tongue, to elicit all that was to be known.</p>

<b>Map of Vanikoro Island</b></p>
<br>
<p>The Government of British India became interested in Dillon's
discovery, and resolved to send him in command of a ship to
search for further information. At the end of 1826 he sailed in
the <i>Research</i>, and in September of the following year came
within sight of the high-peaked island Tucopia. The enquiries
made on this voyage fully confirmed and completed the story, and
left no room for doubt that the ships of Lap&eacute;rouse had
been wrecked and his whole company massacred or drowned on or
near Vanikoro. Many natives still living remembered the arrival
of the French. Some of them related that they thought those who
came on the big ships to be not men but spirits; and such a
grotesque bit of description as was given of the peaks of cocked
hats exactly expressed the way in which the appearance of the
strangers would be likely to appeal to the native
imagination:&mdash;"There was a projection from their foreheads
or noses a foot long."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dillon's officers were able to purchase from the
islands such relics as an old sword blade, a rusted razor, a
silver sauce-boat with fleur-de-lis upon it, a brass mortar, a
few small bells, a silver sword-handle bearing a cypher,
apparently a "P" with a crown, part of a blacksmith's vice, the
crown of a small anchor, and many other articles. An examination
of natives brought out a few further details, as for example, a
description of the chief of the strangers, "who used always to be
looking at the stars and the sun and beckoning to them", which is
how a native would be likely to regard a man making astronomical
observations. Dillon, in short had solved the forty years'
mystery. The Pacific had revealed her long-held secret.</p>
<p>It happened that a new French expedition in the
<i>Astrolabe</i>, under the command of Dumont-D'Urville, was in
the southern hemisphere at this time. While he lay at Hobart on
his way to New Zealand, the captain heard of Dillon's
discoveries, and, at once changing his plans, sailed for the
Santa Cruz Islands. He arrived there in February, 1828, and made
some valuable finds to supplement those of the English captain.
At the bottom of the sea, in perfectly clear water, he saw lying,
encrusted with coral, some remains of anchors, chains, guns,
bullets, and other objects which had clearly belonged to the
ships of Lap&eacute;rouse. One of his artists made a drawing of
them on the spot. They were recovered, and, together with
Dillon's collection, are now exhibited in a pyramid at the Marine
Museum at the Louvre in Paris, in memory of the ill-fated
commander and crew who perished, martyrs in the great cause of
discovery, a century and a quarter ago.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that descendants of Captain Dillon
are residents of Sydney to this day.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><b>THE FAME OF LAP&Eacute;ROUSE.</b></p>
<br>
<p>INTELLECTUALLY, and as a navigator, Lap&eacute;rouse was a son
of James Cook, and he himself would have rejoiced to be so
described. The allusions to his predecessor in his writings are
to be numbered by scores, and the note of reverent admiration is
frequently sounded. He followed Cook's guidance in the management
of his ships, paying particular attention to the diet of his
crews. He did not succeed in keeping scurvy at bay altogether,
but when the disease made its appearance he met it promptly by
securing fresh vegetable food for the sufferers, and was so far
successful that when he arrived in Botany Bay his whole company
was in good health.</p>
<p>The influence of the example and experience of Cook may be
illustrated in many ways, some of them curious. We may take a
point as to which he really had little to fear; but he knew what
had occurred in Cook's case and he was anxious that the same
should not happen to him. The published story of Cook's first
South Sea Voyage, as is well known, was not his own. His journal
was handed over to Dr. Hawkesworth, a gentleman who tried to
model his literary style on that of Dr. Johnson, and evolved a
pompous, big-drum product in consequence. Hawkesworth garnished
the manly, straightforward navigator's simple and direct English
with embellishments of his own. Where Cook was plain Hawkesworth
was ornate; where Cook was sensible Hawkesworth was silly; where
Cook was accurate, Hawkesworth by stuffing in his own precious
observations made the narrative unreliable, and even ridiculous.
In fact, the gingerbread Johnson simply spoiled Cook.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson was by no means gratified by the ponderous
prancings of his imitator. We learn from Boswell that when the
great man met Captain Cook at a dinner given by the President of
the Royal Society, he said that he "was much pleased with the
conscientious accuracy of that celebrated circumnavigator, who
set me right as to many of the exaggerated accounts given by Dr.
Hawkesworth of his voyages." Cook himself was annoyed by the
decorating of his story, and resented the treatment strongly.</p>
<p>Lap&eacute;rouse knew this, and was very anxious that nobody
in France should Hawkesworthify him. He did not object to being
carefully edited, but he did not want to be decorated. He wrote
excellent French narrative prose, and his work may be read with
delight. Its qualities of clarity, picturesqueness and
smoothness, are quite in accord with the fine traditions of the
language. But, as it was likely that part of the history of his
voyage might be published before his return, he did not want it
to be handed over to anybody who would trick it out in finery,
and he therefore wrote the following letter:</p>
<p>"If my journal be published before my return, let the editing
of it by no means be entrusted to a man of letters; for either he
will sacrifice to the turn of a phrase the proper terms which the
seaman and man of learning would prefer, but which to him will
appear harsh and barbarous; or, rejecting all the nautical and
astronomical details, and endeavouring to make a pleasing
romance, he will for want of the knowledge his education has not
allowed him to acquire, commit mistakes which may prove fatal to
those who shall follow me. But choose an editor versed in the
mathematical sciences, who is capable of calculating and
comparing my data with those of other investigators, of
rectifying errors which may have escaped me, and of guarding
himself against the commission of others. Such an editor will
preserve the substance of the work; will omit nothing that is
essential; will give technical details the harsh and rude, but
concise style of a seaman; and will well perform his task in
supplying my place and publishing the work as I would have done
it myself."</p>
<p>That letter is a rather singular effect of Lap&eacute;rouse's
study of Cook, which might be illustrated by further examples.
The influence of the great English sailor is the more remarkable
when we remember that there had been early French navigators to
the South Seas before Lap&eacute;rouse. There was the elder
Bougainville, the discoverer of the Navigator Islands; there was
Marion-Dufresne, who was killed and eaten by Maoris in 1772;
there was Surville&mdash;to mention only three. Lap&eacute;rouse
knew of them, and mentioned them. But they had little to teach
him. In short and in truth, he belonged to the school of Cook,
and that is an excellent reason why English and especially
Australian people should have an especial regard for him.</p>
<p>The disastrous end of Lap&eacute;rouse's expedition before he
had completed his task prevented him from adequately realising
his possibilities as a discoverer. As pointed out in the
preceding pages, if he had completed his voyage, he would in all
probability have found the southern coasts of Australia in 1788.
But the work that he actually did is not without importance; and
he unquestionably possessed the true spirit of the explorer. When
he entered upon this phase of his career he was a thoroughly
experienced seaman. He was widely read in voyaging literature,
intellectually well endowed, alert-minded, eager, courageous, and
vigorous. The French nation has had no greater sailor than
Lap&eacute;rouse.</p>
<p>De Lesseps, the companion of his voyage as far as Kamchatka,
has left a brief but striking characterisation of him. "He was",
says this witness, "an accomplished gentleman, perfectly urbane
and full of wit, and possessed of those charming manners which
pertained to the eighteenth century. He was always agreeable in
his relations with subordinates and officers alike." The same
writer tells us that when Louis XVI gave him the command of the
expedition he had the reputation of being the ablest seaman in
the French navy.</p>
<p>Certainly he was no common man to whose memory stands that
tall monument at Botany Bay. It was erected at the cost of the
French Government by the Baron de Bougainville, in 1825, and
serves not only as a reminder of a fine character and a full,
rich and manly life, but of a series of historical events that
are of capital consequence in the exploration and occupation of
Australia.</p>
<p>It will be appropriate to conclude this brief biography with a
tribute to the French navigator from the pen of an English poet.
Thomas Campbell is best remembered by such vigorous poems as "Ye
Mariners of England", and "The Battle of the Baltic", which
express a tense and elevated British patriotism. All the more
impressive for that very reason is his elegy in honour of a
sailor of another nation, whose merits as a man and whose charm
as a writer Campbell had recognised from his boyhood. The
following are his.</p>
<p align="center">LINES<br>
WRITTEN IN A BLANK LEAF OF<br>
LAP&Eacute;ROUSE'S "VOYAGES"</p>
<p class="poem">Loved Voyager! whose pages had a zest<br>
More sweet than fiction to my wondering breast,<br>
When, rapt in fancy, many a boyish day<br>
I tracked his wanderings o'er the watery way,<br>
Roamed round the Aleutian isles in waking dreams,<br>
Or plucked the fleur-de-lys by Jesso's streams,<br>
Or gladly leaped on that far Tartar strand,<br>
Where Europe's anchor ne'er had bit the sand,<br>
Where scarce a roving wild tribe crossed the plain,<br>
Or human voice broke nature's silent reign,&mdash;<br>
But vast and grassy deserts feed the bear,<br>
And sweeping deer-herds dread no hunter's snare.<br>
Such young delight his real records brought,<br>
His truth so touched romantic springs of thought,<br>
That, all my after life, his fate and fame<br>
Entwined romance with Lap&eacute;rouse's name.<br>
<br>
Fair were his ships, expert his gallant crews,<br>
And glorious was the emprise of Lap&eacute;rouse&mdash;<br>
Humanely glorious! Men will weep for him,<br>
When many a guilty martial fame is dim:<br>
He ploughed the deep to bind no captive's chain&mdash;<br>
Pursued no rapine&mdash;strewed no wreck with slain;<br>
And, save that in the deep themselves lie low,<br>
His heroes plucked no wreath from human woe.<br>
'Twas his the earth's remotest bounds to scan,<br>
Conciliating with gifts barbaric man&mdash;<br>
Enrich the world's contemporaneous mind,<br>
And amplify the picture of mankind.<br>
Far on the vast Pacific, 'midst those isles<br>
O'er which the earliest morn of Asia smiles,<br>
He sounded and gave charts to many a shore<br>
And gulf of ocean new to nautic lore;<br>
Yet he that led discovery o'er the wave,<br>
Still finds himself an undiscovered grave.<br>
He came not back! Conjecture's cheek grew pale,<br>
Year after year; in no propitious gale<br>
His lilied banner held its homeward way,<br>
And Science saddened at her martyr's stay.<br>
<br>
An age elapsed: no wreck told where or when<br>
The chief went down with all his gallant men,<br>
Or whether by the storm and wild sea flood<br>
He perished, or by wilder men of blood.<br>
The shuddering fancy only guess'd his doom,<br>
And doubt to sorrow gave but deeper gloom.<br>
<br>
An age elapsed: when men were dead or gray,<br>
Whose hearts had mourned him in their youthful day,<br>
Fame traced on Vanikoro's shore at last,<br>
The boiling surge had mounted o'er his mast.<br>
The islesmen told of some surviving men,<br>
But Christian eyes beheld them ne'er again.<br>
Sad bourne of all his toils&mdash;with all his band<br>
To sleep, wrecked, shroudless, on a savage strand!<br>
Yet what is all that fires a hero's scorn<br>
Of death?&mdash;the hope to live in hearts unborn.<br>
Life to the brave is not its fleeting breath,<br>
But worth&mdash;foretasting fame that follows death.<br>
That worth had Lap&eacute;rouse, that meed he won.<br>
He sleeps&mdash;his life's long stormy watch is done.<br>
In the great deep, whose boundaries and space<br>
He measured, fate ordained his resting place;<br>
But bade his fame, like th' ocean rolling o'er<br>
His relics, visit every earthly shore.<br>
Fair Science on that ocean's azure robe<br>
Still writes his name in picturing the globe,<br>
And paints (what fairer wreath could glory twine?)<br>
His watery course&mdash;a world-encircling line.</p>
