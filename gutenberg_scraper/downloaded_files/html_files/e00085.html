<p>The following Narrative is only a part of a voyage undertaken
for the purpose of conveying the Bread-fruit Tree from the South
Sea Islands to the West Indies. The manner in which this expedition
miscarried, with the subsequent transactions and events, are here
related. This part of the voyage is not first in the order of time,
yet the circumstances are so distinct from that by which it was
preceded, that it appears unnecessary to delay giving as much early
information as possible concerning so extraordinary an event. The
rest will be laid before the Public as soon as it can be got ready;
and it is intended to publish it in such a manner, as, with the
present Narrative, will make the account of the voyage
compleat.</p>
<p>At present, for the better understanding the following
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3]</span>pages, it is sufficient to
inform the reader, that in August, 1787, I was appointed to command
the Bounty, a ship of 215 tons burthen, carrying 4 six-pounders, 4
swivels, and 46 men, including myself and every person on board. We
sailed from England in December, 1787, and arrived at Otaheite the
26th of October, 1788. On the 4th of April, 1789, we left Otaheite,
with every favourable appearance of completing the object of the
voyage, in a manner equal to my most sanguine expectations. At this
period the ensuing <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span>Narrative
commences.</p>

<h2>NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>I sailed from Otaheite on the 4th of April 1789, having on board
1015 fine bread-fruit plants, besides many other valuable fruits of
that country, which, with unremitting attention, we had been
collecting for three and twenty weeks, and which were now in the
highest state of perfection.</p>
<p>On the 11th of April, I discovered an island in latitude 18&deg;
52&acute; S. and longitude 200&deg; 19&acute; E. by the natives
called Whytootackee. On the 24th we anchored at Annamooka, one of
the Friendly Islands; from which, after completing our wood and
water, I sailed on the 27th, having every reason to expect, from
the fine condition of the plants, that they would continue
healthy.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 28th, owing to light winds, we were not
clear of the islands, and at night I directed my course towards
Tofoa. The master had the first watch; the gunner the middle watch;
and Mr. Christian, one of the mates, the morning watch. This was
the turn of duty for the night.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>Just before sun-rising, Mr. Christian, with the master at arms,
gunner's mate, and Thomas Burket, seaman, came into my cabin while
I was asleep, and seizing me, tied my hands with a cord behind my
back, and threatened me <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id=
"Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>with instant death, if I spoke or made
the least noise: I, however, called so loud as to alarm every one;
but they had already secured the officers who were not of their
party, by placing centinels at their doors. There were three men at
my cabin door, besides the four within; Christian had only a
cutlass in his hand, the others had muskets and bayonets. I was
hauled out of bed, and forced on deck in my shirt, suffering great
pain from the tightness with which they had tied my hands. I
demanded the reason of such violence, but received no other answer
than threats of instant death, if I did not hold my tongue. Mr.
Elphinston, the master's mate, was kept in his birth; Mr. Nelson,
botanist, Mr. Peckover, gunner, Mr. Ledward, surgeon, and the
master, were confined to their cabins; and also the clerk, Mr.
Samuel, but he soon obtained leave to come on deck. The fore
hatchway was guarded by centinels; the boatswain and carpenter
were, however, allowed to come on deck, where they saw me standing
abaft the mizen-mast, with my hands tied behind my back, under a
guard, with Christian at their head.</p>
<p>The boatswain was now ordered to hoist the launch out, with a
threat, if he did not do it instantly, to take care of himself.</p>
<p>The boat being out, Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hallet, midshipmen, and
Mr. Samuel, were ordered into it; upon which I demanded the cause
of such an order, and endeavoured to persuade some one to a sense
of duty; but it was to no effect: "Hold your tongue, Sir, or you
are dead this instant," was constantly repeated to me.</p>
<p>The master, by this time, had sent to be allowed to come on
deck, which was permitted; but he was soon ordered back again to
his cabin.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>I continued my endeavours to turn the tide of
affairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg
6]</a></span> when Christian changed the cutlass he had in his hand
for a bayonet, that was brought to him, and, holding me with a
strong gripe by the cord that tied my hands, he with many oaths
threatened to kill me immediately if I would not be quiet: the
villains round me had their pieces cocked and bayonets fixed.
Particular people were now called on to go into the boat, and were
hurried over the side: whence I concluded that with these people I
was to be set adrift.</p>
<p>I therefore made another effort to bring about a change, but
with no other effect than to be threatened with having my brains
blown out.</p>
<p>The boatswain and seamen, who were to go in the boat, were
allowed to collect twine, canvas, lines, sails, cordage, an eight
and twenty gallon cask of water, and the carpenter to take his tool
chest. Mr. Samuel got 150lbs of bread, with a small quantity of rum
and wine. He also got a quadrant and compass into the boat; but was
forbidden, on pain of death, to touch either map, ephemeris, book
of astronomical observations, sextant, time-keeper, or any of my
surveys or drawings.</p>
<p>The mutineers now hurried those they meant to get rid of into
the boat. When most of them were in, Christian directed a dram to
be served to each of his own crew. I now unhappily saw that nothing
could be done to effect the recovery of the ship: there was no one
to assist me, and every endeavour on my part was answered with
threats of death.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>The officers were called, and forced over the side into the
boat, while I was kept apart from every one, abaft the mizen-mast;
Christian, armed with a bayonet, holding me by the bandage that
secured my hands. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id=
"Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> guard round me had their pieces cocked,
but, on my daring the ungrateful wretches to fire, they uncocked
them.</p>
<p>Isaac Martin, one of the guard over me, I saw, had an
inclination to assist me, and, as he fed me with shaddock, (my lips
being quite parched with my endeavours to bring about a change) we
explained our wishes to each other by our looks; but this being
observed, Martin was instantly removed from me; his inclination
then was to leave the ship, for which purpose he got into the boat;
but with many threats they obliged him to return.</p>
<p>The armourer, Joseph Coleman, and the two carpenters, M'Intosh
and Norman, were also kept contrary to their inclination; and they
begged of me, after I was astern in the boat, to remember that they
declared they had no hand in the transaction. Michael Byrne, I am
told, likewise wanted to leave the ship.</p>
<p>It is of no moment for me to recount my endeavours to bring back
the offenders to a sense of their duty: all I could do was by
speaking to them in general; but my endeavours were of no avail,
for I was kept securely bound, and no one but the guard suffered to
come near me.</p>
<p>To Mr. Samuel I am indebted for securing my journals and
commission, with some material ship papers. Without these I had
nothing to certify what I had done, and my honour and character
might have been suspected, without my possessing a proper document
to have defended them. All this he did with great resolution,
though guarded and strictly watched. He attempted to save the
time-keeper, and a box with all my surveys, drawings, and remarks
for fifteen years past, which were numerous; when he was hurried
away, with "Damn your eyes, you are well off to get what you
have."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg
8]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>It appeared to me, that Christian was some time in doubt whether
he should keep the carpenter, or his mates; at length he determined
on the latter, and the carpenter was ordered into the boat. He was
permitted, but not without some opposition, to take his tool
chest.</p>
<p>Much altercation took place among the mutinous crew during the
whole business: some swore "I'll be damned if he does not find his
way home, if he gets any thing with him," (meaning me); others,
when the carpenter's chest was carrying away, "Damn my eyes, he
will have a vessel built in a month." While others laughed at the
helpless situation of the boat, being very deep, and so little room
for those who were in her. As for Christian, he seemed meditating
instant destruction on himself and every one.</p>
<p>I asked for arms, but they laughed at me, and said I was well
acquainted with the people where I was going, and therefore did not
want them; four cutlasses, however, were thrown into the boat,
after we were veered astern.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>When the officers and men, with whom I was suffered to have no
communication, were put into the boat, they only waited for me, and
the master at arms informed Christian of it; who then
said&mdash;"Come, captain Bligh, your officers and men are now in
the boat, and you must go with them; if you attempt to make the
least resistance you will instantly be put to death:" and, without
any farther ceremony, holding me by the cord that tied my hands,
with a tribe of armed ruffians about me, I was forced over the
side, where they untied my hands. Being in the boat we were veered
astern by a rope. A few pieces of pork were then thrown to us, and
some cloaths, also the cutlasses I have already mentioned; and it
was now that the armourer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id=
"Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> and carpenters called out to me to
remember that they had no hand in the transaction. After having
undergone a great deal of ridicule, and been kept some time to make
sport for these unfeeling wretches, we were at length cast adrift
in the open ocean.</p>
<p>I had with me in the boat the following persons:</p>

<p>In all 25 hands, and the most able men of the ship's
company.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>Having little or no wind, we rowed pretty fast towards Tofoa,
which bore N E about 10 leagues from us. While the ship was in
sight she steered to the W N W, but I considered this only as a
feint; for when we were sent away&mdash;"Huzza for Otaheite," was
frequently heard among the mutineers.</p>
<p>Christian, the captain of the gang, is of a respectable
fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
11]</a></span>mily in the north of England. This was the third
voyage he had made with me; and, as I found it necessary to keep my
ship's company at three watches, I gave him an order to take charge
of the third, his abilities being thoroughly equal to the task; and
by this means my master and gunner were not at watch and watch.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>Haywood is also of a respectable family in the north of England,
and a young man of abilities, as well as Christian. These two were
objects of my particular regard and attention, and I took great
pains to instruct them, for they really promised, as professional
men, to be a credit to their country.</p>
<p>Young was well recommended, and appeared to me an able stout
seaman; therefore I was glad to take him: he, however, fell short
of what his appearance promised.</p>
<p>Stewart was a young man of creditable parents, in the Orkneys;
at which place, on the return of the Resolution from the South
Seas, in 1780, we received so many civilities, that, on that
account only, I should gladly have taken him with me: but,
independent of this recommendation, he was a seaman, and had always
borne a good character.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the roughness with which I was treated, the
remembrance of past kindnesses produced some signs of remorse in
Christian. When they were forcing me out of the ship, I asked him,
if this treatment was a proper return for the many instances he had
received of my friendship? he appeared disturbed at my question,
and answered, with much emotion, "That,&mdash;captain
Bligh,&mdash;that is the thing;&mdash;I am in hell&mdash;I am in
hell."</p>
<p>As soon as I had time to reflect, I felt an inward satisfaction
which prevented any depression of my spirits: conscious of my
integrity, and anxious solicitude for the good<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> of the
service in which I was engaged, I found my mind wonderfully
supported, and I began to conceive hopes, notwithstanding so heavy
a calamity, that I should one day be able to account to my King and
country for the misfortune.&mdash;A few hours before, my situation
had been peculiarly flattering. I had a ship in the most perfect
order, and well stored with every necessary both for service and
health: by early attention to those particulars I had, as much as
lay in my power, provided against any accident, in case I could not
get through Endeavour Straits, as well as against what might befal
me in them; add to this, the plants had been successfully preserved
in the most flourishing state: so that, upon the whole, the voyage
was two thirds completed, and the remaining part in a very
promising way; every person on board being in perfect health, to
establish which was ever amongst the principal objects of my
attention.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>It will very naturally be asked, what could be the reason for
such a revolt? in answer to which, I can only conjecture that the
mutineers had assured themselves of a more happy life among the
Otaheiteans, than they could possibly have in England; which,
joined to some female connections, have most probably been the
principal cause of the whole transaction.</p>
<p>The women at Otaheite are handsome, mild and chearful in their
manners and conversation, possessed of great sensibility, and have
sufficient delicacy to make them admired and beloved. The chiefs
were so much attached to our people, that they rather encouraged
their stay among them than otherwise, and even made them promises
of large possessions. Under these, and many other attendant
circumstances, equally desirable, it is now perhaps not so much to
be wondered at, though scarcely possible to have<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> been
foreseen, that a set of sailors, most of them void of connections,
should be led away; especially when, in addition to such powerful
inducements, they imagined it in their power to fix themselves in
the midst of plenty, on the finest island in the world, where they
need not labour, and where the allurements of dissipation are
beyond any thing that can be conceived. The utmost, however, that
any commander could have supposed to have happened is, that some of
the people would have been tempted to desert. But if it should be
asserted, that a commander is to guard against an act of mutiny and
piracy in his own ship, more than by the common rules of service,
it is as much as to say that he must sleep locked up, and when
awake, be girded with pistols.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>Desertions have happened, more or less, from many of the ships
that have been at the Society Islands; but it ever has been in the
commanders power to make the chiefs return their people: the
knowledge, therefore, that it was unsafe to desert; perhaps, first
led mine to consider with what ease so small a ship might be
surprized, and that so favourable an opportunity would never offer
to them again.</p>
<p>The secrecy of this mutiny is beyond all conception. Thirteen of
the party, who were with me, had always lived forward among the
people; yet neither they, nor the messmates of Christian, Stewart,
Haywood, and Young, had ever observed any circumstance to give them
suspicion of what was going on. With such close-planned acts of
villainy, and my mind free from any suspicion, it is not wonderful
that I have been got the better of. Perhaps, if I had had marines,
a centinel at my cabin-door might have prevented it; for I slept
with the door always open, that the officer of the watch might have
access to me on all occasions. The possi<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>bility
of such a conspiracy was ever the farthest from my thoughts. Had
their mutiny been occasioned by any grievances, either real or
imaginary, I must have discovered symptoms of their discontent,
which would have put me on my guard: but the case was far
otherwise. Christian, in particular, I was on the most friendly
terms with; that very day he was engaged to have dined with me; and
the preceding night he excused himself from supping with me, on
pretence of being unwell; for which I felt concerned, having no
suspicions of his integrity and honour.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>.</div>
<p>It now remained with me to consider what was best to be done. My
first determination was to seek a supply of bread-fruit and water
at Tofoa, and afterwards to sail for Tongataboo; and there risk a
solicitation to Poulaho, the king, to equip my boat, and grant a
supply of water and provisions, so as to enable us to reach the
East Indies.</p>
<p>The quantity of provisions I found in the boat was 150 lb. of
bread, 16 pieces of pork, each piece weighing 2 lb. 6 quarts of
rum, 6 bottles of wine, with 28 gallons of water, and four empty
barrecoes.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Wednesday 29.</div>
<p>Wednesday, April 29th<a name="FNanchor1" id=
"FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[*]</a>.
Happily the afternoon kept calm, until about 4 o'clock, when we
were so far to windward, that, with a moderate easterly breeze
which sprung up, we were able to sail. It was nevertheless dark
when we got to Tofoa, where I expected to land; but the shore
proved to be so steep and rocky, that I was obliged to give up all
thoughts of it, and keep the boat under the lee of the island with
two oars; for there was no anchorage. Having fixed on this mode of
proceeding for the night, I served<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> to every person half a
pint of grog, and each took to his rest as well as our unhappy
situation would allow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>

<p>In the morning, at dawn of day, we set off along shore in search
of landing, and about ten o'clock we discovered a stony cove at the
N W part of the island, where I dropt the grapnel within 20 yards
of the rocks. A great deal of surf ran on the shore; but, as I was
unwilling to diminish our stock of provisions, I landed Mr. Samuel,
and some others, who climbed the cliffs, and got into the country
to search for supplies. The rest of us remained at the cove, not
discovering any way to get into the country, but that by which Mr.
Samuel had proceeded. It was great consolation to me to find, that
the spirits of my people did not sink, notwithstanding our
miserable and almost hopeless situation. Towards noon Mr. Samuel
returned, with a few quarts of water, which he had found in holes;
but he had met with no spring or any prospect of a sufficient
supply in that particular, and had only seen signs of inhabitants.
As it was impossible to know how much we might be in want, I only
issued a morsel of bread, and a glass of wine, to each person for
dinner.</p>
<p>I observed the latitude of this cove to be 19&deg; 41&acute;
S.</p>
<p>This is the N W part of Tofoa, the north-westernmost of the
Friendly Islands.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Thursday 30.</div>
<p>Thursday, April 30th. Fair weather, but the wind blew so
violently from the E S E that I could not venture to sea. Our
detention therefore made it absolutely necessary to see what we
could do more for our support; for I determined, if possible, to
keep my first stock entire: I therefore weighed, and rowed along
shore, to see if any thing could be got; and at last discovered
some cocoa-nut trees, but they were on the top of high precipices,
and the surf made it danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ous landing; both one and the other
we, however, got the better of. Some, with much difficulty, climbed
the cliffs, and got about 20 cocoa-nuts, and others slung them to
ropes, by which we hauled them through the surf into the boat. This
was all that could be done here; and, as I found no place so
eligible as the one we had left to spend the night at, I returned
to the cove, and, having served a cocoa-nut to each person, we went
to rest again in the boat.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">April</span>
30.</div>
<p>At dawn of day I attempted to get to sea; but the wind and
weather proved so bad, that I was glad to return to my former
station; where, after issuing a morsel of bread and a spoonful of
rum to each person, we landed, and I went off with Mr. Nelson, Mr.
Samuel, and some others, into the country, having hauled ourselves
up the precipice by long vines, which were fixed there by the
natives for that purpose; this being the only way into the
country.</p>
<p>We found a few deserted huts, and a small plantain walk, but
little taken care of; from which we could only collect three small
bunches of plantains. After passing this place, we came to a deep
gully that led towards a mountain, near a volcano; and, as I
conceived that in the rainy season very great torrents of water
must pass through it, we hoped to find sufficient for our use
remaining in some holes of the rocks; but, after all our search,
the whole that we found was only nine gallons, in the course of the
day. We advanced within two miles of the foot of the highest
mountain in the island, on which is the volcano that is almost
constantly burning. The country near it is all covered with lava,
and has a most dreary appearance. As we had not been fortunate in
our discoveries, and saw but little to alleviate our distresses, we
filled our cocoa-nut shells with the water we found, and returned
exceedingly fati<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id=
"Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>gued and faint. When I came to the
precipice whence we were to descend into the cove, I was seized
with such a dizziness in my head, that I thought it scarce possible
to effect it: however, by the assistance of Mr. Nelson, and others,
they at last got me down, in a weak condition. Every person being
returned by noon, I gave about an ounce of pork and two plantains
to each, with half a glass of wine. I again observed the latitude
of this place 19&deg; 41&acute; south. The people who remained by
the boat I had directed to look for fish, or what they could pick
up about the rocks; but nothing eatable could be found: so that,
upon the whole, we considered ourselves on as miserable a spot of
land as could well be imagined.</p>
<p>I could not say positively, from the former knowledge I had of
this island, whether it was inhabited or not; but I knew it was
considered inferior to the other islands, and I was not certain but
that the Indians only resorted to it at particular times. I was
very anxious to ascertain this point; for, in case there had only
been a few people here, and those could have furnished us with but
very moderate supplies, the remaining in this spot to have made
preparations for our voyage, would have been preferable to the risk
of going amongst multitudes, where perhaps we might lose every
thing. A party, therefore, sufficiently strong, I determined should
go another route, as soon as the sun became lower; and they
cheerfully undertook it.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May</span>. Friday
1.</div>
<p>Friday, May the 1st: stormy weather, wind E S E and S E. About
two o'clock in the afternoon the party set out; but, after
suffering much fatigue, they returned in the evening, without any
kind of success.</p>
<p>At the head of the cove, about 150 yards from the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
water-side, was a cave; across the stony beach was about 100 yards,
and the only way from the country into the cove was that which I
have already described. The situation secured us from the danger of
being surprised, and I determined to remain on shore for the night,
with a part of my people, that the others might have more room to
rest in the boat, with the master; whom I directed to lie at a
grapnel, and be watchful, in case we should be attacked. I ordered
one plantain for each person to be boiled; and, having supped on
this scanty allowance, with a quarter of a pint of grog, and fixed
the watches for the night, those whose turn it was, laid down to
sleep in the cave; before which we kept up a good fire, yet
notwithstanding we were much troubled with flies and
musquitoes.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 1.</div>
<p>At dawn of day the party set out again in a different route, to
see what they could find; in the course of which they suffered
greatly for want of water: they, however, met with two men, a
woman, and a child; the men came with them to the cove, and brought
two cocoa-nut shells of water. I immediately made friends with
these people, and sent them away for bread-fruit, plantains, and
water. Soon after other natives came to us; and by noon I had 30 of
them about me, trading with the articles we were in want of: but I
could only afford one ounce of pork, and a quarter of a
bread-fruit, to each man for dinner, with half a pint of water; for
I was fixed in not using any of the bread or water in the boat.</p>
<p>No particular chief was yet among the natives: they were,
notwithstanding, tractable, and behaved honestly, giving the
provisions they brought for a few buttons and beads. The party who
had been out, informed me of having discovered several neat
plantations; so that it be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>came no longer a doubt of there
being settled inhabitants on the island; and for that reason I
determined to get what I could, and sail the first moment the wind
and weather would allow me to put to sea.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 1.</div>
<div class="sidenote">Saturday 2.</div>
<p>Saturday, May the 2d: stormy weather, wind E S E. It had
hitherto been a weighty consideration with me, how I was to account
to the natives for the loss of my ship: I knew they had too much
sense to be amused with a story that the ship was to join me, when
she was not in sight from the hills. I was at first doubtful
whether I should tell the real fact, or say that the ship had
overset and sunk, and that only we were saved: the latter appeared
to me to be the most proper and advantageous to us, and I
accordingly instructed my people, that we might all agree in one
story. As I expected, enquiries were made after the ship, and they
seemed readily satisfied with our account; but there did not appear
the least symptom of joy or sorrow in their faces, although I
fancied I discovered some marks of surprise. Some of the natives
were coming and going the whole afternoon, and we got enough of
bread-fruit, plantains, and cocoa-nuts for another day; but water
they only brought us about five pints. A canoe also came in with
four men, and brought a few cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit, which I
bought as I had done the rest. Nails were much enquired after, but
I would not suffer one to be shewn, as I wanted them for the use of
the boat.</p>
<p>Towards evening I had the satisfaction to find our stock of
provisions somewhat increased: but the natives did not appear to
have much to spare. What they brought was in such small quantities,
that I had no reason to hope we should be able to procure from them
sufficient to stock us for our voyage. At sun-set all the natives
left us in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
20]</a></span> quiet possession of the cove. I thought this a good
sign, and made no doubt that they would come again the next day
with a larger proportion of food and water, with which I hoped to
sail without farther delay: for if, in attempting to get to
Tongataboo, we should be blown away from the islands altogether,
there would be a larger quantity of provisions to support us
against such a misfortune.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 2.</div>
<p>At night I served a quarter of a bread-fruit and a cocoa-nut to
each person for supper; and, a good fire being made, all but the
watch went to sleep.</p>
<p>At day-break I was happy to find every one's spirits a little
revived, and that they no longer regarded me with those anxious
looks, which had constantly been directed towards me since we lost
sight of the ship: every countenance appeared to have a degree of
cheerfulness, and they all seemed determined to do their best.</p>
<p>As I doubted of water being brought by the natives, I sent a
party among the gullies in the mountains, with empty shells, to see
what they could get. In their absence the natives came about us, as
I expected, but more numerous; also two canoes came in from round
the north side of the island. In one of them was an elderly chief,
called Maccaackavow. Soon after some of our foraging party
returned, and with them came a good-looking chief, called
Eegijeefow, or perhaps more properly Eefow, Egij or Eghee,
signifying a chief. To both these men I made a present of an old
shirt and a knife, and I soon found they either had seen me, or had
heard of my being at Annamooka. They knew I had been with captain
Cook, who they enquired after, and also captain Clerk. They were
very inquisitive to know in what manner I had<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> lost my
ship. During this conversation a young man appeared, whom I
remembered to have seen at Annamooka, called Nageete: he expressed
much pleasure at seeing me. I now enquired after Poulaho and
Feenow, who, they said, were at Tongataboo; and Eefow agreed to
accompany me thither, if I would wait till the weather moderated.
The readiness and affability of this man gave me much
satisfaction.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 2.</div>
<p>This, however, was but of short duration, for the natives began
to increase in number, and I observed some symptoms of a design
against us; soon after they attempted to haul the boat on shore,
when I threatened Eefow with a cutlass, to induce him to make them
desist; which they did, and every thing became quiet again. My
people, who had been in the mountains, now returned with about
three gallons of water. I kept buying up the little bread-fruit
that was brought to us, and likewise some spears to arm my men
with, having only four cutlasses, two of which were in the boat. As
we had no means of improving our situation, I told our people I
would wait until sun-set, by which time, perhaps, something might
happen in our favour: that if we attempted to go at present, we
must fight our way through, which we could do more advantageously
at night; and that in the mean time we would endeavour to get off
to the boat what we had bought. The beach was now lined with the
natives, and we heard nothing but the knocking of stones together,
which they had in each hand. I knew very well this was the sign of
an attack. It being now noon, I served a cocoa-nut and a
bread-fruit to each person for dinner, and gave some to the chiefs,
with whom I continued to appear intimate and friendly.
They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
22]</a></span> frequently importuned me to sit down, but I as
constantly refused; for it occurred both to Mr. Nelson and myself,
that they intended to seize hold of me, if I gave them such an
opportunity. Keeping, therefore, constantly on our guard, we were
suffered to eat our uncomfortable meal in some quietness.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 2.</div>
<div class="sidenote">Sunday 3.</div>
<p>Sunday, 3d May, fresh gales at S E and E S E, varying to the N E
in the latter part, with a storm of wind.</p>
<p>After dinner we began by little and little to get our things
into the boat, which was a troublesome business, on account of the
surf. I carefully watched the motions of the natives, who still
increased in number, and found that, instead of their intention
being to leave us, fires were made, and places fixed on for their
stay during the night. Consultations were also held among them, and
every thing assured me we should be attacked. I sent orders to the
master, that when he saw us coming down, he should keep the boat
close to the shore, that we might the more readily embark.</p>
<p>I had my journal on shore with me, writing the occurrences in
the cave, and in sending it down to the boat it was nearly snatched
away, but for the timely assistance of the gunner.</p>
<p>The sun was near setting when I gave the word, on which every
person, who was on shore with me, boldly took up his proportion of
things, and carried them to the boat. The chiefs asked me if I
would not stay with them all night, I said, "No, I never sleep out
of my boat; but in the morning we will again trade with you, and I
shall remain until the weather is moderate, that we may go, as we
have agreed, to see Poulaho, at Tongataboo." Maccaackavow then got
up, and said, "You will not sleep<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> on shore? then Mattie,"
(which directly signifies we will kill you) and he left me. The
onset was now preparing; every one, as I have described before,
kept knocking stones together, and Eefow quitted me. We had now all
but two or three things in the boat, when I took Nageete by the
hand, and we walked down the beach, every one in a silent kind of
horror.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 3.</div>
<p>When I came to the boat, and was seeing the people embark,
Nageete wanted me to stay to speak to Eefow; but I found he was
encouraging them to the attack, and I determined, had it then
begun, to have killed him for his treacherous behaviour. I ordered
the carpenter not to quit me until the other people were in the
boat. Nageete, finding I would not stay, loosed himself from my
hold and went off, and we all got into the boat except one man,
who, while I was getting on board, quitted it, and ran up the beach
to cast the stern fast off, notwithstanding the master and others
called to him to return, while they were hauling me out of the
water.</p>
<p>I was no sooner in the boat than the attack began by about 200
men; the unfortunate poor man who had run up the beach was knocked
down, and the stones flew like a shower of shot. Many Indians got
hold of the stern rope, and were near hauling us on shore, and
would certainly have done it if I had not had a knife in my pocket,
with which I cut the rope. We then hauled off to the grapnel, every
one being more or less hurt. At this time I saw five of the natives
about the poor man they had killed, and two of them were beating
him about the head with stones in their hands.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. May 3</div>
<p>We had no time to reflect, before, to my surprise,
they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
24]</a></span> filled their canoes with stones, and twelve men came
off after us to renew the attack, which they did so effectually as
nearly to disable all of us. Our grapnel was foul, but Providence
here assisted us; the fluke broke, and we got to our oars, and
pulled to sea. They, however, could paddle round us, so that we
were obliged to sustain the attack without being able to return it,
except with such stones as lodged in the boat, and in this I found
we were very inferior to them. We could not close, because our boat
was lumbered and heavy, and that they knew very well: I therefore
adopted the expedient of throwing overboard some cloaths, which
they lost time in picking up; and, as it was now almost dark, they
gave over the attack, and returned towards the shore, leaving us to
reflect on our unhappy situation.</p>
<p>The poor man I lost was John Norton: this was his second voyage
with me as a quarter-master, and his worthy character made me
lament his loss very much. He has left an aged parent, I am told,
whom he supported.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. May 3.</div>
<p>I once before sustained an attack of a similar nature, with a
smaller number of Europeans, against a multitude of Indians; it was
after the death of captain Cook, on the Morai at Owhyhee, where I
was left by lieutenant King: yet, notwithstanding, I did not
conceive that the power of a man's arm could throw stones, from two
to eight pounds weight, with such force and exactness as these
people did. Here unhappily I was without arms, and the Indians knew
it; but it was a fortunate circumstance that they did not begin to
attack us in the cave: in that case our destruction must have been
inevitable, and we should have had nothing left for it but to die
as bravely as we could, fighting close together; in which I found
every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
25]</a></span> one cheerfully disposed to join me. This appearance
of resolution deterred them, supposing they could effect their
purpose without risk after we were in the boat.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:800px;"><a href=
"e00085-images/map3-lg.png"><img name="map3" id="map3" src=
"e00085-images/map3-sml.png" alt="Chart of Bligh's Islands"></a>
<p class="caption">Chart of Bligh's Islands</p>
</div>
<p>Taking this as a sample of the dispositions of the Indians,
there was little reason to expect much benefit if I persevered in
my intention of visiting Poulaho; for I considered their good
behaviour hitherto to proceed from a dread of our fire-arms, which,
now knowing us destitute of, would cease; and, even supposing our
lives not in danger, the boat and every thing we had would most
probably be taken from us, and thereby all hopes precluded of ever
being able to return to our native country.</p>
<p>We were now sailing along the west side of the island Tofoa, and
my mind was employed in considering what was best to be done, when
I was solicited by all hands to take them towards home: and, when I
told them no hopes of relief for us remained, but what I might find
at New Holland, until I came to Timor, a distance of full 1200
leagues, where was a Dutch settlement, but in what part of the
island I knew not, they all agreed to live on one ounce of bread,
and a quarter of a pint of water, per day. Therefore, after
examining our stock of provisions, and recommending this as a
sacred promise for ever to their memory, we bore away across a sea,
where the navigation is but little known, in a small boat,
twenty-three feet long from stern to stern, deep laden with
eighteen men; without a chart, and nothing but my own recollection
and general knowledge of the situation of places, assisted by a
book of latitudes and longitudes, to guide us. I was happy,
however, to see every one better satisfied with our situation in
this particular than myself.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. May 3.</div>
<p>Our stock of provisions consisted of about one hundred and fifty
pounds of bread, twenty-eight gallons of water, twenty<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> pounds
of pork, three bottles of wine, and five quarts of rum. The
difference between this and the quantity we had on leaving the
ship, was principally owing to loss in the bustle and confusion of
the attack. A few cocoa-nuts were in the boat, and some
bread-fruit, but the latter was trampled to pieces.</p>
<p>It was about eight o'clock at night when I bore away under a
reefed lug fore-sail: and, having divided the people into watches,
and got the boat in a little order, we returned God thanks for our
miraculous preservation, and, fully confident of his gracious
support, I found my mind more at ease than for some time past.</p>
<p>At day-break the gale increased; the sun rose very fiery and
red, a sure indication of a severe gale of wind. At eight it blew a
violent storm, and the sea ran very high, so that between the seas
the sail was becalmed, and when on the top of the sea it was too
much to have set: but I was obliged to carry to it, for we were now
in very imminent danger and distress, the sea curling over the
stern of the boat, which obliged us to bale with all our might. A
situation more distressing has, perhaps, seldom been
experienced.</p>
<p>Our bread was in bags, and in danger of being spoiled by the
wet: to be starved to death was inevitable, if this could not be
prevented: I therefore began to examine what cloaths there were in
the boat, and what other things could be spared; and, having
determined that only two suits should be kept for each person, the
rest was thrown overboard, with some rope and spare sails, which
lightened the boat considerably, and we had more room to bale the
water out. Fortunately the carpenter had a good chest in the boat,
into which I put the bread the first favourable<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> moment.
His tool chest also was cleared, and the tools stowed in the bottom
of the boat, so that this became a second convenience.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 3.</div>
<p>I now served a tea-spoonful of rum to each person, (for we were
very wet and cold) with a quarter of a bread-fruit, which was
scarce eatable, for dinner; but our engagement was now strictly to
be carried into execution, and I was fully determined to make what
provisions I had last eight weeks, let the daily proportion be ever
so small.</p>
<p>At noon I considered my course and distance from Tofoa to be W N
W 3/4 W. 86 miles, my latitude 19&deg; 27&acute; S. I directed my
course to the W N W, that I might get a sight of the islands called
Feejee, if they laid in the direction the natives had pointed out
to me.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Monday 4.</div>
<p>Monday, 4th May. This day the weather was very severe, it blew a
storm from N E to E S E. The sea ran higher than yesterday, and the
fatigue of baling, to keep the boat from filling, was exceedingly
great. We could do nothing more than keep before the sea; in the
course of which the boat performed so wonderfully well, that I no
longer dreaded any danger in that respect. But among the hardships
we were to undergo, that of being constantly wet was not the least:
the nights were very cold, and at day-light our limbs were so
benumbed, that we could scarce find the use of them. At this time I
served a tea-spoonful of rum to each person, which we all found
great benefit from.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 4.</div>
<p>As I have mentioned before, I determined to keep to the W N W,
until I got more to the northward, for I not only expected to have
better weather, but to see the Feejee Islands, as I have often
understood, from the natives of An<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>namooka, that they lie in
that direction; Captain Cook likewise considers them to be N W by W
from Tongataboo. Just before noon we discovered a small flat island
of a moderate height, bearing W S W, 4 or 5 leagues. I observed in
latitude 18&deg; 58&acute; S; our longitude, by account, 3&deg;
4&acute; W from the island Tofoa, having made a N 72&deg; W course,
distance 95 miles, since yesterday noon. I divided five small
cocoa-nuts for our dinner, and every one was satisfied.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Tuesday 5.</div>
<p>Tuesday, 5th May. Towards the evening the gale considerably
abated. Wind S E.</p>
<p>A little after noon, other islands appeared, and at a quarter
past three o'clock we could count eight, bearing from S round by
the west to N W by N; those to the south, which were the nearest,
being four leagues distant from us.</p>
<p>I kept my course to the N W by W, between the islands, and at
six o'clock discovered three other small islands to the N W, the
westernmost of them bore N W 1/2 W 7 leagues. I steered to the
southward of these islands, a W N W course for the night, under a
reefed sail.</p>
<p>Served a few broken pieces of bread-fruit for supper, and
performed prayers.</p>
<p>The night turned out fair, and, having had tolerable rest, every
one seemed considerably better in the morning, and contentedly
breakfasted on a few pieces of yams that were found in the boat.
After breakfast we prepared a chest for our bread, and it got
secured: but unfortunately a great deal was damaged and rotten;
this nevertheless we were glad to keep for use.</p>
<p>I had hitherto been scarcely able to keep any account of our
run; but we now equipped ourselves a little better, by getting a
log-line marked, and, having practised at<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
counting seconds; several could do it with some degree of
exactness.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 5.</div>
<p>The islands I have passed lie between the latitude of 19&deg;
5&acute; S and 18&deg; 19&acute; S, and, according to my reckoning,
from 3&deg; 17&acute; to 3&deg; 46&acute; W longitude from the
island Tofoa: the largest may be about six leagues in circuit; but
it is impossible for me to be very exact. To show where they are to
be found again is the most my situation enabled me to do. The
sketch I have made, will give a comparative view of their extent. I
believe all the larger islands are inhabited, as they appeared very
fertile.</p>
<p>At noon I observed, in latitude 18&deg; 10&acute; S, and
considered my course and distance from yesterday noon, N W by W 1/2
W, 94 miles; longitude, by account, from Tofoa 4&deg; 29&acute;
W.</p>
<p>For dinner, I served some of the damaged bread, and a quarter of
a pint of water.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Wednesday 6.</div>
<p>Wednesday, 6th May. Fresh breezes E N E, and fair weather, but
very hazy.</p>
<p>About six o'clock this afternoon I discovered two islands, one
bearing W by S 6 leagues, and the other N W by N 8 leagues; I kept
to windward of the northernmost, and passing it by 10 o'clock, I
resumed my course to the N W and W N W. At day-light in the morning
I discovered a number of other islands from S S E to the W, and
round to N E by E; between those in the N W I determined to pass.
At noon a small sandy island or key, 2 miles distant from me, bore
from E to S 3/4 W. I had passed ten islands, the largest of which
may be 6 or 8 leagues in circuit. Much larger lands appeared in the
S W and N by W, between which I directed my course. Latitude
observed 17&deg; 17&acute; S; course since yesterday noon N 50&deg;
W; distance 84 miles; longitude made, by account, 5&deg; 37&acute;
W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg

<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 6.</div>
<p>Our supper, breakfast, and dinner, consisted of a quarter of a
pint of cocoa-nut milk, and the meat, which did not exceed two
ounces to each person: it was received very contentedly, but we
suffered great drought. I dared not to land, as we had no arms, and
were less capable to defend ourselves than we were at Tofoa.</p>
<p>To keep an account of the boat's run was rendered difficult,
from being constantly wet with the sea breaking over us; but, as we
advanced towards the land, the sea became smoother, and I was
enabled to form a sketch of the islands, which will serve to give a
general knowledge of their extent. Those I have been near are
fruitful and hilly, some very mountainous, and all of a good
height.</p>
<p>To our great joy we hooked a fish, but we were miserably
disappointed by its being lost in getting into the boat.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Thursday 7.</div>
<p>Thursday, 7th May. Variable weather and cloudy, wind
north-easterly, and calms. I continued my course to the N W,
between the islands, which, by the evening, appeared of
considerable extent, woody and mountainous. At sun-set the
southernmost bore from S to S W by W, and the northernmost from N
by W 1/2 W to N E 1/2 E. At six o'clock I was nearly mid-way
between them, and about 6 leagues distant from each shore, when I
fell in with a coral bank, where I had only four feet water,
without the least break on it, or ruffle of the sea to give us
warning. I could only see that it extended about a mile on each
side of us; but, as it is probable that it extends much farther, I
have laid it down so in my sketch.</p>
<p>I now directed my course W by N for the night, and served to
each person an ounce of the damaged bread, and a quarter of a pint
of water, for supper.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. May 7.</div>
<p>It may readily be supposed, that our lodgings were
very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg
31]</a></span> miserable and confined, and I had only in my power
to remedy the latter defect by putting ourselves at watch and
watch; so that one half always sat up while the other lay down on
the boat's bottom, or upon a chest, with nothing to cover us but
the heavens. Our limbs were dreadfully cramped, for we could not
stretch them out, and the nights were so cold, and we so constantly
wet, that after a few hours sleep we could scarce move.</p>
<p>At dawn of day we again discovered land from W S W to W N W, and
another island N N W, the latter a high round lump of but little
extent; and I could see the southern land that I had passed in the
night. Being very wet and cold, I served a spoonful of rum and a
morsel of bread for breakfast.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 7.</div>
<p>As I advanced towards the land in the west, it appeared in a
variety of forms; some extraordinary high rocks, and the country
agreeably interspersed with high and low land, covered in some
places with wood. Off the N E part lay two small rocky islands,
between which and the island to the N E, 4 leagues apart, I
directed my course; but a lee current very unexpectedly set us very
near to the shore, and I could only get clear of it by rowing,
passing close to the reef that surrounded the rocky isles. We now
observed two large sailing canoes coming swiftly after us along
shore, and, being apprehensive of their intentions, we rowed with
some anxiety, being sensible of our weak and defenceless state. It
was now noon, calm and cloudy weather, my latitude is therefore
doubtful to 3 or 4 miles; my course since yesterday noon N 56 W,
distance 79 miles; latitude by account, 16&deg; 29&acute; S, and
longitude by account, from Tofoa, 6&deg; 46&acute; W. Being
constantly wet, it was with the utmost difficulty I could open a
book to write, and I am sensible that what I have<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> done
can only serve to point out where these lands are to be found
again, and give an idea of their extent.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Friday 8.</div>
<p>Friday, 8th May. All the afternoon the weather was very rainy,
attended with thunder and lightning. Wind N N E.</p>
<p>Only one of the canoes gained upon us, and by three o'clock in
the afternoon was not more than two miles off, when she gave over
chase.</p>
<p>If I may judge from the sail of the vessels, they are the same
as at the Friendly Islands, and the nearness of their situation
leaves little room to doubt of their being the same kind of people.
Whether these canoes had any hostile intention against us is a
matter of doubt; perhaps we might have benefited by an intercourse
with them, but in our defenceless situation it would have been
risking too much to make the experiment.</p>
<p>I imagine these to be the islands called Feejee, as their
extent, direction, and distance from the Friendly Islands, answers
to the description given of them by those Islanders. Heavy rain
came on at four o'clock, when every person did their utmost to
catch some water, and we increased our stock to 34 gallons, besides
quenching our thirst for the first time since we had been at sea;
but an attendant consequence made us pass the night very miserably,
for, being extremely wet, and no dry things to shift or cover us,
we experienced cold and shiverings scarce to be conceived. Most
fortunately for us, the forenoon turned out fair, and we stripped
and dried our cloaths. The allowance I issued to-day, was an ounce
and a half of pork, a tea-spoonful of rum, half a pint of cocoa-nut
milk, and an ounce of bread. The rum, though so small in quantity,
was of the greatest service. A fishing-line was generally towing,
and we saw great numbers of fish, but could never catch one.</p>
<p>At noon, I observed, in latitude 16&deg; 4&acute; S, and found I
had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
33]</a></span> made a course, from yesterday noon, N 62&deg; W,
distance 62 miles; longitude, by account, from Tofoa, 7&deg;
42&acute; W.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span> 8.</div>
<p>The land I passed yesterday, and the day before, is a group of
islands, 14 or 16 in number, lying between the latitude of 16&deg;
26&acute; S and 17&deg; 57&acute; S, and in longitude, by my
account, 4&deg; 47&acute; to 7&deg; 17&acute; W from Tofoa; three
of these islands are very large, having from 30 to 40 leagues of
sea-coast.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Saturday 9.</div>
<p>Saturday, 9th May. Fine weather, and light winds from the N E to
E by S.</p>
<p>This afternoon we cleaned out the boat, and it employed us till
sun-set to get every thing dry and in order. Hitherto I had issued
the allowance by guess, but I now got a pair of scales, made with
two cocoa-nut shells; and, having accidentally some pistol-balls in
the boat, 25<a name="FNanchor2" id="FNanchor2"></a><a href=
"#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[*]</a> of which weighed one pound,
or 16 ounces, I adopted one, as the proportion of weight that each
person should receive of bread at the times I served it. I also
amused all hands, with describing the situation of New Guinea and
New Holland, and gave them every information in my power, that in
case any accident happened to me, those who survived might have
some idea of what they were about, and be able to find their way to
Timor, which at present they knew nothing of, more than the name,
and some not that.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote2" id="Footnote2"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor2"><span class="label">[*]</span></a> It weighed 272
grains.</p>
</div>
<p>At night I served a quarter of a pint of water, and half an
ounce of bread, for supper. In the morning, a quarter of a pint of
cocoa-nut milk, and some of the decayed bread, for breakfast; and
for dinner, I divided the meat of four cocoa-nuts, with the
remainder of the rotten bread, which was only eatable by such
distressed people.</p>
<p>At noon, I observed the latitude to be 15&deg; 47&acute; S;
course since yesterday N 75&deg; W; distant 64 miles; longitude
made, by account, 8&deg; 45&acute; W.<span class='pagenum'><a name=

<div class="sidenote">1789 <span class="smcap">May</span> 10.</div>
<div class="sidenote">Sunday 10.</div>
<p>Sunday, May the 10th. The first part of this day fine weather;
but after sun-set it became squally, with hard rain, thunder, and
lightning, and a fresh gale; wind E by S, S E, and S S E.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I got fitted a pair of shrouds for each mast
and contrived a canvass weather cloth round the boat, and raised
the quarters about nine inches, by nailing on the seats of the
stern sheets, which proved of great benefit to us.</p>
<p>About nine o'clock in the evening, the clouds began to gather,
and we had a prodigious fall of rain, with severe thunder and
lightning. By midnight we had caught about twenty gallons of water.
Being miserably wet and cold, I served to each person a
tea-spoonful of rum, to enable them to bear with their distressed
situation. The weather continued extremely bad, and the wind
increased; we spent a very miserable night, without sleep, but such
as could be got in the midst of rain. The day brought us no relief
but its light. The sea was constantly breaking over us, which kept
two persons baling; and we had no choice how to steer, for we were
obliged to keep before the waves to avoid filling the boat.</p>
<p>The allowance which I now regularly served to each person was
one 25th of a pound of bread, and a quarter of a pint of water, at
sun-set, eight in the morning, and at noon. To-day I gave about
half an ounce of pork for dinner, which, though any moderate person
would have considered but a mouthful, was divided into three or
four.</p>
<p>The rain abated towards noon, and I observed the latitude to be
15&deg; 17&acute; S; course N 67&deg; W; distance 78 miles;
longitude made 10&deg; W.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Monday 11.</div>
<p>Monday, May the 11th. Strong gales from S S E to S E, and very
squally weather, with a high breaking sea, so that we were
miserably wet, and suffered great cold in the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> night.
In the morning at day-break I served to every person a tea-spoonful
of rum, our limbs being so cramped that we could scarce feel the
use of them. Our situation was now extremely dangerous, the sea
frequently running over our stern, which kept us baling with all
our strength.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
11.</div>
<p>At noon the sun appeared, which gave us as much pleasure as in a
winter's day in England. I issued the 25th of a pound of bread, and
a quarter of a pint of water, as yesterday. Latitude observed
14&deg; 50&acute; S; course N 71&deg; W; distance 102 miles; and
longitude, by account, 11&deg; 39&acute; W. from Tofoa.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Tuesday 12.</div>
<p>Tuesday, May the 12th. Strong gales at S E, with much rain and
dark dismal weather, moderating towards noon and wind varying to
the N E.</p>
<p>Having again experienced a dreadful night, the day showed to me
a poor miserable set of beings full of wants, without any thing to
relieve them. Some complained of a great pain in their bowels, and
all of having but very little use of their limbs. What sleep we got
was scarce refreshing, we being covered with sea and rain. Two
persons were obliged to be always baling the water out of the boat.
I served a spoonful of rum at day-dawn, and the usual allowance of
bread and water, for supper, breakfast, and dinner.</p>
<p>At noon it was almost calm, no sun to be seen, and some of us
shivering with cold. Course since yesterday W by N; distance 89
miles; latitude, by account, 14&deg; 33&acute; S; longitude made
13&deg; 9&acute; W. The direction of my course is to pass to the
northward of the New Hebrides.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Wednesday 13.</div>
<p>Wednesday, May the 13th. Very squally weather, wind southerly.
As I saw no prospect of getting our cloaths dried, I recommended it
to every one to strip, and wring them through the salt water, by
which means they received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36"
id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> a warmth, that, while wet with
rain, they could not have, and we were less liable to suffer from
colds or rheumatic complaints.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
13.</div>
<p>In the afternoon we saw a kind of fruit on the water, which Mr.
Nelson knew to be the Barringtonia of Forster, and, as I saw the
same again in the morning, and some men of war birds, I was led to
believe we were not far from land.</p>
<p>We continued constantly shipping seas, and baling, and were very
wet and cold in the night; but I could not afford the allowance of
rum at day-break. The twenty-fifth of a pound of bread, and water I
served as usual. At noon I had a sight of the sun, latitude 14&deg;
17&acute; S; course W by N 79 miles; longitude made 14&deg;
28&acute; W.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Thursday 14.</div>
<p>Thursday, May the 14th. Fresh breezes and cloudy weather, wind
southerly. Constantly shipping water, and very wet, suffering much
cold and shiverings in the night. Served the usual allowance of
bread and water, three times a day.</p>
<p>At six in the morning, we saw land, from S W by S eight leagues,
to N W by W 3/4 W six leagues, which I soon after found to be four
islands, all of them high and remarkable. At noon discovered a
rocky island N W by N four leagues, and another island W eight
leagues, so that the whole were six in number; the four I had first
seen bearing from S 1/2 E to S W by S; our distance three leagues
from the nearest island. My latitude observed was 13&deg; 29&acute;
S, and longitude, by account, from Tofoa, 15&deg; 49&acute; W;
course since yesterday noon N 63&deg; W; distance 89 miles.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Friday 15.</div>
<p>Friday, May the 15th. Fresh gales at S E, and gloomy weather
with rain, and a very high sea; two people constantly employed
baling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg
37]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
15.</div>
<p>At four in the afternoon I passed the westernmost island. At one
in the morning I discovered another, bearing W N W, five leagues
distance, and at eight o'clock I saw it for the last time, bearing
N E seven leagues. A number of gannets, boobies, and men of war
birds were seen.</p>
<p>These islands lie between the latitude of 13&deg; 16&acute; S
and 14&deg; 10&acute; S: their longitude, according to my
reckoning, 15&deg; 51&acute; to 17&deg; 6&acute; W from the island
Tofoa<a name="FNanchor3" id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3"
class="fnanchor">[*]</a>. The largest island may be twenty leagues
in circuit, the others five or six. The easternmost is the smallest
island, and most remarkable, having a high sugar-loaf hill.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote3" id="Footnote3"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor3"><span class="label">[*]</span></a> By making a
proportional allowance for the error afterwards found in the dead
reckoning, I estimate the longitude of these islands to be from
167&deg; 17&acute; E to 168&deg; 34&acute; E from Greenwich.</p>
</div>
<p>The sight of these islands served but to increase the misery of
our situation. We were very little better than starving, with
plenty in view; yet to attempt procuring any relief was attended
with so much danger, that prolonging of life, even in the midst of
misery, was thought preferable, while there remained hopes of being
able to surmount our hardships. For my own part, I consider the
general run of cloudy and wet weather to be a blessing of
Providence. Hot weather would have caused us to have died with
thirst; and perhaps being so constantly covered with rain or sea
protected us from that dreadful calamity.</p>
<p>As I had nothing to assist my memory, I could not determine
whether these islands were a part of the New Hebrides or not: I
believed them perfectly a new discovery, which I have since found
to be the case; but, though they were not seen either by Monsieur
Bougainville or Captain Cook, they are so nearly in the
neighbourhood of the New Hebrides, that they must be considered as
part of the same group. They are fertile, and inhabited, as I saw
smoke in several places.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id=

<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>

<div class="sidenote">Saturday 16.</div>
<p>Saturday, May the 16th. Fresh gales from the S E, and rainy
weather. The night was very dark, not a star to be seen to steer
by, and the sea breaking constantly over us. I found it necessary
to act as much as possible against the southerly winds, to prevent
being driven too near New Guinea; for in general we were forced to
keep so much before the sea, that if we had not, at intervals of
moderate weather, steered a more southerly course, we should
inevitably, from a continuance of the gales, have been thrown in
sight of that coast: in which case there would most probably have
been an end to our voyage.</p>
<p>In addition to our miserable allowance of one 25th of a pound of
bread, and a quarter of a pint of water, I issued for dinner about
an ounce of salt pork to each person. I was often solicited for
this pork, but I considered it better to give it in small
quantities than to use all at once or twice, which would have been
done if I had allowed it.</p>
<p>At noon I observed, in 13&deg; 33&acute; S; longitude made from
Tofoa, 19&deg; 27&acute; W; course N 82&deg; W; distance 101 miles.
The sun gave us hopes of drying our wet cloaths.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sunday 17.</div>
<p>Sunday, May the 17th. The sunshine was but of short duration. We
had strong breezes at S E by S, and dark gloomy weather, with
storms of thunder, lightning, and rain. The night was truly
horrible, and not a star to be seen; so that our steerage was
uncertain. At dawn of day I found every person complaining, and
some of them soliciting extra allowance; but I positively refused
it. Our situation was extremely miserable; always wet, and
suffering extreme cold in the night, without the least shelter from
the weather. Being constantly obliged to bale, to keep the boat
from filling, was, perhaps, not to be reckoned an evil, as it gave
us exercise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id=
"Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
17.</div>
<p>The little rum I had was of great service to us; when our nights
were particularly distressing, I generally served a tea-spoonful or
two to each person: and it was always joyful tidings when they
heard of my intentions.</p>
<p>At noon a water-spout was very near on board of us. I issued an
ounce of pork, in addition to the allowance of bread and water; but
before we began to eat, every person stript and wrung their cloaths
through the sea-water, which we found warm and refreshing. Course
since yesterday noon W S W; distance 100 miles; latitude, by
account, 14&deg; 11&acute; S, and longitude made 21&deg; 3&acute;
W.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Monday 18.</div>
<p>Monday, May the 18th. Fresh gales with rain, and a dark dismal
night, wind S E; the sea constantly breaking over us, and nothing
but the wind and sea to direct our steerage. I now fully determined
to make New Holland, to the southward of Endeavour straits,
sensible that it was necessary to preserve such a situation as
would make a southerly wind a fair one; that I might range the
reefs until an opening should be found into smooth water, and we
the sooner be able to pick up some refreshments.</p>
<p>In the morning the rain abated, when we stripped, and wrung our
cloaths through the sea-water, as usual, which refreshed us
wonderfully. Every person complained of violent pain in their
bones: I was only surprised that no one was yet laid up. Served one
25th of a pound of bread, and a quarter of a pint of water, at
supper, breakfast, and dinner, as customary.</p>
<p>At noon I deduced my situation, by account, for we had no
glimpse of the sun, to be in latitude 14&deg; 52&acute; S; course
since yesterday noon W S W 106 miles; longitude made from Tofoa
22&deg; 45&acute; W. Saw many boobies and noddies, a sign of being
in the neighbourhood of land.<span class='pagenum'><a name=

<p>Tuesday, May the 19th. Fresh gales at E N E, with heavy rain,
and dark gloomy weather, and no sight of the sun. We past this day
miserably wet and cold, covered with rain and sea, from which we
had no relief, but at intervals by pulling off our cloaths and
wringing them through the sea water. In the night we had very
severe lightning, but otherwise it was so dark that we could not
see each other. The morning produced many complaints on the
severity of the weather, and I would gladly have issued my
allowance of rum, if it had not appeared to me that we were to
suffer much more, and that it was necessary to preserve the little
I had, to give relief at a time we might be less able to bear such
hardships; but, to make up for it, I served out about half an ounce
of pork to each person, with the common allowance of bread and
water, for dinner. All night and day we were obliged to bale
without intermission.</p>
<p>At noon it was very bad weather and constant rain; latitude, by
account, 14&deg; 37&acute; S; course since yesterday N 81&deg; W;

<p>At dawn of day, some of my people seemed half dead: our
appearances were horrible; and I could look no way, but I caught
the eye of some one in distress. Extreme hunger was now too
evident, but no one suffered from thirst, nor had we much
inclination to drink, that desire, perhaps, being satisfied through
the skin. The little sleep we got was in the midst of water, and we
constantly awoke with severe cramps and pains in our bones. This
morning I served about two tea-spoonfuls of rum to each person, and
the allowance of bread and water, as usual. At noon the sun broke
out, and revived every one. I found we were<span class=

<p>Thursday, May the 21st. Fresh gales, and heavy showers of rain.
Wind E N E.</p>
<p>Our distresses were now very great, and we were so covered with
rain and salt water, that we could scarcely see. Sleep, though we
longed for it, afforded no comfort: for my own part, I almost lived
without it: we suffered extreme cold, and every one dreaded the
approach of night. About two o'clock in the morning we were
overwhelmed with a deluge of rain. It fell so heavy that we were
afraid it would fill the boat, and were obliged to bale with all
our might. At dawn of day, I served a large allowance of rum.
Towards noon the rain abated and the sun shone, but we were
miserably cold and wet, the sea breaking so constantly over us,
that, notwithstanding the heavy rain, we had not been able to add
to our stock of fresh water. The usual allowance of one 25th of a
pound of bread and water was served at evening, morning, and noon.
Latitude, by observation, 14&deg; 29&acute; S, and longitude made,
by account, from Tofoa, 27&deg; 25&acute; W; course, since
yesterday noon, N 78&deg; W, 99 miles. I now considered myself on a
meridian with the east part of New Guinea, and about 65 leagues
distant from the coast of New Holland.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Friday 22.</div>
<p>Friday, May the 22nd. Strong gales from E S E to S S E, a high
sea, and dark dismal night.</p>
<p>Our situation this day was extremely calamitous. We were obliged
to take the course of the sea, running right before it, and
watching with the utmost care, as the least error in the helm would
in a moment have been our destruction. The sea was continually
breaking all over us; but, as we suffered not such cold as when wet
with the rain, I only served the common allowance of bread and
water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg

<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>

<p>At noon it blew very hard, and the foam of the sea kept running
over our stern and quarters; I however got propped up, and made an
observation of the latitude, in 14&deg; 17&acute; S; course N

<div class="sidenote">Saturday 23.</div>
<p>Saturday, May the 23d. Strong gales with very hard squalls, and
rain; wind S E, and S S E.</p>
<p>The misery we suffered this day exceeded the preceding. The
night was dreadful. The sea flew over us with great force, and kept
us baling with horror and anxiety. At dawn of day I found every one
in a most distressed condition, and I now began to fear that
another such a night would put an end to the lives of several who
seemed no longer able to support such sufferings. Every one
complained of severe pains in their bones; but these were
alleviated, in some degree, by an allowance of two tea-spoonfuls of
rum; after drinking which, having wrung our cloaths, and taken our
breakfast of bread and water, we became a little refreshed.</p>
<p>Towards noon it became fair weather; but with very little
abatement of the gale, and the sea remained equally high. With
great difficulty I observed the latitude to be 13&deg; 44&acute; S;
course N 74&deg; W; distance 116 miles since yesterday; longitude
made 31&deg; 32&acute; W from Tofoa.</p>

<p>Towards the evening the weather looked much better, which
rejoiced all hands, so that they eat their scanty allowance with
more satisfaction than for some time past. The night also was fair;
but, being always wet with the sea, we suffered much from the cold.
A fine morning, I had the pleasure to see, produce some chearful
countenances. Towards noon the weather improved, and, the first
time for 15<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg
43]</a></span> days past, we found a little warmth from the sun. We
stripped, and hung our cloaths up to dry, which were by this time
become so thread-bare, that they would not keep out either wet or
cold.</p>
<p>At noon I observed in latitude 13&deg; 33&acute; S; longitude,
by account, from Tofoa 33&deg; 28&acute; W; course N 84&deg; W;
distance 114 miles. With the usual allowance of bread and water for
dinner, I served an ounce of pork to each person.</p>

<p>Monday, May the 25th. Fresh gales and fair weather. Wind S S

<p>This afternoon we had many birds about us, which are never seen
far from land, such as boobies and noddies.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Allowance lessened.</div>
<p>About three o'clock the sea began to run fair, and we shipped
but little water, I therefore determined to know the exact quantity
of bread I had left; and on examining found, according to my
present issues, sufficient for 29 days allowance. In the course of
this time I hoped to be at Timor; but, as that was very uncertain,
and perhaps after all we might be obliged to go to Java, I
determined to proportion my issues to six weeks. I was apprehensive
that this would be ill received, and that it would require my
utmost resolution to enforce it; for, small as the quantity was
which I intended to take away, for our future good, yet it might
appear to my people like robbing them of life, and some, who were
less patient than their companions, I expected would very ill brook
it. I however represented it so essentially necessary to guard
against delays in our voyage by contrary winds, or other causes,
promising to enlarge upon the allowance as we got on, that it was
readily agreed to. I therefore fixed, that every person should
receive one 25th of a pound of bread for breakfast, and one 25th of
a pound for dinner; so that by omitting the proportion for supper,
I had 43 days allowance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id=

<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
25.</div>
<p>At noon some noddies came so near to us, that one of them was
caught by hand. This bird is about the size of a small pigeon. I
divided it, with its entrails, into 18 portions, and by the method
of, Who shall have this<a name="FNanchor4" id=
"FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[*]</a>? it
was distributed with the allowance of bread and water for dinner,
and eat up bones and all, with salt water for sauce. I observed the
latitude 13&deg; 32&acute; S; longitude made 35&deg; 19&acute; W;
and course N 89&deg; W; distance 108 miles.</p>
<div class="footnote">

his back on the object that is to be divided: another then points
separately to the portions, at each of them asking aloud, "Who
shall have this?" to which the first answers by naming somebody.
This impartial method of division gives every man an equal chance
of the best share.</p>

<p>Tuesday, May the 26th. Fresh gales at S S E, and fine
weather.</p>
<p>In the evening we saw several boobies flying so near to us, that
we caught one of them by hand. This bird is as large as a good
duck; like the noddy, it has received its name from seamen, for
suffering itself to be caught on the masts and yards of ships. They
are the most presumptive proofs of being in the neighbourhood of
land of any sea-fowl we are acquainted with. I directed the bird to
be killed for supper, and the blood to be given to three of the
people who were the most distressed for want of food. The body,
with the entrails, beak, and feet, I divided into 18 shares, and
with an allowance of bread, which I made a merit of granting, we
made a good supper, compared with our usual fare.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
26.</div>
<p>In the morning we caught another booby, so that Providence
seemed to be relieving our wants in a very extraordinary manner.
Towards noon we passed a great many pieces of the branches of
trees, some of which appeared to have been no long time in the
water. I had a good obser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45"
id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>vation for the latitude, and found
my situation to be in 13&deg; 41&acute; S; my longitude, by
account, from Tofoa, 37&deg; 13&acute; W; course S 85&deg; W, 112
miles. Every person was now overjoyed at the addition to their
dinner, which I distributed as I had done in the evening; giving
the blood to those who were the most in want of food.</p>
<p>To make our bread a little savoury we frequently dipped it in
salt water; but for my own part I generally broke mine into small
pieces, and eat it in my allowance of water, out of a cocoa-nut
shell, with a spoon, economically avoiding to take too large a
piece at a time, so that I was as long at dinner as if it had been
a much more plentiful meal.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Wednesday 27.</div>
<p>Wednesday, May the 27th. Fresh breezes south-easterly, and fine
weather.</p>
<p>The weather was now serene, but unhappily we found ourselves
unable to bear the sun's heat; many of us suffering a languor and
faintness, which made life indifferent. We were, however, so
fortunate as to catch two boobies to-day; their stomachs contained
several flying-fish and small cuttlefish, all of which I saved to
be divided for dinner.</p>
<p>We passed much drift wood, and saw many birds; I therefore did
not hesitate to pronounce that we were near the reefs of New
Holland, and assured every one I would make the coast without
delay, in the parallel we were in, and range the reef till I found
an opening, through which we might get into smooth water, and pick
up some supplies. From my recollection of captain Cook's survey of
this coast, I considered the direction of it to be N W, and I was
therefore satisfied that, with the wind to the southward of E, I
could always clear any dangers.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
27.</div>
<p>At noon I observed in latitude 13&deg; 26&acute; S; course since
yesterday N 82&deg; W; distance 109 miles; longitude made 39&deg;
4&acute; W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
46]</a></span> After writing my account, I divided the two birds
with their entrails, and the contents of their maws, into 18
portions, and, as the prize was a very valuable one, it was divided
as before, by calling out Who shall have this? so that to-day, with
the allowance of a 25th of a pound of bread at breakfast, and
another at dinner, with the proportion of water, I was happy to see
that every person thought he had feasted.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Thursday 28.</div>
<p>Thursday, May the 28th. Fresh breezes and fair weather; wind E S
E and E.</p>
<p>In the evening we saw a gannet; and the clouds remained so fixed
in the west, that I had little doubt of our being near to New
Holland; and every person, after taking his allowance of water for
supper, began to divert himself with conversing on the probability
of what we should find.</p>
<p>At one in the morning the person at the helm heard the sound of
breakers, and I no sooner lifted up my head, than I saw them close
under our lee, not more than a quarter of a mile distant from us. I
immediately hauled on a wind to the N N E, and in ten minutes time
we could neither see nor hear them.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
28.</div>
<p>I have already mentioned my reason for making New Holland so far
to the southward; for I never doubted of numerous openings in the
reef, through which I could have access to the shore: and, knowing
the inclination of the coast to be to the N W, and the wind mostly
to the southward of E, I could with ease range such a barrier of
reefs till I should find a passage, which now became absolutely
necessary, without a moment's loss of time. The idea of getting
into smooth water, and finding refreshments, kept my people's
spirits up: their joy was very great after we had got clear of the
breakers, to which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id=
"Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> had been much nearer than I thought
was possible to be before we saw them.</p>
<p>In the morning, at day-light, I bore away again for the reefs,
and saw them by nine o'clock. The sea broke furiously over every
part, and I had no sooner got near to them, than the wind came at
E, so that we could only lie x0along the line of the breakers,
within which we saw the water so smooth, that every person already
anticipated the heart-felt satisfaction he would receive, as soon
as we could get within them. But I now found we were embayed, for I
could not lie clear with my sails, the wind having backed against
us, and the sea set in so heavy towards the reef that our situation
was become dangerous. We could effect but little with the oars,
having scarce strength to pull them; and it was becoming every
minute more and more probable that we should be obliged to attempt
pushing over the reef, in case we could not pull off. Even this I
did not despair of effecting with success, when happily we
discovered a break in the reef, about one mile from us, and at the
same time an island of a moderate height within it, nearly in the
same direction, bearing W 1/2 N. I entered the passage with a
strong stream running to the westward; and found it about a quarter
of a mile broad, with every appearance of deep water.</p>
<p>On the outside, the reef inclined to the N E for a few miles,
and from thence to the N W; on the south side of the entrance, it
inclined to the S S W as far as I could see it; and I conjecture
that a similar passage to this which we now entered, may be found
near the breakers that I first discovered, which are 23 miles S of
this channel.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
28.</div>
<p>I did not recollect what latitude Providential channel<a name=
"FNanchor5" id="FNanchor5"></a> <a href="#Footnote5" class=
"fnanchor">[*]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id=

within a few miles of this, which is situate in 12&deg; 51&acute; S
latitude.</p>
<div class="footnote">

</div>
<p>Being now happily within the reefs, and in smooth water, I
endeavoured to keep near them to try for fish; but the tide set us
to the N W; I therefore bore away in that direction, and, having
promised to land on the first convenient spot we could find, all
our past hardships seemed already to be forgotten.</p>
<p>At noon I had a good observation, by which our latitude was
12&deg; 46&acute; S, whence the foregoing situations may be
considered as determined with some exactness. The island first seen
bore W S W five leagues. This, which I have called the island
Direction, will in fair weather always shew the channel, from which
it bears due W, and may be seen as soon as the reefs, from a ship's
mast-head: it lies in the latitude of 12&deg; 51&acute; S. These,
however, are marks too small for a ship to hit, unless it can
hereafter be ascertained that passages through the reef are
numerous along the coast, which I am inclined to think they are,
and then there would be little risk if the wind was not directly on
the shore.</p>
<p>My longitude, made by dead reckoning, from the island Tofoa to
our passage through the reef, is 40&deg; 10&acute; W. Providential
channel, I imagine, must lie very nearly under the same meridian
with our passage; by which it appears we had out-run our reckoning
1&deg; 9&acute;.</p>
<p>We now returned God thanks for his gracious protection, and with
much content took our miserable allowance of a 25th of a pound of
bread, and a quarter of a pint of water, for dinner.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Friday 29.</div>
<p>Friday, May the 29th. Moderate breezes and fine weather, wind E
S E.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
29.</div>
<p>As we advanced within the reefs, the coast began to<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> shew
itself very distinctly, with a variety of high and low land; some
parts of which were covered with wood. In our way towards the shore
we fell in with a point of a reef, which is connected with that
towards the sea, and here I came to a grapnel, and tried to catch
fish, but had no success. The island Direction now bore S three or
four leagues. Two islands lay about four miles to the W by N, and
appeared eligible for a resting-place, if nothing more; but on my
approach to the first I found it only a heap of stones, and its
size too inconsiderable to shelter the boat. I therefore proceeded
to the next, which was close to it and towards the main, where, on
the N W side, I found a bay and a fine sandy point to land at. Our
distance was about a quarter of a mile from a projecting part of
the main, bearing from S W by S, to N N W 3/4 W. I now landed to
examine if there were any signs of the natives being near us; but
though I discovered some old fire-places, I saw nothing to alarm me
for our situation during the night. Every one was anxious to find
something to eat, and I soon heard that there were oysters on the
rocks, for the tide was out; but it was nearly dark, and only a few
could be gathered. I determined therefore to wait till the morning,
to know how to proceed, and I consented that one half of us should
sleep on shore, and the other in the boat. We would gladly have
made a fire, but, as we could not accomplish it, we took our rest
for the night, which happily was calm and undisturbed.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
29.</div>
<p>The dawn of day brought greater strength and spirits to us than
I expected; for, notwithstanding every one was very weak, there
appeared strength sufficient remaining to make me conceive the most
favourable hopes of our being<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> able to surmount the
difficulties we might yet have to encounter.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw that there were not any natives immediately
near us, I sent out parties in search of supplies, while others
were putting the boat in order, that I might be ready to go to sea
in case any unforeseen cause might make it necessary. The first
object of this work, that demanded our attention, was the rudder:
one of the gudgeons had come out, in the course of the night, and
was lost. This, if it had happened at sea, would probably have been
the cause of our perishing, as the management of the boat could not
have been so nicely preserved as these very heavy seas required. I
had often expressed my fears of this accident, and, that we might
be prepared for it, had taken the precaution to have grummets fixed
on each quarter of the boat for oars; but even our utmost readiness
in using them, I fear, would not have saved us. It appears,
therefore, a providential circumstance, that it happened at this
place, and was in our power to remedy the defect; for by great good
luck we found a large staple in the boat that answered the
purpose.</p>
<p>The parties were now returned, highly rejoiced at having found
plenty of oysters and fresh water. I also had made a fire, by help
of a small magnifying glass, that I always carried about me, to
read off the divisions of my sextants; and, what was still more
fortunate, among the few things which had been thrown into the boat
and saved, was a piece of brimstone and a tinder-box, so that I
secured fire for the future.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
29.</div>
<p>One of my people had been so provident as to bring away with him
a copper pot: it was by being in possession of this article that I
was enabled to make a proper use of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> the supply we found, for,
with a mixture of bread and a little pork, I made a stew that might
have been relished by people of more delicate appetites, of which
each person received a full pint.</p>
<p>The general complaints of disease among us, were a dizziness in
the head, great weakness of the joints, and violent tenesmus, most
of us having had no evacuation by stool since we left the ship. I
had constantly a severe pain at my stomach; but none of our
complaints were alarming; on the contrary, every one retained marks
of strength, that, with a mind possessed of any fortitude, could
bear more fatigue than I hoped we had to undergo in our voyage to
Timor.</p>
<p>As I would not allow the people to expose themselves to the heat
of the sun, it being near noon, every one took his allotment of
earth, shaded by the bushes, for a short sleep.</p>
<p>The oysters we found grew so fast to the rocks that it was with
difficulty they could be broke off, and at last we discovered it to
be the most expeditious way to open them where they were found.
They were very sizeable, and well tasted, and gave us great relief.
To add to this happy circumstance, in the hollow of the land there
grew some wire grass, which indicated a moist situation. On forcing
a stick, about three feet long, into the ground, we found water,
and with little trouble dug a well, which produced as much as we
were in need of. It was very good, but I could not determine if it
was a spring or not. Our wants made it not necessary to make the
well deep, for it flowed as fast as we emptied it; which, as the
soil was apparently too loose to retain water from the rains,
renders it probable to be a spring. It lies about 200 yards to the
S E of a point in the S W part of the island.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
29.</div>
<p>I found evident signs of the natives resorting to this island;
for, besides fire-places, I saw two miserable wigwams, having only
one side loosely covered. We found a pointed stick, about three
feet long, with a slit in the end of it, to sling stones with, the
same as the natives of Van Diemen's land use.</p>
<p>The track of some animal was very discernible, and Mr. Nelson
agreed with me that it was the Kanguroo; but how these animals can
get from the main I know not, unless brought over by the natives to
breed, that they may take them with more ease, and render a supply
of food certain to them; as on the continent the catching of them
may be precarious, or attended with great trouble, in so large an
extent of country.</p>
<p>The island may be about two miles in circuit; it is a high lump
of rocks and stones covered with wood; but the trees are small, the
soil, which is very indifferent and sandy, being barely sufficient
to produce them. The trees that came within our knowledge were the
manchineal and a species of purow: also some palm-trees, the tops
of which we cut down, and the soft interior part or heart of them
was so palatable that it made a good addition to our mess. Mr.
Nelson discovered some fern-roots, which I thought might be good
roasted, as a substitute for bread, but it proved a very poor one:
it however was very good in its natural state to allay thirst, and
on that account I directed a quantity to be collected to take into
the boat. Many pieces of cocoa-nut shells and husk were found about
the shore, but we could find no cocoa-nut trees, neither did I see
any like them on the main.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
29.</div>
<p>I had cautioned every one not to touch any kind of berry or
fruit that they might find; yet they were no<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> sooner
out of my sight than they began to make free with three different
kinds, that grew all over the island, eating without any reserve.
The symptoms of having eaten too much, began at last to frighten
same of them; but on questioning others, who had taken a more
moderate allowance, their minds were a little quieted. The others,
however, became equally alarmed in their turn, dreading that such
symptoms would come on, and that they were all poisoned, so that
they regarded each other with the strongest marks of apprehension,
uncertain what would be the issue of their imprudence. Happily the
fruit proved wholesome and good. One sort grew on a small delicate
kind of vine; they were the size of a large gooseberry, and very
like in substance, but had only a sweet taste; the skin was a pale
red, streaked with yellow the long way of the fruit: it was
pleasant and agreeable. Another kind grew on bushes, like that
which is called the sea-side grape in the West Indies; but the
fruit was very different, and more like elder-berries, growing in
clusters in the same manner. The third sort was a black berry, not
in such plenty as the others, and resembled a bullace, or large
kind of sloe, both in size and taste. Seeing these fruits eaten by
the birds made me consider them fit for use, and those who had
already tried the experiment, not finding any bad effect, made it a
certainty that we might eat of them without danger.</p>
<p>Wild pigeons, parrots, and other birds, were about the summit of
the island, but, as I had no fire-arms, relief of that kind was not
to be expected, unless I met with some unfrequented spot where we
might take them with our hands.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
29.</div>
<p>On the south side of the island, and about half a
mile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg
54]</a></span> from the well, a small run of water was found; but,
as its source was not traced, I know nothing more of it.</p>
<p>The shore of this island is very rocky, except the part we
landed at, and here I picked up many pieces of pumice-stone. On the
part of the main next to us were several sandy bays, but at
low-water they became an extensive rocky flat. The country had
rather a barren appearance, except in a few places where it was
covered with wood. A remarkable range of rocks lay a few miles to
the S W, or a high peaked hill terminated the coast towards the
sea, with other high lands and islands to the southward. A high
fair cape showed the direction of the coast to the N W, about seven
leagues, and two small isles lay three or four leagues to the
northward.</p>
<p>I saw a few bees or wasps, several lizards, and the blackberry
bushes were full of ants nests, webbed as a spider's, but so close
and compact as not to admit the rain.</p>
<p>A trunk of a tree, about 50 feet long, lay on the beach; from
whence I conclude a heavy sea runs in here with the northerly
winds.</p>
<p>This being the day of the restoration of king Charles the
Second, and the name not being inapplicable to our present
situation (for we were restored to fresh life and strength), I
named this Restoration Island; for I thought it probable that
captain Cook might not have taken notice of it. The other names I
have presumed to give the different parts of the coast, will be
only to show my route a little more distinctly.</p>
<p>At noon I found the latitude of the island to be 12&deg;
39&acute; S; our course having been N 66&deg; W; distance 18 miles
from yesterday noon.</p>

<p>Saturday, May the 30th. Very fine weather, and E S E<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> winds.
This afternoon I sent parties out again to gather oysters, with
which and some of the inner part of the palm-top, we made another
good stew for supper, each person receiving a full pint and a half;
but I refused bread to this meal, for I considered our wants might
yet be very great, and as such I represented the necessity of
saving our principal support whenever it was in our power.</p>
<p>At night we again divided, and one half of us slept on shore by
a good fire. In the morning I discovered a visible alteration in
every one for the better, and I sent them away again to gather
oysters. I had now only two pounds of pork left. This article,
which I could not keep under lock and key as I did the bread, had
been pilfered by some inconsiderate person, but every one most
solemnly denied it; I therefore resolved to put it out of their
power for the future, by sharing what remained for our dinner.
While the party was out getting oysters, I got the boat in
readiness for sea, and filled all our water vessels, which amounted
to nearly 60 gallons.</p>
<p>The party being returned, dinner was soon ready, and every one
had as good an allowance as they had for supper; for with the pork
I gave an allowance of bread; as I was determined forthwith to push
on. As it was not yet noon, I told every one that an exertion
should be made to gather as many oysters as possible for a sea
store, as I was determined to sail in the afternoon.</p>
<p>At noon I again observed the latitude 12&deg; 39&acute; S; it
was then high-water, the tide had risen three feet, but I could not
be certain which way the flood came from. I deduce the time of
high-water at full and change to be ten minutes past seven in the
morning.</p>

<p>Sunday, May the 31st. Early in the afternoon, the
peo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg

pick up, and every thing was put into the boat. I then examined the
quantity of bread remaining, and found 38 days allowance, according
to the last mode of issuing a 25th of a pound at breakfast and at
dinner.</p>
<p>Fair weather, and moderate breezes at E S E and S E.</p>
<p>Being all ready for sea, I directed every person to attend
prayers, and by four o'clock we were preparing to embark; when
twenty natives appeared, running and holloaing to us, on the
opposite shore. They were armed with a spear or lance, and a short
weapon which they carried in their left hand: they made signs for
us to come to them. On the top of the hills we saw the heads of
many more; whether these were their wives and children, or others
who waited for our landing, until which they meant not to show
themselves, lest we might be intimidated, I cannot say; but, as I
found we were discovered to be on the coast, I thought it prudent
to make the best of my way, for fear of canoes; though, from the
accounts of captain Cook, the chance was that there were very few
or none of any consequence. I passed these people as near as I
could, which was within a quarter of a mile; they were naked, and
apparently black, and their hair or wool bushy and short.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
31.</div>
<p>I directed my course within two small islands that lie to the
north of Restoration Island, passing between them and the main
land, towards Fair Cape, with a strong tide in my favour; so that I
was abreast of it by eight o'clock. The coast I had passed was high
and woody. As I could see no land without Fair Cape, I concluded
that the coast inclined to the N W and W N W, which was agreeable
to my recollection of captain Cook's survey. I therefore steered
more towards the W; but by eleven o'clock at night I
found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg
57]</a></span> myself mistaken: for we met with low land, which
inclined to the N E; so that at three o'clock in the morning I
found we were embayed, which obliged us to stand back to the
southward.</p>
<p>At day-break I was exceedingly surprised to find the appearance
of the country all changed, as if in the course of the night I had
been transported to another part of the world; for we had now a
miserable low sandy coast in view, with very little verdure, or any
thing to indicate that it was at all habitable to a human being, if
I except some patches of small trees or brush-wood.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
31.</div>
<p>I had many small islands in view to the N E, about six miles
distant. The E part of the main bore N four miles, and Fair Cape S
S E five or six leagues. I took the channel between the nearest
island and the main land, about one mile apart, leaving all the
islands on the starboard side. Some of these were very pretty
spots, covered with wood, and well situated for fishing; large
shoals of fish were about us, but we could not catch any. As I was
passing this strait we saw another party of Indians, seven in
number, running towards us, shouting and making signs for us to
land. Some of them waved green branches of the bushes which were
near them, as a sign of friendship; but there were some of their
other motions less friendly. A larger party we saw a little farther
off, and coming towards us. I therefore determined not to land,
though I wished much to have had some intercourse with these
people; for which purpose I beckoned to them to come near to me,
and laid the boat close to the rocks; but not one would come within
200 yards of us. They were armed in the same manner as those I had
seen from Restoration Island, were stark naked, and appeared to be
jet black, with short bushy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> hair or wool, and in every respect
the same people. An island of good height now bore N 1/2 W, four
miles from us, at which I resolved to see what could be got, and
from thence to take a look at the coast. At this isle I landed
about eight o'clock in the morning. The shore was rocky, with some
sandy beaches within the rocks: the water, however, was smooth, and
I landed without difficulty. I sent two parties out, one to the
northward, and the other to the southward, to seek for supplies,
and others I ordered to stay by the boat. On this occasion their
fatigue and weakness so far got the better of their sense of duty,
that some of them began to mutter who had done most, and declared
they would rather be without their dinner than go in search of it.
One person, in particular, went so far as to tell me, with a
mutinous look, he was as good a man as myself. It was not possible
for me to judge where this might have an end, if not stopped in
time; I therefore determined to strike a final blow at it, and
either to preserve my command, or die in the attempt: and, seizing
a cutlass, I ordered him to take hold of another and defend
himself; on which he called out I was going to kill him, and began
to make concessions. I did not allow this to interfere further with
the harmony of the boat's crew, and every thing soon became
quiet.</p>
<p>The parties continued collecting what could be found, which
consisted of some fine oysters and clams, and a few small dog-fish
that were caught in the holes of the rocks. We also found about two
tons of rain-water in the hollow of the rocks, on the north part of
the island, so that of this essential article we were again so
happy as not to be in want.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">May</span>
31.</div>
<p>After regulating the mode of proceeding, I set off for
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg
59]</a></span> highest part of the island, to see and consider of
my route for the night. To my surprise I could see no more of the
main than I did from below, it extending only from S 1/2 E, four
miles, to W by N, about three leagues, full of sand-hills. Besides
the isles to the E S E and south, that I had seen before, I could
only discover a small key N W by N. As this was considerably
farther from the main than where I was at present, I resolved to
get there by night, it being a more secure resting-place; for I was
here open to an attack, if the Indians had canoes, as they
undoubtedly observed my landing. My mind being made up on this
point, I returned, taking a particular look at the spot I was on,
which I found only to produce a few bushes and coarse grass, and
the extent of the whole not two miles in circuit. On the north
side, in a sandy bay, I saw an old canoe, about 33 feet long, lying
bottom upwards, and half buried in the beach. It was made of three
pieces, the bottom entire, to which the sides were sewed in the
common way. It had a sharp projecting prow rudely carved, in
resemblance of the head of a fish; the extreme breadth was about
three feet, and I imagine it was capable of carrying 20 men.</p>
<p>At noon the parties were all returned, but had found difficulty
in gathering the oysters, from their close adherence to the rocks,
and the clams were scarce: I therefore saw, that it would be of
little use to remain longer in this place, as we should not be able
to collect more than we could eat; nor could any tolerable
sea-store be expected, unless we fell in with a greater plenty. I
named this Sunday Island: it lies N by W 3/4 W from Restoration
Island; the latitude, by a good observation, 11&deg; 58&acute;
S.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June</span>. Monday

<p>Monday, June the 1st. Fresh breezes and fair weather, ending
with a fresh gale. Wind S E by S.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
1.</div>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, we dined; each person having a
full pint and a half of stewed oysters and clams, thickened with
small beans, which Mr. Nelson informed us were a species of
Dolichos. Having eaten heartily, and taken the water we were in
want of, I only waited to determine the time of high-water, which I
found to be at three o'clock, and the rise of the tide about five
feet. According to this it is high-water on the full and change at
19 minutes past 9 in the morning; but here I observed the flood to
come from the southward, though at Restoration Island, I thought it
came from the northward. I think captain Cook mentions that he
found great irregularity in the set of the flood on this coast.</p>
<p>I now sailed for the key which I had seen in the N W by N,
giving the name of Sunday Island to the place I left; we arrived
just at dark, but found it so surrounded by a reef of rocks, that I
could not land without danger of staving the boat; and on that
account I came to a grapnel for the night.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
1.</div>
<p>At dawn of day we got on shore, and tracked the boat into
shelter; for the wind blowing fresh without, and the ground being
rocky, I was afraid to trust her at a grapnel, lest she might be
blown to sea: I was, therefore, obliged to let her ground in the
course of the ebb. From appearances, I expected that if we remained
till night we should meet with turtle, as we had already discovered
recent tracks of them. Innumerable birds of the noddy kind made
this island their resting-place; so that I had reason to flatter
myself with hopes of getting supplies in greater abundance than it
had hitherto been in my power. The situation was at least four
leagues distant from the main. We were on the north-westernmost of
four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg
61]</a></span> small keys, which were surrounded by a reef of rocks
connected by sand-banks, except between the two northernmost; and
there likewise it was dry at low water; the whole forming a lagoon
island, into which the tide flowed: at this entrance I kept the
boat.</p>
<p>As usual, I sent parties away in search of supplies, but, to our
great disappointment, we could only get a few clams and some
dolichos: with these, and the oysters we had brought from Sunday
Island, I made up a mess for dinner, with an addition of a small
quantity of bread.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
1.</div>
<p>Towards noon, Mr. Nelson, and his party, who had been to the
easternmost key, returned; but himself in such a weak condition,
that he was obliged to be supported by two men. His complaint was a
violent heat in his bowels, a loss of sight, much drought, and an
inability to walk. This I found was occasioned by his being unable
to support the heat of the sun, and that, when he was fatigued and
faint, instead of retiring into the shade to rest, he had continued
to do more than his strength was equal to. It was a great
satisfaction to me to find, that he had no fever; and it was now
that the little wine, which I had so carefully saved became of real
use. I gave it in very small quantities, with some small pieces of
bread soaked in it; and, having pulled off his cloaths, and laid
him under some shady bushes, he began to recover. The boatswain and
carpenter also were ill, and complained of head-ach, and sickness
of the stomach; others, who had not had any evacuation by stool,
became shockingly distressed with the tenesmus; so that there were
but few without complaints. An idea now prevailed, that their
illness was occasioned by eating the dolichos, and some were so
much alarmed that they thought themselves poisoned.
Myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg
62]</a></span> however, and some others, who had eaten of them,
were yet very well; but the truth was, that all those who were
complaining, except Mr. Nelson, had gorged themselves with a large
quantity of raw beans, and Mr. Nelson informed me, that they were
constantly teazing him, whenever a berry was found, to know if it
was good to eat; so that it would not have been surprizing if many
of them had been really poisoned.</p>
<p>Our dinner was not so well relished as at Sunday Island, because
we had mixed the dolichos with our stew. The oysters and soup,
however, were eaten by every one, except Mr. Nelson, whom I fed
with a few small pieces of bread soaked in half a glass of wine,
and he continued to mend.</p>
<p>In my walk round the island, I found several cocoa-nut shells,
the remains of an old wigwam, and the backs of two turtle, but no
sign of any quadruped. One of my people found three sea-fowl's
eggs.</p>
<p>As is common on such spots, the soil is little other than sand,
yet it produced small toa-trees, and some others, that we were not
acquainted with. There were fish in the lagoon, but we could not
catch any. As our wants, therefore, were not likely to be supplied
here, not even with water for our daily expence, I determined to
sail in the morning, after trying our success in the night for
turtle and birds. A quiet night's rest also, I conceived, would be
of essential service to those who were unwell.</p>
<p>From the wigwam and turtle-shell being found, it is certain that
the natives sometimes resort to this place, and have canoes: but I
did not apprehend that we ran any risk by remaining here. I
directed our fire, however, to be made in the thicket, that we
might not be discovered in the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
1.</div>
<p>At noon, I observed the latitude of this island to be 11&deg;
47&acute; S. The main land extended towards the N W, and was full
of white sand-hills: another small island lay within us, bearing W
by N 1/4 N, three leagues distant. My situation being very low, I
could see nothing of the reef towards the sea.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Tuesday 2.</div>
<p>Tuesday, June the 2d. The first part of this day we had some
light showers of rain; the latter part was fair, wind from the S E,
blowing fresh.</p>
<p>Rest was now so much wanted, that the afternoon was
advantageously spent in sleep. There were, however, a few not
disposed to it, and those I employed in dressing some clams to take
with us for the next day's dinner; others we cut up in slices to
dry, which I knew was the most valuable supply we could find here.
But, contrary to our expectation, they were very scarce.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
2.</div>
<p>Towards evening, I cautioned every one against making too large
a fire, or suffering it after dark to blaze up. Mr. Samuel and Mr.
Peckover had the superintendence of this business, while I was
strolling about the beach to observe if I thought it could be seen
from the main. I was just satisfied that it could not, when on a
sudden the island appeared all in a blaze, that might have been
seen at a much more considerable distance. I ran to learn the
cause, and found it was occasioned by the imprudence and obstinacy
of one of the party, who, in my absence, had insisted on having a
fire to himself; in making which the flames caught the neighbouring
grass and rapidly spread. This misconduct might have produced very
serious consequences, by discovering our situation to the natives;
for, if they had attacked us, we must inevitably have fallen a
sacrifice, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id=
"Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> we had neither arms nor strength to
oppose an enemy. Thus the relief which I expected from a little
sleep was totally lost, and I anxiously waited for the flowing of
the tide, that we might proceed to sea.</p>
<p>I found it high-water at half past five this evening, whence I
deduce the time, on the full and change of the moon, to be 58' past
10 in the morning: the rise is nearly five feet. I could not
observe the set of the flood; but imagine it comes from the
southward, and that I have been mistaken at Restoration Island, as
I find the time of high-water gradually later as we advance to the
northward.</p>

<p>After eight o'clock, Mr. Samuel and Mr. Peckover went out to
watch for turtle, and three men went to the east key to endeavour
to catch birds. All the others complaining of being sick, took
their rest, except Mr. Hayward and Mr. Elphinston, who I directed
to keep watch. About midnight the bird party returned, with only
twelve noddies, a bird I have already described to be about the
size of a pigeon: but if it had not been for the folly and
obstinacy of one of the party, who separated from the other two,
and disturbed the birds, they might have caught a great number. I
was so much provoked at my plans being thus defeated, that I gave
the offender<a name="FNanchor6" id="FNanchor6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[*]</a> a good beating. I now went in
search of the turtling party, who had taken great pains, but
without success. This, however, did not surprise me, as it was not
to be expected that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id=
"Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> turtle would come near us after the
noise which was made at the beginning of the evening in
extinguishing the fire. I therefore desired them to come back, but
they requested to stay a little longer, as they still hoped to find
some before day-light: they, however, returned by three o'clock,
without any reward for their labour.</p>

"#FNanchor6"><span class="label">[*]</span></a> Robert
Lamb.&mdash;This man, when he came to Java, acknowledged he had
eaten nine birds on the key, after he separated from the other
two.</p>
</div>
<p>The birds we half dressed, which, with a few clams, made the
whole of the supply procured here. I tied up a few gilt buttons and
some pieces of iron to a tree, for any of the natives that might
come after us; and, happily finding my invalids much better for
their night's rest, I got every one into the boat, and departed by
dawn of day. Wind at S E; course to the N by W.</p>
<p>We had scarcely ran two leagues to the northward, when the sea
suddenly became rough, which not having experienced since we were
within the reefs, I concluded to be occasioned by an open channel
to the ocean. Soon afterwards we met with a large shoal, on which
were two sandy keys; between these and two others, four miles to
the west, I passed on to the northward, the sea still continuing to
be rough.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
2.</div>
<p>Towards noon, I fell in with six other keys, most of which
produced some small trees and brush-wood. These formed a pleasing
contrast with the main land we had passed, which was full of
sand-hills. The country continued hilly, and the northernmost land,
the same which we saw from the lagoon island, appeared like downs,
sloping towards the sea. To the southward of this is a flat-topped
hill, which, on account of its shape, I called Pudding-pan hill,
and a little to the northward two other hills, which we called the
Paps; and here was a small tract of country<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> without
sand, the eastern part of which forms a cape, whence the coast
inclines to the N W by N.</p>
<p>At noon I observed in the latitude of 11&deg; 18&acute; S, the
cape bearing W, distant ten miles. Five small keys bore from N E to
S E, the nearest of them about two miles distant, and a low sandy
key between us and the cape bore W, distant four miles. My course
from the Lagoon Island N 1/2 W, distant 30 miles.</p>
<p>I am sorry it was not in my power to obtain a sufficient
knowledge of the depth of water; for in our situation nothing could
be undertaken that might have occasioned delay. It may however be
understood, that, to the best of my judgment, from appearances, a
ship may pass wherever I have omitted to represent danger.</p>
<p>I divided six birds, and issued one 25th of a pound of bread,
with half a pint of water, to each person for dinner, and I gave
half a glass of wine to Mr. Nelson, who was now so far recovered as
to require no other indulgence.</p>
<p>The gunner, when he left the ship, brought his watch with him,
by which we had regulated our time till to-day, when unfortunately
it stopped; so that noon, sun-rise, and sun-set, are the only parts
of the 24 hours of which I can speak with certainty, as to
time.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June the 3d. Fresh gales S S E and S E, and fair
weather. As we stood to the N by W this afternoon, we found more
sea, which I attributed to our receiving less shelter from the
reefs to the eastward: it is probable they do not extend so far to
the N as this; at least, it may be concluded that there is not a
continued barrier to prevent shipping having access to the shore. I
observed that the stream set to the N W, which I considered to be
the flood; in some places along the coast, we saw patches
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
67]</a></span> wood. At five o'clock, steering to the N W, we
passed a large and fair inlet, into which, I imagine, is a safe and
commodious entrance; it lies in latitude 11&deg; S: about three
leagues to the northward of this is an island, at which we arrived
about sun-set, and took shelter for the night under a sandy point,
which was the only part we could land at: I was therefore under the
necessity to put up with rather a wild situation, and slept in the
boat. Nevertheless I sent a party away to see what could be got,
but they returned without any success. They saw a great number of
turtle bones and shells, where the natives had been feasting, and
their last visit seemed to be of late date. The island was covered
with wood, but in other respects a lump of rocks. We lay at a
grapnel until day-light, with a very fresh gale and cloudy weather.
The main bore from S E by S to N N W 1/2 W, three leagues; and a
mountainous island, with a flat top, N by W, four or five leagues:
several others were between it and the main. The spot we were on,
which I call Turtle Island; lies in latitude, by account, 10&deg;
52&acute; S, and 42 miles W from Restoration Island. Abreast of it
the coast has the appearance of a sandy desert, but improves about
three leagues farther to the northward, where it terminates in a
point, near to which is a number of small islands. I sailed between
these islands, where I found no bottom at twelve fathoms; the high
mountainous island with a flat top, and four rocks to the S E of
it, that I call the Brothers, being on my starboard hand. Soon
after, an extensive opening appeared in the main land, with a
number of high islands in it. I called this the Bay of Islands. We
continued steering to the N W. Several islands and keys lay to the
northward. The most northerly island was mountainous, having on
it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg
68]</a></span> a very high round hill; and a smaller was remarkable
for a single peaked hill.</p>
<p>The coast to the northward and westward of the Bay of Islands
had a very different appearance from that to the southward. It was
high and woody, with many islands close to it, and had a very
broken appearance. Among these islands are fine bays, and
convenient places for shipping. The northernmost I call Wednesday
Island: to the N W of this we fell in with a large reef, which I
believe joins a number of keys that were in sight from the N W to
the E N E. We now stood to the S W half a league, when it was noon,
and I had a good observation of the latitude in 10&deg; 31&acute;
S. Wednesday Island bore E by S five miles; the westernmost land S
W two or three leagues; the islands to the northward, from N W by W
four or five leagues, to N E six leagues; and the reef from W to N
E, distant one mile, I now assured every one that we should be
clear of New Holland in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to say how far this reef may extend. It
may be a continuation, or a detached part of the range of shoals
that surround the coast: but be that as it may, I consider the
mountainous islands as separate from the shoals; and have no doubt
that near them may be found good passages for ships. But I rather
recommend to those who are to pass this strait from the eastward,
to take their direction from the coast of New Guinea: yet, I
likewise think that a ship coming from the southward, will find a
fair strait in the latitude of 10&deg; S. I much wished to have
ascertained this point; but in our distressful situation, any
increase of fatigue, or loss of time, might have been attended with
the most fatal consequences. I therefore determined to pass on
without delay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id=
"Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>

<p>As an addition to our dinner of bread and water, I served to
each person six oysters.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Thursday 4.</div>
<p>Thursday, June the 4th. A fresh gale at S E, and fair
weather.</p>
<p>At two o'clock as we were steering to the S W, towards the
westernmost part of the land in sight, we fell in with some large
sand-banks that run off from the coast. We were therefore obliged
to steer to the northward again, and, having got round them, I
directed my course to the W.</p>
<p>At four o'clock, the westernmost of the islands to the northward
bore N four leagues; Wednesday island E by N five leagues; and
Shoal Cape S E by E two leagues. A small island was now seen
bearing W, at which I arrived before dark, and found that it was
only a rock, where boobies resort, for which reason I called it
Booby Island. A small key also lies close to the W part of the
coast, which I have called Shoal Cape. Here terminated the rocks
and shoals of the N part of New Holland, for, except Booby Island,
we could see no land to the westward of S, after three o'clock this
afternoon.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
4.</div>
<p>I find that Booby Island was seen by Captain Cook, and, by a
remarkable coincidence of ideas, received from him the same name;
but I cannot with certainty reconcile the situation of many parts
of the coast that I have seen, to his survey. I ascribe this to the
very different form in which land appears, when seen from the
unequal heights of a ship and a boat. The chart I have given, is by
no means meant to supersede that made by Captain Cook, who had
better opportunities than I had, and was in every respect properly
provided for surveying. The intention of mine is chiefly to render
the narrative more intelligible, and to<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> shew in
what manner the coast appeared to me from an open boat. I have
little doubt that the opening, which I named the Bay of Islands, is
Endeavour Straits; and that our track was to the northward of
Prince of Wales's Isles. Perhaps, by those who shall hereafter
navigate these seas, more advantage may be derived from the
possession of both our charts, than from either singly.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the evening, we once more launched into the
open ocean. Miserable as our situation was in every respect, I was
secretly surprised to see that it did not appear to affect any one
so strongly as myself; on the contrary, it seemed as if they had
embarked on a voyage to Timor, in a vessel sufficiently calculated
for safety and convenience. So much confidence gave me great
pleasure, and I may assert that to this cause their preservation is
chiefly to be attributed; for if any one of them had despaired, he
would most probably have died before we reached New Holland.</p>
<p>I now gave every one hopes that eight or ten days might bring us
to a land of safety; and, after praying to God for a continuance of
his most gracious protection, I served an allowance of water for
supper, and kept my course to the W S W, to counteract the
southerly winds, in case they should blow strong.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
4.</div>
<p>We had been just six days on the coast of New Holland, in the
course of which we found oysters, a few clams, some birds, and
water. But perhaps a benefit nearly equal to this we received from
not having fatigue in the boat, and enjoying good rest at night.
These advantages certainly preserved our lives; for, small as the
supply was, I am very sensible how much it relieved our
distresses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg
71]</a></span> About this time nature would have sunk under the
extremes of hunger and fatigue. Some would have ceased to struggle
for a life that only promised wretchedness and misery; while
others, though possessed of more bodily strength, must soon have
followed their unfortunate companions. Even in our present
situation, we were most wretched spectacles; yet our fortitude and
spirit remained; every one being encouraged by the hopes of a
speedy termination to his misery.</p>
<p>For my own part, wonderful as it may appear, I felt neither
extreme hunger nor thirst. My allowance contented me, knowing I
could have no more.</p>
<p>I served one 25th of a pound of bread, and an allowance of

six oysters to each person. At noon, latitude observed 10&deg;

<div class="sidenote">Friday 5.</div>
<p>Friday, June the 5th. Fair weather with some showers, and a
strong trade wind at E S E.</p>
<p>This day we saw a number of water-snakes, that were ringed
yellow and black, and towards noon we passed a great deal of
rock-weed. Though the weather was fair, we were constantly shipping
water, and two men always employed to bale the boat.</p>
<p>At noon I observed in latitude 10&deg; 45&acute; S; our course
since yesterday W 1/4 N, 108 miles; longitude made 3&deg; 35&acute;
W. Served one 25th of a pound of bread, and a quarter of a pint of
water for breakfast; the same for dinner, with an addition of six

<p>In the evening a few boobies came about us, one of which I
caught with my hand. The blood was divided among three of the men
who were weakest, but the bird I ordered to be kept for our dinner
the next day. Served a quarter of a pint of water for supper, and
to some, who were most in need, half a pint.</p>
<p>In the course of the night we suffered much cold and shiverings.
At day-light, I found that some of the clams, which had been hung
up to dry for sea-store, were stolen; but every one most solemnly
denied having any knowledge of it. This forenoon we saw a gannet, a
sand-lark, and some water-snakes, which in general were from two to
three feet long.</p>
<p>Served the usual allowance of bread and water for breakfast, and
the same for dinner, with the bird, which I distributed in the
usual way, of Who shall have this? I determined to make Timor about
the latitude of 9&deg; 30&acute; S, or 10&deg; S. At noon I
observed the latitude to be 10&deg; 19&acute; S; course N 77&deg;
W; distance 117 miles; longitude made from the Shoal Cape, the
north part of New Holland, 5&deg; 31&acute; W.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sunday 7.</div>
<p>Sunday, June the 7th. Fresh gales and fair weather till eight in
the evening. The remaining part of the 24 hours squally, with much
wind at S S E and E S E, and a high sea, so that we were constantly
wet and baling.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I took an opportunity of examining again into
our store of bread, and found remaining 19 days allowance, at my
former rate of serving one 25th of a pound three times a day:
therefore, as I saw every prospect of a quick passage, I again
ventured to grant an allowance for supper, agreeable to my promise
at the time it was discontinued.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
7.</div>
<p>We passed the night miserably wet and cold, and in
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg
73]</a></span> morning I heard heavy complaints of our deplorable
situation. The sea was high and breaking over us. I could only
afford the allowance of bread and water for breakfast; but for
dinner I gave out an ounce of dried clams to each person, which was
all that remained.</p>
<p>At noon I altered the course to the W N W, to keep more from the
sea while it blew so strong. Latitude observed 9&deg; 31&acute; S;
course N 57&deg; W; distance 88 miles; longitude made 6&deg;

<div class="sidenote">Monday 8.</div>
<p>Monday, June the 8th. Fresh gales and squally weather, with some
showers of rain. Wind E and E S E.</p>
<p>This day the sea ran very high, and we were continually wet,
suffering much cold in the night. I now remarked that Mr. Ledward,
the surgeon, and Lawrence Lebogue, an old hardy seaman, were giving
way very fast. I could only assist them by a tea-spoonful or two of
wine, which I had carefully saved, expecting such a melancholy
necessity. Among most of the others I observed more than a common
inclination to sleep, which seemed to indicate that nature was
almost exhausted.</p>
<p>Served the usual allowance of bread and water at supper,
breakfast, and dinner. Saw several gannets.</p>
<p>At noon I observed in 8&deg; 45&acute; S; course W N W 1/4 W,
106 miles; longitude made 8&deg; 23&acute; W.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Tuesday 9.</div>
<p>Tuesday, June the 9th. Wind S E. The weather being moderate, I
steered W by S.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789 <span class="smcap">June</span> 9.</div>
<p>At four in the afternoon we caught a small dolphin, the first
relief of the kind we obtained. I issued about two ounces to each
person, including the offals, and saved the remainder for dinner
the next day. Towards evening the wind freshened, and it blew
strong all night, so that we shipped much water, and suffered
greatly from the wet and cold.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> At day-light, as usual, I
heard much complaining, which my own feelings convinced me was too
well founded. I gave the surgeon and Lebogue a little wine, but I
could give no farther relief, than assurances that a very few days
longer, at our present fine rate of sailing, would bring us to
Timor.</p>
<p>Gannets, boobies, men of war and tropic birds, were constantly
about us. Served the usual allowance of bread and water, and at
noon dined on the remains of the dolphin, which amounted to about
an ounce per man. I observed the latitude to be 9&deg; 9&acute; S;
longitude made 10&deg; 8&acute; W; course since yesterday noon S
76&deg; W; distance 107 miles.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Wednesday 10.</div>
<p>Wednesday, June the 10th. Wind E S E. Fresh gales and fair
weather, but a continuance of much sea, which, by breaking almost
constantly over the boat, made us miserably wet, and we had much
cold to endure in the night.</p>
<p>This afternoon I suffered great sickness from the oily nature of
part of the stomach of the fish, which had fallen to my share at
dinner. At sun-set I served an allowance of bread and water for
supper. In the morning, after a very bad night, I could see an
alteration for the worse in more than half my people. The usual
allowance was served for breakfast and dinner. At noon I found our
situation to be in latitude 9&deg; 16&acute; S; longitude from the
north part of New Holland 12&deg; 1&acute; W; course since
yesterday noon W 1/2 S, distance 111 miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
11.</div>
<p>Birds and rock-weed showed that we were not far from land; but I
expected such signs must be here, as there are many islands between
the east part of Timor and New Guinea. I however hoped to fall in
with Timor every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id=
"Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> hour, for I had great apprehensions
that some of my people could not hold out. An extreme weakness,
swelled legs, hollow and ghastly countenances, great propensity to
sleep, with an apparent debility of understanding, seemed to me
melancholy presages of their approaching dissolution. The surgeon
and Lebogue, in particular were most miserable objects. I
occasionally gave them a few tea-spoonfuls of wine, out of the
little I had saved for this dreadful stage, which no doubt greatly
helped to support them.</p>
<p>For my own part, a great share of spirits, with the hopes of
being able to accomplish the voyage, seemed to be my principal
support; but the boatswain very innocently told me, that he really
thought I looked worse than any one in the boat. The simplicity
with which he uttered such an opinion diverted me, and I had good
humour enough to return him a better compliment.</p>
<p>Every one received his 25th of a pound of bread, and quarter of
a pint of water, at evening, morning, and noon, and an extra
allowance of water was given to those who desired it.</p>
<p>At noon I observed in latitude 9&deg; 41&acute; S; course S
77&deg; W; distance 109 miles; longitude made 13&deg; 49&acute; W.
I had little doubt of having now passed the meridian of the eastern
part of Timor, which is laid down in 128&deg; E. This diffused
universal joy and satisfaction.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Friday 12.</div>
<p>Friday, June the 12th. Fresh breezes and fine weather, but very
hazy. Wind from E to S E.</p>
<p>All the afternoon we had several gannets, and many other birds,
about us, that indicated we were near land, and at sun-set we kept
a very anxious look-out. In the evening we caught a booby, which I
reserved for our dinner the next day.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
12.</div>
<p>At three in the morning, with an excess of joy, we discovered
Timor bearing from W S W to W N W, and I hauled on a wind to the N
N E till day-light, when the land bore from S W by S about two
leagues to N E by N seven leagues.</p>
<p>It is not possible for me to describe the pleasure which the
blessing of the sight of land diffused among us. It appeared scarce
credible, that in an open boat, and so poorly provided, we should
have been able to reach the coast of Timor in forty-one days after
leaving Tofoa, having in that time run, by our log, a distance of
3618 miles, and that, notwithstanding our extreme distress, no one
should have perished in the voyage.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned, that I knew not where the Dutch
settlement was situated; but I had a faint idea that it was at the
S W part of the island. I therefore, after day-light, bore away
along shore to the S S W, and the more readily as the wind would
not suffer us to go towards the N E without great loss of time.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
12.</div>
<p>The day gave us a most agreeable prospect of the land, which was
interspersed with woods and lawns; the interior part mountainous,
but the shore low. Towards noon the coast became higher, with some
remarkable head-lands. We were greatly delighted with the general
look of the country, which exhibited many cultivated spots and
beautiful situations; but we could only see a few small huts,
whence I concluded no European resided in this part of the island.
Much sea ran on the shore, so that landing with a boat was
impracticable. At noon I was abreast of a very high head-land; the
extremes of the land bore S W 1/2 W, and N N E 1/2 E; our distance
off shore being three miles; latitude, by observation, 9&deg;
59&acute; S; and my longi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77"
id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>tude, by dead reckoning, from the
north part of New Holland, 15&deg; 6&acute; W.</p>
<p>With the usual allowance of bread and water for dinner, I
divided the bird we had caught the night before, and to the surgeon
and Lebogue I gave a little wine.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Saturday 13.</div>
<p>Saturday, June the 13th. Fresh gales at E, and E S E, with very
hazy weather.</p>
<p>During the afternoon, we continued our course along a low woody
shore, with innumerable palm-trees, called the Fan Palm from the
leaf spreading like a fan; but we had now lost all signs of
cultivation, and the country had not so fine an appearance as it
had to the eastward. This, however, was only a small tract, for by
sun-set it improved again, and I saw several great smokes where the
inhabitants were clearing and cultivating their grounds. We had now
ran 25 miles to the W S W since noon, and were W five miles from a
low point, which in the afternoon I imagined had been the
southernmost land, and here the coast formed a deep bend, with low
land in the bight that appeared like islands. The west shore was
high; but from this part of the coast to the high cape which we
were abreast of yesterday noon, the shore is low, and I believe
shoal. I particularly remark this situation, because here the very
high ridge of mountains, that run from the east end of the island,
terminate, and the appearance of the country suddenly changes for
the worse, as if it was not the same island in any respect.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
13.</div>
<p>That we might not run past any settlement in the night, I
determined to preserve my station till the morning, and therefore
hove to under a close-reefed fore-sail, with which the boat lay
very quiet. We were here in shoal water; our distance from the
shore being half a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id=
"Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> league, the westernmost land in sight
bearing W S W 1/2 W. Served bread and water for supper, and the
boat lying too very well, all but the officer of the watch
endeavoured to get a little sleep.</p>
<p>At two in the morning, we wore, and stood in shore till
day-light, when I found we had drifted, during the night, about
three leagues to the W S W, the southernmost land in sight bearing
W. On examining the coast, and not seeing any sign of a settlement,
we bore away to the westward, having a strong gale, against a
weather current, which occasioned much sea. The shore was high and
covered with wood, but we did not run far before low land again
formed the coast, the points of which opening at west, I once more
fancied we were on the south part of the island; but at ten o'clock
we found the coast again inclining towards the south, part of it
bearing W S W 1/2 W. At the same time high land appeared from S W
to S W by W 1/2 W; but the weather was so hazy, that it was
doubtful whether the two lands were separated, the opening only
extending one point of the compass. I, for this reason, stood
towards the outer land, and found it to be the island Roti.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
13.</div>
<p>I returned to the shore I had left, and in a sandy bay I brought
to a grapnel, that I might more conveniently calculate my
situation. In this place we saw several smokes, where the natives
were clearing their grounds. During the little time we remained
here, the master and carpenter very much importuned me to let them
go in search of supplies; to which, at length, I assented; but,
finding no one willing to be of their party, they did not choose to
quit the boat. I stopped here no longer than for the purpose just
mentioned, and we continued steering<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> along shore. We had a
view of a beautiful-looking country, as if formed by art into lawns
and parks. The coast is low, and covered with woods, in which are
innumerable fan palm-trees, that look like cocoa-nut walks. The
interior part is high land, but very different from the more
eastern parts of the island, where it is exceedingly mountainous,
and to appearance the soil better.</p>
<p>At noon, the island Roti bore S W by W seven leagues. I had no
observation for the latitude, but, by account, we were in 10&deg;
12&acute; S; our course since yesterday noon being S 77 W, 54
miles. The usual allowance of bread and water was served for
breakfast and dinner, and to the surgeon and Lebogue, I gave a
little wine.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sunday 14.</div>
<p>Sunday, June the 14th. A strong gale at E S E, with hazy
weather, all the afternoon; after which the wind became
moderate.</p>
<p>At two o'clock this afternoon, having run through a very
dangerous breaking sea, the cause of which I attributed to a strong
tide setting to windward, and shoal water, we discovered a spacious
bay or sound, with a fair entrance about two or three miles wide. I
now conceived hopes that our voyage was nearly at an end, as no
place could appear more eligible for shipping, or more likely to be
chosen for an European settlement: I therefore came to a grapnel
near the east side of the entrance, in a small sandy bay, where we
saw a hut, a dog, and some cattle; and I immediately sent the
boatswain and gunner away to the hut, to discover the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>The S W point of the entrance bore W 1/2 S three miles; the S E
point S by W three quarters of a mile; and the island Roti from S
by W 1/4 W to S W 1/4 W, about five leagues.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
14.</div>
<p>While we lay here I found the ebb came from the northward, and
before our departure the falling of the tide discovered to us a
reef of rocks, about two cables length from the shore; the whole
being covered at high-water, renders it dangerous. On the opposite
shore also appeared very high breakers; but there is nevertheless
plenty of room, and certainly a safe channel for a first-rate man
of war.</p>
<p>The bay or sound within, seemed to be of a considerable extent;
the northern part, which I had now in view, being about five
leagues distant. Here the land made in moderate risings joined by
lower grounds. But the island Roti, which lies to the southward, is
the best mark to know this place.</p>
<p>I had just time to make these remarks, when I saw the boatswain
and gunner returning with some of the natives. I therefore no
longer doubted of our success, and that our most sanguine
expectations would be fully gratified. They brought five Indians,
and informed me that they had found two families, where the women
treated them with European politeness. From these people I learned,
that the governor resided at a place called Coupang, which was some
distance to the N E. I made signs for one of them to go in the
boat, and show me Coupang, intimating that I would pay him for his
trouble; the man readily complied, and came into the boat.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
14.</div>
<p>These people were of a dark tawny colour, and had long black
hair; they chewed a great deal of beetle, and wore a square piece
of cloth round their hips, in the folds of which was stuck a large
knife. They had a handkerchief wrapped round their heads, and at
their shoulders hung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id=
"Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> another tied by the four corners,
which served as a bag for their beetle equipage.</p>
<p>They brought us a few pieces of dried turtle, and some ears of
Indian corn. This last was most welcome to us; for the turtle was
so hard, that it could not be eaten without being first soaked in
hot water. Had I staid they would have brought us something more;
but, as the pilot was willing, I was determined to push on. It was
about half an hour past four when we sailed.</p>
<p>By direction of the pilot we kept close to the east shore under
all our sail; but as night came on, the wind died away, and we were
obliged to try at the oars, which I was surprised to see we could
use with some effect. However, at ten o'clock, as I found we got
but little ahead, I came to a grapnel, and for the first time I
issued double allowance of bread and a little wine to each
person.</p>
<p>At one o'clock in the morning, after the most happy and sweet
sleep that ever men had, we weighed, and continued to keep the east
shore on board, in very smooth water; when at last I found we were
again open to the sea, the whole of the land to the westward, that
we had passed, being an island, which the pilot called Pulo Samow.
The northern entrance of this channel is about a mile and a half or
two miles wide, and I had no ground at ten fathoms.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
14.</div>
<p>Hearing the report of two cannon that were fired, gave new life
to every one; and soon after we discovered two square-rigged
vessels and a cutter at anchor to the eastward. I endeavoured to
work to windward, but we were obliged to take to our oars again,
having lost ground on each tack. We kept close to the shore, and
continued rowing till four o'clock, when I brought to a grapnel,
and gave another allowance of bread and wine to<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> all
hands. As soon as we had rested a little, we weighed again, and
rowed till near day-light, when I came to a grapnel, off a small
fort and town, which the pilot told me was Coupang.</p>
<p>Among the things which the boatswain had thrown into the boat
before we left the ship, was a bundle of signal flags that had been
made for the boats to show the depth of water in sounding; with
these I had, in the course of the passage, made a small jack, which
I now hoisted in the main shrouds, as a signal of distress; for I
did not choose to land without leave.</p>
<p>Soon after day-break a soldier hailed me to land, which I
instantly did, among a croud of Indians, and was agreeably
surprised to meet with an English sailor, who belonged to one of
the vessels in the road. His captain, he told me, was the second
person in the town; I therefore desired to be conducted to him, as
I was informed the governor was ill, and could not then be spoken
with.</p>
<p>Captain Spikerman received me with great humanity. I informed
him of our miserable situation; and requested that care might be
taken of those who were with me, without delay. On which he gave
directions for their immediate reception at his own house, and went
himself to the governor, to know at what time I could be permitted
to see him; which was fixed to be at eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>I now desired every one to come on shore, which was as much as
some of them could do, being scarce able to walk: they, however,
got at last to the house, and found tea with bread and butter
provided for their breakfast.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>

<p>The abilities of a painter, perhaps, could never have been
displayed to more advantage than in the delineation of the two
groups of figures, which at this time presented<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
themselves. An indifferent spectator would have been at a loss
which most to admire; the eyes of famine sparkling at immediate
relief, or the horror of their preservers at the sight of so many
spectres, whose ghastly countenances, if the cause had been
unknown, would rather have excited terror than pity. Our bodies
were nothing but skin and bones, our limbs were full of sores, and
we were cloathed in rags; in this condition, with the tears of joy
and gratitude flowing down our cheeks, the people of Timor beheld
us with a mixture of horror, surprise, and pity.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
14.</div>
<p>The governor, Mr. William Adrian Van Este, notwithstanding his
extreme ill-health, became so anxious about us, that I saw him
before the appointed time. He received me with great affection, and
gave me the fullest proofs that he was possessed of every feeling
of a humane and good man. Sorry as he was, he said, that such a
calamity could ever have happened to us, yet he considered it as
the greatest blessing of his life that we had fallen under his
protection; and, though his infirmity was so great that he could
not do the office of a friend himself, he would give such orders as
I might be certain would procure me every supply I wanted. In the
mean time a house was hired for me, and, till matters could be
properly regulated, victuals for every one were ordered to be
dressed at his own house. With respect to my people, he said I
might have room for them either at the hospital or on board of
captain Spikerman's ship, which lay in the road; and he expressed
much uneasiness that Coupang could not afford them better
accommodations, the house assigned to me being the only one
uninhabited, and the situation of the few families such, that they
could not accommodate any one. After this conversation an elegant
repast was set before me, more according to the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> custom
of the country, than with design to alleviate my hunger: so that in
this instance he happily blended, with common politeness, the
greatest favour I could receive.</p>
<p>On returning to my people, I found every kind relief had been
given to them. The surgeon had dressed their sores, and the
cleaning of their persons had not been less attended to, besides
several friendly gifts of apparel.</p>
<p>I now desired to be shewn to the house that was intended for me,
and I found it ready, with servants to attend, and a particular
one, which the governor had directed to be always about my person.
The house consisted of a hall, with a room at each end, and a loft
over-head; and was surrounded by a piazza, with an outer apartment
in one corner, and a communication from the back part of the house
to the street. I therefore determined, instead of separating from
my people, to lodge them all with me; and I divided the house as
follows: One room I took to myself, the other I allotted to the
master, surgeon, Mr. Nelson, and the gunner; the loft to the other
officers; and the outer apartment to the men. The hall was common
to the officers, and the men had the back piazza. Of this I
informed the governor, and he sent down chairs, tables, and
benches, with bedding and other necessaries for the use of every
one.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
14.</div>
<p>The governor, when I took my leave, had desired me to acquaint
him with every thing of which I stood in need; but I was now
informed it was only at particular times that he had a few moments
of ease, or could attend to any thing; being in a dying state, with
an incurable disease. On this account, whatever business I had to
transact would be with Mr. Timotheus Wanjon, the second of this
place, and the governor's son-in-law; who now also was
contribut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg
85]</a></span>ing every thing in his power to make our situation
comfortable. I had been, therefore, misinformed by the seaman, who
told me that captain Spikerman was the next person to the
governor.</p>
<p>At noon a very handsome dinner was brought to the house, which
was sufficient to make persons, more accustomed to plenty, eat too
much. Cautions, therefore, might be supposed to have had little
effect; but I believe few people in such a situation would have
observed more moderation. My greatest apprehension was, that they
would eat too much fruit.</p>
<p>Having seen every one enjoy this meal of plenty, I dined with
Mr. Wanjon; but I found no extraordinary inclination to eat or
drink. Rest and quiet, I considered, as more necessary to my doing
well, and therefore retired to my room, which I found furnished
with every convenience. But, instead of rest, my mind was disposed
to reflect on our late sufferings, and on the failure of the
expedition; but, above all, on the thanks due to Almighty God, who
had given us power to support and bear such heavy calamities, and
had enabled me at last to be the means of saving eighteen
lives.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">June</span>
14.</div>
<p>In times of difficulty there will generally arise circumstances
that bear more particularly hard on a commander. In our late
situation, it was not the least of my distresses, to be constantly
assailed with the melancholy demands of my people for an increase
of allowance, which it grieved me to refuse. The necessity of
observing the most rigid &oelig;conomy in the distribution of our
provisions was so evident, that I resisted their solicitations, and
never deviated from the agreement we made at setting out. The
consequence of this care was, that at our arrival we had still
re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
86]</a></span>maining sufficient for eleven days, at our scanty
allowance: and if we had been so unfortunate as to have missed the
Dutch settlement at Timor, we could have proceeded to Java, where I
was certain every supply we wanted could be procured.</p>
<p>Another disagreeable circumstance, to which my situation exposed
me, was the caprice of ignorant people. Had I been incapable of
acting, they would have carried the boat on shore as soon as we
made the island of Timor, without considering that landing among
the natives, at a distance from the European settlement, might have
been as dangerous as among any other Indians.</p>
<p>The quantity of provisions with which we left the ship, was not
more than we should have consumed in five days, had there been no
necessity for husbanding our stock. The mutineers must naturally
have concluded that we could have no other place of refuge than the
Friendly Islands; for it was not likely they should imagine, that,
so poorly equipped as we were in every respect, there could have
been a possibility of our attempting to return homewards: much less
will they suspect that the account of their villany has already
reached their native country.</p>

<p>When I reflect how providentially our lives were saved at Tofoa,
by the Indians delaying their attack, and that, with scarce any
thing to support life, we crossed a sea of more than 1200 leagues,
without shelter from the inclemency of the weather; when I reflect
that in an open boat, with so much stormy weather, we escaped
foundering, that not any of us were taken off by disease, that we
had the great good fortune to pass the unfriendly natives of other
countries without accident, and at last happily to meet with the
most friendly and best of people to relieve our dis<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>tresses;
I say, when I reflect on all these wonderful escapes, the
remembrance of such great mercies enables me to bear, with
resignation and chearfulness, the failure of an expedition, the
success of which I had so much at heart, and which was frustrated
at a time when I was congratulating myself on the fairest prospect
of being able to complete it in a manner that would fully have
answered the intention of his Majesty, and the honourable promoters
of so benevolent a plan.</p>
<p>With respect to the preservation of our health, during a course
of 16 days of heavy and almost continual rain, I would recommend to
every one in a similar situation the method we practised, which is
to dip their cloaths in the salt-water, and wring them out, as
often as they become filled with rain; it was the only resource we
had, and I believe was of the greatest service to us, for it felt
more like a change of dry cloaths than could well be imagined. We
had occasion to do this so often, that at length all our cloaths
were wrung to pieces: for, except the few days we passed on the
coast of New Holland, we were continually wet either with rain or
sea.</p>
<p>Thus, through the assistance of Divine Providence, we surmounted
the difficulties and distresses of a most perilous voyage, and
arrived safe in an hospitable port, where every necessary and
comfort were administered to us with a most liberal hand.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Timor.</div>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class="smcap">July</span>.</div>
<p>As, from the great humanity and attention of the governor, and
the gentlemen, at Coupang, we received every kind of assistance, we
were not long without evident signs of returning health: therefore,
to secure my arrival at Batavia, before the October fleet sailed
for Europe, on the first of July, I purchased a small schooner; 34
feet long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg
88]</a></span> for which I gave 1000 rix-dollars, and fitted her
for sea, under the name of His Majesty's schooner Resource.</p>
<div class="sidenote">July. 20.</div>
<p>On the 20th of July, I had the misfortune to lose Mr. David
Nelson: he died of an inflammatory fever. The loss of this honest
man I very much lamented: he had accomplished, with great care and
diligence, the object for which he was sent, and was always ready
to forward every plan I proposed, for the good of the service we
were on. He was equally useful in our voyage hither, in the course
of which he gave me great satisfaction, by the patience and
fortitude with which he conducted himself.</p>
<div class="sidenote">July. 21.</div>
<p>July 21st. This day I was employed attending the funeral of Mr.
Nelson. The corpse was carried by twelve soldiers drest in black,
preceded by the minister; next followed myself and second governor;
then ten gentlemen of the town and the officers of the ships in the
harbour; and after them my own officers and people.</p>
<p>After reading our burial-service, the body was interred behind
the chapel, in the burying-ground appropriated to the Europeans of
the town. I was sorry I could get no tombstone to place over his
remains.</p>
<p>This was the second voyage Mr. Nelson had undertaken to the
South Seas, having been sent out by Sir Joseph Banks; to collect
plants, seeds, &amp;c. in Captain Cook's last voyage. And now,
after surmounting so many difficulties, and in the midst of
thankfulness for his deliverance, he was called upon to pay the
debt of nature, at a time least expected.</p>
<div class="sidenote">August 20.</div>
<p>August the 20th. After taking an affectionate leave of the
hospitable and friendly inhabitants, I embarked, and we sailed from
Coupang, exchanging salutes with the fort and shipping as we ran
out of the harbour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id=

<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class=
"smcap">August</span>.</div>
<p>I left the governor, Mr. Van Este, at the point of death. To
this gentleman our most grateful thanks are due, for the humane and
friendly treatment that we have received from him. His ill state of
health only prevented him from showing us more particular marks of
attention. Unhappily, it is to his memory only that I now pay this
tribute. It was a fortunate circumstance for us, that Mr. Wanjon,
the next in place to the governor, was equally humane and ready to
relieve us. His attention was unremitting, and, when there was a
doubt about supplying me with money, on government account, to
enable me to purchase a vessel, he chearfully took it upon himself;
without which, it was evident, I should have been too late at
Batavia to have sailed for Europe with the October fleet. I can
only return such services by ever retaining a grateful remembrance
of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Max, the town surgeon, likewise behaved to us with the most
disinterested humanity: he attended every one with the utmost care;
for which I could not prevail on him to receive any payment, or to
render me any account, or other answer, than that it was his
duty.</p>
<p>Coupang is situated in 10&deg; 12&acute; S latitude, and
124&deg; 41&acute; E longitude.</p>
<div class="sidenote">August 29.</div>
<p>On the 29th of August, I passed by the west end of the Island
Flores, through a dangerous strait full of islands and rocks; and,
having got into the latitude of 8&deg; S, I steered to the west,
passing the islands Sumbawa, Lombock, and Bali, towards Java, which
I saw on the 6th of September. I continued my course to the west,
through the Straits of Madura.</p>
<div class="sidenote">September 10.</div>
<div class="sidenote">Passourwang</div>
<p>On the 10th of September, I anchored off Passourwang, in
latitude 7&deg; 36&acute; S, and 1&deg; 44&acute; W of Cape
Sandana, the N E end or Java.<span class='pagenum'><a name=

<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class=
"smcap">September</span></div>
<p>On the 11th I sailed, and on the 13th arrived at Sourabya,
latitude 7&deg; 11&acute; S, 1&deg; 52&acute; west.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sourabya. Crissey.</div>
<p>On the 17th of September, sailed from Sourabya, and the same day
anchored at Crissey, for about two hours, and from thence I
proceeded to Samarang. Latitude of Crissey 7&deg; 9&acute; S,
1&deg; 55&acute; west.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Samarang.</div>
<div class="sidenote">Batavia.</div>
<p>On the 22nd of September, anchored at Samarang; latitude 6&deg;
54&acute; S; 4&deg; 7&acute; W. And on the 26th I sailed for
Batavia, where I arrived on the 1st of October. Latitude 6&deg;
10&acute; S; 8&deg; 12&acute; W from the east end of Java.</p>
<p>On the day after my arrival, having gone through some fatigue in
adjusting matters to get my people out of the schooner, as she lay
in the river, and in an unhealthy situation, I was seized with a
violent fever.</p>
<p>On the 7th, I was carried into the country, to the
physician-general's house, where, the governor-general informed me,
I should be accommodated with every attendance and convenience; and
to this only can I attribute my recovery. It was, however,
necessary for me to quit Batavia without delay; and the governor,
on that account, gave me leave, with two others, to go in a packet
that was to sail before the fleet; and assured me, that those who
remained should be sent after me by the fleet, which was to sail
before the end of the month: that if I remained, which would be
highly hazardous, he could not send us all in one ship. My sailing,
therefore, was eligible, even if it had not been necessary for my
health; and for that reason I embarked in the Vlydt packet, which
sailed on the 16th of October.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Cape of Good Hope.</div>
<div class="sidenote">1789. <span class=

<p>On the 16th of December, I arrived at the Cape of Good Hope
where I first observed that my usual health was<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
returning; but for a long time I continued very weak and
infirm.</p>
<p>I received the greatest attention and politeness from the
governor-general, and all the residents on the coast of Java; and
particular marks of friendship and regard from the governor, M. Van
de Graaf, at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>On the 2d of January, 1790, we sailed for Europe, and on the
14th of March, I was landed at Portsmouth by an Isle of Wight
boat.</p>
