<h3>[Introduction]</h3>
<div class="negindent2"><i>To the British and other European<br>
Inhabitants of NEW SOUTH WALES<br>
and NORFOLK ISLAND</i>.</div>
<br>
<p>My Beloved,<br>
<br>
I Do not think it necessary to make an apology for putting this
Address into your hands; or to enter into a long detail of the
reasons which induced me to write it.</p>
<br>
<p>One reason may suffice. I find I cannot express my regard for
you, so often, or so fully, as I wish, in any other way.</p>
<br>
<p>On our first arrival in this distant part of the world, and
for some time afterwards, our numbers were comparatively small;
and while they resided nearly upon one spot, I could not only
preach to them on the Lord's day, but also converse with them,
and admonish them, more privately.</p>
<br>
<p>But since that period, we have gradually increased in number
every year (notwithstanding the great mortality we have sometimes
known) by the multitudes that have been sent hither after us. The
colony already begins to spread, and will probably spread more
and more every year, both by new settlements formed in different
places under the crown, and by a number of individuals
continually becoming settlers. Thus the extent of what I call my
parish, and consequently of my parochial duty, is enlarging
daily. On the other hand, my health is not so good, nor my
constitution so strong, as formerly. And therefore I feel it
impracticable, and impossible for me, either to preach, or to
converse with you so freely, as my inclination and affection
would prompt me to do.</p>
<br>
<p>I have therefore thought it might be proper for me, and I hope
it may prove useful to you, to write such an Address as I now
present you with. I transmitted a copy of it to my friends in
England with a request, that if they approved of it, a sufficient
number might be printed, and sent to me. Thus I am now able to
leave with you a testimony of my affection for you, and of my
sincere and heart-felt concern, for your <i>best</i>, because
your <i>eternal</i>, welfare. My times are in the hand of God.
He, and He only, knows how long I may live, or how long my
present connection with you, may continue. I trust, however, that
so long as the all-wise Disposer of all events shall be pleased
to spare my life, and strength; and government shall deem my
services in this remote land, necessary, it will still be, as it
has hitherto been, my most ardent desire, my uniform endeavour,
and my greatest pleasure, to promote your happiness. And when
recalled to my native country, or removed by my God to my eternal
home, to receive that crown of righteousness, which I humbly
trust is laid upon me, by reading and carefully perusing the
following pages, I hope you will be convinced, and reminded how
sincerely you were pitied, and how dearly beloved by</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> Author hopes that all
well-disposed persons will excuse the imperfections they may meet
in this Address. It is the first time of his appearance in print,
and may be the last. Nor would he have attempted it now, were it
not for the very peculiar situation he is in, and the hope he
entertains, that his feeble, but he trusts, sincere, attempt,
may, by the blessing of God, be made useful to those unhappy
persons, with whom he is so nearly connected, and for whose
salvation and happiness he is so deeply concerned.</p>
<br>
<p>And he returns his most sincere and hearty thanks to true
Christians of every denomination, for their kind remembrance of
him at the throne of grace. He still hopes, because he still
needs, a continuance of their fervent prayers to God for him,
that he may be endued with those gifts, and with that wisdom,
zeal, and faithfulness which are so needful to direct, support,
and strengthen him&mdash;and may be favoured with more manifold
and abundant success in that arduous, trying, yet honourable, and
at times he can say, pleasant and delightful work, in which he is
engaged.</p>

<br>
<a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>
<h3>PART I.</h3>
<br>
<p><span class="aa">I Beseech</span> you, brethren, suffer this
word of exhortation. Your souls are precious. They are precious
in the sight of God. They are precious to the Lord Jesus Christ.
They are precious in my esteem. Oh that you yourselves were
equally sensible of their value.</p>
<br>
<p>We have now been here almost five years. During this time, I
trust, I have been faithful in the discharge of my duty, faithful
to my God, my country, my conscience, and to your immortal
souls.</p>
<br>
<p>I would, nay I do, humbly hope, that my labours have not been
wholly in vain. Some of you, I trust, have been convinced of your
folly, sin and danger; you have earnestly sought, and happily
found mercy with God through a Mediator. You can now approach him
as a God reconciled, a merciful Father and Friend, and are
evidencing the reality of you conversion, by an upright life and
conversation</p>
.<br>
<p>But I must express my fear, that those of you, who are thus
convinced of sin, and converted to God, and reformed from your
evil courses, are comparatively very few. It is too evident, that
the far greater part of you discover no concern for religion. The
Great God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, death,
judgment, eternity, heaven and hell,&mdash;these are subjects
which seldom, if at all, engage your attention; and therefore you
spend days, weeks, months and years, in a profane and careless
manner, though you are repeatedly informed and reminded in the
most plain, faithful, and alarming language I can use, that the
wages of sin, without repentance, is death,* the curse of God,
and the eternal ruin and damnation of your souls!</p>
<p class="foot">[* Rom. vi. 23.]</p>
<br>
<p>Oh, I intreat you, brethren, to consider what is contained in
these two words, <i>salvation</i> and <i>damnation</i>! The one
implies every thing that an immortal soul can want or desire to
make it happy. The other includes an idea, the most gloomy and
dreadful that can be conceived. The former will be the admiration
of angels, and the song and joy of the redeemed; the latter will
be the torment of devils, and of all impenitent sinners, for ever
and ever.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** 1 Pet. i. 12. Rev. vii. 9-17. Rev. xiv.
11.]</p>
<br>
<p>Remember likewise, that ere long, either this endless
inconceivable happiness, or unutterable misery will be your
portion, or your doom, and mine. Our glass of life is running
away apace. Our time is fast hastening to a period. Death is
making sure and speedy strides towards us daily, judgment is at
hand, and the judge himself is at the door. And oh! consider,
when the breath we now draw shall depart, the tender thread of
life be cut, our state will be unalterably and for ever fixed;
either to live with God, with angels, and glorified saints, in
heaven; or to dwell with devils, in the darkness and torments of
hell.</p>
<br>
<p>On these accounts your souls are, as I have already observed,
very precious, not only in the sight of God, but also to me. My
brethren, God is my record, how greatly I long after you all, in
the bowels of Jesus Christ.* Next to the salvation of own foul,
nothing in this world lies so near my heart, as the conversion
and salvation of my fellow creatures; and especially of you, over
whom I am appointed more immediately to watch, as one who must
give an account.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* Phil. i. 8.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Heb. xiii. 17.]</p>
<br>
<p>And oh, my friends, if this affectionate, though plain
address, should answer my ardent wishes and prayers, if it should
prove the happy means of converting even one soul to God, I
should indeed rejoice, as one that findeth great spoil.* For
once, at least, endeavour to lift up your hearts with me in
prayer to Almighty God, the bountiful giver of all grace. He only
can make this or any other means effectual; and should it please
Him of his abounding mercy to make a saving impression upon your
hearts, you will reap the happy fruits of it in life, at death,
and to eternity. Oh that the gracious spirit of the Lord may open
the eyes and the ears of all who may read or hear what I am
writing. May they who are asleep, awake! May they who are
spiritually dead, be made alive! May backsliders from God be
reclaimed! May every one be stirred up to consider, What will
become of him in another world! For who amongst us can dwell with
everlasting burnings? * Yet such <i>must</i> be our lot, unless
we repent. May the Lord God give, to each of you, repentance unto
life, that you may be holy in this world, and happy in that which
is to come!</p>
<p class="foot">[* Ps. cxix. 162.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Isa. xxxiii. 14.]</p>
<br>
<p>My brethren, I trust I can say in truth, and with a sincere
conscience, That I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.* It is
a knowledge, and I hope an inward experience of this precious
gospel, that bears up my spirits when I am ready to sink as in
deep waters, and when I am almost overwhelmed by the many heavy
and daily trials, crosses, difficulties and disappointments, that
I meet with in this, alas! most uncomfortable situation. An
acquaintance with this gospel, an experience of its truth and
power, sweetens every bitter, makes my crosses comforts, and my
losses gains. It is by this knowledge that I am enabled to bear
the cross of Christ, not only with some degree of patience and
resignation, but at some seasons, with consolation and joy; while
I at one time reflect on what our dear Lord and Saviour endured
for me, and at another anticipate the unspeakable honour and
pleasure, which, through grace, I hope ere long to enjoy at his
right hand for evermore. And to endeavour to bring you, my dear
friends, to a saving knowledge of what is contained in this
gospel, is not only my duty and inclination as a minister, but
also my earnest desire and pleasure, and that which I long for
more than for any other thing that can be named.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* Rom. i. 16.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Rom. x. 1.]</p>
<br>
<p>I have often explained to you, according to my sentiments,
what is contained in the gospel. But as I fear, and am indeed
well aware, that many of you, after all you have heard, still
remain ignorant, I will now tell you again briefly and plainly,
what my views of the gospel are; that by putting this book into
your hands, you may, if you please, more carefully and
attentively examine and search for yourselves, whether what I lay
before you be agreeable to the holy scriptures, or otherwise; and
consequently, whether you ought to believe, or to reject it.</p>
<br>
<p>The gospel, I conceive, in its most extensive sense,
comprehends the whole revealed will of God, recorded in the holy
scriptures of the Old and New Testament.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Tim. iii. 16.]</p>
<br>
<p>This sacred book, which we call the Bible, describes the
original state of man, as a state of perfect purity and
innocence. He was made in the image of God. He was made
upright.** His understanding, will, his affections and
conscience, his body and soul, were free from defilement, guilt,
or guile, and while he continued so, he was not liable to pain,
misery, or death.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Gen. i. 26, 27. Eccles. vii. 29.]</p>
<br>
<p>But man did not continue in this state. Our first parents
disobeyed their Maker. By sinning against God they lost their
original righteousness, and became earthly, sensual, devilish.
Such are all his posterity: for who can bring a clean thing out
of an unclean? Man is now the very reverse of what he was when
first created. His understanding * is darkened, yea darkness
itself; his will, his carnal mind, is enmity against God; his
conscience is defiled; his affections, no longer fixed upon God
his Creator and Benefactor, are engrossed by the vain and
perishing things of this world; by sin his body is become mortal.
Subject to pain, disease, and death;** and his soul is exposed to
the displeasure of God, and to the curse annexed to the
transgressions of his holy law. All this misery is implied in
that awful threatening, In the day that thou eatest thereof thou
shalt surely die.***</p>
<p class="foot">[* 2 Cor. iv. 5. Ephes. iv. 18. Titus i. 15. Rom.
viii.7.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Rom. v. 12.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Gen. ii. 17.]</p>
<br>
<p>And is not this threatening, at least in part, already put
into execution? Whence is there so much ignorance and contempt of
God? Why do mankind so eagerly, so universally pursue the vain
pleasures and follies of the world, while they seldom think of
God their Maker? From whence proceed the infidelity, blasphemy,
lying, theft, sabbath-breaking, slandering and the many horrid
evils, which every where abound? Whence is it that so many in
this colony, labour under such sore and complicated disorders,
pains, and miseries? Why are so many, both young and old, taken
away by death? And why is it that others who see all those
things, do not take warning by them, to prepare for their own
latter end? Brethren, all these are so many undeniable proofs and
evidences of what I have said; namely, that we are fallen and
guilty creatures. These are the effects of Adam's sin and
disobedience. The certain consequences of which would have been
unavoidable and endless misery, both of soul and body, to himself
and all his posterity, had not some means been provided, some way
laid open, for his and their recovery.</p>
<br>
<p>But, blessed be God, a door of hope is opened by the gospel
for miserable sinners! A gracious promise was given early, even
to our first parents, immediately after their fall. The seed of
the woman shall break the serpent's head.* This promised seed is
the Lord Jesus Christ, who, in due time, was to appear in the
world, to be born of a woman, that by his life, sufferings, and
obedience unto death, he might recover fallen man from the misery
and ruin in which he was involved. Brethren, this gospel which,
as the ministers and ambassadors of God, we are commissioned and
commanded to preach to sinners, proposes a free and gracious
pardon to the guilty, cleansing to the polluted, healing to the
sick, happiness to the miserable, light for those who sit in
darkness, strength for the weak, food for the hungry, and even
life for the dead.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* Gen. iii. 15.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Gal. iv. 4, 5. Gal. iii. 13. 1 John i. 7.
Matt. xi. 28. Matt. xi. 5.]</p>
<br>
<p>All these inestimable blessings are the fruits and effects of
the death and mediation of Jesus Christ. His great design in
coming into the world was to seek and to save those who are
lost;* he came from heaven, that he might raise us to those holy
and happy mansions; he endured the curse, that we might inherit
the blessing; he bore the cross, that we might wear the crown; he
died, that we might live; he died, the just for the unjust, that
he might bring us to God.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* Luke xviii. 10. 1 Tim. i. 15.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** 1 Pet. iii. 18.]</p>
<br>
<p>These blessings become ours, only by believing, or faith. Thus
it is said, God so loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son&mdash;For what purpose? Why, That whosoever
<i>believeth</i> in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life;*&mdash;he that believeth in him is not condemned; he that
believeth in him who justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted
to him for righteousness.** My friends, search the scriptures,
and you will find that this is the tenor of the whole Bible; I
may add of our church also, in the Articles and Homilies. This
believing is sometimes called a coming to Christ, a looking unto
Christ, a trusting in him, a casting our burden upon him.*** And
remember, that until we do thus come to Christ, trust in him,
cast our cares and burdens upon him, we have no part or interest
in what the gospel unfolds and offers; however others, who have
believed, and daily act faith upon him, are rejoicing in the
participation of those rich benefits and blessings which the
gospel freely offers to guilty and perishing sinners.</p>
<p class="foot">[* John iii. 16, 18.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Rom. iv. 3, 6.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** John vi. 37. Isa. xlv. 22. Eph. i. 12. Ps.

<br>
<p>The faith whereby a sinner receives Christ, and becomes a
partaker of all the blessings of the gospel, is the sole gift of
God, wrought in the heart by his Holy Spirit.* This Holy Spirit
produces an inward change in the soul, called, in the scripture,
the new birth, regeneration,** or conversion, and thus enables a
sinner, convinced of his sin and misery, to look to Jesus, and to
believe on him.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Eph. ii. 8.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** John iii. 3-7]</p>
<br>
<p>But though repentance and faith are the gifts of God, which
none can obtain by any endeavours of their own, yet we are
encouraged and commanded to pray for them.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Luke xi. 17.]</p>
<br>
<p>All who have thus, through grace, believed, and are daily
living a life of faith in the Son of God, shall be saved: but
such as carelessly neglect, or wilfully reject this gospel must
be damned.** Think, I beseech you, of this! Remember, that it is
the solemn declaration of the Lord Jesus Christ himself.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mark xvi. 15.]</p>
<br>
<p>Now is the time to obtain the blessings revealed in the
gospel, and which are set before you when it is preached. Many
have had these gracious declarations made to them, before we were
born, and they will be repeated to many after we are dead. But
<i>this</i> is our day. <i>Now</i> is the accepted time, now is
the day of salvation.* <i>To-day</i>&mdash;for you and I may not
live to see to-morrow. To-day; if you will hear his voice, harden
not your hearts.** My brethren, it is your duty, your wisdom, and
will finally prove to be your greatest happiness, to seek an
interest in this salvation for yourselves. It is your personal,
and must be your heart concern, to make your calling and election
sure.***</p>
<p class="foot">[* 1 Cor vi. 2.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Heb. iii. 7, 8.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** 2 Pet. i. 10.]</p>
<br>
<p>For death will soon put a period to all the overtures of grace
and mercy, with which many, and particularly <i>you</i>, are now
favoured. It is as I have said, both my duty and my pleasure, to
preach and proclaim these glad tidings. But to whom? Not to the
dead, but to the living; even to you.* To you is the word of the
salvation sent. But, alas! should you still put it from you, and
should death at last find you in an unprepared state, it will
then be too late for you to begin to cry for mercy.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* Acts xv. 22.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Eccl. ix. 10.]</p>
<br>
<p>A day is likewise coming, when our mortal bodies, which must
shortly moulder into dust, will be raised again from the dead.
Whether believers or unbelievers, whether saints or sinners, we
must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ.* For the Lord
Jesus will shortly appear in the clouds of heaven, the last
trumpet shall sound, the graves shall open, the sea give up her
dead, and all who have lived upon earth, from the creation to the
final consummation of time, will then be judged, and rewarded or
punished according to their works. Mark well St. John's
representation of this solemn transaction, "I saw the dead, small
and great, stand before God, and the books were opened, and
another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead
were judged out of those things which were written in the books,
according to their works." ** Such are the declarations of
scripture respecting this awful season! Sinners, whatever you may
now think of these things, or think or say of me, for declaring
them to you, in this, plain and solemn manner, I must and will
tell you, that there is not a profane oath which you have
uttered, nor a lie which you have told, nor a sabbath which you
have broken, nor a single act of adultery, fornication, theft, or
any wickedness of which you have been guilty; in a word, there is
not an evil you have committed, nor a duty you have omitted to
perform, but what is noted down in the book of God's remembrance,
and will be produced against you in the day of judgment, unless
you repent, and believe the gospel. You must then give an account
how you improved the advantages now afforded you, for attending
to the things pertaining to your peace. If you do not improve
them, the Bible will condemn you, every faithful sermon you have
heard will condemn you, nay, every sermon which you might have
heard, but would not, because you despised and neglected the
ordinances of public worship, will condemn you: And alas! this
address, by which I try to warn you, because I love you, and wish
well to your souls; which you are now reading, or perhaps, about
to throw aside with scorn, will then condemn you. The
admonitions, intreaties, prayers, and tears of godly parents, the
advice and reproofs of pious friends, the warning and
expostulations of faithful ministers, will all witness against
you. My brethren, what shall I say? The law of God, the gospel,
saints, sinners, angels, your own consciences, the Holy Spirit,
the Lord Jesus, the great Judge himself, will all witness against
you, for your contempt and neglect of that mercy and salvation,
which are set before you in the gospel.</p>
<p class="foot">[* 2 Cor. v. 10. Dan. 12. 2. Matt. xxv. 21.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Rev. xx. 12, 13.]</p>
<br>
<p>Then all ungodly and impenitent sinners, being tried, cast,
and condemned, must hear that final terrible sentence pronounced
upon them, Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for
the devil and his angels! * And remember that those who have been
your associates in wickedness here, will then be your companions
in misery. This will, if possible, aggravate your torment. You
and they will rue the day when you first met; and mutually charge
the ruin of your souls upon each other. Oh, think of this, and
pray for grace to repent, before it be too late!</p>
<p class="foot">[* Matt. xxv. 41.]</p>
<br>
<p>At that solemn season, the righteous shall be publicly and
fully acquitted before the assembled world. The judge will say to
them, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
for you, from the foundation of the world.** The holy angels will
then conduct them to the mansions of eternal bliss. Happy souls!
They will then have no more cause to weep and mourn, to fight and
wrestle. They will no more be exercised with darkness or
temptation; for sin, which is the cause of all their conflicts
and sorrows, shall be done away; and God their gracious Father,
and everlasting Friend, shall wipe all tears from their
eyes.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** Matt. xxv. 34.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Rev. vii. 17.]</p>
<br>
<p>The righteous, however obscured and reproached upon earth,
shall then shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their
Father. They are represented to us, as standing before the
throne, clothed in white robes, with palm-branches (the emblems
of victory) in their hands, and singing to their harps their
Redeemer's praise.* There they will join in company with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, with the apostles, prophets, and martyrs, with
their dear friends and relatives, who died in the faith before
them, and with the glorious angels; and above all, (without which
heaven itself would be no heaven to them) they will enjoy the
unclouded presence of their Lord and Saviour, who once suffered
pain, and shame, and death for them. They will see him seated
upon a throne of glory, and unite with all the heavenly host, in
ascribing salvation, glory, and honour, and praise to him who
loved them, and washed them from their sins in his own blood; and
has made them kings and priests to God, and to the Lamb, for ever
and ever.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* Matt. xiii. 43. Rev vii. 9, 10.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Rev. v. 9.]</p>
<br>
<p>For the joys of heaven, and the pains of hell will be eternal.
Otherwise, indeed, neither the happiness nor the misery of a
future state could be complete. It would damp the joys of the
blessed, to apprehend that they must at length terminate. And the
horrors of the damned would be in a degree alleviated, if there
was the most distant prospect that they would have a period. But
the word of God assures us, that believers, after death, enter
into life eternal, and that the punishment of the wicked will be
everlasting.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Matt. xxv. 46. Dan. xii. 2. 2 Thes. i.

<br>
<p>I have now given you a summary of the great truths, which, as
a minister of the gospel, I am commissioned and commanded to
preach. And I can call God and your consciences to witness, that
I have not shunned thus to declare to you the whole counsel of
God.* I have explained to you the meaning, and I have urged the
importance of these things over and over. I have pointed out to
you, the wretched and dangerous condition of sinners, the
necessity of conversion or the new birth, the nature of this
change, and by what power it is wrought, and the fruits and
effects which such a change will produce in a man's tempers,
words and actions. I have also shewn you the way, in which you
<i>may</i> and must be saved, if you are saved at all. I have
told you again and again, that Christ is the Way, the truth, and
the life, and that there is no coming to God with comfort, either
in this world, or in that which is to come, but by him. He has
told you so himself.** And the apostle assures you, that there is
no other name under heaven, given unto men, whereby they can be
saved. Look unto him, and you shall be saved; if not, you must be
damned. This is the plain truth, the express declaration of the
Bible. Life and death are set before you.***</p>
<p class="foot">[* Acts xx. 27.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** John xiv. 6. Acts iv. 12.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Deut. xxx. 15.]</p>
<br>
<p>Permit me then, as your minister, your friend, and a
well-wisher to your souls, to press these serious and weighty
considerations home upon your consciences once more. I hope and
believe that I have affected nothing, but what can be proved by
the highest authority, the word of the living God. They certainly
deserve your closest and most careful attention, since it is
plain beyond a doubt, that upon your knowledge or ignorance, your
acceptance or rejection of this gospel, your everlasting
happiness or misery must depend.</p>
<br>
<p>Brethren, I do not ask you, what religious persuasion or
denomination you have espoused. I fear, that, if I may judge of
your hearts by your actions, too many are destitute of any sense
of religion at all. But I do not address you as Churchmen or
Dissenters, Roman Catholics or Protestants, as Jews or Gentiles;
I suppose, yea, I know, that there are persons of every
denomination amongst you. But I speak to you as men and women, as
intelligent creatures, possessed of understanding and reason. I
speak to you as mortals, and yet immortals; as sinners, who have
broken the laws of God, and are therefore obnoxious to his
displeasure. And my sole aim and desire is, to be instrumental in
turning you from darkness to light, from sin to holiness, from
the power of Satan to the service and favour of God.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Acts xxvi. 18.]</p>
<br>
<p>Seek then, I beseech you, above all things, an interest in the
blessings of the gospel. Be assured it is a matter of much less
moment, whether you are rich or poor, respected or despised in
this world. The rich have their cares, fears, crosses, and
vexations, no less than the poor; but admitting that they could
pass through life with greater ease than others, we all know that
they cannot escape death. The great point is, how we shall die?
whether as believers or unbelievers, as saints or sinners. One
soul, according to our Lord's declaration, is of more value than
the whole world.* If you lose your soul, you lose all at once.
You lose heaven and happiness for ever. Whatever, therefore, you
do, or leave undone, for God's sake, and for your own sakes,
neglect not for one day or hour longer, the vast concerns of
another life. Delays are dangerous. The more we have to risk or
lose, the greater folly it would be accounted, to defer securing
our property and goods, which we know to be in danger. What
folly, therefore, what madness must it be, to put off with
careless indifference, the concernments of eternity; and to
prefer the trifles of this transitory life to heaven, and the
favour of God! Let the parable of the rich man, who pleased
himself with the thought of having much good laid up for many
years, be a warning to you! ** That very night his soul was
required of him. Such persons may now deem themselves wise; but
ere long they will be sensible they were fools.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mark viii. 36.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Luke xii. 16-28.]</p>
<br>
<p>If you consider what a valuable price was paid for our
redemptions you must be convinced that the soul of man is very
precious in the sight of God, and that sin is not so light and
small an evil, as many of you have supposed. To disobey the
commandments of the just and holy God, is, as far as in us lies,
to renounce our allegiance to him, and our dependence upon him,
and to set up for ourselves, and even to join with the devil in
open rebellion against our Maker. It is, in plain terms, to fly
in his face, and to bid defiance to his almighty arm. Sin is such
a horrid evil, that unless it is forgiven, and blotted out, by
the blood of Jesus, it will sink your souls lower than the center
of the earth, even into the very depths of hell, never, never,
never more to rise.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mark ix. 44-48.]</p>
<br>
<p>So heinous was sin, in the sight of God, that rather than
permit it to pass unpunished, he would punish it in the person of
his own, his only, his well-beloved Son, who was made sin, that
is, treated as a sinner deserved to be treated, for us. He was
delivered up into the hands of wicked men, and crucified, that by
his suffering and death, he might make atonement for our sins,
and procure an honourable and happy reconciliation, between a
righteous God, and offending sinners.** I beseech you, therefore,
to prize and to study this gospel, that you may obtain a growing
experience of its benefits. Praise God for such a Saviour, and
such a salvation as he has provided. Adore him, for that infinite
wisdom, and boundless mercy which he has displayed in the
redemption of fallen man and never rest, nor be satisfied, till
you have good and scriptural reason to hope, that this Saviour is
yours, with all the blessings he is exalted to bestow without
money and without price.</p>
<p class="foot">[** 2 Cor. v. 18-20.]</p>
<br>
<p>Our food, my brethren, then only can nourish us, when it is
eaten and digested. Medicines can only profit us, by being
applied and taken. It is exactly thus with the gospel. We may
hear, and talk of these things, but so long as they remain
matters of speculation, and do not enter into our hearts, into
the very vitals of our souls, (if I may so speak) we cannot be
the better for them. Christ is the bread of life. His flesh is
meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed! But unless we
ourselves do <i>spiritually</i> eat the flesh and drink the blood
of the Son of man (for our Lord speaks of food for the soul, not
for the body) we have no life in us.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** John vi. 52-58.]</p>
<br>
<p>Moses, by the express command of God, erected a brazen serpent
upon a pole, in the view of the camp of Israel.* Such of the
people as were stung by the fiery serpents, were directed and
commanded to look up to the brazen serpent. They who did so were
healed. But if any resisted, they were sure to die. For no other
means or physicians could relieve them. In like manner Christ
Jesus our Saviour, once lifted up on the cross, is exhibited in
the preaching of the gospel. Sinners, who are wounded and
diseased by sin, are directed, exhorted, encouraged, and
commanded to look up to him.** And they who are persuaded so to
do, are infallibly cured of all those spiritual maladies, under
which they have long and sorely laboured. But all, who despise
and reject this sovereign remedy of God's gracious appointment,
either by a total indifference to religion, or by expecting
salvation in any other way, will be left, and that most
deservedly, to perish in their wilful obstinacy and
unbelief.***</p>

<h3>PART II</h3>
<p><span class="aa">In</span> the former part of this address, I
have already laid before you, in the plainest manner I was able,
my views of the gospel of Christ. And as an experimental
knowledge of this gospel is so very important, I have endeavoured
to press that importance upon your consciences. Whether you have
paid that attention to the subject, which it deserves and
requires, yourselves best know. I can only say, that if I did not
know it to be of great weight, I should not either speak or write
of it with so much earnestness. But being persuaded and assured,
by the express testimony of the holy scriptures, that these
things are true; and truths, the knowledge of which is essential
to your present and future happiness, I must be plain and
faithful in declaring them. I ought to be very indifferent what
men of depraved morals, and corrupt principles may say, or think
of me, if I have the witness of a good conscience, and the
approbation of the God whom I serve. My concern is for
<i>your</i> welfare and salvation; for I am certain, as I have
told you before, and now tell you again, that unless the gospel
is made the power of God to your souls, you must be miserable in
time, and to eternity.</p>
<br>
<p>I propose now to give you some advices, to assist you in
understanding the gospel for yourselves, which if you observe, I
trust, you will attain to the possession of those principles, and
walk by those rules, which will both afford you present peace,
and secure your future happiness. For godliness has promises
pertaining to the life that now is, and to that which is to
come.</p>
<br>
<p>Let me then exhort you to attend seriously to what you are to
believe; and to what you are to do. These two points include the
sum and substance of the gospel, the whole of the christian life,
and may be comprised in two words, <i>faith</i> and
<i>practice</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>I. You must learn from the word of God, what you are to
believe. True faith is the root and foundation of all real
religion. Without this inward principle, nothing that we have
done, or can do, will be acceptable to God.* I have briefly
informed you what you are to believe&mdash;That you are sinners,
that Jesus Christ is an all-sufficient and willing
Saviour&mdash;and that the word of God both warrants and commands
you to look to him for salvation. This looking unto Jesus, is
what we particularly mean by faith or believing. When we
cordially and entirely rely upon him, upon the invitation of the
promises of God, for pardon, peace, and eternal life, then we
believe.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Heb. xi. 6.]</p>
<br>
<p>All who thus believe, through grace, are required and
commanded to be careful of maintaining good works.* As our moral,
and what are often called, our virtuous actions, are to be tried
by our religious principles; it is equally true, that our
religious principles or at least the proof that they are indeed
<i>our</i> principles, must be evidenced by our moral conduct.
These two are so inseparably connected, that you may depend upon
it, where one of them is wanting, what bears the name of the
other, is no better than pretended. If what we profess to believe
does not make us humble, honest, chaste, patient, and thankful,
and regulate our tempers and behaviour, whatever good opinion we
may form of our notions or state, we are but deceiving ourselves.
The tree is known by its fruits.** In this way true believers are
equally distinguished from profane sinners, and from specious
hypocrites. The change in their hearts always produces a change
in their whole deportment. Sin, which was once their delight, is
now the object of their hatred. It was once necessary as their
food, but now they avoid it as poison. They war, watch, and pray
against it. And their delight is to study the revealed will of
God.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Titus. iii. 8.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** James. ii. 17, 18. Matt. vii. 20.]</p>
<br>
<p>By these tests you may judge of your true state before God.
Surely you cannot suppose that your inward state is <i>good</i>,
while your outward conduct is <i>bad</i>. Hence you may be
assured that no unclean person, or profane swearer, no one who
lives in direct opposition to the commands of God, can be, while
he continues in this course, a true christian. Such a supposition
would be no less absurd, than it would be to suppose, that a man
is a good and peaceable subject, though he lives in open
rebellion against the king. You may as well conceive of a holy
devil, as of an unholy christian.</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you will not mistake me. I do not mean that true
christians are without sin. But I affirm, that no true christian
can live in an habitual course of sin. No, sin is their grief,
their burden;* and when through temptation, or unwatchfulness,
they are drawn aside, like the dove sent out of the ark, they can
find no rest, till by hearty repentance, and true faith, they
obtain a new sense of forgiveness.</p>
<p class="foot">[* 1 John. iii. 8, 9. Rom. vii. 23, 24.]</p>
<br>
<p>I now proceed to offer you some directions, with which if you
comply, I trust, that by the blessing of God, you will enjoy
peace in your souls, and be enabled to regulate your conduct and
conversation, as becometh the gospel of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>Read and study the scriptures. This was our Lord's direction
to the Jews. Search the scriptures, for in them ye think ye have
eternal life, and they testify of me.** The Bereans were
commended for their attention and diligence in this respect. They
received the word with all readiness of mind, not with a blind
and implicit faith in what they heard, even from an apostle, but
they searched the scriptures daily, to know whether what he
taught them was agreeable to the word of God.</p>
<p class="foot">[** John v. 37. Acts xvii. 11.]</p>
<br>
<p>The Bible is our only sure and infallible guide. It was given
by inspiration of God. All other books, however good and useful,
are but of human composition, and are therefore not perfect.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* 2 Tim. 3-16. Isa. viii. 20.]</p>
<br>
<p>This sacred book, as I have already observed to you, contains
all that is needful to make us wise unto salvation. It informs us
of our original, how pure and innocent; and our present
condition, how guilty, polluted and miserable! and the happiness
or misery which awaits us in a future state. From this book we
may learn, the malignity of sin, the holiness, spirituality,
extent, and sanction of the law of God; and consequently, the
just and certain condemnation due to our disobedience. It shews
us, likewise, the way of our recovery. How perfectly the
mediation of Christ is suited to vindicate the honour of the law,
and to display the justice of God, in harmony with his mercy, and
thereby to give peace to the consciences of convinced
sinners.</p>
<br>
<p>I intreat you, therefore, to read the word of God carefully.
Many of you have had Bibles or New Testaments given to you, and
others might have them, if they had but an inclination to
read.</p>
<br>
<p>Some of you will perhaps object, and say, as you have already
said to me, We cannot read. Others, We have no time given us. If
you cannot read yourselves, you might prevail on some of your
comrades to read to you.* As to your having no time, I much
question it. Rather you have no inclination. Too many of you can
find time to jest, to talk obscenely or profanely, to read and
sing idle songs; why might not some, or rather the whole of this
time be employed in reading, or hearing the Bible? You might find
time, if you could find a will. But remember, that such excuses
as you now make, will stand you in no stead when you appear
before God in judgment. There are few, if any of you, but might
have opportunity of attending to these things, if you were but
willing.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Two or three hours thus spent on the Lord's
day, in instructing each other to read, would be a very
commendable employment. I have often expressed my longing desire
that such a plan was set on foot among you. And if there could be
a convenient building created for this purpose, I should think
myself happy, not only to furnish you with books, as far as I am
able, but also personally to attend and assist you, as much as my
immediate calls of duty would permit.&mdash;R.J.]</p>
<br>
<p>II. Observe and reverence the sabbath, or Lord's day. Remember
the sabbath-day, to keep it holy,** is a solemn and positive
command of God. To live in the neglect of this commandment, is
absolutely to despise God, and to defy him, as it were to his
face. Consider, my friends, you have orders frequently given you
here, by your superiors, which you know you must obey, or you
know the consequences of disobedience&mdash;judge then for
yourselves, what have those persons to expect, who, in defiance
of the authority of the great God, presume to neglect and profane
the day which he has so expressly enjoined to be kept holy?</p>
<p class="foot">[** Exod. xx. 8.]</p>
<br>
<p>It gives me a deep and continual concern to observe how the
Lord's-day is spent by many of you. What would a stranger think,
who regards the sabbath, if he visited every part of this colony
on the Lord's day? Ah! my brethren, I have seen and heard enough
(alas! much more than enough) to form my own judgment on this
subject. If my duty did not require my attendance on the public
worship, and were I to visit your different places and huts, I
fear I should find some of you spending the hours appointed for
divine service in cultivating your gardens and grounds, others
indulging themselves in mere sloth and idleness, others engaged
in the most profane and unclean conversation, and others
committing abominations, which it would defile my pen to
describe. Now what must be the end of these courses? God says,
Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. But the language, both
of your hearts and actions, is, "We will not keep it holy. It is
a day given us for ourselves; and we wish, and we are resolved to
spend it as we please. We do not chuse to be confined, or
compelled to hear so much preaching and praying." Is not this the
language of your hearts? Your conduct too plainly proves it: but,
my brethren, let me reason and expostulate a little with you upon
this head.</p>
<br>
<p>Consider, what have been the consequences to many who have
thus broken God's commands. I have known, and you likewise have
known, those who have been brought to an untimely and disgraceful
end, and who have dated their ruin from this one evil, the
profanation of the Lord's day. Instead of spending it in the
manner which he has enjoined, they kept bad and profligate
company. By this practice, all serious impressions (if they
formerly had any) have been driven from their minds. Their hearts
have become more and more hardened and insensible; till at
length, lost to all prudent reflection, they have regarded
neither the tender solicitations and tears of parents, relations,
and friends, the faithful warnings of ministers, nor the checks
and rebukes of their own consciences. And what has been the
event? I need not tell you, that having given way to their own
wicked wills, the advice and example of their ungodly companions,
and the temptations of the devil (for, be assured, that he is
always at the bottom of these mischiefs) they have, at length,
committed some act of depredation and villainy, which has brought
them to an untimely grave.</p>
<br>
<p>Such, brethren, have been the free and ingenuous confessions
of many of those unhappy people who have suffered death. And if
you were to speak the sentiments of your hearts, I doubt not, but
many of you, who by the mercy of God are yet living, would make
the like acknowledgment; that breaking the sabbath was the first
step towards bringing you into that pitiable situation, in which
you either have been, or still are suffering. And will you still
persevere in the road of misery? Will you still prefer the chains
of your own depraved inclinations, to the service of God, which
is perfect freedom? According to the Jewish law, a man was stoned
to death, for gathering sticks on the sabbath day,* whereas you
are doing a number of things on the Lord's day, which might as
well be done before, or left undone till afterwards. But such is
the long-suffering of the Lord, that though others have been cut
off, you are spared to this hour. May his goodness lead you to
repentance! Or otherwise, light as these things may appear to you
now, and though you may plead a necessity for what you do, I tell
you again, as I have often told you before, that a day is coming
when God will call you to a strict account.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Numb. xv. 32-36.]</p>
<br>
<p>Besides, If you would reasonably hope for the blessing of God
to succeed your labours, it is certainly your interest, as well
as your duty to obey his commands. And this in particular, Keep
the sabbath day holy. If, in direct opposition to this plain,
precept, you will work and labour, as on other days, what ground
can you have to expect that God will bless and prosper your
undertakings? You have much greater cause to fear that his curse
will follow you in your affairs, and blast and disappoint all
your wishes and prospects.</p>
<br>
<p>Let then the misconduct and fatal ends of others, and the
calamities and troubles that you have brought upon
yourselves&mdash;Let the gracious promises of God, on the one
hand, and his awful threatenings on the other, induce you, in
future, to remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy!</p>
<br>
<p>And let me offer you a few plain directions, as to the
observance and improvement of the sabbath:</p>
<br>
<p>Begin the day with prayer; and for this purpose seek some
place of retirement, if you find it impracticable to meditate or
pray, from the interruptions you are exposed to in your
dwellings,* from those who ridicule and scoff at every appearance
of religion. Retire from them, and pray to him who seeth in
secret; and praise him for the many mercies you have received.
Consider with yourself, how little you have improved them. Humble
yourselves before God, under a sense of your sins and
imperfections, and pray for pardon and repentance. Intreat him,
to enable you to watch over your hearts, words, and actions,
throughout the day, and that you may not be hindered or hurt by
the snares and temptations around you. Intreat God to assist your
minister, and to accompany what you may hear from him, with a
blessing to your soul, and to all who shall be present with
you.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Many complaints have been made to me on this
head.&mdash;R.J.]</p>
<br>
<p>If you have families, you should call them together, and pray
with them, and for them. There are many promises made to
worshiping families, and to those who, like Abraham, endeavour to
teach their children and household to know and serve the Lord.**
And the neglect of this is one reason, why many families live
uncomfortably. They live without prayer, and therefore without
peace.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Gen. xviii. 19. Prov. iii. 33.]</p>
<br>
<p>Having thus endeavoured to impress your minds with serious
thoughts, in secret or at home; attend constantly upon the public
worship, and there pay a close attention to every part of the
service. Remember that the eye of God is particularly upon you
there. He has promised to be with two or three that meet together
to call upon his name.* He is to be worshipped in spirit and in
truth; and whether they assemble in a church, or in the open air,
he can give them cause to say with Jacob, This place is surely
the house of God, and the gate of Heaven.** Attend the public
worship again in the afternoon, with your hearts lifted up to
God, that you may not hear in vain; and accustom yourself in the
evening to recollect what you have heard, concerning the miseries
which sin has brought into the world, the love of God in sending
his own Son to redeem sinners from those miseries; the
sufferings, life, death, and resurrection of the Saviour; and
that eternal rest, which remaineth for the people of
God&mdash;<i>For you</i>, and <i>for me</i>, if we are believers
in Christ.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Matt. xviii. 20. John iv. 24]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Gen. xxviii. 17.]</p>
<br>
<p>If, by the blessing of God, I can happily persuade you thus to
observe and improve the Lord's day, I am sure it will promote
both your pleasure and your profit. Can it be a question with
you, whether the God who made heaven and earth, or Satan, the god
of this world, is the best master? Indeed I too well know the
indisposition and averseness of the carnal mind to God and his
ways. Hence the thought of many is, What a weariness is it? And,
When will the sabbath be ended? Hence that open contempt and
scorn, which is cast upon the sabbath, and upon public worship by
many, both high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, old and
young, men and women. To them the worship of God is tedious and
disagreeable. They neither find pleasure in it, nor expect
benefit from it. And therefore their attendance is not from
choice, but from constraint.</p>
<br>
<p>But the thoughts and the conduct of true Christians are very
different. No day is so welcome to them as the Lord's day; not
merely considered as a day of rest from labour; but because,
having their heads and hearts freed from the cares and
incumbrances of the world, it affords them opportunities of
waiting upon God. And, brethren, you must allow that these
persons are best qualified to judge of the question I have
proposed, Whether is best, to walk in the ways of God, or in the
ways of sin? For they have experienced both sides of the
question. They have tried the pleasures of the world, and they
have also tried the pleasures of religion. And they will readily
assure you, that in their deliberate judgment, one day thus spent
in devotion, and the exercises of religion, is preferable to a
thousand days wasted in the vain and unsatisfying pleasures,
which they sought in their former wicked practices.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Ps. lxxxiv. 10.]</p>
<br>
<p>I have written thus largely upon the due observance of the
Lord's day, because of that shameful, open, and general neglect,
that daring profanation of the Sabbath, which abounds amongst us.
It is well known, and it is matter of great grief and concern to
me, that numbers of you pay not the least regard to this day.
Numbers of you will not come to public worship at all, others but
seldom, and then with much reluctance. And when spoken to,
different persons frame different excuses, all which, when
examined, amount to little more than a want of inclination.</p>
<br>
<p>I have here a more special reference to those of you, who are
called Settlers and Free People. You think, perhaps, and some of
you say, That having served out your appointed term, you are now
your own masters, and have therefore a right to employ your time
as you please. But, indeed, it is not so. I must tell you,
brethren, that my commission from God, and my appointment from
government, extend equally and alike to all the inhabitants,
without distinction. It is my duty to preach to all, to pray for
all, and to admonish every one. And it is no less the duty of
all, to come to public worship, to hear the gospel, and to pray
for me. These mutual ties and obligations between you and me, are
not lessened by any change in your circumstances. And remember,
that the slight you put upon the public worship, is not properly
a slight of me (if that was all, it would be a matter of utter
indifference) but upon the Lord himself; for I trust it is his
message, and not my own, that I deliver to you.** I wish,
therefore, what I have said upon this subject, to be understood
as addressed TO ALL, whether of higher or lower rank, who are
guilty of breaking the sabbath. Whatever our station or calling
may be, our obligations to keep holy the sabbath-day, are
precisely the same. If any are more inexcusable than the rest, it
must be those, who, from their station and office, are peculiarly
bound to set a good example to others. I hope this friendly hint
will be received in good part. I mean not to offend. But I must
admonish you, that whatever be your situation in life, you will
gain nothing in the end, by doing what God forbids, nor will you
be a loser by yielding strict obedience to his commands.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Luke x. 16.]</p>
<br>
<p>III. Be constant and diligent in prayer to God. Intreat him to
give his blessing to what you read and hear, and to all your
concerns. As we are weak and needy creatures, always dependent
upon God, and always receiving mercies and favours from him, we
ought to be frequent and earnest in prayer. Daniel was accustomed
to pray three times in the day.* I hope you will be punctual in
prayer, morning and evening, at least. So long as any of you live
without prayer, you live without Christ, without hope, and
without God in the world. They, who do not pray to God while upon
earth, will not be admitted to praise him in heaven. When the
rich careless man who had fared sumptuously every day, for a
time, lifted up his eyes in torments, he only desired and prayed
for a drop of water to cool his tongue, but it was not granted to
him. Oh! if you value your souls, pray earnestly to God. Consider
your obligations to do so. He is your Creator, Preserver,
Benefactor. In him you live and move, and have your being. And
therefore not to acknowledge, by prayer, your dependence upon
him, would manifest the greatest ingratitude and insensibility.
Consider, likewise, the encouragement you have to pray. Though
you are by nature sinners, and by practice enemies and rebels, he
gives you free and sure promises, that whoever is disposed to
return to him, and seek him by earnest prayer, shall not seek him
in vain. Oh! my brethren, that there was less cursing and
swearing, and more prayer among you!</p>
<p class="foot">[* Dan. vi. 10. Ephes. ii. 12.]</p>
<br>
<p>After these positive directions what you ought <i>to do</i>, I
proceed to some necessary cautions, against what you ought to
avoid.</p>
<br>
<p>I. Profane swearing is one thing against which I am especially
bound to warn you, because it is an evil which so much abounds
amongst you.</p>
<br>
<p>God has said, Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God
in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless, that taketh
his name in vain. Our Saviour likewise has said, Swear not at
all.* But how can you reconcile these prohibitions to your
conduct; or your consciences? When instead of not swearing at
all, many of you seldom open your lips, but the first and last
words which you utter, are blasphemous oaths, and horrid
imprecations? Is this acting like rational or accountable
creatures? Who gave you the powers of reason and speech? Was it
not God? And can you think that he gave them to you, that you may
blaspheme his holy name, and to use the most profane, obscene,
and desperately wicked language your hearts can invent; a
language only fit for incarnate devils, and shocking to the ears
of the ignorant heathens? This is a dreadful evil which you may
be assured, will not pass unpunished. This sin has often brought
heavy judgments upon individuals, families, and kingdoms. Because
of swearing the land mourneth.** Shall not I visit for these
things, saith the Lord?</p>
<p class="foot">[* Exod. xx. 7. Matt. v. 34.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Jer. xxiii. 10]</p>
<br>
<p>As a proof of the enormity of this sin, you read, that Moses,
by the command of God, ordered a man to be stoned to death, for
cursing and blaspheming;* and it would be well, both on their own
account, and for the good of others, if magistrates would
strictly discharge their duty, by enforcing the laws of our land,
which are engaged against this horrid practice. And in few
places, perhaps in no place, such strictness would be more
needful, or more salutary, than in this colony.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Lev. xxiv. 10-16.]</p>
<br>
<p>Our Lord assures us, that for every idle word that men shall
speak they shall give an account in the day of judgment! ** How
dreadful then will be the case of those persons, who during their
whole life have employed their tongues in cursing, swearing,
lying, and all manner of vile and unclean conversation. Oh! think
of this in time, and tremble and repent, and learn to use your
tongues to better purpose in future! Read carefully the third
chapter of James, and pray to God for his grace, and use your
best endeavours to bridle your tongues which, if you do not
subdue and conquer, will surely destroy and ruin you.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Matt. xii. 36]</p>
<br>
<p>II. Consider, also, what must be the consequence of that
unclean and adulterous course of life, which many of you follow.
Common as this wickedness is in our colony (I believe no where
more so) do not suppose, that the frequency will take away, or in
the least abate the criminality of it. Neither suppose that this
sin is less odious in the sight of God if committed in Port
Jackson, than in England. You may frame excuses or plead
necessity, for what you do, or permit to be done; but the word of
God by which you must be at last judged, admits, of no plea, or
excuse. The command is positive and absolute. The declaration of
God, Thou shalt not commit adultery,* is equally binding upon
persons of all ranks to whom it is known, at all times, and in
all places. Think not, that the holy and just God will dispense
with his law, or relax the sentence he has denounced against the
breach of it, that you may with impunity indulge your corrupt
desires. No; it is written, whoremongers and adulterers God will
judge. The apostle declares that no fornicator, adulterer, or
unclean person, can enter into the kingdom of God; he repeats
this warning nearly in the same words, a second and a third time.
The heavens and the earth shall pass away; but not one jot or
tittle of his word can fail. All shall be fulfilled.** And
therefore, however this sin may be connived at by some, and
committed by others, God will severely punish offenders, unless
they repent of their wickedness and forsake it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Exod. xx. 14]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Heb. xiii. 4. Gal. v. 17-21. Eph. v.
3-5.]</p>
<br>
<p>But I need not enlarge upon this subject, I have told you my
thoughts of it again and again with faithfulness. It seems the
plainness of my language has hurt <i>the delicate</i> feelings of
some, and the faithfulness I have used has excited the censure
and ill-will of others. But why am I blamed, if I have only
affirmed and proved from the scriptures, that no fornicator,
adulterer, or unclean person can go to heaven <i>when he
dies</i>, unless he repents of his evil practices, and turns from
them, <i>while he lives</i>?</p>
<br>
<p>But whether you will hear, or whether you will forbear, I must
repeat the unwelcome truth. My conscience, my duty, and my
compassion, all urge me to deal faithfully with you. I mean and
desire to be understood, and therefore I must speak plainly. It
is my intention and desire to awaken and alarm your consciences:
but alas! after all I can say or do, I am too little understood
or regarded. But I must deliver my own soul, whether you will
regard me or not. The day is coming when the Lord himself will
judge between you and me. Oh, repent, repent, before it be too
late.</p>
<br>
<p>III. The conduct of too many of you induces me to exhort and
caution you farther against theft, and all kinds of dishonesty
and villainy.</p>
<br>
<p>I have often told you, both publicly and privately, that
honesty is the best policy. None have more reason to be convinced
of this, than you who come hither as convicts. You have known by
bitter experience, the unhappy consequences of dishonesty. Have
not many of you, for the sake, perhaps, of a few shillings,
unjustly obtained, plunged yourselves into misery for the
remainder of your lives? Several have made this acknowledgment to
me, in their dying moments. Learn therefore, strive, and pray to
be honest. Honesty has its present advantages. An honest man,
however poor, can face this world with confidence. But a
dishonest behaviour, with its constant attendant a guilty
conscience, will always fill the mind with fear and dismay.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Job xxiv. 16, 17.]</p>
<br>
<p>I do not mean, my friends, to reflect harshly upon you for
what is past, and cannot be recalled. I pity your past
misconduct; I sympathize with you under your present sufferings.
And therefore I admonish and caution you to abstain from this
course for the time to come. Let then the troubles and
afflictions you have brought upon yourselves be a warning, to
regulate your future behaviour. Learn to be thankful for what God
in his providence gives you, whether it be more or less. Attend
to what our Lord says, Whatsoever ye would that men should do
unto you, do ye even so unto them. And to his apostle's
direction, Let him that hath stolen, steal no more, but rather
let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good,
that he may have to give to him that needeth.** Follow this
advice, and you will soon experience the benefit.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Matt. vii. 12. Eph. iv. 24.]</p>
<br>
<p>IV. Beware of idleness. This is the forerunner of many evils.
Poverty, disease, disgrace, misery, and too often an untimely
death, are the consequences of sloth and indolence. Yield not to
idleness; if you indulge it, you will find it grow upon you.
Therefore, be diligent and industrious in your lawful callings.
It is written in the Bible, and confirmed by experience and
observation, The idle soul shall suffer hunger, but the soul of
the diligent shall be made fat.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Prov. xix. 15. &amp; xiii. 14.]</p>
<br>
<p>V. Be careful also to pay due respect, submission, and
obedience to your superiors. It is the good pleasure of God that
some should be placed in more exalted, and others in a more
humble station. And it is a proof of his wisdom and goodness. The
present state of the world, and the general good of mankind,
render such distinctions necessary. But whether we are high or
low, whether called to command, or required to obey, our duties
and obligations are mutual. It is in society as in the human
body. There are many members, and every member has its proper
place, and its proper office. Let every soul be subject to the
higher powers.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Rom. xiii. 1.]</p>
<br>
<p>I have thus given you my best advice respecting what you ought
to do, or to avoid. Permit me to invite your serious attention to
what I have written. Consider it carefully <i>for your own
sakes</i>. It concerns your <i>present</i> comfort. For though no
works of ours, or what are called, moral virtues, can possibly
procure us the favour of God, (for our best services are
imperfect and defiled, and need forgiveness) yet that knowledge
and experience of the gospel, which I have explained to you in
the first part of this Address, (and of which I earnestly pray
you may be made partakers) must be accompanied by a correspondent
conduct, such as I have set before you in the second part. And
this knowledge and this conduct will always be attended, though
not always in the same degree, with an inward settled peace,
whereby the mind is reconciled to support crosses and
afflictions, however great, or of long continuance, with a degree
of fortitude and resignation. Persons under this influence will
say, when they meet with troubles, I will bear the indignation of
the Lord, because I have sinned against him.* Should it please
God, to answer the earnest desire of my soul, by giving you an
experience of the gospel peace, you will thank and praise him,
even for bringing you hither; and you will see and confess, that
your heaviest afflictions have, in the event, proved to be your
greatest mercies.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Micah vii. 9.]</p>
<br>
<p>Your <i>future</i> comfort and welfare in this world, depends
upon this knowledge. For though no one knows what may befal him
in this life, yet the real christian has the comfort of knowing,
that however it may go with the wicked, or whatever may happen to
himself of a temporal nature, or whatever may become of his body,
he is sure (because God has promised) that it shall be well with
his soul at death. Ah! my brethren, then, more especially then,
believers will find the advantage of having made the word of God
the foundation of their hope, and the rule of their life!</p>
<br>
<p>Several of you, some to my knowledge, have left affectionate,
tender, and serious friends, husbands, wives, parents, brothers,
sisters, or children, in your native country, to lament your
misconduct, the sufferings you have brought upon yourselves, and
the disgrace in which you have involved your families. Let me
intreat you, <i>for the sake of these</i>, to consider your ways.
Great comfort it will afford to those who are now almost
overwhelmed with grief on your account, to hear of your
reformation and conversion. These would be glad tidings, indeed,
from a far country. The hopes they might then form of seeing you
again, would be truly pleasing; it would be little less than
receiving you again from the dead. Or if they never see you in
this world, the prospect of meeting with you in heaven, would add
comfort to their dying hours. Oh! let not their prayers and their
tears be lost upon you!</p>
<br>
<p>Attend to these things, <i>for the sake of others</i>, who may
follow you hither, in the like unhappy circumstances. When they
see your reformation, and that in consequence of it, you are more
comfortable here than you were at home, they may be induced and
encouraged to follow your examples. Thus you will be instrumental
in saving souls from death.</p>
<br>
<p>I would farther plead with you, for the sake of the poor
unenlightened savages, who daily visit us, or who reside amongst
us. If these ignorant natives, as they become more and more
acquainted with our language and manners, hear you, many of you,
curse, swear, lie, abound in every kind of obscene and profane
conversation; and if they observe, that it is common with you to
steal, to break the sabbath, to be guilty of uncleanness,
drunkenness, and other abominations; how must their minds become
prejudiced and their hearts hardened against that pure and holy
religion which we profess? Oh beware of laying stumbling-blocks
in the way of these blind people,** lest the blood of their souls
be one day required at your hands.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Lev. xix. 14.]</p>
<br>
<p>And yet I fear, yea, I well know, that they have already heard
and seen too much of such language, and such practices amongst
us. Already some of them have been taught to speak such language
as they continually hear, and though they do not yet understand
the meaning of the words they use, they can utter oaths and
blasphemies almost as readily as their <i>Christian</i>
instructors. By-standers divert themselves with their attempts in
this way, and think it is fine sport. But, my friends, the
scripture declares they are fools who make a mock at sin.* But
these things cause much sorrow to those who have any reverence
for God, or pity for their fellow creatures. I readily profess my
own deep concern for these proceedings, and my utter abhorrence
of them. And I most earnestly intreat you, if you cannot instruct
them in what is better, to have no communication at all with
them. For if you make them partakers of your sins, you must
answer for it at the great day of judgment; if they then rise up
against you, for misleading them, it will be much more tolerable
for them than for you.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Prov. xiv. 9.]</p>
<br>
<p>But consider, on the other hand, what may be the happy
effects, were the natives to see, hear, and observe in you, and
in all the Europeans here; in ministers and people, high and low,
a conduct answerable to the doctrine and precepts of the gospel.
This might, by the blessing of God, be one of the most effectual
means, to bring them to reflection, and to engage them to seek an
interest in the blessings of the gospel for themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>Shall I beg and intreat you, <i>for my sake</i>, to attend to
the things pertaining to your true peace. My dear people, I will
again declare (I can appeal to the great God, who searcheth the
hearts, that I speak the truth) to see you converted from your
evil ways, and seeking the salvation of God, Yes, to see you pay
a due regard to these most important concerns, and to have reason
to hope and believe, that you were brought to a saving
acquaintance with the truths which you hear of, or might hear, as
often as the Lord's day returns, would indeed greatly rejoice my
soul. But to see so many of you turn a careless and deaf ear,
this, my dear friends, is a cause of great, constant and
increasing grief to my soul. It wounds me to think, that any
(alas! what numbers) should thus refuse and reject their own
mercies; and risk the ruin of their immortal souls, for the
prospect of a small gain, or a short sinful gratification.</p>
<br>
<p>My brethren, what shall I, what can I say more. I neither know
what to add, nor how to leave off: once more, I beseech you, for
God's sake, for the sake of Jesus the Saviour, who shed his
precious blood to redeem sinners, and for the sake of your own
souls: by the holy incarnation of the Redeemer, by his agonies,
temptations, death and resurrection, by all the terrors of his
frown, and by all the blessings of his love, by the joys of
heaven, by the torments of hell, and by the solemnities of the
approaching day of judgment; by all these considerations, I most
earnestly, affectionately, and faithfully admonish and intreat
you, carefully to weigh what I have now set before you. And oh!
that the holy angels may carry to heaven the joyful news ** of
some sinners being awakened and born to God, by reading or
hearing this little book. O gracious God, do thou, by the power
of thy Holy Spirit, make it thus effectual to the salvation and
happiness of this people!</p>
<p class="foot">[** Luke xv. 10.]</p>
<br>
<p>And now to this gracious Lord, and to his care and blessing, I
commend you. May he enable you to examine your hearts,
principles, and practice, by the standard of his holy word. If
you are still ignorant and careless, it is a proof that you are,
as yet, in the state of nature, which is a state of darkness,
guilt, condemnation, and death. Will you not pray to be delivered
from it? You must, at least, allow, that perhaps what you have
read, <i>may be</i> the truth. And even, of a possibility of
these things being true, they deserve your earnest attention. For
should they be found so at last, what will become of you, if you
live and die impenitent? Therefore, read this plain, affectionate
Address seriously. Read it a second, a third, and a fourth time,
till your hearts are affected by it. Remember, this is the advice
of a friend, of one who sincerely seeks, wishes, and longs for
your happiness. It is the advice of your minister, expressly
appointed to watch over your souls, and who must shortly give an
account of his mission to the Great judge of all. Whether I shall
die amongst you, or be separated from you while living, we shall,
at last, meet before him. Then <i>I</i> must answer for my
preaching, and <i>you</i> for your hearing. Oh that this awful
day of judgment may be often, yea, always, present to your
thoughts, and to mine! that we may live in constant expectation
of its approach! So that when the last loud trumpet shall sound,
we may stand with acceptance and boldness in his presence, and be
admitted as believers in the great Saviour, into his heavenly
kingdom, with a 'Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord.' *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Matt. xxv. 23.]</p>
<br>
<p>This will be my daily prayer to God for you. I shall pray for
your eternal salvation, for your present welfare, for the
preservation, peace, and prosperity of this colony: and
especially for the more abundant and manifest success of the
Redeemer's cause and kingdom, and for the effusion and
out-pouring of his Holy Spirit, not only here, but in every part
of the habitable globe. Longing, hoping, and waiting for the dawn
of that happy day, when the heathen shall be given to the Lord
Jesus for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth
for his possession: and when all the ends of the earth shall see,
believe, and rejoice in the salvation of God.**</p>
