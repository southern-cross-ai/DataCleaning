     id="chap01">I. THE KNAVE OF CLUBS</a></h2>

  <p>They picked up the young man called "Snow" Gregory from a Lambeth gutter,
  and he was dead before the policeman on point duty in Waterloo Road, who had
  heard the shots, came upon the scene.</p>

  <p>He had been shot in his tracks on a night of snow and storm and none saw
  the murder.</p>

  <p>When they got him to the mortuary and searched his clothes they found
  nothing except a little tin box of white powder which proved to be cocaine,
  and a playing card&mdash;the Jack of Clubs!</p>

  <p>His associates had called him "Snow" Gregory because he was a doper, and
  cocaine is invariably referred to as "snow" by all its votaries. He was a
  gambler too, and he had been associated with Colonel Dan Boundary in certain
  of his business enterprises. That was all. The colonel knew nothing of the
  young man's antecedents except that he had been an Oxford man who had come
  down in the world. The colonel added a few particulars designed, as it might
  seem to the impartial observer, to prove that he, the colonel, had ever been
  an uplifting quantity. (This colonelcy was an honorary title which he held by
  custom rather than by law.)</p>

  <p>There were people who said that "Snow" Gregory, in his more exalted
  moments, talked too much for the colonel's comfort, but people were very
  ready to talk unkindly of the colonel, whose wealth was an offence and a
  shame.</p>

  <p>So they buried "Snow" Gregory, the unknown, and a jury of his fellow-
  countrymen returned a verdict of "Wilful murder against some person or
  persons unknown."</p>

  <p>And that was the end of a sordid tragedy, it seemed, until three months
  later there dawned upon Colonel Boundary's busy life a brand new and alarming
  factor.</p>

  <p>One morning there arrived at his palatial flat in Albemarle Place a
  letter. This he opened because it was marked "Private and Personal." It was
  not a letter at all&mdash;as it proved&mdash;but a soiled and stained playing
  card, the Knave of Clubs.</p>

  <p>He looked at the thing in perplexity, for the fate of his erstwhile
  assistant had long since passed from his mind. Then he saw writing on the
  margin of the card, and twisting it sideways read:</p>

  <p class="cp">"JACK O' JUDGMENT."</p>

  <p>Nothing more!</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment!"</p>

  <p>The colonel screwed up his tired eyes as if to shut out a vision.</p>

  <p>"Faugh!" he said in disgust and dropped the pasteboard into his
  waste-paper basket.</p>

  <p>For he had seen a vision&mdash;a white face, unshaven and haggard, its
  lips parted in a little grin, the smile of "Snow" Gregory on the last time
  they had met.</p>

  <p>Later came other cards and unpleasant, not to say disconcerting
  happenings, and the colonel, taking counsel with himself, determined to kill
  two birds with one stone.</p>

  <p>It was a daring and audacious thing to have done, and none but Colonel Dan
  Boundary would have taken the risk. He knew better than anybody else that
  Stafford King had devoted the whole of his time for the past three years to
  smashing the Boundary Gang. He knew that this grave young man with the
  steady, grey eyes, who sat on the other side of the big Louis XV table in the
  ornate private office of the Spillsbury Syndicate, had won his way to the
  chief position in the Criminal Intelligence Department by sheer genius, and
  that he was, of all men, the most to be feared.</p>

  <p>No greater contrast could be imagined than that which was presented
  between the two protagonists&mdash;the refined, almost aesthetic chief of
  police on the one hand, the big commanding figure of the redoubtable colonel
  on the other.</p>

  <p>Boundary with his black hair parted in the centre of his sleek head, his
  big weary eyes, his long, yellow walrus moustache, his double chin, his
  breadth and girth, his enormous hairy hands, now laid upon the table, might
  stand for force, brutal, remorseless, untiring. He stood for cunning
  too&mdash;the cunning of the stalking tiger.</p>

  <p>Stafford was watching him with dispassionate interest. He may have been
  secretly amused at the man's sheer daring, but if he was, his inscrutable
  face displayed no such emotion.</p>

  <p>"I dare say, Mr. King," said the colonel, in his slow, heavy way, "you
  think it is rather remarkable in all the circumstances that I should ask for
  you? I dare say," he went on, "my business associates will think the same,
  considering all the unpleasantness we have had."</p>

  <p>Stafford King made no reply. He sat erect, alert and watchful.</p>

  <p>"Give a dog a bad name and hang him," said the colonel sententiously. "For
  twenty years I've had to fight the unjust suspicions of my enemies. I've been
  libelled," he shook his head sorrowfully. "I don't suppose there's anybody
  been libelled more than me&mdash;and my business associates. I've had the
  police nosing&mdash;I mean investigating&mdash;into my affairs, and I'll be
  straight with you, Mr. Stafford King, and tell you that when it came to my
  ears and the ears of my business associates, that you had been put on the job
  of watching poor old Dan Boundary, I was glad."</p>

  <p>"Is that intended as a compliment?" asked Stafford, with the faintest
  suspicion of a smile.</p>

  <p>"Every way," said the colonel emphatically. "In the first place, Mr. King,
  I know that you are the straightest and most honest police official in
  England, and possibly in the world. All I want is justice. My life is an open
  book, which courts the fullest investigation."</p>

  <p>He spread out his huge hands as though inviting an even closer inspection
  than had been afforded him hitherto.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stafford King made no reply. He knew, very well he knew, the stories
  which had been told about the Boundary Gang. He knew a little and guessed a
  lot about its extraordinary ramifications. He was well aware, at any rate,
  that it was rich, and that this slow-speaking man could command millions. But
  he was far from desiring to endorse the colonel's inferred claim as to the
  purity of his business methods.</p>

  <p>He leant a little forward.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you didn't send for me to tell me all about your hard lot,
  colonel," he said, a little ironically.</p>

  <p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to get to know you," he said with fine frankness. "I've heard a
  lot about you, Mr. King. I am told you do nothing but specialise on the
  Boundary enterprises, and I tell you, sir, that you can't know too much about
  me, nor can I know too much about you."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"But you're quite right when you say that I didn't ask you to come
  here&mdash;and a great honour it is for a big police chief to spare time to
  see me&mdash;to discuss the past. It is the present I want to talk to you
  about."</p>

  <p>Stafford King nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm a law-abiding citizen," said the colonel unctuously, "and anything I
  can do to assist the law, why, I'm going to do it. I wrote you on this matter
  about a fortnight ago."</p>

  <p>He opened a drawer and took out a large envelope embossed with a monogram
  of the Spillsbury Syndicate. This he opened and extracted a plain
  playing-card. It was a white-backed card of superfine texture, gilt-edged,
  and bore a familiar figure.</p>

  <p>"The Knave of Clubs," said Stafford King lifting his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The Jack of Clubs," said the colonel gravely; "that is its name I
  understand, for I am not a gambling man."</p>

  <p>He did not bat a lid nor did Stafford King smile.</p>

  <p>"I remember," said the detective chief, "you received one before. You
  wrote to my department about it."</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"Read what's written underneath."</p>

  <p>King lifted the card nearer to his eyes. The writing was almost
  microscopic and read:</p>

  <p>"Save crime, save worry, save all unpleasantness. Give back the property
  you stole from Spillsbury."</p>

  <p>It was signed "Jack o' Judgment."</p>

  <p>King put the card down and looked across at the colonel.</p>

  <p>"What happened after the last card came?" he asked, "there was a burglary
  or something, wasn't there?"</p>

  <p>"The last card," said the colonel, clearing his throat, "contained a
  diabolical and unfounded charge that I and my business associates had robbed
  Mr. George Fetter, the Manchester merchant, of L60,000 by means of card
  tricks&mdash;a low practice of which I would not be guilty nor would any of
  my business associates. My friends and myself knowing nothing of any card
  game, we of course refused to pay Mr. Fetter, and I am sure Mr. Fetter would
  be the last person who would ask us to do so. As a matter of fact, he did
  give us bills for L60,000, but that was in relation to a sale of property. I
  cannot imagine that Mr. Fetter would ever take money from us or that he knew
  of this business&mdash;I hope not, because he seems a very
  respectable&mdash;gentleman."</p>

  <p>The detective looked at the card again.</p>

  <p>"What is this story of the Spillsbury deal?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What is that story of the Spillsbury deal?" said the colonel.</p>

  <p>He had a trick of repeating questions&mdash;it was a trick which
  frequently gave him a very necessary breathing space.</p>

  <p>"Why, there's nothing to it. I bought the motor works in Coventry. I admit
  it was a good bargain. There's no law against making a profit. You know what
  business is."</p>

  <p>The detective knew what business was. But Spillsbury was young and wild,
  and his wildness assumed an unpleasant character. It was the kind of wildness
  which people do not talk about&mdash;at least, not nice people. He had
  inherited a considerable fortune, and the control of four factories, the best
  of which was the one under discussion.</p>

  <p>"I know Spillsbury," said the detective, "and I happen to know
  Spillsbury's works. I also know that he sold you a property worth L300,000 in
  the open market for a sum which was grossly inadequate&mdash;L30,000, was it
  not?"</p>

  <p>"L35,000," corrected the colonel. "There's no law against making a
  bargain," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"You've been very fortunate with your bargains."</p>

  <p>Stafford King rose and picked up his hat.</p>

  <p>"You bought Transome's Hotel from young Mrs. Rachemeyer for a sum which
  was less than a twentieth of its worth. You bought Lord Bethon's slate
  quarries for L12,000&mdash;their value in the open market was at least
  L100,000. For the past fifteen years you have been acquiring property at an
  amazing rate&mdash;and at an amazing price."</p>

  <p>The colonel smiled.</p>

  <p>"You're paying me a great compliment, Mr. Stafford King," he said with a
  touch of sarcasm, "and I will never forget it. But don't let us get away from
  the object of your coming. I am reporting to you, as a police officer, that I
  have been threatened by a blackguard, a thief, and very likely a murderer. I
  will not be responsible for any action I may take &mdash;Jack o' Judgment
  indeed!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen him?" asked Stafford.</p>

  <p>The colonel frowned.</p>

  <p>"He's alive, ain't he?" he growled. "If I'd seen him, do you think he'd be
  writing me letters? It is your job to pinch him. If you people down at
  Scotland Yard spent less time poking into the affairs of honest business
  men&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Stafford King was smiling now, frankly and undisguisedly. His grey eyes
  were creased with silent laughter.</p>

  <p>"Colonel, you have <i>some</i> nerve!" he said admiringly, and with no
  other word he left the room.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. JACK O' JUDGMENT&mdash;HIS CARD</a></h2>

  <p>The wrong side of a stage door was the outside on a night such as this
  was. The rain was bucketing down and a chill north-wester howled up the
  narrow passage leading from the main street to the tiny entry.</p>

  <p>But the outside, and the darkest corner of the <i>cul-de-sac</i> whence
  the stage door of the Orpheum Music Hall was reached, satisfied Stafford
  King. He drew further into the shadow at sight of the figure which picked a
  finicking way along the passage and paused only at the open doorway to furl
  his umbrella.</p>

  <p>Pinto Silva, immaculately attired with a white rose in the button- hole of
  his faultless dress-jacket, had no doubt in his mind as to which was the most
  desirable side of the stage door. He passed in, nodding carelessly to the
  doorkeeper.</p>

  <p>"A rotten night, Joe," he said. "Miss White hasn't gone yet, has she?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the man obsequiously, "she's only just left the stage a
  few minutes. Shall I tell her you're here, sir?"</p>

  <p>Pinto shook his head.</p>

  <p>He was a good-looking man of thirty-five. There were some who would go
  further and describe him as handsome, though his peculiar style of good looks
  might not be to everybody's taste. The olive complexion, the black eyes, the
  well-curled moustache and the effeminate chin had their attractions, and
  Pinto Silva admitted modestly in his reminiscent moments that there were
  women who had raved about him.</p>

  <p>"Miss White is in No. 6," said the doorkeeper. "Shall I send somebody
  along to tell her you're here?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't trouble," said the other, "she won't be long now."</p>

  <p>The girl, hurrying along the corridor, fastening her coat as she came,
  stopped dead at the sight of him and a look of annoyance came to her face.
  She was tall for a girl, perfectly proportioned and something more than
  pretty.</p>

  <p>Pinto lifted his hat with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I've just been in front, Miss White. An excellent performance!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said simply. "I did not see you."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>There was a complacency in his nod which irritated her. It almost seemed
  to infer that she was not speaking the truth and that he was humouring her in
  her deception.</p>

  <p>"You're quite comfortable?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite," she replied politely.</p>

  <p>She was obviously anxious to end the interview, and at a loss as to how
  she could.</p>

  <p>"Dressing room comfortable, everybody respectful and all that sort of
  thing?" he asked. "Just say the word, if they give you trouble or cheek, and
  I'll have them kicked out whoever they are, from the manager downwards."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you," she said hurriedly, "everybody is most polite and nice."
  She held out her hand. "I am afraid I must go now. A&mdash;a friend is
  waiting for me."</p>

  <p>"One minute, Miss White." He licked his lips, and there was an
  unaccustomed embarrassment in his manner. "Maybe you'll come along one night
  after the show and have a little supper. You know I'm very keen on you and
  all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"I know you're very keen on me and all that sort of thing," said Maisie
  White, a note of irony in her voice, "but unfortunately I'm not very keen on
  supper and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>She smiled and again held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"I'll say good night now."</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Maisie&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Good night," she said and brushed past him.</p>

  <p>He looked after her as she disappeared into the darkness, a little frown
  gathering on his forehead, then with a shrug of his shoulders he walked
  slowly back to the doorkeeper's office.</p>

  <p>"Send somebody to get my car," he snapped.</p>

  <p>He waited impatiently, chewing his cigar, till the dripping figure of the
  doorkeeper reappeared with the information that the car was at the end of the
  passage. He put up his umbrella and walked through the pelting rain to where
  his limousine stood.</p>

  <p>Pinto Silva was angry, and his anger was of the hateful, smouldering type
  which grew in strength from moment to moment and from hour to hour. How dare
  she treat him like this? She, who owed her engagement to his influence, and
  whose fortune and future were in his hands. He would speak to the colonel and
  the colonel could speak to her father. He had had enough of this.</p>

  <p>He recognised with a start that he was afraid of the girl. It was
  incredible, but it was true. He had never felt that way to a woman before,
  but there was something in her eyes, a cold disdain which cowed even as it
  maddened him.</p>

  <p>The car drew up before a block of buildings in a deserted West End
  thoroughfare. He flashed on the electric light and saw that the hour was a
  little after eleven. The last thing in the world he wanted was to take part
  in a conference that night. But if he wanted anything less, it was to cross
  the colonel at this moment of crisis.</p>

  <p>He walked through the dark vestibule and entered an automatic lift, which
  carried him to the third floor. Here, the landing and the corridor were
  illuminated by one small electric lamp sufficient to light him to the heavy
  walnut doors which led to the office of the Spillsbury Syndicate. He opened
  the door with a latchkey and found himself in a big lobby, carpeted and
  furnished in good style.</p>

  <p>A man was sitting before a radiator, a paper pad upon his knees, and he
  was making notes with a pencil. He looked up startled as the other entered
  and nodded. It was Olaf Hanson, the colonel's clerk&mdash;and Olaf, with his
  flat expressionless face, and his stiff upstanding hair, always reminded
  Pinto of a Struwwelpeter which had been cropped.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Hanson, is the colonel inside?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"They're waiting for you," he said.</p>

  <p>His voice was hard and unsympathetic, and his thin lips snapped out every
  syllable.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you coming in?" asked Pinto in surprise, his hand upon the
  door.</p>

  <p>The man called Hanson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've got to go to the colonel's flat," he said, "to get some papers.
  Besides, they don't want me."</p>

  <p>He smiled quickly and wanly. It was a grimace rather than an expression of
  amusement and Pinto eyed him narrowly. He had, however, the good sense to ask
  no further questions. Turning the handle of the door, he walked into the
  large, ornate apartment.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the room was a big table and the chairs at its sides
  were, for the most part, filled.</p>

  <p>He dropped into a seat on the colonel's right and nodded to the others at
  the table. Most of the principals were there&mdash;"Swell" Crewe, Jackson,
  Cresswell, and at the farther end of the table, Lollie Marsh with her baby
  face and her permanent expression of open-mouthed wonder.</p>

  <p>"Where's White?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The colonel was reading a letter and did not immediately reply. Presently
  he took off his pince-nez and put them into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Where's White?" he repeated. "White isn't here. No, White isn't here," he
  repeated significantly.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" asked Pinto quickly.</p>

  <p>The colonel scratched his chin and looked up to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I'm settling up this Spillsbury business," he said. "White isn't in
  it."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Pinto.</p>

  <p>"He never was in it," said the colonel evasively. "It was not the kind of
  business that White would like to be in. I guess he's getting religious or
  something, or maybe it's that daughter of his."</p>

  <p>The eyelids of Pinto Silva narrowed at the reference to Maisie White and
  he was on the point of remarking that he had just left her, but changed his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Does she know anything about&mdash;about her father?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The colonel smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why, no&mdash;unless you've told her."</p>

  <p>"I'm not on those terms," said Pinto savagely. "I'm getting tired of that
  girl's airs and graces, colonel, after what we've done for her!"</p>

  <p>"You'll get tireder, Pinto," said a voice from the end of the table and he
  turned round to meet the laughing eyes of Lollie Marsh.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I've been out taking a look at her to-day," she said, and the colonel
  scowled at her.</p>

  <p>"You were out taking a look at something else if I remember rightly," he
  said quietly. "I told you to get after Stafford King."</p>

  <p>"And I got after him," she said, "and after the girl too."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"That's a bit of news for you, isn't it?" She was delighted to drop the
  bombshell: "you can't shadow Stafford King without crossing the tracks of
  Maisie White."</p>

  <p>The colonel uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know they were acquainted? Didn't you know that Stafford King
  goes down to Horsham to see her, and takes her to dinner twice a week?"</p>

  <p>They looked at one another in consternation. Maisie White was the daughter
  of a man who, next to the colonel, had been the most daring member of the
  gang, who had organised more coups than any other man, save its leader. The
  news that the daughter of Solomon White was meeting the Chief of the Criminal
  Intelligence Department, was incredible and stunning.</p>

  <p>"So that's it, is it?" said the colonel, licking his dry lips. "That's why
  Solomon White's fed up with the life and wants to break away."</p>

  <p>He turned to Pinto Silva, whose face was set and hard.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were keen on that girl, Pinto," he said coarsely. "We left
  the way open to you. What do you know about it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the man shortly. "I don't believe it."</p>

  <p>"Don't believe it," broke in the girl. "Listen! There was a matinee at the
  Orpheum to-day and King went there. I followed him in and got a seat next to
  him and tried to get friendly. But he had only eyes for the girl on the
  stage, and I might as well have been the paper on the wall for all the notice
  he took of me. After her turn, he went out and waited for her at the stage
  door. They went to Roymoyers for tea. I went back to the theatre and saw her
  dresser. She is the woman I recommended when Pinto put her on the stage."</p>

  <p>"What sort of work is Maisie doing?" asked the saturnine Crewe.</p>

  <p>"Male impersonations," said the girl. "Say! she looks dandy in a man's
  kit! She's the best male impersonator I've ever seen. Why, when she
  talks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that," interrupted the colonel, "what did you
  discover?"</p>

  <p>"I discovered that Stafford King comes regularly to the theatre, that he
  takes her to dinner and that he visits the house at Horsham."</p>

  <p>"Solly never told me that&mdash;the swine!" rapped the colonel, "he's
  going to double-cross us, that fellow."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it."</p>

  <p>It was Crewe that spoke. "Swell" Crewe, whose boast it was that he had a
  suit for every day in the year.</p>

  <p>"I know Solomon and I've known him for years," he said. "I know him as
  well as you, colonel. As far as we are concerned, Solly is straight. I'm not
  denying the possibility that he wants to break away, but that's only natural.
  He's a man with a daughter, and he's made his pile, but I'll stake my life
  that he'll never double-cross us."</p>

  <p>"Double-cross us?" the colonel had recovered his wonted equanimity. "What
  has he to 'double-cross'?" he demanded almost jovially. "We have a
  straightforward business! I am not aware that any of us are guilty of
  dishonest actions. Double-cross! Bah!"</p>

  <p>He brought his big hand down with a thump on the table, and they knew from
  experience that this was the gavel of the chairman that ended all
  discussions.</p>

  <p>"Now, gentlemen," said the colonel, "let us get to business. Ask Hanson to
  come in&mdash;he's got the figures. It is the last lot of figures of ours
  that he'll ever handle," he added.</p>

  <p>Somebody went to the door of the ante-room and called the secretary, but
  there was no reply.</p>

  <p>"He's gone out."</p>

  <p>"Gone out?" said the colonel and bent his brows. "Who told him to go out?
  Never mind, he'll be back in a minute. Shut the door."</p>

  <p>He lifted a deed-box from the floor at his feet, placed it on the table,
  opened it with a key attached to his watch-chain and removed a bundle of
  documents.</p>

  <p>"We're going to settle the Spillsbury business to-night," he said.
  "Spillsbury looks like squealing."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked Pinto.</p>

  <p>"In an inebriates' home," said the colonel grimly; "it seems there are
  some trustees to his father's estate who are likely to question the legality
  of the transfers. But I've had the best legal opinion in London and there is
  no doubt that our position is safe. The only thing we've got to do to-night
  is to make absolutely sure that all those fool letters he wrote to Lollie
  have been destroyed."</p>

  <p>"You've got them?" said the girl quickly.</p>

  <p>"I had them?" said the colonel, "and I burnt them all except one when the
  transfer was completed. And the question is, gentlemen," he said, "shall we
  burn the last?"</p>

  <p>He took from the bundle before him an envelope and held it up.</p>

  <p>"I kept this in case there was anything coming, but if he's in a booze
  home, why, he's not going to be influenced by the threat of publishing a
  slushy letter to a girl. I guess his trustees are not going to be very much
  influenced either. On the other hand, if this letter were found among
  business documents, it would look pretty bad for us."</p>

  <p>"Found by whom?" asked Pinto.</p>

  <p>"By the police," said the colonel calmly.</p>

  <p>"Police?"</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"They're getting after us, but you needn't be alarmed," he said. "King is
  working to get a case, and he is not above applying for a search warrant. But
  I'm not scared of the police so much." His voice slowed and he spoke with
  greater emphasis. "I guess there are enough court cards in the Boundary pack
  to beat that combination. It's the Jack&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>The Jack&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</i>"</p>

  <p>It was a shrill bubble of laughter which cut into his speech and the
  colonel leapt to his feet, his hand dropping to his hip-pocket. The door had
  opened and closed so silently that none had heard it, and a figure stood
  confronting them.</p>

  <p>It was clad from head to foot in a long coat of black silk, which
  shimmered in the half-light of the electrolier. The hands were gloved, the
  head covered with a soft slouch hat and the face hidden behind a white silk
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>The colonel's hand was in his hip-pocket when he thought better and raised
  both hands in the air. There was something peculiarly businesslike in the
  long-barrelled revolver which the intruder held, in spite of the
  silver-plating and the gold inlay along the chased barrel.</p>

  <p>"Everybody's hands in the air," said the Jack shrilly, "right up to the
  beautiful sky! Yours too, Lollie. Stand away from the table, everybody, and
  back to the wall. For the Jack o' Judgment is amongst you and life is full of
  amazing possibilities!"</p>

  <p>They backed from the table, peering helplessly at the two unwinking eyes
  which showed through the holes in the handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Back to the wall, my pretties," chuckled the Thing. "I'm going to make
  you laugh and you'll want some support. I'm going to make you rock with joy
  and merriment!"</p>

  <p>The figure had moved to the table, and all the time it spoke its nimble
  fingers were turning over the piles of documents which the colonel had
  disgorged from the dispatch box.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you a comical tale about a gang of blackmailers."</p>

  <p>"You're a liar," said the colonel hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"About a gang of blackmailers," said the Jack with shrill laughter,
  "fellows who didn't work like common blackmailers, nor demand money. Oh, no!
  not naughty blackmailers! They got the fools and the vicious in their power
  and made them sell things for hundreds of pounds that were worth thousands.
  And they were such a wonderful crowd! They were such wonderfully amusing
  fellows. There was Dan Boundary who started life by robbing his dead mother,
  there was 'Swell' Crewe, who was once a gentleman and is now a thief!"</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" said Crewe, lurching forward, but the gun swung round on him
  and he stopped.</p>

  <p>"There was Lollie who would sell her own child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have no child," half-screamed the girl.</p>

  <p>"Think again, Lollie darling&mdash;dear little soul!"</p>

  <p>He stopped. The envelope that his fingers had been seeking was found. He
  slipped it beneath the black silk cloak and in two bounds was at the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Send for the police," he mocked. "Send for the police, Dan! Get Stafford
  King, the eminent chief. Tell him I called! My card!"</p>

  <p>With a dexterous flip of his fingers he sent a little pasteboard planing
  across the room. In an instant the door opened and closed upon the intruder
  and he was gone.</p>

  <p>For a second there was silence, and then, with a little sob, Lollie Marsh
  collapsed in a heap on the floor. Colonel Dan Boundary looked from one white
  face to the other.</p>

  <p>"There's a hundred thousand pounds for any one of you who gets that
  fellow," he said, breathing hard, "whether it is man or woman."</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">III. THE DECOY</a></h2>

  <p>Colonel Boundary, sitting at his desk the morning after, pushed a bell. It
  was answered by the thick-set Olaf. He was dressed, as usual, in black from
  head to foot and the colonel eyed him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Hanson," he said, "has Miss Marsh come?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she has come," said the other resentfully.</p>

  <p>"Tell her I want her," said the colonel and then as the man was leaving
  the room: "Where did you get to last night when I wanted you?"</p>

  <p>"I was out," said the man shortly. "I get some time for myself, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Sure you do, Hanson."</p>

  <p>His tone was mild, and that spelt danger to Hanson, had he known it. This
  was the third sign of rebellion which the man had shown in the past week.</p>

  <p>"What's happened to your temper this morning, Hanson?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Everything," exploded the man and in his agitation his foreign origin was
  betrayed by his accent. "You tell me I shall haf plenty money, thousands of
  pounds! You say I go to my brother in America. Where is dot money? I go in
  March, I go in May, I go in July, still I am here!"</p>

  <p>"My good friend," said the colonel, "you're too impatient. This is not a
  moment I can allow you to go away. You're getting nervous, that's what's the
  matter with you. Perhaps I'll let you have a holiday next week."</p>

  <p>"Nervous!" roared the man. "Yes, I am. All the time I feel eyes on me!
  When I walk in the street, every man I meet is a policeman. When I go to bed,
  I hear nothing but footsteps creeping in the passage outside my room."</p>

  <p>"Old Jack, eh?" said the colonel, eyeing him narrowly.</p>

  <p>Hanson shivered.</p>

  <p>He had seen the Jack o' Judgment once. A figure in gossamer silk who had
  stood beside the bed in which the Scandinavian lay and had talked wisdom
  whilst Olaf quaked in a muck sweat of fear.</p>

  <p>The colonel did not know this. He was under the impression that the
  appearance of the previous night had constituted the first of this mysterious
  menace.</p>

  <p>So he nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Send Miss Marsh to me," he said.</p>

  <p>Hanson would have got on his nerves if he had nerves. The man, at any
  rate, was becoming an intolerable nuisance. The colonel marked him down as
  one of the problems calling for early solution.</p>

  <p>The secretary had not been gone more than a few seconds before the door
  opened again and the girl came in. She was tall, pretty in a doll- like way,
  with an aura of golden hair about her small head. She might have been more
  than pretty but for her eyes, which were too light a shade of blue to be
  beautiful. She was expensively gowned and walked with the easy swing of one
  whose position was assured.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Lollie," said the colonel. "Did you see him again?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I got a pretty good view of him," she said.</p>

  <p>"Did he see you?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," she said; "besides, what does it matter if he
  did?"</p>

  <p>"Was the girl with him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked the colonel after a pause. "Can you do anything with
  him?"</p>

  <p>She pursed her lips.</p>

  <p>If she had expected the colonel to refer to their terrifying experience of
  the night before, she was to be disappointed. The hard eyes of the man
  compelled her to keep to the matter under discussion.</p>

  <p>"He looks pretty hard," said the girl. "He is not the man to fall for that
  heart-to-heart stuff."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Just that," said the girl with a shrug. "I can't imagine his picking me
  up and taking me to dinner and pouring out the secrets of his young heart at
  the second bottle."</p>

  <p>"Neither can I," said the colonel thoughtfully. "You're a pretty clever
  girl, Lollie, and I'm going to make it worth your while to get close to that
  fellow. He's the one man in Scotland Yard that we want to put out of
  business. Not that we've anything to be afraid of," he added vaguely, "but
  he's just interfering with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused for a word.</p>

  <p>"With business," said the girl. "Oh, come off it, colonel! Just tell me
  how far you want me to go."</p>

  <p>"You've got to go to the limit," said the other decidedly. "You've got to
  put him as wrong as you can. He must be compromised up to his neck."</p>

  <p>"What about my young reputation?" asked the girl with a grimace.</p>

  <p>"If you lose it, we'll buy you another," said the colonel drily, "and I
  reckon it's about time you had another one, Lollie."</p>

  <p>The girl fingered her chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It is not going to be easy," she said again. "It isn't going to be like
  young Spillsbury&mdash;Pinto Silva could have done that job without
  help&mdash;or Solomon White even."</p>

  <p>"You can shut up about Spillsbury," growled the colonel. "I've told you to
  forget everything that has ever happened in our business! And I've told you a
  hundred times not to mention Pinto or any of the other men in this business!
  You can do as you're told! And take that look off your face!"</p>

  <p>He rose with extraordinary agility and leant over, glowering at the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"You've been getting a bit too fresh lately, Lollie, and giving yourself
  airs! You don't try any of that grand lady stuff with me, d'ye hear?"</p>

  <p>There was nothing suave in the colonel's manner, nothing slow or ponderous
  or courtly. He spoke rapidly and harshly and revealed the brute that many
  suspected but few knew.</p>

  <p>"I've no more respect for women than I have for men, understand! If you
  ever get gay with me, I'll take your neck in my hand like that," he clenched
  his two fists together with a horribly suggestive motion and the frightened
  girl watched him, fascinated. "I'll break you as if you were a bit of china!
  I'll tear you as if you were a rag! You needn't think you'll ever get away
  from me&mdash;I'll follow you to the ends of the earth. You're paid like a
  queen and treated like a queen and you play straight &mdash;there was a man
  called 'Snow' Gregory once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The trembling girl was on her feet now, her face ashen white.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, colonel," she faltered. "I didn't intend giving you offence.
  I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was on the verge of tears when the colonel, with a quick gesture,
  motioned her back to the chair. His rage subsided as suddenly as it had
  risen.</p>

  <p>"Now do as you're told, Lollie," he said calmly. "Get after that young
  fellow and don't come back to me until you've got him."</p>

  <p>She nodded, not trusting herself to speak, and almost tiptoed from his
  dread presence.</p>

  <p>At the door he stopped her.</p>

  <p>"As to Maisie," he said, "why, you can leave Maisie to me."</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV. THE MISSING HANSON</a></h2>

  <p>Colonel Dan Boundary descended slowly from the Ford taxi-cab which had
  brought him up from Horsham station and surveyed without emotion the domicile
  of his partner. It was Colonel Boundary's boast that he was in the act of
  lathering his face on the tenth floor of a Californian hotel when the
  earthquake began, and that he finished his shaving operations, took his bath
  and dressed himself before the earth had ceased to tremble.</p>

  <p>"I shall want you again, so you had better wait," he said to the driver
  and passed through the wooden gates toward Rose Lodge.</p>

  <p>He stopped half-way up the path, having now a better view of the house. It
  was a red brick villa, the home of a well-to-do man. The trim lawn with its
  border of rose trees, the little fountain playing over the rockery, the
  quality of the garden furniture within view and the general air of comfort
  which pervaded the place, suggested the home of a prosperous City man, one of
  those happy creatures who have never troubled to get themselves in line for
  millions, but have lived happily between the four and five figure mark.</p>

  <p>Colonel Boundary grunted and continued his walk. A trim maid opened the
  door to him and by her blank look it was evident that he was not a frequent
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"Boundary&mdash;just say Boundary," said the colonel in a deep voice which
  carried to the remotest part of the house.</p>

  <p>He was shown to the drawing-room and again found much that interested him.
  He felt no twinge of pity at the thought that Solomon White would very soon
  exchange this almost luxury for the bleak discomfort of a prison cell, and
  not even the sight of the girl who came through the door to greet him brought
  him a qualm.</p>

  <p>"You want to see my father, colonel?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Her tone was cold but polite. The colonel had never been a great favourite
  of Maisie White's, and now it required a considerable effort on her part to
  hide her deep aversion.</p>

  <p>"Do I want to see your father?" said Colonel Boundary. "Why, yes, I think
  I do and I want to see you too, and I'd just as soon see you first, before I
  speak to Solly."</p>

  <p>She sat down, a model of patient politeness, her hands folded on her lap.
  In the light of day she was pretty, straight of back, graceful as to figure
  and the clear grey eyes which met his faded blue, were very
  understanding.</p>

  <p>"Miss White," he said, "we have been very good to you."</p>

  <p>"We?" repeated the girl.</p>

  <p>"We," nodded the colonel. "I speak for myself and my business associates.
  If Solomon had ever told you the truth you would know that you owe all your
  education, your beautiful home," he waved his hand, "to myself and my
  business associates." His tongue rolled round the last two words. They were
  favourites of his.</p>

  <p>She nodded her head slightly.</p>

  <p>"I was under the impression that I owed it to my father," she said, with a
  hint of irony in her voice, "for I suppose that he earned all he has."</p>

  <p>"You suppose that he earned all that he has?" repeated the colonel. "Well,
  very likely you are right. He has earned more than he has got but pay-day is
  near at hand."</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the menace in his tone, but the girl made no
  comment. She knew that there had been trouble. She knew that her father had
  for days been locked in his study and had scarcely spoken a word to
  anybody.</p>

  <p>"I saw you the other night," said the colonel, changing the direction of
  his attack. "I saw you at the Orpheum. Pinto Silva came with me. We were in
  the stage box."</p>

  <p>"I saw you," said the girl quietly.</p>

  <p>"A very good performance, considering you're a kid," said Boundary; "in
  fact, Pinto says you're the best mimic he has ever seen on the stage&mdash;"
  He paused&mdash;"Pinto got you your contracts."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am very grateful to Mr. Silva," she said.</p>

  <p>"You have all the world before you, my girl," said Boundary in his slow,
  ponderous way, "a beautiful and bright future, plenty of money, pearls,
  diamonds," he waved his hand with a vague gesture, "and Pinto, who is the
  most valuable of my business associates, is very fond of you."</p>

  <p>The girl sighed helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I thought that matter had been finished and done with, colonel," she
  said. "I don't know how people in your world would regard such an offer, but
  in my world they would look upon it as an insult."</p>

  <p>"And what the devil is your world?" asked the colonel, without any sign of
  irritation.</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"The clean, decent world," she said calmly, "the law-abiding world. The
  world that regards such arrangements as you suggest as infamous. It is not
  only the fact that Mr. Silva is already married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The colonel raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"Pinto talks very seriously of getting a divorce," he said solemnly, "and
  when a gentleman like Pinto Silva gives his word, that ought to be sufficient
  for any girl. And now you have come to mention law-abiding worlds," he went
  on slowly, "I would like to speak of one of the law- abiders."</p>

  <p>She knew what was coming and was silent.</p>

  <p>"There's a young gentleman named Stafford King hanging round you." He saw
  her face flush but went on, "Mr. Stafford King is a policeman."</p>

  <p>"He is an official of the Criminal Intelligence Department," said the
  girl, "but I don't think you would call him a policeman, would you,
  colonel?"</p>

  <p>"All policemen are policemen to me," said Boundary, "and Mr. Stafford King
  is one of the worst of the policemen from my point of view, because he's
  trying to trump up a cock-and-bull story about me and get me into very
  serious trouble."</p>

  <p>"I know Mr. King is connected with a great number of unpleasant cases,"
  said the girl coolly. "It would be a coincidence if he was in a case which
  interested you."</p>

  <p>"It would be a coincidence, would it?" said the colonel, nodding his huge
  head. "Perhaps it is a coincidence that my clerk, Hanson, has disappeared and
  has been seen in the company of your friend, eh? It is a coincidence that
  King is working on the Spillsbury case&mdash;the one case that Solly knows
  nothing about&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>She faced him, puzzled and apprehensive.</p>

  <p>"Where does all this lead?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It leads to trouble for Solly, that's all," said the colonel. "He's
  trying to put me away and put his business associates away, and he has got to
  go through the mill unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Pinto's a merciful man, I'm a merciful man. We don't want to make trouble
  with former business associates, but trouble there is going to be, believe
  me."</p>

  <p>"What kind of trouble?" asked the girl. "If you mean that your so- called
  business association with my father will cease, I shall be happier. My father
  can earn his living and I have my stage work."</p>

  <p>"You have your stage work," the colonel did not smile but his tone
  betrayed his amusement, "and your father can earn his living, eh? He can earn
  his living in Portland Gaol," he said, raising his voice.</p>

  <p>"For the matter of that, so can you, colonel."</p>

  <p>The colonel turned his head slowly and surveyed the spare figure in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you heard me, did you, Solly," he said not unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I heard you," said Solomon White, his lean face a shade whiter than the
  girl had ever seen it and his breathing was a little laboured.</p>

  <p>"If you are thinking of gaoling me," said White, "why, I think we shall
  make up a pretty jolly party."</p>

  <p>"Meaning me?" said the colonel, raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"You amongst others. Pinto Silva, 'Swell' Crewe and Selby, to name a
  few."</p>

  <p>Colonel Boundary permitted himself to chuckle.</p>

  <p>"On what charge?" he asked, "tell me that, Solly? The cleverest men in
  Scotland Yard have been laying for me for years and they haven't got away
  with it. Maybe they have your assistance and that dog Hanson&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," interrupted White, "so far as I am concerned&mdash;I know
  nothing about Hanson."</p>

  <p>"Hanson," said the colonel slowly, "is a thief. He bolted with L300 of
  mine, as I've reported to the police."</p>

  <p>"I see," said White with a little smile of contempt, "got your charge in
  first, eh, colonel&mdash;discredit the witness. And what have you framed for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the colonel, "except this. I've just had from the bank a
  cheque for L4,000 drawn in your favour on our joint account and purporting to
  be signed by Silva and myself."</p>

  <p>"As it happens," said White, "it was signed by you fellows in my
  presence."</p>

  <p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Obdurate to the last, brazening it out to the end&mdash;why not make a
  frank confession to an old business associate, Solly? I came here to see you
  about that cheque."</p>

  <p>"That's the game, is it?" said White. "You are going to charge me with
  forgery, and suppose I spill it?"</p>

  <p>"Spill what?" asked the colonel innocently. "If by 'spill' you mean make a
  statement to the police derogatory to myself and my business associates, what
  can you tell? I can bring a dozen witnesses to prove that both Pinto and I
  were in Brighton the morning that cheque was signed."</p>

  <p>"You came up by car at night," said White harshly. "We arranged to meet
  outside Guildford to split the loot."</p>

  <p>"Loot?" said Colonel Boundary, puzzled. "I don't understand you."</p>

  <p>"I'll put it plainer," said White, his eyes like smouldering fire: "a year
  ago you got young Balston the shipowner to put fifty thousand pounds into a
  fake company."</p>

  <p>He heard Maisie gasp, but went on.</p>

  <p>"How you did it I'm not going to tell before the girl, but it was
  blackmail which you and Pinto engineered. He paid his last instalment
  &mdash;the four thousand pounds was my share."</p>

  <p>Colonel Boundary rose and looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I have a taxi-cab waiting, and with a taxi-cab time is money. If you are
  going to bring in the name of an innocent young man, who will certainly deny
  that he had any connection with myself and my business associates, that is a
  matter for your own conscience. I tell you I know nothing about this cheque.
  I have made your daughter an offer."</p>

  <p>"I can guess what it is," interrupted White, "and I can tell you this,
  Boundary, that if you are going to sell me, I'll be even with you, if I wait
  twenty years! If you imagine I am going to let my daughter into that filthy
  gang&mdash;" His voice broke, and it was some time before he could recover
  himself. "Do your worst. But I'll have you, Boundary! I don't doubt that
  you'll get a conviction, and you know the things that I can't talk about, and
  I'll have to take my medicine, but you are not going to escape."</p>

  <p>"Wait, colonel." It was the girl who spoke in so low a voice that he would
  not have heard her, but that he was expecting her to speak. "Do you mean that
  you will&mdash;prosecute my father?"</p>

  <p>"With law-abiding people," said the colonel profoundly, "the demands of
  justice come first. I must do my duty to the state, but if you should change
  your mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She won't change her mind," roared White.</p>

  <p>With one stride he had passed between the colonel and the door. Only for a
  second he stood, and then he fell back.</p>

  <p>"Do your worst," he said huskily, and Colonel Boundary passed out,
  pocketing the revolver which had come from nowhere into his hand, and
  presently they heard the purr of the departing motor.</p>

  <p>He came to Horsham station in a thoughtful frame of mind. He was still
  thinking profoundly when he reached Victoria.</p>

  <p>Then, as he stepped on the platform, a hand was laid on his arm, and he
  turned to meet the smiling face of Stafford King.</p>

  <p>"Hullo," said the colonel, and something within him went cold.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to break in on your reverie, colonel," said Stafford King, "but
  I've a warrant for your arrest."</p>

  <p>"What is the charge?" asked the colonel, his face grey.</p>

  <p>"Blackmail and conspiracy," said King, and saw with amazement the look of
  relief in the other's eyes.</p>

  <p>Then:</p>

  <p>"Boundary," he said between his teeth, "you thought I wanted you for
  'Snow' Gregory!"</p>

  <p>The colonel said nothing.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. IN THE MAGISTRATE'S COURT</a></h2>

  <p>Never before in history had the dingy little street, in which North
  Lambeth Police Court stands, witnessed such scenes as were presented on that
  memorable 4th of December, when counsel for the Crown opened the case against
  Colonel Dan Boundary.</p>

  <p>Long before the building was open the precincts of the court were besieged
  by people anxious to secure one of the very few seats which were available
  for the public. By nine o'clock it became necessary to summon a special force
  of police to clear a way for the numerous motor-cars which came bowling from
  every point of the compass and which were afterwards parked in the narrow
  side streets, to the intense amazement and interest of the curious denizens
  of the unsavoury neighbourhood in which the court is located.</p>

  <p>Admission was by ticket. Even the reporters, those favoured servants of
  democracy, had need to produce a printed pass before the scrutinising
  policeman at the door allowed them to enter. Every available seat had been
  allotted. Even the magistrate's sacristy had been invaded, and chairs stood
  three-deep to left and right of him.</p>

  <p>There were some who came out of sheer morbid curiosity, in order that they
  might boast that they were present when this remarkable case was heard. There
  were others who came, inwardly quaking at the revelations which were promised
  or hinted at in the daily Press, for the influence which the Boundary gang
  exercised was wide and far-reaching.</p>

  <p>A young man stood upon the congested pavement, watching with evident
  impatience the arrival of belated cars. The magistrate had already come and
  had disappeared behind the slate-coloured gates which led to the courtyard.
  Stafford saw fashionably-dressed women and (with a smile) worried-looking men
  who were figures in the political and social world, and presently he
  involuntarily stepped forward into the roadway as though to meet the electric
  limousine which came noiselessly to the main entrance.</p>

  <p>The solitary occupant of the car was a man of sixty&mdash;a grey- haired
  gentleman of medium height, dressed with scrupulous care, and wearing on his
  clean-shaven face a perpetual smile, as though life were an amusement which
  never palled.</p>

  <p>Stafford King took the extended hand with a little twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid we shouldn't be able to keep your place for you, Sir
  Stanley," he said.</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley Belcom, First Commissioner of Criminal Intelligence,
  accentuated his smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, Stafford," he drawled, "I've come to see the culminating triumph of
  your official career."</p>

  <p>Stafford King made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," he said dryly.</p>

  <p>"I hope so, too," said the baronet, "yet&mdash;I'll tell you frankly,
  Stafford, I have a feeling that the ordinary processes of the law are
  inadequate to trap this organisation. The law has too wide a mesh to deal
  with the terror which this man exercises. Such men are the only justification
  of lynch law, the quick, sharp justice which is administered without subtlety
  and without quibble."</p>

  <p>Stafford looked at the other and made no attempt to hide his
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You believe in&mdash;the Jack o' Judgment?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley shot a swift glance at him.</p>

  <p>"That is the bugbear of the gang, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"So Hanson says," replied the other. "I verily believe that Hanson is more
  afraid of that mysterious person than he is of Boundary himself."</p>

  <p>The Attorney-General had begun his opening speech when the two men made
  their way into the crowded court and found their seats at the end of the
  solicitors table.</p>

  <p>In the dock sat Colonel Boundary, the least concerned of all that
  assembly. The colonel was leaning forward, his arms resting on the rails, his
  chin on the back of his hairy hand, his eyes glued upon the grey- haired
  lawyer who was dispassionately opening the case.</p>

  <p>"The contention of the Crown," the Attorney-General was saying, "is that
  Colonel Boundary is at the head of a huge blackmailing organisation, and that
  in the course of the past twenty years, by such means as I shall suggest and
  as the principal witness for the Crown will tell you, he has built up his
  criminal practice until he now controls the most complex and the most
  iniquitous organisation that has been known in the long and sordid history of
  crime.</p>

  <p>"Your Worship will doubtless hear," he went on, "of a bizarre and
  fantastic figure which flits through the pages of this story, a mysterious
  somebody who is called the 'Jack.' But I shall ask your Worship, as I shall
  ask the jury, when this case reaches, as it must reach ultimately, the
  Central Criminal Court, to disregard this apparition, which displayed no part
  in bringing Boundary to justice.</p>

  <p>"The contention of the Crown is, as I say, that Boundary, by means of
  terrorisation and blackmail, through the medium and assistance of his
  creatures, has from time to time secured a hold over rich and foolish men and
  women, and from these has acquired the enormous wealth which is now his and
  his associates'. As to these latter, their prosecution depends very largely
  upon the fate of Boundary. There are, I believe, some of them in court at
  this moment, and though they are not arrested, it will be no news to them to
  learn that they are under police observation."</p>

  <p>"Swell" Crewe, sitting at the back of the court, shifted uneasily and,
  turning his head, he met the careless gaze of the tall, military- looking man
  who had "detective" written all over him.</p>

  <p>There had been a pause in the Attorney-General's speech whilst he
  examined, short-sightedly, the notes before him.</p>

  <p>"In the presentation of this case, your Worship," he went on, "the Crown
  is in somewhat of a dilemma. We have secured one important and, I think,
  convincing witness&mdash;a man who has been closely associated with the
  prisoner, a Scandinavian named Hanson, who, considering himself badly treated
  by this gang, has been for a long time secretly getting together evidence of
  an incriminating character. As to his object we need not inquire. There is a
  possibility suggested by my learned friend, the counsel for the defence, that
  Hanson intended blackmailing the blackmailers, and presenting such a weight
  of evidence against Boundary that he could do no less than pay handsomely for
  his confederate's silence. That is as may be. The main fact is that Hanson
  has accumulated this documentary evidence, and that that documentary evidence
  is in existence in certain secret hiding-places in this country, which will
  be revealed in the course of his examination.</p>

  <p>"We are at this disadvantage, that Hanson has not yet made anything but
  the most scanty of statements. Fearing for his life, since this gang will
  stick at nothing, he has been closely guarded by the police from the moment
  he made his preliminary statement. Every effort which has been made to induce
  him to commit his revelations to writing has been in vain, and we are
  compelled to take what is practically his affidavit in open court."</p>

  <p>"Do I understand," interrupted the magistrate, in that weary tone which is
  the prerogative of magistrates, "that you are not as yet in possession of the
  evidence on which I am to be asked to commit the prisoner to the Old
  Bailey?"</p>

  <p>"That is so, your Worship," said the counsel. "All we could procure from
  Hanson was the bald affidavit which was necessary to secure the man's
  arrest."</p>

  <p>"So that if anything happened to your witness, there would be no case for
  the Crown?"</p>

  <p>The Attorney-General nodded.</p>

  <p>"Those are exactly the circumstances, your Worship," he said, "and that is
  why we have been careful to keep our witness in security. The man is in a
  highly nervous condition, and we have been obliged to humour him. But I do
  not think your Worship need have any apprehension as to the evidence which
  will be produced to-day, or that there will not be sufficient to justify a
  committal."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the magistrate.</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley turned to Stafford and whispered:</p>

  <p>"Rather a queer proceeding."</p>

  <p>Stafford nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is the only thing we could do," he said. "Hanson refused to speak
  until he was in court&mdash;until, as he said, he saw Boundary under
  arrest."</p>

  <p>"Does Boundary know this?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," replied Stafford with a little smile, "he knows
  everything. He has a whole army of spies. Sir Stanley, you don't know how big
  this organisation is. He has roped in everybody. He has Members of
  Parliament, he has the best lawyers in London, and two of the big detective
  agencies are engaged exclusively on his work."</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley pursed his lips thoughtfully and turned his attention to the
  prosecuting counsel. The address was not a long one, and presently the
  Attorney-General sat down, to be followed by a leading member of the Bar,
  retained for the defence. Presently he too had finished, and again the
  Attorney-General rose.</p>

  <p>"Call Olaf Hanson," he said, and there was a stir of excitement.</p>

  <p>The door leading to the cells opened, and two tall detectives came
  through, and two others followed. In the midst of the four walked the short,
  grey-faced man, in whose hands was the fate, and indeed the life, of Colonel
  Dan Boundary.</p>

  <p>He did not as much as glance at the dock, but hurried across the floor of
  the court and was ushered to the witness stand, his four guardians disposing
  themselves behind and before him. The man seemed on the point of crumbling.
  His fear-full eyes ranged the court, always avoiding the gross figure in the
  railed dock. The lips of the witness were white and trembling. The hands
  which clutched the front of the box for support twitched spasmodically.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Olaf Hanson?" asked the Attorney-General soothingly.</p>

  <p>The witness tried to speak but his lips emitted no sound. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You are a native of Christiania?"</p>

  <p>Again Hanson nodded.</p>

  <p>"You must speak out," said Counsel kindly, "and you need have no fear. How
  long have you known Colonel Boundary?"</p>

  <p>This time Hanson found his voice.</p>

  <p>"For ten years," he said huskily.</p>

  <p>An usher came forward from the press at the back of the court with a glass
  of water and handed it to the witness, who drank eagerly. Counsel waited
  until he had drained the glass before he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"You have in your possession certain documentary evidence convicting
  Colonel Boundary of certain malpractices?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the witness.</p>

  <p>"You have promised the police that you will reveal in court where those
  documents have been stored?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hanson again.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell the court now, in order that the police may lose as little
  time as possible, where you have hidden that evidence?"</p>

  <p>Colonel Boundary was showing the first signs of interest he had evinced in
  the proceedings. He leaned forward, his head craned round as though
  endeavouring to catch the eye of the witness.</p>

  <p>Hanson was speaking, and speaking with difficulty.</p>

  <p>"I haf&mdash;put those papers,"&mdash;he stopped and swayed &mdash;"I haf
  put those papers&mdash;" he began again, and then, without a second's
  warning, he fell limply forward.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he has fainted," said the magistrate.</p>

  <p>Detectives were crowding round the witness, and had lifted him from the
  witness stand. One said something hurriedly, and Stafford King left his seat.
  He was bending over the prostrate figure, tearing open the collar from his
  throat, and presently was joined by the police surgeon, who was in court.
  There was a little whispered consultation, and then Stafford King
  straightened himself up and his face was pale and hard.</p>

  <p>"I regret to inform your Worship," he said, "that the witness is
  dead."</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. STAFFORD KING RESIGNS</a></h2>

  <p>A week later, Stafford King came into the office of the First Commissioner
  of the Criminal Intelligence Department, and Sir Stanley looked up with a
  kindly but pitying look in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Well, Stafford," he said gently, "sit down, won't you. What has
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Stafford King shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Boundary is discharged," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was inevitable," he said, "I suppose there's no hope of connecting him
  and his gang with the death of Hanson?"</p>

  <p>"Not a ghost of a hope, I am afraid," said Stafford, shaking his head.
  "Hanson was undoubtedly murdered, and the poison which killed him was in the
  glass of water which the usher brought. I've been examining the usher again
  to-day, and all he can remember is that he saw somebody pushing through the
  crowd at the back of the court, who handed the glass over the heads of the
  people. Nobody seems to have seen the man who passed it. That was the method
  by which the gang got rid of their traitor."</p>

  <p>"Clever," said Sir Stanley, putting his finger-tips together. "They knew
  just the condition of mind in which Hanson would be when he came into court.
  They had the dope ready, and they knew that the detectives would allow the
  usher to bring the man water, when they would not allow anybody else to
  approach him. This is a pretty bad business, Stafford."</p>

  <p>"I realise that," said the young chief. "Of course, I shall resign.
  There's nothing else to do. I thought we had him this time, especially with
  the evidence we had in relation to the Spillsbury case."</p>

  <p>"You mean the letter which Spillsbury wrote to the woman Marsh? How did
  that come, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"It reached Scotland Yard by post."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who sent it?"</p>

  <p>"There was no covering note at all," replied Stafford. "It was in a plain
  envelope with a typewritten address and was sent to me personally. The
  letter, of course, was valueless by itself."</p>

  <p>"Have you made any search to discover the documents which Hanson spoke
  about?"</p>

  <p>"We have searched everywhere," said the other a little wearily, "but it is
  a pretty hopeless business looking through London for a handful of documents.
  Anyway, friend Boundary is free."</p>

  <p>The other was watching him closely.</p>

  <p>"It is a bitter disappointment to you, my young friend," he said; "you've
  been working on the case for years. I fear you'll never have another such
  chance of putting Boundary in the dock. He's got a lot of public sympathy,
  too. Your thorough-paced rascal who escapes from the hands of the police has
  always a large following amongst the public, and I doubt whether the Home
  Secretary will sanction any further proceedings, unless we have most
  convincing proof. What's this?"</p>

  <p>Stafford had laid a letter on the table.</p>

  <p>"My resignation," said that young man grimly.</p>

  <p>The First Commissioner took up the envelope and tore it in four
  pieces.</p>

  <p>"It is not accepted," he said cheerfully; "you did your best, and you're
  no more responsible than I am. If you resign, I ought to resign, and so ought
  every officer who has been on this game. A few years ago I took exactly the
  same step&mdash;offered my resignation over a purely private and personal
  matter, and it was not accepted. I have been glad since, and so will you be.
  Go on with your work and give Boundary a rest for awhile."</p>

  <p>Stafford was looking down at him abstractedly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think we shall ever catch the fellow, sir?"</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley smiled.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I don't," he admitted. "As I said before, the only danger I see
  to Boundary is this mysterious individual who apparently crops up now and
  again in his daily life, and who, I suspect, was the person who sent you the
  Spillsbury letter&mdash;the Jack o' Judgment, doesn't he call himself? Do you
  know what I think?" he asked quietly. "I think that if you found the 'Jack,'
  if you ran him to earth, stripped him of his mystic guise, you would discover
  somebody who has a greater grudge against Boundary than the police."</p>

  <p>Stafford smiled.</p>

  <p>"We can't run about after phantoms, sir," he said, with a touch of
  asperity in his voice.</p>

  <p>The chief looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"I hear you do quite a lot of running about," he said carelessly, as he
  began to arrange the papers on his table. "By the way, how is Miss
  White?"</p>

  <p>Stafford flushed.</p>

  <p>"She was very well when I saw her last night," he said stiffly; "she is
  leaving the stage."</p>

  <p>"And her father?"</p>

  <p>Stafford was silent for a second.</p>

  <p>"He left his home a week before the case came into court and has not been
  seen since," he said.</p>

  <p>The chief nodded.</p>

  <p>"Whilst White is away and until he turns up I should keep a watchful eye
  on his daughter," he said.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, sir?" asked Stafford.</p>

  <p>"I'm just making a suggestion," said the other. "Think it over."</p>

  <p>Stafford thought it over on his way to meet the girl, who was waiting for
  him on a sunny seat in Temple Gardens, for the day was fine and even warm,
  and, two hours before luncheon, the place was comparatively empty of
  people.</p>

  <p>She saw the trouble in his face and rose to meet him, and for a moment
  forgot her own distress of mind, her doubts and fears. Evidently she knew the
  reason for his attendance at Scotland Yard, and something of the interview
  which he had had.</p>

  <p>"I offered my resignation," he replied, in answer to her unspoken
  question, "and Sir Stanley refused it."</p>

  <p>"I think he was just," she said. "Why, it would be simply monstrous if
  your career were spoilt through no fault of your own."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us talk about me," he said. "What have you done?"</p>

  <p>"I've cancelled all my contracts; I have other work to do."</p>

  <p>"How are&mdash;" He hesitated, but she knew just what he meant, and patted
  his arm gratefully.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I have all the money I want," she said. "Father left me quite
  a respectable balance. I am closing the house at Horsham and storing the
  furniture, and shall keep just sufficient to fill a little flat I have taken
  in Bloomsbury."</p>

  <p>"But what are you going to do?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there are lots of things that a girl can do," she said vaguely,
  "besides going on the stage."</p>

  <p>"But isn't it a sacrifice? Didn't you love your work?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I thought I did at first," she said. "You see, I was always a very good
  mimic. When I was quite a little girl I could imitate the colonel.
  Listen!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly to his amazement he heard the drawling growl of Dan Boundary. She
  laughed with glee at his amazement, but the smile vanished and she
  sighed.</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me one thing, Mr. King&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stafford&mdash;you promised me," he began.</p>

  <p>She reddened.</p>

  <p>"I hardly like calling you by your christian name but it sounds so like a
  surname that perhaps it won't be so bad."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to ask?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment, then she said:</p>

  <p>"How far was my father implicated in this terrible business?"</p>

  <p>"In the gang?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>He was in a dilemma. Solomon White was implicated as deeply as any save
  the colonel. In his younger days he had been the genius who was responsible
  for the organisation and had been for years the colonel's right-hand man
  until the more subtle villainy of Pinto Silva, that Portuguese adventurer,
  had ousted him, and, if the truth be told, until the sight of his girl
  growing to womanhood had brought qualms to the heart of this man, who,
  whatever his faults, loved the girl dearly.</p>

  <p>"You don't answer me," she said, "but I think I am answered by your
  silence. Was my father&mdash;a bad man?"</p>

  <p>"I would not judge your father," he said. "I can tell you this, that for
  the past few years he has played a very small part in the affairs of the
  gang. But what are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"How persistent you are!" she laughed. "Why, there are so many things I am
  going to do that I haven't time to tell you. For one thing, I am going to
  work to undo some of the mischief which the gang have wrought. I am going to
  make such reparation as I can," she said, her lips trembling, "for the evil
  deeds my father has committed."</p>

  <p>"You have a mission, eh?" he said with a little smile.</p>

  <p>"Don't laugh at me," she pleaded. "I feel it here." She put her hand on
  her heart. "There's something which tells me that, even if my father built up
  this gang, as you told me once he did&mdash;ah! you had forgotten that."</p>

  <p>Stafford King had indeed forgotten the statement.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he said. "You intend to pull it down?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I feel, too, that I am at bay. I am the daughter of Solomon White, and
  Solomon White is regarded by the colonel as a traitor. Do you think they will
  leave me alone? Don't you think they are going to watch me day and night and
  get me in their power just as soon as they can? Think of the lever that would
  be, the lever to force my father back to them!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll be watched all right," he said easily, and remembered the
  commissioner's warning. "In fact, you're being watched now. Do you mind?"</p>

  <p>"Now?" she asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>He nodded towards a lady who sat a dozen yards away and whose face was
  carefully shaded by a parasol.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" asked the girl curiously.</p>

  <p>"A young person called Lollie Marsh," laughed Stafford. "At present she
  has a mission too, which is to entangle me into a compromising position."</p>

  <p>The girl looked towards the spy with a new interest and a new
  resentment.</p>

  <p>"She has been trailing me for weeks," he went on, "and it would be
  embarrassing to tell you the number of times we have been literally thrown
  into one another's arms. Poor girl!" he said, with mock concern, "she must be
  bored with sitting there so long. Let us take a stroll."</p>

  <p>If he expected Lollie to follow, he was to be disappointed She stayed on
  watching the disappearing figures, without attempting to rise, and waiting
  until they were out of sight, she walked out on to the Embankment and hailed
  a passing taxi. She seemed quite satisfied in her mind that the plan she had
  evolved for the trapping of Stafford King could not fail to succeed.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII. THE COLONEL CONDUCTS HIS BUSINESS</a></h2>

  <p>A merry little dinner party was assembled that night in a luxurious flat
  in Albemarle House. It was a bachelor party, and consisted of three
  &mdash;the colonel, resplendent in evening dress, "Swell" Crewe and a
  middle-aged man whose antique dress coat and none too spotless linen
  certainly did not advertise their owner's prosperity. Yet this man with the
  stubbly moustache and the bald head could write his cheque for seven figures,
  being Mr. Thomas Crotin, of the firm of Crotin and Principle, whose swollen
  mills occupy a respectable acreage in Huddersfield and Dewsbury.</p>

  <p>"You're Colonel Boundary, are you?" he said admiringly, and for about the
  seventh time since the meal started.</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded with a good-humoured twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Well, fancy that!" said Mr. Crotin. "I'll have something to talk about
  when I go back to Yorkshire. It is lucky I met your friend, Captain Crewe, at
  our club in Huddersfield."</p>

  <p>There was something more than luck in that meeting, as the colonel well
  knew.</p>

  <p>"I read about the trial and all," said the Yorkshireman; "I must say it
  looked very black against you, colonel."</p>

  <p>The colonel smiled again and lifted a bottle towards the other.</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay!" said the spinner. "I'll have nowt more. I've got as much as I
  can carry, and I know when I've had enough."</p>

  <p>The colonel replaced the bottle by his side.</p>

  <p>"So you read of the trial, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I did and all," said the other, "and I said to my missus: 'Yon's a clever
  fellow, I'd like to meet him.'"</p>

  <p>"You have an admiration for the criminal classes, eh?" said the colonel
  good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not saying you're a criminal," said the other, taking his host
  literally, "but being a J.P. and on the bench of magistrates, I naturally
  take an interest in these cases. You never know what you can learn."</p>

  <p>"And what did your lady wife say?" asked Boundary.</p>

  <p>The Yorkshireman smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"Well, she doesn't take any interest in these things. She's a proper
  London lady, my wife. She was in a high position when I married."</p>

  <p>"Five years ago," said Boundary, "you married the daughter of Lord
  Westsevern. It cost you a hundred thousand pounds to pay the old man's
  debts."</p>

  <p>The Yorkshireman stared at him.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You're nominated for Parliament, too, aren't you. And you're to be Mayor
  of Little Thornhill?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Crotin laughed uproariously.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got me properly taped," he said admiringly, and the colonel
  agreed with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"So you're interested in the criminal classes?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Crotin waved a protesting hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm not saying you're a member of the criminal classes, colonel," he
  said. "My friend Crewe here wouldn't think I would be so rude. Of course, I
  know the charge was all wrong."</p>

  <p>"That's where you're mistaken," interrupted the colonel calmly; "it was
  all right."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>The man stared.</p>

  <p>"The charge was perfectly sound," said the colonel, playing with his fruit
  knife; "for twenty years I have been making money by buying businesses at
  about a twentieth of their value and selling them again."</p>

  <p>"But how&mdash;" began the other.</p>

  <p>"Wait, I'll tell you. I've got men working for me all over the country,
  agents and sub-agents, who are constantly on the look-out for scandal.
  Housekeepers, servants, valets&mdash;you know the sort of people who get hold
  of information."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crotin was speechless.</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later I find a very incriminating fact which concerns a
  gentleman of property. I prefer those scandals which verge on the criminal,"
  the colonel went on.</p>

  <p>The outraged Mr. Crotin was rolling his serviette.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going? What are you going to do? The night's young," said
  the colonel innocently.</p>

  <p>"I'm going," said Mr. Crotin, very red of face. "A joke's a joke, and when
  friend Crewe introduced me to you, I hadn't any idea that you were that kind
  of man. You don't suppose that I'm going to sit here in your society&mdash;me
  with my high connections&mdash;after what you've said?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked the colonel; "after all, business is business, and as I'm
  making an offer to you for the Riverborne Mill&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Riverborne Mill?" roared the spinner. "Ah! that's a joke of yours!
  You'll buy no Riverborne Mill of me, sitha!"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I shall buy the Riverborne Mill from you. In fact, I
  have all the papers and transfers ready for you to sign."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have, have you?" said the man grimly. "And what might you be
  offering me for the Riverborne?"</p>

  <p>"I'm offering you thirty thousand pounds cash," said the colonel, and his
  bearer was stricken speechless.</p>

  <p>"Thirty thousand pounds cash!" he said after awhile. "Why, man, that
  property is worth two hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"I thought it was worth a little more," said the colonel carelessly.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool or a madman," said the angry Yorkshireman. "It isn't my
  mill, it is a limited company."</p>

  <p>"But you hold the majority of the shares&mdash;ninety-five per cent., I
  think," said the colonel. "Those are the shares which you will transfer to me
  at the price I suggest."</p>

  <p>"I'll see you damned first," roared Crotin, bringing his hand down smash
  on the table.</p>

  <p>"Sit down again for one moment." The colonel's voice was gentle but
  insistent. "Do you know Maggie Delman?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Crotin's face went white.</p>

  <p>"She was one of your father's mill-girls when you were little more than a
  boy," the colonel proceeded, "and you were rather in love with her, and one
  Easter you went away together to Blackpool. Do you remember?"</p>

  <p>Still Crotin did not speak.</p>

  <p>"You married the young lady and the marriage was kept secret because you
  were afraid of your father, and as the years went on and the girl was content
  with the little home you had made for her and the allowance you gave her,
  there seemed to be no need to admit your marriage, especially as there were
  no children. Then you began to take part in local politics and to accumulate
  ambitions. You dared not divorce your wife and you thought there was no
  necessity for it. You had a chance of improving yourself socially by marrying
  the daughter of an English lord, and you jumped at it."</p>

  <p>"You've got to prove that," he said huskily.</p>

  <p>The man found his voice.</p>

  <p>"I can prove it all right. Oh, no, your wife hasn't betrayed you
  &mdash;your real wife, I mean. You've betrayed yourself by insisting on
  paying her by telegraphic money orders. We heard of these mysterious payments
  but suspected nothing beyond a vulgar love affair. Then one night, whilst
  your placid and complacent wife was in a cinema, one of my people searched
  her box and came upon the certificate of marriage. Would you like to see
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to say," said Crotin thickly. "You've got me, mister. So
  that is how you do it!"</p>

  <p>"That is how I do it," said the colonel. "I believe in being frank with
  people like you. Here are the transfers. You see the place for your signature
  marked with a pencil."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Crotin leaped at him in a blind fury, but the colonel gripped him
  by the throat with a hand like a steel vice, and shook him as a dog would
  shake a rat. And the gentle tone in his voice changed as quickly.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and sign!" snarled Boundary. "If you play that game, I'll break
  your damned neck! Come any of those tricks with me and I'll smash you. Give
  him the pen, Crewe."</p>

  <p>"I'll see you in gaol for this," said the white-faced man shakily.</p>

  <p>"That's about the place you will see me, if you don't sign, and it is the
  inside of that gaol you'll be to see me."</p>

  <p>The man rose up unsteadily, flinging down the pen as he did so.</p>

  <p>"You'll suffer for this," he said between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Not unduly," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door and the colonel swung round.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Can I come in?" said a voice.</p>

  <p>Crewe was frowning.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>The door opened slowly. A gloved hand, and then a white, hooded face,
  slipped through the narrow entry.</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment! Poor old Jack o' Judgment come to make a call,"
  chuckled the hateful voice. "Down, dog; down!" He flourished the long-
  barrelled revolver theatrically, then turned with a chuckle of laughter to
  the gaping Mr. Crotin.</p>

  <p>"Poor Jacob!" he crooned, "he has sold his birthright for a mess of
  pottage! Don't touch that paper, Crewe, or you die the death!"</p>

  <p>His hand leapt out and snatched the transfer, which he thrust into the
  hand of the wool-spinner.</p>

  <p>"Get out and go home, my poor sheep," he said, "back to the blankets! Do
  you think they'd be satisfied with one mill? They'd come for a mill every
  year and they'd never leave you till you were dead or broke. Go to the
  police, my poor lamb, and tell them your sad story. Go to the admirable Mr.
  Stafford King&mdash;he'll fall on your neck. You won't, I see you won't!"</p>

  <p>The laughter rose again, and then swiftly with one arm he swung back the
  merchant and stood in silence till the door of the flat slammed.</p>

  <p>The colonel found his voice.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who you are," he said, breathing heavily, "but I'll make a
  bargain with you. I've offered a hundred thousand pounds to anybody who gets
  you. I'll offer you the same amount to leave me alone."</p>

  <p>"Make it a hundred thousand millions!" said Jack o' Judgment in his
  curious, squeaky voice, "give me the moon and an apple, and I'm yours!"</p>

  <p>He was gone before they could realise he had passed through the door, and
  he had left the flat before either moved.</p>

  <p>"Quick! The window!" said the colonel.</p>

  <p>The window commanded a view of the front entrance of Albemarle House, and
  the entry was well lighted. They reached the window in time to see the
  Yorkshireman emerge with unsteady steps and stride into the night. They
  waited for their visitor to follow. A minute, two minutes passed, and then
  somebody walked down the steps to the light. It was a woman, and as she
  turned her face the colonel gasped.</p>

  <p>"Maisie White!" he said in a wondering voice. "What the devil is she doing
  here?"</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII. THE LISTENER AT THE DOOR</a></h2>

  <p>Maisie White had taken up her abode in a modest flat in Doughty Street,
  Bloomsbury. The building had been originally intended for a dwelling house,
  but its enterprising owner had fitted a kitchenette and a bathroom to every
  floor and had made each suite self-contained.</p>

  <p>She found the one bedroom and a sitting-room quite sufficient for her
  needs. Since the day of her father's departure she had not heard from him,
  and she had resolutely refused to worry. What was Solomon White's association
  with the Boundary gang, she could only guess. She knew it had been an
  important one, but her fears on his behalf had less to do with the action the
  police might take against him than with Boundary's sinister threat.</p>

  <p>She had other reasons for leaving the stage than she had told Stafford
  King. On the stage she was a marked woman and her movements could be followed
  for at least three hours in the day, and she was anxious for more anonymity.
  She was conscious of two facts as she opened the outer door that night to let
  herself into the hallway, and hurried up to her apartments. The first was
  that she had been followed home, and that impression was the more important
  of the two. She did not switch on the light when she entered her room, but
  bolting the door behind her, she moved swiftly to the window and raised it
  noiselessly. Looking out, she saw two men on the opposite side of the street,
  standing together in consultation. It was too dark to recognise them, but she
  thought that one figure was Pinto Silva.</p>

  <p>She was not frightened, but nevertheless she looked thoughtfully at the
  telephone, and her hand was on the receiver before she changed her mind.
  After all, they would know where she lived and an inquiry at her agents or
  even at the theatre would tell them to where her letters had been
  readdressed. She hesitated a moment, then pulled down the blinds and switched
  on the light.</p>

  <p>Outside the two men saw the light flash up and watched her shadow cross
  the blind.</p>

  <p>"It is Maisie all right," said Pinto. "Now tell me what happened."</p>

  <p>In a few words Crewe described the scene which he had witnessed in the
  Albemarle flat.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" said Pinto; "are you suggesting that Maisie is Jack o'
  Judgment?"</p>

  <p>Crewe shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about it," he said; "there are the facts."</p>

  <p>Pinto looked up at the light again.</p>

  <p>"I'm going across to see her," he said, and Crewe made a grimace.</p>

  <p>"Is that wise?" he asked; "she doesn't know we have followed her home.
  Won't she be suspicious?"</p>

  <p>Pinto shrugged.</p>

  <p>"She's a pretty clever girl that," he said, "and if she doesn't know we're
  outside, there's nothing of Solomon White in her composition."</p>

  <p>He crossed the road and struck a match to discover which was her bell. He
  guessed right the first time. Maisie heard the tinkle and knew what it
  portended. She had not started to disrobe, and after a few moments'
  hesitation she went down the stairs and opened the door.</p>

  <p>"It is rather a late hour to call on you," said Pinto pleasantly, "but we
  saw you going away from Albemarle Place, and could not overtake you."</p>

  <p>There was a question in his voice, though he did not give it actual
  words.</p>

  <p>"It is rather late for small talk," she said coolly. "Is there any reason
  for your call?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss White, there were several things I wanted to talk to you
  about," said Pinto, taken aback by her calm. "Have you heard from your
  father?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," she said, "it would be better if you came at a more
  conventional hour? I don't feel inclined to gossip on the doorstep and I'm
  afraid I can't ask you in."</p>

  <p>"The colonel is worrying," Pinto hastened to explain. "You see, Solly's
  one of his best friends."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I know," she said. "I heard the colonel talking to my father at Horsham,"
  she added meaningly.</p>

  <p>"You've got to make allowances for the colonel," urged Pinto; "he lost his
  temper, but he's feeling all right now. Couldn't you persuade your father to
  communicate with us&mdash;with him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am not in a position to communicate with my father," she replied
  quietly. "I am just as ignorant of his whereabouts as you are. If anybody is
  anxious it is surely myself, Mr. Silva."</p>

  <p>"And another point," Silva went on, so that there should be no gap in the
  conversation, "why did you give up your theatrical engagements, Maisie? I
  took a lot of trouble to get them for you, and it is stupid to jeopardise
  your career. I have plenty of influence, but managers will not stand that
  kind of treatment, and when you go back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not going back," she said. "Really, Mr. Silva, you must excuse me
  to-night. I am very tired after a hard day's work&mdash;" she checked
  herself.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing now, Maisie?" asked Silva curiously.</p>

  <p>"I have no wish to prolong this conversation," said the girl, "but there
  is one thing I should like to say, and that is that I would prefer you to
  call me Miss White."</p>

  <p>"All right, all right," said Silva genially, "and what were you doing at
  the flat to-night, Mai&mdash;Miss White?"</p>

  <p>"Good night," said the girl and closed the door in his face.</p>

  <p>He cursed angrily in the dark and raised his hand to rap on the panel of
  the door, but thought better of it and, turning, walked back to the
  interested Crewe, who stood in the shadow of a lamp-post watching the
  scene.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Crewe.</p>

  <p>"Confound the girl, she won't talk," grumbled Silva. "I'd give something
  to break that pride of hers, Crewe. By jove, I'll do it one of these days,"
  he added between his teeth.</p>

  <p>Crewe laughed.</p>

  <p>"There's no sense in going off the deep end because a girl turns you
  down," he said. "What did she say about the flat? And what did she say about
  her visit to Albemarle Place?"</p>

  <p>"She said nothing," said the other shortly. "Come along, let's go back to
  the colonel."</p>

  <p>On the return journey he declined to be drawn into any kind of
  conversation, and Crewe, after one or two attempts to procure enlightenment
  as to the result of the interview, relapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>They found the colonel waiting for them, and to all appearances the
  colonel was undisturbed by the happenings of the evening.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She admits she was here," said Pinto.</p>

  <p>"What was she doing?"</p>

  <p>"You'd better ask her yourself," said the other with some asperity. "I
  tell you, colonel, I can't handle that woman."</p>

  <p>"Nobody ever thought you could," said the colonel. "Did she give you any
  idea as to what her business was?"</p>

  <p>Pinto shook his head and the colonel paced the big room thoughtfully, his
  big hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Here's a situation," he said. "There's some outsider who's following
  every movement we make, who knew that boob from Huddersfield was coming, and
  who knew what our business was. That somebody was this infernal Jack o'
  Judgment, but who is Jack o' Judgment, hey?"</p>

  <p>He looked round fiercely.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you who he is," he went on, speaking slowly "He's somebody who
  knows our gang as well as we know it ourselves, somebody who has been on the
  inside, somebody who has access, or who has had access, to our working
  methods. In fact," he said using his pet phrase, "a business associate."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" said Pinto.</p>

  <p>This polished man of Portugal, who had come into the gang very late in the
  day, was one of the few people who were privileged to offer blunt opposition
  to the leader of the Boundary Gang.</p>

  <p>"You might as well say it is I, or that it is Crewe, or Dempsey, or
  Selby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or White," said the colonel slowly; "don't forget White."</p>

  <p>They stared at him.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Crewe with a frown.</p>

  <p>White had been a favourite of his.</p>

  <p>"How could it be White?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't it be White?" said the colonel. "When did Jack o' Judgment
  make his first appearance? I'll tell you. About the time we started getting
  busy framing up something against White. Did we ever see him when White was
  with us&mdash;no! Isn't it obviously somebody who has been a business
  associate and knows our little ways? Why, of course it is. Tell me somebody
  else?</p>

  <p>"You don't suggest it is 'Snow' Gregory, anyway?" he added
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>Crewe shivered and half-closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake don't mention 'Snow' Gregory," he said irritably.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I?" snarled the colonel. "He's worth money and life and
  liberty to us, Crewe. He's an awful example that keeps some of our business
  associates on the straight path. Not," he added with elaborate care, "not
  that we were in any way responsible for his untimely end. But he
  died&mdash;providentially. A doper's bad enough, but a doper who talks and
  boasts and tells me, as he told me in this very room, just where he'd put me,
  is a mighty dangerous man, Crewe."</p>

  <p>"Did he do that?" asked Crewe with interest.</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"In this very room where you're standing," he said impressively, "at the
  end of that table he stood, all lit up with 'coco' and he told me things
  about our organisation that I thought nobody knew but myself. That's the
  worst of drugs," he said, shaking his head reprovingly; "you never know how
  clever they'll make a man, and they made 'Snow' a bit too clever. I'm not
  saying that I regretted his death&mdash;far from it. I don't know how he got
  mixed up in the affair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up!" growled Pinto; "why go on acting before us? We were all in
  it."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said the colonel with a glance at the door.</p>

  <p>There was a silence. All eyes were fixed on the door.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anything?" asked the colonel under his breath.</p>

  <p>His face was a shade paler than they had ever remembered seeing it.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," said Pinto; "that fellow's got on your nerves."</p>

  <p>The colonel walked to the sideboard and poured out a generous portion of
  whisky and drank it at a gulp.</p>

  <p>"Lots of things are getting on my nerves," he said, "but nothing gets on
  my nerves so much as losing money. Crewe, we've got to go after that
  Yorkshireman again&mdash;at least somebody has got to go after him."</p>

  <p>"And that somebody is not going to be me," said Crewe quietly. "I did my
  part of the business. Let Pinto have a cut."</p>

  <p>Pinto Silva shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We'll drop him," he said decisively, and for the first time Crewe
  realised how dominating a factor Pinto had become in the government of the
  band.</p>

  <p>"We'll drop him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped and craned his head round.</p>

  <p>It was he who had heard something near the door, and now with noiseless
  steps he tiptoed across the room to the door, and gripping the handle, opened
  it suddenly. A gun had appeared in his hand, but he did not use it. Instead,
  he darted through the open doorway and they heard the sound of a struggle.
  Presently he came back, dragging by the collar a man.</p>

  <p>"Got him!" he said triumphantly, and hurled his captive into the nearest
  chair.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX. THE COLONEL EMPLOYS A DETECTIVE</a></h2>

  <p>Their prisoner was a stranger. He was a lean, furtive-looking man of
  thirty-five, below middle height, respectably dressed, and at first glance,
  the colonel, whose hobby was distinguishing at a look the social standing of
  humanity, was unable to place him.</p>

  <p>Crewe locked the door.</p>

  <p>"Now then," said the colonel, "what the devil were you doing listening at
  my door? Was that his game, Mr. Silva?"</p>

  <p>"That was his game," said the other, brushing his hands.</p>

  <p>"What have you got to say before I send for the police?" asked the colonel
  virtuously. "What have you got to say for yourself? Sneaking about a
  gentleman's flat, listening at keyholes!"</p>

  <p>The man, who had been roughly handled, had risen and was putting his
  collar straight. If he had been taken aback by the sudden onslaught, he was
  completely self-possessed now.</p>

  <p>"If you want to send for the police, you'd better start right away," he
  said; "you've got a telephone, haven't you? Perhaps I'll have a job for the
  policeman, too. You've no right to assault me, my friend," he said,
  addressing Pinto resentfully.</p>

  <p>"What were you doing?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Find out," said the man sharply.</p>

  <p>The colonel stroked his long moustache, and his manner underwent a
  change.</p>

  <p>"Now look here, old man," he said almost jovially; "we're all friends
  here, and we don't want any trouble. I daresay you've made a mistake, and my
  friend has made a mistake. Have a whisky and soda?"</p>

  <p>The man grinned crooked.</p>

  <p>"Not me, thank you," he said emphatically; "if I remember rightly, there
  was a young gentleman who took a glass of water in North Lambeth Police Court
  the other day, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The colonel's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Well, sit down and be sociable. If you're suggesting that I'm going to
  poison you, you're also suggesting that you know something which I don't want
  you to tell. Or that you have discovered one of those terrible secrets that
  the newspapers are all writing about. Now be a sensible man; have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You have a drink of whisky out of the same bottle, and I'll join
  you."</p>

  <p>"Help yourself," said the colonel good-naturedly. "Give me any glass you
  like."</p>

  <p>The man went to the sideboard, poured out two pegs and sent the soda-
  water sizzling into the long glasses.</p>

  <p>"Here's yours and here's mine," he said; "good luck!"</p>

  <p>He drank the whisky off, after he had seen the colonel drink his, and
  wiped his mouth with a gaudy handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking it for granted," said the colonel, "that we've made no mistake
  and that you were listening at our door. Now we want no unpleasantness, and
  we'll talk about this matter as sensible human beings and man to man."</p>

  <p>"That's the way to talk," said the other, smacking his lips.</p>

  <p>"You've been sent here to watch me."</p>

  <p>"I may have and I may not have," said the other.</p>

  <p>Pinto shifted impatiently, but the colonel stopped him with a look.</p>

  <p>"Now let me see what you are," mused the colonel, still wearing that
  benevolent smile of his. "You're not an ordinary tradesman. You've got a look
  of the book canvasser about you. I have it&mdash;you're a private
  detective!"</p>

  <p>The man smirked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am," said he, "and," he added, "perhaps I'm not."</p>

  <p>The colonel slapped him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Of course you are," he said confidently; "we don't see shrewd- looking
  fellows like you every day. You're a split!"</p>

  <p>"Not official," said the man quickly.</p>

  <p>He had all the English private detective's fear of posing as the genuine
  article.</p>

  <p>"Now look here," said the colonel, "I'm going to be perfectly straight
  with you, and you've got to be straight with me. That's fair, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Quite fair," said the man; "if I've been misconducting myself in any
  manner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," said the colonel politely, "my friend here will
  apologise for handling you roughly, I'm sure; won't you, Mr. Silva?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said the other, without any great heartiness.</p>

  <p>He was tired of this conversation and was anxious to know where it was
  leading.</p>

  <p>"You're not in the private detective business for your health," said the
  colonel, and the man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I bet you're working for a firm that's paying you about three pounds a
  week and your miserable expenses&mdash;a perfect dog's life."</p>

  <p>"You're quite right there," said the man, and he spoke with the
  earnestness of the ill-used wage-earner, "it is a dog's life; out in all
  kinds of weather, all hours of the day and night, and never so much as 'thank
  you' for any work you do. Why, we get no credit at all, sir. If we go into
  the witness-box, the lawyers treat us like dirt."</p>

  <p>"I absolutely agree with you," said the colonel, shaking his head. "I
  think the private detective business in this country isn't appreciated as it
  ought to be. And it is very curious we should have met you," he went on;
  "only this evening I was saying to my friends here, that we ought to get a
  good man to look after our interests. You've heard about me, I'm sure,
  Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Snakit," said the other; "here's my card."</p>

  <p>He produced a card from his waistcoat pocket, and the colonel read it.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Horace Snakit," he said, "of Dooby and Somes. Now what do you say to
  coming into our service?"</p>

  <p>The man blinked.</p>

  <p>"I've got a good job&mdash;" he began inconsistently.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a better&mdash;six pounds a week, regular expenses and an
  allowance for dressing."</p>

  <p>"It's a bet!" said Mr. Snakit promptly.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can consider yourself engaged right away. Now, Mr. Snakit, as
  frankness is the basis of our intercourse, you will tell me straight away
  whether you were engaged in watching me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll admit that, sir," said the man readily. "I had a job to watch you
  and to discover if you knew the whereabouts of a certain person."</p>

  <p>"Who engaged you?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" the man hesitated. "I don't know whether it isn't betraying
  the confidence of a client," he waited for some encouragement to pursue the
  path of rectitude and honour, but received none. "Well, I'll tell you
  candidly, our firm has been engaged by a young lady. She brought me here
  to-night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss White, eh?" said the colonel quickly.</p>

  <p>"Miss White it was, sir," said Snakit.</p>

  <p>"So that was why she was here? She wanted to show you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just where your rooms were, sir," said the man. "She also wanted to show
  me the back stairs by which I could get out of the building if I wanted
  to."</p>

  <p>"What were your general instructions?"</p>

  <p>"Just to watch you, sir, and if I had an opportunity when you were out, of
  sneaking in and nosing round."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the colonel. "Crewe, just take Mr. Snakit downstairs and
  tell him where to report. Fix up his pay&mdash;you know," he gave a
  significant sideways jerk of his head, and Crewe escorted the gratified
  little detective from the apartment.</p>

  <p>When the door had closed, the colonel turned on Silva.</p>

  <p>"Pinto," he said and there was a rumble in his voice which betrayed his
  anger, "that girl is dangerous. She may or may not know where her father
  is&mdash;this detective business may be a blind. Probably Snakit was sent
  here knowing that he would be captured and spill the beans."</p>

  <p>"That struck me, too," said Pinto.</p>

  <p>"She's dangerous," repeated the colonel.</p>

  <p>He resumed his promenade up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"She's an active worker and she's working against us. Now, I'm going to
  settle with Miss White," he said gratingly. "I'm going to settle with her for
  good and all. I don't care what she knows, but she probably knows too much.
  She's hand in glove with the police and maybe she's working with her father.
  You'll get Phillopolis here to-morrow morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The other's eyes opened.</p>

  <p>"Phillopolis?" he almost gasped. "Good heavens! You're not going
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The colonel faced him squarely.</p>

  <p>"You've had your chance with the girl and you've missed it," he said.
  "You've tried your fancy method of courting and you've fallen down."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not going to stand for Phillopolis," said the other, with tense
  face. "I tell you I like the girl. There's going to be none of
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there isn't, isn't there?" said the colonel in his silkiest tone.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly he leaned forward across the table and his face was the face
  of a devil.</p>

  <p>"There's only one Boundary Gang, Pinto, and this is it," he said between
  his clenched white teeth, "and there's only one Dan Boundary and that's me.
  Do you get me, Pinto? You can go a long way with me if I happen to be going
  that way. But you stand in the road and you're going to get what's coming.
  I've been good to you, Pinto. I've stood your interference because it amused
  me. But you come up against me, really up against me, and by the Lord Harry!
  you'll know it. Did you get that?"</p>

  <p>"I've got it" said Pinto sullenly.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. THE GREEK PHILLOPOLIS</a></h2>

  <p>The upbuilding of the Boundary gang had neither been an accident, nor was
  it exactly designed on the lines which it ultimately followed.</p>

  <p>The main structure was Boundary himself, with his extraordinary financial
  genius, his plausibility, his lightning exploitation of every advantage which
  offered. Outwardly he was the head of three trading corporations which
  complied with the laws, paid small but respectable dividends and cloaked
  other operations which never appeared in the official records of the
  companies.</p>

  <p>The sidelines of the gang came through force of circumstances. Men
  &mdash;good, bad and indifferent&mdash;were drawn into the orbit of its
  activities, as extraordinary circumstances arose or dire necessities
  dictated. Throughout the length and breadth of Britain, through France,
  Italy, and in the days before the war, and even during the war, in Germany,
  in Russia and in the United States, were men who, if they could not be
  described as agents, were at least ready tools.</p>

  <p>He had a finger in every unsavoury pie. The bank robber discharged from
  gaol did not ask Colonel Boundary to finance him in the purchase of a new kit
  of tools&mdash;an up-to date burglar's kit costs something over two hundred
  pounds&mdash;but there were people who would lend the money, which eventually
  came out of the colonel's pocket. Some of the businesses he financed were on
  the border line of respectability. Some into which his money was sunk were
  frankly infamous. But it was a popular fiction that he knew nothing of these.
  Or, if he did know, that he was financing or at the back of a scoundrel, it
  was insisted that that scoundrel was engaged in (so far as the colonel knew)
  legitimate enterprise.</p>

  <p>Paul Phillopolis was a small Greek merchant, who had an office in Mincing
  Court&mdash;a tiny room at the top of four flights of stairs. On the glass
  panel of its door was the announcement: "General Exporter."</p>

  <p>Mr. Phillopolis spent three or four hours at his office daily and for the
  rest of the time, particularly towards the evening, was to be found in a
  <i>brasserie</i> in Soho. He was a dark little man, with fierce moustachios
  and a set of perfect white teeth which he displayed readily, for he was
  easily amused. His most intimate acquaintances knew him to be an exporter of
  Greek produce to South America, and he was, in the large sense of the word,
  eminently respectable.</p>

  <p>Occasionally he would be seen away from his customary haunt, discussing
  with a compatriot some very urgent business, which few knew about. For there
  were ships which cleared from the Greek ports, carrying cargoes to the order
  of Mr. Phillopolis, which did not appear in any bill of lading. Dazed-looking
  Armenian girls, girls from South Russia, from Greece, from Smyrna, en route
  to a promised land, looked forward to the realisation of those wonderful
  visions which the Greek agent had so carefully sketched.</p>

  <p>In half a dozen South American towns the proprietors of as many dance
  halls would look over the new importations approvingly and remit their bank
  drafts to the merchant of Mincing Court. It was a profitable business,
  particularly in pre-war days.</p>

  <p>The colonel departed from his usual practice and met the Greek himself,
  the place of meeting being a small hotel in Aldgate. Whatever other pretences
  the colonel made, he did not attempt to continue the fiction that he was
  ignorant of the Greek's trade.</p>

  <p>"Paul," he said after the first greetings were over, "I've been a good
  friend to you."</p>

  <p>"You have indeed, colonel," said the man gratefully.</p>

  <p>He spoke English with a very slight accent, for he had been born and
  educated in London.</p>

  <p>"If ever I can render you a service&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can," said the colonel, "but it is not going to be easy."</p>

  <p>The Greek eyed him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Easy or hard," he said, "I'll go through with it."</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"How is the business in South America?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>The Greek spread out his hands in deprecation.</p>

  <p>"The war!" he said tragically, "you can imagine what it has been like. All
  those girls waiting for music-hall engagements and impossible to ship them
  owing to the fleets. I must have lost thousands of pounds."</p>

  <p>"The demand hasn't slackened off, eh?" asked the colonel, and the Greek
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"South America is full of money. They have millions&mdash;billions. Almost
  every other man is a millionaire. The music-halls have patrons but no
  talent."</p>

  <p>The colonel smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"There's a girl in London of exceptional ability," he said. "She has
  appeared in a music-hall here, and she's as beautiful as a dream."</p>

  <p>"English?" asked the Greek eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Irish, which is better," said the other; "as pretty as a picture, I tell
  you. The men will rave about her."</p>

  <p>The Greek looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Does she want to go?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The colonel snarled round at him:</p>

  <p>"Do you think I should come and ask you to book her passage if she wanted
  to go?" he demanded. "Of course she doesn't want to go, and she doesn't know
  she's going. But I want her out of the way, you understand?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Phillopolis pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>"To take her from England?"</p>

  <p>"From London," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>The Greek shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," he said; "passports are required and unless she was
  willing to go it would be impossible to take her. You can't kidnap a girl and
  rush her out of the country except in storybooks, colonel."</p>

  <p>Boundary interrupted him impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think I know that?" he asked; "your job is, when she's in a fit
  state of mind, to take her across and put her somewhere where she's not
  coming back for a long time. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand that part of it very well," said the Greek.</p>

  <p>"I'm not to be mixed up in it," said Boundary. "The only thing I can
  promise you is that she'll go quietly. I'll have her passports fixed. She'll
  be travelling for her health&mdash;you understand? When you get to South
  America I want you to take her into the interior of the country. You're not
  to leave her in the music-halls in one of the coast towns where English and
  American tourists are likely to see her."</p>

  <p>"But how are you going to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's my business," said the colonel. "You understand what you have to
  do. I'll send you the date you leave and I'll pay her passage and yours. For
  any out-of-pocket expenses you can send the bill to me, you understand?"</p>

  <p>Obviously it was not a job to the liking of Phillopolis, but he had good
  reason to fear the colonel and acquiesced with a nod. Boundary went back to
  where he had left Pinto and found the Portuguese biting his finger-
  nails&mdash;a favourite spare-time occupation of his.</p>

  <p>"Did you fix it?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I fixed it," said the colonel sharply.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to have anything to do with it," said the other, and the
  colonel smiled.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'll change your mind," he said significantly.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door and the colonel himself answered it. He took
  the card from the servant's hand and read:</p>

  <p>"Mr. STAFFORD KING, "Criminal Intelligence Department."</p>

  <p>He looked from the card to Pinto, then</p>

  <p>"Show him in."</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI. THE COLONEL AT SCOTLAND YARD</a></h2>

  <p>The two men had not met since they had parted at the door of the North
  Lambeth Police Court, and there was in Colonel Boundary's smile something of
  forgiveness and gentle reproach.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. King," he said, "come in, come in, won't you?"</p>

  <p>He offered his hand to the other, but Stafford apparently did not see
  it.</p>

  <p>"No malice, I trust, Mr. King?" said the colonel genially. "You know my
  friend Mr. Silva? A business associate of mine, a director of several of my
  companies."</p>

  <p>"I know him all right," said Stafford and added, "I hope to know him
  better."</p>

  <p>Pinto recognised the underlying sense of the words, but not a muscle of
  his face moved. For Stafford King the hatred with which he regarded the law
  lost its personal character. This man was something more than a thief- taker
  and a tracker of criminals. Pinto chose to regard him as the close friend of
  Maisie White, and as such, his rival.</p>

  <p>"And to what are we indebted for this visit?" asked the bland colonel.</p>

  <p>"The chief wants to see you."</p>

  <p>"The chief?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Stanley Belcom. Being the chief of our department I should have
  thought you had heard of him."</p>

  <p>"Sir Stanley Belcom," repeated the other; "why, of course, I know Sir
  Stanley by repute. May I ask what he wants to see me about? And how is my
  young friend&mdash;er&mdash;Miss White?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"When I saw her last," replied Stafford steadily, "she was looking pretty
  well, so far as I could tell."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said the colonel politely. "I have a considerable interest in
  the welfare of Miss White. May I ask when you saw her?</p>

  <p>"Last night," replied Stafford. "She was standing at the door of her
  apartments in Doughty Street, having a little talk with your friend," he
  nodded to Pinto, and Pinto started; "also," said the cheerful Stafford,
  "another mutual friend of ours, Mr. Crewe, was within hailing distance,
  unless I am greatly mistaken."</p>

  <p>"So you were watching, eh?" burst out Pinto "I thought after the lesson
  you had a couple of weeks ago, you'd have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let me carry on this conversation, if you don't mind," said the colonel,
  and the fury in his eyes silenced the Portuguese.</p>

  <p>"We have agreed to let bygones be bygones, Mr. King, and I am sure it is
  only his excessive zeal on my behalf that induced our friend to be so
  indiscreet as to refer to the unpleasant happenings&mdash;which we will allow
  to pass from our memories."</p>

  <p>So the girl was being watched. That made things rather more difficult than
  he had imagined. Nevertheless, he anticipated no supreme obstacle to the
  actual abduction. His plans had been made that morning, when he saw in the
  columns of the daily newspaper a four-line advertisement which, to a large
  extent, had cleared away the greatest of his difficulties.</p>

  <p>"And if Mr. King is looking after our young friend, Maisie White, the
  daughter of one of our dearest business associates&mdash;why, I'm glad," he
  went on heartily. "London, Mr. King, is a place full of danger for young
  girls, particularly those who are deprived of the loving care of a parent,
  and one of the chief attractions, if I may be allowed to say so, which the
  police have for me, is the knowledge that they are the protectors of the
  unprotected, the guardians of the unguarded."</p>

  <p>He made a little bow, and for all his amusement Stafford gravely
  acknowledged the handsome compliment which the most notorious scoundrel in
  London had paid the Metropolitan Police Force.</p>

  <p>"When am I to see your chief?"</p>

  <p>"You can come along with me now, if you like, or you can go to- morrow
  morning at ten o'clock," said Stafford.</p>

  <p>The colonel scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I understand that this summons is in the nature of a
  friendly&mdash;" he stopped questioningly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly," said Stafford, his eyes twinkling, "it isn't the
  customary 'come-along-o'-me' demand. I think the chief wants to meet you, to
  discover just the kind of person you are. You will like him, I think,
  colonel. He is the sort of man who takes a tremendous interest
  in&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In crime?" said the colonel gently.</p>

  <p>"I was trying to think of a nice word to put in its place," admitted
  Stafford; "at any rate, he is interested in you."</p>

  <p>"There is no time like the present," said the colonel. "Pinto, will you
  find my hat?"</p>

  <p>On the way to Scotland Yard they chatted on general subjects till Stafford
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Have you had another visitation from your friend?"</p>

  <p>"The Jack o' Judgment?" asked the colonel. "Yes, we met him the other
  night. He's rather amusing. By the way, have you had complaints from anywhere
  else?"</p>

  <p>Stafford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, he seems to have specialised on you, colonel. You have certainly the
  monopoly of his attentions."</p>

  <p>"What is going to happen supposing he makes an appearance when I happen to
  have a lethal weapon ready?" asked the colonel. "I have never killed a person
  in my life, and I hope the sad experience will not be mine. But from the
  police point of view, how do I stand suppose&mdash;there is an accident?"</p>

  <p>Stafford shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That is his look out," he said. "If you are threatened, I dare say a jury
  of your fellow countrymen will decide that you acted in self- defence."</p>

  <p>"He came the other night," the colonel said reminiscently, "when we were
  fixing up a particularly difficult&mdash;er&mdash;business negotiation."</p>

  <p>"Bad luck!" said Stafford. "I suppose the mug was scared?"</p>

  <p>"The what?" asked the puzzled colonel.</p>

  <p>"The mug," said Stafford. "You may not have heard the expression. It means
  'can'&mdash;'fool'&mdash;'dupe.'"</p>

  <p>The colonel drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"You still bear malice, I see, Mr. King," he said sadly.</p>

  <p>He entered the portals of Scotland Yard without so much as a tremor,
  passed up the broad stairs and along the unlovely corridors, till he came to
  the double doors which marked the First Commissioner's private office.
  Stafford disappeared for a moment and presently returned with the news that
  the First Commissioner would not be able to see his visitor for half an hour.
  Stafford apologised but the colonel was affability itself and kept up a
  running conversation until a beckoning secretary notified them that the great
  man was disengaged.</p>

  <p>It was King who ushered the colonel into his presence. Sir Stanley was
  writing at a big desk and looked up as the colonel entered.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, colonel," he said, nodding his head to a chair on the opposite
  side of the desk. "You needn't wait, King. There are one or two things I want
  to speak to the colonel about."</p>

  <p>When the door had closed behind the detective, Sir Stanley leaned back in
  his chair. Their eyes met, the grey and the faded blue, and for the space of
  a few seconds they stared. Sir Stanley Belcom was the first to drop his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I've sent for you, colonel," he said, "because I think you might give me
  a great deal of information, if you're willing."</p>

  <p>"Command me," said the colonel grandly.</p>

  <p>"It is on the matter of a murder which was committed in London a few
  months ago," said the commissioner quietly and for a moment Colonel Boundary
  did not speak.</p>

  <p>"I presume you are referring to the 'Snow' Gregory murder?" he said at
  last.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," nodded the commissioner. "We have had an inquiry from America
  as to the identity of this young man. Now, you knew him better than anybody
  else in London, colonel. Can you tell me, was he an American?"</p>

  <p>"Emphatically not," said the colonel with a little sigh, as though he were
  relieved at the turn the conversation was taking. "I came to know him
  through&mdash;er&mdash;circumstances, and exactly what they were I cannot for
  the moment remember. I had a lot to do with him. He did odd jobs for me."</p>

  <p>"Was he well educated?" asked the commissioner.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I should say he was," said the colonel slowly. "There was a story
  that he had been to Oxford, and that's very likely true. He spoke like a
  college man."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if he had any relations in England?"</p>

  <p>The commissioner eyed the other straightly and the colonel hesitated. How
  much does this man know? he wondered, and decided that he could do no harm if
  he told all the truth.</p>

  <p>"He had no relations in England," he said, "but he had a father who was
  abroad."</p>

  <p>"Ah, now we're getting at some facts," said the commissioner and drew a
  slip of paper towards him. "What was the father's name?"</p>

  <p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That I can't tell you, sir," he said. "I should like to oblige you but I
  have no more idea of what his name was than the man in the moon. I believe he
  was in India, because letters from India used to come to Gregory."</p>

  <p>"Was Gregory his name?"</p>

  <p>"His Christian name, I think," said the colonel after a moment's thought.
  "He went wrong at college and was sent down. Then he went to Paris and
  started to study art, and he got in trouble there, too. That's as much as he
  ever told me."</p>

  <p>"He had no brothers?" asked the commissioner.</p>

  <p>"None," said the colonel emphatically. "I am certain of that, because he
  once thanked God that he was the only child."</p>

  <p>"I see," the commissioner nodded; "you have formed no theory as to why he
  met his death or how?"</p>

  <p>"No theory at all," said the colonel, but corrected himself. "Of course,
  I've had ideas and opinions, but none of them has ever worked out. So far as
  I know, he had no enemies, although he was a quick-tempered chap, especially
  when he was recovering from a dose of 'coco,' and would quarrel with his own
  grandmother."</p>

  <p>"You've no idea why he was in London? Apparently he did not live
  here."</p>

  <p>The colonel shrugged his massive shoulders.</p>

  <p>"No, I couldn't tell you anything about that, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"He was not an American?" asked the commissioner again.</p>

  <p>"I could swear to that," answered the colonel.</p>

  <p>There was a pause and he waited.</p>

  <p>"There's another matter." The commissioner spoke slowly. "I understand
  that you are being bothered by a mysterious individual who calls himself the
  Knave of Judgment."</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment," corrected the colonel with a contemptuous smile.
  "Those sort of monkey tricks don't bother me, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>"I have my theories about the Jack o' Judgment," said the commissioner. "I
  have been looking up the circumstances of the murder, and I seem to remember
  that on the body was found a playing card."</p>

  <p>"That's right," said the colonel, who had remembered the fact himself many
  times, "the Jack of Clubs."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what that Jack of Clubs signified?" asked the commissioner,
  but the colonel could honestly say that he did not. Its presence on the body
  had frequently puzzled him and he had never found a solution.</p>

  <p>"There is a certain type of ruffian to be found, particularly in Paris,
  who affects this sort of theatrical trade-mark&mdash;did you know that?"
  asked the commissioner.</p>

  <p>The colonel was suddenly stricken to silence. He did not know this fact,
  in spite of his extraordinary knowledge of the criminal world.</p>

  <p>"These men have their totems and their sign manuals," said the
  commissioner. "For example, the apache Flequier, who was executed at Nantes
  the other day, invariably left a domino&mdash;the double-six &mdash;near his
  victim."</p>

  <p>This was news to the colonel too.</p>

  <p>"I've been giving a great deal of thought and time to this case," said the
  commissioner, "and I was hoping that perhaps you could help me. The most
  workable theory that I can suggest is that this unfortunate man was destroyed
  by a French criminal of the class which I have indicated, the bullying apache
  type, which is so common in France. Why the murder was committed," the
  commissioner fingered his paper-knife carelessly, "what led to it and who
  committed it, and more especially who instigated the crime, are matters which
  seem to me to defy detection. Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," said the colonel, licking his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Now I suggest to you," said the commissioner, "that your Jack o'
  Judgment, whoever he is, is some relation to the dead man."</p>

  <p>He spoke slowly and emphatically and the colonel did not raise his eyes
  from the desk.</p>

  <p>"It is not my business to make life any easier for you," the commissioner
  was saying, "or to assist you in any way. But as the Jack o' Judgment seems
  to me to be engaged in a wholly illegal practice, and as I, in my capacity,
  must suppress illegal practices, I make you a present of this
  suggestion."</p>

  <p>"That the Jack o' Judgment is related to 'Snow' Gregory?" asked the
  colonel huskily.</p>

  <p>"That is my suggestion," said the commissioner.</p>

  <p>"And you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The commissioner raised his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I think he is your greatest danger, colonel," he said, "far greater than
  the police, far greater than the clever minds which are planning to bring you
  to the dock and possibly," he added, "to the gallows."</p>

  <p>Ordinarily the colonel would have protested at the suggestion in the
  speech, protested laughingly or with dignity, but now he was stricken dumb,
  both by the seriousness of the commissioner's voice and by the consciousness
  of a new and a more terrible danger than any that had confronted him. He
  rose, realising that the interview was ended.</p>

  <p>"I am greatly obliged to you, Sir Stanley," he said clearing his throat.
  "It is good of you to warn me, but I'd not like you to think that I am
  engaged in any dishonest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll let that matter stand over for discussion until another time," said
  the commissioner dryly, as Stafford King came into the room. "You might show
  the colonel the way to the street. Otherwise he will be getting himself
  entangled in some of our detention rooms. Good morning, Colonel Boundary.
  Don't forget."</p>

  <p>"I'm not likely to," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>He recovered his poise quickly enough and by the time he was in the street
  he was back in his old mood. But he had had a shock. That sunny afternoon was
  filled with shadows. The booming bells of Big Ben tolled "Jack o' Judgment,"
  the very wheels of the taxi droned the words. And Colonel Boundary came back
  to Albemarle Place for the first time in his life with his confidence in
  Colonel Boundary shaken.</p>

  <p>There was nobody in save the one manservant he kept by the day, and he
  passed into the dining-room overlooking the street. He had work to do and it
  had to be done quickly. In one of the walls was set a stout safe, and this he
  opened, taking from it a steel box which he carried to the table. There was a
  fire laid on the hearth and to this he put a match though the day was warm
  enough. Then he proceeded to unlock the box. Apparently it was empty, but,
  taking out his scarf-pin, he inserted the point in a tiny hole, which would
  have escaped casual observation, and pressed.</p>

  <p>Half the steel bottom of the box leapt up, disclosing a shallow cavity
  beneath. The colonel stared. There had been two letters put in there, letters
  which he had put away against the moment when it might be necessary to bring
  a recalcitrant agent to heel. They had gone. He slid his fingers beneath the
  half of the bottom which had not opened and felt a card. He drew this out and
  looked at it, licking his lips the while.</p>

  <p>For the space of a minute he stared and stared at the Knave of Clubs he
  held in his hand. A Knave of Clubs signed with a flourish across its face:
  "Jack o' Judgment." Then he flung the card into the fire and, walking to the
  sideboard, splashed whisky into a tumbler with a hand that shook.</p>

     id="chap12">XII. BUYING A NURSING HOME</a></h2>

  <p>The building in which Colonel Boundary had his beautiful home was of a
  type not uncommonly met with in the West End of London. The street floor was
  taken up entirely with shops, the first floor with offices and the remainder
  of the building was practically given over to the colonel. One by one he had
  ousted every tenant from the building, and practically the whole of the
  fourteen sets of apartments which constituted the residential portion of the
  building was held by him in one name or another. Some he had obtained by the
  payment of heavy premiums, some he had secured when the lease of the former
  tenant had lapsed, some he had gathered in by sub- hiring. He had tried to
  buy the building, since it served his purpose well, but came against a deed
  of trust and the Court of Chancery, and had wisely refrained from going any
  further into a matter which must bring him vis-a-vis with a Master in
  Chancery, with all the publicity which such a transaction entailed.</p>

  <p>Nor had he been successful in acquiring any of the premises on the first
  floor. They were held by three very old established businesses &mdash;an
  estate agent, a firm of land surveyors and the offices of a valuer. He missed
  his opportunity, at any rate, of securing the business of Lee and Hol, the
  surveyors, and did not know it was in the market until after it had been
  transferred to a new owner. But they were quiet, sober tenants, who closed
  their offices between five and six every night and did not open them until
  between nine or ten on the following morning, and their very respectability
  gave him a certain privacy.</p>

  <p>The new proprietor of Lee and Hol was a short-sighted, elderly man of no
  great conversational power, and apparently of no fixed purpose in life except
  to say "no" to the very handsome offers which the colonel's agents made when
  they discovered there was a chance of re-purchasing the business. Boundary
  had personally inspected all the offices. He had found an excuse to visit
  them several times, duly noted the arrangement of the furniture, the sizes of
  the staffs and the general character of the business which was being carried
  on. This was a necessary precaution because these offices were immediately
  under his own flat. But just now they had a special value, because it was a
  practice during the daytime for the three firms to employ a commissionaire,
  who occupied a little glass- partitioned office on the landing and attended
  impartially to the needs of all three tenants to the best of his ability.</p>

  <p>Boundary descended the stairs and found the elderly man in his office,
  leisurely and laboriously affixing stamps to a pile of letters. He called him
  from his task.</p>

  <p>"Judson," he said, "have you seen anybody go up to my rooms this
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>The man thought.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I haven't," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Have you been here all the time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, since one o'clock I have been in my office," said the
  commissionaire. "None of our young gentlemen wanted anything."</p>

  <p>"You didn't go out to go to the post?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the man. "I've not stirred from this office except for one
  minute when I went into Mr. Lee's office to get these letters."</p>

  <p>"And you've seen nobody go upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"Not since Mr. Silva came down, sir. He came down after you, if you
  remember."</p>

  <p>"Nobody's been up?" insisted the other.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul. Your servant came down before you, sir."</p>

  <p>"That's true," said the colonel remembering that he had sent the man on a
  special journey to Huddersfield with a letter to the bigamous Mr. Crotin.
  "You haven't seen a lady go up at all?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Nobody has gone up them stairs," said the commissionaire emphatically. "I
  hope you haven't lost anything, sir?"</p>

  <p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't lost anything. Rather, I've found something," he said
  grimly.</p>

  <p>He slipped half-a crown into the man's hand.</p>

  <p>"You needn't mention the fact that I've been making inquiries," he said
  and went slowly up the stairs again.</p>

  <p>The card had been put there that day. He would swear it. The ink on the
  card had not had time to darken and when he made a further search of his
  room, this view was confirmed by the appearance of his blotting-pad. The card
  had been dried there, and the pen, which had been left on the table, was
  still damp.</p>

  <p>The colonel passed into his bedroom and took off his coat and vest. He
  searched his drawer and found what looked to be like a pair of braces made of
  light fabric. These he slipped over his shoulder, adjusting them so that
  beneath his left arm hung a canvas holster. From another drawer he took an
  automatic pistol, pulled the magazine from the butt and examined it before he
  returned it, and forced a cartridge into the breach by drawing back the
  cover. This he carefully oiled, and then, pressing up the safety catch, he
  slipped the pistol into the holster and resumed his coat and vest.</p>

  <p>It was a long time since the colonel had carried a gun under his arm, but
  his old efficiency was unimpaired. He practised before a mirror and was
  satisfied with his celerity. He loaded a spare magazine, and dropped it into
  the capacious pocket of his waistcoat. Then, putting the remainder of the
  cartridges away tidily, he closed the box, shut the drawer and went back to
  his room. If all the commissioner had hinted were true, if this mysterious
  visitor was laying for him because of the 'Snow' Gregory affair, he should
  have what was coming to him.</p>

  <p>The colonel was no coward and if this eerie experience had got a little on
  his nerves, it was not to be wondered at. He drew up a chair to the table,
  sitting in such a position that he could see the door, took a pencil and a
  sheet of paper and began to write rapidly.</p>

  <p>The man's knowledge was encyclopaedic. Not once did he pause or refer to a
  catalogue, and he was still writing when Crewe came in. The colonel looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"You're the man I want," he said.</p>

  <p>He handed the other three sheets of paper, closely covered with
  writing.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" asked Crewe and read:</p>

  <p>"Twenty-three iron bedsteads, twenty-three mattresses, twenty-
  three&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, what's all this, colonel?"</p>

  <p>"You can go down to Tottenham Court Road and you can order all that
  furniture to be taken into No. 3, Washburn Avenue."</p>

  <p>"Are you furnishing a children's orphanage or something?" asked the other
  in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I am furnishing a nursing home, to be exact," said the colonel slowly. "I
  bought it this morning, and I'm going to furnish it to-morrow. Send Lollie
  Marsh to me. Tell her I want her to get three women of the right sort to take
  charge of a mental case which is coming to my nursing home. By the way, you
  had better telegraph to old Boyton, or better still, go in a cab and get him.
  He'll probably be drunk but he's still on the medical register and he's the
  man I want. Take him straight away to Washburn Avenue, and don't forget that
  it's his nursing home and not mine. My name doesn't occur in this matter and
  you'd better get a dummy to do the buying for you from the furniture
  people."</p>

  <p>"Who is the mental case?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"Maisie White," snapped the colonel, and Crewe stared.</p>

  <p>"Mad?" he said incredulously. "Is Maisie mad?"</p>

  <p>"She may not be at present," said Boundary, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not finish his sentence, and Crewe, who was once a gentleman and
  was now a thief, swallowed something&mdash;but he had swallowed too much to
  choke at the threat to a girl in whom he had not the slightest
  interest.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII. THE LOVE OF STAFFORD KING</a></h2>

  <p>Maisie White had no illusions. When the report came to her that the
  detective she had employed had passed his services over to the man he was
  engaged to watch, she knew that the full force of the Boundary Gang would be
  employed to her extinction. Strangely enough, she did not appear to be
  disturbed, as she confessed to Stafford King. They were lunching together at
  the Hotel Palatine and the detective was unusually thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go out of London?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I must go on with my work," she said.</p>

  <p>"What is your work?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have told you once," she replied. "I am trying to disentangle my father
  from disgrace. I am working to put him apart when the day of reckoning
  comes."</p>

  <p>"You've not heard from him?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

  <p>"He has been a good father to me," she said, "the kindest and best of
  daddies. It is dreadful to think&mdash;" her lips quivered and she could go
  no further.</p>

  <p>Nor could Stafford King make matters any easier for her. He knew better
  than she the depth of Solomon White's commitments. If the gang ever smashed,
  and if by good fortune the law ever took its course, there was no hope for
  Solomon White's escape from his share of the responsibility.</p>

  <p>"Why do you think your father went away?" he asked, to turn the subject to
  a new aspect.</p>

  <p>She did not reply instantly.</p>

  <p>"I think he was scared," she said after a while. "I was shocked when I
  discovered how much in awe of the colonel he stood. He was just terrified at
  the threat, and yet I know he would have given his life to protect me from
  harm. I think it was just I that spurred him on to make the plans he
  did."</p>

  <p>Stafford King agreed with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Now what are we going to do about you?" he asked, half-humorously,
  half-seriously. "I cannot let you go wandering loose about London&mdash;I'm
  scared to death as it is."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"You had better lock me up," she said flippantly and he nodded in the same
  spirit.</p>

  <p>"I know a little house in St. John's Wood that would serve us beautifully
  as a prison," he said. "It has ten rooms and two admirable bathrooms. There
  is central heating and a large shady garden, and if you will only let me take
  you before a Justice of the Peace, or even a commonplace
  clergyman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That isn't prison," she said quietly and put her hand over the table.</p>

  <p>He caught it in his and held it tight.</p>

  <p>"Maisie," he said, "you know I love you. I love you more dearly than
  anything in the world."</p>

  <p>She did not speak.</p>

  <p>"As my wife," he went on, "you would be safe and I should be happy. I just
  want you all the time."</p>

  <p>Gently she disengaged her hand, shaking her head with a little smile.</p>

  <p>"What would that mean, Stafford?" she said. "You know you are deceiving me
  when you agree that my father&mdash;" again her voice shook &mdash;"no, no,"
  she said, "it would ruin your career to have the daughter of a convict for
  your wife. I realise very well what it will mean, for I know&mdash;I
  know&mdash;I know!"</p>

  <p>"What do you know?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"I know that all my work will be in vain. But I must go on with it. I
  must, or I shall go mad. I know nothing on earth can clear my father, but I'm
  not going to tell you that again. I just want to think there is a possibility
  that some miracle will happen, that all the evidence which even I have
  against him will be explained away."</p>

  <p>He took her unresisting hand in his, and under the cover of the tablecloth
  held it tight.</p>

  <p>"That is why I wanted to leave the service," he said, and she looked at
  him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Because you thought that it would mean ruin?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"No, not that. It would hurt you, that is all. Of course, if such a thing
  happened I would be obliged to resign."</p>

  <p>"And you'd never forgive yourself."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to anticipate such a happening, and, darling, you've got to face
  the future without any other illusions."</p>

  <p>She winced at the word "other" but he went on, unnoticing:</p>

  <p>"Boundary is a tiger. If he thinks there is reason to fear you, he will
  never let up on you till he has you in his grip. I tell you this," he said
  earnestly, "that for all the power of the police, for all their organisation
  and the backing which the law gives them, they may be helpless against this
  man if he has marked you down for punishment."</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"But I am," said he. "I'm so afraid, that I'm sick with apprehension
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Poor Stafford!" she said softly, and there was a look in her eyes which
  compensated him for much. "But you mustn't worry, dear. Truly, truly, you
  mustn't worry. I'm quite capable of looking after myself."</p>

  <p>"And that's the greatest of all your illusions," he said, half- laughingly
  and half-irritably. "You're just the meekest little mouse that ever came
  under the paw of a cat."</p>

  <p>She shook her head smilingly.</p>

  <p>"But I tell you I'm speaking seriously," he went on. "I'll do my best to
  look after you. I'll have a man watching you day and night."</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't," she protested. "There's no immediate cause for
  worry."</p>

  <p>He saw her to the door of the restaurant and showed her into the taxi-cab
  which came at his whistle, and she leant out of the window and waved her hand
  in farewell as she drove off.</p>

  <p>Two men stood on the opposite side of the road and watched her depart.</p>

  <p>"That's the girl," said Crewe.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">XIV. THE TAKING OF MAISIE WHITE</a></h2>

  <p>A week passed without anything exceptional happening, and Maisie White had
  ceased even to harbour doubts as to her own safety&mdash;doubts which had
  been present, in spite of the courageous showing she had made before Stafford
  King. Undeterred by her previous experience, she had made arrangements with
  another and a more responsible detective agency and had chosen a new watcher,
  though she had small hopes of obtaining results. She knew his task was one of
  almost insuperable difficulty, and she was frank in exposing to him what
  those difficulties were. Still, there was a faint chance that he might
  discover something, and moreover she had another purpose to serve.</p>

  <p>She had seen Pinto Silva once. He had called, and she had noticed with
  surprise that the debonair, self-confident man she had known, whose air of
  conscious superiority had been so annoying to her, had undergone a
  considerable change. He was ill-at-ease, almost incoherent at moments, and it
  was a long time before she could discover his business.</p>

  <p>This time she received him in her tiny sitting-room, for Pinto was somehow
  less alarming to her than he had been. Perhaps she was conscious that at the
  corner of the street stood a quietly dressed man doing nothing particular,
  who was relieved at the eighth hour by an even less obtrusive- looking
  gentleman from Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>She waited for Pinto to disclose his business, and the Portuguese was
  apparently in no hurry to do so. Presently he blurted it out.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Maisie," he said, "you've got things all wrong. Things are
  going to be very rotten for you unless&mdash;unless&mdash;" he
  floundered.</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Unless you make up with me," he said in a low voice. "I'm not so bad,
  Maisie, and I'll treat you fair. I've always been in love with
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop," she said quietly. "I dare say it is a great honour for a girl that
  any man should be in love with her, but it takes away a little of the
  compliment when the man is already married."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing," he said eagerly. "I can divorce her by the laws of my
  country. Maisie, she hates me and I hate her."</p>

  <p>"In those circumstances," she smiled, "I wonder you wait until you fall in
  love again before you get divorced. No, Mr. Silva, that story doesn't
  convince me. If you were single or divorced, or if you were ever so eligible,
  I would not marry you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he demanded truculently. "I've got money."</p>

  <p>"So have I," she said, "of a sort."</p>

  <p>"My money's as clean as yours, if it is Solomon White's money."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm well aware of that, too," she said. "It is Gang money, isn't it
  &mdash;loot money. I don't see what good I shall get out of exchanging mine
  for yours, anyway. It is just as dirty. The money doesn't come into it at
  all, Mr. Silva, it is just liking people well enough&mdash;for marriage. And
  I don't like you that way."</p>

  <p>"You don't like me at all," he growled.</p>

  <p>"You're very nearly right," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool, you're a fool!" he stormed, "you don't know what's coming
  to you. You don't know."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I do," she said. "Perhaps I can guess. But whatever is coming to
  me, as you put it, I prefer that to marrying you."</p>

  <p>He started back as though she had struck him across the face, and he
  turned livid.</p>

  <p>"You won't say that when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He checked himself and without another word left the room, and she heard
  his heavy feet blundering down the stairs.</p>

  <p>And then she met him again. It was two nights after. She met him in a
  horrible dream. She dreamt he was flying after her, that they were both
  birds, she a pigeon and he a hawk; and as she made her last desperate
  struggle to escape, she heard his hateful voice in her ear:</p>

  <p>"Maisie, Maisie, it is your last chance, your last chance!"</p>

  <p>She had gone to bed at ten o'clock that night, and it seemed that she had
  hardly fallen asleep before the vision came. She struggled to sit up in bed,
  she tried to speak, but a big hand was over her mouth.</p>

  <p>Then it was true, it was no dream. He was in the room, his hand upon her
  mouth, his voice in her ear. The room was in darkness. There was no sound
  save the sound of his heavy breathing and his voice.</p>

  <p>"They'll be up here in five minutes," he whispered. "I can save you from
  hell! I can save you, Maisie! Will you have me?"</p>

  <p>She summoned all the strength at her command to shake her head.</p>

  <p>"Then keep quiet!"</p>

  <p>There was a note of savagery in his voice which made her turn sick.</p>

  <p>For a second she filled her lungs to scream, but at that instant a mass of
  cotton-wool was thrust over her face, and she began to breathe in a sickly
  sweet vapour. Somebody else was in the room now. They were holding her feet.
  The voice in her ear said:</p>

  <p>"Breathe. Take a deep breath!"</p>

  <p>She sobbed and writhed in an agony of mind, but all the time she was
  breathing, she was drawing into her lungs the chloroform with which the wool
  was saturated.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock in the morning a uniformed constable, patrolling his beat,
  saw an ambulance drawn up outside a house in Doughty Street. He crossed the
  road to make inquiries.</p>

  <p>"A case of scarlet fever," said the driver.</p>

  <p>"You don't say," said the sympathetic constable.</p>

  <p>The door opened and two men walked out, carrying a figure in a blanket.
  The policeman stood by and saw the "patient" laid upon a stretcher and the
  back of the ambulance closed. Then he continued his walk to the corner of the
  street, where he found, huddled up in a doorway, the unconscious figure of a
  Scotland Yard detective, whose observation had been interrupted by a
  well-directed blow from a life preserver.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">XV. THE COMMISSIONER HAS A THEORY</a></h2>

  <p>"To all stations. Stop Ambulance Motor No. LKO 9943. Arrest and detain
  driver and any person found therein. Warn all garages and report.
  &mdash;COMMISSIONER."</p>

  <p>This order flashed from station to station throughout the night, and
  before the dawn, nine thousand policemen were on the look-out for the motor
  ambulance.</p>

  <p>"There's a chance, of course," said Stafford, "but it is a poor
  chance."</p>

  <p>He was looking white and heavy-eyed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir," said Southwick, his subordinate. "There's always a
  chance that a crook will do the obviously wrong thing. I suppose you've no
  theory as to where they have gone?"</p>

  <p>"Not out of town&mdash;of that I'm certain," said King, "that is why the
  quest is so hopeless. Why, they'll have got to their destination hours before
  the message went out!"</p>

  <p>They were standing in the girl's bedroom, which still reeked with
  chloroform, and all the clues were piled together on the table. There were
  not many. There was a pad of cotton-wool, a half-empty bottle of chloroform,
  bearing the label of a well-known wholesaler, and one of a pair of old
  wash-leather gloves, which had evidently been worn by somebody in his desire
  to avoid leaving finger-prints.</p>

  <p>"We've not much to go on there," said Stafford disconsolately; "the
  chloroform may have been sold years ago. Any chemist would have supplied the
  cotton-wool, and as for the glove"&mdash;he picked it up and looked at it
  carefully, then he carried it to the light.</p>

  <p>Old as it was, it was of good shape and quality, and when new had probably
  been supplied to order by a first-class glove-maker.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing here," said Stafford again, and threw the glove back on
  the table.</p>

  <p>A policeman came into the room and saluted.</p>

  <p>"I've cycled over from the Yard, sir. We have had a message asking you to
  go at once to Sir Stanley Belcom's private house."</p>

  <p>"How did Sir Stanley know about this affair?" asked Stafford
  listlessly.</p>

  <p>"He telephoned through, sir, about five o'clock this morning. He often
  makes an early inquiry."</p>

  <p>Stafford looked round. There was nothing more that he could do. He passed
  down the stairs into the street and jumped on to the motor-cycle which had
  brought him to the scene.</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley Belcom lived in Cavendish Place, and Stafford had been a
  frequent visitor to the house. Sir Stanley was a childless widower, who was
  wont to complain that he kept up his huge establishment in order to justify
  the employment of his huge staff of servants. Stafford suspected him of being
  something of a sybarite. His dinners were famous, his cellar was one of the
  best in London and because of his acquaintances and friendships in the
  artistic sets, he was something of a dabbler in the arts he patronised.</p>

  <p>The door was opened and an uncomfortable-looking butler was waiting on the
  step to receive Stafford.</p>

  <p>"You'll find Sir Stanley in the library, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>Despite his sorrow, Stafford could not help smiling at this attempt on the
  part of an English servant to offer the conventional greeting in spite of the
  hour.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we've got you up early, Perkins," he said.</p>

  <p>"Not at all, sir."</p>

  <p>The man's stout face creased in a smile.</p>

  <p>"Sir Stanley's a rare gentleman for getting up in the middle of the night
  and ordering a meal."</p>

  <p>Stafford found his grey-haired chief, arrayed in a flowered silk
  dressing-gown, balancing bread on an electric toaster.</p>

  <p>"Bad news, eh, Stafford?" he said. "Sit down and have some coffee. The
  girl is gone?"</p>

  <p>Stafford nodded.</p>

  <p>"And our unfortunate detective-constable, who was sent to watch, is
  half-way to the mortuary, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Not so bad as that, sir," said Stafford, "but he's got a pretty bad
  crack. He's recovered consciousness but remembers nothing that happened."</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very scientifically done," he said admiringly. "This, of course, is the
  work of the Boundary Gang."</p>

  <p>"I wish&mdash;" began Stafford between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Save your breath, my friend," smiled Sir Stanley; "wishing will do
  nothing. You could arrest every known member of the gang, and they'd have
  twenty alibis ready, and jolly good alibis too. It is years since the colonel
  staged an outrage of this kind and his right hand has not lost its cunning.
  Look at the organisation of it! The men get into the house without attracting
  the attention of your watcher. Then, at the exact second that the ambulance
  is due, along comes their 'cosher,' knocks down the policeman on duty. I
  don't suppose the thing took more than ten minutes. Everything was timed.
  They must have known the hour the policeman on the beat passed along the
  street."</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley poured out the coffee with his own hands, and relapsed back
  into his armchair.</p>

  <p>"Why do you think they did it?"</p>

  <p>"They were afraid of her, sir," said Stafford.</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine Boundary being afraid of a girl."</p>

  <p>"She was Solly White's daughter," said Stafford.</p>

  <p>"Even then I can't understand it," replied the chief, "unless &mdash;by
  jove! Of course."</p>

  <p>He hit his knee a smack and Stafford waited.</p>

  <p>"Probably they've got some other game on, but I'll tell you one of the
  ideas of taking that girl&mdash;it is to bring back Solomon White. He
  disappeared, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>Stafford nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's the game&mdash;to bring back Solomon White. And whatever the
  danger to himself, he'll be in London to-morrow as soon as this news is
  known."</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley sat thinking, with his chin in his hand, his forehead
  wrinkled.</p>

  <p>"There's some other reason, too. Now, what is it?"</p>

  <p>Stafford guessed, but did not say.</p>

  <p>"That girl will take some recovering before harm comes to her," said Sir
  Stanley softly, "your only hope is that friend Jack comes to your
  rescue."</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment?"</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley nodded and the other smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"That's unlikely," he said; "indeed, it is impossible. I think I might as
  well tell you my own theory as to why she was taken and why Boundary took so
  much trouble to capture her."</p>

  <p>"What is your theory?" asked Sir Stanley curiously.</p>

  <p>"My theory, sir, is that she is Jack o' Judgment," said Stafford King.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;Jack o' Judgment?"</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley was on his feet staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Impossible! It is a man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You seem to forget, sir," said Stafford, "that Miss White is a wonderful
  mimic."</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>"She wants to clear her father. She told me that only a week ago. And then
  I've been making inquiries on my own. I found that she was seen coming out of
  the Albemarle mansion, the night that Jack made his last visit to Boundary's
  flat."</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley rose.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said and left the room.</p>

  <p>Presently he came back with something in his hand.</p>

  <p>"If Miss White is Jack o' Judgment, and if she were captured to- night,
  how do you account for this? it was under my pillow when I woke up."</p>

  <p>He laid on the table the familiar Jack of Clubs.</p>
<hr>

     id="chap16">XVI. IN THE TURKISH BATHS</a></h2>

  <p>Colonel Boundary had a breakfast party of three. Though he had been up the
  whole of the night, he showed no signs of weariness. Not so Pinto or Crewe,
  who looked fagged out and all the more tired because they were both
  conspicuously unshaven.</p>

  <p>"Half the game's won," said the colonel. "We'll get rid of this girl and
  Solly White by the same stroke. I'm afraid of Solly, he knows too much. By
  the way, Raoul is coming over."</p>

  <p>"Raoul!" said Crewe, sitting up suddenly, "why, colonel, you're mad!
  Didn't the Scotland Yard man tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That he suspected a French hand in the case of 'Snow' Gregory? All the
  more reason why Raoul should come," said the colonel calmly; "he ought to
  report this morning."</p>

  <p>"You're taking a risk," growled Pinto.</p>

  <p>"Nothing unusual," replied the colonel, shelling a plover's egg. "It is
  the last thing in the world they would suspect at Scotland Yard after their
  warning, that I should bring Raoul over again. Besides, they don't know him
  anyway. He's just a harmless young French cabinet-maker. He doesn't talk and
  I will get him out of the silly habit of leaving his visiting-card."</p>

  <p>There was a silence, which Crewe broke.</p>

  <p>"You want him for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not finish the sentence.</p>

  <p>"For work," replied the colonel. "It is a thousand pities, but it would be
  a thousand times more so if you and I were jugged, and waiting in the
  condemned cell for the arrival of Mr. Ellis, the eminent hangman. Raoul's a
  workman. We can trust him. He doesn't try any funny business. He lives out of
  this country and I can cover his tracks. Besides," the colonel went on, "I
  shall give him enough to live in comfort for the next two years. Raoul is a
  grateful little beast, and thank God! he can neither read nor write."</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," said Crewe. "I hate that kind of thing. Why not give
  Solly a chance? Why not get up a fight&mdash;a duel, anything but
  cold-blooded murder?"</p>

  <p>The colonel turned his cold eyes upon the other, and his lips parted in a
  mirthless smile.</p>

  <p>"You're speaking up to your character now, aren't you, Crewe?" he said
  unpleasantly. "You're 'Gentleman Crewe' once again, eh? Want to do everything
  in the public school fashion? Well, you can cut out all that stuff and feed
  it to the pigs. I'm Dan Boundary, looking forward to a pleasant old age.
  There's nothing of the Knights of the Round Table about me."</p>

  <p>Crewe flushed.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "have it your own way."</p>

  <p>"You bet your life I'm going to have it my own way," said the colonel.
  "Have you seen the girl this morning, Pinto?"</p>

  <p>Pinto shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You'll keep away from there for a couple of days. I've got Boyton on the
  spot and he'll be feeding her with bromide till she won't care whether she's
  in hell or Wigan. Besides, we'll all be shadowed for the next day or two,
  make no mistake about that. Stafford King won't let the grass grow under his
  feet. And now, you chaps, go home and try to look as though you've had a
  night's rest."</p>

  <p>After their departure the colonel made his own preparations. There were
  Turkish baths in Westminster and it was to the Turkish baths he went. Clad in
  a towel, he passed from hot room to hot room, and finally came to the big,
  vaulted saloon, tiled from floor to roof, where in canvas-backed chairs the
  bathers doze and read. The colonel lay back in his chair, his eyes closed,
  apparently oblivious to his surroundings. Nor was it to be observed that he
  saw the thin little man who came and sat beside him. The new-comer was
  sallow-skinned and lantern-jawed, and his long arms were tattooed from
  shoulder to wrist.</p>

  <p>"Here!" said a soft voice in French.</p>

  <p>The colonel did not open his eyes. He merely dropped the palm fan which he
  was idly waving to and fro so that it hid his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember a Monsieur White?" he said in the same tone.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied the other. "He was the man who would not have your
  little 'coco' friend&mdash;disposed of."</p>

  <p>"That is the man," said the other. "You have a good memory, Raoul."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, my memory is wonderful, but alas! one cannot live on memory,"
  he added sententiously.</p>

  <p>"Then remember this: there is a place near London called Putney
  Heath."</p>

  <p>"Putney Heath," repeated the other.</p>

  <p>"There is a house called Bishopsholme."</p>

  <p>"Bishopsholme," repeated the other.</p>

  <p>"It is empty&mdash;to let, <i>a louer</i>, you understand. It is in a sad
  state of desolation. The garden, the house&mdash;you know the kind of
  place?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"At nine o'clock to-night and at nine o'clock to-morrow night you will be
  near the door. There is a large clump of bushes, behind which you will stand.
  You will stay there until ten. Between those hours M. White will approach and
  go into the house. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, monsieur," said the voice again.</p>

  <p>"You will shoot him so that he dies immediately."</p>

  <p>"He is a dead man," said the other.</p>

  <p>There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>"I will pay you sixty thousand francs, and I will have a motor-car to take
  you direct to Dover. You will catch the night boat for Ostend. Your passport
  will be in order, and you can make your way to Paris at your leisure. The
  payment you will receive in Paris. Is that satisfactory?"</p>

  <p>"Eminently so, monsieur," said the other. "I need a little for expenses
  for the moment. Also I wish information as to where the motor-car will meet
  me."</p>

  <p>"It will be waiting for you at the corner of the first road past the
  house, on the way from London. You will not speak to the chauffeur and he
  will not speak to you. In the car you will find sufficient money for your
  immediate needs. Is there any necessity to explain further?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever, monsieur," said the soft voice, and Raoul dropped his head
  on one side as though he were sleeping.</p>

  <p>As for the colonel, he did not simulate slumber, but passed into
  dreamland, sleeping quietly and calmly, with a look of benevolence upon his
  big face.</p>

  <p>The only other occupant of the cooling room, a big-framed man who was
  reading a newspaper, closed his eyes too&mdash;but he did not sleep.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">XVII. SOLOMON COMES BACK</a></h2>

  <p>At nine o'clock that night the colonel, in immaculate evening-dress, sat
  playing double-dummy bridge with his two companions. In the light of the big
  shaded lamp overhead there was something particularly peaceful and innocent
  in their occupation. No word was spoken save of the game.</p>

  <p>It was a quarter to nine, noted the colonel, looking at the little French
  clock on the mantelpiece. He rose, walked to the window and looked out. It
  was a stormy night and the wind was howling down the street, sending the rain
  in noisy splashes against the window panes. He grumbled his satisfaction and
  returned to the table.</p>

  <p>"Did you see the paper?" asked Pinto presently.</p>

  <p>"I saw the paper," said the colonel, not looking up from his hand. "I make
  a point of reading the newspapers."</p>

  <p>"You see they've made a feature of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mention no names," said the colonel. "I know they've made a feature about
  it. So much the better. Everything depends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was as he spoke that Solomon White came into the room. Boundary knew it
  was he before the door handle turned, before the hum of voices in the hall
  outside had ceased, but it was with a great pretence of surprise that he
  looked up.</p>

  <p>"Why, if it isn't Solomon White!" he said.</p>

  <p>The man was haggard and sick-looking. He had evidently dressed in a hurry,
  for his cravat was ill-tied and the collar gaped. He strode slowly up to the
  table and Boundary's manservant, with a little grin, closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been all this time, Solomon?" asked Boundary genially.
  "Sit you down and play a hand."</p>

  <p>"You know why I've come," breathed Solomon White.</p>

  <p>"Surely I know why you've come. You've come to explain where you've been,
  old boy. Sit down," said Boundary.</p>

  <p>"Where is my daughter?" asked White.</p>

  <p>"Where is your daughter?" repeated the colonel. "Well, that's a queer
  question to ask us. <i>We've</i> been saying where is Solomon White all this
  time."</p>

  <p>"I've been to Brighton," said the man, "but that's nothing to do with
  it."</p>

  <p>"Been at Brighton? A very pleasant place, too," said Boundary. "And what
  were you doing at Brighton?"</p>

  <p>"Keeping out of your way, damn you!" said White fiercely. "Trying to cure
  the fear of you which has made a rank coward of me. If you wanted to find a
  method for curing me, colonel, you've found it. I've come back for my
  daughter&mdash;where is she?"</p>

  <p>The colonel pushed his chair back from the table and looked up with a
  quizzical smile.</p>

  <p>"Now you're not going to take it hard, Solomon," he said. "We had to have
  you back and that was the only scheme we could think of. You see, there are
  lots of little bits of business that have to be cleared up, bits of business
  in which you had a hand the same as my other business associates."</p>

  <p>"Where is the girl?" asked the man steadily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to admit to you," said the colonel, with a fine show of
  frankness, "that I've put her away&mdash;no harm has come to her, you
  understand. She's at a little place at Putney Heath, a house I took specially
  for her, surrounded by loving guardians&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Like Pinto?" asked the man, looking down at the silent Silva.</p>

  <p>"Like Lollie. Now you can't deny that Lollie's a very nice girl," said the
  colonel. "Sit down, Solomon, and talk things over."</p>

  <p>"When I've got my girl I'll talk things over with you. Where is this
  place?"</p>

  <p>"It is on Putney Heath," said the colonel. "Now aren't I being
  straightforward with you? If I had any bad designs against the girl, should I
  tell you where she is? If you go there, Solomon, take some of your copper
  friends."</p>

  <p>"I have no copper friends," said the man angrily. "You know that well
  enough. What am I that I should go to the police? Can I go to them with clean
  hands?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a question I've often asked myself," said the colonel. "I've
  often said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is the name of the house?" interrupted White. "I want to see whether
  you're playing square with me, Boundary, and if you're not, by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't threaten me, don't threaten me, Solomon," said the colonel with a
  good-humoured gesture. "I'm a nervous man and I suffer from heart disease.
  You ought to know better than that. Bishopsholme is the place. It is the
  fourth big house after passing Tredennis Road&mdash;a fine villa standing in
  its own grounds. It looks a bit deserted because it was empty until a few
  days ago, when I put a scrap or two of furniture into it. Why not
  wait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"First I'll find out whether you're speaking the truth, and if you're
  not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gently, gently," growled Crewe. "What's the good of kicking up a row,
  White? The colonel's dealing straighter with you than you're dealing with
  us."</p>

  <p>He was not in the colonel's secrets, and he himself was deceived, thinking
  that the girl had been removed to the house which he now heard about for the
  first time, and that the sole object of the abduction was to bring White
  back.</p>

  <p>"Stay a while," said Boundary. "It is only just nine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But White was gone.</p>

  <p>He pushed past the servant, one of the readiest and most dangerous of the
  colonel's instruments, and into the half-dark corridor. There was a light on
  the landing below, and as he ran down the stairs he thought he saw somebody
  standing there. It looked like a woman till the figure turned, and then
  Solomon White stood stock still. It was the first time he had seen Jack o'
  Judgment. The shimmer of the black silk coat, the curious suggestion of
  pallor which the white mask conveyed, the slouch hat, throwing a black bar of
  shadow diagonally across the face, lent the figure a peculiarly sinister
  aspect.</p>

  <p>"Stand!"</p>

  <p>The voice was commanding, the glittering revolver in the figure's hand
  more so.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" gasped Solomon White.</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment! Have you ever heard of little Jack?" chuckled the
  figure. "Oh, here's a new one&mdash;Solomon White, too, and never heard of
  Jack o' Judgment! Didn't you see me when they took me out of 'Snow' Gregory's
  pocket? Little Jack o' Judgment!"</p>

  <p>Solomon White stepped back, his face twitching.</p>

  <p>"I had nothing to do with that," he said hoarsely, "nothing to do with
  that, do you hear?"</p>

  <p>"Where are you going? Won't you tell Jack something, give him a bit of
  news? Poor old Jack hears nothing these days," sighed the figure, laughter
  bubbling between the words.</p>

  <p>"I'm going on private business. Get out of my way," said the other,
  remembering the urgency of his mission.</p>

  <p>"But you'll tell Jack o' Judgment?" wheedled the figure, "you'll tell poor
  old Jack where you are going to find your beautiful daughter?"</p>

  <p>"You know!" said the man.</p>

  <p>He took a step forward, but the revolver waved him back.</p>

  <p>"You'll speak, or you don't pass," said Jack o' Judgment. "You don't pass
  until you speak; do you hear, Solomon White?"</p>

  <p>The man thought.</p>

  <p>"It is a place called Bishopsholme," he said gruffly, "on Putney Heath.
  Now let me pass."</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait!" said the figure eagerly, "wait for me&mdash;only five
  minutes! I won't keep you! But don't go, there's death there, Solomon White!
  It is waiting for you&mdash;don't you feel it in your bones?"</p>

  <p>The voice sank to a whisper, and in spite of himself, a cold shiver passed
  down White's spine. He half-turned to go back.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said the figure again eagerly, fiercely. "I shall not keep you a
  minute&mdash;a second!"</p>

  <p>Solomon White stood irresolutely, and the mask seemed to melt into the
  darkness. White strained his ears to catch the soft patter of its shoes as it
  mounted the stairs, but no sound came. Then with a start he seemed to awake
  as if from a bad dream, and without another word strode down the remaining
  stairs into the night.</p>

  <p>On the landing above, the strange being who called himself "Jack o'
  Judgment" stood outside the door of Boundary's flat. He had taken a key from
  his pocket and had it poised, when he heard the clatter of the other's feet.
  He stood undecidedly, but only for a second, then the key slipped into the
  lock and the door opened. The butler from his little pantry saw the figure
  and slammed his own door, bolting it with trembling fingers.</p>

  <p>In a second Jack o' Judgment was in the room facing the paralysed
  trio.</p>

  <p>He spoke no word, but suddenly his right arm was raised, some shining
  object flew from his hand, and there was a crash of glass and instantly a
  vile odour. On the opposite wall where the bottle had broken appeared a dark
  and irregular stain.</p>

  <p>Then, without so much as a laugh, he stepped back through the door and
  raced down the stairs in pursuit of White. It was too late; the man had
  disappeared. Jack o' Judgment stood for a moment listening, then he slipped
  off the black coat and ripped off the mask. The coat was of the finest silk,
  for he rolled it into the space of a pocket-handkerchief and slipped it in
  his pocket. The handkerchief went the same way. If there had been observers,
  they would have caught a glimpse of a man in evening dress as he went swiftly
  down the half-lighted stairway.</p>

  <p>He turned and walked in the shadow of the building and passed down a side
  street, where a big limousine was awaiting him. He gave a murmured direction
  to the driver, and the car sped on its way.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">XVIII. THE JUDGMENT OF DEATH</a></h2>

  <p>Solomon White had a taxi waiting, and gave his directions. He was
  sufficiently loyal to the band to avoid calling especial attention to the
  house where the girl was imprisoned, and he told his cab to wait at the end
  of Putney Heath. The night was wild and boisterous and very dark, but he
  carried an electric torch, and presently he came to weather-stained gates
  bearing in letters which had half-faded the name he sought. He pushed open
  the gate with some trouble. There was a curving carriage-drive which led to
  the front door, which stood at the head of a flight of steps under a square
  and ugly portico.</p>

  <p>He looked up at the building, but it was in darkness. Apparently it was
  empty, but he knew enough of the colonel's methods to know that Boundary
  would not advertise the presence of the girl to the outside world.</p>

  <p>He stood hesitating, wondering. The whole thing might be a trap, but
  Solomon White was not easily scared. He took a revolver from his pocket, drew
  back the hammer and walked forward cautiously. There was no sign of life. The
  rustling of shrubs and trees was the only mournful sound which varied the
  roar of the storm.</p>

  <p>He was opposite the door, and one foot was raised to surmount the first
  step, when there came a sound like the sharp tap of a drum.</p>

  <p>"Rap-rap!"</p>

  <p>Solomon White stood for fully a second before he crumbled and fell, and he
  was dead before he reached the ground.</p>

  <p>Still there was no sign or sound of life. A church clock boomed out the
  quarter to ten. A motor-car went past, and then the laurel bushes by the side
  of the steps moved, and a man in a black mackintosh stepped out. He bent over
  the dead man, picked up the fallen torch and flashed the light on the dead
  man's face, then, with a grunt of satisfaction, Raoul Pontarlier unscrewed
  his Soubet silencer and slipped his automatic into the wet pocket of his
  mackintosh.</p>

  <p>Feeling in an inside pocket for a cigarette, he found one and lit it from
  the smouldering end of a tinder-lighter. Then, carefully concealing the
  lighted cigarette in the palm of his hand, he walked softly and noiselessly
  down the drive, keeping to the shadow of the bushes and watching to left and
  right for signs of approaching pedestrians. At two points he could see the
  heath road, and nobody was in sight. There was plenty of time, and men had
  been ruined by haste. He reached the gate and carefully looked over. The road
  was deserted. His hand was on the gate, when something cold and hard was
  pushed against his ear and he turned round.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands!" said a mocking voice. "Put them up!"</p>

  <p>The Frenchman's hands rose slowly.</p>

  <p>"Now turn round and face the house. Quick!" said the voice.
  "<i>Marchez!</i>Halt!"</p>

  <p>Raoul stopped. If he could only get his hands down and duck, one lightning
  dive... .</p>

  <p>His captor evidently read his thoughts, for he felt a hand slip into his
  mackintosh pocket, and he was relieved of the weight of his automatic.</p>

  <p>"Go forward, up the steps. Stop!"</p>

  <p>The stranger had seen the huddled figure of White, and stooped over him.
  He made no comment. He knew the man was dead before his hands had touched
  him.</p>

  <p>"Mount the steps, <i>canaille!</i>" said the voice, and Raoul walked
  slowly up the steps of the house and halted with his face against the
  door.</p>

  <p>A hand came up under his uplifted arm and sought the keyhole. A few
  minutes' fumbling until the prongs of the skeleton key had found its
  corresponding wards, and then the door swung open, emitting a scent of
  mustiness and decay.</p>

  <p>"<i>Marchez!</i>" said the stranger, and Raoul walked forward and heard
  the door slam behind him.</p>

  <p>The house was not empty, in the sense that it was unfurnished. The unknown
  was using an electric torch of extraordinary brilliancy, and revealed a
  dilapidated hall-stand and a musty chair. He took a brief survey and
  then:</p>

  <p>"Down those stairs!" he said, and the murderer obeyed.</p>

  <p>They were in the kitchen now, and again the bright light gleamed about.
  The windows were heavily shuttered, the grate was rusty, and a few odd pieces
  of china on the sideboard were dirty. There was a gas bracket in the centre
  over a large deal table, and this the stranger turned on. He heard the hiss
  of escaping gas, struck a match and lit it, and then for the first time Raoul
  gazed in fear and astonishment upon the man who held him.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he stammered, "who are you?"</p>

  <p>The masked figure slipped his hand into his pocket and flicked a card upon
  the table, and Raoul, looking down, saw the Jack of Clubs, and knew that his
  end was near.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>For three hours the Frenchman had lain on the floor, tied hand and foot, a
  gag in his mouth, and the clocks were striking two when Jack o' Judgment came
  back. This time he wore neither mask nor coat but over his arm he carried a
  coil of fine rope. Raoul watched him, fascinated, as he walked about the
  kitchen, whistling softly to himself, and now and again breaking into scraps
  of song.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, monsieur," blubbered the terrified man, "I would make a
  confession. I will make a statement before the judge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack o' Judgment smiled.</p>

  <p>"You shall make a statement before your judge, for I am he," he said, "and
  I think this is the place."</p>

  <p>He glanced up at the high roof of the kitchen, for there was a stout hook,
  where in old times heavy sides of bacon hung. He drew the table under the
  place and put a chair on top. Then he mounted, and with a skillful cast of
  his rope caught the hook and drew the rope slowly through. He did not move
  the table or take any notice of the man on the floor, but stood as a workman
  might stand who was calculating distances, and all the time he whistled
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, monsieur, for God's sake spare me! I will make reparation!"</p>

  <p>"You speak truly," said the other without taking his eyes from the rope,
  "for it is reparation you make this night for two dead men, and God knows how
  many besides."</p>

  <p>"Two?"</p>

  <p>The murderer twisted his head.</p>

  <p>"For a man called Gregory particularly," said Jack o' Judgment, "shot down
  like a mad dog."</p>

  <p>"I was paid to do it. I knew nothing against him, I had no malice in my
  heart," said the man eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Nor have I," said Jack o' Judgment, "for behold! I shall kill you without
  passion, as a warning to all villains of all nationalities."</p>

  <p>"This is against the law," whined the man, beads of sweat standing on his
  forehead. "Give me a knife and let me fight you. You coward!"</p>

  <p>"Give Solomon White a pistol, and let him fight you," said the other. "It
  is against the law&mdash;well, I know it. But it is much more speedy than the
  law, my little cabbage!"</p>

  <p>He was busy making a slip-knot at one end of the rope, and presently he
  had finished it to his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Raoul Pontarlier," he said, "this is a moment for which I have
  waited."</p>

  <p>The man screamed and twisted his head, but the noose was about his neck
  and tightening. Then with a wrench Jack o' Judgment jerked him to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"On to the table," he said sternly. "Mount! It is quicker so!"</p>

  <p>"I will not, I will not!" yelled the Frenchman. His voice rose to a shrill
  scream. "I&mdash;help!... help!..."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Jack o' Judgment came down the dark path, stopping only
  for a second to look upon the figure of Solomon White.</p>

  <p>"God have mercy on you all!" he said soberly, and passed into the
  night.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">XIX. THE COLONEL IS SHOCKED</a></h2>

  <p>"The Putney mystery," said the <i>Daily Megaphone</i>, "surpasses any of
  recent years in its sensational character. There is a touch of the bizarre in
  this grim spectacle of the dead man at the door of the empty house, and the
  swaying figure of his murderer hanging in the kitchen, with no other mark of
  identification than a playing card pinned to his breast.</p>

  <p>"The tragedy can be reconstructed up to a point. Mr. White was evidently
  killed in the garden by the Frenchman who was found hanging. The automatic
  pistol in his pocket, which had recently been discharged, might support this
  theory even if the police had not found tracks of his feet in the laurels.
  But who hanged the man Raoul with a hangman's rope? That is the supreme
  mystery of all. The Putney police can offer no information on the subject,
  and Scotland Yard is as reticent. The circumstances of the discovery are as
  follows. At three o'clock on the morning of the 4th, Police-Constable
  Robinson, who was patrolling his beat, entered the garden, as is customary
  when houses are empty, to see if any doors had been forced. There had been an
  epidemic of burglaries in the region of Putney Heath during the past two or
  three months, and the police are exercising unusual vigilance in relation to
  these houses. The constable might not have made his inspection that night but
  for the fact that the garden gate had been left wide open... ."</p>

  <p>Here followed an account of how the body was found and how further
  investigation led the constable to the kitchen to make his second gruesome
  discovery.</p>

  <p>Colonel Boundary folded up the paper slowly and put it down. He had bought
  a copy of an early edition of the evening newspaper as he was stepping into
  his car, and now he was driving slowly through the park. He lit a cigar and
  gazed stolidly from the window. But his face showed no sign of mental
  perturbation.</p>

  <p>The car had made the circuit of the Park twice when, turning again by
  Marble Arch, he saw Crewe standing on the sidewalk. A word to his chauffeur,
  and the machine drew up.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said curtly, and the other obeyed.</p>

  <p>The hand that he lifted to take his cigarette from his lips trembled, and
  the colonel eyed him with quiet amusement.</p>

  <p>"They've got you rattled too, have they?" he said.</p>

  <p>"My God! It's awful!" said Crewe. "Awful!"</p>

  <p>"What's awful about it?" asked the colonel. "White's dead, ain't he? And
  Raoul's dead, ain't he? Two men who might talk and give a lot of
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"What did he say before he died? That's what I've been thinking. What did
  he say?"</p>

  <p>"Who? Raoul?" demanded the colonel. He had asked himself the same question
  before. "What could he say? Anyway, if he had a statement to make, and his
  statement was worth taking, why, he'd be alive to-day! Raoul was the one
  witness that they wanted, if they only knew it. They've bungled pretty badly,
  whoever they are."</p>

  <p>"This Jack o' Judgment," quavered Crewe, his mouth working. "Who is he?
  What is he?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know?" snarled the colonel. "You ask me these fool
  questions&mdash;do you expect a reply? They're dead, and that's done with.
  I'd sooner he killed Raoul than made a mess of my room, anyway!"</p>

  <p>"Why did he do it?" asked Crewe.</p>

  <p>The colonel growled something about fools and their questions, but offered
  no explanation.</p>

  <p>"It may have been a monkey trick to make us change, our quarters
  &mdash;the stuff was sulphuretted hydrogen and asafoetida. It may have been
  just bravado, but if he thinks he can scare me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He sucked viciously at his cigar end.</p>

  <p>"I've got workmen in to strip the walls and re-paper the bit that's
  soiled," he said. "I'll be back there to-night."</p>

  <p>The colonel threw the end of his cigar from the window and relapsed into
  moody reverie. When he spoke it was in a more cheerful tone.</p>

  <p>"Crewe," he said, "that guy at Scotland Yard has given me an idea."</p>

  <p>"Which guy?" asked Crewe, steadying his voice.</p>

  <p>"The First Commissioner," said the colonel, lighting another cigar. "He
  particularly wanted to know if 'Snow' had any relations. Curse 'Snow'!" he
  said between his teeth, and dropping his mask of urbanity. "I wish
  he'd&mdash;well, it doesn't matter; he's dead, anyway&mdash;he's dead."</p>

  <p>"Relations?" said Crewe. "Did you tell him anything?"</p>

  <p>"I told him all I knew, and that was very little," said the colonel, "but
  it struck me that Sir Stanley knows much more about this fellow 'Snow' than
  we do. At any rate, somebody's been making inquiries, and I guess that
  somebody is the fellow who settled Raoul."</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment?"</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment," repeated the colonel grimly. "You showed 'Snow'
  Gregory into the gang&mdash;what do you know about him?"</p>

  <p>Crewe shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Very little," he said. "I met him in Monte Carlo. He was down and out. He
  seemed a likely fellow&mdash;educated, a gentleman and all that sort of
  thing&mdash;and when I found that he'd hit the dope, I thought he'd be the
  kind of man you might want."</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"He never talked about his relations. The only thing I know was that he
  had a father or an uncle, who was in India, and I gathered that he had forged
  his name to a bill. When I arrived in Monte Carlo he was spending the money
  as fast as he could. I guess that was why he called himself Gregory, for I'm
  sure it wasn't his name."</p>

  <p>"You're sure he never spoke of a brother?"</p>

  <p>"Never," said Crewe; "he never talked about himself at all. He was
  generally under the influence of dope or was recovering from it."</p>

  <p>The colonel pushed back his hat and rubbed his forehead.</p>

  <p>"There must be some way of identifying him," he said. "He came from
  Oxford, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that," said Crewe; "he spoke of it once."</p>

  <p>"What house in Oxford? There are several colleges, aren't there?"</p>

  <p>"From Balliol," said Crewe. "I distinctly remember him talking about
  Balliol."</p>

  <p>"What year would that be?"</p>

  <p>Crewe reflected.</p>

  <p>"He left college two years before I met him at Monte Carlo," he said;
  "that would be&mdash;" He gave the year.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is pretty simple," said the colonel. "Send a man to Oxford and
  get the names of all the men that left Balliol in that year. Find out how
  many you can trace, and I dare say that will narrow the search down to two or
  three men. Now get after this at once, Crewe. Spare no expense. If it costs
  half a million I'm going to discover who Mr. Jack o' Judgment is when he's at
  home."</p>

  <p>He dismissed Crewe and gave fresh instructions to his driver, and ten
  minutes later he was stepping out of his limousine at the entrance to
  Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>Stafford King was not in, or at any rate was not available. Greatly
  daring, the colonel sent his card to the First Commissioner. Sir Stanley
  Belcom read the name and raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Show him in," he said, and for the second time the colonel was ushered
  into the presence of the chief.</p>

  <p>"Well, colonel," said Sir Stanley, "this is rather a dreadful
  business."</p>

  <p>"Terrible, terrible!" said the colonel, shaking his head. "Solomon White
  was one of my best friends. I've been searching for him for weeks."</p>

  <p>"So I've heard," said Sir Stanley dryly. "Have you any theory?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever."</p>

  <p>"What about this man called Raoul? Is he unknown to you?" asked Sir
  Stanley.</p>

  <p>"That's what I've come to see you about, sir," said the colonel in a
  confidential tone. "You remember the last time I was here, you suggested that
  possibly the murderer of poor Gregory might be a Frenchman.
  <i>You</i>remember how you told me that these French assassins have a trick
  of leaving some fantastic card or sign of their handiwork?"</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, here you have the same thing repeated," said the colonel
  triumphantly, "and the identical card. Do you think, sir, that the murderer
  of my poor friend Gregory and my poor friend White was the same man?"</p>

  <p>"In fact, Raoul?" asked Sir Stanley.</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded, and for a few moments Sir Stanley communed with his
  well-kept finger-nails.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it will do any harm if I tell you that that is my theory
  also, Colonel Boundary," he said, "and, giving confidence for confidence,
  would you have any objection to telling me whether Raoul is one of
  your&mdash;er&mdash;business associates?"</p>

  <p>There was just the slightest shade of irony in the last two words, but the
  colonel preferred to ignore it.</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad you asked me that question, sir," he said with a sigh, so
  palpably a sigh of relief that the recording angel might be excused if he
  were deceived. "I have never seen Raoul before. In fact, my knowledge of
  Frenchmen is a very small one. I do very little business in France, and I
  certainly do no business at all with men of that class."</p>

  <p>"What class?" asked the other quickly.</p>

  <p>The colonel shrugged his big shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am only going on what the newspapers say," he said. "They suggest that
  this man is an apache."</p>

  <p>"You do not know him?" asked Sir Stanley after a pause.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen him in my life," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>Again Sir Stanley examined his finger-nails as though searching for some
  flaw.</p>

  <p>"Then you will be surprised to learn," he drawled at last, "that you sat
  next to him in the cooling-room of the Yildiz Turkish Baths."</p>

  <p>The colonel's heart missed a beat, but he did not flinch.</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," he said. "I have only been to the Turkish baths once
  during the past three months, and that was yesterday."</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley nodded.</p>

  <p>"According to my information, which was supplied to me by my very able
  assistant, Mr. Stafford King, that was also the morning when Raoul was seen
  to enter that building."</p>

  <p>"And he sat next to me?" said the colonel incredulously.</p>

  <p>"He sat next to you," said Sir Stanley, with evidence of enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is the most amazing coincidence," exclaimed the colonel, "I
  have ever met with in my life! To imagine that that scoundrel sat shoulder to
  shoulder with me&mdash;good heavens! It makes me hot to think about it."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid it would," said the First Commissioner.</p>

  <p>He pressed the bell and his secretary came in.</p>

  <p>"See if Mr. Stafford King is in the building, and tell him to come to me,
  please," he said. "You see, colonel, we were hoping you would supply us with
  a great deal of very useful information. We naturally thought it was
  something more than a coincidence that this man and you should foregather at
  a Turkish bath&mdash;a most admirable rendezvous, by the way."</p>

  <p>"You may accept my word of honour," said Colonel Boundary impressively,
  "that I had no more idea of that man's presence, or of his identity, or of
  his very existence, than you had."</p>

  <p>Stafford King came in at that moment, and the colonel, noting the haggard
  face and the look of care in the dark-lined eyes, felt a certain amount of
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"I've just been telling the colonel about his meeting in the Turkish
  baths," said Sir Stanley. "I suppose there is no doubt at all as to that
  happening?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever, sir," said Stafford shortly. "Both the colonel and this
  man were seen by Sergeant Livingstone."</p>

  <p>"The colonel suggests that it was a coincidence, and that he has never
  spoken to the man," said Sir Stanley. "What do you say to that, King?"</p>

  <p>Stafford King's lips curled.</p>

  <p>"If the colonel says so, of course, it must be true."</p>

  <p>"Sarcasm never worries me," said the colonel. "I'm always getting into
  trouble, and I'm always getting out again. Give a dog a bad name
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped. There arose in his mind a mental picture of a man swinging in
  an underground kitchen, and in spite of his self-control he shuddered.</p>

  <p>"And hang him, eh?" said Sir Stanley. "Now, I'm going to put matters to
  you very plainly, colonel. There have been three or four very unpleasant
  happenings. There has been the death of the chief witness for the Crown
  against you; there has been the death of this unhappy man White, who was
  closely associated with you in your business deals, and who had recently
  broken away from you, unless our information is inaccurate; there is the
  death of Raoul, who was seen seated next to you and apparently carrying on a
  conversation behind a fan."</p>

  <p>"He never spoke a word to me," protested the colonel.</p>

  <p>"And we have the disappearance of Miss White, which is one of the most
  important of the happenings, because we have reason to believe that Miss
  White, at any rate, is still alive," said Sir Stanley, taking no notice of
  the interruption. "Now, colonel, you may or may not have the key to all these
  mysteries. You may or may not know who your mysterious friend, the Jack o'
  Judgment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's no friend of mine, by heaven!" said the colonel, and neither man
  doubted that he spoke the truth.</p>

  <p>"As I say, you may know all these things. But principally at this moment
  we are anxious to secure authentic news concerning Miss White. Both I and Mr.
  Stafford King have particular reasons for desiring information on that
  subject. Can you help us?"</p>

  <p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If by spending a hundred thousand pounds I could help you, I would do
  it," he said fervently, "but as to Miss White and where she is, I am as much
  at sea as you. Do you believe that, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Sir Stanley truthfully; "I don't."</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">XX. "SWELL" CREWE BACKS OUT</a></h2>

  <p>The colonel left Scotland Yard with a sense that he had spent the morning
  not unprofitably. It was his way to beard the lion in his den, and after all,
  the police department was no more formidable than any other public
  department. He spent the morning quietly in Pinto's flat, making certain
  preparations. The workmen were making a thorough job of his damaged wall, as
  he found when he looked in, and the horrible odour had almost disappeared. It
  was to be a much longer job than he thought. It had been necessary to cut
  away and replace the plaster under the paper for the infernal mixture had
  soaked deep. Still the colonel had plenty to occupy his mind. What he called
  his legitimate business had been sadly neglected of late. Reports had come in
  from all sorts of agencies, reports which might by careful study be turned to
  the greatest advantage. There was the affair of Lady Glenmerrin. He had been
  months accumulating evidence of that lady's marital delinquencies, and now
  the iron was ready to strike &mdash;and he simply had no interest in a deal
  which might very easily transfer the famous Glenmerrin Farms to his charge at
  a nominal figure.</p>

  <p>And there were other prospects as alluring. But for the moment the colonel
  was mainly interested in the stock value of Colonel Dan Boundary and the
  possibility of violent fluctuations. He was losing grip. The story of Jack o'
  Judgment had circulated with amazing rapidity, by all manner of underground
  channels, to people vitally concerned. Crewe, who had been a stand-by in
  almost every big coup he had pulled off, was as stable as pulp. White his
  right-hand man, was dead. Pinto&mdash;well, Pinto would go his own way just
  when it suited him. He had no doubt whatever as to Pinto's loyalty. Silva had
  big estates in Portugal, to which he would retire just when things were
  getting warm and interesting. Moreover, the British Government could not
  extradite Pinto from his native land.</p>

  <p>The colonel found himself regretting that he had missed the opportunity of
  taking up American citizenship during the seven years he had spent in San
  Francisco. And what of Crewe? Crewe was to reveal himself most unmistakably.
  He came in in the late afternoon and found the colonel working through the
  litter on his desk.</p>

  <p>"Have you started your search at Oxford?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"I've sent two men down there&mdash;the best men in London," replied
  Crewe.</p>

  <p>He drew up a chair to the desk and flung his hat on a near-by couch.</p>

  <p>"I want to have a little talk with you, colonel."</p>

  <p>Boundary looked up sharply.</p>

  <p>"That sounds bad," he said. "What do you want to talk about? The
  weather?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly," said Crewe. A little pause, and then: "Colonel, I'm going to
  quit."</p>

  <p>The colonel made no reply. He went on writing his letter, and not until he
  reached the end of the page and carefully blotted the epistle did he meet
  Crewe's eyes.</p>

  <p>"So you're going to quit, are you?" said Boundary. "Cold feet?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that," said Crewe. "Of course, I'm not going to leave you
  in the lurch."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said the colonel with elaborate politeness, "nobody's going to
  leave me in the lurch. You're just going to quit, that's all, and I've got to
  face the music."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you quit too, colonel?"</p>

  <p>"Quit what?" asked Boundary. "And how? You might as well ask a tree to
  quit the earth, to uproot itself and go on living. What happens when I walk
  out of this office and take a first-class state-room to New York? You think
  the Boundary Gang collapses, fades away, just dies off, eh? The moment I
  leave there's a squeal, and that squeal will be loud enough to reach me in
  whatever part of the world I may be. There are a dozen handy little
  combinations which will think that I am double-crossing them, and they'll be
  falling over one another to get in with the first tale."</p>

  <p>Crewe licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Well that certainly may be in your case, colonel, but it doesn't happen
  to be in mine. I've covered all my tracks so that there's no evidence against
  me."</p>

  <p>"That's true," said the colonel. "You've just managed to keep out of
  taking an important part. I congratulate you."</p>

  <p>"There's no sense in getting riled about it," said Crewe; "it has just
  been my luck, that's all. Well, I want to take advantage of this luck."</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"I'm out of any bad trouble. The police, if they search for a million
  years, couldn't get a scrap of evidence to convict me," he said, "even if
  they'd had you when Hanson betrayed you, they couldn't have convicted
  me."</p>

  <p>"That's true," said the colonel again. He shook his head impatiently.
  "Well, what does all this lead to, Crewe? Do you want to be demobilised?" he
  asked humorously.</p>

  <p>"That's about the size of it," said Crewe. "I don't want to be in anything
  fresh, and I certainly don't want to be in this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"In this Maisie White business," said Crewe doggedly. "Let Pinto do his
  own dirty work."</p>

  <p>"My dirty work too," said the colonel. "But I reckon you've overlooked one
  important fact."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" demanded Crewe suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"You've overlooked a young gentleman called Jack o' Judgment," said the
  colonel, and enjoyed the look of consternation which came to the other's
  face. "There's a fellow that doesn't want any evidence. He hanged Raoul all
  right."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he did it?" said Crewe in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>"Do I think he did it?" The colonel smiled. "Why, who else? And when he
  comes to judge you, I guess he's not going to worry very much about
  affidavits and sworn statements, and he's not going to take you before a
  magistrate before he hands you over to the coroner."</p>

  <p>Crewe jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What have I done?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"What have you done? Well, you know that best," said the colonel with a
  wave of his hand. "You say the police haven't got you and haven't a case
  against you. Maybe you're right. That Greek was saying the same sort of thing
  to me. He was here this afternoon squealing about taking the girl to the
  Argentine, and wanted us to send the doctor, and he'll be waiting to meet us
  when we land. There's no evidence against him either. Maybe there's more
  evidence than you imagine. I wouldn't bank too much upon the police passing
  you by, if I were you, Crewe. There's something about Mr. Stafford King that
  I don't like. He's got more brains in his little finger than that dude
  commissioner has in the whole of his body. He doesn't say much, but I guess
  he thinks a lot, and I'd give something to know what he's thinking about me
  just now."</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">XXI. THE BRIDE OF DEATH</a></h2>

  <p>Time had long ceased to have any significance for Maisie White. There was
  daylight and nightlight. She seemed to remember that she had made a great
  fight on the day she arrived at this strange house when the hard-faced nurses
  had strapped her to the bed, and an old man, with trembling fingers, had
  pushed a needle into her arm. She remembered it hurt, and then she remembered
  very little else. She viewed life with a dull apathy and without much
  understanding. She ceased to resent the presence of the women who came and
  went, and even the uncleanly old doctor no longer filled her with a sense of
  revulsion. She just wanted to be left alone to sleep, to dream the strangest
  dreams that any girl had ever had. She did not know that this was the action
  of bromide of potassium, consistently administered in every drink she took,
  in every morsel of food she ate. Bromide in bread, in coffee, in mashed
  potatoes, in rice, in all the vehicles by which the drug could be
  administered.</p>

  <p>Sometimes by reason of her sheer vitality she flung off the effects of the
  dope, and was keenly conscious of her surroundings. There was one girl who
  came and went, a pretty girl with fluffy golden hair, who looked at her
  dispassionately and made no reply to the questions with which Maisie plied
  her. And once she had seen Pinto and would have screamed, but they stopped
  her in time. One night the old doctor had come into the room very drunk. He
  was crying and moaning in a maudlin fashion about some mysterious position
  which he had lost, and he had sat on the bed and, cursed his passion for
  strong drink with such vehemence that she, in her half-dazed state of mind,
  had found herself interested against her will.</p>

  <p>In one of her lucid intervals she had realised a vital fact, that she was
  under the influence of a drug, and instinctively knew that she was becoming
  more and more immune to its action. She formed a vague plan, which she had
  almost forgotten the next morning. She must always be sleepy, almost dazed;
  she must never show signs of returning consciousness. She had been a week in
  the "nursing home" before she made this plan. She could lie now with her eyes
  shut, picking up the threads. She heard somebody talk of a ship and of a
  passport, and learned that she was to be removed in another week. She could
  not find where, but it was somewhere on a ship. She tried once, when the
  nurses were out of the room, to get out of bed and walk to the window. Her
  legs gave way beneath her, and it was with the greatest difficulty that she
  managed to crawl back to bed.</p>

  <p>There was no escape that way. There was no help either from the nurses who
  were not nurses at all, nor from the maudlin little doctor, nor from the
  pretty girl who came sometimes and looked down on her with undisguised
  contempt&mdash;or was it pity? Then one night she woke in a fright. Two
  people were talking. She half turned her head and saw that Pinto was in the
  room, and his face was a flaming fury. She had seen that look before, but now
  his rage was directed at somebody else, and with a start she recognised the
  pretty girl that the nurses called Lollie.</p>

  <p>"You're not in this, Lollie," said the man, and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"That's just where you're wrong, Silva," she replied. "I'm very much in
  it. What happens to this girl when she leaves here heaven only knows &mdash;I
  guess it's up to the colonel. But while she's here I'm looking after
  her."</p>

  <p>"You are, are you?" he said between his teeth. "Well, now you can go and
  take a walk."</p>

  <p>"I can also take a seat too," she said.</p>

  <p>He walked over to her and glowered down at the girl, and she puffed a
  cloud of cigarette smoke in his face.</p>

  <p>"I'm a crook because it pays me to be a crook," said the girl calmly. "If
  it's jollying along one of the colonel's blue-eyed innocents, or keeping a
  watchful eye upon Mr. King, or acting trustful maiden to some poor fool from
  the country&mdash;why, I'm ready and willing, because that's my job. But this
  is a different matter altogether. If the colonel says she's got to go abroad,
  why, I suppose she's got to go. But she's not going to be on my conscience,
  that's all," said Lollie.</p>

  <p>They passed through the door into a smaller room where the night watchers
  sat. She made as though to sit at the table when he gripped her arm and swung
  her round. She put up her hands to defend herself, but was thrown against the
  wall, and his grip was on her throat.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I'll do for you?" he hissed.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what you do," she said. She was on the verge of tears.
  "You're not going into that room&mdash;you're <i>not</i> going!"</p>

  <p>She sprang at him, but with a snarl like a wild beast, he turned and
  struck her, and she fell against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Now get out"&mdash;he pointed to the door&mdash;"get out and don't show
  your face here again. And if you've got any information, you can report it to
  the colonel and see what he's got to say to you!"</p>

  <p>She slunk from the room. Pinto went back to the room where the girl
  lay.</p>

  <p>"Cover your head with a blanket, my pretty?" he said. "Pinto must not see
  that pretty face, eh?"</p>

  <p>He laid hold of the blanket's edge and pulled it gently down. But the
  blanket would not come away. It was being clutched tightly. With a jerk he
  wrenched it down, then stumbled backwards to the floor, a grotesque and
  ludicrous figure, for the white silk mask of Jack o' Judgment confronted him
  and the hateful voice of his enemy shrilled:</p>

  <p>"I'm Death! Jack o' Judgment! Poor old Jack! Jack, the hangman! You'll
  meet him one day, Pinto&mdash;meet him now!"</p>

  <p>Pinto collapsed&mdash;he had fainted.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap22"
     id="chap22">XXII. MAISIE TELLS HER STORY</a></h2>

  <p>"There is one fact which I would impress upon you," said Sir Stanley
  Belcom, addressing the heads of his departments at the early morning
  conference at Scotland Yard, "and it is this, that the criminal has nine
  chances against the one which the law possesses. He has the initiative in the
  first place, and if he fails to evade detection, the law gives him certain
  opportunities of defence and imposes certain restrictions which prevent one
  taking a line which would bring the truth of his assertions or denials to
  light. It protects him; it will not admit evidence against him; it will not
  allow the jury to be influenced by the record of his previous crimes until
  they have delivered their verdict upon the one on which he stands charged; in
  fact, gentlemen, the criminal, if he were intelligent, would score all the
  time."</p>

  <p>"That's true enough, sir," said Cole, of the Record Office. "I've never
  yet met a criminal who wasn't a fool."</p>

  <p>"And you never will till you meet Colonel Boundary," said Sir Stanley with
  a good-natured smile, "and the reason you do not meet him is because he is
  not a fool. But, gentlemen, every criminal has one weak spot, and sooner or
  later he exposes the chink in his armour to the sword of justice&mdash;if you
  do not mind so theatrical an illustration. Here, again, I do not think that
  Boundary will make any such exposure. One of you gentlemen has again brought
  up the question as to the prosecution of the Boundary Gang, and particularly
  the colonel himself. Well, I am all in favour of it, though I doubt whether
  the Home Secretary or the Public Prosecutor would agree with my point of
  view. We have a great deal of evidence, but not sufficient evidence to
  convict. We know this man is a blackmailer and that he engages in terrorising
  his unfortunate victims, but the mere fact that we know is not sufficient. We
  need the evidence, and that evidence we have not got. And that is where our
  mysterious Jack o' Judgment is going to score. He knows, and it is sufficient
  for him that he <i>does</i> know. He calls for no corroborative evidence, but
  convicts and executes his judgment without recourse to the law books. I do
  not think that the official police will ever capture Boundary, and if it is
  left to them, he will die sanctified by old age and ten years of comfortable
  repentance. He will probably end his life in a cathedral town, and may indeed
  become a member of the town council&mdash;hullo, King, what is the
  matter?"</p>

  <p>Stafford King had rushed in. He was dusty and hot of face, and there was a
  light of excitement in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"She's found, sir, she's found!"</p>

  <p>"She's found?" Sir Stanley frowned. "To whom are you referring? Miss
  White?"</p>

  <p>Stafford could only nod.</p>

  <p>With a gesture the commissioner dismissed the conference. Then:</p>

  <p>"Where was she found?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In her own flat, sir. That is the amazing thing about it."</p>

  <p>"What! Did she come back herself?"</p>

  <p>Stafford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is an astonishing story, sir. She was, of course, detained and held
  prisoner somewhere, and last night&mdash;she will not give me any
  details&mdash;she was carried from the house where she had been kept
  prisoner. She had an awful experience, at which she only hints, poor girl!
  Apparently she fainted, and when she came to she was in a motor-car being
  carried along rapidly. And that is about all she'll tell me."</p>

  <p>"But who brought her away?" asked the commissioner.</p>

  <p>Again Stafford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"For some reason or other she is reticent and will give no information at
  all. It is evident she has been drugged, for she looks wretchedly
  ill&mdash;of course, I haven't pressed her for particulars."</p>

  <p>"It is a strange story," said the commissioner.</p>

  <p>"I have a feeling," Stafford went on, "that she has given a promise to her
  unknown rescuer that she will not tell more than is necessary."</p>

  <p>"But it is necessary to tell the police," said the commissioner, "and even
  more important for the young lady to tell her&mdash;fiance, I hope,
  King?"</p>

  <p>The young man reddened and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I agree with you that this is not the moment when you can cross- examine
  the girl, but I want you to see her as soon as you possibly can and try to
  induce her to tell you all she knows."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Maisie White lay on the sofa in her own room. She was still weak, but oh!
  the relief of being back again and of ending that terrible nightmare which
  had oppressed her for&mdash;how long? Even the depressing effect of the drug
  could not quench the exaltation of finding herself free. She went over the
  details of the night one by one. She must do it, she thought. She must never
  lose grip of what happened or forget her promise.</p>

  <p>First she recalled seeing the weird figure of Jack o' Judgment. He had
  lifted her from the bed and had laid her on the floor. She remembered seeing
  him slip beneath the blankets, and then Pinto had come. She recalled the
  cracked voice of her rescuer, his fantastic language.</p>

  <p>She had awakened to consciousness to find herself in a big car which was
  passing quickly through the dark and deserted streets. She had no
  recollection of being carried from the room or of being handed to the
  thick-set man who stood on a ladder outside the open window. All she recalled
  was her waking to consciousness and seeing in the half-light the gleam of a
  white silk handkerchief.</p>

  <p>She was too dazed to be terrified, and the soft voice which spoke into her
  ear quelled any inclinations she might have had to struggle. For the man was
  holding her in his arms as tenderly as a brother might hold a sister, or a
  father a child.</p>

  <p>"You're safe, Miss White," said the voice. "Do you understand? Are you
  awake?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"You know what I have saved you from?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want you to do something for me now. Will you?" She nodded again. "Are
  you sure you understand?" said the voice anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," she replied.</p>

  <p>She could have almost smiled at his consideration.</p>

  <p>"I am taking you to your home, and to-morrow your friends will know that
  you have returned. But you're not to tell them about the house where they
  have kept you. You must not tell them about Silva or anybody that was in that
  house. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"But why?" she began, and he laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I am not trying to shield them," he said, answering her unspoken thought,
  "but if you give information you can only tell a little, and the police can
  only discover a little, and the men can only be punished a little. And
  there's so much that they deserve, so many lives they have ruined, so much
  sorrow they have caused, that it would be a hideous injustice if they were
  only punished&mdash;a little. Will you leave them to me?"</p>

  <p>She struggled to an erect position and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"I know you," she whispered fearlessly; "you are Jack o' Judgment."</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment!" he laughed a little bitterly. "Yes, I am Jack o'
  Judgment."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A living lie," he replied bitterly, "a masquerader, a mummer, a
  nobody."</p>

  <p>She did not know what impelled her to do the thing, but she put out her
  hand and laid it on his. She felt the silky smoothness of the glove and then
  his other hand covered hers.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said simply. "Do you think you can walk? We are just
  turning into Doughty Street. We've passed the policeman on his beat; he is
  going the other way. Can you walk upstairs by yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'll try," she said, but when he assisted her from the car she
  nearly fell, and he half carried, half supported her into her room.</p>

  <p>He stood hesitating near the door.</p>

  <p>"I shall be all right," she smiled. "How quickly you understand my
  thoughts!"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be well if I sent somebody to you&mdash;a nurse? Have you the
  key I gave you?"</p>

  <p>"How did you get it?" she asked suddenly, and he laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment," he mocked, "wise old Jack o' Judgment! He has
  everything and nothing! Suppose I send a nurse to you, a nice nurse. I could
  send the key to her by messenger. Would you like that?"</p>

  <p>She looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"I think I would," she said with a weak smile. "I am not quite sure of
  myself."</p>

  <p>He did not take off the soft felt hat which was drawn tightly over his
  ears, nor did he remove his mask or cloak. She was making up her mind to take
  a closer stock of him, when unexpectedly he backed towards the door, and with
  a little nod was gone. He had left her on the couch, and there she was, half
  dozing and half drugged when the matronly nurse from St. George's Institute
  arrived half an hour later.</p>

  <p>Stafford called in the afternoon and was surprised and delighted to learn
  that he could speak to the girl. He found her looking better and more
  cheerful. He bent over and kissed her cheek, and her hand sought his.</p>

  <p>"Now, I'm going to be awfully official," he laughed, "I want you to tell
  me all sorts of things. The chief is very anxious that we should lose no time
  in getting your story."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There's no story to tell, Stafford," she said.</p>

  <p>"No story to tell?" he said incredulously. "But weren't you abducted?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"There's that much you know," she said; "I was abducted and taken away. I
  have been detained and I think drugged."</p>

  <p>"No harm has come to you?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>Again she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"But where did they take you? Who was it? Who were the people?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you," she said.</p>

  <p>"You don't know?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I know, but I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>"But why?" he asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Because the man who rescued me begged me not to tell, and, Stafford, you
  don't know what he saved me from."</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he&mdash;who was it?" asked Stafford.</p>

  <p>"The man called Jack o' Judgment," said the girl slowly, and Stafford
  jumped up with a cry.</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment!" he said. "I ought to have guessed! Did you see his
  face?" he demanded eagerly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"Did he give you any clue as to his identity?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," she replied with a little gleam of amusement in her eyes.
  "What a detective you are, Stafford! And I thought you were coming down here
  to tell me"&mdash;the colour went to her cheeks&mdash;"well, to tell me the
  news," she added hastily. "Is there any news?"</p>

  <p>"None, except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he remembered that she knew nothing whatever of her father's death
  and its tragic sequel, and this was not the moment to tell her. Later, when
  she was stronger, perhaps.</p>

  <p>She was watching him with trouble in her eyes. She had noted how quickly
  he had stopped and guessed that there was something to be told which he was
  withholding for fear of hurting her. Her father was uppermost in her mind and
  it was natural that she should think of him.</p>

  <p>"Is there any news of my father?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"None," he lied.</p>

  <p>"You're not speaking the truth, Stafford." She put her hand on his arm.
  "Stafford, is there any news of my father?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her, and she saw the pain in his face.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you wait a little while, and I'll tell you all the news," he
  said with an assumption of gaiety. "There have been several fashionable
  weddings&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please tell me," she said, "Stafford. I've been for weeks under the
  influence of a drug, and somehow it has numbed pain, even mental pain, and
  perhaps you will never find me in a better condition to hear&mdash;the
  worst."</p>

  <p>"The worst has happened, Maisie," he said gently.</p>

  <p>"He has been arrested?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, dear, worse than that."</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;not suicide?" she said between her set teeth.</p>

  <p>Again he shook his head. "He is dead," he said softly.</p>

  <p>"Dead!"</p>

  <p>There was a long silence which he did not break.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" she said again. "How?"</p>

  <p>"He was shot by&mdash;we think it was by a member of the Boundary Gang, a
  man named Raoul."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"I have never heard my father speak of him."</p>

  <p>"He was a man imported from France, according to our theory."</p>

  <p>"And was he captured?"</p>

  <p>"He was killed too," said Stafford; "he was caught in the act and
  instantly executed."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"By Jack o' Judgment," replied Stafford.</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment!" She breathed the words. "And I&mdash;I never thanked
  him! I never knew!"</p>

  <p>He told her the story step by step of the discovery which the police had
  made and the theories they had formed.</p>

  <p>"He was lured there," said the girl.</p>

  <p>She did not cry. She seemed incapable of tears.</p>

  <p>"He was lured there and murdered, and Jack o' Judgment slew his murderer?
  Poor father! Poor, dear daddy!"</p>

  <p>And then the tears came.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later he left her in charge of the nurse and went back to
  Scotland Yard to report.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap23"
     id="chap23">XXIII. THE GANG FUND</a></h2>

  <p>The news of the girl's escape had been received in another quarter.
  Colonel Boundary had sat in his favourite chair and listened without comment
  to Pinto's halting explanation.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they went out of the window and down a ladder, did they?" said the
  colonel sarcastically when the Portuguese had finished, "and you had a fit on
  the mat, I suppose? Well, that's a hell of a fine story! And what did you do?
  You who were plastered all over with guns? Couldn't you shoot?"</p>

  <p>"Did you shoot when you saw Jack o' Judgment?" said the other sullenly.
  "It is no good your telling me what I ought to do."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it isn't," said the colonel. "Well, there's nothing to do now,
  anyway. The girl's gone, and all your fine plans have come unstuck."</p>

  <p>"They weren't my plans," said Pinto indignantly, "it was your scheme
  throughout."</p>

  <p>The colonel bit off the end of his cigar and contemplated the ceiling
  reflectively.</p>

  <p>"We can only wait and see what will happen," he said. "The odds are all in
  favour of our being raided."</p>

  <p>Pinto went pale.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the colonel, talking to himself, "I guess this is our last day
  of freedom. Well, Pinto, I hope you can pick oakum."</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up about oakum," growled the other; "it isn't a joke."</p>

  <p>"It is not a joke," said the colonel, "and if it is, it is one of those
  jokes that make people laugh the most. And do you know the kind of joke that
  makes people laugh the most, Pinto? It is when somebody gets hurt; and we are
  the people who are going to get hurt."</p>

  <p>"Do you think she'll tell the police?"</p>

  <p>"It is extremely likely," said the colonel; "in fact, it is extremely
  unlikely that she won't tell the police. I am rather glad I'm out of it."</p>

  <p>Pinto leaped up.</p>

  <p>"You're out of it!" he shouted. "You're in it up to the neck!"</p>

  <p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm absolutely out of it, Pinto," he said, flicking the ash of his cigar
  into the fireplace. "I cannot be identified with this unhappy affair by so
  much as a finger-print."</p>

  <p>The Portuguese scowled down at him.</p>

  <p>"So that's the game, is it? You're going to double-cross us? You're going
  to be out of it and we're going to be in it."</p>

  <p>"Sit down, you fool. Double-cross you! You are easily scared at a little
  leg-pulling. I'm merely pointing out that it is not a matter in which I am
  greatly interested. It is a good thing for you I'm not. Who are the police
  after? You and Crewe and the rest of the gang? Not on your life! They're
  after me. They get the trunk and all the branches come down with it. Do you
  see? There's no sense in lopping off a few branches even of deadwood. It
  won't be good enough if they connect you with the case, unless they connect
  me too. They're after the big horns, they're not shooting the little bucks.
  If she tells the police, they're going to nose around for two or three days,
  seeing how far they can connect me with it. And if there's any
  connection&mdash;the slightest, Pinto&mdash;why, they'll pinch you without a
  doubt, but they'll pinch me too."</p>

  <p>The colonel blew a blue ring of smoke into the air and watched it float to
  the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"The advantage of having a business associate like me is that I'm a sort
  of insurance to you little crooks. I am the big fish they're trying to hook,
  and their bait isn't the kind of bait that you'd swallow."</p>

  <p>"I've burnt all the papers I had," explained Pinto, "and covered my
  trail."</p>

  <p>"When you burnt your boats and came in with me," said the colonel, "you
  burnt everything that was worth burning. I tell you it isn't you they're
  trailing. It is me or nothing. Maybe they'll scare you," he said
  reflectively, "hoping you'll turn King's evidence. I've got a feeling that
  you won't&mdash;if I had a feeling the other way about, Pinto, you wouldn't
  see the curtain rise at the Orpheum to-night. And now," said the colonel,
  "we'll go out."</p>

  <p>He rose abruptly, walked into his bedroom, and came out wearing his broad
  felt hat. He found Pinto biting his finger-nails nervously and looking out of
  the window.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go out," said Pinto.</p>

  <p>"Come out," said the colonel. "What's the good of staying here, anyway?
  Besides, if they are going to pinch you, I don't want them to pinch you in my
  rooms. It would look bad."</p>

  <p>They walked downstairs into the street, and a few minutes later were
  strolling across the Green Park, the colonel a picture of a contented
  bourgeoisie with his half-smoked cigar, and his hands clasped together under
  the tails of his alpaca coat.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how you can say they've no evidence against you. Suppose
  Crotin squeals?"</p>

  <p>"He ain't stopped squealing yet," said the colonel philosophically, "but I
  don't see what difference it makes. Pinto, you haven't got the hang of my
  methods, and I doubt if you ever will. You're a clever, useful fellow, but if
  you were allowed to run the gang, you'd have it in gaol in a month. Take
  Crotin," he said. "I dare say he's feeling sore, and maybe this damned Jack
  o' Judgment person is standing behind him telling him&mdash;" He stopped.
  "No, he wouldn't either," he said after a moment's thought, "Jack o' Judgment
  knows as much about it as I do."</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?" asked the other impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Crotin," said the colonel; "he hasn't any evidence against me. You see, I
  do not do any business by letters. You fellows have often wanted me to write
  to this person and that, but writing is evidence. Do you get me? And what
  evidence has Crotin? Absolutely none. I have never written a line to him in
  my life. Crewe brought him down to the flat. We gave him a dinner and put the
  proposal to him in plain language. There's nothing he could take before a
  judge and jury&mdash;absolutely nothing."</p>

  <p>He took the cigar from his mouth and blew a cloud of smoke.</p>

  <p>"That's the way I've built the business up&mdash;no letters, no documents,
  nothing that a lawyer can make head or tail of."</p>

  <p>"What about the documents that Hanson talked about?"</p>

  <p>The colonel frowned and then laughed.</p>

  <p>"They're nothing but records of our transactions, and they're not
  evidence. Why, even the police have given up the search for them. By the way,
  I haven't done with Crotin," he said after a while.</p>

  <p>"He's done with you, I should think," said Pinto grimly.</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"I guess so, but he hasn't done with the gang. You can take him on
  next."</p>

  <p>"I?" said Pinto in affright. "Now look here, colonel, don't you think it's
  time we laid low&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Laid low!" said the colonel scornfully. "We're either going to get into
  trouble or we're not. If we're not going to get into trouble, we might as
  well go on. Besides, we want the money. The business has slackened off, and
  we haven't had a deal since the Spillsbury affair, and that won't last very
  long. We've got to split our loot six ways, Pinto, and that leaves very
  little for anybody."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going now?" asked the other, as the colonel changed his
  direction.</p>

  <p>"It just struck me that we might as well go over to the bank and see how
  our balance stands. Also, with the exchange going against us, I want to tell
  Ferguson to buy dollars."</p>

  <p>The handsome premises of the Victoria and City Bank in Victoria Street
  were only a stone's throw from the park; and, whatever might be the views of
  Ferguson, the manager, as to the colonel's moral character, he had a
  considerable respect for him as a financier, and Dan Boundary was shown
  immediately into the manager's office.</p>

  <p>He was gone some time, whilst Pinto waited impatiently outside. The
  colonel never invited other members, even of the inmost council, to share his
  knowledge of finances. They all knew roughly the condition of the exchequer,
  but really the balance at the Victoria and City was the colonel's own. It was
  the practice of the Boundary Gang (as was subsequently revealed) to share,
  after each coup, every man taking that to which he was entitled. The money
  was split between five, the sixth share going to what was known as the Gang
  Account, a common fund upon which all could draw in moments of necessity.</p>

  <p>The Gang Fund was not so described in the books of the bank. It was known
  as "Account B." The expenses of operations were usually paid out of the
  colonel's private account, and credited to him when the share-out came. He
  was absolute master of his own balance, but it required three signatures to
  extract a cheque from Account B. One of the objects of the colonel's visit
  was to reduce this number to two, the death of Solomon White having removed
  one of the signatories.</p>

  <p>He returned to Pinto, apparently not too well satisfied.</p>

  <p>"There's quite a lot of money in the Gang Account," he said. "I've struck
  off Solly's name, and your signature and mine, or mine and Crewe's, is
  sufficient now."</p>

  <p>"Or mine and Crewe's, I suppose?" suggested Pinto, and the colonel
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said he. "I'm not a great believer in the indispensability of
  any man, but I'm making the signature of Dan Boundary indispensable before
  that account is touched."</p>

  <p>They walked back through the park, and the colonel expounded his
  philosophy of wrong living.</p>

  <p>"The man who runs an honest business and mixes it with a little crooked
  work is bound to be caught," he said, "because his mind is concentrated on
  the unpaying side of the game. You've got to run a crook business in an
  honest way if you want to escape the law and pay big dividends. They call our
  system blackmail, but it ain't. A blackmailer asks for something for nothing,
  and he's bound to get caught sooner or later. We offer spot cash for all the
  things we steal, and that baffles the law. And we're not the only people in
  London, or in England, or in the world, who are pulling bargains by scaring
  the fellow we buy from. It is done every day in the City of London; it is
  done every day by the trusts that control the little shops in the suburbs; it
  is done even by the big proprietary companies that tell a miserable little
  tradesman that, if he doesn't stop selling one article, they won't supply him
  with theirs. Living, Pinto, is preying. The only mistake a crook ever makes
  is when he goes outside of his legitimate business and lets some other
  consideration than the piling up of money influence him."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean?" asked Pinto wearily. He hated the colonel when he was
  in this communicative mood of his.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the colonel slowly, "I shouldn't have been so keen to go
  after Maisie White if it hadn't been that you were fond of her and wanted
  her. That's what I call letting love interfere with business."</p>

  <p>"But you said you were afraid of her blabbing. You don't put it on to me,"
  said the indignant Pinto.</p>

  <p>"I was and I wasn't," said the colonel. "I think I almost persuaded myself
  that the girl was a danger. Of course, she isn't. Even Solomon White wasn't a
  danger."</p>

  <p>He stopped dead, and, speaking slowly and pointing his words with a huge
  forefinger on the other's chest, he said:</p>

  <p>"Bear this fact in mind, Pinto, that I have no malice against Miss White,
  and I don't think that she can harm me. As far as I'm concerned, I will never
  hurt a hair of her head or do her the slightest harm. I believe that she has
  nothing against me, and I give orders to anybody who's connected with
  me&mdash;in fact, to all of my business associates &mdash;that that girl is
  not to be interfered with."</p>

  <p>Slowly, emphatically, every word emphasised, the colonel spoke, but Pinto
  did not smile. He had seen the colonel in this gentle mood before, and he
  knew that Maisie White was doomed.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap24"
     id="chap24">XXIV. PINTO GOES NORTH</a></h2>

  <p>Had Pinto been a psychologist, which he was not, he might have been struck
  by the unusual reference on the part of the colonel to the funds of the gang.
  It was a subject to which the colonel very seldom referred, and it was
  certainly one which he did not emphasise. The truth was that the colonel's
  investigations into his own private affairs had not been as satisfactory as
  he had hoped would be the case.</p>

  <p>He was in the habit of advancing money, and the gang owed him a
  considerable sum, money which had been advanced for the pursuit of various
  enterprises. To draw that money would leave the Gang Fund sadly depleted, and
  he could not afford to draw upon it at a moment when they were all on edge.
  Not only were the two principal subordinates in the condition of mind which
  led them to jump at every knock and start at every shadow, but he had been
  receiving urgent messages from all parts of the country from the other men,
  and he had determined upon a step which he had not taken for three
  years&mdash;a meeting of the full "Board" of his lawless organisation.</p>

  <p>That night summonses went forth calling his "business associates" to an
  Extraordinary General Meeting of the North European Smelter Syndicate. This
  was one of the companies which he operated, and the existence of which was
  justified by a small smelting works in the North of England, and owed its
  international character to the fact that it had branch works in Sweden. Its
  turnover was small, its list of stockholders was select. A summons to a
  General Meeting of the North European Smelter Company meant that the affairs
  of the gang were critical, and in this spirit the call was obeyed.</p>

  <p>The meeting was held in the banquet hall of a West End restaurant, and the
  twenty men who assembled differed very little in appearance from twenty other
  provincial business men who might have been gathered to discuss the affairs
  of any company.</p>

  <p>Their coming excited no comment, and apparently did not even arouse the
  attention of vigilant Scotland Yard. Nor, had the colonel's speech been taken
  down by a shorthand writer and submitted to the police, could any suggestion
  be found of the significance of the meeting. He spoke of the difficulties of
  trading, of the "competition" with which the company was faced, and called
  upon all the shareholders to assist loyally the executive in a very critical
  and trying time. But those who listened knew very well that the "competition"
  was the competition of the police, and they had their own ideas as to what
  constituted the trying time to which the colonel made reference.</p>

  <p>It was a very commonplace, ordinary company meeting, which ended in a
  conventional way by a vote of confidence in the directors. It was when that
  had been passed, and the meeting had been broken up, and members and
  officials were talking together, that the real business started.</p>

  <p>Then it was that Selby, the stout little man whose special job was to act
  as intermediary between the company and its more criminal enterprises,
  received his instructions to speed up. Selby was the receiver of letters. A
  burglar or a pickpocket who acquired in the course of his activities
  documents and letters which had hitherto been worthless found a ready market
  through Selby. Eighty letters out of every hundred were absolutely valueless,
  but occasionally they would find a rich gem, a love letter discreetly
  cherished, on which a new "operation" would be based. Then would begin the
  torturing of a human soul, the opening of new vistas of despair, the stage be
  cleared for a new tragedy.</p>

  <p>The colonel was to find that the chief anxiety of his "shareholders" was
  not as to the future of the company or as to the success of its trading.
  Again and again he was asked a question couched in identical words, and again
  and again he replied with a shrug of his big shoulders:</p>

  <p>"What's the good of worrying about a thing like that? Jack o' Judgment is
  a crook! That's all he is, boys, a crook. He's not the sort of man who'll go
  to the police and give us away; he wouldn't dare put his nose inside a police
  station. You leave him to us, we'll fix him sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"But," somebody asked uneasily, "what about Raoul, that fellow who was
  killed at Putney?"</p>

  <p>The colonel lifted his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Raoul," he said; "he was nothing to do with us. I never heard the
  fellow's name until I read it in the paper. As to White"&mdash;he shrugged
  his shoulders again&mdash;"we can't prevent people having private quarrels,
  and may be this Frenchman and White had one. My theory is," he said,
  elaborating an idea which had only at that moment occurred to him, "that
  Raoul, White and this Jack o' Judgment were working together. Maybe it isn't
  a bad thing that White was killed under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>He dropped his hand on the other man's shoulder and oozed geniality.</p>

  <p>"Now, back you go, my lads, and don't worry. Leave it to old Dan to fix
  Jack o' Judgment, or Bill o' Judgment, or Tom o' Judgment, whoever he may be,
  and that we'll fix him you can be certain."</p>

  <p>Coming away from the meeting, he expressed himself as being perfectly
  satisfied with its results. He brought Pinto and Crewe back with him in his
  car, and dropped the latter at Piccadilly Circus. Pinto would have been glad
  to have joined the "Swell," but the colonel detained him.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you, Pinto," he said.</p>

  <p>"I've had enough business for to-day," said the Portuguese.</p>

  <p>"So have I," said the colonel, "but that doesn't prevent my attending to
  pressing affairs. I was talking to you to-day&mdash;or was it
  yesterday?&mdash;about Crotin."</p>

  <p>"The Yorkshire woollen merchant?" said Pinto.</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow," replied the colonel. "I suggested you should go and
  see him."</p>

  <p>"And I suggested that I shouldn't," said Pinto; "let him rest. You'll
  never get another chance like you had before."</p>

  <p>"Rest nothing," said the colonel testily, "you're scared because you
  imagine Crotin is warned? What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Pinto was silent.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think that, because Jack o' Judgment intervened at the
  right moment, he went back to Yorkshire feeling full of himself? Well, you're
  wrong. You don't understand one side of the psychology of this business. That
  little fellow is quaking in his shoes and wondering what his grand wife would
  say if the fact that he was a bigamist was revealed. And there's more reason
  for his fear to-day than ever there was. Look here!"</p>

  <p>He took a newspaper out of his pocket and Pinto remembered that, even
  during the meeting, the colonel had twice made reference to its columns and
  had wondered why. He had suspected that there had been some reference to the
  Boundary Gang, but this was not the case. The paragraph which the colonel
  pointed out with his thick forefinger was this:</p>

  <p>"By the death of Sir George Tressillian Morgan an ancient baronetcy has
  become extinct. His estate, which has been sworn at over a million, passes to
  his niece, Lady Sybil Crotin, the daughter of Lord Westsevern, Sir George's
  son and heir having been killed in the war. Lady Sybil is the wife of a
  well-known Yorkshire mill-owner."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that," said Pinto, interested in spite of himself.</p>

  <p>"Nor did I till to-day," said the colonel. "The fact is, this damned Jack
  o' Judgment has put everything else out of our minds. And you can see for
  yourself, Pinto, that this business is important."</p>

  <p>Pinto nodded.</p>

  <p>"We are not only after the mill, but here's a chance of making a real big
  coup. Now I can't send anybody else to Yorkshire&mdash;Crewe is impossible.
  Crotin knows him, and the moment he puts in an appearance, as likely as not
  Crotin would lose his head and give the whole show away. It is you or
  nobody."</p>

  <p>He rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You know, there are times when I'm sorry about Solomon White," he said,
  "he was the boy for this kind of business&mdash;that is to say in the old
  days&mdash;he got a bit above himself towards the end."</p>

  <p>Pinto was to find that the colonel had made all arrangements, and that for
  the previous two days he had been planning a predatory raid on the
  Yorkshireman.</p>

  <p>There was to be a bazaar in Huddersfield on behalf of a local hospital, in
  which Lady Sybil Crotin took a great interest. She was organising the fete
  and had invited subscriptions.</p>

  <p>"They're not coming in very fast, according to their local paper," said
  the colonel, "and that has given me an idea. You're a presentable sort of
  fellow, Pinto, and it is likely you'll be all the more successful because
  you're a foreigner. You'll go up to Yorkshire and you'll take a thousand
  pounds, and if necessary you'll subscribe pretty liberally to the fund, but
  it must be done through Lady Sybil. You can make yourself known to her and
  invite yourself to the house, where you can meet Crotin himself."</p>

  <p>He made other suggestions, for he had worked out the whole scheme in
  detail for the other to carry into effect. Pinto's objections slowly
  dissipated. He was a vain man and had all the vices of his vanity. A desire
  to be thought well of, to be regarded as a rich man when he was in fact on
  the verge of ruin, had brought him into crooked practices and eventually into
  the circle of the colonel's acquaintances.</p>

  <p>To appear amongst the fair as a giver of largesse on a magnificent scale
  suited him down to the ground. It was a part for which he was eminently
  fitted, as the colonel, a shrewd judge of humanity, knew quite well.</p>

  <p>"I'll take it on," said Pinto, "but do you think he'll squeal?"</p>

  <p>Boundary shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I never knew a man who was caught on the rebound to squeal," he said.
  "No, no, you needn't worry about that. All you have to do is to use your
  discretion, choose the right moment, preparing him by a few hints for what is
  coming, and you'll find he'll sit down, like the hard-headed business man he
  is, and talk money."</p>

  <p>Pinto pulled a little face.</p>

  <p>"I know what you're thinking," said the colonel. "You hate the idea of the
  generous donor being unmasked and appearing to anybody as a blackmailer.
  Well, you needn't worry about that. Lady Sybil will not know, nor will
  anybody else that counts. And, believe me, Crotin doesn't count. Anyway, you
  can pretend that you're a perfectly innocent agent in the matter, that you
  know me slightly and that I've dropped hints which made you curious and which
  you are anxious to verify."</p>

  <p>Pinto went off to make preparations for the journey. He had one of the top
  flats in the Albemarle building, a suite of rooms which, if they were not as
  expensively furnished as the colonel's, were more artistic. He had recently
  acquired the services of a new "daily valet"&mdash;a step he could take
  without fear that his secrets would be betrayed, since he had no secrets in
  his own rooms, kept no documents of any kind, and received no visitors.</p>

  <p>The man opened the door to his ring.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, nobody has been," said the servant in answer to his query, and
  Pinto was relieved.</p>

  <p>For the past two days he had been living in a condition bordering on
  panic. It seemed unlikely that the colonel's confidence would be justified
  and that the police would take no action. And yet the incredible had
  happened. There had not been so much as an inquiry; and not once, though he
  had been on his guard, had he detected one shadow trailing him. His spirits
  rose, and he whistled cheerfully as he directed the packing of his trunk, for
  he was travelling North fully equipped for any social event which might await
  him.</p>

  <p>"I am going to Yorkshire," he explained. "I'll give you my address before
  I leave, and you can let me know if there are any inquiries and who the
  inquirers were."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," said the man respectfully, and Pinto eyed him
  approvingly.</p>

  <p>"I think you'll suit me, Cobalt," he said. "My last valet was rather a
  fool and inclined to stick his nose into business which did not concern
  him."</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"I shan't trouble you that way, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course, there's nothing to hide," said Pinto with a shrug, "but you
  know what people are. They think that because you're associated in business
  with Colonel Boundary you're up to all sorts of tricks."</p>

  <p>"That's what Mr. Snakit said, sir," remarked the man.</p>

  <p>"Snakit?" said the puzzled Pinto. "Who the devil is Snakit?"</p>

  <p>Then he remembered the little detective whom Maisie had employed and who
  had been bought over by the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you see him, do you?" he asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>"He comes up, sir, now and again. He's the colonel's valet, isn't he,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>Pinto grinned.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," he said. "I shouldn't discuss things with Snakit. That man
  is quite reliable and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, sir, I should not discuss your business," said the valet with
  dignity.</p>

  <p>He finished packing and, after assisting his master to dress, was
  dismissed for the night.</p>

  <p>"A useful fellow, that," thought Pinto, as the door closed behind the man.
  The "useful fellow" reached the street and, after walking a few hundred
  yards, found a disengaged taxi and gave an address. Maisie White was writing
  when her bell rang. It rang three times&mdash;two long and one short
  peals&mdash;and she went downstairs to admit her visitor. She did not speak
  until she was back in her room, and then she faced the polite little man whom
  Pinto had called Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Grey," she said.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd call me Cobalt, miss," said the man with a smile. "I like to
  keep up the name, otherwise I'm inclined to give myself away."</p>

  <p>"Have you found out anything?"</p>

  <p>"Very little, miss," said the detective. "There's nothing to find in the
  apartment itself."</p>

  <p>"You secured the situation as valet?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Thanks to the recommendations you got me, miss, there was no difficulty
  at all. Silva wanted a servant and accepted the testimonials without
  question."</p>

  <p>"And you've discovered nothing?" she said in a disappointed tone.</p>

  <p>"Not in Mr. Silva's room. The only thing I found out was that he's going
  to Yorkshire to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"For long?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"For some considerable time," said the detective.</p>

  <p>"At least, I guess so, because he has packed half a dozen suits, top hats
  and all sorts of things which I should imagine he wouldn't take away unless
  he intended making a long stay."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea of the place he's going to?"</p>

  <p>"I shall discover that to-morrow, miss," said Cobalt. "I thought I'd tell
  you as much as I know."</p>

  <p>"And you have not been into the colonel's flat?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is guarded inside and out, miss, now. He has not only his butler, who
  is a tough customer, to look after him, but he has Snakit, the man you
  employed, I understand."</p>

  <p>"That's the gentleman," said the girl with a little smile. "Very good,
  Cobalt&mdash;you'll 'phone me if you make any other discoveries."</p>

  <p>She was sitting at her solitary breakfast the next morning when the
  telephone bell rang. It was from a call office, and presently she heard
  Cobalt's voice. "Just a word, miss. He leaves by the ten-twenty-five train
  for Huddersfield," said the voice, "and the person he is going to see is Lady
  Sybil somebody, and there's money in it."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"I heard him speaking to the colonel on the landing and I heard the words:
  'He'll pay.'"</p>

  <p>She thought a moment.</p>

  <p>"Ten-twenty-five," she repeated; "thank you very much, Mr. Cobalt."</p>

  <p>She hung up the receiver and sat for a moment in thought, then passed
  quickly to her bedroom and began to dress.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap25"
     id="chap25">XXV. A PATRON OF CHARITY</a></h2>

  <p>Lady Sybil Crotin was not a popular woman. She was conscious that she had
  married beneath her&mdash;more conscious lately that there had been no
  necessity to make the marriage, and she had grown a little soured. She could
  never mix with the homely wives of local millionaires; she professed a horror
  of the vulgarities with which she was surrounded, hated and loathed her lord
  and master's flamboyant home, which she described as something between a
  feudal castle and a picture-palace; and openly despised her husband's friends
  and their feminine relatives.</p>

  <p>She made a point of spending at least six months of the year away from
  Yorkshire, and came back with protest at her lot written visibly upon her
  face.</p>

  <p>A thin, angular woman, with pale green eyes and straight, tight lips, she
  had never been beautiful, but five or six years in an uncongenial environment
  had hardened and wasted her. That her husband adored her and never spoke of
  her save in a tone of awe was common property and a favourite subject for
  local humour. That she regarded him with contempt and irritation was as well
  known.</p>

  <p>In view of Lady Sybil Crotin's unpopularity, it was perhaps a great
  mistake that she should make herself responsible for the raising of funds for
  the local women's hospital. But she was under the impression that there was a
  magic in her name and station which would overcome what she described as
  shyness, but which was in point of fact the frank dislike of her neighbours.
  A subscription list that she had opened had a weak and unpromising
  appearance. She had with the greatest difficulty secured help for the bazaar,
  and knew, even though it had been opened by a duchess, that it was a failure,
  even from the very first day.</p>

  <p>Had she herself made a generous contribution to the bazaar fund, there
  might have been a hope; but she was mean, and the big, bleak hall she had
  chosen as the venue because of its cheapness was unsuitable for the
  entertainment she sponsored.</p>

  <p>On the afternoon of the second day, Lady Sybil was pulling on her gloves,
  eyeing her husband with an unfriendly gaze as he sat at lunch.</p>

  <p>"It was no more than I expected," she said bitterly. "I was a fool ever to
  start the thing&mdash;this is the last time I ever attempt to help local
  charities."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crotin rubbed his bald head in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"They'll come," he said hopefully, referring to the patrons whose absence
  was the cause of Lady Sybil's annoyance. "They'll come when they hear what a
  fine show it is. And if they don't, Syb, I'll come along and spend a couple
  of hundred pounds myself."</p>

  <p>"You'll do no such thing," she snapped; "and please get out of that
  ridiculous habit of reducing my name to one syllable. If the people of the
  town can't help to support their own hospital, then they don't deserve to
  have one, and I'm certainly not going to allow you to waste our money on that
  sort of nonsense."</p>

  <p>"Have your own way, love," said Mr. Crotin meekly.</p>

  <p>"Besides," she said, "it would be all over the town that it was your money
  which was coming in, and these horrid people would be laughing at me."</p>

  <p>She finished buttoning her gloves and was looking at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with you, John?" she asked suddenly, and he almost
  jumped.</p>

  <p>"With me, love?" he said with a brave attempt at a smile. "Why, there's
  nothing the matter with me. What should there be?"</p>

  <p>"You've been very strange lately," she said, "ever since you came back
  from London."</p>

  <p>"I think I ate something that disagreed with my digestion," he said
  uneasily. "I didn't know that I'd been different."</p>

  <p>"Are things well at your&mdash;factory?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"At mills? Oh, aye, they're all right," he said. "I wish everything was as
  right as them."</p>

  <p>"As they," she corrected.</p>

  <p>"As they," said the humble Mr. Crotin.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong," she said, and shook her head, and Mr. Crotin
  found himself going white. "I'll have a talk with you when I've got this
  wretched bazaar business out of my head," she added, and with a little nod
  she left him.</p>

  <p>He walked to the window of the long dining-hall and watched her car
  disappearing down the drive, and then with a sigh went back to his
  <i>entremets</i>.</p>

  <p>When Colonel Dan Boundary surmised that this unfortunate victim of his
  blackmail would be worried, he was not far from the mark. Crotin had spent
  many sleepless nights since he came back from London, nights full of terror,
  that left him a wreck to meet the fears of the days which followed. He lived
  all the time in the shadow of vengeful justice and exaggerated his danger to
  an incredible degree; perhaps it was in anticipating what his wife would say
  that he experienced the most poignant misery.</p>

  <p>He had taken to secret drinking too; little nips at odd intervals, both in
  his room and in his private office. Life had lost its savour, and now a new
  agony was added to the knowledge that his wife had detected the change. He
  went to his office and spent a gloomy afternoon wandering about the mills,
  and came back an hour before his usual time. He had not the heart to make a
  call at the bazaar, and speculated unhappily upon the proceeds of the
  afternoon session.</p>

  <p>It was therefore with something like pleasure that he heard his wife on
  the telephone speaking more cheerfully than he had heard her for months.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, John?" she was almost civil. "I'm bringing somebody home to
  dinner. Will you tell Phillips?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, love," said Mr. Crotin eagerly.</p>

  <p>He would be glad to see some new face, and that it was a new face he could
  guess by the interest in Lady Sybil's tone.</p>

  <p>"It is a Mr. de Silva. Have you ever met him?"</p>

  <p>"No, love, I've not. Is he a foreigner?"</p>

  <p>"He's a Portuguese gentleman," said his wife's voice; "and he has been
  most helpful and most generous."</p>

  <p>"Bring him along," said Crotin heartily. "I'll be glad to meet him. How
  has the sale been, love?"</p>

  <p>"Very good indeed," she replied; "splendid, in fact&mdash;thanks to Mr. de
  Silva."</p>

  <p>John Crotin was dressing when his wife returned, and it was not until half
  an hour later that he met Pinto Silva for the first time. Pinto was a man who
  dressed well and looked well. John Crotin thought he was the most impressive
  personality he had met, when he stalked into the drawing- room and took the
  proffered hand of the mill-owner.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. de Silva," said his wife, who had been waiting for her guest.
  "As I told you, John, Mr. de Silva has been awfully kind. I don't know what
  you're going to do with all those perfectly useless things you've bought,"
  she added to the polished Portuguese, and Pinto shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Give them away," he said; "there must, for example, be a lot of poor
  women in the country who would be glad of the linen I have bought."</p>

  <p>At this point dinner was announced and he took Lady Sybil in. The meal was
  approaching its end when she revived the question of the disposal of his
  purchases.</p>

  <p>"Are you greatly interested in charities, Mr. de Silva?"</p>

  <p>Pinto inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"Both here and in Portugal I take a very deep interest in the welfare of
  the poor," he said solemnly.</p>

  <p>"That's fine," said Mr. Crotin, nodding approvingly. "I know what these
  poor people have to suffer. I've been amongst them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His wife silenced him with a look.</p>

  <p>"It frequently happens that cases are brought to my notice," Pinto went
  on, "and I have one or two cases of women in my mind where these purchases of
  mine would be most welcome. For example," he said, "I heard the other day,
  quite by accident, of a poor woman in Wales whose husband deserted her."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crotin had his fork half-way to his mouth, but put it down again.</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about the case personally," said Pinto carelessly, "but
  the circumstances were brought to my notice by a friend. I think these people
  suffer more than we imagine; and I'll let you into a secret, Lady Sybil," he
  said, speaking impressively. He did not look at Crotin, but went on: "A few
  of my friends are thinking of buying a mill."</p>

  <p>"A woollen mill?" she said, raising her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"A woollen mill!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"But why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We wish to make garments and blankets for the benefit of the poor. We
  feel that, if we could run this sort of thing on a co-operative basis, we
  could manufacture the stuff cheaply, always providing, of course, that we
  could purchase a mill at a reasonable figure."</p>

  <p>For the first time he looked at Crotin, and the man's face was ghastly
  white.</p>

  <p>"What a queer idea!" said Lady Sybil. "A good mill will cost you a lot of
  money."</p>

  <p>"We don't think so," said Pinto. "In fact, we expect to purchase a very
  excellent mill at a reasonable sum. That was my object in coming to
  Yorkshire, I may tell you, and it was only by accident that I saw the
  advertisement of your bazaar and called in."</p>

  <p>"A fortunate accident for me," said Lady Sybil.</p>

  <p>Crotin's eyes were on his plate, and he did not raise them.</p>

  <p>"I think it is a great mistake to be too generous with the poor," said
  Lady Sybil, shaking her head. "These women are very seldom grateful."</p>

  <p>"I realise that," said Pinto gravely. "But I am not seeking their
  gratitude. We find that many of these women are in terrible circumstances
  owing to no fault of their own. For example, this woman in Wales, whose
  husband is supposed to have deserted her&mdash;now, there is a bad case."</p>

  <p>Lady Sybil was interested.</p>

  <p>"We found on investigation," said Pinto, speaking slowly and impressively,
  "that the man who deserted her has since married and occupies a very
  important position in a town in the north of England."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crotin dropped his knife with a crash and with a mumbled apology
  picked it up.</p>

  <p>"But how terrible!" said Lady Sybil. "What a shocking thing! The man
  should be exposed. He is not fit to associate with human beings. Can't you do
  something to punish him?"</p>

  <p>"That could be done," said Silva, "it could be done, but it would bring a
  great deal of unhappiness to his present wife, who is ignorant of her
  husband's treachery."</p>

  <p>"Better she should know now than later," said the militant Lady Sybil. "I
  think you do very wrong to keep it from her."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crotin rose unsteadily and his wife looked at him with suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you feeling well, John?" she asked with asperity.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time she had seen her husband's hand shaking and had
  diagnosed the cause more justly than she was doing at present, for John
  Crotin had scarcely taken a drink that evening.</p>

  <p>"I'm going into the library, if you'll excuse me, love," he said. "Maybe,
  Mr.&mdash;Mr. de Silva will join me. I'd&mdash;I'd like to talk over the
  question of that mill with him."</p>

  <p>Pinto nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then run along now," said Lady Sybil, "and when you've finished talking,
  come back to me, Mr. de Silva. I want to know something about your charitable
  organisations in Portugal."</p>

  <p>Pinto followed the other at a distance, saw him enter a big room and
  switch on the lights and followed, closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Crotin's library was the most comfortable room in the house. It was
  lighted by French windows which opened on to a small terrace. Long red velvet
  curtains were drawn, and a little fire crackled on the hearth.</p>

  <p>When the door closed Crotin turned upon his guest.</p>

  <p>"Now, damn you," he said harshly, "what's thy proposition? Make it a
  reasonable sum and I'll pay thee."</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap26"
     id="chap26">XXVI. THE SOLDIER WHO FOLLOWED</a></h2>

  <p>In the train which had carried Pinto Silva to Huddersfield were one or two
  remarkable passengers, and it was not a coincidence that they did not meet.
  In a third-class carriage at the far end of the train was a soldier who
  carried a kit-bag and who whiled away the journey by reading a seemingly
  endless collection of magazines.</p>

  <p>He got out at Huddersfield too, and Pinto might and probably did see him
  as he passed through the barrier. The soldier left his kit-bag at the
  cloak-room and eventually became one of the two dozen people who patronised
  Lady Sybil's bazaar on that afternoon. He passed Pinto twice, and once made a
  small purchase at the same stall where the Portuguese was buying lavishly. If
  Pinto saw him, then he did not remember the fact. One soldier looks very much
  like another, anyway.</p>

  <p>Lady Sybil had reason to notice the representative of His Majesty's
  forces, and herself informed him severely that smoking was not allowed, and
  the man had put his cigarette under his heel with an apology and had walked
  out of the building. When Lady Sybil and her guest had entered her car and
  were driven away to Mill Hall, the soldier had been loitering near the
  entrance, and a few minutes later he was following the party in a taxi- cab
  which had been waiting at his order for the past two hours.</p>

  <p>The taxi did not turn in at the stone-pillared gates of the Hall, but
  continued some distance beyond, when the soldier alighted and, turning back,
  walked boldly through the main entrance and passed up the drive. It was dusk
  by now, and nobody challenged him.</p>

  <p>He made a reconnaissance of the house and found the dining-room without
  any difficulty. The blinds were up and the servants were setting the table.
  Then he passed round to the wing of the building and discovered the library.
  He actually went into that room, because it was one of Lady Sybil's standing
  orders that the library should be "aired" and that the scent of Mr. Crotin's
  atrocious tobacco should be cleared.</p>

  <p>He sniffed the stale fragrance and was satisfied that this was a room
  which was lived in.</p>

  <p>If there was any real, confidential talk between the two men, it would be
  here, he thought, and looked round for a likely place of concealment. The
  room was innocent of cupboards. Only a big settee drawn diagonally across a
  corner of the room promised cover, and that looked too dangerous. If anybody
  sat there and by chance dropped something&mdash;a pipe or an
  ash-tray&mdash;</p>

  <p>He walked back to the terrace to take his bearings in case he had to make
  a rapid exit. He looked round and then dropped suddenly to the cover of the
  balustrade, for he had seen a dark figure moving across the lawn, and it was
  coming straight for the terrace. He slipped back into the room and as he did
  so he heard a step in the passage without. He stepped lightly over to the
  settee and crouched down.</p>

  <p>It was evidently a servant, for he heard the French windows closed and the
  clang of the shutters. They were evidently very ordinary folding- shutters,
  fastened with an old-fashioned steel bar&mdash;he made a mental note of this.
  Then he heard the swish of the curtain-rings upon the brass pole as the
  curtains were drawn. A dim light was switched on, somebody poked the fire,
  and then the light was put out and the door closed softly.</p>

  <p>The intruder did some rapid thinking. He crossed to the nearest of the
  windows, noiselessly opened the shutters and pushed them back to the position
  in which they stood when not in use. Then he unlatched the window and left
  it, hoping that it would not blow open and betray him. This done, he again
  pulled the heavy curtains across and returned to his place of concealment.
  That was to be the way out for him if the necessity for a rapid retreat
  should arise.</p>

  <p>There was no sound save the ticking of the clock and the noise of falling
  cinders for ten minutes, and then he heard something which brought him to the
  alert, all his senses awakened and concentrated. It was the sound of a light
  and stealthy footstep on the terrace outside. He wondered whether it was a
  servant and whether he would see that one of the windows was unshuttered. He
  had half a mind to investigate, when there came another sound&mdash;a
  lumbering foot in the passage. Suddenly the door was opened, the lights were
  flashed on, and the man behind the settee hugged the floor and held his
  breath.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>"How much do I want?"</p>

  <p>Pinto laughed and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Crotin, I really don't know what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Let's have no more foolery," said the Yorkshireman roughly. "I know that
  you've come up from Colonel Boundary and I know what you've come for. You
  want to buy my mill, eh? Well, I'll make it worth your while not to buy my
  mill. You can take the money instead."</p>

  <p>"I really am honest when I tell you that I don't understand what you are
  talking about. I have certainly come up to buy a mill&mdash;that is true. It
  is also true that I want to buy your mill."</p>

  <p>"And what might you be thinking of paying for it?" asked Crotin between
  his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand pounds," said Pinto nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand, eh? It was thirty thousand the last time. You'll want me
  to give it to you soon. Nay, nay, my friend, I'll pay, but not in mills."</p>

  <p>"Think of the poor," murmured Pinto.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking of them," said the other. "I'm thinking of the poor woman in
  Wales, too, and the poor woman in there." He jerked his head. Then, in a
  calmer tone: "I guessed at dinner where you came from. Colonel Boundary sent
  you."</p>

  <p>Pinto shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Let us mention no names," he said politely. "And who is Colonel Boundary,
  anyway?"</p>

  <p>Crotin was at his desk now. He had taken out his cheque-book and slapped
  it down upon the writing-pad.</p>

  <p>"You've got me proper," he said, and his voice quavered. "I'll make an
  offer to you. I'll give you fifty thousand pounds if you write an agreement
  that you will not molest or bother me again."</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and the soldier crouched behind the settee, listening
  intently. He heard Pinto laugh softly as one who is greatly amused.</p>

  <p>"That, my good friend," said Pinto, "would be blackmail. You don't imagine
  that I would be guilty of such an iniquity? I know nothing about your past; I
  merely suggest that you should sell me one of your mills at a reasonable
  price."</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand pounds is reasonable for you, I suppose," said Crotin
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"It is a lot of money," replied Pinto.</p>

  <p>The Yorkshireman pulled open the drawer of his desk and slammed in the
  cheque-book, closing it with a bang.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll give you nothing," he said, "neither mill nor money. You can
  clear out of here."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room to the telephone.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked Pinto, secretly alarmed.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to send for the police," said the other grimly. "I'm going to
  give myself up and I'm going to pinch thee too!"</p>

  <p>If Crotin had turned the handle of the old-fashioned telephone, if he had
  continued in his resolution, if he had shown no sign of doubt, a different
  story might have been told. But with his hand raised, he hesitated, and Pinto
  clinched his argument.</p>

  <p>"Why have all that trouble?" he said. "Your liberty and reputation are
  much more to you than a mill. You're a rich man. Your wife is wealthy in her
  own right. You have enough to live on for the rest of your life. Why make
  trouble?"</p>

  <p>The little man dropped his head with a groan and walked wearily back to
  the desk.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I sell this?" he said in a low voice. "How do I know you won't
  come again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When a gentleman gives his word of honour," began Pinto with dignity, but
  was interrupted by a shrill laugh that made his blood run cold.</p>

  <p>He swung round with an oath. Framed in an opening of the curtains which
  covered one of the windows was the Figure!</p>

  <p>The black silk gown, the white masked face, the soft felt hat pulled down
  over the eyes&mdash;his teeth chattered at the sight of it, and he fell back
  against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Who wouldn't trust Pinto?" squeaked the voice. "Who wouldn't take Pinto's
  word of honour? Jack o' Judgment wouldn't, poor old Jack o' Judgment!"</p>

  <p>Jack o' Judgment! The soldier behind the settee heard the words and
  gasped. Without any thought of consequence he raised his head and looked. The
  Jack o' Judgment was standing where he expected him to be. He had come
  through the window which the soldier had left unbarred. This time he carried
  no weapon in his hand, and Pinto was quick to see the possibilities. The
  electric switch was within reach, and his hand shot out. There was a click
  and the room went dark.</p>

  <p>But the figure of Jack o' Judgment was silhouetted against the night, and
  Pinto whipped out the long knife which never left him and sent it hurtling at
  his enemy. He saw the figure duck, heard the crash of broken glass, and then
  Jack o' Judgment vanished. In a rage which was three parts terror, he sprang
  through the open French windows on to the terrace in time to see a dark
  figure drop over the balustrade and fly across the park.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap27"
     id="chap27">XXVII. THE CAPTURE OF "JACK"</a></h2>

  <p>Pinto leapt the parapet and was following swiftly in its wake. He guessed
  rather than knew that for once Jack o' Judgment had come unarmed, and a wild
  exultation filled him at the thought that it was left to him to unveil the
  mystery which was weighing even upon the iron nerve of the colonel.</p>

  <p>The figure gained the shrubbery, and the pursuer heard the rustle of
  leaves as it plunged into the depths. In a second he was blundering after. He
  lost sight of his quarry and stopped to listen. There was no sound.</p>

  <p>"Hiding," grunted Pinto. And then aloud: "Come out of it. I see you and
  I'll shoot you like a dog if you don't come to me!"</p>

  <p>There was no reply. He dashed in the direction he thought Jack o' Judgment
  must have taken and again missed. With a curse he turned off in another
  direction and then suddenly glimpsed a shape before him and leapt at it. He
  was flung back with little or no effort, and stood bewildered, for the coat
  his hand had touched was rough and he had felt metal buttons.</p>

  <p>"A soldier!" he gasped. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Steady," said the other; "don't get rattled, Pinto."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked Pinto again.</p>

  <p>"My name is Stafford King," said the soldier, "and I think I shall want
  you."</p>

  <p>Pinto half turned to go, but was gripped.</p>

  <p>"You can go back to Huddersfield and pack your boxes," said Stafford King.
  "You won't leave the town except by my permission."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Pinto, breathing heavily.</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Stafford King, "that the unfortunate man you tried to
  blackmail must prosecute whatever be the consequence to himself. Now, Pinto,
  you've a grand chance of turning King's evidence."</p>

  <p>Pinto made no reply. He was collecting his thoughts. Then, after a while,
  he said:</p>

  <p>"I'll talk about that later, King. I'm staying at the Huddersfield Arms.
  I'll meet you there in an hour."</p>

  <p>Stafford King did not move until the sound of Pinto's footsteps had died
  away. Then he began a systematic search, for he too was anxious to end the
  mystery of Jack o' Judgment. He had followed Pinto when he dashed from the
  room and had heard the Portuguese calling upon Jack o' Judgment to surrender.
  That mysterious individual, who was obviously lying low, could not be very
  far away.</p>

  <p>He was in a shrubbery which proved later to be a clump of rhododendrons,
  in the centre of which was a summer-house. To the heart of this shrubbery led
  three paths, one of which Stafford discovered quite close at hand. The sound
  of gravel under his feet gave him an idea, and he began walking backward till
  he came to the shadow of a tree, and then, simulating the sound of retreating
  footsteps, he waited.</p>

  <p>After a while he heard a rustle, but did not move.</p>

  <p>Somebody was coming cautiously through the bushes, and that somebody
  appeared as a shadowy, indistinct figure, not twenty yards away. Only the
  keenest eyesight could have detected it, and still Stafford waited. Presently
  he heard the soft crunch of gravel under its feet, and at that moment leapt
  towards it. The figure stood as though paralysed for a second, and then,
  turning quickly, fled back to the heart of the bushes. Before it had gone a
  dozen paces Stafford had reached it, and his arm was about its neck.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he breathed, "I don't know what I'm to do with you now I've
  got you, but I certainly am going to register your face for future
  reference."</p>

  <p>"No, no," said a muffled voice from behind the mask. "No, no, don't; I beg
  of you!"</p>

  <p>But the mask was plucked away, and, fumbling in his pocket, Stafford
  produced his electric lamp and flashed it on the face of his prisoner. Then,
  with a cry of amazement, he stepped back&mdash;for he had looked upon the
  face of Maisie White!</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence, neither speaking. Then Stafford found his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Maisie!" he said in bewilderment, "Maisie! You&mdash;Jack o'
  Judgment?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" whistled Stafford.</p>

  <p>Then sitting on a trunk, he laughed.</p>

  <p>"It is Maisie, of all people in the world. And I suspected it, too!"</p>

  <p>The girl had covered her face with her hands and was crying softly, and he
  moved towards her and put his arm about her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Darling, it is nothing very terrible. Please don't go on like that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you don't understand, you don't understand!" she wailed. "I wanted to
  catch Silva. I guessed that he was coming north on one of his blackmailing
  trips, and I followed him."</p>

  <p>"Did you come up by the same train?"</p>

  <p>He felt her nod.</p>

  <p>"So did I," said Stafford with a little grin.</p>

  <p>"I followed him to the bazaar," she said, "and then I watched him from a
  little eating-house on the opposite side of the road. Do you know, I wondered
  whether you were here too, and I looked everywhere for you, but apparently
  there was nobody in sight when Pinto came out with Lady Sybil, only a
  soldier."</p>

  <p>"I was that soldier," said Stafford.</p>

  <p>"I discovered where Mr. Crotin lived and came up later," she went on. "Of
  course, I had no very clear idea of what I was going to do, and it was only
  by the greatest luck that I found the window of the library open. It was the
  only window that was open," she said with a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't so much your luck as my forethought," smiled Stafford.</p>

  <p>"Now I want to tell you about Jack o' Judgment," she began, but he stopped
  her.</p>

  <p>"Let that explanation wait," he said; "the point is, that with your
  evidence and mine we have Pinto by the throat&mdash;what was that?"</p>

  <p>There was the sound of a shot.</p>

  <p>"Probably a poacher," said Stafford after a moment. "I can't imagine Pinto
  using a gun. Besides, I don't think he carries one. What did he throw at
  you?"</p>

  <p>"A knife," she said, and he felt her shiver; "it just missed me. But tell
  me, how have we got Pinto?"</p>

  <p>They had left the shrubbery and were walking towards the house. She
  stopped a little while to take off her long black cloak, and he saw that she
  was wearing a short-skirted dress beneath.</p>

  <p>"We must compel Crotin to prosecute," said Stafford. "With our evidence
  nothing can save Pinto, and probably he will drag in the colonel, too. Even
  your evidence isn't necessary," he said after a moment's thought, "and if
  it's possible I will keep you out of it."</p>

  <p>A woman's scream interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"There's trouble there," he said, and raced for the house. Somebody was
  standing on the terrace as he approached, and hailed him excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Terence?"</p>

  <p>It was a servant's voice.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Stafford, "I am a police officer."</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" said the man on the terrace. "Will you come up, sir? I
  thought it was the gamekeeper I was speaking to."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" asked Stafford as he vaulted over the parapet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Crotin has shot himself, sir," said the butler in quavering
  tones.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Twelve hours later Stafford King reported to his chief, giving the details
  of the overnight tragedy.</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow!" said Sir Stanley. "I was afraid of it ending that way."</p>

  <p>"Did you know he was being blackmailed?" asked Stafford.</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley nodded.</p>

  <p>"We had a report, which apparently emanated from Jack o' Judgment, who of
  late has started sending his communications to me direct," said Sir Stanley.
  "You can, of course, do nothing with Pinto. Your evidence isn't sufficient.
  What a pity you hadn't a second witness." He thought for a moment. "Even then
  it wouldn't have been sufficient unless we had Crotin to support you."</p>

  <p>Stafford cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I have a second witness, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"The devil you have!" Sir Stanley raised his eyebrows. "Who was your
  second witness?"</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment," said Stafford, and Sir Stanley jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment!" he repeated. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment was there," said Stafford, and told the story of the
  remarkable appearance of that mysterious figure.</p>

  <p>He told everything, reserving the identification of Jack till the
  last.</p>

  <p>"And then you flashed the lamp on his face," said Sir Stanley. "Well, who
  was it?"</p>

  <p>"Maisie White," said Stafford.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley walked to the window and stood looking out, his hands thrust
  into his pockets. Presently he turned.</p>

  <p>"There's a bigger mystery here than I suspected," he said. "Have you asked
  Miss White for an explanation?"</p>

  <p>Stafford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I thought it best to report the matter to you, sir, before I asked her
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To incriminate herself, eh? Well, perhaps you did wisely, perhaps you did
  not. I should imagine that her explanation is a very simple one."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Sir Stanley, "that unless Jack o' Judgment has the gift of
  appearing in two places at once, she is not Jack."</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Sir Stanley, "that Jack o' Judgment was in the colonel's
  room last night, was in fact sitting by the colonel's bedside when that
  gentleman awoke, and according to the statement which Colonel Boundary has
  made to me about two hours ago in this room, warned him of his approaching
  end."</p>

  <p>It was Stafford's turn to be astonished.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, sir?" he asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!" said Sir Stanley. "You don't imagine that the colonel would
  invent that sort of thing. For some reason or other, possibly to keep close
  to the trouble that's coming, the colonel insists upon bringing all his
  little chit-chat to me. He asked for an interview about ten o'clock this
  morning and reported to me that he had had this visitation. Moreover, the
  experience has had the effect of upsetting the colonel, and for the first
  time he seems to be thoroughly rattled. Where is Miss White?"</p>

  <p>"She's here, sir."</p>

  <p>"Here, eh?" said the commissioner. "So much the better. Can you bring her
  in?"</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the girl sat facing the First Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss White, we're going to ask you for a few facts about your
  masquerade," said Sir Stanley kindly. "I understand that you appeared wearing
  the costume, and giving a fairly good imitation of the voice of Jack o'
  Judgment. Now, I'm telling you before we go any further that I do not believe
  for one moment that you are Jack o' Judgment. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly true, Sir Stanley," she said. "I don't know why I did such a
  mad thing, except that I knew Pinto was scared of him. I got the cloak from
  my dress-basket and made the mask myself. You see, I didn't know whether I
  might want it, but I thought that in a tight pinch, if I wished to terrify
  this man, that was the role to assume."</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley nodded.</p>

  <p>"And the voice, of course, was easy."</p>

  <p>"But how could you imitate the voice if you have never seen Jack o'
  Judgment?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him once." She shivered a little. "You seem to forget, Sir Stanley,
  that he rescued me from that dreadful house."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Sir Stanley, "and you imitated him, did you?" He turned
  to his subordinate. "I'm accepting Miss White's explanation, Stafford, and I
  advise you to do the same. She went up to watch Silva, as I understand, and
  took the costume with her as a sort of protection. Well, Miss White, are you
  satisfied with your detective work?"</p>

  <p>She smiled ruefully.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm a failure as a detective," she said.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you are," laughed Sir Stanley, as he rose and offered his
  hand. "There is only one real detective in the world&mdash;and that is Jack
  o' Judgment!"</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap28"
     id="chap28">XXVIII. THE PASSING OF PHILLOPOLIS</a></h2>

  <p>If Pinto Silva had a hobby, it was the Orpheum Theatre. The Orpheum had
  been in low water and had come into the market at a moment when theatrical
  managers and proprietors were singularly unenterprising and money was short.
  Pinto had bought the property for a song, and had converted his purchase into
  a moderate success. The theatre served a double purpose; it provided Pinto
  with a hobby, and offered an excuse for his wealth. Since it was a one-man
  show, and he produced no balance-sheet, his contemporaries could only make a
  guess as to the amount of money he made. If the truth be told, it was not
  very large, but small as it was, its dividends more or less justified his own
  leisure.</p>

  <p>There had been one or two scandals about the Orpheum which had reached the
  public Press&mdash;scandals of a not particularly edifying character. But
  Pinto had managed to escape public opprobrium.</p>

  <p>The Orpheum, at any rate, helped to baffle the police, who saw Silva
  living at the rate of twenty thousand a year, and were unable to trace the
  source of his income. That he had estates in Portugal was known; but they had
  been acquired, apparently, on the profits of the music-hall. He was not a
  speculator, though he was a shareholder in a number of companies which were
  controlled by the colonel; and he was certainly not a gambler, in the
  generally accepted sense of the term.</p>

  <p>Whilst he was suspected of being intimately connected with several shady
  transactions, he could boast truly that there was not a scrap of evidence to
  associate him with any breach of the law. He was less inclined to boast that
  evening, when he turned into the stage-box at the Orpheum, and pulling his
  chair into the shadow of the draperies, sat back and considered his position.
  He had returned from Yorkshire in a panic, and had met the fury of the
  colonel's reproaches. It was the worst quarter of an hour that Pinto had ever
  spent with his superior, and the memory made him shiver.</p>

  <p>The stage-box at the Orpheum was never sold to any member of the public.
  It was Pinto's private possession, his sitting-room and his office. He sat
  watching with gloomy interest the progress of the little revue which was a
  feature of the Orpheum programme, and his mind was occupied by a very
  pressing problem. He was shaken, too, by the interview he had had with the
  Huddersfield police.</p>

  <p>He had had to fake a story to explain why he left the library, and why, in
  his absence, Mr. Crotin had committed suicide. Fortunately, he had returned
  to the house by the front hall and was in the hall inventing a story of
  burglars to the agitated Lady Sybil when they heard the shot which ended the
  wretched life of the bigamist. That had saved him from being suspected of
  actual complicity in the crime. Suppose they had &mdash;he sweated at the
  thought.</p>

  <p>There was a knock on the door of the box, and an attendant put in his
  head.</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman to see you, sir," he said; "he says he has an
  appointment."</p>

  <p>"What is his name?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cartwright."</p>

  <p>Pinto nodded.</p>

  <p>"Show him in, please," he said, and dismissed all unpleasant thoughts.</p>

  <p>The new-comer proved to be a dapper little man, with a weather- beaten
  face. He was in evening dress, and spoke like a gentleman.</p>

  <p>"I had your letter, Mr. Silva," he said. "You received my telephone
  message?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Silva. "I wanted to see you particularly. You understand that
  what I say is wholly confidential."</p>

  <p>"That I understand," said the man called Cartwright.</p>

  <p>He took Pinto's proferred cigarette and lit it.</p>

  <p>"I have been reading about you in the papers," said Pinto. "You're the man
  who did the non-stop flight for the Western Aeroplane Company?"</p>

  <p>"That's right," smiled Cartwright. "I have done many long nights. I
  suppose you are referring to my San Sebastian trip?"</p>

  <p>Pinto nodded.</p>

  <p>"Now I want to ask you a few questions, and if they seem to be prying or
  personal, you must believe that I have no other wish than to secure
  information which is vital to myself. What position do you occupy with the
  Western Company?"</p>

  <p>Cartwright shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am a pilot," he said. "If you mean, am I a director of the firm or am I
  interested in the company financially, I regret that I must answer No. I wish
  I were," he added, "but I am merely an employee."</p>

  <p>Pinto nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is what I wanted to know," he said. "Now, here is another question.
  What does a first-class aeroplane cost?"</p>

  <p>"It depends," said the other. "A long distance machine, such as I have
  been flying, would cost anything up to five thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Could you buy one? Are they on the market?" asked Pinto quickly.</p>

  <p>"I could buy a dozen to-morrow," said the other promptly. "The R.A.F. have
  been selling off their machines, and I know just where I could get one of the
  best in Britain."</p>

  <p>Pinto was looking at the stage, biting his lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I want," he said. "I am not very keenly interested in
  aviation, but it may be necessary that I should return to Portugal in a great
  hurry. It is no news to you that we Portuguese are generally in the throes of
  some revolution or other."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Cartwright, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"In those circumstances," Pinto went on, "it may be necessary for me to
  leave this country without going through the formality of securing a
  passport. I want a machine which will carry me from London to, say, Cintra,
  without a stop, and I want a pilot who can take me across the sea by the
  direct route."</p>

  <p>"Across the Bay of Biscay?" asked the aviator in surprise, and Pinto
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"I should not want to touch any other country en route, for reasons which,
  I tell you frankly, are political."</p>

  <p>Cartwright thought a moment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I can get you the machine, and I'm certain I can find you
  the pilot," he said.</p>

  <p>"To put it bluntly," said Pinto, "would you take on an engagement for
  twelve months, secure the machine, house it and have it ready for me? I will
  pay you liberally." He mentioned a sum which satisfied the airman. "It must
  not be known that the machine is mine. You must buy it and keep it in your
  own name."</p>

  <p>"There's no difficulty about that," said Cartwright. "Am I to understand
  that I must go ahead with the purchase of the aeroplane?"</p>

  <p>"You can start right away," said Pinto. "The sooner you have the machine
  ready for a flight the better. I am here almost every night, and I will give
  orders to the collectors on the barrier that you are to come to me just
  whenever you want. If you will meet me here to-morrow morning, say at eleven
  o'clock, I can give you cash for the purchase of the machine, and I shall be
  happy to pay you half a year's salary in advance."</p>

  <p>"It will take some time to clear my old job," said Cartwright
  thoughtfully, "but I think I can do it for you. At any rate, I can get time
  off to buy the machine. You say that you do not want anybody to know that it
  is yours?"</p>

  <p>Pinto nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's easy," said the other. "I've been thinking about buying a
  machine of my own for some time and have made inquiries in several
  quarters."</p>

  <p>He rose to leave and shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Remember," said Pinto as a final warning, "not a word about this to any
  human soul."</p>

  <p>"You can trust me," said the man.</p>

  <p>Pinto watched the rest of the play with a lighter heart. After all, there
  could be nothing very much to fear. What had thrown him off his balance for
  the moment was the presence of Stafford King in Yorkshire, and when that
  detective chief did not make his appearance at the police inquiry nor had
  sought him in his hotel, it looked as though the colonel's words were true,
  and that Scotland Yard were after Boundary himself and none other.</p>

  <p>He sat the performance through and then went to his club&mdash;an
  institution off Pall Mall which had been quite satisfied to accept Pinto to
  membership without making any too close inquiries as to his antecedents.</p>

  <p>He spent some time before the tape machine, watching the news tick forth,
  then strolled into the smoking-room and read the evening papers for the
  second time. Only one item of news really interested him&mdash;it had
  interested the colonel too. The diamondsmiths' premises in Regent Street had
  been burgled the night before and the contents of the safe cleared. The
  colonel had arrested his flow of vituperation, to speculate as to the
  "artist" who had carried out this neat job.</p>

  <p>Pinto read for a little, then threw the paper down. He wondered what made
  him so restive and why he was so anxious to find something to occupy his
  attention, and then he realised with a start that he did not want to go back
  to face Colonel Boundary. It was the first time he had ever experienced this
  sensation, and he did not like it. He had held his place in the gang by the
  assurance, which was also an assumption, that he was at least the colonel's
  equal. This irritated him. He put on his overcoat and turned into the street.
  It was a chilly night and a thin drizzle of rain was falling. He pulled up
  his coat-collar and looked about for a taxi-cab. Neither outside the club nor
  in Pall Mall was one visible.</p>

  <p>He started to walk home, but still felt that disinclination to face the
  colonel. Then a thought struck him; he would go and see Phillopolis, the
  little Greek.</p>

  <p>Phillopolis patronised a night-club in Soho, where he was usually to be
  found between midnight and two in the morning. Having an objective, Pinto
  felt in a happier frame of mine and walked briskly the intervening distance.
  He found his man sitting at a little marble-topped table by himself,
  contemplating a half-bottle of sweet champagne and a half-filled glass. He
  was evidently deep in thought, and started violently when Pinto addressed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he said with evident relief. "I thought it was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who did you think it was? You thought it was the police, I suppose?" said
  Pinto with heavy jocularity, and to his amazement he saw the little man
  wince.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to Colonel Boundary?" asked the Greek irritably. "There
  used to be a time when anybody he spoke for was safe. I'm getting out of this
  country and I'm getting out quick," he added.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Pinto, who was vitally interested.</p>

  <p>The Greek threw out his hands with a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Nerves," he said. "I haven't got over that affair with the White
  girl."</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" said the other. "If the police were moving in that matter, they'd
  have moved long ago. You are worrying yourself unnecessarily,
  Phillopolis."</p>

  <p>Pinto's words slipped glibly from his tongue, but Phillopolis was
  unimpressed.</p>

  <p>"I know when I've had enough," he said. "I've got my passport and I'm
  clearing out at the end of this week."</p>

  <p>"Does the colonel know this?"</p>

  <p>The Greek raised his shoulders indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether he does or whether he doesn't," he said. "Anyway,
  Boundary and I are only remotely connected in business, and my movements are
  no affair of his."</p>

  <p>He looked curiously at the other.</p>

  <p>"I wonder that a man like you, who is in the heart of things, stays on
  when the net is drawing round the old man."</p>

  <p>"Loyalty is a vice with me," said Pinto virtuously. "Besides, there's no
  reason to bolt&mdash;as yet."</p>

  <p>"I'm going whilst I'm safe," said Phillopolis, sipping his champagne. "At
  present the police have nothing against me and I'm going to take good care
  they have nothing. That's where I've the advantage of people like you."</p>

  <p>Pinto smiled.</p>

  <p>"They've nothing on me," he said easily. "I have an absolutely clean
  record."</p>

  <p>It disturbed him, however, to discover that even so minor a member of the
  gang as Phillopolis was preparing to desert what he evidently regarded as a
  sinking ship. More than this, it confirmed him in the wisdom of his own
  precautions, and he was rather glad that he had taken it into his head to
  visit Phillopolis on that night.</p>

  <p>"When do you leave?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The day after to-morrow," said Phillopolis. "I think I'll go down into
  Italy for a year. I've made enough money now to live without worrying about
  work, and I mean to enjoy myself."</p>

  <p>Pinto looked at the man with interest. Here, at any rate, was one without
  a conscience. The knowledge that he had accumulated his fortune through the
  miseries of innocent girls shipped to foreign dance halls did not weigh
  greatly upon his mind.</p>

  <p>"Lucky you!" said Pinto, as they walked out of the club together. "Where
  do you live, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"In Somers Street, Soho. It is just round the corner," said Phillopolis.
  "Will you walk there with me?"</p>

  <p>Pinto hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will," he said.</p>

  <p>He wanted to see the sort of establishment which Phillopolis maintained.
  They chatted together till they came to the street, and then Phillopolis
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I go ahead?" he said. "I have a&mdash;friend there who
  might be worried by your coming."</p>

  <p>Pinto smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said. "I'll wait on the opposite side of the road until
  you are ready."</p>

  <p>The man lived above a big furniture shop, and admission was gained by a
  side door. Pinto watched him pass through the portals and heard the door
  close. He was a long time gone, and evidently his "friend" was unprepared to
  receive visitors at that hour, or else Phillopolis himself had some reason
  for postponing the invitation.</p>

  <p>The reason for the delay was explained in a sensational manner. Suddenly
  the door opened and a man came out. He was followed by two others and between
  them was Phillopolis, and the street-lamp shone upon the steel handcuffs on
  his wrists. Pinto drew back into a doorway and watched. Phillopolis was
  talking&mdash;it would perhaps be more accurate to say that he was raving at
  the top of his voice, cursing and sobbing in a frenzy.</p>

  <p>"You planted them&mdash;it is a plant!" he yelled. "You devils!"</p>

  <p>"Are you coming quietly?" said a voice. "Or are you going to make trouble?
  Take him, Dempsey!"</p>

  <p>Phillopolis seemed to have forgotten Pinto's presence, for he went out of
  the street without once calling upon him to testify to his character and
  innocence. Pinto waited till he was gone, and then strolled across the road
  to the detective who stood before the door lighting his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," he said, "has there been some trouble?"</p>

  <p>The officer looked at him suspiciously. But Pinto was in evening dress and
  talked like a gentleman, and the policeman thawed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very serious, sir," he said, "except for the man. He's a
  fence."</p>

  <p>"A what?" said Pinto with well-feigned innocence.</p>

  <p>"A receiver of stolen property. We found his lodgings full of stuff."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" gasped Pinto.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the man, delighted that he had created a sensation. "I
  never saw so much valuable property in one room in my life. There was a big
  burglary in Regent Street last night. A jeweller's shop was cleared out of
  about twenty thousand pounds' worth of necklaces, and we found every bit of
  it here to-night. We've always suspected this man," he went on
  confidentially. "Nobody knew how he got his living, but from information we
  received to-day we were able to catch him red-handed."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Pinto faintly, and walked slowly home, for now he no
  longer feared to meet the colonel. He had something to tell him, something
  that would inspire even Boundary with apprehension.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap29"
     id="chap29">XXIX. THE VOICE IN THE ROOM</a></h2>

  <p>As Silva anticipated, the colonel was up and waiting for him. He was
  playing Patience on his desk and looked up with a scowl as the Portuguese
  entered.</p>

  <p>"So you've been skulking, have you, Pinto?" he began, but the other
  interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"You can keep all that talk for another time," he said. "They've taken
  Phillopolis!"</p>

  <p>The colonel swept his cards aside with a quick, nervous gesture.</p>

  <p>"Taken Phillopolis?" he repeated slowly. "On what charge?"</p>

  <p>"For being the receiver of stolen property," said the other. "They found
  the proceeds of the Regent Street burglary in his apartments."</p>

  <p>The colonel opened his mouth to speak, then shut it again, and there was
  silence for two or three minutes.</p>

  <p>"I see. They have planted the stuff on him, have they?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Pinto.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose that Phillopolis is a fence, do you?" said the colonel
  scornfully. "Why, it is a business that a man must spend the whole of his
  life at before he can be successful. No, Phillopolis knows no more about that
  burglary or the jewels than you or I. The stuff has been planted in his
  rooms."</p>

  <p>"But the police don't do that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Who said the police did it?" snarled the colonel. "Of course they didn't.
  They haven't the sense. That's Mr. Jack o' Judgment once more, and this time,
  Pinto, he's real dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment!" gasped Pinto. "But would he commit a burglary?"</p>

  <p>The colonel laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Would he commit murder? Would he hang Raoul? Would he shoot you? Don't
  ask such damn-fool questions, Silva! Of course it was Jack o' Judgment. I
  tell you, the night you were in Yorkshire making a mess of that Crotin
  business, Jack o' Judgment came here, to this very room, and told me that he
  would ruin us one by one, and that he would leave me to the last. He
  mentioned us all&mdash;you, Crewe, Selby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly and scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"But not Lollie Marsh," he said. "That's queer, he never mentioned Lollie
  Marsh!"</p>

  <p>He was deep in thought for a few moments, then he went on:</p>

  <p>"So he's worked off Phillopolis, has he? Well, Phillopolis has got to take
  his medicine. I can do nothing for him."</p>

  <p>"But surely he can prove&mdash;" began Pinto.</p>

  <p>"What can he prove?" asked the other. "Can he prove how he earns his
  money? He's been taken with the goods; he hasn't that chance," he snapped his
  fingers. "I'll make a prophecy," he said: "Phillopolis will get five years'
  penal servitude, and nothing in the world can save him from that."</p>

  <p>"An innocent man!" said Pinto in amazement. "Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"But is he innocent?" asked the colonel sourly. "That's the point you've
  got to keep in your mind. He may be innocent of one kind of crookedness, and
  be so mixed up in another that he cannot prove he is innocent of either.
  That's where they've got this fellow. He dare not appeal to the people who
  know him best, because they'd give him away. He can't tell the police who are
  his agents in Greece or Armenia, or they'll find out just the kind of agency
  he was running."</p>

  <p>He squatted back in his chair, pulling at his long moustache.</p>

  <p>"Phillopolis, Crewe, Pinto, Selby, and then me," said he, speaking to
  himself, "and he never mentioned Lollie Marsh. And Lollie has been the decoy
  duck that has been in every hunt we've had. This wants looking into,
  Pinto."</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking there was a little buzz from the corner of the
  room and Pinto looked up startled. The colonel looked up too and a slow smile
  dawned on his face.</p>

  <p>"A visitor," he said softly. "Not our old friend Jack o' Judgment,
  surely!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Pinto.</p>

  <p>"A little alarm I've had fixed under one of the treads of the stairs,"
  said the other. "I don't like to be taken unawares."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is Crewe," suggested the other.</p>

  <p>"Crewe's gone home an hour ago," said the colonel. "No, this is a genuine
  visitor."</p>

  <p>They waited for some time and then there was a knock at the outer
  door.</p>

  <p>"Open it, Pinto," and as the other did not instantly move, "open it, damn
  you! What are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of anything," growled the Portuguese and flung out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>Yet he hesitated again before he turned the handle of the outer door. He
  flung it open and stepped back. He would have gone farther, but the wall was
  at his back and he could only stand with open mouth staring at the visitor.
  It was Maisie White.</p>

  <p>She returned his gaze steadily.</p>

  <p>"I want to see Colonel Boundary," she said.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, certainly," said Pinto huskily.</p>

  <p>He shut the door and ushered her into the colonel's presence. Boundary's
  eyes narrowed as he saw the girl. He suspected a trap and looked past her as
  though expecting to see an escort behind her.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected honour, Miss White," he said suavely, and he looked
  meaningly at the clock on the mantelpiece. "We do not usually receive
  visitors so late, and especially charming lady visitors."</p>

  <p>She was carrying a thick package, and this she laid on the table.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry it is so late," she said calmly, "but I have been all the
  evening checking my father's accounts. This is yours."</p>

  <p>She handed the package to the colonel.</p>

  <p>"That parcel contains banknotes to the value of twenty-seven thousand
  three hundred pounds," said the girl quietly; "it represents what remains of
  the money which my father drew from your gang."</p>

  <p>"Tainted money, eh?" said the colonel humorously. "I think you're very
  foolish, Miss White. Your father earned this money by legitimate business
  enterprises."</p>

  <p>"I know all about them," she said. "I won't ask you to count the notes,
  because it is only a question of getting the money off my own conscience, and
  the amount really doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"So you came here alone to make this act of reparation?" sneered the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>"I came here to make this act of reparation," she replied steadily.</p>

  <p>"Not alone, eh? Surrounded entirely by police. Mr. Stafford King in the
  offing, waiting outside in a taxi, or probably waiting on the mat," said the
  colonel in the same tone. "Well, well, you're quite safe with us, Miss
  White."</p>

  <p>He took up the package and tore off the wrapping, revealing two wads of
  banknotes, and ran his finger along the edges.</p>

  <p>"And how are you going to live?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"By working," said the girl; "that's a strange way of earning a living,
  don't you think, colonel?"</p>

  <p>"You'll never work harder than I have worked," said Colonel Dan Boundary
  good-humouredly. And, looking down at the money: "So that's Solly White's
  share, is it? And I suppose it doesn't include the house he bought, or the
  car?"</p>

  <p>"I've sold everything," said the girl quietly; "every piece of property he
  owned has been realised, and that is the proceeds."</p>

  <p>With a little nod she was withdrawing, but Pinto barred her way.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Miss White," he said, and there was a dangerous glint in his
  eye, "if you choose to come here alone in the middle of the night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The colonel stepped between them, and he swept the Portuguese backwards.
  Without a word he opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Miss White," he said. "My kind regards to Mr. Stafford King,
  who I suppose is somewhere on the premises, and to all the bright lads of the
  Criminal Intelligence Department who are at this moment watching the
  house."</p>

  <p>She smiled, but did not take his proffered hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," she said.</p>

  <p>The colonel accompanied her to the outer door and switched on all the
  stair lights, as he could from the master-switch near the entrance to his
  flat, and waited until the echo of her footsteps had passed away before he
  came back to the man.</p>

  <p>"You're a clever fellow, you are, Pinto," he said quietly; "you have one
  of the brightest minds in the gang."</p>

  <p>"If she comes here alone&mdash;" began Pinto.</p>

  <p>"Alone!" snarled the colonel. "I hinted a dozen times, if I hinted once,
  that she'd come with a young army of police. The first shout she made would
  have been the signal for your arrest and mine. Haven't you had your lesson
  to-night? How long do you think it would take Stafford King to trump up a
  charge against you and put you where the dogs wouldn't bite, eh?"</p>

  <p>He walked to the window and watched the girl. There was a taxi-cab waiting
  at the entrance, and as he had suspected, a man was standing by the door and
  followed the girl into the cab before it drove away.</p>

  <p>"She timed her visit. I suppose she gave herself five minutes. If she'd
  been here any longer, they would have been up for her, make no mistake about
  that, Pinto."</p>

  <p>The colonel drew down the blinds with a crash and began pacing the room.
  He stopped at the farther end and looked at the wall.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, I've often wondered why Jack o' Judgment damaged that wall?"
  he said. "He's got me guessing, and I've been guessing ever since."</p>

  <p>"You thought it was a freak?" said Pinto, glad to keep his master off the
  subject of his Huddersfield blunder.</p>

  <p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think it was that," he said. "It was not like Jack o'
  Judgment to do freakish things. He has an object in everything he does."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was to get you out of the room for the morning and make a
  search for your papers," suggested Pinto.</p>

  <p>Again the colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He knows me better than that. He knew very well that I would shift every
  document from the room and that there was nothing for his bloodhounds to
  discover." He thought a moment, pulling at his long, yellow moustache.
  "Maybe," he said to himself, "maybe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe what?" asked Pinto.</p>

  <p>"The workmen may have been up to some kind of dodge. They might have been
  policemen for all I know." He shrugged his shoulders. "Anyway, that's long
  ago, and if he'd made a discovery, why, I think we should have heard about
  it. Now, Pinto,"&mdash;his tone changed&mdash;"I'm not going to talk to you
  about Crotin. You've made a proper mess of it, and I ought never to have sent
  you. We have two matters to settle. Crewe wants to get out, and I think
  you're getting ready to bolt."</p>

  <p>"Me?" said Pinto with virtuous indignation. "Do you imagine I should leave
  you, colonel, if you were in for a bad time?"</p>

  <p>"Do I imagine it?" The colonel laughed. "Don't be a fool. Sit down. When
  did you see Lollie Marsh last?"</p>

  <p>Pinto considered.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen her for weeks."</p>

  <p>"Neither have I," said the colonel. "Of course she has an excuse for
  staying away. She never comes unless she's sent for. If we've got a mug we
  want to lead down the easy path, why, there's nobody in London who can do it
  like Lollie. And I understand you had some disagreement with the young lady
  over Maisie White?"</p>

  <p>"She interfered&mdash;" began Pinto.</p>

  <p>"And probably saved your life," remarked the colonel meaningly. "No, you
  have no kick against Lollie for that."</p>

  <p>He pulled open the drawer of his desk, took out a card and wrote
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>"I'll put Snakit on her trail," he said.</p>

  <p>"Snakit!" said the other contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"He's all right for this kind of work," said the colonel, alluding to the
  little detective whom he had bought over from Maisie White's service. "Snakit
  can trail her. He does nothing for his keep, and Lollie doesn't know him,
  does she?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Pinto absently. "If you believe that Lollie is
  double-crossing you, why don't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll write to you when I want any suggestions as to how to run my
  business," said the colonel unpleasantly. "Where does Lollie live?"</p>

  <p>"Tavistock Avenue," said Pinto. "I wish you'd be a little more decent to
  me, colonel. I'm trying to play the game by you."</p>

  <p>"And you'll soon get tired of trying," said the colonel. "Don't worry,
  Pinto. I know just how much I can depend upon you and just what your loyalty
  is worth. You'll sell me at the first opportunity, and you'll be dead about
  the same day. I only hope for your sake that the opportunity never arises.
  That's that," he said, as he finished the card and put it on one side. "Now
  what is the next thing?" He looked up at the ceiling for inspiration.
  "Crewe," he said, "Crewe is getting out of hand too. I put him on a job to
  trace 'Snow' Gregory's past. I haven't seen or heard of him for two days,
  either."</p>

  <p>Somebody laughed. It was a queer, little far-away laugh, but Pinto
  recognised it and his hair almost stood on end. He looked across at the
  colonel with ashen face, and then swung round apprehensively toward the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"I heard it&mdash;thank the lord!" said the colonel, and fetched a long
  sigh.</p>

  <p>Pinto gazed at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Why," he said in a low voice, "that was Jack o' Judgment!"</p>

  <p>"I know," said the colonel nodding; "but I still thank the lord!"</p>

  <p>He got up slowly and walked round the room, opened the door that led to
  his bedroom, and put on the light. The room was empty, and the only cupboard
  which might have concealed an intruder was wide open. He came back, walked
  into the entrance hall, and opened the door softly. The landing was empty
  too. He returned after fastening the door and slipping the bolts&mdash;bolts
  which he had had fixed during the previous week.</p>

  <p>"You wonder why I held a thanksgiving service?" said the colonel slowly.
  "Well, I've heard that laugh before, and I thought my brain was
  going&mdash;that's all. I'd rather it were Jack o' Judgment in the flesh than
  Jack o' Judgment wandering loose around my hut."</p>

  <p>"You heard it before?" said Pinto. "Here?"</p>

  <p>"Here in this room," said the colonel. "I thought I was going daft. You're
  the first person who has heard it besides myself." He looked at Pinto. "A
  hell of a prospect, isn't it?" he said gloomily. "Let's talk about the
  weather!"</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap30"
     id="chap30">XXX. DIAMONDS FOR THE BANK</a></h2>

  <p>There was no hope for Phillopolis from the first. The case against him was
  so clear and so damning that the magistrate, before whom the preliminary
  inquiry was heard, had no hesitation in committing him to take his trial at
  the Old Bailey on a charge of receiving, and that at the first hearing. Every
  article which had been stolen from the diamondsmiths' company had been
  recovered in his flat. The police experts gave evidence to the effect that he
  had been a suspected man for years, that his method of earning a living had
  on several occasions been the subject of police inquiry. He was known to be,
  so the evidence ran, the associate of criminal characters, and on two
  occasions his flat had been privately raided.</p>

  <p>The woman who passed as his wife had nothing good to say of him. It was
  not she who had admitted the police. Indeed, they found her in an upper room,
  locked in. Phillopolis was something of a tyrant, and on the day of his
  arrest he had had a quarrel with the woman, who had threatened to expose him
  to the police for some breach of the law. He had beaten her and locked her
  into an upper bedroom, and this act of tyranny had proved his downfall, if it
  were true, as he swore so vehemently that the articles which were found in
  his room had been planted there.</p>

  <p>The colonel was not present, nor were any other members of the gang, save
  little Selby, who had been summoned to the colonel's presence and had arrived
  in the early morning.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't a ghost of a chance," reported Selby, who had a lifelong
  acquaintance with criminals of the meaner sort, and had spent no small amount
  of his time in police courts, securing evidence as to the virtue of his
  proteges. "If he doesn't get ten years I'm a Dutchman."</p>

  <p>"What does Phillopolis say?"</p>

  <p>"He swears that the goods were not in his flat when he went out that
  night," he said, "but if they were planted, the work was done thoroughly. The
  detectives found jewel cases under cushions, hidden in cupboards, on the tops
  of shelves, and one of the best bits of swag&mdash;a wonderful diamond
  necklace&mdash;was discovered in his boot, at the bottom of his trunk."</p>

  <p>The conversation took place in the Green Park, which was a favourite haunt
  of the colonel's. He loved to sit on a chair by the side of the lake,
  watching the children sailing their boats and the ducks mothering their
  broods. He was silent. His eyes were bent upon the efforts of a small boy to
  bring a little waterlogged boat to a level keel and apparently he had no
  other interest.</p>

  <p>"Have a cigar, Selby," he said at last. "What is the news in your part of
  the world?"</p>

  <p>Selby was carefully biting off the end of his gift.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much," he said. "We got some letters the other day from Mrs.
  Crombie-Brail. Her son has got into trouble at the Cape. Lew Litchfield got
  them. He was doing a job in Manchester."</p>

  <p>Lew Litchfield was a bright young burglar of whom the colonel had heard,
  and he knew the kind of "job" on which Lew was engaged.</p>

  <p>"You bought 'em?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I gave a tenner for them," said Selby. "I don't think they're much
  use."</p>

  <p>The colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That's not the kind of letter that brings in money," he said. "You can't
  bleed a mother because her son got into trouble&mdash;at least, not for more
  than a hundred."</p>

  <p>"Letters have been scarce lately," said his agent disconsolately; "I think
  people have either given up keeping or writing them."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said the colonel. "Anyway, I didn't bring you down to talk about
  letters. I've work for you."</p>

  <p>Selby looked uneasy, and that in itself was a discouraging sign. Usually
  the little crook from the north hailed a job of any kind with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>It was an unmistakable proof to the colonel that he was losing grip, that
  the magic of his name and all that it implied in the way of protection from
  punishment, was less than it had been.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem very pleased," he said.</p>

  <p>Selby forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, colonel," he said, "I've a feeling they're after us, and I don't
  want to take any risks."</p>

  <p>"You'll take this one," said the colonel. "There's somebody to be put
  away."</p>

  <p>The man licked his lips.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not in it," he said. "I had enough with that Hanson
  business."</p>

  <p>"By 'put away' I don't mean murdered or ill-treated in any sense," said
  the colonel, "and besides, it is one of our own people."</p>

  <p>But even this assurance did not satisfy the man.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," he said; "they tell me that this Jack o'
  Judgment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just forget Jack o' Judgment for a minute and think of yourself," snapped
  the colonel. "You've made your pile, and you find England's getting a bit too
  hot for you, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," said the man fervently. "You know, colonel, I was thinking
  that a trip to America wouldn't be a bad idea."</p>

  <p>"There are plenty of places to go to without going to America," said the
  colonel. "I tell you that I mean Lollie no harm."</p>

  <p>"Lollie?" Selby was surprised, and showed it. "She hasn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what she's done yet, but I think it is time she went away,"
  said the colonel, "and so far as I can judge, it is time you went too, Selby.
  I don't know whether Lollie is betraying us, and maybe I'm doing her an
  injustice," he went on, "but if I put up to her a suggestion that she should
  leave the country, maybe she'd probably turn me down. You know how suspicious
  these women are. The only idea I can think of is to scare her and make her
  bolt quick and sudden, and I want you to provide the means."</p>

  <p>Selby was waiting.</p>

  <p>"I bought a motor-boat, one of those swift motor-boats that the Government
  used during the war. I have it ready at Twickenham, and you can get all your
  goods on board and go to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Anywhere you like," said the colonel, "Holland, Denmark&mdash;one place
  is as good as another, and it'll be a good sea-going boat. You see, my idea
  is this. If I think Lollie is negotiating to put us away, I can give her a
  fright which will make her jump at the means of getting out of England by the
  quickest and shortest route. You can go with her and keep her under your eye
  until the trouble blows over."</p>

  <p>He saw a look in the man's face and correctly interpreted it.</p>

  <p>"I'm not worried about <i>you</i> double-crossing me," he said, "even if
  you are abroad. I've enough evidence against you to bring you back under an
  extradition warrant." He laughed as Selby's face fell. "You see Selby,
  there's nothing in it that you can take exception to. I don't even know that
  Lollie will refuse to go in the ordinary way, but I must make
  preparations."</p>

  <p>"It is a reasonable suggestion," said Selby, after considering the matter
  for a few minutes. "I'll do it, colonel."</p>

  <p>"You'd better bring a couple of men to London who can handle Lollie if she
  gives any trouble&mdash;no, no," said the colonel, raising his hand in
  dignified protest, "there's going to be nothing rough. How can there be?
  You'll be in charge of it all, and it is up to you as to how Lollie is
  treated."</p>

  <p>It did not occur to Selby until an hour later to ask the colonel how he
  knew that his hobby was motor-boating, but by that time the colonel had
  gone.</p>

  <p>It was true, as Boundary said, that the gang was scared&mdash;and badly
  scared. It was equally true that they needed only one jar before it became a
  case of every man for himself. Already even the minor members were making
  their preparations to break away. The red light was burning clear before all
  eyes. But none knew how readily the colonel had recognised the signs, and
  how, in spite of his apparent philosophy and his contempt of danger, he, more
  than any of the others, was preparing for the inevitable crash.</p>

  <p>Jack o' Judgment, he told himself, was playing his game better than he
  could play it himself. The arrest of Phillopolis had removed one of the men
  who might have been an inconvenient witness against him. White was gone,
  Raoul was gone. He had planned the disappearance of Selby, a most dangerous
  man, and Lollie Marsh, an even more dangerous woman and there remained only
  Pinto and Crewe.</p>

  <p>When he had taken leave of his agent, the colonel walked to Westminster
  and boarded a car which carried him along the Embankment to Blackfriars. He
  might have been followed, and probably was, but this possibility did not
  worry him. He walked across Ludgate Circus, up St. Bride Street to Hatton
  Garden, and turned into the office of Myglebergs'. Mr. Mygleberg, a very
  suave and polite gentleman, received him and ushered him into a private room.
  This shrewd Dutchman had no illusions as to the colonel's probity, but he had
  no doubt either that the big man could pay handsomely for everything he
  bought.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you've come, colonel," he said; "I have been expecting you for a
  couple of days. We have just had a wonderful parcel of stones from Amsterdam,
  and I think some of them would suit you."</p>

  <p>He disappeared and came back with a tray covered with the most beautiful
  diamonds that had ever left the cutter's hands. The colonel went over them
  slowly, examining them and putting a selected number aside.</p>

  <p>"I'll take those," he said, and Mr. Mygleberg laughed.</p>

  <p>"They're the best," he chuckled. "Trust you to know a good thing when you
  see it, colonel!"</p>

  <p>"What have I to pay for these?"</p>

  <p>Mygleberg made a rapid calculation and put the figures before Colonel
  Boundary.</p>

  <p>"It is a big price," said the colonel, "but I don't think you have
  overcharged. Besides, I could always sell them again for that much."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mygleberg nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think you are wise to put your money into stones, colonel," he said;
  "they always go up and never go down in value. You can lose other things.
  They're easy and they're always convertible. I always tell my partner that if
  I ever become a millionaire I shall invest every penny in stones."</p>

  <p>The colonel paid for the gems from a thick wad of notes he took from his
  hip-pocket. They were, in point of fact, the identical notes which Maisie
  White had handed to him the night previous. He waited whilst the jewels were
  made up into a little oblong package, heavily sealed and inscribed with the
  colonel's name and address, and then, shaking hands with Mygleberg and fixing
  a further appointment, he came out into Hatton Garden, whistling a little
  song and apparently the picture of contentment.</p>

  <p>He was getting ready for flight too. This, the first of many packages
  which he intended depositing in the private safe of his bank, would go with
  the ever-increasing pile of American gold bonds of high denomination which
  filled that steel repository. For months the colonel had been converting his
  property into paper dollars. They were more easily negotiated and less
  traceable than English banknotes, and they were more get-at-able. A big
  balance in the books of the bank might be creditable and, given time,
  convertible into cash. Then nobody knew but himself the amount standing to
  his credit. He was not at the mercy of prying bank clerks or a manager who
  might be got at by the police. At a minute's notice, and without anybody
  being the wiser, he could demand the contents of his safe and walk from the
  bank premises without a soul being aware that he was carrying the bulk of his
  fortune away.</p>

  <p>He took a cab and drove now to the bank premises. Ferguson, the manager,
  received him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, colonel," he said. "I was just writing you a note. You know
  your account is getting very low."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said the colonel in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I thought you wouldn't realise the fact," said Ferguson, "but you've been
  drawing very heavily of late."</p>

  <p>"I'll put it right," said the colonel. "It is not overdrawn?" he asked
  jocularly, and Ferguson smiled.</p>

  <p>"You've eighty thousand pounds in Account B," he said. "I suppose you
  don't want to touch that?"</p>

  <p>Account B was the euphonious name for the fund which was the common
  property of all the leaders of the Boundary Gang.</p>

  <p>"Unless you're anxious that I should get penal servitude for fraudulently
  converting the company's funds?" said the colonel in the same strain. "No,
  I'll fix my account some time to-day. In the meantime" &mdash;he produced a
  package from his hip-pocket&mdash;"I want this to go into my safe."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Ferguson, and struck a bell. A clerk answered the call.
  "Take Colonel Boundary to the vaults. He wants to deposit something in his
  safe," he said, "or would you like me to do it, colonel?"</p>

  <p>"I'll do it myself," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>He followed the clerk down the spiral staircase to the well-lit vault, and
  with the key which the man handed him opened Safe No. 20. It was divided into
  two compartments, that on the left consisting of a deep drawer, which he
  pulled out. It was half filled with American paper currency, as he
  knew&mdash;currency neatly parcelled and carefully packed by his own
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I often wonder, Colonel Boundary," said the interested clerk, "why you
  don't use the bank safe. When a customer has his own, you know, we are not
  responsible for any of his losses."</p>

  <p>"I know that," said the colonel genially. "Still one must take a
  risk."</p>

  <p>He placed the package on the top of the money, pushed back the drawer,
  locked the safe and handed the key to the young man.</p>

  <p>"I think the bank takes enough risks without asking them to accept any
  more," he said, "and besides, I like to take a little risk myself
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"So I've heard," said the clerk innocently, and the colonel shot a
  questioning look at the young man.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap31"
     id="chap31">XXXI. THE VOICE AGAIN</a></h2>

  <p>He left the bank with the sense of having done his duty by himself. He had
  not planned the route by which he was leaving the country, or the hour. Much
  was to happen before he shook the dust of England from his feet, and as he
  had arranged matters he would have plenty of time to think things over before
  he made his departure.</p>

  <p>A great deal happened in the next few days to make him believe that the
  necessity for getting away was not very urgent. He met Stafford King in the
  Park one morning, and Stafford had been unusually communicative and friendly.
  Then the whispering voices in the flat had temporarily ceased, and Jack o'
  Judgment had given him no sign of his existence. It was five days after he
  had made his deposit in the bank that the first shock came to him. He found
  Snakit waiting on returning from a matinee, and the little detective was so
  important and mysterious that the colonel knew something had been
  discovered.</p>

  <p>"Well," he asked, closing the door, "what have you found?"</p>

  <p>"She is in communication with the police," said Snakit, "that's what I've
  found."</p>

  <p>"Lollie?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Marsh is the lady. In communication with the police," said the other
  impressively.</p>

  <p>"Now just tell me what you mean," said the colonel. "Do you mean she's on
  speaking terms with the policeman on point duty at Piccadilly Circus?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, sir," said Snakit with dignity, "that she's in the habit of
  meeting Mr. Stafford King, who is a well-known man at Scotland
  Yard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's well-known here too," interrupted the colonel. "Where does she meet
  him?"</p>

  <p>"In all sorts of queer places&mdash;that's the suspicious part of it,"
  said Snakit, who had joyously entered into the work which had been given to
  him, without realising its unlawful character.</p>

  <p>He had accepted without question the colonel's story that he was the
  victim of police persecution, and as this was the first news of any
  importance he had been able to bring to his employer, he was naturally
  inclined to make the most of it.</p>

  <p>"He has met her twice at eleven o clock at night, at the bottom of St.
  James's Street, and walked up with her, very deeply engaged in conversation,"
  said Snakit, consulting his note-book. "He met her once at the foot of the
  steps leading down from Waterloo Place, and they were together for an hour.
  This morning," he went on, speaking slowly, and evidently this was his
  tit-bit, "this morning Mr. Stafford King went to the Cunard office in
  Cockspur Street and booked cabin seventeen on the shelter deck of the
  <i>Lapland</i> for New York."</p>

  <p>"In what name?"</p>

  <p>"In the name of Miss Isabel Trenton."</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded. It was a name that Lollie had used before, and the
  story rang true.</p>

  <p>"When does the <i>Lapland</i> sail?" he asked, and again the detective
  consulted his book.</p>

  <p>"Next Saturday," he said, "from Liverpool."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said the colonel; "thank you, Snakit, you've done very well.
  See if you can pick them up to-night, or, stay&mdash;" He thought a moment.
  "No, don't shadow her to-night. I'll have a talk with her."</p>

  <p>The news disturbed him. Lollie was getting ready to bolt&mdash;that was
  unimportant. But she was bolting with the assistance of the police, who had
  booked her passage. That meant that they had got as much out of her as she
  had to tell, and were clearing her out of the country before the blow fell.
  That was not only important, but it was grave. Either the police were going
  to strike at once or&mdash;</p>

  <p>An idea struck him, and he telephoned through to Pinto. Another got him
  into touch with Crewe, and these three were in consultation when Selby came
  that afternoon.</p>

  <p>He arrived at an unpropitious moment, for the colonel was in a cold fury,
  and the object of his wrath was Crewe, who sat with folded arms and tense
  face, looking down at the table.</p>

  <p>"That gentleman business is played out, Crewe," stormed the colonel, "and
  I'm just about tired of hearing what you won't do and what you will do! If
  Lollie's put us away, she has got to go through it."</p>

  <p>"What use will it be, supposing she has?" said the other doggedly. "I
  don't for a moment believe she has done anything of the sort. But suppose she
  has given you away, what are you going to do? Add to the indictment? She's
  sick of the game and wants to get away somewhere where she can live a decent
  life."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you've been discussing it with her, have you?" said the colonel with
  dangerous calm. "And maybe you also are sick of the game and want to get away
  and live a decent life? I remember hearing you say something of that sort a
  few weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"We're all sick of it," said Crewe. "Look at Pinto. Do you think he's
  keen?"</p>

  <p>Pinto started.</p>

  <p>"Why do you bring me into it?" he complained. "I'm standing by the colonel
  to the last. And I agree with him that we ought to know what Lollie told the
  police."</p>

  <p>"She's told them nothing," said Crewe. "She isn't that kind of girl.
  Besides, what does she know?"</p>

  <p>"She knows a lot," said the colonel. "I'll put a supposition to you.
  Suppose she's Jack o' Judgment?"</p>

  <p>Crewe looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"That's an absurd suggestion," he said. "How could she be?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you how she could be," said the colonel; "she has never been
  with us when Jack made his appearance&mdash;you'll grant that?"</p>

  <p>Crewe thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"There you're wrong," he said; "she was with us the night Jack first
  came."</p>

  <p>The colonel was taken aback. A theory which he had formed was destroyed by
  that recollection.</p>

  <p>"So she was. That's right, she was there! I remember he insulted her. But
  I'm certain she's seen him since; I am certain she's been working
  hand-in-glove with him since. Who was the Jack who went to Yorkshire?"</p>

  <p>It was Crewe's turn to be nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment must be working with a pal," the colonel went on
  triumphantly, "and I suggest that that pal is Lollie Marsh."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!"</p>

  <p>The colonel looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"Who said that?" he demanded harshly.</p>

  <p>Crewe shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It was not me," he said.</p>

  <p>"Was it you, Selby?"</p>

  <p>"Me?" said the astonished Selby. "No, I thought it was you who said it. It
  came from your end of the table, colonel."</p>

  <p>The colonel got up.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong here," he said.</p>

  <p>"I've got it!" It was Pinto who spoke. "Did you notice anything peculiar
  about the voice, colonel?" he asked eagerly. "I did, the first time I heard
  it, and I've been wondering how I'd heard it before, and just now it has
  struck me. It was a gramophone voice!"</p>

  <p>"A gramophone voice?"</p>

  <p>"It sounded like a voice on a speaking machine."</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Now you come to mention it, I think you're right," he said; "it sounded
  familiar to me. Of course, it was a gramophone voice."</p>

  <p>They made a careful search of the apartment, taking down every book from
  the big shelf in one of the alcoves, and turning the leaves to discover the
  hidden machine. With this idea to guide them the search was more complete
  than it had been before. Every drawer in the desk was taken out, every scrap
  of furniture was minutely examined, even the massive legs of the colonel's
  writing table were tapped.</p>

  <p>Crewe took no part in the search, but watched it with a slight smile of
  amusement, and the colonel turning, detected this.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you grinning about?" he said. "Why aren't you helping,
  Crewe? You've got an interest in this business."</p>

  <p>"Not such an interest that I'm going to fool around looking for a
  gramophone voice that goes off at appropriate intervals," said Crewe.
  "Doesn't it strike you that it would have to be a pretty smart gramophone to
  chip in at the right moment?"</p>

  <p>The colonel pondered this a minute and then went back to his place at the
  table, mopping his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Pinto's right," he said; "the fellow has smuggled some fool machine into
  the flat, and we shall discover it sooner or later. I don't know how he
  controls it, or who controls it"&mdash;he looked suspiciously at
  Crewe&mdash;"or who controls it," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"You said that before," said Crewe coolly.</p>

  <p>The colonel had something on his lips to say, but swallowed it.</p>

  <p>"We'll meet here to-night at eleven. I told Lollie to come. Now, Crewe,"
  he said in a more gentle tone, "you're in this up to the neck, and you've got
  to go through with it. After all, your life and liberty are at stake as much
  as ours. If Lollie's played us false, we've got to be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lollie has not played you false, colonel," said Crewe. His face was very
  pale, the colonel noticed. "I like that girl, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So that's it," said the colonel, "a little love romance introduced into
  our sordid commercial lives! Maybe you know what she's been talking to
  Stafford King about?"</p>

  <p>Crewe did not immediately reply.</p>

  <p>"Do you?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"I know she has been trying to get out of the country, to break with the
  gang, but that she has given you or any of us away is a lie. Lollie's had a
  rotten life, and she's just sick of it, that's all. Do you blame her?"</p>

  <p>"There's no question of blaming her or praising her," said the colonel
  patiently; "the question is whether we condemn her or whether she still has
  our confidence, and that we shall know to-night. You will be present,
  Crewe."</p>

  <p>"I shall be present, you may be sure," said Crewe, and there was a look on
  his face which Pinto, for one, did not like.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap31"
     id="chap31">XXXII. LOLLIE GOES AWAY</a></h2>

  <p>It seemed to "Swell" Crewe that the scene was curiously reminiscent of a
  trial in which he had once participated. The colonel, at the end of the long
  table, sat aloof and apparently noncommittal, a veritable judge and a
  merciless judge at that. Pinto sat at his right, Selby on his left, and Crewe
  himself sat half-way between the girl at the farther end of the table and
  Pinto.</p>

  <p>Lollie Marsh had no doubt as to why she had been summoned. Her pretty face
  was drawn, the hands which were clasped on the table before her were
  restless, but what Crewe noticed more particularly was a certain untidiness
  both in her costume and in her usually well-coiffured hair. As though
  wearying of the part she had been playing, she was already discarding her
  makeup.</p>

  <p>"I hate to bring you here, Lollie, and ask you these questions," the
  colonel was saying, "but we are all in some danger and we want to know just
  where we stand with you."</p>

  <p>She made no reply.</p>

  <p>"The charge against you is that you've been in communication with the
  police. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"If you mean that I've been in communication with Mr. Stafford King,
  that's true," she said. "You told me to get into touch with him. Haven't I
  been for weeks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's a pretty good excuse," interrupted the colonel, "but it won't
  work, Lollie. You don't touch with a man like Stafford King and meet him
  secretly in St. James's Street. And you don't touch by seeing him for half an
  hour at a time, and I haven't heard of you ever getting off with a fellow to
  the extent of his paying for your passage to America."</p>

  <p>She started.</p>

  <p>"You know the way it is done. You did it before, Lollie," the colonel went
  on. "Now, you've got to be a good girl and tell us how far you've gone."</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the truth," she said. "I'm sick of this life, colonel. I
  want to go straight. I want to get away out of it all and
  &mdash;and&mdash;he's going to help me."</p>

  <p>"A social reformer, eh?" said the colonel. "I didn't know the police went
  in for that sort of stunt. And when did he take this sudden liking for you,
  Lollie?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a sudden liking at all," she said, "but I think it was
  because&mdash;well, because I stopped Pinto in the nursing home&mdash;and
  Miss White told him&mdash;I think that's all."</p>

  <p>The colonel looked down on his pad.</p>

  <p>"There's something in that," he said. "It sounds feasible. Didn't he
  question you?" he said, raising his eyes.</p>

  <p>"About you?" she said.</p>

  <p>"About us," corrected the colonel.</p>

  <p>"He asked me nothing about you, nothing about your habits or your methods
  or about any of our funny business. I'll swear it," she said.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to believe that, are you, colonel?" demanded Pinto. "You
  can see that she is lying and that she's double-crossing you?"</p>

  <p>"She's neither lying nor double-crossing us." It was Crewe who spoke. "I
  don't know what you think about it, colonel, but I am convinced that Lollie
  is speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>"You!" Pinto laughed loudly. "I think you're in a state of mind when you'd
  believe anything Lollie said. And anyway you're probably in with her."</p>

  <p>"You're a liar," said Crewe, so quietly that none suspected the surprising
  thing that would follow, for of a sudden his fist shot out and caught Pinto
  under the jaw, sending him sprawling to the floor.</p>

  <p>The colonel was instantly on his feet, his hand outspread.</p>

  <p>"That's enough, Crewe," he said harshly. "I'll have none of that!"</p>

  <p>Pinto picked himself up, his face livid.</p>

  <p>"You'll pay for that," he said breathlessly, but "Swell" Crewe had walked
  to the girl and had laid his hand on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Lollie," he said, "I'm believing you and I think the colonel is, too. If
  you're going out of the country, why I'll say good luck to you. You've made a
  very wise decision and one which we shall all make&mdash;some of us perhaps
  too late."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," said the colonel. He exchanged a glance with Selby and
  the man slipped quietly from the room. "Before we do any of that fare-
  thee-well stuff, I've got a few words to say to you, Lollie. I'm with Crewe.
  I think it is time you went out of the country, but you're going out my
  way."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Her hand clutched "Swell" Crewe's sleeve.</p>

  <p>"You're going out my way," said the colonel, "and I swear no harm will
  come to you. You're leaving to-night."</p>

  <p>"But how?" she asked, affrighted.</p>

  <p>"Selby will tell you. You'll meet him downstairs. Now be a sensible girl
  and do as I tell you. Selby will go with you and see you safe. We made all
  preparations for your departure to-night."</p>

  <p>"What's this, colonel?" asked Crewe.</p>

  <p>"You're out of it," said the colonel savagely. "I'm running this show
  myself. If you want to join Lollie later, why you can. For the present, she's
  going just where I want her to go and in the way I have planned."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand to the girl and she took it.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye and good luck, Lollie!" he said.</p>

  <p>"But can't I go back to my rooms?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>She stood at the door and for a moment her eyes met Crewe's and he moved
  toward her.</p>

  <p>"Wait."</p>

  <p>The colonel gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Lollie," and the door shut on the girl.</p>

  <p>"Let me go," said Crewe between his teeth. "If she trusts you, I don't.
  This is some trick of that dirty half-breed!"</p>

  <p>With a snarl of rage Pinto whipped his ever-ready knife from his hip
  pocket and flung it. It was the colonel who drew Crewe aside, or that moment
  was his last. The knife whizzed past and was buried almost to the hilt in the
  wall. The colonel broke the tense silence which followed.</p>

  <p>"Pinto," he said in his silkiest voice, "if you ever want to know what it
  feels like to be a dead man, just repeat that performance, will you?" Then
  his rage burst forth. "By God! I'll shoot either of you if you play the fool
  in front of me again. You dirty little pickpockets that I've taken from the
  gutter! You miserable little sneak-thieves!"</p>

  <p>He let loose a flood of abuse that made even Crewe wince.</p>

  <p>"Now sit down, both of you," he finished up, out of breath.</p>

  <p>He went to the window and looked out. The car which he had hired for the
  occasion was still standing at the door and he distinguished Selby talking to
  the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Listen you," he said, "and especially you, Crewe. You're too trusting
  with these females. Maybe Lollie's speaking the truth, but it is just as
  likely she's lying. I'm not going to take your corroboration, you know,
  Crewe," he said. "We've got to depend on her word. There's nobody else can
  speak for her, is there?"</p>

  <p>Before Crewe could speak the colonel was answered:</p>

  <p>"<i>Jack o' Judgment! Poor old Jack o' Judgment! He'll speak for
  Lollie!</i>"</p>

  <p>The colonel looked up with a curse. There was nobody in the room, but the
  voice had been louder than ever he had heard it before. It seemed as though
  it emanated from a disembodied spirit that was floating through the air.
  There was a knock at the outer door.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap33"
     id="chap33">XXXIII. WHERE THE VOICE LIVED</a></h2>

  <p>"Open it," said the colonel in a low voice; "open it, Crewe"&mdash;he
  pulled open the drawer and took out something&mdash;"and if it is Jack o'
  Judgment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Crewe opened the door, his heart beating at a furious rate, but it was
  Selby who came into the room and faced the half-levelled gun of the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked Boundary quickly. "You fool, I told you not to
  lose sight of her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But when is she coming down?" asked Selby. "I've been waiting there all
  this time and there's a policeman at the corner of the street&mdash;I
  wondered whether you had seen him too."</p>

  <p>"Not come down?" said the colonel. "She left here five minutes ago!"</p>

  <p>"She hasn't come down," he said, "and I've certainly not passed her on the
  stairs. Is there any other way out?"</p>

  <p>"No way that she could use," said the colonel shaking his head. "I've had
  new locks put on all the doors." He thought a moment. "If she hasn't come
  down she's gone up."</p>

  <p>They went up the stairs together and searched, first Pinto's flat, and
  then the store-rooms and empty apartments on the floor higher up.</p>

  <p>"Go down to the door and wait, in case she tries to get out," said the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>He returned to the room with the two men and they looked at one another in
  frank astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea what's happened, Crewe?" asked the colonel
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"No idea in the world," said Crewe.</p>

  <p>"But she went downstairs," said the colonel. "I heard the alarm
  click."</p>

  <p>"The alarm?" questioned Crewe.</p>

  <p>"I've got a buzzer under one of the treads of the stairs," said the
  colonel. "It is useful to know when people are coming up."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed and Selby returned to say that the policeman had been
  making inquiries as to whom the car belonged.</p>

  <p>"You'd better get it away," said the colonel, "and send away your
  men."</p>

  <p>"They've gone," said the other. "I wasn't taking any risks."</p>

  <p>He disappeared to carry out the colonel's instructions, and they heard the
  whine of the moving car.</p>

  <p>Boundary unlocked his tantalus and took out a full decanter of whisky.
  Without a word he poured three stiff doses into as many glasses and filled
  them with soda. Each man was thinking, and thinking after his own
  interests.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," said the colonel at last. "I incline to give this
  business best."</p>

  <p>He looked up and saw the dagger which Pinto had thrown. It was still
  embedded in the wall.</p>

  <p>"It isn't enough that I should have Jack o' Judgment messing my room
  about," he growled, "but you must do something to the same wall! Pull it out
  and don't let me see it again, Pinto."</p>

  <p>The Portuguese smiled sheepishly, walked to the wall and gripped the
  handle. Evidently the point had embedded in a lath, for the knife did not
  move. He pulled again, exerting all his strength and this time succeeded in
  extracting not only the knife but a large portion of the plaster and a strip
  of the wallpaper.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" said the colonel angrily, "see what you have done
  &mdash;Jumping Moses!"</p>

  <p>He walked to the wall and stared, for the dislodgment of plaster and paper
  had revealed three round black discs, set flush with the plaster and only
  separated from the room by the wallpaper, which had been stripped.</p>

  <p>"Jumping Moses!" said the colonel softly. "Detectaphones!"</p>

  <p>He took Pinto's knife from his hand and prised one of the discs loose. It
  was attached to a wire which was embedded in the plaster and this the colonel
  severed with a stroke of the knife.</p>

  <p>"This is the business end of a microphone," he said.</p>

  <p>"The voice!" gasped Pinto, and the colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I was mad not to guess that," he said. "That's how he heard
  and that's how he spoke. Now, we're going to get to the bottom of this."</p>

  <p>With a knife he slashed the plaster and exposed three wires that led
  straight downward and apparently through the floor. The colonel rested and
  eyed the debris thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What is under this flat? Lee's office, isn't it? Of course, Lee's!" he
  said. "I'm the fool!"</p>

  <p>He handed the knife back to Pinto, took an electric torch from his pocket
  and led the way from the flat. They passed down the half-darkened stairs to
  the floor beneath, on which was situated the three sets of offices. The
  colonel took a bunch of keys and tried them on the door of the surveyor's
  office. Presently he found one that fitted, and the door opened. He fumbled
  about for the electric switch, found it and flooded the room with light. It
  was a very ordinary clerk's office, with a small counter, the flap of which
  was raised. Inside the flap he saw something white on the floor, and,
  stooping, picked it up. It was a lady's handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"L," he read. "That sounds like Lollie. Do you know this, Crewe?"</p>

  <p>Crewe took the handkerchief and nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is Lollie's," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>"I thought so. This is where she was when we were looking for her. Here
  with Jack o' Judgment, eh? Let's try the inner office."</p>

  <p>The inner office was locked, but he had no difficulty in gaining
  admission. Inside this was a private office which was simply furnished and
  had in one corner what appeared to be a telephone box. He opened the glass
  door and flashed his lamp inside. There was a little desk, a pair of
  receivers fastened to a headpiece, and a small vulcanite transmitter.</p>

  <p>"This is where he sat," said the colonel meditatively, pointing to a
  stool, "and this&mdash;" he lifted up the earpieces&mdash;"is how he heard
  all our very interesting conversations. Go upstairs, Pinto, I want to try
  this transmitter."</p>

  <p>He fixed the receiver to his ears and waited, and presently he heard
  distinctly the sound of Pinto closing the door of the room upstairs. Then he
  spoke through the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear me, Pinto?"</p>

  <p>"I hear you distinctly," said Pinto's voice.</p>

  <p>"Speak a little lower. Carry on a conversation with yourself and let me
  try to hear you."</p>

  <p>Pinto obeyed. He recited something from the Orpheum revue, a line or two
  of a song, and the colonel heard distinctly every syllable. He replaced the
  earpieces where he had found them, closed the door of the box and that of the
  outer office, and led the way upstairs. The whisky still stood upon the table
  and he lifted a glass and drained it at a draught.</p>

  <p>"If you're a linguist, Crewe, you'll have heard of the phrase: <i>Sauve
  qui peut</i>. It means 'Git!' And that's the advice I'm giving and taking.
  To-morrow we'll meet to liquidate the Boundary Gang and split the Gang
  Fund."</p>

  <p>He turned his companions out to get what sleep they could. For him there
  was little sleep that night. Before the dawn came, he was at Twickenham,
  examining a big motor-launch that lay in a boat-house. It was the launch
  which should have carried Lollie Marsh and Selby on their river and sea
  journey. It was provisioned and ready for the trip. But first the colonel had
  to take from a locker in the stern of the boat a small black box and
  disconnect the wires from certain terminals before he stopped a little clock
  which ticked noisily. He had tuned his bomb to go off at four in the morning,
  by which time, he calculated, Lollie Marsh and her escort would be well out
  to sea. For the colonel regarded no evidence that might be brought against
  him as unimportant.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap34"
     id="chap34">XXXIV. CONSCIENCE MONEY</a></h2>

  <p>The colonel was sleeping peacefully when Pinto rushed into his bedroom
  with the news. He was awake in a second and sat up in bed.</p>

  <p>"What!" he said incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Selby's pinched," said Pinto, his voice shaking. "My God! It's awful!
  It's dreadful! Colonel, we've got to get away to-day. I tell you they'll have
  us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just shut up for a minute, will you?" growled the colonel, swinging out
  of bed and searching for his slippers with the detached interest of one who
  was hearing a little gossip from the morning papers. "What is the charge
  against him?"</p>

  <p>"Loitering with intention to commit a felony," said Pinto. "They took him
  to the station and searched his bag. He had brought a bag with him in
  preparation for the journey. And what do you think they found?"</p>

  <p>"I know what they found," said the colonel; "a complete kit of burglar's
  tools. The fool must have left his bag in the hall and of course Jack o'
  Judgment planted the stuff. It is simple!"</p>

  <p>"What can we do?" wailed Pinto. "What can we do?"</p>

  <p>"Engage the best lawyer you can. Do it through one of your pals," said the
  colonel. "It will go hard with Selby. He's had a previous conviction."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he'll split?" asked Pinto.</p>

  <p>He looked yellow and haggard and he had much to do to keep his teeth from
  chattering.</p>

  <p>"Not for a day or two," said the colonel, "and we shall be away by then.
  Does Crewe know?"</p>

  <p>Pinto shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't any time to run about after that swine," he said
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Well, you'd better do a little running now then," said the colonel. "We
  may want his signature for the bank."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to draw what we've got and I advise you to do the same. I
  suppose you haven't made any preparations to get away, have you?"</p>

  <p>"No," lied Pinto, remembering with thankfulness that he had received a
  letter that morning from the aviator Cartwright, telling him that the machine
  was in good order and ready to start at any moment. "No, I have never thought
  of getting away, colonel. I've always said I'll stick to the
  colonel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said the colonel, and there was no very great faith in Pinto
  revealed in his grunt.</p>

  <p>Crewe came along an hour later and seemed the least perturbed of the
  lot.</p>

  <p>"Here's the cheque-book," said the colonel, taking it from a drawer. "Now
  the balance we have," he consulted a little waistcoat-pocket notebook, "is
  L81,317. I suggest we draw L80,000, split it three ways and part
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"What about your own private account?" asked Pinto.</p>

  <p>"That's my business," said the colonel sharply. He filled in the cheque,
  signed his name with a flourish and handed the pen to Crewe.</p>

  <p>Crewe put his name beneath, saw that the cheque was made payable to
  bearer, and handed the book to the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Here, Pinto." The colonel detached the form and blotted it. "Take a
  taxi-cab, see Ferguson, bring the money straight back here. Or, better still,
  go on to the City to the New York Guaranty and change it into American
  money."</p>

  <p>"Do you trust Pinto?" asked Crewe bluntly after the other had gone.</p>

  <p>"No," said the colonel, "I don't trust Pinto or you. And if Pinto had
  plenty of time I shouldn't expect to see that money again. But he's got to be
  back here in a couple of hours, and I don't think he can get away before.
  Besides, at the present juncture," he reflected, "he wouldn't bolt because he
  doesn't know how serious the position is."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going, colonel?" asked Crewe curiously. "I mean, when you
  get away from here?"</p>

  <p>Boundary's broad face creased with smiles.</p>

  <p>"What a foolish question to ask," he said. "Timbuctoo, Tangier, America,
  Buenos Ayres, Madrid, China&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which means you're not going to tell, and I don't blame you," said
  Crewe.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked the colonel. "If you're a fool you'll tell
  me."</p>

  <p>Crewe shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"To gaol, I guess," he said bitterly, and the colonel chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you've answered the question you put to me," he said, "but I'm
  going to make a fight of it. Dan Boundary is too old in the bones and hates
  exercise too much to survive the keen air and the bracing employment of
  Dartmoor&mdash;if we ever got there," he said ominously.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Crewe.</p>

  <p>"I mean that, when they've photographed Selby and circulated his picture,
  somebody is certain to recognise him as the man who handed the glass of water
  over the heads of the crowd when Hanson was killed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was it Selby?" gasped Crewe. "I wasn't in it. I knew nothing about
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The colonel laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Of course you're not in anything," he bantered. "Yes, it was Selby, and
  it is ten chances to one that the usher would recognise him again if he saw
  him. That would mean&mdash;well, they don't hang folks at Dartmoor." He
  looked at his watch again. "I expect Pinto will be about an hour and a half,"
  he said. "You will excuse me," he added with elaborate politeness "I have a
  lot of work to do."</p>

  <p>He cleared the drawers of his writing-table by the simple process of
  pulling them out and emptying their contents upon the top. He went through
  these with remarkable rapidity, throwing the papers one by one into the fire,
  and he was engaged in this occupation when Pinto returned.</p>

  <p>"Back already?" said the colonel in surprise, and then, after a glance at
  the other's face, he demanded: "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Pinto was incapable of speech. He just put the cheque down upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Haven't they cashed it?" asked the colonel with a frown.</p>

  <p>"They can't cash it," said Pinto in a hollow voice. "There's no money
  there."</p>

  <p>The colonel picked up the cheque.</p>

  <p>"So there's no money there to meet it?" he said softly. "And why is there
  no money there to meet it?"</p>

  <p>"Because it was drawn out three days ago. I thought&mdash;" said Pinto
  incoherently. "I saw Ferguson, and he told me that a cheque for the full
  amount came through from the Bank of England."</p>

  <p>"In whose favour was it drawn?"</p>

  <p>Pinto cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"In favour of the Chancellor of the Exchequer," he said. "That's why
  Ferguson passed it without question. He said that otherwise he would have
  sent a note to you."</p>

  <p>"The Chancellor of the Exchequer!" snarled the colonel. "What does it
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Look here! Ferguson showed it me himself." He took a copy of <i>The
  Times</i> from his pocket and laid it on the table, pointing out the
  paragraph with trembling fingers.</p>

  <p>It was in the advertisement column and it was brief:</p>

  <p>"The Chancellor of the Exchequer desires to acknowledge the receipt of
  L81,000 Conscience Money from Colonel D. B."</p>

  <p>"Conscience money!"</p>

  <p>The colonel sat back in his chair and laughed softly. He was genuinely
  amused.</p>

  <p>"Of course, we can get this back," he said at last. "We can explain to the
  Chancellor of the Exchequer the trick that has been played upon us, but that
  means delay, and at the moment delay is really dangerous. I suppose both you
  fellows have money of your own? I know Pinto has. How do you stand,
  Crewe?"</p>

  <p>"I have a little," said Crewe, "but honestly, I was depending upon my
  share of the Gang Fund."</p>

  <p>"What about you, colonel?" asked Pinto meaningly. "If I may suggest it, we
  should pool our money and divide."</p>

  <p>The colonel smiled.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," he said tersely. "I doubt whether my balance at the bank
  is more than a couple of thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"But what about your private safe?" persisted Pinto. "A-ha! You didn't
  know I knew that, did you? As a matter of fact, Ferguson told me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What the devil does Ferguson mean by discussing my business?" said the
  colonel wrathfully. "What did he tell you?"</p>

  <p>"He told me that the package was received and that he had put it with the
  other in your safe."</p>

  <p>"Package!" The colonel's voice was quiet, almost inaudible. "The package
  was received! When was the package received?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," said Pinto. "He said it came along and he put it with the
  other. Now what have you got in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the colonel was walking towards his bedroom with rapid strides.
  Presently he reappeared with his hat and coat on.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, Crewe. We'll go down to the bank," he said. "You stay here,
  Pinto, and report anything that happens."</p>

  <p>When they were on their way he confided to the other:</p>

  <p>"I have a little money put aside," he said, "and I'm willing to finance
  you. You haven't been a bad fellow, Crewe. The only rotten turn you've ever
  done us is introducing that damned fellow, 'Snow' Gregory, and you didn't
  even do that, for I had met him before you brought him from Monte&mdash;which
  reminds me. Have you found out anything about him?"</p>

  <p>"I have a letter here from Oxford," said Crewe, putting his hand in his
  pocket. "I hadn't opened my letters when Pinto came. You'll find all the news
  there, if there is any news."</p>

  <p>He handed the envelope to the other and the colonel transferred it to his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"That'll keep," he said. "What was I talking about? Oh, yes, Gregory. The
  whole of this business has come about through Gregory. Gregory made Jack o'
  Judgment, and Jack o' Judgment has ruined us."</p>

  <p>He sprang from the taxi at the door of the bank with an agile step, and
  went straight to the manager's office. Without any preliminary he began:</p>

  <p>"What is this package that came for me yesterday, Ferguson?"</p>

  <p>The manager looked surprised.</p>

  <p>"It was an ordinary package, similar to that which you put in the safe the
  other day. It was sealed and wrapped and had your name on it. I rather
  wondered you hadn't brought it yourself, but it was put into your safe in the
  presence of two clerks."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see it," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>Ferguson led the way down the stairs to the vaults and snapped back the
  lock of Safe 20. As he did so Crewe was conscious of a faint, musty
  odour.</p>

  <p>"I smell something," said the colonel suspiciously.</p>

  <p>He reached his hand into the safe and pulled open the long drawer, and as
  he did so a cloud of sickly-smelling vapour rose from its interior. For the
  first time Crewe heard Boundary groan. He pulled the drawer out under the
  light and looked in. There was nothing but a black mass of pulp, out of which
  glinted and gleamed a dozen pin-points of light.</p>

  <p>With a howl of rage the colonel turned the contents upon the stone floor
  of the vault and raked it over with the end of his walking-stick. The
  diamonds were intact, and they at least were something; but the greater part
  of eight hundred thousand dollars was indistinguishable from any other kind
  of paper that had been treated with one of the most destructive acids known
  to chemical science.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap35"
     id="chap35">XXXV. IN A BOX AT THE ORPHEUM</a></h2>

  <p>The colonel wiped his burnt and discoloured hands after he had dropped the
  last diamond into a medicine bottle which the bank manager happened to have
  in the room.</p>

  <p>"That's something saved from the wreck, at any rate," he said.</p>

  <p>He had gone suddenly old, and his mouth trembled, as many a younger mouth
  had trembled in despair that Colonel Boundary might become a rich man.</p>

  <p>"Something saved from the wreck," he repeated slowly.</p>

  <p>The manager's grave eyes were fixed on his.</p>

  <p>"I'm not blaming you, Ferguson," said the colonel. "It was a plot to ruin
  me, and it succeeded."</p>

  <p>"What do you think happened?" asked the troubled Ferguson.</p>

  <p>"The second package was a box filled with a very strong acid," said the
  colonel. "Probably the box was made of soft metal, through which the acid
  would eat in a few hours. It was placed in the safe, and in time the
  corrosive worked through&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders and left the room without another word.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-five years' work that represents, Crewe," he said as they were
  driving back to the flat; "thirty-five years of risk and thought and
  organisation, and ended in pulp&mdash;stinking pulp&mdash;that burns your
  fingers when you touch it."</p>

  <p>He began to whistle and Crewe noticed with curiosity that he chose the
  "Soldiers' Chorus" from "Faust" for the dirge to his lost fortune.</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment!" he said wonderingly. "Jack o' Judgment! Well, he's had
  his judgment all right, and I'm going to have mine. You needn't tell Pinto
  what happened this morning. Leave him guessing. He's got a pretty thick
  bank-roll, and I'll agree to that grand scheme of his for sharing out."</p>

  <p>The thought seemed to cheer him, and by the time they reached the flat he
  was almost jovial.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the news?" asked Pinto eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Fine," said the colonel. "Everything is as it should be."</p>

  <p>"Stop rotting," growled the other. "What is the news?"</p>

  <p>"The news, my lad," said the colonel, "is that I've decided to agree to
  your unselfish suggestion."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said the unsuspicious Pinto.</p>

  <p>"That we should pool and divide."</p>

  <p>"Jack o' Judgment's got your money, too!" said Pinto, who cherished no
  illusions about the colonel's generosity.</p>

  <p>"How well he knows me!" said Boundary. "Now, come, Pinto, we're all in
  this, sink or swim. I told Crewe going down that I intended dividing; didn't
  I, Crewe?"</p>

  <p>"You said something like that," said Crewe cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Now we'll pool our money," said the colonel, "and split three ways. I'll
  make a fair proposition. We'll divide it into four and the man who puts in
  the most shall take two shares. Is it a bet?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," said Pinto reluctantly. "What is the truth about your
  money? Did Jack o' Judgment get it?"</p>

  <p>"I hadn't any money," said the colonel blandly. "I've about a thousand
  pounds hidden away in this room; that is all, if Jack hasn't been in."</p>

  <p>He unlocked the safe and made an inspection.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a little over a thousand, if anything. How much have you,
  Crewe?"</p>

  <p>"Three thousand," said Crewe.</p>

  <p>"That makes four thousand. Now what have you got, Pinto?"</p>

  <p>"I've about five thousand," said Pinto, trying to appear unconcerned.</p>

  <p>The colonel made a little whistling noise through his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Bring fifty," he said. "I'm dead serious, Pinto. Bring fifty!"</p>

  <p>"But how can I get it?" demanded the other frantically.</p>

  <p>"Get it," said the colonel. "It is highly probable that it will be of no
  use to any of us. Let us at least have the illusion of being well off."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>In greater leisure than either of her three companions in crime were
  exhibiting, Lollie Marsh was preparing to take her departure to New York. She
  was packing at leisure in her cosy flat on Tavistock Avenue, stopping now and
  again to consider the problem of the superfluous article of clothing&mdash;a
  problem which presents itself to all packers.</p>

  <p>Between whiles she arrested her labours to think of something else.
  Kneeling down by the side of her trunk, she would give herself up to long
  reveries, which ended in a sigh and the resumption of her packing.</p>

  <p>By the commonly accepted standards of civilisation she was a wicked woman,
  but there are degrees of wickedness. She had searched her mind to recall all
  the qualms she had felt in her long association with the Boundary Gang, and
  took an unusual pleasure in her strange recollection. She remembered when she
  had refused to be drawn into the Crotin fraud; she recalled her stormy
  interview with the colonel when she declined to take a part in the ruining of
  young Debenham.</p>

  <p>But mostly she was glad that she had never gone any farther to carry out
  the colonel's instructions in regard to Stafford King. Not that she would
  have succeeded, she told herself with a little smile, but she was glad she
  had never seriously tried. Her mind switched to Crewe and switched back
  again. Crewe's was the one face she did not wish to see, the one member of
  the gang that she put aside from the others and wilfully veiled. Crewe had
  always been kind to her, always courteous, her champion in all bad times, and
  yet had never made love to her. She wondered what had brought him down to his
  present level, and why a man possessed of education, and who at one time, as
  she knew, had been an officer in a crack regiment, should have fallen so
  readily under Boundary's influence.</p>

  <p>She made a little face and went on with her packing. She did not want to
  think about Crewe for obvious reasons. Yet, as he had said&mdash; But he
  hadn't said, she told herself. Very likely he was married, though that fact
  did not greatly trouble the girl. Such men as these have always a good as
  well as a bad past, pleasant as well as bitter memories, and possibly he
  included amongst the former the recollection of a girl whose shoelaces Lollie
  Marsh was not fit to tie.</p>

  <p>She took a delight in torturing herself with pictures of her own
  humiliation, though she may have counted it to the good that she was capable
  of feeling humiliated at all. She finished her trunk, squeezed in the last
  article and locked down the lid. She looked at her wrist watch &mdash;it was
  half-past nine. Stafford King had not asked to see her, and she had the
  evening free.</p>

  <p>She had only spoken the truth when she had told Boundary that the police
  chief had made no inquiries as to the gang. Stafford King knew human nature
  rather well, and he would not make the mistake of questioning her. Or perhaps
  it was because he did not wish to spoil the value of his gifts by fixing a
  price&mdash;the price of treachery.</p>

  <p>She wondered what the colonel was doing, and Pinto&mdash;and Crewe. She
  impatiently stamped her foot. She was indulging in the kind of insanity of
  which hitherto she had shown no symptoms. She looked at her watch again and
  then remembered the Orpheum. It was a favourite house of hers. She could
  always get a free box if there was one vacant, and she had spent many of her
  lonely evenings in that way. She had always declined Pinto's offer to share
  his own, and of late he had got out of the habit of inviting her.</p>

  <p>She dressed and took a taxi to the Orpheum. The booking office clerk knew
  her, and without asking her desires drew a slip from the ticket rack.</p>

  <p>"I can give you Box C to-night, Miss Marsh," he said. "That is the one
  above the governor's."</p>

  <p>The "governor" was Pinto.</p>

  <p>"Have you a good house?"</p>

  <p>The youth shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We're not having the houses we had when Miss White was here," he said.
  "What's become of her, miss?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Lollie shortly.</p>

  <p>She had to pass to the back of Pinto's box to reach the little staircase
  which led to the box above. She thought she heard voices, and stopping at the
  door, listened. Perhaps Crewe had come down or the colonel. But it was not
  Crewe's voice she heard. The door was slightly ajar, and the man who was
  talking was evidently on the point of departure, because she glimpsed his
  hand upon the handle and his voice was so distinct that he must have been
  quite near her.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;three o'clock in the morning. You can't miss the aerodrome. It is
  a mile out of Bromley on the main road and on the right. You will see three
  red lamps burning in a triangle."</p>

  <p>The aerodrome! She put her hand to her mouth to suppress an exclamation.
  Pinto was talking, but his voice was a mumble.</p>

  <p>"Very good," said the strange voice. "I can carry three or four passengers
  if you like. There's plenty of room&mdash;of course, if you're by yourself,
  so much the better. I shall expect you at three o'clock. The weather's
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>The door opened and she crouched against the wall so that the opening door
  hid her, and heard Pinto call the man back by name.</p>

  <p>"Cartwright!" she repeated. "Cartwright. A mile out of Bromley on the main
  road. Three lamps in a red triangle!"</p>

  <p>She was going to slip up the stairs, but the door had closed on
  Cartwright, and making a swift decision she passed the box and came again
  into the vestibule of the theatre. Presently she saw the man appear. She
  guessed it was he by the smile on his face, and when he said "Good night" to
  the attendant at the barrier she recognised his voice. She followed him but
  let him get outside the theatre before she spoke to him. Then suddenly she
  laid her hand on his arm: "Mr. Cartwright!"</p>

  <p>He looked round into her smiling face in surprise, taking off his hat.</p>

  <p>"That is my name," he said with a smile. "I don't remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm a friend of Mr. Silva," she said. "I've heard a lot about
  you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed?" said he.</p>

  <p>He was a little puzzled because he thought that the projected flight was a
  dead secret; and she guessed his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You won't tell Mr. Silva I told you? He begged me not to repeat it to
  anybody, even to you. But he's leaving to-morrow morning, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know an awful lot," she said, and then: "Won't you come and have supper
  with me? I'm starving!"</p>

  <p>Cartwright hesitated. He had not expected so charming a diversion, and
  really there was no reason why he should not accept the invitation. He was
  not due at Bromley until early in the morning, and the girl was young and
  pretty and a friend of his employer. It was she who hailed the taxi and they
  drove to a select little restaurant at the back of Shaftesbury Avenue.</p>

  <p>"You're not seeing Pinto&mdash;I mean Mr. Silva&mdash;again to- night, are
  you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not seeing him until&mdash;well, until I see him," he smiled
  again.</p>

  <p>"Well, I want to tell you something."</p>

  <p>He thought she was charmingly embarrassed, and in truth she was, to invent
  the story she had to tell.</p>

  <p>"You know why Mr. Silva is leaving England in such a hurry?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. She wished she knew too, or had the slightest inkling of the
  yarn which Pinto had spun. And then the man enlightened her.</p>

  <p>"Political," he said.</p>

  <p>"Exactly; political," she said easily. "But you will realise that it is
  not necessarily he himself who is making this flight."</p>

  <p>"I did understand that he was making the flight himself," said the aviator
  in surprise.</p>

  <p>"But"&mdash;she was desperate now&mdash;"has he never told you of the
  other gentleman who was coming, the other political person who really must go
  to Portugal at once?"</p>

  <p>"No, he certainly did not," said Cartwright; "he told me distinctly that
  he was going himself."</p>

  <p>The girl leaned back in her chair, baffled, but thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course, he told you that," she said with a knowing smile. "You
  see, there are some things he is not allowed to tell you. But do not be
  surprised if you have two passengers instead of one."</p>

  <p>"I shan't be surprised, I shall be pleased. The machine will carry half a
  dozen," said Cartwright readily, "but I certainly thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait till you see him," said the girl, waving a warning finger with mock
  solemnity.</p>

  <p>He found her a cheerful companion through the meal, but there were certain
  intervals of abstraction in her cheerfulness, intervals when she was thinking
  very rapidly and reconstructing the plan which Pinto had made. So he was one
  of the rats who were deserting the sinking ship and leaving the Colonel and
  Crewe to face the music. And Crewe&mdash;that was the thought uppermost in
  her mind.</p>

  <p>When she parted from the pilot she had only one thought&mdash;to warn the
  colonel of Pinto's treachery&mdash;and Crewe. And somehow Crewe seemed to
  bulk most importantly at that moment.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap36"
     id="chap36">XXXVI. LOLLIE PROPOSES</a></h2>

  <p>What should she do? It was her sense of loyalty which brought the colonel
  first to her mind. She must warn him. She went into a Tube station telephone
  box and rang through but received no answer. Her quest for Crewe had as
  little result. She drove off to the flat, thinking that possibly the
  telephone might be out of order or that they would have returned by the time
  she reached there, but there was no answer to her ring. She went out again
  into the street in despair and walked slowly towards Regent Street. Then she
  saw two people ahead of her, and recognised the swing of the colonel's
  shoulders. She broke into a run and overtook them. The colonel swung round as
  she uttered his name and peered at her.</p>

  <p>"Lollie!" he said in surprise, and he looked past her as though seeking
  some police shadow.</p>

  <p>"I have something important to tell you," she said. "Let us go up
  here."</p>

  <p>They turned into a deserted side street, and rapidly she told her
  story.</p>

  <p>"So Pinto's getting out, is he?" said the colonel thoughtfully. "Well, it
  is no more than I expected. An aeroplane, too? Well, that's enterprising. I
  thought of something of the sort, but there's nowhere I could go, except to
  America."</p>

  <p>He dropped his head on to his chest and was considering something.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Lollie," he said simply. "I'm glad that you didn't go with
  Selby&mdash;you would never have got to the Continent alive."</p>

  <p>He said this in an ordinary conversational tone, and the girl gasped. She
  did not ask him for an explanation and he offered none. Crewe, standing in
  the background, looked at the man with something like bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"And now I think you'd better make a real getaway, and not trust to the
  police," said the colonel. "Maybe with the best intentions in the world,
  Stafford King can't save you if I happen to be jugged. And you too, Crewe,"
  he turned to the other.</p>

  <p>"So Pinto is going, eh?" he bit his nether lip, "and that is why he
  promised to bring the fifty thousand to-morrow morning. Well, somehow I don't
  think Pinto will go," he spoke deliberately. "I don't think Pinto will
  go."</p>

  <p>"It is too dangerous for you to stop him&mdash;" began Crewe.</p>

  <p>"I shall not try to stop him," said the other; "there's somebody besides
  myself on Pinto's track, and that somebody is going to pull him down."</p>

  <p>"But why don't you escape, colonel?" she urged. "There is the aeroplane
  waiting at Bromley. We could easily persuade the man that Pinto had sent
  us."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You take your own advice," he said, "and clear out to-night. Get her
  away, Crewe. Don't worry about the police. You've got twenty-four hours in
  hand. This is Pinto's night," he said between his teeth. "Pinto &mdash;the
  dirty hound!"</p>

  <p>Slowly they paced the street together in silence. When they came to the
  end the colonel turned.</p>

  <p>"I want to shake hands with you, Lollie. I shook hands with you once
  before, intending to send you to a very quick decease. You're carrying your
  money with you, aren't you, Crewe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Good!" responded the colonel. "Now get away."</p>

  <p>He took no other farewell but turned abruptly and left them. Crewe was
  following him, but the girl caught his arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't go," she said in a low voice. "Don't you know the colonel
  better?"</p>

  <p>"I hate leaving him like this," he said.</p>

  <p>"So do I," said the girl quietly. "I've still got some decent feeling
  left. We're all in this together. We're all crooks, as bad as we can possibly
  be, and if he's used us we've been willing tools. What is your Christian
  name?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He looked at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Jack," he said. "What a weird question to ask!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?" she said with a laugh but a little catch in her throat. "Only
  we're to be comrades and stick to one another, and I hate calling you by your
  surname, so I'm going to call you Jack."</p>

  <p>It was his turn to be amused. They walked in the opposite direction to
  that which the colonel had taken.</p>

  <p>"You're very quiet," she said after a while.</p>

  <p>"Aren't I?" he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Have I offended you?" she asked quickly. "Was it wrong to call you Jack?
  Oh, yes, somebody else must have called you Jack."</p>

  <p>"No, no, it isn't that," he said, "but I haven't been called by my
  Christian name for years and years," he said wearily, "and somehow it seems
  to span all the bad times and take me back to the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The 'Jack' days?" she suggested, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>Then after another period of silence.</p>

  <p>"This is a queer ending to it all, isn't it?" he said, and her heart
  skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>"Ending?" she whispered. "No, no, not ending! It may be the beginning of a
  new life. I haven't got religious," she added quickly, "and I'm not getting
  sentimental. All my past life doesn't come up in front of me as it does in
  the story-books. Only I've just faith that there's something better in life
  than I've ever found."</p>

  <p>"I should think there is," said Crewe. "It couldn't be much worse, could
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't been bad," she said&mdash;"not bad like you probably think I
  have."</p>

  <p>"I never thought you were bad," he said. "You were just a victim like the
  rest of them. You were only a kid when you started working for the colonel,
  weren't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's a chance for you, Lollie. Your passage is booked and all
  that sort of thing&mdash;have you sufficient money?"</p>

  <p>"I've plenty of money," she said.</p>

  <p>"Fine!" He dropped his hand lightly on her shoulder. "There's a big, big
  chance for you, my girl."</p>

  <p>"And for you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"There is no chance for me at all," he said simply. "They'll take me and
  they'll take Pinto and last of all they'll take the colonel. It is written,"
  he added philosophically. "Why&mdash;why, what is the matter?"</p>

  <p>She stood stock-still and was holding on to his arm with both hands.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't say that, you mustn't say that!" she said brokenly. "It isn't
  finished for you, Jack. There's a chance to get out, and the colonel has told
  you there's a chance. He meant it. He knows much more than we do. If you've
  got murder on your soul, or something worse; if you feel that you're
  altogether so bad that there isn't a chance for you, that there's no goodness
  in your life which can be expanded, why, just wait and take what's coming.
  But for God's sake know your mind, and if you feel that in another land,
  with&mdash;with someone who loves you by your side&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her voice broke.</p>

  <p>"Why, Lollie," he said very gently. "You don't mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I'm just as shameless as I've ever been" she said, "but I'm not proposing
  to marry you, I'm not asking for anything save your friendship and your
  comradeship. I think people can love one another without&mdash;marrying and
  all that sort of thing; but do you&mdash;will you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will I go?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll go anywhere with that prospect in sight," and he slipped his arm
  round her shoulders, and, bending, kissed her on the cheek.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap37"
     id="chap37">XXXVII. THE FALL OF PINTO</a></h2>

  <p>Whilst Pinto was putting the finishing touches to his scheme of flight,
  the colonel paced his room, whistling the "Soldiers' Chorus" jerkily. He was
  restless and nervous, and rendered all the more irritable by the
  disappearance of his servant, a minor member of the gang, who had been a
  participant in every act of villainy, and who had been in charge of the
  arrangements for the abduction of Maisie White. Twice in the course of the
  evening he wandered through the hall, opened the outer door, and looked out
  on to the landing.</p>

  <p>On the first occasion there was nothing to see, but on the second it was
  only by the narrowest margin of time that he failed to detect a dark figure
  moving noiselessly up the stairs and disappearing on to the second landing.
  The man above heard the door open and close again, and stood watching. Then,
  when no sound reached him, he moved to the door of Pinto's flat, opened it,
  deposited the suit-case which he was carrying in the hall, and closed the
  door softly behind him.</p>

  <p>He was within for about a quarter of an hour, then he reappeared, and
  still carrying his suit-case, passed swiftly down the stairs and out into the
  street. The clock struck half-past nine as he disappeared, and a quarter of
  an hour later Stafford King received by special messenger a communication
  which gave him something to think about. He read it through twice, then
  called up the First Commissioner and gave him the gist of the
  communication.</p>

  <p>"That's the third time we've had this sort of message," he said.</p>

  <p>"The others have proved right," said the Commissioner's voice, "why
  shouldn't this?"</p>

  <p>"But it seems incredible," said Stafford in perplexity. "We've been
  watching these people for years and we've never found them with the
  goods."</p>

  <p>"I should certainly act on it, King, if I were you," said the
  Commissioner. "Let me know what happens. Of course, you may make a mistake,
  but you must take a chance on that."</p>

  <p>Pinto had a lot of business to do at the theatre that night. For a week he
  had not banked the theatre's takings, but had converted them into paper
  money, and now he took from his safe the last penny he could carry. It was
  half-past eleven when he came to his Club, where supper had been prepared for
  him. He paid the bill from notes he had taken from the bank that day.
  Presently the waiter came back.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but the cashier says that this note is a wrong
  'un."</p>

  <p>"A wrong 'un?" said Pinto in surprise, and took it in his hand.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt whatever that the man was right. It was the most
  obvious forgery he had ever handled.</p>

  <p>"Then I've been sold," he smiled; "here's another."</p>

  <p>He took the second note and examined it. That also was bad, as he could
  tell at a glance. In the tail pocket of his dress-coat he had the money he
  had taken from the theatre and was able to settle the bill. He was worried on
  the journey back to the flat. He had drawn a hundred pounds from the bank
  that morning in five-pound notes. He remembered putting them into his
  pocket-book and had no occasion to disturb them since. It was unlikely that
  the bank would have given him such obvious forgeries. He was stepping from
  the taxi when the awful truth dawned on him. The notes had been planted, the
  forgeries substituted for the good paper! He was putting his hand in his
  pocket, intending to take out the money and push it down the nearest drain,
  when he was gripped.</p>

  <p>"Sorry and all that," said a voice.</p>

  <p>He turned round shaking like an aspen.</p>

  <p>"Stafford King," he said dully.</p>

  <p>"Stafford King it is. I have a warrant for your arrest, Silva, on a charge
  of forging and uttering. Bring him up to his rooms."</p>

  <p>The colonel heard the noise on the stairs and came to the door. He stood,
  a silent spectator, watching with unmoved face the procession as it passed up
  to the floor above.</p>

  <p>"I want your key," said Stafford, and humbly the Portuguese handed it to
  him.</p>

  <p>Stafford opened the door and snapped on the light.</p>

  <p>"Bring him in," he said to the detective who held Pinto. "What room is
  this?"</p>

  <p>"My dining-room," said Pinto faintly.</p>

  <p>Stafford entered the room, turning on the light as he did so.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Pinto," he said.</p>

  <p>Pinto could only look.</p>

  <p>The table was littered with copper-plates and ink rollers. There was a
  thick pad of counterfeit money on one corner of the table, held down by a
  paper weight; little bottles of acids were scattered about, and near the
  table was a small lever press, so small that a man might carry it in a corner
  of his handbag.</p>

  <p>"I think I have got you, Pinto," said Stafford King, and Pinto Silva
  nodded before he fell limply into the arms of his captor.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Maisie White had gone to bed early and the bell rang three times before
  she awoke. She slipped into a dressing-gown, and, going to the window, leaned
  out. She looked down upon the upturned face of a girl and in spite of the
  distance and the darkness of the night, recognised her. The man who stood in
  the background, however, she could not for the moment place. Nevertheless,
  she did not hesitate to go downstairs.</p>

  <p>"Is that Miss White?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is Lollie Marsh, isn't it? Won't you come in?"</p>

  <p>Lollie was hesitant.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said after awhile and they went upstairs together. "I'm very
  sorry I disturbed you, Miss White, but it is a matter which can't very well
  wait. You know that Mr. Stafford King has been kind to me?"</p>

  <p>Maisie nodded. She was looking at the girl with interest and was surprised
  to note how pretty she was. She could not forget what Lollie Marsh had done
  for her that dreadful night at the nursing home, and if the truth be told,
  she had inspired the assistance which Stafford had been giving the girl.</p>

  <p>"Mr. King has booked my passage to America, as you probably know," Lollie
  went on, "but at the last moment I have been obliged to change my plans."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to hear that," said the girl. "I was hoping that you'd get away
  before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am hoping to get away before," Lollie smiled faintly. "But you see, one
  has to be very quick, because things are moving at such a rapid rate. They
  arrested Pinto to-night&mdash;we only just heard of it."</p>

  <p>"Arrested Silva?" said the girl in surprise. "That is news to me. What is
  the charge?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't quite understand what the charge was. I know he's arrested,"
  said Lollie. "The colonel has advised me to get out as quickly as I can. And
  there's a big chance for me, Miss White. I'm going to be married!"</p>

  <p>She blurted the words out, and Maisie stared at her. Somehow she had never
  thought of Lollie Marsh as a person who would get married, and it was amazing
  to see the confusion and shyness in which her confession had thrown her.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you with all my heart," said Maisie. "Who is the fortunate
  man?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you. Yes, I will," said the girl. "I'll trust you. I'm
  marrying Jack Crewe."</p>

  <p>"Crewe? I remember. Mr. King spoke about him. But isn't he one of
  the&mdash;isn't he a friend of the colonel?"</p>

  <p>Lollie nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but we're going away to-night. That is why I came to see you."</p>

  <p>Maisie White clasped the girl's hands in hers.</p>

  <p>"You yourself are facing a great happiness and a beautiful life," pleaded
  Lollie, her eyes filling with tears. "Can't you feel some sympathy with me?
  For I want love and happiness and security more even than you, because you
  have never known anything of the dreadful apprehensions and uncertainties
  such as I have passed through. And I want you to help me in this. I'm not
  going to ask you to influence Mr. King to do anything but his duty. But I
  want just a chance for Jack."</p>

  <p>Maisie shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I can promise that," she said. "Mr. King has always
  spoken of your friend as one of the least dangerous of the gang. When are you
  leaving?"</p>

  <p>"To-night."</p>

  <p>"To-night? But how?"</p>

  <p>"That's a secret."</p>

  <p>"But it is a secret I won't reveal," smiled Maisie.</p>

  <p>"By aeroplane," said Lollie after a moment's hesitation, and told the
  story of Pinto's preparation.</p>

  <p>"You'd better not tell me where you're going," warned Maisie, but she
  didn't stop Lollie in time. "Well, I wish you luck and I'll do my best for
  you." She stopped and kissed the girl.</p>

  <p>"There's one warning I want to give you, Miss White," said Lollie as she
  stood in the doorway. "The colonel is a desperate man and I don't think
  somehow that he's coming through this with his life. He's been a good friend
  of mine up to a point and according to his lights, but you've been good and
  Mr. King has been more than good. Beware of the colonel now that you have him
  at bay! That is all!"</p>

  <p>Then she was gone.</p>
<hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap38"
     id="chap38">XXXVIII. A USE FOR OLD FILMS</a></h2>

  <p>They brought Pinto Silva into the magistrate's court at Bow Street the
  following morning in a condition of collapse. The man was dazed by his
  misfortune, incapable of answering the questions which were put to him, or
  even of instructing the exasperated solicitor who had been with him for an
  hour.</p>

  <p>By the solicitor's side was a grey-faced, shrunken man, whose clothes did
  not seem to fit him and who at the end of the proceedings whispered something
  into the lawyer's ear. But the application which was made for bail was
  rejected. The evidence was too damning, and the knowledge that the prisoner
  was not English and that it would be impossible to extradite him if he
  managed to make his escape to certain countries, all helped to influence the
  magistrate in his refusal.</p>

  <p>Colonel Boundary did not speak to the man in the dock or as much as look
  at him. He got out of court after the proceedings had terminated, the
  cynosure of every policeman's eye, and drove back to his apartments. He had
  not heard from Crewe or Lollie that morning and he guessed that the two had
  left by aeroplane. So he was alone, he thought, and the very knowledge had
  the effect of stiffening him.</p>

  <p>He could go through the remainder of his papers at his leisure, without
  fear of interruption. The lesser members of the gang had been controlled by
  Selby or Crewe, and they would not approach him directly, but he did not
  doubt that there were a score of little men waiting to jump into the witness
  box the moment he was caught, but he had by no means given up hope of
  escaping.</p>

  <p>For days he had carried in his pocket the means of disguise, a safety
  razor, scissors and a small bottle of anatto solution to darken his face.</p>

  <p>Despite his sixty-one years, he was a healthy and virile man, capable of
  undergoing hardships if the necessity arose, but, above all, he had a plan
  and an alternative plan.</p>

  <p>He finished the destruction of his correspondence, and then began to
  search his pocket for any stray letters which he might have put away
  absent-mindedly. In making this search he came upon a long, white envelope
  addressed to Crewe, and wondered how it had come into his possession. Then he
  remembered that Crewe had handed him a letter.</p>

  <p>He looked at the postmark.</p>

  <p>From Oxford.</p>

  <p>This was the report of the agents whom Crewe had sent down to discover the
  names of the men who had left Balliol in a certain year. "Snow" Gregory, who
  had been found shot in the streets of London, was a Balliol man who had left
  Oxford in that year. It was certain that it was a relative of "Snow" Gregory
  who was called Jack o' Judgment and who had taken upon himself the task of
  avenging the man's death.</p>

  <p>What was "Snow" Gregory's real name? If he could find that, he might find
  Jack o' Judgment.</p>

  <p>Slowly, as though with a sense that the great discovery was imminent, he
  tore open the letter and pulled out the three foolscap pages, which, with a
  covering note, constituted the contents. There were two lists of names of
  graduates who had passed out in the year which, if "Snow" Gregory spoke the
  truth in a moment of unusual confidence, was the year of his leaving.</p>

  <p>The colonel's finger traced the lines one by one and he finished the first
  list without discovering a name which was familiar. He was half way through
  the second list when he stopped and his finger jumped. For fully three
  minutes he sat glaring at the paper open-mouthed. Then:</p>

  <p>"Merciful God!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>He sat there for the greater part of an hour, his chin on his hand, his
  eyes glued to the name. And all the time his active mind was running back
  through the years, piecing together the evidence which enabled him to
  identify, without any shadow of doubt, Jack o' Judgment.</p>

  <p>He rose and went to his bookcase and took down volume after volume. They
  were mostly reference books, and for some time he searched in vain. Then he
  found a Year Book which gave him the data he wanted, and he brought it back
  to the table and scribbled a few notes. These he read through and carefully
  burnt.</p>

  <p>He finished his labours with a bright look in his eye and strutted into
  his bedroom ten years younger in appearance than he had been that afternoon.
  He put out all the lights and sat for a little while in the shadow of the
  curtain, watching the street from the open window. At the corner of the block
  a Salvation Army meeting was in progress, and he was surprised that he had
  not noticed the fact, although this practice of the Salvationists holding
  meetings near his flat had before now driven him to utter distraction.</p>

  <p>Very keenly he scrutinised the street for some sign of a lurking figure,
  and once saw a man walk past under the light of a street lamp and melt into
  the shadow of a doorway on the opposite side of the road. He went into his
  bedroom and brought back a pair of night glasses, and focused them upon the
  figure.</p>

  <p>He chuckled and went out of the flat into the street, turning
  southward.</p>

  <p>He did not go far, however, before he stopped and looked back, and his
  patience was rewarded by the sight of a figure crossing the road and entering
  the building he had just left. The colonel gave him time, and then retraced
  his steps. He took off his boots in the vestibule and went upstairs quietly.
  He was half-way up when he heard the soft thud of his own door closing, and
  grinned again. He gave the intruder time to get inside before he too inserted
  his key, and turning it without a sound, came into the darkened hall. There
  was a light in his room, and he heard the sound of a drawer being pulled
  open. Then he gripped the handle, and, flinging the door open, stepped in.
  The man who was looking through the desk sprang up in affright.</p>

  <p>As Boundary had suspected, it was his former butler, the man who had
  deserted him the day before without a word. He was a big, heavy-jowled man of
  powerful build, and the momentary look of fright melted to a leer at the
  sight of the colonel's face.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tom," said Boundary pleasantly, "come back for the pickings?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that, guv'nor," said the other. "You don't blame me?"</p>

  <p>"I've been pretty good to you, Tom," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Ugh! I don't know that I've anything to thank you for."</p>

  <p>Here was a man who a month before would have cringed at the colonel's
  upraised finger!</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't you, Tom?" said Boundary softly. "Come, come, that's not very
  grateful."</p>

  <p>"What have I got to be grateful to you for?" demanded the man.</p>

  <p>"Grateful that you're alive, Tom," said the colonel, and the servant's
  face went hard.</p>

  <p>"None of that, colonel," he snarled; "you can't afford to talk 'fresh'
  with me. I know a great deal more about you than you suppose. You think I've
  got no brains."</p>

  <p>"I know you have brains, Tom," said the colonel, "but you can't use
  'em."</p>

  <p>"Can't I, eh? I haven't been looking after you for four or five years and
  doing your dirty work, colonel, without picking up a little
  intelligence&mdash;and a little information! You'd look comic if they put me
  in the witness box!"</p>

  <p>He was gaining courage at the very mildness of the man of whom he once
  stood in terror.</p>

  <p>"So you've come for the pickings?" said the colonel, ignoring his threat.
  "Well, help yourself."</p>

  <p>He went to the sideboard, poured himself out a little whisky and sat down
  by the window to watch the man search. Tom pulled open another drawer and
  closed it again.</p>

  <p>"Now look here, colonel," he said, "I haven't made so much money out of
  this business as you have. Things are pretty bad with me, and I think the
  least you can do is to give me something to remember you by."</p>

  <p>The colonel did not answer. Apparently his thoughts were wandering.</p>

  <p>"Tom," he said after awhile, "do you remember three months ago I bought a
  lot of old cinema films?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember," said the man, surprised at the change of subject.
  "What's that to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"There were about ten boxes, weren't there?"</p>

  <p>"A dozen, more likely," said the man impatiently. "Now look here,
  colonel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment, Tom. I'll discuss your share when you've given me a little
  help. Meeting you here&mdash;by the way, I saw you out of the window,
  skulking on the other side of the street&mdash;has given me an idea. Where
  did you put those films?"</p>

  <p>The man grinned.</p>

  <p>"Are you starting a cinema, colonel?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that," replied Boundary; "it was the Salvation Army that
  gave me the idea really. Do you hear what an infernal noise that drum
  makes?"</p>

  <p>The man made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"What is it you want?" he asked. "If you want the films, I put them in my
  pantry, underneath the silver cupboard. I suppose, now that the partnership's
  broken up, you don't object to me taking the silver? I might be starting a
  little house on my own."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, certainly, you can take the silver," said the colonel
  genially. "Bring me the films."</p>

  <p>The man was half-way out of the room when he turned round.</p>

  <p>"No tricks, mind you," he said, "no doing funny business when my back's
  turned."</p>

  <p>"I shall not move from the chair, Tom. You don't seem to trust me."</p>

  <p>The ex-valet made two journeys before he deposited a dozen shallow tin
  boxes on the desk.</p>

  <p>"There they are," he said, "now tell me what's the game."</p>

  <p>"First of all," said the colonel, "were you serious when you suggested
  that you knew something about me that would be worth a lot to the police?
  There goes that drum again, Tom. Do you know what use that drum is to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," growled the man. "Of course I meant what I said &mdash;and
  what's this stuff about the drum?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the people in the street can hear nothing when that's going," said
  the colonel softly.</p>

  <p>He put his hand in the inside of his coat, as though searching for a
  pocket-book, and so quick was he that the man, leaning over the table, did
  not see the weapon that killed him. Three times the colonel fired and the man
  slid in an inert heap to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, Tom," said the colonel,
  replacing the weapon; and turning the body over, he took the scarf-pin from
  his own tie and fastened it in that of the dead man. Then he took his watch
  and chain from his pocket and slipped it in the waistcoat of the other. He
  had a signet ring on his little finger and this he transferred to the finger
  of the limp figure.</p>

  <p>Then he began opening the boxes of old films and twined their contents
  about the floor, pinning them to the curtains, twining them about the legs of
  the chairs, all the time whistling the "Soldiers' Chorus." He found a candle
  in the butler's pantry and planted it with a steady hand in the heap of
  celluloid coils. This he lighted with great care and went out, closing the
  door softly behind him. Half an hour later, Albemarle Place was blocked with
  fire engines and a dozen hoses were playing in vain upon the roaring furnace
  behind the gutted walls of Colonel Dan Boundary's residence.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Stafford King was an early caller at Doughty Street, and Maisie knew, both
  by the unusual hour of the visit and by the gravity of the visitor, that
  something extraordinary had happened.</p>

  <p>"Well, Maisie," he said, "there's the end of the Boundary Gang &mdash;the
  colonel is dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" she said, open-eyed.</p>

  <p>"We don't know what happened, but the theory is that he shot himself and
  set light to the house. The body was found in the ruins, and I was able to
  identify some of the jewellery&mdash;you remember the police had it when he
  was arrested, and we kept a special note of it for future reference."</p>

  <p>She heaved a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"That's over, at last; it is the end of a nightmare," she said, "a
  horrible, horrible nightmare. I wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you wonder?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if this is also the end of Jack o' Judgment?" she asked. "Or
  whether he will continue working to bring to justice those people whom the
  law cannot touch."</p>

  <p>"Heaven only knows," said Stafford, "but I'll admit that Jack o' Judgment
  has been a most useful person so far as we are concerned. We should never
  have collected Pinto or Selby, or even the colonel, but for Jack. By the way,
  there is no news of Crewe and the girl."</p>

  <p>"I suppose they've reached their destination by now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, rather," said Stafford; "hours and days ago. Where were they going,
  by the way?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to tell you that."</p>

  <p>"You needn't," smiled Stafford. "They've gone to Portugal. It was Pinto's
  machine and I don't suppose he had any other idea in the world than to get
  back to his own beloved land. By the way, Pinto looks like getting ten years.
  To satisfy myself in regard to Crewe, I telegraphed to an Englishman at
  Finisterre, who is a good friend of mine and who lives in a wild and isolated
  spot somewhere near the lighthouse, and he sent me back a message to the
  effect that an aeroplane passed over Finisterre yesterday afternoon soon
  after lunch time. That must be friend Lollie."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, I hope they get away. Is that rather dreadful of me?" she
  said.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so. I believe the chief shares your hope. He has queer
  views on things, and they irritate me sometimes. For example, he doesn't
  think that the colonel is dead."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you had found the body?"</p>

  <p>"He gets over that by saying that it isn't the body," said Stafford with a
  little laugh of annoyance. "It rather worries you after you have decided that
  you've rounded up the gang. I still believe that it is the colonel."</p>

  <p>She thought a moment.</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to agree with Sir Stanley," said she. "It isn't the sort of
  thing that the colonel would do. Men like Colonel Boundary are never without
  hope."</p>

  <p>Stafford scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"Well, if it isn't the colonel, he's gone; and please the pigs, we'll
  never see him again! There is only the question of rounding up the little
  people of the gang, and that won't be much trouble."</p>

  <p>She put both her hands on his shoulders and looked at him smilingly.</p>

  <p>"You're an optimist, dear," she said.</p>

  <p>"Who wouldn't be?" he replied cheerfully. "You said that when the gang was
  wound up we would drop our sad and lonely lives apart and form a little gang
  of our own."</p>

  <p>She laughed and kissed him, and he went back to his office to find that
  his chief had already arrived and had asked for him. Sir Stanley was reading
  the morning paper when Stafford came into his room, and his first words
  brought consternation to the younger man.</p>

  <p>"Stafford," he said, "this is not the body of the colonel. I've just been
  to see it and I'm certain. Now, you've got to send a call out to all stations
  throughout the country, particularly the south of England, to look for a man,
  possibly clean-shaven, certainly without moustaches, who will be disguised as
  a tramp."</p>

  <p>"Why a tramp, sir?" asked Stafford with an heroic attempt to preserve an
  open mind on a subject where he had reached a definite decision.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen years ago," replied Sir Stanley, "when the colonel did most of
  his own dirty work, it was his favourite disguise. Search the casual wards,
  the common lodging-houses and the prisons. It is just likely that the colonel
  will commit a small offence, with the object of getting himself three months
  in gaol&mdash;there's no hiding-place like gaol, you know, Stafford. The real
  danger is that he may not actually tramp or assume the guise of the real
  low-down loafer. He may have the sense to become a poor but honest workman,
  travelling third-class from town to town in search of work. Then he will
  present the greatest difficulty." He saw the look of doubt on the young man's
  face and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You think he's dead, don't you?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm perfectly sure he is, sir," replied Stafford frankly.</p>

  <p>"An optimist to the last," smiled Sir Stanley and dismissed him with a
  nod.</p>

  <p>Later he was to come to Stafford's little bureau and tell him things which
  he did not know before. Then for the first time Stafford King discovered how
  closely his lackadaisical chief had followed the developments of the past few
  months. He learnt for the first time of the big part which Jack o' Judgment
  had played in the detection of the gang.</p>

  <p>"He had an office under the colonel's flat," said Sir Stanley. "Apparently
  it was bought with no other object than to provide our friend with an
  opportunity of spying on the colonel. He discoloured the wall, brought in his
  own workmen and in the colonel's absence&mdash;he was driven from the
  occupation of the room by the smell&mdash;he installed microphones. With the
  aid of these he was able to listen to all the conversation downstairs and
  sometimes to chime in. It was Jack o' Judgment who&mdash;well, perhaps I'd
  better not tell you that, because officially, I am not supposed to know it.
  At any rate, Stafford," he said more seriously, "we have seen the smashing of
  one of the most iniquitous, villainous gangs that ever existed. God knows how
  many broken hearts there are in England to-day, how many poor souls who have
  been brought to a suicide's grave through the machinations of Colonel
  Boundary and his tools. I do not think there has been a more immoral force in
  existence in our time, and I hope we shall never see its like again. You sent
  out the message?" he asked at parting.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I warned all stations and all chief constables."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Sir Stanley, and his last words were: "Don't forget
  &mdash;Boundary is not dead!"</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="chap39"
     id="chap39">XXXIX. JACK O' JUDGMENT REVEALED</a></h2>

  <p>A stoutish, grey-haired man descended from a third-class carriage at
  Chatham Station and inquired of a porter the way to the dockyard. He carried
  a lot of carpenter's tools in a straw bag and smoked a short clay pipe. The
  porter looked at the man with his white, stubby beard critically.</p>

  <p>"Trying to get a job, mate?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," said the man.</p>

  <p>"How old might you be?" demanded the porter.</p>

  <p>"Sixty-four," said the other, and the porter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You won't get work easy. They're not very keen on us old 'uns," he said.
  "Why don't you try at Markham's, the builders in the High Street? They're
  short of men. I saw a notice outside their yard only this morning."</p>

  <p>The workman thanked the porter, shouldered his basket and tramped down the
  High Street. He was respectably dressed, and policemen on the look-out for
  suspicious tramps did not give him a second glance. He spent the greater part
  of the day walking from yard to yard, everywhere receiving the same answer.
  Late in the afternoon he had better luck. A small firm of ship repairers were
  in want of a jobbing carpenter and put him to work at once.</p>

  <p>It was many years since Colonel Boundary had wielded a saw, but he made a
  good showing. After two hours' work, however, his back was aching and his
  hands were sore. He was glad when the yard bell announced the hour for
  knocking off. He had yet to find lodgings, but this did not worry him. He was
  careful to avoid the cheaper kind of lodging-house, and went to one which
  catered for the artisan, where he could get a room of his own and a clean
  bed. He paid a deposit, washed himself and left his tools, then went out in
  search of some refreshment.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock the next morning he was back at the yard. He thought
  several times during the day that he would have to throw the work up. His
  back ached furiously, his arms were like lead. But he persevered, and again
  another day drew to a close. By the third day he had got his muscles into
  play and found the work easy. He was asked by the foreman if he would care to
  go into the country to work at a house that the head of the firm was
  building, but he declined. He wanted to remain in the town where there were
  crowds. At the end of the week came his great chance. He had been sent down
  to the docks to do some repairs on a small steamer and had pleased the
  skipper, who was himself an elderly man, by the ability he had shown.</p>

  <p>"You're worth twice as much as some of these darned young 'uns," grumbled
  the old man. "Are you married?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Got any kids?"</p>

  <p>Boundary shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you sign on with me?" asked the skipper. "I want a carpenter
  bad."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Boundary, breathing more quickly.</p>

  <p>"We're going to Valparaiso first, then we're going to work down the coast,
  round the Horn to San Francisco and maybe we'll get a cargo across to
  China."</p>

  <p>"I'll think it over," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>That night he called on the captain and told him that he had made up his
  mind to go.</p>

  <p>"Good!" said the skipper, "but you'll have to sign on to-night. I'm
  leaving to-morrow by the first tide."</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded, not daring to speak. Here was luck, the greatest in
  the world. Nobody would suspect a carpenter, taken from a local firm and
  shipped with the captain's goodwill. At seven o'clock the next morning he was
  standing on the deck of the <i>Arabelle Sands</i>, watching the low
  coast-line slipping past. The ship was to make one call at Falmouth and two
  days later she reached that port. Boundary went ashore to buy some wood and a
  few tools that he found he needed, and pulled back to the ship in the
  afternoon. In the evening he accompanied the captain ashore.</p>

  <p>"We shan't leave till to-morrow at twelve," said the captain. "You might
  as well spend a night on solid earth whilst you can. It will be a long time
  before you smell dirt again."</p>

  <p>The captain's idea of a pleasant evening was to sit in the bar- parlour of
  the Sun Inn and drink interminable hot rums. He had fixed up a room for
  himself at the inn and offered Boundary a share, but the colonel preferred to
  sleep alone. He secured lodgings in the town, and making an excuse to the
  captain returned to his room early. He had purchased all the newspapers he
  could find and he wanted to study them quietly. It was with unusual relish
  that he read the account of an inquest on himself. There was no breath of
  suspicion that he was not dead.</p>

  <p>"Old Dan Boundary has tricked them all. Clever old Dan Boundary!"</p>

  <p>He chuckled at the thought. He had deceived all those clever men at
  Scotland Yard&mdash;Sir Stanley Belcom, Stafford King, Jack o' Judgment! Yes,
  he had deceived Jack o' Judgment and that seemed the least believable part of
  the affair. All the rest of the gang were captured or fugitives. He wondered
  whether Lollie Marsh and Crewe had reached Portugal and what they were doing
  there and how long their money would last and how they would earn more. He
  had his own money well secured. He had managed to get together quite a
  respectable sum, for there were other banks than the Victoria and
  City&mdash;odd accounts in assumed names which he had drawn upon on the very
  day of his supposed death.</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," said Boundary, thinking it was the landlady.</p>

  <p>He was in the middle of the room as he spoke, and he went back step by
  step as the visitor entered. His tongue clave to the roof of his mouth, his
  eyes were starting out of his head.</p>

  <p>"You! You!" he croaked.</p>

  <p>"Little Jack o' Judgment," said the mask mockingly. "Poor old Jack! Come
  to take farewell of the colonel before he goes to foreign parts!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" cried Boundary hoarsely. "I know you, damn you! I know you!"</p>

  <p>He pulled back the curtains and glared out of the window. There was no
  need to ask any further questions. The house was surrounded. He swung round
  again at his tormentor and faced the white mask in a blind fury of rage.</p>

  <p>"You're clever, aren't you?" he said. "Cleverer than all the police! But
  you weren't clever enough to save your son from death!"</p>

  <p>The masked figure reeled back.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's got you! Little Jack o' Judgment!" mocked the colonel. "That's
  got you where it hurts you most, hasn't it? Your only son, too! And he went
  to the devil all the faster because of me&mdash;me&mdash;me!" He struck his
  breast with his clenched fist. "You can't bring him back to life, can you?
  That's one I've got against you."</p>

  <p>"No," said Jack o' Judgment in a low voice. "I cannot bring him back to
  life, but I can destroy the man who destroyed him, who blighted his young
  life, who taught him vicious practices, who sapped his vitality with
  drugs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!" said the colonel. "Crewe picked him up at Monte Carlo,
  when he was on his beam-ends."</p>

  <p>"Who sent him to Monte Carlo?" asked the other. "Who was the gambler who
  brought him down, and received the wreck he had made with the pretence that
  he had never met him before? It was you, Boundary?"</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was a fool to deny it. I pretended to Crewe that I hadn't met him
  before. Yes, it was I, and I glory in it. You think you're going to pinch me,
  now, and put me where I belong&mdash;on the scaffold maybe. But you can never
  wipe that memory out of your mind, that you had a son who died in the gutter,
  that you're a childless old man who has no son to follow you!"</p>

  <p>"I can't wipe that out!" said Jack o' Judgment. "O, God! I can't wipe that
  out!"</p>

  <p>He raised his hand to his masked face as though to hide the picture which
  Boundary conjured up.</p>

  <p>"But I can wipe you out," he said fiercely, "and I've given my life, my
  career, my reputation, all that I hold dear to get you! I've smashed your
  schemes, I've ruined you, even if I've ruined myself. They're waiting for you
  downstairs, Boundary. I told them to be here at this very minute. Stafford
  King&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll never see me taken," said Boundary.</p>

  <p>Two shots rang out together, and the colonel sprawled back over the
  bed&mdash;dead.</p>

  <p>Propped against the wall was Jack o' Judgment, and the hand that gripped
  his breast dripped red. They heard the shots outside and Stafford King was
  the first to enter the room. One glance at the colonel was sufficient, and
  then he turned to the figure who had slipped to the floor and was sitting
  with his back propped against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Stafford. "Jack o' Judgment!"</p>

  <p>"Poor old Jack!" said the mocking voice.</p>

  <p>Stafford's arm was about his shoulder, and he laid the head gently back
  upon his bent knee. He lifted the mask gently and the light of the oil lamp
  which swung from the ceiling fell upon the white face.</p>

  <p>"Sir Stanley Belcom! Sir Stanley!" he softly whispered.</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley turned his head and opened his eyes. The old look of
  good-humour shone.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Jack o' Judgment!" he mimicked. "This is going to be a
  first-class scandal, Stafford. For the sake of the service you ought to hush
  it up."</p>

  <p>"But nobody need know, sir," said Stafford. "You can explain to the Home
  Secretary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sir Stanley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to see a greater Home Secretary than ever lived in Whitehall,"
  he said slowly. "I'm finished, Stafford. Strip this mummery from me, if you
  can."</p>

  <p>With shaking hands Stafford King tore off the black cloak and flung it
  under the bed.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Sir Stanley weakly, "you can introduce me to the provincial
  police as the head of our department and you can keep my secret,
  Stafford&mdash;if you will."</p>

  <p>Stafford laid his hand upon Sir Stanley's.</p>

  <p>"I told my solicitor," Sir Stanley spoke with difficulty, "to give you a
  letter in case&mdash;in case anything happened. I know I haven't played the
  game by the department. I ought to have resigned years ago when I found what
  had happened to my poor boy. I was Chief of Police in one of the provinces of
  India at the time, but they wouldn't let me go. I came to Scotland Yard and
  was promoted&mdash;no, I haven't played the game with the department. And yet
  perhaps I have."</p>

  <p>He did not speak for some time.</p>

  <p>His breathing was growing fainter and fainter, and when Stafford asked
  him, he said he was in no pain.</p>

  <p>"I had to deceive you," he said after awhile. "I had to pretend that Jack
  o' Judgment called on me too. That was to take suspicion from your
  &mdash;Miss White," he smiled. "No, I haven't played the game. I stood for
  the law, and yet&mdash;I broke that gang, which the law could not touch. Yes,
  I broke them! I broke them!" he whispered. "If Boundary hadn't known me I
  should have been gone before you came and resigned to-morrow," he said, "but
  he must have discovered the boy's name. I wonder he hadn't tried before. I
  smashed them, didn't I, Stafford? It cost me thousands. I have committed
  almost every kind of crime&mdash;I burgled the diamondsmiths', but you must
  give me your word you will never tell. Phillopolis must suffer. They must all
  be punished."</p>

  <p>Stafford had sent the police from the room, but the police-surgeon would
  not be denied. He had the sense to see that nothing could be done for the
  dying man, however, and that a change of position would probably hasten the
  end. He, too, went and left them alone.</p>

  <p>"Stafford, I have quite a lot of money," said the First Commissioner; "it
  is yours. There's a will... yours... ."</p>

  <p>Then he ceased to speak and Stafford thought that the end had come but did
  not dare move in case he were mistaken. After five minutes the man in his
  arms stirred slightly and his voice sounded strangely clear and strong.</p>

  <p>"Gregory, my boy, good old Gregory! Father's here, old man!"</p>

  <p>His voice died away to a rumble and then to a murmur.</p>

  <p>The tears were running down Stafford's face. He sensed all the tragedy,
  all the loneliness of this man who had offered so cheerful a face to the
  world. Then Sir Stanley struggled to draw himself to his feet, and Stafford
  held him.</p>

  <p>"Gently, sir, gently," he said, "you're only hurting yourself."</p>

  <p>The dying man laughed. It was a little shrill chuckle of merriment and
  Stafford's blood ran cold.</p>

  <p>"Here I am, poor old Jack o' Judgment! Little old Jack o' Judgment! Give
  me the lives you took and the hopes you've blasted. Give them to Jack... Jack
  o' Judgment!"</p>

  <p>They were his last words.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>A year later First Commissioner Sir Stafford King received a letter from
  South America. It contained nothing but the photograph of a very good-
  looking man, and a singularly pretty woman, who held in her lap a very tiny
  baby.</p>

  <p>"Here is the last of the Boundary Gang," said Sir Stafford to Maisie. "It
  is the one happy ending that has emerged from so much misery and evil."</p>

  <p>"Why, it is Lollie Marsh!"</p>

  <p>"Lollie Crewe, I think her name is now," said Stafford. "It was queer how
  Sir Stanley recognised the only human members of the gang."</p>

  <p>"Then they got away after all?" said the girl. "I've often wondered what
  happened at that aerodrome."</p>

  <p>Stafford laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," he said drily, "they got away. They left at twenty minutes past
  three, after a long argument with the aviator, a man named Cartwright."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sir Stanley and I watched them go off," said Stafford.</p>

  <p>He looked at the photograph again and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There were times when the Judgment of Jack was very merciful," he said
  soberly.</p>
