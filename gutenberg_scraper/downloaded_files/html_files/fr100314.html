  <p>It was now close on eight o&rsquo;clock and more than two hours ago since
  first the dawn broke over that low-lying horizon line which seems so far
  away, and tinged the vast immensity of the plain first with grey and then
  with mauve and pale-toned emerald, with rose and carmine and crimson and
  blood-red, until the sun&mdash;triumphant and glorious at last&mdash;woke
  the sunflowers from their sleep, gilded every tiny blade of grass and every
  sprig of rosemary, and caused every head of stately maize to quiver with
  delight at the warmth of his kiss.</p>
  <p>The plain stretched its limitless expanse as far as human eye can reach&mdash;a
  sea of tall straight stems, with waves of brilliant green and plume-crowned
  crests shimmering like foam in the sunlight.</p>
  <p>As far as human eye can see!&mdash;and further, much further still!&mdash;the
  sea of maize, countless upright stems, hundreds of thousands of emerald green
  sheaths crowned with flaxen tendrils like a maiden&rsquo;s hair; down on
  the ground&mdash;a carpet for the feet of the majestic corn&mdash;hundreds
  and thousands of orange-coloured pumpkins turning their huge shiny carcases
  to the ripening rays of the sun, and all around in fantastic lines, rows
  of tall sunflowers, a blaze of amber, with thick velvety hearts laden with
  seed.</p>
  <p>And all of it stretching out apparently to infinity beyond that horizon
  line which is still hidden by a silvery haze, impalpable womb that cradles
  the life-giving heat.</p>
  <p>Stately stems of maize&mdash;countless as the pebbles on a beach, as the
  specks of foam upon the crest of a wave, limitless as the sea and like the
  sea mutable, ever-changing, restless&mdash;bending to every breath of the
  summer breeze, full of strange, sweet sounds, of moanings and of sighs, as
  the emerald sheaths tremble in the wind, or down below the bright yellow
  carcases of the pumpkins crack and shiver in the growing heat.</p>
  <p>An ocean of tall maize and gaily-coloured pumpkins as far as the eye can
  reach, and long, dividing lines of amber-coloured sunflowers, vivid and riotous,
  flaunting their crude colouring in the glowing sunlight.</p>
  <p>Here and there the dull, dark green of hemp breaks the unvarying stretches
  of maize, and far away there is a tanya (cottage) with a group of stunted
  acacias near it, and a well whose tall, gaunt arm stretches weirdly up to
  the sky, whilst to the south the sluggish Maros winds its slow course lazily
  toward the parent stream.</p>
  <p>An ocean of maize and of pumpkins and of sunflowers, with here and there
  the tall, crested stems of hemp, and above it the sky&mdash;blue and already
  glowing through the filmy mist which every minute grows more ethereal and
  more impalpable as veil upon veil of heat-holding vapours are drawn from
  before its face.</p>
  <p>A beautiful morning in mid-September, and yet in all this vast immensity
  of fertile land and ripening fruit there is no sign of human toil, no sound
  of beast or creaking waggon, no sign of human life around that distant tanya.</p>
  <p>The tiny lizard in his comfortable position on the summit of a gigantic
  pumpkin can continue his matutinal sleep in peace; the stork can continue
  undisturbed his preparations for his impending long voyage over seas. Man
  has not yet thought to break by travail or by song the peaceful silence of
  the plain.</p>
  <p>And yet the village lies not very far away, close to the Maros; the small,
  low, hemp-thatched houses scarcely peep above the sea of tall-stemmed maize,
  only the white-washed tower of the church with its red-painted roof stands
  out clear and abrupt against the sky.</p>
  <p>And now the sharp, cracked sound of the Elevation bell breaks the silence
  of the summer&rsquo;s morning. The good Pater Bonif&aacute;cius is saying
  Mass; he, at any rate, is astir and busy with his day&rsquo;s work and obligations.
  Surely it is strange that at so late an hour in mid-September, with the maize
  waiting to be gathered in, the population of Marosfalva should still be absent
  from the fields.</p>
  <p>Hej! But stranger, what would you! Such a day is this fourteenth of September.</p>
  <p>What? You did not know it? The fourteenth of September, the ugliest, blackest,
  most God-forsaken day in the whole year!</p>
  <p>You did not know? You cannot guess? Then what kind of a stranger are you
  if you do not know that on this hideous fourteenth of September all the finest
  lads of Marosfalva and the villages around are taken away by the abominable
  government? Away for three years to be made into soldiers, to drill and to
  march, to carry guns and bayonets, to obey words of command that they don&rsquo;t
  understand, to be packed off from place to place&mdash;from Arad to Bistricz,
  from Kecskem&eacute;t to Nagyv&aacute;rad, aye? and as far as Bosnia too&mdash;wherever
  that may be!</p>
  <p>Yes, kind Sir! the lads of Marosfalva and of Fekete, of Kender and of G&ouml;rcz,
  are taken away just like that, in batches every year, packed into one of
  those detestable railways like so many heads of cattle and separated from
  their mothers, their sisters, their sweethearts, all because a hateful government
  for which the people of Marosfalva do not care one brass fill&eacute;r, has
  so decreed it.</p>
  <p>Mind you, it is the same in all the other villages, and in every town in
  Hungary&mdash;so at least we have been given to understand&mdash;but we have
  nothing to do with other villages or with the towns: they do just as the
  good God wills them to do. It is our lads&mdash;the lads of Marosfalva and
  Kender and Fekete and G&ouml;rcz&mdash;who have to be packed off in train-loads
  to-day and taken away from us for three years.</p>
  <p>Three years! Why, the lad is a mere child when he goes&mdash;one-and-twenty
  on his last birthday, bless him!&mdash;still wanting a mother&rsquo;s care
  of his stomach and his clothes, and a father&rsquo;s heavy stick across his
  back from time to time to keep him from drink and too much love-making.</p>
  <p>Three years! When he comes back he is a man, has notions of his own, has
  seen the world and cares no more about his native village and the narrow
  cottage where he used to run in and out bare-footed, bare-chested, bare-headed
  and comfortably dirty from head to foot.</p>
  <p>Three years! And what are the chances that he come back at all? Bosnia?
  Where in the world is that? And if you are a soldier, why then you go to
  war, you get shot at, killed may be, or at any rate maimed. Three years!
  You may never come back! And when you do you are not the same youngster whom
  your mother kissed, your father whacked, and your sweetheart wept over.</p>
  <p>Three years! Nay, but &rsquo;tis a lifetime. Mother is old, she may never
  see her son again. Girls are vain and fickle, they will turn their thoughts
  in other directions&mdash;there are the men who have done their military
  service, who have paid their toll to the abominable government up at Budapest
  and who are therefore free to court and free to marry.</p>
  <p>Aye! Aye! That&rsquo;s how it is. They must go through with it, though they
  hate it all&mdash;every moment of it. They hate to be packed into railway
  carriages like so many dried heads of maize in a barn, they hate to wear
  the heavy cloth clothes, the hard boots, the leather pouches and belts. My
  God, how they hate it!</p>
  <p>And the rude alien sergeant, with his &ldquo;Vorw&auml;rts!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marsch!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rechts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Links&rdquo;&mdash;I
  ask you in the name of the Holy Virgin what kind of gibberish is that?</p>
  <p>But they must all go!&mdash;all those, at least, who are whole and sound
  in body. Bless them! They are sound enough when they go! It is when they
  come back! . . .</p>
  <p>Yes! They must all go, those who are sound in eyes and wind and limb, and
  it is very difficult to cheat the commission who come to take our lads away.
  There was Benk&oacute;, for instance; he starved himself for three months
  this summer, hoping to reduce his chest measurements by a few needful centim&egrave;tres;
  but it was no use. The doctor who examined him said that with regular food
  and plenty of exercise he would soon put on more flesh, and he would get
  both for the next three years. And J&aacute;nos&mdash;you remember?&mdash;he
  chopped off one of his toes&mdash;thinking that would get him off those hated
  three years of service; but it seems there is a new decree by which the lads
  need not be possessed of all ten toes in order to serve the hateful government.</p>
  <p>No, no! It is no use trying to get out of it. They measure you, and bang
  your chest and your back, they look at your eyes and make you open your mouth
  to look at your teeth, but anyhow they take you away for three years.</p>
  <p>They make you swear that you will faithfully serve your country and your
  King during that time, that you will obey your superiors, and follow your
  leader wherever he may command, over land and by water. By water! I ask you!
  When there was Albert and Jen&ouml; who could not bear even the sight of
  water; they would not have gone in a boat on the Maros if you had offered
  them a gold piece each! How could they swear that they would follow some
  fool of a German officer on water?</p>
  <p>They could not swear that. They knew they could not do it. But they were
  clapped in prison like common malefactors and treated like brigands and thieves
  until they did swear. And after that&mdash;well! they had once to cross the
  Theiss in a ferry-boat&mdash;they were made to do it!</p>
  <p>Oh, no! Nothing happened to them then, but Albert came back after his three
  years&rsquo; service, with two of his front teeth gone, and we all know that
  Jen&ouml; now is little better than an idiot.</p>
  <p>So now you know, stranger, why we at Marosfalva call the fourteenth day
  of September the very blackest in the whole calendar, and why at eight o&rsquo;clock
  in the morning nobody is at work in the fields.</p>
  <p>For the fourteenth day being such a black one, we must all make the most
  of the few hours that come before it. At nine o&rsquo;clock of that miserable
  morning the packing of our lads into the train will commence, but until then
  they are making merry, bless them! They are true Hungarians, you know! They
  will dance, and they will sing, they will listen to gipsy music and kiss
  the girls so long as there is breath in their body, so long as they are free
  to do it.</p>
  <p>At nine o&rsquo;clock to-day they cease to be free men, they are under the
  orders of corporals and sergeants and officers who will command them to go &ldquo;Vorw&auml;rts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rechts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Links&rdquo; and
  all that God-forsaken gibberish, and put them in irons and on bread and water
  if they do not obey. But yesterday, on the thirteenth of September that is,
  they were still free to do as they liked: they could dance and sing and get
  drunk as much as they chose.</p>
  <p>So the big barn that belongs to Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein, the Jew, is thrown
  open for a night&rsquo;s dancing and music and jollification. At five o&rsquo;clock
  in the afternoon the gipsies tuned up; there was a supper which lasted many
  hours, after which the dancing began. The first cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s was
  struck up at eight o&rsquo;clock last evening, the last one is being danced
  now at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, while the whole plain lies in
  silence under the shimmering sky, and while Pater Bonif&aacute;cius reads
  his mass all alone in the little church, and prays fervently for the lads
  who are going away to-day for three years: away from his care and his tender,
  paternal attention, away from their homes, their weeping mothers and sorrowing
  sweethearts.</p>
  <p>God bless them all! They are good lads, but weak, impulsive, easily led
  toward good or evil. They are dancing now, when they should be praying, but
  God bless them all! They are good lads!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;Money Won&rsquo;t Buy Everything.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Inside the barn the guttering candles were burning low. No one thought of
  blowing them out, so they were just left to smoke and to smoulder, and to
  help render the atmosphere even more stifling than it otherwise would have
  been.</p>
  <p>The heat has become almost unbearable&mdash;unbearable, that is, to anyone
  not wholly intent on pleasure to the exclusion of every other sensation,
  every other consciousness. The barn built of huge pine logs, straw-thatched
  and raftered, is filled to overflowing with people&mdash;men, women, even
  children&mdash;all bent upon one great, all-absorbing object&mdash;that object,
  forgetfulness.</p>
  <p>The indifferent, the stolid, may call it what he will, but it is the common
  wish to forget that has brought all these people&mdash;young and old&mdash;together
  in Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s barn this night&mdash;the desire to forget
  that hideous, fateful fourteenth of September which comes with such heartrending
  regularity year after year&mdash;the desire to forget that the lads, the
  flower of the neighbouring villages, are going away to-day . . . for three
  years?&mdash;nay! very likely for ever!&mdash;three years! and all packed
  up like cattle in a railway truck! and put under the orders of some brutal
  sergeant who is not Hungarian, and can only say &ldquo;Vorw&auml;rts!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Marsch!&rdquo; and
  is backed in his arbitrary commands by the whole weight of government, King
  and country.</p>
  <p>For three years!&mdash;and there is always war going on somewhere&mdash;and
  that awful Bosnia! wherever it may be&mdash;lads from Hungarian villages
  go there sound in body and in limb and come back bent with ague, halt, lame
  or blind.</p>
  <p>Three years! More like for ever!</p>
  <p>And therefore the whole population of Marosfalva and of the villages round
  spends its last happy four-and-twenty hours in trying to forget that nine
  o&rsquo;clock of the fourteenth day of September is approaching with sure
  and giant strides; everyone has a wish to forget; the parents and grandparents,
  the sisters, the sweethearts, the lads themselves! The future is so hideous,
  let the joy of the present kill all thoughts of those coming three years.</p>
  <p>Marosfalva is the rallying-point, where this final annual jollification
  takes place. They all come over on the thirteenth from Fekete and G&ouml;rcz,
  and Kender, in order to dance and to sing at Marosfalva in the barn which
  belongs to Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein the Jew. Marosfalva boasts of a railway
  station and it is from here that at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning the
  lads will be entrained; so all day on the thirteenth there has been a pilgrimage
  along the cross-roads from the outlying villages and hamlets round Marosfalva&mdash;a
  stream of men and women and young children all determined to forget for a
  few hours the coming separation of the morrow; by five o&rsquo;clock in the
  afternoon all those had assembled who had meant to come and dancing in the
  barn had begun.</p>
  <p>Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s barn has always been the setting in which
  the final drama of the happy year is acted. After that night spent there
  in dancing and music and merry-making, down goes the curtain on the comedy
  of life and the tragedy of tears begins.</p>
  <p>Since five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the young people have been dancing&mdash;waltzing,
  polkaing, dancing the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s&mdash;mostly the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s,
  the dance of the nation, of the people, the most exhilarating, most entrancing,
  most voluptuous dance that feet of man have ever trod. The girls and lads
  are indefatigable, the slow and languorous Lassu (slow movement) alternates
  with the mad, merry cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, they twirl and twist, advance,
  retreat, separate and reunite in a mad, intoxicating whirl. Small booted
  feet stamp on the rough wooden floor, sending up clouds of dust. What matter
  if the air becomes more and more stifling? There are tears and sighs to be
  stifled too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho, there, czig&aacute;ny! Play up! Faster! Faster! &rsquo;Tis not
  a funeral dirge you are playing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The gipsy musicians, hot and perspiring, have blown and scraped and banged
  for fifteen solid hours; no one would ever think of suggesting that a gipsy
  needed rest; the clarinetist, it is true, rolled off his seat at one time,
  and had to be well shaken ere he could blow again, but the leader&mdash;as
  good a leader, mind you, as could be found in the kingdom&mdash;had only
  paused when the dancers were exhausted, or when bite and sup were placed
  before him. There they were, perched up on a rough platform made up of packing-cases
  borrowed from the station-master; the czimbalom player in the centre, his
  fat, brown hands wield the tiny clappers with unerring precision, up and
  down the strings, with that soft, lingering tone which partakes of the clavecins
  and the harp alike. At the back the double-bass, lean and dark, with jet-black
  eyes that stare stolidly at his leader.</p>
  <p>There is a second fiddle, and the fat clarinetist and, of course, the leader&mdash;he
  whose match could not be found in the kingdom. He stands on the very edge
  of the rough platform, his fiddle under his chin, and he stoops well forward,
  so that his hands and instrument almost touch the foremost of the dancing
  pairs.</p>
  <p>They&mdash;the dancers&mdash;crowd closely round the gipsy band, for so
  must the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s be danced, as near the musicians as possible,
  as close together as the wide, sweeping petticoats of the girls will allow.</p>
  <p>Such petticoats! One on the top of the other, ten or a dozen or more, and
  all of different colour: the girls are proud of these petticoats&mdash;the
  number of them is a sign of prosperity; and now as they dance and swing from
  the hips these petticoats fly out, caught by the currents of air until they
  look like gargantuan showers of vividly-coloured petals shaken by giant hands.</p>
  <p>Above the petticoats the girls&rsquo; waists look slim in the dark, tight-fitting
  corslet, above which again rises the rich, olive-tinted breast and throat;
  full white sleeves of linen crown the bare, ruddy arms, and ribbons of national
  colours&mdash;red, white and green&mdash;float from the shoulders and the
  waist.</p>
  <p>The smooth, thick hair is closely plaited, from the crown of the head in
  two long, tight plaits; it is drawn rigidly away from the forehead, giving
  that quaint, hard finish to the round, merry face which is so characteristic
  of the Asiatic ancestry.</p>
  <p>Each one of them a little picture which seems to have stepped straight out
  of a Velasquez canvas, the bell-shaped skirt, the stiff corslet, the straight,
  tight hair and round eyes full of vitality.</p>
  <p>The men wear their linen shirt and full trousers with fringed, embroidered
  ends, the leather waistcoat and broad belt covered with metal bosses and
  wrought with bright-coloured woollen threads. They get very excited in the
  mazes of the dance, they shout to the gipsies to play faster and ever faster;
  each holds his partner tightly round the slim waist and swings her round
  and round, till she stumbles, giddy and almost faint in his arms.</p>
  <p>And round the dancers in a semicircle the spectators stand in a dense crowd&mdash;the
  older folk and the girls who have not secured partners&mdash;they watch and
  watch, indefatigable like the dancers, untiring like the musicians. And behind
  this semicircle, in the dark corners of the barn, the children foot it too,
  with the same ardour, the same excitement as their elders.</p>
  <p>The last cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s of this memorable night! It is eight o&rsquo;clock
  now, and through the apertures in the log wall the brilliant light of this
  late summer&rsquo;s morning enters triumphant and crude.</p>
  <p>Andor is dancing with Elsa&mdash;pretty, fair-haired Elsa, the daughter
  of old Kapus Benk&oacute;, an old reprobate, if ever there was one. Such
  a handsome couple they look. Is it not a shame that Andor must go to-day&mdash;for
  three years, perhaps for ever?</p>
  <p>In Hungary the surname precedes the Christian name.</p>
  <p>The tears that have struggled up to Elsa&rsquo;s tender blue eyes, despite
  her will to keep them back, add to the charm of her engaging personality,
  they help to soften the somewhat serious expression of her young face. Her
  cheeks are glowing with the excitement of the dance, her graceful figure
  bends to the pressure of Andor&rsquo;s arm around her waist.</p>
  <p>Ten or a dozen cotton petticoats are tied round that slim waist of hers,
  no two of a like colour, and as she twists and twirls in Andor&rsquo;s arms
  the petticoats fly out, till she looks like a huge flower of many hues with
  superposed corollas, blue, green, pink and yellow, beneath which her small
  feet shod in boots of brilliant leather look like two crimson stamens.</p>
  <p>The tight-fitting corslet bodice and the full, white sleeves of the shift
  make her figure appear peculiarly slim and girlish, and her bare throat and
  shoulders are smooth and warmly tinted like some luscious fruit.</p>
  <p>No wonder that Andor feels this dance, this movement, the music, the girl&rsquo;s
  sweet, quick breath, going to his head like wine. Elsa was always pretty,
  always dainty and gentle, but now she is excited, tearful at the coming parting,
  and by all the saints a more exquisite woman never came out of Paradise!</p>
  <p>The semicircle of spectators composed of older folk draws closer round the
  dancers, but the other couples remain comparatively unheeded. It is Elsa
  and Andor whom everyone is watching.</p>
  <p>He is tall and broad-shouldered, with the supple limbs of a young stag,
  and the mad, irresponsible movements of a colt. His dark eyes shine like
  two stars out of his sun-burnt face; his muscular arms encircle Elsa&rsquo;s
  fine waist with a grip that is almost masterful. The wide sleeves of his
  linen shirt flutter above his shoulders till they look like wings and he
  like some messenger of the gods come to carry this exquisite prey off from
  the earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a well-matched couple!&rdquo; murmur the older women as they
  watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa will be the beauty of the village within the next year, mark
  what I say!&rdquo; added a kindly old soul, turning to her neighbour&mdash;a
  slatternly, ill-kempt, middle-aged woman, who was casting looks on Andor
  and Elsa that were none too kind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; retorted the latter, with sour mien, &ldquo;then &rsquo;tis
  as well that that good-for-nothing will be safely out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would not call Andor good-for-nothing, Irma n&eacute;ni,&rdquo; said
  one of the men who stood close by, &ldquo;he has not had much chance to do
  anything for himself yet. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt Irma&mdash;the words aunt (<i>n&eacute;ni</i>) and uncle (<i>b&aacute;csi</i>)
  are used indiscriminately in Hungary when addressing elderly people, and
  do not necessarily imply any relationship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he never will,&rdquo; snapped the woman, with a click of her
  thin jaws, &ldquo;I know the sort&mdash;always going to do wonderful things
  in a future which never comes. Well! at any rate while he is a soldier they
  will teach him that he is no better than other lads that come from the same
  village, and not even as good, seeing that he has never any money in his
  wallet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor will be rich some day,&rdquo; suggested the kindly old soul
  who had first spoken, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you forget it, Irma n&eacute;ni.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no special wish to remember it, my good Kati,&rdquo; retorted
  Irma dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; murmured the other, &ldquo;seeing that Andor has
  really courted Elsa this summer that . . . perhaps . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter has plenty of admirers,&rdquo; said Irma, in her bitter-toned,
  snappish way, &ldquo;and has no reason to wait for one who only may be rich
  some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! Lakatos P&aacute;l cannot live for ever. Andor will have every
  fill&eacute;r of his money when he dies, and P&aacute;l will cut up very
  well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lakatos P&aacute;l is a youngish man&mdash;not fifty, I imagine,&rdquo; concluded
  Irma with a sneer. &ldquo;He may live another thirty years, and Elsa would
  be an old woman herself by then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other woman said nothing more after that. It was no use arguing the
  point. Irma was the wife of old Kapus&mdash;both of them as shiftless, thriftless,
  ill-conditioned a pair as ever stole the daylight from God in order to waste
  it in idleness. How they came to be blessed with such a pretty, winning daughter
  as Elsa an all too-indulgent God only knew.</p>
  <p>What, however, was well known throughout the village was that as Kapus and
  his wife never had a crown to bless themselves with, and had never saved
  enough to earn a rest for themselves in their old age, they had long ago
  determined that their daughter should be the means of bringing prosperity
  to them as soon as she was old enough for the marriage-market.</p>
  <p>Elsa was beautiful! Thank the good God for that! Kapus had never saved enough
  to give her a marriage-portion either, and had she been ugly, or only moderately
  pretty, it would have been practically impossible to find a husband for her.
  But if she became the beauty of Marosfalva&mdash;as indeed she was already&mdash;there
  would be plenty of rich men who would be willing to waive the question of
  the marriage-portion for the sake of the glory of having captured the loveliest
  matrimonial prize in the whole countryside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave Irma n&eacute;ni alone, mother,&rdquo; said the man who had
  first taken up the cudgels in favour of Andor; &ldquo;we all know that she
  has very ambitious views for Elsa. Please God she may not be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From more than one group of spectators came similar or other comments on
  pretty Elsa and her partner. The general consensus of opinion seemed to be
  that it was as well Andor was going away for three years. Old Kapus and his
  wife would never allow their daughter to marry a man with pockets as empty
  as their own, and it was no use waiting for dead men&rsquo;s shoes. Lakatos
  P&aacute;l, the rich uncle, from whom Andor was bound to inherit some day,
  was little past the prime of life. Until he died how would Andor and a penniless
  wife contrive to live? For Lakatos P&aacute;l was a miser and hoarded his
  money&mdash;moreover, he was a confirmed bachelor and woman-hater; he would
  do nothing for Andor if the young man chose to marry.</p>
  <p>Ah, well! it was a pity! for a better-looking, better-matched pair could
  not be found in the whole county of Arad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky for you, B&eacute;la, that Andor goes off to-day for three
  years,&rdquo; said a tall, handsome girl to her neighbour; &ldquo;you would
  not have had much chance with Elsa otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man beside her made no immediate reply; he was standing with legs wide
  apart, his hands buried in the pockets of his trousers. At the girl&rsquo;s
  words, which were accompanied by a provocative glance from her large, dark
  eyes, he merely shrugged his wide shoulders, and jingled some money in his
  pockets.</p>
  <p>The girl laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money won&rsquo;t buy everything, you know, my good B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will buy most things,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The consent of Irma n&eacute;ni, for instance,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And a girl&rsquo;s willingness to exchange the squalor of a mud hut
  for comfort, luxury, civilization.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Unlike most of the young men here to-night, who wore the characteristic
  costume of the countryside&mdash;full, white linen shirt and trousers, broad
  leather belt, embossed and embroidered and high leather boots, B&eacute;la
  was dressed in a town suit of dark-coloured cloth, cut by a provincial tailor
  from Arad. He was short of stature, though broad-shouldered and firmly knit,
  but his face was singularly ugly, owing to the terrible misfortune which
  had befallen him when he lost his left eye. The scar and hollow which were
  now where the eye had once been gave the whole face a sinister expression,
  which was further accentuated by the irregular line of the eyebrows and the
  sneer which habitually hovered round the full, hard lips.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la was not good to look on; and this is a serious defect in a young
  man in Hungary, but he was well endowed with other attributes which made
  him very attractive to the girls. He had a fine and lucrative position, seeing
  that he was his Lordship&rsquo;s bailiff, and had an excellent salary, a
  good house and piece of land of his own, as well as the means of adding considerably
  to his income, since his lordship left him to conclude many a bargain over
  corn and plums, and horses and pigs. Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was rich and influential.
  He lived in a stone-built house, which had a garden round it, and at least
  five rooms inside, with a separate kitchen and a separate living-room, therefore
  he was a very eligible young man and one greatly favoured by mothers of penniless
  girls; nor did the latter look askance on B&eacute;la despite the fact that
  he had only one eye and that never a pleasant word escaped his lips.</p>
  <p>Even now he was looking on at the dancing with a heavy scowl upon his face.
  The girl near him&mdash;she with the dark, Oriental eyes and the thin, hooked
  nose, Klara Goldstein the Jewess&mdash;gave him a nudge with her brown, pointed
  elbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let Andor see the temper you are in, my friend,&rdquo; she
  said, with a sarcastic little laugh; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want any broken
  bones before the train goes off this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There will be broken bones if he does not look out,&rdquo; muttered
  the other between his teeth, as he drew a tightly clenched fist from his
  pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! why should you care?&rdquo; retorted Klara, who seemed to take
  an impish delight in teasing the young man, &ldquo;you are not in love with
  Elsa, are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it to you?&rdquo; growled B&eacute;la surlily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;only that we have always been
  friends, you and I&mdash;eh, B&eacute;la?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she turned her large, lustrous eyes upon him, peering at him through
  her long black lashes. She was a handsome girl, of course, and she knew it&mdash;knew
  how to use her eyes, and make the men forget that she was only a Jewess,
  a thing to be played with but despised&mdash;no better than a gipsy wench,
  not for a Hungarian peasant to look upon as an equal, to think of as a possible
  mate.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la, whose blood was hot in him, what with the wine which he had
  drunk and the jealous temper which was raging in his brain, was nevertheless
  sober enough not to meet the languorous glances which the handsome Jewess
  bestowed so freely upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are still friends&mdash;are we not, B&eacute;la?&rdquo; she reiterated
  slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;why not?&rdquo; he grunted, &ldquo;what has our friendship
  to do with Andor and Elsa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only this: that I don&rsquo;t like to see a friend of mine make a
  fool of himself over a girl who does not care one hairpin for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la smothered a curse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everyone knows that Elsa is over head and ears in love with Andor,
  and just won&rsquo;t look at anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;everyone knows that, do they? Well!
  you can tell that busy-body everyone from me that before the year is out
  Kapus Elsa will be tokened to me, and that when Andor comes back from having
  marched and drilled and paced the barrack-yard he will find that Kapus Elsa
  is Kapus no longer, but Er&ouml;s, the wife of Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, the
  mother of his first-born. To this I have made up my mind, and when I make
  up my mind to anything, neither God nor the devil dares to stand in my way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush! hush! in Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; she protested quickly, &ldquo;the
  neighbours will hear you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, and murmured something very uncomplimentary anent
  the ultimate destination of those neighbours.</p>
  <p>Some of them certainly had heard what he said, for he had not been at pains
  to lower his voice. His riches and his position had made him something of
  an oracle in Marosfalva, and he held all the peasantry in such contempt that
  he cared little what everyone thought of him. He therefore remained indifferent
  and sulky now whilst many glances of good-humoured mockery were levelled
  upon him.</p>
  <p>No one, of course, thought any the worse of Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la for desiring
  the beauty of the village for himself&mdash;he was rich and could marry whom
  he pleased, and that he should loudly and openly proclaim his determination
  to possess himself of the beautiful prize was only in accordance with the
  impulsive, hot-headed, somewhat bombastic temperament of the Magyars themselves.</p>
  <p>Fortunately those chiefly concerned in Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s loudly
  spoken determination had heard nothing of the colloquy between him and the
  Jewess. The wild, loud music of the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, their own gyrations
  and excitement, shut them out entirely from their surroundings.</p>
  <p>Their stamping, tripping, twirling feet had carried them into another world
  altogether; Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s barn had become a fairy bower,
  they themselves were spirits living in that realm of bliss; there was no
  longer any impending separation, no military service, no blank and desolate
  three years! Andor, his arm tightly clasped round Elsa&rsquo;s waist, his
  head bowed till his lips touched her bare shoulder, contrived to whisper
  magic words in her ear.</p>
  <p>Magic words?&mdash;simple, commonplace words, spoken by myriads of men before
  and since into myriads of willing ears, in every tongue this earth hath ever
  known. But to Elsa it seemed as if the Magyar tongue had never before sounded
  so exquisite! To her the words were magic because they wrought a miracle
  in her. She had been a girl&mdash;a child ere those words were spoken. She
  liked Andor, she liked her father and her mother, little Emma over the way,
  Mari n&eacute;ni, who was always kind. She had loved them all, been pleased
  when she saw them, glad to give them an affectionate kiss.</p>
  <p>But now, since that last cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s had begun, a strange and
  mysterious current had gone from Andor&rsquo;s arm right through her heart;
  something had happened, which caused her cheeks to glow with a fire other
  than that produced by the heat of the dance and made her own hands tremble
  when they rested on Andor&rsquo;s shoulder. And there was that in his look
  which made her eyes burn and fill with tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are beautiful, Elsa! I love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could not answer him, of course; how could she, when she felt that her
  throat was choked with sobs? Yet she felt so happy, so happy that never since
  the day of her first communion, when Pater Bonif&aacute;cius had blessed
  her and assured her that her soul was as white as that of an angel&mdash;never
  since then had she known such perfect, such absolute happiness. She could
  not speak, she almost thought once that she was going to faint, so strange
  was the thrill of joy which went right through her when Andor&rsquo;s lips
  rested for one brief, sweet moment upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>And now the lights are burning low, the gipsies scrape their fiddles with
  a kind of wild enthusiasm, which pervades them just as much as the dancers.
  Round and round in a mad twirl now, the men hold the girls with both hands
  by the waist, the girls put a hand on each of their partner&rsquo;s shoulders;
  thus they spin round and round, petticoats flying, booted feet stamping the
  ground.</p>
  <p>The young faces are all hot and streaming, quick breaths come in short,
  panting gasps from these young chests. The spectators join in the excitement,
  the men stamp and clap their heels to the rhythm of the dance, the women
  beat their hands one against the other to that same wild, syncopated measure.
  Old men grasp middle-aged women round the waist; smiling, self-deprecatingly
  they too begin to tread; Hej! &rsquo;Tis not so long ago we were young too,
  and that wild Hungarian cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s fires the blood until it glows
  afresh.</p>
  <p>Everyone moves, every body sways, it is impossible to keep quite still while
  that intoxicating rhythm fills the air.</p>
  <p>Only Klara the Jewess stands by, stolid and immovable; the Magyar blood
  is not in her, hers is the languorous Oriental blood, the supple, sinuous
  movements of the Levant. She watches this bacchanalian whirligig with a sneer
  upon her thin, red lips. Beside her Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la too is still, the
  scowl has darkened on his face, his one eye leers across the group of twirling
  dancers to that one couple close to the musicians&rsquo; platform.</p>
  <p>In the noise that goes on around him he cannot, of course, hear the words
  which Andor speaks, but he sees the movements of the young man&rsquo;s lips,
  and the blush which deepens over Elsa&rsquo;s face. That one eye of his,
  keener than any pair of eyes, has seen the furtive kiss, quick and glowing,
  which grazed the girl&rsquo;s bare shoulder, and noted the quiver which went
  right through the young, slender body and the look that shot through the
  quickly-veiled blue eyes.</p>
  <p>He was only a peasant, a rough son of the soil, whose temperament was hot
  with passion and whose temper had never known a curb. He had never realized
  until this moment how beautiful Elsa was, and how madly he loved her. For
  he called the jealous rage within by the sacred name of love, and love to
  a Magyar peasant is his whole existence, the pivot round which he frames
  his life, his thoughts of the present, his dreams of the future.</p>
  <p>The soil and the woman!&mdash;they are his passions, his desires, his religion&mdash;to
  own a bit of land&mdash;of Hungarian land&mdash;and the woman whom he loves.
  Those two possessions will satisfy him&mdash;beyond these there is nothing
  worth having&mdash;a plough, of course&mdash;a hut wherein to sleep&mdash;an
  ox or two, perhaps&mdash;a cow&mdash;a horse.</p>
  <p>But the soil and the woman on whom he has fixed his love&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
  call it love . . . he certainly calls it so&mdash;those two possessions make
  the Hungarian peasant more contented than any king or millionaire of Western
  civilization.</p>
  <p>Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la had the land. His father left him a dozen kataszter
  (land measure about two and three-quarter acres) or so; Elsa was the woman
  whom he loved, and the only question was who&mdash;he or Andor&mdash;would
  be strong enough to gain the object of his desire.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;You Will Wait For Me?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>But now it is all over, the final bar of the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s has been
  played, the last measure trodden. From the railway station far away the sharp
  clang of a bell has announced the doleful fact that in half an hour the train
  will start for Arad, thence to Brass&oacute;, where the recruits will be
  enrolled, ticketed, docketed like so many heads of cattle&mdash;mostly unwilling&mdash;made
  to do service for their country.</p>
  <p>In half an hour the train starts, and there is so much still to say that
  has been left unsaid, so many kisses to exchange, so many promises, protestations,
  oaths.</p>
  <p>The mothers, fearful and fussy, look for their sons in among the crowd like
  hens in search of their chicks; their wizened faces are hard and wrinkled
  like winter apples, they carry huge baskets on their arms, over-filled with
  the last delicacies which their fond, toil-worn hands will prepare for the
  beloved son for the next three years:&mdash;a piece of smoked bacon, a loaf
  of rye bread, a cake of maize-flour.</p>
  <p>The lads themselves&mdash;excited after the dance, and not quite as clear-headed
  as they were before that last cask of Hungarian wine was tapped in Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein&rsquo;s cellar&mdash;feel the intoxication of the departure now,
  the quick good-byes, the women&rsquo;s tears. A latent spirit of adventure
  smothers their sorrow at leaving home.</p>
  <p>The gipsies have struck up a melancholy Magyar folksong; the crowd breaks
  up in isolated groups, mothers and fathers with their sons whisper in the
  dark corners of the barn. The father who did his service thirty years ago
  gives sundry good advice&mdash;no rebellion, quiet obedience, no use complaining
  or grumbling, the three years are quickly over. The mother begs her darling
  not to give way to drink, and not to get entangled with one of the hussies
  in the towns; women and wine, the two besetting temptations that assail the
  Magyar peasant&mdash;let the darling boy resist both for his sorrowing mother&rsquo;s
  sake.</p>
  <p>But the lad only listens with half an ear, his dark eyes roam around the
  barn in search of the sweetheart; he wants one more protestation of love
  from her lips, one final oath of fidelity.</p>
  <p>Andor has neither father to admonish him, nor mother to pray over him; the
  rich uncle Lakatos P&aacute;l, with whom he has lived hitherto, does not
  care enough about him to hang weeping round his neck.</p>
  <p>And Elsa has given her father and mother the slip, and joined Andor outside
  the barn.</p>
  <p>Her blue eyes&mdash;tired after fifteen hours of pleasure&mdash;blink in
  the glare of the brilliant sun. Andor puts his arm round her waist and she,
  closing her aching eyes, allows him to lead her away.</p>
  <p>And now they are wandering down the great dusty high road, beneath the sparse
  shade of the stunted acacias that border it. They feel neither heat, nor
  dust, and say but little as they walk. From behind them, muffled by louder
  sounds, come the sweet, sad strains of the Magyar love-song, &ldquo;Csak
  egy kis l&aacute;ny van a vil&aacute;gon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There is but one girl in all the world,<br>
    And she is my own white dove.<br>
    Oh!
  How great must God&rsquo;s love be for me!<br>
  That He thought of giving you to
  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa, you will wait for me?&rdquo; asked Andor, with deep, passionate
  anxiety at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will wait for you, Andor,&rdquo; replied the girl simply, &ldquo;if
  the good God will give me the strength.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The strength, Elsa, will be in yourself,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;if
  only you love me as I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three years is such a long time!&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will count the weeks that separate us, Elsa&mdash;the days&mdash;the
  hours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, too, will be counting them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I come back I will at once talk with Pali b&aacute;csi&mdash;he
  is getting tired of managing his property&mdash;I know that at times lately
  he has felt that he needed a rest, and that he means to ask me to see to
  everything for him. He will give me that nice little house on the Fekete
  Road, and the mill to look after. We can get married at once, Elsa&mdash;when
  I come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He talked on somewhat ramblingly, at times incoherently. It was easy to
  see that he was trying to cheat sorrow, to appear cheerful and hopeful, because
  he saw that Elsa was quite ready to give way to tears. It was so hard to
  walk out of fairyland just when she had entered it, and found it more beautiful
  than anything else in life. The paths looked so smooth and so inviting, and
  fairy forms beckoned to her from afar; it all would have been so easy, if
  only the good God had willed it so. She thought of the many sins which&mdash;in
  her innocent life&mdash;she had committed, and for which Pater Bonif&aacute;cius
  had given her absolution; perhaps if she had been better&mdash;been more
  affectionate with her mother, more forbearing with her father, the good God
  would have allowed her to have this happiness in full which now appeared
  so shadowy.</p>
  <p>She fell to wishing that Andor had not been quite so fine and quite so strong,
  that his chest had been narrower, or his eyesight less keen. Womanlike, she
  felt that she would have loved him just as much and more, if he were less
  vigorous, less powerful; and in that case the wicked government would not
  want him; he could stay at home and help Pali b&aacute;csi to look after
  his lands and his mills, and she could marry him before the spring.</p>
  <p>Then the pressure of his arm round her waist recalled her to herself; she
  turned and met his glowing, compelling eyes, she felt that wonderful vitality
  in him which made him what he was, strong in body and strong in soul; his
  love was strong because his body was strong, as was his soul, his spirit
  and his limbs, and she no longer wished him to be weak and delicate, for
  then it would no longer be Andor&mdash;the Andor whom she loved.</p>
  <p>The clang of the distant bell chased away Elsa&rsquo;s last hovering dreams.
  Andor did not hear it; he was pressing the girl closer and closer to him,
  unmindful of his surroundings, unmindful that he was on the high road, and
  that frequently ox-carts went by laden with people, and that passers-by were
  hurrying now toward the railway station.</p>
  <p>True that no one took any notice of this young man and maid; everyone was
  either too much absorbed in the business of the morning, or too much accustomed
  to these final scenes of farewell and tenderness ere the lads went off for
  their three years&rsquo; service, to throw more than a cursory glance on
  these two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love you, Elsa, my dove, my rose,&rdquo; Andor reiterated over
  and over again; &ldquo;you will wait for my return, will you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will wait, Andor,&rdquo; replied the girl through her sobs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The thought of you will lighten my nights, and bring sunshine to
  my dreary days. Every morning and every evening when I say my prayers, I
  shall ask my guardian angel to fly over to yours, and to tell him to whisper
  in your ear that I love you beyond all else on earth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must part now, Andor,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;the second
  bell has gone long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet, Elsa, not yet,&rdquo; he pleaded; &ldquo;just walk as far
  as that next acacia tree. There no one will see us, and I want one more kiss
  before I go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She never thought to resist him, since her own heart was at one with his
  wish, and he was going away so soon and for so long. So they walked as far
  as the next acacia tree, and there he took her in his arms and kissed her
  on the cheeks, the eyes, the lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God alone knows, Elsa,&rdquo; he said, and now his own voice was
  choked with sobs, &ldquo;what it means to me to leave you. You are the one
  woman in the world for me, and I will thank the good God on my knees every
  day of my life for the priceless blessing of your love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After that they walked back hand in hand. They had wandered far, and in
  a quarter of an hour the train would be starting. It meant a week in prison
  in Arad for any recruit to miss the train, and Andor did mean to be brave
  and straight, and to avoid prison during the three years.</p>
  <p>The gipsy musicians had carried their instruments over to the railway station;
  here they had ensconced themselves in full view of the train and were playing
  one after the other the favourite songs of those who were going away.</p>
  <p>When Andor and Elsa reached the station the crowd in and around it was dense,
  noisy and full of animation and colour. A large batch of recruits who had
  come by the same train from more distant villages had alighted at Marosfalva
  and joined in the bustle and the singing. They had got over the pang of departure
  from home half an hour or an hour ago; they had already left the weeping
  mothers and sweethearts behind, so now they set to with a will in true Hungarian
  fashion to drown regrets and stifle unmanly tears by singing their favourite
  songs at the top of their rough voices, and ogling those girls of Marosfalva
  who happened to be unattached.</p>
  <p>The captain in command, with his lieutenant, was pacing up and down the
  station platform. He now gave a command to a couple of sergeants, and the
  entraining began. Helter-skelter now, for it was no use losing a good seat
  whilst indulging in a final kiss or tear. There was a general stampede for
  the carriages and trucks; the recruits on ahead, behind them the trail of
  women, the mothers with their dark handkerchiefs tied round their heads,
  the girls with pale, tear-stained faces, their petticoats of many colours
  swinging round their shapely hips as they run, the fathers, the brothers.</p>
  <p>Here comes Pater Bonif&aacute;cius, who has finished saying his mass just
  in time to see the last of his lads. He has tucked his soutane well up under
  his sash, and he is running across the platform, his rubicund, kindly face
  streaming with excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pater! Pater! Here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A score of voices cry to him from different carriages, and he hurries on,
  grasping each rough, hot hand as it is extended out to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless you, my children,&rdquo; he cries, and the large, red cotton
  handkerchief wanders surreptitiously from his nose to his eyes. &ldquo;Bless
  you and keep you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be good lads,&rdquo; he admonishes earnestly, &ldquo;remember your
  confession and the holy sacraments! No drinking!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Pater!&rdquo; comes in protesting accents all around him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! not more than is good for you. Abstinence on Fridays&mdash;a
  regular confession and holy communion and holy mass on Sundays will help
  to keep you straight before the good God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the last bell! Clang! clang! In two minutes comes the horn,
  and then we are off. The gipsies are playing the saddest of sad songs, it
  seems as if one&rsquo;s heartstrings were being wrenched out of one&rsquo;s
  body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>There is but one girl in all the world!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For each lad only one girl!&mdash;and she is there at the foot of the carriage-steps,
  a corner of her ribbon or handkerchief or cotton petticoat stuffed into her
  mouth, to keep her from bursting into sobs. The mothers now are dry-eyed
  and silent. They look with dull, unseeing gaze on this railway train, the
  engine, the carriages, which will take their lads away from them. Many have
  climbed up on the steps of the carriages, hanging on to the handrails, so
  as to be near the lads as long as possible. Their position is a perilous
  one, the sergeants as well as the railway officials have to take hold of
  them by the waist and to drag them forcibly down to the ground before they
  will give way.</p>
  <p>It is the mothers who are the most obstinate. They cling to the handrails,
  to the steps, even to the wheels&mdash;there will be a fearful accident if
  they are not driven off by force. And they will yield only to force; guards
  and porters take hold of them by the waist and drag them away from their
  perilous positions.</p>
  <p>They fight with stolid obstinacy; they will hang on to the train&mdash;they
  are the mothers, you see!&mdash;and yet from where they are they cannot always
  see their sons, herded in with forty or fifty other lads in a truck, some
  standing, some squatting on the ground, or on the provision baskets. But
  if you cannot see your son, it is always something to be on the step of the
  train which is about to take him away.</p>
  <p>The lads are all singing now at the top of their voices, but down below
  on the platforms there is but little noise; the mothers do not speak, because
  they are fighting for places on the steps of the railway-carriages, where
  the boys are; they press their lips tightly together, and when a guard or
  a porter comes to drag them away they just hit out with their elbows&mdash;stolidly,
  silently.</p>
  <p>The fathers and the other older men stand about in groups, leaning on their
  sticks, talking in whispers, recounting former experiences of entraining,
  or recruiting, of those abominable three years; and the young girls&mdash;the
  sweethearts, the sisters, the friends&mdash;dare not speak for fear they
  should break down and help to unman the lads.</p>
  <p>Andor, by dint of fighting and obstinacy, has kept his place in the door
  of one of the carriages; he sits on the floor, with his feet down on the
  step below, and refuses to quit his position for anyone. Several lads from
  the rear have tried to throw him out or to drag him in, but Andor is mightily
  strong&mdash;you cannot move him if he be not so minded.</p>
  <p>Elsa, sitting on the step lower down, is resting her elbow on his knee.
  There is no thought of hiding their love for one another; let the whole village
  know it, or the whole countryside, they do not care; they are not going to
  deprive themselves of these last few minutes&mdash;these heaven-born seconds,
  whilst their hands can still meet, their eyes can speak the words which their
  lips no longer dare frame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will wait for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In those few words lies all the consolation for the present, all the hope
  of the future. With these words engraved upon heart and memory they can afford
  to look more serenely upon these blank and dreary three years.</p>
  <p>It was as well to have spoken them; as well to have actually put into words
  what they had already known in their hearts long ago. Now they can afford
  to wait, and Andor will do it with confidence, he is a man and he is free.
  He viewed the future as a master views his slave; the future is his to do
  with what he likes, to mould, to shape in accordance with his will.</p>
  <p>The land which must one day be his, and Elsa his already! Andor almost fell
  to wishing that the train would start quickly&mdash;so many seconds would
  have been lived of those three intervening years.</p>
  <p>Elsa tries to look as full of hope as he does; she is only a woman, and
  the future is not hers to make at will. She is not the conqueror, the lord
  and king of her own destiny; there are so many difficulties in the path of
  her life which she would like to forget at this moment, so as not to embitter
  the happiness which has come to her; there is her shiftless mother and vagabond
  father, there is the pressure of poverty and filial duty&mdash;it is easy
  for Andor&mdash;he is a man!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will wait for me, Elsa?&rdquo; Andor asks for the twentieth time,
  and for the twentieth time her lips murmur an assent, even though her heart
  is heavy with foreboding.</p>
  <p>There goes the horn!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa, my love, one more kiss,&rdquo; cries Andor, as he presses her
  closely, ever more closely to his heart. &ldquo;God bless you, my rose! You <i>will</i> wait
  for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The engine gives a shrill whistle. All the men now&mdash;realizing the danger&mdash;drag
  their women-folk away from the slowly-revolving wheels. The gipsy musicians
  strike up the first spirited bars of the R&aacute;k&oacute;czy March, as
  with much puffing and ponderous creakings and groanings the heavily-laden
  train with its human freight steams away from the little station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Benk&oacute;! my son!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;J&aacute;nos!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Endre!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few heartrending cries as each revolution of the wheels takes the lads
  a little further away from their homes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa, you will wait for me?&rdquo; comes as a final, appealing cry
  from Andor.</p>
  <p>He stands in the door of the carriage, which he holds wide open, and through
  a mist of tears which he no longer tries to suppress he sees Elsa standing
  there, quite still&mdash;a small image of beauty and of sorrow. The sun glints
  upon her hair, it shines and sparkles like living gold; her hands are clasped
  tightly together, and with her full, many-hued petticoats round her slim
  waist and tiny red-shod feet she looks like a flower.</p>
  <p>The crowd below moves alongside of the train&mdash;for the first minute
  or so they all keep up with it, close to the carriage at the door of which
  can still be seen the head of son or brother or sweetheart. But now the engine
  puts on more speed, the wheels revolve more quickly&mdash;some of the crowd
  fall away, unable to run so fast.</p>
  <p>Only the mothers try to keep up&mdash;the old women, some of them bare-footed,
  stolid, looking straight before them&mdash;hardly looking at the train, just
  running . . . alongside the train first of all, then they must needs fall
  back&mdash;but still they run along the metals, even though the train moves
  away so quickly now that soon even a mother could not distinguish her son&rsquo;s
  head, like a black pin-point leaning out of the carriage window.</p>
  <p>So they run:&mdash;one or two women run thus for over a kilom&egrave;tre,
  they run long after the train has disappeared from view.</p>
  <p>But Elsa stood quite still. She did not try to run after the train.</p>
  <p>Through the noise of the puffing engine, the final cries of farewell, through
  all the noise and the bustle, Andor&rsquo;s cry rose above all, his final
  appeal to her to be true:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa! you will wait for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;Now That He Is Dead.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Stranger, if you should ever be driving on the main road between Szeged
  and Arad, tell your driver to pull up at the village of Marosfalva; its one
  broad street runs inland at right angles from the road; you will then have
  on your right two or three bits of meadowland overshadowed by willow trees,
  which slope down to the Maros; beyond the Maros lies the great plain&mdash;the
  fields of maize and pumpkin, of hemp and sunflower. And who knows what lies
  beyond the fields?</p>
  <p>But on your left will be the village of Marosfalva with the wayside inn
  and public bar, kept by Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein, standing prominently at
  the corner immediately facing you. Two pollarded acacias are planted near
  the door of the inn, above the lintel of which a painted board scribbled
  over with irregular lettering invites the traveller to enter. A wooden verandah,
  with tumble-down roof and worm-eaten supporting beams, runs along two sides
  of the house, and from the roof hang a number of gaily-coloured and decorated
  earthenware pots and jars.</p>
  <p>The open space in front of the inn and the whole of the length of the one
  street of Marosfalva are very dusty and dry in the summer, in the autumn
  and spring they are a sea and river of mud, and in the winter the snow hides
  the deep, frozen crevasses; but place and street are as God made them, and
  it is not man&rsquo;s place to interfere. To begin with, the cattle and geese
  and pigs must all pass this way on their way to the water, so of course it
  is impossible to do anything with the ground even if one were so minded.</p>
  <p>The inn is the only house in Marosfalva which boldly faces the street, all
  the others seem to be looking at it over their shoulders, the front of one
  house facing the back of its neighbour, with a bit of garden or yard between,
  and so on, the whole kilom&egrave;tre length of the street.</p>
  <p>But each house has its wooden verandah, which shields the living rooms against
  the glare of the sun in summer, and shelters them from snow and rain in winter.
  These wooden verandahs are in a greater or lesser state of repair and smartness,
  and under the roof of every verandah hang rows of the same quaintly-decorated
  and picturesque earthenware jars.</p>
  <p>Round every house, too, there are groups of gay sunflowers and of dull green
  hemp, and the roofs, thatched with maize-stalks, are ornamented along the
  top with wooden carvings which stand out clear and fantastic against the
  intense blue of the sky.</p>
  <p>Then, stranger, if you should alight at the top of the street and did wander
  slowly down its dusty length, you will presently see it widen out just in
  front of the church. It stands well there, doesn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;at one
  end of this open place, with its flat, whitewashed fa&ccedil;ade and tower&mdash;red-roofed
  and crowned with a metal cross that glints in the sun&mdash;the whole building
  so like in shape to a large white hen, with head erect and crimson comb and
  wings spread out flat to the ground.</p>
  <p>The presbytery is close by&mdash;you cannot miss it. It is a one-storied
  house, with a row of green-shuttered windows along the front and at the side
  a low gate which leads to a small garden at the back, and over which appears
  a vista of brilliant perennials and a stiff row of purple asters.</p>
  <p>There is the tiny school-house, too, which in the late summer is made very
  gay in front with vividly coloured dahlias&mdash;an orgy of yellow and brick-red,
  of magenta and orange.</p>
  <p>If your driver has come along with you down the street, he will point out
  to you the house of Barna Jen&ouml;&mdash;mayor of the Commune of Marosfalva&mdash;a
  personage of vast consideration in the village&mdash;a consideration which
  he shares with H&oacute;h&eacute;r Alad&aacute;r, who is the village justice
  of the peace, and with Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, who is my lord the Count&rsquo;s
  bailiff.</p>
  <p>Then lower down, beyond the church, is the big barn belonging to Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein, where on special occasions, as well as on fine Sunday afternoons,
  the young folk meet for their simple-hearted, innocent amusements&mdash;for
  their dancing, their singing and their courtships, and further on still are
  the houses of the poorer peasants&mdash;of men like Kapus Benk&oacute; who
  has never saved a fill&eacute;r and until lately, when he was stricken down
  with illness, had to work as a day labourer for wage, instead of owning a
  bit of land of his own and planting it up for his own enjoyment. Here the
  houses are much smaller and squalid-looking: they have no verandahs&mdash;only
  a narrow door and tiny, diminutive windows which are not made to open and
  shut. The pieces of ground around them are also planted, like the others,
  with hemp and with sunflowers, but even these look less majestic, less prosperous
  than those which surround the houses higher up the streets; their brown heads
  are smaller, more sparsely laden with the good oil-bearing seeds, and the
  stems of the hemp do not look as if they ever would make a thatch.</p>
  <p>The street itself is wide and a regular heat-trap in summer: in the autumn
  and the spring it is ankle-deep in mud, and of course in the winter it is
  buried in snow. But in the late summer it is at its best, one or two heavy
  showers of rain have laid the dust, and the sunflowers and dahlias round
  the little school-house and by the presbytery are very gay&mdash;such a note
  of crude and vivid colour which even puts the decorated jars to shame.</p>
  <p>Also the sun has lost some of its unbearable heat; after four o&rsquo;clock
  in the afternoon it is pleasant to sit or stand outside one&rsquo;s house
  for a bit of gossip with a neighbour. The brown-legged, black-eyed children,
  coolly clad in loose white shifts, bare-footed and bare-headed, can play
  outside now; the little girls, with bright-coloured kerchiefs tied round
  their heads, and pink or blue petticoats round their waists, vie with the
  dahlias in hue.</p>
  <p>On Sunday afternoons it is cool enough to dance in Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s
  barn. The black day in the calendar&mdash;the fourteenth of September&mdash;has
  come and gone, and the lads have gone with it: except for the weeping mothers
  and sweethearts the ordinary village life has resumed its peaceful course.
  But then, there are every year a few weeping mothers and sweethearts in Marosfalva
  or Kender or G&ouml;rcz, just as there is everywhere else: the lads have
  to go and do their military service as soon as they come of age.</p>
  <p>And then others come back about this time, those who have completed their
  three years, and they must be made welcome with dancing and music&mdash;the
  things which a Hungarian peasant loves best in all the world.</p>
  <p>And as the days are still long and the evenings warm there are the strolls
  hand-in-hand, arm-in-arm&mdash;after the dancing&mdash;up the village street
  as far as the slowly-flowing Maros. One or two of the lads who have come
  home after three years have found their sweethearts waiting for them&mdash;but
  only one or two. Three years is a long, long time! Girls cannot afford to
  wait for husbands while their youth and good looks fly away so quickly. And
  the lads, too, are fickle; some of them have apparently forgotten amongst
  the more showy, more lively beauties of garrison towns, the doe-eyed girl
  to whom they had promised faith. They are ready, as soon as they come back,
  for new courtships, fresh love-making, another girl&mdash;with blue eyes
  this time, and fair hair instead of brown.</p>
  <p>Then, of course, there are those who never will come back. That awful, mysterious
  place called Bosnia has swallowed them up. There was fighting, it seems,
  in Bosnia, and many were killed: two lads from Marosfalva, one from Fekete
  and two from Kender.</p>
  <p>Bosnia must belong to the Crown of Hungary&mdash;whatever that may mean&mdash;the
  politicians say so, anyhow, and in order that the Crown of Hungary should
  have what rightly belongs to it the lads from our villages have to fight
  and get killed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that just, I ask you?&rdquo; so the mothers argue.</p>
  <p>The sweethearts weep for awhile and then cast about for fresh fish out of
  the waters of Life. Sometimes there are mistakes: lads who have been reported
  killed turn up at the village on the appointed day, either hale and hearty
  or maimed and crippled. In either case they are welcome. But at times the
  mistake is the other way: no black report has come; the mothers, the fathers,
  the sweethearts, expect the young soldier home&mdash;he does not come. The
  others return on a given day&mdash;they arrive by train&mdash;Laczi or Benk&oacute; or
  P&aacute;l is not amongst them. Where is he? Well! they were not all in the
  same regiment; they have seen little or nothing of one another during these
  three years.</p>
  <p>The anxious mothers rush to Barna Jen&ouml;&mdash;the mayor&mdash;and he
  drafts a letter of inquiry which is duly sent off to the proper authorities
  at Budapest. In the course of time&mdash;not very promptly&mdash;the reply
  comes. A letter of condolence, curtly worded: the name of Laczi or Benk&oacute; or
  P&aacute;l, as the case may be, was inadvertently omitted from the list of
  killed after the skirmish near Banialuka.</p>
  <p>Sometimes also the young soldier having received his discharge, does not
  care to return to his native village: he has lost his taste for pigs and
  geese, for digging and sowing; he has had a glimpse of life and wants to
  see some more; the emigration agents at Budapest are active and persuasive. &ldquo;America
  is a land of gold,&rdquo; they say; &ldquo;no further trouble but to stoop
  and pick up the gold just where it lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the lad listens and ponders. He will not go home, for he is afraid that
  his mother&rsquo;s tears will deter him from his purpose: he follows the
  advice of the emigration agent, expends his last fill&eacute;r, sells his
  spare shirt and takes passage at Fiume on a big ship which conveys him to
  the land of riches.</p>
  <p>Oh! Those lads who go away like that come back sure enough! Broken in health
  and spirits, dying of that relentless and mysterious disease called &ldquo;homesickness,&rdquo; they
  drift back after a few years to their villages, having amassed a little money
  perhaps, but having lost that vitality, that love of life and of enjoyment
  which is the characteristic of these sons of Hungary&mdash;the land of warmth
  and of sunshine, of generous wines and luscious corn.</p>
  <p>And Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, walking arm-in-arm with Kapus Elsa on that warm
  Sunday afternoon, had talked much of Andor and of his untoward fate.</p>
  <p>The two young people had met outside the church after Benediction, they
  had strolled down as far as the Maros and back again into the village.</p>
  <p>The warm late September sunshine shed a golden glow upon the thatched roofs
  of the cottages and made every bright-coloured pot that hung under the verandahs
  gleam with many-hued and dazzling reflections. It touched the red roof of
  the little church with an additional coat of glittering crimson and caused
  the metal cross upon the spire to throw out vivid sparks of light.</p>
  <p>The festive air of a Sunday afternoon hung upon the village street, men
  and maids walked by arm-in-arm, the girls in their finery with cotton petticoats
  swinging out, and high-heeled boots clinking as they walked, the men with
  round felt hats tilted rakishly over one eye, their bronzed faces suffused
  in smiles, the song never for long absent from their lips.</p>
  <p>From the top of the street a flock of geese in charge of a diminutive maiden
  of ten was slowly waddling down toward the stream, shaking their grey and
  white feathers under the hot kiss of the sun, and behind them, in slow majesty,
  a herd of cows and oxen&mdash;snow-white, with graceful, tall horns, lyre-shaped
  and slender&mdash;ambled lazily along.</p>
  <p>Elsa and B&eacute;la had paused outside the house of H&oacute;h&eacute;r
  Alad&aacute;r&mdash;who was the village justice of the peace and husband
  to Ilona, B&eacute;la&rsquo;s only sister.</p>
  <p>A mightily rich man was H&oacute;h&eacute;r Alad&aacute;r, and Ilona was
  noted for being the most thrifty housewife in a country where most housewives
  are thrifty, and for being a model cook in a land where good cooks abound.</p>
  <p>Her house was a pattern of orderliness and cleanliness: always immaculately
  whitewashed outside and the little shutters painted a vivid green, it literally
  shone with dazzling brightness on these hot summer afternoons. The woodwork
  of the verandah was elaborately carved, the pots that hung from the roof
  had not a chip or crack in them.</p>
  <p>No wonder that Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was proud of these housewifely qualities
  in his only sister, and that he loved to make a display of them before his
  fianc&eacute;e whose own mother was so sadly lacking in them.</p>
  <p>Now he pushed open the front door and stood aside to allow Elsa to enter,
  and as she did so the sweet scent of rosemary and lavender greeted her nostrils;
  she looked round her with unfeigned appreciation, and a little sigh&mdash;hardly
  of envy but wholly wistful&mdash;escaped her lips. The room was small and
  raftered and low, but little light came through the two small windows, built
  one on each side of the front door, but even in the dim light the furniture
  shone with polish, and the wooden floor bore every sign of persistent and
  vigorous scrubbing. There was a cloth of coloured linen upon the centre table,
  beautifully woven in a chess-board pattern of red and blue by Ilona&rsquo;s
  deft hands. The pewter and copper cooking utensils on and about the huge
  earthenware stove were resplendently bright, and the carved oak dower-chest&mdash;with
  open lid&mdash;displayed a dazzling wealth of snow-white linen&mdash;hand-woven
  and hand-embroidered&mdash;towels, sheets, pillow-cases, all lying in beautiful
  bundles, neatly tied with red ribbons and bows.</p>
  <p>Again Elsa sighed&mdash;in that quaint, wistful little way of hers. If her
  mother had been as thrifty and as orderly as Ilona, then mayhap her own marriage
  with Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la need never have come about. She could have mourned
  for Andor quietly by herself, and the necessity of a wealthy son-in-law would
  probably never have presented itself before her mother&rsquo;s mind.</p>
  <p>But now she followed Ilona into the best bedroom, the sanctum sanctorum
  of every Hungarian peasant home&mdash;the room that bears most distinctly
  the impress of the housewifely character that presides over it. And as Elsa
  stood upon the threshold of her future sister-in-law&rsquo;s precious domain,
  she forgot her momentary sadness in the hope of a brighter future, when she,
  too, would make her new home orderly and sweet-scented, with beautifully-polished
  furniture and floors radiant with cleanliness. The thought of what her own
  best bedroom would be like delighted her fancy. It was a lovely room, for
  B&eacute;la&rsquo;s house was larger by far than his sister&rsquo;s, the
  rooms were wider and more lofty, and the windows had large, clear panes of
  glass in them. She would have two beautiful bedsteads in the room, and the
  bedspreads would be piled up to the ceiling with down pillows and duvets
  covered in scarlet twill; she would have two beautiful spreads of crochet-work,
  a washstand with marble top, and white crockery, and there would be a stencilling
  of rose garlands on the colour-washed walls.</p>
  <p>So now her habitual little sigh was not quite so wistful as it had been
  before; the future need not after all be quite so black as she sometimes
  feared, and surely the good God would be kind to her in her married life,
  seeing that she obeyed His commandment and honoured her mother by doing what
  her mother wished.</p>
  <p>Ilona in the best bedroom was busy as usual with duster and brush. She did
  not altogether approve of B&eacute;la&rsquo;s choice of a wife, and her greetings
  of Elsa were always of a luke-warm character, and were usually accompanied
  by lengthy lectures on housewifery and the general management of a kitchen.</p>
  <p>Elsa always listened deferentially to these lectures, with eyes downcast
  and an attitude of meekness; but in her own heart she was thankful that her
  future home would lie some distance out of the village and that Ilona would
  probably have but little time to walk out there very often.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile, however, she hated these Sunday afternoon visits, with
  their attendant homilies from Ilona first, then from Alad&aacute;r&mdash;who
  was self-important and dictatorial, and finally from B&eacute;la, who was
  invariably disagreeable and sarcastic whenever he saw his sister and his
  fianc&eacute;e together.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, to-day B&eacute;la had said that she need not stay more than
  a few minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just pay our respects to Ilona and Alad&aacute;r,&rdquo; he
  had said pompously, &ldquo;and take another walk before the sun goes down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Elsa&mdash;taking him at his word&mdash;had made but a meteoric appearance
  in her future sister-in-law&rsquo;s cottage&mdash;a hasty greeting, a brief
  peck on Ilona&rsquo;s two cheeks, and one on Alad&aacute;r&rsquo;s bristly
  face, then the inevitable homily; and as soon as Ilona paused in the latter,
  in order to draw breath, Elsa gave her another peck, by way of farewell,
  explained hastily that her mother was waiting for her, and fled incontinently
  from the rigid atmosphere of the best bedroom.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la and his brother-in-law had started on politics, and it took
  a little time before Elsa succeeded in persuading him to have that nice walk
  with her before the sun went down. But now they were out again in the sunshine
  at last, and Elsa was once more able to breathe freely and with an infinity
  of relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said B&eacute;la dryly, &ldquo;if you are really
  taking in all the good advice which Ilona so kindly gives you from time to
  time. You can&rsquo;t do better than model yourself on her. She is a pattern
  wife and makes Alad&aacute;r perfectly happy. I wonder,&rdquo; he reiterated,
  with something of a sneer, &ldquo;if you will learn from her, or if your
  mother&rsquo;s influence will remain with you for ever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as with her accustomed gentleness she chose to remain silent, rather
  than resent his sneer, he added curtly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you want to make me happy and comfortable you will follow Ilona&rsquo;s
  advice in all things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will do my best, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>Then for some reason which the young man himself could not perhaps have
  explained he once more started talking about Andor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was very hard on him,&rdquo; he said, with a shrug of his wide
  shoulders, &ldquo;to die just when he was on the point of getting his discharge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And after an almost imperceptible moment of hesitation he added with studied
  indifference: &ldquo;Of course, all that talk of his being still alive is
  sheer nonsense. I have done everything that lay in my power to find out if
  there was the slightest foundation for the rumour, but now I&mdash;like all
  sensible people&mdash;am satisfied that Andor is really dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Elsa was walking beside him, her hand resting lightly on his arm, as was
  fitting for a girl who was tokened and would be a bride within the week:
  she walked with head bent, her eyes fixed upon the ground. She made no immediate
  reply to her fiance&rsquo;s self-satisfied peroration, and her silence appeared
  to annoy him, for he continued with some acerbity:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care to hear what I did on Andor&rsquo;s behalf?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;it was good
  of you to worry about him&mdash;and you so busy already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did what I could,&rdquo; he rejoined mollified. &ldquo;Old Lakatos
  P&aacute;l has hankered after him so, though he cared little enough about
  Andor at one time. Andor was his only brother&rsquo;s only child, and I suppose
  Pali b&aacute;csi was suddenly struck with the idea that he really had no
  one to leave his hoardings to. He was always a fool and a lout. If Andor
  had lived it would have been all right. I think Pali b&aacute;csi was quite
  ready to do something really handsome for him. Now that Andor is dead he
  has no one; and when he dies his money all goes to the government. It is
  a pity,&rdquo; he added, with a shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;If a peasant
  of Marosfalva had it it would do good to the commune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure if Andor had lived to enjoy it he would have spent it freely
  and done good with it to everyone around,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He would have spent it freely, right enough,&rdquo; he retorted dryly, &ldquo;but
  whether he would have done good to everyone around with it&mdash;I doubt
  me . . . to Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein, perhaps . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&eacute;la, you must not say that,&rdquo; she broke in firmly; &ldquo;you
  know that Andor never was a drunkard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never suggested that he was,&rdquo; retorted B&eacute;la, whose
  square, hard face had become a shade paler than before, &ldquo;so there is
  no reason for my future wife to champion him quite so hotly as you always
  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only spoke the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If someone else spoke of me a hundred times more disparagingly than
  I ever do of Andor would you defend me as warmly, I wonder, as you do him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us quarrel about Andor,&rdquo; she rejoined gently, &ldquo;it
  does not seem right now that he is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;Love Will Follow.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>They had reached the small cottage where old Kapus and his wife and Elsa
  lived. It stood at the furthest end of the village, away from the main road,
  and the cool meadows beside the Maros, away from the church and the barn
  and all the brightest spots of Marosfalva. Built of laths and mud, it had
  long ago quarrelled with the whitewash which had originally covered it, and
  had forcibly ejected it, showing deep gaps and fissures in its walls; the
  pots and jars which hung from the overhanging thatch were all discoloured
  and broken, and the hemp which hung in bundles beside them looked uneven
  and dark in colour, obviously beaten with a slipshod, careless hand.</p>
  <p>Such a contrast to the house of H&oacute;h&eacute;r Alad&aacute;r&mdash;the
  rich justice of the peace and of Ilona his wife! Elsa knew and expected that
  the usual homily on the subject would not fail to be forthcoming as it did
  on every Sunday afternoon; she only wondered what particular form it would
  take to-day, whether B&eacute;la would sneer at her and her mother for the
  tumble-down look of the verandah, for the bad state of the hemp, or the coating
  of dirt upon the earthenware pots.</p>
  <p>But it was the hemp to-day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look after it, Elsa?&rdquo; said B&eacute;la
  roughly, as he pointed to the tangled mass of stuff above him, &ldquo;your
  mother ruins even the sparse crop which she has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do everything,&rdquo; said Elsa, in that same gentle,
  even voice which held in its tones all the gamut of hopeless discouragement; &ldquo;since
  father has been stricken he wants constant attention. Mother won&rsquo;t
  give it him, so I have to be at his beck and call. Then there is the washing
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; broke in B&eacute;la with a sneer, &ldquo;you
  need not always remind me that my future wife&mdash;the bride of my lord
  the Count&rsquo;s own bailiff&mdash;does menial work for a village schoolmistress
  and a snuffy old priest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Elsa made no reply. She pushed open the door of the cottage and went in;
  B&eacute;la followed her, muttering between his teeth.</p>
  <p>The interior of Kapus Benk&oacute;&rsquo;s home was as squalid, as forlorn
  looking as its approach; everywhere the hand of the thriftless housewife
  was painfully apparent, in the blackened crockery upon the hearth, in the
  dull, grimy look of the furniture&mdash;once so highly polished&mdash;in
  the tattered table-cloth, the stains upon the floor and the walls, but above
  all was it apparent in the dower-chest&mdash;that inalienable pride of every
  thrifty Hungarian housewife&mdash;the dower-chest, which in Ilona&rsquo;s
  cottage was such a marvel of polish outside, and so glittering in its rich
  contents of exquisite linen. But here it bore relentless if mute testimony
  to the shiftless, untidy, disorderly ways of the Kapus household. For instead
  of the neat piles of snow-white linen it was filled with rubbish&mdash;with
  husks of maize and mouldy cabbage-stalks, thrown in higgledy-piggledy with
  bundles of clothes and rags of every sort and kind.</p>
  <p>It stood close to the stove, the smoke of which had long ago covered the
  wood with soot. The lid was thrown open and hung crooked upon a broken hinge.</p>
  <p>When Elsa entered the cottage with Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la her mother was
  busy with some cooking near the hearth, and smoke and the odour of <i>guly&aacute;s</i> (meat
  stew) filled the place. Close to the fire in an armchair of polished wood
  sat old Kapus Benk&oacute;, now a hopeless cripple. The fate which lies in
  wait in these hot countries for the dissolute and the drunkard had already
  overtaken him. He had had a stroke a couple of years ago, and then another
  last summer. Now he could not move hand or foot, his tongue refused him service,
  he could only see and hear and eat. Otherwise he was like a log: carried
  from his palliasse on which he slept at night to the armchair in which he
  sat all day. Elsa&rsquo;s strong young arms carried him thus backwards and
  forwards, she ministered to him, nursed him, did what cheering she could
  to brighten his days that were an almost perpetual night.</p>
  <p>At sight of Elsa his wrinkled face, which was so like that of a corpse,
  brightened visibly. She ran to him and said something in his ear which caused
  his dulled eyes to gleam with momentary pleasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you bring B&eacute;la home with you for?&rdquo; said the
  mother ungraciously, speaking to her daughter and rudely ignoring the young
  man, who had thrown his hat down and drawn one of the chairs close to the
  table. At Kapus Irma&rsquo;s inhospitable words he merely laughed and shrugged
  his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Irma n&eacute;ni!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is the last Sunday,
  anyhow, that you will be troubled with my presence. After Wednesday, as I
  shall have Elsa in my own home, I shall not need to come and visit here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; retorted Irma, with a snap of her lean jaws, &ldquo;you
  will take good care to alienate her from her duty to her father and to her
  mother, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, in answer to a further sneer from him, she added, more viciously: &ldquo;You
  will teach her to be purse-proud like yourself&mdash;vain, and disdainful
  of her old home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la&rsquo;s one eye&mdash;under the distorted brow&mdash;wandered
  with a sullen expression of contempt over every individual piece of furniture
  in the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a home to be proud of, anyway,&rdquo; he said dryly; &ldquo;is
  it, Irma n&eacute;ni?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You chose your future wife out of it,&rdquo; retorted Irma; &ldquo;and &rsquo;tis
  from here that you will have to fetch her on Wednesday, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was always ready to quarrel with B&eacute;la, whose sneering ways she
  resented, all the more that she knew they were well-deserved. But her last
  words had apparently poured oil over the already troubled waters of the young
  man&rsquo;s wrath, for now his sullen expression vanished, and a light of
  satisfaction and of pride lit up his ungainly face:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I will fetch my future wife in a style befitting her new position,
  you may be sure of that,&rdquo; he said, and brought his clenched fist down
  upon the table with a crash, so that pots and pans rattled upon the hearth
  and started the paralytic from his torpor.</p>
  <p>Then he threw his head back and began to talk still more arrogantly and
  defiantly than he had done hitherto.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forty-eight oxen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shall fetch her in six carts!
  Aye! even though she has not one stick of furniture wherewith to endow her
  future husband. Forty-eight oxen, I tell you, Irma n&eacute;ni! Never has
  there been such a procession seen in Marosfalva! But Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la
  is the richest man in the Commune,&rdquo; he added, with an aggressive laugh, &ldquo;and
  don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the allusion to Elsa&rsquo;s poverty and his own riches had exasperated
  the old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With all your riches,&rdquo; she retorted, in her turn, with a sneer, &ldquo;you
  had to court Elsa for many years before she accepted you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And probably she would not have accepted me at all if you had not
  bullied and worried her, and ordered her to say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; he
  rejoined dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Children must obey their parents,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is the
  law of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A law which you, for one, apply to your own advantage, eh, Irma n&eacute;ni?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you any cause for complaint?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Elsa&rsquo;s obedience has served me well. And though I dare
  say,&rdquo; he added, suddenly casting a sullen look upon the young girl, &ldquo;she
  has not much love for me now, she will do her duty by me as my wife, and
  love will follow in the natural course of things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Elsa had taken no part in this wordy warfare between her mother and her
  future husband. It seemed almost as if she had not heard a word of it. No
  doubt her ears were trained by now no longer to heed these squabbles. She
  had drawn a low stool close to the invalid&rsquo;s chair, and sitting near
  him with her hand resting on his knee, she was whispering and talking animatedly
  to him, telling him all the gossip of the village, recounting to him every
  small event of the afternoon and of the morning: Pater Bonif&aacute;cius&rsquo; sermon,
  the behaviour of the choir boys, Patk&oacute;s Emma&rsquo;s new kerchief;
  when the stock of gossip gave out she began to sing to him, in a low, sweet
  voice, one of those innumerable folk-songs so dear to every Hungarian peasant&rsquo;s
  heart.</p>
  <p>Irma intercepted the look which B&eacute;la cast upon his fianc&eacute;e.
  She, too, turned and looked at her daughter, and seeing her there, sitting
  at the feet of that miserable wreck of humanity whom she called &ldquo;father!&rdquo; ministering
  to him, for all the world like the angels around the dying saints, a swift
  look of pity softened for a moment the mother&rsquo;s hard and pinched face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You cannot expect the girl to have much love for you now,&rdquo; she
  said, once more turning a vicious glance upon her future son-in-law; &ldquo;your
  mode of courtship was not very tender, you will admit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in all that silly love-making,&rdquo; he rejoined
  roughly, &ldquo;it is good enough for the loutish peasants of the <i>alf&ouml;ld</i> (lowlands);
  they are sentimental and stupid: an educated man does not make use of a lot
  of twaddle when he woos the woman of his choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All men act very much in the same way when they are in love,&rdquo; said
  Irma sententiously. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe that you are really
  in love with Elsa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, and laughed, a short, sarcastic, almost cruel
  laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I want her for my wife all
  the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only because she is the noted beauty of the countryside, and because
  half the village wanted her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; he said with a sneer; &ldquo;there was a good deal
  of bidding for Elsa, eh, Irma n&eacute;ni? So you elected to give her to
  the highest bidder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had been courting her longer than anybody,&rdquo; rejoined Irma,
  who this time chose to ignore his taunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I would have won her sooner&mdash;on my own&mdash;even without
  your help, if it had not been for that accursed Andor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! he is dead now, anyway. All doubts, I suppose, are at rest
  on that point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are a few fools still left in the village who maintain that
  he will turn up some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all hope he will, because of Lakatos P&aacute;l. The poor man
  is fretting himself into his grave, since he has realized that when he dies
  his money and land must all go to the Government.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can sell his land and distribute his money while he lives,&rdquo; retorted
  B&eacute;la; &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t catch him doing that&mdash;the old
  miser.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t anything more be done?&mdash;about Andor, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he said impatiently; &ldquo;everything that
  could be done has been done. It&rsquo;s no use going on having rows by post
  with the War Office about the proofs of a man&rsquo;s death who has been
  food for worms these past two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! you know, B&eacute;la, people here are not satisfied about
  those proofs. I, for one, never held with those who would not believe in
  Andor&rsquo;s death; there are plenty of folk in the village&mdash;and Pater
  Bonif&aacute;cius is one of them&mdash;who swear that he will come home one
  of these days&mdash;perhaps when Pali b&aacute;csi is dead. And then he would
  find himself the richest man in the Commune,&rdquo; she added, not without
  a point of malice, &ldquo;richer even than you, my good B&eacute;la.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, you old fool!&rdquo; broke in B&eacute;la savagely,
  as once more the sinister leer which hovered round his sightless eye was
  turned toward Elsa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say that I, for one, never believed that rubbish?&rdquo; retorted
  Irma sullenly; &ldquo;and haven&rsquo;t I preached to her about it these
  past two years? But you needn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; she added, as she
  turned once more to her stewing-pot, &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t hear what I
  said. When she talks or sings to her father you might shoot off a cannon&mdash;she
  wouldn&rsquo;t hear it. You may say what you like just now, B&eacute;la,
  she&rsquo;ll not listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said B&eacute;la, even as a curious expression of obstinacy,
  not unmixed with cruelty, crept into his colourless face, &ldquo;you seem
  to forget, Irma n&eacute;ni, that the rest of Elsa&rsquo;s life will have
  to be spent in listening to me. We&rsquo;ll soon see about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa!&rdquo; he called peremptorily.</p>
  <p>Then, as indeed the girl appeared not to hear, but went on softly crooning
  and singing to the helpless invalid like a mother to its babe, the young
  man worked himself up into a passion of fury. The veins in his pale forehead
  and temples swelled up visibly, the glitter in his one eye became more cruel
  and more menacing, finally he brought his clenched fist once more crashing
  down upon the table, even while he rose to his feet, as if to give fuller
  meaning to his future marital authority.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa!&rdquo; he shouted once more, hoarsely. &ldquo;Elsa, do you
  hear what I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Wish To Marry; Not Yet.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The girl thus roughly apostrophized turned slowly round. She seemed neither
  hurt nor even surprised at the young man&rsquo;s exhibition of temper. In
  her blue eyes there was a strange look&mdash;one which had lately been habitual
  to her, but which neither her mother nor B&eacute;la were able to interpret:
  it was a look which conveyed the thought of resignation or indifference or
  both, but also one which was peculiarly lifeless, as of a soul who had touched
  the cold hand of despair.</p>
  <p>Far be it from me to seek complexity in so simple a soul as was that of
  this young Hungarian peasant girl. Elsa Kapus had no thought of self-analysis;
  complicated sex and soul problems did not exist for her; she would never
  have dreamed of searching the deep-down emotions of her heart and of dragging
  them out for her mind to scrutinize. The morbid modern craze for intricate
  and composite emotions was not likely to reach an out-of-the-way Hungarian
  village that slept peacefully on the banks of the sluggish Maros, cradled
  in the immensity of the plain.</p>
  <p>Elsa had loved Lakatos Andor&mdash;the handsome, ardent young lover whose
  impetuous courtship of her five years ago had carried her on the wings of
  Icarus to a region so full of brightness and of sunlight that it was no wonder
  that the wings&mdash;which had appeared god-like&mdash;turned out to be ephemeral
  and brittle after all, and that she was soon precipitated back and down into
  the ordinary sea of everyday life.</p>
  <p>Elsa had never heard of Icarus, but she had felt herself soaring upwards
  on heavenly wings when Andor&mdash;his lips touching her neck&mdash;had whispered
  with passionate ardour: &ldquo;Elsa, I love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had never heard of Icarus&rsquo; fall, but she had experienced her own
  from the giddy heights of heavenly happiness, down to the depths of dull,
  aching despair. The fall had been very gradual&mdash;there had been nothing
  grand or heroic or soul-stirring about it: Andor had gone away, having told
  her that he loved her, and adjured her to wait for him. She had waited for
  three years, patiently, quietly, obstinately, despite the many and varied
  sieges laid to her heart and her imagination by the inflammable, eligible
  youth of the countryside. Elsa Kapus&mdash;the far-famed beauty of half the
  county, counted her suitors by the score. Patiently, quietly, obstinately
  she kept every suitor at bay&mdash;even though many were rich and some in
  high positions&mdash;even though her mother, with the same patience, the
  same quietude, and the same obstinacy worked hard to break her daughter&rsquo;s
  will.</p>
  <p>But Andor was coming back. Andor had adjured her to wait for him: and Elsa
  was still young&mdash;just sixteen when Andor went away. She was in no hurry
  to get married.</p>
  <p>No one, of course, guessed the reason of her obstinate refusal of all the
  best matrimonial prizes in the county. No one guessed her secret&mdash;the
  depth of her love for Andor&mdash;her promise to wait for him&mdash;her mother
  guessed it least of all. Everyone put her stubbornness down to conceit and
  to ambition, and no one thought any the worse of her on that account. When
  she refused young Barna&mdash;the mayor&rsquo;s eldest son, and Nagy Lajos,
  the rich pig merchant from Soms&oacute;, people shrugged their shoulders
  and said that mayhap Elsa wanted to marry a shopkeeper of Arad or even a
  young noble lord. Irma n&eacute;ni said nothing for the first year, and even
  for two. She saw Nagy Lajos go away, and young Barna court another girl.
  That was perhaps as it should be. Elsa was growing more beautiful every year&mdash;and
  there was a noble lord who owned a fine estate and a castle close by, who
  had taken lately to riding over on Sunday afternoons to Marosfalva, and paid
  marked attention to Elsa.</p>
  <p>Noble lords had been known to marry peasant girls&mdash;at least in books,
  so Irma n&eacute;ni had been told, and, of course, one never knows! God&rsquo;s
  ways were wonderful sometimes.</p>
  <p>But when two years had gone by, when a rich shopkeeper from Arad had come
  and courted and been refused, and when the noble lord had suddenly ceased
  his Sunday afternoon visits to Marosfalva, Irma became more anxious. She
  had a long and serious talk with her daughter, which led to no good.</p>
  <p>To all her mother&rsquo;s wise counsels and sound arguments Elsa had opposed
  the simple statement of facts:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not wish to marry, mother dear; not just yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This, of course, would never do. Irma realized that she had allowed her
  ambition for her daughter to run away with her common-sense. Elsa must have
  got some queer notion or other in her head; that intimacy with the schoolmistress&mdash;who
  came from Budapest and talked a vast amount of sentimental stuff which she
  had imbibed out of books&mdash;must be stopped at once, and Elsa be taken
  in hand by her own mother.</p>
  <p>To aim high was quite one thing, but to let every chance, however splendid,
  slip through one&rsquo;s fingers was the work of a fool.</p>
  <p>The work of taking Elsa in hand was thus promptly undertaken. Fate favoured
  the mother&rsquo;s intentions: old Kapus was stricken with paralysis, and
  Elsa had, from that hour forth, to spend most of her time with her father
  in the house, and immediately under her mother&rsquo;s eye.</p>
  <p>Though young Barna was married by now, and the pig merchant, the noble lord
  and the rich shopkeeper all gone to seek a sweetheart elsewhere, there were
  still plenty of suitors dangling round the beauty of the country-side: in
  fact her well-known pride and aloofness had brought a surfeit of competitors
  in the lists. Foremost among these was Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, who was not
  only young and in a high position as my lord the Count&rsquo;s chief bailiff,
  but was also reputed to be the richest man for miles around.</p>
  <p>Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la had long ago made public his determination to win
  Elsa for wife, and he had carried his courtship unostentatiously but persistently
  all along, despite the many rivals in the field. Elsa never disliked him,
  she accepted his attentions just as she did those of everyone else. Periodically
  B&eacute;la would make a formal proposal of marriage, which Irma n&eacute;ni,
  in her own name and that of Elsa&rsquo;s paralytic father, invariably accepted.
  But to his sober and well-worded proposals Elsa gave the same replies that
  she gave to her more impetuous adorers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to marry. Not yet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When the work of taking Elsa in hand began in earnest, Irma used Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la as her chief weapon of attack. He was very rich, young enough
  to marry, my lord the Count looked upon him as his right hand&mdash;moreover
  B&eacute;la had made Irma n&eacute;ni a solemn promise that if Elsa became
  his wife, his father and mother-in-law should receive that fine house in
  the Kender Road to live in, with a nice piece of garden, three cows and five
  pigs, and a little maid-of-all-work to wait upon them.</p>
  <p>Backed with such a bargain, B&eacute;la&rsquo;s suit was bound to prosper.</p>
  <p>And yet, for another whole year, Elsa was obstinate. Irma had to resort
  to sterner measures, and in a country like Hungary, where much of the patriarchal
  feeling toward parents still exists, a mother&rsquo;s stern measures become
  very drastic indeed. A child is a child while she is under her parents&rsquo; roof.
  If she be forty she still owes implicit obedience, unbounded respect to them.
  If she fail in these, she becomes an unnatural creature, denounced to her
  friends as such, under a cloud of opprobrium before her tiny, circumscribed
  world.</p>
  <p>Kapus Irma brought out the whole armoury of her parental authority, her
  parental power: and her methods could be severe when she chose. I will not
  say that she ill-treated the girl, though it was more than once that Elsa&rsquo;s
  right cheek and ear were crimson when the left were quite pale, and that
  often, on the hot Sundays in July and August, when the girls go in low-necked
  corslets and shifts to church, Elsa wrapped a kerchief over her shoulders&mdash;the
  neighbours said in order to hide the corrections dealt by Irma n&eacute;ni&rsquo;s
  vigorous hand. But it was morally that her mother&rsquo;s authority weighed
  most heavily upon the girl. Her commands became more defined, and presently
  more peremptory. Elsa was soon placed in the terrible alternative of either
  being faithless to Andor or disobedient to her mother.</p>
  <p>And it is characteristic of that part of the world that of the two sins
  thus in prospect, the latter seemed by far the more heinous.</p>
  <p>Yet Andor was due back at the end of the summer. The fourteenth of September
  came and went and the new recruits went with it&mdash;another week, and those
  who had completed their three years would be coming home. Andor would, of
  course, be among them. There had come no adverse report about him, and no
  news during those three years is always counted to be good news. No letters
  or sign of life had come from him, but, then, many of the lads never wrote
  home while they did their three years, and Andor had no one to write to.
  He would not be allowed to write to Elsa, or, rather, Elsa would never be
  allowed to receive letters from him, and his uncle Lakatos P&aacute;l, the
  old miser, would only be furious with him for spending his few fill&eacute;rs
  on note-paper and stamps. But Elsa had waited patiently during three years,
  knowing that though she had no news of him, he would not forget her. She
  never mistrusted him, she never doubted him.</p>
  <p>She waited for him, and he did not return. At first, his non-appearance
  excited neither surprise nor comment in the village. Andor had no relations
  except his uncle Lakatos P&aacute;l, who did not care one brass fill&eacute;r
  about him: there had been no one to count the years, the months, the days
  when he would return: there was only Elsa who cared, and she dared not say
  anything at first, for fear of making her mother angry.</p>
  <p>But at the turn of the year Lakatos P&aacute;l became ill, and when he got
  worse and worse and the doctor seemed unable to do anything to make him well,
  he began to talk of his nephew, Andor.</p>
  <p>That is to say, he bewailed the fact that his only brother&rsquo;s only
  child was dead, and that he&mdash;a poor sick man&mdash;had no one to look
  after him.</p>
  <p>He first spoke of this to Pater Bonif&aacute;cius, who was greatly shocked
  and upset to hear such casual news of Andor&rsquo;s death, and it was only
  bit by bit that he succeeded in dragging fuller particulars out of the sick
  man. It seems that when the lad&rsquo;s regiment was out in Bosnia there
  was an outbreak of cholera among the troops. Andor was one of those who succumbed.
  It had all occurred less than a month before his discharge was actually due,
  in fact these discharges had already been distributed to those who were sick,
  in the hope that the lads would elect to go home as soon as they could be
  moved, and thus relieve the Government of the burden and expense of their
  convalescence.</p>
  <p>But Lakatos Andor had died in the hospital of Slovnitza. An official letter
  announcing his demise was sent to Lakatos P&aacute;l, his uncle and sole
  relative, but Lakatos only threw the letter into a drawer and said nothing
  about it to anybody.</p>
  <p>It was nobody&rsquo;s business, he said. The Government would see to the
  lad&rsquo;s burial, no doubt, but some busy-bodies at Marosfalva might think
  that it was his&mdash;Lakatos&rsquo;&mdash;duty to put up a stone or something
  to the memory of his nephew: and that sort of nonsense was very expensive.</p>
  <p>So no one in Marosfalva knew that Andor had died of cholera in the hospital
  of Slovnitza until Lakatos P&aacute;l became sick, and in his loneliness
  spoke of the matter to Pater Bonif&aacute;cius.</p>
  <p>Then there was universal mourning in the village. Andor had always been
  very popular: good-looking, as merry as a skylark and a splendid dancer,
  he was always the life and soul of every entertainment. Girls who had flirted
  with him wept bitter tears, the mothers who thought how rich Andor would
  have been now that old Lakatos was sure to die very soon&mdash;sighed deep
  sighs of regret.</p>
  <p>Many there were who never believed that Andor was dead. He was not the lad
  to die of cholera: he might break his neck one day&mdash;riding or driving&mdash;for
  he was always daring and reckless&mdash;but to lie sick of cholera and to
  die in a hospital?&mdash;no, no, that did not seem like Andor.</p>
  <p>Presently it became known that the official letter&mdash;announcing the
  death&mdash;had not been quite in order; it was only a rumour&mdash;but the
  rumour quickly gained credence, it fitted in with popular sentiment. Pater
  Bonif&aacute;cius himself, who had seen the letter, declared that the wording
  of it was very curt and vague&mdash;much more curt and vague than such letters
  usually were. It seems that there were a great many cases of cholera in the
  isolation hospital at Slovnitza and lists were sent up daily from there to
  Budapest of new cases, of severe cases, of discharges and of deaths. In one
  of these lists Andor&rsquo;s name certainly did appear among the dead, and
  a brief note to that effect had been officially sent to Lakatos. But surely
  the news should have had confirmation!</p>
  <p>Where was the lad buried?</p>
  <p>Who was beside him when he died?</p>
  <p>Where were the few trinkets which he possessed; his mother&rsquo;s wedding-ring
  which he always wore on his little finger?</p>
  <p>Pater Bonif&aacute;cius wrote to the War Office at Budapest asking for a
  reply to these three questions. He received none. Then he persuaded Barna
  Jen&ouml;&mdash;the mayor&mdash;to write an official document. The War Office
  up at Budapest sent an equally official document saying that they had no
  knowledge on those three points: Lakatos Andor was one of those whose names
  appeared on the list of deaths from cholera at Slovnitza, and that was quite
  sufficient proof to offer to any reasonable human being.</p>
  <p>Pater Bonif&aacute;cius sighed in bitter disappointment, Lakatos P&aacute;l
  continued to bemoan his loneliness until he succeeded in persuading himself
  that he had always loved Andor as his own son, and that the lad&rsquo;s supposed
  death would presently cause his own.</p>
  <p>And the neighbours&mdash;especially the women&mdash;held on to the belief
  that Andor was not dead; they declared that he would return one day to enjoy
  the good-will of his rich uncle now, to marry a girl of Marosfalva, and to
  look forward to a goodly legacy from Pali b&aacute;csi by and by.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;They Are Jews And We Are Hungarians.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>But what of Elsa during this time? What of the sorrow, the alternating hope
  and despair of those weary, weary months? She did not say much, she hardly
  ever cried, but even her mother&mdash;hard and unemotional as she was&mdash;respected
  the girl&rsquo;s secret for awhile, after the news was brought into the cottage
  that Andor was really dead.</p>
  <p>Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la had brought the news, and Elsa, on hearing it thus
  blurted out in B&eacute;la&rsquo;s rough, cruel fashion, had turned deathly
  pale, ere she contrived to run out of the room and hide herself away in a
  corner, where she had cried till she had made herself sick and faint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you been blind all these years, Irma n&eacute;ni?&rdquo; Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la had said with his habitual sneer, when Irma threw up her bony
  hands in hopeless puzzlement at her daughter&rsquo;s behaviour. &ldquo;Did
  you not know that Elsa has been in love with Andor all along?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Irma in her quiet, matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;I
  did not know it. Did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; he replied dryly; &ldquo;but I have also
  known for the past six months that Andor was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You knew it?&rdquo; exclaimed Irma with obvious incredulity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have told you so, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;and
  I am not in the habit of lying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how did you come to know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he did not return last September I marvelled what had happened;
  I wonder no one else did. Then, when Lakatos P&aacute;l first became ill&mdash;long
  even before he confided in Pater Bonif&aacute;cius&mdash;I made inquiries
  at the War Office and found out the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever made you do that?&rdquo; asked Irma, with a shrug of the
  shoulders. &ldquo;Andor wasn&rsquo;t anything to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied B&eacute;la curtly; &ldquo;but, you see,
  I was afraid that Pali b&aacute;csi would die and that Andor would come back
  and find himself a rich man. I should have lost Elsa then, so I was in a
  hurry to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Irma once more shrugged her shoulders in her habitual careless, shiftless
  way&mdash;shelving, as it were, the whole responsibility of her life, her
  fate, and her daughter upon some other power than her own will. She cared
  nothing about these intrigues of B&eacute;la&rsquo;s or of anyone else; she
  only wanted Elsa to make a rich marriage, so that she&mdash;the mother&mdash;might
  have a happy, comfortable, above all leisurely, old age.</p>
  <p>But she had enough common sense to see that Elsa laboured under the weight
  of a very great sorrow, and while the girl was in such a condition of grief
  it would be worse than useless to worry her with suggestions of matrimony.
  Girls had been known to do desperate things if they were overharassed, and
  Kapus Irma was no fool; she knew what she wanted, and her instinct, coupled
  with her greed and cupidity, showed her the best way to get it.</p>
  <p>So she left Elsa severely alone for a time, left her to pursue her household
  duties, to look after her father, to wash and iron the finery of the more
  genteel inhabitants of Marosfalva&mdash;the schoolmistress&rsquo; blouses,
  Pater Bonif&aacute;cius&rsquo; surplices. Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la continued
  in his unemotional attentions to her&mdash;he was more sure of success than
  ever. His words of courtship were the drops of water that were ultimately
  destined to wear away a stone.</p>
  <p>Elsa, lulled into security by her mother&rsquo;s placidity and B&eacute;la&rsquo;s
  apparent simple friendship, hardly was conscious of the precise moment when
  the siege against her passive resistance was once more resumed. It was all
  so gradual, so kind, so persuasive: and she had so little to look forward
  to in the future. What did it matter what became of her?&mdash;whom she married
  or where her home would be? She saw more of Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la than she
  did of anyone else, for Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was undoubtedly Irma&rsquo;s
  most favoured competitor. Elsa knew that he was of violent temperament, dictatorial
  and rough; she knew that he was fond of drink, and of the society of Klara
  Goldstein, the Jewess, but she really did not care.</p>
  <p>She had kept her promise to Andor, she had waited for him until she knew
  that he never, never could come back; now she might as well obey her mother
  and put herself right with God, since she cared so little what became of
  her.</p>
  <p>And the beauty of Marosfalva was tokened to Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la in the
  spring of the following year, and presently it was given out that the wedding
  would take place on the feast of Holy Michael and All Angels at the end of
  September. Congratulations poured in upon the happy pair, rejoicings were
  held in every house of note in the village. Everyone was pleased at the marriage,
  pleased that the noted beauty would still have her home in Marosfalva, pleased
  that Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s wealth would all remain in the place.</p>
  <p>And Elsa received these congratulations and attended these rejoicings with
  unvarying equanimity and cheerfulness. There was nothing morbid or self-centred
  in the girl&rsquo;s attitude. People who did not know&mdash;and no one really
  did&mdash;and who saw her at mass on Sundays or walking arm-in-arm with B&eacute;la
  in the afternoons would say that she was perfectly happy. Not a radiant bride
  certainly, not a typical Hungarian <i>menyecske</i> whose laughter echoes
  from end to end of the village, whose merry voice rings all the day, and
  whose pretty bare feet trot briskly up and down from her cottage to the river,
  or to the church, or to a neighbour&rsquo;s house, but an equable, contented
  bride, a fitting wife for a person of such high consideration as was Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la.</p>
  <p>Her manner to him was always equally pleasant, and though the young pair
  did not exchange very loving glances&mdash;at any rate not in public&mdash;yet
  they were never known to quarrel, which was really quite remarkable, seeing
  that B&eacute;la&rsquo;s temper had not improved of late.</p>
  <p>He was giving way to drink more than he used to, and there were some ugly
  rumours about my lord the Count&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with his erstwhile
  highly-valued bailiff. Many people said that B&eacute;la would get his dismissal
  presently if he did not mend his ways; but then he very likely wouldn&rsquo;t
  care if he did get dismissed, he was a rich man and could give his full time
  to cultivating his own land.</p>
  <p>This afternoon, while he was talking with Irma and sullenly watching his
  future wife, he appeared to be quite sober, until a moment ago when unreasoning
  rage seized hold of him and he shouted to Elsa in a rough and peremptory
  manner. After that, his face, which usually was quite pallid, became hotly
  flushed, and his one seeing eye had a restless, quivering look in it.</p>
  <p>Nor did Elsa&rsquo;s placid gentleness help to cool his temper. When he
  shouted to her she turned and faced him, and said with a pleasant&mdash;if
  somewhat vague smile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, B&eacute;la, what is it you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it I want?&rdquo; he muttered, as he sank back into his chair,
  and resting his elbows on the table he buried his chin in his hands and looked
  across at the girl with a glowering and sullen look; &ldquo;what is it I
  want?&rdquo; he reiterated roughly. &ldquo;I want to know what has been the
  matter with you these last two days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing has been the matter with me,&rdquo; she replied quietly, &ldquo;nothing
  unusual, certainly. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because for the last two days you have been going about with a face
  on you fit for a funeral, rather than for a wedding. What is it? Let&rsquo;s
  have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, B&eacute;la. What should it be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you there is something,&rdquo; he rejoined obstinately, &ldquo;and
  what&rsquo;s more I can make a pretty shrewd guess what it is, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that the noted beauty of Marosfalva does me the honour of
  being jealous. Isn&rsquo;t that it, now? Oh! I know well enough, you needn&rsquo;t
  be ashamed of it, jealousy does your love for me credit, and flatters me,
  I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she reiterated
  more firmly. &ldquo;I am neither jealous nor ashamed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not ashamed?&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;Oho! look at your flaming cheeks!
  Irma n&eacute;ni, haven&rsquo;t you a mirror? Let her see how she is blushing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why she should be jealous,&rdquo; interposed Irma
  crossly, &ldquo;nor why you should be for ever teasing her. I am sure she
  has no cause to be ashamed of anything, or of being jealous of anyone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I tell you that she is jealous of Klara Goldstein!&rdquo; he
  maintained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; protested the mother, while the blush quickly
  fled from the young girl&rsquo;s cheeks, leaving them clear and bloodless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you she is,&rdquo; he persisted, with wrathful doggedness; &ldquo;she
  has been sullen and moody these last two days, ever since I insisted that
  Klara Goldstein shall be asked to-morrow to the farewell banquet and the
  dance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t see myself why you wanted that Jewess to come,&rdquo; said
  Irma dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I
  pay for the entertainment, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You certainly do,&rdquo; she rejoined calmly. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t
  possibly afford to give Elsa her maiden&rsquo;s farewell, and if you didn&rsquo;t
  pay for the supper and the gipsies, and the hire of the schoolroom, why,
  then, you and Elsa would have to be married without a proper send-off, that&rsquo;s
  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And a nice thing it would have been! Whoever heard of a girl on this
  side of the Maros being married without her farewell to maidenhood. I am
  paying for the supper and for everything because I want my bride&rsquo;s
  farewell to be finer and grander than anything that has ever been seen for
  many kilom&egrave;tres round. I have stinted nothing&mdash;begrudged nothing.
  I have given an ox, two pigs and a calf to be slaughtered for the occasion.
  I have given chickens and sausages and some of the finest flour the countryside
  can produce. As for the wine . . . well! all I can say is that there is none
  better in my lord&rsquo;s own cellar. I have given all that willingly. I
  did it because I liked it. But,&rdquo; he added, and once again the look
  of self-satisfaction and sufficiency gave way to his more habitual sinister
  expression, &ldquo;if I pay for the feast, I decide who shall be invited
  to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Irma apparently had nothing to say in response. She shrugged her shoulders
  and continued to stir the stew in her pot. Elsa said nothing either; obedient
  to the command of her future lord, she had faced him and listened to him
  attentively and respectfully all the while that he spoke, nor did her face
  betray anything of what went on within her soul, anything of its revolt or
  of its wounded pride, while the storm of wrath and of sneers thus passed
  unheeded over her head.</p>
  <p>But B&eacute;la, having worked himself up into a fit of obstinate rage,
  was not content with Elsa&rsquo;s passive obedience. There had from the first
  crept into his half-educated but untutored and undisciplined mind the knowledge
  that though Elsa was tokened to him, though she was submissive, and gentle
  and even-tempered, her heart did not belong to him. He knew but little about
  love, believed in it still less: in that part of the world a good many men
  are still saturated with the Oriental conception of a woman&rsquo;s place
  in the world, and even in the innermost recesses of their mind with the Oriental
  disbelief in a woman&rsquo;s soul; but in common with all such men he had
  a burning desire to possess every aspiration and to know every thought of
  the woman whom he had chosen for his wife.</p>
  <p>Therefore now, when in response to his rage and to his bombast Elsa had
  only silence for him&mdash;a silence which he knew must hide her real thoughts,
  he suddenly lost all sense of proportion and of prudence; for the moment
  he felt as if he could hate this woman whom he had wooed and won despite
  her resistance, and in the teeth of strenuous rivalry; he was seized with
  a purely savage desire to wound her, to see her cry, to make her unhappy&mdash;anything,
  in fact, to rouse her from this irritating apathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said at last, making a great effort to recover
  his outward self-control, &ldquo;I suppose that you object to my asking Klara
  Goldstein to come to your farewell feast?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus directly appealed to by her lover, Elsa gave a direct reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I ask why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A girl&rsquo;s farewell on the eve of her wedding-day,&rdquo; she
  replied quietly, &ldquo;is intended to be a farewell to her girl friends.
  Klara Goldstein was never a friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She belongs to this village, anyway, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he
  queried, still trying to speak calmly. He had risen to his feet and stood
  with squared shoulders, legs wide apart, and hands buried in the pockets
  of his tightly-fitting trousers. An ugly, ill-tempered, masterful man, who
  showed in every line of his attitude that he meant to be supreme lord in
  his own household.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Klara Goldstein belongs to this village,&rdquo; he reiterated with
  forced suavity, &ldquo;she is my friend, is she not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She may be your friend, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; rejoined Elsa gently, &ldquo;and
  she certainly belongs to this village; but she is not one of us. She is a
  Jewess, not a Hungarian, like we all are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has her religion to do with it?&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t her religion, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; persisted the girl,
  with obstinacy at least as firm as his own; &ldquo;you know that quite well.
  Though it is an awful thing to think that they crucified our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! that is a good long while ago,&rdquo; he sneered; &ldquo;and
  in any case Klara and Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I know. Therefore I said that religion had nothing to do with
  it. I can&rsquo;t explain it exactly, B&eacute;la, but don&rsquo;t we all
  feel alike about that? Hungarians are Hungarians, and Jews are Jews, and
  there&rsquo;s no getting away from that. They are different to us, somehow.
  I can&rsquo;t say how, but they are different. They don&rsquo;t speak as
  we do, they don&rsquo;t think as we do, their Sunday is Saturday, and their
  New Year&rsquo;s day is in September. Jewesses can&rsquo;t dance the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s
  and Jews have a contempt for our gipsy music and our songs. They are Jews
  and we are Hungarians. It is altogether different.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, unable apparently to gainsay this unanswerable
  argument. After all, he too was a Hungarian, and proud of that fact, and
  like all Hungarians at heart, he had an unexplainable contempt for the Jews.
  But all the same, he was not going to give in to a woman in any kind of disagreement,
  least of all on a point on which he had set his heart. So now he shifted
  his ground back to his original dictum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may talk as much as you like, Elsa,&rdquo; he said doggedly, &ldquo;but
  Klara Goldstein is my friend, and I will have her asked to the banquet first
  and the dance afterwards, or I&rsquo;ll not appear at it myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s clear, I hope?&rdquo; he added roughly, as Elsa, in
  her habitual peace-loving way, had made no comment on that final threat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is quite clear, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she now said passively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course the girl shall be asked, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; here interposed
  Irma n&eacute;ni, who had no intention of quarrelling with her wealthy son-in-law. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  see to it, and don&rsquo;t you lose your temper about it. Here! sit down
  again. Elsa, bring your father&rsquo;s chair round for supper. B&eacute;la,
  do sit down and have a bite. I declare you two might be married already,
  so much quarrelling do you manage to get through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But B&eacute;la, as sulky now as a bear with a sore head, refused to stay
  for supper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear sullen faces and dark looks,&rdquo; he said savagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  go where I can see pleasant smiles and have some fun. I must say, Irma n&eacute;ni,&rdquo; he
  added by way of a parting shot, as he picked up his hat and made for the
  door, &ldquo;that I do not admire the way you have brought up your daughter.
  A woman&rsquo;s place is not only to obey her husband, but to look cheerful
  about it. However,&rdquo; he added, with a dry laugh, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
  soon put that right after to-morrow, eh, my dove?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a perfunctory attempt at a more lover-like attitude, he turned
  to Elsa, who already had jumped to her feet, and with a pleasant smile was
  holding up her sweet face to her future lord for a kiss.</p>
  <p>She looked so exquisitely pretty then, standing in the gloomy half-light
  of this squalid room, with the slanting golden sunshine which peeped in through
  the tiny west window outlining her delicate silhouette and touching her smooth
  fair hair with gold.</p>
  <p>Vanity, self-satisfaction, and mayhap something a little more tender, a
  little more selfless, stirred in the young man&rsquo;s heart. It was fine
  to think that this beautiful prize&mdash;which so many had coveted&mdash;was
  his by right of conquest. Even the young lord whose castle was close by had
  told Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la that he envied him his good luck, whilst my lord
  the Count and my lady the Countess had of themselves offered to be present
  at the wedding and to be the principal witnesses on behalf of the most beautiful
  girl in the county.</p>
  <p>These pleasant thoughts softened B&eacute;la&rsquo;s mood, and he drew his
  fianc&eacute;e quite tenderly to him. He kissed her on the forehead and on
  the cheeks, but she would not let him touch her lips. He laughed at her shyness,
  the happy triumphant laugh of the conqueror.</p>
  <p>Then he nodded to Irma and was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is a very good fellow at heart,&rdquo; said the mother philosophically, &ldquo;you
  must try and humour him, Elsa. He is very proud of you really, and think
  what a beautiful house you will have, and all those oxen and pigs and a carriage
  and four horses. You must thank God on your knees for so much good fortune;
  there are girls in this village who would give away their ears to be standing
  in your shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, mother dear, I am very, very grateful for all my good fortune,&rdquo; said
  Elsa cheerfully, as with vigorous young arms she pulled the paralytic&rsquo;s
  chair round to the table and then got him ready for his meal.</p>
  <p>After which there was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Elsa and her mother each
  stood behind her own chair: the young girl&rsquo;s clear voice was raised
  to say a simple grace before a simple meal.</p>
  <p>The stew had not been put on the table, since B&eacute;la did not stay for
  supper. It would do for to-morrow&rsquo;s dinner, and for to-night maize
  porridge and rye bread would be quite sufficient.</p>
  <p>Elsa looked after her father and herself ate with a hearty, youthful appetite.
  Her mother could not help but be satisfied that the child was happy.</p>
  <p>The philosophy of life had taught Kapus Irma a good many lessons, foremost
  among these was the one which defined the exact relationship between the
  want of money and all other earthly ills. Certainly the want of money was
  the father of them all. Elsa in future would never feel it, therefore all
  other earthly ills would fall away from her for lack of support.</p>
  <p>It was as well to think that the child realized this, and was grateful for
  her own happiness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;I Put The Bunda Away Somewhere.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Kapus Irma went out after supper to hold a final consultation with the more
  influential matrons of Marosfalva over the arrangements for to-morrow&rsquo;s
  feast. Old Kapus had been put to bed on his paillasse in the next room and
  Elsa was all alone in the small living-room. She had washed up the crockery
  and swept up the hearth for the night; cloth in hand, she was giving the
  miserable bits of furniture something of a rub-down and general furbishing-up:
  a thing she could only do when her mother was away, for Irma hated her to
  do things which appeared like a comment on her own dirty, slatternly ways.</p>
  <p>Cleanliness, order and a love of dainty tidiness in the home are marked
  characteristics of the true Hungarian peasantry: the cottages for the most
  part are miracles of brightness, brightly polished floors, brightly polished
  pewter, brightly covered feather pillows. Kapus Irma was a notable exception
  to the rule, and Elsa had often shed bitter tears of shame when one or other
  of her many admirers followed her into her home and saw the squalor which
  reigned in it&mdash;the dirt and untidiness. She was most ashamed when B&eacute;la
  was here, for he made sneering remarks about it all, and seemed to take it
  for granted that she was as untidy, as slovenly as her mother. He read her
  long lectures about his sister&rsquo;s fine qualities and about the manner
  in which he would expect his own wife to keep her future home, and made it
  an excuse for some of his most dictatorial pronouncements and rough, masterful
  ways.</p>
  <p>But to-night even this had not mattered&mdash;though he had spoken very
  cruelly about the hemp&mdash;nothing now mattered any more. To-day she had
  been called for the third time in church, to-morrow evening she would say
  good-bye to her maidenhood and take her place for the last time among her
  girl-friends: after to-morrow&rsquo;s feast she would be a matron&mdash;her
  place would be a different one. And on Tuesday would come the wedding and
  she would be Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s wedded wife.</p>
  <p>So what did anything matter any more? After Tuesday she would not even be
  allowed to think of Andor, to dream that he had come back and that the past
  two dreadful years had only been an ugly nightmare. Once she was Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la&rsquo;s wedded wife, it would be no longer right to think of
  that last morning five years ago, of that final cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, and
  the words which Andor had whispered: above all, it would no longer be right
  to remember that kiss&mdash;his warm lips upon her bare shoulder, and later
  on, out under the acacia tree, that last kiss upon her lips.</p>
  <p>She closed her eyes for a moment; a sigh of infinite regret escaped through
  her parted lips. It would have been so beautiful, if only it could have come
  true! if only something had been left to her of those enchanted hours, something
  more tangible than just a memory.</p>
  <p>Resolutely now she went back to her work; for the past two years she had
  found that she could imagine herself to be quite moderately happy, if only
  she had plenty to do; and she did hope that B&eacute;la would allow her to
  work in her new home and not to lead a life of idleness&mdash;waited on by
  paid servants.</p>
  <p>She had thrown the door wide open, and every now and then, when she paused
  in her work, she could go and stand for a moment under its narrow lintel;
  and from this position, looking out toward the west, she could see the sunset
  far away beyond where the plain ended, where began another world. The plumed
  heads of the maize were tipped with gold, and in the sky myriads and myriads
  of tiny clouds lay like a gigantic and fleecy comet stretching right over
  the dome of heaven above the plain to that distant horizon far, far away.</p>
  <p>Elsa loved to watch those myriads of clouds through the many changes which
  came over them while the sun sank so slowly, so majestically down into the
  regions which lay beyond the plain. At first they had been downy and white,
  like the freshly-plucked feathers of a goose, then some of them became of
  a soft amber colour, like ripe maize, then those far away appeared rose-tinted,
  then crimson, then glowing like fire . . . and that glow spread and spread
  up from the distant horizon, up and up till each tiny cloud was suffused
  with it, and the whole dome of heaven became one fiery, crimson, fleecy canopy,
  with peeps between of a pale turquoise green.</p>
  <p>It was beautiful! Elsa, leaning against the frame-work of the door, gazed
  into that gorgeous immensity till her eyes ached with the very magnificence
  of the sight. It lasted but a few minutes&mdash;a quarter of an hour, perhaps&mdash;till
  gradually the blood-red tints disappeared behind the tall maize; they faded
  first, then the crimson and the rose and the gold, till, one by one, the
  army of little clouds lost their glowing robes and put on a grey hue, dull
  and colourless like people&rsquo;s lives when the sunshine of love has gone
  down&mdash;out of them.</p>
  <p>With a little sigh Elsa turned back into the small living-room, which looked
  densely black and full of gloom now by contrast with the splendour which
  she had just witnessed. From the village street close by came the sound of
  her mother&rsquo;s sharp voice in excited conversation with a neighbour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be all right, Irma n&eacute;ni,&rdquo; the neighbour said,
  in response to some remark of the other woman. &ldquo;Klara Goldstein does
  not expect our village girls to take much notice of her. But I will say that
  the men are sharp enough dangling round her skirts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted Irma, &ldquo;and I wish to goodness B&eacute;la
  had not set his heart on having her at the feast. He is so obstinate: once
  he has said a thing . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&eacute;la&rsquo;s conduct in this matter is not to be commended,
  my good Irma,&rdquo; said the neighbour sententiously; &ldquo;everyone thinks
  that for a tokened man it is a scandal to be always hanging round that pert
  Jewess. Why didn&rsquo;t he propose to her instead of to Elsa, if he liked
  her so much better?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush! hush! my good Mariska, please. Elsa might hear you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two women went on talking in whispers. Elsa had heard, of course, what
  they said: and since she was alone a hot blush of shame mounted to her cheeks.
  It was horrid of people to talk in that way about her future husband, and
  she marvelled how her own mother could lend herself to such gossip.</p>
  <p>Irma came in a few minutes later. She looked suspiciously at her daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you keep the door open?&rdquo; she asked sharply, &ldquo;were
  you expecting anybody to come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only you, mother, and Pater Bonif&aacute;cius is coming after vespers,&rdquo; replied
  the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I stopped outside for a bit of gossip with Mariska just now. Could
  you hear what she said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, mother. I did hear something of what Mariska said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About B&eacute;la?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About him&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hej, child! you must not take any notice of what folks say&mdash;it
  is only tittle-tattle. You must not mind it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it, mother. I am sure that it is only tittle-tattle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your father in bed?&rdquo; asked Irma abruptly changing the subject
  of conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you have been busying yourself, I see,&rdquo; continued the mother,
  looking round her with obvious disapproval, &ldquo;with matters that do not
  concern you. I suppose B&eacute;la has been persuading you that your mother
  is incapable of keeping her own house tidy, so you must needs teach her how
  to do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, mother, nothing was further from my thoughts. I had nothing to
  do after I had cleared and washed up, and I wanted something to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you wanted something to do you might have got out your father&rsquo;s
  bunda&rdquo; (big sheepskin cloak worn by the peasantry) &ldquo;and seen
  if the moth has got into it or not. It is two years since he has had it on,
  and he will want it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I really must tell you because of the bunda, Jank&oacute; and
  M&oacute;ritz and Jen&ouml; and P&aacute;l have offered to carry him to the
  feast in his chair just as he is. We&rsquo;ll put his bunda round him, and
  they will strap some poles to his chair, so that they can carry him more
  easily. They offered to do it. It was to be a surprise for you for your farewell
  to-morrow: but I had to tell you, because of getting the bunda out and seeing
  whether it is too moth-eaten to wear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While Irma went on talking in her querulous, acid way, Elsa&rsquo;s eyes
  had quickly filled with tears. How good people were! how thoughtful! Was
  it not kind of M&oacute;ritz and Jen&ouml; and the others to have thought
  of giving her this great pleasure?</p>
  <p>To have her poor old father near her, after all, when she was saying farewell
  to all her maidenhood&rsquo;s friends! And what a joy it would be to him!&mdash;one
  that would brighten him through many days to come.</p>
  <p>Oh! people were good! It was monstrously ungrateful to be unhappy when one
  lived among these kind folk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is the bunda, mother?&rdquo; she asked eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  see to it at once. And if the moths are in it, why I must just patch the
  places up so that they don&rsquo;t show. Where is the bunda, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Irma thought a moment, then she frowned, and finally shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; she said petulantly; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it
  in your room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, mother. I haven&rsquo;t seen it since father wore it last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that was two years ago&mdash;almost to a day. I remember it quite
  well. It was quite chilly, and your father put on his bunda to go down the
  street as far as the Jew&rsquo;s house. It was after sunset, I remember.
  He came home and went to bed. The next morning he was stricken. And I put
  the bunda away somewhere. Now wherever did I put it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stood pondering for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under his paillasse?&rdquo; she murmured to herself. &ldquo;No. In
  the cupboard? No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the dower-chest, mother?&rdquo; suggested Elsa, who knew of old
  that that article of furniture was the receptacle for everything that hadn&rsquo;t
  a proper place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Look at the bottom,&rdquo; said Irma placidly, &ldquo;it might
  be there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was getting dark now. Through the open door and the tiny hermetically
  closed windows the grey twilight peeped in shyly. The more distant corner
  of the little living-room, that which embraced the hearth and the dower-chest,
  was already wrapped in gloom.</p>
  <p>Elsa bent over the worm-eaten piece of furniture: her hands plunged in the
  midst of maize-husks and dirty linen of cabbage-stalks and sunflower-seeds,
  till presently they encountered something soft and woolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here is the bunda, mother,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! get it out now, and lay it over a chair. You can have a
  look at it to-morrow&mdash;there will be plenty of time before you need begin
  to dress,&rdquo; said Irma, who held the theory that it was never any use
  doing to-day what could conveniently be put off until to-morrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I have a look at it now, mother?&rdquo; asked Elsa,
  as she struggled with the heavy sheepskin mantle and drew it out of the surrounding
  rubbish; &ldquo;the light will hold out for another half-hour at least, and
  to-morrow morning I shall have such a lot to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may do what you like while the light lasts, my girl, but I won&rsquo;t
  have you waste the candle over this stupid business. Candle is very dear,
  and your father will never wear his bunda again after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t waste the candle, mother. But Pater Bonif&aacute;cius
  is coming in to see me after vespers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does he want to come at an hour when all sensible folk are in
  bed?&rdquo; queried Irma petulantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t come earlier, mother dear; you know how busy he
  is always on Sundays . . . benediction, then christenings, then vespers.
  . . . He said he would be here about eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman, &ldquo;who ever
  heard of such a ridiculous hour? And candles are so dear&mdash;there&rsquo;s
  only a few centim&egrave;tres of it in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only light the candle, mother, when the Pater comes,&rdquo; said
  Elsa, with imperturbable cheerfulness; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just sit by the
  open door now and put a stitch or two in father&rsquo;s bunda while the light
  lasts: and when I can&rsquo;t see any longer I&rsquo;ll just sit quietly
  in the dark, till the Pater comes. I shall be quite happy,&rdquo; she added,
  with a quaint little sigh, &ldquo;I have such a lot to think about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; retorted Irma, &ldquo;and I shall go and do my
  thinking in bed. I shall have to be up by six o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
  I expect, and anyhow I hate sitting up in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned to go into the inner room, but Elsa&mdash;moved by a sudden impulse&mdash;ran
  after her and put her arms round her mother&rsquo;s neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you kiss me, mother?&rdquo; she said wistfully. &ldquo;You
  won&rsquo;t do it many more times in my old home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A home you have often been ashamed of, my child,&rdquo; the mother
  said sullenly.</p>
  <p>But she kissed the girl&mdash;if not with tenderness, at any rate with a
  curious feeling of pity which she herself could not have defined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, my girl,&rdquo; she said, with more gentleness than was
  her wont. &ldquo;Sleep well for the last time in your old bed. I doubt if
  to-morrow you&rsquo;ll get into it at all, and don&rsquo;t let the Pater
  stay too long and waste the candle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise, mother,&rdquo; said Elsa, with a smile; &ldquo;good-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;Then, As Now, May God Protect You.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The bunda was very heavy. Elsa dragged it over her knee, and sat down on
  a low stool in the open doorway. She had pulled the table a little closer,
  and on it were her scissors, needles and cotton, as well as the box of matches
  and the candle which she would be allowed to light presently when Pater Bonif&aacute;cius
  came.</p>
  <p>The moth certainly had caused many ravages in the sheepskin cloak&mdash;there
  were tiny holes everywhere, and the fur when you touched it came out in handfuls.
  But as the fur would be turned inwards, that wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much.
  The bunda was quite wearable: there was just a bad tear in the leather close
  to the pocket, which might show and which must be mended.</p>
  <p>Elsa threaded her needle, and began to hum her favourite song under her
  breath:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Nincsen annyi tenger csillag az &eacute;gen<br>
    Mint a h&aacute;nyszor
  vagy eszembe te n&eacute;kem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There are not so many myriads of stars in the sky as the number of
  times that my thoughts fly to thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was determined not to think any more of the past. In a few hours now
  that Chapter in her life would be closed, and it was useless and wicked to
  be always thinking of the &ldquo;might-have-been.&rdquo; Rather did she set
  herself resolutely to think of the future, of that part of it, at any rate,
  which was bright. There would be her mother installed in that comfortable
  house on the Kender Road, and with a nice bit of land and garden round in
  which to grow vegetables and keep some poultry. There would be her three
  cows and the pigs which B&eacute;la was giving her, and which he would graze
  on his own land.</p>
  <p>Above all, there would be the comfortable bed and armchair for the sick
  man, and the little maid to wait upon him.</p>
  <p>There was so much, so much to be thankful for! And since God chose to take
  Andor away, what else was there to live for, save to see her mother and father
  contented?</p>
  <p>The light was going fast. Elsa had made a splendid job of that one pocket.
  The other, too, wanted a stitch. It was very badly torn&mdash;if only the
  feeble light would hold out another ten minutes . . . that hole, too, would
  be securely mended.</p>
  <p>With the splendid disregard of youth for its most precious gift, Elsa strained
  her eyes to thread her needle once more.</p>
  <p>She tackled the second pocket of the shabby bunda. There was a long tear
  at the side, as if the wearer&rsquo;s hand had missed the actual pocket and
  been thrust carelessly or roughly through the leather.</p>
  <p>Elsa put her hand through the hole, too, to see the extent of the mischief.
  Yes! that was it, her father must more than once have missed the pocket and
  put his hand into the hole, making it bigger and bigger. Why! there was a
  whole lot of rubbish deep down inside the lining. Elsa drew out an empty
  tobacco-pouch, a bit of string, a length of tinder, and from the very bottom,
  where it lay in a crinkled mass, a ball of crumpled paper.</p>
  <p>This she smoothed out, holding it over her knee. It was a letter&mdash;one
  which must have been delivered on the very day when her father last wore
  the bunda. The envelope had not been broken: old Kapus hadn&rsquo;t had time
  to read his letter, the last which he had received before living death encompassed
  him. The tears gathered in Elsa&rsquo;s eyes at thought of her father handling
  this very letter with shaking yet still living hands: now they were incapable
  even of gripping this tiny piece of paper.</p>
  <p>But then&mdash;two years ago, her mother said it was, almost to a day when
  last he wore the bunda&mdash;then he had received the letter from the postman
  and evidently thrust it into his pocket, meaning to read it at some more
  convenient time.</p>
  <p>The peasants of that part of the world have never quite lost their distrust
  of railways, of telegrams, and even of letters&mdash;they are half-afraid
  of them all, afraid with that vague, unreasoning fear which animals have
  for things they see yet cannot understand.</p>
  <p>Elsa handled this unopened letter with something of that same fear. She
  did not think at first of looking at the superscription. Who could have been
  writing to her father two years ago? He had no rich friends who could afford
  to spend money on note-paper and stamps. There was no news in the great outer
  world which someone could have wished to impart to him. The light indeed
  was very dim before Elsa, sitting here with the old bunda on her knee, thought
  of looking more closely at the envelope.</p>
  <p>She bent down and out toward the light, trying to decipher the writing.</p>
  <p>The letter was addressed to her.</p>
  <p>Oh! it was quite clear!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tekintetes Kapus Elsa kisasszonynak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was quite, quite clearly written. The letter was addressed to her. The
  postman had brought it here two years ago: her father had taken it from him
  and thrust it into the pocket of his bunda, meaning to give it presently
  to his daughter.</p>
  <p>But that evening perhaps he forgot it altogether: he had been drinking rather
  heavily of late. And the next day he was stricken down with paralysis, his
  tongue refused him service, and he no longer could tell his daughter&mdash;as
  no doubt he wanted to do&mdash;that a letter had come for her and that it
  was in the pocket of his bunda.</p>
  <p>And the bunda was thrust away into the dower-chest with the husks of maize
  and the cabbage-stalks, and it had never been taken out until to-night&mdash;the
  eve of Elsa&rsquo;s wedding-day.</p>
  <p>She tore open the envelope now with fingers that trembled slightly. The
  light was very dim, and where the glorious sunset had been such a little
  while ago there was only the dull grey canopy of an overcast sky. But Elsa
  could just make out the writing: already her eye had wandered to the signature, &ldquo;your
  ever-devoted Andor.&rdquo; The message seemed to come to her as from the
  grave, for she thought that these were probably Andor&rsquo;s last words
  to her, penned just before he died in that awful hospital in Bosnia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My sweet dove!&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;This is to tell you that I
  am well: although it has been a close fight between life and death for me.
  But I did so want to live, my sweetheart, for I have you to look forward
  to in life. I have been at death&rsquo;s door, and I believe that the doctor
  here, before he went away one evening, signed the paper to say that I was
  dead. But that same night I took a turn for the better, and it was wonderful
  how soon I was up again. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it some day, my love,
  some day when I come to claim your promise that you would wait for me. Because,
  dear heart, while I have been ill I have been thinking very seriously. I
  have not a silver florin to bless myself with: how can I come and dare to
  ask you to be my wife? Your father and mother would kick me out of their
  house, they would forbid me to see you; they would part you from me, my dear,
  beautiful angel, and I should feel that it was just. I&mdash;a good-for-nothing,
  penniless lout, daring to approach the queen of beauty, the most exquisite
  girl on God&rsquo;s earth. I have thought it all over, dear heart, and all
  will be well if you will be true to me&mdash;if you will wait for me another
  two years. Oh! I do not ask you to do it, I am not worthy of your love. Who
  am I, that you should keep yourself for me?&mdash;but I will pray to God
  night and day that He may not take away your love from me. I am going to
  America, dear heart, with an English gentleman who has been very kind to
  me. He was the English Consul at Cettinje, and when there were so many of
  us&mdash;Hungarian lads&mdash;lying sick of that awful cholera in the hospital
  at Slovnitza, his wife, a sweet, kind lady, used to come and visit us and
  cheer us up. She was very ugly and had big teeth and no waist, but she was
  an angel of goodness. She took some interest in me, and once when I was still
  very weak and ill I told her about you, about our love and what little hope
  I had of ever winning you, seeing that I was penniless. She was greatly interested,
  and when I was finally allowed to leave the hospital, she told me to come
  and see her husband, the English Consul. Well! dear heart, this kind gentleman
  is sending me out to a farm which he possesses in a place called Australia&mdash;I
  think that it is somewhere in America, but I am not sure. When I get there
  I shall receive more wage in one week than our alf&ouml;ld labourers get
  in three months, and it will all be good money, of which I can save every
  fill&eacute;r, because my food and housing will be given to me free, and
  the kind English lady&mdash;may the Virgin protect her, despite her large
  teeth and flat chest&mdash;gave me a whole lot of clothes to take with me.
  So every fill&eacute;r which I earn I can save, and I reckon that in two
  years I shall have saved two thousand florins&rdquo; (about &pound;160) &ldquo;and
  then I shall come home. If I still find you free, my dove&mdash;which I pray
  to God I may do&mdash;we can get married at once. Then we&rsquo;ll rent the
  Lepke farm from Pali b&aacute;csi, as I shall have plenty of money for the
  necessary security, and if we cannot make that pay and become rich folk within
  three years, then I am not the man whom I believe myself to be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, my darling love, do not think for a moment that I want to bind
  you to me against your will. God only knows how deeply I love you; during
  the last three years the thought of you has been the sunshine of my days,
  the light of my nights. If, when you have received and pondered over this
  letter, you send me a reply to say that you still love me, that you will
  be true to me and will wait for my return, then you will change my world
  into a paradise. No work will be too hard, no difficulty too great to surmount,
  if it will help me the sooner to come back to you. But if, on the other hand,
  you tell me or leave me to guess that I am a fool for thinking that you would
  waste your beauty and your sweetness on waiting for a good-for-nothing scamp
  like me, why, then, I shall understand. I shall go out to America&mdash;or
  wherever that place called Australia may be&mdash;but maybe I shall never
  come back. But I should never curse you, dear heart, I should never cease
  to love you: I should quite understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have got one of the nurses at the hospital to write this letter
  for me, to put my rough words into good Hungarian and to write down my thoughts
  in a good, clear hand. That is how it comes to be so well written. You know
  I was never much of a hand with a pen and paper, but I do love you, my dove!
  My God, how I love you.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The nurse says that Australia is not in America at all&mdash;that
  it is a different place altogether. Well! I do not care where it is. I am
  going there because there I can earn one hundred florins a month, and save
  enough in two years to marry you and keep you in comfort. But I shall not
  see you, my dove, before I go: if I saw you again, if I saw Hungary again,
  our village, our alf&ouml;ld, Heaven help me! but I don&rsquo;t think I would
  have the heart to go away again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, dear heart, I go away full of hope. We go off next week
  in a big, big ship from here. I go full of sadness, but if you do want me
  to come back just write me a little letter with the one word &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and
  address it as above. Then will my sadness be changed to heavenly joy and
  hope. But if it is to be &lsquo;No,&rsquo; then tell me so quite truly,
  and I will understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, as now, may God protect you, my dove, my heart,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your ever-devoted</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The letter fell out of Elsa&rsquo;s hands on to her knee. She took no heed
  of it, she was staring out into the immensity far away, into the fast-gathering
  gloom. Two years ago! Two years of sorrow and vain regrets which never need
  have been. One word from her father or from the postman, the feel of crisp
  paper in her father&rsquo;s bunda when it was put away two years ago, and
  the whole course of her life would have been changed.</p>
  <p>The village street behind her was silent now, even the footsteps of belated
  folk hurrying to their homes sent up no echo from the soft, sandy ground.
  And before her the fast-gathering night was slowly wrapping the plain in
  its peace-giving shroud. Inside the cottage all was still: mother and father
  lay either asleep or awake thinking of the morrow.</p>
  <p>A great, heavy sob shook the young girl&rsquo;s vigorous young frame. It
  seemed too wantonly cruel, this decree of Fate which had withheld from her
  the light of her life. How easy it would have been to wait! How swiftly these
  two years would have flown past. Her heart would have kept young&mdash;waiting
  for Andor and for happiness, whereas now it was numb and unsentient, save
  for a feeling of obedience and of filial duty, of pity for her mother and
  father, and of resignation to her future state.</p>
  <p>Indeed Fate was being wantonly cruel to her to the last in thus putting
  before her eyes a picture of the might-have-been just when it was too late.
  In a few hours from now the great vow would be spoken, the irrevocable knot
  tied which bound her to another man. Her troth was already plighted, her
  confession made to Pater Bonif&aacute;cius&mdash;in a few hours from now
  she would be B&eacute;la&rsquo;s wife, and if Andor did come back now, she
  must be as nothing to him, he as a mere distant friend.</p>
  <p>But probably he never would come back. He received no reply to his fond
  letter of farewell, not one word from her to cheer him on his way. No doubt
  by now he had made a home for himself in that far distant land. Another woman&mdash;a
  stranger&mdash;revelled in the sunshine of his love, while Elsa, whose whole
  life had been wrapped up in him, was left desolate.</p>
  <p>For a moment a wild spirit of revolt rose in her. Was it too late, after
  all? Was any moment in life too late to snatch at fleeing happiness? Why
  shouldn&rsquo;t she run away to-night&mdash;now?&mdash;find that unknown
  country, that unknown spot where Andor was? Surely God would give her strength!
  God could not be so unjust and so cruel as men and Fate had been!</p>
  <p>Pater Bonif&aacute;cius, turning from the street round the angle of the
  cottage, found her in this mood, squatting on the low stool, her elbows on
  her knees, her face buried in her hands. He came up to her quite gently,
  for though his was a simple soul it was full of tenderness and of compassion
  for the children of these plains whom God had committed into his charge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa, my girl,&rdquo; he asked softly, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;The Best Way Of All.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Pater Bonif&aacute;cius had placed his kindly hand on the girl&rsquo;s hunched-up
  shoulders, and there was something in his touch which seemed to soothe the
  wild paroxysm of her grief. She raised her tear-stained face to his, and
  without a word&mdash;for her lips were shaking and she could not have spoken
  then&mdash;she handed him Andor&rsquo;s letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I go in,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and light the candle? It is
  too dark now to read.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose quickly, and with an instinctive sense of respect for the parish
  priest she made hasty efforts to smooth her hair and to wipe her face with
  her apron. Then she turned into the room, and though her hand still trembled
  slightly, she contrived to light the candle.</p>
  <p>The old priest adjusted his horn-rimmed spectacles on his nose and drew
  a chair close to the light.</p>
  <p>He sat down and read Andor&rsquo;s letter through very slowly. When he had
  finished, he handed it back to Elsa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s ways, my child, are mysterious,&rdquo; he said, with
  a short sigh; &ldquo;it is not for us to question them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mysterious?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, with passionate wrath; &ldquo;I
  call them cruel and unjust, pater! What have I done, that He should have
  done this to me? Andor loved me and I loved him, he wrote me a letter full
  of love, begging for a word from me to assure him that I would always love
  him and that I would wait for him. Why was that letter kept from me? Why
  was I not allowed to reply to it? My father would not have kept the letter
  from me, had he not been stricken down with paralysis on the very day when
  it came. It is God who kept my happiness away from me. It is God who has
  spoilt my life and condemned me to regrets and wretchedness, when I had done
  nothing to deserve such a cruel fate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is God,&rdquo; interposed the priest gently, &ldquo;who even at
  this moment forgives an erring child all the blasphemy which she utters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Elsa, dry-eyed and with quivering lips, still looked the personification
  of revolt, he placed his warm, gentle hands upon hers and drew her a little
  closer to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we, then,&rdquo; he asked softly, &ldquo;such very important
  things in the scheme of God&rsquo;s entire creation that everything must
  be ordered so as to suit us best?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only wanted to be happy,&rdquo; murmured Elsa, in a quivering voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You only wanted to be happy in your own way, my child,&rdquo; rejoined
  the priest, as he patted her hands tenderly, &ldquo;but it does not happen
  to have been God&rsquo;s way. Now who shall say which is the best way of
  being happy? Who knows best? You or God?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the postman had given me the letter, and not to father,&rdquo; she
  murmured dully, &ldquo;if father had not been stricken down with illness
  the very next day, if I had only had this letter two years ago, instead of
  to-day . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the sentence was left unfinished, broken by a bitter sigh of regret.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it all had been as you say, my child,&rdquo; said Pater Bonif&aacute;cius
  kindly, &ldquo;then you might perhaps have been happy according to your
  own light, whereas now you are going to be happy in accordance with that
  of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head and once more her eyes filled with tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall never be happy again,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you will, my dear,&rdquo; retorted the kindly old man, whose
  rugged face&mdash;careworn and wrinkled&mdash;was lit up with a half-humorous,
  wholly indulgent smile; &ldquo;it is wonderful what a capacity for happiness
  the good God has given to us all. The only thing is that we can&rsquo;t always
  be happy in our own way; but the other ways&mdash;if they are God&rsquo;s
  ways&mdash;are very much better, believe me. Why He chose to part you from
  Andor,&rdquo; he added, with touching simplicity, &ldquo;why He chose to
  withhold that letter from you until to-night, we shall probably never know.
  But that it was His way for your future happiness, of that I am convinced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There could have been no harm this time, Pater, in Andor and I being
  happy in our way. There could be no wrong in two people caring for one another,
  and wanting to live their lives together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! that we shall never know, my child. The book of the &lsquo;might-have-been&rsquo; is
  a closed one for us. Only God has the power to turn over its pages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor and I would have been so happy!&rdquo; she reiterated, with
  the obstinacy of a vain regret; &ldquo;and life would have been an earthly
  paradise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And perhaps you would have forgotten heaven in that earthly paradise;
  who knows, your happiness might have drawn you away from God, you might have
  spent your life in earthly joys, you might have danced and sung and thought
  more and more of pleasure, and less and less of God. Who knows? Whereas now
  you are just going to be happy in God&rsquo;s way: you are going to do your
  duty by your mother and your father, and, above all, by your husband. You
  are going to fill your life by thoughts of God first and then of others,
  instead of filling it with purely selfish joys. You are going to walk up
  the road of life, my child, with duty to guide you over the roughnesses and
  hard stones that will bestrew your path: and every roughness which is surmounted,
  every hardship which is endured, every sacrifice of self which is offered
  up to One who made the greatest possible sacrifice for us all, will leave
  you happier than before . . . happier in God&rsquo;s way, the best way of
  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He talked on for a long while in this gentle, heartfelt way, and gradually,
  as the old man spoke, the bitterness and revolt died out of the simple-minded
  child&rsquo;s heart. Hers, after all, was a simple faith&mdash;but as firmly
  rooted within her as her belief in the sunshine, the alternating days and
  nights, the turns of the season. And the kind priest, who after life&rsquo;s
  vicissitudes had found anchorage in this forlorn village in the midst of
  the plains, knew exactly how to deal with these childlike souls. Like those
  who live their lives upon the sea, the Hungarian peasant sees only immensity
  around him, and above him that wonderful dome which hides its ineffable mysteries
  behind glorious veils of sunset and sunrise, of storm and of fantastic clouds.
  The plain stretches its apparently limitless expanse to a distance which
  he&mdash;its child&mdash;has never reached. Untutored and unlearned, he does
  not know what lies beyond that low-lying horizon into whose arms the sun
  sinks at evening in a pool of fire.</p>
  <p>Everything around him is so great, so vast, so wonderful&mdash;the rising
  and setting of the sun, the stars and moon at nights, the gathering storms,
  the rainfalls, the sowing of the maize and the corn, the travail of the earth
  and the growing and developing of the stately heads of maize from one tiny,
  dried, yellow grain&mdash;that he has no inclination for petty casuistry,
  for arguments or philosophy. God&rsquo;s work is all that he ever sees: the
  book of life and death the only one he reads.</p>
  <p>And because of that simple faith, that sublime ignorance, Elsa found comfort
  and peace in what Pater Bonif&aacute;cius said. I will not say that she ceased
  to regret, nor that the grief of her heart was laid low, but her heart was
  soothed, and to her already heavy sorrow there was no longer laid the additional
  burden of a bitter resentment.</p>
  <p>Then for awhile after he had spoken the priest was silent. No one knew better
  than he did the exact value of silence, whilst words had time to sink in.
  So they both remained in the gloom side by side&mdash;he the consoler and
  she the healed. The flickering candle light played curious and fantastic
  tricks with their forms and faces, lighting up now and then the wrinkled,
  wizened face of the old man, with the horn-rimmed spectacles perched upon
  his nose, and now and then the delicate profile of the girl, the smooth,
  fair tresses and round, white neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we not say a little prayer together?&rdquo; whispered Pater
  Bonif&aacute;cius at last, &ldquo;just the prayer which our dear Lord taught
  us&mdash;Our Father which art in heaven . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly the young girl sank on her knees beside the gentle comforter; her
  fair head was bowed, her face hidden in her hands. Word for word now she
  repeated after him the sublime invocation taught by Divine lips.</p>
  <p>And when the final whispered Amen ceased to echo in the low, raftered room,
  Pater Bonif&aacute;cius laid his hand upon the child&rsquo;s head in a gesture
  of unspoken benediction.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;After That, Happiness Will Begin.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Pater Bonif&aacute;cius&rsquo; kindliness, his gentle philosophy and unquestioning
  faith exercised a soothing influence over Elsa&rsquo;s spirits. The one moment
  of rebellion against Fate and against God, before the arrival of the old
  priest, had been the first and the last.</p>
  <p>There is a goodly vein of Oriental fatalism still lurking in the Hungarians: &ldquo;God
  has willed it!&rdquo; comes readily enough to their lips. Though this unsophisticated
  child of the plains suffered none the less than would her more highly-cultured
  sisters in the West, yet she was more resigned&mdash;in her humble way, more
  philosophical&mdash;accepting the inevitable with an aching heart, mayhap,
  but with a firm determination to make the best of the few shreds of happiness
  which were left to her.</p>
  <p>Elsa had promised before God and before the whole village that she would
  marry Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la on the feast of St. Michael and All Angels, and
  after that single thought of rebellion, she knew that on the following Tuesday
  this would have to be just as surely as the day follows the night and the
  night the day.</p>
  <p>Even that selfsame evening, after the Pater had gone and before she went
  to bed, she made her final preparations for the next three days, which were
  the turning-points of her life. To-morrow her farewell banquet: a huge feast
  in the big schoolroom, hired expressly for the occasion. Fifty people would
  sit down to that, they were the most intimate friends of the contracting
  parties, hers and B&eacute;la&rsquo;s, and her mother&rsquo;s. It is the
  rule that the bride&rsquo;s parents provide this entertainment, but Kapus
  Benk&oacute; and his wife had not the means for it, and Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la,
  insisting upon a sumptuous feast, was ready enough to pay for this gratification
  of his own vanity.</p>
  <p>After the banquet, dancing would begin and would be kept up half the night.
  Then the next morning was the wedding-day. The wedding Mass in the morning,
  then the breakfast, more dancing, more revelling, more jollification, also
  kept up throughout the night. For it is only on the day following, that the
  bridegroom goes to fetch his bride out of her home, to conduct her to his
  own with all the pomp and circumstance which his wealth allows. So many carts,
  so many oxen, so many friends in the carts, and so many gipsies to make music
  while the procession slowly passes up the village street.</p>
  <p>All that was, of course, already arranged for. The banquet for to-morrow
  was prepared, the ox roasted whole, the pigs and the capons stuffed. Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la had provided everything, and provided most lavishly. Fifty persons
  would sit down to the farewell banquet, and more like two hundred to the
  wedding-breakfast; the village was agog with excitement, gipsies from Arad
  had been engaged, my lord the Count and the Countess were coming to the wedding
  Mass! . . . how could one feeble, weak, ignorant girl set her will against
  this torrent?</p>
  <p>Elsa, conscious of her helplessness, set to with aching heart, but unwavering
  determination to put the past entirely behind her.</p>
  <p>What was the good of thinking, since Fate had already arranged everything?</p>
  <p>She went to bed directly after the Pater went away, because there was no
  more candle in the house, and because her mother kept calling querulously
  to her; and having stretched her young limbs out upon the hard paillasse,
  she slept quite peacefully, because she was young and healthy and did not
  suffer from nerves, and because sorrow had made her very weary.</p>
  <p>And the next morning, the dawn of the first of those all-important three
  days, found her busy, alert, quite calm outwardly, even though her cheeks
  had lost something of their rosy hue, and her blue eyes had a glitter in
  them which suggested unshed tears.</p>
  <p>There was a lot to do, of course: the invalid to get ready, the mother&rsquo;s
  dressing to see to, so that she should not look slovenly in her appearance,
  and call forth some of those stinging remarks from B&eacute;la which had
  the power to wound the susceptibilities of his fianc&eacute;e.</p>
  <p>Irma was captious and in a tearful humour, bemoaning the fact that she was
  too poor to pay for her only daughter&rsquo;s farewell repast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoever heard of a bridegroom paying for his fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s
  farewell?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will despise your poor parents now,
  Elsa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was certainly an unusual thing under the circumstances; the maiden&rsquo;s
  farewell to the friends of her girlhood, to their parents and belongings,
  is a great event in this part of the world in connection with the wedding
  festivities themselves, of which it is the precursor. The parents of the
  bride invariably provide the entertainment, and do so in accordance with
  their means.</p>
  <p>But Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was a proud man in the county: he would not hear
  of any festival attendant upon his marriage being less than gorgeous and
  dazzling before the eyes of the whole countryside. He chose to pay the piper,
  so that he might call the tune, and though Elsa&mdash;wounded in her own
  pride&mdash;did her best to protest, she was overruled by her mother, who
  was only too thankful to see this expensive burden taken from off her shoulders.</p>
  <p>Kapus Irma was a proud mother to-day, for as Elsa finally stood before her,
  arrayed in all her finery for the coming feast, she fully justified her right
  to be styled &ldquo;the beauty of the county.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A picture she looked from the top of her small head, with its smooth covering
  of fair hair, yellow as the ripening corn, to the tips of her small, arched
  feet, encased in the traditional boots of bright crimson leather.</p>
  <p>Her fair hair was plaited closely from the crown of her head and tied up
  with strands of red, white and green ribbons, nor did the hard line of the
  hair drawn tightly away from the face mar the charm of its round girlishness.
  It gave it its own peculiar character&mdash;semi-oriental, with just a remaining <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of
  that mysterious ancestry whose traditions are lost in the far-off mountains
  of Thibet.</p>
  <p>The tight-fitting black corslet spanned the girlish figure, and made it
  look all the more slender as it seemed to rise out of the outstanding billows
  of numberless starched petticoats. Necklace and earrings made of beads of
  solid gold&mdash;a present from B&eacute;la to his fianc&eacute;e&mdash;gave
  a touch of barbaric splendour to this dainty apparition, whilst her bare
  shoulders and breast, her sturdy young arms and shapely, if toil-worn, hands
  made her look as luscious a morsel of fresh girlhood as ever gladdened the
  heart of man.</p>
  <p>Irma surveyed her daughter from head to foot with growing satisfaction.
  Then, with a gesture of unwonted impulse, she took the young girl by the
  shoulders and, drawing her closely to her own bony chest, she imprinted two
  sounding kisses on the fresh, pale cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said lustily, &ldquo;your mother&rsquo;s kiss ought
  to put some colour in those cheeks. Heigho, child!&rdquo; she added with
  a sigh, as she wiped a solitary tear with the back of her hand, &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t wonder you are pale and frightened. It is a serious step for
  a girl to take. I know how I felt when your father came and took me out of
  my mother&rsquo;s house! But for you it is so easy: you are leaving a poor,
  miserable home for the finest house this side of the Maros and a life of
  toil and trouble for one of ease! To-day you are still a maid, to-morrow
  you will be a married woman, and the day after that your husband will fetch
  you with six carts and forty-eight oxen and a gipsy band and all his friends
  to escort you to your new home, just as every married woman in the country
  is fetched from her parents&rsquo; home the day after she has spoken her
  marriage vows. After that your happiness will begin: you will soon forget
  the wretched life you have had to lead for years, helping me to put maize
  into a helpless invalid&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall never forget my home, dear mother,&rdquo; said Elsa earnestly, &ldquo;and
  every fill&eacute;r which I earned and which helped to make my poor father
  comfortable was a source of happiness to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; grunted the mother dryly, &ldquo;you have not looked these
  past two years as if those sources of happiness agreed with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall look quite happy in the future, mother,&rdquo; retorted Elsa
  cheerily; &ldquo;especially when I have seen you and father installed in
  that nice house in the Kender Road, with your garden and your cows and your
  pigs and a maid to wait on you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Irma na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;B&eacute;la promised me
  all that if I gave you to him: and I think that he is honest and will keep
  to his promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Elsa was silent, she continued fussily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, now, I think I had better go over to the schoolroom and see
  that everything is going on all right. I don&rsquo;t altogether trust Ilona
  and her parsimonious ways. Such airs she gives herself, too! I must go and
  show her that, whatever B&eacute;la may have told her, I am the hostess at
  the banquet to-day, and mean to have things done as I like and not as she
  may choose to direct. . . . Now mind you don&rsquo;t allow your father to
  disarrange his clothes. M&oacute;ritz and the others will be here by about
  eleven, and then you can arrange the bunda round him after they have fixed
  the carrying-poles to his chair. We sit down to eat at twelve o&rsquo;clock,
  and I will come back to fetch you a quarter of an hour before that, so that
  you may walk down the street and enter the banqueting place in the company
  of your mother, as it is fitting that you should do. And don&rsquo;t let
  anyone see you before then: for that is not proper. When you fix the bunda
  round your father&rsquo;s shoulders, make all the men go out of the house
  before you enter the room. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know how particular B&eacute;la is that everything should be
  done in orderly and customary style, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; replied Elsa, without the slightest touch of
  irony; &ldquo;I know how much he always talks about propriety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though you are not his wife,&rdquo; continued Irma volubly, &ldquo;and
  won&rsquo;t be until to-morrow, you must begin to-day to obey him in all
  things. And you must try and be civil to Klara Goldstein, and not make B&eacute;la
  angry by putting on grand, stiff airs with the woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will do my best, mother dear,&rdquo; said Elsa, with a quick short
  sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; concluded Irma, as she finally turned toward
  the door, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t crumple your petticoats when you sit down, and
  don&rsquo;t go too near the hearth, there is some grease upon it from this
  morning&rsquo;s breakfast. Don&rsquo;t let anyone see you and wait quietly
  for my return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having delivered herself of these admonitions, which she felt were incumbent
  upon her in her interesting capacity as the mother of an important bride,
  Irma at last sailed out of the door. Elsa&mdash;obedient to her mother and
  to convention, did not remain standing beneath the lintel as she would have
  loved to do on this beautiful summer morning, but drew back into the stuffy
  room, lest prying eyes should catch sight of the heroine of the day before
  her state entry into the banqueting hall.</p>
  <p>With a weary little sigh she set about thinking what she could do to kill
  the next two hours before M&oacute;ritz and Jen&ouml; and those other kind
  lads came to take her father away. With the door shut the room was very dark:
  only a small modicum of light penetrated through the solitary, tiny window.
  Elsa drew a chair close beside it and brought out her mending basket and
  work-box. But before settling down she went back into the sleeping-room to
  see that the invalid was not needing her.</p>
  <p>Of course he always needed her, and more especially to-day, one of the last
  that she would spend under his roof. He was not tearful about her departure&mdash;his
  senses were too blunt now to feel the grief of separation&mdash;he only felt
  pleasantly excited, because he had been told that M&oacute;ritz and Jen&ouml; and
  the others were coming over presently and that they meant to carry him in
  his chair, just as he was, so that he could be present at his daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;maiden&rsquo;s
  farewell.&rdquo; This had greatly elated him: he was looking forward to the
  rich food and the luscious wine which his rich future son-in-law was providing
  for his guests.</p>
  <p>And now, when Elsa came to him, dressed in all her pretty finery, he loved
  to look on her, and his dulled eyes glowed with an enthusiasm which had lain
  atrophied in him these past two years.</p>
  <p>He was like a child now with a pretty doll, and Elsa, delighted at the pleasure
  which she was giving him, turned about and around, allowed him to examine
  her beautiful petticoats, to look at her new red boots and to touch with
  his lifeless fingers the beads of solid gold which her fianc&eacute; had
  given her.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, while she was thus displaying her finery for the benefit of her
  paralytic father, she heard the loud bang of the cottage door. Someone had
  entered, someone with a heavy footstep which resounded through the thin partition
  between the two rooms.</p>
  <p>She thought it must be one of the young men, perhaps, with the poles for
  the carrying-chair; and she wondered vaguely why he had come so early.</p>
  <p>She explained to the invalid that an unexpected visitor had come, and that
  she must go and see what he wanted; and then, half ashamed that someone should
  see her contrary to her mother&rsquo;s express orders and to all the proprieties,
  she went to the door and opened it.</p>
  <p>The visitor had not closed the outer door when he had entered, and thus
  a gleam of brilliant September daylight shot straight into the narrow room;
  it revealed the tall figure of a man dressed in town clothes, who stood there
  for all the world as if he had a perfect right to do so, and who looked straight
  on Elsa as she appeared before him in the narrow frame of the inner door.</p>
  <p>His face was in full light. She recognized him in the instant.</p>
  <p>But she could not utter his name, she could not speak; her heart began to
  beat so fast that she felt that she must choke.</p>
  <p>The next moment his arms were round her, he kicked the outer door to with
  his foot, and then he dragged her further into the room; he called her name,
  and all the while he was laughing&mdash;laughing with the glee of a man who
  feels himself to be supremely happy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;It Is Too Late.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>And now there he was, as of old, sitting, as was his wont, on the corner
  of the table, his two strong hands firmly grasping Elsa&rsquo;s wrists. She
  held him a little at arm&rsquo;s length, frightened still at the suddenness
  of his apparition here&mdash;on this day&mdash;the day of her farewell feast.</p>
  <p>When first he drew her to him, she had breathed his name&mdash;softly panting
  with excitement, &ldquo;Andor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The blood had rushed to her cheeks, and then flowed back to her heart, leaving
  her pale as a lily. She did not look at him any more after that first glance,
  but held her head bent, and her eyes fixed to the ground. Slowly the tears
  trickled down her cheeks one by one.</p>
  <p>But he did not take his glowing, laughing eyes away from her, though he,
  too, was speechless after that first cry of joy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held her wrists and in a happy, irresponsible way was swinging her arms
  out and in, all the while that he was drinking in the joy of seeing her again.</p>
  <p>Surely she was even more beautiful than she had ever been before. He did
  not notice that she was dressed as for a feast, he did not heed that she
  held her head down and that heavy tears fell from her eyes. He had caught
  the one swift look from her blue eyes when she first recognized him: he had
  seen the blush upon her cheeks then; the look and the blush had told him
  all that he wanted to know, for they had revealed her soul to him. Manlike,
  he looked no further. Happiness is such a natural thing for wretched humanity
  to desire, that it is so much easier to believe in it than in misery when
  it comes.</p>
  <p>At last he contrived to say a few words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa! how are you, my dove?&rdquo; he said na&iuml;vely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am quite well, thank you, Andor,&rdquo; she murmured through her
  tears.</p>
  <p>Then she tried to draw her wrists out of his tenacious clutch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I not kiss you, Elsa?&rdquo; he asked, with a light, happy laugh&mdash;the
  laugh of a man sure of himself, and sure of the love which will yield him
  the kiss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you like, Andor,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>She could not have denied him the kiss, not just then, at any rate, not
  even though every time that his warm lips found her eyes, her cheeks, her
  neck, she felt such a pain in her heart that surely she thought that she
  must die of it.</p>
  <p>After that he let her wrists go, and she went to sit on a low stool, some
  little distance away from him. Her cheeks were glowing now, and it was no
  use trying to disguise her tears. Andor saw them, of course, but he did not
  seem upset by them: he knew that girls were so different to men, so much
  more sensitive and tender: and so now he was only chiding himself for his
  roughness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ought to have prepared you for my coming, Elsa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  am afraid it has upset you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Andor, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did want to surprise you,&rdquo; he continued na&iuml;vely. &ldquo;Not
  that I ever really doubted you, Elsa, even though you never wrote to me.
  I thought letters do get astray sometimes, and I was not going to let any
  accursed post spoil my happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course not, Andor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not write to me, did you, Elsa?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Andor. I did not write.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you had my letter? . . . I mean the one which I wrote to you
  before I sailed for Australia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The postman,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;gave it to father when it
  came. Then the next day father was stricken with paralysis; he never gave
  it to me. Only last night . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he broke in excitedly, &ldquo;and yet you remained
  true to me all this while, even though you did not know if I was alive or
  dead! Holy Mother of God, what have I done to deserve such happiness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she did not speak&mdash;for indeed the words in her throat were
  choked by her tears&mdash;he continued talking volubly, like a man who is
  intoxicated with the wine of joy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I never doubted you, Elsa! But I had planned my home-coming to
  be a surprise to you. It was not a question of keeping faith, of course,
  because you were never tokened to me, therefore I just wanted to read in
  your dear eyes exactly what would come into them in the first moment of surprise
  . . . whether it would be joy or annoyance, love or indifference. And I was
  not deceived, Elsa, for when you first saw me such a look came into your
  eyes as I would not exchange for all the angels glances in Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Elsa sighed heavily. She felt so oppressed that she thought her heart must
  burst. Andor&rsquo;s happiness, his confidence made the hideous truth itself
  so much more terrible to reveal. And now he went on in the same merry, voluble
  way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went first to Goldstein&rsquo;s this morning. I thought Klara would
  tell me some of the village gossip to while away the time before I dared
  present myself here. I didn&rsquo;t want Pali b&aacute;csi or anybody to
  see me before I had come to you. I didn&rsquo;t want anybody to speak to
  me before I had kissed you. The Jews I didn&rsquo;t mind, of course. So I
  got Klara to walk with me by a round-about way through the fields as far
  as this house; then I lay in wait for a while, until I saw Irma n&eacute;ni
  go out. I wanted you all to myself at once . . . with no one by to intercept
  the look which you would give me when first you recognized me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And . . . did Klara tell you anything?&rdquo; she murmured under
  her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She told me of uncle Pali&rsquo;s illness,&rdquo; he said, more quietly, &ldquo;and
  how he seemed to have fretted about me lately . . . and that everyone here
  thought that I was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. What else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing else much,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for you may be sure
  I would not do more than just mention your sweet name before that Jewess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And . . . when you mentioned my name . . . did she say anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. She laughed rather funnily, I thought. But of course I would
  not take any notice. She had always been rather jealous of you. And now that
  I am a rich man . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Andor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I say a rich man,&rdquo; he said, with a careless shrug of his
  broad shoulders, &ldquo;I only mean comparatively, of course. I have saved
  three thousand crowns&rdquo;&mdash;(about &pound;120)&mdash;&ldquo;not quite
  as much as I should have liked; but things are dear out there, and there
  was my passage home and clothes to pay for. Still! three thousand crowns
  are enough to pay down as a guarantee for a really good farm, and if Klara
  Goldstein spoke the truth, and Pali b&aacute;csi is really so well disposed
  toward me, why, I need not be altogether ashamed to present myself before
  your parents. Need I, my dove?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before my parents?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said, as he rose from the table now and came
  up quite close to her, looking down with earnest, love-filled eyes on the
  stooping figure of this young girl, who held all his earthly happiness in
  her keeping; &ldquo;you knew what I meant, Elsa, did you not, when I came
  back to you the moment that I could, after all these years? It was only my
  own poverty which kept me from your side all this long while. But you did
  not think that I had forgotten you, did you, Elsa?&mdash;you could not think
  that. How could a man forget you who has once held you in his arms and kissed
  those sweet lips of yours? Why, there has not been a day or night that I
  did not think of you. . . . Night and day while I worked in that land which
  seemed so far away from home. Homesick I was&mdash;very often&mdash;and though
  we all earned good money out there, the work was hard and heavy; but I didn&rsquo;t
  mind that, for I was making money, and every florin which I put by was like
  a step which brought me nearer to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The poor girl was almost moaning now, for every word which he spoke was
  like a knife-thrust straight into her heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being so far away from home,&rdquo; he continued, speaking slowly
  and very earnestly now, in a voice that quivered and shook with the depth
  of the sentiment within him, &ldquo;being so far away from home would have
  been like hell to me at times. I don&rsquo;t know what there is, Elsa, about
  this land of Hungary! how it holds and enchains us! but at times I felt that
  I must lie down and die if I did not see our maize-fields bordered with the
  tall sunflowers, our distant, low-lying horizon on which the rising and the
  setting sun paints such glowing colours. This land of Australia was beautiful
  too: there were fine fields of corn and vast lands stretching out as far
  as the eye could reach; but it was not Hungary. There were no white oxen
  with long, slender horns toiling patiently up the dusty high roads, the storks
  did not build their nests in the tall acacia trees, nor did the arms of distant
  wells stretch up toward the sky. It was not Hungary, Elsa! and it would have
  been hell but for thinking of you. The life of an exile takes all the life
  out of one. I have heard of some of our Hungarian lads out in America who
  get so ill with homesickness that they either die or become vicious. But
  then,&rdquo; he added, with a quick, characteristic return to his habitual
  light-hearted gaiety, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t everyone who is far from home
  who has such a bright star as I had to gaze at in my mind . . . when it came
  night time and the lights were put out . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor!&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
  <p>But he would not let her speak just then. He had not yet told her all that
  there was to say, and perhaps the innate good-heartedness in him suggested
  that she was discomposed, that she would prefer to sit quietly and listen
  whilst she collected her thoughts and got over the surprise of his sudden
  arrival.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know, Elsa,&rdquo; he now said gaily, &ldquo;I chalked up
  the days&mdash;made marks, I mean, in a book which I bought in Fiume the
  day before we sailed. Seven hundred and thirty days&mdash;for I never meant
  to stay away more than two years; and every evening in my bunk on board ship
  and afterwards in the farm where I lodged, I scratched out one of the marks
  and seemed to feel myself getting a little bit nearer and then nearer to
  you. By the Saints, my dove,&rdquo; he added, with a merry laugh, &ldquo;but
  you should have seen me the time I got cheated out of one of those scratches.
  I had forgotten that accursed twenty-ninth of February last year. I don&rsquo;t
  think that I have ever sworn so wickedly in my life before. I had to go to
  Melbourne pretty soon, I tell you, and make confession of it to the kind
  Pater there. And then . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused abruptly. The laughter died upon his lips and the look of gaiety
  out of his eyes, for Elsa sat more huddled up in herself than before. He
  could no longer see her face, for that was hidden in her hands, he only saw
  her bowed shoulders, and that they were shaking as if the girl had yielded
  at last to a paroxysm of weeping.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa!&rdquo; he said quietly, as a puzzled frown appeared between
  his brows, &ldquo;Elsa! . . . you don&rsquo;t say anything . . . you . .
  . you . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He passed his rough hand across his forehead, on which rose heavy beads
  of perspiration. For the first time in the midst of his joy and of his happiness
  a hideous doubt had begun to assail him.</p>
  <p>A hideous, horrible, poison-giving doubt!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa!&rdquo; he pleaded, and his voice grew more intense, as if behind
  it there was an undercurrent of broken sobs, &ldquo;Elsa, what is the matter?
  You are not going to turn your back on me, are you? Look at me, Elsa! look
  at me! You wouldn&rsquo;t do it, would you . . . you wouldn&rsquo;t do it?
  . . . The Lord forgive me, but I love you, Elsa . . . I love you fit to kill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was babbling like a child, and now he fell on his knees beside that low
  stool on which she sat hunched up, a miserable bundle of suffering womanhood.
  He hid his face in her petticoats&mdash;those beautiful, starched petticoats
  that were not to be crumpled&mdash;and all at once his manliness broke down
  in the face of this awful, awful doubt, and he sobbed as if his heart would
  break.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor! Andor!&rdquo; she cried, overwhelmed with pity for him, pity
  for herself, with the misery and the hopelessness of it all. &ldquo;Andor,
  I beg of you, pull yourself together. Someone might come . . . they must
  not see you like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She put her hand upon his head and passed her cool, white fingers through
  his hair. The gentle, motherly gesture soothed him: her words brought him
  back to his senses. Gradually his sobs were stilled; he made a great effort
  to become quite calm, and with a handkerchief wiped the tears and perspiration
  from his face.</p>
  <p>Then he rose and went back to the table, and sat down on the corner of it
  as he always liked to do. The workings of his face showed the effort which
  he made to keep his excitement and those awful fears in check.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are quite right, Elsa,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;Someone
  might come, and it would not be a very fine home-coming for Lakatos Andor,
  would it? to be found crying like an infant into a woman&rsquo;s petticoats.
  Why, what would they think? That we had quarrelled, perhaps, on this my first
  day at home. God forgive me, I quite lost myself that time, didn&rsquo;t
  I? It was foolish,&rdquo; he added, with heartbroken anxiety, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t
  it, Elsa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Andor,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was foolish,&rdquo; he reiterated, still speaking calmly, even
  though his voice was half-choked with sobs, &ldquo;it was foolish to think
  that you would turn your back on a fellow who had just lived these past five
  years for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, Andor,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that?&rdquo; he repeated dully, and once more the
  frown of awful puzzlement appeared between his dark, inquiring eyes. &ldquo;Then
  what is it? No, no, Elsa!&rdquo; he added quickly, seeing that she threw
  a quick look of pathetic anxiety upon him, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid,
  my dove. I am not going to make a fool of myself again. You . . . you are
  not prepared to marry me just now, perhaps . . . not just yet?&mdash;is that
  it? . . . You have been angry with me. . . . I am not surprised at that .
  . . you never got my letter . . . you thought that I had forgotten you .
  . . and you want to get more used to me now that I am back . . . before we
  are properly tokened. . . . Is that it, Elsa? . . . I&rsquo;ll have to wait,
  eh?&mdash;till the spring, perhaps . . . till we have known one another better
  again . . . then . . . perhaps . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was speaking jerkily, and always with that burning anxiety lurking in
  the tone of his voice. But now he suddenly cried out like a poor creature
  in pain, vehemently, appealingly, longing for one word of comfort, one brief
  respite from this intolerable misery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t speak, Elsa! . . . you don&rsquo;t speak. . .
  . My God, why don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she replied slowly, monotonously, for now she seemed to have lost even
  the power of suffering pain. It was all so hopeless, so dreary, so desolate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can never marry you, Andor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stared at her almost like one demented, or as if he thought that she,
  perhaps, had lost her reason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can never marry you,&rdquo; she repeated firmly, &ldquo;for I am
  tokened to Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la. My farewell banquet is to-day; to-morrow
  is my wedding day; the day after I go to my new home. I can never marry you,
  Andor. It is too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She watched him while she spoke, vaguely wondering within her poor, broken
  heart when that cry of agony would escape his lips. His face had become ghastly
  in hue, his mouth was wide open as if ready for that cry; his twitching fingers
  clutched at the neckband of his shirt.</p>
  <p>But the cry never came: the wound was too deep and too deadly for outward
  expression. He said nothing, and gradually his mouth closed and his fingers
  ceased to twitch. Presently he rose, went to the door, and pulled it open;
  he stood for a moment under the lintel, his arm leaning against the frame
  of the door, and the soft September breeze blew against his face and through
  his hair.</p>
  <p>From far away down the village street came the sound of laughter and of
  singing. The people of Marosfalva were very merry to-day, for it was Kapus
  Elsa&rsquo;s wedding time and Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was being lavish with
  food and wine and music. Nobody guessed that in this one cottage sorrow,
  deep and lasting, had made a solemn entry and never meant to quit these two
  loving hearts again.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;He Must Make You Happy.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Andor shut the door once more. He did not want the people of the village
  to see him just now.</p>
  <p>He turned back quietly into the room, and went to sit at his usual place,
  across the corner of the table. Elsa, mechanically, absently, as one whose
  mind and soul and heart are elsewhere, was smoothing out the creases in her
  gown made wet by Andor&rsquo;s tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did it all come about, Elsa?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; she replied listlessly, &ldquo;since Klara
  Goldstein told you&mdash;that everyone here believed that you were dead.
  I did not believe it myself for a long time, though I did think that if you
  had lived you would have written to me. Then, as I had no news from you .
  . . no news . . . and mother always wished me to marry B&eacute;la . . .
  why! I thought that since you were dead nothing really mattered, and I might
  as well do what my mother wished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he muttered under his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were so poor at home,&rdquo; she continued, in that same listless,
  apathetic voice, for indeed she seemed to have lost all capacity even for
  suffering, &ldquo;and father was so ill . . . he wanted comfort and good
  food, and mother and I could earn so very little . . . B&eacute;la promised
  mother that nice house in the Kender Road, he promised to give her cows and
  pigs and chickens. . . . What could I do? It is sinful not to obey your parents
  . . . and it seemed so selfish of me to nurse thoughts of one whom I thought
  dead, when I could give my own mother and father all the comforts they wanted
  just by doing what they wished. . . . I had to think of father and mother,
  Andor. . . . What could I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is so, Elsa,&rdquo; he assented, speaking very slowly and deliberately.
  . . . &ldquo;That is so, of course . . . I understand . . . I ought to have
  known . . . to have guessed something of the kind at any rate. . . . My God!&rdquo; he
  added, with renewed vehemence, &ldquo;but I do seem to have been an accursed
  fool!&mdash;thinking that everything would go on just the same while I was
  weaving my dreams out there on the other side of the globe. . . . I ought
  to have guessed, I suppose, that they wouldn&rsquo;t leave you alone . .
  . you the prettiest girl in the county. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I held out as long as I could. . . . But I felt that if you were
  dead nothing really mattered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My poor little dove,&rdquo; he whispered gently.</p>
  <p>Gradually he felt a great calmness descending over him. It was her helplessness
  that appealed to him, the pathos of her quiet resignation: he felt how mean
  and unmanly it would be to give way to that rebellious rage which was burning
  in his veins. Three years under the orders of ofttimes brutal petty officers
  had taught him a measure of self-restraint; the two further years of hard,
  unceasing toil under foreign climes, the patient amassing of florin upon
  florin to enable him to come back and claim the girl whom he loved, had completed
  the work of changing an irresponsible, untrammelled child of these Hungarian
  plains into a strong, well-balanced, well-controlled man of a wider world.
  His first instinct, when the terrible blow had been struck to all his hopes
  and all his happiness, had been the wild, unreasoning desire to strike back,
  and to kill. Had he been left to himself just then and then found himself
  face to face with the man who had robbed him of Elsa, the semi-civilization
  of the past five years would have fallen away from him, he would once more
  have relapsed into the primeval, unfettered state of his earlier manhood.
  The crude passions of these sons of the soil are only feebly held in check
  by the laws of their land: at times they break through their fetters, and
  then they are a law unto themselves.</p>
  <p>But Andor loved Elsa with a gentler and purer love than usually dwells in
  the heart of a man of his stamp. He had proved this during the past five
  years spent in daily, hourly thoughts of her. Now that he found her in trouble,
  he would not add to her burden by parading his own before her.</p>
  <p>Manlike, his first thought had been to kill, his second to seize his love
  with both arms and to carry her away with him, away from this village, from
  this land, if need be. After all, she was not yet a wife, and the promise
  of marriage is not so sacred nor yet so binding as a marriage vow.</p>
  <p>He could carry her away, leaving the scandal-mongers to work their way with
  her and him: he could carry her to that far-off land which he knew already,
  where work was hard and money plentiful, and no one would have the right
  to look down on her for what she had done. But seeing her there, looking
  so helpless and so pathetic, he knew, by that unerring intuition which only
  comes to a man at such times as this, that such a dream could never be fulfilled.
  The future was as it was, as no doubt it had been pre-ordained by God and
  by Fate: nothing that he could do or say now would have the power to alter
  it. Tradition, filial duty and perhaps a certain amount of womanly weakness
  too, were all ranged up against him; but filial duty would fight harder than
  anything else and would remain the conqueror in the end.</p>
  <p>The relentless hand of the Inevitable was already upon him, and because
  of it, because of that vein of Oriental fatalism which survives in every
  Hungarian peasant, the tumult in his soul had already subsided, and he was
  able to speak to Elsa now with absolute gentleness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So to-day is your maiden&rsquo;s farewell, is it?&rdquo; he asked
  after awhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! It must be getting late,&rdquo; she said, as she rose from the
  low stool and shook out her many starched skirts, &ldquo;mother will be back
  directly to fetch me for the feast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be in the schoolroom, I suppose,&rdquo; he said indifferently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And some of the lads are coming over presently to fetch father.
  They have arranged to carry him all the way. Isn&rsquo;t it good of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To carry him all the way?&rdquo; he asked, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father has not moved for two years,&rdquo; she said simply; &ldquo;he
  was stricken with paralysis, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! Klara told me something about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So in order to give me the pleasure of having father near me at my
  farewell feast, M&oacute;ritz and Jen&ouml; and Imre and Jank&oacute; are
  going to fasten long poles to his chair and carry him to the schoolroom and
  back. Isn&rsquo;t it good of them? And I think they mean to do the same thing
  to-morrow and carry him to church. We are going to put his bunda round his
  shoulders. He has not worn his bunda for two years. . . . It was yesterday,
  when I took it out in order to mend it, that I found the letter which you
  wrote me from Fiume. It had slipped between the pocket and the lining and
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And are you happy, Elsa?&rdquo; he broke in abruptly.</p>
  <p>She hesitated almost imperceptibly for a moment, then she said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Andor. I am fairly happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&eacute;la?&rdquo; he asked again. &ldquo;Is he fond of you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she said more firmly, &ldquo;I am quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t taken to drinking, has he? . . . He was a little
  inclined that way at one time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, with a shrug of her shoulders, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  think that he drinks more than other fellows of his age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She went over to the window and somewhat ostentatiously, he thought, began
  turning over the contents of her work-box. There was something in her attitude
  now which worried him, and she seemed more determined than ever not to look
  him straight in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa! I shall think the worst if you tell me nothing,&rdquo; he said
  firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing to tell, Andor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; he persisted; &ldquo;there is something about
  B&eacute;la which makes you unhappy and which you won&rsquo;t tell me. .
  . . Now, listen to me, Elsa, for I mean every word which I am going to say
  . . . I can bring myself to the point of seeing you married to another man
  and happy in your new home, even though my own heart will break in the process
  . . . but what I could never stand would be to see you married to another
  man and made unhappy by him. . . . So if you won&rsquo;t tell me what is
  on your mind with regard to B&eacute;la, I will pick a quarrel with him this
  afternoon, and kill him if I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so wildly, Andor,&rdquo; she said, as she turned
  and faced him, for she was a little frightened at his earnestness and knew
  that he had it in him to act just as he said he would. &ldquo;The whole thing
  is only foolishness on my part, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there is something?&rdquo; he persisted obstinately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said, after a little more hesitation, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
  only that he will go hanging about at the Goldsteins&rsquo; all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s Klara, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear that girl,&rdquo; said Elsa, with sudden vehemence.</p>
  <p>He looked at her keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are jealous, Elsa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it because you love
  B&eacute;la?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like his hanging round Klara,&rdquo; she replied evasively.</p>
  <p>He rose from the table, drawing in his breath as he did so, with a curious
  hissing sound; perhaps the pain which he felt now was harder to bear even
  than that caused by the first crushing blow. The Inevitable had indeed placed
  its cruel hand upon his happiness; not all the boundless wealth of his love,
  of his will and of his daring could ever give Elsa back to him again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had better go now, I suppose,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother will be here directly,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t
  you see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not just yet, I think. I thought of asking Pater Bonif&aacute;cius
  if he could give me a bed for a night. Pali b&aacute;csi might not be ready
  for me yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you will come to my farewell feast?&rdquo; asked Elsa, with that
  unconscious cruelty of which good women are so often capable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you wish it, Elsa,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do wish it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and everyone will be so happy
  to see you. They would think it strange if you did not come, for everyone
  will know by then that you have returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I will come,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
  <p>He went up to her and held out his hand; she put her own upon it. Of course
  he did not ask for a kiss; he had no longer a right to that. Somehow, in
  the last few moments a barrier seemed to have sprung up between him and her
  which had obliterated all the past. He was a stranger now to her and she
  to him; that day five years ago was as if it had never been. B&eacute;la
  and her plighted troth to him stood now between Andor and that past which
  he must forget.</p>
  <p>But as he stood now holding her hand, he looked at her earnestly, and her
  blue eyes, dimmed but serene, met his own gaze without flinching.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The past, Elsa,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is done with. Henceforth we
  shall be nothing to one another. You will forget me easily enough. . . .
  I wish that I had never come back to disturb the peace which I see is rapidly
  spreading over your life. My only wish now is that with you it should be
  peace. My heart has already given you up to B&eacute;la&mdash;but not unconditionally,
  mind. . . . He must make you happy . . . I tell you that he must,&rdquo; he
  reiterated, almost fiercely. &ldquo;If he does not, he will have to reckon
  with me. Heaven help him, I say, if he is ever unkind to you. . . . I shall
  see it, I shall know it. . . . I shall not leave this village till I am assured
  that he means to be kind&mdash;that he <i>is</i> kind to you, even though
  my heart should break in remaining a witness to your happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stooped, and with the innate chivalry peculiar to the Hungarian peasantry,
  he kissed the small, cold hand which trembled in his grasp: he kissed it
  as a noble lord would kiss the hand of a princess. Then, without looking
  on her again, he walked quietly out of the house, and Elsa was alone with
  yet another bitter-sweet memory to add to her store of regrets.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;It Is True.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>By the time that Andor turned the corner of the house into the street, he
  found that the news of his arrival had already spread through the village
  like wildfire. Klara Goldstein&rsquo;s ready tongue had been at work this
  past hour; she had quickly disseminated the news that the wanderer had come
  home. She did not say that the malice and love of mischief in her had caused
  her to say nothing to Andor about Elsa&rsquo;s coming wedding. She merely
  told the first neighbour whom she came across that Lakatos Andor had come
  back, just as she, for one, had always declared that he would.</p>
  <p>Andor&rsquo;s friends had assembled in the street in a trice; here was too
  glorious an opportunity to shout and to sing and to make merry, to be lightly
  missed. And Andor had always been popular before. He was doubly so now that
  he had come back from America or wherever he may have been, and had made
  a fortune there; he shook one hundred and fifty hands before he could walk
  as far as the presbytery. The gypsies who had just arrived by train from
  Arad were not allowed to proceed straight to the schoolroom. They were made
  to pause in the great open place before the church, made to unpack their
  instruments then and there, and to strike up the R&aacute;k&oacute;czy March
  without more ado, in honour of the finest son of Marosfalva, who had been
  thought dead by some, and had returned safe and sound to his native corner
  of the earth.</p>
  <p>It was with much difficulty that at last Andor succeeded in effecting his
  escape and running away from the series of ovations which greeted him when
  and wherever he was recognized. The women embraced him without further ado,
  the men worried him to tell them some of his adventures then and there. Above
  all, everyone wanted to hear how very much more wretched, uncomfortable and
  God-forsaken the rest of the wide, wide world was in comparison with Hungary
  in general and the village of Marosfalva in particular.</p>
  <p>The heartfelt, if noisy, greetings of his old friends had the effect of
  soothing Andor&rsquo;s aching heart. The sight of his native village, the
  scent of the air, the dust of the road acted as a slight compensation for
  the heavy load of sorrow which otherwise would hopelessly have weighed him
  down.</p>
  <p>With a final wave of his hat he disappeared from the enraptured gaze of
  his friends into the cool quietude of the presbytery garden. He stood still
  for a moment behind a huge clump of tall sunflowers and gaudy dahlias to
  recover his breath and rearrange his coat, which had been mishandled quite
  a good deal by his friends in the excess of their joy.</p>
  <p>From the other side of the low gate came the buzz of animated talk, his
  own name oft-repeated, cries of surprise and of pleasure, when the news reached
  some late-comers, and through it all the soft, pathetic murmur of the gipsies&rsquo; fiddles;
  they had lapsed from the inspiriting strains of the R&aacute;k&oacute;czy
  March to one of the dreamy Magyar love-songs which suited their own languid
  Oriental temperament far better than the martial music.</p>
  <p>But here, in the small presbytery garden, the world seemed to have slipped
  back an hundred years or more. Perfect peace! the drowsing of flies and wasps,
  the call of thrushes, the crackling of tiny twigs in the branches of the
  old acacia tree in the corner! Only the flies and the birds and the flowers
  seemed to live, and the air was heavy with the pungent odour of the sunflowers.</p>
  <p>Andor drew a long breath. He seemed suddenly to wake from a long, long dream.
  It was just over five years ago that he had stood one morning just like this
  in this little garden; the late roses had not then ceased to bloom. It was
  the day before he had to leave Marosfalva in order to become a soldier, and
  he had come after Mass to say a private good-bye to the kind priest.</p>
  <p>Now it seemed as if those five years were just one long dream&mdash;the
  soldiering, the voyage across the sea, the two years in a strange, strange
  land, all culminating in that awful cataclysm which had for ever robbed him
  of happiness.</p>
  <p>It seemed as if it <i>could</i> not all be true, as if Elsa was even now
  waiting for him to go out for a walk under the acacia trees as she had done
  on that morning five years ago. Even now he pulled the bell as he had done
  then, and now&mdash;as then&mdash;Pater Bonif&aacute;cius himself came to
  the door.</p>
  <p>His old housekeeper had already brought the news to the presbytery of Andor&rsquo;s
  home-coming, and the old Pater was overjoyed at seeing the lad&mdash;now
  become so strong and so manly. He took Andor to his heart, chiefly because
  he would not have the lad see the tears which had so quickly come to his
  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true then, Pater,&rdquo; said Andor, when he had followed the
  old man into the little parlour all littered with papers and books. &ldquo;It
  is true, or you would not have cried when first you embraced me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is true, my son?&rdquo; asked the Pater.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Elsa is to marry Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my son, that is true,&rdquo; said the priest simply.</p>
  <p>And thus Andor knew that, at any rate, the hideous present was not a dream.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;That Is Fair, I Think.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>An hour later, Andor was in the street with the rest of the village folk,
  watching Elsa as she walked up toward the schoolroom in the company of her
  mother. Her fair hair shone like the gold beads round her neck, and her starched
  petticoats swung out from her hips as she walked.</p>
  <p>She held her head a little downcast; people thought this most becoming in
  a young bride; but Andor, who stood in the forefront of the spectators as
  she passed, saw that she held her head down because her cheeks were pale
  and her eyes swollen with tears.</p>
  <p>Irma n&eacute;ni walked beside her daughter with the proud air of a queen,
  and on ahead Barna M&oacute;ritz, the mayor&rsquo;s second son, Feh&eacute;r
  Jen&ouml;, whose father worked the water-mill on the Maros, and two other
  sturdy fellows were carrying the bride&rsquo;s paralysed father shoulder
  high in his chair.</p>
  <p>Just as the little procession halted for a moment before entering the white
  washed school-house, Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, the bridegroom and hero of the
  hour, appeared, coming from the opposite direction, and with Klara Goldstein,
  the Jewess, upon his arm.</p>
  <p>Klara&mdash;arrayed in fashionable town garments, with a huge hat covered
  in feathers, a tight modern skirt that forced her to walk with mincing steps,
  high-heeled shoes, open-work stockings and gloves reaching to the elbow&mdash;was
  indeed a curious apparition in amongst these peasant girls, with their bare
  heads and high red-leather boots and petticoats standing round them like
  balloons.</p>
  <p>Andor frowned heavily when he caught sight of her; he had seen that Elsa&rsquo;s
  pale cheeks had become almost livid in hue and that her parted lips trembled
  as if she were ready to cry.</p>
  <p>The looks that were cast by the village folk upon the Jewess were none too
  kindly, and there were audible mutterings of disapproval at Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s
  conduct; but neither looks nor mutterings disconcerted Klara Goldstein in
  the least. She knew well enough that envy of her fashionable attire bore
  a large share in the ill-will which was displayed against her, and the handsome
  Jewess, who so often had to bear the contempt and the sneers of these Magyar
  peasants whom she despised, was delighted that Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s
  admiration for her had induced him to give her an opportunity of queening
  it for once amongst them all.</p>
  <p>She felt that she shone in her splendour in comparison with the pale-faced
  bride in all her village finery. She carried a sunshade and a reticule, her
  dark hair was arranged in frisettes under her broad-brimmed hat; she knew
  that the men were casting admiring glances on her, and in any case, for the
  moment, she was the centre of universal observation.</p>
  <p>Whilst some of the young men were engaged in carrying old Kapus into the
  house, a proceeding which kept the festive throng waiting outside, she tripped
  up daintily to Elsa, and said in soft, cooing tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was kind of you, my dear Elsa, to include me among your personal
  friends on such an important occasion. As the young Count was saying to me
  only last night, &lsquo;You will give Irma n&eacute;ni and little Elsa vast
  pleasure by your presence at the child&rsquo;s maiden&rsquo;s farewell, and
  mind you wear that lovely hat which I admire so much.&rsquo; So affable,
  the young Count, is he not? He told me that nothing would do but when I get
  married he must come himself to every feast in connection with my wedding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But once she had delivered these several little pointed shafts, Klara Goldstein
  was far too clever to wait for a retort. Before Elsa, whose simple mind was
  not up to a stinging repartee, could think of something indifferent or not
  too ungracious to say, the handsome Jewess had already spied Andor&rsquo;s
  face among the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is the hero of the hour, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she said, turning
  to the bridegroom, who had stood by surly and defiant; &ldquo;these past
  five years have not changed him much, eh? . . . Your future wife&rsquo;s
  old sweetheart,&rdquo; she added, with a malicious little laugh; &ldquo;are
  you not pleased to see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as B&eacute;la somewhat clumsily, and with a pretence at cordiality
  which he was far from feeling, went up to Andor and held out his hand to
  him, Klara continued glibly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor old Andor! he is a trifle glum now. I never told him that his
  sweetheart was getting married to-morrow. Never mind, my little Andor,&rdquo; she
  added, turning her expressive dark eyes with a knowing look upon the young
  man; &ldquo;there is more fish in the Maros than has come out of it. And
  I thought that you would prefer to get the truth direct from our pretty Elsa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you did quite right, Klara,&rdquo; said Andor indifferently.</p>
  <p>But in the meanwhile B&eacute;la had contrived to come up quite close to
  Elsa, and to whisper hurriedly in her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bargain&rsquo;s a bargain, my dove!&mdash;you behave amiably to
  Klara Goldstein and I will keep a civil tongue in my head for your old sweetheart.
  . . . That is fair, I think, eh, Irma n&eacute;ni?&rdquo; he added, turning
  to the old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; retorted Kapus Irma dryly. &ldquo;Why
  you should be for ever teasing Elsa, I cannot think. You must know that all
  girls feel upset at these times, and as like as not you&rsquo;ll make her
  cry at her own feast. And that would be a fine disgrace for us all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, mother,&rdquo; said Elsa quietly; &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t feel the least like crying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid,&rdquo; exclaimed B&eacute;la, with ostentatious
  gaiety. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Irma n&eacute;ni trying to teach me something
  about girls. As if I didn&rsquo;t know about them all that there is to know.
  Eh, Andor, you agree with me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he added, turning to
  the other man. &ldquo;We men know more about women&rsquo;s moods and little
  tempers than their own mothers do. What? Now, Irma n&eacute;ni, take your
  daughter into the house. There is a clatter of dishes and bottles going on
  inside there which is very pleasant to the stomach. Miss Klara, will you
  honour me by accepting my arm? Friends, come in all, will you? All those,
  I mean, whom my wife that is to be has invited to her last girlhood&rsquo;s
  entertainment. Irma n&eacute;ni, do lead the way. Elsa looks quite pale for
  want of food&mdash;she had her breakfast very early, I suppose, and got tired
  dressing for this great occasion. Andor, you shall sit next to Elsa if you
  like. . . . You must have lots to tell her. Your adventures among the cannibals
  and the lions and tigers. . . . Eh? . . . And Irma n&eacute;ni shall sit
  next to you on the other side, and don&rsquo;t let her have more wine than
  is good for her. Whew! but it is hot already! Come along, friends. By thunder,
  Klara, but that is a fine hat you have got on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He talked on very volubly and at the top of his voice, making ostentatious
  efforts to appear jovial and amiable to everyone; but Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la
  was no fool: he knew quite well that his attitude toward his bride and toward
  Klara the Jewess was causing many adverse comments to go round among his
  friends. But he was in a mood not to care. He was determined that everyone
  should know and see that he was the master here to-day, just as he meant
  to be master in his house throughout the years to come. Like every self-enriched
  peasant, he attached an enormous importance to wealth, and was inclined to
  have a contempt for the less fortunate folk who had not risen out of their
  humble sphere as he had done.</p>
  <p>His wealth, he thought, had placed him above everyone else in Marosfalva,
  and above the unwritten laws of traditions and proprieties which are of more
  account in an Hungarian village than all the codes framed by the Parliament
  which sits in Budapesth. He was proud of his wealth, proud of his education,
  his book-learning and knowledge of the world, and reckoned that these gave
  him the right to be a law unto himself. His naturally domineering and masterful
  temperament completed his claim to be considered the head man of Marosfalva.</p>
  <p>The Hungarian peasants are ready enough to give deference where deference
  is exacted, but, having given it, their cordial friendship dies away. They
  acknowledged a social barrier more readily, perhaps, than any other peasantry
  in Europe, but having once acknowledged it, they will not admit that either
  party can stand on both sides of it at one and the same time.</p>
  <p>So now, though Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was flouting the local traditions and
  proprieties by his attentions to Klara Goldstein, no one thought of openly
  opposing him. Everyone was ready enough to accept his actions, as they would
  those of their social superiors&mdash;the gentlemen of Arad, the Pater, my
  lord the Count himself, but they were not ready to accept his cordiality
  nor to extend to him their simple-minded and open-hearted friendship.</p>
  <p>The presence of the Jewess did not please them&mdash;she was a stranger
  and an alien&mdash;she looked like a creature from another world with her
  tight skirts, high-heeled shoes and huge, feathered hat. No one felt this
  more keenly than Andor, whose heart had warmed out&mdash;despite its pain&mdash;at
  sight of all his friends, their national costumes, their music, their traditions&mdash;all
  of which had been out of his life for so long.</p>
  <p>He felt that Klara&rsquo;s presence on this occasion was in itself an outrage
  upon Elsa, even without B&eacute;la&rsquo;s conspicuously unworthy conduct.
  Elsa, with her tightly-plaited hair, her balloon skirts and bare neck and
  arms, looked ashamed beside this fashionable apparition all made up of billowy
  lace and clinging materials.</p>
  <p>Andor cursed beneath his breath, and ground his heel into the dust in the
  impotency of his rage. He tried to remember all that the Pater had said to
  him half an hour ago about forbearance and about God&rsquo;s will.</p>
  <p>Personally, Andor did not altogether believe that it was God&rsquo;s will
  that Elsa should be married to a man who would neither cherish her nor appreciate
  her as she deserved to be: and it was with a heart weighed down with foreboding
  as well as with sorrow that he followed the wedding party into the school-house.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;The Waters Of The Maros Flow Sluggishly.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>But even the bridegroom&rsquo;s unconventional and reprehensible conduct
  had not the power to damp for long the spirits of the guests.</p>
  <p>By the time the soup had been eaten and the glasses filled with wine, the
  noise in the schoolroom had already become deafening, and no person of moderate
  vocal calibre could have heard himself speak. The time had come for everyone
  to talk at the top of his or her voice, for no one to listen, and for laughter&mdash;irresponsible,
  immoderate laughter&mdash;to ring from end to end of the room.</p>
  <p>The gipsies were scraping their fiddles, blowing their clarionets and banging
  their czimbalom with all the vigour of which they were capable. They, at
  any rate, were determined to be heard above the din. The leader, with his
  violin under his chin, had already begun his round of the two huge tables,
  pausing for awhile behind every chair&mdash;just long enough to play into
  the ear of every single guest his or her favourite song.</p>
  <p>For thus custom demands it.</p>
  <p>There are hundreds and hundreds of Hungarian folk-songs, and to a stranger&rsquo;s
  ear no doubt these have a great similarity among themselves, but to a Hungarian
  there is a world of difference in each: for to him it is the words that have
  a meaning. The songs are, for the most part, love-songs, and all are written
  in that quaint, symbolic style, full of poetic imagery, which is peculiar
  to the Magyar language.</p>
  <p>When we remember that in the terrible revolution of &rsquo;48, when these
  same Hungarian peasant lads who composed the bulk of Kossuth&rsquo;s followers
  fought against the Austrian army, and subsequently against the combined armies
  of Russia and of Austria, when we remember that throughout that terrible
  campaign they were always accompanied by their gipsy bands, we begin to realize
  how great a part national music plays in the national spirit of Hungary.
  The sweet, sad folk-songs rang in the fighting lads&rsquo; ears when they
  fell in their hundreds before the superior arms and numbers of their powerful
  neighbours, they inspired them and urged them, they helped them to win while
  they could, and to yield only when overwhelming numbers finally crushed their
  powers of resistance. Gipsy musicians fell beside the young soldiers, playing
  to them until the last the songs that spoke to them of their village, their
  sweethearts and their home. And the sweet, sad strains rang in the ears of
  the lads when they closed their eyes in death.</p>
  <p>And now when Andor&mdash;face to face with the first great sorrow of his
  life&mdash;felt as if his heart must break under it, he loved to hear the
  gipsy musician softly caressing the strings of his violin as he played close
  to his ear the sweetest, saddest melody among all the sweet, sad melodies
  in the Magyar tongue. It begins thus:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;A Maros vize folyik csendesen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The waters of the Maros flow sluggishly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>and it speaks of a broken-hearted lover whose sweetheart belongs to another.
  Andor had never cared for it before. He used to think it too sad, but now
  he understood it: it was attuned to his mood, and the soft sound of the instrument
  helped him to keep his ever-growing wrath in check, even while he was watching
  Elsa&rsquo;s pale, tearful face.</p>
  <p>She had made pathetic efforts to remain cheerful and not to listen to Klara&rsquo;s
  strident voice and loud, continuous laughter. B&eacute;la had practically
  confined his attentions to the Jewess, and Elsa tried not to show how ashamed
  she was at being so openly neglected on this occasion. She should have been
  the queen of the feast, of course; the bridegroom&rsquo;s thoughts should
  have been only for her; everyone&rsquo;s eyes should have been turned on
  her. Instead of which she seemed of less consequence almost than anyone else
  here. If it had not been for Andor, who sat next to her and who saw to her
  having something to eat and drink&mdash;it was little enough, God knows!&mdash;she
  might have sat here like a wooden doll.</p>
  <p>Something of the respect which Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la demanded as his own
  right encompassed her, too, already: the cordiality of the past seemed to
  have vanished. She was already something of a lady: &ldquo;<i>ten&rsquo;s
  asszony</i>&rdquo; (honoured madam), she would be styled by and by. And this
  foreknowledge, which she was gradually imbibing while everybody round her
  made merry, caused her almost as much sadness as B&eacute;la&rsquo;s indifference
  towards her. It seemed as if all brightness was destined to go out of her
  life after to-day, and it was with tear-filled eyes that she looked up now
  and again from her plate and gazed round upon the festive scene before her.</p>
  <p>The whitewashed schoolroom, where on ordinary working days brown and grimy
  little faces were wont to pore laboriously over slates and books, presented
  now a very lively appearance.</p>
  <p>Two huge trestle tables ran down its length, and thirty guests were seated
  on benches each side of these. The girls in all their finery wanted a deal
  of sitting-room, with their starched petticoats standing out over their hips,
  and their bare arms and necks shone with the vigorous application of yellow
  soap: and the smooth hair, fair and dark, had an additional lustre after
  the stiff brushing which it had to endure. The matrons wore darker skirts
  and black silk handkerchiefs tied round their heads, ending in a bow under
  the chin: but everywhere ribbons fluttered and beads jingled, and the men
  had spurs to their high boots which gave a pleasing clinking when they clapped
  their heels together. Overhead, hung to the ceiling, were festoons of bright
  pink paper roses and still brighter green glazed calico leaves; the tables
  were spread with linen cloths, and literally threatened to break down under
  the weight of pewter dishes filled with delicacies of every sort and kind&mdash;home-killed
  meat and home-made sausages, home-made bread and home-grown wine. The Magyar
  peasant is an epicure. His rich soil and excellent climate give him the best
  of food, and though, when times are hard, he will live readily enough on
  maize bread and pumpkin, he knows how to enjoy a good spread when rich friends
  provide it for him.</p>
  <p>And Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la had done the feast in style. Nothing was stinted.
  You just had to sit down and eat your fill of roast veal or roast pork, of
  fattened capons from his farmyard or of fogas (A kind of pike peculiar to Hungarian
    rivers) from the river, or of the scores of dishes of all kinds of good things
  which stood temptingly about.</p>
  <p>No wonder that spirits were now running high. The gipsy band was quite splendid,
  and presently Barna M&oacute;ritz, the second son of the mayor&mdash;a smart
  young man who would go far&mdash;was on his feet proposing the health of
  the bride.</p>
  <p>Well! Of course! One mugful was not enough to do honour to such a toast,
  they had to be refilled and then filled up again: wine was so plentiful and
  so good&mdash;not heady, but just a delicious white wine which tasted of
  nothing but the sweet-scented grape. Soon the bridegroom rose to respond,
  whereupon Feh&eacute;r Jen&ouml;, whose father rented the mill from my lord
  the Count, loudly desired that everyone should drink the health of happy,
  lucky Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, and then, of course, the latter had to respond
  again.</p>
  <p>Elsa felt more and more every moment a stranger among them all. Fortunately
  the innate kindliness of these children of the soil prevented any chaffing
  remarks being made about the silence of the bride. It is always an understood
  thing that brides are shy and nervous, and though there had been known cases
  in Marosfalva where a bride had been very lively and talkative at her &ldquo;maiden&rsquo;s
  farewell&rdquo; it was, on the whole, considered more seemly to preserve
  a semi-tearful attitude, seeing that a girl on the eve of her marriage is
  saying good-bye to her parents and to her home.</p>
  <p>The bridegroom&rsquo;s disgraceful conduct was tacitly ignored: it could
  not be resented or even commented on without quarrelling with Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la,
  and that no one was prepared to do. You could not eat a man&rsquo;s salt
  and drink his wine and then knock him on the head, which it seemed more than
  one lad&mdash;who had fancied himself in love with beautiful Kapus Elsa&mdash;was
  sorely inclined to do.</p>
  <p>Kapus Benk&oacute;, in his invalid&rsquo;s chair, sat some distance away
  from his daughter, the other side of Klara Goldstein. Elsa could not even
  exchange glances with him or see whether he had everything he wanted. Thus
  she seemed cut off from everyone she cared for; only Andor was near her,
  and of Andor she must not even think. She tried not to meet his gaze, tried
  hard not to feel a thrill of pleasure every time that she became actively
  conscious of his presence beside her.</p>
  <p>And yet it was good to feel that he was there, she had a sense that she
  was being protected, that things could not go very wrong while he was near.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;I Am Here To See That You Be Kind To Her.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Pater Bonif&aacute;cius came in at about four o&rsquo;clock to remind all
  these children of their duty to God.</p>
  <p>To-day was the vigil of St. Michael and All Angels, there would be vespers
  at half-past four, and the bride and bridegroom should certainly find the
  time to go to church for half an hour and thank the good God for all His
  gifts.</p>
  <p>The company soon made ready to go after that. Everyone there intended to
  go to church, and in the meanwhile the gipsies would have the remnants of
  the feast, after which they would install themselves in the big barn and dancing
  could begin by about six.</p>
  <p>Bride and bridegroom stood side by side, close to the door, as the guests
  filed out both singly and in pairs, and as they did so they shook each one
  by the hand, wished them good health after the repast, and begged their company
  for the dancing presently and the wedding feast on the morrow. Once more
  the invalid father, hoisted up on the shoulders of the same sturdy lads,
  led the procession out of the schoolhouse, then followed all the guests,
  helter-skelter, young men and maids, old men and matrons.</p>
  <p>The wide petticoats got in the way, the men were over bold in squeezing
  the girls&rsquo; waists in the general scramble, there was a deal of laughing
  and plenty of shouting as hot, perspiring hands were held out one by one
  to Elsa and to B&eacute;la, and voices, hoarse with merriment, proffered
  the traditional &ldquo;<i>Eg&eacute;ss&eacute;gire!</i>&rdquo; (your very
  good health!), and then, like so many birds let out of a cage, streamed out
  of the narrow door into the sunlit street.</p>
  <p>Andor had acquitted himself of the same duty, and Elsa&rsquo;s cool little
  hand had rested for a few seconds longer than was necessary in his own brown
  one. She had murmured the necessary words of invitation for the ceremonies
  on the morrow, and he was still standing in the doorway when Klara Goldstein
  was about to take her leave.</p>
  <p>Klara had stayed very ostentatiously to the last, just as if she were the
  most intimate friend or an actual member of the family; she had stood beside
  B&eacute;la during the general exodus, her small, dark head, crowned with
  the gorgeous picture hat, held a little on one side, her two gloved hands
  resting upon the handle of her parasol, her foot in its dainty shoe impatiently
  tapping the ground.</p>
  <p>As the crowd passed by, scrambling in their excitement, starched petticoats
  crumpled, many a white shirt stained with wine, hot, perspiring and panting,
  a contemptuous smile lingered round her thin lips, and from time to time
  she made a remark to B&eacute;la&mdash;always in German, so that the village
  folk could not understand. But Andor, who had learned more than his native
  Hungarian during his wanderings abroad, heard these sneering remarks, and
  hated the girl for speaking them, and B&eacute;la for the loud laugh with
  which he greeted each sally.</p>
  <p>Now she held out her small, thin hand to Elsa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your good health, my dear Elsa!&rdquo; she said indifferently.</p>
  <p>After an obvious moment of hesitation, Elsa put her toil-worn, shapely little
  hand into the gloved one for an instant and quickly withdrew it again. There
  was a second or two of silence. Klara did not move: she was obviously waiting
  for the invitation which had been extended to everyone else.</p>
  <p>A little nervously she began toying with her parasol.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The glass is going up; you will have fine weather for your wedding
  to-morrow,&rdquo; she said more pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Elsa softly.</p>
  <p>Another awkward pause. Andor, who stood in the doorway watching the little
  scene, saw that B&eacute;la was digging his teeth into his underlip, and
  that his one eye had a sinister gleam in it as it wandered from one girl
  to the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May the devil! . . .&rdquo; began Klara roughly, whose temper quickly
  got the better of her airs and graces. &ldquo;What kind of flea has bitten
  your bride, B&eacute;la, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Flea?&rdquo; said B&eacute;la with an oath, which he did not even
  attempt to suppress. &ldquo;Flea? No kind of a flea, I hope. . . . Look
  here, my dove,&rdquo; he added, turning to Elsa suddenly, &ldquo;you seem
  to be forgetting your duties&mdash;have you gone to sleep these last five
  minutes?&mdash;or can&rsquo;t you see that Klara is waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can see that Klara is waiting,&rdquo; replied Elsa calmly, &ldquo;but
  I don&rsquo;t know what she can be waiting for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was as white as the linen of her shift, and little beads of sweat stood
  out at the roots of her hair. Andor, whose love for her made him clear-sighted
  and keen, saw the look of obstinacy which had crept round her mouth&mdash;the
  sudden obstinacy of the meek, which nothing can move. He alone could see
  what this sudden obstinacy meant to her, whose natural instincts were those
  of duty and of obedience. She suffered terribly at this moment, both mentally
  and physically; the moisture of her forehead showed that she suffered.</p>
  <p>But she had nerved herself up for this ordeal: the crushed worm was turning
  on the cruel foot that had trodden it for so long. She did not mean to give
  way, even though she had fully weighed in the balance all that she would
  have to pay in the future for this one moment of rebellion.</p>
  <p>Parents first and husbands afterwards are masterful tyrants in this part
  of the world; the woman&rsquo;s place is to obey; the Oriental conception
  of man&rsquo;s supremacy still reigns paramount, especially in the country.
  Elsa knew all this, and was ready for the chastisement&mdash;either moral,
  mental or even physical&mdash;which would surely overtake her, if not to-day,
  then certainly after to-morrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what Klara is waiting for?&rdquo; asked B&eacute;la,
  with an evil sneer; &ldquo;why, my dove, you must be dreaming. Klara won&rsquo;t
  come to our church, of course, but she would like to come to the ball presently,
  and to-morrow to our wedding feast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A second or perhaps less went by while Elsa passed her tongue over her parched
  lips; then she said slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since Klara does not go to our church, B&eacute;la, I don&rsquo;t
  think that she can possibly want to come to our wedding feast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la swore a loud and angry oath, and Andor, who was closely watching
  each player in this moving little drama, saw that Klara&rsquo;s olive skin
  had taken on a greenish hue, and that her gloved hands fastened almost convulsively
  over the handle of her parasol.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I tell you . . .&rdquo; began B&eacute;la, who was now livid
  with rage, and turned with a menacing gesture upon his fianc&eacute;e, &ldquo;I
  tell you that . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Already Andor had interposed; he, too, was pale and menacing, but he did
  not raise his voice nor did he swear, he only asked very quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will you tell your fianc&eacute;e, man? Come! What is it that
  you want to tell her on the eve of her wedding day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; retorted B&eacute;la.</p>
  <p>In this land where tempers run high, and blood courses hotly through the
  veins, a quarrel swiftly begun like this more often than not ends in tragedy.
  On Andor&rsquo;s face, in his menacing eyes, was writ the determination to
  kill if need be; in that of B&eacute;la there was the vicious snarl of an
  infuriated dog. Klara Goldstein was far too shrewd and prudent to allow her
  name to be mixed up in this kind of quarrel. Her reputation in the village
  was not an altogether unblemished one; by a scandal such as would result
  from a fight between these two men and for such a cause she might hopelessly
  jeopardize her chances in life, even with her own people.</p>
  <p>Her own common sense, too, of which she had a goodly share, told her at
  the same time that the game was not worth the candle: the satisfaction of
  being asked to the most important wedding in the village, and there queening
  it with her fashionable clothes and with the bridegroom&rsquo;s undivided
  attention over a lot of stupid village folk, would not really compensate
  her for the scandal that was evidently brewing in the minds of Andor and
  of Elsa.</p>
  <p>So she preferred for the nonce to play the part of outraged innocence, a
  part which she further emphasized by the display of easy-going kindliness.
  She placed one of her daintily-gloved hands on B&eacute;la&rsquo;s arm, she
  threw him a look of understanding and of indulgence, she cast a provoking
  glance on Andor and one of good-humoured contempt on Elsa, then she said
  lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, B&eacute;la! I can see that our little Elsa is a trifle
  nervy to-day; she does me more honour than I deserve by resenting your great
  kindness to me. But bless you, my good B&eacute;la! I don&rsquo;t mind. I
  am used to jealousies: the petty ones of my own sex are quite endurable;
  it is when you men are jealous that we poor women often have to suffer. Leopold
  Hirsch, who is courting me, you know, is so madly jealous at times. He scarce
  can bear anyone to look at me. As if I could help not being plain, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she turned with a smile to Elsa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, my dear,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;that
  you are treating B&eacute;la quite fairly. He won&rsquo;t let you suffer
  from his jealousies; why should you annoy him with yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another glance through her long, dark lashes on both the men, and Klara
  Goldstein turned to go. But before she could take a step toward the door,
  B&eacute;la&rsquo;s masterful hand was on her wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going, my good B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she replied airily, &ldquo;going.
  What else can I do? I am not wanted here now, or later at your feast; but
  there are plenty in this village and around it who will make me welcome,
  and their company will be more pleasing to me, I assure you, than that of
  your friends. We thought of having some tarok this evening. Leopold will
  be with us, and the young Count is coming. He loves a gamble, and is most
  amusing when he is in the mood. So I am going where I shall be most welcome,
  you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A game of cards&mdash;the source of much gambling in that part of Europe.</p>
  <p>She tried to disengage her wrist, but he was holding her with a tight, nervous
  grip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not going to do anything of the sort,&rdquo; he muttered
  hoarsely; &ldquo;she is daft, I tell you. Stay here, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; she retorted, with a laugh. &ldquo;Enough of your friends&rsquo; company,
  my good B&eacute;la, is as good as a feast. Look at Elsa&rsquo;s face! And
  Andor&rsquo;s! He is ready to eat me, and she to freeze the marrow in my
  bones. So farewell, my dear man; if you want any more of my company,&rdquo; she
  added pointedly, &ldquo;you know where to get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had succeeded in freeing her wrist, and the next moment was standing
  under the lintel of the door, the afternoon sun shining full upon her clinging
  gown, her waving feathers and the gew-gaws which hung round her neck. For
  a moment she stood still, blinking in the glare, her hands, which trembled
  a little from the emotion of the past little scene, fumbled with her parasol.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la turned like a snarling beast upon his fianc&eacute;e.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask her to stop,&rdquo; he cried savagely. &ldquo;Ask her to stop,
  I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep your temper, my good B&eacute;la,&rdquo; said Klara over her
  shoulder to him, with a laugh; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t trouble about me. I
  am used to tantrums at home. Leo is a terror when he has a jealous fit, but
  it&rsquo;s nothing to me, I assure you! His rage leaves me quite cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this sort of nonsense does not leave me cold,&rdquo; retorted
  B&eacute;la, who by now was in a passion of fury; &ldquo;it makes my blood
  boil, I tell you. What I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve said, and I&rsquo;m not
  going to let any woman set her will up against mine, least of all the woman
  who is going to be my wife. Whether you go or stay, Klara, is your affair,
  but Elsa will damn well have to ask you to stay, as I told her to do; she&rsquo;ll
  have to do as I tell her, or . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or what, B&eacute;la?&rdquo; interposed Andor quietly.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la threw him a dark and sullen look, like an infuriated bull that
  pauses just before it is ready to charge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it to you?&rdquo; he muttered savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only this, my friend,&rdquo; replied Andor, who seemed as calm as
  the other was heated with passion, &ldquo;only this: that I courted and loved
  Elsa when she was younger and happier than she is now, and I am not going
  to stand by and see her bullied and brow-beaten by anyone. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take care, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; laughed Klara maliciously; &ldquo;your
  future wife&rsquo;s old sweetheart might win her from you yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take care of what?&rdquo; shouted B&eacute;la in unbridled rage.
  He faced Andor, and his one sinister eye shot a glance of deadly hatred upon
  him. &ldquo;Let me tell you this, my friend, Lakatos Andor. I don&rsquo;t
  know where you have sprung from to-day, or why you have chosen to-day to
  do it . . . and it&rsquo;s nothing to me. But understand that I don&rsquo;t
  like your presence here, and that I did not invite you to come, and that
  therefore you have no business to be here, seeing that I pay for the feast.
  And understand too that I&rsquo;ll trouble my future wife&rsquo;s sweetheart
  to relieve her of his presence in future, or there&rsquo;ll be trouble. And
  you may take that from me, as my last word, my friend. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What an ass you are, B&eacute;la!&rdquo; came as a parting shot from
  Klara, who had succeeded in opening her parasol, and now stood out in the
  open, her face and shoulders in shadow, looking the picture of coolness and
  of good-temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor,&rdquo; she added, with a pleasing smile to the young man, &ldquo;you
  know your way to Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s. Father and I will be pleased
  to see you there at any time. The young Count will be there to-night, and
  we&rsquo;ll have some tarok. Farewell, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she continued,
  laughing merrily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, my good man, it&rsquo;s not worth
  losing your temper about trifles on the eve of your wedding-day. And bless
  your eyes! I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she swept a mock curtsy to Elsa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, my pretty one. Good luck to you in your new life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She nodded and was gone. Her rippling laugh, with its harsh, ironical ring
  was heard echoing down the village street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call her back!&rdquo; shouted B&eacute;la savagely, turning on his
  fianc&eacute;e.</p>
  <p>She looked him straight in that one eye which was so full of menace, and
  said with meek but firm obstinacy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call her back,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was almost choking with rage, and now he raised his clenched fist and
  brandished it in her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call her back, or I&rsquo;ll . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already Andor was upon him, had seized him by collar and wrist. He was
  as livid as the other man was crimson, but his eyes glowed with a fury at
  least as passionate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I tell you,&rdquo; he said, speaking almost in a whisper, very
  slowly and very calmly, but with such compelling power of determination that
  B&eacute;la, taken unawares, half-choked with the grip on his throat, and
  in agonized pain with the rough turn on his wrist, was forced to cower before
  him, &ldquo;I tell you that if you dare touch her . . . Look here, my friend,&rdquo; he
  continued, more loudly, &ldquo;just now you said that you didn&rsquo;t know
  where I&rsquo;d sprung from to-day, or why I chose to-day in which to do
  it. Well! Let me tell you then. God in Heaven sent me, do you see? He sent
  me to be here so as to see that no harm come to Elsa through marrying a brute
  like you. You have shown me the door, and I don&rsquo;t want to eat your
  salt again and to take your hospitality, for it would choke me, I know .
  . . but let me tell you this much, that if you bully Elsa . . . if you don&rsquo;t
  make her happy . . . if you are not kind to her . . . I&rsquo;ll make you
  regret it to your dying day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had gradually relaxed his hold on B&eacute;la&rsquo;s throat and wrist,
  and now the latter was able to free himself altogether, and to readjust his
  collar and the set of his coat. For a moment it almost seemed as if he felt
  ashamed and repentant. But his obstinate and domineering temper quickly got
  the better of this softened mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make me regret it, will you?&rdquo; he retorted sullenly. &ldquo;You
  think that you will be allowed to play the guardian angel here, eh? with
  all your fine talk of God in Heaven, which I am inclined to think even the
  Pater would call blasphemy. I know what&rsquo;s at the back of your mind,
  my friend, don&rsquo;t you make any mistake about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s at the back of my mind?&rdquo; queried Andor,
  with a puzzled frown. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said B&eacute;la, with a return to his former swagger, &ldquo;that
  you have been saying to yourself this past half-hour: &lsquo;Oho! but Elsa
  is not married yet! The vows are not yet spoken, and until they are I still
  have my chance.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what you have been saying to yourself,
  eh, Mr. Guardian Angel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You d&mdash;&mdash;d liar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! insulting me won&rsquo;t help you, my friend. And I am not going
  to let you provoke me into a fight, and kill me perhaps, for no doubt that
  is what you would like to do. I am not going to give Elsa up to you, you
  need not think it; and you can&rsquo;t take her from me, you can&rsquo;t
  make her break her solemn promise to me, without covering her with a disgrace
  from which she would never recover. You know what happened when Bak&oacute; Mariska
  broke off her marriage on the eve of her wedding-day, just because Lajos
  had got drunk once or twice? Though her mother whipped her for her obstinacy,
  and her father broke his stick across her shoulders, the whole countryside
  turned against her. They all had to leave the village, for no one would speak
  to Mariska. A scandal such as that the ignorant peasants round about here
  will never forgive. Mariska ultimately drowned herself in the Maros: when
  she no longer could stand the disgrace that pursued her everywhere. When
  you thought that to make a girl break off her engagement the day before her
  wedding was such an easy matter, you had not thought of all that, had you,
  my friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And when you thought of frightening me by all that nonsensical talk,&rdquo; retorted
  Andor quietly, &ldquo;you had not thought perhaps that there are other lands
  in the world besides Hungary, and that I am not quite such an ignorant peasant
  as those whom you choose to despise. But you have been wasting your breath
  and your temper. I am not here to try and persuade Elsa into doing what she
  would think wrong; but I am here to see that at least you be kind to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; ejaculated B&eacute;la, with a contemptuous snap of
  his fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you need not imagine that I wouldn&rsquo;t know how you treated
  her. I would know soon enough. I tell you,&rdquo; he continued, with slow
  and deliberate emphasis, &ldquo;that what you do to her I shall know. I
  shall know if you bully her, I shall know if you make her unhappy. I shall
  know&mdash;and God help you in that case!&mdash;if you are not kind to her.
  Just think in future when you speak a rough word to her that Lakatos Andor
  will hear you and make you pay for every syllable. Think when you browbeat
  her that Lakatos Andor can see you! For I <i>will</i> see you, I tell you,
  in spite of your turning me out of your house, in spite of your fences and
  your walls. So just you ask her pardon now for your roughness, kiss her little
  hand and take her to vespers. But take this from me, my friend, that if you
  ever dare raise your hand against your wife I&rsquo;ll pay you out for it,
  so help me God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had sworn the last oath with solemn earnestness. Now he turned to Elsa
  and took her cold little hand in his and kissed her trembling finger-tips,
  then, without another look on the man whom he hated with such an overwhelming
  and deadly hatred, he turned on his heel and fled precipitately from the
  room.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la stood sullen and silent for a moment after he had gone. Wrath
  was still heating his blood so that the veins in his forehead stood up like
  cords. But he was not only wrathful, he also felt humiliated and ashamed.
  He had been cowed and overmastered in the presence of Elsa. His swagger and
  domineering ways had availed him nothing. Andor had threatened him and he
  had not had the pluck or the presence of mind to stand up to that meddling,
  interfering peasant.</p>
  <p>Now it was too late to do anything; the thoughts of retaliation which would
  come to his mind later on had not yet had the time to mature. All that he
  knew was that he hated Andor and would get even with him some day; for Elsa
  he felt no hatred, only a great wrath that she should have witnessed his
  humiliation and that her obstinacy should have triumphed against his will.
  The same pride in her and the same loveless desire was still in him. He did
  not hate her, but he meant to make her suffer for what he had just gone through.
  To him matrimony meant the complete subjection of the woman to the will of
  her lord; for every rebellion, for every struggle against that subjection
  she must be punished in accordance with the gravity of her fault.</p>
  <p>Elsa had caused him to be humiliated, and it was his firm resolve to humiliate
  her before many hours had gone by. Already a plan was forming in his brain;
  the quietude of vespers would, he thought, help him to complete it.</p>
  <p>Outside, the lads and maids were loudly demanding the appearance of the
  bride and bridegroom: the vesper bell had long ago ceased its compelling
  call. Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la offered his silent fianc&eacute;e his arm. She
  took it without hesitation, and together they walked across the square to
  the church.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;I Must Punish Her.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The little village inn kept by Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein was not more squalid,
  not more dark and stuffy, than are the village inns of most countries in
  Europe. Klara did her best to keep the place bright and clean, which was
  no easy matter when the roads were muddy and men brought in most of the mud
  of those roads on their boots, and deposited it on the freshly-washed floors.</p>
  <p>The tap-room was low and narrow and dark. Round the once whitewashed walls
  there were rows of wooden benches with narrow trestle tables in front of
  them. Opposite the front door, on a larger table, were the bottles of wine
  and silvorium, the jars of tobacco and black cigars, which a beneficent government
  licensed Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein the Jew to sell to the peasantry.</p>
  <p>A highly alcoholic, very raw gin-like spirit distilled from a special kind
  of plum.</p>
  <p>The little room obtained its daylight mainly from the street-door when it
  was open, for the one tiny window&mdash;on the right as you entered&mdash;was
  not constructed to open, and its dulled glass masked more of daylight than
  it allowed to filtrate through.</p>
  <p>Opposite the window a narrow door led into a couple of living rooms, the
  first of which also had direct access to the street.</p>
  <p>The tap-room itself was always crowded and always busy, the benches round
  the walls were always occupied, and Klara and her father were never allowed
  to remain idle for long. She dispensed the wine and the silvorium, and made
  herself agreeable to the guests. Ign&aacute;cz saw to the tobacco and the
  cigars. Village women in Hungary never frequent the public inn: when they
  do, it is because they have sunk to the lowest depths of degradation: a woman
  in drink is practically an unknown sight in the land.</p>
  <p>Klara herself, though her ways with the men were as free and easy as those
  of her type and class usually are, would never have dreamed of drinking with
  any of them.</p>
  <p>This evening she was unusually busy. While the wedding feast was going on
  lower down in the village, a certain number of men who liked stronger fare
  than what is usually provided at a &ldquo;maiden&rsquo;s farewell&rdquo; dance,
  as well as those who had had no claim to be invited, strolled into the tap-room
  for a draught of silvorium, a gossip with the Jewess, or a game of tarok
  if any were going.</p>
  <p>Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein himself was fond of a game. Like most of his race,
  his habits were strictly sober. As he kept a cool head, he usually won; and
  his winnings at tarok made a substantial addition to the income which he
  made by selling spirits and tobacco. Leopold Hirsch, who kept the village
  grocery store, was also an inveterate player, and, like Goldstein, a very
  steady winner. But it was not the chance of a successful gamble which brought
  him so often to the tap-room. For years now he had dangled round Klara&rsquo;s
  fashionable skirts, and it seemed as if at last his constancy was to be rewarded.
  While she was younger&mdash;and was still of surpassing beauty&mdash;she
  had had wilder flights of ambition than those which would lead her to rule
  over a village grocery store: during those times she had allowed Leopold
  Hirsch to court her, without giving him more than very cursory encouragement.</p>
  <p>As the years went on, however, and her various admirers from Arad proved
  undesirous to go to the length of matrimony, she felt more kindly disposed
  toward Leo, who periodically offered her his heart and hand, and the joint
  ownership of the village grocery store. She had looked into her little piece
  of mirror rather more closely of late than she had done hitherto, and had
  discovered two or three ominous lines round her fine, almond-shaped eyes,
  and noted that her nose showed of late a more marked tendency to make close
  acquaintance with her chin.</p>
  <p>Then she began to ponder, and to give the future more serious consideration
  than she had ever done before. She ticked off on her long, pointed fingers
  the last bevy of her admirers on whom she might reasonably count: the son
  of the chemist over in Arad, the tenant of the Kender Road farm, the proprietor
  of the station cabs, and there were two or three others; but they were certainly
  falling away, and she had added no new ones to her list these past six months.</p>
  <p>Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s formally declared engagement to Kapus Elsa
  had been a very severe blow. She had really reckoned on B&eacute;la. He was
  educated and unconventional, and though he professed the usual anti-Semitic
  views peculiar to his kind, Klara did not believe that these were very genuine.
  At any rate, she had reckoned that her fine eyes and provocative ways would
  tilt successfully against the man&rsquo;s racial prejudices.</p>
  <p>Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was rich and certainly, up to a point, in love with
  her. Klara was congratulating herself on the way she was playing her matrimonial
  cards, when all her hopes were so suddenly dashed to the ground.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la was going to marry that silly, ignorant peasant girl, and she,
  Klara, would be left to marry Leopold after all.</p>
  <p>Her anger and humiliation had been very great, and she had battled very
  persistently and very ably to regain the prize which she had lost. She knew
  quite well that, but for the fact that she belonged to the alien and despised
  race, Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la would have been only too happy to marry her.
  His vanity alone had made him choose Kapus Elsa. He wanted the noted beauty
  for himself, because the noted beauty had been courted by so many people,
  and where so many people had failed he was proud to succeed.</p>
  <p>Nor would he have cared to have it said that he had married a Jewess. There
  is always a certain thought of disgrace attached to such a marriage, whether
  it has been contracted by peer or peasant, and Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s
  one dominating idea in life was to keep the respect and deference of his
  native village.</p>
  <p>But he had continued his attentions to Klara, and Klara had kept a wonderful
  hold over his imagination and over his will. She was the one woman who had
  ever had her will with him&mdash;only partially, of course, and not to the
  extent of forcing him into matrimony&mdash;but sufficiently to keep him also
  dangling round her skirts even though his whole allegiance should have belonged
  to Elsa.</p>
  <p>The banquet this afternoon had been a veritable triumph. Whatever she had
  suffered through B&eacute;la&rsquo;s final disloyalty to herself, she knew
  that Kapus Elsa must have suffered all through the banquet. The humiliation
  of seeing one&rsquo;s bridegroom openly flaunting his admiration for another
  woman must have been indeed very bitter to bear.</p>
  <p>Not for a moment did Klara Goldstein doubt that the subsequent scene was
  an act of vengeance against herself on Elsa&rsquo;s part. She judged other
  women by her own standard, discounted other women&rsquo;s emotions, thoughts,
  feelings, by her own. She thought it quite natural that Elsa should wish
  to be revenged, just as she was quite sure that B&eacute;la was already meditating
  some kind of retaliation for the shame which Andor had put upon him and for
  Elsa&rsquo;s obstinacy and share in the matter.</p>
  <p>She had not spoken to anyone of the little scene which had occurred between
  the four walls of the little schoolroom: on the contrary she had spoken loudly
  of both the bridegroom&rsquo;s and the bride&rsquo;s cordiality to her during
  the banquet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa wanted me to go to the dancing this evening,&rdquo; she said
  casually, &ldquo;but I thought you would all miss me. I didn&rsquo;t want
  this place to be dull just because half the village is enjoying itself somewhere
  else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It had been market day at Arad, and at about five o&rsquo;clock Klara and
  her father became very busy. Cattle-dealers and pig-merchants, travellers
  and pedlars, dropped in for a glass of silvorium and a chat with the good-looking
  Jewess. More than one bargain, discussed on the marketplace of Arad, was
  concluded in the stuffy tap-room of Marosfalva.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we be honoured by the young Count&rsquo;s presence later on?&rdquo; someone
  asked, with a significant nod to Klara.</p>
  <p>Everyone laughed in sympathy; the admiration of the noble young Count for
  Klara Goldstein was well-known. There was nothing in it, of course; even
  Klara, vain and ambitious as she was, knew that the bridge which divided
  the aristocrat from one of her kind and of her race was an impassable one.
  But she liked the young Count&rsquo;s attentions&mdash;she liked the presents
  he brought her from time to time, and relished the notoriety which this flirtation
  gave her.</p>
  <p>She also loved to tease poor Leopold Hirsch. Leo had been passionately in
  love with her for years; what he must have endured in moral and mental torture
  during that time through his jealousy and often groundless suspicions no
  one who did not know him intimately could ever have guessed. These tortures
  which Klara wantonly inflicted upon the wretched young man had been a constant
  source of amusement to her. Even now she was delighted because, as luck would
  have it, he entered the tap-room at the very moment when everyone was chaffing
  her about the young Count.</p>
  <p>Leopold Hirsch cast a quick, suspicious glance upon the girl, and his dull
  olive skin assumed an almost greenish hue. He was not of prepossessing appearance;
  this he knew himself, and the knowledge helped to keep his jealousy and his
  suspicion aflame.</p>
  <p>He was short and lean of stature and his head, with its large, bony features,
  seemed too big for his narrow shoulders to carry. His ginger-coloured hair
  was lank and scanty; he wore it&mdash;after the manner of those of his race
  in that part of the world&mdash;in corkscrew ringlets down each side of his
  narrow, cadaverous-looking face.</p>
  <p>His eyes were pale and shifty, but every now and then there shot into them
  a curious gleam of unbridled passion&mdash;love, hate or revenge; and then
  the whole face would light up and compel attention by the revelation of latent
  power.</p>
  <p>This had happened now when a fellow who sat in the corner by the window
  made some rough jest about the young Count. Leopold made his way to Klara&rsquo;s
  side; his thin lips were tightly pressed together, and he had buried his
  hands in the pockets of his ill-fitting trousers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that accursed aristocrat comes hanging round here much more, Klara,&rdquo; he
  muttered between set teeth, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill him one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a fool you are, Leopold!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why, yesterday
  it was Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la you objected to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I do still,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I heard of your conduct
  at the banquet to-day. It is the talk of the village. One by one these loutish
  peasants have come into my shop and told me the tale&mdash;curse them!&mdash;of
  how the bridegroom had eyes and ears only for you. You seem to forget, Klara,&rdquo; he
  added, while a thought of menace crept into his voice, &ldquo;that you are
  tokened to me now. So don&rsquo;t try and make a fool of me, or . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Lord bless you, my good man,&rdquo; she retorted, with a laugh, &ldquo;I
  won&rsquo;t try, I promise you. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to compete with the
  Almighty, who has done that for you already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Klara . . .&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! be quiet now, Leo,&rdquo; she said impatiently. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
  you see that my hands are as full as I can manage, without my having to bother
  about you and your jealous tempers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She elbowed him aside and went to the counter to serve a customer who had
  just arrived, and more than a quarter of an hour went by before Leopold had
  the chance of another word with her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You might have a kind word for me to-night, Klara,&rdquo; he said
  ruefully, as soon as a brief lull in business enabled him to approach the
  girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why specially to-night?&rdquo; she asked indifferently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your father must go by the night train to Kecskem&eacute;t,&rdquo; he
  said, with seeming irrelevance. &ldquo;There is that business about the plums.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The plums?&rdquo; she asked, with a frown of puzzlement, &ldquo;what
  plums?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fruit he bought near Kecskem&eacute;t. They start gathering at
  sunrise to-morrow. He must be there the first hour, else he&rsquo;d get shamefully
  robbed. He must travel by night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew nothing about it,&rdquo; rejoined Klara, with an indifferent
  shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;Father never tells me when he is going to
  be away from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; retorted Leopold, with a sneer, &ldquo;he knows better
  than to give all your gallants such a brilliant opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Leo!&rdquo; she reiterated with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give any of them an opportunity, either,&rdquo; resumed
  the young man, while a curious look of almost animal ferocity crept into
  his pale face. &ldquo;Whenever your father has to be away from home during
  the night, I take up my position outside this house and watch over you until
  daylight comes and people begin to come and go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very thoughtful of you, my good Leo,&rdquo; she rejoined dryly, &ldquo;but
  you need not give yourself the trouble. I am well able to look after myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If any man molested you,&rdquo; continued Leopold, speaking very
  calmly, &ldquo;I would kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who should molest me, you silly fool? And anyhow, I won&rsquo;t have
  you spying upon me like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not call it spying, Klara. I love to stand outside this
  house in the peace and darkness of the night, and to think of you quietly
  sleeping whilst I am keeping watch over you. You wouldn&rsquo;t call a watchdog
  a spy, would you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that to-night I shan&rsquo;t sleep a wink,&rdquo; she retorted
  crossly, &ldquo;once father has gone. I shall always be thinking of you
  out there in the dark, watching this house. It will make me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night . . .&rdquo; he began, and then abruptly checked himself.
  Once more that quick flash of passion shot through his pale, deep-set eyes.
  It seemed as if he meant to tell her something, which on second thoughts
  he decided to keep to himself. Her keen, dark eyes searched his face for
  a moment or two; she wondered what it was that lurked behind that high, smooth
  forehead of his and within the depths of that curiously perverted brain.</p>
  <p>Before she had time, however, to question him, Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la made
  noisy irruption into the room.</p>
  <p>He was greeted with a storm of cheers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, B&eacute;la!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not the bridegroom, surely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who would have thought of seeing you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While Leopold Hirsch muttered audibly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What devil&rsquo;s mischief has brought this fellow here to-day,
  I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la seemed in boisterous good-humour&mdash;with somewhat ostentatious
  hilarity he greeted all his friends, and then ordered some of Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein&rsquo;s best wine for everybody all round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo, B&eacute;la!&rdquo; came from every side, together with loud
  applause at this unexpected liberality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is nice of you not to forget old friends,&rdquo; Klara whispered
  in his ear, as soon as he succeeded in reaching her side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he ejaculated with a sneer, &ldquo;you have no idea,
  my good Klara, how I&rsquo;ve been boring myself these past two hours. Those
  loutish peasants have no idea of enjoyment save their eternal gipsy music
  and their interminable cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For a man of your education, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; said Klara, with
  an insinuating smile, &ldquo;it must be odiously dull. You would far rather
  have had a game of cards, wouldn&rsquo;t you now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would far rather have had you at that infernal dance, so as to
  have had somebody to talk to,&rdquo; he retorted savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said demurely, &ldquo;that would never have done.
  Elsa must have such a lot to say to you herself. It would not be seemly for
  me to stand in the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa, as you know, has that silly cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s on the brain.
  She has been dancing ever since six o&rsquo;clock and has only given me about
  ten minutes of her company. She seems to belong to-night to every young fool
  that can dance, rather than to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah well! When you are married you can stop all that, my good B&eacute;la.
  You can forbid your wife to dance the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, you know. I
  know many men who do it. Then Elsa will learn to appreciate the pleasure
  of your conversation. Though she is no longer very young, she is still very
  ignorant. You will have to educate her . . . bring her up to your own level
  of intelligence and of learning. In the meanwhile, do sit down and drink
  with those who, like yourself, have come here for an hour or two to break
  the monotony of perpetual czig&aacute;ny music and dancing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She busied herself with drawing the corks of a number of bottles, which
  she then transferred from the end of the room where she stood to the tables
  at which sat her customers; she also brought out some fresh glasses. B&eacute;la
  watched her for a moment or two in silence, unconscious of the fact that
  he, too, was being watched by a pair of pale eyes in which lurked a gleam
  of jealousy and of hate. Suddenly, as Klara brushed past him carrying bottles
  and glasses, he took hold of her by the elbow and drew her close to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These louts won&rsquo;t stay late to-night, will they?&rdquo; he
  whispered in her ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not late,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;they will go on to the barn
  in time for the supper, you may be sure of that. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will have the supper served at ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he continued
  to whisper, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll not sit down to it. Not without you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she retorted. But even
  as he spoke, a little gleam of satisfaction, of gratified vanity, of anticipatory
  revenge, shot through her velvety dark eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I warned Elsa,&rdquo; he continued sullenly; &ldquo;I told her that
  if you were not at the feast, I should not be there either. She has disobeyed
  me. I must punish her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; she rejoined, with an acid smile. &ldquo;It is only in
  order to punish Elsa that you want to sup with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid, Klara,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  come at ten o&rsquo;clock. Will you have some supper ready for me then? I
  have two or three bottles of French champagne over at my house&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
  bring them along. Will you be ready for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be silent, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she broke in hurriedly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
  you see that that fool Leo is watching us all the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse, him! What have I got to do with him?&rdquo; muttered B&eacute;la
  savagely. &ldquo;You will be ready for me, Klara?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said decisively. &ldquo;Better make your peace with
  Elsa. I&rsquo;ll have none of her leavings. I&rsquo;ve had all I wanted out
  of you to-day&mdash;the banquet first and now your coming here. . . . It&rsquo;ll
  be all over the village presently&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all I care about.
  Have a drink now,&rdquo; she added good-humouredly, &ldquo;and then go and
  make your peace with Elsa . . . if you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned abruptly away from him, leaving him to murmur curses under his
  breath, and went on attending to her customers; nor did he get for the moment
  another opportunity of speaking with her, for Leopold Hirsch hovered round
  her for some considerable time after that, and presently, with much noise
  and pomp and circumstance, no less a personage than the noble young Count
  himself graced the premises of Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein the Jew with his august
  presence.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;Now Go And Fetch The Key.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>He belonged to the ancient family of R&aacute;kosy, who had owned property
  on both banks of the Maros for the past eight centuries, and Feri R&aacute;kosy,
  the twentieth-century representative of his medi&aelig;val forbears, was
  a good-looking young fellow of the type so often met with among the upper
  classes in Hungary: quite something English in appearance&mdash;well set-up,
  well-dressed, well-groomed from the top of his smooth brown hair to the tips
  of his immaculately-shod feet&mdash;in the eyes an expression of habitual
  boredom, further accentuated by the slight, affected stoop of the shoulders
  and a few premature lines round the nose and mouth; and about his whole personality
  that air of high-breeding and of good, pure blood which is one of the chief
  characteristics of the true Hungarian aristocracy.</p>
  <p>He did little more than acknowledge the respectful salutations which greeted
  him from every corner of the little room as he entered, but he nodded to
  Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la and smiled all over his good-looking face at Klara,
  who, in her turn, welcomed him with a profusion of smiles which brought a
  volley of muttered curses to Leopold Hirsch&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>While he held her one hand rather longer than was necessary she, with the
  other, took his hat from him, and then, laughing coquettishly, she pointed
  to a parcel which was causing the pocket of his well-cut Norfolk jacket to
  bulge immoderately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that something for me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; he replied lightly; &ldquo;I bought it at
  the fair in Arad for you to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How thoughtful of you!&rdquo; she said, with a little sigh of pleasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thoughtful?&rdquo; he retorted, laughing pleasantly. &ldquo;My good
  Klara, if I hadn&rsquo;t thought of you I would have died of boredom this
  afternoon. Here, give me a glass of your father&rsquo;s best wine and I&rsquo;ll
  tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat down with easy familiarity on the corner of the table which served
  as a counter. Klara, after this, had eyes and ears only for him. How could
  it be otherwise, seeing that it was not often a noble lord graced a village
  tap-room with his presence. Conversations round the room were now carried
  on in whispers; tarok cards were produced and here and there a game was in
  progress. Those who had drunk overmuch made themselves as inconspicuous as
  they could, drawing themselves closely against the wall, or frankly reclining
  across the table with arms outstretched and heads buried between them out
  of sight.</p>
  <p>An atmosphere of subdued animation and decorum reigned in the place; not
  a few men, oppressed by their sense of respect for my lord, had effected
  a quiet exit through the door, preferring the jovial atmosphere of the barn,
  from whence came, during certain hushed moments, the sounds of music and
  of laughter.</p>
  <p>The young man&mdash;whose presence caused all this revulsion in the usually
  noisy atmosphere of the tap-room&mdash;took no heed whatever of anything
  that went on around him: he seemed unconscious alike of the deference of
  the peasants as of the dark, menacing scowl with which Leopold Hirsch regarded
  him. He certainly did not bestow a single glance on Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la
  who, at my lord&rsquo;s appearance, had retreated into the very darkest corner
  of the room. B&eacute;la did not care to encounter the young Count&rsquo;s
  sneering remarks just now&mdash;and these would of a certainty have been
  levelled against the bridegroom who was sitting in a tap-room when he should
  have been in attendance on his bride. But indeed my lord never saw him.</p>
  <p>To this young scion of a noble race, which had owned land and serfs for
  centuries past, these peasants here were of no more account than his oxen
  or his sheep&mdash;nor was the owner of a village shop of any more consequence
  in my lord&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>He came here because there was a good-looking Jewess in the tap-room whose
  conversation amused him, and whose dark, velvety eyes, fringed with long
  lashes, and mouth with full, red lips, stirred his jaded senses in a more
  pleasant and more decided way than did the eyes and lips of the demure, well-bred
  young Countesses and Baronesses who formed his usual social circle.</p>
  <p>Whether his flirtation with Klara, the Jewess, annoyed the girl&rsquo;s
  Jew lover or not, did not matter to him one jot; on the contrary the jealousy
  of that dirty lout Hirsch enhanced his amusement to a considerable extent.</p>
  <p>Therefore he did not take the trouble to lower his voice now when he talked
  to Klara, and it was quite openly that he put his arm round her waist while
  he held his glass to her lips&mdash;&ldquo;To sweeten your father&rsquo;s
  vinegar!&rdquo; he said with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know, my pretty Klara,&rdquo; he said gaily, &ldquo;that I was
  half afraid I shouldn&rsquo;t see you to-day at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; she asked coquettishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, by gad! My father was so soft-hearted to allow Er&ouml;s a day
  off for his wedding or something, and so, if you please, I had to go to Arad
  with him, as he had to see about a sale of clover. I thought we should never
  get back. The roads were abominable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hardly expected your lordship,&rdquo; she said demurely.</p>
  <p>To punish her for that little lie, he tweaked her small ear till it became
  a bright crimson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is to punish you for telling such a lie,&rdquo; he said gaily. &ldquo;You
  know that I meant to come and say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your lordship goes to-morrow?&rdquo; she asked with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To shoot bears, my pretty Klara,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  want to go. I would rather stay another week here for you to amuse me, you
  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am proud . . .&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So much do you amuse me that I have brought you a present, just to
  show you that I thought of you to-day and because I want you not to forget
  me during the three months that I shall be gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew the parcel out of his pocket and, turning his back to the rest of
  the room, he cut the string and undid the paper that wrapped it. The contents
  of the parcel proved to be a morocco case, which flew open at a touch and
  displayed a gold curb chain bracelet&mdash;the dream of Klara Goldstein&rsquo;s
  desires.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; she said, with a gasp of delight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For your pretty arm, yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Shall I put it
  on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She cast a swift, apprehensive glance round the room over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, not now,&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father mightn&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;d have to ask him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n your father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that fool, Leopold, is so insanely jealous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n him too,&rdquo; said the young man quietly.</p>
  <p>Whereupon he took the morocco case out of Klara&rsquo;s hand, shut it with
  a snap and put it back into his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; cried Klara in a fright.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you see, pretty one, I am putting the bracelet away for future
  use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But . . .&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t put the bracelet on your arm myself,&rdquo; he said
  decisively, &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t have it at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is my last word. Let us talk of something else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no! We won&rsquo;t talk of something else. You said the bracelet
  was for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She cast a languishing look on him through her long upper lashes; she bared
  her wrist and held it out to him. Leopold and his jealousy might go hang
  for aught she cared, for she meant to have the bracelet.</p>
  <p>The young man, with a fatuous little laugh, brought out the case once more.
  With his own hands he now fastened the bracelet round Klara Goldstein&rsquo;s
  wrist. Then&mdash;as a matter of course&mdash;he kissed her round, brown
  arm just above the bracelet, and also the red lips through which the words
  of thanks came quickly tumbling.</p>
  <p>Klara did not dare to look across the room. She felt, though she did not
  see, Leopold&rsquo;s pale eyes watching this little scene with a glow in
  them of ferocious hate and of almost animal rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay now, Klara,&rdquo; said the young Count, dropping
  his voice suddenly to a whisper; &ldquo;too many of these louts about. When
  will you be free?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not to-day,&rdquo; she whispered in reply. &ldquo;After the fair
  there are sure to be late-comers. And you know Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la has
  a ball on at the barn and supper afterwards. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo; he broke in, in an eager whisper. &ldquo;While
  they are all at supper, I&rsquo;ll come in for a drink and a chat. . . .
  Ten o&rsquo;clock, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; she protested feebly. &ldquo;My father wouldn&rsquo;t
  like it, he . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n your father, my dear, as I remarked before. And,
  as a matter of fact, your father is not going to be in the way at all. He
  goes to Kecskem&eacute;t by the night train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father told me quite casually that Goldstein was seeing to some
  business for him at Kecskem&eacute;t to-morrow. So it was not very difficult
  to guess that if your father was to be in Kecskem&eacute;t to-morrow in time
  to transact business, he would have to travel up by the nine o&rsquo;clock
  train this evening in order to get there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as she made no reply, and a blush of pleasure gradually suffused her
  dark skin, lending it additional charm and giving to her eyes added brilliancy,
  he continued, more peremptorily this time:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock, then&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come back. Get rid of
  as many of these louts by then as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was only too ready to yield. Not only was she hugely flattered by my
  lord&rsquo;s attentions, but she found him excessively attractive. He could
  make himself very agreeable to a woman if he chose, and evidently he chose
  to do so now. Moreover Klara had found by previous experience that to yield
  to the young man&rsquo;s varied and varying caprices was always remunerative,
  and there was that gold watch which he had once vaguely promised her, and
  which she knew she could get out of him if she had the time and opportunity,
  as she certainly would have to-night if he came.</p>
  <p>Count Feri, seeing that she had all but yielded, was preparing to go. Her
  hand was still in his, and he was pressing her slender fingers in token of
  a pledge for this evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he whispered again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she protested once more, but this time he must have
  known that she only did it for form&rsquo;s sake and really meant to let
  him have his way. &ldquo;The neighbours would see you enter, and there might
  be a whole lot of people in the tap-room at that hour: one never knows. They
  would know by then that my father had gone away and they would talk such
  scandal about me. My reputation . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No doubt he felt inclined to ejaculate in his usual manner: &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n
  your reputation!&rdquo; but he thought better of it, and merely said casually:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I need not come in by the front door, need I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The back door is always locked,&rdquo; she remarked ingenuously. &ldquo;My
  father invariably locks it himself the last thing at night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But since he is going to Kecskem&eacute;t . . .&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he has to be away from home for the night he locks the door
  from the inside and takes the key away with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely there is a duplicate key somewhere? . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know, who should?&rdquo; he remarked, with affected
  indifference. &ldquo;Well! I shall have to make myself heard at the back
  door&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you hear me if I knocked?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if I were in the tap-room and a lot of customers to attend to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, I should hammer away until you did hear me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For that old gossip R&eacute;zi to hear you,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Her
  cottage is not fifty paces away from our back door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it will have to be the front door, after all,&rdquo; he rejoined
  philosophically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&mdash;the neighbours&mdash;and perhaps the tap-room full
  of people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But d&mdash;&mdash;n it, Klara,&rdquo; he exclaimed impatiently, &ldquo;I
  have made up my mind to come and spend my last evening with you&mdash;and
  when I have made up my mind to a thing, I am not likely to change it because
  of a lot of gossiping peasants, because of old R&eacute;zi, or the whole
  lot of them. So if you don&rsquo;t want me to come in by the front door,
  which is open, or to knock at the back door, which is locked, how am I going
  to get in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;ll have to find out, my pretty one,&rdquo; he
  said decisively, &ldquo;for it has got to be done somehow, or that gold
  watch we spoke of the other day will have to go to somebody else. And you
  know when I say a thing I mean it. Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a duplicate key,&rdquo; she whispered shyly, &ldquo;. .
  . to the back door, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought there was,&rdquo; he remarked dryly. &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the next room. . . . It hangs on a nail by father&rsquo;s bedside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go and get it, then,&rdquo; he said more impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Leopold is looking straight at
  you and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his aristocratic shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not afraid of that monkey?&rdquo; he said with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, no! not exactly afraid. But he is so insanely jealous; one
  never knows what kind of mischief he&rsquo;ll get into. He told me just now
  that whenever father is away from home he takes his stand outside this house
  from nightfall till morning&mdash;watching!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A modern Argus&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A modern lunatic!&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; resumed the young man lightly, &ldquo;lunatic or not,
  he won&rsquo;t be able to keep an eye on you to-night, even though your father
  will be away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hirsch is off to Fiume in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Fiume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You know he has a brother coming home from America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His ship is due in at Fiume the day after to-morrow. Leopold must
  start by the same train as your father to-night, in order to catch the express
  for Fiume at Budapesth to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he tell you all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have known all along that he meant to meet his brother at Fiume,
  and yesterday he said something about it again. So you see, my pretty one,
  that we can have a comfortable little supper this evening without fear of
  interruption. We&rsquo;ll have it at ten o&rsquo;clock, when the supper-party
  is going on at the barn, eh? We shan&rsquo;t be interrupted then. So give
  me that duplicate key, will you, and I can slip in quietly through the back
  door without raising a bit of gossip or scandal. Hurry up now! I shall have
  to be going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t now,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Leopold hasn&rsquo;t
  taken his eyes off me all this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! if that is all that is troubling you, my dear,&rdquo; said the
  young man coolly, &ldquo;I can easily settle our friend Leopold. Hirsch!&rdquo; he
  called loudly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord?&rdquo; queried the other, with the quick obsequiousness
  habitual to the down-trodden race.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My horse is kicking up such a row outside. I wish you&rsquo;d just
  go and see if the boy is looking after him properly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of course it was impossible to do anything but obey. My lord had commanded;
  in the ordinary way the poor Jew shopkeeper would have felt honoured to have
  been selected for individual recognition. Nor did he do more now than throw
  one of those swift looks of his&mdash;so full of hatred and of menace&mdash;upon
  Klara and the young man; but the latter, having given his orders, no longer
  condescended to take notice of the Jew and had once more engaged the girl
  in animated conversation.</p>
  <p>Had Klara thought of looking up when Leopold finally obeyed my lord&rsquo;s
  commands and went to look after the horse, she could not have failed to realize
  the danger which lurked in the young man&rsquo;s pale eyes then. His face,
  always pale and olive-tinted, was now the colour of ashes, grey and livid
  and blotched with purple, his lips looked white and quivering, and his eyebrows&mdash;of
  a reddish tinge&mdash;met above his nose in a deep, dark scowl.</p>
  <p>But my lord had thrown out a casual hint about a gold watch, and Klara had
  no further thought for her jealous admirer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now go and fetch the key,&rdquo; said Count Feri, as soon as the
  door had closed on Leopold.</p>
  <p>The hint of the gold watch had stirred Klara&rsquo;s pulses. A <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with
  my lord was, moreover, greatly to her liking. He could be very amusing when
  he chose, and was always generous; and Klara&rsquo;s life was often dull
  and colourless. A pleasant evening spent in his company would compensate
  her in a measure for her disappointment at not being asked to Elsa&rsquo;s
  ball, and there was the gold watch to look forward to, above all.</p>
  <p>Taking an opportunity when her father was absorbed in his game of tarok,
  she went into the next room and presently returned with a key in her hand,
  which she surreptitiously gave to my lord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man gaily. &ldquo;Klara, you
  are a gem, and after supper you shall just ask me for anything you have a
  fancy for, and I&rsquo;ll give it to you. Now I&rsquo;d better go. Good-bye,
  little one. Ten o&rsquo;clock sharp, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she repeated, under her breath.</p>
  <p>He strode to the door, outside which he found Leopold waiting for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The horse was quite quiet, my lord,&rdquo; said the Jew sullenly; &ldquo;the
  boy had never left it for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s all right, Hirsch,&rdquo; rejoined my lord indifferently. &ldquo;I
  only wanted to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of course he never thought of saying a word of thanks or of excuse to the
  other man. What would you? A Jew! Bah! not even worth a nod of the head.</p>
  <p>Count Feri R&aacute;kosy had quickly mounted his pretty, half-bred Arab
  mare&mdash;a click of the tongue and she was off with him, kicking up a cloud
  of dust in her wake.</p>
  <p>But Leopold Hirsch had remained for a moment standing on the doorstep of
  Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s house. He watched horse and rider through
  that cloud of dust, and along the straight and broad highway, until both
  had become a mere speck upon the low-lying horizon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May you break your accursed neck!&rdquo; he muttered fervently.</p>
  <p>Then he went back to the tap-room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;You Happen To Be Of My Race And Of My Blood.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>He strode at once to Klara, who greeted him with an ironical little smile
  and a coquettish look out of her dark eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You never told me that you were going away to-night, my dear Leopold,&rdquo; she
  said suavely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who told you that I was?&rdquo; he retorted savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems to be pretty well known about the place. You seemed to have
  been talking about it pretty freely that you were going to Fiume to meet
  your brother when the ship he is on comes in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I meant to tell you just now, only his lordship&rsquo;s arrival interrupted
  me,&rdquo; he said more quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And since then you have been busy making a fool of yourself before
  my lord, eh?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And compromising me into the bargain, what? But let me tell you this,
  my good Leopold, before we go any further, that I am not married to you yet,
  and that I don&rsquo;t like your airs of proprietorship, <i>sabe</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He could not say anything more just then, for customers were departing,
  and she had to attend to them; he did not try to approach her while she was
  thus engaged, but presently, when her back was turned, he contrived to work
  his way across to the door which gave on the inner room, and to push it slightly
  open with his hand, until he could peep through the aperture and take a quick
  survey of the room beyond.</p>
  <p>Klara had not seen this man&oelig;uvre of his, although she had cast more
  than one rapid and furtive glance upon him while she attended to her customers.
  She was thankful that he was going away for a few days; in his present mood
  he was positively dangerous.</p>
  <p>She had lighted the oil lamp which hung from the centre of the low, raftered
  ceiling, the hour was getting late, customers were all leaving now one by
  one.</p>
  <p>Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was one of the last to go.</p>
  <p>He had drunk rather more silvorium than was good for him. He knew quite
  well that by absenting himself from the pre-nuptial festivals he had behaved
  in a disgraceful and unjustifiable manner which would surely be resented
  throughout the village, and though he was quite sure that he did not care
  one brass fill&eacute;r what all those ignorant peasants thought of him,
  yet he felt it incumbent upon him to brace up his courage now, before meeting
  the hostile fusillade of eyes which would be sure to greet him on his return
  to the barn.</p>
  <p>He meant to put in a short appearance there, and then to finish his evening
  here in Klara&rsquo;s company. He felt that his dignity demanded that he
  should absent himself at any rate from the supper, seeing that Elsa had so
  grossly defied him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;ll be back, Klara,&rdquo; he whispered,
  in the girl&rsquo;s ear, as he was about to take his departure along with
  some of his friends, who also intended to go on to the dance in the barn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she retorted decisively, &ldquo;I
  have no use for you, my good B&eacute;la. You are almost a married man now,
  remember!&rdquo; she added with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring those bottles of champagne,&rdquo; he urged; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  be hard on me, Klara. I&rsquo;ll give you a good time to-night, and a nice
  present into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And ruin my reputation for ever, eh? By walking into the tap-room
  when it&rsquo;s full of people and carrying two bottles of champagne under
  your arm&mdash;or staying on ostentatiously after everyone has gone and for
  everyone to gossip. No, thank you; I&rsquo;ve already told you that I am
  not going to lend myself to your little games of vengeance. It isn&rsquo;t
  me you want, it&rsquo;s petty revenge upon Elsa. To that I say no, thank
  you, my good man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Klara!&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, and unceremoniously turned her back on him.</p>
  <p>He went off, sullen and morose, and not a little chaffed for his moroseness
  by his friends.</p>
  <p>The tap-room was almost deserted for the moment. In one or two corners only
  a few stragglers lingered; they were sprawling across the tables with arms
  outstretched. Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s silvorium had proved too potent
  and too plentiful. They lay there in a drunken sleep&mdash;logs that were
  of no account. Presently they would have to be thrown out, but there was
  no hurry for that&mdash;they were not in the way.</p>
  <p>Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein had gone into the next room. Klara was busy tidying
  up the place; Leopold approached her with well-feigned contrition and humility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Klara,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I seemed to have had the
  knack to-night of constantly annoying you. So I&rsquo;d best begone now,
  perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I bear no malice, Leo,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come back at about nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he
  continued. &ldquo;It is nearly eight now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She, thinking that he had his own journey in mind, remarked casually:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best be here well before nine. The train leaves at nine-twenty,
  and father walks very slowly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be late,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Best give me the key
  of the back door. I&rsquo;ll let myself in that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No occasion to do that,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;The front door
  will be open. You can come in that way like everybody else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a fancy,&rdquo; he said quietly; &ldquo;there might
  be a lot of people about just then. I don&rsquo;t want to come through here.
  I thought I&rsquo;d just slip in the back way as I often do. So give me the
  key, Klara, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I give you the key of the back door?&rdquo; she said, equally
  quietly; &ldquo;you know father always carries it in his coat pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there is a second key,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;which hangs
  on a nail by your father&rsquo;s bedside in the next room. Give me that one,
  Klara.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I never heard such nonsense!
  As if I could allow you to use the private door of this house just as it
  suits your fancy. If you want to come in to-night and say good-bye, you must
  come in by the front door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a whim of mine, Klara,&rdquo; urged Leopold, now
  still speaking quietly&mdash;almost under his breath&mdash;but there was
  an ominous tremor in his voice and sudden sharp gleams in his eyes which
  the girl had already noted and which caused the blood to rush back to her
  heart, leaving her cheeks pale and her lips trembling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she contrived to say, with an indifferent shrug
  of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just a whim,&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll take the
  key, by your leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned to the door of the inner room and pushed it open, just as he had
  done awhile ago, and now&mdash;as then&mdash;he cast a rapid glance round
  the room.</p>
  <p>Klara, through half-closed lids, watched his every movement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed, turning back to her, and with a look of
  well-feigned surprise, &ldquo;the key is not in its place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she retorted curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have put it away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When? It was hanging on its usual nail when I first came here this
  afternoon. I remember the door being open, and my glancing into the room
  casually. I am sure it was there then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may have been: but I put it away after that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should you have done that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and, anyhow, it&rsquo;s no business of yours,
  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me that back-door key, Klara,&rdquo; insisted the young man,
  in a tone of savage command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she replied, slowly and decisively.</p>
  <p>There was silence in the little, low raftered room after that, a silence
  only broken by the buzzing of flies against the white globe of the lamp,
  and by the snores of the sleepers who sprawled across the tables.</p>
  <p>Leopold Hirsch had drawn in his breath with a low, hissing sound; his face,
  by the yellow light of the lamp, looked ghastly in colour, and his hands
  were twitching convulsively as the trembling fingers clenched and opened
  with a monotonous, jerky movement of attempted self-control.</p>
  <p>Klara had not failed to notice these symptoms of an agony of mind which
  the young man was so vainly trying to hide from her. For the moment she almost
  felt sorry for him&mdash;sorry and slightly remorseful.</p>
  <p>After all, Leo&rsquo;s frame of mind, the agony which he endured, came from
  the strength of his love for her. Neither Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, nor the
  young Count, nor the many admirers who had hung round her in the past until
  such time as their fancy found more permanent anchorage elsewhere, would
  have suffered tortures of soul and of heart because she had indulged in a
  mild flirtation with a rival. Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la would have stormed and
  cursed, the young Count would have laid his riding-whip across the shoulders
  of his successful rival and there would have been an end of the matter. Leopold
  Hirsch would go down to hell and endure the torments of the damned, then
  return to heaven at a smile from her, and go back to hell again and glory
  in his misery.</p>
  <p>But just now she was frightened of him; he looked almost like a living corpse;
  the skin on his face was drawn so tightly over the bones that it gave him
  the appearance of a skull with hollow eyes and wide, grinning mouth.</p>
  <p>Outside an owl hooted dismally. Klara gave a slight shiver of fear and looked
  furtively round her to see if any of the drunkards were awake. Then she recollected
  that her father was in the next room, and presently, from afar, came shouts
  of laughter and the sound of music.</p>
  <p>She woke as from a nightmare, gave her fine shoulders a little shake, and
  looked boldly into her jealous lover&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the Lord, Leo!&rdquo; she said, with a little forced laugh, &ldquo;you
  have given me the creeps, looking as you do. How dare you frighten me like
  that? With your clenched hands, too, as if you wanted to murder me. There,
  now, don&rsquo;t be such a silly fool. You have got a long journey before
  you; it&rsquo;s no use making yourself sick with jealousy just before you
  go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not going on a journey,&rdquo; he said, in a toneless, even
  voice, which seemed to come from a grave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not going?&rdquo; she said, with a frown of puzzlement. &ldquo;You
  were going to Fiume to meet your brother, don&rsquo;t you remember? The ship
  he is on is due in the day after to-morrow. If you don&rsquo;t start to-night
  you won&rsquo;t be able to catch the express at Budapesth to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; he said, in the same dull, monotonous tone; &ldquo;I
  am not going, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have changed my mind. Your father is going away. I must watch over
  you to see that no one molests you. Thieves might want to break in . . .
  one never knows . . . anyhow, my brother can look after himself . . . I stay
  to look after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two she stood quite still, her senses strained to grasp
  the meaning, the purport of the present situation&mdash;this madman on the
  watch outside&mdash;the young Count, key in hand, swaggering up to the back
  door at ten o&rsquo;clock, when most folk would be at supper in the barn,
  her father gone, the village street wrapped in darkness!</p>
  <p>Leopold, by a violent and sudden effort, had regained mastery over the muscles
  of his face and hands, these no longer twitched now, and he answered her
  look of mute inquiry with one of well-feigned quietude. Only his breath he
  could not control, it passed through his throat with a stertorous sound,
  and every now and then he had to pass his tongue over his dry, cracked lips.</p>
  <p>Thus they stood for a moment eye to eye; and what she read in his glance
  caused a nameless fear to strike at her heart and to paralyse her will. But
  the next instant she had recovered her presence of mind. With quick, febrile
  movements she had already taken off her apron and with her hands smoothed
  her unruly dark hair. Then she made for the door.</p>
  <p>Less than a second and already he had guessed her purpose: before she could
  reach the door he had his back against it and his nervy fingers had grasped
  her wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out,&rdquo; she said curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he reiterated hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let go my wrist,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you are hurting me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurt you worse,&rdquo; he cried, in a broken voice, &ldquo;if
  you cross this threshold to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he released her wrist, and she, wrathful, indignant, terrified, retreated
  to the other end of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go out by the back door,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;if you want to
  go out. You have the key, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father . . .&rdquo; she began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go and tell your father that I, Leopold
  Hirsch, your affianced husband, am browbeating you&mdash;making a scene,
  what?&mdash;because you have made an assignation with my lord the young Count,
  here&mdash;at night&mdash;under your father&rsquo;s roof&mdash;under the
  roof of a child of Israel! You! An assignation with a dirty Christian! .
  . . Bah! Go and tell your father that! And he will thrash you to within an
  inch of your life! We are Jews, he and I, and hold the honour of our women
  sacred&mdash;more sacred than their life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Leopold,&rdquo; she cried, feeling that indeed,
  between her father and this madman, her life had ceased to be safe. She looked
  round her helplessly. Three or four besotted fools lying helpless across
  the tables, and all the village dancing and making merry some two hundred
  m&egrave;tres away, her father&mdash;implacable, as she well knew, where
  her conduct was concerned&mdash;and this madman ready to kill to satisfy
  his lust of vengeance and of hate&mdash;she felt that indeed, unless Heaven
  performed a miracle, here was the beginning of an awful, an irredeemable
  tragedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leopold, don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; she reiterated, trying with
  all her might not to appear frightened or scared or confused. &ldquo;I have
  promised Kapus Elsa to go to her dance for half an hour. I had forgotten
  all about it. I must go now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go and change your dress, then,&rdquo; he retorted with a sneer, &ldquo;then
  you can go out by the back way. You have put the key away somewhere, haven&rsquo;t
  you? You know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mad about doors to-night. I tell you I am going out now,
  by that front door&mdash;at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I tell you,&rdquo; he said, slowly and deliberately, &ldquo;that
  if you cross the front door step I will call your father and tell him that
  you go and meet your lover&mdash;a Christian lover&mdash;the young Count&mdash;who
  would as soon think of marrying you as he would a nigger or a kitchen slut.
  Before you will have reached the high road your father and I will be on your
  heels, and either he or I will strangle you ere you come within sight of
  my lord&rsquo;s castle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Or else an idiot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better look for that back-door key,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has the back-door key to do with it?&rdquo; she asked sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that while that monkey-faced
  dog of a Christian was whispering to you just now, I know that the key was
  hanging on its usual peg, but I heard something about &lsquo;supper&rsquo; and
  about &lsquo;ten o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; May he break his neck, I say, and
  save me the job. Then he ordered me out of the room. Oh! I guessed! I am
  no fool, you know! When I came back I looked into your father&rsquo;s room&mdash;the
  key was gone, and I knew. And what I say is, why can&rsquo;t he come in by
  the front door like a man, if he has nothing to hide? Why must you let him
  come in like a thief by a back-door, if you have nothing to be ashamed of?
  The tap-room is open to anybody. Anybody can walk in and get a drink if they
  want to. Then why this whispering and this sneaking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was working himself up to a greater and ever greater passion of fury.
  He kept his voice low because he didn&rsquo;t want Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein
  to hear&mdash;not just yet, at any rate&mdash;for Ign&aacute;cz was a hard
  man and a stern father, and God only knew what he might not do if he was
  roused. Leopold did not want Klara hurt&mdash;not yet, at any rate&mdash;not
  until he was quite sure that she meant to play him altogether false. She
  was vain and frivolous, over-fond of dress and of queening it over the peasant
  girls of the village, but there was no real harm in her. She was immensely
  flattered by the young Count&rsquo;s attentions and over-ready to accept
  his presents in exchange for kisses and whisperings behind closed doors,
  but there was no real harm in her&mdash;so at least Leopold Hirsch kept repeating
  to himself time and again, whenever jealousy gnawed at his heart more roughly
  than he could endure.</p>
  <p>Just now that torment was almost unbearable, and the passion of fury into
  which he had worked himself blinded him momentarily to the dull, aching pain.
  Klara, as he spoke thus hoarsely, and brought his contorted face closer and
  closer to hers, had gradually shrunk more and more into the corner of the
  room, and there she remained now, flattened against the wall, her wide-open,
  terror-filled eyes fixed staringly upon this raving madman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You asked just now,&rdquo; he continued, in the same hoarse, guttural
  whisper, which seemed literally to be racking and tearing his throat as it
  came, &ldquo;what the back-door key had to do with my not going to meet my
  brother at Fiume. Well! It has this much to do with it, that you happen to
  be my tokened wife, that you happen to be of my race and of my blood, a sober,
  clean-living Jewess, please God, and not one of those frivolous, empty-headed
  Christian girls&mdash;you are that now, I know; if you were not I would kill
  you first and myself afterwards: therefore, if to-night I catch a thief&mdash;any
  thief, I don&rsquo;t care who he is&mdash;sneaking into this house by a back
  door when you happen to be here alone and seemingly unprotected, if I catch
  any kind of thief or malefactor, I say . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, and she, through teeth that chattered, contrived to murmur:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? What do you say? Why don&rsquo;t you go on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you understand,&rdquo; he said, with calm as sudden and as
  terrible as his rage had been awhile ago. &ldquo;I am not a Christian, you
  know, nor yet a gentleman. I cannot walk up either to my lord&rsquo;s castle
  or to one of these Christian Magyar peasants and strike him in the face for
  trying to rob me of that which is more precious to me than life. I am a Jew
  . . . a low-born, miserable Jew, whose whole race, origin and upbringing
  are despicable in the sight of the noble lords as well as of the Hungarian
  peasantry. Just a wretched creature whom one orders to hold one&rsquo;s horse,
  to brush one&rsquo;s boots, to stand out of one&rsquo;s way, anyhow; but
  not to meet as man to man, not to fight openly and frankly for the woman
  whom one loves. Well! You happen to be a Jewess too, and tokened to a Jew,
  and if either my lord or one of these d&mdash;&mdash;d Magyar peasants chooses
  to come sneaking round you like a thief in the night, well . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, and from the pocket of his shabby trousers he half drew out a
  long, sheathed hunting-knife, and then quickly hid it again from her sight.</p>
  <p>Klara smothered a desperate cry of terror. Leopold now turned his back on
  her; he went up to the table and seizing a carafe of water, he poured himself
  out a huge mugful and drank it down at a draught. The edge of the mug rattled
  against his teeth, his hand was trembling so that half the contents were
  poured down on his clothes. He did not look again on Klara, but having put
  the mug down, he passed his hand once or twice across his forehead as if
  to chase away some of those horrible thoughts which were still lurking in
  his brain.</p>
  <p>Then he took his cigarette-case out of his pocket, selected a cigarette,
  struck a match and lit it, still avoiding Klara&rsquo;s fixed and staring
  gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and smoke this outside,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I
  can see both doors from the corner. When you have found that back-door key
  you may go to Elsa Kapus&rsquo; wedding feast, but not before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took a final look round the room, and his eyes, which had once more become
  dull and pale, rested with an infinite look of contempt upon the two or three
  besotted drunkards who, throughout this scene, had done no more than open
  and blink a sleepy eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I turn these louts out for you now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she replied mechanically, &ldquo;let them have their
  sleep. When they wake they&rsquo;ll go away all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then the outer door was opened and Lakatos Andor&rsquo;s broad figure
  appeared upon the threshold. Leopold Hirsch gave him a nod, and without another
  look on Klara, he strode out into the night.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;Jealous, Like A Madman.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I came to see if B&eacute;la was still here,&rdquo; said Andor, as
  soon as the door had closed on Leopold Hirsch. &ldquo;One or two chaps whom
  I met awhile ago told me that he had not been seen in the barn this hour
  past, and that there was a lot of talk about it. I thought that if he were
  here, I could persuade you . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, and looked more keenly at the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Klara?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;you seem ill or upset
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She closed her eyes once or twice like someone just waking out of a dream,
  then she passed her hands over her forehead and over her hair. She felt completely
  dazed and stupid, as if she had received a stunning blow on the head, and
  while Andor talked she looked at him with staring eyes, not understanding
  a word that he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, Andor?&rdquo; she said vaguely. &ldquo;What can I
  do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing much, my good Klara,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;it was only
  about B&eacute;la . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;about B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she stammered; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t
  . . . won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She moved forward in order to get him a chair, but she found that she could
  not stand. The moment that she relinquished the prop of the wall, her knees
  gave way under her and she lurched forward against the table. She would have
  fallen had not Andor caught her and guided her to a chair, whereon she sank
  half fainting, with eyes closed and cheeks and lips the colour of ashes.</p>
  <p>Just for the moment the wild thought flew through his mind that she had
  been induced to drink by one of the men, but a closer look on her wan, pale
  face and into those dilated eyes of hers convinced him that the girl was
  in real and acute mental distress.</p>
  <p>He went up to the table and poured out a mug of wine, which he held to her
  lips. She drank eagerly, looking up at him the while with a strangely pathetic,
  eagerly appealing gaze.</p>
  <p>When he had taken the mug from her and replaced it on the table, he drew
  a chair close to her and said as kindly as he could, for he did not feel
  very well-disposed toward the girl who was the cause of much unhappiness
  to Elsa:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Klara, you are going to tell me what is the matter with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already she had recovered herself a little, and Lakatos Andor&rsquo;s
  somewhat dictatorial tone grated upon her sensitive ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with me,&rdquo; she retorted, with
  a return of her habitual flippancy. &ldquo;What should be the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said dryly; &ldquo;and, of course,
  if you tell me that it&rsquo;s a private affair of your own and none of my
  business, why I&rsquo;ll be quite satisfied, and not ask any more questions.
  But if it&rsquo;s anything to do with B&eacute;la . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; she broke in impatiently. &ldquo;What should
  B&eacute;la have to do with my affairs? B&eacute;la has been gone from here
  this hour past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he is not coming back?&rdquo; asked Andor searchingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I trust not,&rdquo; she replied fervently, and the young man noticed
  that the staring, terror-filled look once more crept into her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;that is all I wanted
  to know. I am sorry to have disturbed you. Good-night, Klara.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>He turned to go, and already his hand was on the latch of the door when
  an involuntary cry, like a desperate appeal, escaped her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, speaking over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t like the girl: she had been offensive and insolent to Elsa,
  the cause of Elsa&rsquo;s tears; but just now, when he turned back in answer
  to that piteous call from her, she looked so forlorn, so pathetic, so terrified
  that all the kindliness and chivalry which are inherent in the true Magyar
  peasant rose up in his heart to plead on her behalf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were quite right just now, Andor,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I
  am in trouble&mdash;in grave, terrible trouble. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there anything I can do to help you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;No,
  no, don&rsquo;t get up,&rdquo; he added hurriedly, for she had tried to rise
  and obviously was still unable to stand, &ldquo;just stay where you are,
  and I&rsquo;ll come and sit near you. Is there anything I can do to help
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she whispered under her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll think of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind what I think,&rdquo; he said, a little impatiently; &ldquo;if
  there&rsquo;s anything I can do to help you in your trouble I&rsquo;ll do
  it, but of course I can do nothing unless you tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was trying to make up her mind to tell him, but it was desperately difficult.</p>
  <p>She had always been so careful of her reputation&mdash;so careful that not
  a breath of real scandal should fall on her. She, of the downtrodden race,
  the Jewess whom even the meanest of the peasant girls thought it her right
  to despise, had been doubly careful not to give any loophole for gossip.
  She flirted with all the men, of course&mdash;openly and sometimes injudiciously,
  as in the case of Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la on the eve of his wedding-day; but
  up to now she had never given any cause for scandal, nor anyone the right
  to look down on her for any other reason but that of her race and blood,
  which she could not help.</p>
  <p>It was hard, therefore, to have to own to something that distinctly savoured
  of intrigue, and this to a man who she felt had no cause to be her friend.
  But the situation was desperate; there was that madman outside! God only
  knew of what he would be capable if he found that his jealous suspicions
  had some measure of foundation! And the young Count&mdash;ready to walk presently,
  without thought of coming danger, into the very clutches of that lunatic.</p>
  <p>That of course was unthinkable. There had been murder in Leo&rsquo;s pale
  eyes when he fingered that awful-looking knife. The girl felt that such a
  risk could not be run: even the good opinion of the entire village became
  as nothing in her mind.</p>
  <p>And of course there was the hope and chance that Andor would be chivalrous
  enough to hold his tongue. The young man&rsquo;s keen eyes had watched every
  phase of the conflict which was so distinctly reflected in the Jewess&rsquo;s
  mobile face. He waited patiently until he saw determination gradually asserting
  its sway over her hesitation. The girl interested him, and she was evidently
  in great trouble. Though he had no liking for her, he was anxious to know
  what had disturbed her so terribly and genuinely intended to be of use to
  her. He had no doubt that the trouble had something to do with Leopold Hirsch.
  Everyone knew the latter&rsquo;s jealous disposition, and Andor had not been
  home half a day before he had heard plenty of gossip on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Klara?&rdquo; he asked quietly after awhile, when he saw that
  she appeared to be more calm and more able to speak coherently. &ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t deny that you are in trouble. . . . You have half made up your
  mind to tell me. . . . Well, then, out with it. . . . What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only that Leopold is a swine,&rdquo; she blurted out roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why? What has he done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jealous,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;like a madman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m at my wits&rsquo; end, Andor,&rdquo; she moaned appealingly. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better tell me, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She threw back her head and looked him squarely in the face with a sudden
  determination to end the present agonizing suspense at all costs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is about young Count Feri.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord?&rdquo; he exclaimed&mdash;for, indeed, up to this last moment
  he had been quite sure in his mind that her trouble had to do with Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la and with her impudent flirtation of this afternoon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said sullenly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a little sweet on
  me, you know&mdash;he admires me and thinks me amusing&mdash;he likes to
  come here sometimes, when he gets tired of starchy Countesses and Baronesses
  over at his castle. He means no harm,&rdquo; she added fiercely, &ldquo;and
  if Leo wasn&rsquo;t such a beast . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has found you out, has he?&rdquo; commented Andor dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly. There was nothing to find out. But Count Feri wanted
  to come and see me this evening to say &lsquo;good-bye,&rsquo; as he is off
  to-morrow for some weeks to shoot bears. He couldn&rsquo;t come till about
  ten o&rsquo;clock, and didn&rsquo;t want to be seen walking into the tap-room
  at that hour of the night. There is the back door, you know,&rdquo; she continued,
  talking a little excitedly and volubly, &ldquo;which my father always keeps
  locked and the key in his pocket, and Count Feri wanted me to give him the
  duplicate key, so that he could slip in that way unobserved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; mused Andor. &ldquo;What would your father have said to
  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father is going to Kecskem&eacute;t presently by the nine o&rsquo;clock
  train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Leopold?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leopold was going with him. He was to have gone to Fiume with the
  express to-morrow to meet his brother, who is coming home from America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;and . . . ?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! He has changed his mind. He is not going to Fiume. He was watching
  me all the afternoon like a regular spy. People had told him that at the
  banquet to-day Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la had been very attentive, so one of his
  jealous fits was on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not without cause, I imagine,&rdquo; said Andor, with a sarcastic
  laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you would stick up for him,&rdquo; she retorted; &ldquo;men
  always band themselves together against an unfortunate girl. But Leo has
  behaved like a brute. He watched me while my lord was talking to me, and
  caught snatches of our conversation. Then my lord sent him out of the room
  to look after his horse whilst he pressed me to give him the key of the back
  door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could I guess that Leopold would be such a swine! It seems that
  when he came back he peeped into father&rsquo;s room and noticed at once
  that the key was gone. He guessed, of course&mdash;now he has threatened
  to tell father if I attempt to go out of this house. He won&rsquo;t let me
  out of his sight, and yet I must go and give Count Feri a warning and get
  that key back from him. If Leo tells father, father will half kill me, and
  already Leo has threatened to strangle me if he finds me on the high road
  on my way to the castle. My lord suspects nothing, of course . . .&rdquo; she
  added, while tears of impotence and of terror choked the words in her throat. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
  come here presently, and as like as not Leopold will do for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She burst into a passionate fit of weeping. Andor waited quietly until the
  first paroxysm of sobs had subsided, and she could hear what he said, then
  he remarked quite quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As like as not, as you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t have him hurt,&rdquo; she murmured through her
  tears. &ldquo;Leo would kill him for sure. You don&rsquo;t know, Andor, what
  Leopold is like when the jealous rage is in him. He is outside this house
  now, watching. And there he will stand and wait and watch; and he will waylay
  Count Feri when he comes, and stab him with a hideous knife which he always
  carries in his pocket. Oh! It&rsquo;s horrible!&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;horrible!
  I don&rsquo;t know what to do. What can I do? Andor, tell me, what can I
  do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would you like to do?&rdquo; he asked more gently, for indeed
  the girl&rsquo;s grief and terror were pitiable to behold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run over to the castle,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and get the key
  back from Count Feri, and tell him on no account to come to-night. It is
  only a step; I could be back here in half an hour, and father is asleep in
  the next room. I should be back before he need start for the station. But
  Leopold is watching outside. He declared that he would strangle me or else
  tell father if I set foot outside this house. He is a brute, isn&rsquo;t
  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you see, my dear Klara, I understand that you are tokened to
  Leopold now, and a man has a way of thinking that his affianced wife is his
  own, and not for other men to hang round her and make a fool of him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse him!&rdquo; she muttered savagely; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never
  marry him after this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you will,&rdquo; he retorted, with a light laugh; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
  like him all the better presently for these outbursts of jealousy. A woman
  often gets fondest of the man she fears the most. But in the meanwhile you
  are at your wits&rsquo; ends, eh, my pretty Klara? You can&rsquo;t think
  of any way out of your present difficulty, what? And to-night at ten o&rsquo;clock
  there will be an awful scandal and worse&mdash;murder, perhaps!&mdash;and
  where will you be after that, eh, my pretty Klara? Even if your father does
  not break his stick over your shoulders, you&rsquo;ll have anyhow to leave
  this village, for the village will be too hot to hold you. And as your father
  does mighty good business at Marosfalva, he will not look too kindly on the
  daughter who, by her scandalous conduct, has driven him to seek a precarious
  fortune elsewhere. The situation certainly is a desperate one for you, my
  pretty one, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You need not tell me all that, Andor,&rdquo; she said sullenly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  I know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he continued, slowly and deliberately, &ldquo;that
  there never was a woman before quite so desperately in need of a friend as
  you are, eh, Klara?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no friend,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A friend, I mean, who would go and do your errand for you over at
  the castle, what?&mdash;and warn his young and noble lordship not to show
  his aristocratic face in Marosfalva to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t such a friend, Andor, unless you . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! You don&rsquo;t want me to go out and kill Leopold Hirsch,
  do you?&rdquo; he said dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or engage him in a brawl while you run round to the castle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be no good. He&rsquo;d only tell father,&rdquo; she said,
  while a shiver ran through her body; &ldquo;and they would kill me on my
  return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly. What you want is, to stay here quite quietly, just as if
  nothing had happened, whilst the friend of whom I spoke just now went and
  got back that key which is causing so much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s what I want, Andor,&rdquo; she cried eagerly; &ldquo;and
  if you . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; he broke in quietly; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say
  that I was that friend, did I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you are only tormenting me. It isn&rsquo;t kind when I&rsquo;m
  in such trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to torment you, Klara,&rdquo; he said more softly. &ldquo;I
  will even go so far as to say that I might be that useful friend. You understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! You&rsquo;ll make conditions for doing that friendly act for
  me. I understand well enough,&rdquo; she said, still speaking with fierce
  sullenness. &ldquo;What are your conditions?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Klara,&rdquo; he replied earnestly, &ldquo;a bargain is
  a bargain, isn&rsquo;t it? I will get you out of this trouble, and what&rsquo;s
  more, I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue about it. But you leave Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la
  alone . . . understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! You know well enough what I mean,&rdquo; he said, almost roughly
  now, for the name of Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, which he himself had brought
  into this matter, had at once conjured up in his mind the painful visions
  of this afternoon&mdash;Elsa&rsquo;s tears, her humiliation and unhappiness&mdash;and
  had once more hardened his heart against the woman who had been the cause
  of it all. &ldquo;You know well enough what I mean. Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la
  is full of vanity, your attentions to-day pleased him, and he neglected Elsa
  as he had no right to do. Now I don&rsquo;t say for a moment that you meant
  any harm. It was only your vanity that was pleasantly tickled too, but you
  made Elsa unhappy, and that is what I mean when I say that a bargain is a
  bargain. If I get you out of your trouble to-night, you must leave Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la severely alone in the future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a fine one to preach,&rdquo; she retorted, with a harsh laugh. &ldquo;As
  if you weren&rsquo;t in love with Elsa, though Elsa will be B&eacute;la&rsquo;s
  wife to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My being in love with Elsa has nothing to do with the matter. Nor
  am I preaching to you. You want me to do you a service and I&rsquo;ve told
  you my price. You can accept it or not as you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la running after me,&rdquo; came
  as a final sullen protest from the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you will have to try and help it, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he
  said emphatically, &ldquo;if you want me to help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She said nothing for a moment, whilst her dark eyes searched his own, trying
  to see how much determination lay behind that stern-looking face of his,
  then she murmured gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I promise . . . what you want me to promise, Andor . . . will
  you go and see Count Feri at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A promise isn&rsquo;t enough,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An oath, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An oath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will bring me back that abominable key, and tell Count Feri
  just what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you will swear,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I will swear,&rdquo; she cried eagerly now, for indeed
  a heavy load had been lifted off her heart, and her natural buoyancy of temperament
  was already reasserting its sway over her terrors and agony of mind. &ldquo;What
  do you want me to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swear by Almighty God,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;to leave
  Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la alone, never to flirt with him or do anything to cause
  Elsa the slightest unhappiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear it by Almighty God,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;and
  you need not be afraid,&rdquo; she added slowly; &ldquo;I will not break
  my oath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! I am not afraid that you will, for if you do . . . Well! we won&rsquo;t
  talk about that,&rdquo; he continued more lightly. &ldquo;I suppose there
  isn&rsquo;t much time to be lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t
  make straight for the main road; go up the village first and then back through
  the fields; Leopold might suspect something&mdash;one never knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Klara, I&rsquo;ll do my best. We can but pray that I shall
  find my lord at home, in which case I can be back in twenty minutes. I&rsquo;ll
  pick up a friend or even two when I return, as then we can all walk into
  the tap-room together. It won&rsquo;t be so conspicuous as if I came in alone.
  What is the time now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>She went to the partition door, opened it and peeped into her father&rsquo;s
  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just ten minutes to nine,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;father will have
  gone by the time you come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be as well, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he concluded, as
  he finally turned to go. &ldquo;If you are not in the tap-room when I come
  back, what shall I do with the key?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She pointed to a small brass tray which stood on the table in among the
  litter of bottles, glasses, mugs and tobacco-jars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just on there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;then if I come into the room
  later, I can see it there at a glance; and oh! what a relief it will be!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The colour had come back to her cheeks. Indeed, she felt marvellously cheerful
  now and reassured. She knew that Andor would fulfil his share of the bargain,
  and the heavy cloud of trouble and of terror would be permanently lifted
  from her within the next half-hour.</p>
  <p>In her usual, light-hearted, frivolous way she blew a kiss to Andor. But
  the young man, without looking again on her, had already opened the door,
  and the next moment he had gone out into the dark night on his errand of
  friendship.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;I Go Where I Shall Be More Welcome.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>In the meanwhile, in the barn time had been flying along on the wings of
  enjoyment. Ever since six o&rsquo;clock, when vespers were well over and
  the gipsies had struck up the first cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, merry feet had
  been tripping it almost incessantly.</p>
  <p>It is amazing what a capacity the young Hungarian peasant&mdash;man or woman&mdash;has
  for footing the national dance. With intervals of singing and of gossiping
  these young folk in the barn had been going on for over three hours.</p>
  <p>And they were not even beginning to get tired. To the Hungarian peasants,
  be it remembered, the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s is not merely a dance, though
  they enjoy the movement, of course, the exhilaration and the excitement of
  the music, just as all healthy young animals would enjoy gambolling on a
  meadow; there is a deeper meaning to these children of the plains in the
  sweet, sad strains of their songs and in the mazes and intricacies of their
  dance.</p>
  <p>They put their whole life, their entire sentiment for country and sweetheart,
  in the music and in the dance, and the music and the dance give outward expression
  to their feelings, speak in the language of poetry which they feel well enough,
  but which their untutored tongue cannot frame.</p>
  <p>A Hungarian peasant in sorrow or distress will probably, like his Western
  prototype, seek to drown his grief in drink; far be it from his chronicler&rsquo;s
  mind to suggest that his sentiments are more elevated than those of the peasantry
  of other nations, or his morality more sound. He will get drunk, too, like
  men of other nations, but he will do it to the accompaniment of music. The
  gipsy band must be there, when he is in trouble or in joy&mdash;one or two
  fiddles, perhaps a clarionet, always a czimbalom&mdash;just these few instruments
  to play his favourite songs. They don&rsquo;t ease his sorrow, but they help
  to soothe it by bringing tears to his eyes and softening the bitterness of
  his grief.</p>
  <p>And in joy he will invariably dance; when he is in love he will dance, for
  the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s helps him to explain to the girl whom he loves
  exactly what he feels for her. And she understands. One cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s
  will reveal to a Hungarian village maid the state of her lover&rsquo;s heart
  far more clearly than do all the whisperings behind hedges in more civilized
  lands.</p>
  <p>It was in the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s five years ago that Elsa had learned
  from Andor how much he loved her; it was during the mazes of the dance that
  she was able to overcome her shyness and tell him mutely that she loved him
  in return.</p>
  <p>And now it was in the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s that she was bidding farewell
  to-day to her girlhood and to the companions of her youth; to Jen&ouml; and
  M&oacute;ritz, who had loved her ardently and hopelessly these past two years,
  and who must henceforth become to her mere friends. It was in the turns and
  the twirls, with the wild music marking step, that she conveyed all that
  there was in her simple heart of regret for the past and cheerful anticipation
  for the future.</p>
  <p>Elsa was a perfect dancer; it was a joy to have her for a partner, and she
  was indefatigable this afternoon. It seemed as if living fire was in her
  blood, her cheeks glowed, her eyes shone like dark-blue stars; she gave herself
  neither rest nor respite. Determined to enjoy every minute of the day, she
  had forcibly put behind her the sorrowful incidents of the afternoon. She
  would not remember and she would not think.</p>
  <p>Andor was not here, and as the spirit of music and of dancing crept more
  and more into her brain, she almost got to the stage of believing that his
  appearance to-day had only been a dream. Nor would she look to see if Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la were here.</p>
  <p>She knew that he had gone off soon after dancing began. He had slipped away
  quietly, and at first no one had noticed his absence. He had always professed
  a lofty contempt for gipsy music and for the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, a contempt
  which has of late come into fashion in Hungary among the upper classes, and
  has unfortunately been aped by those whose so-called education has only succeeded
  in obliterating the fine national spirit of the past without having the power
  to graft more modern Western culture into this Oriental race.</p>
  <p>Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la belonged to this same supercilious set, and had made
  many enemies by his sarcastic denunciations of things that were almost thought
  sacred in Marosfalva. It was therefore quite an understood thing that the
  moment a cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s was struck up, Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la at once
  went to seek amusement elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Of course to-day was a very different occasion to the more usual village
  entertainments. To-day he should have thought of nothing but his fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s
  pleasure. She was over-fond of dancing, and looked a picture when she danced.
  It was clearly a bridegroom&rsquo;s duty, under these circumstances, to stand
  by and watch his fianc&eacute;e with all the admiration that should be filling
  his heart.</p>
  <p>After the wedding, if he disapproved of the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, why of
  course he could forbid his wife to dance it, and there would be an end of
  the matter. To-day he was still the groom, the servant of his fianc&eacute;e&mdash;to-morrow
  only would he become her master.</p>
  <p>But everyone was so intent upon enjoyment that a long time went by before
  gossip occupied itself exclusively with Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s absence
  from his pre-nuptial feast. When once it began it raged with unusual bitterness.
  The scandal during the banquet was being repeated now. B&eacute;la was obviously
  sitting in the tap-room of the inn, flirting with the Jewess, when he should
  have been in attendance on his bride.</p>
  <p>Elsa could not help but hear the comments that were being made by all the
  mothers and fathers and older people who were not dancing, and who, therefore,
  had plenty of leisure for talk. All the proprieties were being outraged&mdash;so
  it was declared&mdash;and Elsa, who might have married so well at one time,
  was indeed now an object of pity.</p>
  <p>She hated to hear all this talk, and felt hideously ashamed that people
  should be pitying her. Vainly did she try to get some measure of comfort
  from her mother. Kapus Irma, irritated by the looks of commiseration which
  were being levelled at her daughter, dubbed the latter a fool for not having
  the sense to know how to keep her bridegroom by her side.</p>
  <p>It was past eight o&rsquo;clock before B&eacute;la put in an appearance
  at all.</p>
  <p>A cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s was in full swing. The compact group of dancers
  was crowded round the musicians&rsquo; platform, for the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s
  can only be properly danced under the very bow&mdash;as it were&mdash;of
  the gipsy leader. The barn looked gaily lighted up with oil-lamps swinging
  down from the rafters above, and it had been most splendidly decorated for
  the occasion with festoons of paper flowers and tri-colour flags. Petticoats
  and ribbons were flying, little feet in red leather boots were kicking up
  clouds of dust.</p>
  <p>There was no moon to-night, the sky was heavy with clouds, so the village
  street had been very dark. Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la blinked as he entered the
  barn, so dazzling did the picture present itself to his gaze.</p>
  <p>And there was such an atmosphere of merriment and of animation about the
  place that instinctively B&eacute;la&rsquo;s thoughts flew back to the dismal
  and dingy little tap-room whence he had just come, with a few drunken fellows
  sprawling in corners and Leopold Hirsch&rsquo;s ugly face leering out of
  the shadows.</p>
  <p>Here everyone was gay and good-tempered. The gipsies scraped their fiddles
  till one would have thought their arms would break, the young people danced,
  the men shouted and sang. It was a pandemonium of giddiness and music and
  laughter.</p>
  <p>And B&eacute;la, as he blinked and looked upon the scene, remembered that
  he had paid for it all. He had paid for the hire of the barn, the music and
  the lighting; he had paid for the lavish supper which would be served presently.
  And as he had had more silvorium to drink in the tap-room than was altogether
  good for the clearness of his brain, he fell to thinking that he ought now
  to be received and welcomed with all the deference which his lavishness deserved.
  He thought that the young people should have left off dancing when he appeared,
  and should have greeted him, as they would undoubtedly have greeted my lord
  the Count, had the latter deigned to come.</p>
  <p>And what, after all, was my lord on such an occasion in comparison with
  the donor of the feast?</p>
  <p>Even Elsa&mdash;though she must, of course, have seen him&mdash;did not
  stop in her senseless gyrations. She was dancing with Barna M&oacute;ritz&mdash;the
  mayor&rsquo;s youngest son and a splendid dancer&mdash;and the two young
  people went on twirling and twisting and flirting and laughing just as if
  he&mdash;the real host&mdash;had not been there.</p>
  <p>Enraged at all this indifference, this want of recognition of his dignity,
  he elbowed his way through the dense group of spectators which formed a phalanx
  round the dancers. The wide and voluminous petticoats of the women formed
  a veritable hedge through which he had to scramble and to push. As the people
  recognized him they gave him pleasant greetings, for the Hungarian peasant
  is by nature kindly and something of an opportunist; there was no occasion
  to quarrel openly with Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, who was rich and influential.</p>
  <p>But he paid no heed either to the greetings or to the whispered comments
  that followed in their wake. He just felt that he was the master of this
  place, and he meant everyone else to know and acknowledge this fact. So he
  strode up to the czig&aacute;ny and ordered them peremptorily to draw this
  interminable cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s to an end; it had lasted quite long enough,
  he said, and the girls looked a sight with their crimson, perspiring faces;
  he was not going to have such vulgar goings-on at any of his wedding feasts.</p>
  <p>The gipsy leader never thought of disobeying, of course; it was the <i>tekintetes &uacute;r</i> (honoured
  gentleman) who was paying them for their work, and they had to do as they
  were told.</p>
  <p>Despite loud protests from the dancers, the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s was brought
  to a lovely and whirling close. Panting, hot and beaming, the dancers now
  mingled with the rest of the throng, and a pandemonium of laughter and chatter
  soon filled the barn from end to end.</p>
  <p>Elsa, in accordance with the custom which holds sway even at village dances,
  was even now turning to walk away with her partner, whose duty it was to
  conduct her to her mother&rsquo;s side. She felt wrathful with B&eacute;la&mdash;as
  wrathful, at least, as so gentle a creature could be. She was ashamed of
  his behaviour, ashamed for herself as well as for him, and she didn&rsquo;t
  want to speak with him just now.</p>
  <p>But he, still feeling dictatorial and despotic, had not yet finished asserting
  his authority. He called to her loudly and peremptorily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa! I want a word with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come directly, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she replied, speaking
  over her shoulder. &ldquo;I want to speak to mother for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can speak to her later,&rdquo; he rejoined roughly. &ldquo;I
  want a word with you now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And without more ado he pushed his way up close to Elsa&rsquo;s side, elbowing
  Barna M&oacute;ritz with scant ceremony. An angry word rose to the younger
  man&rsquo;s lips, and a sudden quarrel was only averted by a pleading look
  from Elsa&rsquo;s blue eyes. It would have been very unseemly, of course,
  to quarrel with one&rsquo;s host on such an occasion. M&oacute;ritz, swallowing
  his wrath, withdrew without a word, even though he cursed B&eacute;la for
  a brute under his breath.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la took Elsa&rsquo;s arm and led her aside out of the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said roughly, &ldquo;how I hate you to mix with
  that rowdy lot like you do; and you know that I look on the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s
  as indecent and vulgar. Why do you do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The rowdy lot, as you call them, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she replied
  firmly, &ldquo;are my friends, and the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s is a dance which
  all true Magyars dance from childhood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t choose to allow my wife to dance it,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And after to-morrow I will obey you, B&eacute;la. To-day I asked
  my mother if I might dance. And she said yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And remember that to-night I take leave of my girlhood,&rdquo; she
  said gently, determined not to quarrel. &ldquo;My friends like to monopolize
  me . . . it&rsquo;s only natural.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! They are not my friends, anyway, and I&rsquo;d rather you did
  not dance another cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;but I have
  promised Feh&eacute;r K&aacute;roly and also Jen&ouml;. They would be disappointed
  if I broke my promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll have to be disappointed, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made no reply, but looking at her face, which he saw in profile, he
  could not fail to note that her lips were tightly set and that there was
  an unwonted look of determination round her mouth. He drew in his breath,
  for he was quite ready for a second conflict of will to-day, nor, this time,
  was the issue for a moment in doubt in his mind. Women were made to obey&mdash;their
  parents first and then their husbands. In this case B&eacute;la knew well
  enough that his authority was fully backed by that of Elsa&rsquo;s mother&mdash;the
  invalid father, of course, didn&rsquo;t count, but Kapus Irma wanted that
  house on the Kender Road, she wanted the servant and the oxen, the chickens
  and the pigs, she wanted all the ease and the luxury which her rich son-in-law
  would give her.</p>
  <p>No! There was no fear that Elsa would break her tokened word. In this semi-Oriental
  land, where semi-Oriental thought prevails, girls do not do that sort of
  thing&mdash;if they do, it is to their own hurt, and Elsa was not of the
  stuff of which rebellious or perjured women are made.</p>
  <p>Therefore B&eacute;la now had neither fear nor compunction in asserting
  that authority which would be his to the full to-morrow. He felt that there
  was a vein of rebellion in Elsa&rsquo;s character, and this he meant to drain
  and to staunch till it had withered to nothingness. It would never do for
  him&mdash;of all men&mdash;to have a rebellious or argumentative wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; he said, with absolute finality, &ldquo;you
  can go and talk to your precious friends as much as you like, so long as
  you behave yourself as a tokened bride should, but I will not have you dance
  that abominable cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s again to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And have you behaved to-day, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she retorted quite
  gently, &ldquo;as a tokened bridegroom should?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with it,&rdquo; he replied, with a harsh
  laugh. &ldquo;I am a man, and you are a girl, and even the most ignorant
  Hungarian peasant will tell you that there is a vast difference there. But
  I am not going to argue about it with you, my dear. I merely forbid you to
  dance a dance which I consider indecent. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I am sorry, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she said, speaking at least as
  firmly as he did, &ldquo;but I have given my promise, and even you would
  not wish me to break my word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean to disobey me, then?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not after to-morrow. To-day I have my mother&rsquo;s permission,
  and I am going to dance one cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s now with Feh&eacute;r K&aacute;roly
  and one after supper again with Jen&ouml;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They had both unconsciously raised their voices during these last few words,
  and thus aroused the attention of some of the folk, who had stood by to listen.
  Of course, everyone knew of B&eacute;la&rsquo;s aversion to the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s,
  and curiosity prompted gaffers and gossips to try and hear what would be
  the end of this argument between the pretty bride&mdash;who certainly looked
  rather wilful and obstinate now&mdash;and her future lord and master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well said, little Elsa!&rdquo; came now in ringing accents from the
  foremost group in the little crowd; &ldquo;we must see you dance the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s
  once or twice more before that ogre has the authority to shut you up in his
  castle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Moreover, your promise has been made to me,&rdquo; asserted Feh&eacute;r
  K&aacute;roly lustily, &ldquo;and I certainly shall not release you from
  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Jen&ouml;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you listen to B&eacute;la, my little Elsa,&rdquo; said
  one of the older women; &ldquo;you are still a free girl to-day. You just
  do as you like&mdash;to-morrow will be time enough to do as he tells you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this opinion the married men present were not prepared to endorse, and
  one or two minor arguments and lectures ensued anent a woman&rsquo;s duty
  of obedience.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la had said nothing while these chaffing remarks were being passed
  over his head; and now that public attention was momentarily diverted from
  him, he took Elsa&rsquo;s hand and passed it under his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had better go to your mother now, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
  said, with what seemed like perfect calm. &ldquo;You said just now that you
  wished to speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Elsa allowed him to lead her away. She tried vainly to guess what was going
  on in his mind. She knew, of course, that he must be very angry. Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la beaten in an argument was at no time a very pleasant customer,
  and now he surely was raging inwardly, for he had set his heart on exerting
  his authority over this matter of the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s and had signally
  failed.</p>
  <p>But she could not see how he felt, for he kept his face averted from her
  inquiring gaze.</p>
  <p>Kapus Irma greeted her future son-in-law with obvious acerbity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hear you have been teasing Elsa again,&rdquo; she said crossly. &ldquo;Why
  can&rsquo;t you let her enjoy herself just for to-night, without interfering
  with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I am not going to interfere with her,&rdquo; he replied, with
  a sneer. &ldquo;You have given her such perfect lessons of disobedience
  and obstinacy that it will take me all my time in the future to drill her
  into proper wifely shape. But to-night I am not going to interfere with her.
  She has told me plainly that she means to do just as she likes and that you
  have given her leave to defy me. Public opinion, it seems, is all in her
  favour too. So I have just brought your dutiful daughter back to you, and
  now I am free to make myself scarce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To make yourself scarce?&rdquo; exclaimed Irma. &ldquo;What do you
  mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I say. I am not going to stay here, where I am jeered at
  by a lot of loutish, common peasants, who seem to have forgotten that I am
  paying for their enjoyment and for all the food and drink which they will
  consume presently. However, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. Everyone
  seems to look upon this entertainment as Elsa&rsquo;s feast, and upon Elsa
  as the hostess and the queen. I am so obviously in the way and of no consequence.
  I go where I shall be more welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had dropped Elsa&rsquo;s arm and was turning to go, but Irma had caught
  hold of his coat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with you, is it, Irma n&eacute;ni?&rdquo; he
  replied dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; she retorted; &ldquo;why, you can&rsquo;t go
  away like that&mdash;not before supper&mdash;you can&rsquo;t for Elsa&rsquo;s
  sake&mdash;what would everybody say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care one brass fill&eacute;r what anybody says, Irma
  n&eacute;ni, and you know it. As for Elsa, why should I consider her? She
  has plenty of friends to stand by her, it seems, in her disobedience to my
  wishes. She has openly defied me, and made me look a fool. I am not going
  to stand that, so I go elsewhere&mdash;or I might do or say something which
  I might be sorry for later on&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to speak quietly and not to raise his voice, but it was also obvious
  that self-control was costing him a mightily vigorous effort, for the veins
  in his temples were standing up like cords, and his one eye literally shone
  with a sinister and almost cruel glow.</p>
  <p>Kapus Irma turned to her daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa,&rdquo; she said fretfully, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be such a goose.
  I won&rsquo;t have you quarrelling with B&eacute;la like this, just before
  your wedding. Just you kiss him now, and tell him you didn&rsquo;t mean to
  vex him. We can&rsquo;t have everybody gossiping about this affair! My goodness!
  As if a cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s or two mattered.&rdquo; . . .</p>
  <p>But here B&eacute;la&rsquo;s harsh laugh broke in on her mutterings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your breath, Irma n&eacute;ni,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;Even
  if Elsa were to come and beg my pardon now I would not remain here. I don&rsquo;t
  care for such tardy, perfunctory obedience, and this she will learn by and
  by. For to-night, if you and she feel ashamed and uncomfortable, well! so
  much the better. Village gossip doesn&rsquo;t affect me in the least. I do
  as I like, and let all the chattering women go to h&mdash;&mdash;l. Good-night,
  Irma n&eacute;ni&mdash;good-night, Elsa! I hope you will be in a better frame
  of mind to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And before Kapus Irma could detain him or utter another protest, he was
  gone, and she turned savagely on her daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are never going to let us all be
  shamed like this? Run after him at once, and bring him back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t come back, mother, if I begged him ever so . .
  .&rdquo; said Elsa drearily; &ldquo;and besides&mdash;where should I find
  him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On his way to Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s, of course. If you
  run you can easily overtake him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, mother,&rdquo; protested Elsa; &ldquo;how can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just do as I tell you, my girl!&rdquo; said Irma firmly,
  and with a snap of her lean jaws. &ldquo;By the Holy Virgin, child! Are you
  going to disobey your mother now? God will punish you, you know, if you go
  on like that. Go at once as I tell you. Run out by this door here. No one
  will see you, you will overtake B&eacute;la before he is half-way down the
  street, and then you must just bring him back. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long habits of obedience were so ingrained in the girl that at this moment&mdash;though
  she felt quite sure that all her attempts would be in vain, and though she
  felt bitterly humiliated at having to make such attempts&mdash;she never
  thought of openly defying her mother. Indeed, she quite believed that God
  would punish her if she rebelled so constantly, for this had been drilled
  into her since her earliest childhood&rsquo;s days.</p>
  <p>Fortunately for the moment everyone&rsquo;s attention was concentrated on
  a table of liquid refreshments in a remote corner of the barn, and Elsa and
  her mother were practically isolated here, and the last little scene had
  gone by unobserved.</p>
  <p>Irma picked a shawl from off her own shoulders and put it round her daughter;
  then she gave her a final significant push. Elsa, with her tear-dimmed eyes,
  could scarcely find the little side door which was fashioned in the wooden
  wall itself, and gave direct access into the street.</p>
  <p>God would punish her if she defied her mother; well! God&rsquo;s wrath must
  be harder to bear than the bitter humiliation to which her mother had so
  airily condemned her. To beg B&eacute;la&rsquo;s forgiveness, to assure him
  of her obedience, to stand shamed before him and before all her friends,
  surely God couldn&rsquo;t want her to do all that?</p>
  <p>But already she had crossed the threshold and was out in the dark, silent
  street. She ran on mechanically in the direction of the inn; her mother&rsquo;s
  commands seemed to be moving her along, for certainly her own will had nothing
  to do with it. Her cheeks were aflame, and her eyes burned with all the tears
  which she would not shed, but she herself felt cold and numb, as she ran
  on blindly, stupidly, to where she had just seen a tiny speck of light.</p>
  <p>The night was dark but exquisitely calm&mdash;perfectly still, yet full
  of those mysterious whisperings which come from the bosom of the plain, the
  flutter of birds&rsquo; wings, snug in their night&rsquo;s lodgings amongst
  the drooping branches of pollarded willows, the quiver of the plumed heads
  of maize, touched by some fairy garment as it brushed by, the call of the
  cricket from among the tall sunflowers and the quiver of the glow-worm on
  the huge pumpkin leaves.</p>
  <p>Elsa knew all these soft whisperings; she was a child of this immense and
  majestic plain, and all the furtive little beasts that dwelt within its maze
  were bosom friends of hers.</p>
  <p>At other times, when her mind and heart had been at peace, she loved these
  dark, calm nights, when heavy clouds hid the light of the moon and sounds
  grew louder and more distinct as the darkness grew more tense; neither fluttering
  of unseen wings nor quiver of stealthy footsteps had the power to startle
  her; they were all her friends, these tiny dwellers of the plain, these midnight
  marauders of whom townsfolk are always so afraid.</p>
  <p>At first, when she perceived the tiny speck of light on ahead, she thought
  that it must be a glow-worm settled on the leaves of the dahlias outside
  the school-house, for glow-worms had been over-abundant this late summer,
  but soon she saw that the burning speck was moving along, on ahead in the
  same direction as she herself was going&mdash;on the way to Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la had lighted a cigar when he left the barn; nursing his resentment,
  he had walked along rapidly toward the inn, his head whirling with thoughts
  of the many things which he meant to do in order to be revenged on Elsa this
  night.</p>
  <p>Of course a long visit to Klara fully entered into those schemes, and now
  he paused just at the foot of the verandah steps breathing in the soft evening
  air with fully dilated nostrils and lungs, so that his nerves might regain
  some semblance of that outward calm which his dignity demanded.</p>
  <p>And thus, standing still, he heard through the silence the patter of small,
  high-heeled boots upon the hard road. He guessed at once that Elsa had been
  sent along by her mother to bring him back, and a comforting glow of inward
  satisfaction went right through his veins as, after a slight moment of hesitation,
  he made up his mind to await Elsa&rsquo;s coming here, to listen to her apologies,
  to read her the lecture which she fully deserved, but nevertheless to continue
  the plan of conduct which he had mapped out for himself.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;On The Eve Of One&rsquo;s Wedding Day Too.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>He could not see Elsa till she was quite close to him, and even then he
  could only vaguely distinguish the quaint contour of her wide-sleeved shift
  and of her voluminous petticoats.</p>
  <p>But his cigar had gone out, and when Elsa stood quite close to him, and
  softly murmured his name, he struck a match very deliberately, and held it
  to the cigar so that it lighted up his face for a few seconds. He wanted
  her to see how indifferent was the expression in his eye, and that there
  was not the slightest trace of a welcoming smile lurking round his lips.</p>
  <p>Therefore he held the lighted match close to his face much longer than was
  necessary; he only dropped it when it began to scorch his fingers. Then he
  blew a big cloud of smoke out of his cigar straight into her face, and only
  after that did he say, speaking very roughly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother sent me, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she said timidly, as she placed
  a trembling little hand on his coat-sleeve. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
  come, only she ordered me, and I couldn&rsquo;t disobey her, so I . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t disobey your mother, eh?&rdquo; he sneered; &ldquo;you
  couldn&rsquo;t defy her as you did me, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to defy you, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she said, striving
  with all her might to keep back the rebellious words which surged out of
  her overburdened heart to her quivering lips. &rdquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be
  unkind to Jen&ouml; and K&aacute;roly, and all my old friends, just this
  last evening, when I am still a girl amongst them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You preferred being obstinate and wilful toward me, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us quarrel, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not quarrelling,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I came to the barn
  just now looking forward to the pleasure of having you to myself for a little
  bit. There was a lot I wanted to say to you&mdash;just quietly, in a corner
  by our two selves. And how did I find you? Hot and panting, after an hour&rsquo;s
  gyrations, hardly able to stand, and certainly not able to speak; and at
  my simple request that you should give up a dance of which I whole-heartedly
  disapprove, you turned on me with impudence and obstinacy. I suppose you
  felt yourself backed up by your former sweetheart, and thought you could
  just treat me like the dirt under your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He certainly had proved himself a good advocate in his own cause. The case
  thus put succinctly and clearly before her appeared very black to Elsa against
  herself. Ever ready for self-deprecation, she began to think that indeed
  she had behaved in a very ugly, unwomanly and aggressive manner, and her
  meekness cost her no effort now when she said gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, B&eacute;la! I seem to have been all queer the whole
  of to-day. It is a very upsetting time for any girl, you must remember. But
  Pater Bonif&aacute;cius said that if any sin lay on my conscience since my
  last confession, I could always find him in church at seven o&rsquo;clock
  to-morrow morning, before our wedding Mass, so as to be quite clear of sin
  before Holy Communion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; he said, with a hard laugh. &ldquo;You
  had better find him in church to-morrow morning, and tell him that you have
  been wilful and perverse and disobedient. He&rsquo;ll give you absolution,
  no doubt. So now you&rsquo;d better go back to your dancing. Your many friends
  will be pining for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you . . . won&rsquo;t you come back with me, B&eacute;la?&rdquo; she
  pleaded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I won&rsquo;t. I have told your mother plainly enough that I
  wasn&rsquo;t coming back. So why she should have sent you snivelling after
  me, I can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that even if mother hadn&rsquo;t sent me I should have come
  ultimately. I am not quite sure, but I think I should have come. I know that
  I have done wrong, but we are all of us obstinate and mistaken at times,
  aren&rsquo;t we, B&eacute;la? It is rather hard to be so severely punished,&rdquo; she
  added, with a wistful little sigh, &ldquo;on the eve of one&rsquo;s wedding
  day too, which should be one of the happiest days in a girl&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Severely punished?&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Bah! As if you wanted
  me over there. You&rsquo;ve got all your precious friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I do want you, B&eacute;la. All the time that you were not in
  the barn this afternoon I . . . I felt lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you send for your old sweetheart? He would
  have cheered you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; she said earnestly, and
  once more her little hand grasped his coat-sleeve; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
  know how it hurts. I don&rsquo;t want to think of Andor. I only want to think
  of you, and if you would try and be a little patient, I am sure that we would
  understand one another better very soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope so, my dear,&rdquo; he rejoined dryly, &ldquo;for your sake&mdash;as
  I am not a patient man; let me tell you that. Come, give me a kiss and run
  back to your mother. I can&rsquo;t bear to have a woman snivelling near me
  like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew her toward him with that rough, perfunctory gesture which betokened
  the master rather than the lover. Then with one hand he raised her chin up
  and brought her face quite close to his. Even then he could not see her clearly
  because of the heavy clouds in the sky. But the air seemed suddenly to have
  become absolutely still, not a breath of wind stirred the leaves of the acacia
  trees, and all those soft sighings and mysterious whisperings which make
  the plain always appear so full of life were for the moment hushed. Only
  from far away came the murmur of the sluggish waters of the Maros, and from
  its shores the call of a heron to its mate. Elsa made vigorous efforts to
  swallow her tears. The exquisite quietude of Nature, that call of the heron,
  the scent of dying flowers which lingered in the autumn air, made her feel
  more strongly than she had ever felt before how beautiful life might have
  been.</p>
  <p>Pater Bonif&aacute;cius&rsquo; words rang in her ears: &ldquo;You are going
  to be happy in God&rsquo;s way, my child, which may not be your way, but
  must be an infinitely better one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well! For the moment Elsa didn&rsquo;t see how this was going to be done;
  she did not see how she could ever be happy beside this tyrannical, arrogant
  man who would be, and meant to be, her master rather than her mate.</p>
  <p>Even now the searching look wherewith his one eye, with its sinister expression,
  tried to read her very soul had in it more of pride of possession, more of
  the appraiser of goods than the ardour of a bridegroom. B&eacute;la cursed
  the darkness which prevented his reading now every line of that pure young
  face which was held up to his; he longed with all the passionate masterfulness
  of his temperament to know exactly how much awe, how much deference, how
  much regard she felt for him. Of love he did not think, nor did he care if
  it never came; but this beautiful prize which had been coveted by so many
  was his at last, and he meant to mould it and wield it in accordance with
  his pleasure.</p>
  <p>But in spite of his callousness and his selfishness, the intense womanliness
  of the girl stirred the softer emotions of his heart; there was so much freshness
  in her, so much beauty and so much girlishness that just for one brief second
  a wave, almost of tenderness, swept over his senses.</p>
  <p>He kissed the pure young lips and drank in greedily their exquisite sweetness,
  then he said somewhat less harshly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are too pretty, my dove, to put on those modern airs of emancipated
  womanhood. If you only knew how much better you please me like this, than
  when you try to argue with me, you would always use your power over me, you
  little goose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made no reply, for, despite the warm woollen shawl round her shoulders,
  she had suddenly felt cold, and a curious shiver had gone right through her
  body, even whilst her future lord did kiss her. But no doubt it was because
  just then an owl had hooted in the poplar trees far away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are coming back then, B&eacute;la?&rdquo; she asked, after a
  few seconds of silence and with enforced cheerfulness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; he said condescendingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, now, don&rsquo;t begin again,&rdquo; he broke in impatiently. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
  I said that I&rsquo;ll think about it? You run back to your mother now. I
  may come later&mdash;or I may not. But if you bother me much more I certainly
  won&rsquo;t. If I come, I come of my own free will; there&rsquo;s no woman
  living who has ever persuaded me to do anything against my will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And without vouchsafing her another word or look, without deigning to see
  her safely on her way back to the barn, he turned leisurely on his heel,
  and mounting the steps of the verandah before him, he presently pushed open
  the tap-room door and disappeared within.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;If You Loved Me.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Elsa stood for a moment quite still there in the dark, with the silence
  of the night and all its sweet sounds encompassing her, and the scent of
  withered flowers and slowly-dying leaves mounting to her quivering nostrils.</p>
  <p>What did it all mean? What did life mean? And what was the meaning of God?
  She, the ignorant, unsophisticated peasant girl, knew nothing save what Pater
  Bonif&aacute;cius had taught her, and that was little enough&mdash;though
  the little was hard enough to learn.</p>
  <p>Resignation to God&rsquo;s will; obedience to parents first and to husband
  afterwards; renunciation of all that made the days appear like a continual
  holiday and filled the nights with exquisite dreams!</p>
  <p>But if life only meant that, only meant duty and obedience and resignation,
  then why had God made such a beautiful world, why had He made the sky and
  the birds and the flowers, the nodding plumes of maize and the tiny, fleecy
  clouds which people the firmament at sunset?</p>
  <p>Was it worth while to deck this world in such array if the eyes of men were
  always to be filled with tears, and their backs bent to their ever-recurring
  tasks?</p>
  <p>A heavy sigh escaped from the girl&rsquo;s overburdened heart: the riddle
  of the universe was too hard an one for her simple mind to solve. Perhaps
  it was best after all not to think of these things which she was too ignorant
  to understand. She looked at the door of the tavern through which B&eacute;la
  had gone. He had left it wide open, and she caught a glimpse of him now as
  he sat at one of the tables, and leaning his elbow on it, rested his chin
  in his hand.</p>
  <p>Then, with another little sigh, she was just turning to go when the sound
  of her name spoken in a whisper and quite close to her sent her pulses quivering
  and made her heart beat furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa! Wait a moment!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Andor?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I came up just now and heard your voice and B&eacute;la&rsquo;s.
  I waited on the off-chance of getting a word with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t stop, Andor. Mother will be wondering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he retorted with undisguised bitterness. &ldquo;The
  mother who sent you on this abominable and humiliating errand won&rsquo;t
  worry much after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one seems to worry much about me, do they, Andor?&rdquo; she said,
  a little wistfully.</p>
  <p>He drew a little closer to her, so close that he could feel her shoulder
  under the shawl quivering against his arm. Her many petticoats brushed about
  his shins, and he could hear her quick, warm breath as it came and went.
  He bent his head quite close to her, as he had done that day, five years
  ago, in the mazes of the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, and now&mdash;as then&mdash;his
  lips almost touched her soft young neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why should you worry about them, Elsa?&rdquo; he whispered slowly
  in her ear. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you let them all be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let them all be?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But everyone will be wondering
  if I don&rsquo;t go back&mdash;at least for supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean about the dance and the supper, Elsa,&rdquo; he
  continued, still speaking in a whisper and striving to subdue the hoarseness
  in his voice which was engendered by the passion which burned in his veins, &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t only mean to-night. I mean . . . for good.&rdquo; . . .</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For good?&rdquo; she repeated slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me take you away, Elsa,&rdquo; he entreated, &ldquo;away from
  here. Leave all these rough, indifferent and selfish folk. Come out with
  me to Australia, and let all these people be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At first, of course, she didn&rsquo;t understand him; but gradually his
  meaning became clear and she gave one long, horrified gasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor! How can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has been borne upon me, Elsa, these hours past, that I am a coward
  and a villain to let you go on with this miserable life. Nay! it&rsquo;s
  worse than that, for your future life with that bully, that brute, will be
  far more wretched than you have any idea now. He doesn&rsquo;t care for you,
  Elsa&mdash;not really&mdash;not as I care for you, not as you&mdash;the sweetest,
  gentlest, purest woman in the world&mdash;should be cared for and cherished.
  He doesn&rsquo;t love you, Elsa, he doesn&rsquo;t even really want you&mdash;not
  as I want you&mdash;I, who would give my life, every drop of my blood, to
  have you for myself alone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gradually, as he spoke, his arms had clasped round her, his passionate whispers
  came in short gasps to her ear. Gently now she disengaged herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I am tokened to B&eacute;la, Andor,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;To-morrow
  is my wedding day. I have made my confession. Pater Bonif&aacute;cius has
  prepared me for Holy Communion. My word is pledged to B&eacute;la.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t love you, Elsa, and he is not your husband yet.
  Your pledged word does not bind you before God. To-day you are still free.
  You are free until you have sworn before the altar of God. Elsa! B&eacute;la
  doesn&rsquo;t want you, he doesn&rsquo;t love you. And I love you and want
  you with my whole heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak like that, Andor, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she almost
  pleaded. &ldquo;You must know how wrong it is for you to speak and for me
  to listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I must speak, Elsa,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;and you have got
  to listen. We could get away now, Elsa, to-night, by the nine-twenty train.
  Over at the barn no one would know that you had gone until it got too late
  to run after you. Never mind about your clothes. I have plenty of money in
  my pocket, and to-morrow when we get to Budapesth we can get what you want.
  By the next day we should be in Fiume, and then we would embark on the first
  ship that is outward bound. I know just how to manage, Elsa. You would have
  nothing to do, nothing to think of, but just give yourself over into my keeping.
  You are a free woman, Elsa, bound to no one, and the first opportunity we
  had we would get married. Out there in Australia I can get plenty of work
  and good pay: we shouldn&rsquo;t be rich, Elsa&mdash;not as rich as you would
  be if you married Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la, but by God I swear that we would
  be happy, for every minute of my life would be devoted to your happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All the while that he spoke she had made persistent efforts to disengage
  herself from his grasp. She felt that she must get away from him, away from
  his insinuating voice, from the ardour of those whispered words which seemed
  to burn into her very soul. The very night seemed to be in league with him,
  the darkness and the silence and all those soft sounds of gently-murmuring
  river and calls of birds and beasts, and the fragrance of dying flowers which
  numbed the senses and obliterated the thought of God, of duty and of parents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Andor,&rdquo; she murmured feebly, &ldquo;you have no right
  to speak like that. I am tokened to B&eacute;la. I have sworn that I would
  be his wife. My hand was in his and the Pater blessed us; and it was after
  Holy Communion and when Christ Himself was in my heart! And there is mother
  too and father, the house which B&eacute;la promised them, the oxen and the
  pigs, a maid to look after father. Mother would curse me if I cheated her
  of all that now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When we are settled in Australia,&rdquo; he pleaded earnestly, &ldquo;we
  will write to your parents and send them money to come out and join us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father is paralysed. How could he come? And mother would curse me.
  And a mother&rsquo;s curse, Andor, is registered by God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elsa, if you loved me you would leave father and mother and come
  with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then perhaps I do not love you, Andor,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;for
  I could not bear my mother&rsquo;s curse, I could not break the pledge which
  I swore after Holy Communion! I could not commit so great a sin, Andor, not
  even for your sake, for if I did remorse would break my heart, and all your
  love for me would not compensate me for the sin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And before he could say another word, before his arms could once more close
  round her or his trembling hands clutch at her fluttering petticoats, she
  was gone&mdash;vanished out of his grasp and into the darkness, and only
  the patter of her little feet broke the silence of the night.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;In Any Case Elsa Is Not For You.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Andor with a sigh of heartbroken disappointment now turned to go into the
  inn. He had the key in his hand which my lord the young count had given him
  with a careless laugh and a condescending nod of acknowledgment for the service
  thus rendered to him and to Klara.</p>
  <p>The door of the tap-room was still wide open, a narrow wedge-shaped light
  filtrated through on to the beams and floor of the verandah, making the surrounding
  blackness seem yet more impenetrable.</p>
  <p>Andor entered the tap-room and walked straight up to the centre table, and
  he placed the key upon the small tray which Klara had pointed out to him.
  Then he turned and looked around him: Klara was not there, and the room was
  quite deserted. Apparently the sleepers of awhile ago had been roused from
  their slumbers and had departed one by one. For a moment Andor paused, wondering
  if he should tell Klara that he had been successful in his errand. He could
  hear the murmur of the girl&rsquo;s voice in the next room talking to her
  father.</p>
  <p>No! On the whole he preferred not to meet her again: he didn&rsquo;t like
  the woman, and still felt very wrathful against her for the impudent part
  she had played at the feast this afternoon.</p>
  <p>He had just made up his mind to go back to the presbytery where the kind
  Pater had willingly given him a bed, when Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s broad,
  squat figure appeared in the open doorway. He had a lighted cigar between
  his teeth and his hands were buried in the pockets of his trousers; he held
  his head on one side and his single eye leered across the room at the other
  man.</p>
  <p>When he encountered Andor&rsquo;s quick, savage glance he gave a loud, harsh
  laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She gave it you straight enough, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he said
  as he swaggered into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were listening?&rdquo; asked Andor curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I was,&rdquo; replied B&eacute;la. &ldquo;I was in here and
  I heard your voice, so I stole out on to the verandah. You were not ten paces
  away; I could hear every word you said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well what?&rdquo; sneered the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What conclusion did you arrive at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What conclusion?&rdquo; retorted B&eacute;la, with a laugh. &ldquo;Why,
  my good man, I came to the conclusion that in spite of all your fine talk
  about God and so on, and all your fine airs of a gentleman from Australia,
  you are nothing but a low-down cur who comes sneaking round trying to steal
  a fellow&rsquo;s sweetheart from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you are right there, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; said Andor, with
  a quick, impatient sigh and with quite unwonted meekness. &ldquo;I suppose
  I am, as you say, nothing but a low-down cur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my friend, that&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; assented the other dryly; &ldquo;but
  she&rsquo;s let you know pretty straight, hasn&rsquo;t she? that she wouldn&rsquo;t
  listen to your talk. Elsa will stick by me, and by her promise to me, you
  may bet your shirt on that. She is too shrewd to think of exchanging the
  security of to-day for any of your vague promises. She is afraid of her mother
  and of me and of God&rsquo;s curses and so on, and she does not care enough
  about you to offend the lot of us, and that&rsquo;s about how it stands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right there, B&eacute;la, that is about how it stands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so, my fine gentleman,&rdquo; concluded B&eacute;la, with a sneer, &ldquo;you
  cannot get rid of me unless you are ready to cut my throat and to hang for
  it afterwards. In any case, you see, Elsa is not for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andor said nothing for the moment. It seemed as if vaguely in his mind some
  strong purpose had already taken birth and was struggling to subjugate his
  will. His bronzed face marked clearly the workings of his thoughts: at first
  there had been a dulled, sombre look in his dark, deep-set eyes; then gradually
  a flame seemed to flicker in them, feebly at first, then dying down for awhile,
  then rising again more triumphant, more glowing than before, even as the
  firm lines around the tightly-closed lips became more set and more expressive
  of a strong resolve.</p>
  <p>Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein&rsquo;s querulous voice was heard in the other room,
  giving fussy directions to his daughter about the collecting and packing
  up of his things. Anon, he opened the door and peered out into the tap-room:
  he had heard the confused murmur of footsteps and of voices, and possible
  customers must not be neglected even at an anxious moment of departure.</p>
  <p>Seeing B&eacute;la and Andor there, he asked if anything was wanted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said B&eacute;la impatiently, &ldquo;nothing more
  to-night. Andor and I are going directly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The narrow hatchet-face once more disappeared behind the door. Klara&rsquo;s
  voice was heard to ask:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is in the tap-room, father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor and B&eacute;la,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;but never
  you mind about the tap-room. Just see that you don&rsquo;t forget my red
  handkerchief, and my fur cap for the journey, and my bottle of . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His mumblings became inaudible, and after awhile B&eacute;la reiterated,
  with an airy laugh:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my friend! Elsa is not for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then it was that Andor&rsquo;s confused thoughts shaped themselves into
  a resolve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not unless you will give her up, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; he said slowly: &ldquo;you
  yourself, I mean&mdash;now&mdash;at this eleventh hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; queried the other harshly&mdash;not understanding. &ldquo;Give
  her up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Tell her that you have thought the whole matter over; that you
  have realized that nothing but unhappiness can come from your union together.
  She would feel a little humiliated at first, perhaps, but she would come
  to me, if you would let her go. I can deal with Irma n&eacute;ni after that.
  If you will release Elsa yourself of her promise she would come to me, I
  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la looked for awhile in silence at the earnest face of the other
  man, then he burst into a loud, mocking laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or else drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am neither,&rdquo; rejoined the other calmly. &ldquo;It is all
  perfectly feasible if only you will release Elsa. You have so often asserted
  that you don&rsquo;t care one brass fill&eacute;r for the opinion of village
  folk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it cannot matter to you if some blame is cast on you for breaking
  off with Elsa on the eve of your wedding. People must see how unsuited you
  are to each other and how unhappy your marriage must eventually turn out.
  You have no feeling about promises, you have no parents who might curse you
  if you break them. Break your promise to Elsa now, B&eacute;la, and you will
  be doing the finest action of your life. Break your promise to her, man,
  and let her come to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>B&eacute;la was still staring at Andor as if indeed he thought the other
  mad, but now an evil leer gradually spread over his face and his one eye
  closed until it looked like a mere slit through which he now darted on Andor
  a look of triumph and of hate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Break my promise to Elsa?&rdquo; he said slowly and deliberately. &ldquo;I
  wouldn&rsquo;t do it, my good man, if you offered me all the gold in your
  precious America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t love her, B&eacute;la,&rdquo; urged Andor, with
  ardent earnestness. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really want her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other roughly, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
  want you to have her either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can it matter to you? There are plenty of pretty girls this
  side of the Maros who would be only too glad to step into Elsa&rsquo;s shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about any pretty girls on this side of the Maros,
  nor on the other either for that matter. I won&rsquo;t give Elsa up to you,
  my friend, and she won&rsquo;t break her promise to me because she fears
  God and her mother&rsquo;s curse. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s far too good for you,&rdquo; cried Andor, with sudden
  vehemence, for he had already realized that he must give up all hope now,
  and the other man&rsquo;s manner, his coarseness and callousness had irritated
  him beyond the bounds of endurance. He hated this cruel, selfish brute who
  held power over Elsa with all the hatred of which his hot Magyar blood was
  capable. A red mist seemed at times now to rise before his eyes, the kind
  of mist that obscures a man&rsquo;s brain and makes him do deeds which are
  recorded in hell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s far too good for you,&rdquo; he reiterated hoarsely,
  even as his powerful fists clenched themselves in a violent effort to keep
  up some semblance of self-control. The thought of Elsa still floated across
  his mental vision, of Elsa whose pure white hand seemed to dissipate that
  ugly red mist with all the hideous thoughts which it brought in its trail. &ldquo;You
  ought to treat her well, man,&rdquo; he cried in the agony of his soul, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
  got to treat her well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other looked him up and down like a man does an enemy whom he believes
  to be powerless to do him any harm. Then he said with a sneer through which,
  however, now there was apparent an undercurrent of boiling wrath:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll treat her just as I choose, and you, my friend, had best
  in the future try to attend to your own business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Andor, obsessed by the one idea, feeling his own helplessness in the
  matter, would not let the matter drop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How you can look at another woman,&rdquo; he said sombrely, &ldquo;while
  Elsa is near you I cannot imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked round him vaguely, as if he wanted all the dumb, inanimate things
  around him to bear witness to this monstrous idea: Elsa flouted for another
  woman! Elsa! the most beautiful woman on God&rsquo;s earth, the purest, the
  best&mdash;flouted! And for whom? for what?&mdash;other girls&mdash;women&mdash;who
  were not worthy to walk in the same street as Elsa! The thought made Andor
  giddy, his glance became more wandering, less comprehending . . . that awful
  red mist was once more blurring his vision.</p>
  <p>And as he looked round him&mdash;ununderstanding and wretched&mdash;his
  glance fell upon the key which he himself had placed upon the brass tray
  a few moments ago; and the key brought back to his mind the recollection
  of Klara the Jewess, her domination over B&eacute;la, her triumph over Elsa,
  and also the terrible plight in which she had found herself when she had
  begged Andor for friendly help, and given him in exchange the solemn promise
  which he had exacted from her.</p>
  <p>This recollection eased somewhat the heavy burden of his anxiety, and there
  was quite a look of triumph in his eyes when he once more turned to B&eacute;la.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one thing certain, and
  that is that Elsa won&rsquo;t have to suffer again from the insolence of
  that Jewess. I have cut the ground from under your feet in that direction,
  my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; retorted B&eacute;la airily. &ldquo;How did you manage
  to do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I rendered her a service this afternoon&mdash;she was in serious
  trouble and asked me to help her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh?&mdash;and may I ask the nature of the trouble&mdash;and of the
  service?&rdquo; sneered the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about the nature of the service. I did help Klara in her
  trouble, and in return she has given me a solemn promise to have nothing
  whatever more to do with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! did she?&rdquo; cried B&eacute;la, whose savage temper, held
  in check for awhile, had at last risen to its habitual stage of unbridled
  fury. All the hot blood had rushed to his head, making his face crimson and
  his eye glowing and unsteady, and his hand shook visibly as he leaned against
  the table so that the mugs and bottles rattled, as did the key upon the metal
  tray. He, too, felt that hideous red mist enveloping him and blurring his
  sight. He hated Andor with all his might, and would have strangled him if
  he had felt that he had the physical power to do it as well as the moral
  strength. His voice came hoarse and hissing through his throat as he murmured
  through tightly clenched teeth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did, did she? And you made her give you that promise which is
  not going to bind her, let me tell you that. But let me also tell you in
  the meanwhile, my fine gentleman from America, that your d&mdash;&mdash;d
  interference will do no good to your former sweetheart, who is already as
  good as my wife&mdash;and will be my wife to-morrow. Klara Goldstein is my
  friend, let me tell you that, and . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment . . . something had arrested the words in his throat.
  As so often occurs in the mysterious workings of Fate, a small, apparently
  wholly insignificant event suddenly caused the full tide of his destiny to
  turn&mdash;and not only of his own destiny but that of many others!</p>
  <p>An event&mdash;a tiny fact&mdash;trivial enough for the moment: the touch
  of his hand against the key upon the brass tray.</p>
  <p>Mechanically he picked up the key: his mind was not yet working quite clearly,
  but the shifty glance of his one eye rested upon the key, and contemplated
  it for awhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he murmured vaguely at last, &ldquo;how strange!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is strange?&rdquo; queried the other&mdash;not understanding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That this key should, so to speak, fall like this into my hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t strange at all,&rdquo; said Andor, with a shrug
  of the shoulders, for now he thought that B&eacute;la was drunk, so curious
  was the look in his eye, &ldquo;considering that I put that key there myself
  half an hour ago&mdash;it is the key of the back door of this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it is,&rdquo; rejoined B&eacute;la slowly, &ldquo;I have had
  it in my possession before now . . . when Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein has been
  away from home, and it was not thought prudent for me to enter this house
  by the front door . . . late at night&mdash;you understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Andor once more shrugged his shoulders in contempt, but vouchsafed
  no further comment, he continued still more slowly and deliberately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange that just as you were trying to interfere
  in my affairs, this key should, so to speak, fall into my hand. Fate plays
  some funny little pranks sometimes, eh, Mr. Guardian Angel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has Fate got to do with it?&rdquo; queried Andor roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you were not aware of the fact,&rdquo; said B&eacute;la
  blandly, as he toyed with the key, &ldquo;that papa Goldstein is going off
  to Kecskem&eacute;t to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Andor slowly, &ldquo;I did know that, but . .
  .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t know, perhaps, that pretty Klara likes a little
  jollification and a bit of fun sometimes, and that papa Goldstein is a very
  strict parent and mightily particular about the proprieties. It is a way
  those cursed Jews have, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Andor again, &ldquo;I did know that too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was speaking in a curious, dazed kind of way now: he suddenly felt as
  if the whole world had ceased to be, and as if he was wandering quite alone
  in a land of dreams. Before him, far away, was that red misty veil, and on
  ahead he could dimly see B&eacute;la, with a hideous grin on his face, brandishing
  that key, whilst somehow or other the face of Leopold Hirsch, distorted with
  passion and with jealousy, appeared to beckon to him from behind that distant
  crimson veil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; continued B&eacute;la, in the same suave and
  unctuous tones which he had suddenly assumed, &ldquo;since pretty Klara is
  fond of jollification and a bit of fun, and her father is over-particular,
  why, that&rsquo;s where this nice little key comes in. For presently papa
  will be gone and the house worthily and properly shut up, and the keys in
  papa Goldstein&rsquo;s pocket, who will be speeding off to Kecskem&eacute;t;
  but with the help of this little key, which is a duplicate one, I&mdash;who
  am a great friend of pretty Klara&mdash;can just slip into the house quietly
  for a comfortable little supper and just a bit of fun; and no one need be
  any the wiser, for I shall make no noise and the back door of this house
  is well screened from prying eyes. Have you any further suggestion to make,
  my fine gentleman from America?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only this, man,&rdquo; said Andor sombrely, &ldquo;that it is you
  who are mad&mdash;or drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! not mad. What harm is there in it? You chose to interfere between
  Klara and me, and I only want to show you that I am the master of my own
  affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll get known. Old R&eacute;zi&rsquo;s cottage is not
  far and she is a terrible gossip. Back door or no back door, someone will
  see you sneaking in or out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if they do&mdash;have you any objection, my dear friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all over the village&mdash;Elsa will hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if she does?&rdquo; retorted B&eacute;la, with a sudden return
  to his savage mood. &ldquo;She will have to put up with it: that&rsquo;s
  all. She has already learned to-day that I do as I choose to do, and that
  she must do as I tell her. But a further confirmation of this excellent lesson
  will not come amiss&mdash;at the eleventh hour, my dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing, B&eacute;la! You wouldn&rsquo;t
  put such an insult on Elsa! You wouldn&rsquo;t . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t what, my fine gentleman, who tried to sneak another
  fellow&rsquo;s sweetheart?&rdquo; sneered B&eacute;la as he drew a step or
  two nearer to Andor. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t what? Come here and have supper
  with Klara while Elsa&rsquo;s precious friends are eating the fare I&rsquo;ve
  provided for them and abusing me behind my back? Yes, I would! and I&rsquo;ll
  stay just as long as I like and let anyone see me who likes . . . and Elsa
  may go to the devil with jealousy for aught I care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was quite close to Andor now, but being half a head shorter, he had to
  look up in order to see the other eye to eye. Thus for a moment the two men
  were silent, measuring one another like two primitive creatures of these
  plains who have been accustomed for generations past to satisfy all quarrels
  with the shedding of blood. And in truth, never had man so desperate a longing
  to kill as Andor had at this moment. The red mist enveloped him entirely
  now, he could see nothing round him but the hideous face of this coarse brute
  with its one leering eye and cruel, sensuous lips.</p>
  <p>The vision of Elsa had quite faded from before his gaze, her snow-white
  hands no longer tried to dissipate that hideous blood-red veil. Only from
  behind Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s shoulder he saw peering at him through
  the mist the pale eyes of Leopold Hirsch. But on them he would not look,
  for he felt that that way lay madness.</p>
  <p>What the next moment would have brought the Fates who weave the destinies
  of mankind could alone have told. B&eacute;la, unconscious or indifferent
  to the menace which was glowing in Lakatos Andor&rsquo;s eyes, never departed
  for a moment from his attitude of swaggering insolence, and even now with
  an ostentatious gesture he thrust the key into his waistcoat pocket.</p>
  <p>Andor gave a hoarse and quickly-smothered cry like that of a beast about
  to spring:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You cur!&rdquo; he muttered through his teeth, &ldquo;you d&mdash;&mdash;d
  cur!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His hands were raised, ready to fasten themselves on the other man&rsquo;s
  throat, when the door of the inner room was suddenly thrown open and Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein&rsquo;s querulous voice broke the spell that hung over the two
  men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, my friends, now then,&rdquo; he said fussily as he shuffled
  into the room, &ldquo;it is time that this respectable house should be shut
  up for the night. I am just off to catch the slow train to Kecskem&eacute;t&mdash;after
  you, my friends, after you, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made a gesture toward the open door and then went up to the table and
  poured himself out a final stirrup-cup. He was wrapped from head to foot
  in a threadbare cloth coat, lined with shaggy fur, a fur-edged bonnet was
  on his head, and he carried a stout stick to which was attached a large bundle
  done up in a red cotton handkerchief. This now he slung over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Klara, my girl,&rdquo; he called.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; came Klara&rsquo;s voice from the inner room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see the back-door key&mdash;the duplicate one I mean&mdash;hanging
  in its usual place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, father, I know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.
  I have it in my pocket. I&rsquo;ll hang it up on the peg in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, girl,&rdquo; he said as he smacked his lips after the long
  draft of wine. &ldquo;You are quite sure Leopold changed his mind about coming
  with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sure, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder, then, he didn&rsquo;t wait to say good-bye to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;ll meet you at the station.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will. Now then, gentlemen,&rdquo; added the old Jew as
  he once more turned to the two men.</p>
  <p>Indeed Andor felt that the spell had been lifted from him. He was quite
  calm now, and that feeling of being in dreamland had descended still more
  forcibly upon his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have nothing more to say to me, have you, my good Andor?&rdquo; said
  B&eacute;la, with a final look of insolent swagger directed at his rival.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Andor slowly and deliberately. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then good-night, my friend!&rdquo; concluded the other, with a sarcastic
  laugh. &ldquo;Why not go to the barn, and dance with Elsa, and sup at my
  expense like the others do? You&rsquo;ll be made royally welcome there, I
  assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. I am going home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! as you like! I shall just look in there myself now for half
  an hour&mdash;but I am engaged later on for supper elsewhere, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I understand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen! My dear friends! I shall miss my train!&rdquo; pleaded
  old Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein querulously.</p>
  <p>He man&oelig;uvred the two men toward the door and then prepared to follow
  them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Klara!&rdquo; he called again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coming, father,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>She came running out of the room, and as she reached the door she called
  to Andor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor, you have not said good-night,&rdquo; she said significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about that now,&rdquo; said Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein fretfully, &ldquo;I
  shall miss my train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He kissed his daughter perfunctorily, then said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one in the tap-room now, is there? I didn&rsquo;t
  notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;no one just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d keep the door shut, if I were you. I&rsquo;d rather
  those fellows back from Arad didn&rsquo;t come in to-night. The open door
  would attract them&mdash;a closed one might have the effect of speeding them
  on their way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, father,&rdquo; she said indifferently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  keep the door closed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And mind you push all the bolts home to both the doors,&rdquo; he
  added sternly. &ldquo;A girl alone in a house cannot be too careful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, father,&rdquo; she rejoined impatiently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  see to everything. Haven&rsquo;t I been alone like this before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other two men were going down the verandah steps. Goldstein went out
  too now and slammed the door behind him.</p>
  <p>And Klara found herself alone in the house.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;What Had Andor Done?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>She waited for a moment with her ear glued to the front door until the last
  echo of the men&rsquo;s footsteps had completely died away in the distance,
  then she ran to the table. The tray was there, but no key upon it. With feverish,
  jerky movements she began to hunt for it, pushing aside bottles and mugs,
  opening drawers, searching wildly with dilated eyes all round the room.</p>
  <p>The key was here, somewhere . . . surely, surely Andor had not played her
  false . . . he would not play her false . . . He was not that sort . . .
  surely, surely he was not that sort. He had come back from his errand&mdash;of
  course she had seen him just now, and . . . and he had said nothing certainly,
  but . . .</p>
  <p>Well! He can&rsquo;t have gone far; and her father wouldn&rsquo;t hear if
  she called. She ran back to the door and fumbled at the latch, for her hands
  trembled so that she bruised them against the iron. There! At last it was
  done! She opened the door and peered out into the night. Everything was still,
  not a footstep echoed from down the street. She took one step out, on to
  the verandah . . . then she heard a rustle from behind the pollarded acacia
  tree and a rustle amongst its leaves. Someone was there!&mdash;on the watch!&mdash;Leopold!</p>
  <p>She smothered a scream of terror and in a moment had fled back into the
  room and slammed and bolted the door behind her. Now she stood with her back
  against it, arms outstretched, fingers twitching convulsively against the
  wood. She was shivering as with cold, though the heat in the room was close
  and heavy with fumes of wine and tobacco: her teeth were chattering, a cold
  perspiration had damped the roots of her hair.</p>
  <p>She had wanted to call Andor back, just to ask him definitely if he had
  been successful in his errand and what he had done with the key. Perhaps
  he meant to tell her; perhaps he had merely forgotten to put the key on the
  tray, and still had it in his waistcoat pocket; she had been a fool not to
  come out and speak to him when she heard his voice in the tap-room awhile
  ago. She had wanted to, but her father monopolized her about his things for
  the journey. He had been exceptionally querulous to-night and was always
  ready to be suspicious; also B&eacute;la had been in the tap-room with Andor,
  and she wouldn&rsquo;t have liked to speak of the key before B&eacute;la.
  What she had been absolutely sure of, however, until now was that Andor would
  not have come back and then gone away like this, if he had not succeeded
  in his errand and got her the key from Count Feri.</p>
  <p>But the key was not there: there was no getting away from that, and she
  had wanted to call Andor back and to ask him about it&mdash;and had found
  Leopold Hirsch standing out there in the dark . . . watching.</p>
  <p>She had not seen him&mdash;but she had felt his presence&mdash;and she was
  quite sure that she had heard the hissing sound of his indrawn breath and
  the movement which he had made to spring on her&mdash;and strangle her, as
  he had threatened to do&mdash;if she went out by the front door.</p>
  <p>Mechanically she passed her hand across her throat. Terror&mdash;appalling,
  deadly terror of her life&mdash;had her in its grasp. She tottered across
  the room and sank into a chair. She wanted time to think.</p>
  <p>What had Andor done? What a fool she had been not to ask him the straight
  question while she had the chance. She had been afraid of little things&mdash;her
  father&rsquo;s temper, Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s sneers&mdash;when now
  there was death and murder to fear.</p>
  <p>What had Andor done?</p>
  <p>Had he played her false? Played this dirty trick on her out of revenge?
  He certainly&mdash;now she came to think of it&mdash;had avoided meeting
  her glance when he went away just now.</p>
  <p>Had he played her false?</p>
  <p>The more she thought on it, the more the idea got root-hold in her brain.
  In order to be revenged for the humiliation which she had helped to put upon
  Elsa, Andor had chosen this means for bringing her to everlasting shame and
  sorrow&mdash;the young Count murdered outside her door, in the act of sneaking
  into the house by a back way, at dead of night, while Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein
  was from home; Leopold Hirsch&mdash;her tokened fianc&eacute;&mdash;a murderer,
  condemned to hang for a brutal crime; she disgraced for ever, cursed if not
  killed by her father, who did not trifle in the matter of his daughter&rsquo;s
  good name. . . . All that was Andor&rsquo;s projected revenge for what she
  had done to Elsa.</p>
  <p>The thought of it was too horrible. It beat into her brain until she felt
  that her head must burst as under the blows of a sledge-hammer or else that
  she must go mad.</p>
  <p>She pushed back the matted hair from her temples, and looked round the tiny,
  dark, lonely room in abject terror. From far away came the shrill whistle
  of the engine which bore her father away to Kecskem&eacute;t. It must be
  nearly half-past nine, then, and close on half an hour since she had been
  left here alone with her terrors. Yet another half-hour and . . .</p>
  <p>No, no! This she felt that she could not endure&mdash;not another half-hour
  of this awful, death-dealing suspense. Anything would be better than that&mdash;death
  at Leopold&rsquo;s hands&mdash;a quick gasp, a final agony&mdash;yes! That
  would be briefer and better&mdash;and perhaps Leo&rsquo;s heart would misgive
  him&mdash;perhaps . . . but in any case, anything <i>must</i> be better than
  this suspense.</p>
  <p>She struggled to her feet; her knees shook under her: for the moment she
  could not have moved if her very life had depended on it. So she stood still,
  propped against the table, her hands clutching convulsively at its edge for
  support, and her eyes dilated and staring, still searching round the room
  wildly for the key.</p>
  <p>At last she felt that she could walk; she tottered back across the room,
  back to the door, and her twitching fingers were once more fumbling with
  the bolts.</p>
  <p>The house was so still and the air was so oppressive. When she paused in
  her fumbling&mdash;since her fingers refused her service&mdash;she could
  almost hear that movement again behind the acacia tree outside, and that
  rustling among the leaves.</p>
  <p>She gave a wild gasp of terror and ran back to the chair&mdash;like a frightened
  feline creature, swift and silent&mdash;and sank into it, still gasping,
  her whole body shaken now as with fever, her teeth chattering, her limbs
  numb.</p>
  <p>Death had been so near! She had felt an icy breath across her throat! She
  was frightened&mdash;hideously, abjectly, miserably frightened. Death lurked
  for her, there outside in the dark, from behind the acacia tree! Death in
  the guise of a jealous madman, whose hate had been whetted by an hour&rsquo;s
  lonely watch in the dark&mdash;lonely, but for his thoughts.</p>
  <p>Tears of self-pity as well as of fear rose to the unfortunate girl&rsquo;s
  eyes; convulsive sobs shook her shoulders and tore at her heart till she
  felt that she must choke. She threw out her arms across the table and buried
  her face in them and lay there, sobbing and moaning in her terror and in
  her misery.</p>
  <p>How long she remained thus, crying and half inert with mental anguish and
  pain, she could not afterwards have told. Nor did she know what it was that
  roused her from this torpor, and caused her suddenly to sit up in her chair,
  upright, wide-awake, her every sense on the alert.</p>
  <p>Surely she could not have heard the fall of footsteps at the back of the
  house! There was the whole width of the inner room and two closed doors between
  her and the yard at the back, and the ground there was soft and muddy; no
  footstep, however firm, could raise echoes there.</p>
  <p>And yet she had heard! Of that she felt quite sure, heard with that sixth
  sense of which she, in her ignorance, knew nothing, but which, nevertheless,
  now had roused her from that coma-like state into which terror had thrown
  her, and set every one of her nerves tingling once more and pulsating with
  life and the power to feel.</p>
  <p>For the moment all her faculties seemed merged into that of hearing. With
  that same sixth sense she heard the stealthy footsteps coming nearer and
  nearer. They had not approached from the village, but from the fields at
  the back, and along the little path which led through the unfenced yard straight
  to the back door.</p>
  <p>These footsteps&mdash;which seemed like the footsteps of ghosts, so intangible
  were they&mdash;were now so near that to Klara&rsquo;s supersensitive mind
  they appeared to be less than ten paces from the back door.</p>
  <p>Then she heard another footstep&mdash;she heard it quite distinctly, even
  though walls and doors were between her and them&mdash;she heard the movement
  from behind the acacia tree&mdash;the one that stands at the corner of the
  house, in full view of both the doors&mdash;she heard the rustle among its
  low-hanging branches and that hissing sound as of an indrawn breath.</p>
  <p>She shot up from her chair like an automaton&mdash;rigid and upright, her
  mouth opened as for a wild shriek, but all power of sound was choked in her
  throat. She ran into the inner room like one possessed, her mouth still wide
  open for the frantic shriek which would not come, for that agonizing call
  for help.</p>
  <p>She fell up against the back door. Her hands tore at the lock, at the woodwork,
  at the plaster around; she bruised her hands and cut her fingers to the bone,
  but still that call would not come to her throat&mdash;not even now, when
  she heard on the other side of the door, less than five paces from where
  she lay, frantic with horror, a groan, a smothered cry, a thud&mdash;then
  swiftly hurrying footsteps flying away in the night.</p>
  <p>Then nothing more, for she was lying now in a huddled mass, half unconscious
  on the floor.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;The Shadow That Fell From The Tall Sunflowers.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>How Klara Goldstein spent that terrible night she never fully realized.
  After half an hour or so she dragged herself up from the floor. Full consciousness
  had returned to her, and with it the power to feel, to understand and to
  fear.</p>
  <p>A hideous, awful terror was upon her which seemed to freeze her through
  and through; a cold sweat broke out all over her body, and she was trembling
  from head to foot. She crawled as far as the narrow little bed which was
  in a corner of the room, and just managed to throw herself upon it, on her
  back, and there to remain inert, perished with cold, racked with shivers,
  her eyes staring upwards into the darkness, her ears strained to listen to
  every sound that came from the other side of the door.</p>
  <p>But gradually, as she lay, her senses became more alive; the power to think
  coherently, to reason with her fears, asserted itself more and more over
  those insane terrors which had paralysed her will and her heart. She did
  begin to think&mdash;not only of herself and of her miserable position, but
  of the man who lay outside&mdash;dying or dead.</p>
  <p>Yes! That soon became the most insistent thought.</p>
  <p>Leopold Hirsch, having done the awful deed, had fled, of course, but his
  victim might not be dead, he might be only wounded and dying for want of
  succour. Klara&mdash;closing her eyes&mdash;could almost picture him, groaning
  and perhaps trying to drag himself up in a vain endeavour to get help.</p>
  <p>Then she rose&mdash;wretched, broken, terrified&mdash;but nevertheless resolved
  to put all selfish fears aside and to ascertain the full extent of the tragedy
  which had been enacted outside her door. She lit the storm-lantern, then,
  with it in her hand, she went through the tap-room and opened the front door.</p>
  <p>She knew well the risks which she was running, going out like this into
  the night, and alone. Any passer-by might see her&mdash;ask questions, suspect
  her of connivance when she told what it was that she had come out to seek
  in the darkness behind her own back door. But to this knowledge and this
  small additional fear she resolutely closed her mind. Drawing the door to
  behind her, she stepped out on to the verandah and thence down the few steps
  into the road below.</p>
  <p>A slight breeze had sprung up within the last half-hour, and had succeeded
  in chasing away the heavy banks of cloud which had hung over the sky earlier
  in the evening.</p>
  <p>Even as Klara paused at the foot of the verandah steps in order to steady
  herself on her feet, the last filmy veil that hid the face of the moon glided
  ethereally by. The moon was on the wane, golden and mysterious, and now,
  as she appeared high in the heaven, surrounded by a halo of prismatic light,
  she threw a cold radiance on everything around, picking out every tree and
  cottage with unfailing sharpness and casting black, impenetrable shadows
  which made the light, by contrast, appear yet more vivid and more clear.</p>
  <p>All around leaves and branches rustled with a soft, swishing sound, like
  the whisperings of ghosts, and from the plains beyond came that long-drawn-out
  murmur of myriads of plume-crowned maize as they bent in recurring unison
  to the caress of the wind.</p>
  <p>Klara&rsquo;s eyes peered anxiously round. Quickly she extinguished her
  lantern, and then remained for a while clinging to the wooden balusters of
  the verandah, eyes and ears on the alert like a hunted beast. Two belated
  csik&oacute;s (Herdsmen in charge of foals) from a neighbouring village were
  passing down the main road, singing at the top of their voices, their spurred
  boots clinking as they walked. Klara did not move till the murmur of the voices
  and the clinking of metal had died away and no other sound of human creature
  moving or breathing close by broke the slumbering echoes of the village.</p>
  <p>Only in the barn, far away, people were singing and laughing and making
  merry. Klara could hear the gipsy band, the scraping of the fiddles and banging
  of the czimbalom, followed now and then by one of those outbursts of jollity,
  of clapping of mugs on wooden tables, of banging of feet and shouts of laughter
  which characterize all festive gatherings in Hungary.</p>
  <p>Cautiously now Klara began to creep along the low wall which supported the
  balustrade. Her feet made no noise in the soft, sandy earth, her skirts clung
  closely to her limbs; at every minute sound she started and paused, clinging
  yet closer to the shadow which enveloped her.</p>
  <p>Now she came to the corner. There, just in front of her was the pollarded
  acacia, behind which the murderer had cowered for an hour&mdash;on the watch.
  The slowly withering leaves trembled in the breeze and their soughing sounded
  eerie in the night, like the sighs of a departing soul.</p>
  <p>Further on, some twenty paces away, was old R&eacute;zi&rsquo;s cottage.
  All was dark and still in and around it. Klara had just a sufficient power
  of consciousness left to note this fact with an involuntary little sigh of
  relief. The murderer had done his work quickly and silently; his victim had
  uttered no cry that would rouse the old gossip from her sleep.</p>
  <p>When Klara at last rounded the second corner of the house and came in full
  view of the unfenced yard in the rear, she saw that it was flooded with moonlight.
  For a moment she closed her eyes, for already she had perceived that a dark
  and compact mass lay on the ground within a few feet of the back door. She
  wanted strength of purpose and a mighty appeal to her will before she would
  dare to look again. When she reopened her eyes, she saw that the mass lay
  absolutely still. She crept forward with trembling limbs and knees that threatened
  to give way under her at every moment.</p>
  <p>Now she no longer thought of herself; there was but little fear of anyone
  passing by this way and seeing her as she gradually crawled nearer and nearer
  to that inert mass which lay there on the ground so rigid and silent. Beyond
  the yard there were only maize-fields, and a tall row of sunflowers closed
  the place in as with a wall. And not a sound came from old R&eacute;zi&rsquo;s
  cottage.</p>
  <p>Klara was quite close to that dark and inert thing at last; she put out
  her hand and touched it. The man was lying on his face; just as he had fallen,
  no doubt; with a superhuman effort she gathered up all her strength and lifted
  those hunched-up shoulders from the ground. Then she gave a smothered cry;
  the pallid face of Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was staring sightlessly up at the
  moon.</p>
  <p>Indeed, for the moment the poor girl felt as if she must go mad, as if for
  ever and ever after this&mdash;waking or sleeping&mdash;she would see those
  glassy eyes, the drooping jaw, that horrible stain which darkened the throat
  and breast. For a few seconds, which to her seemed an eternity, she remained
  here, crouching beside the dead body of this unfortunate man, trying in vain
  in her confused mind to conjecture what had brought B&eacute;la here, instead
  of the young Count, within the reach of Leopold&rsquo;s maniacal jealousy
  and revenge.</p>
  <p>But her brain was too numbed for reasoning and for coherent thought. She
  had but to accept the facts as they were: that Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la lay
  here&mdash;dead, that Leopold had murdered him, and that she must save herself
  at all costs from being implicated in this awful, awful crime!</p>
  <p>At last she contrived to gather up a sufficiency of strength&mdash;both
  mental and physical&mdash;to turn her back upon this terrible scene. She
  had struggled up to her feet and was turning to go when her foot knocked
  against something hard, and as&mdash;quite mechanically&mdash;her eyes searched
  the ground to see what this something was, she saw that it was the key of
  the back door, which had evidently escaped from the dead man&rsquo;s hand
  as he fell.</p>
  <p>To stoop for it and pick it up&mdash;to run for the back door, which was
  so close by&mdash;to unlock and open it and then to slip through it into
  the house was but the work of a few seconds&mdash;and now here she was once
  again in her room, like the hunted beast back in its lair&mdash;panting,
  quivering, ready to fall&mdash;but safe, at all events.</p>
  <p>No one had seen her, of that she felt sure. And now she knew&mdash;or thought
  she knew&mdash;exactly what had happened. Lakatos Andor had been to the castle;
  he had seen my lord and got the key away from him. He wanted to ingratiate
  himself with my lord and to be able to boast in the future that he had saved
  my lord&rsquo;s life, but evidently he did mean to have his revenge not only
  on herself&mdash;Klara&mdash;but also on Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la for the humiliation
  which they had put upon Elsa. It was a cruel and a dastardly trick of revenge,
  and in her heart Klara had vague hopes already of getting even with Andor
  one day. But that would come by and by&mdash;at some future time&mdash;when
  all this terrible tragedy would have been forgotten.</p>
  <p>For the present she must once more think of herself. The key was now a precious
  possession. She went to hang it up on its accustomed peg. Even Leopold&mdash;if
  he stayed in the village to brazen the whole thing out&mdash;could not prove
  anything with regard to that key. Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la might have been a
  casual passer-by, strolling about among the maize-fields, not necessarily
  intent on visiting Klara at dead of night. The key was now safely on its
  peg; who would dare swear that Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la or anyone else ever
  had it in his possession?</p>
  <p>In fact, the secret rested between five people, of which she&mdash;Klara&mdash;was
  one and the dead man another. Well, the latter could tell no tales, and she,
  of course, would say nothing. Already she had determined&mdash;even though
  her mind was still confused and her faculties still numb&mdash;that ignorance
  would be the safest stronghold behind which she could entrench herself.</p>
  <p>There remained Leo himself, the young Count, and, of course, Andor. Which
  of these three would she have the greatest cause to fear?</p>
  <p>There was Leo mad with jealousy, the young Count indifferent, and Andor
  with curious and tortuous motives in his heart which surely he would not
  wish to disclose.</p>
  <p>She had a sufficiency of presence of mind to go out and fetch the storm-lantern
  from where she had left it at the foot of the verandah steps. A passer-by
  who saw her in the act wished her a merry good-night, to which she responded
  in a steady voice. Then she carefully locked the front door, and finally
  undressed and went to bed. There was no knowing whether some belated wayfarer
  might not presently come on the dead man lying there in the yard: and having
  roused the neighbours, the latter might think of calling on Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein for spirit or what not. It was not generally known that Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein was from home, and if people thumped loudly and long at her door,
  she must appear as if she had just been roused from peaceful sleep.</p>
  <p>She felt much more calm and fully alive, above all, to her own danger. That
  kind of superstitious, unreasoning terror which had assailed her awhile ago
  had almost entirely left her. She seemed more composed, more sure of herself,
  now that she had been out in the yard and seen the whole <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> of
  the tragedy, which before that she had only vaguely imagined.</p>
  <p>But what she felt that she could not do was to lie here alone in the dark,
  with only the silvery light of the moon creeping in weirdly through the dulled
  panes of the tiny window. So she picked up her black skirt, and stuffed it
  into the narrow window embrasure, until not a ray of light from within could
  be seen to peep through on the other side. She had placed the storm-lantern
  in the corner, and this she left alight. It threw a feeble, yellowish glimmer
  round the room; after a few moments, when her eyes were accustomed to this
  semi-gloom, she found that she could see every familiar object quite distinctly;
  even the shadows did not seem impenetrable, nor could ghosts lurk in the
  unseen portions of the tiny room.</p>
  <p>Of course there was no hope of sleep&mdash;Klara knew well the moment that
  she looked on the dead man&rsquo;s face, that she would always see it before
  her&mdash;to the end of her days. She saw it now, quite distinctly&mdash;especially
  when she closed her eyes; the moonlit yard, the shadow that fell from the
  tall sunflowers, and the huddled, dark mass on the ground, with the turned-up
  face and the sightless eyes. But she was not afraid; she only felt bitterly
  resentful against Andor, who, she firmly believed, had played her an odious
  trick.</p>
  <p>She almost felt sorry for Leopold, who had only sinned because of his great
  love for her.</p>

 </b><b>&ldquo;We Shall Hear Of Another Tragedy By And By.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>And so in Marosfalva there was no wedding on the festival day of S. Michael
  and All Angels; instead of that, on the day following, there was a solemn
  Mass for the dead in the small village church, which was full to overflowing
  on that great occasion.</p>
  <p>Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la had been found&mdash;out in the open&mdash;murdered
  by an unknown hand. Feh&eacute;r K&aacute;roly and his brother, who lived
  down the Fekete Road, had taken a cut across the last maize-field&mdash;the
  one situated immediately behind the inn kept by Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein,
  and they had come across B&eacute;la&rsquo;s body, lying in the yard, with
  face upturned and eyes staring up sightlessly at the brilliant blue sky overhead.</p>
  <p>It was then close on eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The dancing in
  the barn had been kept up till then, even though the two most important personages
  of the festive gathering were not there to join in the fun.</p>
  <p>The bridegroom had not been seen since his brief appearance an hour or two
  before supper, and Elsa had only just sat through the meal, trying to seem
  cheerful, but obviously hardly able to restrain her tears. After supper,
  when her partner sought her for the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, she was nowhere
  to be found. Kapus Irma&mdash;appealed to&mdash;said that the girl was fussy
  and full of nerves&mdash;for all the world like a born lady. She certainly
  wasn&rsquo;t very well, had complained of headache, and been allowed by her
  mother to go home quietly and turn into bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has another two jolly days to look forward to,&rdquo; Irma n&eacute;ni
  had added complacently. &ldquo;Perhaps it is as well that she should get
  some rest to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ah, well! it was a queer wedding, and no mistake! The queerest that had
  ever been in Marosfalva within memory of man. A bride more prone to tears
  than to laughter! A bridegroom surly, discontented, and paying marked attentions
  to the low-down Jewess over at the inn under his future wife&rsquo;s very
  nose!</p>
  <p>It was quite one thing for a man to assert his own independence, and to
  show his bride at the outset on whose feet the highest-heeled boots would
  be, but quite another to flout the customs of the countryside and all its
  proprieties.</p>
  <p>When, after supper, good and abundant wine had loosened all tongues, adverse
  comments on the absent bridegroom flowed pretty freely. This should have
  been the merriest time of the evening&mdash;the merriest time, in fact, of
  all the three festive days&mdash;the time when one was allowed to chaff the
  bride and to make her blush, to slap the lucky bridegroom on the back and
  generally to allow full play to that exuberance of spirits which is always
  bubbling up to the surface out of a Magyar peasant&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>No doubt that B&eacute;la&rsquo;s conduct had upset Elsa and generally cast
  a gloom over the festive evening. But the young people were not on that account
  going to be done out of their dancing; the older ones might sit round and
  gossip and throw up their hands and sigh, but that was no reason why the
  gipsies should play a melancholy dirge.</p>
  <p>A cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s it must be, and of the liveliest! And after that
  another and yet another. Would it not be an awful pity to waste Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la&rsquo;s money, even though he was not here to enjoy its fruits?
  So dancing was kept up till close on eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;till
  the sun was high up in the heavens and the bell of the village church tolled
  for early Mass. Until then the gipsies scraped their fiddles and banged their
  czimbalom almost uninterruptedly; hundreds of sad and gay folk-songs were
  sung in chorus in the intervals of dancing the national dance. Cotton petticoats
  of many hues fluttered, leather boots&mdash;both red and black&mdash;clinked
  and stamped until the morning.</p>
  <p>Then it was that the merry company at last broke up, and that Feh&eacute;r
  K&aacute;roly and his brother took the short cut behind the inn, and found
  the bridegroom&mdash;at whose expense they had just danced and feasted&mdash;lying
  stark and stiff under the clear September sun.</p>
  <p>They informed the mayor, who at once put himself in communication with the
  gendarmerie of Arad: but long before the police came, the news of the terrible
  discovery was all over the village, and there was no thought of sleep or
  rest after that.</p>
  <p>Worried to death, perspiring and puzzled, the police officers hastily sent
  down from Arad had vainly tried to make head or tail of the mass of conflicting
  accounts which were poured into their ears in a continuous stream of loud-voiced
  chatter for hours at a stretch: and God only knows what judicial blunders
  might have been committed before the culprit was finally brought to punishment
  if the latter had not, once for all, himself delivered over the key of the
  mystery.</p>
  <p>Leopold Hirsch had hanged himself to one of the beams in his own back shop.
  His assistant found him there&mdash;dead&mdash;later in the day.</p>
  <p>As&mdash;by previous arrangement&mdash;the whole village was likely to be
  at Elsa Kapus&rsquo; wedding, there would not have been much use in keeping
  the shop open. So the assistant had been given a holiday, but he came to
  the shop toward midday, when the whole village was full of the terrible news
  and half the population out in the street gossiping and commenting on it&mdash;marvelling
  why his employer had not yet been seen outside his doors.</p>
  <p>The discovery&mdash;which the assistant at once communicated to the police&mdash;solved
  the riddle of Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s death. With a sigh of relief
  the police officers adjourned from the mayor&rsquo;s parlour, where they
  had been holding their preliminary inquiries, to the castle, where it was
  their duty to report the occurrence to my lord the Count.</p>
  <p>At the castle of course everyone was greatly surprised: the noble Countess
  raised her aristocratic eyebrows and declared her abhorrence of hearing of
  these horrors. The Count took the opportunity of cursing the peasantry for
  a quarrelsome, worrying lot, and offered the police officers a snack and
  a glass of wine. He was hardly sorry for the loss of his bailiff, as Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la had been rather tiresome of late&mdash;bumptious and none too
  sober&mdash;and his lordship anyhow had resolved to dispense with his services
  after he was married. So the death really caused him very little inconvenience.</p>
  <p>Young Count Feri knew nothing, of course. He was not likely to allow himself
  or his name to be mixed up with a village scandal: he shuddered once or twice
  when the thought flashed through his mind how narrowly he had escaped Er&ouml;s
  B&eacute;la&rsquo;s fate, and to his credit be it said he had every intention
  of showing Lakatos Andor&mdash;who undoubtedly had saved his life by giving
  him timely warning&mdash;a substantial meed of gratitude.</p>
  <p>Of Klara Goldstein little or nothing was seen or heard. The police officers
  had certainly gone to the inn in the course of the morning and had stayed
  there close on half an hour: but as no one had been allowed to go into the
  tap-room during that time, the occurrences there remained a matter of conjecture.
  After the officers went away Klara locked the front door after them and remained
  practically shut up in the house, only going in the evening as far as the
  post, but refusing to speak to anyone and going past with head erect and
  a proud, careless air which deceived no one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll sing her tune in a minor key by and by, when Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein comes home,&rdquo; said the gossips complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those Jews are mighty hard on their daughters,&rdquo; commented the
  older folk, &ldquo;if any scandal falls upon them. Ign&aacute;cz is a hard
  man and over-ready with his stick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; was the universal conclusion, &ldquo;if
  we should hear of another tragedy by and by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In any case, Klara can&rsquo;t stay in the village,&rdquo; decided
  the bevy of young girls who talked the matter over among themselves, and
  were none too sorry that the smart, handsome Jewess&mdash;who had such a
  way with the men&mdash;should be comfortably out of the way.</p>
  <p>But everyone went to the Mass for the dead on the day following that which
  should have been such a merry wedding feast; and everyone joined in the Requiem
  and prayed fervently for the repose of the soul of the murdered man.</p>
  <p>He lay in state in the centre of the aisle, with four tall candles at each
  corner of the draped catafalque; a few bunches of white and purple asters
  clumsily tied together by inexperienced hands were laid upon the coffin.</p>
  <p>Pater Bonif&aacute;cius preached a beautiful sermon about the swift and
  unexpected approach of Death when he is least expected. He also said some
  very nice things about the dead man, and there was hardly a dry eye in the
  church while he spoke.</p>
  <p>In the remote corner of a pew, squeezed between a pillar and her mother,
  Elsa knelt and prayed. Those who watched her&mdash;and there were many&mdash;declared
  that not only did she never stop crying for a moment during Mass, but that
  her eyes were swollen and her cheeks puffy from having cried all the night
  and all the day before.</p>
  <p>After Mass she must have slipped out by the little door which gave on the
  presbytery garden. It was quite close to the pillar against which she had
  been leaning, and no doubt the Pater had given her permission to go out that
  way. From the presbytery garden she could skirt the fields and round the
  top of the village, and thus get home and give all her friends the slip.</p>
  <p>This, no doubt, she had done, for no one saw her the whole of that day,
  nor the next, which was the day of the funeral, and an occasion of wonderful
  pomp and ceremony. B&eacute;la&rsquo;s brother had arrived in the meanwhile
  from Arad, where he was the manager of an important grain store, and he it
  was who gave all directions and all the money necessary that his brother
  should have obsequies befitting his rank and wealth.</p>
  <p>The church was beautifully decorated: there were huge bunches of white flowers
  upon the altar, and eight village lads carried the dead man to his last resting-place;
  and no less than thirty Masses were ordered to be said within the next year
  for the repose of the soul of one who in life had enjoyed so much prosperity
  and consideration.</p>
  <p>And in the tiny graveyard situated among the maize-fields to the north of
  Marosfalva, and which is the local Jewish burial ground, the suicide was
  quietly laid to rest. There was no religious service, for there was no minister
  of his religion present; an undertaker came down from Arad and saw to it
  all; there was no concourse of people, no singing, no flowers. Ign&aacute;cz
  Goldstein&mdash;home the day before from Kecskem&eacute;t&mdash;alone followed
  the plain deal coffin on its lonely journey from the village to the field.</p>
  <p>It was the shop assistant who had seen to it all. He had gone up to Arad
  and seen a married sister of his late master&rsquo;s&mdash;Sara Rosen, whose
  husband kept a second-hand clothes shop there, and who gave full instructions
  to an undertaker whilst declaring herself unable&mdash;owing to delicate
  health&mdash;to attend the funeral herself.</p>
  <p>The undertaker had provided a cart and a couple of oxen and two men to lift
  the coffin in and out. They came late on the Thursday evening, at about eight
  o&rsquo;clock, and drew up at the back of the late Leopold Hirsch&rsquo;s
  shop. No one was about and the night was dark.</p>
  <p>Slowly the cart, creaking on its wheels and axles, wound its way through
  some maize stubble, up a soft, sandy road to the enclosed little bit of ground
  which the local Jews have reserved for themselves.</p>
  <p>And the mysterious veil which divides the present from the past fell quickly
  over this act of the village tragedy, as it had done with pomp and circumstance
  after the banquet which followed the laying to rest of the murdered man.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;Some Day.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>A week went by after the funeral before Elsa saw Andor again. She had not
  purposely avoided him, any more than she had avoided everyone else: but unlike
  most girls of her class and of her nationality she had felt a great desire
  to be alone during the most acute period of this life&rsquo;s crisis through
  which she was passing just now.</p>
  <p>At first on that never-to-be-forgotten morning when she woke to her wedding-day&mdash;her
  white veil and wreath of artificial white roses lying conspicuously on the
  top of the chest of drawers, so that her eyes were bound to alight on them
  the moment they opened&mdash;and saw her mother standing beside her bed,
  dishevelled, pale, and obviously labouring under some terrible excitement,
  she had been conscious as of an awful blow on the head, a physical sensation
  of numbness and of pain.</p>
  <p>Even before she had had time to formulate a question she knew that some
  terrible calamity had occurred. In jerky phrases, broken by moans and interjections,
  the mother had blurted out the news: Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la was dead&mdash;he
  had been found just now&mdash;murdered outside Klara Goldstein&rsquo;s door&mdash;there
  would be no wedding&mdash;Elsa was a widow before she had been a bride. Half
  the village was inclined to believe that Ign&aacute;cz Goldstein had done
  the deed in a moment of angry passion, finding B&eacute;la sneaking round
  his daughter&rsquo;s door when he himself was going away from home&mdash;others
  boldly accused Andor.</p>
  <p>Elsa had said nothing at the time. That same imagined blow on the head had
  also deprived her of the power of speech. Fortunately Irma talked so loudly
  and so long that she paid no attention to her daughter&rsquo;s silence, and
  presently ran out into the village to gather more news.</p>
  <p>And Elsa remained alone in the house, save for the helpless invalid in the
  next room. She washed and dressed herself quickly and mechanically, then
  sat down on her favourite low chair, close beside her crippled father&rsquo;s
  knee, cowering there like some little field mouse, attentive, alert, rigidly
  still, for very fear of what was to come.</p>
  <p>Irma did not come back for two or three hours: when she did it was to bring
  the exciting news that Leopold Hirsch had been found hanging to a beam in
  his back shop, with the knife wherewith he had killed Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la
  lying conspicuously on a table close by.</p>
  <p>Elsa felt as if the weight of the world had been lifted from off her brain.
  All through these hours the thought of Andor having committed such an abominable
  crime never once entered her mind, but nevertheless when her mother told
  the news about Leopold Hirsch, and that the police officers had already left
  the village, she was conscious of an overwhelming sense of relief.</p>
  <p>Fortunately her mother was busy all day gossiping with her cronies and Elsa
  was allowed the luxury of sitting alone most of the day, silent and absorbed,
  doing the usual work of the house in the morning and in the afternoon busying
  herself with carefully putting away the wedding dress, the veil, the wreath
  which would not be wanted now.</p>
  <p>Late in the evening, when there was a chance of finding the street deserted,
  she ran out as far as the presbytery. Fortunately the night was dark: a thin
  drizzle was falling, and it spread a misty veil all down the village street.
  Elsa had tied one of her mother&rsquo;s dark-coloured handkerchiefs over
  her head and put her darkest-coloured petticoat on the top of all the others.
  She had also wrapped her mother&rsquo;s dark shawl round her shoulders, and
  thus muffled up she was able to flit unperceived down the street, a swift
  little dark figure undistinguishable from the surrounding darkness of the
  night.</p>
  <p>Fortunately the Pater was at home and ready to see her. She heaved a sigh
  of relief as she entered the bare narrow little hall which led on the right
  to the Pater&rsquo;s parlour.</p>
  <p>She had been able to tell Pater Bonif&aacute;cius exactly what was troubling
  her&mdash;that sense of peace, almost of relief, which had descended into
  her soul when she heard that she never, never need be Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s
  wife. Since this morning, when first she had heard the terrible news, she
  had not thought of his death&mdash;that awful fate which had so unexpectedly
  overtaken him&mdash;she had only thought of her own freedom, the peace which
  henceforth would be hers.</p>
  <p>That was very wrong of course&mdash;a grievous sin no doubt the Pater would
  call it. She shed many tears of contrition, listened eagerly to a kind homily
  from the old priest on the subject of unnecessary and unprofitable searchings
  of conscience, and went away satisfied.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, after this confession she felt far more sorry for poor
  B&eacute;la than she had done before, and she cried her eyes out both before
  and after the funeral because, do what she would, she always saw him before
  her as he was that last day of his life&mdash;quarrelsome, dictatorial, tyrannical&mdash;and
  she remembered how she had almost hated him for his bullying ways and compared
  him in her mind with Andor&rsquo;s kindness and chivalry.</p>
  <p>And now she cried with remorse because she had hated him during the last
  hours of his life; she cried because he had gone to his death unloved, and
  lay now in his coffin unregretted; she cried because her heart was full and
  heavy and because in the past week&mdash;before her wedding day&mdash;she
  had swallowed so many unshed tears.</p>
  <p>And while she felt miserable and not a little forlorn she didn&rsquo;t want
  to see anybody, least of all Andor. Whenever she thought of Andor, the same
  remorse about B&eacute;la gnawed again at her heart, for when she thought
  of him she not only felt at peace, but it seemed as if a ray of happiness
  illumined the past darkness of her life.</p>
  <p>Once or twice during the last day or two, when she had sat stitching, she
  caught herself singing softly to herself, and once she knew for certain that
  she had smiled.</p>
  <p>Then the day came when Andor called at the house. Irma fortunately was out,
  having coffee and gossip with a friend. No doubt he had watched until he
  was sure that she was well out of the way. Then he knocked at the door and
  entered.</p>
  <p>Elsa was sitting as usual on the low chair close by the sick man. She looked
  up when he entered and all at once the blood rushed to her pale cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; he asked diffidently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you like, Andor,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>He threw down his hat and then came to sit on the corner of the table in
  his favorite attitude and as close to Elsa as he dared. The eyes of the paralytic
  had faintly lit up at his approach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite well, Elsa?&rdquo; he asked after a long pause, during
  which the girl thought that she could hear the beating of her own heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Quite well thank you, Andor,&rdquo; she replied softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one has seen you in the village this past week,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am not very fond of gossip, and there
  was a deal too much of it in Marosfalva this past week to please me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right there, Elsa,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;but there were
  others in the village, you know, those who did not gossip&mdash;but whose
  heart would have been gladdened by a sight of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Andor,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>We may take it that the young man found these laconic answers distinctly
  encouraging, for presently he said abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Elsa, it isn&rsquo;t right for me to begin talking to you
  . . . about certain matters . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What matters, Andor?&rdquo; she asked ingenuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matters which have lain next to my heart, Elsa, for more years now
  than I would care to count.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is a little too soon, Andor&mdash;yet&mdash;&rdquo; she
  whispered under her breath.</p>
  <p>Oh! She could have whipped herself for that warm blush which now covered
  not only her cheeks but her neck and bosom, and for that glow of happiness
  which had rushed straight at her heart at his words. But he had already seen
  the blush, and caught that expression of happiness in her blue eyes which
  suddenly made her look as she did of old&mdash;five years ago&mdash;before
  that wan, pathetic expression of resignation had altered her sweet face so
  completely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to worry you, Elsa,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t worry me, Andor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have
  always been the best friend I had in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is because I have loved you more dearly than anyone ever loved
  you on this earth,&rdquo; he said earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless you for that, Andor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He leaned forward, nearer to her now: his gaze had become more fixed, more
  compelling. Since he had seen that look on her face and that blush he was
  sure of his ground; he knew that, given time and peace, the wheel of fate,
  which had already taken an upward turn for him, would soon carry him to the
  summit of his desires&mdash;the woman whom he loved was no longer unattainable
  and she had remained faithful throughout all this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think, Elsa,&rdquo; he asked more insistently now, and sinking
  his voice to that whisper which reaches a woman&rsquo;s ear far more truly
  than the loudest beating of drum, &ldquo;do you think that, now that you
  are free, you could bring yourself to . . . to care . . . to . . . ? You
  were very fond of me once, Elsa,&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am fond of you now, Andor,&rdquo; she whispered in response. &ldquo;No,
  no,&rdquo; she added hurriedly, for already he had made a movement towards
  her and the next moment would have been down on his knees with his arms around
  her, but for the gently-restraining touch of her hand, &ldquo;it is too soon
  to talk about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;too soon,&rdquo; he assented with enforced calm, even though
  his heart was beating furiously; &ldquo;it is too soon I know, and I won&rsquo;t
  worry you, Elsa&mdash;I said I wouldn&rsquo;t and I won&rsquo;t. . . . I
  am not a cur to come and force myself on you when you are not ready to listen
  to me, and we won&rsquo;t talk about it all . . . not just yet.&rdquo; .
  . .</p>
  <p>His throat felt very dry, and his tongue felt several sizes too large for
  his mouth. It was mightily difficult to keep calm and to speak soberly when
  one&rsquo;s inclination was firstly to dance a war-dance of triumph and of
  joy and then to take that dear, sweet angel of a woman in one&rsquo;s arms
  and to kiss her till she was ready to faint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When do you think I might speak to you again, Elsa?&rdquo; he said,
  with a certain pathetic hesitancy, &ldquo;about . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About what, Andor?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About our getting married&mdash;later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not just yet,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;but . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, of course I understand. There are the proprieties and all
  that . . . you were tokened to that blackguard and . . . Oh! All right, I
  am not going to say anything against him,&rdquo; he added quickly as he saw
  that words of protest and reproach were already hovering on her lips. &ldquo;I
  won&rsquo;t say anything about him at all except that he is dead now and
  buried, thank the good God! . . . And you . . . you still care for me, Elsa,&rdquo; he
  continued, whilst a wave of tenderness seemed to sweep all other thoughts
  away. &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t say anything&mdash;not now&mdash;it is too
  soon, of course&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve just got to wait till the time comes
  as best I can. But you mustn&rsquo;t mind my talking on at random like this
  . . . for I tell you I am nearly crazy with joy&mdash;and I suppose that
  you would think it very wrong to rejoice like this over another man&rsquo;s
  death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His talk was a little wild and rambling&mdash;it was obvious that he was
  half distracted with the prospect of happiness to come. She sat quite still,
  listening silently, with eyes fixed to the ground. Only now and then she
  would look up&mdash;not at Andor, but at the paralytic who was gazing on
  her with the sad eyes of uncomprehension. Then she would nod and smile at
  him and coo in her own motherly way and he would close his eyes&mdash;satisfied.</p>
  <p>And Andor, who had paused for that brief moment in his voluble talk, went
  rambling on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s perfectly wonderful
  . . . this room, I mean . . . when I look round me I can hardly credit my
  eyes. . . . Just a week ago . . . you remember? . . . I sat just there .
  . . at the opposite corner of the table, and you had your low chair against
  the wall just here . . . and . . . and you told me that you were tokened
  to Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la and that your wedding would be on the morrow . .
  . well! That was little more than a week ago . . . before your farewell feast
  . . . and I thought then that never, never could I be happy again because
  you told me that never, never could we be anything to each other except a
  kind of friendly strangers. . . . I remember then how a sort of veil seemed
  to come down in front of my eyes . . . a dark red veil . . . things didn&rsquo;t
  look black to me, you know, Elsa . . . but red. . . . So now I am quite content
  just to bide my time&mdash;I am quite content that you should say nothing
  to me&mdash;nothing <i>good</i>, I mean. . . . It&rsquo;ll take some time
  before the thought of so much happiness has got proper root-hold of my brain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Andor!&rdquo; she sighed, and turned a gaze full of love upon
  the sick man. Her heart was brimming over with it, and so the paralytic got
  the expression of it in its fullest measure, since Andor was not entitled
  to it yet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But just tell me for certain, Elsa . . . so that I shouldn&rsquo;t
  have to torment myself in the meanwhile . . . just tell me for certain that
  one day . . . in the far-distant future if you like, but one day . . . say
  that you will marry me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some day, Andor, I will marry you if God wills,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! But of course He will!&rdquo; he rejoined airily, &ldquo;and
  we will be married in the spring&mdash;or the early summer when the maize
  is just beginning to ripen . . . and we&rsquo;ll rent the mill from Pali
  b&aacute;csi&mdash;shall we, Elsa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you like, Andor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I like!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If I like! The dear God love
  me, but I think that if I stay here much longer I shall go off my head. .
  . . Elsa, you don&rsquo;t know how much I love you and what I would not do
  for your sake. . . . I feel a different man even for the joy of sitting here
  and talking to you and no one having the right to interfere. . . . And I
  would make you happy, Elsa, that I swear by the living God. I would make
  you happy and I would work to keep you in comfort all the days of my life.
  You shall be just as fine as Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la would have made you&mdash;and
  besides that, there would be a smile on your sweet face at every hour of
  the day . . . your hands would be as white as those of my lady the Countess
  herself, for I would have a servant to wait on you. And your father would
  come and live with us and we would make him happy and comfortable too, and
  your mother . . . well! your mother would be happy too, and therefore not
  quite so cantankerous as she sometimes is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To Andor there was nothing ahead but a life full of sunshine. He never looked
  back on the past few days and on the burden of sin which they bore. B&eacute;la
  had been a brute of the most coarse and abominable type; by his monstrous
  conduct on the eve of his wedding day he had walked to his death&mdash;of
  his own accord. Andor had <i>not</i> sent him. Oh! he was quite, quite sure
  that he had not sent B&eacute;la to his death. He had merely forborn to warn
  him&mdash;and surely there could be no sin in that.</p>
  <p>He might have told B&eacute;la that Leopold Hirsch&mdash;half mad with jealousy&mdash;was
  outside on the watch with a hunting-knife in his pocket and murder in his
  soul. Andor might have told B&eacute;la this and he had remained silent.
  Was that a sin? considering what a brute the man was, how his action that
  night was a deadly insult put upon Elsa, and how he would in the future have
  bullied and browbeaten Elsa and made her life a misery&mdash;a veritable
  hell upon earth.</p>
  <p>Andor had thought the problem out; he had weighed it in his mind and he
  was satisfied that he had not really committed a sin. Of course he ought
  before now to have laid the whole case before Pater Bonif&aacute;cius, and
  the Pater would have told him just what God&rsquo;s view would be of the
  whole affair.</p>
  <p>The fact that Andor had not thought of going to confession showed that he
  was not quite sure what God&mdash;as represented by Pater Bonif&aacute;cius&mdash;would
  think of it all; but he meant to go by and by and conclude a permanent and
  fulsome peace treaty with his conscience.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile, even though the burden of remorse should at times in the
  future weigh upon his soul and perhaps spoil a little of his happiness, well!
  he would have to put up with it, and that was all!&mdash;Elsa was happy&mdash;one
  sight of her radiant little face was enough for any fool to see that an infinite
  sense of relief had descended into her soul. Elsa was happy&mdash;freed from
  the brute who would have made her wretched for the rest of her life; and
  surely the good God, who could read the secret motives which lay in a fellow&rsquo;s
  heart, would not be hard on Andor for what he had done&mdash;or left undone&mdash;for
  Elsa&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;Kyrie Eleison.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>But the daily routine of everyday life went on at Marosfalva just as it
  had done before the double tragedy of St. Michael&rsquo;s E&rsquo;en had
  darkened the pages of its simple history.</p>
  <p>The maize had all been gathered in&mdash;ploughing had begun&mdash;my lord
  and his guests were shooting in the stubble. The first torrential rain had
  fallen and the waters of the Maros had begun to swell.</p>
  <p>Gossip about Er&ouml;s B&eacute;la&rsquo;s terrible end and Leopold Hirsch&rsquo;s
  suicide had not by any means been exhausted, but it was supplemented now
  by talk of Lakatos P&aacute;l&rsquo;s wealth. The old man had been ailing
  for some time. His nephew Andor&rsquo;s return had certainly cheered him
  up for a while, but soon after that he seemed to collapse very suddenly in
  health, like old folk do in this part of the world&mdash;stricken down by
  one or other of the several diseases which are engendered by the violent
  extremes of heat and cold&mdash;diseases of the liver for the most part&mdash;the
  beginning of a slowly-oncoming end.</p>
  <p>He had always been reputed to be a miser, and those who were in the know
  now averred that Andor had found several thousand florins tucked away in
  old bits of sacking and hidden under his uncle&rsquo;s straw paillasse. Pali
  b&aacute;csi was also possessed of considerable property&mdash;some land,
  a farm and the mill; there was no doubt now that Andor would be a very rich
  man one of these days.</p>
  <p>Mothers with marriageable daughters sighed nevertheless in vain. Andor was
  not for any of them. Andor had eyes only for Elsa. He had become an important
  man in the village now that his uncle was so ill and he was left to administer
  the old man&rsquo;s property; and he took his duties very earnestly in the
  intervals of courting Kapus Elsa.</p>
  <p>As to this no one had cause to make any objection. They had loved one another
  and been true to one another for five years; it was clearly the will of the
  good God that they should come together at last.</p>
  <p>And now October was drawing to its close&mdash;to-day was the fourth Sunday
  in the month and one of the numerous feasts of our Blessed Lady, one on which
  solemn benediction is appointed to be sung in the early afternoon, and benediction
  is followed by a procession to the shrine of the Virgin which stands on the
  roadside on the way to Sabors&oacute; some two kilom&egrave;tres distant
  from Marosfalva. It is a great festival and one to which the peasantry of
  the countryside look forward with great glee, for they love the procession
  and have a great faith in the efficacy of prayer said at the shrine.</p>
  <p>Fortunately the day turned out to be one of the most glorious sunshiny days
  which mid-autumn can yield, and the little church in the afternoon was crowded
  in every corner. The older women&mdash;their heads covered with dark-coloured
  handkerchiefs, occupied the left side of the aisle, the men crowded in on
  the right and at the back under the organ loft. Round about the chancel rail
  and steps the bevy of girls in gayest Sunday dresses looked like a garden
  of giant animated flowers. When the sexton went the round with the collecting-bag
  tied to the end of a long pole, he had the greatest difficulty in making
  his way through the maze of many-hued petticoats which, as the girls knelt,
  stood all round them like huge bells, with their slim shoulders and small
  heads above looking for all the world like the handles.</p>
  <p>The children were all placed in the chancel to right and left of the altar,
  solemn and well-behaved, with one eye on the schoolmistress and the other
  on the Pater.</p>
  <p>After the service the order of procession was formed, inside the church:
  the children in the forefront with banner carried by the head of the school&mdash;a
  sturdy maiden on the fringe of her teens, very proud to carry the Blessed
  Virgin&rsquo;s banner. She squared her shoulders well, for the banner was
  heavy, and the line of her young hips&mdash;well accentuated by the numerous
  petticoats which a proud mother had tied round her waist&mdash;gave a certain
  dignity to her carriage and natural grace to her movements.</p>
  <p>Behind the children came the young girls&mdash;those of a marriageable age
  whom a pious custom dedicates most specially to the service of Our Lady.
  Their banner was of blue silk, and most of them were dressed in blue, whilst
  blue ribbons fluttered round their heads as they walked.</p>
  <p>Then came Pater Bonif&aacute;cius under a velvet-covered dais which was
  carried by four village lads. He wore his vestments and carried a holy relic
  in his hands; the choir-boys swinging their metal censers were in front of
  him in well-worn red cassocks and surplices beautifully ironed and starched
  for the occasion.</p>
  <p>In the rear the crowd rapidly closed in; the younger men had a banner to
  themselves, and there were the young matrons, the mothers, the fathers, the
  old and the lonely.</p>
  <p>The sexton threw open the doors, and slowly the little procession filed
  out. Outside a brilliant sunshine struck full on the whitewashed walls of
  the little schoolhouse opposite. It was so dazzling that it made everybody
  blink as they stepped out from the semi-dark church into this magnificent
  flood of light.</p>
  <p>In the street round the church a pathetic group awaited the appearance of
  the procession, those that were too old to walk two kilom&egrave;tres to
  the shrine, those who were lame and those who were sick. Simply and with
  uninquiring minds, they knelt or stood in the roadway, content to watch the
  banners as they swung gaily to the rhythmic movements of the bearers, content
  to see the holy relics in the Pater&rsquo;s hand, content to feel that subtle
  wave of religious sentiment pass over them which made them at peace with
  their little world and brought the existence of God nearer to their comprehension.</p>
  <p>Slowly the procession wound its way down the village street. Pater Bonif&aacute;cius
  had intoned the opening orisons of the Litany:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kyrie eleison!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And men and women chanted the response in that quaintly harsh tone which
  the Magyar language assumes when it is sung. The brilliant sunlight played
  on the smooth hair of the girls, the golds, the browns and the blacks, and
  threw sharp glints on the fluttering ribbons of many colours which a light
  autumn breeze was causing to dance gaily and restlessly. The whole village
  was hushed save for the Litany, the clinking of the metal chains as the choir-boys
  swung the censers and the frou-frou of hundreds of starched petticoats&mdash;superposed,
  brushing one against the other with a ceaseless movement which produced a
  riot of brilliant colouring.</p>
  <p>Soon the main road was reached, and now the vast immensity of the plain
  lay in front and all round&mdash;all the more vast and immense now it seemed,
  since not even the nodding plumes of maize or tall, stately sunflowers veiled
  the mystery of that low-lying horizon far away.</p>
  <p>Nothing around now, save that group of willow trees by the bank of the turbulent
  Maros&mdash;nothing except the stubble&mdash;stumps of maize and pumpkin
  and hemp, and rigid lines of broken-down stems of sunflowers, with drooping,
  dead leaves, and brown life still oozing out of the torn stems.</p>
  <p>And in the immensity, the sweet, many-toned sounds of summer&mdash;the call
  of birds, the quiver of growing things, the trembling of ripening corn&mdash;has
  yielded to the sad tune of autumn&mdash;a tune made up of the hushed sighs
  of dying nature, as she sinks slowly and peacefully into her coming winter&rsquo;s
  sleep. The swallows and the storks have gone away long ago. They know that
  in this land of excessive heat and winter rigours, frost and snow tread hard
  on the heels of a warm, autumnal day. Only a flight of rooks breaks the even
  line of the sky; their cawing alone makes at times a weird accompaniment
  to the chanting of the Litany. And the Maros&mdash;no longer sluggish&mdash;now
  sends her swollen waters with a dull, rumbling sound westward to the arms
  of the mother stream.</p>
  <p>Silence and emptiness!</p>
  <p>Nothing except the sky, with its unending panorama of ever-varying clouds,
  and its infinite, boundless, mysterious horizon, which enfolds the world
  of the plains in a limitless embrace. Nothing except the stubble and the
  sky, and far, very far away, a lonely cottage, with its surrounding group
  of low, mop-head acacias, and the gaunt, straight arm of a well pointing
  upwards to the sun.</p>
  <p>And through the silent, vast immensity the little procession of village
  folk, with banners flying and quaint, harsh voices singing the Litany, winds
  its way along the flat, sandy road, like a brightly-coloured ribbon thrown
  there by a giant hand, and made to flutter and to move by a giant&rsquo;s
  breath.</p>
  <p>Presently the shrine came in sight: just a dark speck at first in the midst
  of the great loneliness, then more and more distinct&mdash;there on the roadside&mdash;all
  by itself without a tree near it&mdash;lonely in the bosom of the plain.</p>
  <p>The procession came to a halt in front of it, and two hundred pairs of eyes,
  brimful with simple faith and simple trust, gazed in reverence on the na&iuml;ve
  wax figure behind the grating, within its throne of rough stone and whitewash.
  It was dressed in blue calico spangled with tinsel, and had a crown on its
  head made of gilt paper and a veil of coarse tarlatan. Two china pots containing
  artificial flowers were placed on either side of the little image.</p>
  <p>It was all very crude, very rough, very na&iuml;ve, but a fervent, unsophisticated
  imagination had endowed it with a beauty all the more real, perhaps, because
  it only existed in the hearts of a handful of ignorant children of the soil.
  It made Something seem real to them which otherwise might have been difficult
  to grasp; and now when Pater Bonif&aacute;cius in his gentle, cracked voice
  intoned the invocations of the Litany, the &ldquo;Salus infirmorum&rdquo; and &ldquo;Refugium
  peccatorum&rdquo; and, above all, the &ldquo;Consolatrix afflictorum&rdquo; the
  response &ldquo;Ora pro nobis&rdquo; came from two hundred trusting hearts&mdash;praying,
  if not for themselves, then for those who were dear to them: the infirm,
  the sinner, the afflicted.</p>
  <p>And among those two hundred hearts none felt the need for prayer more than
  Andor and Elsa. They had left affliction behind them, they stood upon the
  threshold of a new life&mdash;where happiness alone beckoned to them, and
  sorrow and parting lay vanquished behind the gates of the past. But in spite,
  or perhaps because, of this happiness which beckoned so near now, there was
  a tinge of sadness in their hearts, that sadness which always comes with
  joy once extreme youth has gone by . . . the sadness which hovers over finite
  things, the sense of future which so quickly becomes the past.</p>
  <p>From where Andor stood, holding the dais above Pater Bonif&aacute;cius&rsquo; head,
  he could see Elsa&rsquo;s smooth, fair head among the crowd of other girls.
  She had tied her hair in at the nape of the neck with a bit of blue ribbon,
  leaving it to fall lower down in two thick plaits well below her waist. She
  looked like a huge blue gentian kissed by the sun, for her top petticoat
  was of blue cotton, and her golden head seemed like the sweet-scented stamen.</p>
  <p>Andor thought that he could hear her voice above that of everyone else,
  and when Pater Bonif&aacute;cius intoned the &ldquo;Regina angelorum&rdquo; he
  thought that indeed the heavenly Queen had no fairer subject up there than
  Elsa.</p>
  <p>When the little procession was once more ready to return to the village,
  the bearers of the dais were relieved by four other lads, and Andor found
  the means, during the slight hubbub which occurred while the procession was
  being formed, of working his way close to Elsa&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>It was not an unusual thing for young men and girls who had much to say
  to one another to fall away from the procession on its way home, and to wander
  back arm in arm through the maize-fields or over the stubble, even as their
  shadows lengthened out upon the ground.</p>
  <p>Andor&rsquo;s hand had caught hold of Elsa&rsquo;s elbow, and with insistent
  pressure he kept her out of the group of her companions. Gradually the procession
  was formed, and slowly it began to move, the banners fluttered once more
  in the breeze, once more the monotonous chant broke the silence of the plain.</p>
  <p>But Elsa and Andor had remained behind close beside the shrine. She had
  yielded to his insistence, knowing what it was that he meant to say to her
  while they walked together toward the sunset. She knew what he wanted to
  say, and what he expected her to promise, and he knew that at last she was
  ready to listen, and that she would no longer hold her heart in check, but
  let it flow over with all the love which it contained, and that she was ready
  at last to hold up to him that cup of happiness for which he craved.</p>
  <p>One or two couples had also remained behind, but they had already wandered
  off toward the bank of the Maros. Elsa had knelt down before the crude image
  of the &ldquo;Consoler of the afflicted;&rdquo; her rosary was wound round
  her fingers, she prayed in her simple soul, fervently, unquestioningly, for
  happiness and for peace.</p>
  <p>Then, when the little procession in the distance became wrapped in the golden
  haze which hung over the plain, and the chanting of the Litany came but as
  a murmur on the wings of the autumn breeze, she took Andor&rsquo;s arm, and
  together they walked slowly back toward home.</p>
  <p>The peace which rests over the plain enveloped them both; from the sky above
  the last vestige of cloud had been driven away by the breeze, and far away
  on that distant horizon where lay the land of the unknown the sun was slowly
  sinking to rest.</p>
  <p>Like a huge, drooping rose it seemed&mdash;its rays like petals falling
  away from it one by one. Mute yet quivering was the plain around, pulsating
  with life, yet silent in its autumnal agony. From far away came the sweet
  sound of the evening Angelus rung from the village church&mdash;distant and
  soft, like a sound from heaven or like an echo of some beautiful dream.</p>
  <p>And these two were alone with the sunset and with the stubble&mdash;alone
  in this vastness which is so like the sea&mdash;alone&mdash;two tiny, moving
  black specks with a background of radiance and a golden haze to envelop them.
  In this immensity it seemed so much more easy to speak of love&mdash;for
  love could fill the plain and find room for its own immensity in this vastness
  which knows no trammels. To Andor and Elsa it seemed as if at last the plain
  had revealed its secret to them, had lifted for them that veil of mystery
  which wraps her up all round where earth and sky meet in the golden distance
  beyond.</p>
  <p>They knew suddenly just what lay behind the veil, they knew if it were lifted
  what it was that they would see&mdash;the land of gold was the land of love,
  where men and women wandered hand in hand, where sorrow was a dwarf and grief
  a cripple, since love&mdash;the Almighty King of the unknown land&mdash;had
  wounded them and vanquished them both.</p>
  <p>And they, too, now wandered toward that land, even though it still seemed
  very far away. To the accompaniment of the Angelus bell they wandered, with
  the distant echo of the chanted Litany still ringing in their ear. The plain
  encompassed her children with her all-embracing peace, and she gave them
  this one supreme moment of happiness to-day, while the setting sun clothed
  the horizon with gold.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;What About Me.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>And time slipped by with murmurings of words that have no meaning save for
  one pair of ears. Andor talked fondly and foolishly, and Elsa mostly was
  silent. She had loved this walk over the stubble, and the plain had been
  in perfect peace save for the rumbling of the Maros, insistent and menacing,
  which had struck a chill to the girl&rsquo;s heart, like a presage of evil.</p>
  <p>She tried to swallow her fears, chiding herself for feeling them, doing
  her best to close her ears to those rumbling, turbulent waters that seemed
  to threaten as they tumbled along on their way.</p>
  <p>Gradually as they neared the village that curious feeling of impending evil
  became more strong: she could not help speaking of it to Andor, but he only
  laughed in that delightfully happy&mdash;almost defiantly happy&mdash;way
  of his, and for a moment or two she was satisfied.</p>
  <p>But when at about half a kilom&egrave;tre from home she caught sight of
  Klara Goldstein walking away from the village straight toward her and Andor,
  it seemed as if her fears had suddenly assumed a more tangible shape.</p>
  <p>Klara looked old and thin, she thought, pathetic, too, in her plain black
  dress&mdash;she who used to be so fond of pretty clothes. Elsa gave her a
  hearty greeting as soon as she was near enough to her, and extended a cordial
  hand. She had no cause to feel well-disposed toward the Jewess, but there
  was something so forlorn-looking about the girl now, and such a look of sullen
  despair in her dark eyes, that Elsa&rsquo;s gentle nature was at once ready
  to forgive and to cheer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a long time since I have seen you, Klara,&rdquo; she said pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; said the other girl, with a shrug of her thin shoulders, &ldquo;father
  won&rsquo;t let me out of his sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had nodded to Andor, but by tacit consent they had not shaken hands.
  Klara now put her hands on her hips, and, like a young animal let free after
  days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said with a sigh, &ldquo;it is good to be out again;
  being a prisoner doesn&rsquo;t suit me, I can tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your dear father seems to be very severe with you, Klara,&rdquo; said
  Elsa compassionately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! curse him!&rdquo; retorted the Jewess fiercely, as a savage,
  cruel look flashed through her sunken eyes. &ldquo;He nearly killed me when
  he came home from Kecskem&eacute;t that time&mdash;beat me like a dog&mdash;and
  now . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Klara!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have minded the beating so much. Among our people,
  parents have the right to be severe, and it is better to take a beating from
  your father than to be punished by the rabbi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your dear father will forgive you in time,&rdquo; suggested Elsa
  gently.</p>
  <p>She felt miserably uncomfortable, and would have given worlds to be rid
  of Klara. She couldn&rsquo;t think why the girl had stopped to talk to her
  and Andor: in fact she was more than sure that Klara had come out this evening
  on purpose to talk to her and to Andor; for now she stood deliberately in
  front of them both with arms crossed in front of her and defiant eyes fixed
  now upon one and now upon the other. Andor too was beginning to look cross
  and sullen; this meeting coming on the top of that lovely walk seemed like
  a black shadow cast over the radiance of their happiness, and this thin,
  tall girl, all in black, with black hair fluttering round her pale face,
  seemed like a big black bird of evil presage: her skirts flapped round her
  knees like wings and her voice sounded cold and harsh like the croaking of
  a raven.</p>
  <p>But Elsa&rsquo;s kindly disposition did not allow her to be too obviously
  unkind to the Jewess. Perhaps after all the girl meant no harm, and had only
  run out now like a released colt, glad to feel freedom in the air around
  her and the vastness lying stretched out before her to infinity beyond. Perhaps
  she had only sought the company of the first-comers in order to get a small
  measure of sympathy. But now, though Elsa&rsquo;s gentle words should have
  softened her mood, she retorted with renewed fierceness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse him! I don&rsquo;t want his forgiveness! and if ever he wants
  mine&mdash;on his deathbed&mdash;he won&rsquo;t get it&mdash;even if he should
  die in torment for want of a kind word from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Klara, you mustn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; cried Elsa, horrified at
  what she considered almost blasphemy. &ldquo;Your father is your father,
  remember&mdash;and even if he has been harsh to you . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Klara interrupted her with a loud and strident laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he has been harsh to me!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
  I tell you that he thrashed me like a dog, so that I was sick for days. But
  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that so much. Bruises mend sooner or later, but it&rsquo;s
  that abominable marriage which will make me curse him to my dying day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marriage? . . . what marriage? . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With a man I had never seen in my life until it was all settled.
  Just a man who is so ugly and so bad-tempered and so repugnant to every girl
  whom he knows that nobody would have him&mdash;but just a man who wanted
  a wife. The rabbi at Arad knew about him and he spoke about him to father&mdash;it
  seems that he is quite rich&mdash;and father has given me to him and I am
  to be married within a fortnight. Curse them! curse them all, I say! Oh!
  I wish I had the pluck to run away, or to kill myself or do something&mdash;but
  I am such an abominable coward&mdash;and I shall loathe to live in Arad in
  a tiny secondhand clothes shop, with that hideous monster for a husband&mdash;pointed
  at by everyone as the girl with a disgraceful story to her credit and sold
  to a creature whom no one else would have&mdash;in order to cover up a scandal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Elsa was silent; her heart now was full of pity for the girl, who indeed
  was being punished far more severely than she deserved. It was clear that
  Klara was terribly resentful at her fate, and there was a look of vengeful
  rebellion in the glance which she threw on Elsa and Andor now.</p>
  <p>Overhead there was flapping of wings&mdash;a flight of rooks cut through
  the air and there were magpies in their trail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three for a wedding,&rdquo; said Andor with a forced laugh, trying
  to break the spell which&mdash;much against his will&mdash;seemed to have
  been suddenly cast over his happy spirits.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One for sorrow, more like,&rdquo; retorted Klara.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, come!&rdquo; he rejoined; &ldquo;you must not look at it
  like that. There is always some happiness to be got out of married life.
  You are not very happy in your old home&mdash;you will like to have one of
  your own&mdash;a wedding is only the prelude to better things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That depends on the wedding, my friend,&rdquo; she sneered; &rdquo;this
  one will be a finish, not a prelude&mdash;the naughty child, well whipped,
  sent out of mischief&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Klara, that you feel it so strongly,&rdquo; he said more
  kindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I dare say, my good man, you are
  sorry enough for me now, but you might have thought of all that, you know,
  before you played me that dirty trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he broke in quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and no more. A dirty,
  abominable trick, I call it, and I cannot even show you up before the village&mdash;I
  could not even speak of you to the police officers. Oh, yes!&rdquo; she continued
  more and more vehemently, as a flood of wrath and of resentment and a burning
  desire for getting even with Fate seemed literally to sweep her off her mental
  balance and cause her to lose complete control of her tongue, &ldquo;oh,
  yes! my fine gentleman! you can go and court Elsa now, and whisper sweet
  love-words in her ears&mdash;you two turtle-doves are the edification of
  the entire village now&mdash;and presently you will get married and live
  happy ever afterwards. But what I want to ask you, my friend,&rdquo; she
  added, and she took a step or two nearer to him, until her hot and angry
  breath struck him in the face and he was forced to draw himself back, away
  from that seething cauldron of resentment and of vengeance which was raging
  before him now, &ldquo;what I want to ask you is have you ever thought of
  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thought of you, Klara?&rdquo; he said quietly, even as he felt, more
  than saw, that Elsa too had drawn back a little&mdash;a step or two further
  away from Klara, but a step or two also further away from him. &ldquo;Thought
  of you?&rdquo; he reiterated, seeing that Klara did not reply immediately,
  and that just for one brief moment&mdash;it was a mere flash&mdash;a look
  of irresolution had crept into her eyes, &ldquo;why should I be thinking
  about you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo; she said with a wrathful sneer. &ldquo;What hurt
  had I done to you, Andor, that is what I want to know. I was always friendly
  to you. I had never done you any wrong&mdash;nor did I do Elsa any wrong&mdash;any
  wrong, I mean, that mattered,&rdquo; she continued, talking more loudly
  and more volubly because Andor was making desperate efforts to stop and interrupt
  her. &ldquo;B&eacute;la would only have run after another woman if I had
  turned my back on him. And then when you asked me to leave him alone, I promised,
  didn&rsquo;t I? What you asked me to do I promised. . . . And I meant to
  keep my promise to you, and you knew it . . . and yet you rounded on me like
  that. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, Klara,&rdquo; he cried at the top of his voice as he shook
  the girl roughly by the shoulder.</p>
  <p>But she paid no heed to him&mdash;she was determined to be heard, determined
  to have her say. All the bitterness in her had been bottled up for weeks.
  She meant to meet Andor face to face before she was packed off as the submissive
  wife of a hated husband&mdash;the naughty child, whipped and sent out of
  the way&mdash;she meant to throw all the pent-up bitterness within her, straight
  into his face&mdash;and meant to do it when Elsa was nigh. For days and days
  she had watched for an opportunity; but her father had kept her a prisoner
  in the house, besides which she had no great desire to affront the sneering
  looks of village gossips. But this evening was her opportunity. For this
  she had waited, and now she meant to take it, and no power on earth, force
  or violence would prevent her from pouring out the full phial of her venomous
  wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will not be silent,&rdquo; she shrieked, &ldquo;I will not! You
  did round on me like a cur&mdash;you sneak&mdash;you double-faced devil.
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you be silent!&rdquo; he hissed through his teeth, his face
  deadly pale now with a passion of wrath at least as fierce as hers.</p>
  <p>But now Elsa&rsquo;s quiet voice interposed between these two tempestuous
  souls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;Klara shall not be silent, Andor.
  Let go her arm and let her speak. I want to hear what she has to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is trying to come between you and me, Elsa,&rdquo; said Andor,
  who was trying to keep his violent rage in check. &ldquo;She tried to come
  between you and B&eacute;la, and chose an ugly method to get at what she
  wanted. She hates you . . . why I don&rsquo;t know, but she does hate you,
  and she always tries to do you harm. Don&rsquo;t listen to her, I tell you.
  Why! just look at her now! . . . the girl is half mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mad?&rdquo; broke in Klara, as with a jerky movement of her shoulders
  she disengaged herself from Andor&rsquo;s rough grasp. &ldquo;I dare say
  I am mad. And so would you be,&rdquo; she added, turning suddenly to Elsa, &ldquo;so
  would you be, if all in one night you were to lose everything you cared for
  in the world&mdash;your freedom&mdash;the consideration of your friends&mdash;the
  man who some day would have made you a good husband&mdash;everything, everything&mdash;and
  all because of that sneaking, double-faced coward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t hold your tongue . . .&rdquo; cried Andor menacingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will kill me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she sneered. &ldquo;One
  murder more or less on your conscience won&rsquo;t hurt you any more, will
  it, my friend? You will kill me, eh? Then you&rsquo;ll have two of us to
  your reckoning by and by, me and B&eacute;la!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&eacute;la!&rdquo; the cry, which sounded like a protest&mdash;hot,
  indignant, defensive&mdash;came from Elsa. She was paler than either of the
  others, and her glowing, inquiring eyes were fixed upon Klara with the look
  of an untamed creature ready to defend and to protect the thing that it holds
  dear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to her, Elsa,&rdquo; pleaded Andor in a voice
  rendered hoarse with an overwhelming apprehension.</p>
  <p>He felt as if his happiness, his life, the whole of this living, breathing
  world were slipping away from him&mdash;as if he had suddenly woke up from
  a beautiful, peaceful dream and found himself on the edge of a precipice
  and unable, in this sudden rude awakening, to keep a foothold upon the shifting
  sands. There was a mist before his eyes&mdash;a mist which seemed to envelop
  Elsa more and more, making her slim, exquisite figure appear more dim, blurring
  the outline of her gold-crowned head, getting more and more dense until even
  her blue eyes had disappeared away from him&mdash;away&mdash;snatched from
  his grasp&mdash;wafted away by that mist to the distant land beyond the low-lying
  horizon.</p>
  <p>Something in the agony of his appeal, something in the pathos of Elsa&rsquo;s
  defiant attitude must have struck a more gentle cord in the Jewess&rsquo; heart.
  The tears gathered in her eyes&mdash;tears of self-pity at the misery which
  she seemed to be strewing all round her with a free hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I really meant to tell you, Elsa,&rdquo; she
  said more quietly, &ldquo;not lately, at any rate. Oh, I dare say at first
  I did mean to hurt you&mdash;but a month has gone by and I was beginning
  to forget. People used to say of me that I was a good sort&mdash;it was the
  hurt that <i>he</i> did me that seems to have made a devil of me. . . . And
  then&mdash;just now when I saw the other folk coming home in the procession
  and noticed that you and Andor weren&rsquo;t among them, I guessed that you
  would be walking back together arm-in-arm&mdash;and that the whole world
  would be smiling on you both, while I was eating out my heart in misery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was speaking with apparent calm now, in a dull and monotonous voice,
  her eyes fixed upon the distant line of the horizon, where the glowing sun
  had at last sunk to rest. The brilliant orange and blood-red of the sky had
  yielded to a colder crimson tint&mdash;it, too, was now slowly turning to
  grey.</p>
  <p>Elsa stood silent, listening, and Andor no longer tried to force Klara to
  silence. What was the good? Fate had spoken through her lips&mdash;God&rsquo;s
  wrath, perhaps, had willed it so. For the first time in all these weeks he
  realized that perhaps he had committed a deadly sin, and that he had had
  no right to reckon on happiness coming to him, because of it. He stood there,
  dazed, letting the Jewess have her way. What did it matter how much more
  she said? Perhaps, on the whole, it was best that Elsa should learn the whole
  truth now.</p>
  <p>And Klara continued to speak in listless, apathetic tones, letting her tongue
  run on as if she had lost control over what she said, and as if a higher
  Fate was forcing her to speak against her will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, &ldquo;that some kind of
  devil did get into my bones then. I wandered out into the stubble, and I
  saw you together coming from the distance. The sunlight was full upon you,
  and long before you saw me I saw your faces quite distinctly. There was so
  much joy, so much happiness in you both, that I seemed to see it shining
  out of your eyes. And I was so broken and so wretched that I couldn&rsquo;t
  bear to see Andor so happy with the girl who rightly belonged to B&eacute;la&mdash;the
  wretched man whom he himself had sent to his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom he himself had sent to his death?&rdquo; broke in Elsa quietly. &ldquo;What
  do you mean, Klara?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that it was young Count Feri who was to have come to see me
  that night. Father being away, he wanted to come and have a little chat and
  a bit of supper with me. There was no harm in that, was there? He didn&rsquo;t
  care to be seen walking in at the front door&mdash;as there&rsquo;s always
  such a lot of gossip in this village&mdash;so he asked me for the back-door
  key, and I gave it to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leopold missed the key later on, and guessed I had given it to Count
  Feri. He was mad with jealousy and threatened to kill anyone who dared come
  sneaking in round the back way. He wouldn&rsquo;t let me out of his sight&mdash;and
  threatened to strangle me if I attempted to go and get the key back from
  Count Feri. I was nearly crazy with fear. Wouldn&rsquo;t you have been,&rdquo; she
  added defiantly, &ldquo;if you had a madman to deal with and no one near
  to protect you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Elsa, under her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Andor came into the tap-room. With soft words and insinuating
  promises he got me to tell him what had happened. I didn&rsquo;t want to
  at first&mdash;I mistrusted him because of what had happened at the banquet&mdash;I
  knew that he hated me because of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; broke in Andor involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let her tell her story her own way,&rdquo; rejoined Elsa, with the
  same strange quiet which seemed now to envelop her soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more to tell,&rdquo; retorted Klara. &ldquo;Nothing,
  at any rate, that you haven&rsquo;t guessed already. I told Andor all about
  Count Feri and the key, and how terrified I was that Leopold would do some
  deadly mischief. He offered to go to the castle and get the key away from
  the young Count.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! Andor was in love with you, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she continued,
  speaking once more with vehemence; &ldquo;he wanted you, didn&rsquo;t he?
  And he hated B&eacute;la having you. He hated me, too, of course. So he got
  the key away from Count Feri, and later on, after you had followed B&eacute;la
  almost to the tap-room and you had some words with him just outside . . .
  you remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor had the key in his pocket then&mdash;and he gave it to B&eacute;la.
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence for awhile now&mdash;that silence which falls upon the
  plain during the first hour after sunset&mdash;and which falls upon human
  creatures when destiny has spoken her last word. In the village far away
  the worshippers had gone back into the church, all sound of chanting and
  praying had died away behind its walls; there was no flight of birds overhead,
  nor call of waterfowl from the bank of the stream, the autumn breeze had
  gone to rest with the sun, the leaves of acacias and willows lay still, and
  even the turbulent waters of the Maros seemed momentarily hushed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that true, Andor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Elsa&rsquo;s voice that spoke, but the voice sounded muffled and
  dull, as if it came from far away or from out the depths of the earth. Then,
  as Andor made no reply, but gazed on Elsa in mute and passionate appeal,
  like a man who is drowning would gaze on the shore which he cannot reach,
  Klara said slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s true enough. You cannot deny it, can you, Andor? You
  wanted your revenge on me, and you wanted to be rid of B&eacute;la&mdash;you
  wanted Elsa for yourself, but you didn&rsquo;t care one brass fill&eacute;r
  what would become of me after that. You left me without a thought, lonely
  and unprotected, knowing that a madman was prowling outside, ready to kill
  me or any man who came along. You gave B&eacute;la that key, didn&rsquo;t
  you? . . . and told him nothing about Leopold&mdash;and you didn&rsquo;t
  care what became of me, so long as you got rid of B&eacute;la and could have
  Elsa for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now you have had your say, Klara,&rdquo; said Andor, breaking
  with a mighty effort the spell of silence which had held him all this while; &ldquo;you
  have made all the mischief that you wanted to make. Suppose you leave us
  alone now . . . Elsa and me . . . alone with the misery which you have created
  for us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as for a moment she didn&rsquo;t move, but looked on him through narrowed
  lids and with a sneer, half of pity and half of triumph, he continued with
  a sudden outburst of fierceness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! you have had your say! . . . Why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Klara shrugged her shoulders and said more lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, my friend, I&rsquo;ll go. . . . Good-bye, Elsa,&rdquo; she
  added, with sudden earnestness. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose that you want
  to shake hands with me&mdash;and I dare say it&rsquo;s no use asking you
  to think kindly of me&mdash;but I wish you would try and believe that I am
  sorry I lost myself as I did. I don&rsquo;t think that I ever would have
  told you if I hadn&rsquo;t seen <i>him</i> looking so happy and so complacent
  after the horrible, dirty trick which he played me. People used to say that
  I had a good heart, but, by the Almighty, I declare that I seem to have lost
  my head lately. That&rsquo;s what I say, Elsa. It&rsquo;s all very well,
  but what about me? What had I done?&mdash;and now, look at my life! But don&rsquo;t
  you fret about him or any other man. Take my word for it, men are not worth
  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And having said that she turned on her heel and slowly walked away, leaving
  behind her an ocean of desolation. She walked away&mdash;with a slow, swinging
  stride, one hand on her hip, her head thrown back.</p>
  <p>For a long time her darkly-clad figure was silhouetted against the evening
  sky, a speck of blackness upon the immensity around. Elsa watched her go,
  watched that tiny black speck which, like the locust which at times devastates
  the plains, had left behind it an irreparable trail of misery.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
 </b><b>&ldquo;The Land Beyond The Sunset.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>And now the shadows of evening were slowly invading the plains. The autumn
  wind, lulled for a time to rest with the setting of the sun, had sprung up
  in angry gusts, lashing up clouds from the southwest and sending them to
  tear along and efface the last vestige of the evening crimson glow.</p>
  <p>Elsa and Andor had both remained quite still after Klara left them; yet
  Elsa&mdash;like all simple creatures who feel acutely&mdash;was longing to
  run and let the far horizon, the distant unknown land, wrap and enfold her
  while she thought things out for herself, for indeed this real world&mdash;the
  world of men and women, of passions and hatred and love&mdash;was nothing
  but a huge and cruel puzzle. She longed for solitude&mdash;the solitude which
  the plains can offer in such absolute completeness&mdash;because her heart
  was heavy and she felt that if she were all alone she might ease the weight
  on her heart in a comforting flow of tears.</p>
  <p>But this would not have been kind to Andor. She could not leave him now,
  when he looked so broken down with sorrow and misery and doubt. So, after
  a little while, when she felt that if she spoke her voice would be quite
  steady, she said gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not all true, is it, Andor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could not&mdash;she would not believe it all true&mdash;not in the way
  that Klara had put it before her, with all its horrible details of callousness
  and cowardice. For more years than she could remember she had loved and trusted
  Andor&mdash;she had known his simple, loyal nature, his kind and gentle ways&mdash;a
  few spiteful words from a jealous woman were not likely to tear down in a
  moment the solid edifice of her affection and her confidence. True! his silence
  had told her something that was a bitter truth; his passionate rage against
  Klara had been like a cruel stab right into her heart&mdash;but even then
  she wanted the confirmation which could only come from his own lips&mdash;and
  for this she waited when she asked him, quite simply, altogether trustingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not true, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nor did it occur to Andor to lie to her about it all; the thought of denial
  never for one moment entered his head. The fatalism peculiar to this Oriental
  race made the man scorn to shield himself behind a lie. B&eacute;la was now
  for ever silent; the young Count would scorn to speak! His own protestations
  in the ear of this loving, simple-minded girl, against the accusations of
  a woman of the despised race&mdash;jealous, bitter, avowedly half-crazy&mdash;needed
  only to be uttered in order to be whole-heartedly believed. But even the
  temptation to pursue such a course never assailed his soul. With the limitless
  sky above him, the vast immensity of the plains stretching out unbroken far
  away, with the land under his feet and the scent of the maize-stubble in
  his nostrils, he was too proud of himself as a man to stoop to such a lie.</p>
  <p>So when Elsa spoke to him and asked him that one straight and firm question,
  he raised his head and looked straight into her tear-dimmed eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What, Elsa?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you let B&eacute;la go to his death&mdash;just like that&mdash;as
  Klara said . . . that is not all true, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as she returned his look&mdash;fearlessly and trustfully&mdash;she knew
  that the question which she had thus put to him was really an affirmation
  of what she felt must be the truth. But already Andor had raised his voice
  in hot and passionate protest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was a brute to you, Elsa,&rdquo; he affirmed with all the strength
  of his manhood, the power of his love, which, in spite of all, would not
  believe in its own misery; &ldquo;he would have made you wretchedly unhappy
  . . . he . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did do it, then?&rdquo; she broke in quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did it because of you, Elsa,&rdquo; he cried, and his own firm
  voice was now half-choked with sobs. &ldquo;He made you unhappy even though
  you were not yet bound to him by marriage. Once you were his wife he would
  have made you miserable . . . he would have bullied you . . . beaten you,
  perhaps. I heard him out under the verandah speaking to you like the sneering
  brute that he was. . . . And then he kissed you . . . and I . . . But even
  then I didn&rsquo;t give him the key. . . . Klara lied when she said that.
  I didn&rsquo;t urge him to take it, even&mdash;I did not speak about the
  key. It was lying on the table where I had put it&mdash;he took it up&mdash;I
  did not give it him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you let him take it. You knew that he meant to visit Klara, and
  that Leopold was on the watch outside. Yet you let him go. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I let him go. . . . I was nearly mad then with rage at the way he
  had treated you all day. . . . His taking that key was a last insult put
  upon you on the eve of your wedding day. . . . The thought of it got into
  my blood like fire, when I saw his cruel leer and heard his sneers. . . .
  Later on, I thought better of it . . . calmer thoughts had got into my brain
  . . . reason, sober sense. . . . I had gone back to the presbytery, and meant
  to go to bed&mdash;I went out, I swear it by God that I went out prepared
  to warn him, to help him if I could. The whole village was deserted, it was
  the hour of supper at the barn. I heard the church clock strike the half-hour
  after ten. I worked my way round to the back of Goldstein&rsquo;s house and
  in the yard I saw B&eacute;la lying&mdash;dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you might have raised a finger to save him at first . . . and
  you didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at first . . . and after that it was too late. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have done a big, big wrong, Andor,&rdquo; she said slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; he cried, whilst once more the old spirit of defiance
  fired him&mdash;the burning love in him, the wrath at seeing her unhappy. &ldquo;Wrong?
  Because I did not prevent one miserable brute being put out of the way of
  doing further harm? By the living God, Elsa, I do not believe that it was
  wrong. I didn&rsquo;t send him to his death, I did not see or speak to Leopold
  Hirsch, I merely let Fate or God Himself work His way with him. I did not
  say a word to him that might have induced him to take that key. He picked
  it up from the table, and every evil thought came into his head then and
  there. He didn&rsquo;t even care about Klara and a silly, swaggering flirtation
  with her, he only wanted to insult you, to shame you, to show you that he
  was the master&mdash;and meant to have his way in all things. . . . And this
  he did because&mdash;bar his pride in your beauty&mdash;he really hated you
  and meant to treat you ill. He meant to harm you, Elsa&mdash;my own dear
  dove . . . my angel from heaven . . . for whom I would have died, and would
  die to-day, if my death could bring you happiness. . . . I let him go and
  Leopold Hirsch killed him . . . if he had lived, he would have made your
  life one long misery. . . . Was it my fault that Leopold Hirsch killed him?&mdash;killed
  him at the moment when he was trying to do you as great harm as he could?
  By God, Elsa, I swear that I don&rsquo;t believe it was my fault . . . it
  was the will of God&mdash;God would not punish me for not interfering with
  His will. . . . Why, it wouldn&rsquo;t be justice, Elsa . . . it wouldn&rsquo;t
  be justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice broke in one agonized sob. He had put all his heart, all his feelings
  into that passionate appeal. He did not believe that he had done wrong, he
  had not on his soul the sense of the brand of Cain. Rough, untutored, a son
  of the soil, he saw no harm in sweeping out of the way a noisome creature
  who spreads evil and misery. And Elsa&rsquo;s was also a simple and untutored
  soul, even though in her calmer temperament the wilder passions of men had
  found no echo. True and steadfast in love, her mind was too simple to grasp
  at sophistry, to argue about right or wrong; her feelings were her guide,
  and even while Andor&mdash;burning with love and impatience&mdash;argued
  and clung desperately to his own point of view, she felt only the desire
  to comfort and to succour&mdash;above all, to love&mdash;she was just a girl&mdash;Andor&rsquo;s
  sweetheart and not his judge. God alone was that! God would punish if He
  so desired&mdash;indeed, He had punished already, for never had such sorrow
  descended in Andor&rsquo;s heart before, of that she felt quite sure.</p>
  <p>He became quite calm after awhile. Even his passion seemed to have died
  down under the weight of this immense sorrow.</p>
  <p>And the peace which comes from the plains when they are wrapped in the darkness
  of the night descended on the humble peasant-girl&rsquo;s soul; she saw things
  as they really were, not as men&rsquo;s turbulent desires would have them
  be&mdash;above all, not as a woman&rsquo;s idealism would picture them.</p>
  <p>She no longer had the desire to run away&mdash;and if the distant, unknown
  land was to wrap and enfold her out of the ken of this real, cruel world,
  then it should enfold her and Andor together, and her love would wrap him
  and comfort him too.</p>
  <p>So now&mdash;when he had finished speaking, when his fervent appeal to God
  and to her had died down on his quivering lips&mdash;she came close up to
  him and placed her small, cool hand upon his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andor,&rdquo; she said gently; and her voice shook and was almost
  undistinguishable from the sweet, soft sounds that filled the limitless plain. &ldquo;I
  am only an ignorant peasant-girl&mdash;you and I are only like children,
  of course, beside the clever people who can argue about such things. But
  this I do know, that there is no sin in the world so great but it can be
  blotted out and forgiven. You may have done a big, big, wrong, Andor&mdash;or
  perhaps you are not much to blame . . . I don&rsquo;t know how that is .
  . . Pater Bonif&aacute;cius will tell you, no doubt, when next you make your
  confession to him. . . . But I am too ignorant to understand . . . the plains
  have taught me all I know . . . and . . . and . . . I shall always love you,
  Andor . . . and not judge what you have done. . . . God will do that. . .
  . I can only love you. . . . That is all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice died away in the soughing of the wind. For a moment or two he
  stood beside her&mdash;not daring to speak&mdash;or to move&mdash;or to take
  that cool, little white hand in his and kiss it&mdash;for now she seemed
  to him more pure than she had ever been&mdash;almost holy&mdash;like a saint&mdash;hallowed
  by the perfect selflessness of her love.</p>
  <p>And as he stood beside her&mdash;with head bent and throat choked with sobs
  of infinite happiness&mdash;the darkness of the night fell wholly upon the
  plain. Nothing around but just this darkness, filled with all the sounds
  of hidden, pulsating life; overhead the clouds chased one another ceaselessly
  and restlessly, and from far away the dull murmur of the water came as a
  faint and rumbling echo.</p>
  <p>Andor could no longer see Elsa now, not even her silhouette; but her hand
  was still on his arm, and he felt the nearness of her presence, and knew
  that henceforth, throughout the years that were to come, a happiness such
  as he had never even dared to dream of would be his and hers too, until the
  day when they would leave the beautiful, mysterious plains for that hidden
  land beyond the glowing horizon, beyond the rosy dawn and the crimson sunset.</p>
  <p>Andor slowly fell on his knees and pressed his burning lips on the small,
  white hand. Just then in the east there was a rent in the clouds, a lining
  of silver appeared behind the darkness; the rent became wider and ever wider;
  the silver turned to lemon-gold, and slowly, majestically, the waning moon&mdash;honey-coloured
  and brilliant&mdash;emerged triumphantly, queening it over the plain.</p>
  <p>The silvery radiance lit up the vast, silent expanse of nothingness, the
  huge dome of the sky, the limitless area of stubble and stumps of hemp and
  dead sunflowers, and where the mysteries of the earth merged in those of
  the sky&mdash;it touched with its subtle radiance that unknown land on the
  horizon, far away, which no child of the plain has ever reached as yet.</p>
  <p>And from the distant village came softly sounding the tinkle of the church
  bell, tolling for evening prayer.</p>
  <p>Hand in hand, Andor and Elsa wandered back to the village&mdash;together&mdash;hand
  in hand with memory&mdash;hand in hand in never-fading love and understanding
  and simple trust&mdash;hand in hand upon the bosom of the illimitable plain.</p>
